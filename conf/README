Put device-specific configuration files here named mac-address.conf.

e.g.
  28:ef:01:bb:19:d1.conf

The file should contain environment variable assignments.  The only supported one is $TZ.

Since the kindles are running an old Linux, you need to give the full timezone format including the DST changes: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aix-posix/index.html

e.g.:

US Eastern time (with DST):
  TZ='EST+5EDT,M3.2.0/2,M11.1.0/2'

British Time (with DST):
  TZ='GMT0BST,M3.5.0/1:00:00,M10.5.0/2:00:00'
