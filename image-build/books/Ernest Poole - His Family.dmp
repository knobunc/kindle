But then with a sigh he returned to the news, and little by little his mind again was gripped and held by the most compelling of all appeals so far revealed in humanity\x{2019}s growth, the appeal of war to the mind of a man. He frowned as he read, but he read on. Why didn\x{2019}t England send over more men?
The clock struck <<nine|11>>.
\x{201c}Now, George. Now, Elizabeth,\x{201d} Edith said. With the usual delay and reluctance the children brought their work to an end, kissed their mother and went up to bed. And Edith continued sewing. Presently she smiled to herself. Little Tad had been so droll that day.",

He read again the next night and the next, while Edith sat at her sewing. And so this hour\x{2019}s companionship, from <<nine to ten in the evening|10>>, became a regular custom\x{2014}just one hour and no more, which Roger spent with his daughter, intimately and pleasantly.

So Laura was to stay all night, while Deborah gallivanted off to those infernal schools of hers! He had little joy in his paper that night. The news of the world had such a trick of suddenly receding a million miles away from a man the minute he was in trouble. And Roger was in trouble. With each slow tick of the clock in the hall he grew more certain and more disturbed. An hour passed. The clock struck <<nine|11>>. With a snort he tossed his paper aside.",

He fell back into his habit of going before dinner to his daughter\x{2019}s bedroom door to ask whether she would be home that night. At <<one|9m:1>> such time, getting no response and thinking Deborah was not there, he opened the door part way to make sure. And he saw her at her dresser, staring at herself in the glass, rigid as though in a trance. Later in the dining room he heard her step upon the stairs. She came in quietly and sat down; and as soon as dinner was over, she said her good-nights and left the house. But when she came home at <<midnight|13>>, he was waiting up for her. He had foraged in the kitchen, and on his study table he had set out some supper. While she sat there eating, her father watched her from his chair.",
