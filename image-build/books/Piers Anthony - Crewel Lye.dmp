            'The elven camp was around and in an elf elm, of course; everyone knows elves will reside nowhere else. When danger threatened, the women and children retreated to the heights, while the warriors ringed the base of the tree. At the moment, most of them were down, for they were setting up for their <<midday|13>> meal. The smells were good, but I was still digesting pies and wasn\'t really hungry. That was just as well, for their portions were small.',

            'By <<noon|13>> we reached the crest. Not the peak; there was no point in going right over that, as we weren\'t interested in height, just in getting past. We headed for the lowest notch in the ridge that ran from peak to peak in this range. Wind cut through it with extra effort, stirring up powdered snow; I was reminded of the snow-birds\' snow and shuddered, but I knew it wasn\'t that. I would be glad when we got down to good old-fashioned garden-variety tangle trees and hypnogourds again!',

She had lustrous black tresses, matching her <<midnight|13>> eyes. I had been partial to fair women, but now I realized that the dusky ones could be every bit as appealing, physically.

Each had a solid base that soon split into two major branches, and these split into four, and thence to eight, until at the fringe there were so many little branches that the eye lost track. The bark was corrugated and thus resembled printed words; sometimes I wished I could read, so that I could contemplate my own family tree.',
