The Contessa had found her nirvana on the shores of Lago di Garda when she had combined smoking marijuana with drinking champagne and eating apricots. Mme Floquet used Demerol occasionally and achieved noteworthy effects; it tampered in the most bizarre way imaginable with her sense of time, so that she had once arrived for a cocktail party at <<six o'clock in the morning|6>>, thinking it was <<six  in the afternoon|9a>>, and found no one, of course, but a flabbergasted housemaid\x{2014}people had dined out on that story for months.

The bread was sour and the soup was full of pasty clots; the potatoes were waterlogged and the old red cabbage was boiled until it was blue. The dessert was always a basin of molded farina with a sauce of gray jelly that had a gray taste. The aged ladies sat at one enormously long table, preserving an institutional silence until the farina was handed around, and, as if this were an alarm, all the withered lips began to move simultaneously and from them issued high squawks of protest against the dreary lot of being old and homeless and underfed.

They had left her alone at the riverbank for half an hour while they went upstream through brush that would have cut her bare legs. Before they left, her father had said, "There ain\'t nothing to harm you, sister. The animals is all there is and they won\'t be looking you up." She had never been frightened by the coyotes lamenting in the sage or the bobcats howling in the woods. But if she heard them when she was alone in the Temples\' house, she fancied them closing in, sobbing and whining for fresh meat, peering through the windows at her with their sulphur-colored eyes. Nor did the owls dismay her if she heard them while she was riding, but when their smug prophecies of doom were sifted through distance and closed windows, she trembled, for they seemed to speak directly to her, to say, "Look out! Look out!" Even the rats, frolicking through the walls, and even the old collie making his rounds hinted at danger. Afraid to move lest by moving she make a noise that would obscure another noise, like a footstep in the yard, she would sit motionless all evening in a big pink wing chair, staring at the wall opposite her where hung an oil painting of Mr. Temple\'s prize bull, Beau Mischief. By <<midnight|13>>, she would be wringing wet with sweat, although it was cold and she had let the fire go out.

Immediately, she heard another horse then another and another until it sounded like a dozen, trotting abreast. At first she thought they were on the road and would presently turn into the lane. But she did not hear the hoofs on the bridge over the slough and the sound did not come any closer. Yet it did not recede, and directly the pace speeded up to a gallop and then to a full run, and one of the creatures neighed crazily. At once, as if this had been a signal, there was a dead silence. In a moment came the epilogue: the cow\'s heartbreaking moo. Ella tried to go on with her counting, but she could not remember if she had left off at eighty-five or sixty-five and no sooner did she get her bearings than the horses began again: first just one trotting, then two, and so on until they had all joined in the race.

The gossip was different, for one thing, because it was stylized, creative (integrating the whole of the garrotted, absent friend), and all its details were precise and all its conceits were Jamesian, and all its practitioners sorrowfully saw themselves in the role of Pontius Pilate, that hero of the untoward circumstance.

They dispensed with the fripperies of olives in martinis and cherries in manhattans (God forbid!

But the most surprising thing of all about these parties was that every now and again, in the middle of the urgent, general conversation, this cream of the enlightened was horribly curdled, and an argument would end, quite literally, in a bloody nose or a black eye. Emma was always astounded when this happened and continued to think that these outbursts did not arise out of hatred or jealousy but out of some quite unaccountable quirk, almost a reflex, almost something physical.

They were still in their evening clothes. Beatrice\'s stance was tired; she looked bedraggled. They stood confronting each other beside the balustrade; ten Brink held her shoulders tightly, his sharp, handsome (but, thought Onslager suddenly, Mephistophelean) face bent down to hers.',

            'As Beatrice talked in discreet and general terms and candidly met Jack Onslager\'s eyes, in another part of her mind she was looking down the shadowy avenue of all the years of her life. As a girl and, before that, as a child, in the rambling, shambling house in St. Louis, Beatrice in her bedroom doing her lessons would hear a rocking chair on a squeaking board two flights down; this was the chair in which her tipsy mother seesawed, dressed for the street and wearing a hat, drinking gin and humming a Venetian barcarole to which she had forgotten the words. Her mother drank from <<noon|13>>, when, with lamentations, she got up, till <<midnight|13>>, when, the bottle dry, she fell into a groaning, nightmare-ridden unconsciousness that resembled the condition',

This mortal sickness was terrifying; her removal from reality was an ordeal for everyone, but not even the frequent and flamboyant threats of suicide, the sobbed proclamations that she was the chief of sinners, not all the excruciating embarrassments that were created by that interminable and joyless spree, were a fraction as painful as the daily quarrels that commenced as soon as Beatrice's father came home, <<just before six|10>>, and continued, unmitigated, until he\x{2014}a methodical man, despite his unfathomable spleen\x{2014}went to bed, at <<ten|9:0>>. Dinner, nightly, was a hideous experience for a child, since the parents were not inhibited by their children or the maid and went on heaping atrocious abuse upon each other, using sarcasm, threats, lies\x{2014}every imaginable expression of loathing and contempt. They swam in their own blood, but it was an ocean that seemed to foster and nourish them; their awful wounds were their necessities. Freshly appalled each evening, unforgiving, disgraced, Beatrice miserably pushed her food about on her plate, never hungry, and often she imagined herself alone on a desert, far away from any human voice. The moment the meal was finished, she fled to her schoolbooks, but even when she put her fingers in her ears, she could hear her parents raving, whining, bullying, laughing horrible, malign laughs. Sometimes, in counterpoint to this vendetta, another would start in the kitchen, where the impudent and slatternly maid and one of her lovers would ask  their  cross questions and give crooked answers.",

Since she maintained that it took two to make a quarrel, she tried in the beginning, with all the cleverness and fortitude she had, to refuse to be a party to the storms that rocked her house and left it a squalid shambles, but her silence only made her husband more passionately angry, and at last, ripped and raw, she had to defend herself.

The streets are empty of automobiles; the latest readers have gone to bed and the earliest risers are only just opening their eyes. The few people abroad are swift and furtive, like creatures who must quit a place before the sun shines forth. At that hour, their business seems mysterious and even shady, although they are not cutthroats or thieves but only watchmen and charwomen and night waitresses on their way home to dine at sunrise. So uncluttered are the streets, so starkly direct is the walk of the people that anyone whose custom it is to get up much later, at the normal hour, feels when he goes out that he intrudes upon a scene of bare but important privacy. And a light, springing on abruptly to make a staring eye in a blackened building, may stir him with embarrassment and wonder as if this were an alarm or an esoteric signal of hostility.',

The antelope with eaten ears and rubbed-off hide, the alabaster boar and the complacent Chinese philosopher made of porcelain stared out, looking, even at <<five in the morning|9a>>, for someone to adopt them and give them a good home.',

She nodded toward the candles and said, "They\'re every one of them lit already and they won\'t bring the new ones round till after the <<eight o\'clock|6>>." How well she knew the habits of this church\'s servants! She had probably studied them for months, huddling in shadows behind the grating that enclosed the baptismal font or in the corner where the statue of St. Ignatius stood. The girl saw that what she said was true and she blew out the taper and replaced it. But she was determined to make the offering and she stepped down to go to another altar. The old woman took hold of her coat and peered straight into her face, shamelessly. She said, "You\'re young and pretty, girlie." The oblique entreaty weakened her, embarrassed her movement like a web, and finally she put her hand into her pocket and took out the dime. Before the clever, metropolitan fingers had enclosed the alms, the girl had gone, running down Sixteenth Street to the corner of Sixth Avenue. The streets were lighter now, and the big star had begun to pale. Shopkeepers were putting trash on the sidewalks; news vendors were cutting the ropes that bound the morning papers; a melancholy white horse ambled down the street dragging a milk truck after him.',
