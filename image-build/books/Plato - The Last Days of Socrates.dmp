            "A famous passage of Diogenes Laertius (<<3.48|5a:0>>) gives Plato the credit for the introduction of the philosophic dialogue, allegedly after he had developed great enthusiasm for the \x{2018}mimes\x{2019} (brief non-philosophical dramatic sketches) of Sophron. A fuller parallel passage in an Oxyrhynchus papyrus published by M. Haslam in 1976 (P. Oxy. 3219, fr. I) makes it clear that it is the dramatic dialogue which is supposed to have owed so much to Plato.5 We may suppose that with his great dramatic talents, which may at one time have been encouraging him to write tragedies, Plato was able to inject extra life into bare dramatic sketches, which, like other prose works, were probably read aloud by the author in the first instance. To read a narrated work one only had to play one character, the narrator; to read a dramatic work one had to become a minimum of two.6 Playing such a double role seems to have been considered educationally dangerous at Republic 394b ff., but all the same Theaetetus 143c speaks as if Plato had begun to see the perpetual inclusion of such phrases as \x{2018}I said\x{2019} and \x{2018}He agreed\x{2019} as unnecessarily cumbersome. Dramatic works often have a freshness and immediacy about them. We enter directly, often quite suddenly and with little or no introductory conversation,7 into the world of Socratic debate. The Euthyphro and Crito are examples of such works. By contrast, narrated dialogues, particularly the Phaedo, Symposium and Parmenides where setting of the introductory dialogue is remote from the action, ease us gradually into the world of Socratic legend.",

Into this gulf all the rivers flow together, and from it they flow forth again; and each acquires the nature of that part of the earth through (b) which it flows. The cause of the flowing in and out of all these streams is that the mass of liquid has no bottom or foundation; so it oscillates and surges to and fro, and the air or breath that belongs to it does the same; for it accompanies the liquid both as it rushes to the further side of the earth and as it returns to this. And just as when we breathe we exhale and inhale the breath in a continuous stream, so in this case too the breath, oscillating with the liquid, causes terrible and (c) monstrous winds as it passes in and out. So when the water retires to the so-called \x{201c}lower\x{201d} region the streams in the earth flow into those parts and irrigate them fully; and when in turn it ebbs from there and rushes back this way, it fills our streams again, and when they are filled they flow through their channels and through the earth; and arriving in those regions to which their ways have been severally prepared, (d) they make seas and lakes and rivers and springs. Then sinking again beneath the ground, some by way of more and further regions, others by fewer and nearer, they empty themselves once more into Tartarus, some much lower, some only a little lower than the point at which they were drawn off; but they all flow in at a level deeper than their rise. (e) Some flow in on the opposite side to that on which they came out, and others on the same side; while some make a complete circle and, winding like a snake one or even more times round the earth, descend as far as possible before they again discharge their waters. It is possible to descend in either direction as far as the centre, but no further; for either direction from the centre is uphill, whichever way the streams are flowing.",
