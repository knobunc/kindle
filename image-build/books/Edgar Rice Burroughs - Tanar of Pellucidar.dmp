            "IT MUST be some fifteen years since David Innes and I broke through the inner surface of the earth\x{2019}s crust and emerged into savage Pellucidar, but when a stationary sun hangs eternally at <<high noon|13>> and there is no restless moon and there are no stars, time is measureless and so it may have been a hundred years ago or one. Who knows? Of course, since David returned to earth and brought back many of the blessings of civilization we have had the means to measure time, but the people did not like it. They found that it put restrictions and limitations upon them that they never had felt before and they came to hate it and ignore it until David, in the goodness of his heart, issued an edict abolishing time in Pellucidar.",

Similarly, they eat with unbelievable irregularity.',
