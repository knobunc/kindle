            "In the fall of 1867, at <<twenty-one|9u:0>>, Burnham returned to Chicago. He sought work in a field where he might be successful and took a job as a draftsman with the architectural firm of Loring & Jenney. He had found his calling, he wrote in 1868, and told his parents he wanted to become the \x{201c}greatest architect in the city or country.\x{201d} The next year, however, he bolted for Nevada with friends to try his hand at mining gold. He failed. He ran for the Nevada legislature and failed again. He returned to Chicago broke, in a cattle car, and joined the firm of an architect named L. G. Laurean. Then came October 1871: a cow, a lantern, confusion, and wind. The Great Chicago Fire took nearly eighteen thousand buildings and left more than a hundred thousand people homeless. The destruction promised endless work for the city\x{2019}s architects. But Burnham quit. He sold plate glass, failed. He became a druggist, quit. \x{201c}There is,\x{201d} he wrote, \x{201c}a family tendency to get tired of doing the same thing very long.\x{201d}",

            "As the firm grew, so did the city. It got bigger, taller, and richer; but it also grew dirtier, darker, and more dangerous. A miasma of cinder-flecked smoke blackened its streets and at times reduced visibility to the distance of a single block, especially in winter, when coal furnaces were in full roar. The ceaseless passage of trains, grip-cars, trolleys, carriages\x{2014}surreys, landaus, victorias, broughams, phaetons, and hearses, all with iron-clad wheels that struck the pavement like rolling hammers\x{2014}produced a constant thunder that did not recede until <<after midnight|13>> and made the open-window nights of summer unbearable. In poor neighborhoods garbage mounded in alleys and overflowed giant trash boxes that became banquet halls for rats and bluebottle flies. Billions of flies. The corpses of dogs, cats, and horses often remained where they fell. In January they froze into disheartening poses; in August they ballooned and ruptured. Many ended up in the Chicago River, the city\x{2019}s main commercial artery. During heavy rains, river water flowed in a greasy plume far out into Lake Michigan, to the towers that marked the intake pipes for the city\x{2019}s drinking water. In rain any street not paved with macadam oozed a fragrant muck of horse manure, mud, and garbage that swelled between granite blocks like pus from a wound. Chicago awed visitors and terrified them. French editor Octave Uzanne called it \x{201c}that Gordian city, so excessive, so satanic.\x{201d} Paul Lindau, an author and publisher, described it as \x{201c}a gigantic peepshow of utter horror, but extraordinarily to the point.\x{201d}",

Minnie Williams had killed them or had ordered them killed. Holmes knew she had an unsavory associate named \x{201c}Hatch.\x{201d} He guessed that Williams had suggested the killings and Hatch had carried them out. It was all too horrible to comprehend: \x{201c}I gave up trying to read the article, and saw instead the two little faces as they had looked when I hurriedly left them\x{2014}felt the innocent child\x{2019}s kiss so timidly given and heard again their earnest words of farewell, and I realized that I had received another burden to carry to my grave. . . .
