            "Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
he wrote a poemAnd he called it \x{201c}Chops\x{201d}
because that was the name of his dogAnd that\x{2019}s what it was all aboutAnd his teacher gave him an A
and a gold starAnd his mother hung it on the kitchen door
and read it to his auntsThat was the year Father Tracy
took all the kids to the zooAnd he let them sing on the busAnd his little sister was born
with tiny toenails and no hairAnd his mother and father kissed a lotAnd the girl around the corner sent him a
Valentine signed with a row of X\x{2019}s
and he had to ask his father what the X\x{2019}s meantAnd his father always tucked him in bed at nightAnd was always there to do it

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines
he wrote a poemAnd he called it \x{201c}Autumn\x{201d}
because that was the name of the seasonAnd that\x{2019}s what it was all aboutAnd his teacher gave him an A
and asked him to write more clearlyAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because of its new paintAnd the kids told him
that Father Tracy smoked cigarsAnd left butts on the pewsAnd sometimes they would burn holesThat was the year his sister got glasses
with thick lenses and black framesAnd the girl around the corner laughed
when he asked her to go see Santa ClausAnd the kids told him why
his mother and father kissed a lotAnd his father never tucked him in bed at nightAnd his father got mad
when he cried for him to do it.

Once on a paper torn from his notebook
he wrote a poemAnd he called it \x{201c}Innocence: A Question\x{201d}
because that was the question about his girlAnd that\x{2019}s what it was all aboutAnd his professor gave him an A
and a strange steady lookAnd his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because he never showed herThat was the year that Father Tracy diedAnd he forgot how the end
of the Apostle\x{2019}s Creed wentAnd he caught his sister
making out on the back porchAnd his mother and father never kissed
or even talkedAnd the girl around the corner
wore too much makeupThat made him cough when he kissed her
but he kissed her anyway
because that was the thing to doAnd at <<three A.M.|5>> he tucked himself into bed
his father snoring soundly

That\x{2019}s why on the back of a brown paper bag
he tried another poemAnd he called it \x{201c}Absolutely Nothing\x{201d}Because that\x{2019}s what it was really all aboutAnd he gave himself an Aand a slash on each damned wristAnd he hung it on the bathroom door
because this time he didn\x{2019}t think
he could reach the kitchen.

That was the poem I read for Patrick. Nobody knew who wrote it, but Bob said he heard it before, and he heard that it was some kid\x{2019}s suicide note. I really hope it wasn\x{2019}t because then I don\x{2019}t know if I like the ending.",
