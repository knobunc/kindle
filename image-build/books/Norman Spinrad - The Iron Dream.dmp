            "Adolf Hitler was born in Austria on April 20, 1889. As a young man he migrated to Germany and served in the German army during the Great War. After the war, he dabbled briefly in radical politics in Munich before finally emigrating to New York in 1919. While learning English, he eked out a precarious existence as a sidewalk artist and occasional translator in New York\x{2019}s bohemian haven, Greenwich Village. After several years of this freewheeling life, he began to pick up odd jobs as a magazine and comic illustrator. He did his first interior illustration for the science-fiction magazine Amazing in 1930. By <<1932|9e:1>>, he was a regular illustrator for the science-fiction magazines, and, by <<1935|9e:1>>, he had enough confidence in his English to make his debut as a science-fiction writer. He devoted the rest of his life to the science-fiction genre as a writer, illustrator, and fanzine editor. Although best known to present-day SF fans for his novels and stories, Hitler was a popular illustrator during the Golden Age of the thirties, edited several anthologies, wrote lively reviews, and published a popular fanzine, Storm, for nearly ten years.",

            'Adolf Hitler was born an Austrian and migrated to Germany, in whose army he served during the Great War, before emigrating to New York in 1919. During the period between the end of the Great War and his move to America, Hitler was involved with a small radical party known as the National Socialists. Very little is known about this obscure group which disappeared <<around 1923|18:0>>, a full seven years before the Communist coup made the subject academic. However it does seem clear that the National Socialists, or Nazis, as they were sometimes called, anticipated the machinations of the Soviet Union by many years and were confirmed anti-Communists.',

            'Feric somewhat dubiously watched the Finance Minister delivering a tedious economic report on the official <<noon|13>> news broadcast. The point of all this still eluded him; the public television broadcasts were controlled entirely by the present decadent regime. There was no doubt that television broadcasts were a propaganda tool of immense potential, reaching as they did public television receivers in every public square in Heldon. But since the government had absolute control of this means of communication, it seemed impossible that the Party would ever be able to use this latest wonder of Helder science for its own patriotic ends.',

            "As the hour of <<midnight|13>> approached, Feric Jaggar assumed his position in the observer\x{2019}s seat of the lead Helder tank. Beside him in the driver\x{2019}s position, Ludolf Best\x{2019}s eyes shone with excitement and fanaticism. The true battle in this campaign would be with time itself, for the Borgravian army hardly qualified as a joke. Therefore the vanguard of the force that Feric had assembled just inside the south-eastern margin of the Emerald Wood consisted of a hundred and fifty tanks, well stocked with incendiary and high-explosive shells. Combined with the devastating force of a hundred dive-bombers even now winging their way toward the Borgravian capital, these tanks would be enough to pulverise all organised opposition within Borgravia in a matter of hours. As the tanks swept eastward across Borgravia, motorised infantry and motorcycle SS would mop up in their van, and by the time the tank force reached the Vetonian border, Remler would already have Classification Camps under construction.",

            'To the north, wave after wave of Helder dreadnoughts pounded the advancing Zind horde. The pilots had reported that this gargantuan force outnumbered even the huge Helder army by <<almost ten to one|10>>. Although the Helder planes had blasted every last Zind aerial dreadnought from the sky and ranged over the forces of Zind at will, vast formations of the mutated flyers hovered over the horde like swarms of huge venomous insects. In addition to the usual Warriors, war-wagons, and dreadnoughts, the scout planes had spotted several hundred tanks, Puller-drawn artillery, and vast troops of Warriors who seemed somehow different from the usual variety. Truly, the hosts of Zind were on the move in unprecedented force; upon the coming battle would hinge the future of the world for all time.',
