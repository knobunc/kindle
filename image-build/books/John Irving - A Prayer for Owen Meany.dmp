            "But by picking up Hester after work, Owen Meany rarely got back to Hester\x{2019}s apartment before <<one o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>; Hester was so keyed up after waitressing that she wasn\x{2019}t ready to go to bed before two\x{2014}first, she had to wash her hair, which further woke her up; and then she needed to complain. Often someone had insulted her; sometimes it had been a customer who\x{2019}d tried to pick her up\x{2014}and failing that, had left her a rotten tip. And the other waitresses were \x{201c}woefully unaware,\x{201d} Hester said; what they were unaware of, she wouldn\x{2019}t say\x{2014}but they often insulted Hester, too. And if Owen Meany didn\x{2019}t spend the night in her apartment\x{2014}if he drove home to Gravesend\x{2014}he sometimes didn\x{2019}t get to bed before <<three|9c:1>>.",

            "It was <<about ten o\x{2019}clock in the evening|6>> when I left Pastor Merrill sitting at his desk in the vestry office; it was only half an hour later when I finished talking with Dan and drove again past Hurd\x{2019}s Church at the corner of Front Street and Tan Lane. Lewis Merrill was still there, the light still on in the vestry office; and now there was also light shining through the stained-glass windows of the chancel\x{2014}that enclosed and meant-to-be-sacred space surrounding the altar of a church, where (no doubt) my father was composing his last words for Owen Meany.",

            "I put the dummy and Mary Magdalene\x{2019}s arms into my Volkswagen and drove to the breakwater at Rye Harbor. It was <<midnight|13>>. I threw the baseball as far into the harbor as I could; it made a very small splash there\x{2014}not disturbing the gulls. I flung Mary Magdalene\x{2019}s long, heavy arms into the harbor, too; they made more of a splash, but the boats slapping on their moorings and the surf striking the breakwater outside the harbor had conditioned the gulls there to remain undisturbed by any noise of water.",

            "It was more than a year after I came to Canada, when the town churches of Gravesend\x{2014}and Hurd\x{2019}s Church, upon the urging of Lewis Merrill\x{2014}organized a so-called Vietnam Moratorium. On a given day in October, all the church bells were rung at <<6:00 A.M.|2a>>\x{2014}I\x{2019}m sure that pissed some people off!\x{2014}and services were held as early as <<7:00|2>>. Following the services, a parade then commenced from the town bandstand, marching up Front Street to assemble on the lawn in front of the Main Academy Building on the Gravesend campus; there followed a peaceful demonstration, so-called, and a few of the standard antiwar speeches. Typically, the town newspaper, The Gravesend News-Letter, did not editorialize on the event, except to say that a march against mayhem on the nation\x{2019}s highways would be a more significant use of such civilian zeal; as for the academy newspaper, The Grave reported that it was \x{201c}about time\x{201d} the school and the town combined forces to demonstrate against the evil war. The News-Letter estimated the crowd was less than four hundred people\x{2014}\x{201c}and almost as many dogs.\x{201d} The Grave claimed that the crowd swelled to at least six hundred \x{201c}well-behaved\x{201d} people. Both papers reported the only counterdemonstration. As the parade swung up Front Street\x{2014}just past the old Town Hall, where The Gravesend Players had for so long been entertaining both young and old\x{2014}a former American Legion commander stepped off the sidewalk and waved a North Vietnamese flag in the face of a young tuba player in the Gravesend Academy marching band.",

I drove to 80 Front Street and watched the <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> news with Grandmother; she had lately taken an interest in a terrible local channel on which the news detailed the grim statistics of a few highway fatalities and made no mention of the war in Vietnam; and there was a \x{201c}human interest\x{201d} story about a bad child who\x{2019}d blinded a poor dog with a firecracker.",

At first I thought that the different time zone\x{2014}in Arizona\x{2014}had confused him; but I knew he would have called Hester in Durham and Dan in Waterhouse Hall before he found me at my grandmother\x{2019}s, and I was sure that Hester or Dan, or both of them, would have told him how late it was.",
