At <<four|9e>>, Andy was a little old for a christening (and Mama wasn\x{2019}t even Catholic), but St. Paul\x{2019}s had just been completed, and it was the grandest place in town, a Spanish-style edifice with towers like a castle. Mama wanted folks to see that her son was being raised a proper gentleman. To that end, Margaret had made him a christening outfit with Irish lace she ordered from Denver. Technically, it was a dress, since she had simply enlarged a McCall\x{2019}s pattern meant for babes-in-arms, but Andy had not complained. He had worn it all day, in fact, chasing a billy goat around the yard. He could still remember how fine it felt against his skin, and the flinty look in Mama\x{2019}s eyes when he refused to take it off.",

Not an awful sound, really, just an awfully familiar one, and the wrong accompaniment to Richard Halliburton\x{2019}s Book of Marvels. He wondered if Mama truly wanted to go on like this forever, selling good-for-all-night tokens unto death, or if she ever dreamed of being somewhere else entirely. That would be fine with him, unless her escape plan involved the acquisition of a wealthy daughter-in-law, in which case leaving would be just as grimly unimaginable as staying.",
