            "Buffalo disappeared from Georgia in early Colonial time. William Bartram noted this when he visited the colony and
wrote Travels in Georgia and Florida, 1773\x{2014}74. Bartram, from Philadelphia, was the first naturalist to describe in detail the American subtropics. After his book reached London, sedentary English poets cribbed from his descriptions (Wordsworth, for example, and Coleridge). Ten miles south of Dry Fork Creek, Sam, Carol, and I crossed Bartram\x{2019}s path. In Bartram\x{2019}s words, \x{201c}We came into an open Forest of Pines, Scrub white Oaks, Black Jacks, Plumb, Hicory, Grapes Vines, Rising a sort of Ridge, come to a flat levill Plain, and at the upper side of this, levell at the foot of the hills of the great Ridge, is the great Buffiloe Lick, which are vast Pits, licked in the Clay, formerly by the Buffiloes, and now kept smoothe and open by Cattle, deer, and horses, that resort here constantly to lick the clay, which is a greesey Marle of various colours, Red, Yellow & white, & has a sweetish taste, but nothing saltish that I could perceive.\x{201d} Bartram was describing what is now Philomath, Georgia 30659\x{2014}a one-street town consisting of thirty houses and a buffalo lick. Philomath was established, early in the nineteenth century, as a seat of learning\x{2014}hence the name. The town was the address of an academy whose students, in time, vanished like the buffalo. Now it was a place of preeminent silence under big oaks, and as we glided into town we were the only thing that moved. Ninety blacks, fifty whites lived there, but no one was out in the <<midday|13>> shade. The almost idling engine was the only sound. In an L-shaped elegant clapboard house, built in 1795, lived Dorothy Daniel Wright. Sam and Carol, having read Bartram\x{2019}s description and having determined that the buffalo lick was still intact, wanted to see it and, they hoped, to register it as a Georgia Natural Area. Miss Wright was the person to see. It was her lick. She was in her upper sixties. Her hair was white and swept upward, and crowned with a braided gold bun. Her welcome was warm. She showed us the lick. Cattle and deer had licked it slick all through her girlhood, she said. Now it was covered
with grass, some hawthorn and sumac, and dominated by an immense, outreaching laurel oak. Carol squatted flat-footed, knees high, and dug with her hands for various colors of clay. She ate some blue clay, and handed pieces to me and Sam. It was sweet, bland, alkaline, slightly chewy. \x{201c}My first thought was \x{2018}soapy,\x{2019}\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I expected it to get stronger, but it didn\x{2019}t. The final thought was \x{2018}sweetness:\x{201d} She put a bit more in her mouth and ate it contemplatively. There was, apparently, no sodium chloride in this ground. Phosphate, sodium, and calcium are what the buffalo licked. Where did they get their salt? \x{201c}Twelve miles away there was salt,\x{201d} Miss Wright said. \x{201c}Twelve miles is nothin\x{2019} to a buffalo roamin\x{2019} around. Between the two licks, they got all the minerals they needed for their bovine metabolism.\x{201d} Miss Wright had taught biology and chemistry in various high schools for forty-three years. She was eager to register the Great Buffalo Lick Natural Area, which had once been a boundary-line landmark separating the Georgia colony from the territory of the Creeks and Cherokees. She took us home to a lunch of salad and saltines. Into the salad went mushrooms, violets, and trout lilies that Carol had gathered in the mountains the day before.",

            "Now, at <<noon|13>>, a hundred miles or so to the southeast and by another stream, we were sitting on the big felled oak, pouring out the last of the wine, with Chap Causey moving toward us a foot at a time in his American dragline crane. He swung a pair of mats around behind him and backed up a bit more, and as he went on gutting the streambed the oak began to tremble. It must have weighed two or three tons, but it was trembling and felt like an earthquake\x{2014}time to move. Carol picked up a piece of dry otter scat. She bounced it in the palm of her hand and looked upcurrent at the unaltered stream and downcurrent into the new ditch. She said, \x{201c}You can talk about coons\x{2019} being able to go off into the woods and eat nuts and berries, because they\x{2019}re omnivores. But not this otter. He\x{2019}s finished.\x{201d} She broke open the scat. Inside it were fishbones and hair\x{2014}hair of a mouse or hair of a young rabbit.

He could lay it under stumps with the delicacy of an eyedropper, or drive it, if he wanted to, halfway down the lake. He caught two bass. One wrapped itself hopelessly into a big waterlogged multiple branch. We pulled the branch up out of the water. The bass had himself woven into it like a bird in a cage.

Winning is everything to tennis players, although more than ninety-nine per cent of them are certain losers\x{2014}and they expect to lose to him. Laver, who has a narrow and delicate face, freckles, a hawk\x{2019}s nose, thinning red hair, and the forearm of a Dungeness crab, is known to all of them as Rocket. Alexander, who is also Australian and uses a Dunlop no doubt because Laver does, has just aced the Rocket twice and leads him forty\x{2014}love. To prepare for this match, Alexander hit with Roger Taylor, who is left-handed, and practiced principally serving to Taylor\x{2019}s backhand. Alexander serves again, to Laver\x{2019}s backhand. When Laver is in trouble, fury comes into his game. He lashes out now and passes Alexander on the right. He passes Alexander on the left.

            "Graebner and Tiriac, on Court 3, is a vaudeville act. The draw has put it together. Graebner, the paper salesman from Upper Middle Manhattan, has recently changed his image. He has replaced his horn-rimmed glasses with contact lenses, and he has grown his soft and naturally undulant dark-brown hair to the point where he is no longer an exact replica of Clark Kent but is instead a living simulacrum of Prince Valiant. Tiriac hates Wimbledon. Tiriac, who is Rumanian, feels that he and his doubles partner, Nastase, are the best doubles team in the world. Wimbledon disagrees. Tiriac and Nastase are not seeded in doubles, and Tiriac is mad as hell. He hates Wimbledon and by extension he hates Graebner. So he is killing
Graebner. He has taken a set from him, now leads him in the second, and Graebner is fighting for his life. Tiriac is of middle height. His legs are unprepossessing. He has a barrel chest. His body is encased in a rug of hair. Off court, he wears cargo-net shirts. His head is covered with medusan wires. Above his mouth is a mustache that somehow suggests that this man has been to places most people do not imagine exist. By turns, he glowers at the crowd, glares at the officials, glares at God in the sky. As he waits for Graebner to serve, he leans forward, swaying. It is the nature of Tiriac\x{2019}s posture that he bends forward all the time, so now he appears to be getting ready to dive into the ground. Graebner hits one of his big crunch serves, and Tiriac slams it back, down the line, so fast that Graebner cannot reach it. Graebner throws his racquet after the ball. Tiriac shrugs. All the merchants of Mesopotamia could not equal Tiriac\x{2019}s shrug. Graebner serves again. Tiriac returns, and stays on the base line. Graebner hits a backhand that lands on the chalk beside Tiriac. \x{201c}Out!\x{201d} shouts the linesman. Graebner drops his racquet, puts his hands on his hips, and examines the linesman with hatred. The linesman is seventy-two years old and has worked his way to Wimbledon through a lifetime of similar decisions in Somerset, Cornwall, and Kent. But if Graebner lives to be ninety, he will never forget that call, or that face. Tiriac watches, inscrutably. Even in his Adidas shoes and his Fred Perry shirt, Tiriac does not in any way resemble a tennis player.

The set ends <<14-12|5a:1>>, Graebner; and Graebner is still alive at Wimbledon.",

            "Everyone goes to Hurlingham on that ultimate Sunday afternoon. All through the previous fortnight, the tennis players of the world have gradually come to London, and by tradition they first convene at Hurlingham. Hurlingham is a Victorian sporting club with floor-to-ceiling windows, sixteen chimney pots, and wide surrounding lawns\x{2014}bowling lawns, tennis lawns, croquet lawns, putting lawns\x{2014}under giant copper beeches, beside the Thames. Some players play informal sets of doubles. Others merely sit on the lawns, sip Pimm\x{2019}s Cups under the sun, and watch women in pastel dresses walking by on maroon pathways. In the background are people in their seventies, dressed in pure white, tapping croquet balls with deadly skill across textured grasses smooth
as broadloom. A uniformed band, with folding chairs and music stands, plays \x{201c}Bow, Bow, Ye Lower Middle Classes\x{201d} while tea is served beneath the trees\x{2014}a strawberry tart, sandwiches, petits fours, fruitcake, and a not-so-bitter macaroon. Arthur Ashe, eating his tea, drinking the atmosphere, says, \x{201c}This is my idea of England.\x{201d} On a slope a short distance away, Graham Stillwell, Ashe\x{2019}s first-round opponent, sits with his wife and his five-year-old daughter, Tiffany. This is the second straight year that Ashe has drawn Stillwell in the first round at Wimbledon, and last year Stillwell had Ashe down and almost out\x{2014}twice Stillwell was serving for the match\x{2014}before Ashe won the fifth set, <<12-10|5a:1>>. Reporters from the Daily Mirror and the Daily Sketch now come up to Ashe and ask him if he has been contacted by certain people who plan to demonstrate against the South African players at Wimbledon. \x{201c}Why should they contact me?\x{201d} Ashe says. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not a South African.\x{201d} Mrs. Stillwell rises from the sloping lawn and stretches her arms. \x{201c}My God! She\x{2019}s pregnant again,\x{201d} Ashe observes. Jean Borotra, now seventy-two, is hitting beautiful ground strokes with Gardnar Mulloy. Borotra wears long white trousers. Two basset hounds walk by, leashed to a man in a shirt of broad pink and white stripes. The band is playing the music of Alb\x{e9}niz. The lady tennis players drift about, dressed, for some reason, in multicolored Victorian gowns. Laver, in dark slacks and a sport shirt of motley dark colors, stands near the clubhouse, watching it all with his arms folded. He seems uncomfortable. He looks incongruous\x{2014}small, undynamic, unprepossessing, vulnerable\x{2014}but every eye at Hurlingham, sooner or later in the afternoon, watches him in contemplation. He stands out no more than a single blade of grass, but no one fails to see him, least of all Seewagen, who stands at the edge of the party like a figure emerging from a haunted forest. He wears an old worn-out pair of lightweight sneakers, of the type that tennis players do not use and sailors
do, and a baggy gray sweater with the sleeves shoved far up his thin brown arms. Veins stand out on the backs of his hands and across his forearms. He grins a little, but his eyes are sober. His look is profoundly philosophical. Gene Scott informs him that players scheduled for the Centre Court are entitled to a special fifteen minutes of practice on an outside court beforehand. \x{201c}Good, I\x{2019}ll take McManus,\x{201d} Seewagen says. McManus, from Berkeley and ranked tenth in the United States, is left-handed. He is also short and redheaded. He has the same build Laver has, much the same nose and similar freckles as well. Players practicing with McManus easily fantasize that they are hitting with the Rocket himself, and thus they inflate their confidence. McManus is the favorite dummy of everyone who has to play against Laver. Ashe speaks quietly to Seewagen and tells him not to worry. \x{201c}You\x{2019}ll never play better,\x{201d} Ashe says. \x{201c}You\x{2019}ll get in there, in the Centre Court, and you\x{2019}ll get inspired, and then when the crowd roars for your first great shot, you\x{2019}ll want to run into the locker room and call it a day.\x{201d}",

            "Ralston, at the umpire\x{2019}s chair, pries the cap off a vial of Biostrath and sucks out the essences of the ninety medicinal herbs. Dennis has no contract with Biostrath. He is not drinking the stuff for money. He is drinking it for his life. Beside him stands his opponent, John Newcombe, the second-best forehand, the second-best volley, the second-best tennis player in the world. Dennis follows the elixir with a Pepsi-Cola, also without benefit of a contract. The score is 4-5, first set. Ralston and Newcombe return to the base lines, and Ralston tosses up a ball to serve. The crowd is chattering, gurgling like a mountain stream. Prince Charles has just come in and is settling into his seat. \x{201c}Quiet, please,\x{201d} says the umpire, and the stream subsides. Ralston serves, wins\x{2014}six all. Seven
all. Eight all. Nine all. Ten all. There is a lot of grinning back and forth across the net. Newcombe drives a backhand down the line. Ralston leaps, intercepts it, and drops the ball into Newcombe\x{2019}s court for a winner. Newcombe looks at Ralston. Ralston grins. Newcombe smiles back. It is an attractive match, between two complete professionals. Newcombe passes Ralston with a forehand down the line. \x{201c}Yep,\x{201d} says Ralston. Ralston finds a winner in a drop shot overhead. \x{201c}Good shot,\x{201d} calls Newcombe. Eleven all. When they shout, it is at themselves. Newcombe moves to the net behind a fragile approach shot, runs back under a humiliatingly good lob, and drives an off-balance forehand into the net. \x{201c}John!\x{201d} he calls out. \x{201c}Idiotic!\x{201d} Ralston tosses a ball up to serve, but catches it instead of hitting it. He is having a problem with the sun, and he pauses to apologize to Newcombe for the inconvenience the delay might be causing him. Small wonder they can\x{2019}t beat each other. Grace of this kind has not always been a characteristic of Ralston\x{2014}of Newcombe, yes, but Ralston grew up tightly strung in California, and in his youth his tantrums were a matter of national report. He is twenty-seven now and has changed. Quiet, serious, introspective, coach of the U.S. Davis Cup Team, he has become a professional beyond the imagination of most people who only knew him long ago. He plans his matches almost on a drawing board. Last night, he spent hours studying a chart he has made of every shot Newcombe has hit in this tournament. 13\x{2014}12. Dennis opens another Biostrath and another Pepsi-Cola. He knows what the odds have become. The winner of this set, since it has gone so far, will in all likelihood be the winner of the match. Ralston has been a finalist at Wimbledon. But he has never won a major international tournament. In such tournaments, curiously enough, he has played Newcombe ten times and has won seven, but never for the biggest prize. Newcombe has a faculty for going all the way. Ralston, meanwhile, has pointed his life
toward doing so at least once, and, who knows, he tells himself, this could be the time. He toes the line and tosses up the ball. He catches it, and tosses it up again. The serve is bad. The return is a winner. Love-fifteen. He has more trouble with the sun. Love-thirty. Catastrophe is falling from nowhere. Love\x{2014}forty. Serve, return, volley. Fifteen\x{2014}forty. He serves. Fault. He serves again. Double fault. Game and first set to Newcombe, <<14-12|5a:1>>. Ralston looks up, over the trigger of a thousand old explosions, and he forces a smile. <<14-12|5a:1>>, 9\x{2014}7, 6\x{2014}2. When it is over, the ball boys carry out seven empty bottles of Pepsi-Cola and four empty vials of the ninety medicinal herbs.",

            "Hartzog is busy catching trout. This river\x{2014}the White River\x{2014}is everything Tony Buford said it would be. Cal Smith, the riverman, has to work hard to keep Hartzog\x{2019}s hook covered with corn. The bait is canned kernel corn. The boat is anchored in a broad patch of dancing water. The corn drifts down through V-shaped riffles and, almost every time, disappears into the mouth of a trout. The White River is the dream of thousands, who come from all over the United States to fish it. It is broad, cold, clear, shallow, and frequently broken by the aerated rips that seem to intoxicate trout. The White River comes out of Bull Shoals Dam, near Lakeview, Arkansas. The water impounded on the other side of the dam is so deep that it is very cold near the bottom, and it is this cold water that comes shooting out of the penstocks and forms the river, which is green and beautiful and as natural as a city street. The White River grows toward the end of the day. <<Around 5:30 P.M.|2a>>, people start turning on lights, heating up ovens, and frying pork chops in Fayetteville, Little Rock, Mountain Home, Memphis. The river rises. More people, more pork chops\x{2014}the river goes on rising. Turbines spin in Bull Shoals Dam. The peak comes when one million pork chops are sizzling all at once and the river is so high it flows around the trunks of trees. Then it starts going down. While Arkansas sleeps, the river goes down so far that the trout have to know where to go to survive. At <<6 A.M.|5>>, a small creek is running through the riverbed, viscous with trout. Then people start getting up in Fayetteville, Little Rock, Mountain Home, and Memphis. The fatback hits the frying pans. Up comes the river, cold, clear, fast, and green. Trout are not native down here. There are no trout in the Buffalo. They can live in the
White River for a hundred miles below Lakeview because of the refrigerant effect of the dam. The trout are born in a federal hatchery near Norfork, where they are raised on dry meal. They are stocked in the White River\x{2014}ninety-six thousand trout a month in the summer\x{2014}creating what most of the sport fishermen who have been here would call a paradise. Smith strings corn like pearls on Hartzog\x{2019}s hook, one kernel after another, completely covering the metal from eye to barb. Hartzog flips the bait into the stream. Vapors rise from the cold river. The line and the rod vibrate. It is difficult to tell whether the vibration is from the strike of a trout or the pull of the current. Once more it is a trout. Hartzog reels the fish in. It flips once to the right, once to the left, and lolls by the boat as it is netted. The trout is nine inches long. With a pair of forceps, Smith takes the hook out of the fish\x{2019}s gullet. Then he re-beads the hook with corn while Hartzog tells him about Hazel Creek in the Great Smoky Mountains. \x{201c}There hasn\x{2019}t been a stocked trout put in that creek in three hundred years,\x{201d} he says. \x{201c}Mountain people have been fishing Hazel Creek since European civilization moved over here. And there\x{2019}s only been one kind of trout in there, ever, and those are wild trout. I fish for the fun of fishing, and there\x{2019}s a real difference between a hatchery fish and a wild fish. One good bass out of the Buffalo would be worth more to me than six hundred trout out of here. Tony and the boys can stay here if they want. I\x{2019}m going back up the Buffalo.\x{201d}",

He washed his clothes in a coin laundry, and he missed his home, his wife, his boat, the fishing. As Labor Day drew near, he slept less and less. He weighed a hundred and fifty-five when he arrived in Ruidoso. In the course of the summer he lost fifteen pounds. He had companions. Jimmy Grimes, his assistant, his exercise boy, had made the trip with him. Wayne Laughlin, the feed salesman, who had retired, joined them there. Jimmy walked slowly as a result of polio. If Calcutta Deck hit it big, it was Smith\x{2019}s intention to use part of the winnings to pay for an operation for Jimmy. Money would go also to a crippled-children\x{2019}s hospital in Little Rock. All summer long, Smith never left Ruidoso, was never more than five or ten minutes away from his horse, with one exception, a short tour of the reservation of the Mescalero Apache.",

            "The horse had a radio down in the barn and liked listening to it. He liked hard rock and country-and-Western. He liked the <<six-o\x{2019}clock|6>> news. He was a neat horse. His droppings
always landed in the same place in the stall, making it easy for Bill and his pitchfork. Bill walked Deck by hand, in a small oval outside the stall, or had Jimmy lead him with the pony; he never put the horse on a walker. Walkers were invented to reduce the high cost of grooms. A walker is a mechanized device that has four cantilevered steel arms, lead ropes attached, leading four horses in a circle. Many dozens of them were spaced among the barns. Horses have on rare occasions been electrocuted by walkers, which are powered by electric motors that gently coax the horses to move. Horses have tried to bolt away from walkers and have broken their necks.",

            "Larry Wilson, Deck\x{2019}s jockey, turned up shivering at the barn one morning at <<five-thirty|5b>>. The temperature was fifty. Deck was going to go out on the track for a blow. Smith said, \x{201c}It\x{2019}s colder than a well digger\x{2019}s butt. Look at Larry, there\x{2014}hair standing up on his arms like the bristles on a hog.\x{201d} Larry was unusually tall for a jockey, blond, slender, fine-featured. He was thirty-one and was from Kansas, and had been riding quarter-horse races since he was sixteen. In the early-morning light, Wayne and Bill watched Deck gallop, Larry clinging for\x{2014}if nothing else\x{2014}warmth.",

            "Bobby Adair flew in for the All-American on the eve of the race. He had been racing in California. He travelled a lot, as the best of jockeys will, coining money. Ten per cent of a race was his, and if he won this one he was going to get thirty-three thousand dollars. Like an airline captain, he would not have a drink with his dinner tonight, for he was flying tomorrow. \x{201c}Having a drink the night before could slow a person down,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}And I sure don\x{2019}t want that He would turn out his light at <<eleven|9c:1>> and try to sleep for twelve hours, if possible, but such a feat was unlikely, because the race meant too much to him and lately he had not been sleeping well. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s difficult
to explain the feeling a rider has about a race like this,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s money, but it\x{2019}s prestige, too.\x{201d} For much of a decade, Adair had been the established leader among quarter-horse jockeys. He had won hundreds of thousands of dollars and almost every big race there was, but never an All-American. Four times before, he had been in the All-American final. He had lost by a neck in \x{2018}71, by part of a nose in \x{2019}66. He had run fifth in \x{2018}70 and ninth in \x{2019}67. He had long been in a position to pick the horse he would ride. Any owner who got him was lucky. He was a student mainly of bloodlines, but when he looked over a colt or a filly he also took into account the racing conformation. His horse this year was Coca\x{2019}s Kid, a filly that had previously run seven times, winning five, placing twice. Her time in the All-American trials\x{2014}running under Adair\x{2014}had been the best among the two hundred and seven horses. Sired by a Thoroughbred, Coca\x{2019}s Kid was a California horse. Her owner, a medical doctor named Edward Allred, had paid the penalty fifteen thousand dollars to bring the horse late into the eligible field. The Doctor\x{2019}s specialty was human abortion\x{2014}\x{201d}a hundred a day, the biggest in California\x{201c}\x{2014}and the jockey helped him invest the proceeds. The two sat side by side at yearling sales. Of late, the Doctor had become nervous, upset, cranky, and irritable, Adair said, and so had he. The pressure of this big race was so great. \x{201c}The horse, though\x{2014}she is like a child\x{2019}s pony, a nice, quiet filly. But she\x{2019}s high-strung, too. She changes into a bomb on the track. The farther she goes, the faster she gets. If others are in front of me for a while tomorrow, I don\x{2019}t feel I should panic.\x{201d}",

            "The All-American was the twelfth race of the day and the last of the summer, run in the late afternoon. At <<five in the morning|9a>>, while Bill Smith was having his breakfast biscuits, he said, \x{201c}I went to bed at <<ten-thirty|5b>> last night, and I slept awful good until <<one-thirty|9c:1>>. I was up at <<fifteen to two|10>>.\x{201d} He had not slept beyond <<three-thirty|5k:1>> for more than a week. Now, this morning, he had been patient for an hour and then had awakened everyone else at <<two-forty-five|5b>>-his wife and daughter, who had joined him for the finish, his friend Wayne, a few others from Arkansas. He went down to the barn before dawn and fed Deck his usual grain, but only about two pounds. Water would stop at <<noon|13>>\x{2014}a sip or two, no more, after that. The night before, worried about sabotage, he had written the horse\x{2019}s name in huge letters on the stall-front wall over an arrow that pointed to another horse.",

Jim Grimes cleaned each foot with a steel brush, then covered the foot with Absorbine Hooflex hoof grease. The radio was turned up high\x{2014}many banjos and guitars. The horse stood still. Jim and Bill brushed his forehead, combed his mane, and gently rubbed his whole body, like two men in a driveway on a Sunday polishing a car. Four-thirty\x{2014}another sip of water.",
