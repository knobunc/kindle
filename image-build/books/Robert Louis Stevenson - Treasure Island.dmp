He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge old tattered seacloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed. I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure. He stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd sing-song, addressed the air in front of him. \x{201c}Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country, England\x{2014}and God bless King George!\x{2014}where or in what part of this country he may now be?\x{201d}",
