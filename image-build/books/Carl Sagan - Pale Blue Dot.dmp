The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood. We invest far-off places with a certain romance. This appeal, I suspect, has been meticulously crafted by natural selection as an essential element in our survival. Long summers, mild winters, rich harvests, plentiful game\x{2014}none of them lasts forever. It is beyond our powers to predict the future. Catastrophic events have a way of sneaking up on us, of catching us unaware.

I examined the boulders and sand dunes, the sky red even at <<high noon|13>>, the ancient river valleys, the soaring volcanic mountains, the fierce wind erosion, the laminated polar terrain, the two dark potato-shaped moons. But there was no life\x{2014}not a cricket or a blade of grass, or even, so far as we can tell for sure, a microbe. These worlds have not been graced, as ours has, by life.

They're named after characters in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest, and in Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. Two of them were found by Herschel himself. The innermost of the five, Miranda, was discovered as recently as 1948, by my teacher G. P. Kuiper.[****]
I remember how great an achievement the discovery of a new moon of Uranus was considered back then. The near-infrared light reflected by all five moons subsequently revealed the spectral signature of ordinary water ice on their Surfaces. And no wonder\x{2014}Uranus is so far from the Sun that it is no brighter there at <<noontime|13>> than it is after sunset on Earth. The temperatures are frigid. Any water must be frozen.",

In 1994 the predicted mutual gravitational interactions of these planets were confirmed by Wolszczan from a study of timing residuals at the microsecond level over the intervening years. The evidence that these are truly new planets and not starquakes on the neutron star surface (or something) is now overwhelming\x{2014}or, as Wolszczan put it, \"irrefutable\"; a new solar system is \"unambiguously identified.\" Unlike all the other techniques, the pulsar timing method makes close-in terrestrial planets comparatively easy and more distant Jovian planets comparatively difficult to detect.",

Since the violet and blue waves are scattered even more during their now-longer path through the air than when the Sun is overhead, what we see when we look toward the Sun is the residue\x{2014}the waves of sunlight that are hardly scattered away at all, especially the oranges and reds. A blue sky makes a red sunset.

We have submitted such a program to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. It is currently under consideration.FLOOD:

When President Kennedy formulated the Apollo program, the Defense Department had a slew of space projects under development\x{2014}ways of carrying military personnel up into space, means of conveying them around the Earth, robot weapons on orbiting platforms intended to shoot down satellites and ballistic missiles of other nations. Apollo supplanted these programs. They never reached operational status.

The logistical requirements, he wrote, "are no greater than those for a minor military operation extending over a limited theater of war." He meant to "explode once and for all the theory of the solitary space rocket and its little band of bold interplanetary adventurers," and appealed to Columbus\' three ships without which "history tends to prove that he might never have returned to Spanish shores."

They are much less ambitious than yon Braun\'s, typically calling for one or two spacecraft crewed by <<three to eight|10a:0>> astronauts, with another robotic cargo ship or two.
