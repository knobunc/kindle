By then it was dark out: well, I think we\x{2019}d be better off leaving in the morning. Fine, so they spent the night. On Sunday morning they packed all the things they had unpacked the night before: bananas, eggs, the primus stove, whatever else it may have been. Then everything was ready, but it always turned out that one of them had a flat tyre. So they would carry the bike back upstairs and fix the flat on the balcony. My mother, she just let them muddle about. <<Around noontime|13>> they were finished: well then, stay and have a sandwich. The bananas, bread, eggs and primus stove\x{2014}they always packed that on top, of course\x{2014}were all unpacked again. And <<around one thirty|9:1>> they finally cycled off. First they would go to Blaricum. They had a grandmother living there, a sweet woman. They would arrive late in the afternoon\x{2014}because they\x{2019}d stopped for a rest somewhere\x{2014}and stay for dinner. You know what, they would say then, it\x{2019}s too late to go on now. Grandma, they said then, we\x{2019}re going to put up the tent back there. Behind the house was a little stand of trees, I should have said that before. The grandmother\x{2014}she died a few years back\x{2014}couldn\x{2019}t stand the thought, of course: sleeping in a tent! She would say: no, don\x{2019}t sleep in one of those things, you\x{2019}ll catch your death of cold. She made beds for them on the floor and they slept there in the house. The next morning, they got up none too early. Then they would go into conclave. With big maps. They could go here, they could go there. A whole itinerary.

The next morning it was raining. A fine drizzle, but enough to keep them from leaving. They stayed inside. Their grandmother was pleased as punch, of course, simply to have the grandchildren, and they sat around all day, just talking. When the weather was bad they couldn\x{2019}t leave, and when the weather was good they couldn\x{2019}t either, because it could always take a turn for the worse.\x{201d}",

You just happen to have, as I have noticed, limited intellectual faculties. Must one keep silent about that?\x{201d} He suddenly felt himself tiring. \x{201c}What venom, what misery,\x{201d} he thought. \x{201c}I wish you a great deal of success,\x{201d} he went on. \x{201c}There are people without personality who go through life with surprising ease.\x{201d} No one spoke a word. He turned to Jaap and asked quietly: \x{201c}Now that we\x{2019}re on the subject; is one allowed to perform a funeral on one\x{2019}s own? I mean: if you don\x{2019}t have much money to spend, or if you consider it a waste of resources, are you allowed to transport a corpse yourself, on a handcart for example, to the cemetery? And dig the grave yourself?\x{201d} \x{201c}I believe so,\x{201d} Jaap replied. \x{201c}I believe that if the interment itself is in accordance with the law, you may transport the dead person yourself. Acquaintances of ours took their child to the cemetery on the back of the bicycle. The coffin on the carrier. And they dug the hole themselves.\x{201d} \x{201c}Excellent,\x{201d} Frits said. \x{201c}Look, the doors are open.\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}On the evening of this day, before darkness falls,\x{201d} a calm, mellow voice said slowly, \x{201c}we would like to once more enter into the presence of\x{2014}\x{201d} Frits ran through the channels. \x{201c}\x{2014}have arrived now at the final musical course of our banquet of cheerful New Year\x{2019}s melodies,\x{201d} an announcer said. \x{201c}You are hearing the Bobbing Nightingales with\x{2026} \x{2018}Sunny Boy\x{2019}.\x{201d} \x{201c}Is there really nothing else on?\x{201d} his father asked once the music started. \x{201c}This is Brussels,\x{201d} Frits said, \x{201c}we could try Hilversum One.\x{201d} He turned the knob to the left. \x{201c}Here we go,\x{201d} he said. They heard the sound of shuffling feet in a cavernous space. \x{201c}Probably another church,\x{201d} his mother said. An organ began playing softly. After a few bars the congregation joined in. \x{201c}Hark, hark,\x{201d} Frits said to himself, \x{201c}hours, days, months, years.\x{201d} \x{201c}Listen to that,\x{201d} he said aloud, \x{201c}hours, days, months, years.\x{201d} \x{201c}Hours, days, months, years,\x{201d} he repeated to himself, \x{201c}hours, days, months, years.\x{201d} He turned up the volume. \x{201c}Can\x{2019}t you turn that down a little?\x{201d} his father asked. \x{201c}No,\x{201d} Frits replied, \x{201c}this needs to be loud. Leave it like this, just the way it is.\x{201d} His heart was pounding. \x{201c}Hours, days, months, years,\x{201d} he said to himself. \x{201c}This is the evening. This is the night. It is New Year\x{2019}s Eve. In a little over twenty-eight minutes it will be <<midnight|13>>. I still have twenty-eight minutes. I must collect my thoughts. I must be finished thinking when <<twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>> strikes.\x{201d} He looked at his father. \x{201c}Help those who are oppressed and imagine themselves abandoned in this world,\x{201d} he thought. \x{201c}Old fart.\x{201d}",

            "His father slid his legs off the divan and sat on the edge. \x{201c}When I was little,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}when summer came, my father and a few other men would go out catching finches. That was a real occasion.\x{201d} He scratched his chin, broke wind and went on: \x{201c}They would go out on Saturday evening and wouldn\x{2019}t come back till Sunday morning, <<around nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>. With a whole heap of finches. They sold them.\x{201d}",

A little over three minutes.\x{201d} He pulled his chair over to the radio and began running through the channels. \x{201c}\x{2014}we bring you \x{2018}The Policeman\x{2019}s Holiday\x{2019},\x{201d} a voice said. \x{201c}After that there will be a pause of about thirty seconds. You will hear the seconds ticking away; at ten seconds <<before midnight|13>> you will hear the sound we announcers know so well, signalling the full hour: a brief, clear tick.\x{201d}",
