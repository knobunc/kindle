Legler experienced the shock wave first, about three seconds before Boyle; both men reported that objects were thrown in an easterly direction\x{2014}though at the Farallon Observatory a stone weighing a hundred pounds was moved six inches just to the west of south, and it was rotated, very slightly, in a counterclockwise direction.

At <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> or so a stiff sea breeze sprang up, driving away the clouds that had dulled a hitherto dreary day. A westering sun could at last be seen, inching its way down behind the Golden Gate, dimming the rocks at Land\x{2019}s End and Point Bonita, and making the Farallon Islands a misty silhouette on the Pacific horizon. This dusk had turned out to be a pretty one, a fitting finale to yet one more Californian day rolling to its contented close.",

Everyone seemed to be grumbling that the weather had been poor for so long: It was the tail end of an unusually damp chilly winter, and for most of this April day clouds hung over the hills, replaced later by a cold Pacific fog.
