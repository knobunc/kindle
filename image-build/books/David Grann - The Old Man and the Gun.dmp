            "Wroblewski read the various statements that had been given to the local police. The most revealing was from Janiszewski\x{2019}s mother, who had worked as a bookkeeper in his advertising firm. On the day that her son disappeared, she stated, a man had called the office at <<around 9:30 A.M.|2a>>, looking for him. The caller made an urgent request. \x{201c}Could you make three signs, quite big ones, and the third one as big as a billboard?\x{201d} he asked. When she inquired further, he said, \x{201c}I will not talk to you about this,\x{201d} demanding again to speak to her son. She explained that he was out of the office, but she gave the caller Janiszewski\x{2019}s cell-phone number. The man hung up. He had not identified himself, and Janiszewski\x{2019}s mother had not recognized his voice, though she thought that he sounded \x{201c}professional.\x{201d} During the conversation, she had heard noise in the background, a dull roar. Later, when her son showed up at the office, she asked him if the customer had called, and Janiszewski replied that they had arranged to meet that afternoon. According to a receptionist in the building, who was the last known person to see Janiszewski alive, he departed the office at <<around four o\x{2019}clock|6>>. He left his car, a Peugeot, in the parking lot, which his family said was very unusual: although he often met with customers away from the office, he habitually took his car.",

He also noticed signs of mental distress. At one point, Fr\x{e9}d\x{e9}ric told his grandparents that he had been molested by a neighbor, though nobody in the tightly knit village investigated the allegation. In one of his comic strips, Fr\x{e9}d\x{e9}ric depicted himself drowning in a river. He increasingly misbehaved, acting out in class and stealing from neighbors. At <<twelve|9e>>, he was sent to live at Les Gr\x{e9}zilli\x{e8}res, a private facility for juveniles, in Nantes.",

            "Nicholas\x{2019}s mother, Beverly, got on the phone. A tough, heavyset woman with a broad face and dyed-brown hair, she worked the graveyard shift at a Dunkin\x{2019} Donuts in San Antonio seven nights a week. She had never married Nicholas\x{2019}s father and had raised Nicholas with her two older children, Carey and Jason. (She was divorced from Carey and Jason\x{2019}s father, though she still used her married name, Dollarhide.) A heroin addict, she had struggled during Nicholas\x{2019}s youth to get off drugs. After he disappeared, she had begun to use heroin again and was now addicted to methadone. Despite these difficulties, Carey says, Beverly was not a bad mother: \x{201c}She was maybe the most functioning drug addict. We had nice things, a nice place, never went without food.\x{201d} Perhaps compensating for the instability in her life, Beverly fanatically followed a routine: working at the doughnut shop from <<10 P.M.|5>> to <<5 A.M.|5>>, then stopping at the Make My Day Lounge to shoot pool and have a few beers, before going home to sleep. She had a hardness about her, with a cigarette-roughened voice, but people who know her also spoke to me of her kindness. After her night shift, she delivered any leftover doughnuts to a homeless shelter.",
