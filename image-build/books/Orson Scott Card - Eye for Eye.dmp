            'I turned to look at her. She was older, <<about twenty-five|9:0>> maybe, and her face looked kind of sweet. She was dressed nice enough that I could tell it wasn\'t cause she was poor that she didn\'t have bus fare. She also didn\'t take her hand off my knee, which made me nervous, because the bad thing I do is a lot stronger when I\'m actually touching a person, and so I mostly don\'t touch folks and I don\'t feel safe when they touch me. The fastest I ever killed a man was when he felt me up in a bathroom at a rest stop on I-85. He was coughing blood when I left that place, I really tore him up that time, I still have nightmares about him gasping for breath there with his hand on me.',

            '"<<Fifteen|9k:0>>, " she says. "Almost twice your age. But that don\'t mean nothing." Or I guess she actually said, "That doesn\'t mean nothing," or probably, "That doesn\'t mean anything." She talks better than I do but I can\'t always remember the fancy way. "That doesn\'t mean a thing," she says. "You\'ll go to your folks, and you can bet they\'ll have some pretty little girl waiting for you, and she\'ll know how to do it much better than me, she\'ll turn you on so your pants unzip themselves, cause that\'s what they want most from you. They want your babies. As many as they can get, because you\'re the strongest they\'ve produced in all the years since Grandpa Jake realized that the cursing power went father to son, mother to daughter, and that he could breed for it like you breed dogs or horses. They\'ll breed you like a stud, but then when they find out that you don\'t like killing people and you don\'t want to play along and you aren\'t going to take orders from whoever\'s in charge there now, they\'ll kill you. That\'s why I came to warn you. We could feel them just starting to call you. We knew it was time. And I came to warn you."',

They must let their kids play till they get wore out and drop down and fall asleep by themselves. It came to me that maybe I wasn\'t so bad off growing up in an orphanage. At least I knew manners and didn\'t whip it out and pee right in front of company, the way one little boy did, just looking at me while I got out of the car, whizzing away like he wasn\'t doing nothing strange. Like a dog marking trees. He needed to so he done it. If I ever did that at the Children\'s Home they\'d\'ve slapped me silly.',
