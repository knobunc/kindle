The robe that Aithor had given me was of little help, since we demons do not have a source of internal heat like the higher animals of the Prime Plane. Hence our bodies cool down to the temperature of the ambient air, and our activity slows proportionately. The first two nights, I could thaw myself out enough by my campfire to carry me through the following day; but then I found that I needs must stop at <<midday|13>>, build a fire, and warm myself then as well.',

The man\x{2019}s garments would furnish me with some insulation against extremes of temperature, for the <<midday|13>> heat of the steppe nearly prostrated me and the cold of <<midnight|13>> froze me almost to immobility. I therefore adopted the man\x{2019}s fur hat, sheepskin coat, and felt boots. The trousers I gave up because of the discomfort of cramming my tail into them.
