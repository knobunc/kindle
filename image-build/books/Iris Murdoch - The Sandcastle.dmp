hundred guineas!\x{2019} said Mor\x{2019}s wife. \x{2018}Well I never!\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s the market price,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}You could articulate more distinctly,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}if you took that rather
damp-looking cigarette out of your mouth.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I said it\x{2019}s the market price!\x{2019} said Mor. He threw his cigarette away.


\x{2018}Bledyard would have done it for nothing,\x{2019} said Nan.


\x{2018}Bledyard is mad,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}and thinks portrait painting is wicked.


\x{2018}If you ask me, it\x{2019}s you and the school Governors that are mad,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}You
must have money to burn. First all that flood-lighting, and then this.
Flood-lighting! As if it wasn\x{2019}t bad enough to have to see the school during the
day!\x{2019}


\x{2018}Shall we wait lunch for Felicity?\x{2019} asked Mor.


\x{2018}No, of course not,\x{2019} said Nan. She always sulks when she comes home. She
wouldn\x{2019}t want to eat anyway.\x{2018} Felicity was their daughter. She was expected
home that day from boarding school, where an outbreak of measles had brought
the term to an early conclusion.


They seated themselves at the table at opposite ends. The dining-room was tiny.
The furniture was large and glossy. The casement windows were open as wide as
they could go upon the hot dry afternoon. They revealed a short front garden
and a hedge of golden privet curling limply in the fierce heat. Beyond the
garden lay the road where the neat semi-detached houses faced each other like
mirror images. The housing estate was a recent one, modem in design and very
solidly built. Above the red-tiled roofs, and over the drooping foliage of the
trees there rose high into the soft midsummer haze the neo-Gothic tower of St
Bride\x{2019}s school where Mor was a housemaster. It was a cold lunch.


\x{2018}Water?\x{2019} said Nan. She poured it from a blue-and-white porcelain jug. Mor
tilted his chair to select his favourite from the row of sauce bottles on the
sideboard. One advantage of the dining-room was that everything was within
reach.


\x{2018}Is Donald coming in this evening to see Felicity?\x{2019} asked Nan. Donald was their
son, who was now in the Sixth Form at St Bride\x{2019}s.


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s taking junior prep,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s taking junior prep!\x{2019} said Nan, imitating. \x{2018}You could have got him off
taking junior prep! I never met such a pair of social cowards. You never want
to do anything that might draw attention to you. You haven\x{2019}t taken a vow of
obedience to St Bride\x{2019}s.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You know Don hates privileges,\x{2019} said Mor briefly. This was one of the points
from which arguments began. He jabbed unenthusiastically at his meat. \x{2018}I wish
Felicity would come.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ve got a bone to pick with Don,\x{2019} said Nan.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t nag him about the climbing,\x{2019} said Mor. Donald wanted to go on a climbing
holiday. His parents were opposed to this.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t use that word at me!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Someone\x{2019}s got to take some responsibility
for what the children do.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, leave it till after his exam,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}He\x{2019}s worried enough.\x{2019} Donald
was shortly to sit for a Cambridge College entrance examination in chemistry.


\x{2018}If we leave it,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}we 11 find it\x{2019}s been fixed. Don told me it was all
off. But Mrs Prewett said yesterday they were still discussing it. Your
children seem to make it a general rule to lie to their parents for all your
talk about truth.\x{2019}


Although he now held no religious views, Mor had been brought up as a
Methodist. He believed profoundly in complete truthfulness as the basis and
condition of all virtue. It grieved him to find that his children were almost
totally indifferent to this requirement. He pushed his plate aside.


\x{2018}Aren\x{2019}t you going to eat that?\x{2019} said Nan. Do you mind if I do?\x{2018} She reached
across a predatory fork and took the meat from Mor\x{2019}s plate.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s too hot to eat,\x{2019} said Mor. He looked out of the window. The tower of the
school was idling in the heat, swaying a little in the cracked air. From the
arterial road near by came the dull murmur, never stilled by day, of the stream
of traffic now half-way between London and the coast. In the heat of the
afternoon it sounded like insects buzzing in a wood. Time was longer, longer,
longer in the summer.


\x{2018}You remember how poor Liffey used to hate this hot weather,\x{2019} said Mor.


Liffey had been their dog, a golden retriever, who was killed two years ago on
the main road. This animal had formed the bond between Mor and Nan which their
children had been unable to form. Half unconsciously, whenever Mor wanted to
placate his wife he said something about Liffey.


Nan\x{2019}s face at once grew gentler. \x{2018}Poor thing!\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}She used to stagger
about the lawn following a little piece of shadow. And her long tongue hanging
out.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I wonder how much longer the heat wave will last,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}In other countries,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}they just have the summertime. We have to talk
about heat waves. It\x{2019}s dreary.\x{2019}


Mor was silent while Nan finished her plate. He began to have a soporific
feeling of conjugal boredom. He stretched and yawned and fell to examining a
stain upon the tablecloth. \x{2018}You haven\x{2019}t forgotten we\x{2019}re dining with Demoyte
tonight?\x{2019}


Demoyte was the former headmaster of St Bride\x{2019}s, now retired, but still living in
his large house near to the school. The Mors had continued their custom of
dining with him regularly. The sum of five hundred guineas, which had so much
scandalized Nan, was to be paid for a portrait of him which the school
Governors had recently commissioned.


\x{2018}Oh, damn, I had forgotten,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Oh, what a blasted bore! I\x{2019}ll ring up
and say I\x{2019}m ill.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You won\x{2019}t,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}You\x{2019}ll enjoy it when you\x{2019}re there.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You always make that futile remark,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}and I never do. Will there be
company?\x{2019} Nan hated company. Mor liked it.


\x{2018}There\x{2019}ll be the portrait painter,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I gather she arrived yesterday.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I read about her in the local rag,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}She has some pathetically comic
name.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Rain Carter,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Rain Carter!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Cor Lumme! The daughter of Sidney Carter. At least
he\x{2019}s a good painter. Anyway, he\x{2019}s famous. If you wanted to waste money, why
didn\x{2019}t you ask him?\x{2019}


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s dead,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}He died early this year. His daughter\x{2019}s supposed to be
good too.\x{2019}


\x{2018}She\x{2019}d better be, at that price,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}I suppose I\x{2019}ll have to dress.
She\x{2019}s sure to be all flossied up. She lives in France. Oh dear! Where is she
staying, by the way? The Saracen\x{2019}s Head?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}Miss Carter is staying at Demoyte\x{2019}s house. She wants to study
his character and background before she starts the picture. She\x{2019}s very academic
about it.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Demoyte will be delighted, the old goat!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}But what a line! I like
\x{201c}academic\x{201d}!\x{2019}


Mor hated Nan\x{2019}s mockery, even when it was not directed against him. He had once
imagined that she mocked others merely in order to protect herself. But as time
went on he found it harder to believe that Nan was vulnerable. He decided that
it was he who needed the consolation of thinking her so.


\x{2018}As you haven\x{2019}t met the girl,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}why are you being so spiteful?\x{2019}


\x{2018}What sort of question is that?\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Do you expect me to answer it?\x{2019}


They looked at each other. Mor turned away his eyes. He suffered deeply from
the discovery that his wife was the stronger. He told himself that her strength
sprang only from obstinate and merciless unreason; but to think this did not
save him either from suffering coercion or from feeling resentment. He could
not now make his knowledge of her into love, he could not even make it into indifference.
In the heart of him he was deeply compelled. He was forced. And he was
continually offended. The early years of their marriage had been happy enough.
At that time he and Nan had talked about nothing but themselves. When this
subject failed, however, they had been unable to find another - and one day Mor
made the discovery that he was tied for life to a being who could change, who
could withdraw herself from him and become independent. On that day Mor had
renewed his marriage vows.


\x{2018}Sorry,\x{2019} said Mor. He had made it a rule to apologize, whether or not he
thought himself in the wrong. Nan was prepared to sulk for days. He was always
the one who crawled back. Her strength was endless.


\x{2018}In fact,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}according to Mr Everard she\x{2019}s a very shy, naive girl. She
led quite a cloistered life with her father.\x{2019} The Reverend Giles Everard was
the present headmaster of St Bride\x{2019}s, generally known as the Revvy Evvy.


\x{2018}Quite cloistered!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}In France! As for Evvy\x{2019}s judgement, he casts
down his eyes like a milkmaid if he meets a member of the other sex. Still, if
we have this girl at dinner we shall at least escape Miss Handforth, on whom
you dote so!\x{2019} Miss Handforth was Mr Demoyte\x{2019}s housekeeper, an old enemy of Nan.


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t dote on Handy,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but at least she\x{2019}s cheerful, and she\x{2019}s good
for Demoyte.\x{2019}


\x{2018}She isn\x{2019}t cheerful,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}She just has a loud voice - and she expects to
be in the conversation even when she\x{2019}s waiting at table. I can\x{2019}t stand that.
There\x{2019}s no point in having servants if you abandon the conventions. There\x{2019}s
ice-cream to follow. Will you have some? No?\x{2019}


\x{2018}She keeps Demoyte\x{2019}s spirits up,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}He says it\x{2019}s impossible to think
about oneself when there\x{2019}s so much noise going on.\x{2019}


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s a morbid old man,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s pathetic.\x{2019}


Mor loved Demoyte. \x{2018}I wish Felicity would come,\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t keep saying that, darling,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Can I have your ice-cream spoon?
I\x{2019}ve used mine to take the gravy off the cloth.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I think I ought to go into school,\x{2019} said Mor, looking at his watch.


\x{2018}Lunch isn\x{2019}t over,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}just because you\x{2019}ve finished eating. And
the <<two-fifteen|5k:1>> bell hasn\x{2019}t rung yet. Don\x{2019}t forget we must talk to Felicity
about her future.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Must we?\x{2019} said Mor. This was the sort of provocative reply which he found it
very hard to check, and by which Nan was unfailingly provoked. A recurring
pattern. He was to blame.


\x{2018}Why do you say \x{201c}must we?\x{201d} in that peculiar tone of voice?\x{2019} said Nan. She had a
knack of uttering such a question in a way which forced Mor to answer her.


\x{2018}Because I don\x{2019}t know what I think about it,\x{2019} said Mor. He felt a cold
sensation which generally preluded his becoming angry.


\x{2018}Well, I know what I think about it,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Our finances and her talents
don\x{2019}t leave us much choice, do they?\x{2019} She looked directly at Mor. Again it was
impossible not to reply.


\x{2018}I suggest we wait a while,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Felicity doesn\x{2019}t know her own mind
yet.\x{2019} He knew that Nan could go on in this tone for hours and keep quite calm.
Arguments would not help him. His only ultimate defence was anger.


\x{2018}You always pretend people don\x{2019}t know what they want when they don\x{2019}t want what
you want,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}You are funny, Bill. Felicity certainly wants to leave
school. And if she\x{2019}s to start on that typing course next year we ought to put
her name down now.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t want Felicity to be a typist,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Why not?\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}She could have a good career. She could be secretary to
some interesting man.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t want her to be secretary to some interesting man,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}I want her
to be an interesting woman and have someone else be her secretary.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You live in a dream world, Bill,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Neither of your children are
clever, and you\x{2019}ve already caused them both enough unhappiness by pretending
that they are. You\x{2019}ve bullied Don into taking the College exam and you ought to
be satisfied with that. If you\x{2019}d take our marriage more seriously you\x{2019}d try to
be a bit more of a realist. You must take some responsibility for the children.
I know you have all sorts of fantasies about yourself. But at least try to be
realistic about them.\x{2019}


Mor winced. If there was one thing he hated to hear about, it was \x{2018}our
marriage\x{2019}. This entity was always mentioned in connexion with some particularly
dreary project which Nan was trying to persuade him to be unavoidably
necessary. He made an effort. \x{2018}You may be right,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}but I still think
we ought to wait.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I know I\x{2019}m right,\x{2019} said Nan.


The phrase found an echo in Mor\x{2019}s mind. He was perpetually aware of the danger
of becoming too dogmatic himself in opposition to Nan\x{2019}s dogmatism. He tried to
change the subject. \x{2018}I wonder if Felicity will mind your having changed her
room round?\x{2019}


Nan liked moving the furniture about. She kept the rooms in a continual state
of upheaval in which nothing was respected, neither one\x{2019}s belongings nor the
way one chose to arrange them, and thereby satisfied, or so it seemed to Mor,
her desire to feel that all the things in the house were her things. He had
become accustomed, after many years, to the perpetual flux, but he hated the
way in which it hurt the children.


Nan refused to leave her point. \x{2018}You\x{2019}re so simple-minded, Bill. You think that
reactionaries consider all women to be stupid, and so progressives must
consider all women to be clever! I\x{2019}ve got no time for that sort of sentimental
feminism. Your dear Mr Everard has got it too. Did I tell you that he wants me
to make an after-dinner speech at that idiotic dinner?\x{2019} There was to be a
ceremonial dinner, at a date not yet arranged, to honour the presentation to the
school of the portrait of Mr Demoyte.


\x{2018}Yes, he told me,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I hope you will. You\x{2019}d make a good speech.\x{2019}


No, I wouldn\x{2019}t,\x{2018} said Nan. \x{2019}I\x{2019}d just make myself and you look ridiculous. I
told Evvy so. He really is an ass. Men of his generation have such romantic
ideas about female emancipation. But if his idea of the free society is women
making after-dinner speeches, he\x{2019}d better find someone else to cooperate with.
He told me to \x{201c}think it over\x{201d}. I just laughed at him. He\x{2019}s pathetic.\x{2018}


\x{2018}You ought to try,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}You complain about the narrowness of your life,
and yet you never take the chance to do anything new or different.\x{2019}


\x{2018}If you think my life would be made any less, as you charmingly put it,
\x{201c}narrow\x{201d} by my making a fool of myself at that stupid dinner,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}I
really cannot imagine what conception you have of me at all.\x{2019} The <<two-fifteen|5k:1>>
bell for the first afternoon lesson could be heard ringing beyond the trees.


\x{2018}I wish you hadn\x{2019}t stopped your German,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}You haven\x{2019}t done any for
months, have you?\x{2019}


Mor had hoped to be able to educate his wife. He had always known that she was
intelligent. He had imagined that she would turn out to be talented. The house
was littered with the discarded paraphernalia of subjects in which he had hoped
to interest her: French grammars, German grammars, books of history and
biography, paints, even a guitar on which she had strummed a while but never
learnt to play. It irritated Mor that his wife should combine a grievance about
her frustrated gifts with a lack of any attempt to concentrate. She
deliberately related herself to the world through him only and then disliked
him for it. She had few friends, and no occupations other than housework.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t go out of your way to annoy me,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Haven\x{2019}t you got a lesson at
<<two-fifteen|5b>>?\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s a free period,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but I ought to go and do some correcting. Is
that Felicity?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No, it\x{2019}s the milkman,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}I suppose you\x{2019}d like some coffee?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, maybe,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t have it if you\x{2019}re indifferent,\x{2019} said Nan; \x{2018}it\x{2019}s expensive enough. In
fact, you weren\x{2019}t really thinking about my German. You\x{2019}re still stuffed up with
those dreams that Tim Burke put into you. You imagine that it\x{2019}s only my
narrowmindedness that stops you from being Prime Minister!\x{2019}


Tim Burke was a goldsmith, and an old friend of the Mor family. He was also the
chairman of the Labour Party in a neighbouring borough, where he had been
trying to persuade Mor to become the local candidate. It was a safe Labour
seat. Mor was deeply interested in the idea.


\x{2018}I wasn\x{2019}t thinking about that,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but you are timid there too.\x{2019} He was
shaken more deeply than he yet liked to admit by his wife\x{2019}s opposition to this
plan. He had not yet decided how to deal with it.


\x{2018}Timid!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}What funny words you use! I\x{2019}m just realistic. I don\x{2019}t want
us both to be exposed to ridicule. My dear, I know, it\x{2019}s attractive, London and
so on, but in real life terms it means a small salary and colossal expenses and
absolutely no security. You don\x{2019}t realize that one still needs a private income
to be an M.P. You can\x{2019}t have everything, you know. It was your idea to send
Felicity to that expensive school. It was your idea to push Don into going to
Cambridge.\x{2019}


\x{2018}He\x{2019}ll get a county grant,\x{2019} Mor mumbled. He did not want this argument now. He
would reserve his fire.


\x{2018}You know as well as I do,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}that a county grant is a drop in the
ocean. He might have worked with Tim. He might have knocked around the world a
bit. And if he learns anything at Cambridge except how to imitate his expensive
friends \x{2014} \x{2019}


\x{2018}He\x{2019}ll do his military service,\x{2019} said Mor. In persuading Donald to work for the
University Mor had won one of his rare victories. He had been paying for it
ever since.


\x{2018}The trouble with you, Bill,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}is that for all your noisy Labour
Party views you\x{2019}re a snob at heart. You want your children to be ladies and
gents. But anyhow, quite apart from the money, you haven\x{2019}t the personality to
be a public man. You\x{2019}d much better get on with writing that school textbook.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ve told you already,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}it\x{2019}s not a textbook.\x{2019} Mor was writing a
book on the nature of political concepts. He was not making very rapid progress
with this work, which had been in existence now for some years. But then he had
so little spare time.


\x{2018}Well, don\x{2019}t get so upset,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}There\x{2019}s nothing to get upset about. If
it\x{2019}s not a textbook, that\x{2019}s a pity. School textbooks make money. And if we
don\x{2019}t get some extra money from somewhere we shall have to draw our horns in
pretty sharply. No more Continental holidays, you know. Even our little trip to
Dorset this year will be practically ruinous, especially if Felicity and I go
down before term ends.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, for Christ\x{2019}s sake, Nan,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}do shut up! Do stop talking about
money!\x{2019} He got up. He ought to have gone into school long ago.


\x{2018}When you speak to me like that, Bill,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}I really wonder why we go
on. I really think it might be better to stop.\x{2019} Nan said this from time to
time, always in the cool, un-excited voice in which she conducted her arguments
with her husband. It was all part of the pattern. So was Mor\x{2019}s reply.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t talk that nonsense, Nan. I\x{2019}m sorry I spoke in that way.\x{2019} It all passed
in a second.


Nan rose, and they began together to clear the table.


There was a sound in the hall. \x{2018}Here\x{2019}s Felicity!\x{2019} said Mor, and pushed quickly
past his wife.


Felicity shut the front door behind her and put her suitcase down at her feet.
Her parents stood looking at her from the door of the dining-room. \x{2018}Welcome
home, dear,\x{2019} said Nan.


\x{2018}Hello,\x{2019} said Felicity. She was fourteen, very thin and straight, and tall for
her age. The skin of her face, which was very white but covered over in summer
with a thick scattering of golden freckles, was drawn tightly over the bridge
of her nose and away from her prominent eyes, giving her a perpetual look of
inquiry and astonishment. She had her mother\x{2019}s eyes, a gleaming blue, but
filled with a hazier and more dreamy light. Nan\x{2019}s hair was a dark blond,
undulating naturally about her head, the ends of it tucked away into a subdued
halo. Felicity\x{2019}s was fairer and straighter, drawn now into a straggling tail
which emerged from under her school hat. In looks, the girl had none of her
father. It was Donald who had inherited Mor\x{2019}s dark and jaggedly curly hair and
his bony face, irregular to ugliness.


Felicity took off her hat and threw it in the direction of the hall table. It
fell on the floor. Nan came forward, picked up her hat, and kissed her on the
brow. \x{2018}Had a good term, dear?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, it was all right,\x{2019} said Felicity.


\x{2018}Hello, old thing, said Mor. He shook her by the shoulder.


\x{2018}Hello, Daddy,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}Is Don here?


\x{2018}He isn\x{2019}t, dear, but he\x{2019}ll come in tomorrow,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Would you like me to
make you lunch, or have you had some?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t want anything to eat,\x{2019} said Felicity. She picked up her suitcases.
\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t bother, Daddy. I\x{2019}ll carry it up.


\x{2018}What are your plans for this evening?\x{2019} said Nan.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ve just arrived, said Felicity. \x{2019}I haven\x{2019}t got any plans.\x{2018}


She began to mount the stairs. Her parents watched her in silence. A moment
later they heard her bedroom door shut with a bang.",

was a fine dear evening. Mor closed the door of the Sixth Form room and escaped
down the corridor with long strides. A subdued din arose behind him. He had
just been giving a lesson to the history specialists of the Classical Sixth.
Donald, who was in the Science Sixth, had of course not been present. It was
now two years since, to Mor\x{2019}s relief, his son\x{2018} had ceased to be his pupil. Mor
taught history, and occasionally Latin, at St Bride\x{2019}s. He enjoyed teaching, and
knew that he did it well. His authority and prestige in the school stood high;
higher, since Demoyte\x{2019}s departure, than that of any other master. Mor was well
aware of this too, and it consoled him more than a little for failures in other
departments of his life.


Now, as he emerged through the glass doors of Main School into the warm
sunshine, a sense of satisfaction filled him, which was partly a feeling of
work well done and partly the anticipation of a pleasant evening. On an
ordinary day there would be the long interval till supper-time to be lived
through, passed in reading, or correcting, or in desultory conversation with
Nan. This was normally the most threadbare part of the day. But this evening
there would be the strong spicy talk of Demoyte and the colour and beauty of
his house. If he hurried, Mor thought, he would be able to have one or two
glasses of sherry with Demoyte before Nan arrived. She made a point of arriving
late, to the perpetual irritation of Handy. Then there would be wine with the
meal. Nan never drank alcohol, and Mor did not usually drink it, partly as a
lingering result of his teetotaller\x{2019}s upbringing and partly for reasons of
economy, but he enjoyed drinking occasionally with Demoyte or Tim Burke, though
he always had an irrational sense of guilt when he did so.


Demoyte lived at a distance of three miles from the school in a fine Georgian
house called Brayling\x{2019}s Close, which he had acquired during his period of
office as Headmaster, and which he had left to the school in his will. He had
crammed it with treasures, especially Oriental rugs and carpets on the subject
of which he was an expert and the author of a small but definitive treatise.
Demoyte was a scholar. For his scholarship Mor, whose talents were speculative
rather than scholarly, admired him without envy; and for his tough honest
obstinate personality and his savage tongue Mor rather loved him: and also
because Demoyte was very partial to Mor. The latter often reflected that if one
were to have him for an enemy Demoyte would present a very unpleasant aspect
indeed. His long period as Headmaster of St Bride\x{2019}s had been punctuated by
violent quarrels with members of the staff, and was still referred to as \x{2018}the
reign of terror\x{2019}. A feeling of security in their job was a luxury which Demoyte
had not had the delicacy to allow to the masters of St Bride\x{2019}s. If the quality
of an individual\x{2019}s teaching declined, that individual would shortly find that
Demoyte was anxious for his departure; and when Demoyte wanted something to
occur it was usually not long before that thing occurred.


Demoyte had not been easy to live with and he had not been easy to get rid of.
He had persuaded the Governors to extend his tenure of power for five years
beyond the statutory retiring age - and when that time was up he had only been
in duced to retire after a storm during which the school Visitor had had to be
called in to arbitrate. Ever since Mor had come to the school, some ten years
ago, he had been Demoyte\x{2019}s lieutenant and right-hand man, the intermediary
between the Head and the staff, first unofficially, and later more officially,
in the capacity of Second Master. In this particular role, Mor was sincere
enough to realize, he had been able to experience the pleasures of absolute
power without remorse of conscience. He had mitigated the tyranny; but he had
also been to a large extent its instrument and had not infrequently enjoyed its
fruits.


Demoyte would have liked Mor to succeed him as Head; but St Bride\x{2019}s was a
Church of England foundation, and at least a nominal faith of an Anglican
variety was required by the Governors in any candidate for the Headship. This
item Mor could not supply; and a storm raised by Demoyte with the purpose of
changing the school statutes on this point, so as to allow Mor to stand, failed
of its object. Demoyte himself, Mor supposed, must originally have conformed to
the requirement; but by the time Mor first met him his orthodoxy had long ago
been worn down into a sort of obstinate gentlemanly conservatism. Under the
Demoyte r\x{e9}gime not much was heard at St Bride\x{2019}s about Christianity, beyond such
rather stereotyped information as was conveyed by the Ancient and Modem Hymnal;
and the boys had to learn about religion, much as they learnt about sex, by
piecing together such references to these blush-provoking topics as they could
discover for themselves in books. What Demoyte cared about was proficiency in
work. This his masters were engaged to produce and sacked for failing to
produce; and during his period of office the yearly bag of College scholarships
by St Bride\x{2019}s rose steadily and surely. As for morality, and such things,
Demoyte took the view that if a boy could look after his Latin prose his character
would look after itself.


Very different was the view taken by Demoyte\x{2019}s successor, the Reverend Giles
Everard, whom Demoyte regarded with unconcealed contempt and always referred to
as \x{2018}poor Evvy\x{2019}. The training of character was what was nearest to Evvy\x{2019}s heart
- and performance in Latin prose he regarded as a secondary matter. His first
innovation had been to alter the school prospectus, which had formerly
reflected Demoyte\x{2019}s predilection for star pupils, in such a way as to suggest
that now St Bride\x{2019}s was concerned, not with selecting and cherishing the
brilliant boy, but with welcoming and bringing to his humbler maturity, such as
it was, the mediocre and even the dim-witted. Demoyte watched these changes
with fury and with scorn.


Nan had never taken to Demoyte. This was partly because Demoyte had never taken
to her, but she would have disliked him, Mor thought, in any case. Nan hated
eccentricity, which she invariably regarded as affectation. She did not, it
seemed to Mor, care to conceive that other people might be profoundly different
from herself. Nan had, moreover, a tendency to be hostile towards unmarried
people of either sex, regarding them as in some way abnormal and menacing; and
in Demoyte the sort of bachelor behaviour which made Nan particularly uneasy
had developed, through age and through the long exercise of tyrannical power,
to the point of outrage. Demoyte was overbearing in conversation and rarely
sacrificed wit to tract. Although he was a Tory by habit and conviction, there
were few institutions which he took for granted. Marriage was certainly not one
of these. In the sacred intimacy of the home Nan was often pleased to refer to
\x{2018}our marriage\x{2019}; but she did not think that this was a subject which, either in
particular or in general, could be discussed or even mentioned in the company
of strangers - and everyone beyond the family hearth was to her a stranger.
Demoyte felt no such delicacy, and would often embarrass Nan by outbursts on
the subject of the married state. \x{2018}A married couple is a dangerous machine!\x{2019} he
would say, wagging a finger and watching to see how Nan was taking it.
\x{2018}Marriage is organized selfishness with the blessing of society. How hardly
shall a married person enter the Kingdom of Heaven!\x{2019} And once, after an
occasion when Mor had sharply defended Nan from one of Demoyte\x{2019}s sarcasms, he
had almost turned the pair of them out of the house, shouting, \x{2018}You two may
have to put up with each other, but I\x{2019}m not bound to put up with either of
you!\x{2019}


After that Mor had had great difficulty in persuading Nan to accompany him to
Demoyte\x{2019}s dinners. But he knew obscurely that if it ever became established
that he went alone, Nan\x{2019}s hostility to Demoyte would take a more active form
and she would seriously endeavour to bring the friendship to an end. As it was,
Nan worked off her spleen on each occasion by making bitter comments to Mor as
they walked home. With these comments Mor would often weakly concur, excusing
his disloyalty to himself on the ground that he was thereby averting a greater
evil. Nan was prepared to tolerate Demoyte on condition that he was judged
finally by Mor and herself in unison; and to placate her Mor was prepared to
allow the judgement to seem final, and to keep his private corrections to
himself.


On this occasion as Mor walked across the asphalt playground in the direction
of the bicycle-sheds, averting his eyes automatically from the windows of
classrooms where lessons were still in progress, he remembered with a small
pang of disappointment that tonight Demoyte would not be alone. Mor would
sometimes cycle over to Brayling\x{2019}s Close in the late evening after supper - but
there was something especially sacred about the short encounters before dinner,
when the glow of Demoyte\x{2019}s drawing-room came as a sharp pleasure after the
recent escape from school. Mor was glad when Demoyte had guests, but he liked
to see the old man alone first, and as he tried to arrive soon <<after
five-thirty|5k:1>> he was usually able to do so. This evening, however, the
portrait-painter woman, Miss Carter, would of course be present. Mor had a
vague curiosity about this young woman. When her father had died some months
ago the newspapers had been filled with obituaries and appreciations of his
work which had contained many references to her. She was supposed to be
talented. Concerning her personal appearance and presence Mor had been able to
obtain only the vaguest account from Mr Everard, who, as Nan had remarked, was
not generally to be trusted in summing up the opposite sex. Mor\x{2019}s thoughts
touched lightly on the girl and then returned to Demoyte.


In spite of the difference in their political views Demoyte had, somewhat to
Mor\x{2019}s surprise, been very much in favour of Tim Burke\x{2019}s plan to make Mor a
Labour Candidate. \x{2018}You won\x{2019}t do us any harm,\x{2019} he told Mor, \x{2018}since whatever else
you\x{2019}ll be doing at Westminster you certainly won\x{2019}t be governing the country -
and you may do yourself some good by getting out of this damned rut. I hate to
see you as poor Evvy\x{2019}s henchman. It\x{2019}s so painfully unnatural.\x{2019} Mor was of
Demoyte\x{2019}s opinion on the latter point. As far as this evening was concerned,
however, Mor was anxious to warn Demoyte not to mention the matter in Nan\x{2019}s
presence. Demoyte\x{2019}s approval would merely increase her opposition to the plan.


The master\x{2019}s bicycle-shed was a wooden structure, much broken down and
overgrown with Virginia creeper, and situated in a gloomy shrubbery which was
known as the masters\x{2019} garden, and which was nominally out of bounds to the
boys. Beside it was a stretch of weedy gravel, connecting by a grassy track
with the main drive, on which stood Mr Everard\x{2019}s new baby Austin and Mr
Prewett\x{2019}s very old enormous Morris. Mor found his bicycle and set out slowly
along the track. He bumped along between the trees, turned on to the loose
gravel of the main drive, until he reached the school gates and the smooth
tarmac surface of the arterial road. Fast cars were rushing in both directions
along the dual carriageway, and it was a little while before Mor could get
across into the other lane. He slipped through at last and began to pedal up
the hill towards the railway bridge. It was a stiff climb. As usual he forced
himself at it with the intention of getting to the top without dismounting. He
gave up the attempt at the usual place. He reached the summit of the bridge and
began to freewheel down the other side.


Now between trees the Close was distantly in sight. At this place on the road
it seemed as if one were deep in the country. The housing estate was
momentarily hidden behind the bridge, and the shopping centre, which lay on a
parallel road on the other side of the fields, had not yet come in sight.
Demoyte\x{2019}s house stood there, stately and pensive as in a print, looking exactly
as it had looked when company had come down in coaches from London, across
heaths infested by highwaymen, to report to their friends in the country what
was Garrick\x{2019}s present role and what the latest saying of the Doctor. Mor waited
again for a gap in the traffic to get back across the road, turned into
Demoyte\x{2019}s drive, and cycled up the untidy avenue of old precarious elm trees.
These trees had long ago been condemned as unsafe, but Demoyte had refused to
have them cut down. \x{2018}Let Evvy do it when I\x{2019}m gone,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}I don\x{2019}t grudge
him that pleasure. He has so few.\x{2019}


The house was long in the front, built of small rose-coloured bricks, and
arching out in two large bow windows. A wide door with a stone pediment faced
the avenue across a square of grass. The main garden lay at the side. Mor
cycled between two pillars and skirted the grass. He left his bicycle leaning
against the wall of what had once been a coach house and made his way on foot
towards the front door. He felt that he was being watched, and looked up to see
Miss Handforth gazing at him out of the window above the door. He waved
cheerfully at her. He was one of Handy\x{2019}s favourites.


Miss Handforth met him in the hall, sweeping round the white curve of the
staircase with a vehemence which made the house shake. She was a stout powerful
middle-aged woman with a face like a lion and a foot like a rhino. She had once
been an elementary school teacher.


\x{2018}Hello,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}How goes it, Handy? How\x{2019}s his Lordship?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No more lazy and troublesome than usual,\x{2019} said Miss Handforth in ringing
tones. \x{2018}You\x{2019}ve arrived early again, but I don\x{2019}t suppose it matters.\x{2019} Handy
never addressed people by their names. She coughed unrestrainedly as she spoke.
\x{2018}I\x{2019}ve got a most awful cold, though how I could have caught it in this
weather\x{2019}s a regular mystery. It must be hay fever, only the hay\x{2019}s in, I don\x{2019}t
know if that makes any difference. If you want to wash, go straight through,
you know the way, the downstairs toilet this time, if you please. The boss is
still getting up from lying down, but Miss Thing is in the drawing-room if you
want to be polite. Otherwise go and knock on the dressing-room door. I must go
and look at the dinner.\x{2019}


Miss Handforth went away, coughing and sneezing, through a green baize door in
the direction of the kitchen. Mor went through to what she called the
downstairs toilet and tried to wash his hands. They were blackened, as usual,
by the ancient rubber grips on the handle-bars. Soap made little impression on
the dirt, although plenty came off on the towel. Mor, who had deduced from Miss
Handforth\x{2019}s tone that she was hostile to Mr Demoyte\x{2019}s other guest, decided that
he would not be, as she put it, polite, and instead he mounted the stairs and
knocked on the door of Demoyte\x{2019}s dressing-room. A growl came from inside.


\x{2018}May I come in, sir?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Demoyte\x{2019}s voice. \x{2018}Go away. You\x{2019}re infernally early. Three minutes
ago I was asleep. Now I have to make a decision about my trousers. I\x{2019}m not
going to receive you in my shift. There\x{2019}s a charming lady down in the
drawing-room.\x{2019}


Mor turned away and went slowly downstairs again. Half thoughtfully he
straightened his tie. As he made for the drawing-room door he saw through a
vista of passages straight into the kitchen; the figure of Handy was discovered
in a listening attitude. Mor made an ambiguous gesture of complicity. Handy
replied with another gesture and a resounding snort. Mor was not sure what she
meant. He went into the drawing-room and closed the door softly behind him.


The room was full of yellow evening light and its three tall windows were wide
open on to the garden. It faced the side of the house, overlooking a long
enclosed lawn which was separated from the front drive by a brick wall. Beyond
the lawn was a thick dark yew hedge cut in the centre by a stone archway
beneath which an iron gate led into a second garden which was invisible from
the windows. This garden consisted of another lawn, with a wide herbaceous
border at either end. Beyond it and at a higher level lay a third garden which
was reached by a flight of stone steps. On either side of the steps were two
clipped holly bushes, and on either side of these a low box hedge which grew on
top of the flower-hung wall which marked the difference of level between the
two gardens. This last one was the rose garden, a triangular strip ending in an
avenue of mulberries which led towards the farthest tapering point of Demoyte\x{2019}s
estate. After that there were taller trees through which in winter were
revealed the red roofs of the housing estate, but which in summer enclosed the
horizon except where at one place their line was broken by the upwardly
pointing finger, just visible from the house, of the neo-Gothic tower of St
Bride\x{2019}s.


The drawing-room was empty. Mor felt some relief. He fingered his tie again,
and sat down quietly in one of the chairs. He loved this room. In his own home,
although there were few ornaments, and such as there were were chosen carefully
by Nan to harmonize with the curtains, no part of it seemed to blend into a
unity. The objects remained separate, their shapes and their colours almost invisible.
Here, on the contrary, although the room was overcrowded and its contents
extremely miscellaneous, all seemed to come together into a whirl of red and
gold wherein each thing, though contributing to the whole, became more itself.
A rich Feraghan carpet covered the floor, almost entirely obscured by equally
splendid rugs which lay edge to edge over its surface. Pieces of furniture
stood about, without plan or pattern, their only obvious intention being to
provide as many smooth surfaces as possible upon which might be placed cups,
bowls, vases, boxes, together with a variety of smaller objects made of ivory,
jade, jet, glass, and amber. Petit-point cushions crowded so thick upon
most of the chairs that it was quite hard to find anywhere to sit down. The
walls were papered in a gold-and-white pattern, but were rarely visible between
the most splendid of the rugs which hung upon them, stretched at various angles
between the floor and the ceiling, and glowing there with silky vitality like
the skins of fabulous animals. Mor half closed his eyes and the forms about him
became hazier and more intense. He let the colours enter into him. He rested.


Then suddenly with a strange shock of alarm he realized that upon a table at
the far end of the room a very small woman was kneeling. He had not noticed her
as he came in, since the colours of her dress faded into the background, and he
had not expected to see her at that point in space. She had her back to him,
and seemed to be examining one of the rugs which hung on the wall behind the
table.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m so sorry!\x{2019} said Mor, jumping us.\x{2018}I didn\x{2019}t see you!\x{2019}


The young woman turned abruptly, tilted the table with her weight, tried to
spring off it, and then fell on the floor. Mor ran forward, but she had
recovered herself before he reached her.


\x{2018}You frightened me,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}I didn\x{2019}t hear you come in.\x{2019}


They looked at each other. Mor saw a very short youthful-looking girl, with
boyishly cut dark hair, and darkly rosy cheeks, wearing a black cotton blouse,
an elaborately flowered red skirt, and a necklace of large red beads; and he
became for an instant acutely aware of what the girl was seeing: a tall
middle-aged schoolmaster, with a twisted face and the grey coming in his hair.


\x{2018}I am Rain Carter,\x{2019} said the girl.


\x{2018}I am William Mor,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m so sorry I alarmed you.\x{2019}


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s quite all right,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I was just looking at this rug.
She spoke in a slightly prim way.


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s one of Mr Demoyte\x{2019}s treasures,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I believe it\x{2019}s a Sh\x{ed}r\x{e1}z.\x{2019} He
thought, how very small she is, and how like a child. Perhaps Evvy was right
after all. Her eyes were dark brown and fugitive, her nose rather broad and
tilted. A not unpleasant face.


It is a Sh\x{ed}r\x{e1}z,\x{2018} said Miss Carter. \x{2019}Do you notice how mysteriously the colours
behave here? Each piece has its own shade, and then there is a sort of surface
colour which the whole rug has which is different, a sort of blush.\x{2018} She spoke
with a pedantic solemnity that Mor found touching and absurd. He found himself
wondering if she could really paint. He stretched out his hand to touch the
rug, and as he moved it its lustre changed. The surface was extremely close and
smooth. He caressed it for a moment.


Before Mor could think of a suitably impressive answer to Miss Carter\x{2019}s remark,
Demoyte came in. Mor turned about, and looked at Demoyte with some surprise. At
this time in the evening the old man was usually to be found wearing a frayed
velvet jacket, of a tobacco-stained red colour, and a rather limp bow tie. This
evening, however, he was wearing a grey lounge suit, which Mor had rarely seen,
and an ordinary tie. He had put a clean shirt on. He came in with head thrust
forward and bore down upon them. Though he stooped now, he was still a tall man
and with a head only just not grotesquely large for his body. His nose seemed
to have grown bigger with age. His eyes were blue and looked out between many
ridges of almost white dry skin. Scant white hairs still clung in a gentle film
to his bulging skull.


\x{2018}What!\x{2019} shouted Demoyte, \x{2018}you haven\x{2019}t given Miss Carter a drink! Mor, you are
only fit to be a country schoolmaster. Excuse our provincial habits, Miss
Carter, we don\x{2019}t know any better. You will have some sherry?\x{2019} He began to pour
it out.


\x{201c}Thank you,\x{2018} said Miss Carter, \x{2019}but do not blame Mr Mor. He has only this
moment seen me. He thought I was part of a rug.\x{2018} As Miss Carter replied to
Demoyte her primness became coyly animated. Mor looked at her again. Although
she had no accent, she spoke English as if it were not quite her native tongue.
He remembered that her mother had been French.


\x{2018}And so you might be, my dear,\x{2019} said Demoyte; \x{2018}a flower, a bird, an antelope.\x{2019}
He handed her the glass with a flourish.


Miss Handforth was discovered leaning in the doorway. \x{2018}The dinner\x{2019}s ready,\x{2019} she
said, \x{2018}but I suppose you aren\x{2019}t.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Go away, Handy,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}You\x{2019}re far too early. You all seem to want to
get the evening over quick. Mr Mor\x{2019}s better half is still to come.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, what am I to do about the dinner?\x{2019} said Miss Handforth. \x{2018}Spoil it by
over-cooking, or let it get cold? I don\x{2019}t mind which it is, but just let me
know.\x{2019}


There was a knock on the outside door, and then Nan stepped into the hall. Mor
saw her head appear suddenly behind Miss Handforth.


\x{2018}Nan!\x{2019} he said, as if to protect her from the hostility of the house against
her. He went to help her off with her coat, a service which it never seemed to
occur to Demoyte or Miss Handforth to perform, and then led her back into the
drawing-room, holding her by the hand. Nan had made what she herself would call
a real social effort, and was dressed in a smart well-fitting black dress with
which she wore a pearl necklace which Mor had bought once from Tim Burke at a
reduced price as a wedding anniversary present. Her wavy hair, glossy and
impeccably set, framed the pale oval face, smoothly powdered and unmarked by
wrinkles, the long mouth and the shrewd eyes, intelligent, practical, reliable,
full of power. She looked a tall handsome woman, well dressed and confident.
Mor looked at her with approval. In any conflict with the outside world Nan was
invariably an efficient ally.


\x{2018}Nan, may I introduce Miss Carter,\x{2019} said Mor, since Do-moyte said nothing.
\x{2018}Miss Carter, my wife.\x{2019}


The women smiled and greeted each other, and Nan as usual refused the glass of
sherry which Demoyte as usual poured out and offered to her.


\x{2018}As I said before, the meal is ready,\x{2019} said Miss Handforth, who was still
standing in the doorway. \x{2018}If the ladies want to go upstairs first, they know
the way. Meanwhile I shall be bringing in the soup.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, shut up, Handy,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}Give us a moment to finish our sherry, and
don\x{2019}t rush the ladies.\x{2019}


Nan and Miss Carter took the opportunity to withdraw, and Miss Handforth
stumped away to the kitchen. Mor turned to Demoyte and looked him over. Demoyte
peered at Mor, his eyes gleaming and his nose wrinkled in what Mor had learnt
to recognize as a smile. Demoyte\x{2019}s heavy sardonic mouth did not follow the
usual conventions about smiling.


\x{2018}Why the fancy dress, sir?\x{2019} said Mor, indicating the lounge suit.


\x{2018}Not a word!\x{2019} said Demoyte, conspiratorially. \x{2018}Am I to be summed up by a slip
of a girl? You don\x{2019}t know what I\x{2019}ve suffered in these last twenty-four hours!
She wants to see pictures of my parents, pictures of me as a child, pictures of
me as a student. She wants to know what I\x{2019}ve written. She practically asked if
I kept a diary. It\x{2019}s like having a psychiatrist in the house. Her sense of
vocation is like a steam hammer. You wouldn\x{2019}t think it to look at her, would
you? But I\x{2019}m going to lead her up the garden. I\x{2019}ve got her thoroughly foxed so
far. She shan\x{2019}t know what I\x{2019}m like if I can help it! These clothes are part of
the game. Ssh! here she comes.\x{2019} They all went in to dinner.


 



They had reached the dessert. Nan was methodically eating a pear and Miss
Carter was picking daintily at a branch of very small grapes. Mor was enjoying
the port. Demoyte sat at the head of the table and Mor sat at the foot with the
ladies between them. As Nan had predicted, no place had been set this evening
for Miss Handforth. This person towered over the table, often leaning upon it
as she made a remark, sneezing from time to time, and breathing down the
ladies\x{2019} necks.


Demoyte said, \x{2018}I asked old Bledyard to come to complete the party, but he made
some excuse, obviously false. Miss Carter hasn\x{2019}t met our Bledyard yet.\x{2019}
Bledyard was the art master at St Bride\x{2019}s, an eccentric.


\x{2018}I look forward to meeting him,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I have seen some of his
work. It is good.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Really?\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I didn\x{2019}t realize Bledyard ever actually painted anything!\x{2019}


\x{2018}He used to, certainly,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I have seen at least three good
landscapes. But I gather now he has theories which interfere with his
painting?\x{2019}


\x{2018}His head is full of cant,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}which he employs to excuse the fact
that he can\x{2019}t paint any more. That\x{2019}s how I see it. But at any rate Bledyard is
a man. He\x{2019}s got some stuff inside him. Not like the pious dolls poor Evvy will
fill the place with before long. You\x{2019}d better start clearing out, you infidel,\x{2019}
he said to Mor.


Mor, who was anxious to skirt the dangerous subject of his clearing out, said
quickly, \x{2018}I believe we are both to lunch with Mr Everard on Thursday, Miss
Carter. I think Bledyard has been invited too.\x{2019} He regretted this change of
subject at once, since it struck him that Everard had as usual blundered in
inviting him and failing to invite Nan. This aspect of the matter had not
struck him when Everard had mentioned the lunch that afternoon. Nan put down
her fruit knife noisily and drank some water.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}ll get nothing to drink with Evvy,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}Better stoke up now.
Have some more wine, Miss Carter. Can\x{2019}t I persuade you, Mrs Mor? See, Miss
Carter is drinking like a fish, and is more sober than any of us.\x{2019} Mor had
noticed this too.


Miss Carter did not rise to this quip. She said rather solemnly, \x{2018}I have only
met Mr Everard once. I look forward to seeing him again.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Impossible!\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}What did you think of poor Evvy? Let\x{2019}s hear Evvy
summed up!\x{2019} He winked at Mor.


Miss Carter hesitated. She cast a quick suspicious look at Demoyte. \x{2018}I think he
has a fresh and gentle face,\x{2019} she said firmly. \x{2018}He seems a man without any
malice in him. That is both rare and good.\x{2019}


Demoyte seemed taken aback for a moment. Mor taunted him with his eyes. \x{2018}Little
puritan!\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}So you reprove us all! Let me fill your glass yet
again.\x{2019}


No, thank you, Mr Demoyte,\x{2018} said Miss Carter. \x{2019}Of course, it takes a long time
to know a man, and this is only an impression. What do you think, Mrs Mor?\x{2018}


Mor held his breath. He thought the question rather bold. He hoped that Nan was
not going to dislike Miss Carter.


\x{2018}Well,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}I think fundamentally Mr Everard is a fool, and if someone
is a fool, especially if he\x{2019}s in a position of authority, this spoils his other
good qualities.\x{2019}


\x{2018}For once,\x{2019} cried Demoyte, \x{2018}I find myself in complete agreement with Mrs Mor.
And now, dear friends, it\x{2019}s time for coffee.\x{2019}


Coffee was taken in the library. Mor loved this room too. It lay above the
drawing-room and had the same view, but it was a longer room. There were the
three tall windows, corresponding to the ones below, and then an extra piece on
the front side of the house giving to the library one of the big bow windows
which faced the drive. Directly below this, cut off from the drawing-room, was
a little room which Miss Handforth, making what was always supposed to be a
joke, would call her boudoir. The bow window on the other side of the hall
belonged to the dining-room, and above, to Demoyte\x{2019}s bedroom. Next to the
library at the back of the house was a guest bedroom, which also enjoyed a view
of the lawn, and through whose other window could be seen, once it had grown
dark, a reddish glow which showed, at a distance of some twenty miles, where
London lay.


Demoyte s books were all behind glass, so that the room was full of
reflections. Demoyte was a connoisseur of books. Mor, who was not, had long ago
been barred from the library. Mor liked to tear a book apart as he read it,
breaking the back, thumbing and turning down the pages, commenting and
underlining. He liked to have his books close to him, upon a table, upon the
floor, at least upon open shelves. Seeing them so near and so destroyed, he
could feel that they were now almost inside his head. Demoyte\x{2019}s books seemed a
different kind of entity. Yet he liked to see them too, elegant, stiff and
spotless, gilded and calved, books to be held gently in the hand and admired,
and which recalled to mind the fact of which Mor was usually oblivious that a
book is a thing and not just a collection of thoughts.


The others sat down near to one of the lamps. Mor wandered about the room. He
felt free and at ease; almost, for the moment, happy. He looked out of the
windows. The Close was never silent, since day and night there could be heard
the hum of the traffic along the arterial road and the distant thunder of
trains and their sad piping cries. Headlights of cars swept by perpetually in
the middle distance, revealing trees and the scored surface of sandy
embankments. Mor turned back into the room. He surveyed the group by the lamp.
His eyes still full of the night, he felt detached and superior. Miss Carter
was sitting with her legs drawn up under her. Her skirt spread in a big arc
about her, and the lamplight falling upon the lower half of it made it glow
with reds and yellows. She looked, Mor thought, like some small and brilliantly
plum-aged bird. He felt he was being rude, and turned to one of the bookcases.


\x{2018}Keep your paws off those books!\x{2019} called Demoyte. \x{2018}Come and drink your coffee,
or Handy will remove it. You know she only allows seven minutes for coffee.\x{2019}


Miss Handforth appeared. She was wearing a rather grubby apron and was clearly
in the middle of washing up.


\x{2018}Can I take it now,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}or have I spoken out of turn?\x{2019} She sneezed. Nan
ostentatiously averted her head while Handy busied herself pulling the
curtains. Mor gulped his coffee down and the tray was removed.


Mor joined the conversation. He could see Nan looking restless and knew that
she was now calculating how soon she could decently rise to go. He could almost
hear her counting.


\x{2018}I think we ought to be starting for home,\x{2019} said Nan, after some little time.
She looked at Mor.


\x{2018}Yes, I suppose so,\x{2019} said Mor. He did not want to go yet.


Nan rose with determination. Demoyte did not try to detain her. The company
began to drift in a polite group towards the door.


\x{2018}I asked Handy to cut you some roses,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}but I have an uneasy
feeling she\x{2019}s forgotten. Handy!\x{2019} He shouted over the bannisters, \x{2018}Roses for Mrs
Mor!\x{2019}


Mor was touched. He knew that the roses were really for him, in response to his
having, a few days ago, expressed admiration for the rose garden.


Miss Handforth appeared from the kitchen with a loud clack of the green baise
door. \x{2018}I didn\x{2019}t get down the garden today,\x{2019} she announced.


\x{2018}Well, get down now,\x{2019} said Demoyte in an irritated tone. He was tired of
the evening.


\x{2018}You know I can\x{2019}t see in the dark,\x{2019} said Miss Handforth, well aware that
Demoyte was not serious. \x{2018}Besides, the dew is down.\x{2019}


Nan said simultaneously, \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t bother, please. They would have been lovely,
but now don\x{2019}t bother.\x{2019} Mor knew that she was not interested in the roses. Nan
thought on the whole that flowers were rather messy and insanitary things. But
she was quite pleased all the same to be able to underline that Handy was in
the wrong.


\x{2018}Let me go!\x{2019} said Miss Carter suddenly. \x{2018}I can see in the dark. I know where
the roses are. Let me cut some for Mrs Mor.\x{2019} She ran ahead of them down the
wide staircase.


\x{2018}Capital!\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}Handy, give her the big scissors from the hall
drawer. You go with her, Mor, and see she really knows the way. I\x{2019}ll entertain
your lady. But for Christ\x{2019}s sake don\x{2019}t be long.


Miss Carter took the scissors and vanished through the front door. Mor ran
after her, and closed the door behind him. The night was cool and very dark. He
could not see, but knew the way without sight to the wooden door in the wall
that led into the main garden. He heard the door clap before him, and in a
moment he felt its surface under his hand, cool and yielding. He emerged on to
the quiet dewy lawn. He heard the distant traffic and saw the interrupted
flashes from the headlights, but all about him was dark and still. He blinked,
and saw ahead of him the small figure hurrying away across the lawn.


\x{2018}Miss Carter!\x{2019} said Mor in a low voice, \x{2018}wait for me, I\x{2019}m coming too.\x{2019} After
the brilliance of the house the garden was strange, pregnant with trees and
bushes, open to the dew and the stars. He felt almost alarmed.


Miss Carter had stopped and was waiting for him. She seemed less tiny now that
there were no objects with which to compare her. He saw her eyes glint in the
darkness. \x{2018}This way, she said.


Mor blundered after her. \x{2018}Yes, you can see in the dark,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}I wish I
could.\x{2019} They went through the yew hedge under the archway into the second
garden.


They walked quietly across the lawn. Mor felt strangely breathless. Miss Carter
was laying her feet very softly to the earth and made no sound at all as she
walked. Mor tried to step softly too, but he could feel and hear under his feet
the moisture in the close-cropped grass. An intense perfume of damp earth and
darkened flowers surrounded them and quenched the noises of the world outside.
Mor could see very little, but he continued to follow the dark moving shape of
the girl ahead. He was still dazed by the swiftness of the transition.


They reached the steps which led up into the third garden. Miss Carter went up
the steps like a bird and for a moment he saw the pallor of her bare arm exposed
against the black holly bush as she turned to wait for him. Mor plunged
forward, his foot seeking the lowest step. He stumbled and almost fell.


\x{2018}Here, come this way,\x{2019} she said from above him, \x{2018}this way.\x{2019} She kept her voice
soft, compelled to by the garden. Then she came back down the steps and he
realized that she was reaching out her hand. Mor took her hand in his and let
her guide him up the steps. Her grip was firm. They passed between the black
holly bushes, and released each other. Mor felt a strong shock within him, as
if very distantly something had subsided or given way. He had a confused
feeling of surprise. The moon came out of the clouds for a moment and suddenly
the sky was seen in motion.


The rose garden was about them now, narrowing towards the place where Demoyte\x{2019}s
estate ended in the avenue of mulberry trees. Mor had never seen it by night.
It looked different now, as if the avenue were immensely long, and Mor had a
strange momentary illusion that it was in that direction that the house lay,
far off at the end of the avenue: Demoyte\x{2019}s house, or else its double, where
everything happened with a difference.


\x{2018}Quelle merveille!\x{2019} said Miss Carter in a low voice. She took a few
quick steps across the grass, and then stopped, lifting her face to the
moonlight. A moment later she began to run and threw her arms about the trunk
of the first mulberry tree of the avenue. The branches above her were murmuring
like a river.


Mor coughed. He was slightly embarrassed by these transports. \x{2018}You know, we mustn\x{2019}t
be too long,\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}Yes, yes,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, detaching herself from the tree, \x{2018}we shall pick
them very quickly now. She began to run between the beds, picking out the buds
which were just partly open. The scissors snicked and the long-stemmed roses
were cast on to the grass. The moon whitened the paler ones and made the dark
ones more dark, like blood. Mor tried to pick a rose, but as he had nothing
with which to cut it he only pricked himself and mangled the rose.


\x{2018}Leave all to me,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, coming to snip off the dangling blossom.
\x{2018}There, that should be enough.\x{2019}


Mor was anxious to get back now. He had a vision of Nan and Demoyte waiting
impatiently in the hall. Also, there was something which he wanted to think
over. He hastened ahead down the stone steps, his eyes now accustomed to the
dark, and ran noisily across the lawn to the yew hedge. Here he waited, and
held the iron gate open for Miss Carter. It clinked to behind them, and now
they could see the lighted windows of the house where already Miss Handforth
had drawn back the curtains in preparation for the night. They passed the
wooden gate, and in a moment they were blinking and rubbing their eyes in the
bright light of the hall. Miss Carter clutched the great armful of roses to her
breast.


\x{2018}What an age you were,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Did you get lost?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}it was just very dark.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Here are the roses,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, trying to detach them from where they
had pinned themselves to her cotton blouse. \x{2018}What about some paper to put them
in?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Here, have the Evening News,\x{2019} said Demoyte, taking it from the table.
\x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t read it, but to the devil with it, now the day is over.\x{2019}


Nan spread out the paper on the table and Miss Carter laid the roses upon it,
trying to order them as she did so. \x{2018}How beautiful!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Miss Carter
must have one, don\x{2019}t you think?\x{2019} She selected a deep red rose and held it out
graciously to Miss Carter, who took it and fumbled awkwardly to fix it at her
bosom. She failed, and held it in her hand, against her skirt.


\x{2018}Now take your flowers and be off with you,\x{2019} said Demoyte, who was yawning and
clearly wanted to be in bed. \x{2018}Good night!\x{2019}


\x{2018}Good night, sir,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}and thank you. Good night, Miss Carter.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Good night,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Thank you for the roses.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Good night,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


Nan and Mor were out on the gravel outside the front door. The house glowed at
them for a moment from within, and they saw the figures of Demoyte and Miss
Carter waving them off. Then the door shut and the light above it went out.
Demoyte did not believe in seeing his guests off the premises. Nan waited while
in darkness Mor found his bicycle. They started down the drive, Mor pushing the
machine. Nan took hold of his arm.


\x{2018}Thank heavens that\x{2019}s over!\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}it was rather grizzly, wasn\x{2019}t it?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}What did you make of Miss Carter?\x{2019} said Nan.


\x{2018}Not much,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I found her a bit intimidating. Rather solemn.\x{2019}


\x{2018}She takes herself seriously,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}But she\x{2019}s really a little clown. She
obviously gets on swimmingly with Demoyte when no one else is there.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Maybe,\x{2019} said Mor, who hadn\x{2019}t thought of that.


\x{2018}You were ages in the garden,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Whatever happened?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Nothing,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}absolutely nothing.\x{2019}


They walked on in silence and turned on to the main road. Mor was reviving in
his mind the curious feeling of shock which he had experienced at the top of
the stone steps. He found it hard to interpret.",

            "\x{2018}RIGDEN,\x{2019}
said Mor.


A long silence followed. Mor was taking the Fifth Form Latin class, a chore
which sometimes came his way during the absence on sick leave of Mr Baseford,
the classics master. The day was the day after Mr Demoyte\x{2019}s dinner party. It
was a hot afternoon, the first period after lunch, a time which Mor hated. A
fly buzzed on the window. Twenty boys sat with the Elegies of Propertius open
before them. Rigden clearly could make nothing of the line in question.


\x{2018}Come on, Rigden,\x{2019} said Mor rather wearily, \x{2018}have a bash. You can translate the
first word anyway.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You,\x{2019} said Rigden. He was a slight crazy-looking boy with a small head.
He idolized Mor. His inability to please him was one of the tragedies of his
school days. He leaned intently over his book.


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s right,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}and the second word.\x{2019}


A yell of uncontrolled laughter went up in the next room. That was Mr Prewett\x{2019}s
mathematics class. Prewett was unhappily quite unable to keep order. Mor knew
that keeping order was a gift of nature, but he could not but despise Prewett a
little all the same. Mor himself had but to look at the boys and they fell
silent.


\x{2018}Only,\x{2019} said Rigden.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}now go on.\x{2019}


Rigden stared wretchedly at the page. \x{2018}While it is permitted,\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}Lucet, you juggins,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}not licet. Carde?\x{2019}


Jimmy Carde was one of Mor\x{2019}s enemies. He was also the bosom friend of Mor\x{2019}s son
Donald. Mor never felt at ease with Carde.


\x{2018}While there is light,\x{2019} said Carde. He spoke in a casual and
superior way, scarcely opening his mouth, as if it were a concession on his
part to support these absurd proceedings at all.


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s right,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Now, Rigden, you go on.\x{2019}


Rigden was beginning to look desperate. He gazed into the book, biting his lip.


\x{2018}Get a move on,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}we haven\x{2019}t got all day.\x{2019} He sighed, hearing the
traffic which murmured away sleepily in the distance. There came back into his
consciousness the thought, which had not been far absent from it throughout the
lesson, that at a <<quarter past three|10>> he was to meet the portrait painter, Miss
Carter, and show her round the school. A note from Mr Everard, waiting in his
pigeon-hole that morning, had conveyed the request; and since its arrival Mor
had had little time for reflection. He had felt only, for some reason that was
obscure to him, a slight feeling of disappointment and irritation that his next
meeting with Miss Carter was not to be at Mr Everard\x{2019}s lunch party, which he
had fixed in his mind as the next occasion when he would see her.

\x{2018}Lives do not desert the fruit,\x{2019} said Rigden in desperation, throwing
caution to the winds.


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Did you prepare this, Rigden?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes, sir,\x{2019} said Rigden, not raising his eyes, and trying to invest his voice
with a tone of injured innocence.


\x{2018}Well, you\x{2019}d better stay behind afterwards and talk to me about it,\x{2019} said Mor.
\x{2018}Our time\x{2019}s nearly up. Could somebody finish translating? Carde, what about
you, could you do the last six lines for us?\x{2019}


Carde sat quietly looking at the poem. He was a good performer, and he was in
no hurry. Carde was efficient, and Mor respected efficiency. In the moment of
renewed silence he looked again at the poem. He had chosen it for them that
morning as a piece of prepared translation. Perhaps after all it was too hard.
Perhaps also not quite suitable. His eye passed over the lines.

Tu modo, dum lucet, fructum ne desere vitae.
Omnia si dederis oscula, pauca dabis.
Ac veluti folia arentes liquere corollas,
Quae passim calathis strata natare vides,
Sic nobis, qui nunc magnum speramus amantes
Forsitan includet aastina fata dies.


Carde cleared his throat.


\x{2018}Yes?\x{2019} said Mor. He looked at his watch. He saw that the period was nearly
ended, and a slight feeling of uneasiness came over him.


\x{2018}While the light remains,\x{2019} said Carde, speaking slowly in his high deliberate
voice, \x{2018}only do not forsake the joy of life. If you shall have given all your
kisses, you will give too few. And as leaves fall from withered wreaths which
you may see spread upon the cups and floating there, so for us, who now as
lovers hope for so much, perhaps tomorrow\x{2019}s day will close the doom.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}yes. Very nice, Carde. Thank you. Now you can all go. Rigden,
wait a moment, would you?\x{2019}


An immediate clatter broke out, and amid a banging of books and desk tops there
was a rush for the door. Carde was first out. Mr Prewett\x{2019}s class was evidently
up at the same moment, and there was a confluence of din outside. The
admonishing of Rigden took but little time, and Mor strode into the musty
corridor to disperse the riot. A moment later he emerged from the centre door
of what was gracelessly called Main School into the sunshine and looked about
him.


The chief buildings of St Bride\x{2019}s were grouped unevenly around a large square
of asphalt which was called the playground, although the one thing that was
strictly forbidden therein was playing. The buildings consisted of four tall
red-brick blocks: Main School, which contained the hall, and most of the senior
classrooms, and which was surmounted by the neo-Gothic tower; Library, which
contained the library and more classrooms, and which was built close against
Main School, jutting at right angles from it; School House, opposite to
Library, where the scholars ate and slept; and \x{2018}Phys and Gym\x{2019} opposite to Main
School, which contained the gymnasium, some laboratories, the administrative offices,
and two flats for resident masters. The St Bride\x{2019}s estate was extensive, but
lay along the slope of a hill, which created notorious problems upon the
playing fields which lay behind Main School, stretching away towards the
fringes of the housing estate and the maze of suburban roads in the midst of
which Mor\x{2019}s house lay. The playground was connected with the main road by a
gravel drive which ran through a shrubbery, past the masters\x{2019} garden; but the
largest section of the grounds lay farther down the hill, below the Library
building. Here there was a thick wood of oak and birch, dense with fern and
undergrowth, and cut by many winding paths, deep and soft with old leaves, the
paradise of the younger boys. On the fringe of this wood, within sight of the Library,
stood the Chapel, a stumpy oblong building of lighter brick and more recent
date, looking not unlike a water works. Beyond this, hidden among the trees,
were the three houses to which the boys other than the scholars belonged, where
they lived and took their meals and, if they were senior boys, had their
studies. These were Mor\x{2019}s house, Prewett\x{2019}s house, and the third was under the
aegis of Mr Baseford, then on sick leave. The houses dully bore the names of
their housemasters, and a keen rivalry between them was continually fostered by
the teaching staff. Beyond the wood, alongside the arterial road, which skirted
the school grounds on that side, lay the squash courts and the swimming pool -
and upon the other side, upon the edge of the housing estate, were the music
rooms and the studio. At the bottom of the hill was a ragged lawn, a
half-hearted attempt at a flower garden, and beyond these a white stucco
Victorian house inhabited de officio by Mr Everard. This ended the
domain.


Mr Everard\x{2019}s note to Mor had said that Miss Carter would be waiting in the
playground at the end of the first afternoon period. Mor looked quickly about,
but could not see her. The strong sun was slanting in between the Library and
the Phys and Gym, gilding the dark nobbly surface of the asphalt. Warmth arose
from it, and the air quivered slightly. What Mor did see, at the corner of the
playground near the far end of the Library, was his son Donald. Towards Donald,
across the sunny asphalt, Jimmy Carde was making his way by a series of
spectacular skips and jumps. He reached Donald and made violent impact with him
like a bouncing ball. They spun round gripping each other\x{2019}s shoulders. From a
distance Mor saw this encounter without pleasure.


Mor began to walk across the playground in the direction of Library. He looked
about him for Miss Carter, who was not to be seen, and kept the still rotating
pair in the comer of his eye. As Mor neared the main door of Library he saw
that Donald and Carde had noted his approach. They drew apart, and in a moment
Carde had sped away back across the open space, leaping as he did so madly into
the air and spreading out his arms with palms and fingers extended until at
last, capering grotesquely, he disappeared through the door of School House. Carde
was a scholar. Donald was left standing alone at the comer of the Library
building. He was clearly uncertain what to do. He would have liked to slip
away, but now that his father patently had him in his field of vision, it
seemed improper to do this. On the other hand, Donald had no intention of
making any approach to his father. He stood perfectly still, clutching his book
and watching in a glassy way to see whether Mor would go into Library or pass
round the far side of the building.


Mor also hesitated. Random encounters between himself and his son during school
hours embarrassed both, and Mor avoided them as far as possible. However, he
felt that he could not now ignore Donald. This might hurt the boy even more. So
he turned towards him. Rooted to the spot, Donald awaited his father.


\x{2018}Hello, Don,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}how goes it?\x{2019}


Donald looked at him, and looked away at once. He was tall enough now to look
Mor in the eyes; indeed, there was scarcely an inch between them. His
resemblance to his father was considerable. He had Mor\x{2019}s crisp dark hair, his
crooked nose and lop-sided smile. His eyes were darker though, and more
suspicious. Mor\x{2019}s eyes were a flecked grey, Donald\x{2019}s a brooding brown. The
black points upon his chin portended a dark and vigorous beard. His face was
soft, however, still with the indeterminacy of boyhood. His mouth was shapeless
and pouting, not firmly set.


Donald was long in growing up - too long, Mor felt with some sadness. He could
not but grieve over his son\x{2019}s strange lack of maturity. At an age when he
himself had been devouring books of every kind in an insatiable hunger for
knowledge, Donald appeared to have no intellectual interests at all. He worked
at his chemistry in a desultory fashion, sufficiently to keep himself out of
positive disgrace; but apart from this Donald seemed to do, as far as Mor could
see, nothing whatever. He spent a lot of time hanging about, talking to Carde
and others, or even, what seemed to Mor odder still, alone. He was to be seen
for half an hour on end just leaning out of his window, or else sitting on the
grass in the lower garden beyond the wood, his arms about his knees, doing
absolutely nothing. This mode of existence was to Mor extremely mys \x{2014} terious.
But he had not yet ventured to chide or even question Donald concerning the
employment of his time. Donald\x{2019}s reading, such as it was, seemed to consist
mainly of Three Men in a Boat, which he read over and over again, always
laughing immoderately, and various books on climbing which he kept carefully concealed
from his mother. During the holi \x{2014} days he was a tireless and indiscriminate
cinema-goer. As Mor looked at him now, at his suspicious and sideways-turning
face, he felt a deep sadness that he was not able to express his love for his
son, and that it could even be that Donald did not know at all that it existed.


\x{2018}All right,\x{2019} said Donald. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m just off down to the nets.\x{2019} Donald was a
fanatical cricketer.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re in the house team, aren\x{2019}t you?\x{2019} said Mor. Donald was in Mr Prewett\x{2019}s
house.


\x{2018}Yes, sir,\x{2019} said Donald. \x{2018}I was last year.\x{2019}


He half turned, not sure if it was now proper for him to go away.


But Mor wanted to keep him there, to keep him until something had been said
which would be a real communication between them. He wished that Donald would meet
his eyes. He hated his calling him \x{2018}sir\x{2019}.


\x{2018}Carde translated well in my Latin class,\x{2019} said Mor. He felt anxious to say
something nice about Carde.


\x{2018}Ah, yes,\x{2019} said Donald.


Mor wondered whether Donald would tell Carde that he had said that, and whether
it would please Carde to be told. How little he knew about them. He looked at
the book under Donald\x{2019}s arm. He knew from experience that the boy hated being
asked what he was reading. But curiosity overcame his judgement. \x{2018}What\x{2019}s the
book, Don?\x{2019} he asked.


Donald passed it over without a word. Mor looked at the title. Five Hundred
Best Jokes and Puzzles.


\x{2018}Hmmm,\x{2019} said Mor. He could think of no comment on the book. He gave it back to
his son.


At that moment Mor saw, over Donald\x{2019}s shoulder, a small figure approaching. It
was Miss Carter. Mor saw at once, with some annoyance, that she was wearing
trousers. Donald half turned, saw her, and mumbling an excuse retreated rapidly
and took to his heels, running in the direction of the playing fields.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry to be so late,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}and I hope I didn\x{2019}t disturb you
just now. One of your pupils?\x{2019}


\x{2018}My son,\x{2019} said Mor.


Miss Carter seemed surprised. She looked at Mor curiously. \x{2018}I did not think you
could have a son so old,\x{2019} she said, her odd precise voice lilting slightly.


\x{2018}Well, you see I can, said Mor awkwardly. He wished that she had not made
herself conspicuous by wearing trousers. They were close-fitting black ones,
narrow at the ankles. With them Miss Carter wore a vivid blue shirt, blue
canvas shoes, and no other adornments. She was slim enough; but all the same
she looked in those garments, Mor thought, rather like a school child dressed
to impersonate a Paris street boy.


\x{2018}It must be a wonderful thing to have a grown-up son,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


\x{2018}It is good,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but it has its stormy moments. Shall we go this way?\x{2019}
They began to walk along towards the main door of Library.


\x{2018}I can see that you are irritated by my trousers,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}and if I
had thought more I would not have worn them. But I have them for working in,
and it didn\x{2019}t occur to me to change. I will next time.\x{2019}


Mor laughed, and his irritation vanished completely. He led her up the stairs
to show her the Library. As they walked in silence between the tables, now
loaded with books over which the senior boys were bent at their work, Mor found
himself wondering whether Miss Carter remembered with any sort of interest that
in the garden last night she had taken his hand in hers. He did not imagine
that she did. The speculation came quite quietly into Mor\x{2019}s mind, and he
entertained it without emotion. As they descended the stairs, he forgot it
again.


They crossed the playground towards Main School. Mor thought he would show Miss
Carter the hall next. They found it empty, its rows of windows open wide to
show a slope of pine trees and a distant view of the playing fields. It was
melancholy with summer. High in the rafters a few butterflies flitted to and
fro. The velvet curtains on the stage swayed in the light breeze from the windows.
Their feet echoed on the boards.


\x{2018}This is the hall,\x{2019} said Mor. He looked at it gloomily. It was deplorably
familiar.


You must tell me all about Mr Demoyte,\x{2018} said Miss Carter suddenly.


\x{2018}What do you want to know?\x{2019} said Mor. He felt that he had half expected this.
They walked back slowly into the open air.


\x{2018}Well, everything,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}as much as you know. As you will
realize, painting a portrait is not just a matter of sitting down and painting
what you see. Where the human face is concerned, we interpret what we see more
immediately and more profoundly than with any other object. A person looks
different when we know him - he may even look different as soon as we know one
particular thing about him. And in any case there are simpler problems. A
choice must be made about the clothes which the person is to wear in the
picture, the posture which he is to hold, the expression on his face, the
background, the accessories. A consideration of all these things will then
affect one\x{2019}s methods and one\x{2019}s technique. It is impossible to be in a hurry.\x{2019}


Mor smiled inwardly at this speech, which had been delivered in a slightly
pompous and didactic tone. They were now walking across the playground in the
direction of the Gym. He wondered if this was Miss Carter\x{2019}s own voice or the
voice of her father. Partly to try her, he said, \x{2018}Why should you want to learn
more about Demoyte? Who knows what view of him is the right one? Perhaps you,
meeting him for the first time, and knowing no more than what you see, will see
him more truly than we who have known him for so long.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I am a professional portrait painter,\x{2019} said Miss Carter rather primly, \x{2018}and I
am employed to paint your Mr Demoyte, not my Mr Demoyte.\x{2019}


Mor whistled to himself. He now saw what Demoyte had meant when he said that
she had a sense of vocation like a steam hammer. They entered the Gymnasium. It
was full of juniors, who were dangling on ropes, curling over bars, springing
over the horse, or otherwise bouncing about on the floor after the rather frog-like
manner of small boys. Mr Hensman, the gym instructor, smiled and waved to Mor.
Mor liked him. He was one of Donald\x{2019}s well-wishers.


Miss Carter looked a while at the pullulating scene. Then she said, as they
turned away, \x{2018}Of course, what I said just now was pretentious nonsense. What Mr
Demoyte would call cant. At least I know him well enough to know one of his
favourite words. I want to paint a really good likeness. We all think that
there is something which is what a person is really like, and that this takes
some time to learn. I think you know what Mr Demoyte is really like, and I want
to find out\x{2019}


They walked across the playground again, and entered School House. Mor felt a
new respect for Miss Carter, and it occurred to him for the first time that he
liked her. He wondered where she had been educated. He supposed in a French lyc\x{e9}e.
He would have liked to ask her, only it would have been too forward.


\x{2018}Well, I shall do what I can for you,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Here is one of the main
scholars\x{2019} dormitories.\x{2019} He opened the door and showed the long double line of
iron beds, all with their blue coverlets. Beside each bed stood a white chest
of drawers, on top of which each boy was allowed to place no more than three
objects. Between the beds were white curtains which were pulled back in the day
time.


This spectacle seemed to interest Miss Carter more than the Gym and the hall.
\x{2018}It looks Dutch,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}I wonder why? So much white material, and the
light - Does your son sleep here?\x{2019}


The question disturbed Mor. \x{2018}My son isn\x{2019}t a scholar,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Anyway, only
the younger boys sleep in dormitories. The older ones sleep in their studies.\x{2019}


\x{2018}There\x{2019}s something very touching about a dormitory,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I have
seen graveyards which are touching in the same way.\x{2019}


They began to descend the stairs.


\x{2018}I have the impression, for instance,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}that Mr Demoyte is
deliberately trying to deceive me about certain things. Since I arrived I am
quite sure that he has been wearing clothes that he does not usually wear. I
think this not only because of the smell of mothballs but because of the way
the clothes look on him.\x{2019}


Mor laughed. He felt no obligation to keep Demoyte\x{2019}s absurd secret. \x{2018}You\x{2019}re
right!\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Demoyte hardly ever puts on a suit. He usually wears
corduroys and a sports coat during the day, and black trousers and a velvet
smoking-jacket in the evening. And a bow tie, of course.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I suspected the bow tie,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}because of a certain gesture he
makes as if to adjust one. Yes. Why should he want to deceive me?\x{2019}


\x{2018}He doesn\x{2019}t want to be summed up by a slip of a girl,\x{2019} said Mor. He glanced
sideways at her..


Miss Carter smiled faintly. \x{2018}But I will sum him up,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}I will!\x{2019}


Not her father\x{2019}s voice, thought Mor. Herself. They began to walk down the hill,
across the ragged slope of grass which separated the Library building from the
first trees of the wood. \x{2018}Would you like to see the Chapel?\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}No, thank you,\x{2019} said Miss Carter firmly. \x{2018}Not dressed like this. I might offend
someone. Tell me, has Mr Demoyte ever published a volume of poems called Falling
Flowers?\x{2019}


Mor stopped and went into a peal of laughter. \x{2018}No!\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Did he try to
tell you those were his?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}When I asked to see all his published works he
offered me the poems, and said he\x{2019}d get the others in a day or two.\x{2019}


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s probably inventing something even more fantastic,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s almost
a shame to spoil his fun. Falling Flowers is an early effort of Mr
Everard!\x{2019}


Miss Carter laughed. \x{2018}Mr Demoyte is enjoying himself,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}I\x{2019}d better
rely on you instead. Could you please get me all his books? Can I trust you, I
wonder?\x{2019} She spoke with a cool peremptory air which Mor might have resented.


\x{2018}Yes!\x{2019} said Mor fervently. He did not resent it. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll get you what he has
written. There isn\x{2019}t much. The book on Oriental rugs, some articles on rare
editions, and a volume of sermons preached at School Services. That was
published very long ago. Demoyte would be furious if he knew I\x{2019}d given it to
you.\x{2019}


\x{2018}It shall be a secret between us,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


Mor felt at once a little uneasy at the thought that he was going to deceive
the old man; but he wanted to please Miss Carter, and he thought her wishes
were reasonable.


\x{2018}What would you like to see now?\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}What about the studio? There\x{2019}s an
exhibition of the boys\x{2019} art that was put on for Speech Day. I think it\x{2019}s still
there.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh yes, please,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I love children\x{2019}s art.\x{2019}


It seemed to Mor a little quaint that she should refer to the boys as children.
It occurred to him that he was regarding Miss Carter as being in some way more
youthful than his own pupils. They walked out of the sun on to one of the
shadowy paths of the wood, the ground underfoot crackling with twigs and leaves
and scattered with patches of golden light.


\x{2018}But won\x{2019}t we meet Mr Bledyard?\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


\x{2018}Would you mind?\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}In fact, he\x{2019}s hardly ever there on these sunny
afternoons. He takes the boys out sketching.\x{2019}


I haven\x{2019}t met him yet,\x{2018} said Miss Carter, \x{2019}and I feel a bit nervous.\x{2018}


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s quite harmless, our Bledyard,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}only a little odd. He\x{2019}s a sort
of primitive Christian, you know. His views on portrait painting are connected
with that. He thinks we ought to get back to Byzantine styles or else not paint
at all.\x{2019}


They approached the studio. It was a long rambling building which incorporated
an old barn that had been standing there before. The music rooms were in a
jumble of Nissen huts which were just visible farther on through the trees.
Scattered sounds of a piano and of wind instruments were borne on the summer
air. Miss Carter shivered and stopped in her tracks.


\x{2018}What is it?\x{2019} said Mor. He was surprised at her emotion. \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t be afraid. I
can see from here that there\x{2019}s no one in the studio.\x{2019}


They came down the grassy path, stepping on the withered leaves of ferns, and
crossed a cobbled yard towards the door. Mor stepped inside first. A strong
smell of paint greeted him, the clean self-assertive smell of art, after the woodland
perfumes of nature which had drifted with them down the hill. There was no one
within.


\x{2018}Come on, the coast\x{2019}s clear!\x{2019} he called to Miss Carter, who was still standing
on the cobblestones and looking as if she was ready to run. She entered slowly,
leaning warily round the side of the door.


Once she was well inside her attention was caught by the paintings which were
pinned on to tall boards which leaned against the walls all round the room. She
began to look at them. Through the high windows the golden light of the
afternoon came benevolently down, and gave to the studio something of the air
of a modern church. For the first time that day Mor felt himself at leisure to
observe his companion. He sat down on one of the stools and watched her as she
moved from picture to picture. She looked like a child\x{2019}s picture herself,
extremely gay and simple. Her dark hair, which was jaggedly cut, arched at the
crown and crowded on her brow. Mor observed the youthful fullness of her face,
pouting with concentration \x{2014} and as he watched her he reflected to himself how
rarely it was now that he met a woman.


\x{2018}How wonderfully children observe!\x{2019} said Miss Carter in an excited tone. \x{2018}Look
at this scene \x{2014} it\x{2019}s so dramatic. A grown-up artist would not dare to be so
dramatic. Indeed he could hardly do it without being sentimental.\x{2019}


Mor looked at the picture. It represented a young girl stepping on to a train,
while a young man offered her a rose with a gesture of despair. Before Mor
could think of a comment, Miss Carter had moved on to another picture, and
another, making enthusiastic exclamations. At the end of the row lay a pile of
white paper and some poster paint ready mixed. When she reached the last
picture Miss Carter twirled on her heel, seized one of the brushes, and drew in
paint an almost perfect circle on one of the sheets. She did this so quickly
that Mor had to laugh.


\x{2018}You know the story about Giotto,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}that when some grand people came
to commission a picture, and wanted a specimen of his work, he just drew a
perfect circle for them with his brush? He got the job. That impressed me
somehow as a child. I used to practise it, as if it were a guarantee of
success.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Is it hard?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Try\x{2019}, said Miss Carter, handing him the brush, still full of paint.


Mor balanced the unfamiliar object in his hand, and drew a very shaky oval
shape upon the paper. \x{2018}Hopeless!\x{2019} he said, laughing. The two figures
intersected. \x{2018}I think we ought to go, said Mor. He had promised to deliver Miss
Carter back for a late tea at Brayling\x{2019}s Close, and he began suddenly to be
uneasy about the time.


\x{2018}Oh dear,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}Now I don\x{2019}t want to go. The smell of paint makes
me feel quite strange.\x{2019} She began to wander between the rows of stools and
easels, sniffing the air and spreading out her arms. \x{2018}Where does that lead to?\x{2019}
she asked, pointing to a wooden ladder which led upward to a trap-door in the
ceiling of the studio.


This is an old barn, you know,\x{2018} said Mor. \x{2019}That leads to the loft. It\x{2019}s quite
well lighted. The near part of it is a pottery room, and the far part has been
made into a sort of flat for Mr Bledyard.\x{2018}


\x{2018}He lives up there?\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}I want to see!\x{2019} she said, and before Mor could stop her she was running up the
ladder and pushing at the trap-door.


\x{2018}Wait a moment!\x{2019} cried Mor, and began to climb after her. The trap-door yielded
and he saw the canvas shoes flapping to reveal the soles of her feet as she
pulled herself up into the loft above him. When he reached the top Miss Carter
was running about between the potter\x{2019}s wheels which stood at intervals about
the floor. Mor was reminded of the scene in the rose garden. He began to feel
nervous.


\x{2018}I think we\x{2019}d better go,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Mr Bledyard might come back and find us
here.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I should like to see his room,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}Is it in here?\x{2019} She went to
the far end of the loft and opened a door. Mor followed her.


The big space, stretching the width of the loft, with the roof sloping on both
sides, and well lit by sky-lights, was Bledyard\x{2019}s bed-sittingroom. His kitchen
and bathroom were in an outhouse below, which was reached by a wooden stair.
Mor, who had only once before beheld this room, looked at it with a little awe.
It was extremely bare and colourless. The floor was scrubbed and the walls
whitewashed. No picture, no coloured object adorned it. The furniture was of
pale wood, and even the bed had a white cover.


Miss Carter stared about her. \x{2018}No colours,\x{2019} she murmured. \x{2018}Interesting.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, now you\x{2019}ve seen it, let\x{2019}s go down,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}I must just try the bed,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}to see how hard it is!\x{2019} She
skipped across to Bledyard\x{2019}s bed and subsided on to it, reclining there with
her head propped on her arm and her black trousered legs outstretched on the
counterpane. In the chaste scene she looked as dusky as a chimney-sweeper\x{2019}s
boy. She peered up at Mor.


Mor was irritated and slightly shocked. He checked a comment, and deliberately
withdrew his attention from her as from a child that shows off. It was not
clear to him just how spontaneous these antics were. He went back to the
trap-door, meaning to descend again into the studio, but as he looked down
through the square hole into the well-lighted room below, he saw with a slight
thrill of alarm that the studio door was opening. The foreshortened figure of
Bledyard, his chin sunk upon his breast as usual, appeared slowly round the
door. He seemed to be alone. He began to poke around, looking for something. As
he was so intent upon his search, and as his lank and longish hair fell well
forward on either side of his cheeks like blinkers, it was unlikely that his
gaze should be attracted to the trap-door. He continued to potter. Mor watched
him, feeling the curious guilt which attaches to seeing someone unseen from
above: and the moment somehow passed at which he could call out to him in a
natural way. He hesitated, trying to think of something to say to Bledyard
which would at the same time warn Miss Carter to rise from her ridiculous pose
and set the bed to rights. However, before he could speak, Bledyard had turned
about and left the studio, and his footsteps were to be heard pounding across
the cobbles and into the wood.


\x{2018}What is it?\x{2019} asked Miss Carter. She was still stretched out on the bed,
watching Mor intently through the bedroom door.


He came back and stood over her. He did not want to raise his voice.
\x{2018}Bledyard!\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}But he\x{2019}s gone now.\x{2019}


Miss Carter sprang up and began to smooth down the counterpane. She was
extremely flurried and apologetic. \x{2018}Oh dear,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}He didn\x{2019}t see us, did
he? I am so sorry.\x{2019}


Mor told her it didn\x{2019}t matter, and then led her away quickly down the back
stairs. He felt annoyance with himself for not having spoken at once to
Bledyard and with the girl for the thoroughly silly way in which their afternoon
had ended. Here, it seemed, was another foolish small secret between them. Mor
disapproved of secrets.",

never managed to look like anything in her outdoor clothes. She could look
handsome and well got-up at an evening party - but her coats and hats never
looked quite right. Mor could see her now, as he gazed over the heads of his
audience, sitting near the back with a slightly superior smile on her face. She
wore a rather characterless felt hat, and although it was a warm evening, a
coat with fur on the collar.


Mor was giving his WEA class. The evening was nearly over. He often wondered
why Nan insisted on coming and what she made of those performances. She was not
on easy terms with Tim Burke, who always acted as chairman and entertained them
afterwards, and Mor could hardly believe that she came to hear him talk. In any
case, she never referred later to anything that he had said. If she ever asked
a question, it was a simple and sometimes a stupid one. Mor felt that she did it
merely for appearances, and wished that she wouldn\x{2019}t.


Donald Mor was also present, not sitting with his mother, but in a seat at the
side near the front, leaning his back against the wall, one long leg crossed
over the other. He had a special dispensation from St Bride\x{2019}s to attend these
sessions. Marsington was three stops along the railway, and just inside the
London area, but a fast train would bring the boy back to school <<well before
midnight|13>>. Why Don came was no mystery to Mor. He came for the sake of Tim
Burke, whom he adored, and from whom he scarcely took his eyes throughout the
evening. Mor doubted whether Donald listened to a single word that was said.


Mor was anwering a question. \x{2018}Freedom,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}is not exactly what I would
call a virtue. Freedom might be called a benefit or a sort of grace \x{2014} though of
course to seek it or to gain it might be a proof of ment.


The questioner, a successful middle-aged greengrocer, who was one of the props
of the local Labour Party, was hanging grimly on to the back of the chair in
front of him, whose occupant was leaning nervously forward. The greengrocer who
had made the remark that surely freedom was the chief virtue, and wasn\x{2019}t it
thinking so that differentiated us from the Middle Ages? stared intently at Mor
as if drinking in his words. Mor thought, he is not really listening, he does
not want to hear what I say, he knows what he thinks and is not going to
reorganize his views. The words I am uttering are not the words for him.


He felt again that sad guilty feeling which he had whenever he caught himself
going through the motions of being a teacher without really caring to make his
pupils understand. How well he knew that many teachers, including some who got
high reputations by doing so, contented themselves with putting up a show,
often a brilliant one, in front of those who were to be instructed - and of
this performance both sides might be the dupes. Whereas the real teacher cares
only for one thing, that the matter should be understood; and into that process
he vanishes. Mor hated it when he caught himself trying to be clever. Sometimes
the temptation was strong. An adult education class will often contain persons
who have come merely to parade a certain view-point, and with no intention of
learning anything. In response to this provocation it was tempting to produce
merely a counter-attraction, a show, designed to impress rather than to make
anything clear. But to make anything clear here, Mor felt with a sudden
despair - how could it be done? With this feeling he irrelevantly remembered
Tim Burke\x{2019}s moving proposition, and felt a sudden shame at this evening\x{2019}s
efforts.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry, Mr Staveley,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve said nothing to the purpose. Let me
try again. You say surely freedom is a virtue \x{2014} and I hesitate to accept this
phrase. Let me explain why. To begin with, as I was saying in my talk this
evening, freedom needs to be defined. If by freedom we mean absence of external
restraint, then we may call a man lucky for being free \x{2014} but why should we call
him good? If, on the other hand, by freedom we mean self-discipline, which
dominates selfish desires, then indeed we may call a free man virtuous. But, as
we know, this more refined conception of freedom can also play a dangerous role
in politics. It may be used to justify the tyranny of people who think
themselves to be the enlightened ones. Whereas the notion of freedom which I\x{2019}m
sure Mr Staveley has in mind, the freedom which inspired the great Liberal
leaders of the last century, is political freedom, the absence of tyranny. This
is the condition of virtue, and to strive for it is a virtue. But it is not
itself a virtue. To call mere absence of restraint or mere kicking over the
traces and flouting of conventions a virtue is to be simply romantic.\x{2019}


Well, what\x{2019}s wrong with being romantic?\x{2018} said Mr Staveley obstinately. \x{2019}Let\x{2019}s
have \x{201c}romantic\x{201d} defined, since you\x{2019}re so keen on definitions.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Surely, isn\x{2019}t love the chief virtue?\x{2019} said a lady sitting near the front, and
turning round to look at Mr Staveley. \x{2018}Or does Mr Staveley think that the New
Testament is out of date?\x{2019}


I\x{2019}ve failed again, thought Mor, with the feeling of one who has brought the
horse round the field a second time only for it to shy once more at the jump.
He felt very tired and the words did not come easily. But he was prepared to go
on trying.


\x{2018}Let\x{2019}s leave \x{201c}romantic\x{201d},\x{2019} he said, and stick to one thing at a time. Let me
start again \x{2014} \x{2018}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m afraid,\x{2019} said Tim Burke, \x{2018}that it is time to bring this stimulating
session to a close.\x{2019}


Confound him, thought Mor. He\x{2019}s ending early because he wants to talk to me
about that other matter. Mor sat down. He felt defeated. He could see Mr
Staveley shaking his head and saying something in an undertone to his
neighbour.


Tim Burke stood up and leaned confidentially forward across the table in the
manner of one pretending to be a public speaker. Mor knew his timidity on these
occasions.


\x{201c}I am sorry, friends,\x{2018} said Tim Burke, \x{2019}to terminate this most educational
argument so abruptly, but time, as they say, waits for no man. And Mr Mor will,
I am sure, not be offended if I say that we shall all appreciate a short spell
in the adjacent hostelry during which his words of wisdom may be digested
together with a pint of mild and bitter.\x{2018} The termination of the meeting well
before closing time was one of the few matters on which the Marsington WEA was
in complete agreement.


\x{2018}And with this,\x{2019} said Tim Burke, swinging back upon his heels, \x{2018}we terminate
yet another series of profitable talks from Mr Mor; talks, I may safely say,
from which we have all profited one and all, and which will stimulate us, I
have no doubt, to private studies and reflections in the months that lie ahead,
before our class reassembles here in the autumn. And by which time, if I may be
so indiscreet, we all have hopes that Mr Mor will have been persuaded to fill
another. and a more exalted post for which the people of Marsington think him
to be most eminently fitted. On which delicate topic I say no more - and close
proceedings with a request that you express your grateful thanks to Mr Mor in
the customary manner.\x{2019}


Loud and enthusiastic clapping followed, together with cries of \x{2018}Hear, hear!\x{2019}
Damn! thought Mor. He could see Nan clapping daintily, her eyes cast down. Mor
disliked Tim Burke\x{2019}s public eloquence in any case, and his persona of a student
of politics in particular. When he encountered Tim in the context of the WEA he
was made aware of him as an awkward half-educated man, ill at ease and anxious
to impress. Mor was fond of Tim, there were even things about Tim which he
wished to admire, and he was hurt for him by these appearances. He preferred to
see his friend relaxed in a pub, or business-like in a committee, or best of
all talkative and serene in the dark encrusted interior of the jeweller\x{2019}s shop.
But it was a sad paradox of their relationship that Tim was continually trying
to please Mor by a parade of his scanty learning. To instruct him was
difficult; to have checked him would have been unthinkable. So Mor continued to
be irritated. He had not, however, expected this evening\x{2019}s indiscretion. Just
when Nan needed to be handled especially carefully, Tim had elected to put his
foot in it. Now she\x{2019}ll think I\x{2019}ve arranged everything with Tim behind her back,
thought Mor.


The meeting was breaking up. Mor rose to his feet and stretched. He felt only
tired now, his eagerness dissipated. He hoped that he would be spared a private
interview with Mr Staveley, and moved nearer to Tim Burke for protection. Tim
was gathering up the papers with which he felt it part of his duty as chairman
to strew the table. Tim was an old friend of the Mor family. They had met
through Labour Party activities, when Mor had been teaching in a school on the
south side of London, and Mor and Nan had to some extent taken Tim, who was a
bachelor, under their wing. They saw less of him now than formerly, but Mor
still counted Tim as one of his best friends. He was a trifle older than Mor, a
lean pale man with a pock-marked face and large white hands and rather thin
pale hair of which it was hard to say whether it was yellow or grey. He was
distinguished chiefly by his eyes, of a flecked and streaky blue, and by his
voice. Tim Burke had left Ireland when he was a child, but there was no
mistaking his nationality, although long residence in London and the
frequenting of cinemas had introduced a Cockney intonation into his brogue and
a number of Americanisms among the flowery locutions of his Dublin speech. He
was an accomplished goldsmith and could have been richer if he had wished.


\x{2018}Take it easy, chief, we\x{2019}ll get you out of this if it\x{2019}s the last thing we do!\x{2019}
said Tim, casting a wary eye at Mr Staveley, who was standing by himself in
brooding meditation.


The meetings took place in the Parish Hall, an exceptionally featureless
building whose bright unshaded electric lights had just been turned on. The
evening was still blue and bright outside and through it a large part of the
audience were already making their way towards the Dog and Duck. The rest stood
about on the bare boards, between trestle tables and tubular chairs, talking or
listening or casting uneasy glances towards the speaker, wondering if they
dared to ask him a question and whether they could make their question sound
intelligent. Nan was pulling her gloves on in a very slow way which Mor knew
she adopted when she wished to detach herself in a superior manner from the
surrounding scene. Mor had hoped that Nan might make some friends at this
class, and had originally imagined that perhaps this was why she came. But Nan
had steadfastly refused to get to know anyone or to pay any attention at all to
her fellow-students. If Mor ever referred to a member of the class she would be
unable, or profess to be unable, to remember who it was. She behaved as one
surrounded by her inferiors.


Nan came slowly down the room. Donald had already come forward and was holding
on to the table while Tim Burke gathered up his things. At such moments Donald
seemed to attach himself directly to Tim as if invisible threads joined their
bodies. In passing between them, as he moved now past Tim in the direction of
the door, Mor felt a shock. He stopped close to his son, but he knew that it
was Tim only that Donald was aware of, Tim\x{2019}s gesture and Tim\x{2019}s voice for which
he was waiting. Don\x{2019}s admiration for his friend was another thing which
irritated Mor. It was so totally non-rational. He could not conceive why it
should exist at all.


It was customary after these meetings for Tim to carry off the Mor family and
take them down the road to his shop, where he would offer them refreshment
until it was time to take the train. Tim held, and Mor agreed, that it was not
necessary for Mor to run the gauntlet in the Dog and Duck. Tim now took a quick
look at the scene. Mr Staveley was lifting his head. A look of renewed
determination was on his face.


\x{2018}Out the back!\x{2019} said Tim, and in a moment he had shepherded them out through a
kitchen and an alleyway and round into the road. Marsington was an old village
with a fine broad main street with grassy cobbled edges. The fields about it
had long ago been covered with the red-roofed houses between which the green
Southern Region trains sped at frequent intervals bringing the inhabitants of
Marsington and its neighbouring boroughs to and from their daily work in
central London. The main street now carried one of the most important routes to
the metropolis, and its most conspicuous features were the rival garages whose
brightly lit petrol pumps, glowing upon ancient brick and stone, attracted the
passing motorist. The traffic was incessant. For all that, in the warm twilight
it had a remote and peaceful air, the long broad fa\x{e7}ades of its inns and
spacious houses withdrawn and reassuring.


Tim Burke\x{2019}s shop was a little farther down, in the middle of a row of old
shops, dark below and white above. A black sign swung above the door. T.
Burke. Jeweller and Goldsmith. Tim stood fumbling for his keys. Mor leaned
against the wall. He felt relief at having escaped, mingled with uneasiness at
the presence close beside him of Nan, who was probably angry and preparing for
a sulk. He cast a quick glance sideways at her. Her lips were pursed. A bad
sign. The door gave way and they all stepped into the shop, and stood still
while Tim turned on a lamp in the far corner.


Mor loved Tim\x{2019}s shop. The wooden shutters which covered the shop windows at
night made it quite dark now within and in the dim light of the lamp it looked
like some treasure cave or alchemist\x{2019}s den. Near the front there was a certain
amount of order. Two large counters, each in the form of a glass-topped
cabinet, faced each other near to the street door. But beyond these the long
shop became gradually chaotic. Loaded and untidy shelves, from floor to
ceiling, ran round the three walls, well barricaded by wooden display cases of
various types which stood, often two or three deep, in front of them. Between
these, and in the rest of the available space, there were small tables, some of
them also topped with glass and designed for display purposes. The more
precious jewellery, such of it as was not behind the bars of the shop window,
or hidden in safes in the back room, was laid out in the glass-topped cabinets,
and ranged in fair order. Tim, when he tried, knew how to display his wares. He
loved the stones, and treasured and displayed them according to his own system
of valuation, which did not always accord with their market prices. This week,
Mor noticed, one of the cabinets was given over to a display of opals. Set in
necklaces, ear-rings, and brooches they lay, black ones and white ones, dusky
ones flecked with blue or grey patches, and glowing water opals like drops of
water frozen thick with colour. The other cabinet was full of pearls, the real
ones above, the cultured ones below, and worked golden objects, seals, rings,
and watches. Mor had learnt a certain amount about stones during his long
friendship with Tim. This had been somewhat against his will, since for reasons
which were never very clear to him, he rather disapproved of his friend\x{2019}s
profession.


The front of the shop was orderly. But the cheaper jewellery, which lay behind,
seemed to have got itself into an almost inextricable mess. Within the squat
glass-topped tables especially, ropes of beads were tangled together into a
solid mass of multi-coloured stuff, and bold was the customer who, pointing to
some identifiable patch of colour, said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll have that one.\x{2019} Heaped together
with these were clips and ear-rings, their fellows often irrevocably missing,
brooches, bracelets, buckles, and a miscellany of other small adornments. Tim
Burke was not interested in the cheap stuff. He seemed to acquire his stock
more or less by accident in the course of his trade and dispose of it without
thought or effort to such determined individuals as were prepared to struggle
for what they wanted, often searching the shop from end to end to find the
second ear-ring or the other half of the buckle. The remoter parts of the shop
were also found to contain other objects, varying in value, such as snuff
boxes, pieces of embroidery, foreign coins, pewter mugs, fans, paper-weights,
and silverhilted daggers \x{2014} concerning all of which Tim Burke would declare that
really he had no idea how the creatures got there for he couldn\x{2019}t for the life
of him remember buying them.


Tim Burke brought chairs and his guests sat down in the main part of the shop
between the counters, while he disappeared into the back regions to fetch
glasses and biscuits and the milk which he would offer to Nan and Donald and
the whiskey which he would offer to Mor and himself. Behind the shop was Tim\x{2019}s
workshop and his kitchen, and a whitewashed yard with a single sycamore tree in
it. Above was the small cottage bedroom with its tiny windows looking on to the
street. Mor spread his legs. He was always a bit excited at finding himself
inside a closed-up shop. There was something privileged and unnatural about it.
On these occasions he noticed a similar excitement in his wife and son. In Tim
Burke\x{2019}s shop they were always agitated and restless. They would not sit down
for long, but soon would be roaming about, opening cases and fingering objects.
This behaviour made Mor uneasy. It was as if he were watching his family
stealing. It never failed, however, to delight Tim Burke, who urged them on.


Tim returned with a large tray, which he set on the counter. He stirred some
Ovaltine into a cup of cold milk for Nan, and set the biscuits at her elbow. He
said to Mor, \x{2018}What about giving the boy a shot of whiskey this week?\x{2019} Tim
always said this.


Mor replied, as he always did, \x{2018}Well, not yet I think. What do you say, Don?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t want any,\x{2019} said Donald crossly. Tim passed him the milk.


Mor sat swishing his whiskey round thoughtfully, inside a cut-glass tumbler. He
had decided to outstay his family and return on the <<midnight|13>> train. He wanted badly
to talk with Tim alone. He settled down to wait with impatience.


Nan had got up, and holding her mug of Ovaltine in one hand, began to wander
about in the back of the shop, picking up objects here and there. Mor watched
her uneasily, Tim Burke with a curious half-concealed satisfaction. The single
lamp in the corner cast a golden glow upon the worm-eaten oak shelves, and
Nan\x{2019}s face was bright and dark by turns as she roamed to and fro. Tim Burke,
his head turned back, and the darkened side of his face towards Mor, was marked
by a golden line down his brow and nose. Donald turned his face into the light,
wistful and restless. He rose too and began to walk about, crossing the path of
his mother. The whiskey bottle gleamed upon the tray and the glasses flashed
intermittently in the hands of the two men - while here and there in the shop
the glow of the lamp had found the surface of a precious stone which
transformed it and tossed it back as a glittering splinter of light.


Nan had opened one of the cabinets and was picking over a heap of necklaces.
She seemed unusually gay and animated. Donald was now at the very back of the
shop and had mounted on a chair to examine some shelves. Mor wished that they
would stop. He looked at his watch. It was still early.


Donald had found something. He got down and came rather shyly towards Tim Burke
with an object in his hand. It was a small ivory box. \x{2018}You still haven\x{2019}t sold
this box, Tim,\x{2019} said Donald.


Really! thought Mor, doesn\x{2019}t Don know how Tim always responds to any remark of
this sort - and if he does know, why does he make it?


\x{2018}What, that old thing still there?\x{2019} cried Tim. \x{2018}You have it, my boy, it\x{2019}s no
use to me. No, of course you can\x{2019}t pay for it, the tupenny ha\x{2019}penny thing it
is, I got it in a job lot, I daresay, and it cost me nothing. You\x{2019}ll please me
by keeping it.\x{2018}


\x{2018}What do you want that box for?\x{2019} said Mor sharply. \x{2018}Whatever will you use it
for?\x{2019} He immediately regretted these words. Nan turned quickly towards him, Tim
Burke averted his face, and Don blushed scarlet.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s a nice box,\x{2019} Don said, \x{2018}I shall keep things in it.\x{2019} He sounded childish
in his reply.


Mor wished he could blot out his words. Donald suddenly looked to him extremely
young and touching. If he had been a small child Mor might have taken him in
his arms to erase the words. As it was, there was nothing to be done, and the
words had to stay, wounding both of them. Mor was silent.


Tim, wanting to smooth things over, got up and took his keys and began to open
the drawers at the back of the counter. Tim loved showing things. Usually he
had his waistcoat pockets full of little nicknacks, rings, cigarette lighters,
watches, and such, which he would produce and place suddenly in the hand of his
interlocutor. Mor had often seen him do this in a pub. Now Tim began to rifle
the drawers and show-cases, keeping up a continuous patter as he did so. \x{2018}See
these pearls, the rosy sheen is best, from the Gulf they came, the Persian Gulf
\x{2014} and see how different they look from the cultured ones, your cultured pearl
won\x{2019}t last so well anyhow, though these are good ones indeed \x{2014} and here, how
are these for colour, a pair of sapphires as blue as a cornflower, and if it\x{2019}s
green you want, a fine emerald \x{2014} afine emerald is the king of gems, an emerald
does your eye good, they say, and it will blind a snake. There are no snakes on
the Emerald Isle, just paradise without a serpent \x{2014} and now will you just cast
a look at these rocks, how\x{2019}s that for rocks?\x{2019}


Tim lifted up a diamond necklace and swung it gently to and fro, holding it by
one end. With a rippling movement the stones flashed. Look at the light of it!
he said. \x{2018}It needs a fine woman\x{2019}s neck to show it off. Let me put it on your
wife.\x{2019}


Mor disliked this. It was something Tim often did, and Nan never protested. She
came forward now with docility and took off her coat. She was wearing a
round-necked summer dress. Tim fixed the diamonds round her neck and stood back
to look. The necklace was impressive, but Mor thought it looked out of place.
Nan hurried forward to look at herself in the mirror which was fixed behind one
of the counters.


\x{2018}Diamonds have no mercy,\x{2019} said Tim, \x{2018}they will show up the wearer if they can.
But you have nothing to fear from them. A queen is the one who can wear them,
and a queen you are.\x{2019} He was looking over her shoulder into the mirror. He
often talked in this flowery strain to Nan, but Mor suspected that he was more
aware of the jewels than the woman.


\x{2018}They are dazzling!\x{2019} said Nan. She took the necklace off and held it in her
hand. Then that excitement began to take hold of her which Mor had seen come
upon her in the past in Tim Burke\x{2019}s shop. An animation which he himself could
never seem to inspire glowed in her whole person. She wound the diamonds
loosely round her wrist like a bracelet, and be \x{2014} gan to skip about the shop,
picking up tiny things, trying on an ear-ring and running to see how it looked,
disentangling a string of beads, spreading a fan and fanning herself ostenta \x{2014}
tiously. Donald had resumed his prowling in the back regions. Tim Burke was
still rifling the forward cases, drawing Nan\x{2019}s attention to rings and brooches.
The pinpoint fire of jewels lit up here and there throughout the shop, like
stars that appear and disappear upon a cloudy night.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s time you two went,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Ah, it\x{2019}s early yet,\x{2019} said Tim.


\x{2018}If you don\x{2019}t want to rush, you should leave now,\x{2019} said Mor. I want to stay and
talk shop with Tim.\x{2018} It irritated him to see Nan so gay, and he was aggrieved
that he had offended Don and no way had been allowed him to repair his fault.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t bother to see us to the station,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Donald will protect me.
Don\x{2019}t let Bill miss his train.\x{2019} Serenely she passed into the street. Donald
followed, still clutching his box. Mor contrived to touch his shoulder as he
went by, but got no answering look. The door closed behind them.


\x{2018}Have some more drink, then,\x{2019} said Tim Burke.


Mor handed over his glass. The diamond necklace was lying in a heap on one of
the tables. Mor picked it up and put it back into the drawer. \x{2018}You\x{2019}re very
casual with these valuable things, Tim,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}How much is that worth?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, I don\x{2019}t know,\x{2019} said Tim carelessly. \x{2018}These values are so artificial. Maybe
five hundred guineas.\x{2019}


The thought of Miss Carter flashed immediately into Mor\x{2019}s mind. He had not
thought of her all the evening. With extreme vividness there was present to him
again the absurd scene of the previous day in Bledyard\x{2019}s bedroom. The memory
was disturbing. He wondered if he would tell Tim Burke about it, and decided
not to. He also remembered that it was tomorrow that he was to have lunch with
Mr Everard, in the company of Miss Carter and Bledyard. Mor felt interest at
the thought of this meal, which was bound to offer some curious features. The
mood of gloom and emptiness which had possessed him earlier in the evening
seemed to be lifting. Once more he felt a sense of purpose and direction, a
sense of the future.


He was about to speak to Tim Burke about the matter which was to be settled
between them when Tim said, \x{2018}I wish you\x{2019}d take something for the wife. No,
don\x{2019}t take on, I\x{2019}ll not offer you the diamonds! What about these ear-rings? She
cared for them, I could see. She put them on herself this time, and last time
too. And they become her. Why not take them? They\x{2019}re but cheap things that I\x{2019}ll
never sell. I\x{2019}ll wrap them up for you now.\x{2019}


The ear-rings were blue, as far as Mor could see of lapis lazuli, and did not
seem to him to be especially cheap. He checked Tim, who was producing tissue
paper and a little box.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re too good to me. No, said Mor.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s your wife I want to be good to!\x{2019} said Tim.


\x{2018}Well, no, you mustn\x{2019}t really,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}We\x{2019}ve already taken one thing off
you this evening. Another time, Tim. Now, listen, we must talk business.\x{2019}


\x{2018}All right,\x{2019} said Tim, reluctantly replacing the ear-rings. \x{2018}Is it yes or no?\x{2019}


Mor sat forward stiffly in his chair. In the face of this rather fierce
question he suddenly realized that he was, that he had been perhaps for some
time, in the position of the coy maiden who has made up her mind but who puts
up a show of resistance merely in order to be persuaded. Mor hated vain shows.
He felt that his wishes had crystallized. He felt it with a certain surprise
and with an intimation of joy. He said, \x{2018}The answer is yes, of course. But
there are a number of difficulties.\x{2019}


Tim turned on him. \x{2018}Yes, is it?\x{2019} he cried. \x{2018}Holding out on us, were you? And I
thought you would surely say no, and no again for the next months!\x{2019}


\x{2018}You seem disappointed!\x{2019} said Mor, smiling faintly.


\x{2018}Disappointed! cried Tim. \x{2019}I could embrace you! Here, have some more whiskey,
and if I could dissolve a pearl in it I would!\x{2018}


\x{2018}Not so fast,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I want to carry out this plan, and I have now, I must
say, absolutely no doubt but that I will carry it out. All the same, to throw up
my job and be a parliamentary candidate at my time of life \x{2014} it\x{2019}s not all that
simple. I suppose there\x{2019}s no doubt I\x{2019}d get in?\x{2019}


\x{2018}None, me boy,\x{2019} said Tim Burke. \x{2018}Ten thousand majority last time. Saint Francis
wasn\x{2019}t a surer candidate for heaven than you for Westminster.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, then,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}there are a lot of financial considerations. I won\x{2019}t
bother you with these just now. And St Bride\x{2019}s must be squared. I\x{2019}m not giving
them much notice. But that leaves the gravest thing of all, and that\x{2019}s my wife.
You know that Nan is very much opposed to the idea, she won\x{2019}t even hear it
spoken of.\x{2019}


Tim looked grave. \x{2018}I\x{2019}d gathered,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}that she\x{2019}s against it. But she\x{2019}ll
come round surely.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I suppose she will,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}She\x{2019}ll have to. But it won\x{2019}t be easy. Why did
you mention it tonight, by the way, you fathead? Nothing annoys Nan as much as
the notion that people are making plans without consulting her. I\x{2019}d hoped you
might have some influence on her - only now she\x{2019}ll think we\x{2019}ve been plotting
this for months. Do you think it would be any use if you talked to her alone?\x{2019}


Tim looked down. \x{2018}No,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}it would be no use. You must handle it. But,
as you say, she will agree because she must. I\x{2019}m glad to hear at last that
courage in you. If you really will a thing, Mor, that thing will be. We shall
all support you in every way possible. But this thing you must do for yourself
alone.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, it will be done,\x{2019} said Mor. He felt deeply encouraged by Tim Burke.
\x{2018}Only not a word about this to anyone for the moment. I shall have to discuss
my resignation with Mr Everard. And I shall have to persuade Nan. When that\x{2019}s
done I\x{2019}ll let you know and then you can tell the Party and the Press.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Splendid!\x{2019} cried Tim Burke, his eyes shining, his glass held aloft. \x{2018}When shall
I see you?\x{2019}


\x{2018}We\x{2019}ll talk of it again, said Mor, \x{2019}when, now? What about the day of the House
Match - you\x{2019}re coming over then, aren\x{2019}t you? It\x{2019}s my house against Prewett\x{2019}s
this time.\x{2018} Invited originally by Donald, Tim Burke usually came over to St
Bride\x{2019}s for the final summer House Match, which was also something of a social
occasion. \x{2019}I hope I\x{2019}ll be able to give you the all clear,\x{2018} said Mor, \x{2019}and we
can go ahead. But till then, not a word!\x{2018}


\x{2018}You must go for your train,\x{2019} said Tim Burke. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll see you down the road.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You know,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}perhaps after all I\x{2019}ll take those ear-rings for Nan.
Only you must let me pay something for them.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ll not hear of it!\x{2019} said Tim. \x{2018}You oblige me by taking them. Here, I\x{2019}ll pack
them up nicely, handy to give. Now please me, Mor, in this way too.\x{2019}


Mor protested, smiled, and finally put the ear-rings in his pocket. They left
the shop together.",

            "WHEN
Mor awoke next morning he found, with his first W consciousness, that he felt
extremely light-hearted. It was as if a good angel had passed in the night. For
a while he lay marvelling vaguely at his condition. Then it came back to him
that of course he had now at last decided. In the light of the actual
decision the moves necessary to carry it out seemed very much easier. What was
necessary was possible. Recalling the previous evening, and asking himself what
exactly had happened, it seemed to Mor that Tim Burke had suddenly been able to
communicate to him a new sort of confidence. He wondered why. His thoughts
switched to Miss Carter, whom he would be seeing at lunch-time today; and then
it seemed to him that in some strange way it was Miss Carter who had been
responsible for his ability to decide, having given him, by her mere existence,
a fresh sense of power and possibility. Mor mused for a while upon this
mystery. Eccentric people, he concluded, were good for conventional people,
simply because they made them able to conceive of everything being quite
different. This gave them a sense of freedom. Nothing is more educational, in
the end, than the mode of being of other people.


The morning passed quickly, and <<a little before one o\x{2018}clock|6>> Mor set out on his
bicycle for Mr Everard\x{2019}s luncheon party. In the bicycle basket he had placed a
small packet which contained the complete works of Demoyte and which in
accordance with his promise he was taking to Miss Carter. A cycle track, for
the use of masters only, led down the hill through the wood towards the
neglected garden of the Headmaster\x{2019}s house. As Mor free-wheeled through the
trees, his bicycle bumping about agreeably on the undulating track, he
experienced a profound sense of well-being and general benevolence. The weather
was still extremely sunny, but today there was a soft breeze which seemed to
bring, from not so very far away in the south, the freshness of the sea.


Benevolently Mor thought about Mr Everard. There came back to him the remark
which Miss Carter had made about his having no malice in him. It was true. Evvy
had no malice. In some sense of the word Evvy was undoubtedly a good man. He
was well-intentioned and unselfish; indeed he seemed utterly to lack the
conception of getting anything for himself. Evvy\x{2019}s life was not constructed, it
seemed to Mor, in such a way as to leave any place in it where he could store
things for himself. Most people\x{2019}s lives had a sort of bulge or recess in which
they piled up their selfish acquisitions, their goods, their fame, their power.
Evvy had no such private place. He lived in the open, with simplicity, seeming
to lack altogether the concepts of vanity or ambition, weaknesses which he was
equally incapable of harbouring within himself or of recognizing in others. If
he hurt people, it was through indecision or sheer obtuseness and not through
any preference for having things his own way, since his own way was something
which had never really developed.


Doubtless such a character ought not to be in a position of power. All the
same, it occurred to Mor more forcibly than ever before, there was something
impressive about Mr Everard. And he wondered, too, how it was that while Mr
Everard was so gentle and unselfish, and Mr Demoyte so much the reverse, he
felt deep love and tenderness for Demoyte and could hardly summon up any
affection at all for poor Evvy. Mor wondered whether this reflected badly on
his own character. Here was another mystery. He seemed to be surrounded by
them. As Mor thought this, he found that it was rather a pleasant thought; and
as he sailed on down the hill the soothing sense of mystery became transformed
into the more precisely pleasurable anticipation of meeting Miss Carter again.


The approach to Mr Everard\x{2019}s house was by a gravel drive, which connected with
the main road, and on to which the cycle track eventually emerged at right
angles. Mor dismounted at the drive, as the coarse gravel was not pleasant for
cycling on, and pushed his bicycle up towards the white house. The yellow
gravel expanse in front of the house was dotted with concrete tubs which
contained geraniums and between which visiting cars had to pick their way. Mor
saw that a car was standing at the door. He saw as he drew closer that it was a
long dark green Riley. He looked at it with desultory admiration. Mor had never
been able to dream of affording a car. He took his bicycle round to the side of
the house, and then came back into the entrance hall. He hung his coat up on a
peg and mounted the stairs to the big room which served Mr Everard as both
drawing-room and dining-room.


As he entered, Mor saw that Bledyard and Miss Carter had both arrived. He was
sorry at this, as he would have liked to have witnessed the encounter. They
were both standing about in silence, Miss Carter leaning against the
mantelpiece and Bledyard looking out of the window. Mr Everard was not famous
for putting his guests at their ease.


He came forward now to welcome Mor. \x{2018}Bill, I\x{2019}m so glad you\x{2019}ve come. Now we can
have some lunch. I believe you know Miss Carter, and here is Mr Bledyard. You
left your coat downstairs? Good, good.\x{2019}


Mr Everard had a plump healthy face of the kind which passes imperceptibly from
boyhood into middle age without any observable intermediate phase. He always
wore a tweed suit and a dog collar. His expression was habitually gentle, his
eyes doe-like. His hair was light brown and rather fluffy and unruly. As a boy
he must have been pretty; as a middle-aged man he appeared candid and disarming
to those who did not see him as looking stupid.


\x{2018}Hello, sir,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Sorry I\x{2019}m a bit late.\x{2019} Evvy had once tried to persuade
Mor to call him by his Christian name, but Mor could not bring himself to do
so.


Mor cast a quick glance at Miss Carter, and she nodded to him. She was wearing
a close-fitting blue silk dress which made her look smarter and more feminine
than Mor had yet seen her look. She seemed very preoccupied. Clearly what
preoccupied her was the presence of Bledyard. Mor observed this with an
unpleasant pang which he was surprised to identify as a sort of jealousy. He
would have liked Miss Carter to have shown more interest in his own arrival.
His mind reverted again to the odd scene in Bledyard\x{2019}s room. He felt uneasy,
and turned towards Bledyard, who still presented his back to the company.


\x{2018}Come along now, lunch-time!\x{2019} said Evvy. He had a rich deep public school voice
which could make any statement seem portentous. He began to usher his guests
down the room towards the dining-table, which was laid at the other end. In
Demoyte\x{2019}s day things had been far otherwise; but now the furry den-like
interior had gone, and the room seemed longer and lighter, and prints of the
French impressionists hung upon the walls from which Demoyte\x{2019}s rugs had been
stripped.


\x{2018}Mr Bledyard, you sit here,\x{2019} said Evvy. \x{2018}Oh, Miss Carter, please, you here, and
Bill by the sideboard. You can help me with the plates, Bill\x{2019}


Mr Everard believed keenly that the servants should be spared. He had
introduced the policy as far as he could in the face of protesting parents into
the school regime: cafeteria lunches, and the boys to make their beds, clean
their shoes, and wash up twice a week. In his own household Evvy was able to
proceed unchecked, especially as he had refused to draw the considerable
entertainment allowance which Demoyte had established as part of the
Headmaster\x{2019}s emoluments. Except for extremely ceremonial occasions, there was
no waiting at Mr Everard\x{2019}s table. His daily help, who disappeared shortly
before <<one|9c:1>>, left behind such hot or cold offerings as she thought fit for his
guests to consume, and Evvy presented these as best he could. The offering
today, Mor saw with some relief, was cold. One blessing was that meals with
Evvy were at least brief; no dawdling with sherry beforehand, or lingering over
wine or liqueurs, prolonged the episode which proceeded usually with a
consoling briskness.


Evvy handed the plates of cold meat and salad from the sideboard, and Mor
distributed them, and then poured out water for the guests. Miss Carter seemed
a little paralysed. Bledyard sat as usual quite at his ease in saying nothing,
moving his large head gently to and fro, as if he had just had it fixed on and
was trying to see if it was firm. Bledyard\x{2019}s age was hard to determine. Mor
suspected him of being quite young, that is in his thirties. If he had not
looked quite so odd he might have been handsome. He had a great head of dark
hair which was perfectly straight and worn a little long. It soughed to and fro
as he moved or talked. He had a large moon-like face and a bull neck, big
luminous eyes like a night creature, and a coarse nose. His mouth was formless
and sometimes hung open. His teeth were good, but were usually concealed behind
the massy flesh of his lips. He rarely smiled. His hands were big too, and
moved about in slow gestures. Bledyard had an impediment in his speech which he
had partly overcome by the expedient of repeating some words twice as he
talked. This he did with a sort of slow deliberation which made his utterance
ludicrous. It had long ago been discovered that a lecture from Bledyard reduced
the whole school to hysterical laughter within a few minutes - and, rather it
seemed to Bledyard\x{2019}s chagrin, he had been rationed to one art lecture a year,
which he gave annually late in the summer term.


Evvy, whose ability to think of only one thing at a time made him far from
ideal as a Headmaster, having satisfied himself that each of his guests had a
plate of food and a glass of water, addressed himself to conversation. \x{2018}Well,
Miss Carter,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}and how are we getting on with the picture? Soon be
done, will it?\x{2019}


Miss Carter looked very shocked. \x{2018}Heavens,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t started yet.
I\x{2019}ve made some pencil sketches of Mr Demoyte, but I haven\x{2019}t yet decided what
position to paint him in, or what clothes or expression to give him. Indeed, I
am still quite at a loss.\x{2019} Her shyness made her seem foreign.


\x{2018}What would you say, sir, said Mor wickedly, \x{2019}was Mr Demoyte\x{2019}s most typical
expression?\x{2018} He wanted to incite Evvy to be malicious for once.


Mr Everard considered this, and then said, \x{2018}I would say a sort of rather
suspicious pondering.\x{2019}


This was not bad, thought Mor. Accurate and not uncharitable. His opinion of
Evvy went up a point. He glanced at Bledyard. Bledyard was sitting abstracted
from the scene, as if he were a diner at a restaurant who had by accident to
share a table with three complete strangers. He got on with his meal. Mor
envied Bledyard\x{2019}s total disregard of convention. He agreed with Demoyte that
Bledyard was undoubtedly a man. There was something exceedingly real about him.
He made Evvy seem flimsy by comparison, a sort of fiction. Miss Carter was very
real too. Am I real? Mor wondered with a strange pang.


Mr Everard was now touchingly anxious to make conversation. His forehead
wrinkled with the effort, and he turned a worried face towards Miss Carter
between every mouthful. \x{2018}I believe you have lived abroad a great deal,\x{2019} he
said, \x{2018}and that you are quite a stranger to this island, Miss Carter?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes, I have lived mostly in France,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I was brought up in
the South of France.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Ah, the shores of the Mediterranean!\x{2019} said Evvy, \x{2018}that \x{201c}grand object of
travel\x{201d}, as Dr Johnson said. You were fortunate, Miss Carter.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t know,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, turning seriously towards him. \x{2018}I am not sure
that the South of France is a good place for a child. It is so hot and dry. I
remember my childhood as a time of terrible dryness, as if it were a long
period of drought.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Ah, but you were by the sea, were you not?\x{2019} said Evvy.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}but a melancholy sea as I remember it. A tideless
sea. I can recall, as a child, seeing pictures in English children\x{2019}s books of
boys and girls playing on the sand and making sandcastles \x{2014} and I tried to play
on my sand. But a Mediterranean beach is not a place for playing on. It is
dirty and very dry. The tides never wash the sand or make it firm. When I tried
to make a sandcastle, the sand would just run away between my fingers. It was
too dry to hold together. And even if I poured sea water over it, the sun would
dry it up at once.\x{2019}


This speech caught Bledyard\x{2019}s attention. He stopped eating and looked at Miss
Carter. For a moment he looked as if he might speak. Then he decided not to,
and went on eating. Mor looked at Miss Carter too. She seemed to be overcome
with confusion, either at the length of her speech or at Bledyard\x{2019}s attention. Mor
was both touched and irritated.


Mr Everard pursued his conversational way relentlessly. \x{2018}You are an only child,
I believe, Miss Carter?


\x{2018}Unfortunately, yes,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


\x{2018}And did you always live with your father? You must have led quite a social
existence.\x{2019}


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}my father was rather a solitary. My mother died when I
was very young. I lived alone with my father, until early this year, that is,
when he died.\x{2019}


There was a silence. Evvy toyed with the remains of his meal, trying to think
what to say next. Mor stole a glance at Miss Carter, and then sat petrified.
She had closed her eyes, and two tears had escaped from them and were coursing
down her cheeks.


Mor was pierced to the heart. How little imagination I have! he thought. I knew
she had just lost her father, but it didn\x{2019}t even occur to me to wonder whether
she was grieving. He also tried to think, in vain, of something to say.


Bledyard saw the tears and threw down his knife and fork. \x{2018}Miss Carter,\x{2019} said
Bledyard, leaning forward, \x{2018}I am a great admirer admirer of your father\x{2019}s
work.\x{2019}


Mor\x{2019}s heart warmed to Bledyard. Miss Carter dashed away the tears very quickly.
Evv hadn\x{2019}t even noticed them. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m so glad,\x{2019} she said. She sounded glad.


\x{2018}Did your father teach you to paint?\x{2019} asked Bledyard.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}he was quite a tyrant. I feel as if I was born with a
paint brush in my hand. I can\x{2019}t remember a time when I wasn\x{2019}t painting, with my
father standing beside me.


Evvy had taken advantage of this shift of the conversational burden to rise and
remove the plates. Mor helped him. It was stewed fruit and ice-cream to follow.
The ice-cream was rather melted.


\x{2018}In fact, you can\x{2019}t teach teach children to paint,\x{2019} said Bledyard. \x{2018}They
already know how to paint. It is the only art that comes naturally to all human
beings.\x{2019}


\x{2018}What about music?\x{2019} said Mor. He wanted to get into the conversation.


\x{2018}I know,\x{2019} said Miss Carter simultaneously. \x{2018}My father didn\x{2019}t teach me in that
sense till I was quite old. But then he was very severe. I can remember being
made to paint the same thing again and again.\x{2019}


\x{2018}But they forget it later,\x{2019} said Bledyard. It was characteristic of Bledyard s
conversation that he did not always attend to remarks made by his interlocutor,
but pursued his own train of thought aloud. This was sometimes confusing until
one got used to it. \x{2018}They forget how forget how to paint at about the time when
they lose their innocence. They have to learn all over again after that. What
does that prove? Painting is man\x{2019}s most fundamental mode of apprehension. We
are incarnate incarnate creatures, our mode of knowledge is sensible, and
vision is sovereign over the other senses. Before man could speak he could
draw.\x{2019} It was also characteristic of Bledyard that whereas he might sit completely
silent for long periods at a social gathering, if once he did start to talk he
would dominate the conversation.


Miss Carter was not embarrassed by Bledyard. She watched him with lips parted.
She clearly found him fascinating. Mor set aside his plate. The ice-cream was
tasteless. He hated ice-cream anyway.


\x{2018}If you will excuse me,\x{2019} said Mr Everard, \x{2018}I will start making the coffee. It
takes a little time to prepare in my special coffee-machine. No, no, stay where
you are. You haven\x{2019}t finished your fruit, I see. Cheese and biscuits are on the
table, so do help yourselves if you want any. I shall just be getting the
coffee quite quietly.\x{2019}


Evvy escaped from the table. He had lately acquired a coffee-machine, from
which Mor had had great hopes; however, since Evvy never put even half of the
correct amount of coffee into the machine, the results were just as deplorable
as before.


\x{2018}You think we give significance to the world by representing it?\x{2019} said Miss
Carter to Bledyard. \x{2018}No, thank you,\x{2019} she said to Mor, who was offering her a
biscuit.


Mor gloomily undid the silver paper from a limp triangle of processed cheese.


\x{2018}Representation is an ambiguous word,\x{2019} said Bledyard. \x{2018}To represent something
something is a task which must be undertaken with humility. What is the first
and most fundamental truth which an incarnate being must realize? That he is a
thing, a material object in space and time, and that as such he will come to an
end. What is the next next truth which he must realize? That he is related on
the one hand to God, who is not a thing, and on the other hand to other things
which surround him. Now these other things things,\x{2019} Bledyard raised his spoon
to emphasize his words, \x{2018}are some of them mere things, and others of them
God-related things like himself.\x{2019}


Over by the hearth, Mr Everard seemed to be having some trouble with the
coffee-machine. Mor saw with foreboding that he seemed to be pouring in a lot
of water at the last moment.


\x{2018}Shall we repair?\x{2019} said Evvy. \x{2018}The coffee is almost ready.\x{2019} Bledyard, Mor, and
Miss Carter rose from the table.


\x{2018}It is distinctly indicated indicated in the Bible,\x{2019} said Bledyard, \x{2018}that the
works of nature are placed upon this earth for the benefit of man. Is that not
so, Mis-ter Ever-ard?\x{2019}


Evvy jumped at being suddenly appealed to. \x{2018}That is so, Mr Bledyard,\x{2019} he said.
\x{2018}Er, Miss Carter, pray sit here. Do you take milk in your coffee?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes, please,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


\x{2018}It is also the case,\x{2019} said Bledyard, \x{2018}that the Bible commands commands us to
abstain from the creation of graven images.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I hope you don\x{2019}t mind the milk being cold, Miss Carter,\x{2019} said Mr Everard.
\x{2018}This is rather a bachelor establishment, I\x{2019}m afraid.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Thank you,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}I like it better like that. Only a little,
please.\x{2019}


\x{2018}So that we would expect,\x{2019} said Bledyard, \x{2018}to find the early Church the early
Church in two minds upon the matter of religious painting and sculpture.
However, it seems to be the case that the fathers felt no special impediment
impediment to representational art, and very soon in the history of the Church
we find worship and praise naturally taking the form of representation, as in
the noble mosaics at Ravenna.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Ah yes, how very fine they are!\x{2019} said Mr Everard. \x{2018}Have you been to Ravenna,
Miss Carter?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes, I often went there with my father,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I know the mosaics
very well.\x{2019}


\x{2018}The early Church the early Church,\x{2019} said Bledyard, accepting his coffee-cup
from Mr Everard, \x{2018}does not seem to have made any distinction distinction
between the representation of the works of nature and the representation of
human forms. So near so near in time to the source of light, their vision was
informed by a reverence which penetrated even their method of depicting the
human face. However, when we are overtaken by the secular spirit of the
Renaissance, we find we find a more exclusive interest in the human shape as
such, conjoined alas with a total loss of that insight and that reverence.\x{2019}


\x{2018}What do you think of the coffee this time, Bill?\x{2019} said Mr Everard. \x{2018}A bit
better, isn\x{2019}t it?\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s very good, sir,\x{2019} said Mor, pouring the insipid stuff hastily down his
throat.


\x{2018}Are you suggesting,\x{2019} said Miss Carter to Bledyard, \x{2018}that we should treat the
representation of the human form in some way quite differently from the
presentation of other things?\x{2019}


\x{2018}As you know,\x{2019} said Bledyard, \x{2018}we find it natural to make the distinction. Only
we do not make it absolutely absolutely enough. When confronted with an object
which is not a human being we must of course treat it reverently. We must, if
we paint it, attempt to show what it is like in itself, and not treat it as a
symbol of our own moods and wishes. The great painter the great painter is he
who is humble enough in the presence of the object to attempt merely to
show what the object is like. But this merely, in painting, is
everything.\x{2019}


How I agree with you! said Miss Carter. Distantly from the school the
<<two-fifteen|5k:1>> bell was heard ringing.


\x{2018}But,\x{2019} said Bledyard, \x{2018}when we are in the presence of another human being, we
are not confronted simply by an object \x{2014} \x{2019} He paused. \x{2018}We are confronted by
God.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Are you teaching the first period, Bill?\x{2019} said Mr Everard. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry, I
should have asked you earlier.\x{2019}


\x{2018}No, I\x{2019}m not, in fact,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Do you mean that we ought not to paint other human beings? asked Miss Carter.


\x{2018}Each must find out his own way,\x{2019} said Bledyard. \x{2018}If it were possible, ah, if
it were possible to treat a head as if it were a spherical material object! But
who is great enough to do this?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t see why one should attempt to treat a head as a spherical material
object,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}We know what a head is, and we know what it is to
understand another person by looking into his eyes. I don\x{2019}t see why the painter
should be obliged to forget all this.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Who is worthy to understand another person?\x{2019} said Bledyard. He spoke with no
more and no less intensity than at the start. He answered Mor\x{2019}s words, but his
eyes were fixed upon Miss Carter. \x{2018}Upon an ordinary material thing we can look
with reverence, wondering simply at its being. But when we look upon a human
face, we interpret it by what we are ourselves. And what are we?\x{2019} Bledyard
spread out his two hands, one of which held the untasted cup of coffee.


\x{2018}I agree with much of what you say,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, speaking quickly before
Bledyard could interrupt her. \x{2018}Our paintings are a judgement upon ourselves. I
know in what way, and how deplorably, my own paintings show what I am. But
still I think \x{2014} \x{2019}


\x{2018}It is a fact,\x{2019} said Bledyard, \x{2018}that we cannot really observe really observe
our betters. Vices and peculiarities are easy to portray. But who can look
reverently enough upon another human face? The true portrait painter should be
a saint - and saints have other things to do than paint portraits. Religious
painters often understand this obscurely. Representations representations of
Our Lord are usually not presented as if they were pictures of an individual.
Pictures of Our Lord usually affect us by the majesty of the conception, and
not by any particular expression or gesture. Where the picture is
individualized, as in Caravaggio\x{2019}s rendering of Christ at Emmaus, we are
shocked. We should be equally shocked at any representation of a human face.\x{2019}


Mr Everard was looking at his watch and shifting restlessly. He began to say
something, but Miss Carter got in first. \x{2018}What you say is so very abstract, Mr
Bledyard. One might think beforehand that it is impossible to depict a human
face with sufficient reverence \x{2014} and perhaps in some absolute sense sufficient
reverence there never is. But if we consider paintings by Rembrandt, by Goya,
by Tintoretto, by \x{2014} \x{2019}


Miss Carter\x{2019}s voice was rising higher. She was becoming extremely excited.
Bledyard tried to interrupt her. Mr Everard uttered some half-articulate sound.


Mor, speaking very loudly, managed to drown them all. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve got to go now, I\x{2019}m
afraid.\x{2019} A sudden silence followed.


Bledyard laid his cup down and stood up. He turned to Mr Everard. \x{2018}Thank you,\x{2019}
he said, \x{2018}for a very pleasant lunch, Mis-ter Ever-ard. I have enjoyed meeting
Miss Miss Carter. I hope I have not stayed stayed too long.\x{2019}


Miss Carter stood up. She was looking flushed and agitated. She said, \x{2018}Thank
you very much indeed \x{2014} it was so kind of you. I have enjoyed it.\x{2019}


Evvy was looking ready to drop with exhaustion. They all walked down into the
hall. As Mor descended the stairs he saw the little packet of books which he
had left on the hall table. He pounced on it and took the opportunity to hand
it quickly to Miss Carter. \x{2018}The books I promised you.\x{2019}


Miss Carter took them distractedly and said, \x{2018}Oh, thank you,\x{2019} hardly looking at
him. Mor cursed Bledyard. They all came out on to the gravel in front of the
house. The blazing heat of the afternoon rose from the earth in waves.


\x{2018}Oh, Bill,\x{2019} said Evvy, \x{2018}do make my apologies to your wife. I quite meant to
invite her, I really meant to, but you know how inefficient I am. At this time
of term my memory quite goes. But do tell her, will you, and make my excuses.


\x{2018}I will certainly,\x{2019} said Mor, who had no intention of passing this idiotic
apology on to Nan. He knew how it would be received.


\x{2018}And don\x{2019}t fail to persuade her to make that little speech for us at the
dinner,\x{2019} said Evvy.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ll try,\x{2019} said Mor. He put his hand up to shield his brow from the sun.


\x{2018}Well, I\x{2019}m so glad you came,\x{2019} said Evvy, \x{2018}it was so nice. Now I really must get
back to my tasks. End of term in sight, you know. Good-bye, Miss Carter, we
shall meet again soon - and thank you so much for coming.\x{2019} He retreated quickly
into the house and shut the door.


The three guests stood for a moment undecidedly in the drive. Mor thought, if
Bledyard says another word I shall crown him. Miss Carter was evidently
thinking the same. She scraped the gravel with her feet and said hurriedly, \x{2018}I
must be going too. I suppose I can\x{2019}t give either of you a lift back to the
school?\x{2019} The invitation did not sound very whole-hearted.


Mor realized with a shock of surprise that the big green Riley which stood at
the door must belong to Miss Carter. It seemed to him amazing that such a small
woman should own such a large car. The next moment it seemed to him delightful.


Bledyard said at once, \x{2018}No, thank you, Miss Carter. I have my bicycle bicycle
here. I shall go on that. So I shall say good-bye.\x{2019} He disappeared abruptly
round the side of the house.


Mor was left alone with Miss Carter. He thought very quickly. He was suddenly
overwhelmed by a most intense wish to ride away in Miss Carter\x{2019}s car. He said,
\x{2018}Yes, please, I\x{2019}d be very grateful for a lift.\x{2019}


He opened the door for her, and then jumped in himself on the other side. Miss
Carter stowed the parcel of books in the back seat. Then she put on some dark
glasses and wrapped a multi-coloured handkerchief round her head. After that
she started the engine. As they began to move slowly forward a curious
apparition passed them. It was Bledyard, riding his own bicycle and pushing
Mor\x{2019}s. He went by at speed, with head down, and turned off the drive on to the
cycle track that led back to the school.


The impudence of him! thought Mor. He hoped that Miss Carter would not realize
the significance of the spectacle. He feared that she would. Then suddenly he
began to laugh aloud.


\x{2018}What is it?\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


Mor went on laughing. \x{2018}What a droll fellow Bledyard is!\x{2019} he said.

Riley turned on to the main road.


I\x{2019}m so sorry,\x{2018} said Miss Carter, \x{2019}if I sounded rather short when I offered you
the lift. I was afraid Mr Bledyard might accept. I really couldn\x{2019}t have endured
his company for another moment.\x{2018}


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s all right,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}The first hour is the worst. One does get used
to him in time. There\x{2019}s something very remarkable about Bledyard.\x{2019}


\x{2018}He is certainly remarkable,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}but infuriating. I\x{2019}m sure he
isn\x{2019}t mad - but he has a characteristic of mad people. He argues insistently
and coherently and with the appearance of logic - but somehow it\x{2019}s just all
wrong, there\x{2019}s some colossal distortion.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I know,\x{2019} said Mor, thinking suddenly of his wife. \x{2018}Yet Bledyard commands
respect. One has to ask oneself now and then whether it isn\x{2019}t one\x{2019}s own vision
that\x{2019}s distorted.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}Oh dear!\x{2019} She stopped the car abruptly. They were
almost outside the main entrance to the school. Do you mind if we talk for a
minute or two? I seem to have brought you back already. I really feel knocked
out by that conversation. It\x{2019}s a great relief to be able to talk to you.


\x{2018}Not at all,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m in no hurry. I haven\x{2019}t anything special to do this
afternoon.\x{2019} He felt pleased at what she had said.


\x{201c}Well, in that case,\x{2018} said Miss Carter, \x{2019}perhaps we could drive on a bit. I
know it\x{2019}s very naughty, and I ought to be working, but I really must have some
air. I expect you need some too. I\x{2019}ll bring you back almost at once.\x{2018} She let
in the clutch and the Riley glided off again.


Mor immediately began to feel guilty. Although he was not actually teaching,
there were in fact a lot of things that he ought to be doing that afternoon.
All the same, it was so delightful to fly along in the car, the still summer
air changed to a warm breeze, and the noisy menacing main road to an open
obedient highway that for once really led somewhere. Mor saw that they had
crossed the railway bridge without his even noticing the hill. All this was
good for him, he felt, after the strained atmosphere of Mr Everard\x{2019}s
drawing-room. It would be all right to go a little way.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m really upset by that man,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. She was very serious. It was
clear that she could think about nothing but Bledyard.


\x{2018}Well then, confound him!\x{2019} said Mor, laughing, \x{2018}if he upset you!\x{2019}


\x{2018}No, no,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}as you said yourself, he may be right - or rather,
I don\x{2019}t actually think he\x{2019}s right, but it all comes as a sudden \x{2014} reproach. I
take my art very seriously. Indeed, now it\x{2019}s all I have. I know I\x{2019}m
quite good. I believe I shall be better. But this man makes me feel that
everything I do must be rotten. In a way it is - rotten, rotten, I know.\x{2019} She
said the word as a foreigner would say it, giving it significance. She was
speaking excitedly again, her small hand gesturing above the steering-wheel.
And as she spoke she accelerated. The sandy edges of the main road flashed
madly past and a number of cars were left behind. In a moment the speedometer
was at seventy. Miss Carter seemed scarcely to notice. Mor held on to his seat.


\x{2018}Look,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}and do slow down. I don\x{2019}t often travel in cars. As Bledyard
said, each must find his own way. And as you said, his remarks are too
abstract. The answer to him is the works themselves. And your answer is your
work. When you\x{2019}re not distracted by theories, when you\x{2019}re alone with the work,
you know what you have to do, and at least in what direction perfection lies.\x{2019}
Mor spoke earnestly. He felt that here too was something to be taught,
something to be understood. And he too had something which he must try to
understand. He wanted to continue the conversation.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m so sorry,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. She put the brake on, and they proceeded for
a little way in silence. By this time they had reached the outskirts of
Marsington. The car stopped at the traffic lights.


\x{2018}Turn left here,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Let\x{2019}s get off the main road.\x{2019} He didn\x{2019}t want to go
past Tim Burke\x{2019}s shop.


They turned, and in a moment or two they were in a country lane. The murmur of
the traffic diminished to silence. The leaves met over their heads. Miss Carter
slowed the car down. \x{2018}This is a surprise,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}that to escape is so
easy. I wonder if there is a river anywhere near here? I feel so hot - it would
be wonderful to see some water. I suppose it\x{2019}s too far to go to the sea?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, much too far!\x{2019} said Mor, scandalized. It\x{2019}s rather a dry country about
here, but I expect I could find some sort of little river for you. Let me see.
Yes, if you drive on another few miles there should be one. Drive on anyhow,
and I\x{2019}ll recognize the way when I see it.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Are you sure I\x{2019}m not keeping you from anything?\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}You must
say as soon as you want to go back. Or perhaps I could take you somewhere, or
go and collect something for you? I believe you said you hadn\x{2019}t got a car.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}and in fact you could help me by dropping me in a
little while quite near here. There\x{2019}s someone I ought to see, and since we\x{2019}re
so close I might as well go this afternoon. It\x{2019}ll save me a railway journey.
But let\x{2019}s find your river first. It won\x{2019}t take long.\x{2019} It had occurred to Mor
that since he was practically in Marsington he might call again on Tim Burke.
In his exalted state of mind of the previous evening he had failed to have a
sufficiently precise conversation with Tim. He ought to be, Mor thought, more
fully briefed about the financial aspect of the enterprise before raising the
question with either Nan or Evvy. Nan would be certain to make some objections
on the grounds of finance \x{2014} and in order to convince her his answers must be
exact. Another talk with Tim would be exceedingly useful.


\x{2018}Good,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. The road opened before them and she let the car take
it at a rush. Mor\x{2019}s recent nervousness was clearly far from her mind. From the
expression on her face he suspected she was still thinking of Bledyard\x{2019}s
reproach. He saw her eyes side view behind the dark glasses and they were large
with thought. She held the steering-wheel lightly with one small hand, and the
other arm lay along the edge of the window. A grove of pine trees swept past
behind her head, and an odour of sand and resin filled the car. It was indeed a
dry country.


It occurred to Mor that he had told Nan he would be back for tea. He said to
Miss Carter, \x{2018}Would you mind stopping if you see a telephone-box? I must just
ring my wife to tell her what time I\x{2019}ll be back.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Certainly,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. A telephone-box appeared very soon, and she
stopped the car.


Mor went into the box and fumbled for his sixpence. A curious stillness
surrounded him after the sound of the engine. Out of this, in a moment or two,
came Nan\x{2019}s voice speaking. She always sounded apprehensive when she picked up
the telephone. \x{2018}Hello.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Hello, Nan,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s Bill. I just thought I\x{2019}d ring to say I won\x{2019}t be
home for tea. I\x{2019}ve got one or two things to do, and then I have to go and see
Tim Burke about a Labour Party thing.\x{2019}


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s all right,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}When will you be home?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, <<about five-thirty|9j>>, I expect,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Maybe sooner. Cheerio.\x{2019}


He put the phone down. Then he stood quite still in the telephone-box and a
strange cold feeling came over him. Why on earth had he done that? Why had he
told Nan a lie? Why hadn\x{2019}t he said that he was out with Miss Carter in the car?
He hadn\x{2019}t even reflected about it, he had told the lie immediately, without
even thinking. Why? He supposed it must have been because he was vaguely aware
that Nan would be very sarcastic and unpleasant about his wasting the afternoon
in this way. But this wasn\x{2019}t a reason for telling her a lie. Anyhow, it was so
idiotic. Anyone might have seen him and Miss Carter in the car together. But
that wasn\x{2019}t the point. He ought not to have lied to Nan. He came slowly out of
the box.


\x{2018}What\x{2019}s the matter,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}You look very strange. Are you all
right?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes, fine,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m just feeling the heat a bit. I\x{2019}ll be better when
the car\x{2019}s started.\x{2019}


Miss Carter gave him an anxious glance and they set off.


Here I am telling another lie, said Mor to himself. Suddenly he said to Miss
Carter, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry, that\x{2019}s not true. The fact is that, I don\x{2019}t know why, I
didn\x{2019}t tell my wife that I was with you in the car \x{2014} which was very foolish of
me.\x{2019}


Miss Carter turned to look at him. Her eyes were hidden behind the dark,
glasses. Now she\x{2019}ll despise me, thought Mor. She\x{2019}ll despise me for telling the
lie, and she\x{2019}ll despise me for telling her that I told it.


\x{2018}Oh dear,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}You\x{2019}ll have to tell her when you get back. She
won\x{2019}t mind much, will she? But I expect she\x{2019}ll be cross with me.\x{2019}


Mor felt a sudden relief and an enormous liking for Miss Carter. Of course, it
was straightforward enough, and not much harm would be done. He would have a
nasty half-hour with Nan, that was all. He was grateful to Miss Carter for the
simple way in which she had dealt with it, and he was glad now that he had told
her.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re perfectly right, of course,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}and naturally I shall tell her
when I get back. She\x{2019}ll be cross with me, quite rightly, but she won\x{2019}t be cross
with you - I\x{2019}ll see that she isn\x{2019}t. I\x{2019}m so sorry about this. I really am a
fool.\x{2019}


The car had been speeding along as they talked. \x{2018}Where are we now?\x{2019} said Miss
Carter.


Mor wasn\x{2019}t quite sure. \x{2018}Drive on a bit,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}We may have missed the
turning. I\x{2019}ll recognize something in a moment.\x{2019} He felt that this last exchange
had broken some barrier between himself and Miss Carter, and he found himself
now more at ease in her presence. For a moment he was almost glad of his
foolishness.


Miss Carter slowed the car down and Mor began to study the countryside.\x{2018} By
this time they were deep in the ragged coniferous Surrey landscape which lies
between the fanned-out lines of the great main roads out of London: the region
where the escaping Londoner, alone of city-dwellers to use the word in quite
this way, says a little doubtfully, \x{2019}Now at last we are really in the
country.\x{2018}


Mor decided that they must have passed the turning he had in mind, but he felt
sure that if they continued they would find their way to the river all the
same. He was determined, after that unpleasantness, not to fail Miss Carter in
the matter of the river. He owed her a service. Meanwhile the afternoon was
growing hotter and the woodlands thicker, more immobile, and more heavily
perfumed. They drove on.


With a simultaneous cry they greeted what now appeared quite suddenly upon the
road before them. Miss Carter braked violently, and approached at a walking
pace. She said, \x{2018}How strange, I thought at first it was a mirage.\x{2019} She stopped
the Riley within a few feet of the ford.


The water ran twinkling across the road in a wide steady sheet. They could hear
it running. For a while they sat in an entranced silence listening to its
noise. Then Miss Carter let the car come very slowly forward until the front
wheels were dipping into the water. She turned to Mor with a look of triumph.


Mor was glad at her joy. He looked about him to each side. The water emerged
from the wood under concrete shelves, the tops of which were covered with earth
and grasses. Beyond this the trees were thick and it was impossible to see what
happened to the little river. Mor looked across the water. A short way beyond
the ford there was a turning to the left. \x{2018}Let\x{2019}s just go down there,\x{2019} said Mor,
pointing to it. \x{2018}We might be able to reach the bank of the river farther
along.\x{2019}


Miss Carter looked at him a little anxiously. \x{2018}Are you sure you have time?\x{2019} she
said. \x{2018}I don\x{2019}t want to keep you. My pranks have caused you some trouble
already.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Nonsense!\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Nothing was your fault, my dear child. I\x{2019}ve still got
some time in hand. If you\x{2019}d like to go -? We won\x{2019}t spend more than a moment
looking.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}d love to!\x{2019} said Miss Carter promptly, and the car went through the ford
with a gentle swish and sailed round the corner. Here once more the trees met
overhead and there was a diffused green light. Miss Carter took off her
glasses.


After about a hundred yards they saw that the little road was bearing to the
right, away from the direction where the river must lie. The wood was still far
too thick for them to see what was there, although when the car stopped and
Miss Carter switched off the engine a murmuring sound of water was distantly
audible. Straight in front of them, however, was a white gate, and beyond it
was a gentle green bridle path which curved away to the left between ferns and
brambles under a close continuous archway of oaks, birches, and conifers. It
was tempting. They looked at each other.


\x{2018}Let\x{2019}s leave the car,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}We could walk down there in a moment and find
the river.\x{2019}


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}why walk? We can ride.\x{2019} And she had leapt out of the car and
was unfastening the gate. A minute or two later the Riley was lurching gently
along the bridle path.


\x{2018}To drive a car along a path like this,\x{2019} said Miss Carter almost in a whisper,
\x{2018}is like sailing a boat along a street. It is an enchantment.\x{2019}


Mor was silent. It was so. The engine was almost noiseless now and above it
rose the massed hum of the woodland on a summer afternoon, a dazing sound that
confounded itself with silence. It was as if since they had passed the white
gate they had entered another world. The spirit of the wood pressed upon them,
and Mor found himself looking from side to side expecting to see something
strange. The path was well kept and closely covered with fine grass, and
someone had cut the bracken back on either side. All the same, the ferns and
the wild flowers were close enough to the wheels of the car to touch them as
they passed, and Mor saw gorse and ragged robin and ladies\x{2019} lace banked and
swaying slightly on either side of the path ahead. Here and there came a deep
vista into the wood, down leaf-strewn alleys lighted by a brown light. There
was still no sign of the river. Miss Carter stopped the car suddenly. She still
spoke in a low voice. \x{2018}Would you like to drive?\x{2019}


Mor was startled. It was nearly fifteen years since he had driven a car, and he
had never possessed one of his own. \x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t driven for a long time,\x{2019} he
said, \x{2018}and I don\x{2019}t know whether I could now. Anyway, I haven\x{2019}t got a driving
licence.\x{2019}


\x{2018}That doesn\x{2019}t matter,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}no one will know - and we\x{2019}re not in a
real road anyway. Would you like to?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I might harm your beautiful car,\x{2019} said Mor. But he knew that he would like to,
he would like to very much indeed, drive the Riley. Before he could say any
more Miss Carter skipped out of the car and they changed places. She seemed
very elated and watched Mor with delight as he looked doubtfully at the
dashboard. He could remember nothing. \x{2018}How do I start it?\x{2019} he asked.


\x{2018}There\x{2019}s the ignition, it\x{2019}s switched on, there\x{2019}s the starter, there\x{2019}s the gear
lever. You remember how the gears go? There\x{2019}s the clutch, the foot-brake, the
accelerator. The hand-brake\x{2019}s in front here.\x{2019} Miss Carter was perched sideways
in her seat with the gleeful air of a little boy who sees his father about to
make a mess of things.


Mor felt large and awkward. He fiddled a little with the gears. He began to
remember. He started the engine. Then gingerly he put the car into first gear
and released the clutch. With a jolt the Riley leapt forward. Mor immediately
put his foot on the brake and the engine stalled. Miss Carter rocked with
laughter. She had drawn her feet up and clutched her skirt about her ankles.


\x{2018}Damn!\x{2019} said Mor. He tried again and was more successful. The Riley glided very
slowly forward and Mor navigated her round a turning in the path. A tree
brushed the roof. Almost silently they sailed on through the thickest part of
the wood. Miss Carter was grave now, she was looking ahead. As he felt the big
car purring quietly along under his control Mor felt like a king. He
experienced a deep and intense joy. His body relaxed. He was continuous with
the car, with the slowly moving woodland, with the thick green carpet of the
unrolling bridle path. They drove for a minute without speaking.


Then Mor saw the woodlander. He was lying very close to the path in a little
clearing where the trees receded and left a wide bare space which was covered
with fallen leaves. All round the edge the flowers and brambles were festooned
in a thick palisade, at the farthest point of which a triangular cleft led far
back into the wood and was lost in darkness. The man lay on his side in the dry
leaves and seemed to be playing a game with some brightly coloured cards. Most
of the cards were in his hand, but some half-dozen were laid out upon the
ground. He was a short broad man, dressed in shabby blue cotton trousers and a
blue shirt. The clothes had something of the air of a uniform, without being of
any identifiable kind. Near by, beneath the brambles, could be seen a bundle
and what looked like the handle of some tool. The man\x{2019}s face was half turned
towards them, his eyes cast down, and the peculiarly dark bronze of his cheek
suggested that he might be a gipsy. His hair was tangled and black.


Involuntarily Mor stopped the car. They were within a few feet of the man. A
moment passed. The reclining figure did not look up. He continued to stare at
the row of cards that lay upturned before him. He paid not the slightest
attention to the watchers in the car. Mor felt Miss Carter touching his arm. He
started the engine again and they drove on. The man was lost to view in the
trees.


Mor turned to look at his companion. Miss Carter was pale and had covered her
mouth with her hand. \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t be frightened,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}I am frightened,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I don\x{2019}t know why.\x{2019}


The car bumped quietly along. The path seemed endless. Mor was a bit frightened
too, he didn\x{2019}t know why. He said, \x{2018}He was probably one of those nomadic
woodcutters that work for the forestry commission. They live in shacks, or
tents in the wood.\x{2019}


\x{2018}He looked to me like a gipsy,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}and I\x{2019}m sure they never work
for anyone. I wonder if we should have given him money? Do you think so?\x{2019}


Mor cast a quick glance at her. He was unnerved by her agitation. \x{2018}Much better not,\x{2019}
he said. \x{2018}Sometimes they are very proud, those people.\x{2019} He realized as he said
this that he would have felt timid at having to address the man.


\x{2018}Did you notice that those weren\x{2019}t ordinary playing cards?\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


At that moment they came round another bend in the bridle path and there before
them was the river. The path turned along the bank, transforming itself into a
wide lawn, and between waving banks of bulrushes, willow herb, and meadow sweet
the river ran strongly, its surface glossy and brilliant. A few late
forget-me-nots still lingered, their stems submerged, at the edge of the
reed-bed. There was a smell of water.


Mor stopped the car and they both got out. They went forward to the edge and
stood for some time in silence. The scene was so like a garden that Mor glanced
about him, half expecting to see a house nearby. But there was nothing to be
seen except the river, which disappeared again on both sides into the thick
wood. He looked at Miss Carter. She was standing deep among the tangle of
leaves and flowers on the river bank. She had a drugged entranced look upon her
face. As if blindly, her hands reached out into the foliage. She plucked a
leaf, and conveyed it to her mouth, and chewed it thoughtfully, her eyes upon
the water.


Mor turned about and walked a little way along the grassy lawn. Here was the
real country where the seasons\x{2019} change is marked by minute signs. Blackthorn
gives way to hawthorn and hawthorn to elder. How rarely he came here. He drew
the branches aside, and then saw that the river widened into a pool, hidden
under a low roof of spreading leaves. The bank shelved gently here, and met the
water in a pebbly beach. Beyond it the stream seemed to be deeper, striped upon
one side with lines of white crows\x{2019} feet, which lay thickly beneath the far
bank, but clear in the middle. A white swan\x{2019}s feather scudded lightly upon the
surface. Mor turned to convey this discovery to his companion, but found her
there already beside him.


\x{2018}Oh,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}I must swim! Do you mind? I must! I must!\x{2019}


Mor felt a little alarmed and shocked at this suggestion; but he felt too that
his permission was being asked and he could hardly say no. He was silent.


\x{2018}Oh, please I must swim,\x{2019} said Miss Carter again. Mor saw the wild light
in her eye. He was reminded suddenly of the rose garden, of Bledyard\x{2019}s room.


\x{2018}Of course, swim if you want to,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I only hope nobody comes. I\x{2019}ll
stay well away here on the bank and watch for intruders.\x{2019}


\x{2018}No one will come,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}no one will find this place. Yes, you go
down there. I\x{2019}ll undress here, on the far side of these bushes. I won\x{2019}t be a
moment. But I must get into the river.\x{2019}


Mor went out again into the sunlight and walked away, his feet dragging through
meadow sweet at the river\x{2019}s brim. He felt uneasy. The sun was intensely hot.
The perspiration was running steadily like tears down the side of his face. The
river was very inviting indeed. Mor turned his head the other way. He sat down
where a gap in the reeds showed him a small section of water. Here the bank was
high and steep and the river flowed past, three or four feet below him. Gorse
bushes on the far side of the water emitted their strong coconut perfume. A
large dragon-fly hovered for a moment and then whisked into invisibility. No
birds sang. The heat had silenced them.


Mor kept his back turned to the place where the low spreading trees concealed
from view the weedy pool and Miss Carter. In a moment or two he heard a
vigorous splashing sound, and then a triumphant cry. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s wonderful!\x{2019} cried
Miss Carter from behind him. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s marvellously warm. And the water is so
clear. And do you know, there\x{2019}s water-cress growing?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Be careful,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t get caught in those weeds.\x{2019}


The splashing continued.


Mor felt very uneasy indeed. He suddenly began to wish that he had not started
on this silly expedition at all. He began to think about Nan, and his
optimistic ideas of the earlier afternoon now seemed futile. He had thought
that no great harm would be done. But how did he know this? He had no
precedents for episodes of this kind. Mor had never deceived his wife, except
for very occasional social lies, and one or two lies about his health. These
were all of them occasions which Mor never forgot. Never before had he had to offer
to Nan the sort of confession which he would have to present tonight. He had
not the slightest idea how she would take it. Of course, nothing very terrible
could happen. Once the truth was told, they would both just have to digest it
somehow. But he did not know exactly, or even roughly, how it would be, and he
felt a deep anguish.


He wondered if he should tell Nan about Miss Carter\x{2019}s bathing. Probably he
ought to have told Miss Carter not to bathe. Yet somehow that would have been
cruel. He had better tell everything, Mor thought. If he was to take refuge in
the truth, and indeed that was his only possible refuge, it had better be the
whole truth. Of course, he would call on Tim Burke on the way home, and that
would make at least part of his story true. Or would this be deceitful? Perhaps
he had only decided to see Tim Burke as a sort of device to allow himself to
spend a longer time with Miss Carter? He wasn\x{2019}t sure. It occurred to him that
after tonight he had better see to it that he did not meet Miss Carter again
except in so far as this was inevitable. Not that it mattered specially. How
foolish that lie had been. It had made something very simple and trivial into
something that appeared important. Mor stared at the river. A water vole swam
slowly across and vanished into the reeds on the far side. Mor did not see it.
He felt a black veil of sadness falling between him and the warm late
afternoon. He looked at his watch.


It was a <<quarter past five|10>>. Mor jumped up. How the time had fled! He must think
about getting back at once. He turned towards the pool and saw Miss Carter\x{2019}s
blue silk dress spread out on a gorse bush and her very small golden sandals
perched on a tuft of grass. He turned quickly away again. \x{2018}Miss Carter,\x{2019} he
called, \x{2018}I think we ought to go fairly soon. I\x{2019}ll just turn the car round.\x{2019}


Miss Carter said in a clear voice from somewhere very close to him, \x{2018}Are you
sure you can manage?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I can manage,\x{2019} said Mor. He climbed gloomily into the Riley and started the
engine. How could he have been such a fool as to get himself into this idiotic
situation? Tonight all would be plain and clear again. Nan would be hurt and
angry. But at least he would be out of the tangle. He hated deeply the feeling
that at this very moment he was deceiving her. He put the car into reverse and
began to swing it round. He backed it for a little distance along the bank of
the river. The Riley moved fast. Mor put the brake on and engaged the first
gear. He released the clutch slowly. Nothing happened. He tried again, accelerating
slightly. Still nothing happened. The car did not move forward. Mor\x{2019}s attention
came sharply back to the present scene. He checked the hand-brake and went
through all the movements again, accelerating hard this time. The car remained
where it was, and he could hear a sinister whirring sound as one of the back
wheels turned vainly in the undergrowth of sedge and willow herb.


Miss Carter came towards him across the lawn, taking small steps. She had
resumed her slightly prim appearance, although the silk dress seemed now to
cling even more closely to her body. She was barefoot, carrying her shoes and
stockings. \x{2018}What is it?\x{2019} she asked a little anxiously.


\x{2018}We seem to be stuck for the moment,\x{2019} said Mor. He got out.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re sure you haven\x{2019}t got the hand-brake on?\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


\x{2018}Sure,\x{2019} said Mor. He walked round to the back of the car. The back wheels were
extremely close to the edge of the stream and had entered a thick mass of
matted weeds and grasses. The bank fell away here and the undergrowth overhung
it in a deceptive manner. Under the canopy of green the earth was damp and
sticky. The bank then fell steeply to the water, some feet below. Mor stepped
waist deep into the patch of willow herb and saw that the off-side wheel was
almost clear of the ground, protruding into the greenery that hung down from
the bank towards the water. The other wheel appeared to have sunk into a rather
muddy hollow. The front wheels were a foot or two away from the river bank.


\x{2018}How\x{2019}s the situation?\x{2019} said Miss Carter. She followed him barefoot, and as he
bent forward he saw her small white feet appear in the grass near to his heavy
shoes.


Mind the nettles,\x{2018} said Mor. \x{2019}It\x{2019}s all right, I think I see what to do. This
wheel is almost at the edge, I\x{2019}m afraid. But we could move if the other wheel
would bite. That one\x{2019}s stuck in a patch of mud. If we just put some grass and
branches underneath it, that should do the trick. Look, I\x{2019}ll rev the engine
again, and you watch the back wheels.\x{2018}


No, I\x{2019}ll rev the engine,\x{2018} said Miss Carter. \x{2019}Perhaps the car will move for me.\x{2018}
She got in and went through the motions. The same thing happened. The engine
roared in vain. Mor could see the back wheels turning, one in the green
undergrowth above the water, and the other in the patch of mud. Miss Carter
switched off and got out again.


\x{2018}Lots of grass and twigs is what we need,\x{2019} said Mor. He ran to the edge of the
wood and began to pluck armfuls of bracken and tall grass. Miss Carter went a
little farther into the wood and gathered small twigs and branches. As she
returned Mor saw that her legs were bleeding. They knelt together beside the
wheel. Miss Carter smelt of river water. From the wet ends of her hair, as she
leaned forward, a little water trickled down towards her bosom. She helped Mor
to strew the foliage under the wheel from both sides. With his hand Mor scooped
the mud out from under the tyre, and packed in a compact bunch of twigs and
ferns.


\x{2018}There!\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}We ought to get away now. Will you take her, or shall I?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I will,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}You watch what happens.\x{2019}


Mor squatted near the wheel while Miss Carter got in again and started the
engine. Breathlessly Mor watched the wheel begin to rotate. It was all right.
It was biting well upon the dry bracken. Mor was about to call out, when
suddenly something happened. There was a violent jolt, and the car stopped
again. Mor saw with surprise that the wheel had risen clear of the ground and
was turning in the air. He jumped up.


\x{2018}What\x{2019}s happened now?\x{2019} said Miss Carter. She sounded alarmed. The car was
tilting towards the river.


Mor ran round the back of the car. He looked at the other back wheel. A section
of the bank had given way under it, and it hung in mid-air above the water. The
Riley seemed to be resting now upon its back axle, straddled across the bank.


\x{2018}Get out of the car,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}No, let me try again,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


\x{2018}Get out,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}at once.\x{2019}


She got out and joined him. When she saw the position of the back wheels she
gave a gasp of distress.


\x{2018}I am extremely sorry,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}This is all completely my fault. But
apologies aren\x{2019}t much use. The thing is to decide what to do.


\x{2018}Supposing,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}we were to wedge something under the inside
back wheel, and you were to push hard from behind, we might get her to jump
forward.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t think so,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}We\x{2019}d have to raise the axle somehow. The car is
tilted too much already.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Suppose we jacked her up,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}and got her on an even keel and
then lowered her slowly again.\x{2019}


\x{2018}We wouldn\x{2019}t be able to jack her up,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}The jack would just sink into
that muddy ground. Anyhow, as we lowered her she would just sink into the same
position.\x{2019}


Miss Carter was worried, but by no means distracted. She was thinking hard.
Before Mor could stop her, she was crawling underneath the Riley.


Don\x{2019}t do that, Miss Carter,\x{2018} said Mor sharply. \x{2019}With the car tilting like that
it\x{2019}s not safe.\x{2018}


Miss Carter emerged. Her knees and the hem of her dress were covered in mud.
She had thrown her shoes and stockings away into the grass.


\x{2018}I wanted to see what exactly the axle was doing,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}In fact it\x{2019}s
resting on a stone. What I suggest is that we put something large and firm
underneath the other wheel, and then dig the stone away. Then the car will be
resting on three wheels again.\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s no use,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}What we need now is a tractor.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, let\x{2019}s try this first,\x{2019} she said firmly, and already she was running away
into the wood. Mor followed her. He felt nothing now except an almost physical
distress about the car.


Miss Carter soon found a flat mossy stone and Mor helped her to carry it back
towards the river. It was very heavy. Mor took off his coat and rolled up his
sleeves. They began to introduce the stone underneath the wheel. It became very
muddy and slippery in the process.


\x{2018}This is a crazy proceeding,\x{2019} said Mor. He squatted back on his heels and
looked at his companion. Miss Carter was very flushed. There were patches of
mud on the dark red of her cheeks. Her dress was hitched up, and one knee and
thigh were embedded in the muddy ground. She looked like something from a
circus.


\x{2018}We must be careful,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}to see that the stone is tilting from the
inside of the car outwards. Then when it takes the weight the car won\x{2019}t slither
any farther towards the river.\x{2019}


Mor sighed. He could not desert her. He helped her to complete the operation.


\x{2018}Now,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}the question is, how are we to dig out the stone from under
the axle without the whole thing coming down on top of us?\x{2019}


\x{2018}We\x{2019}ll use the starting-handle,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. She was not calm, but intent
and fervent. She fetched the starting-handle from the back of the car.


\x{2018}Give it to me,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}You keep clear, and don\x{2019}t whatever you do get into
the car. When it does rest on three wheels again I\x{2019}ll try to drive it out.\x{2019}


Mor got into the Riley for a moment and engaged the hand-brake and the first
gear. Then he went behind the car and lay down close to the wheels. He could
see the inside back wheel touching the stone which he and Miss Carter had put
in place, and the axle resting upon another stone nearer to the river bank. He
reached underneath with the starting-handle and began to undermine the stone on
which the axle rested, digging hard at its base. Miss Carter came and sat near him,
almost invisible in the long grass.


It was easier than Mor had expected to undermine the stone. Perhaps, after all,
he thought, this mad plan will work. He felt the stone give slightly and begin
to sink. In another moment it would be clear of the axle and the car would be
resting upon its three wheels. Mor gave a final dig and drew sharply back.


With a roar of grinding tyres and tearing undergrowth and crumbling stones the
Riley lurched over madly towards the river. Mor saw it rise above him like a
rearing animal. He rolled precipitately back into the grass and came into
violent contact with Miss Carter\x{2019}s knees. They both staggered up.


\x{2018}Are you all right?\x{2019} she cried.


Mor did not answer. They ran forward to see what had happened to the car.
Another large section of the bank had given way, and the car had slid down and
was now balanced with one back wheel and one front wheel well over the edge of
the bank. Below it the river, foaming and muddy with the recent avalanche,
swept on its way carrying off long reeds and tufts of grass and broken blossoms
of meadow sweet.


\x{2018}Hmmm,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Well, now I think it\x{2019}s time to go and get the tractor.\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s too late for the tractor,\x{2019} said Miss Carter in a steady voice.


Mor looked. Then he saw that it was indeed too late.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s going to turn right over into the river,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


They watched. Very very slowly the big car was tilting towards the water. There
was a soft gurgling sound as pieces of the river bank descended and were
engulfed. Mor took Miss Carter by the arm and drew her back. There was a
moment\x{2019}s pause, during which was audible the steady voice of the stream and the
buzz of the surrounding woodland. The car was poised now, its inside wheels
well clear of the ground, its outside wheels biting deep into the soft earth
half-way down the bank. Then slowly again it began to move. Higher and higher
the wheels rose from the ground, as the roof of the car inclined more and more
sharply until it stood vertically above the water. Then with a grinding crash
of buckling metal and subsiding earth the car fell, turning over as it went,
and came to rest upside down with its roof upon the bed of the stream.


The moment immediately after the crash was strangely silent. The woodland hum
was heard again, and the murmur of the stream, now slightly modified as the
water gurgled in and out of the open windows of the Riley. The stream was very
shallow, and the water did not rise above the level of the windows. The reeds
were swaying in the warm air and the dragon-flies darting among the sharp green
stems. Everything was as before, except for the dark gash of the broken bank
and the spectacle of the Riley lying upside down in the middle of the river,
its black and sinister lower parts exposed to the declining sun.


\x{2018}Oh dear,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


Mor turned to comfort her. He saw that she was starting to cry.


\x{2018}My poor Riley,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. And she wept without restraint.


Mor looked at her for a moment. Then he put one arm round her and held her in a
very strong grip.


In a moment Miss Carter recovered and disengaged herself quickly from Mor\x{2019}s
hold. Mor offered her a handkerchief.


\x{2018}Look here,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}all we can do now is go and find a garage with a
breakdown unit and let them deal with this scene. In fact the car isn\x{2019}t badly
damaged - it\x{2019}s just a matter of pulling it out. It\x{2019}ll need a crane, but it
won\x{2019}t be difficult. I suggest you go home now in the bus, Miss Carter, and
leave me to arrange the rest. I\x{2019}m deeply sorry about this, and needless to say
I\x{2019}ll pay all the bills. You go home now and have a good rest. I\x{2019}ll see you as
far as the main road.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, don\x{2019}t be silly,\x{2019} said Miss Carter in a tired voice. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m not going to
leave the car. You go and find the breakdown people. I shall stay here.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t like leaving you alone in the wood,\x{2019} said Mor. He thought of the
woodcutter.


\x{2018}Please go,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll stay here. I\x{2019}d much rather stay with the
car.\x{2019} She spoke as if it were a wounded animal.


Mor gave up trying to convince her. It was clear to him that she really wanted
him away. He turned back on foot along the grassy bridle path, and as he passed
the clearing he saw that the man had gone. He passed through the white gate,
and almost at once was able to hail a car which took him to a nearby garage.
Less than half an hour later a small lorry mounted with a crane conveyed him
once more to the river, ripping the ferns and the branches on either side as it
bumped along the track.


Miss Carter was standing knee-deep in the water beside the Riley. When she saw
them coming she scrambled out. She came straight up to Mor.


\x{2018}Listen, she said, \x{2019}please go home now. It wasn\x{2019}t your fault, this thing. It
was all my fault for taking you away. Please go home. Your wife will be very
worried.\x{2018}


\x{2018}I must wait and see that everything is all right,\x{2019} said Mor.


Miss Carter put her hand on his arm. \x{2018}Please, please go,\x{2019} she said. Please,
please, please.\x{2018}


At last Mor allowed himself to be persuaded. The breakdown men seemed to think
that it would not be difficult to lift the Riley; and Miss Carter seemed
intensely anxious for his departure. So in a little while Mor turned away and
went back alone to the road. When he came in sight of the ford he saw that
there was someone there. It was the man from the clearing, who was standing
with the water covering his shoes and lapping round his trouser ends. When he
became aware of Mor he moved on a step or two into the deepest part of the ford
and stopped again, but without looking round. Mor watched him for a moment.
Then he turned and began walking in the other direction along the road. It was
not long before he met a car which was able to give him a lift as far as the
main road. There he caught a bus.


As the bus conveyed Mor along the noisy road towards the outskirts of the
housing estate he felt as if he were emerging from a dream. It was only a few
hours ago that he had risen from Evvy\x{2019}s lunch table. What world had he entered
in between? Whatever the region was, Mor thought, in which he had been
wandering, one thing was certain, that he would never visit it again. At this
reflection he felt a mixture of sadness and relief. He looked at his watch. It
was <<after eight|9f>>. Nan would indeed be worried. He ought to have telephoned her.
But somehow it had not occurred to him, so completely insulated had he been by
the strange atmosphere of that other world. He shook himself and looked to see
the familiar streets appearing. He got off the bus and began to walk quickly
past the rows of semi-detached houses towards his own.


As Mor came to the corner of the road where he lived he suddenly paused. A
familiar figure had come out from under the shadow of a tree and was hurrying
to meet him. It was Tim Burke.


Tim came up to Mor, took him by the wrist, and turning him about began to lead
him quickly back the way he had come.


\x{2018}Tim!\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Whatever is it? We can\x{2019}t talk now. Look, I must get home. I\x{2019}m
in an awful fix.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re telling me you\x{2019}re in a fix!\x{2019} said Tim. He took Mor\x{2019}s arm in a wrestling
grip and began to urge him back along the road. \x{2018}I had to wait there, I wasn\x{2019}t
sure which way you\x{2019}d come. I don\x{2019}t want Nan to see me.\x{2019} They turned down
another road.


\x{2018}What is it, Tim?\x{2019} said Mor, freeing his arm. They stopped under a tree.


\x{2018}Nan rang me up,\x{2019} said Tim.


Mor thought, of course, it hadn\x{2019}t occurred to him, but naturally Nan would have
rung up Tim to ask why he was so late. \x{2018}What did she say,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}when you
said I hadn\x{2019}t been with you?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I didn\x{2019}t say that,\x{2019} said Tim.


\x{2018}What?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}I didn\x{2019}t say it,\x{2019} said Tim. \x{2018}I said you\x{2019}d been with me most of the afternoon
and that just then you\x{2019}d gone over to the committee rooms and that you\x{2019}d been
delayed and you\x{2019}d probably be back a bit later.


Mor put his hand to his head. \x{2018}Tim,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}for heaven\x{2019}s sake, what put it
into your mind to invent all that?\x{2019}


Tim took hold of the hem of Mor\x{2019}s jacket. \x{2018}I saw you down at the traffic lights
at Marsington,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}in a car with a girl.\x{2019}


Mor leaned against the tree. It was a plane tree with a flaky piebald bark. He
pulled a piece of the bark off it. \x{2018}I see,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m afraid your Irish
imagination has carrried you away a bit, Tim. That was just Miss Carter, who\x{2019}s
painting Demoyte\x{2019}s portrait. And in fact I would have been with you this
afternoon if it hadn\x{2019}t been that the car broke down.\x{2019}


Tim was silent. All this isn\x{2019}t quite true, thought Mor. Oh God!


\x{2018}Tim,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry. You\x{2019}ve acted very kindly. There\x{2019}s been a horrible
muddle today, all my fault.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re not angry with me, Mor?\x{2019} said Tim. \x{2018}You see, I couldn\x{2019}t just say
you hadn\x{2019}t been there. I had to do my best. I had to try to think what to do.\x{2019}
He was still holding on to Mor\x{2019}s coat.


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s all right, Tim,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}You acted very well, in fact. It\x{2019}s been all
my fault. But there won\x{2019}t be anything like this again. We\x{2019}d better just bury it
quietly and not refer to it any more. I\x{2019}m deeply sorry to have involved you in
this. And thank you for what you did.\x{2019} He touched Tim\x{2019}s shoulder lightly. Tim
let go of his coat.


They looked at each other. Tim\x{2019}s look expressed curiosity, diffidence, and
affection. Mor\x{2019}s look expressed affention, exasperation, and remorse. They
began to walk back along the road.


When they got to the corner, Tim said, \x{2018}Have you talked to herself yet about
that thing?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}I will soon though.\x{2019}


They stood for a moment.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re not angry?\x{2019} said Tim. \x{2018}I tried to do the best for you.


\x{2018}How could I be angry?\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}It is you who should pardon me. You did very
well. And now we\x{2019}ll not speak of it again. Good night, Tim.\x{2019}


Mor turned and began to walk slowly along the road that led to his own house.",

the light was leaving the earth and taking refuge in the sky. The big windows
of Demoyte\x{2019}s drawing-room stood open upon the garden. A recurring pattern of
bird-song filled the room, not overlaid now by any human voices. In the last
light of the evening Rain Carter was painting.


It was the day following the disaster with the Riley. The breakdown men had in
fact managed to right the car fairly quickly, and towed it to the garage. The
engine was badly jolted and drenched with water, but there was no serious
damage to the car except for a certain buckling of the roof. The garage had
promised to restore it, almost as good as new, in a short while.


Rain, however, was not thinking now about the Riley. Nor was she thinking about
William Mor, although that was a subject which had preoccupied her for a while
before she retired to bed the previous evening. She was completely absorbed in
what she was doing. Early that morning Rain had found herself able to make a number
of important decisions about the picture, and once her plan had become clear
she started at once to put it into execution. A white sheet was laid down in
the drawing-room on which the easel was placed, together with a kitchen table
and a chair. Paints and brushes stood upon the table, and the large canvas had
been screwed on the easel. Enthroned opposite, beside one of the windows, sat
Demoyte, his shoulder touching one of the rugs which hung behind him upon the
wall. Through the window was visible a small piece of the garden, some trees,
and above the trees in the far distance the tower of the school. In front of
Demoyte stood a table spread with books and papers. Demoyte had been sitting
there at Rain\x{2019}s request for a large part of the afternoon and was by this time
rather irritable. During much of this period Rain had not been painting but
simply walking up and down and looking at him, asking him to alter his position
slightly, and bringing various objects and laying them upon the table.


Demoyte was dressed in a rather frayed corduroy coat and was wearing a bow tie.
This particular capitulation had taken place the previous morning after
breakfast when Rain had said sharply, Don\x{2019}t think me eccentric, Mr Demoyte, but
these are the clothes I want to paint you in\x{2018} - and had laid the very garments
on the chair beside him. Demoyte had made no comment, but had gone at once in
quest of Miss Handforth to tell her exactly what he thought of this betrayal.
Handy had informed him that needless to say she knew nothing about it and
surely he knew her better than to imagine she would give information to that
imp or make free with her employer\x{2019}s clothing. Demoyte had pondered the outrage
for a short while, made a mental note to give Mor a rocket when he next saw
him, changed into the clothes in question, and felt immensely better and more
comfortable.


Rain, surveying now at leisure the object placed before her, could hear her
father\x{2019}s voice saying, \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t forget that a portrait must have depth, mass, and
decorative qualities. Don\x{2019}t be so fascinated by the head, or by the space, that
you forget that a canvas is also a flat surface with edges which touch the
frame. Part of your task is to cover that surface with a pattern.\x{2019} What Rain
had lacked was the motif of the pattern. But this had lately occurred to her,
and with it came the definitive vision, which she had been seeking, of
Demoyte\x{2019}s face. The old man\x{2019}s face, it now seemed to her, was of a withered
golden colour, like an old apple, and marked with the repetition of a certain
curve. Supremely this curve occurred in his lips, which Rain proposed to paint
curling in a slightly sarcastic and amused manner which was highly
characteristic of him. It appeared again, more subdued, in his eyebrows, which
met bushily above his nose, and in the line made by his eyes and the deep
wrinkles which led upwards from their corners. The multitudinous furrows of the
forehead presented the same motif, tiny now and endlessly repeated, where the
amusement was merged into tolerance and the sarcasm into sadness.


Rain had chosen as part of the background one of the rugs which, as it seemed
to her, spoke the theme again. In some obscure way this patterned surface
continued too to be expressive of the character of the sitter, with his
passionate interest in all-over decoration. Rain selected a noble Sh\x{ed}r\x{e1}z, of a
more intense golden shade, not unlike the colour in which she proposed to paint
the old man\x{2019}s face, and wherein the curve occurred again, formalized into a
recurrent flower. This rug, which was the same one which Rain had been studying
when William Mor first beheld her, she had persuaded Demoyte to move,
exchanging its position with another one so as to have it in the picture. He
had done this with many complaints.


Rain was aware of the dangers of her plan. She was not especially worried at
the possibility of depth and space being sacrificed to decoration. That was a
risk which had to be run in any case - and she found in practice that if she
thought about decoration first, and then forgot it and thought about depth, the
thing would usually work out. It was rather that this particular motif,
combined with the colour scheme which seemed to be imposing itself, was a
somewhat sweet one and might soften the picture too much. To counteract it she
would rely upon the sheer mass and strength of the head - that would be her
most difficult task - and upon the powerful thickness of the neck. The hands
and the objects upon the table would have to play their part too, especially
the hands. Rain did not yet see this very clearly. The treatment of the window
was also to some extent problematic. She was tempted to paint the trees in a
stylized and curly manner, but suspected that this was a false instinct.
Something different must be done with the trees, something rather austere. What
she could not bring herself to sacrifice was the idea of putting in the
neo-Gothic tower of the school in the top left-hand corner, rising into the sky
with a fantastic flourish. The sky itself would be pallid, cooling down the rest
of the picture, so far as was consistent with a strong light in the room.
Demoyte himself would be looking back, away from the window, his glance not
quite meeting that of the spectator.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s time you stopped that now, missie, said Demoyte. \x{2019}There isn\x{2019}t anything
like enough light to paint by.\x{2018} He shifted restlessly about in his chair. He
particularly resented being kept there when Rain was not painting him but
painting a piece of the rug. Rain had told him when he complained that \x{2019}all the
colours belong to each other, so the rug looks different when you are there.


\x{2018}I know,\x{2019} said Rain abstractedly. She was wearing her black trousers and a
loose red overall on top, the sleeves well rolled up. \x{2018}It is too dark. My
father would be cross seeing me painting now. I just want to finish this tiny
square.\x{2019}


She had filled in in very considerable detail one small segment of the rug in
the top right-hand half of the picture. The rest of the picture was vaguely
sketched in with a small number of thin lines of paint. Rain, following her
father, did not believe in under-painting. She painted directly on to the
canvas with strokes of colour which were put on as if they were to stand and to
modify the final result however much was subsequently laid on top of them. Rain
also followed Sidney Carter\x{2019}s system of painting the background first and
letting the main subject grow out of the background and dominate it and if
necessary encroach upon it. In particular, she recalled her father\x{2019}s dictum: \x{2018}A
little piece of serious paint upon the canvas will tell you a lot about the
rest. Put it on and sleep on it\x{2019} Rain hoped that the following day she would be
able to construct, from the small and finely worked segment of rug, a great
deal more of the rest of her picture.


She laid the brush down. It was too dark now. Demoyte began to get up. \x{2018}Please
wait a moment,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}just a moment more, please.\x{2019} He subsided.


Rain came forward and studied him, leaning thoughtfully across the table. The
hands. Much depended on that. The hands must be another mark of strength in the
picture, shown solid and square, somehow. But how exactly?


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t know what to do with your hands,\x{2019} said Rain. She reached across and
took one of Demoyte\x{2019}s hands and laid it across the top of one of the books. No,
that wouldn\x{2019}t do.


\x{2018}I know what to do with your hands,\x{2019} said Demoyte. He captured the one that was
still straying about on the table and lifted it to his lips.


Rain smiled faintly. She looked down at Demoyte, not studying him this time.
Now it was quite dark in the room, although the garden was glowing still.


\x{2018}Have I given you a bad day?\x{2019} she said. She did not try to free her hand.
Demoyte clasped it in both of his, stroking it gently and conveying it
frequently to his lips.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}ve kept me sitting here in one position and an agony of rheumatism for the
whole afternoon, that\x{2019}s all,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}Let me see how much you\x{2019}ve done by
now.\x{2019} He lumbered over to the easel. Rain followed him and sat down on a chair
to look at the canvas. She felt exhausted.


\x{2018}Good God!\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}Is that all you\x{2019}ve done, child, in the last two
hours? You\x{2019}re still on that square inch of carpet. At this rate you\x{2019}ll be with
us for years. But perhaps that\x{2019}s what you want-like Penelope, never finishing
her work? I wouldn\x{2019}t complain. And I can think of one or two other people who
wouldn\x{2019}t complain either.\x{2019} Demoyte leaned on the back of Rain\x{2019}s chair and
touched her dark hair. His enormous hand could cup the back of her head in its
palm. He drew his hand slowly down on to her neck.


\x{2018}The picture will be finished,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}and I shall go. I shall be
sorry.\x{2019} She spoke solemnly.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Demoyte. He fetched another chair and placed it very close to her
and sat down, his knee brushing hers. \x{2018}When the picture is finished,\x{2019} he said,
\x{2018}you will go, and I shall not see you again.


He spoke in a factual voice, as if requiring no reply. Rain watched him
gravely.


\x{2018}When you go,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}you will leave behind a picture of me, whereas
what I shall be wanting is a picture of you.


\x{2018}Every portrait is a self-portrait,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}In portraying you I portray
myself.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Spiritual nonsense,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}I want to see your flesh, not your soul.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Artists do paint themselves in their sitters,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}often in quite
material ways. Burne-Jones made all his people look thin and gloomy like
himself. Romney always reproduced his own nose, Van Dyck his own hands.\x{2019} She
reached out and drew her hand in the half darkness along the rough cord of
Demoyte\x{2019}s coat, seeking his wrist. She sighed.


\x{2018}Your father, yes,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}he taught you many things, but you are
yourself a different being and must live so. Here I prose on, an old man, and
must be forgiven. You know how much at this moment I want to take you in my
arms, and that I will not do so. Rain, Rain. Tell me instead, why do you think
artists make their sitters resemble them? Will you paint me to resemble you?
Would such a thing be possible?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t know,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}whether it shows a limitation, if we want to see
ourselves in the world about us. Perhaps it is rather that we feel our
own face, as a three-dimensional mass, from within - and when we try in a
painting to realize what another person\x{2019}s face is, we come back to the
experience of our own.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You think that we feel our faces as if they were masks?\x{2019} said Demoyte. He
reached out and touched Rain\x{2019}s face, drawing his finger gently down over the
outline of her nose.


Miss Handforth came noisily into the room and switched the light on. Rain sat
quite still, but Demoyte jerked awkwardly backwards, jarring his chair along
the floor.


\x{2018}Deary me!\x{2019} said Miss Handforth. \x{2018}I had no idea you two were still in here, why
you\x{2019}ve been sitting in the dark! Mr Mor has just come, I sent him up to the
library, because I thought you were upstairs.\x{2019} Miss Handforth strode across the
the room and began lustily pulling the curtains. The garden was dark.


\x{2018}I wish you wouldn\x{2019}t enter rooms like a battering ram, Handy,\x{2019} said Demoyte.
\x{2018}Leave all that and go and tell Mor to come down here.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Do you want all that stuff left here, or am I to clear it up every night?\x{2019}
asked Miss Handforth, indicating the white sheet, the easel, and the other
paraphernalia.


\x{2018}Please may it remain here for the moment?\x{2019} said Rain.


\x{2018}You propose to take possession of my drawing-room, do you?\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}The
whole house stinks of paint already. Go on, Handy, go away and fetch that man
down from the library.\x{2019}


 



When Mor had walked towards the front door of his house on the previous evening
he had still not been sure whether or not he would tell his wife the whole
story. The interference of Tim Burke seemed to complicate the picture.
Frankness on Mor\x{2019}s part would now be an exposure not only of himself but of his
friend. Yet it was not this that moved Mor so much as a feeling that Tim\x{2019}s lie,
added to his own, made of the whole thing something far more considerable in
appearance than it really was. There was something about the way in which Tim
had said, \x{2018}I saw you in a car with a girl,\x{2019} which made Mor suddenly see the
situation from the outside; and seen from the outside it did look as if it were
something, whereas seen from the inside it was of course nothing, nothing at
all. So that, it seemed obscurely to Mor as he walked back, to tell Nan the
truth would really be to mislead her. There was no way of telling the story
which would not make Nan think that there was more to it than there was. So, in
a way, it was more in accordance with the facts to let Nan think that nothing
had occurred. For nothing had occurred and the whole thing would soon be
buried in the past. Except for a few inevitable social meetings he would see no
more of Miss Carter, and that would be that. Mor echoed again his words to Tim
Burke: \x{2018}We won\x{2019}t speak of it again\x{2019} - and this seemed to be the right note to
strike. Mor knew he could trust Tim\x{2019}s tact and discretion absolutely. Whereas,
if he told Nan, Mor knew that really, in one way or another, he would never
hear the end of it, and that the incident, even against his will, would then be
lent a permanent and indelible significance.


When he entered the house he had still not resolved the problem. He was met in
the hall by Nan, who said, \x{2018}Well, dear, you\x{2019}re home at last, are you, I thought
you were never coming. Look, your supper\x{2019}s in the oven, and I\x{2019}ve made a cake, which
is on the sideboard, if you want some. Felicity\x{2019}s had her supper and gone to
the pictures, and I\x{2019}ve got to go out this very minute to see Mrs Prewett. You
can imagine how delightful that prospect is! It\x{2019}s Women\x{2019}s Institute tomorrow
night and she wants to hear my views on how to get the women to come along
other than by dances and film shows. I told her over the phone that there isn\x{2019}t
any other way, but she still wants me to come over. I hope I won\x{2019}t be long, but
you know how that woman pins one down!\x{2019} And a minute later Nan had gone out of
the front door.


Mor sat down to his supper. He felt that that, in effect, decided the matter.
If he had been going to tell the truth that was the moment for telling it. But
the moment had passed now. Nan had accepted the fiction, and it was better that
he should not upset her view. If she had questioned him he would have owned up.
As it was, he would leave things as they were. After he had cut the cake,
however, it occurred to Mor that there was something else that needed doing,
and that was to let Miss Carter know that he had changed his mind about telling
his wife. If he did not do this, and do it soon, she might drop a brick. He
paused to ponder over this. Then he began to wonder whether she would have told
Demoyte about their outing. This notion made Mor uneasy. He thought, I must see
her tomorrow, find out whether she\x{2019}s told Demoyte, and if necessary shut them
both up. Mor knew that he could rely on Demoyte\x{2019}s discretion also; but he could
not help hoping that the old man was not to be in the secret. He could imagine
the sarcasms which he would have to suffer if he was. He thought it just
possible that Miss Carter would not have told him. She was a curious
independent sort of girl and would know how to keep her own counsel.


On further reflection Mor decided that since the matter was of a certain
delicacy it was quite likely that Miss Carter would not have told Demoyte about
it. It also occurred to him that it might be difficult, in the nearer future,
to procure a long enough interview alone with Miss Carter to make the matter
decently clear. He was teaching most of tomorrow, and could only be sure of
getting away at some time in the evening, when Miss Carter was likely to be in
company, at least with Demoyte, and perhaps with other people too. He knew that
it was hardly safe to ring her up, since with Handy as intermediary no
embarrassment would be spared. Mor decided that the most sensible thing to do
was to write a letter, to carry it in person over to Demoyte\x{2019}s house, to see
Miss Carter alone if possible, and if not to find some opportunity of passing
the letter to her unobserved.


Mor found these speculations extremely absorbing. Once the matter was settled,
of course, he would have no more to do with the young lady, and would scarcely
see her except at a party or two and at the ceremonial dinner. There was no
problem about that. All the same, when it seemed to him that it was necessary
to write her a letter he found that this prospect was not unpleasant. He went upstairs
to his bedroom, which also served as his study, collected plenty of paper, and
settled down to draft the epistle. It was not a simple task. There were
interesting problems about how to begin and end it, how much to say, and how
exactly to say what was said. Mor had several tries. What he wrote at first
was:


Dear Miss Carter,


When I arrived back last night I found that the friend whom I had intended to
visit had officiously supported my false story. So in the circumstances I have
decided not to tell the true one. I hope you will understand - and excuse me
for having involved you in this decepdon.


I hope that the car is all right. It grieved me to leave you like that. insist
on being allowed to pay the bills. Yours sincerely.


Yours sincerely,

William Mor 


Mor looked at this for a while, crossed out \x{2018}It grieved me, etc.\x{2019}, and finally
tore the whole thing up and sat, brooding. He reflected that if he was indeed
to pay the bills he would have to have further clandestine converse with Miss
Carter. He could of course simply tell her to send him the bills. But would
she? That girl, of course not. Alternatively, he could send her a sum of money.
This was difficult and embarrassing. To send too small a sum would be mean and
disgraceful - whereas the idea of sending a sum large enough to be sure that it
was not too small unnerved Mor, who was, if not exactly parsimonious, at any
rate extremely careful with his money. He decided eventually not to say
anything at all about paying the bills in the letter and to trust that he would
have an opportunity in the ordinary course of events to discuss this with Miss
Carter before she left. He then wrote a second letter as follows:


Dear Miss Carter,


This is just to tell you that I have decided, after all, for reasons which it
would take too long to explain, to deceive my wife. I hasten to tell you this
so that you may act accordingly; and I beg you humbly to excuse me for having
involved you in this unpleasantness. I hope that the Riley survived its strange
experience and will soon be on the road once more. I am sorry to have been, in
that adventure, so inept and so useless.


Yours sincerely,

William Mor 


P.S. - Have you told Mr Demoyte about our expedition? If you have, I
should be grateful if you could signify as much to me, discreetly, as soon as
possible. And please burn this letter.


There\x{2019}s no need to bring Tim Burke into it, thought Mor, and brevity and
vagueness, except on essential points, are what we need here. He studied this
version for some time; then he destroyed it too. It was scarcely necessary,
after all, to tell her to burn the letter. This request only made the thing
seem more significant and conspiratorial. She would have enough sense not to
leave such a document lying about. Mor started again. This time he would aim at
being very brief and business-like, and in this way he would also be able, he
felt, to strike a more sincere and serious note. He wrote as follows:


I am very sorry-I have decided after all not to tell my wife about our
outing. So I beg you to keep silent about it. I apologize very humbly for all
the trouble I\x{2019}ve caused you, in this connexion and about the car. I hated
leaving you alone - and I hope the car will be all right.


W.M.


Mor looked at this for a while. It satisfied him, and he sealed it up in a
plain envelope. He had left out any mention of Demoyte - and thought that he
would rely on finding out somehow, from the girl or from Demoyte himself,
whether anything had been told. If he found Miss Carter alone he could ask her,
if he found her with Demoyte he could rely on the old man\x{2019}s making some mocking
remark on the subject fairly quickly, if he knew anything about it. If he found
company at Brayling\x{2019}s Close, that would be a problem - but one which he would
deal with as he found it. Looking at his watch, Mor discovered that he had
passed two hours in total absorption drafting the letters. Felicity had come
home and had retired to her own room. Nan was still not back. Mor hid the
envelope carefully and burnt the fragments of the earlier drafts. He felt as if
he had accomplished a good evening\x{2019}s work. He went to bed and slept
excellently.


When Mor awoke in the morning he found himself much less sanguine about the
whole business than he had been the night before. He felt regret and distress
at finding that not only had he decided to deceive Nan but he had even made
complicated arrangements to do so. It also occurred to him now, and shocked
him, that he had been entirely responsible for damaging a very expensive car -
whereas yesterday evening the fate of the Riley had figured in his mind,
absurdly as it now seemed, as part of an adventure. Mor sobered himself
considerably by thinking about the bill. As for the course of action which he
had chosen, he felt himself, for all his misgivings, to be committed to it, and
indeed the tasks of the day left him little time for reflection; and as the
afternoon wore on what more and more recurred to his mind, in the intervals of
teaching, was the not unpleasant prospect of going over that evening to Brayling\x{2019}s
Close and seeing Miss Carter again, and all this with a certain inevitability.


Mor had supper at home at <<seven-thirty|5b>>, saw Nan off to her Women\x{2019}s Institute
meeting, and then, at <<about a quarter past eight|10>>, left the house on foot. He
told Nan, who was not particularly interested, that he was going to call on
Demoyte, a thing which he often did on evenings when she was engaged. Mor
usually cycled over to the Close, but this time he felt more like walking. It
was a very clear warm evening. The good weather certainly seemed likely to
last, thought Mor, and they could even hope for a fine day for the House Match.
He walked along, wrapped in a pleasant pensive veil. The more disagreeable
aspects of the task before him were not then in his mind. He seemed to enjoy
the warmth and light of the evening with a simplicity which he had not known
for many years; and he wondered why so much of his life was passed in
fretfulness, and why moments such as these were so very rare. He walked a
little way along the main road, and then struck off it across some fields by a
path which led him eventually into Demoyte\x{2019}s garden. As the low stone wall and
the mulberry trees came in sight, however, excitement and nervousness replaced
his tranquillity. The conveying of a clandestine letter was something which Mor
had not done before, and which he hoped he would not have to do again.


He entered the hall without ringing, and was greeted by Miss Handforth, who
told him, \x{2018}His Lordship is in the library.\x{2019} Mor mounted the stairs, but found
the library empty. It was dark now, lowering with books, and melancholy. Its
silence caught Mor, and half relieved he sat down for a moment beside one of
the tables. Then Handy returned, and sticking her head round the door
announced, \x{2018}Sorry, he\x{2019}s down in the drawing-room with Miss Thingumajite.\x{2019}


Mor went down, knocked at the drawing-room door, and entered. The drawing-room
was softly lit by many lamps and the curtains were drawn across. Demoyte was
standing, lean ing against the mantelpiece, and Miss Carter was sitting in a
chair, enthroned upon a sort of white sheet beside an easel which was erected
in one comer of the room. Mor was surprised and pleased to see the easel. It
was the first time that he had had any material evidence that Miss Carter was a
painter.


\x{2018}Good evening,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}good evening. I see the picture has begun.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Begun!\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve been sitting all day for a portrait of one of my
rugs. Come and look at this masterpiece!\x{2019}


Miss Carter rose and stood aside. Mor came and looked at the canvas. It seemed
to be empty, except for one small finely worked square of colour in the corner.
A few faint lines were scattered about on the rest of the expanse. It looked
odd to Mor, but he supposed Miss Carter knew what she was doing.


\x{2018}Well, well,\x{2019} said Mor.


Demoyte laughed explosively. \x{2018}He can\x{2019}t think of anything to say,\x{2019} he said.
Never mind, missie, they\x{2019}ll all be crawling to you later on.\x{2018}


Mor was irritated. Demoyte was making it look as if he had been rude. \x{2018}Miss
Carter knows I have complete faith in her talent,\x{2019} said Mor. This sounded
idiotic. He tried to help it out by giving Miss Carter a rather rueful and very
friendly look. She smiled back with such warmth that Mor was quite consoled.


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s cant,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}You know nothing whatever about Miss Carter\x{2019}s
talent or anyone else\x{2019}s. This man doesn\x{2019}t know a Rubens from a Rembrandt. He
lives in a monochrome world.\x{2019}


Mor felt this was cruel, as well as being unjust. He tried to carry it off. \x{2018}I
spoke of faith,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Blessed is he who has not seen, but has believed! I
believe in Miss Carter.\x{2019} This was weak, but Miss Carter was still smiling at
him in an encouraging way and that seemed to make the words stand up.


\x{2018}Oh well,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}now you\x{2019}re talking about Miss Carter, not her talent.
This conversation is degenerating into imbecility. Have you dined?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Thank you, sir, yes,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}So have we,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}and Miss Carter was painting until a few minutes
ago. I suggest we all have some brandy. Miss Carter must be exhausted. She\x{2019}s
been painting, or pretending to paint, for about six hours.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I am tired,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}Mr Demoyte doesn\x{2019}t believe it, but I\x{2019}ve
done a great deal of work today.\x{2019}


Mor was surprised to hear this. He had vaguely imagined that after the trials
of yesterday Miss Carter would have spent today lying down in a state of
collapse. He gave her a look of admiration, which he hoped she was able to
interpret. Miss Carter was wearing her trousers, and had tossed off her overall
soon after he entered to reveal a plain white cotton shirt. With her short dark
hair and the strong dusky red of her cheeks she looked like Pierrot, and had,
it suddenly seemed to Mor, something of his grotesque melancholy.


Mor and Miss Carter moved to chairs beside the hearth. Demoyte was fiddling in
a comer cupboard. \x{2018}Where the hell are the brandy glasses?\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Handy will
use them for drinking lemonade out of in the kitchen. I must go and find them.
You two can amuse yourselves.\x{2019} He turned and went out of the door, leaving it
open.


Mor knew that now was his chance to give Miss Carter the letter. He was
overcome with confusion and stood up, blushing violently. Miss Carter looked up
at him, a trifle surprised. Mor fumbled in his pocket for the letter, and took
a moment or two to find it. Then he drew it forth and threw it quickly on to
her knee. It fell to the floor, and she picked it up with a puzzled look. As
she did this, a movement caught Mor\x{2019}s eye and he looked over Miss Carter\x{2019}s head
to see that Demoyte was standing at the open door and had witnessed the scene.
Miss Carter, who had her back to the door, had not observed him. She put the
letter quickly into her handbag, which lay beside her, and looked up again at
Mor. Demoyte withdrew for a moment and then re-entered the room noisily bearing
the glasses.


\x{2018}They were on the dining-room table,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Handy had got them that far on
the way back. Now I must go and see about the brandy.\x{2019} He left the room again,
closing the door behind him with a bang.


Mor felt acute distress at Demoyte\x{2019}s having seen the passing of the letter.
Everything seemed to be conspiring against him to make something which was
really unimportant look like something important. Now both Tim Burke and
Demoyte would be thinking that something was going on, whereas in reality
nothing was going on. What Mor had hoped to terminate and bury was being lent a
spurious significance by these witnesses. He looked at Miss Carter dumbly,
almost angrily.


\x{2018}The car is all right,\x{2019} she said in a soft voice. She had risen too. They stood
together near the mantelpiece.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m very glad,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}and I\x{2019}m so sorry I was so hopeless yesterday. Did
you tell Mr Demoyte about it?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No, I didn\x{2019}t,\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}Perhaps it was silly of me, but I felt
somehow I didn\x{2019}t want to. I just said the car had gone for repairs.\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s just as well,\x{2019} said Mor. He spoke softly too. \x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t told my wife
either. That note explains.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Then it\x{2019}s to be a secret between us,\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


Mor didn\x{2019}t care for this phrase, but he nodded. \x{2018}I insist on paying the bills,\x{2019}
he said. \x{2018}You must let me know -\x{2019}


\x{2018}Of course not!\x{2019} said Miss Carter. \x{2018}The insurance will pay, that\x{2019}s what they\x{2019}re
for!\x{2019}


At that moment Demoyte returned noisily into the room. \x{2018}Why,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}the
brandy was in here all the time!\x{2019}


Mor now felt a deep sadness that what were probably the last words which he
would ever exchange t\x{ea}te-\x{e0}-t\x{ea}te with Miss Carter had been such futile
ones. He sat down gloomily and accepted a glass of brandy.


Miss Carter seemed to be in good spirits. She turned to Mor. \x{2018}Do you mind if I
draw you,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}as you sit drinking the cognac?\x{2019}


Mor Was surprised and flattered at this request. He blushed again, this time
with pleasure. \x{2018}Please do!\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Am I all right as I am?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Exactly as you are,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}is how I want you.\x{2019} She picked up her
sketch book, produced a pencil from her handbag, and began to draw, sipping
brandy now and then as she did so.


Mor sat perfectly still, conscious on the one side of the gentle intent glances
of Miss Carter, and on the other of the sardonic covertly amused attention of
Demoyte. He felt like a man with one cheek exposed to the fragrant breezes of
the spring, while upon the other is let loose an autumnal shower of chilling
rain.


Demoyte seemed to have decided not to take any part in the conversation. He sat
at his ease looking first at Mor and then at Miss Carter. Mor thought, he wants
to force us to talk so that he can observe us, the old fox.


Miss Carter said, \x{2018}What is your son\x{2019}s name, Mr Mor?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Donald,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}I was so sorry I didn\x{2019}t meet him the other day,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, her eyes
moving to and fro between Mor and her sketch book. Have you any other
children?\x{2018}


\x{2018}I have a daughter,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}<<about fourteen|9k:1>>. Her name is Felicity.\x{2019} It gave
him pain, somehow, to speak of his children to Miss Carter. She herself must
be, he reckoned, no more than eight years older than Donald.


\x{2018}What is Donald going to do?\x{2019} said Miss Carter.


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s taking College entrance in chemistry in a few weeks,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I
suppose he\x{2019}ll be some sort of chemist.\x{2019} Mor wished he could have said something
else about Donald.


\x{2018}And your daughter,\x{2019} said Miss Carter, \x{2018}what will she do?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t know,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I expect she\x{2019}ll have another term or two at school
and then do a secretarial course next year. She\x{2019}s not very clever.\x{2019}


Demoyte could not let this pass. \x{2018}Oh, what rot, Mor!\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}You don\x{2019}t
seriously mean that you\x{2019}re going to let Felicity leave school? She\x{2019}s just slow
at developing. After a year or two in the Sixth Form she\x{2019}ll be a different
person. She ought to go to a university. Even if she couldn\x{2019}t get into Oxford
or Cambridge, she could go to London. Give the girl a chance, for heaven\x{2019}s
sake. Or would you rather see her as a little secretary reading the fashion
magazines?\x{2019}


Mor felt hurt and irritated. He turned towards Demoyte, but turned hastily back
again as he saw Miss Carter\x{2019}s pencil poised. In fact, he was of Demoyte\x{2019}s
opinion. But there was Nan, and the financial situation to be considered. Anyhow,
nothing had been settled yet. He had only answered in that way so as to have
something definite to say - and also, it suddenly occurred to him, because he
had wanted, for some reason, to make everything look as dreary as possible.


He said to Miss Carter, Mr Demoyte has a rather exaggerated view of the
benefits of education. He thinks that no one can stand up unless he\x{2019}s had the
stuffing put in by his school and college.\x{2018}


Demoyte said sharply, \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t attribute that cant to me, if you please. Someone
like Miss Carter, for instance, could stand up whatever her education had been.
It\x{2019}s people like you and your daughter that need stuffing put into them.\x{2019}


This was so spitefully uttered that Mor was silent. He felt quite unable to
reply. Miss Carter\x{2019}s pencil was still.


Demoyte was sorry at once, and said, \x{2018}There now, Mor, I didn\x{2019}t really mean it,
but you provoked me.\x{2019}


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s all right, sir,\x{2019} said Mor.


There was a moment\x{2019}s silence. Miss Carter then said, \x{2018}If you\x{2019}ll both excuse me,
I think I\x{2019}ll be off to bed. I really am very tired indeed, I can hardly keep my
eyes open.\x{2019}


Demoyte was obviously upset. He seemed to think that Miss Carter was retiring
as a protest against his rudeness. She tried gently to convince him that it was
not so. Mor looked on. He felt intense disappointment that Miss Carter was
going away so soon. It was the last time he would really see her. He drained
his glass.


\x{2018}May I at least see the picture of myself,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}before you go?\x{2019}


Miss Carter looked into the sketch book and then closed it. She looked rather
oddly at Mor. Then she said, \x{2018}No, I don\x{2019}t think so. It\x{2019}s not very good. Sorry,
I\x{2019}d rather not show it to you, it really isn\x{2019}t anything.\x{2019} She moved away
towards the door. Mor stood by the mantelpiece while she lingered in the doorway,
still disputing with Demoyte. Then she said \x{2018}Good night\x{2019} abruptly, and
disappeared.


Demoyte came back to the hearth, shuffling his feet. Without a word he refilled
Mor\x{2019}s glass. They both sat down and looked at each other irritably. Mor thought
it quite likely that it was Demoyte\x{2019}s rudeness that had driven Miss
Carter away, and he felt correspondingly annoyed with Demoyte. They sat for a
while, glumly.


\x{2018}You haven\x{2019}t got to rush away, have you?\x{2019} said Demoyte.


Mor knew that, for all his irritation, the old man badly wanted him to stay.


\x{2018}No, sir,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}This is Nan\x{2019}s Women\x{2019}s Institute night. I\x{2019}m in no hurry.\x{2019}
They settled down to their brandy. Mor wondered if Demoyte would mention the
incident of the letter. He was sure he was thinking about it.


\x{2018}She is so small,\x{2019} Demoyte began thoughtfully. \x{2018}What is she like? A small boy,
of course, but what else, with her small hands and her big eyes, and the way
she togs herself up in bright colours? She\x{2019}s rather like a clown or a
performing dog-in fact, very like a performing dog, with a pretty check jacket
on and a bow on its tail, so anxious to please, and doing everything as if it
were not quite natural, and with those eyes.\x{2019}


Mor thought this disrespectful. \x{2018}She seems very serious about her painting,\x{2019} he
said.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re a dull dull fellow, Mor,\x{2019} Demoyte said suddenly.


\x{2018}What\x{2019}s that one for, sir?\x{2019} said Mor patiently.


Demoyte smiled. \x{2018}I saw you pass her a letter, he said. \x{2019}I ask no more about
that. I just wonder whether you can really see her.\x{2018}


They looked at each other. Mor thought to himself, the old man is a little bit
in love with her - and he wondered what Miss Carter would think if she knew of
the tenderness she had inspired in this unexpected quarter. He felt he should
disillusion Demoyte. \x{2018}The letter had no sentimental significance,\x{2019} he said.


Demoyte looked at him critically, a little sceptically. \x{2018}Then so much the worse
for you, my boy,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Let\x{2019}s talk about something else - Felicity for
instance. You didn\x{2019}t mean what you said just now about the secretarial course?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Not altogether,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but it\x{2019}s not so easy to see what to do. An
academic career would be a gamble for Felicity. She might develop-I believe she
would - but she might just bungle it, and not be happier in the end. And
there\x{2019}s the question of financing her. Even with a county grant, it\x{2019}ll cost a
packet to put Donald through Cambridge. And I just don\x{2019}t know that I can manage
it for both of them.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}are you going to be an M.P.?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m going to be a candidate,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Whether I\x{2019}ll be an M.P. depends on
the electorate.\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s a safe seat,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}So you\x{2019}ve decided at last. Nan came round,
did she?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t told her yet,\x{2019} said Mor. He spoke tonelessly, swinging his brandy
round in the glass and looking down into it.


\x{2018}I take back what I said just now,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}I only said it to hurt you
anyway, as you well know - and because I was for a moment - never mind that.
I\x{2019}m immensely glad that you\x{2019}ve decided. My only sadness is that I may lose your
friendship when you\x{2019}re an important man.\x{2019}


This sounded so grotesque that Mor had to look up to see whether the old man
was serious. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll never be important,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}so don\x{2019}t worry!\x{2019} He felt too
moved to reply seriously.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m immensely glad,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}You\x{2019}ll get out of this hole, away from
pious Evvy and dreary Prewett, and dotty Bledyard, up to London, where you\x{2019}ll
meet all sorts of people. And women. Out of this hole, where all one can do is
pass the hours until it\x{2019}s time to die.\x{2019}


Nan had called Demoyte morbid. Mor himself knew something of the old man\x{2019}s
moods, and of the melancholy which afflicted him when he was alone. He said
briskly, \x{2018}Come, sir, none of that. I certainly don\x{2019}t despise this place. I only
hope I\x{2019}ll be up to the other job. And by the way, please don\x{2019}t mention this to anyone
just yet, not till it\x{2019}s officially made public.\x{2019}


\x{2018}With an M.P.\x{2019}s salary,\x{2019} said Demoyte doggedly, \x{2018}you can send Felicity to
college.\x{2019}


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s just what I think I can\x{2019}t do,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s too risky. In my present
situation at least I know exactly how much money I can reckon on. But in that
job, with unpredictable expenses, it\x{2019}ll be a long time before I know where I
stand. Anyhow, Nan would never agree. It\x{2019}ll be hard enough to get her to accept
the M.P. plan at all - and she\x{2019}d never agree if we were going to run this extra
financial risk as well. I might get away with one of these things, but not with
both.\x{2019} As he put it thus, it occurred to Mor that in a way he was sacrificing
Felicity\x{2019}s future to his own. This was an extremely unpleasant thought.


\x{2018}Oh, Nan, Nan, Nan!\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m tired of that woman\x{2019}s name. Who is she
that she has to be consulted about every damn thing that you do?\x{2019}


\x{2018}She\x{2019}s my wife,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re as timid as a water-snail,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}and a meaner man with money
I never encountered. Pah! I despise this meanness. Felicity must have her
chance. Listen, and don\x{2019}t turn down this proposal because I\x{2019}ve been rude and
you feel you have to put up a show of pride. Think of your daughter\x{2019}s future
instead. I\x{2019}ll pay for Felicity to go to the university. She\x{2019}ll get a county
grant anyway, so it won\x{2019}t be much. I\x{2019}ve got a pile of money in the bank, and
there\x{2019}s nothing to spend it on in this God-forsaken backwater, and as you know
I hate travelling, and as you also know I\x{2019}ll very shortly be dead. So let\x{2019}s
have no false reluctance or other posturing. I want that girl to go to college
and there\x{2019}s an end to the matter. I shall be wretched if she doesn\x{2019}t. Don\x{2019}t
cross me here.\x{2019}


Mor sat rigid, leaning forward and still staring into his glass. He suddenly
felt as if he wanted to weep. He didn\x{2019}t dare to look at Demoyte. \x{2018}You are
immensely good, sir,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}and I am very moved indeed, I think you know
how much, by your saying this. I won\x{2019}t pretend that I just couldn\x{2019}t accept the
offer. But it needs some thinking over. I might be able to afford it myself.
Also, quite honestly, I\x{2019}m not sure that Nan would agree to our accepting money
from you.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, give me patience!\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}Then deceive her, boy! Tell her it\x{2019}s a
bonus from Evvy, tell her you found it in the street, tell her you won it on a
horse race! Deceive her, deceive her! Only don\x{2019}t bother me with this nonsense.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ll think it over, sir,\x{2019} said Mor. Demoyte then filled up Mor\x{2019}s glass and they
began to talk about something else.


It was about an hour later that, rather full of brandy, Mor decided that he
must go home. Demoyte was already getting sleepy, and Mor saw him up the stairs
to his bedroom. Then he came down again, put on his coat, and let himself
quietly out of the front door.


He had to pause immediately when he got outside, so brilliant and heavily
perfumed was the night. The moon was rising, and was visible as a great source
of light behind the trees, and there was an immense concourse of stars,
crowding up towards the milky way. It was one of those nights, so rare in
England, when the stars give positive light to the earth. The garden was
present on either side of him, dearly visible and, although he could feel no
breeze, rustling softly. He looked up and could see the light on in Demoyte\x{2019}s
room, above the door on the left. The right-hand window was the end window of
the library, which stood above Handy\x{2019}s boudoir. It was dark. Mor walked across
the gravel on to the grass and passed through the door which led to the big
lawn at the side of the house, outside the drawing-room window. As he walked,
the moon rose above the trees and cast his shadow before him. He paused,
enjoying the sensation of walking quite silently upon the moonlit grass, and
turned to see his footsteps left behind him, clearly marked in the dew and
revealed by the moon. He felt an extreme lightness, as if he had become a
spirit. Very distantly the traffic rumbled upon the main road. But here the
silence hung in the air like an odour. He moved out into the middle of the lawn
and looked up at the house.


The room at the end of the house to his right, which adjoined the library and
had one window looking out at the back and one window looking on to the lawn,
was the best guest-room. There was a light on in this room. The curtains were
tightly drawn. That must be Miss Carter\x{2019}s room, thought Mor. She hasn\x{2019}t gone to
bed after all. It must have been a fiction, about being tired. She must have
been fed up with Demoyte. Or with me, he thought ruefully. Then quite
unexpectedly Mor was struck with a dolorous pain. He was really unsure at first
whether it was a physical pain or some sort of thought, so quickly did it come
upon him. He realized in a moment that it was an agonizing wish to see Miss
Carter again, to see her soon, to see her now. Mor stood quite still, breathing
rather fast. I\x{2019}m drunk, he said to himself. He never remembered feeling quite
like this before. He wanted terribly, desperately, to see Miss Carter. I must
be ill, thought Mor. He wondered what to do. It was all so inexplicable. He
thought, it would be quite easy to go back into the house. The front door is
still unlocked. And go up the stairs and along the corridor and knock at her
bedroom door. At the thought that this was possible and that absolutely nothing
stopped him from doing it if he wished Mor felt so amazed that he swayed and
almost fell. The pain of knowing that it was possible was for a moment extreme.


As he recovered himself and turned slightly he saw that someone was watching
him, standing in the shadow of one of the trees. Mor froze with fear and
indecision. He took a step or two back. Then the figure began to move and come
towards him, gliding forward noiselessly across the grass. For one wild moment
Mor thought that it was Miss Carter. He tried to say something, but the silence
stifled his voice. Then he saw that the figure was too tall. It was Miss
Handforth.


\x{2018}Why, it\x{2019}s Mr Mor!\x{2019} said Miss Handforth in her sonorous voice, scattering the
moonlit night about her in fragments. \x{2018}You gave me quite a turn, standing there
so quiet.\x{2019}


Mor turned about and began to walk quickly back towards the front of the house.
He didn\x{2019}t, above all, want Miss Carter\x{2019}s attention drawn to the fact that he
had been standing outside looking up at her window. The strange sensation had
quite gone. Now he only wanted to get away, and not to have to hear Miss
Handforth\x{2019}s brassy voice echoing through the darkness.


She followed him, still talking. \x{2018}I saw you out of the drawing-room window as I
was pulling back the curtains, and I said to myself, there\x{2019}s an intruder out
there on the lawn. So I had to come out and see who it was.\x{2019}


\x{2018}That was very brave of you, Handy,\x{2019} said Mor in a low voice. They had reached
the front of the house now, and Mor had gone a little way down the drive,
followed by Miss Handforth. He saw that Demoyte\x{2019}s light was out.


\x{2018}You can\x{2019}t be too careful,\x{2019} said Miss Handforth. \x{2018}There really are some odd
characters about. There\x{2019}s someone been reported hanging around this vicinity
lately, a vagabond man, a gipsy. Probably waiting to see who he can rob.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I hope you lock the house up well at night,\x{2019} said Mor. He felt that he was
being shown off the premises. They had almost reached the end of the drive.


\x{2018}He won\x{2019}t steal anything from our house!\x{2019} said Miss Handforth. \x{2018}Good
night, Mr Mor.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Good night, Handy,\x{2019} said Mor. He felt extremely disconsolate. He decided to
walk back by the main road.",

            "YOU
can\x{2019}t behave anyhow to people and expect them to love you just the
same!\x{2018} said Nan to Felicity.


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s just what I do expect,\x{2019} said Felicity sulkily, and went back into her
bedroom.


Mor, overhearing this exchange from downstairs, thought, she is right, that is
just what we do expect. He looked at his watch. He was teaching at <<two-fifteen|5b>>.
It was time to go. He called good-bye, and as no one answered, left the house,
banging the front door behind him.


Nan pursued Felicity into her bedroom. \x{2018}You have a good look in here,\x{2019}
she said, \x{2018}and you\x{2019}ll probably find it. It can\x{2019}t have gone very far. If you
don\x{2019}t see it, you\x{2019}d better look in my room again. I don\x{2019}t want to discover it
in my slippers or in my bed.\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s no good,\x{2019} said Felicity miserably, \x{2018}it must have crawled away into some
crack in the floorboards and it\x{2019}ll die in there!\x{2019} She began to cry.


Nan looked on exasperated. \x{2018}What possessed you to bring a nasty slug into the
house, anyway?\x{2019} she said.


\x{2018}It wasn\x{2019}t nasty,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}It was very sweet when it stretched itself
out, it was so long and smooth, and its horns were so nice. I only left it for
a moment. It was curled up into a ball, like a lump of jelly, and it kept
moving to and fro, but wouldn\x{2019}t bring its horns out. I thought it was stuck,
and I went for some water to wash it with, and when I came back it was gone.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, let\x{2019}s hope it went out of the window,\x{2019} said Nan.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m sure it didn\x{2019}t. It\x{2019}s just lost inside the house somewhere. I\x{2019}ll never find
it now.\x{2019} Felicity blew her nose.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}ve changed your room back again,\x{2019} said Nan with disapproval.


\x{2018}I like it better this way,\x{2019} said Felicity. She threw herself on the bed and
went on crying.


\x{2018}Oh, stop it, dear,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}do stop it, there\x{2019}s absolutely nothing to cry
about. Just pull yourself together and do something practical. I\x{2019}ve told you
several times to leave out your summer frocks for washing. If I don\x{2019}t do them
today they won\x{2019}t be ready in time for going to Dorset\x{2019} She went away
downstairs.


Felicity went on crying for a while. Then she dried her tears and began
searching again for the slug. It was not to be found anywhere. A few more tears
fell as she pictured its fate. It was all my fault, thought Felicity. It was so
happy out there in the garden eating the plants - and I had to go and bring it
indoors, away from its world. I won\x{2019}t ever do such a thing again.


Felicity went into the bathroom and examined her eyes. They were rather red.
She washed her face in cold water. Then she decided that she would go into
school and look for Don. This was something which was strictly forbidden by all
the authorities concerned. Her presence in his room could bring quite dire
penalties down upon Donald - and Felicity herself had frequently been told by
her parents never to enter the precincts of St Bride\x{2019}s except when officially
authorized to do so. Felicity, though strongly endowed with a sense of right
and wrong, did not have any particularly reverential attitude towards
authority, and her conscience functioned vigorously enough in complete
detachment from the adult world of prohibition and exhortation which surrounded
her, and which she often failed completely to make sense of. Felicity could not
see that there was anything innately wrong in her going into St Bride\x{2019}s to see
her brother - and this being so, the only remaining question was whether she
could do so with impunity. She changed her dress, and combed her hair, making
herself look as pleasant as possible. Then she ran downstairs and prepared to
leave the house.


\x{2018}Where are you off to, dear?\x{2019} asked Nan from the kitchen.


\x{2018}To the library,\x{2019} said Felicity at random, and leaving the house she ran along
towards the main road.


As she ran she whistled softly to Liffey, who soon came bounding up to run
beside her, turning to look at her every now and then, and smiling as dogs do.
She never came into the house now, or entered any human habitation. Since the
dissolution of her material body Liffey had become rather larger, and now had
black ears and a black tail, to signalize her infernal origin. There was as yet
no sign of Angus, but Felicity knew, now that Liffey had come, that it would
not be long before she saw him, in one or other of his disguises. Felicity
passed the main gate of St Bride\x{2019}s and began walking down the hill. A dried-up
grass verge separated her from the dual carriageway. Up and down the hills the
cars roared, going from London to the coast or from the coast back to London.
They came savagely up like bulls and sped carelessly down like birds, and the
swiftness of their passage made the air rock, so that as Felicity walked along
her dress flapped in a perpetual breeze. Towards the top of the hill the school
was shut in by a high wall, with broken glass on it, above which could be seen
the upper windows of the Phys and Gym building. Half-way down the hill, the
wall was changed for a high and well-made fence, above which could be seen the
red-tiled roof of one of the houses, Prewett\x{2019}s in fact, where Donald lived, and
then lower down the tree tops of the wood. After this, there was to be seen the
green-glass roof of the squash court, and to be heard the frantic shouts and
splashing from the swimming pool. Here the edge of the school domain began to
swing a little farther away from the road, and a grass verge appeared on the
inside of the pavement, and widened gradually as the arterial road and the grounds
of the school parted company. By now the white walls and slated roof of Mr
Everard\x{2019}s house were plainly visible at the bottom of the hill.


Felicity followed primly along the pavement, as if she had no interest at all
in the school. Liffey, who had been amusing herself by passing spectrally
through the bodies of several other dogs who were coming up the hill, was
running along now by the fence, and in an instant had passed through it.
Felicity paused and looked about her. Then she left the pavement and began to
follow the fence, which was now turning sharply away from the road. At a
certain point it met at right angles with another fence which was that of a
private garden which belonged to a house in a side road. At the end of this
garden, where the garden fence met the school fence, there was a shrubbery.
Between the two fences at that point there was a very narrow place through
which a slim body could squeeze itself. Felicity\x{2019}s body, though still of a
material nature, was extremely slim, and in a moment she was kneeling among the
bushes at the bottom of the private garden.


Here she could work at ease. The school fence was composed of slats of wood,
each of them about two feet broad. One summer holiday she and Donald had been
at pains to extract the nails which held one of these slats in place, and
secure the slat again by means of nails which projected at an angle from the
adjoining wood on both sides. Thus, by working the slat a little, it could be
slipped out, leaving a gap through which a body similarly slim could pass.
After pausing a moment to make sure that there was no one in the garden,
Felicity began to tilt the slat until it cleared the nails on one side. The
other side then slipped out easily and Felicity slithered through into the
grounds of the school. She then reached back through the hole and drew the wood
into place again.


She found herself in a dreary gardener\x{2019}s wilderness of rubbish heaps and
abandoned bonfires behind some trees below Mr Everard\x{2019}s house. She began to
walk along to her right so as to come up into the wood on the opposite side
from the squash courts. This part of the grounds was less frequented, and if a
neglected shrubbery which was part of Evvy\x{2019}s garden was taken into account,
there was good cover all the way up the hill. Liffey, who had been waiting on
the inside of the hole, glided noiselessly ahead of her, charming her footsteps
to silence. Felicity wondered if she would see Angus now. She had only met him
once within the precincts of the school, on an occasion when she had entered
illicitly and he came upon her in the form of a man sitting in a tree, who
observed her quietly without saying anything, and waited while she went past.
That was eerie. Felicity preferred Angus disguised as a bricklayer or the
driver of a police car. Remembering this occasion she felt frightened for a
moment. Liffey disappeared, as she always did at such times. By now Felicity
was in Evvy\x{2019}s shrubbery, making her way along, still close to the fence, by
crawling under bushes and slinking behind clumps of greenery. The ground rose
steeply here into the wood, and Felicity saw distantly between the trees the
sunny open expanse of the playing fields. She moved on in the shadows at the
edge of the wood. She would not strike dangerously across it until she was
nearly level with Prewett\x{2019}s.


Suddenly she heard movements in the woodland not far in front of her, and then
through the leaves she detected the flash of a white shirt. Felicity fell to
the ground, and after lying still for a moment began to crawl forward. Liffey,
who had appeared again, went before her, waving her black ears magically to
silence any sounds which Felicity might make. This was just as well, as there
was a good deal of bramble and crackly fern to be slithered through before
Felicity could see what manner of creature she was stalking. At last a lucky
vista gave her the view she wanted. Through a tunnel of green she could see, as
in a crystal, a man sitting on the ground with his legs drawn up in front of
him. He seemed to be alone. A book with wide white pages lay beside him. He had
probably been sketching. He had laid the book aside now and was staring
straight ahead of him, his arms clasped round his knees. She watched him for a
long time, nearly five minutes, during which his attitude did not vary. He was
a strange-looking man with big hypnotic eyes and rather long hair. She thought
that she had seen him before. After a while she remembered that he was the art
master. She would have taken him for sure as a manifestation of Angus, except
that Angus never appeared in the guise of people that she knew.


His extreme stillness began at last to frighten her. She was reminded of
stories of yogis and magicians. She began to wriggle backwards out of the
tunnel of fern; and when she was able to stand upright she ran away with
careful silent strides diagonally across the middle of the wood, regardless of
peril. She had managed by now to frighten herself thoroughly, and wanted only
to get to Donald\x{2019}s room as quickly as possible. As she neared Prewett\x{2019}s, Liffey
made off among the trees. In a moment Felicity emerged at speed from some
sheltering bushes and shot in through a small green back door into Prewett\x{2019}s
house. She paused a moment to listen. No pursuit and no sounds of imminent
danger. She was in a disused cloakroom, which now served to store boys\x{2019} trunks
and cricket gear. Distant sounds of laughter and banging echoed through the
house. There was a stale smell of wood and damp concrete and old perspiration
and sports equipment. Felicity moved forward into a dark space out of which
some wooden stairs rose into an equally dark region above. She fled up these -
hid while voices near by became suddenly loud and then died away - then shot
like a hare down the adjoining corridor and straight in through the door of
Donald\x{2019}s room.


Donald was lying full length upon the table. The window was open, and one white
clad foot was dangling somewhere outside. The other foot swung nonchalantly to
and fro over the end of the table. His head was propped up on some books and a
cricket pad. He was not alone. Underneath the table lay Jimmy Carde. Jimmy\x{2019}s
head was flat upon the floor and his feet were propped up on the arm of a
chair. One hand was dug behind the back of his neck, while the other hand had
hold of Donald\x{2019}s ankle. At Felicity\x{2019}s violent entrance they both jumped, saw
who it was, and resumed their former postures.


Felicity was very disappointed at not finding Donald alone. She had never been
able to make out Jimmy Carde; and since he had become her brother\x{2019}s best friend
a special hostility had existed between them.


\x{2018}Fella,\x{2019} said Donald, \x{2018}I have told you six times, and must I tell you again,
that you should not come in here to see me.\x{2019}


\x{2018}No one spotted me,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}I was very clever, the way I came through
the wood. I spied on your art master. He was sitting there like fakir in a sort
of trance.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Bledyard will put the evil eye on you,\x{2019} said Jimmy Carde. \x{2018}He stared at the
school cat once all through chapel. It was sitting outside the window. And it
died of convulsions three days later.\x{2019}


Felicity shivered. \x{2018}He didn\x{2019}t look at me,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}though I looked at him.\x{2019}


She began to wander round Donald\x{2019}s study to see if anything had changed. The
room was small and papered with a flowery wallpaper which had faded to a
universal colour of weak tea. A small mantelshelf was painted chocolate brown,
and a matching brown cupboard contained Donald\x{2019}s bed, which was folded up
during the day. A rickety bookcase with a chintz curtain contained Donald\x{2019}s
chemistry books, a number of thrillers, some books on climbing, and Three
Men in a Boat. A table, a chair, and a carpet with a hole in it completed
the room. Small pictures and photographs were dotted about at intervals on the
walls, fixed by drawing-pins into the wallpaper. The position of these pictures
was compulsory, since some previous inhabitant of the room had decorated it,
shortly before he left, with a pungent and ingenious series of obscene
drawings. In order to preserve these masterpieces for posterity it was the duty
of each succeeding incumbent, enforced in case of need by the prefects of
Prewett\x{2019}s house, to pin up pictures in the appropriate spots and see that they
stayed in place.


Felicity studied Donald\x{2019}s pictures. She had not been told what lay behind them.
She looked with interest, since she had not been in Donald\x{2019}s room since some
time in the previous term. A photograph of a lioness with her cubs. A coloured
photograph of Tensing on top of Everest. A small framed reproduction of the
Snake Charmer of Henri Rousseau, donated by the parents. A coloured
advertisement from the New Yorker showing some very fantastic-looking
cars. A photo of the St Bride\x{2019}s second cricket eleven. That was new. Donald had
only just made the second eleven. On the mantelpiece stood a photograph of the
parents, with the glass cracked. Beside it was an enormous pocket-knife with
several of its blades open, and a half-eaten doughnut.


\x{2018}Can I eat the rest of this?\x{2019} said Felicity Permission was given. After all,
there didn\x{2019}t seem to be much that was new.


\x{2018}Have you anything else to eat?\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m starving after that trek.\x{2019}


Donald removed himself lazily from the table and began to dig in a black tin
box which stood in the corner. Jimmy Carde got up, stretched, jumped on the
table and squatted there, bumping up and down on his heels and drumming on the
table top, in the rhythm of a recent dance tune. Felicity wished that he would
go away.


\x{2018}Here\x{2019}s a cake,\x{2019} said Donald. \x{2018}We\x{2019}re not very flush at the moment.\x{2019}


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s an ancient British cake,\x{2019} said Carde. \x{2018}It was part of Boadicea\x{2019}s
rations for her troops.\x{2019}


Felicity tried it. It tasted rather like that. She ate it all the same.


\x{2018}How are the parents?\x{2019} asked Donald.


\x{2018}Mummy\x{2019}s in a fuss about going away,\x{2019} said Felicity, her mouth full. \x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t
seen much of Daddy.\x{2019} She began to poke around in a coagulated mass of things on
top of the bookcase. \x{2018}What\x{2019}s that?\x{2019} She held up a long silver object.


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s a supersonic whistle,\x{2019} said Donald.


\x{2018}Supersonic!\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}What\x{2019}s it for, then?\x{2019}


\x{2018}People use it for calling dogs,\x{2019} said Donald. \x{2018}It makes such a high note that
only dogs can hear it and humans can\x{2019}t.\x{2019}


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s silly,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}Why not call the dogs in the ordinary way? Of
course, if it were a supersonic dog like -\x{2019} She stopped, since the existence of
the infernal Liffey was a secret between herself and her brother, and putting
the whistle her lips blew into it hard.


A thin piercing sound emerged. \x{2018}Oh, it\x{2019}s sonic!\x{2019} said Felicity disappointed.


\x{2018}You have to blow harder,\x{2019} said Jimmy Carde, \x{2018}and then the sound disappears.\x{2019}


Felicity blew harder, the note rose higher and was succeeded by silence. \x{2018}How
do I know it hasn\x{2019}t gone wrong?\x{2019} she said suspiciously.


\x{2018}It makes people neurotic,\x{2019} said Carde. \x{2018}They hear it without knowing and it
makes them feel queer. Chaps used to do it at the Nuremburg rallies, to
demoralize the other chaps.\x{2019}


\x{2018}What are Nuremburg rallies?\x{2019} asked Felicity.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re too young to know,\x{2019} said Carde. Ask your big brother to tell you
sometime.\x{2018}


Felicity blushed, and said to Donald, \x{2018}Can I have it, please? You don\x{2019}t want
it, do you?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Take it, Fella,\x{2019} said Donald magnanimously, \x{2018}and come and blow it outside
chapel during Evvy\x{2019}s sermon.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Have you seen Demoyters\x{2019} glamour girl?\x{2019} said Carde.


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}who\x{2019}s that?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Sleetie Carter,\x{2019} said Carde. \x{2018}She\x{2019}s painting Demoyters\x{2019} picture. Revvy Evvy
wanted her in his house, but Demoyters pinched her instead. She\x{2019}s one of the
rakish kind.\x{2019} He burst into song. \x{2018}A nice girl, a day-cent gur-ril, but one
of the rakish kind.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Is that her real name?\x{2019} said Felicity.


\x{2018}She\x{2019}s called Rain Carter, for some obscure reason,\x{2019} said Donald.


\x{2018}I saw your dad showing her round,\x{2019} said Carde. \x{2018}He didn\x{2019}t look as if he was
fed up either. I wonder if Demoyters has made a pass at her yet?


\x{2018}I think it\x{2019}s a pretty name,\x{2019} said Felicity. She felt extreme dislike for Jimmy
Carde. Her eye roved round the room. She wanted to change the subject.


\x{2018}Oh!\x{2019} said Felicity. She had just seen something in the corner, peeping out
from under a pile of coats and sweaters. She pounced upon it, and began to pull
it out. It was an extremely long coil of fine nylon rope.


Felicity felt dizzy if she stood on a step-ladder, and she shared her mother\x{2019}s
horror of the whole idea of climbing. \x{2018}Don,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}you promised you
wouldn\x{2019}t!\x{2019} She knelt down with her arm thrust through the coil of rope, as if
she were going to take it away.


\x{2018}Oh, cut it out, Fella,\x{2019} said Donald, \x{2018}why are you fussing about promises? You
never keep any! Anyhow, this silly rope doesn\x{2019}t mean a thing.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Don,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}you\x{2019}re going to climb something. What is it?\x{2019}


\x{2018}The school tower,\x{2019} said Carde.


Felicity knelt there petrified. There was a moment\x{2019}s silence.


\x{2018}Shut up, Jimmy, you fool,\x{2019} said Donald, \x{2018}and now for Christ\x{2019}s sake go away, I
mean you, Jim, not Felicity. I want to talk family policy with her, since she\x{2019}s
bothered herself to come.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Ah well,\x{2019} said Carde, \x{2018}Ah knows when Ah\x{2019}s not wanted. See you in the usual at
the usual.\x{2019} He sprang out of the door like a small panther and banged it behind
him with his foot.


Felicity came over and seized the cuff of Donald\x{2019}s blazer. He was dressed for
cricket. \x{2018}Don,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}Jimmy didn\x{2019}t mean it, did he, about the tower?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Of course not,\x{2019} said Donald, not meeting her eye.


The school tower could be climbed, but it had been done only once in recorded
history, by a man who was now an Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Town and
Country Planning. He had placed upon the topmost pinnacle the traditional piece
of porcelain, which had remained there for weeks until the games master had had
the sporting idea of shooting it down.


\x{2018}If you\x{2019}re going to climb it,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll tell the parents.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You won\x{2019}t do that,\x{2019} said Donald easily. Felicity never told. \x{2018}And just be
careful what you say in conversation. Any breath of this, and Carde and I would
be expelled. You don\x{2019}t want to ruin my career, do you?\x{2019} There was an inflexible
rule at St Bride\x{2019}s that any sort of climbing on the school buildings was
punished by immediate expulsion. This had been established after one or two of
the easier climbs had tempted a few amateurs. The tower, however, was
notoriously difficult, the chief problem being a fierce overhang which had to
be negotiated a little way from its base.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}d kill yourself,\x{2019} said Felicity. She was extremely upset. \x{2018}Please, please,
please don\x{2019}t do it, Don. I\x{2019}ll give you my camera, the new one, if you
won\x{2019}t do it.\x{2019}


Donald detached his sleeve, and taking his sister\x{2019}s arm in a friendly grip,
twisted it vigorously behind her black. Fella, darling,\x{2018} he said, \x{2019}just don\x{2019}t
make a fuss. If there\x{2019}s one thing I can not stand it\x{2019}s women making a
fuss. Carde and I won\x{2019}t attempt it unless we\x{2019}re sure it\x{2019}s absolutely safe. We
probably won\x{2019}t attempt it anyway.\x{2018}


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re hurting me, Don,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}What are those drawings on the
table?\x{2019} She dragged her arm away and pulled several sheets of paper out from
under a pile of books. They were sketches of the tower from different angles,
showing its various profiles in detail.


You see how business-like we are,\x{2018} said Donald. \x{2019}Once we\x{2019}re past here,\x{2018}
he pointed to the overhang, \x{2019}it\x{2019}s child\x{2019}s play. And we have an ingenious plan
for doing that. But we probably won\x{2019}t do it at all. It was just an idea. Carde
said it partly to upset you.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Don,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}please! I\x{2019}ll do anything you like. I\x{2019}ll do any
dare for you if you\x{2019}ll not do it. Dare me anything.\x{2019} There was an
old-established usage between them whereby if one wished the other to drop some
cherished plan he would have in exchange to accept any dare that was named.
This arrangement had not been invoked for some time.


\x{2018}Well,\x{2019} said Don laughing and lying back upon the table, \x{2018}what shall I tell you
to do? What about making another raid for the Power Game?\x{2019} The Power Game was
an invention of Felicity\x{2019}s dating from long ago. It was a sort of eclectic
witch-craft, which involved the purloining from the individuals who were to be
bewitched of various intimate articles, such as socks, stockings, ties, and
handkerchiefs, which were subsequently to figure in the various rituals and
ceremonies. The main point of the Power Game, however, as it turned out, had
not been the actual magic but rather the preliminary raids. In the course of
these raids a number of highly cherished prizes had been taken, including some
underpants of Mr Prewett, Mr Hensman\x{2019}s braces, and an elegant sponge-bag
belonging to Mr Everard, none of which had in fact been put to any magical use.


\x{2018}All right!\x{2019} said Felicity, tense and flushed, ready to dart away. \x{2018}Name
anybody you like.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, I don\x{2019}t know, said Donald, waving a careless foot in the air, \x{2019}what about
- oh, I don\x{2019}t know - what about - what about - Miss Thingummy Carter.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Fine!\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}I start now. Where did you say she was? Staying with Mr
Demoyte?\x{2019} She made for the door.


\x{2018}My dear girl,\x{2019} said Donald, shooting up like a jack-in-the-box. Stop! I\x{2019}m not
serious. You know we dropped all that long ago.


\x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t dropped it,\x{2019} said Felicity. She was near to tears. \x{2018}Liffey is
outside,\x{2019} she said defiantly, \x{2018}and I nearly saw Angus on the road.\x{2019} Angus had
been a frequent ally in the Power Game raids. The translated and immaterial
Liffey was Felicity\x{2019}s own private familiar.


\x{2018}Oh, do leave all that old stuff,\x{2019} said Donald, \x{2018}and for heaven\x{2019}s sake don\x{2019}t
cry. You\x{2019}ve been making a frightful row already. Anybody might have heard you.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, I\x{2019}m going on that raid,\x{2019} said Felicity, wiping her eyes. \x{2018}You agreed to
it and you can\x{2019}t take it back now. And if I do that you\x{2019}ll have not to climb
the tower.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Stop shouting, Fella,\x{2019} said Donald. \x{2018}If Prewett passes, we\x{2019}re both for the
high jump. Look, I\x{2019}ll see you out of this place. You\x{2019}re giving me the jitters.
Now follow me and keep your mouth shut.\x{2019}


Donald quietly opened the door of his room and looked both ways down the
corridor. Distant sounds floated in, squeals of laughter, a gramophone playing
jazz, a dull sound as of cricket stumps being rhythmically beaten together.
Donald waited. Then seizing Felicity by the wrist he dragged her out of the
room, took the stairs at a leap, and in an instant had her outside the back
door. Here he let go of her and ran ahead into the wood, zigzagging rapidly
between the trees. Fleet-footed Felicity sped after him. A moment later they
had reached the wall and could hear the roar of traffic on the road just on the
other side. Donald ran quickly along beside the wall until he came to a certain
place. Here it could be seen that for a length of about eighteen inches the
broken glass had been removed from the parapet.


Donald leaned crouching against the base of the wall. \x{2018}Jump on my back, Fella,\x{2019}
he said.


This was a familiar routine. Felicity jumped. Donald rose slowly until he was
standing upright, with Felicity standing upon his shoulders, her clambering
hands now reaching the top of the wall, and her head well over the top. She began
to pull herself up. Donald helped by putting his hands under her feet. She got
into a sitting position on top of the wall and then gingerly transferred her
legs over to the far side.


She looked down at Donald. \x{2018}Don,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m going on that raid. I\x{2019}m going now.
And remember you promised.


\x{2018}I didn\x{2019}t promise anything!\x{2019} said Donald, exasperated. \x{2018}Now shut up, Fella, and
get down off that wall before someone sees you.


\x{2018}I am going!\x{2019} said Felicity.


\x{2018}I forbid you to go,\x{2019} said Donald,\x{2018}and I won\x{2019}t pay you anything if you do. Now get
down off that wall.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m going now,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}and if you don\x{2019}t keep your promise I\x{2019}ll
never speak to you again. She addressed herself to the task of getting off the
wall. It was a big jump. She let herself down as far as she could, and then
closed her eyes. Next moment she was rolling over in the grass. She called,
\x{2019}Good-bye, Don.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Wait a moment,\x{2019} said Don\x{2019}s voice from the other side of the wall. There was a
prolonged scrabbling sound. Then Donald appeared on top of the wall. He drew
his feet up, half rose to a standing position, and then sprang down towards
Felicity, staggered, and fell at her feet. He recovered himself quickly and
then started walking primly up the hill as if nothing had happened. Felicity
ran beside him.


\x{2018}Look here,\x{2019} said Donald, and he sounded angry, \x{2018}you\x{2019}re going home now. I\x{2019}m
going to see you to the house and we won\x{2019}t hear any more of this awful rot.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You can see me home,\x{2019} said Felicity easily, \x{2018}but you can\x{2019}t keep me at home.
And as soon as you go I shall go off on the raid. Do look at Liffey. She\x{2019}s seen
that big black dog and she\x{2019}s waving her tail. Can you see her tail? Shall I
call her with the supersonic whistle?\x{2019}


Oh, shut up,\x{2018} said Donald. \x{2019}Felicity, I will not be blackmailed by you.\x{2018}


\x{2018}How do people stop themselves being blackmailed?\x{2019} asked Felicity.


\x{2018}Listen,\x{2019} said Donald, \x{2018}if you go on this silly raid I shall have to come too.
And if we\x{2019}re caught, everyone will think it was my idea.\x{2019} They had passed the
school gates and turned into the green-shaded maze of roads near their own
house.


\x{2018}If Demoyters catches us,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}he won\x{2019}t report you to Evvy. You
know he never reports anyone to Evvy.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Maybe not,\x{2019} said Donald, \x{2018}but Demoyters can be quite unpleasant enough on his
own account\x{2019}


I\x{2019}m not afraid of him,\x{2018} said Felicity. \x{2019}If you are, you needn\x{2019}t come.\x{2018}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ll torture you when we get back, Fella,\x{2019} said Donald. \x{2018}If anyone spots us,
by the way, we met a few minutes ago by accident.\x{2019}


They came down an overgrown gravel track between some garages and emerged on to
the fields that lay between the housing estate and Brayling\x{2019}s Close. There was
no shade here and the golden expanse was crackling in the heat. The hay had
been cut for some time and the grass was sharp and stubbly and very dry. The
footpath was crumbling and dusty. The hot weather had lasted a long time.
Felicity led the way, and they walked on in silence until they could see
distantly through the trees the rosy colour of the bricks and the glint of
windows. They paused. Then Felicity saw Angus.


He had taken the form of a gipsy, and was sitting not far from the path on the
edge of a dry weedy ditch. He sat with one leg down deep in the tall grasses of
the ditch, and the other folded upon the shorter grass of the meadow. He sat in
a dignified attitude with his head thrown back and his reddish brown neck and
chest exposed. He looked straight at Felicity. His face had a sort of
expressionless gravity. He was rather frightening. Felicity knew that it must
be Angus because of the weird aura that surrounded him, and because of the
strange unexpected manner of his appearance. This time it was certainly Angus.
She wished that he would not take on these somewhat disconcerting forms, but
she supposed that it was impossible for divine beings to manifest themselves
without being alarming, even when they wished one well. He sat so still that he
was almost invisible. Donald had not seen him, and Felicity decided not to
reveal his presence. She took Donald by the sleeve and led him a few paces on until
the gipsy was hidden by a hedge.


Felicity suddenly began to feel very uneasy. She wanted to go back. She plucked
Donald by the coat which he was carrying over his arm and said, \x{2018}Don, don\x{2019}t
climb that tower. I know it will end badly. Please say now that you
won\x{2019}t climb it, and then we can both go home.\x{2019}


Donald looked down at her. He touched her freckled nose lightly with his
finger. \x{2018}We won\x{2019}t turn back at this point, mister mate,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}As for the
climb, I probably won\x{2019}t do it. It was all Carde\x{2019}s idea anyway.\x{2019}


They walked on very slowly towards the house. In a minute the little path would
reach the low crumbling stone wall at the end of Demoyte\x{2019}s garden and turn away
to the left towards the road. It was the dead time of the afternoon. Donald and
Felicity, who were familiar with the habits of the Demoyte household, knew that
they could count on Demoyte and Miss Handforth being laid out in their
bedrooms, with drawn curtains, taking their siesta. To enter the house should
not be difficult. The only unknown quantity was Miss Carter herself.


While Donald was peering over the wall, Felicity looked about her. She was
still unnerved by the manifestation of Angus. At the base of the wall a great
many flowers were growing, and the freshness of their opening petals showed
even through the brown dust which lay upon them: ragged robin, tansy, campion,
valerian, and charlock. The flowers that grow in waste places. Felicity looked
down at them tenderly. Then she began to pick them.


\x{2018}Christ!\x{2019} said Donald. \x{2018}What a moment to pick flowers! Look, we\x{2019}ll get over the
wall there, behind those bushes, and work our way along under cover of the yew
hedge. Then come up close to the house, out of view of the windows, and walk
round to the front door. If it\x{2019}s locked, we try the kitchen. If anyone sees us
we say we\x{2019}re looking for Daddy, we thought he was here. Once inside the house,
listen for sounds - then upstairs, and trust to our luck. The Carter will
certainly be in the corner room at the back. All right? Follow me.\x{2019}


Donald sounded eager. The excitement of the chase had taken hold of him. He
dodged along by the wall and then climbed over it at a point where it was
covered by a clump of tall syringa bushes growing in Demoyte\x{2019}s garden.
Clutching her bunch of flowers Felicity followed. This wall was an easy one.
They walked cautiously, keeping close to the hedge, and then passed through the
archway into full view of the windows. In a quick stride Donald crossed the
open piece of lawn and was against the wall of the house. Felicity followed. A
moment later they were at the front door. It was open. They stepped inside the
house.


Within there was complete silence. Both the children were breathing deeply, and
it seemed to them that the sound must be audible on the landing above. They
stood quite still until they had recovered their breath. They looked at each
other with wide shining eyes, and Felicity took Donald\x{2019}s hand and pressed it
hard. Then with noiseless footsteps they crept across the hall and began to
ascend the stairs. The house was sleepy with the heat. All the windows were
wide open and the warm dusty atmosphere drifted cloudily in from the garden.
The beams of the sun, falling directly upon the staircase, made a zone of hazy
yellow light through which the children ascended on tiptoe. The stairs did not
creak. Once on the landing they could lay their feet upon a long thick
Baluchistan rug. They glided along it and stood poised outside the door of the
guest room. No sound came from within.


The doorhandle was made of yellow crystalline glass and slippery to the touch.
Donald took it very firmly in both hands and began to turn it. He opened the
door sufficiently to put his head through. Its opening had made no sound. It
seemed now as if no sound could be made in this silent and untenanted house.
Donald was still for a moment, and then he leaned gently through the door and
entered the room. With a breath of relief Felicity followed him. The room was
empty.


Once they were inside with the door shut a wild glee overcame them, and they
began to dance noiselessly about the room waving their arms. Felicity paused
and drew the supersonic whistle from her pocket. She was about to blow a
tremendous supersonic blast upon it when Donald stopped her.


\x{2018}But it won\x{2019}t make a sound if I \x{2014} \x{2019} Felicity began to explain in a whisper. It
was too much for them both. Convulsed with helpless silent giggling they fell
in a heap upon the bed.


\x{2018}But you said -\x{2019} Felicity began again in a whisper. It was no good. They lay
there writhing with smothered laughter.


At last Donald rose, pulled Felicity up and set the bed to rights. \x{2018}Now quick,\x{2019}
he whispered, \x{2018}find what we want and go. What shall we take?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Stockings,\x{2019} said Felicity firmly. She suspected that Donald had other ideas,
and felt a sudden feminine wish to protect Miss Carter against his
depredations. They began to flit about the room, opening drawers.


\x{2018}Here we are,\x{2019} murmured Felicity. She drew a pair of nylon stockings out of a
top drawer, waved them at Donald, and put them in her pocket. They turned to
go. Felicity took a last look round the room. She picked up the flowers which
she had left on a chair. The writing-desk beside the window stood open,
littered with papers. Felicity went over to it and began turning them over.


\x{2018}Come on!\x{2019} hissed Donald.


Felicity said, \x{2018}Why, here\x{2019}s a letter from Daddy, I wonder what he says.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Never mind,\x{2019} said Donald, \x{2018}better not look at it. Let\x{2019}s get out.\x{2019}


\x{2018}It doesn\x{2019}t matter, silly,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}it\x{2019}s only Daddy!\x{2019} She pulled the
letter out of the envelope and read it. She stood quite still. Then she put the
letter back on the desk and came away.


\x{2018}What did it say?\x{2019} said Donald.


\x{2018}Nothing,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}Let\x{2019}s go quickly.\x{2019} She began to pull him to the
door.


Donald looked at her face. Then he went back to the desk, found the letter, and
read it.


\x{2018}Come, come, come,\x{2019} said Felicity. She opened the bedroom door and stepped out
on to the landing. Donald followed. They walked with firm silent steps to the
top of the stairs and began to descend.


Half-way down the lower flight Felicity stopped in her tracks. Donald paused,
and then walked down to join her. Standing watching them from the drawing-room
door was Miss Handforth. She looked at the children. They looked at her.


\x{2018}Well, well, what a surprise!\x{2019} said Miss Handforth, her voice echoing through
the house. Miss Handforth was not a friend of the Mor children. \x{2018}This is a new
way to pay visits!\x{2019}


The Close seemed to shake at the sound and shiver into wakefulness. Donald and
Felicity stood there paralysed.


\x{2018}Come on,\x{2019} said Miss Handforth, \x{2018}has the cat got your tongue? What have you two
been up to up there, may I ask?\x{2019}


Donald and Felicity were silent. At that moment the front door opened and Rain
Carter came into the hall. All three turned towards her. She wore a white summer
dress with an open neck, and for a moment as she entered the sun blazed behind
her. She shut the door, and put her hand to her eyes, blinded for a moment by
the change of light. She took in the little scene in front of her; and then
turned questioningly to Miss Handforth.


Miss Handforth said, \x{2018}These are Mr Mor\x{2019}s children.\x{2019} Her deep voice expressed
incredulity and disgust.


Rain turned towards them. They stood, as in a group by Gainsborough, Felicity
posed with her hand upon the banister, Donald more sulkily behind her.


\x{2018}I am so glad to meet you at last,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}I think - Donald - I have at
least seen before - but I am so glad to meet you properly. And I haven\x{2019}t ever
met - Felicity. How are you?\x{2019}


Donald said nothing. He looked straight at her unsmiling. Felicity came
forward. She smiled at Rain. \x{2018}We just came over,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}to give you these
flowers. They are wild flowers, but we hope you\x{2019}ll like them.\x{2019} She handed her
bouquet to Rain.


Rain took them with an exclamation of pleasure and held them to her face. She
was a little shorter than Felicity and had to look up at her. \x{2018}They are beautiful,\x{2019}
she said. \x{2018}I love these English wild flowers. I really really cannot think of
anything that would have pleased me more. How very kind of you to think of this.
They are lovely flowers.\x{2019} She held them close to her.


Donald came down the stairs and stood beside his sister. He took her arm.


\x{2018}You aren\x{2019}t going already?\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}Do stay and talk to me. Miss Handforth,
I wonder if - some tea? It\x{2019}s about tea-time anyway, isn\x{2019}t it? I don\x{2019}t want to
bother you. Or perhaps just some milk and cakes if there are any?\x{2019}


Miss Handforth said nothing.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m afraid we have to go at once,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m so sorry. We\x{2019}re
expected at home and we\x{2019}re late already. We just called to bring the flowers.\x{2019}


\x{2018}How very dear of you,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}You have made me glad. Thank you so
much. I hope we shall meet again soon.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I hope so too,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}Well, good-bye. Good-bye, Miss Handforth.\x{2019} The
two children disappeared rapidly out of the front door.


They walked quickly through the front gates of Mr Demoyte s garden and then
along the little path that led back again into the fields. Once Felicity was on
the path she began to run, and Donald had to run hard to keep pace with her. As
soon as they were well clear of the house Felicity turned off the path, ran
across a field, and threw herself down in the stubble in the shadow of a hedge.
Donald joined her and sat down beside her. They were silent for some time.


\x{2018}Don,\x{2019} said Felicity at last, \x{2018}you won\x{2019}t do that climb, will you?\x{2019}


Donald did not answer for a moment. \x{2018}It hardly matters one way or the other,\x{2019}
he said, \x{2018}now.\x{2019}


They sat looking down into the stubble. \x{2018}Tears of blood,\x{2019} said Felicity. This
was an ancient ritual.


Without a word Donald drew a razor blade from his pocket and handed it to her.
Carefully she made a tiny slit be neath each eye. Both the Mor children could
weep at will. A moment later mingled tears and blood were coursing down their
cheeks.",

            "IT
was the day of Nan\x{2019}s departure. Mor viewed the prospect with relief. For some
time now their small house had been a scene where washing, drying and ironing
of clothes, discovey and renovation of suitcases, unfolding of maps, and
discussion of trains and seat reservations and the weather, had gone on without
intermission until Mor had been obliged to invent excuses for staying in
school. End of term exams were just beginning, and although this meant less
teaching it meant more correcting, and it was about this time too that Mor had
to settle down to the organization of reports and the solving of various staff
problems for next term with which Evvy was patently unable to deal. His house
became intolerable to him. It was always too small, though usually it was better
in summer than in winter, since open windows could lend extra space to the
rooms. But Nan could be relied upon to turn the place topsy-turvy before a
holiday, and Felicity was being more than usually tiresome and tearful. Mor\x{2019}s
heart sank each evening as he came through the narrow front door, with its
panel of leaded glass, into the small hall-way, filled now with suitcases,
tennis rackets, and other paraphernalia. He would have liked to have gone over
to Demoyte\x{2019}s house to get away from it all. But although the Close and its
inhabitants were incessantly in his mind, he did not go. A general sense of
unrest and uneasiness filled him. It was now less than three weeks to Donald\x{2019}s
college entrance exam, and he was worried about him. He had called on him twice
lately to see how he was getting on, but the boy had been very short with him,
and Mor had gone away hurt and puzzled.


On the previous day, Mor had at last made a serious attempt to discuss with Nan
the question of his becoming a Labour candidate - or rather, as Mor put it to
himself, to announce to her his intention of becoming one; only it had not
looked very much like this when he actually came to opening his mouth. Nan had
simply refused to discuss the matter. She had used her most exasperating technique.
When Mor had settled down very gravely to tell her of his hopes, his ambitions,
his plans for how it would turn out for the best, she had laughed her dry
laughter, and sat there on the sofa, her feet drawn, up and her eyes shining,
mocking at him. At such moments she was invested with a terrible power which
shook Mor down to the depths of his soul. She seemed to withdraw into a region
of completely insulated serenity and superiority. Nothing which he said could
touch her then, even when, as he now remembered with remorse, he was driven to
making really spiteful rejoinders. It was not that she did not understand his
arguments. In her presence, in the overwhelming atmosphere of her personality,
his arguments simply did not begin to exist. Mor was astonished yet again at
the tremendous strength of his wife. She was totally impervious to reasoning,
relentlessly determined to get her own way, and calmly and even gaily certain
that she would get it. Throughout the interview she kept her temper perfectly,
laughing and jesting in a slightly patronizing way at her husband, whereas Mor
by the end of it was reduced to almost speechless anger. He had left the room
in the end saying, \x{2018}Well, whether you like this plan or not I propose to go
ahead with it!\x{2019}


Mor had said this at the time merely to annoy; but on the following morning he
thought to himself that perhaps that was exactly what he would do. The deep
wounds which Nan had inflicted on his pride tormented him without ceasing. He
felt, with a deep spasm of anger, that she had provoked him once too often. She
must learn that to trample upon the aspirations and self-respect of another is
a crime which brings an almost automatic retribution. Mor thought to himself,
when I see Tim Burke I shall tell him to go ahead. When the thing is made
public Nan will have too much pride and too much concern for convention to try
to make me go back on it. She will have to accept it then. Mor got a bitter,
and he knew very unworthy satisfaction out of imagining Nan\x{2019}s fury when she found
that he really meant for once to take what he wanted. What annoyed him perhaps
most of all about her was the exquisite calmness of her assumption that when
she had made it clear that he was not to do something he would not do it.


All these thoughts, however, with a talent born of years of married life, Mor
buried deep within him, and behaved on the next day with a normal cheerfulness.
Nan too seemed completely to have forgotten their quarrel and to be looking
forward to the journey with unmixed delight. They were to catch the <<10.30|5a:1>> train
to Waterloo, have lunch in London, and then catch a fast afternoon train to
Dorset. A taxi had been ordered to take them to the station, an expense which
Mor disliked, but which Nan\x{2019}s colossal quantity of luggage seemed to make
inevitable. The taxi was due in a few minutes, and Felicity was still not
ready. She had been sulky and short-tempered all the morning, in spite of being
promised lunch at the Royal Festival Hall, something which usually pleased her
very much.


Nan and Mor had walked out into the front garden. The suitcases were piled on
the step. Mor looked down at the ill-kept tangle of dahlias and asters which
grew on each side of the concrete path. \x{2018}Look,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}Liffey\x{2019}s place is
quite grown over this year. You remember how she used to lie there and sniff
the plants?\x{2019}


\x{2018}That reminds me,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}A funny thing. I met that painter girl in the
street, Miss Carter, and she said the children had given her some flowers.\x{2019}


\x{2018}What?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Just that,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}They both went over to Demoyte\x{2019}s house, gave her a
bunch of flowers, and came away!\x{2019}


\x{2018}It is rather odd,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but I don\x{2019}t see why they shouldn\x{2019}t just have
taken it into their heads. Did Felicity say anything about it to you?\x{2019}


Of course not!\x{2018} said Nan. \x{2019}You know how secretive she is. It\x{2019}s a delightful
gesture, and Miss Carter, I may say, was tickled pink about it - but really,
Bill, you know our charming little dears as well as I do. Would they have just
thought of doing that? It must have been part of some joke.\x{2018}


Mor was inclined to agree with Nan, and the whole story upset him considerably.
He couldn\x{2019}t think what it could mean; and he feared his children especially
when they brought gifts. He said, however, \x{2018}You\x{2019}re fussing about nothing, Nan. It
was just a nice idea. I expect Felicity thought of it.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You\x{2019}re almost as naive as Miss Carter,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}and that\x{2019}s saying
something.\x{2019}


Mor was disturbed at hearing Nan mention Miss Carter\x{2019}s name. He had by a
curious chance seen Miss Carter twice in the last three days, once in the
distance walking in the fields, and once passing through the housing estate in
the direction of the shopping centre. On neither of these occasions had he
spoken with her, but each occasion had given him a strange and deep shock.


The taxi drove up. Mor lifted the suitcases. Felicity appeared and got into the
taxi without a word. Mor and Nan packed in and they drove in silence to the
station. Mor paid the taxi-driver and stacked up the suitcases on the platform.
They waited.


The sun shone from a clear blue sky upon the little station with its two
platforms, each covered with a neatly peaked roof, like a toy station. On
either side the glittering rails of the Southern Region curved away among pine
trees between which here and there could be seen the red roofs of tall
Victorian houses. Quite a lot of people were waiting for the London train, many
of them known by sight to Mor. It was a scene which he usually found
inexpressibly dreary. There was five minutes to wait.


Then it came over Mor like a sudden gust of warm fresh wind that Nan was going.
Nan was going. She was going. And this time next year, thought Mor,
perhaps everything will be different. Everything is going to be different. He
lifted his head. How good a thing it was that he had made his decision.
Obscurely in the instant he was aware of the future suddenly radiant with hope
and possibility. At the same time he was filled with a great tenderness for
Nan. He turned to look at her. She was glancing at her watch and tapping her
high-heeled shoe on the platform. She smiled at him and said, \x{2018}Not long now!\x{2019}
She seemed quite excited. Felicity was standing some way off looking over the
wooden palings of the station into the surrounding pine trees.


\x{2018}Nan,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}are you really all right for the journey? Have you got
something to read?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}I have the day\x{2019}s paper and this magazine.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Let me get you something else,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}a Penguin book - and what about
some nice chocolate?\x{2019} He ran down the station as far as the little stall that
sold papers and sweets. He bought a Penguin book of poetry, and a box of milk
chocolates, and two bananas. He came back and stuffed them into Nan\x{2019}s pockets.


\x{2018}Bill, dear, you are sweet!\x{2019} said Nan, taking the goods out of her pockets and
putting them into a suitcase.


The neat green train sped into sight round the curve of the line. The crowd
surged forward. Mor found two corner seats for Nan and Felicity and packed the
luggage in. There was not long for farewells. At these small stations the train
waited only a minute. Mor kissed his wife and daughter, and then with
breathtaking speed they were jerked away. Mor waved - and he saw Nan\x{2019}s face and
her waving arm recede rapidly and disappear almost at once round the next curve
and into the trees.


Mor walked very slowly back down the platform. He gave up his platform ticket.
He came out into the sun and stood still in the dusty deserted station yard,
which was quite silent now that the roar of the train had died away into the
distance. Mor stood there, arrested by some obscure feeling of pleasure, and
somehow in the quietness of the morning he apprehended that there were many
many things to be glad about. He waited. Then from the very depths of his being
the knowledge came to him, suddenly and with devastating certainty. He was in
love with Miss Carter. He stood there looking at the dusty ground and the
thought that had taken shape shook him so that he nearly fell. He took a step
forward. He was in love. And if in love then not just a little in love, but
terribly, desperately, needfully in love. With this there came an inexpressibly
violent sense of joy. Mor still stood there quietly looking at the ground; but
now he felt that the world had started to rotate about him with a gathering pace
and he was at the centre of its movement.


Mor drew in a deep breath and smiled down at the dry earth below him, swaying
slightly on his heels. I must be mad, he thought, smiling. The words formed,
and were swept upward like leaves in a furnace. He walked slowly across the
station yard to the wooden gate. He caressed the wood of the gate. It was dry
flaky wood, warm in the sun, beautiful. Mor picked splinters off it. He could
not stop smiling. I must be mad, he thought, whatever shall I do? Then he thought,
I must see Miss Carter at once. When I see her I shall know what to do. Then I
shall know what this state of mind is and what to do about it. I shall know
then, when I see her. When I see her.


He left the station yard at a run and began to run along the road towards the
school. It was a long way. The hot sun struck him on the brow with repeated
blows, and the warm air refused to refresh his lungs. He ran on, painting and
gasping. He must get to his bicycle, which was in the shed in the masters\x{2019}
garden. His desire to see Miss Carter was now so violent it was become an extra
quite physical agony, apart from the straining of his lungs and the aching of
his muscles. He kept on running. The school was in sight now. An agonizing
stitch made him slow down to walking pace. The pain of his anxiety shaped his
face into a cry and his breath came in an audible whine. He turned into the
drive and managed to run again as far as the bicycle-shed.


He dragged his bicycle out, manhandling it as if it were a savage animal. It
had a flat tyre. Mor threw it on the ground and kicked it, swearing aloud. He
looked about and chose another bicycle at random. It occurred to him that the
Classical Sixth would be waiting for him at <<eleven-fifteen|5b>>, to have a history
lesson. But he had no hesitation now. He had recovered his breath, but the
other agony continued, biting him in the stomach so that he almost could have
cried out with the pain of wanting to see her. He set off on the borrowed
machine, bounced badly over the gravel, on to the main road, and started up the
hill towards the railway bridge.


The hill was merciless, and his pedalling grew slower and slower, until the
bicycle was tacking crazily upon the fierce slope. He got off and pushed it at
a run to the top of the hill. Then as he sailed down the other side, seeing for
a moment in the distance the glowing walls of Brayling\x{2019}s Close, he uttered to
himself the word \x{2018}Rain\x{2019}. At a tremendous pace, pedalling madly now to catch up
with the speed of the wheels, he plunged onward. He turned the bicycle, without
dismounting, across the grassy strip in the middle of the dual carriageway, and
launched it like a thunderbolt into Demoyte\x{2019}s drive. The gravel flew to both
sides like spray. He fell off the machine and threw it to the side of the house
and then cannoned through the front door. The house was still and fragrant
within. Mor crossed the hall and threw open the drawing-room door.


The easel was still in place and Demoyte was sitting in the sun near the window
with his back turned towards the door, in an attitude of repose. There was no
sign of Miss Carter.


\x{2018}Hello, sir,\x{2019} said Mor, swinging on the door, \x{2018}where\x{2019}s Miss Carter?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Accustomed as I am,\x{2019} said Demoyte, without turning round, \x{2018}to being treated
like an old useless piece of outdated ante-diluvian junk, I -\x{2019}


\x{2018}Sorry, sir,\x{2019} said Mor, and stepped into the room, \x{2018}forgive me. But I did want
to see Miss Carter rather urgently. You don\x{2019}t happen to know where she is?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Suppose you come round to the front,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}if you have the time to
spare, that is, so that I can at least see your face during this conversation.\x{2019}


Mor came round and faced the old man, who looked up at him sombrely and waited
for Mor to make another remark.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Do you know where she is?\x{2019}


\x{2018}If you had come at practically any other hour of any other day,\x{2019} said Demoyte,
\x{2018}you would have found the young lady here at work. She has been toiling like
the proverbial black. But just at this hour of this day she has, unfortunately
for you, gone out for a walk.\x{2019} Demoyte spoke very slowly as if deliberately to
torture his interlocutor.


Mor saw out of the corner of his eye that a great deal had happened to the
canvas since he last saw it, but he did not turn to look. Making an effort to
speak slowly too, he said, \x{2018}You don\x{2019}t happen to know, sir, in which direction
she went or where I might have a chance of meeting her on the way?\x{2019} The pain
within him was continuing to bite.


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t, as you put it, happen to know this, I\x{2019}m afraid,\x{2019} said Demoyte.
\x{2018}I wonder if you realize that your collar has come undone and is sticking up at
the back of your neck in a rather ludicrous manner? I have never liked those
detachable collars. They make you look like a country schoolmaster. And you
seem to have got some oil or tar or something on to your face. May I suggest
that you set your appearance to rights before you continue your search?\x{2019}


Mor jabbed back at his collar, settled it somehow into the protective custody
of his coat, and ran his hand vaguely over his face. He turned to go. \x{2018}I think
I\x{2019}ll be off,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Thank you all the same.\x{2019}


As he got to the door, Demoyte said, \x{2018}She went by the path over the fields. Not
that that will help you much.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Thank you,\x{2019} said Mor. He ran out, seized his bicycle, and cycled out of the gate
and sharply round on to the little footpath. The machine bucked wildly as he
bounced over bumps and tufts of grass. He was riding now straight into the sun
and had to keep one hand raised to shade his eyes. There was nobody to be seen
on the path, and already the edge of the housing estate was well in view. Mor
ran his bicycle through an alleyway and on to one of the roads of the estate.
It was hopeless. He had much better go home now, put his face into some cold
water, and think again about what he was supposed to be doing. But instead he
rode past his house and up to the front gate of the school. It was just
conceivable that Miss Carter might have gone into the school to call on Evvy.


At the front gate stood the tall white-clad figure of the games master,
Hensman. He was lounging in an athletic way against one of the pillars of the
gate.


\x{2018}The good weather\x{2019}s keeping up,\x{2019} said Hensman. \x{2018}Perhaps we shall have a fine
day for the House Match for once.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes, it looks like it,\x{2019} said Mor. He had got off his bicycle and was standing
irresolutely at the gate.


\x{2018}Your son\x{2019}s not shaping too badly,\x{2019} said Hensman. We\x{2019}ll make a cricketer of him
yet. He\x{2019}s quite the white hope of Prewett\x{2019}s team. Not that that\x{2019}s saying much,
I\x{2019}m afraid.\x{2018} Cricket was not, in Hensman\x{2019}s view, taken quite seriously enough
in Prewett\x{2019}s house.


\x{2018}Yes, good,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}You haven\x{2019}t seen Miss Carter go past here, by any
chance?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Why, yes,\x{2019} said Hensman. \x{2018}I saw her on the playground about twenty minutes
ago. She was going down the hill with old Bledyard.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Thanks,\x{2019} said Mor. He forced his machine on rapidly down the drive. He felt a
slight chill at the name of Bledyard. He left the bicycle at the corner of Main
School in a place where bicycles were forbidden ever to be and began to run
across the playground. He took the path beyond the Library which led down
towards the wood. The path was a bit overgrown and he had to spring over
brambles and long tongues of greenery as he ran. Two boys who were coming up
the path stood aside and then stared after him in amazement. There was no sign
of either Bledyard or Miss Carter. Mor ran into the wood. He stopped running
then and listened. There was no sound except the soft continual pattering of
the leaves. He walked quickly on, turning off the path and dragging his
trouser-legs through the bracken.


Then quite suddenly he came to a clearing, and in the clearing he saw a strange
sight which made him become rigid with mingled distress and joy. There was Miss
Carter. But she had been transformed. She was a prisoner. She was dressed in a
long flowing piece of sea-green silk which was draped about her body, leaving
one shoulder bare. She was sitting in the midst of the clearing on top of a
small step-ladder. Seated round about her on the ground with drawing-boards and
pencils were about twenty boys. They were drawing her. Master of the scene and
overlooking it with a powerful eye was Bledyard, who was leaning against a tree
on the far side of the clearing. Before his attention was caught by Mor, he was
looking fixedly at Miss Carter. He was in his shirt sleeves and had his hands
in his pockets. His longish dark hair fell limply as far as his cheeks. He
looked to Mor in that moment like Comus, like Lucifer.


Mor\x{2019}s sudden irruption into the clearing was noticed at once. Bledyard parted
company with his tree, drew his hands out of his pockets, and stood upright. He
stopped looking surprised almost instantly and began to smile. His eyes and
mouth thinned out into two long sardonic lines. The boys all turned to see who had
come and stared at Mor with some astonishment. Mor saw that it was part of the
Fifth Form. He reached back mechanically to see whether his collar had stayed
in place. It had. Rain signified her awareness of his arrival by a very slight
movement of her hand. She was posing like a child, rather stiffly and without
making any motion. Bledyard was still smiling, his face stretched and immobile.
Mor suddenly felt certain that Bledyard must be reading his mind. He began to
walk round towards him, signalling to the boys to continue their work. He tried
to make his presence seem more natural by making to Bledyard the first remark
that came into his head which happened to be \x{2018}I wonder if I could see you some
time about reports?\x{2019} Bledyard looked into Mor\x{2019}s face, still smiling his
infuriating smile. He nodded without speaking. The boys had returned to their
drawing. Mor began to go round behind them looking at their work. He was
intensely conscious of Rain\x{2019}s presence, but did not dare to look at her. He
looked instead at the boys\x{2019} drawings. He knew that it would not be very long
before the <<twelve o\x{2018}clock|6>> bell would ring and she would be set free.


One or two of the boys were working with water-colours, others were using ink
and wash, others pencils only. Mor paused to look at Rigden\x{2019}s effort. Rigden
was good at painting, which was just as well, since he was not a star at
anything else. He had produced with pen and a brown wash a pleasing sketch, the
head extremely well drawn and the drapery falling in a strong flourish. Rigden
looked up at Mor. He could hardly believe his luck. Mor looked at the sketch
and smiled approvingly. The smile made Rigden\x{2019}s day. Mor moved on, glancing
surreptitiously at his watch. Jimmy Carde was sitting at his ease, his back
against a tree, one leg raised in front and the other tucked under him. As Mor
approached, Carde was whistling a little tune to himself, the same phrase over
and over again. Mor looked at his sketch. Carde was no artist. He was working
with a pencil and had a profile view of his subject. He had produced a squat
figure, the drapery gracelessly draw tight about the body, the breasts crudely
exaggerated. As Mor observed the sketch, Carde looked up, and in spite of
himself Mor exchanged a glance with him. He looked away at once. He hated
Carde. He was glad that Carde was destined for Oxford, not Cambridge. He did
not want him to go on being Donald\x{2019}s friend. At that moment the bell rang.


Everyone jumped. The boys shifted and some of them began to pack up their
things and rise to their feet. Rain stirred upon her pedestal and began to
hitch up the drapery. Mor saw this out of the corner of his eye. He looked at
Bledyard and found that Bledyard was looking at him. Mor prayed that Bledyard
was not blessed with a free period at <<twelve|9c:1>>. Bledyard was not smiling now. He
was moving his head gently to and fro in the way that was characteristic of
him. The boys had now all risen and were making off into the wood in the
direction of the studio to leave their paints and drawing-boards before going
up to school for their next lesson. Mor and Bledyard and Rain were left alone
in the clearing.


Rain was still sitting on top of the ladder. She seemed to enjoy being there,
perhaps because it added to her height. She drew her legs up and turned towards
Mor with a laugh. \x{2018}Mr Bledyard captured me, and see what a beautiful stuff he
brought out of his store-room,\x{2019} she said, unwrapping the green silk from her
body and spreading it out. Mor saw that she was wearing a flowered cotton dress
which left her shoulders bare.


\x{2018}I really must try to buy it from you, Mr Bledyard,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}and hand it
over to my dressmaker.\x{2019} She stood up on the ladder, folded up the silk, and
held it out to Bledyard. Her legs were bare and very smooth. Both men averted
their eyes and looked up into her face. She looked down upon them with the
slightly prim slightly pleased expression of a Victorian little girl.


Bledyard took the material from her rather gloomily. He cast a look at Mor and
seemed to hesitate. Mor stood his ground, trying to look like a man who was
willing to stand there all day if necessary.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Bledyard thoughtfully, \x{2018}yes, indeed, indeed.\x{2019} His tone made it
clear that he was not answering Rain\x{2019}s question. \x{2018}Well,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}I must go
I\x{2019}m afraid. I have boys boys waiting in the studio. You were most kind, Miss
Carter, to favour favour us with this delightful-\x{2019} His voice trailed away. He
seemed to have more difficulty than usual in enunciating. He opened his mouth
again, closed it, and turned away into the wood. His footsteps could be heard
for some distance receding through the bracken. Mor and Rain were left alone.


She sat down again on top of the steps and laughed. She seemed a little uneasy.
She said, \x{2018}I love posing for people -\x{2019} and began to rub one of her ankles. \x{2018}Oh,
I\x{2019}m stiff though!\x{2019}


Mor stood close beside her. His breath came quickly. He did not look at her
yet. He said, \x{2018}Rain.\x{2019}


Rain saw at once that something had happened and she saw in the same moment
what it was that had happened. She froze, her hand still holding her ankle, and
looked down towards the ground. Then gradually she relaxed. She said very
softly, almost thoughtfully, \x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} and again \x{2018}Mor.\x{2019}


At the same instant they both turned to look at each other. Perched upon the
ladder her face was level with Mor\x{2019}s. He leaned forward and very. carefully
enclosed her bare shoulders in his arms. Then he drew her towards him and
kissed her gently but fully upon the lips. The experience of touching her was
so shattering to him that he had now to hide his face. He let it fall first
upon her shoulder, and then, as he felt the roughness of his chin touching her
flesh, he bent down and laid his head against her breast. He could smell the
fresh smell of her cotton dress and feel the warmth of her breast and the
violent beating of her heart. His own heart was beating as if it would break.
All this happened in a moment. Then Rain was gently pushing him away, and
getting down from the ladder. She stood before him now, very small, looking up
at him. \x{2018}No,\x{2019} she said in a very quiet pensive voice. \x{2018}No, no, please, dear
Mor, dear, no, no.\x{2019} It was like the moaning of a dove.


She said, \x{2018}Would you mind taking the ladder back to the studio? You could leave
it just outside in the yard.\x{2019} She picked up the jacket of her dress, which had
been lying on the grass, and drew it on.


Mor stood as she spoke, his hands hanging down, looking at her unsmiling as if
his eyes would burn her. He had heard the beating of her heart.


She hesitated, looking down, her hand involuntarily held to her breast. Then
she said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m so sorry.\x{2019} Then she turned and ran away very quickly into the
wood.


Mor did not attempt to follow her. He stood for a moment, leaning with one arm
upon the step-ladder. Then, like one who is fainting, he sat upon the ground.",

            '[ap 09:15] The Sandcastle - Iris Murdoch.epub (1957 - The Sandcastle_split_004.htm) - quarter past nine',
            "IT
was a <<quarter past nine|10>>. Mor had found the time on the way back from Evvy\x{2019}s
dinner to buy a bottle of white wine and a bottle of brandy. He had tidied up
the drawing-room carefully and set the bottles there with wine-glasses upon a
tray. He had laid out a dish of biscuits. Now he ensconced himself in the
dining-room window, which looked on to the road, to wait to see his visitor
coming. At about dinner-time the sky had begun to be overcast, and by now it
was entirely covered with thick black clouds. The heat was intense and
quivering. A thunderstorm seemed imminent. But still the warmth and the
oppressive silence continued, seeming endless. The light faded, and a lurid
premature darkness came over the scene. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s like the end of the world,\x{2019} a
woman said in the road. Her voice echoed upon the thick atmosphere.


Mor sat in the window, shivering. He could not bring himself to turn the lights
on. He felt no pleasure of anticipation, no joy at the thought of what he was
bringing about. He did not know clearly what he was bringing about. He wished
that he had not spoken. He would not have spoken if he had not seen that look
upon her face. But what did the look signify? He knew that once again he had
taken a step along a road that led nowhere. And he had made it that much more
difficult for himself, and possibly for her, to dissolve this ambiguous thing
that was taking shape between them. Was it something, or was it nothing? He
must believe it to be nothing. At moments he could do so.


Earlier in the evening he had consoled himself with the thought that perhaps
she would not come. She would realize that he ought not to have spoken, and she
would know that he would have realized this too, and she would simply not come.
After all, the meaning of his five days of silence could not have escaped her.
He saw himself so clearly as contemptible: a middle-aged man deceiving his
wife, inefficient, blundering, and graceless. Surely she would not come. Now,
however, although Mor had no expectation of joy from her coming, he was in an
agony lest she should not come. He looked at his watch for the hundredth time.
It was <<twenty minutes past nine|10>>. It was now almost totally dark outside.


There was a sound upon the path. She had come through the gate without his
seeing her and had reached the front door. From the darkened window Mor watched
her tensely. She stood on the step. She was wearing a mackintosh, in the
pockets of which she fumbled for a moment. Then she drew out a letter, slipped
it noiselessly through the letter-box, and turned and walked quickly away down
the path.


Mor did not hesitate for a second. He sped out of the room and through the
hall. He did not stop to pick up the letter. He swung the door open and left it
wide behind him. He covered the garden path in three bounds. He saw the small
figure some way down the road, running now. Mor shot after her. The pain in his
heart turned into a fierce delight. He came up with her just at the corner of
the road and caught her by the wrist. It was like catching a thief. He said
nothing, but turned her about and began to pull her back towards his house. She
scarcely resisted him. Together they ran back down the road, Mor still gripping
her arm in a tight grip. As they ran it began to rain. They went in through the
front door like a pair of birds. Mor closed it behind them.


In the darkness of the hall he turned towards her. They were both breathless
from the running.


\x{2018}Rain,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}Rain.\x{2019} It did him good to utter her name. He picked up the
letter from the floor. \x{2018}You brought a letter to say that you had decided not to
come.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Rain. She was leaning back against the wall.


\x{2018}Why did you do that?\x{2019} said Mor gently, and did not wait for an answer. He
suddenly felt calm. \x{2018}Take your coat off.\x{2019}


She took it off and he hung it on a peg. She still stood there by the wall. Mor
came to her and picked her up in his arms. She was exceedingly light. He
carried her into the drawing-room, slammed the door behind him with his foot,
and laid her down gently on the sofa. Then he drew the curtains and lighted one
of the lamps.


\x{2018}May I read your letter?\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}Of course,\x{2019} said Rain. She was not looking at him.


Mor opened the letter. It read:


I am sorry. I ought not to have asked you to dine or said yes to your
invitation. No more need be said. Please pardon my part in all this.


He put the letter away in his pocket. Thoughtfully he took out a packet of
cigarettes, offered one to Rain, which she took, and selected one himself. Mor
now felt amazingly and unexpectedly at his ease. He was in a terrible fix. He
had behaved wrongly and he had involved another person in his wrong behaviour.
All this would have to be sorted out. But just at this very moment there was an
oasis of calm. He had caught her, he had brought her back, she lay there before
him, she was not going away at once, he would not let her. Then deep within he
felt again the joy which he had felt in the first day when he had looked at the
flaky wood of the station gate. He loved her.


Mor turned and looked at Rain. She was looking at him. He knew that there must
be a sort of triumph in his face. He let her read it there. She began shaking
her head. \x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}this is wrong.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Rain,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}did you want to come?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Of course I wanted to come,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}I wanted very very much to come. But I
oughtn\x{2019}t to have done. If I\x{2019}d really willed not to come, if I\x{2019}d felt clearly
enough how bad it was, I wouldn\x{2019}t have run the risk of delivering the letter-I
would simply not have appeared. But I couldn\x{2019}t bear the thought of your waiting
and waiting.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You wanted to come!\x{2019} said Mor. He could hardly believe it. \x{2018}Will you have some
brandy or some white wine?\x{2019} he said. What he wanted now was a moment of quiet.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ll have brandy,\x{2019} said Rain. She sat up on the sofa, running her hands nervously
through her dark hair. It ruffled jaggedly around her face. The rain was coming
down fast now. Its drumming increased in an alarming crescendo. Then there was
a flash and a deafening crack of thunder. They remained immobile looking at
each other.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}I think I\x{2019}ll have some brandy too. I feel a bit shaken after
all this.\x{2019} The air was growing perceptibly cooler. The drumming continued. Mor
turned on an electric fire.


He came and knelt on the floor beside the sofa. \x{2018}Dear darling,\x{2019} he said. He
looked upon her with amazement, with incredulity. \x{2018}How is it,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}that
you could possibly have wanted to come. That amazes me. How could you
want to see me?\x{2019} He touched her hair.


Rain took the glass from his hand and laid it upon the floor. Then she threw
both arms about his neck and drew him down until his head lay upon her breast.
She held him close, caressing his hair. Mor lay still. A deep peace and joy was
in him. He could have died thus. For a long time they lay quiet. The thunder rumbled
overhead and the rain came down steadily.


At last Mor lifted his head and began to kiss her. She returned his kisses with
an equal fierceness, her hands locked behind his neck, drawing his head back
towards her. When they were sated with kissing, they lay, their faces very
close, regarding each other.


\x{2018}When did you begin,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}to feel like this?\x{2019}


Mor considered. \x{2018}I think the very beginning,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}was when you took my
hand on the steps leading up to the rose garden. Do you remember? The very
first evening we met. I was so terribly moved that you took my hand. But I
didn\x{2019}t realize properly that I was in love till the day when I found you in the
wood, when the boys were drawing you. Oh, Rain, I looked for you so hard that
day, it was agony.\x{2019}


She stroked his face, her eyes burning with tenderness. \x{2018}That was a marvel,\x{2019}
she said. \x{2018}You came and released me from a spell.\x{2019}


\x{2018}When did you first,\x{2019} said Mor \x{2014} he could not find the words - \x{2018}notice me at
all?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Dear Mor,\x{2019} said Rain, laughing at him, \x{2018}I think it was when I was drawing you
at Demoyte\x{2019}s house that it first occurred to me that perhaps I was - falling in
love.\x{2019}


It stunned Mor to hear her utter these words. He looked at her open-mouthed.
\x{2018}This is all beyond me!\x{2019} he said.


Rain laughed again, a deep loose joyful laugh that was close to tears. \x{2018}That
was why I went to bed early,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}and why I wouldn\x{2019}t show you the
sketch. I thought you would certainly be able to read in it what I was
beginning to feel.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Will you give me the sketch?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}I want to keep it!\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}but I\x{2019}ll let you see it.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Rain,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}it was such torment these last few days. I wanted to see you
so much.\x{2019} He realized as he spoke that the torment had only not been
unendurable because he had suspected in his heart that he would see her again.


\x{2018}I know,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}I too - I\x{2019}ve thought of nothing else. I knew I oughtn\x{2019}t
to go to that cricket match. I stayed away all the morning and the beginning of
the afternoon. But then I couldn\x{2019}t bear it, I had to come.\x{2019}


Mor felt, it is fate, it is not our will. We have both struggled against it.
But it has been too strong. As he thought this, he answered himself. No, it is
our will. And with this came a great sense of vigour and power. He took her
triumphantly in his arms.


\x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} Rain said, murmuring into his ear, \x{2018}Mor, we cannot do this, we are
behaving like mad people.\x{2019}


Mor heard her, and her words moved in his head, becoming his own thought. It
was a searingly painful thought. He continued to hold her close to him. Such
pain could not be endured; and if it could not be endured, then there must be
some way to avoid it.


\x{2018}We have no future,\x{2019} said Rain.


He felt her tears upon his cheek. She is brave, he thought. She says this so
soon. I would have waited. He held her and went on thinking.


\x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}please speak.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Dear heart,\x{2019} said Mor. He sat back on his heels. The brandy was untasted
beside him. He drank some of it. Rain sipped hers. He felt as if they were
adrift together. A world of appalling desolation surrounded them. But at least
at this moment they were together. The brandy was putting courage into him. He
could not, he would not, let her go. Yet there was no way.


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t know what to do,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but I want to go on seeing you.\x{2019} Once he
had said this clearly, he felt better.


Rain was silent. \x{2018}I know,\x{2019} she said at last, \x{2018}that I ought to say no to that,
but I can\x{2019}t. If you want to see me, I shall see you. But we are mad.\x{2019}


Mor felt profound relief. \x{2018}It can\x{2019}t be,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}that you really love me. You
must try to find out your real feelings. Let us have a little time at least for
these things to become clear.\x{2019} As he said this he felt much better. Here was
something rational to hold on to. The situation was not yet quite clear.
Perhaps Rain didn\x{2019}t really love him - and if not there was no problem, or at
least not the same problem. They must wait a while to see what their real
feelings were - and during that time they must quietly encounter each other,
patiently waiting.


\x{2018}Do not deceive yourself,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}If our feelings are not clear now, they
will never be clear. If there is something called being in love, then we are in
love.\x{2019}


My God, what honesty, thought Mor. But he did not want her to lead him into a
place from which there was no issue. He countered at once. \x{2018}All right, call it
so - though how you can love me is still a mystery. But if it\x{2019}s granted that we
do see each other again, then at least nothing can be decided at once. We must
wait a while. I feel far too confused to make any decision - except the one
that we\x{2019}ve made.\x{2019}


Rain was sitting up in his embrace. She had emptied her glass of brandy. \x{2018}Mor,\x{2019}
she said with a wail in her voice, \x{2018}what is there to be decided? You are
married. You are not going to leave your wife - and really there is nothing
more to be said. We may see each other again - but in the end I shall have to
go.\x{2019} She hid her face in his shoulder.


Mor sat there thoughtful, in a strange repose. He rocked her against him. Was
it unthinkable that he should leave Nan? The thought was so colossal and came
upon him so unexpectedly that he drew in his breath. His mind closed up at
once. He would not think of this. At least he would not think of this now. He
must have time - and meanwhile he must hold Rain and make her trust him and
make her patient. \x{2018}Do not let us torment ourselves any more for the moment,\x{2019} he
said.


His tone impressed her. The remained for a while in silence. \x{2018}Have you been in
love before?\x{2019} said Mor. He was lying beside her now on the sofa, her head
pillowed on his shoulder.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}do you mind? I was in love when I was nineteen with a young
man in Paris, also a painter.\x{2019} She sighed.


Mor felt a fierce pang of jealousy. Rain at nineteen. \x{2018}A Frenchman?\x{2019} he said.
\x{2018}What happened?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}Nothing happened, really. My father didn\x{2019}t like him. He went
away in the end. He got married since, I heard.\x{2019} She sighed again, very deeply.


Mor held her violently to him. He wanted her.


\x{2018}You know,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}like Mr Everard you probably think that I must have
lived a very gay life in France \x{2014} but it wasn\x{2019}t so. We lived very simply in the
south, and we didn\x{2019}t often go to Paris or London. My father was so jealous of
everyone.\x{2019}


Mor tried to picture her life. It was difficult. \x{2018}You will tell me more,\x{2019} he
said, \x{2018}in time.\x{2019} It was a consoling phrase.


Mor looked at his watch. Somehow it had got to be <<half past eleven|10>>. Now that he
knew that he would see her again he was not anxious to detain her. He felt that
enough had been said to bind them together - and he did not want to alarm
Demoyte by keeping her out late. He said, \x{2018}You ought to go home, my child.


Rain sat up and made a rueful face. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve been very silly,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}I told
Mr Demoyte that I was going up to London and would spend the night there. I had
to say that so as to get away from him - otherwise he would have kept me the
whole evening. And I did intend when I\x{2019}d delivered the note to get into my car
and drive up to London. It\x{2019}s parked in the school grounds. But what shall I do
now?\x{2019}


\x{2018}You could go back to Demoyte\x{2019}s and say you\x{2019}d changed your mind,\x{2019} said Mor,
\x{2018}but it would sound rather odd. I think he\x{2019}d guess the truth or something like
it.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I should hate to hurt him,\x{2019} she said.


They sat there avoiding each other\x{2019}s eyes. The rain was battering the house on
all sides.


\x{2018}There\x{2019}s no earthly reason,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}why you shouldn\x{2019}t stay here. It\x{2019}s
idiotic anyway to go out on a night like this. You can sleep in Felicity\x{2019}s bed.
I\x{2019}ll go and put some clean sheets on it now.\x{2019}


She caught his coat as he got up to go. \x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}you\x{2019}re sure you don\x{2019}t
mind my staying and not -\x{2019}


Mor knelt down again beside her. I love you,\x{2018} he said, \x{2019}will you get that into
your head, I love you.\x{2018} He kissed her.


As Mor went upstairs he felt how strange and wonderful it was after all to be
keeping her in the house. He began to make up the bed. He wanted to sing.


Rain soon followed him up. \x{2018}I shall go to bed soon,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m terribly
tired.\x{2019}


Mor felt exhausted too and knew that he would sleep well. He sat down for a
moment on the edge of the bed and drew her on to his knee. She curled up, her
arms about his neck.


\x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}one thing - are you absolutely certain that your wife won\x{2019}t
come back in the night and find me here?\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s impossible, my darling,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}she\x{2019}s in Dorset. Anyway, she wouldn\x{2019}t
come back in the night. And I know she in Dorset.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I feel frightened all the same,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}I think I should die if she came
back.\x{2019}


\x{2018}She won\x{2019}t come back - and you wouldn\x{2019}t die if she did,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}But I tell
you what I\x{2019}ll do. All the outer doors have bolts. I\x{2019}ll bolt them all, including
the front hall door, and so no one could come in, even with a key. Then if my
wife should come we\x{2019}d hear her ring, and you could go out of the back door
before I let her in. But these are just wild imaginings. No one will come.\x{2019}


At last he left her to go to bed. He went downstairs and bolted all the doors.
When he came up again her light was out. He called good night softly, heard her
reply, and then went to his own bed. The rain was still falling steadily. The
thunder had passed over. Very soon he fell asleep.


 



Mor was awakened by a piercing and insistent sound. He sat up in bed and saw
that it was just daylight. A cold white light filled the room. It was still
raining. In an instant he remembered the events of last night. Rain was with
him in the house.


Then the sound came again. Mor\x{2019}s blood froze. It was the front-door bell. It
rang a long peal and then was silent. Who could be ringing at this hour? He got
out of bed and stood there in his pyjamas, paralysed with alarm and indecision.
Then the bell rang again, and then again, two short insistent peals. It must be
Nan, he thought - no one else would ring like that, as if they had a right to
come in. Horror and fear shook him. He crossed the room in the pale light and
put on a dressing-gown and slippers. The bell rang again. Mor went out on to
the landing.


At the same moment the door of Felicity\x{2019}s room opened and Rain came out. She
had already dressed herself. She must have heard the bell before he did. She
was carrying her stockings over her arm as she had done on the day of the Riley
disaster. He read upon her face the same frozen horror as he felt upon his own.
The bell began to ring again and went on ringing. The whole neighbourhood must
be being wakened by the sound. It rang out with violence in the dreary pallid
silence of the morning.


Mor took Rain\x{2019}s arm. Neither of them dared to speak. He began to lead her down
the stairs. She was trembling so much that she could hardly walk. Mor was
trembling too in fits which shook his body from top to bottom. The bell was
still ringing. It stopped just as they reached the foot of the stairs. Here
they were only a few paces from the front door. Mor drew in his breath. Their
footsteps must be audible. He could hear the patter of the rain outside. He
hoped that it would drown the sound they were making.


He drew Rain, half supporting her, through the kitchen, and unbolted the
kitchen door. His shaking hands could scarcely control the bolt. The front-door
bell rang again. Mor threw the kitchen door open and pointed to the gate in the
fence beyond which was an alley which led away into the next road. For a moment
he put his arms about her shoulders, and then he turned back towards the front
door.


As he did so his heart sank utterly. He did not know what sort of demon of fury
and suspicion might now confront him. He felt as if Nan would launch herself
upon him like a tiger as soon as he let her in. Slowly he began to draw back
the bolt. Then he opened the door.


Mor stood petrified with amazement. A man was standing on the step with his
back to the door. Violently, amazement was followed by relief. The man turned
his head slightly, then turned right round and looked at Mor with equal surprise.
They stood for a moment staring at each other. Then Mor recognized the man. It
was the gipsy-looking woodcutter whom they had seen in the wood, playing with
the cards. A second later Mor realized the fantastic thing that had happened.
The gipsy had been sheltering from the rain under the porch, and without
noticing it he had been leaning his shoulder against the bell.


In a wild relief Mor put his hand to his face. At the same moment he felt anger
against the gipsy for having given them such a fright. He said, \x{2018}You\x{2019}ve wakened
the whole house up. You were leaning against the bell. Didn\x{2019}t you hear it
ringing?\x{2019} The sound of his voice was strange, coming after the terror and the
silence.


The gipsy said nothing. He had not taken his eyes off Mor\x{2019}s face. He turned and
went away without hurry down the path. The rain fell relentlessly upon his
black head.


Mor closed the door. He ran towards the kitchen. Heaven only knew how far Rain
might have got by this time. He ran out of the kitchen door and nearly fell over
her. She had been waiting just outside the door. He pulled her back into the
house and began embracing her like a mad thing.


\x{2018}Mor, Mor,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}what was it?\x{2019} Her face was still twisted with fear and
her hair was plastered to her head, blackened by the rain.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s mad, mad,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}We must be haunted. It was that gipsy. The one we
saw in the wood. He was sheltering at the door and leaning with his shoulder
against the bell.\x{2019} He began to laugh in a helpless desperate way, clutching her
to him.


\x{2018}Oh,\x{2019} said Rain, closing her eyes, \x{2018}I was so frightened!\x{2019}


\x{2018}So was I!\x{2019} said Mor. He was still laughing, almost hysterically, and holding
her.


\x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}did you give him any money?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}of course not! I was very cross with him.\x{2019}


Rain released herself from him. \x{2018}Please, please,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}you should have
given him money. If we had given him money the last time he wouldn\x{2019}t have come
this time!\x{2019} She looked at him, her eyes still strained with terror.


Mor felt a chill at his back. \x{2018}My dear one,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}if you wish it I\x{2019}ll go
after him now and give him some money. He can\x{2019}t have gone far.\x{2019} They looked at
each other.


\x{2018}Go, please,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}I know I\x{2019}m stupid, but please go.\x{2019}


Mor went into the hall and drew on a coat over his pyjamas and put on a pair of
shoes. He found some silver. He left the house at a run.


The sudden chill silence of the morning appalled him. The rain was falling
steadily from a white sky. It must be <<nearly six o\x{2018}clock|6>>. He looked both ways
along the road. There was no sign of the gipsy. He ran a little way and turned
into the lane that led towards the fields. His damp footsteps resounded
strangely. As he turned the corner he saw the man some thirty paces ahead. Mor
ran after him, and as he came up to him he touched him on the shoulder. The
gipsy stopped and turned to face him.


\x{2018}Excuse me,\x{2019} said Mor. He suddenly felt very apologetic to the man and a little
nervous. \x{2018}I do hope you will accept this. I\x{2019}m sorry I turned you away so
harshly.\x{2019} He held out the money.


The man looked at him silently. He was wearing an old mackintosh which reached
well below his knees. From out of the upturned collar his streaming head,
carved by the rain into something more unmistakably Oriental, was turned in
Mor\x{2019}s direction. There was no comprehension in his face; but neither was there
questioning or any alarm. He looked at Mor as one might look at a momentary
obstruction. In that instant it occurred to Mor that the man might be deaf.
That would explain this strange stare and why he hadn\x{2019}t heard the bell ringing.
When he had thought this he was certain that he was right, and with the thought
came a certain awe and distress.


The man turned away, ignoring Mor\x{2019}s outstretched hand, and continued to walk at
the same steady pace towards the fields. His soaking mackintosh flapped at his
heels as he walked.


Mor stood still and watched him till he was out of sight. Then he began to walk
slowly back. He was very shaken, both by the ringing of the bell, the horror of
which was still with him, and by the gipsy\x{2019}s silence. He decided that he would
not reveal what had happened. He walked back through the abominable rain and
stillness. The light was increasing, but always with the same dead pallor. The
rain fell steadily, steadily. But for his footsteps there was no other sound.
The sleeping houses lay about him. He turned into the garden and came through
the door to find Rain waiting in the hall.


\x{2018}Did you give it to him?\x{2019} she asked anxiously.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I did.\x{2019}


\x{2018}What did he say?\x{2019} said Rain.


\x{2018}Oh, he mumbled some sort of thanks,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}and walked on.\x{2019}


Rain sighed with relief and let him embrace her.


He took her into the drawing-room, pulled back the curtains, and poured out a
glass of brandy. \x{2018}Dear child,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}you\x{2019}ve had a terrible hour. I\x{2019}m deeply
sorry. It was somehow my fault. Drink this.\x{2019}


Rain sat on the sofa, holding the glass, while Mor sat on the floor and laid
his head upon her knees. They stayed in this way for a long time.


So that this was the spectacle which greeted the eyes of Nan when twenty
minutes later she came in through the drawing-room door. She had entered by the
front door, which Mor had left unbolted after his return. The patter of the
rain had prevented the lovers from hearing the sound of her approach. The first
they knew of her presence was when they looked up and saw her standing in the
doorway and looking at them.


Mor was the first to recover. He gently and quite slowly disengaged himself
from Rain and stood up. He was about to say something when Nan turned, and
rushing away across the hall ran out of the front door.


Mor was about to follow her when Rain said, \x{2018}Do not go.\x{2019} She had risen too. Now
that the real horror had come she was much calmer. Her hand upon his arm was
chill but only slightly trembling.


\x{2018}I must go,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}You wait here for me. Do not go away. Wait here.\x{2019} He
spoke with authority.


Then for the second time that morning he ran out of the door in pursuit. He
looked up and down. There was no sign of Nan. He began to run towards the main
road, looking down all the side roads as he passed them. She was not to be
seen. The rain fell, blinding him, and making a grey curtain through which it
was impossible to see where Nan had gone. He came up to the main road. Already
a few cars were passing and a man on a bicycle was doggedly pedalling up the
hill. Mor looked and looked. He could not see Nan. He turned back into the maze
of suburban roads, and for a long time he ran to and fro searching for her. But
he did not find her. She had disappeared into the rain and the whiteness of the
morning.",

            "NAN
had had her first shock of discovery when she overheard Felicity talking by
long-distance telephone with her brother. The villa which the Mors rented every
year near Swanage was equipped with two telephones, one in the drawing-room and
one in the main bedroom. Donald had rung up; and imagining that her mother, who
had not hastened to answer the call, was still out shopping, Felicity had
spoken frankly with him. Nan, who did not think that children should have
secrets from their parents, had lifted the receiver in the bedroom and was
disquieted indeed at what she heard.


Nothing emerged very clearly from the conversation, but enough emerged to make
Nan suspect that more must lie behind. She sat for some time in the bedroom,
thinking hard. Nan\x{2019}s first emotion was extreme surprise. What followed it was
anger. This was mingled with what was almost a feeling of satisfaction at the
prospect of being able to find her husband so palpably in the wrong. After the
quarrel which preceded her departure Nan had had a small twinge of conscience.
She was quite sure that she was right to oppose Bill\x{2019}s foolish and unsuitable
plan; but she felt that perhaps she had been unduly unpleasant in her manner of
doing so. The information which she had gained from Felicity, vague as it was,
was sufficient to dispel her sense of guilt, and also to put her in possession
of a weapon which it was certainly at this time convenient to have. Not that
Nan imagined that Bill would persist much longer with his Labour Party scheme.
She had never in the past, in any major issue, failed to persuade him
eventually to see things as she did. But deep in her heart she was pleased all
the same to have this unexpected access of strength, although the source of it
was so extremely disagreeable.


Very soon, however, the disagreeable aspect predominated. Nan found herself
exceedingly disturbed. She was deeply certain both of her husband\x{2019}s correctness
and of his common sense, and it was a measure of this certainty that the matter
had appeared to her at first sight in terms of a momentary lapse on his part
which gave her, in her struggle with him, a momentary advantage. But now her
mind began to dwell on Miss Carter. Running over every meeting she had had with
the girl, she now saw her as the sly insinuating creature that she was. How
could she have thought her naive? Yet in a way she was naive. That sort of girl
was able to mature the most infamous plans behind a mask of naivety which
deceived even herself, living in an atmosphere of hypocrisy so total that she
was unable any more to distinguish the true from the false. Was it possible
that Bill really liked her? Presumably this soft cat-like nature must appeal to
some desire to be soothed and comforted which existed in all men, especially
middle-aged ones.


Nan had never reflected on this sort of matter before. She had never in her
life for a single second doubted of Bill\x{2019}s absolute fidelity to her. She did
not propose to start doubting it now. Surely the children must have exaggerated
or misunderstood. At the very most, all that was involved was some moment of
infatuation, something which even by now was over, dissolved into the air.
There was almost certainly nothing to it.


Or was there? Nan continued to be extremely uneasy and restless. What ought she
to do? She thought of writing a letter to Miss Carter, and even began in her
mind to compose one whose venom amazed her. But that was foolish. She had no
vestige of evidence, and with that sort of girl one never knew, she might have
the insolence to invoke legal proceedings. Nan had extremely vague ideas about
libel and slander, and a corresponding nervousness at the idea of putting
anything down on paper. And in any case, as she kept telling herself, it was
all probably a misunderstanding, there was surely nothing to it.


She wandered about the house and got through the afternoon somehow. She managed
to conceal her distress from Felicity. By <<six o\x{2018}clock in the evening|6>> she had
reduced herself to a condition of mental turmoil such as she never remembered
having experienced before. She decided that the only thing to be done was to go
home at once, explain the whole thing to Bill, and get it definitely once and
for all cleared up. Then she would be able to enjoy her holiday in peace. She
was surprised at her inability to behave with normal calmness. She decided to
go on the following morning. Then she tried to settle down to a book. It was
impossible. She told a story to Felicity about having to go to London to see
someone who was ill; she packed a bag and boarded the night train.


What Nan beheld when she entered her house surprised her very much indeed. She
had arrived home at this hour, not with any intention of discovering a guilty
pair, but simply because of her own impatience and the working of the train
timetable. It had never occurred to Nan to imagine Bill capable of bringing the
girl into the house. In a second she saw that she had been wrong throughout.
Things had certainly gone very far. She turned and ran, partly as an effect of
sheer shock, and partly because she needed to think again before she confronted
her husband.


As she ran away through the rain she could hear his steps pursuing her in the
gloomy stillness of the early morning, and she ran down a side road and into an
alley that led to some garages. There she stood quite still for some time after
the sound of his footsteps had disappeared. She leaned back against the fence,
clutching her small handbag, her feet deep in a dump of weeds which was growing
out of the gravel. She stared fixedly at the side of the house opposite. The
curtains were drawn. The people in the houses all about were still sleeping. By
now the rain had soaked through the scarf which she was wearing about her head
and was beginning to trickle down her neck inside the collar of her raincoat.


As she stood there Nan felt, for the first time since she had found out that
something was wrong, overwhelmed with sheer misery. She had felt amazement,
fury, and extreme disquiet, she had even experienced a curious exhilaration,
something of the instinct of the hunter. But it had not occurred to her to feel
exactly unhappy. She had never in her life allowed Bill to cause her real
unhappiness. There had been, there could be, no occasion for this. In her
situation, that of a successfully married woman, unhappiness of that sort would
have been merely neurotic. Nan despised the neurotic. But now she felt real
grief- which her husband had caused. Gradually the conception that he was
interested in another woman began to reach not only her mind but her emotions.
As she stood there, her back against the fence, chilled and soaked by the rain,
she felt that she had suddenly been dragged into some awful nightmare: she had
been driven out of her own house. Her hand went to her mouth. She shook with
the grief and the horror of it. The hot tears warmed her cheek, mingling with
the rain.


After a while Nan began to walk along the road. She walked through the housing
estate and out at the other end, through the shopping centre. The shops were
not open yet, but the day was beginning. People were passing on their way to
work. The rain was abating a little. Nan went into a public lavatory and
adjusted her appearance as best she could. Then she went out and boarded a bus
that would take her to Marsington. She wanted to see Tim Burke.


Nan\x{2019}s relations with Tim Burke were curious. She had known Tim for more than
ten years, ever since her husband, who was teaching at that time in a Grammar
School in south London, had first made his acquaintance through the Labour
Party. She had always liked him. He had, it seemed to her, a sort of absurd
grace and elegance of character which had occasionally, on particular evenings
which she still remembered, shown her husband to her by contrast as a rather
dour, rather dull and clumsy man. Nan had not, however, made much of these
thoughts, and would not even have kept them in her mind had it not been that,
at a certain moment, she noticed that Tim Burke\x{2019}s attentions to her were becoming
very marked.


Tim had always treated her with a slightly ludicrous sort of gallantry which
Nan had put down to his racial origin, and which she had often laughed at with
Bill, but which had pleased her very much all the same. Her husband was never
gallant. But now she began to feel, with a mixture of distress and pleasure,
that it was possible that Tim Burke was the tiniest bit in love with her. She
had said nothing to Bill about it, had made no effort either to see or to avoid
Tim, but had watched him closely. One evening <<about nine o\x{2018}clock|6>> she had been
alone with him in the shop. Bill had gone down the street to make a phone call,
since Tim kept no telephone. Tim had been putting a necklace round Nan\x{2019}s neck,
something which he often did when Bill was there. He was facing her and his
hands met behind her head to fasten the clasp. The clasp was fastened. But Tim
did not withdraw his hands. Then he kissed her on the lips.


Nan had been shocked and upset; yet in the very same instant she had been
delighted. She had pushed him away from her. Bill came back almost at once and
cut off any possible discussion between them of what had taken place. Nor did
either of them ever refer to it again. For some time after this Nan avoided
Tim, and saw him, if it were inevitable, only in the company of Bill. Tim
behaved in what seemed to Nan a very transparent manner, trying by his whole
bearing to indicate to her his regret for what had passed, combined with his
continued respect and affection. But Bill noticed nothing, and Nan said
nothing. That was four years ago. Gradually relations between them became more
natural, and Nan began to remember the incident not with any pain but with a
sort of sad gratification. She could not help hoping that Tim Burke remembered
it in this way too. It was packed away forever. But the distant thought of it
gave a special fragrance to the infrequent occasions on which, always in the
company of her husband, Nan permitted herself to see the Irishman.


As Nan sat on the bus, her tearful face turned towards the glass of the window,
she did not experience any doubts or hesitations concerning the propriety of
visiting Tim in this crisis. She was in extremis. She must have help.
She did not know what to do. The idea of confiding in one of her women friends,
such as Mrs Prewett, was inconceivable. Her need to see Tim, once the notion
had occurred to her, was extreme. She sat there and suffered \x{2014} and more and
more the feeling that bit into her, appearing as a physical pang, was something
which she began to recognize as pure jealousy. She breathed in quickly through
her mouth and found that she had uttered an audible sob. She buried her mouth
in her handkerchief.


Nan got off the bus and hurried down the street towards Tim\x{2019}s shop. She saw him
far off, outside on the pavement. He was taking down the wooden shutters,
although it was not yet <<nine o\x{2018}clock|6>>. Nan ran up to him, touched him on the
shoulder, and went at once into the shop. Tim followed her in. He had seen her
face. He shut the shop door and locked it. The room was darkened, as half the
shutters were still up.


\x{2018}What is it?\x{2019} said Tim Burke.


Nan said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry, Tim, to come like this. Something awful has happened.\x{2019}
She kept her handkerchief pressed to her mouth.


\x{2018}Is Mor all right?\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Or is it the boy?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No, not an accident,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve found out that Bill is having a love
affair with that girl Miss Carter. I came back and found them in our house
embracing at <<six o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>!\x{2018} Her voice trailed away into a wail,
and she sobbed without restraint into the handkerchief.


\x{2018}Oh God!\x{2019} said Tim. He led her back through the shop and into his workshop. The
rain had stopped, and the sun was shining into the tiny whitewashed yard where
the small sycamore tree was growing. Nan went through into the yard. Here they
were in private. The yard was not overlooked. She put her hand on the slim
trunk of the tree.


\x{2018}Let me take away your coat,\x{2019} said Tim; \x{2018}it\x{2019}s drenched you are.\x{2019}


Nan gave up her coat and accepted a towel to rub her hair with. She sat down on
a little bench beside the tree, her back against the wet white wall. She felt
the dampness through her dress, but it didn\x{2019}t matter now. The world had
exploded into a lot of little senseless pieces. Sensations of the body and
small pictures of her surroundings moved around by themselves, now blurred and
now extremely clear. She saw with immense clarity the leaves of the sycamore
tree, still drooping with water. She reached out and plucked one off. She had
almost forgotten Tim Burke by the time he came to sit beside her.


\x{2018}When did this happen,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}that you found the pair of them?\x{2019}


\x{2018}What? Oh, this morning about six,\x{2019} said Nan. As she saw again in her mind the
scene with Bill sitting beside the girl on the floor, his head resting on her
knee, her tears were renewed, and she reached out and plucked another leaf from
the tree.


\x{2018}I tell you what,\x{2019} said Tim Burke, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll give you a sup of whiskey, it\x{2019}ll stave
off the shock from you.\x{2019} He came back with two glasses. Nan took hers
automatically and began to sip the golden stuff. At first she coughed, but then
she felt it warm and violent inside. She felt a little better.


Tim had swallowed his at a gulp. He sat down again. Someone was knocking at the
door of the shop. He paid no attention. Through her grief Nan became aware that
Tim was at a loss. He did not know what to do. Nan hated it when other people
did not know how to conduct themselves. She was used to taking control of
situations. She would have preferred not to have to control this one.


\x{2018}Did you know what was happening?\x{2019} said Nan, drying her eyes. The effort made
her feel better. \x{2018}Did you ever see them together?\x{2019}


No,\x{2018} said Tim, \x{2019}I didn\x{2019}t. I\x{2019}m sorry. But you know it\x{2019}s likely not anything
important at all. Whatever it is, it\x{2019}ll soon be done. Don\x{2019}t be too angry with
Mor.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Oh, don\x{2019}t!\x{2019} said Nan. Somehow to talk of being or not being angry with
Bill had nothing to do with it. That was not what it was like.


\x{2018}What did you do?\x{2019} said Tim.


\x{2018}I ran straight out of the house,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}and came here.\x{2019} She drank some
more whiskey and Tim filled up her glass. She reached out again to the tree.


\x{2018}You\x{2019}d better go back again,\x{2019} said Tim. \x{2018}Mor will be waiting, and he\x{2019}ll be in
an agony.\x{2019}


Go back, yes, thought Nan. The real pain after all was not that the world had
fallen into little pieces. That was a relief from pain. It was rather that the
world remained, whole, ordinary, and relentlessly to be lived in.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t be too hard on Mor,\x{2019} said Tim again. \x{2018}He\x{2019}ll have a bad time of it. And
anyway you are the stronger one. Yes,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}you are the strong one,
you know.\x{2019}


Nan knew. She would have to hold this situation as she had held all other
situations, controlling Bill, easing the effects of his clumsiness, guiding
them both through. She would have to cope with this. The thought was
melancholy but there was a little comfort in it.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ll go out in a minute,\x{2019} said Tim, \x{2018}and order you a taxi. But just now relax
yourself and don\x{2019}t be thinking what you\x{2019}ll say. Let him do the talking.\x{2019}


Nan thought, he wants me to go, he wants to be rid of me, to move this awful
thing away to another place. She felt no animosity against Tim. In the intense
rainy sunlight of the yard she saw his face close to hers, pale, unhealthy,
puckered up with distress and indecision. She reached out and found his hand.
They sat so for a while, rather awkwardly side by side, as if posing for an
old-fashioned photograph. Nan laid her glass down and with her other hand
plucked some more leaves from the tree. The sun was beginning to warm them. It
was a strange interval.


After a while Nan raised her eyes to Tim. He was looking at her intensely. She
sustained his gaze.


\x{2018}Come inside,\x{2019} he said, rising suddenly, and reaching a strong arm to pull her
to her feet. \x{2018}Come inside now, and rest in the big armchair.\x{2019}


Nan got up. The yard began to rotate quietly round her. The whiskey must have
gone to her head. She sat down again. The nightmare feeling returned. The
objects in the yard were present to her with an appalling precision. She made
an effort and stood up on her own. The yard was looking very strange, as if it
were growing brilliant and slightly larger. She saw that she had picked nearly
all the leaves off the sycamore tree. It stood there rather wretchedly gaunt
with a premature autumn, its shadow stretching up the bumpy wall which was
steaming in the sun. A curious light was shining. Nan looked up and saw
directly above her a rainbow displayed against a pewter-coloured sky. She
shuddered, and went back through the door which Tim Burke was holding open for
her.


In the little workroom it was very dark. Tim worked there usually by neon
light. Nan stumbled against the thick leg of the work bench. The big armchair
stood in the farthest darkest comer, a large decrepit thing, banished some time
ago from Tim\x{2019}s small sitting-room upstairs.


Awkwardly Tim led her towards the corner. Nan began to say something and turned
to face him. A moment later, half pushed by Tim and half collapsing of her own
accord she had fallen back into the grinding springs of the chair. She lay
there spread-eagled, suddenly helpless, her legs outstretched, her shoes
propped at the high heel. She saw through the small square window a section of
the metallic sky and a slice of the rainbow. Tim was leaning over her now, his
hands upon the two arms of the chair. He was leaning closer, and the window was
blotted out. Then, placing one knee upon the edge, he lay upon her, his arms
struggling to meet behind her back while his heavy body crushed her into the
depths of the chair.


Nan lay there limply, her hands upon his back and upon the sleeve of his coat,
not grasping, but dropped there like two exhausted birds. His shoulder was
pressing her chin back and her head sank into the deep dusty upholstery,
releasing a musty smell. For a moment or two Nan lay still, looking
thoughtfully over his shoulder through the half-open door of the workroom and
into the darkened shop. Then she wriggled slightly, trying to release her chin
from the pressure. She became aware that the weight of Tim\x{2019}s body upon her was
comforting, was more than that. She began in a half-hearted way to struggle.


At once Tim moved, taking his weight off her and endeavouring to shift her to
one side so that he could lie beside her in the chair. For a minute they
jostled, Nan withdrawing her arms and awkwardly edging away, her heels braced
and slipping on the floor, and Tim burrowing beside her, his big hands
underneath her body. Then they lay still again, facing each other. Nan found
that her heart was beating very fast. She felt a little fear and a little
disgust at finding Tim\x{2019}s white face so close to hers, his lips moist and
parted. Then she threw her arms about his neck and drew him up against her,
partly so as not to see any longer the staring look that was in his eyes.


\x{2018}Nan,\x{2019} said Tim, \x{2018}I do love you, you know that, don\x{2019}t you? I wish I could do
something for you, some good thing.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Nan. She knew that the strange comfort that she felt would last
only a few seconds longer.


\x{2018}Dear, I\x{2019}ve so often wanted to tell you things,\x{2019} Tim went on, his voice burring
in her ear.


\x{2018}What things?\x{2019} said Nan. Distantly she could hear the voices of people passing
in the street.


Oh, foolish things,\x{2018} said Tim. \x{2019}Things about Ireland, about when I was a child
there, things I couldn\x{2019}t tell to anybody else.\x{2018}


Nan thought, now Tim is going to tell me about his childhood. She had an
instantaneous vision of herself spending the morning lying in the armchair and
hearing about Tim\x{2019}s childhood. I must be drunk, she thought. She began to
struggle again.


This time Tim braced his hand against the back of the chair and pulled himself
out until he was kneeling beside her. Nan dragged herself up to a sitting
position. A light dust surrounded them and a smell of the past.


Now that she could see his face again Nan felt her despair returning. After
all, it was nothing but a senseless pause. Another minute and they would both
be feeling embarrassment. \x{2018}Please call me a taxi, Tim,\x{2019} she said.


Bowing his head, Tim rose and went out into the shop, closing the door behind
him. She heard him pass into the street. She sat up and began to search for her
handbag. She examined herself in the pocket mirror. As she saw her dishevelled
head in the half light she started quite quietly to cry again. But by the time
Tim had returned she had combed her hair and applied some powder to her nose.


When she heard his steps she got up and they met at the door of the shop. He
put his two hands at her waist.


\x{2018}Oh God!\x{2019} said Tim Burke. Words failed him.


\x{2018}Is the taxi coming?\x{2019} said Nan.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}ll be here in half a minute.\x{2019}


Nan looked into his face. Now that she was erect it no longer appalled her; and
suddenly she wished desperately that she could stay with Tim Burke that morning
and talk to him, talk to him about anything at all, about Ireland, about his
past life of which she knew nothing, about his hopes and fears, about when he
had begun to love her. For an instant she apprehended him there, pale, awkward,
strong, with his two large palms seeming to enclose her body. In that instant
she saw him close, mysterious, other than herself, full to the brim of his own
particular history.


There was a loud knock at the door.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s the taxi,\x{2019} said Tim.


They looked at each other.


\x{2018}Shall we send it away?\x{2019} he said.


Nan was silent. She wanted, very much she wanted to know him now, this person
that confronted her. She could not think how she had endured to have so little
knowledge of him. In the privacy and difference of his past, in all that had
brought him, by ways that he had never told, to the present moment, there lay
for her a promise of consolation and a long long solace of discovery.


\x{2018}If you could only come to me,\x{2019} said Tim, \x{2018}be with me somehow \x{2014} \x{2019}


Nan turned from him. With coldness, with violence, the reality of her situation
touched her, the irresponsible silliness of her present conduct. She shook her
head. She saw the glass of whiskey standing near by upon the counter and she
drank the rest of it in a single gulp. The knocking on the door was resumed.


\x{2018}Open the door,\x{2019} said Nan.


Tim fumbled at the latch, and then the pale sunlight was falling in a broad
shaft into the shop, as far as where Nan was standing. The taxi-man was waiting
in the road.


Nan came forward.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t forget me,\x{2019} said Tim, as she passed him.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Nan. She steadied herself out on to the pavement.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t forget me,\x{2019} he repeated, standing behind her in the doorway of the shop.


Nan got into the taxi. A moment or two later it was speeding away. Her grief
was restored to her.


As the taxi rolled along, Nan wondered what on earth she was going to say to
Bill. She had never been in a situation remotely resembling this with Bill
before. In ordinary life all her talk with Bill was planed down into simple
familiar regularly recurring units. Any conversation which she might have with
him was of so familiar a type that they might have talked it in their sleep.
This was one of the things that made marriage so restful. But from now on all
speech between them would have to be invented. The words spoken would be new
things, composing a new world. Nan did not know what she would say - but in
spite of Tim Burke\x{2019}s warning she was determined that it was she who would talk
and not Bill. She wondered if Bill would say he was sorry. What did people say
at a time like this?


Nan stepped out of the taxi. Tim had already paid the fare. The taxi-man helped
her out. He was wearing an odd expression on his face which made Nan realize
that her breath must be smelling strongly of alcohol. When she thought this she
staggered, and the gatepost came rushing to meet her at an unexpected angle.
She was beginning to feel a slight nausea which was just distinguishable from
the rest of her distress. As the taxi drove away she began to search through
her handbag for her latchkey. It didn\x{2019}t seem to be there. She must have left it
in the door when she arrived in the early morning. She looked to see if it was
still there. It had gone. She stood in the front garden wondering what to do.


She was very anxious that Bill should not know that she had been drinking whiskey.
So in what was to come she must keep him at a distance from her. She decided
not to ring the bell, but to go in through the drawing-room doors at the back
of the house, which were normally unlatched, and interview Bill in the
drawing-room with the doors open. These thoughts came rather slowly. In the
picture as she now saw it there was only Bill; it was a matter of managing him.
It was something between herself and Bill.


Nan began to walk round the side of the house, supporting herself against the
wall. She felt mortally tired. But when she reached the drawing-room doors she
found that they were closed and evidently bolted on the inside. This was
unusual. She pulled at them helplessly for a while. Then she decided that she
would get in instead by the low window which was beside the doors. It seemed to
be undone. She stepped on to the flower-bed. The earth was soft and muddy after
the rain. She pulled the window open and managed to put one foot through the
opening.


\x{2018}Nan, what in heaven\x{2019}s name are you doing?\x{2019} said Bill\x{2019}s voice from behind her.
He had just come into the garden by the side gate. Nan could see him out of the
corner of her eye.


She said nothing, but made desperate efforts to get through the window. She had
now got half-way, and was straddled across the sill, her skirt drawn tight,
with one leg well into the drawing-room and the other one still outside. She
could see the mud falling off her shoe on to the cushions of the sofa. Her
other shoe had come off, embedded somewhere in the earth behind her.


\x{2018}Nan!\x{2019} said Bill\x{2019}s voice again. He was coming towards her.


\x{2018}Keep away!\x{2019} said Nan. She was pulling furiously on the frame of the window.
She could hear Bill stepping on to the flower-bed. He put one hand on her
shoulder and one underneath her and propelled her forward into the
drawing-room. Nan collapsed on to the sofa. She had to restrain a strong desire
just to lie there and whimper at the idiocy of everything.


She sat up. Bill was still standing at the window looking in. He was holding
her shoe in one hand and was feebly trying to brush the mud off it.


\x{2018}Bill,\x{2019} said Nan loudly and clearly, \x{2018}how long has this business been going
on?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Wait a minute,\x{2019} said Bill. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll come round the front way.\x{2019}


As soon as he disappeared, Nan jumped up and opened the doors wide. Then she
drew the sofa a little nearer to them and lay down upon it, propping herself up
with cushions and facing into the room. She found a rug and drew it over her
feet. Behind her lay the garden, drenched with rain and dazzling now with
pearls of light as the strong sun shone upon it, and the plants gradually
lifted themselves up, murmuring as they did so. The fresh air blew into the
room, dissipating, so Nan hoped, the remaining smell of the whiskey. Bill
entered by the drawing-room door.


\x{2018}Sit down, Bill,\x{2019} said Nan. She indicated a chair near the door.


Bill did not sit down, but stood by the wall kicking his feet. He looked very
like Donald.


\x{2018}Let me explain,\x{2019} began Bill, \x{2018}about last night. Miss Carter stayed here all
night because of the storm, and because she\x{2019}d made an excuse to Demoyte and
couldn\x{2019}t go back there. It was the first time she was in this house. I\x{2019}d only
seen her alone twice before that - or three times, if you count the first
night. And I\x{2019}ve never made love to her.\x{2019} He hated saying these things. He
stood, pawing with his foot and looking down.


Nan believed him. \x{2018}All right, Bill,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}You are obviously what they
call a fast worker. How little I knew you! Anyhow, I\x{2019}m not interested in this
sentimental catalogue. You talk as if you were confessing the secrets of your
heart to someone who wanted to hear them.\x{2019}


At this moment Nan realized with dismay that she was developing hiccups. The
only hope was to check them at once by holding her breath. She breathed in very
deeply.


Bill waited for her to go on, and as she continued to be silent he said after a
moment or two, \x{2018}I should not like you to think that I regard this as anything
trivial.\x{2019}


Nan was still holding her breath.


After another moment of waiting Bill began to say, \x{2018}I realize that I have acted
-\x{2019}


Nan gasped and drew in another breath. It felt as if she had defeated the
hiccups. She interrupted him. \x{2018}Listen, Bill,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m not going to make
a scene about this. I believe all you say. I\x{2019}ve trusted you all my life, and I
trust you now not to act in a way that will make us both ludicrous.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You don\x{2019}t quite understand -\x{2019} said Bill. He was leaning back against the wall
and looking with a frown at a particular place in the carpet as if he were
trying to decipher the pattern. He beat the wall lightly as he spoke with the
heel of Nan\x{2019}s shoe.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t do that,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}You\x{2019}re making marks on the wallpaper. I think I do
understand. You\x{2019}ve got yourself into a sentimental state about this girl. All
right. There\x{2019}s nothing very terrible about that. But whatever there is to it,
now you must just stop. Your own good sense must tell you what to do here and
how to do it.\x{2019} Nan found to her surprise that the words were not new after all.
The pattern of her former conversations with her husband was not lost. This
thing could be dealt with as she had dealt with all crises in the past. She
felt with a sense of relief her protective power over him. The nightmare was at
an end.


I can\x{2019}t stop,\x{2018} said Bill in a dull voice, still looking at the carpet.


\x{2018}None of that, please,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}You made this mess and you must get out of
it. Be rational, Bill! Wake up and see the real world again. Even if you have
no consideration for me or for that wretched girl who\x{2019}s scarcely older than Felicity,
think a little about your reputation, your position as a schoolmaster. Think
about the precious Labour Party. This flirtation is bound to end pretty soon.
If you let it drag on you\x{2019}ll merely do yourself a lot of harm.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I love this girl, Nan,\x{2019} said Bill. He tried to look at her, but could not face
her stare.


\x{2018}If you only knew,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}how pathetic you are! Just see yourself, Bill,
for a moment. Just look at yourself in a mirror. Do you seriously imagine that
you could make anything out of a love affair with an attractive, flighty little
gipsy with a French upbringing who might be your daughter? Don\x{2019}t make yourself
more ridiculous than you already are! If the silly child seems attached to you
at the moment, and isn\x{2019}t just being kind so as not to hurt your feelings, it\x{2019}s
probably because she\x{2019}s just lost her father.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ve thought of that too,\x{2019} said Bill.


\x{2018}Well, I\x{2019}m glad you see the point,\x{2019} said Nan. She hiccuped violently and
disguised it as a cough. \x{2018}Now you get yourself sorted out and stop seeing this
girl - and we\x{2019}ll say no more about it. You know I don\x{2019}t want to make a fuss.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I can\x{2019}t stop seeing her,\x{2019} said Bill. He was still leaning against the wall
with a sort of exhausted lassitude.


\x{2018}Oh, don\x{2019}t be so unutterably spineless and dreary!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}You know
perfectly well you\x{2019}ve got no choice.


\x{2018}Nan,\x{2019} said Bill, trying to look up again, \x{2018}how did you find out?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I overheard the children talking on the telephone,\x{2019} said Nan.


Bill jerked himself upright. He said, \x{2018}The children know, do they - Oh,
Christ!\x{2019} He turned to face the wall and leaned his head against it. The shoe
hung limply from his hand behind him.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t use that language, Bill,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s not a very nice thing to
inflict on them, is it? At least the children won\x{2019}t tell anybody. I only hope
the gossip hasn\x{2019}t started already. Does anybody else know about this little
caper?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t think so,\x{2019} said Bill, \x{2018}no one who\x{2019}d talk, that is. I think Demoyte has
probably guessed. And Tim Burke knows.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Tim Burke knows?\x{2019} said Nan. She leaned back among the cushions. A feeling of
extreme tiredness came over her, and with it the nausea was renewed. The
strength which had carried her through the interview faded from her limbs,
leaving them heavy and restless. She knew that the misery was still there,
after all, waiting for her. She wanted to end the conversation.


\x{2018}Oh, go away, Bill,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}You know what you ought to do, just go and do
it.\x{2019}


Bill stood irresolutely at the door. \x{2018}Are you going to stay here now?\x{2019} he said.
\x{2018}Can I get you anything?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No, go away,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Go away into school and don\x{2019}t come back for a long
time. When I\x{2019}ve had a rest I\x{2019}m going back to Dorset.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Going to Dorset?\x{2019}said Bill. He seemed alarmed. \x{2018}Wouldn\x{2019}t it be better if you
stayed here?\x{2019}


\x{2018}To keep an eye on you?\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}No, Bill, I trust you completely. I don\x{2019}t
want to spoil Felicity\x{2019}s holiday. \x{2014} and I don\x{2019}t want to make people talk by
suddenly reappearing here. I leave you to finish this thing off by yourself.


\x{2018}But, Nan \x{2014} \x{2019} Bill began to say.


\x{2018}Oh, get out!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m tired, tired of you. Get out. I\x{2019}ll write to you
from Dorset.\x{2019} She turned over on the sofa, hiding her face in the cushions.


She heard Bill take a few steps across the room as if he were going to come to
her. Then he stopped, turned back, and went out of the door. A minute later she
heard the front door close behind him. Nan waited another minute, and then she
got up, went into the kitchen, and was extremely sick.",

            "FELICITY
began to swim back again towards the shore with long slow strokes. The sea was
dead calm. She swam breast stroke, very steadily, trying to break the surface
as little as possible. The water kissed her chin like oil. The sun warmed her
forehead and dried the drops of moisture from her cheeks. It was a declining
sun, but still triumphantly in possession of the sky. The coast was deserted.
Felicity was in a rocky bay where at low tide there was revealed a great
expanse of rounded boulders heaped at the base of the cliff. At high tide the
water covered them and there was no way. Beyond the headland on either side
were stretches of sand and there the holiday-makers had congregated. But here
there was no one. This was very important just at the moment as Felicity was
about to perform a magic ceremony.


Felicity had realized at an early age that she must be psychic. She had
discovered a witch mark upon her body. This was a very small protuberance a
little below the nipple of her left breast which was not at all like an
ordinary mole. It rather resembled an extra nipple. Felicity knew that witches
were provided with these so that they could be sucked by their familiars; and
although she was not altogether attracted by the idea of furnishing this sort
of hospitality to some being from the other world she was pleased to discover
that she was undoubtedly gifted in this special way and she waited with
interest for further manifestations.


So far nothing very remarkable had happened. Felicity was without information
about the moment at which witches properly came of age. There had been, it was
true, the advent of Angus - but Angus, although he could at times be very
strange and startling to Felicity, manifested himself always, with a sort of
modesty which she realized to be characteristic of him, in some form which
would not shock the sensibility of the other non-psychic people with whom
Felicity was surrounded. Her brother, she had at last to conclude reluctantly,
was not psychic. He had pretended for a long time to be aware of Angus, but it
was now clear to Felicity that it had been only a pretence. He had also taken
part with her in various magic rites - but Felicity had noticed with regret
that Donald\x{2019}s attitude to these ceremonies had been distinctly frivolous.
Donald did not possess the patient and meticulous nature required for a
magician. He would always forget some detail, and then say that it didn\x{2019}t
matter, or start laughing in the middle. In fact, because of Donald\x{2019}s
non-psychic carelessness, the magic rituals had never yet been carried out with
completeness; and lack of completeness in magic is fatal.


Felicity had made a careful study of magic from as many original texts as she
could lay her hands on. She was distressed to find, however, that almost every
magical ceremony that was likely to be any use at all involved the shedding of
blood. Felicity was anxious to fulfil her destiny. On the other hand, the
notion of, for instance, holding an immaculate white cock between her knees,
decapitating it, and drinking the blood from her right hand did not attract her
in the least. Eventually she decided that since she was patently under a taboo
concerning the shedding of blood, she was at liberty to invent her own
ceremonies. This, she felt sure, would be pleasing to Angus, who would be
deeply offended at any shedding of blood, particularly animal blood. Angus was
very fond of animals. Whether Angus would have liked a human sacrifice Felicity
for practical reasons did not specially consider. She had therefore begun to
compose her own rites \x{2014} and on one New Year\x{2019}s Eve had written, under
inspiration, a small compendium of various rituals some of which she had vainly
attempted with Donald\x{2019}s assistance to perform.


Now for the first time Felicity intended to carry out one of these rituals by
herself and to carry it out in its entirety. She had decided to wait, before
putting her plan into operation, for a manifestation of Angus. Angus had been
some time in turning up. That morning, however, she had seen him. He had taken
the form of a man on stilts, with very long blue and white check trousers and a
top hat. She had met him quite suddenly round the comer of a lane. He was
making his way towards a fair which was being held in some fields half a mile
farther on. He said nothing, but raised his hat solemnly to Felicity. It was
quite early and no one else was about. The sudden appearance of this very tall
figure startled Felicity very much for a moment. But then she guessed its
identity and immediately ran home to start making her preparations.


This was one of the direst of the rites and also one of the more complicated
ones. The paraphernalia had all been col lected beforehand and now lay spread
out on top of a large flat rock which was just at the water\x{2019}s edge. For this
particular ceremony it was necessary to choose a place beside water and a time
when the sun and the moon were both in the sky at once. Fortunately the moon
was rising early and its appearance coincided roughly with low tide. All this
Felicity took as a good omen. It was <<nearly eight o\x{2018}clock|6>> and there was still a
strong light from the sun which was now low down over the headland. The moon
was large and pallid, the colour and consistency of cream cheese, risen just
above the sea. Felicity climbed out on to the rock, keeping her dripping body
well away from the magical apparatus. Her swim had not been recreational. It
formed part of the rite. A purificatory wash was essential; also the wearing of
a seamless and sleeveless garment. Felicity\x{2019}s bathing-costume did duty as the
latter. She dried herself thoroughly with a new and hitherto unused towel which
she had bought that morning.


When she was dry and warm she began to prepare the scene. The water lapped just
below the rock, extremely still. It was the dead moment of low tide. Upon the
top of the rock Felicity drew a large circle of sand, and within the circle she
drew a triangle of salt. In the arcs of the circle which lay outside the area
of the triangle she laid small heaps of poppies and dog roses. At the peak of
the triangle, which pointed out to sea, she laid her electric torch which had
been bound round with St John\x{2019}s wort. This faced towards the centre of the
triangle and was to be illuminated when the ceremony started. In the right-hand
apex of the triangle stood a copper cup containing white wine, a new penknife,
also purchased that day, some camphor and aloes in a packet, a large bottle of
lighter-fuel, a live beetle in a matchbox, the supersonic whistle which
Felicity had taken from her brother, and a pack of Tarot cards. In the centre
of the triangle stood a tripod under which lay some laurel twigs mingled with
wood shavings. Perched in the tripod was a handle-less aluminium saucepan
containing milk and olive oil. In the left-hand apex of the triangle lay an
image of a human figure about eight inches high which had been made out of Miss
Carter\x{2019}s nylon stockings stuffed with paper. Beside the image lay a fork made
of a single hazel twig, since the image must not be touched by hand during the
ceremony. There was also a box of matches which Felicity had stuck into the
bosom of her bathing-costume.


Now everything was ready. Felicity began to feel nervous and a bit frightened.
She looked up and down the coast. There was no one in sight. Only the randomly
piled up boulders, shapeless and brown, stretched away in both directions. She
looked out to sea. The declining sun was striking its last beams upon the sea.
The moon was higher and smaller and less pale. Out of the hazy light a black
shape came slowly and steadily towards her, moving very close above the surface
of the water. It was a cormorant. It came straight in towards the coast and
perched upon a rock a short distance away. Felicity switched on the electric
torch. The light shining through a wreath of leaves illumined the uneven
surface of the rock.


Felicity opened the ceremony with two silent invocations. The first was the
invocation of the Spirit who was to be bound by the rites to perform for her
what she desired. This Spirit was not Angus, but a greater than Angus to whom
Felicity had not given a name and towards whom she rarely allowed her thoughts
to turn. The invocation was wordless. Felicity had written down various spells
for use on such occasions, but they had all sounded so silly that she had
decided to abandon the vulgar medium of words. She had also decided that it was
neither necessary nor desirable to specify exactly what it was that she wanted
done. The general nature of the ceremony made that clear enough and the details
could safely be left to the Spirit. The second invocation, also wordless, was
one which Felicity appended to all her magical activities. It was to the effect
that whatever else the Spirit, or spirits, should decide to do as a result of
her rites, they should not reveal the future. Felicity had a horror of knowing
the future. She feared very much that this might turn out to be one of the penalties
of being psychic, and she was uneasily aware that unless they are carefully
controlled spirits have a tendency to blurt out things to come.


After that, Felicity took the new penknife and made a small incision in her
arm. This was for use later, but she felt, guided here she was sure by Angus,
that it was advisable to make the incision before she used the knife for
various other purposes. She then cut up the laurel twigs and set light to them.
This was not enormously successful. The wooden shavings burnt quite merrily,
but the laurels, which were rather green, merely became black at the edges.
After several attempts they began to burn a little and the milk and oil in the
saucepan became warm. Felicity threw on to the fire first the camphor and then
the aloes. The flames began to burn yellow and green and a strange pungent
smell arose from under the tripod. After some of the laurel had at last got
burnt Felicity allowed the fire to die down and very carefully scraped up some
of the ash which she was sure was laurel ash and dropped it into the copper cup
of white wine. She stirred it and then lifted it to her lips. It tasted far
from pleasant. Felicity took a sip or two and put it down. No more was demanded
by the ritual, and she feared to poison herself. She then took the Tarot pack
in her hand.


This was a crucial moment, since if the draw from the pack was contrary, or
non-significant, the ceremony could not go on. Felicity knew from experience
that she was able to interpret almost any draw in a way favourable to her
designs. This was one of her psychic gifts. She was nervous all the same about
what the pack might tell her. In relation to the Tarot Felicity had developed
her own private symbolism. She had identified various figures in the pack with
people that she knew, the more important people in her world appearing usually
in two roles. Her father was the Emperor, and also the King of Swords. Her
mother was the Empress and the Queen of Swords. Donald was the Juggler and also
the Fool. She herself was the Queen of Cups. The mystic figure of the Pope
represented the unknown person who was to appear one day to transform her life.
The figure of the Papessa or High Priestess was her own transfigured
personality, still distant from her and covered by a veil. For the purposes of
the present ceremony Miss Carter was represented by the Moon Card and the Queen
of Pentacles.


Felicity held in her hand only the cards of the Major Arcana and the court
cards of the four suits. This reduced the chances of a meaningless draw. She
cut the pack and then drew out five cards which she laid face downwards upon
the rock. She paused solemnly, breathless. Then she began to turn the cards
over one by one. She looked - and could scarcely believe her eyes. From left to
right the cards she had drawn were these: the Empress, the King of Swords, the
Broken Tower, the Hanged Man, and the Moon. This was extremely easy to
interpret and very favourable to her ceremony. The centre card was always
crucial. Here, Felicity took the Tower struck by lightning to symbolize the
magical rite itself which was to divide her father from Miss Carter. Her
father\x{2019}s card and Miss Carter\x{2019}s card were placed on different sides of the
Tower. Her father appeared in his material guise as King of Swords, not in his
spiritual guise as Emperor. The two women appeared in their spiritual guises.
But her mother was placed next to her father, while Miss Carter was at the far
end next to the Hanged Man. Felicity was not able to interpret the Hanged Man -
but she decided that he didn\x{2019}t matter. The omen was in any case extremely
favourable.


She proceeded with the ceremony. The next act was to blow a long blast upon the
supersonic whistle. This was the summons to the Spirit. The whistle was
disconcertingly sonic at first, but as Felicity blew harder the note arose high
and higher and disappeared. She looked round to see if she had frightened the
cormorant. He was still there. She then very carefully took the matchbox which
contained the beetle. He was a shiny black beetle, vigorous and healthy. She
moved to the end of the triangle where the lamp lay, its light seeming brighter
now that the sun had disappeared behind the headland, and she upended the box
upon the rock. She then turned the beetle so that his head was towards the
centre of the triangle and let him go. He started to walk. He was to determine
the exact place where the rite was to reach its consummation. As if he knew
what was required of him the beetle ambled along the rock and then stopped in a
small depression not far from the image. Immediately Felicity began to squeeze
her arm. A little blood emerged from the cut which she had made with the
penknife. She mingled this upon her finger tip with a little of the milky brew
and put a drop of it on the rock in front of the beetle. As he showed no
interest in the offering Felicity very gently pushed his nose into it and put
him carefully back into the matchbox. Then upon the place where the blood and
milk were smeared she placed the warm saucepan of milk and oil.


Seizing the bottle of lighter-fuel, she poured a good quantity of it into the
saucepan and then tried to set light to the contents. It refused to light. The
match just went down sizzling into the greyish mixture. Felicity was frantic.
The whole thing was going to go wrong at the last moment. She tried match after
match. She was nearly in tears. Whatever happened, she must not ignite the
image directly. At last she picked up one of the blackened laurel leaves and
floated it in the saucepan. At the same time she picked up the image with the
hazelrod fork. She applied a final match to the laurel. There was a quick
flare, during which Felicity brought the image forward and held it full in the
leaping flame. The flame died down at once; but the image had caught. Felicity
had taken the precaution beforehand of soaking it thoroughly in lighter-fuel.


The image was burning fast. Felicity stepped quickly round the circle, keeping
her feet inside the triangle, picking up the poppies and the wild roses which
she then threw into the sea. The tide was coming in. Already the water was
gurgling to and fro on three sides of the rock. The sun was almost hidden now
and the outline of the land was purple and heavy. The moon was beginning to
shine. It had become very small, a button of bright silver in a patch of
greenish sky. It shone balefully down on Felicity. She stood, her eyes starting
from her head, watching the image burn. A chill breeze blew from the sea,
fanning the flames.


 



Nan was standing with her feet in the water. At low tide a layer of small
pebbles was uncovered which lay beyond the sand. When they were wet they were
multi-coloured and beautiful, but when they dried they all became grey. They
hurt her feet a little, but she walked along, the very still water caressing
her ankles. It came to the shore with scarcely a ripple. The tide must be on
the turn. She looked out to sea. The sun was going down and covering its
expanse with a spacious and tender light. The moon had just risen, with a big
pale melancholy pock-marked face. There were not many people left on the beach
now. She had hoped to find Felicity there, but there was no sign of the child.
She seemed to be avoiding her.


Since her return to Dorset Nan had passed in her thoughts through a number of
different phases. She had never reflected so much in her life. Her normal
existence had not demanded, had even excluded, reflection. It had contained her
firmly like a shell with every cranny filled. There had been problems, of
course, and moments of decision, but Nan did not remember having felt any doubt
ever upon an issue of importance. She had always understood, she had always
known what to do \x{2014} and when it came to persuading her husband to share her
opinion,, the pattern of argument had been reassuringly familiar, as if it were
continually the same discussion.


Now the pressure of reality upon her had been withdrawn, and she was left alone
in the centre of a void where she had suddenly to determine afresh the form and
direction of her being. It was only within the last two days, however, that Nan
had really become aware of this aloofness of the world. She had come back from
Surrey in a state of mind far from cheerful, but at least energetic and
confident. She had occupied herself upon the journey with intermittent thoughts
of Tim Burke. She had been deeply hurt to learn from Bill that Tim had known
all about it - was perhaps even an accomplice as well as a confidant.
Reflecting on this, Nan had a feeling in which she rarely indulged. She felt
sorry for herself. Only once in all these years, years which had often been
discouraging and dreary enough, had she stretched out her hand a little way
towards another person - and she had been betrayed. She was sad, too, because
she knew that with this a sort of fragrance, a streak of colour, was gone from
her life. The thought that, although nothing passed between them, Tim Burke
still cherished her in his heart had been, but now would be no longer, a
refreshment to her. Later, however, Nan began to feel less extreme, more ready
to forgive Tim for his knowledge, and less anxious to interpret it as a
betrayal. It was then that she allowed the memory of how they had lain together
in the armchair to come back fully to her consciousness. She remembered the
scene in detail, and everything that Tim had said. She dwelt upon it. Already
it was like remembering the remote past, something tender and sad and utterly
cut off. Perhaps after all it was best for Tim to play his old part and for
everything to be as before. Everything must be as before. The thought that it
must and would be so was reassuring. She realized soberly how much she would
have missed him.


Her thoughts reverted to Bill. The sense of relief which Nan had felt during
her interview with Bill, when she found herself once more in control of the
situation, did not leave her for several days. During that time, when she
thought of the interview, she filled in the details of her own powerful and
vigorous attack. What Bill\x{2019}s replies had been she could scarcely remember. She
felt complete confidence that her instructions would be carried out. How
exactly they would be carried out she did not care to know. But she would come
back to Bill to find that it had been done - and then she would endeavour to
carry out her promise of not referring to the matter again. She was pleased
that she had maintained throughout a civilized and rational demeanour.
Fundamentally, Nan grasped the situation at this time as a drama, and one which
she was able to fashion to her own pattern. She felt the satisfaction of one
who is in the right, able to impose his will, and doing so mercifully.


Almost at once, however, certain other and quite irrational feelings came to
plague her. She was not able to forget what she had seen when she came in
through the drawing-room door. Gradually the notion that Bill had actually
embraced and kissed this girl, certainly more than once, became a reality to
Nan. From there it was only a little way to the notion that possibly Bill was
still embracing and kissing her. Nan did not make the transition immediately.
She had never experienced jealous feelings before - she knew that they were the
sort of feelings which it is neurotic and irrational to indulge. So she put
them away. But they would not be put away.


Nan began to have bad dreams. This was new to her as well. Usually she was not
aware of having dreamed at all. Now the figure of her husband haunted her
continually throughout the night. She did not dream of the girl. Nan began to
think about her husband. In those few days she thought about him more intensely
than she had ever done since she had first been in love with him. His face
haunted her. One vision of it especially she had, seeing it as she had so often
seen it in the early mornings beside her, in the days when they had shared a
bed, when she had woken first, the tired unshaven sleeping face of a man. She
began to miss him. She began, though she did not let this become clear to
herself, almost to desire him.


It was a day later that she began to be afraid. She started to wonder what, at
that very moment, was going on. She began to doubt whether after all her
instructions would be carried out. A letter came from Bill in answer to hers.
It was very vague. It was not at all reassuring. It was the more alarming
because Bill was usually so direct and not fond of ambiguities. Then she began
to wake in the night and speculate about what Bill was doing. She began to
rehearse detailed and catastrophic fantasies. She wished then very much that
she had not come back to Dorset - but she could not yet make up her mind to
return to Surrey. She began to remember what Bill had said during their
interview. Now it was her own words which appeared in memory hazy and
unimportant, while Bill\x{2019}s words were filled in sharply. It came to her as a
real possibility that she might lose her husband.


During these days Nan spoke to no one except Felicity, and she spoke to
Felicity only of ordinary things. Felicity avoided her in any case, leaving the
house immediately after every meal and disappearing along the coast or into the
country. Nan had no wish to speak frankly with her daughter. But she wanted
more and more to have the girl\x{2019}s company, as it became less and less agreeable
to be alone. She had come to look for her now along the beach, but without success.
The sandy bay was almost deserted. The setting sun and the cool wind had sent
hurrying home the few families that still lingered there. Nan\x{2019}s feet were
chilled. She dried them on her handkerchief and put her shoes on.


Her wandering had brought her close to the headland beyond which the coast
became jagged and rocky. In that desolate bay of rocks she knew that Felicity
liked often to sit alone. She thought that she would look round the headland
before she went back to the villa. She did not want to go back just yet to the
empty villa. She started to walk along the shingle. Already the rocks were
beginning. It was hard to climb upon them with high-heeled shoes. These loose
rocks appalled Nan. Round, random, detachable, they were strewn at the foot of
the cliff and the sea moved them a little every time it came in to cover them.
They were terrible and without sense. As Nan stood balanced, about to step from
one boulder to the next, she heard a thin piercing wail, which grew higher and
higher and then died away. It was not like the cry of a bird. She stood still a
moment, shivered, and then went on, awkwardly stepping from one smooth tilting
surface on to the next one. It was a little while before she had got
sufficiently round the headland to be able to see into the next bay. Near to
her a great black thing suddenly rose and went slowly away, out towards the
horizon, black in the final brilliance of the sun. It frightened Nan for a
moment. But it was only a cormorant.


The sky was a rich darkening blue at the zenith, but the golden light, still
lying in sheets upon the water, dazzled Nan for a moment. As she paused it was
already fading. Then as her eyes became more accustomed to the scene she saw a
strange flame leaping upon a rock not far away. A figure was standing upright
upon the rock, which was now surrounded by the incoming tide. It was Felicity.
Nan called out, and began to hurry across the rocks, stepping as quickly as she
could towards her daughter. As soon as Felicity saw her mother coming she began
in desperate haste to pick up a lot of things which were lying about on top of
the rock. Then she began to sweep the rock with her hand, sweeping everything
that remained upon it off into the sea. The little fire which had been burning
on the rock was swept off too, and lay upon the surface of the water, where
amid a wide scattering of leaves and flowers which were already floating there
it continued to burn.


Amazed, Nan arrived close to the rock, and stood there looking out at Felicity.
In spite of the chill of the evening Felicity was dressed only in a
bathing-costume. A number of odd tins and bottles stood upon the rock. It
looked as if she had been having a picnic. But it must have been a strange
picnic. The flare continued upon the surface of the water and the incoming tide
carried it almost to Nan\x{2019}s feet where it burnt uncannily. Felicity now stood
paralysed, staring down at the flames.


\x{2018}Darling,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}have you gone quite mad? You\x{2019}ll catch your death of cold
standing there with nothing on. There\x{2019}s quite a cold wind now that the sun\x{2019}s
gone down. And if you don\x{2019}t hurry you\x{2019}ll be stranded on that rock. Where are
your clothes?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Here,\x{2019} said Felicity dully. She produced them from a shelf on the other side
of the rock.


\x{2018}Throw them across to me,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}and you\x{2019}d better pass me those other
things as well, whatever they are, and then come across yourself at once. I
think as it is you\x{2019}ll have to wade.\x{2019}


A wide channel now flowed between Felicity\x{2019}s rock and the mainland. Afloat upon
it the flame was still alight.


\x{2018}Whatever were you burning?\x{2019} said Nan. It smells very funny, and it\x{2019}s odd the
way it hasn\x{2019}t gone out.\x{2018}


The flame rose from the glassy surface of the gently flowing tide and was
reflected in it. The sun was down now and the air was denser with the twilight.
Then quite suddenly the fire was out, and there was nothing but a little
blackened lump, floating near to the edge of the rock.


Fascinated Nan leaned down and was about to pick it out of the water.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t touch it!\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}Here, catch!\x{2019} She bundled her clothes up into
the towel and threw them. Nan stepped back hurriedly and caught them. Then in a
fever of haste Felicity began to pack all the remaining objects into a bag. She
took it in her hand and gently tossed it across the channel. It landed neatly
upon a rock. Then Felicity jumped down into the sea. She gasped at its
coldness. She began to wade across to where Nan was standing. On the way she
beat with her hands at the charred black thing which still floated there. It
disintegrated completely.


Nan had the towel ready for her. She began to rub her down vigorously as she
had so often done when she was a small child.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t, you\x{2019}re hurting me!\x{2019} said Felicity. Then, with snuffling sobs, she began
to cry.


\x{2018}Dear me, dear me!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}What a cry baby! You\x{2019}re always wailing. Now then
put your vest on quick - and tell me what\x{2019}s the matter.\x{2019}


Felicity was trembling with cold. She got her vest on and began to fumble with
her dress. She said, \x{2018}I saw a butterfly flying out to sea. It will get lost out
there and die.\x{2019} She pulled the dress on over her head. Her tears were still
falling.


\x{2018}What nonsense, child!\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}It could fly back again, couldn\x{2019}t it?
Anyway, they can fly for miles, they often fly over to France. That\x{2019}s nothing
to cry about.\x{2019}


Felicity sat down. It was quite dark now. The moon shone out of a cloudless sky
of dark blue, revealing on either side of them the tumbled heaps of rock.
Felicity was trying to dry her feet. Nan felt them. They were limp and cold as
ice.


\x{2018}I saw a fish,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}that a man had caught. It was a big fish. It
was lying all by itself on the sand, and struggling and gasping. I wanted to
pick it up and throw it back into the sea. But I wasn\x{2019}t brave enough to.\x{2019} Her
voice broke in renewed sobs.


Nan bent forward, chafing one white foot between her hands. She felt the tears
rising. She could not control them any more. She took a deep breath and her
weeping began. Sitting there, her hand still clasped about her daughter\x{2019}s foot,
she wept without restraint. The moon shone brightly down upon them both.",

Fifteen



DURING those days Mor learnt what it was to have a mind diseased. There was no
longer any point at which his thoughts could find rest. They fled tortured from
place to place. Only by absorbing himself in the routine duties of the school
was he able to find, not peace, but the means simply of continuing to exist. He
felt as if he were under an intolerable physical strain, as if his body were
likely at any moment to fly to pieces. Other strange physical symptoms came to
trouble him. An unpleasant odour lingered in his nostrils, as if he could
literally smell the sulphur of the pit; and he had from time to time the
curious illusion that his flesh was turning black. He had to look continually
at his hands to be sure that it was not so. Nightmares troubled him, waking and
sleeping \x{2014} and one bad dream conjured up another, running from box to box to
release its fellows. The world around him seemed to have become equally mad and
hateful. The newspapers were full of stories of grotesque violence and
unnatural crimes. He knew neither how to go on nor what to do to bring these
horrors to an end.


Part of his torment was the knowledge that Rain was tormented equally. She had
stopped painting, and had told Mr Everard that the picture was finished. The
date for the appalling presentation dinner had even been fixed. Her decision
distressed Mor, not because he imagined that it mattered now whether the
official date of her departure was late or early, but because he felt
responsible for having ruined the picture. Although he did not think that in
the long run he either would or could do harm to her art, he could not forget
what Bledyard had said. Rain had intended to improve the picture, to paint the
head over again. She had not done so, because he had reduced her to the same
frenzy that he was in himself.


Mor was standing in Waterloo station. He was waiting for Rain to arrive by
train. He had had some school business in London, and they had agreed that she
should meet him after lunch when it was done and they should spend the rest of
the day in town. Mor noted, desperately, that to be together was not now quite
enough of a salve for their unhappiness - they had to have novelties and
distractions. He thought, this is what it is to be one of the damned.


There was still fifteen minutes to wait before the train arrived. Music began
to play through a loud-speaker. Mor looked at the people hurrying to and fro in
the wide echoing hall between the booking-offices and the platforms. The music
drew the scene together until it had the look of an insane ballet, eerie,
desolate, and sinister. The performers glided to and fro across the stage,
weaving in and out with an inscrutable precision. Mor turned his head away. He
bought a paper and opened it quickly. Dreadful headlines stared him in the
face. Bridegroom Kills Bride in Car Crash. Possible Contamination of Earth\x{2019}s
Atmosphere: Scientists\x{2019} Grave Warning. Mor crumpled the newspaper up and
threw it into a wastepaper basket. He sat down on a seat and lighted a
cigarette. He would have liked a drink, only it was the middle of the
afternoon. He had taken to drinking quite a lot lately.


His thoughts began again upon the old round. Had he misled Rain totally
concerning the nature of his marriage? Did Rain really love him anyway? Would
her attachment to him endure? Supposing he were to destroy everything in order
to be with her, would it turn out in the end to be a disaster? Was he not
simply criminal to contemplate a union with so young a girl? Perhaps he was no
more to her than an ephemeral father figure, endowed by the pain of her recent
bereavement with a size larger than life? All this he had discussed with Rain
herself in considerable detail for hours and hours and hours, without coming to
any satisfactory conclusion. These talks went on now so far into every night
that Mor was exhausted, waking tired and headache-ridden, scarcely able to
stagger through the minimum of necessary tasks. She had tried to convince him,
oh she had tried to convince him, at least that she loved him. He knew that she
was convinced herself. At times, the spectacle of this love moved him so much
that it seemed that nothing else mattered. But Mor knew now, and it was both a
torment and a consolation, that in this damned condition no state of mind
lasted for very long. Certainty and uncertainty chased each other through him
at intervals, and it seemed that it would be a matter of chance in which phase
exactly he should decide irrevocably to act.


One decision at least had been definitely put off. Rain had not yet become his
mistress. She herself had wished to. But Mor had decided that it was better to
wait a little while until the situation had become clearer. Time passed, the
situation did not become clearer, and Mor began to conjecture that just this
delay might be his fatal error. But it was some lingering puritanism out of his
rejected childhood which still made him hesitate to become in the final and
technical sense unfaithful to his wife. He knew that, in almost every way that
mattered, his unfaithfulness was now complete. He had written to Nan hinting as
much - but he had not dared to speak clearly to her, for he feared that she
might return while he was still in a state of indecision. He saw that he had
now definitely and irrevocably parted company with the truth. In the country
where he lived now, truth could not decide his choices. Neither could
happiness. He had told Bledyard that this would guide him - but now even this
light was gone. He no longer conceived, as measurable entities capable of being
weighed against each other, his own happiness, Rain\x{2019}s, or Nan\x{2019}s. He scarcely
conceived that he could ever be happy again - nor did this especially matter.


What remained real and composed his agony was his intense, and it seemed to him
increasing, love for Rain; combined with doubts about whether it was not wrong
to thrust this love upon her, and complete paralysis at the thought of having
to announce to Nan and the children that he was going to leave them. If only
his love for Rain could drive him a little madder, or, on the other hand, his
sense of belonging to his previous life become a little stronger, he would be
able to decide. As it was, he was perfectly balanced in the midst of all these
forces and quite unable to move. Only from time to time, consoling in itself
and carrying the promise of a possible decision, there came to him a vision of
himself and Rain together, far away from the present agony, beyond it, having
forgotten it, enriching each other by love. This vision, he felt, if he could
only hold it steady in his imagination for long enough, would draw him to a
decision. Yet even this would not be sufficient. He realized, with a spasm of
pain, that in order to come to his beloved he would have to summon up not his
good qualities but his bad ones: his anger, his hatred of Nan, his capacity for
sheer irresponsible violence. Between him and Rain lay this appalling
wilderness; and how changed by it would he be before he could finally reach her?
He must keep his look upon her very steady if he was to go across.


Mor threw away his cigarette. It was nearly time for the train to arrive. He
went to the end of the platform to wait. His longing to see her drove away all
other thoughts. He stood staring down the line. A few minutes passed. Surely
the train was late. Mor began to walk up and down, biting his nails. Perhaps
something terrible had happened, perhaps there had been an accident. He had a
momentary but very detailed vision of Rain lying bleeding in the midst of some
piled and twisted wreck. He looked at his watch again. Oh, let the train come!
Now at last the train was appearing, there it was after all. It slid smoothly
round the curving platform, stopped quickly, and immediately disgorged hundreds
of people. They surged towards the barrier. There was no sign of Rain. Perhaps
she had been taken ill. Perhaps she had decided not to come. Perhaps she had
been offended at something he had said yesterday. Perhaps she had decided to go
away altogether. No, there she was, thank God, so small he hadn\x{2019}t seen her
behind that porter. She had seen him and was waving. She was almost at the
barrier now. She was here.


\x{2018}Oh, Rain \x{2014} \x{2019} said Mor. He enveloped her in a great embrace. He no longer cared
if anyone saw him, he no longer cared about concealment and gossip.


Rain struggled out of his clutches, laughing. She drew him across towards the
exit, looking up at him. \x{2018}You\x{2019}ve been crying, Mor,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}You have a way
of crying inside your eyes which is terrible. I would rather you shed tears.\x{2019}


Mor realized that he had, after his fashion, been crying. \x{2018}Well, you see how
feeble I am!\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}But it\x{2019}s all right now.\x{2019} They came out of the station
and began to walk towards the river.


\x{2018}Where shall we go?\x{2019} said Mor. He had discovered that Rain knew London far
better than he did.


\x{2018}First we cross the bridge,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}and then I take you and show you
something.\x{2019} She was pulling him along, as a child pulls an adult. They came on
to Waterloo Bridge.


The enormous curving expanse of the Thames opened about them girdled with its
pale domes and towers. Above it was a great sky of white bundled clouds. The
day was chill, and there was a promise of rain. The river glittered, thrown up
into small foam-flecked waves that set the anchored barges rocking. Yet above
the tossing water the air was light, and the familiar skyline receded into a
luminous haze. They both paused to look, and Mor felt within him the quick stir
of excitement which came with the first sight of London, always for him, as in
his country childhood, the beautiful and slightly sinister city of
possibilities and promises. The wind blew upon them coldly. They looked
eastward in silence.


Rain shivered. \x{2018}You know,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}in this place it\x{2019}s autumn already. I
thought the leaves fell in September. But here they begin to fall in July. I
don\x{2019}t think I could live in England all the year.\x{2019}


Mor shivered too, but not at the wind. He was reminded yet again that Rain was
free. Also, he had not been able to keep it out of his consciousness, she was
wealthy. She could wonder to herself whether she would spend the winter in
England, or go back to the Mediterranean, to Majorca perhaps, or Marrakcsh. At
this thought Mor felt a mixture of attraction and revulsion.


Rain read his thoughts. She did not want him to know that she had read them.
She wanted somehow to make it clear that she did not envisage any going away
that did not include him. She said, \x{2018}I wonder if we shall work together one
day, I at my painting and you at your books -\x{2019}


Mor had told Rain about the half-finished work in political concepts. He had
still not said anything to her about the possible candidature. This was all the
less necessary since he had almost finally decided now that he would not stand.
Whatever happened, probably, he would not stand. He could not bring himself
even to think about the Labour Party at the moment. Compared with his present
preoccupations, everything to do with the Labour Party paled into triviality.
He was surprised to find how little he cared. He must settle the more pressing
problem first \x{2014} and other problems could just look after themselves.


\x{2018}You would always be working hard,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but I don\x{2019}t know how I would
make out in a state of\x{2019} \x{2014} he searched for the word - \x{2018}freedom.\x{2019} He pictured
himself for a moment living in a hotel in Majorca on Rain\x{2019}s money. He did not
find the picture nauseating, merely ludicrous. Of course, there would be
nothing like that. When the scandal was over, he would start a school of his
own. They had envisaged this and even discussed it. Mor tried to fasten his
thoughts upon a possible future. It was not easy. Instead, he kept seeing in
his mind\x{2019}s eye the face of his son. He remembered with a jolt that it was less
than ten days to Donald\x{2019}s chemistry exam.


They reached the other side of the bridge. It was beginning to rain.


\x{2018}We go the rest of the way by taxi,\x{2019} Rain announced. She seemed unusually
cheerful today. The storms of doubt and guilt seemed to have passed over for
the moment. Mor thought, if only she were, even for a short while, absolutely
certain, I could make my decision; and this thought seemed to bring it nearer.
He hailed a taxi, and once inside he held the girl violently in his arms and
forgot everything else.


The taxi stopped, at Rain\x{2019}s request, just off Bond Street, and they got out.
Mor looked round vaguely. Rain\x{2019}s presence made him live so completely from
moment to moment that he had not even wondered where they were going. Then he
saw a poster beside a door near by. It read: FATHER AND DAUGHTER. An
Exhibition of Works by SIDNEY and RAIN CARTER.


Rain watched him, delighted at his surprise, and began to lead him in. Mor felt
considerable emotion. Except for the portrait of Demoyte, he had seen no
paintings by Rain, or her father, in original or reproduction. He felt both
excited and nervous. He began to think at once that he might hate the
exhibition. They climbed the stairs.


Rain\x{2019}s appearance created a mild sensation in the room above. She was known to
the girl who sold the catalogues and to two art dealers and the owner of the
gallery, who were chatting in the middle of the room. One or two other people,
who were looking at the pictures, turned to watch. Mor felt himself for the
first time in Rain\x{2019}s world. He felt intimidated. She introduced him without
embarrassment as a friend of Demoyte\x{2019}s. The art dealers knew about the Demoyte
portrait, inquired after it, and said that they would make a point of going
down to St Bride\x{2019}s in the autumn to see it. The notion that connoisseurs would
now be making pilgrimages to St Bride\x{2019}s was strange to Mor. In any ordinary
state of mind it would have pleased him. But now to speak of the autumn was
like speaking of some time after he would be dead. He listened as a condemned
man might listen to his warders chatting.


Rain seemed in no hurry. She exchanged news and gossip with the three experts.
They spoke a little of her father\x{2019}s work, mentioned the recent sale of one of
his pictures, and the price. The price astonished Mor. He stood aside in
silence, looking at Rain. She seemed now so utterly at her ease, quite unlike
the weeping ragamuffin he had seen two nights ago when they had talked for
hours about their situation. She could step out of that into this.
He marvelled again that she had not gone away altogether. She was dressed today
in a dress which he had not seen before, a clinging dress of light grey wool,
which made her look taller. As she talked, he watched her bright thrown-back
boy\x{2019}s face, and the extreme roundness of her breasts, displayed now by the
close-fitting wool. He noticed that she was wearing high-heeled shoes, instead
of the canvas slippers which she usually wore down at St Bride\x{2019}s. He noticed he
handbag and a long black-polished heel tapping rhythmically. He coveted her,
and his need for her was suddenly so extreme that he had to turn away.


He wondered for the hundredth time what it was that he wanted from her. It was
not just to be the owner of that small and exotic being. He wanted to be the
new person that she made of him, the free and creative and joyful and loving
person that she had conjured up, striking this miraculous thing out of his
dullness. He recalled Bledyard\x{2019}s words: you think of nothing else but your own
satisfaction. All right, if two people can satisfy each other, and make each
other new, why not? After all, he thought, I can be guided by this. Let me only
make clear what I gain, and what I destroy. With relief he felt his mood
shifting. The cloud of nightmare which had hung over his head while he was
waiting at Waterloo was lifted. In a world without a redeemer only clarity was
the answer to guilt. He would make it all clear to himself, shirking nothing,
and then he would decide.


Rain had finished with the connoisseurs. They said good-day, and all departed
together. She turned to Mor. \x{2018}You haven\x{2019}t been looking!\x{2019}


\x{2018}I have,\x{2019} said Mor, smiling. \x{2018}Now you show me the pictures.\x{2019}


They began to walk round. Mor was not used to looking at pictures, and these
ones startled him. They were very various. Some were meticulous and decorative,
like the portrait of Demoyte, others very much more impressionistic, with the
paint plastered heavily upon the canvas. After making one or two wrong guesses,
Mor gave up pretending to know which were Rain\x{2019}s and which were her father\x{2019}s.
There seemed to be no way of deciding on grounds of style.


\x{2018}How do the experts know?\x{2019} he asked Rain.


\x{2018}My father\x{2019}s pictures are better!\x{2019} she replied.


The pictures all showed a great intensity, even violence, of colour, and a bold
harsh disposition of forms. Everything was very large and seemed to have more
colours and more surfaces than nature possessed. Compared to these works, the
portrait of Demoyte seemed more harmonious and sombre.


When Mor said this, Rain said, \x{2018}I am only just beginning to develop my own style.
My father was such a powerful painter, and such a strong personality, I was
practically made in his image. It will be a long time before I know what I have
in myself.\x{2019}


Mor thought, even at this moment she knows that there is a future. He wished
that she could communicate this sense of futurity to him. He said, \x{2018}Is there a
picture of your father here?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Several,\x{2019} said Rain. She stopped him in front of a portrait.


Mor saw at first the jagged mountains and valleys of the paint, and then he saw
a thin-faced man, looking suspiciously sideways towards the spectator, his face
turning the other way, a thin wig-like crop of straight black hair, grey at the
temples, big rather moist eyes with many wrinkles about them, and a slightly
pursed thoughtful mouth.


\x{2018}Did you paint that?\x{2019} asked Mor.


\x{2018}No, my father did,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}a little while before he died. It\x{2019}s a very
good painting. See the authority of that head. Mr Bledyard would not have
criticized that.\x{2019}


Mor felt unable to make any judgement on the painting. He had a dream-like
sensation of being translated into Rain\x{2019}s world, as if she had laid him under a
spell in order to show him the past. How objective she is, all the same, he
thought. They moved on.


There was a portrait of a young girl with long black plaits, leaning over the
keyboard of a piano. Out of a haze of colour her presence emerged with great
vividness, bathed in the light and atmosphere of a southern room.


\x{2018}Who is that?\x{2019} said Mor, although he already knew.


\x{2018}Me,\x{2019} said Rain.


\x{2018}Did your father paint it?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No, I did.\x{2019}


\x{2018}But you were a child then!\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Not so young as I look,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}I was nineteen. It\x{2019}s not very good, I\x{2019}m
afraid.\x{2019}


To Mor it looked marvellous. \x{2018}And you had long hair!\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}When did you
cut it?\x{2019}


\x{2018}After \x{2014} In Paris, when I was studying there.\x{2019}


They moved on quickly to the next picture. Rain\x{2019}s father stood in a doorway,
leaning against the jamb of the door. He was dressed in a loose-fitting white
suit, and his face was in shadow. Beyond him through the door could be seen a
dazzling expanse of sea.


\x{2018}I painted that too,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}That\x{2019}s a more recent one, not quite so awful.
That\x{2019}s through the door of our house.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Your house!\x{2019} said Mor. He must have supposed that Rain and her father lived in
a house - but somehow his imagination had never tried to provide him with any
details of how she must have lived in the past, before he knew her.


\x{2018}Here\x{2019}s our house again,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}You see more of it here.\x{2019}


Mor saw the fa\x{e7}ade of a white villa, powdery with sun and scored with blue
shadows, with pinkish patches on the walls where the plaster was falling off,
and decrepit grey shutters disposed in various positions. A ragged cypress tree
partly obscured one of the windows.


\x{2018}Where is the sea?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Here,\x{2019} she said, indicating a point beyond the foreground of the picture.


\x{2018}Which was your room?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}You can\x{2019}t see it here,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}That was my father\x{2019}s room. Mine looked out
at the back. You can see the window here.\x{2019} She pointed to another picture. It
was evening, and the back of the house was glowing in a soft diffused light. A
wilderness of flowering shrubs, with grotesque shapes and violent purple
shadows, crawled right up to the wall.


\x{2018}There\x{2019}s no path!\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}No, you have to push your way through.\x{2019}


\x{2018}And the view from the window?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Here,\x{2019} she said. It was mid-afternoon, and line behind line a drowsy
landscape, crumbling with dryness, receded into mountain slopes spotted with
vines and mauve distances of dry vegetation and rock.


Who \x{2014} \x{2018} he began.


\x{2018}I painted this one,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}The other ones are by my father. He never
tired of painting the house.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Who has the house now?\x{2019} asked Mor.


She looked surprised. \x{2018}I have it,\x{2019} she said.


They moved from picture to picture. Almost all were either pictures of the
house, or of the landscape near it, or self-portraits, or portraits of each
other, by the father and daughter. There were two or three pictures of Paris,
and about five portraits of other people. Mor looked with bewilderment and a
kind of deeply pleasurable distress upon this vivid southern world, where the
sun scattered the sea at noon-day with jagged and dazzling patches of light, or
drew it upward limpidly light blue into the sky at morning, where the white
house with the patchy plaster walls was stunned and dry at <<noon|13>>, or shimmering
with life in the granulous air of the evening, as it looked one way into the
sea, and the other way across the dusty flowers and into the mountains. He
looked, and he could smell the southern air. And here at last in the room that
he had come to recognize as the drawing-room sat a black-haired girl in a
flowered summer dress. It was <<midday|13>>, but the shutters were drawn against the
sun. The room was full of the very bright and clear but shadowed light of a southern
interior. The girl had tossed back her very short hair and turned towards the
spectator with a smile, one hand poised upon a small table, the other touching
her cheek. The picture had something of the fresh primness of a Victorian
photo. This was a Rain whom Mor recognized, the Rain of today.


\x{2018}One of my father\x{2019}s last pictures,\x{2019} said Rain.


Mor was moved. How he must have treasured her. In this sudden movement of
sympathy towards her father it occurred to him for the first time that his
general attitude to this person was one of hostility.


\x{2018}Who possesses that picture?\x{2019} Mor asked.


\x{2018}The Honourable Mrs Leamington Stephens,\x{2019} said Rain.


Mor frowned. What right had the Honourable Mrs Leamington Stephens to possess
such a picture of Rain? \x{2018}I want it!\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}I will paint one for you, dearest,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}I will paint many, many. I
will paint pictures of you. I will paint you over and over again.\x{2019}


Mor saw the years ahead. The room was full of pictures of himself and Rain.
Himself reading upon the terrace at evening, working in the drawing-room in the
<<noon|13>> light, walking in the wilderness between the dusty leaves of the bushes
where there was no path. Rain, slowly losing her boyish looks, the tense and
precious simplicity of her childhood changing into the serenity of middle age,
and so picture behind picture away into the farthest future. Rain with her
brush in her hand, looking through a thousand canvases towards the end of life.


He said nothing. Rain was looking up at him. He met her eyes without smiling,
yearning for her to decide his fate.


\x{2018}Is there no picture here of your mother?\x{2019} Mor said at last.


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}My father hardly ever painted her.\x{2019}


They moved a pace or two and Mor wondered to himself how much that missing face
would have told him. He wanted to ask a question, but Rain interrupted.


\x{2018}This is rather a curiosity,\x{2019} she said, pointing to a large canvas which hung
at the end of the room. Here both the faces appeared. Rain\x{2019}s father sat behind
a table which was strewn with books and papers, facing the spectator. Upon the
left side of the table, propped up upon it, was a large gilt mirror, in which
could be seen the reflection of Rain and of the canvas which she was painting,
whereon the same picture appeared again, severely foreshortened. Rain\x{2019}s father
was wearing an open-necked shirt. His close-cropped dark hair fell in a silky
fringe along his brow, his narrow brooding face looked intently upward towards
his daughter, and one hand rested upon the frame of the mirror wherein was seen
the reflection of her face, equally intently looking down on him. The heads
were close together and the resemblance between them was marked and touching.


\x{2018}That\x{2019}s extraordinary!\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Not very successful, I\x{2019}m afraid,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}I must try again sometime with
you.\x{2019} She spoke in the most ordinary tone, her attention still upon the
picture.


Mor thought: she has decided. She has decided. He began to want to get
away from the pictures. Without words they turned and went slowly down the
stairs. As his heels bit into the thick carpet Mor felt the pain of the
transition, back to the cold rainy autumnal afternoon and the roaring traffic
outside the door. Here all was the same as before, chilly, noisy, ugly, without
space, without leisure, without peace. He looked sideways at Rain as they came
out of the door. No, she was not quite the same; a new light fell upon her from
the pictures, she was strengthened and made radiant by her past. All the
different faces that he had seen, from the young girl with the plaits to the
posed beauty in the flowering dress dwelt in her face now, giving it suddenly a
new authority and a new age. He thought too how much at this moment she
resembled her father, except that what in him appeared as a sort of
self-contained moroseness appeared in her as a pedantic and dignified serenity,
which combined with her rounded head and fresh face of a child was absurd and
affecting. Mor was overcome with emotion.


It was raining steadily. Mor had no overcoat. Rain had a small umbrella
swinging over her arm. She handed it to him in silence and he opened it above
them both. Arm in arm they made their way back to Bond Street.


\x{2018}Tea at Fortnum and Mason,\x{2019} Rain decreed.


Tea at Fortnum and Mason! Mor was suddenly filled with a deep and driving joy
which furrowed through his body with such force that he did not at first know
that it was indeed joy that shook him so. She had decided. He had decided too.
He could do no other. \x{2018}Rain \x{2014} \x{2019} he said.


She looked up, squeezing his arm, bright-eyed and confident. \x{2018}I know, she said.


The rain began to fall faster. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll tell you something,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m not
sure that I could really live outside England, not all the time, not even most
of the time.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Dear Mor, then we\x{2019}ll live in England!\x{2019} said Rain.


She clutched his arm more tightly. The rain began to pelt down with spitting
violence. They started to run as quickly as they could in the direction of
Fortnum\x{2019}s.",

thrust her arm through Mor\x{2019}s as they began to walk slowly back up the hill,
taking the little path that led from the Headmaster\x{2019}s garden into the wood. It
was the end of term. They had just been talking with Mr Everard. It was now
four days since the climbing of the tower, and nothing had been seen or heard
of Donald since the moment when he ran away across the playground and
disappeared into the darkness. The boys who had pursued him as far as the main
road had lost him there in the wilderness of fields and waste land on the other
side. He had vanished, and there had been no news of him since. After two days
of waiting, Mor had asked the help of the police, but without much hope of
results. Nan and Felicity had of course returned home at once, and now one of
them was always in the house in case the telephone rang. But it did not ring,
and Donald\x{2019}s absence and silence continued.


Jimmy Carde had had a miraculous escape from death. He was saved largely by Mr
Everard\x{2019}s pile of blankets; and was now in hospital with broken ribs, two
broken legs, and a fractured skull. He was declared to be in no immediate
danger, and likely to recover. Two of the boys who had tried to break his fall
were also in hospital with concussion.


Against both Carde and Donald Mor Mr Everard had reluctantly invoked the law
that decreed instant expulsion for climbers. He had been so apologetic to Mor
about this that the latter had virtually had to make up his mind for him,
pointing out that he had no choice but to expel them both. This was grave. What
was in a way more grave was that it was now two days before Donald\x{2019}s chemistry
exam was due to start. Everard had told Mor that there would of course be no
objection to Donald\x{2019}s taking the exam at St Bride\x{2019}s and using the laboratories
as he would normally have done. But Mor knew that now his son would not take
the examination, and was perhaps deliberately staying in hiding until the date
was past. This was very grievous to him; but to think of it in this way a
little relieved his more profound anxieties concerning Donald\x{2019}s well-being.


On the night of the catastrophe Rain and Demoyte came to see Mor at a very late
hour in Rain\x{2019}s car, and wanted to take him back then and there to Brayling\x{2019}s
Close. Mor had refused, since he felt he must stay in his own home in case of
telephone messages or in case Donald came back. Rain had cooked him a meal,
which he was unable to eat, and had administered a sedative. She and Demoyte
persuaded him to go to bed, and then they went away. Since then Mor had seen
her frequently, now always at the Close. He had convinced her of what he
himself hoped was the truth, that Donald was perfectly well but simply hiding
so as to miss his exam. Mor had not yet spoken to Nan about what he and Rain
intended to do. He knew that Rain was by now intensely anxious that he should
speak; but she had not yet attempted to discuss the matter with him again. Mor
found meanwhile that his resolution was unshaken, indeed the stronger for these
new troubles. But he had not yet found the moment at which, in the midst of
such distresses, he could decently tell his wife that he proposed to leave her.


Mor\x{2019}s anxiety about Donald was intense. But his anxiety about Rain was equally
intense; and he might, even then, have been able to speak decisively to Nan if
the latter had given him the slightest chance. Mor knew that what he needed, in
order to be able to speak with finality, was a moment of violence. If Nan, by
provoking him, or by visiting almost any extreme of emotion, had given him the
gift of anger or the sense of extremity, he would have spoken the words which would
be fatal. But Nan, as if once more to cross him, had been since her return
enormously calm, reasonable, and compliant, doing her best to generate once
more that atmosphere of homely ennui which Mor could still remember that
he had once found reassuring.


Nan was very worried too about Donald, but she had reasoned it out with Mor
that the boy had almost certainly come to no harm, and would reappear after the
opening date of the examination. As far as the exam was concerned, Nan was
obviously more glad than otherwise that Don would miss it, but she refrained
from irritating Mor by saying so. The person who was most genuinely afraid
about what might have happened to Donald was Felicity, who busied herself with
imagining the worst possible and was continually in tears. Nan vented some of
her nervousness upon her daughter, but whether intentionally or not did nothing
to upset her husband or to provide the great storm for which he was waiting and
on which alone he would have felt himself able to ride.


\x{2018}Evvy has been awfully nice, hasn\x{2019}t he?\x{2019} said Nan, still clinging on to Mor\x{2019}s
arm.


The wood was silent and empty. Many of the boys had already gone away on early
buses and the rest were hanging about in the playground or the upper drive,
waiting to be picked up. Some more charabancs were due at <<eleven o\x{2018}clock|6>> to
take the West Country contingent to the station.


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s very decent,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Did he say anything special to you before I
came?\x{2019}


Last year\x{2019}s leaves, and a few that had already floated down from the branches
after the recent storm, drifted about under the trees or blew sharply to and
fro across the path, striking their ankles. It was a dark windy morning.


\x{2018}He said they\x{2019}re going ahead with the presentation dinner for Demoyte\x{2019}s
picture,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s happening on Tuesday.\x{2019}


Of course they\x{2019}re going ahead!\x{2018} said Mor. \x{2019}Or does Evvy think the school ought
to be in mourning? Yes, I know it\x{2019}s Tuesday. Will you come - or shall we send
an excuse? It\x{2019}s perfectly easy to get out of it now.\x{2018}


They came to an open glade where the trees drew back to circle an expanse of
mossy earth and short grasses. Mor recognized the place, with the dull
revolving sadness that he now felt continually when he was in the presence of
his wife.


\x{2018}I shall come, I think,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}We\x{2019}d better go on making life as normal as
possible - it\x{2019}ll keep us from fretting too much. I even let Evvy persuade me
into saying a few words. I just hadn\x{2019}t the strength to say no. He said
something very short would do.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You\x{2019}ll answer the toast!\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m so glad.\x{2019} But he was not glad, he
thought, any more about anything connected with Nan. He felt as if he were
talking to someone who was already dead, but who didn\x{2019}t yet know it. He felt
such intense sadness at this thought that he would have liked to ask Nan to
comfort him in some way, but with the impulse he remembered that this too was
impossible. Nan was the one person who could not ever give him ease for the
pain that was in him now.


They passed by Prewett\x{2019}s house. It had an empty abandoned air, doors and
windows left open, silent of boys.


\x{2018}I wish Felicity would cheer up a bit and not be so wretched.\x{2019} said Mor. He had
to talk to stop himself from thinking.


\x{2018}She got a bad cold down at the sea,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}I found her wandering about in
her bathing suit late one evening. She hasn\x{2019}t been well since.\x{2019}


As they reached the gravel path behind the Library a sound was to be heard of
cheerful voices, laughter, and singing, and when they emerged on to the
playground they saw the crowd of boys waiting with their hand luggage near the
entrance to the drive. A charabanc had drawn up and some of the boys were
climbing in. In the background, beyond School House, a few private cars could
be seen drawn up on the grass, their doors wide open, being loaded with suitcases,
tennis rackets, cricket bats, and other paraphernalia. The mass of those who
were not yet called for stood by in a joyful chanting crowd to wave away the
departing ones. On this day all feuds were forgotten, and the most puny and
unpopular boy in the form would get a warm unanimous shout of farewell,
heartening and misleading to his parents, especially if the latter arrived to
fetch him in the latest Bentley or the oldest Rolls.


The charabanc had filled up, and began to move away amid shouting and waving. A
dozen boys ran after it down the drive, pushing it while it crawled slowly from
the asphalt to the gravel, and then pursuing it as it gathered pace, to escort
it as far as the gates. Hands were flapping out of every window. The charabanc
disappeared into a cloud of dust and cheering. Meanwhile the crowd in the
playground were dancing a Highland reel, accompanied by human voices imi tating
bagpipes, while through the windows of echoing and empty classrooms a few late
lingerers leaned out to shout to their friends or to unwind, contrary to Mr
Everard\x{2019}s most explicit wishes, long rolls of lavatory paper which undulated in
the wind like streamers.


\x{2018}Let\x{2019}s go round the other way,\x{2019} said Mor. He looked on the scene with
revulsion.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t be silly, Bill,\x{2019} said Nan. She drew him firmly on across the playground
towards the drive, keeping close to the wall of Main School. A group of reelers
removed their capering for a few steps to let them pass.


Good-bye, sir, happy holidays!\x{2018} called one or two voices.


\x{2018}Good-bye, good-bye, happy holidays!\x{2019} came the echoing cry from the rest of the
crowd.


Mor felt that he was anonymous. He was just one of the masters. He felt almost
annihilated by the presence of so much happiness. \x{2018}Good-bye,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}happy
holidays to you too.\x{2019}


They turned along the drive. As they neared the gates a car passed them slowly.
The window came down and the small head of Rigden came out, bobbing violently
as if it were on a spring.


\x{2018}Good-bye, sir,\x{2019} cried Rigden. \x{2018}Good luck - and see you next term!


Rigden\x{2019}s parents, who knew Mor slightly, could be seen waving within, anxious
now to escape and to avoid any last-minute courtesies. The car reached the main
road and joined the endless procession of fast-moving traffic, London-bound,
flying away into the world that lay outside St Bride\x{2019}s at an increasing pace as
Rigden\x{2019}s father, who was a very successful barrister, stepped hard on the
accelerator.


Mor and Nan turned into the suburban roads of the housing estate. In a minute
or two they had reached their own house. Felicity met them at the door.


\x{2018}Any news?\x{2019} she said. Her eyes had grown big and blood-shot with intermittent
weeping and continual expectation.


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Did anyone ring?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} she said, and went back to sit at the foot of the stairs.


Nan said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll make some coffee. Then I really must do that ironing. What are
you going to do, Bill?\x{2019}


Mor was going to see Rain at Brayling\x{2019}s Close. He said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll go down to the
Public Library on my bike - and then I\x{2019}d better go back into school and do
various jobs.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Must you really work today?\x{2019} said Nan, staring at him from the kitchen door.
\x{2018}I thought holidays had started.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}ve told you a hundred times,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}holidays don\x{2019}t start for me
at the end of term.\x{2019} He went into the drawing-room. Now that the weather was
cool it seemed a tiny room, hideously crowded with objects and jumbled with
colours and designs. He loathed himself.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t sit in that draughty place, darling,\x{2019} Nan was saying to Felicity. \x{2018}Come
and have your coffee.\x{2019}


Felicity said, \x{2018}I don\x{2019}t want any coffee. I\x{2019}m going to lie down for a while.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t be silly,\x{2019} said Nan, \x{2018}you\x{2019}ll only start crying again if you lie down.
Why not wash all your underclothes now while the water\x{2019}s hot? I\x{2019}ll leave out
the ironing board, and I can iron them for you this afternoon.\x{2019}


Felicity made no reply, but walked upstairs with a heavy tread and closed the
door of her room.


Nan brought in a tray with coffee and biscuits. They sat looking out of the
window. The garden was damp, and tousled by the wind.


\x{2018}The autumn is coming,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s strange how early you can see it. As
soon as the phlox comes out you know that the best part of the summer is over.
Then you can soon expect the falling leaves. You remember how pleased Liffey
used to be when the leaves began to fall? She would go on and on chasing them
about the lawn in such an idiotic way. Then when you had raked them together in
a heap she would charge into it and scatter it and you would be so cross.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}I remember.\x{2019} He finished his coffee quickly. \x{2018}I must be off
now,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll be back for lunch.\x{2019}


Nan got up and followed him into the hall. \x{2018}I think I\x{2019}ll just look in on
Felicity,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}The child will make herself ill with this grieving.\x{2019}


Mor left the house. He took his bicycle, started off in the direction of the
Library, turned sharply back down another road, and joined the dual carriageway
near the brow of the hill. Then he sailed swiftly down the other side towards
Demoyte\x{2019}s house, the wind pressing upon his cheeks and jerking at his hair. The
clouds came low over the road ahead of him, which went straight on into the far
distance, an arrow pointing towards London. The wind was fresh and carried a
smell of the countryside. Mor threw back his head. He existed still, he, Mor,
and could do what he would. In a minute he would see his dear one, whose
presence would dispel all horror and all grief. Already the splendour of it
touched him, driving the blackness out of his flesh - and all things began to
fall into place again as preliminaries to a life of renewed truthfulness and
love. By the time he reached the door of the Close his heart was light.


He went straight into the drawing-room, where he found Rain sitting with
Demoyte. They were a great deal together in these days. When Mor came in, Rain
jumped up and ran to seize the sleeve of his coat, while Demoyte looked on with
a sombre expression.


\x{2018}This place is turning into a madhouse,\x{2019} said Demoyte. He began to gather up
his books preparatory to leaving the room.


Don\x{2019}t go, sir,\x{2018} said Mor.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t give me that stuff,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ll be in the library, if either of
you wants to see me, which is unlikely.\x{2019}


As soon as the door closed, Mor picked Rain up violently in his arms and held
her as if to crush their two bodies into one. It seemed as if such an embrace
must surely mend all. He set her down at last, protesting and laughing a
little.


She led him to a chair, in a way that was now familiar to him, and sat on the
ground before him to interrogate him. He had little to tell her.


\x{2018}How was it this morning?\x{2019} asked Rain.


How could he tell her how it was? This morning he had suffered to extremity.
This morning he had been a liar and a traitor. But now he could scarcely
remember these things - as perhaps the blessed spirits when they enter paradise
very soon forget the horrors of purgatory which seem to have been a dream until
they vanished altogether from the memory.


\x{2018}This morning was all right, said Mor. He had already told her that there was
no news of Donald.


\x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} said Rain, tugging at his knees, \x{2018}you haven\x{2019}t - said anything to Nan
yet?\x{2019}


This was the question which Mor had been dreading. \x{2018}No,\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}Will you - soon?\x{2019} she asked. Her look of tender anxiety made Mor cover his
face.


\x{2018}Rain,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}I can\x{2019}t give this blow to Nan just now, just when we\x{2019}re so
worried about Donald. We must wait a little longer.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Mor,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}I cannot wait. I know this impatience may be very
tiresome or wicked. If it\x{2019}s wicked, it hardly adds much to the sum of what
we\x{2019}ve already done wrong. But I think we should tell Nan the truth now, even if
it is a bad moment.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Why now?\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Or are you afraid I\x{2019}ll change my mind?\x{2019} He held her by
the chin, and looked into her eyes. He had never known before what it was to
converse with someone, reading their eyes the whole time. Angels must know each
other in this way, without a barrier.


\x{2018}Not that!\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}Yet I am afraid of something, I don\x{2019}t know what. I want
to bind you to me.\x{2019} Her small hands gripped his wrists and tried to shake him.


When Mor saw her intensity and her determination, he felt deep gratitude. He
drew her towards him. \x{2018}So you shall, my dearest,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}But you must leave
this other matter to me. Now tell me about something else. Have you worked on
the picture again?\x{2019}


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}I haven\x{2019}t touched it. I feel far too rotten to paint. It\x{2019}s no
good, but it\x{2019}ll have to stay like that\x{2019}


The picture had been taken from the easel and was leaning against the wall in
the far comer of the room. They both looked at it. It seemed now to Mor a
little less good. He even thought he saw dimly what Bledyard had meant. The
colossal strength of Demoyte\x{2019}s over-sized tyrannical head was not really
present in the picture - though many of his traits were present, especially a
musing thoughtfulness which Mor had not often seen in him, but which he was
ready now to believe to be one of his most fundamental moods. It was a gentler
and more pensive Demoyte that the picture showed - but also one that was less
strong. However, there was no doubt that it was a good portrait.


I\x{2019}m sorry,\x{2018} said Mor. \x{2019}I hate having stopped you from painting.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Nothing could stop me,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}except for a moment!\x{2019}


\x{2018}You know this awful dinner is on Tuesday?\x{2019} said Mor.


Rain shuddered. \x{2018}Your wife won\x{2019}t be there, will she?\x{2019} she asked.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but that won\x{2019}t matter.\x{2019}


Rain jumped to her feet. \x{2018}I can\x{2019}t come to the dinner if your wife is there,\x{2019}
she said, \x{2018}I can\x{2019}t.\x{2019} She was almost crying.


\x{2018}Darling,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}don\x{2019}t be foolish. It\x{2019}ll be awful, but it\x{2019}s just something
we must get through. It\x{2019}s no madder than everything else is at the moment.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You must tell her at once!\x{2019} she said.


\x{2018}Rain,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}leave it to me, will you?\x{2019}


Rain was suddenly in tears. He embraced her. \x{2018}I can\x{2019}t,\x{2019} she kept saying, \x{2018}I
can\x{2019}t go to that dinner, I can\x{2019}t\x{2018}


Stop this nonsense,\x{2018} said Mor, \x{2019}you must come to the dinner, of course.\x{2018} He
added, \x{2019}Anything may have happened by then. I may have told Nan everything. As
for the dinner, if she doesn\x{2019}t know the worst she won\x{2019}t attack you, and if she
does she won\x{2019}t come. So stop crying.\x{2018} But somehow Mor did not believe that he
would have told Nan by next Tuesday. There was some date by which he would have
told her. But it was not next Tuesday.


Rain sat down on the floor again and went on crying. Mor stroked her hair. He
felt a strange diminution of sympathy. He loved her. Now he made her grief. But
soon he would make her happiness. Meanwhile, it was he who was to be pitied, he
who had to act the murderer and the traitor. Her grief was that of a temporary
deprivation. His was a grief for things which would never mend again once they
were broken. There would be a new life and a new world. But that which he was
about to break would never mend, and he now knew he would never cease to feel
the pain of it. Inside all his happiness this pain would remain always intact
until his life\x{2019}s end. He continued to caress her hair.",

IT was Tuesday. The opening date of the chemistry exam had come and gone, but
Donald Mor had not come home, nor had any news been received which might
provide the slightest clue to his whereabouts. Mor had not told Nan that he
intended to leave her. It was the day of the presentation dinner. Rain was to
be present, of course; and Nan had not changed her mind either about coming or
about replying to the toast.


The dinner was to take place in the masters\x{2019} dining-room at St Bride\x{2019}s, and its
organization had for some time now been producing alarm and confusion among the
school staff who were rarely called upon to stage manage anything more
magnificent than a stand-up tea for Speech Day. The masters\x{2019} dining-room, like
so many things at St Bride\x{2019}s, was misnamed. No one at that institution ever dined
in that room or elsewhere, since the relevant meal was known, not at all
inappropriately, as supper - and in fact the room in question was not normally
used for eating in at all, but had become the meeting place of the Board of
Governors, the Sixth Form Essay Society, and the Games Committee. To transform
this grim chamber into the setting for a festive scene was not likely to be
easy. Great efforts had however been made, inspired largely by the ubiquitous
Hensman, whose enthusiasm was the more touching as he was not to be present at
the dinner, since after much discussion it had been decided that only senior
masters were to be invited in addition to the Governors.


Mor was in evening-dress. This was, for him, an extremely rare experience, and
he felt very odd. He had bought himself, especially for the occasion, a soft
white evening-shirt to replace the errant carapace by which he had been
tortured in the past; but he still felt at wearing these unusual clothes an
intense discomfort which was caused partly by general embarrassment and partly
by the discovery that he must have grown stouter since the last occasion. The
trousers met, but only just. Fortunately the old-fashioned jacket could be left
unbuttoned. For all that, he thought that he looked well, and he reflected
sadly that it would, if things had been different, have been a pleasant jest to
show himself to Rain in this disguise. This thought shocked him by its
lightness, and he turned quickly back to his griefs. He was in a state of
increasing disquiet about the fate of his son. His imagination had begun at last
to be busy with visions of Donald bitterly resolving never to return, Donald
suffering from loss of memory, Donald suffering from hunger and despair, Donald
derelict, Donald dead. These fears, by a strange chemistry of the afflicted
spirit, slightly eased his other tensions by making it the more obvious that
nothing could be told to Nan until after the reappearance of the boy.


The company was supposed to assemble at <<seven-thirty|5b>> in the Common Room which
adjoined the masters\x{2019} dining-room. Dinner was to be at <<eight|9c:1>>. Mor had made
arrangements for a taxi to call for Nan <<just before half past seven|10>>, and to go
on to fetch Mrs Prewett. Rain was going to bring Demoyte over in her car. Mor
himself had intended to get dressed much earlier and go over to schoel to offer
his assistance to the staff and make sure that everything was quite ready in
the dining-room. However, his dressing had taken longer than he expected, and
it was <<nearly seven|9c:1>> before he reached the scene. He peered in through the
dining-room door; and then entered, whistling with amazement for the benefit of
Hensman, who was standing by hoping to see signs of shock.


The room had certainly been transformed. The green leather armchairs were
nowhere to be seen, and neither was the ponderous roll-top desk which was
usually slanted across one of the corners, nor the massive deal cupboard whose
contents were unknown since the key had been lost some years ago. Instead of
these, three slim Regency tables, which Mor recognized as belonging to Prewett,
decked the side of the room, adorned with flowers, and a fine sideboard had
appeared to fill the space on one side of the mantelpiece. Of the upright
chairs, the more deplorable ones had vanished, to be replaced by some imitation
Chippendale, also Prewett\x{2019}s, which did not harmonize too badly with the set of
Victorian chairs which were the normal inhabitants of the room. The long oval
table, usually covered with a length of green baize, was draped now in a
silvery damask cloth which reached almost to the ground, and upon it a thick
array of silver and glass in the light of some of the candles which Hensman had
experimentally lighted. From the mantelpiece the bulbous and inexplicable brass
ornaments had vanished, to be replaced by flowers - and above the mantel, surmounting
all, was hung the portrait of Demoyte.


\x{2018}Marvellous!\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s unrecognizable.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You relieve my mind,\x{2019} said Hensman. \x{2018}I feared some traces might remain! You
know Evvy\x{2019}s motto - if a thing\x{2019}s worth doing it\x{2019}s worth just blundering through
somehow. I thought I\x{2019}d better take things in hand. I\x{2019}m afraid the walls are
rather discoloured where we\x{2019}ve taken the monstrosities away, but when it gets
dark and you\x{2019}ve got nothing but candlelight that won\x{2019}t show.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry you won\x{2019}t be here,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t you worry,\x{2019} said Hensman. \x{2018}There\x{2019}s another party below stairs! The man
I\x{2019}m sorry for is Baseford - he\x{2019}ll never get over missing this spread. Two kinds
of wine, and all! By the way, did I tell you how the sherry battle ended? Evvy
has now demanded the very best Spanish and nothing else will do!\x{2019} Evvy had
previously been of the opinion that South African sherry, if served from
decanters, would be quite good enough for his guests, especially as, in his
view, it was mere snobbery to pretend that there was any difference in taste.


Mor laughed. \x{2018}You\x{2019}d better go and change,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s <<after seven|9f>>.\x{2019} Hensman
was still dressed for tennis. Junior masters had been invited to the brief
sherry-drinking before the dinner; for this they had been let off with lounge
suits.


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m not coming,\x{2019} said Hensman. \x{2018}I bequeath to you the company of Sir Somebody
Something-Something, Bart, and other such late joys. I must start organizing my
own party. I\x{2019}m just off to fetch my guitar. Cheerio! Happy drinking.\x{2019}


Mor was left alone. He blew out the candles which Hensman had left burning, and
began to look up at the picture of Demoyte which was hung high up, Rain was
sure to think too high, above the ornate Victorian fireplace. It was a sunny
evening, and the light was still good. The masters\x{2019} dining-room was situated at
the end of the upper floor of the Phys and Gym building and was served by a
kitchen which was now incorporated in Mr Baseford\x{2019}s flat. It faced west, so
that the sun was shining in past the heavy rep curtains, the colour of an old
inky desk top, which Mor reflected must not be drawn together on any account.
The picture of Demoyte looked different again. Bledyard had said that the man
in the picture did not look mortal. To Mor then it seemed a very mortal face.
But he knew that he was touched by the occasion, and by memories of the almost
incredulous regret he had felt at the thought that the old tyrant, who had been
used to an almost complete authority over hundreds of souls that feared him,
was to be reft of his power and sent into exile, able now only to oppress and
punish those who loved him. The number of those, Mor thought sadly, was few
enough. This evening\x{2019}s gathering would number more of Demoyte\x{2019}s enemies than of
his friends.


At that moment an efficient-looking butler, hired for the occasion, appeared
and ushered Mor away into the adjoining Common Room. The butler then returned
to put the finishing touches to Hensman\x{2019}s masterpiece. As Mor entered the
Common Room, Evvy came in the door, followed by Prewett. Another butler
materialized with a large silver tray covered with sherry-glasses which had
already been filled. Mor suddenly began to feel extremely nervous and
apprehensive. Rain\x{2019}s terrors had not left him untouched. He tried to calm
himself by picturing the relief which he would feel when this absurd and
hateful evening was over.


\x{2018}Ah, my dear fellow,\x{2019} said Evvy, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m so glad you\x{2019}re here early. Yes, yes, I\x{2019}ve
seen the dining-room. Hensman\x{2019}s done a fine job of work. I hope he\x{2019}ll be able
to be with us for the sherry - but he said he had a meeting of Scouts this
evening and mightn\x{2019}t manage to come.\x{2019}


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s gone off to Scouts, I\x{2019}m afraid,\x{2019} said Mor. He was too depressed to take
any pleasure in Hensman\x{2019}s little joke.


Too bad!\x{2018} said Evvy. \x{2019}I wanted his opinion on the sherry. Spanish, you know!\x{2018}
Evvy made a face like a choirboy acting a French rou\x{e9} in a parish play.
\x{2019}No point in spoiling the ship for a ha\x{2018}porth of tar, is there? That\x{2019}s my text
for first School Service of next term, so I thought I\x{2019}d better be guided by it!
I only hope the Governors won\x{2019}t think we\x{2019}re indulging in unnecessary expense.


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}they\x{2019}ll be delighted.\x{2019} The irresponsible reactionary old
sybarites, he added to himself. Demoyte had always been quite right about the
Governors.


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s only once in a while, isn\x{2019}t it?\x{2019} said Evvy. \x{2018}Do you think one might just
sip some sherry before our guests arrive, to try it? I must confess, I need
some Dutch courage. Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking\x{201c} is the simple
truth for me, a sermon isn\x{2019}t the same thing at all, and the prospect will quite
spoil my dinner. By the way, Bill, I\x{2019}m so glad your wife has agreed to speak,
it\x{2019}s terribly kind of her to take it on. She really was my last hope. I\x{2019}d asked
at least twelve people before I got to her.


Mor noted this instance of Evvy\x{2019}s tact, saw Prewett note it, and forgot it at
once. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m glad too,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}It\x{2019}ll be good for her.\x{2019} The words were empty.
The future in which Nan would enjoy the benefit of her daring did not belong to
him.


The door opened to admit Sir Leopold Tinsley-Williams, the man with whose
company Hensman was so ready to dispense, followed by Bledyard and two other
masters. Evvy, who had just taken a glass of sherry from the tray, turned with
inarticulate cries of embarrassment and welcome, and spilt the sherry with one
hand, while the other sawed to and fro, undecided whether it should shake hands
with Sir Leopold or offer him a drink. The butler took charge of the situation,
spreading social calm by the very bend of his head.


Mor retired a step or two with Prewett, and was glad to find a drink in his
hand. Prewett looked rather odd in evening-dress too. Mor was relieved to be
with him for a moment. He replied briefly to his inquiries about Don. Some more
Governors arrived. Mor and Prewett backed farther away and surveyed the scene,
making comments. It was notable that Bledyard\x{2019}s evening-dress fitted him
extremely well, and made him look handsome and slightly wicked. He looked like
a man who was used to these garments, and in this respect resembled the
Governors rather than the masters. He was talking now in an animated way to
several of the former, among whom he appeared to have a number of steady
acquaintances.


The old school tie does its stuff!\x{2018} said Prewett. Prewett had been at Bradford
Grammar School.


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t think so,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}They take him for a person of distinction. And
they are right,\x{2019} he added.


\x{2018}What I hate,\x{2019} said Prewett, \x{2018}is to see Evvy crawling to those swine. He
doesn\x{2019}t seem to realize he\x{2019}s worth ten of each of them.\x{2019}


Nan and Mrs Prewett came in, causing a stir. Mor turned towards his wife and
felt the accustomed shock at seeing her in party array. She was wearing an
extremely d\x{e9}collet\x{e9} black nylon evening-dress, with a very full skirt
and sort of bustle at the back. About her shoulders she wore a cloudy yellow
stole, made of some gauzy material and run through with golden threads. She
also had on the ear-rings which Mor had accepted for her from Tim Burke,
although they didn\x{2019}t quite go with the severe smartness of the dress. Her fine
bosom, extensively revealed, was rounded and powdery smooth. Her hair was
sleekly curled about her face, in a fashion reminiscent of the
nineteen-twenties, which showed off very well the strong shape of her head and
the slenderness and pallor of her neck. She surveyed the room without
nervousness. Her eyes flamed towards her husband.


After her came Mrs Prewett. Mrs Prewett was a tall stout woman, with a broad
tranquil face and very large hands. She had elected to don a dinner-gown made
of coffee-coloured lace, with a coffee-coloured slip to match. A serrated line
crossed her enormous front from east to west, below it the generous contour of
her breasts, above it a flicker of underclothes and an expanse of flesh mottled
by the sun to a deep reddish brown. Her arms, which were white and rather
plump, swung energetically from the short puffy sleeves of the lace gown as she
looked about for Mr Prewett. She saw him and swept forward with a shout.
Prewett was obviously delighted to see her. He began complimenting her on her
appearance. With a strange pang of sadness Mor turned away to join Nan. Nan
meanwhile had been presented to Sir Leopold, and was making herself extremely
charming to him. Mor stood by watching, not included and feeling awkward.


Then Rain and Demoyte arrived. A curious synthetic cheer greeted their
appearance, and a number of people hastened to surround them and make the
pretence of a festive welcome. Sir Leopold, who had always detested Demoyte,
made no move, but went on talking to Nan, his eyes riveted to the point at
which her dress indicated, but just failed to reveal, the division between her
breasts. Sir Leopold was well placed and he made the best of his height. Mor
stepped back a little, so that he could observe the newcomers without being
anywhere in Nan\x{2019}s field of vision.


Demoyte looked splendid. He wore his evening-dress like a soldier, and
confronted his foes with the familiar front, as shameless as brass and as hard
as steel. He cast a belligerent look round the room, his lips already trembling
with scorn. Beside him Rain was tiny. She wore a long white cotton
evening-dress, very simply covered with blue flowers with black outlines, drawn
well in to her small waist. A long twining string of black carved beads seemed
to make her neck longer and her black-capped head smaller. Her hair was
slightly untidy. She looked like a boy actor. Mor felt his heart twist and turn
within him for sheer tenderness. He looked towards them with a love which
embraced them both, the old man and the girl.


One of the Governors was being polite to Rain, and cutting out Evvy, who was
also trying to talk to her. Demoyte was talking to Bledyard, and conspicuously
indicating by his behaviour that this was one of the few people in the room
that he could tolerate. Sir Leopold was still concentrating. Nan had turned a
little so that she could see Mor. Mor looked away. He tried to attend to the
problem of how to be rude enough to Sir Leopold for the latter to realize that
the rudeness was intentional without being so rude as to be boorish.


Dinner was announced. Evvy had of course given no thought to the question of
precedence. There was a courteous scrimmage in the doorway. The women were
pushed forward. Besides Rain, Nan, and Mrs Prewett, there was a Mrs Kingsley,
the wife of one of the Governors who had arrived rather late and was patently
the oldest woman present. Evvy was now attempting to urge Rain through the door
while Rain was trying to give way to Mrs Kingsley. Eventually, after an
embarrassed silence had fallen and the protagonists had all started to say
something and stopped, alarmed by the pause, Sir Leopold passed through the
door first, with Mrs Kingsley on one arm and Nan on the other. Evvy followed
with Rain and Mrs Prewett. Demoyte and Bledyard, still talking, went through
next, and everyone else came after in a hurly-burly.


Fortunately the places at the table were all clearly labelled, so that the
confusion was not repeated in the dining-room. Everyone found his position and
Evvy said grace at some length. The company then sat down with relief and
immediately received their soup. The place of honour was in the centre of the
table facing the picture. Here sat Evvy in the middle place, with Rain on his
right and Mrs Kingsley on his left. Demoyte sat next to Rain, and Sir Leopold
next to Demoyte. Nan was on the other side of Sir Leopold. Another Governor was
next to Mrs Kingsley, and Mrs Prewett sat at the end of the table next to
Bledyard, with whom to everyone\x{2019}s continually renewed surprise she seemed to
get on very well. The rest of the company were disposed round the ends of the
table and along the side nearest to the fireplace. Here Mor sat, opposite to
Sir Leopold, so that both the women were facing him, Nan to his left and Rain
to his right farther away. The fish had by now arrived, and with it the welcome
glass of white wine. Mor hoped that Hensman had briefed Evvy about quantity as
well as quality of wine. He felt an extreme need of alcohol, and spent a vain
moment wishing that he were altogether elsewhere with Hensman and the guitar.


The soup and fish were good. The meat was only middling, but it mattered less
as there was a good deal of red wine to wash it down with. Mor heard one of the
Governors asking the name and year of the wine and approving of the answer.
Evvy had evidently been well schooled by someone, doubtless Hensman. Mor
emptied another glass. He began to feel a little less anxious. The evening was
now half over and the women had so far not had occasion to notice each other.
At this moment they could not even see one another, since they were on the same
side of the table, and he could keep them both under his eye. Demoyte and Sir
Leopold ignored each other. Sir Leopold talked to Nan, while Demoyte talked to
Rain, across Rain to Evvy, or across the table to Mor. When not actually
addressed, Mor sat silent, watching his wife and his beloved, turning over in
his heart the grievous things that he knew, and waiting for the evening to end.


At last came the toast to the Queen, and the meditative glow of cigars was to
be seen appearing here and there along the table. It was quite dark outside by
now and the candles gave a bright but soft light to the room, in which gentle
illumination the stained walls were, as Hensman had predicted, not conspicuous.
Fortunately nobody so far seemed anxious to draw the curtains. Mor discovered
to his relief that Madeira was to be served with the fruit. The waiter was not
insensitive to his needs, and his glass was filled again. The candlelight touched
the wine-glasses and the scattered silver. He looked through a maze of
reflections towards Rain, and managed to catch her attention. She flashed him a
quick look, humorous and loving, and made as if to close one eye. Mor, with a
surreptitious and ambiguous movement, raised his glass towards her. She looked
away. He now felt impelled to look at Nan. She was gazing towards him, though
in lively and gesturing conversation with Sir Leopold. Mor noticed that she had
drunk a little wine.


The first of the official toasts was the toast to Demoyte, which was to be
proposed by Sir Leopold and answered by Evvy. The second toast was the toast to
the School, to be proposed by Demoyte and answered by Nan. Sir Leopold rose to
his feet and a serene silence fell, rich with the harmony which a large
quantity of alcohol had introduced into the conscious and unconscious minds of
the company. They looked up benevolently at Sir Leopold. Even Mor controlled
his nausea. Sir Leopold, it would seem, was faced with the almost impossible
task of proposing a toast to Demoyte without saying anything pleasant about
him. But Sir Leopold\x{2019}s ingenuity turned out to be equal to the occasion. He
contrived to say nothing pleasant about Demoyte by saying nothing about him at
all. He spoke at length about St Bride\x{2019}s, its history, its high traditions, and
the great line of its headmasters, all dedicated, at least those of them who
were worthy of their trust, to the task which Mr Everard had so aptly described
as \x{2018}the full development of the good seed of the personality\x{2019}, regardless of
intellectual excellence. Hatred of Demoyte had triumphed, in Sir Leopold\x{2019}s
bosom, over contempt for Evvy. He was prepared even to exalt Evvy in order to
annoy Demoyte. The latter listened unmoved, showing in lip and eye how
impossible he considered it that he could be belittled by such a person. Sir
Leopold sat down amid lukewarm applause. He was not, in any quarter, a popular
figure.


Mor was wishing that Nan\x{2019}s speech was not the last one. He was anxious for it
to be over, as he was feeling a good deal of nervous apprehension on his wife\x{2019}s
behalf. He imagined how scared Nan must be feeling. He knew that there was a
special absurdity in his identifying himself, at this hour, with Nan; but it
was the habit of half a lifetime and it was the absurdity which at present
composed his whole being. He felt fairly sure that Nan would acquit herself
well. She would certainly have something decent to say - only her delivery of
it might be nervous and halting.


Evvy was now talking. Long practice in Hall and Chapel had made Mor able to
switch off Evvy\x{2019}s voice completely. With an effort he switched it on again. \x{2018} \x{2014}
whom we know and love,\x{2019} said Evvy. Accustomed as Evvy was to think the best of
everybody, it had not quite escaped his attention that Sir Leopold had been
rude to Demoyte; and he tried to make amends, laying it on, it seemed to Mor,
rather thick. \x{2018}Under whose able and inspiring leadership,\x{2019} Evvy was saying, \x{2018}st
Bride\x{2019}s rose from the deplorable slough in which it formerly lay, and became,
dare we say it, a sound and reputable public school of the second class.\x{2019}


Evvy was here excelling himself, having forgotten that one of the Governors
present was the younger son of the Headmaster who had preceded Demoyte. Mor
looked along the table at this gentleman, whose eyebrows had flown up into
furious triangles, and then looked to see how Demoyte liked Evvy\x{2019}s description
of his achievement. Demoyte seemed amused. This was probably due to the
proximity of Rain, who looked as if she might burst into wild laughter at any
moment. When Mor saw her so gay, although he knew that it was largely the
effect of the wine, he felt irritation and sadness. Nothing today could have
moved him to gaiety or laughter. Agonizing thoughts about Donald came back into
his mind. Where was his son now? He did not believe that any bodily harm could
have come to Donald. But to what other demons might he not now be the prey? He
pictured Donald sitting at this moment in some dreary caf\x{e9}, staring at a
stained tablecloth, while the waitress looked on, contemptuous and curious, or
else in a public house, trying to look several years older, and avoiding the
eye of the barmaid, or walking along a country road in the dark, caught in the
headlights of cars, trying to beg a lift to - where? Afraid to come home.
Afraid.


\x{2018} \x{2014} that I did not find it easy to be the successor to such a man,\x{2019} Evvy was
saying. His speech was turning out to be far too long, as usual. Sir Leopold
had set the decanter circulating, and a whispered conversation was going on at
the far end of the table. Each man protected himself from boredom after his own
fashion: Sir Leopold by drinking and looking sideways into the top of Nan\x{2019}s
dress, Rain by suppressed laughter, Demoyte by amused contempt, Mr Prewett by talking
to his neighbour, and Bledyard by talking to himself.


Evvy continued, \x{2018}And it has been my constant study to resemble him in every way
possible.\x{2019} This was almost too much for Rain. It became clear from Demoyte\x{2019}s
expression that she had kicked him under the table. They looked at each other.
What a spring of life she has within her, Mor thought, to be able to laugh at
such a time. But the secret of this is simple. She is young.


Evvy\x{2019}s voice was now taking on the elevated and lilting quality which it displayed
in Chapel when he was nearing the end of a sermon. \x{2018} \x{2014} that in future years,
when time and mortality shall have taken from us the great original, we shall
be privileged to possess, for the admiration of the boys and the wonder of our
visitors, this painting, the representation by so distinguished a painter of so
distinguished a man.\x{2019} Polite clapping broke out. Evvy sat down, and everyone
looked at Demoyte.


Demoyte rose to his feet. \x{2018}Ladies and gentlemen,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}this is for me a
moving and a sad occasion. It is the first time since my retirement that I have
set foot inside the school which was for so many years my creation and my home.
Needless to say, my absence from this scene has been at my own wish, unwilling
as I am to play, within these walls which are so dear to me, the role merely of
an ancestral ghost whose days of productivity are past and who can now only
unnerve and terrify the beholder. This would in itself be a theme for sadness.
Add to this, however, the fact that what has called up this apparition is the
presence in the world of something new \x{2014} a work of art: the extremely fine
picture which we now have before us.\x{2019}


Demoyte looked up at the picture. So did everyone else, the guests nearest the
fireplace leaning backwards across the table in order to see it. Nobody was
bored now.


\x{2018}The reverend speaker who preceded me,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}spoke, as it is his
especial right to do, of mortality. And what indeed could be more calculated to
impress upon one a sense of finitude than the dedication, to the place where
one has passed, such as it was, one\x{2019}s life, of an image of oneself, to be left
as a memorial for future generations? This is to give a palpable body to the
sad truth that we can enjoy immortality only in the thoughts of others-aplace
in which during our lives we have not always been cherished and in which after
our death we shall be without defence. I speak, of course, sub spetie
temporis.\x{2019}


A polite smile spread round the table. Demoyte had transformed the scene. The
look of condescension which the Governors had been wearing all the evening had
faded now from their faces. They no longer felt themselves to be conferring, by
their presence, a favour upon a bunch of simple-minded provincial
schoolmasters.


\x{2018}This truth,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}may trouble us or it may merely wound us. My
situation is, however, more complex - since I am so fortunate as to have my
image passed on to posterity by the brilliant brush of Miss Carter, whom we are
so glad and so privileged to have with us tonight.\x{2019} Applause followed. About
time, thought Mor. He looked at Rain. He felt proud.


\x{2018}Such an experience,\x{2019} Demoyte went on, \x{2018}cannot but induce humility. How well we
know the faces and how little we are concerned with the obscure careers of so
many of the men and women whom the great painters of the past have made to live
forever among us. Who was Dr Peral? Who was Jacob Trip? Who were Mr and Mrs
Arnolfini? In a way we know, with a supreme knowledge, since we may look upon
their faces through the eye of a genius. In a way we do not know, nor do we
care, what were their talents, their hopes, and their fears, or how they must
have appeared to themselves. And so he too will live on, this obscure
schoolmaster, held in the profound, and if I may say so, charitable, vision of
Miss Carter - and it is a consolation to think that if St Bride\x{2019}s is in the
years to come distinguished for nothing else, it will at least be a place of
pilgrimage for those who are interested in the early work of one who - can we
doubt it in the face of such evidence - is destined to be one of the more
remarkable painters of her age.\x{2019}


Mor was watching Rain. Demoyte continued to speak. She was fingering her glass,
looking down, frowning. She was moved by his words. Mor returned his glance to
the tablecloth, and then after a suitable interval looked at Nan.


Nan was looking, for the first time that evening, thoroughly nervous and
disturbed. She was looking straight ahead of her with an unseeing stare, and
her hand which lay upon the table was visibly trembling. She had drawn out of
her handbag and clutched in her other hand a small piece of paper with notes
upon it. A deep blush had spread downward from her cheeks to her neck. Her lips
moved slightly. Poor Nan, thought Mor. He tried to catch her eye. She turned
towards him - and he was startled by the scared and wide-eyed expression with
which she looked at him. He smiled and made an encouraging gesture with his
hand. Mad, mad, he thought to himself, all is mad. But at least this evening
will soon be done. After Nan\x{2019}s speech they would adjourn to the Common Room,
and soon after that one could decently go. The evening was almost over. Nan was
still giving him a look of distress and fear, and he could see now that her
lower jaw was trembling. He had to look away. He was beginning to tremble
himself. He hoped that she would not blunder too much. It was certainly hard on
her, following after so accomplished a speaker as Demoyte.


By now Demoyte\x{2019}s speech was almost done. He was speaking of the school. He was
even being gracious to Evvy. At last the toast was being proposed: St Bride\x{2019}s!
They lifted their glasses. Sir Leopold was laying an encouraging hand upon
Nan\x{2019}s bare arm. Nan rose to her feet. Mor averted his eyes and tried to think
how splendid it would be in a few minutes when they had all escaped into the
Common Room and could relax.


\x{2018}Ladies and gentlemen,\x{2019} said Nan, her voice pitched higher than usual and
quivering with the uncanny refinement of the nervous woman, \x{2018}I am privileged
and pleased that such a gathering as this should be the occasion of my very
first public speech.\x{2019} Everyone was leaning forward, looking upon her
sympathetically. \x{2018}And it is fitting too that the person who answers the toast
that we have just had should be an outsider, a mere wife, someone who, while
living in the shadow of this great institution, does not really form part of
it.\x{2019}


Mor began to feel some relief. Nan had caught the absurd tone of the evening\x{2019}s
proceedings quite well. Her voice was becoming steadier. Now she was going on
to say suitably banal and complimentary things about St Bride\x{2019}s. She was
acquitting herself quite respectably. Another sentence or two, thought Mor, and
she will have said enough and can decently sit down. He looked up approvingly,
hoping that she was about to make an end. But Nan went on.


\x{2018}St Bride\x{2019}s,\x{2019} she was saying, \x{2018}has always been distinguished for its tradition
of public service. Our great democracy has not looked towards St Bride\x{2019}s in
vain - and public servants in all ranks of honourable employment are numbered
among our old boys\x{2019} Mor smiled inwardly. He knew just how much Nan cared about
traditions of public service. He was amazed at her capacity to put on this act.
He would not have suspected her capable of such a masquerade.


\x{2018}I trust then,\x{2019} Nan was saying - her voice was trembling again now, \x{2018}that you
will not think it unsuitable if, before ending my speech, I strike a more
personal note. The windows of St Bride\x{2019}s have never, as we know, been closed
upon the world of commerce and of politics. Enriched by contact with the
School, many have gone out, boys and masters alike, into the world beyond the
classroom and the library And here I am sure you will pardon me if I speak to
you of something which has long been known to many of you - the ambitions of my
husband.\x{2019}


Mor jumped, and upset what remained of his glass of wine. He looked up quickly
at Nan. She was looking at the ceiling, her mouth open to speak again. Mor\x{2019}s
heart began to twist within him like a corkscrew. But still he did not realize
what was coming.


\x{2018}It has been for many years,\x{2019} Nan went on, \x{2018}the dear wish and ambition of my
husband, myself, and our children that he should serve his country in the
highest role to which a democratic society can call its citizens - that of a
Member of Parliament. After a long period of patient work, my husband has now
the great happiness of being able to realize his lifelong ambition. The nearby
borough of Marsington have decided to adopt him as their Labour candidate - and
as we know, Marsington, with all respect to those present who are of the other
party, is a safe Labour seat.\x{2019}


Amazement, horror, and anger struggled within him; Mor could scarcely believe
his ears. He turned his head to where Demoyte and Rain were sitting. Demoyte
looked completely stunned; he was half turned towards Nan, his hand raised to
his mouth. Then he turned sharply back towards Mor, a look of surprise, dismay,
and accusation. But it was the face of Rain that made Mor almost cry out aloud.
He had told her nothing of his political plans. She was hearing of them now for
the first time. She looked towards him, her lips parting as if to question him,
her eyes expressing astonishment and sheer horror, her whole face working in an
agony of interrogation. Mor shook his head violently.


Nan was going on. \x{2018}As Shakespeare says, there is a tide in the affairs of men
that taken at the flood leads on to fortune. This tide now runs for my husband,
and for myself, and for our children. We have discussed the matter fully, and
we are at last agreed that there is no other bond or tie which can prevent us
from adventuring forward together. Courage is needed to make the great step. To
delay would be fatal. Such a chance comes but once in a lifetime. Courage he
has never lacked - nor is it likely that he will hesitate now when all his
deepest and most cherished wishes are about to find so complete a fulfilment.\x{2019}


Mor was breathing deeply. He was still almost deprived of breath by the shock.
Who would have thought that Nan would be so ingenious - or so desperate? He
knew that something vital, perhaps final, was happening to him, but he did not
fully see what it was. He tried to keep Rain\x{2019}s eyes, but she turned away from
him, grimacing with distress. Mor told himself that what he ought to do now,
now this very minute, was to get up from his seat and lead Rain out of the
room. Nan had attempted to comer him by a public gesture. She should be
answered in the same way. To rise now and go out with Rain would set the seal
on all his intentions. At last Nan had raised the storm. It was for him to ride
it. But Rain had turned away her eyes - and although Mor struggled in his seat
he could not bring himself to get up. A lifetime of conformity was too much for
him. He stayed where he was.


\x{2018}To you, therefore, my husband\x{2019}s friends and colleagues,\x{2019} Nan continued, \x{2018}I
turn at this crucial moment of choice, and ask for your blessing and your good
wishes for an enterprise worthy indeed of the traditions of St Bride\x{2019}s, and of
the great talents of my husband. In the end, no destiny could satisfy him but
this one, which he has always so ardently desired and which is now so
unexpectedly placed within his reach.\x{2019}


Nan was speaking slowly and precisely, making every word count. Once more the
tremor had gone from her voice. She was masterly. She paused for breath.


Quite quietly Rain rose to her feet. She turned towards Demoyte as if to speak
to him, but did not. She turned about, gathering up her evening-bag, and went
soft-footed out of the room. Everyone shifted uneasily, stared at her as she
departed, and then looked back to Nan, puzzled but still spell-bound. The
candles were burning low.


Nan prolonged her pause. From the comer of his eye Mor could see her figure
relax. She threw her page of notes down on the table. She began to say, \x{2018}But
you will have heard enough now of my personal hopes and fears - it remains for
me to conclude my remarks by - Her voice became inaudible to Mor. He half rose
from his seat, and then slumped back again, helpless. He became aware that
everyone in the room was looking at him. He thought at first it must be because
of Rain\x{2019}s departure, but then realized that it was because of Nan\x{2019}s speech. He
knew he ought to follow Rain out \x{2014} but again he could not. The scene held him
prisoner, his wife\x{2019}s presence and her words pinned him to his chair, his whole
previous life contained him like a strait-jacket. He turned to face Demoyte and
flinched away from the expression of blazing fury in the old man\x{2019}s eyes that
bid him get up and go. He could not.


Nan sat down amid applause, and an immediate buzz of excited talk. Everyone
knew that something odd was happening, nobody knew what it was. Curious stares
were directed at Mor. Sir Leopold was filling Nan\x{2019}s glass. She sat there with
her elbow on the table, her face hidden by her hand. Evvy was saying to Demoyte
that he hoped Miss Carter had not been taken ill, and oughtn\x{2019}t they - Demoyte
got up and left the room, slamming the door behind him. Mor closed his eyes.


Some ten or fifteen minutes passed during which Evvy made some rather lengthy
concluding remarks and the bottle circulated again. Then the company began to
rise to their feet to adjourn to the Common Room. Several people converged on
Mor, to make sympathetic remarks and offer good wishes. He walked with them through
the door into the Common Room. Then he excused himself and ran out into the
corridor.


He ran down the steps and out into the playground. It was an exceedingly dark
night, and apart from the blaze from the windows above him no lights were on in
the school. Only a lamp burning at the comer of School House lit up an expanse
of asphalt and gravel and the edges of the grass. He looked about. Where had
Rain gone to? Where could he find her now? He began to run down the drive. He
saw the Riley parked upon the grass verge. But there was no sign of Rain. He
called her name, cautiously at first and then more loudly. He turned and ran
back to the main buildings, hoping to see some trace of her or of Demoyte.
There was nobody. He ran up as far as the school gates. It was in vain. He came
back, panting with exhaustion, and fell down, hiding his face in the grass near
to the wheels of the car.",

waited beside the car for a long time. Now and then voices were to be heard and
footsteps on the gravel, but it was only the departing guests. No one came near
the Riley. At last he got up and searched for a while in the grounds, more or
less aimlessly. Then he ran to find his bicycle. It was not in the shed in the
masters\x{2019} garden. It must be at home. He began to run as fast as he could
towards his house. He wondered how long a time had passed. He could not judge.
Why had he let her go away? If only he had held her then, taking her
hand before the whole company, none of the forces which Nan had tried to drive
between them would have been of any avail.


As he came near his house he saw that there was a light on in Nan\x{2019}s room. She
had evidently returned. He forced his way through the gate, kicking it
violently open, and ran down the side way into the garden to find his bicycle.
As he dragged the machine towards the road he could hear the curtains being
drawn back. Light fell upon the path and on the flowers which he had kicked
aside. Nan was looking out. He paid no attention and did not look round. He mounted
the machine, bounced noisily off the pavement, and began to pedal as hard as he
could in the direction of Brayling\x{2019}s Close.


There was a light on in the hall of the Close and another in the drawing-room.
The bicycle came bucking across the gravel, and Mor dismounted it at speed. As
he ran the last few steps he saw that the front door was ajar. Demoyte was
standing in the hall. Their bodies came into violent collision. Demoyte seized
Mor by the shoulder in a grip that hurt. For a second he thought that the old
man was going to strike him. Mor wrenched himself free. The power which he had
lacked when he sat at the dinner table now flowed in him with such abundance
that he could have torn a wall down to reach Rain.


\x{2018}Where is she?\x{2019} he said to Demoyte.


\x{2018}I don\x{2019}t know!\x{2019} said Demoyte. He began to say something else, but Mor had
already turned and shot out of the door again. He seized the bicycle, which
seemed to have got entangled in a rose bush, shook it free, and began to pedal
back in the direction of the school. He moaned aloud now, partly with
breathlessness and partly with the agony of suspense. For he still did not know
what had happened.


The bicycle came hurtling down the drive. The Riley was still there. Mor braked
violently and dismounted beside the car. What could he do now? Where could he
look? It was impossible to find her, yet impossible too to endure her
disappearance. It came to him that this was the first time for many weeks that
he had not known where Rain was. He threw the bicycle on the grass verge and
began to walk towards the playground. She might still be here, somewhere inside
the school. The lamp had been extinguished at the comer of School House and the
drive was in total darkness. Hours had passed. It must now be <<well after
midnight|13>>. Everyone would have gone home. Yet perhaps she was still here. The
Riley had not gone. She must be somewhere here.


He walked into the playground and looked about him. All was dark. Except for
one light. Looking up, Mor saw that a light was still burning in the masters\x{2019}
dining-room. They were probably clearing up the remains of the dinner. But at
that hour? He stood looking at the light. Then he began to run towards the door
of the building, his feet clattering on the asphalt and his footsteps echoing
from the dark fa\x{e7}ades. The main door was unlocked. He mounted the stairs two at
a time and blundered into the Common Room which was in darkness. He switched
the lights on, sprang across the room, and threw open the door of the
dining-room.


A bright electric bulb now lit the room, which looked exceedingly strange. The
remnants of the feast had been removed. It seemed at first as if there was no
one there. Then Mor saw Rain. She was high above his head. She had found a very
tall step ladder and had set it up, standing it upon the tiles of the
fireplace. She was sitting now upon the very top, level with the portrait which
still hung in its place high aloft above the mantelshelf. She was applying
paint to the canvas. She held the enormous palette upon her left hand and her
lap was full of paints. Paint marks of all colours streaked her white
evening-dress which fell in a great fan about her, hanging down over the side
of the ladder. As the door opened she did not look round but continued
carefully with what she was doing. She was working on the head.


\x{2018}Rain!\x{2019} said Mor. He ran to the foot of the ladder and shook it violently as if
he wanted to hurl her to the ground.


She steadied herself, and then turned back to the picture. He saw that as she
worked the tears were streaming slowly down her face, steadily one after the
other.


\x{2018}Rain!\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}that was not true. It was simply a trick of Nan\x{2019}s. Surely
you weren\x{2019}t taken in?\x{2019}


\x{2018}It is true,\x{2019} said Rain, in a dull voice. \x{2018}I asked Mr Demoyte.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, it was an idea I had once,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}but Nan misrepresented the whole
thing. And we never discussed it or agreed anything like she said. You can\x{2019}t
possibly have believed that!\x{2019}


\x{2018}It doesn\x{2019}t matter,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}it\x{2019}s what you want to do.\x{2019} She was still
staring through her falling tears at the picture.


\x{2018}That isn\x{2019}t so,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I swear it isn\x{2019}t so! I\x{2019}d quite given up any plans
of that kind.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes, said Rain, \x{2019}because of me.\x{2018} She took the brush away and turned to look
down at him. Her small feet were neatly together upon a high step of the
ladder, the toes of her shoes just visible under the white dress. Mor reached
up to touch her.


\x{2018}No, no,\x{2019} said Mor. Holding her feet he leaned his head against the ladder. How
could he convince her?


\x{2018}Look,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}this makes no difference at all. Why should it? I ought to
have told you long ago, only I didn\x{2019}t want to complicate things. If I\x{2019}d told
you myself you wouldn\x{2019}t have made this into a difficulty, would you? You\x{2019}re
just upset because it came from Nan. Well, don\x{2019}t be such a fool. I love you,
and nothing else is of any importance. This other thing is empty in comparison,
it\x{2019}s nothing. I love you, I should perish without you. Will you
understand that?\x{2019} He spoke savagely, trying to force the ideas into her mind.


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t, you\x{2019}re hurting my leg,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}I do understand. I had just not
realized that I was wrecking your whole life. I see it all quite differently
now. I see your children, I see your ambitions. You love me, yes. But you
wouldn\x{2019}t really forgive me for having deprived you of so much. And I would not
forgive myself for doing so.\x{2019} She spoke in a monotonous slightly whining voice,
and her tears were very slow but ceaseless.


\x{2018}No, no, no, it\x{2019}s not like that!\x{2019} cried Mor. How could he bear it, that Nan had
bewitched her so? She saw it all exactly as Nan had intended. How could she be
so stupid? \x{2018}No!\x{2019} he cried. \x{2018}I shall not let you do this thing to both of us!\x{2019}


\x{2018}It\x{2019}s useless, Mor,\x{2019} said Rain. \x{2018}What am I doing in your life? I\x{2019}ve often
wondered this, you know, only I never told my doubts. You are a growing tree. I
am only a bird. You cannot break your roots and fly away with me. Where could
we go where you wouldn\x{2019}t always be wanting the deep things that belong to you,
your children, and this work which you know is your work? I know how I would
feel if I were prevented from pointing. I should die if I were prevented from
painting. I should die. For a moment she shook with sobs and the ladder
trembled under her.


\x{2018}I love you, Rain,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}what else can I say? I haven\x{2019}t cared for these
other things at all since I\x{2019}ve known you. I shall never be an M.P. now,
whatever happens. I no longer want this. I want you. Don\x{2019}t kill me, Rain. He
leaned against the ladder, embracing the lower steps.


\x{2018}You would be happy with me for a short while,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}but then what would
happen? It\x{2019}s all dry sand running through the fingers. I can wander about the
world and where-ever I go I can paint. If we were together my work would
continue. But what about yours? Would it in the end satisfy you just to be with
me? Would you be able to write and to go on writing? If you had really wanted
to write as much as I want to paint you would have written by now, you would
have found the time somehow, nothing would have stopped you.


\x{2018}I could write,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}or I could start a school. I\x{2019}m not an idiot. I\x{2019}ve
thought of these things too. I could make my life with you. What sort of life
do you think I have now, or would have even if I were an M.P.? You\x{2019}ve made me
exist for the first time. I began to be when I loved you, I saw the world for
the first time, the beautiful world full of things and animals that I\x{2019}d never
seen before. What do you think will hop-pen to me if you leave me now? Don\x{2019}t
abandon me. Don\x{2019}t do such a wicked thing. Don\x{2019}t!\x{2019}


He reached up his hand towards her. She leaned forward and took it in a strong
grip. They paused for a moment, pressing each other\x{2019}s hands. But all the
comfort was gone out of the contact. They both knew it and felt despair. Rain
withdrew her hand.


\x{2018}Rain, do you love me?\x{2019} said Mor. He stood squarely at the foot of the ladder
gazing up at her. \x{2018}If you\x{2019}ve just changed your mind about me, say it, and don\x{2019}t
wrap it up in this torturing way.\x{2019}


\x{2018}I love you,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}I do love you, I do. But what does that mean?
Perhaps, after all, it has all been because of-father.\x{2019} She laid the palette
down on her lap and rubbed her face violently with both hands. Patches of red
and blue paint appeared on her cheeks and forehead.


Oh, for Christ\x{2019}s sake,\x{2018} said Mor, \x{2019}don\x{2019}t give me that. I shall not allow you to
leave me, Rain, I shall just not allow it. Nothing has happened tonight which
can alter anything between us. Don\x{2019}t be tricked by my wife. Don\x{2019}t look anywhere
but to me.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Oh, Mor, Mor,\x{2019} said Rain, her voice wailing, \x{2018}if you only knew how I do look to
you! I\x{2019}ve got nobody but you at all. But now I can see. I see that it was you
that tricked me - and I too that deceived myself. I saw it all so simply, with
nothing to it but you leaving your wife whom you didn\x{2019}t love and who didn\x{2019}t
love you. But a life has so much more in it than that. I had not seen that I
would break so many many things.\x{2019}


\x{2018}If you love me \x{2014} \x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}That word cannot guide us any more.\x{2019} She spoke wearily, with finality.


\x{2018}Make it all right,\x{2019} said Moor. \x{2018}Sweep away what has happened tonight, do not
remember it.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Oh, my dear,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}my dear \x{2014} \x{2019} She turned her eyes, red and hazy with
tears, towards the face in the picture which was level with her own.


\x{2018}Make it all right,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Oh, my dear -\x{2019} said Rain.


It was the final negative. Mor stepped away from the foot of the ladder. He
stood silent for a moment. The pain in his heart was almost beyond bearing.
Then he said, \x{2018}I accept nothing of what you say. We shall speak of this again.\x{2019}


Rain said nothing. She took up the palette and began to mix some paint, but
could not see for her tears.


Mor took two steps towards the door. He said, \x{2018}You should stop that now, and go
to bed. You\x{2019}re far too upset to paint. Shall I fetch your car and bring it
round into the playground?\x{2019}


Rain shook her head violently. It was a moment before she could speak. \x{2018}No,\x{2019}
she said, \x{2018}I must finish this. I want to repaint the head. I see what to do
now. I must go on working. Don\x{2019}t wait up.\x{2019}


Mor hesitated. He had a terrible feeling that if he left her now he might never
see her again. But he had to see her again. They would speak tomorrow. He would
force her to agree with him. It could not be otherwise.


\x{2018}We are both too overwrought,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}We will speak of this again tomorrow.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes, yes,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}please go. I must work now. Please go.\x{2019}


Mor got as far as the door. He stood watching her. She had begun to paint
again, dashing the tears from her eyes.


Rain,\x{2018} he said.


She did not answer.


\x{2018}Tomorrow,\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Rain, \x{2018}yes.\x{2019}


She went on painting. Mor stayed for a minute or two watching her, and then he
went out and closed the door behind him.",

            "WHEN
Mor awoke it was cold. He turned in bed and W looked towards the window. A very
white dim light. It was early morning. No need to get up yet. Then as he turned
again to settle down, the memory of last night spread through his mind like a
crack. He sat up in bed and held his hand to his face as if to prevent great
cries from issuing forth. He must see Rain very soon, immediately after
breakfast, sooner. Last night she had been mad. If he had been less drunk
himself he would have realized it and would have left her alone at once. He
looked at his watch. <<Ten to six|10a:1>>. He lay back on the pillow. There were still
hours to wait. Then he found out that he could not stay in bed. He was in too
great an agony. He began to get up and to dress, stumbling about searching for
his clothes. He had a violent headache.


When he was dressed, he wondered what to do. It occurred to him that Rain might
have been painting all night and might still be there in the masters\x{2019}
dining-room. But on reflection this seemed very unlikely. He sat for a while on
the edge of his bed. The time was now <<five past six|10>>. He swung his legs and lit
a cigarette. The time opened in front of him like an appalling steam-filled
abyss. How could he wait so long? He walked about the room, keeping his
footsteps silent. He began to think about his wife.


Then a thought came to him, a thought which he had had last night, but which
had been overwhelmed by the violence of the events. He crept downstairs,
carrying his shoes with him, and went into the dining-room, where his
writing-desk was. He opened the drawer of the desk where he had hidden the two
draft letters which he had written, the one to Nan and the other to Tim Burke,
announcing his intentions. The letters were there, but Mor could see at once
that they had been moved from their original place. He stood for some time in a
melancholy daze looking into the drawer. Nan must have found them. That
explained the desperation which had driven her to make such a dramatic
sacrifice of her own wishes.


Mor closed the drawer and sat down on one of the chairs beside the dining-room
table. The house was cold and very silent with the death-like abandoned silence
of the early morning. He felt sick in his whole body as if ripped by
innumerable wounds. He sat for a few minutes listening for a sound, but there
was nothing to be heard. Then he decided he must go out into the road. He crept
into the hall. At the front door he put his shoes on, donned an overcoat, and
went out, closing the door quietly.


He began to walk along the pavement. The morning was exceedingly still and
pale. He was reminded of the day of Nan\x{2019}s return when he had come out into this
appalling morning air, and such a feeling of catastrophe overwhelmed him that
he had to bite his hands. Today there was no rain, but the sky was pure white,
covered over absolutely with an even sheet of cloud. When he reached the main
road he wondered what to do. A car went by, desolate and portentous upon the
empty road. He decided that he would go to Brayling s Close and wait outside
until they were stirring. If he did not at least come near to where Rain was he
would fall down faint at the pains that were eating his heart.


He remembered that his bicycle was in the school. In his agitation of last
night he had left it there, and had come home on foot. He walked through the
school gates, his feet crunching loudly on the damp gravel in the midst of the empty
gardens. He found his bicycle lying on the grass where he had thrown it. The
Riley was gone. He wheeled the machine as far as the entrance to the drive.
There was no point in making haste. No one would be up yet at the Close. He
might as well spin out the time between into some sort of motion and activity.
He began to wheel the machine up the hill, and then turned into one of the
suburban roads which led past his own house to the fields. He thought he would
go by way of the fields. He wanted to be in the open and in that kinder
solitude to collect himself.


As he came down the road he saw a figure approaching him. It seemed familiar.
Then as it came nearer he saw that it was the gipsy whom he and Rain had first
seen in the wood, and who had come to shelter under his porch with such strange
results. Mor felt an immediate thrill of fear at seeing the man. The gipsy was
walking on the opposite pavement with a slow loping stride, and carrying on his
shoulder a bundle wrapped in a sheet. He was making for the main road. Mor
thought at once: he is going. The man did not look across at him, though he
could hardly have been unaware of the appearance in so empty a scene of another
human figure. Mor wondered about him, wondering if he was right in thinking
that he was deaf. The man passed, and disappeared from view, turning to the
left into the main road. Mor walked on pushing his bicycle.


He passed his own house. Then suddenly a sense of great urgency came over him.
Why had he been dawdling like this? He must hurry. How could he have endured to
delay? Why had he ever left Rain at all on the previous night? He was by now at
the beginning of the path across the fields. He jumped on to his bicycle and
began pedalling vigorously along the path; and as he rode the blanched coldness
of the morning was becoming softer, and a slight almost imperceptible glow was
spread through the air, to show that behind the thick expanse of cloud the sun
was rising higher.


Demoyte\x{2019}s house, as Mor saw it from the fields, looked dead, surrounded still
by silence and sleep. He turned sharply where the path came up to the wall, and
rode along the narrower track beside it until he could turn into the drive. He
dropped his machine near the gate, and walked forward on to the circle of grass
which lay before the front door. The curtains were pulled in Demoyte\x{2019}s bedroom.
Their faded colourless lining closed the window like a dead eye-lid. Mor stood
for a while looking up. Then he went forward and tried the front door. It was
locked. He looked at his watch again. It was only <<six-thirty|9f>>. Rain must be
sleeping. She would surely want to sleep late after her exertions of last
night. If he could have got into the house he would have lain down outside her
door.


He began to walk round to the garden at the side of the house. He wanted to
look up at her window. The lawn was covered with a glistening sheet of dew in
which his steps left clear footprints behind. He walked silently across the
lawn, looking up at the corner window. Here too the curtains were still drawn.
The house was asleep. He must wait. Now that he was so near to her he felt more
tranquil. All would yet be well. He would make it so. The strength which all
along he had lacked was in him at last, as if he had been touched by a wand and
made invincible. He stood there, and his gaze wandered into the sky where a
rift had appeared in the clouds and a streak of very pale blue was to be seen.
A sharp breeze was blowing. He drew his overcoat more closely about him. He
would have liked to lie down on the grass, only the dew was too thick.


Several minutes passed. To warm himself a little he turned to walk a few steps
along the lawn, his chilled hands thrust deep into his pockets. Then his eye
was caught by a movement in the house. He looked up and saw that in one of the
library windows Miss Handforth was standing and watching him. She stood very
erect and motionless. It seemed to Mor that she must have been there a long
time. She seemed like an apparition. He stopped and looked up at her. He hardly
expected that there could be any communication between them, so far away did
she seem. So they looked at each other for a moment without any sign.


Then Miss Handforth undid the window and pushed up the sash. In a loud clear
voice, without leaning out, she said, \x{2018}She is gone.\x{2019}


Mor looked down at the grass, at the dew, and at the marks in the dew of his
own footsteps. With bent head he began to walk very slowly back towards the
front door. When he reached the door he found it open and came into the hall.
Miss Handforth was standing on the stairs.


\x{2018}Is Mr Demoyte up yet?\x{2019} Mor asked.


\x{2018}He\x{2019}s in the library,\x{2019} she said, and came down the stairs and disappeared in
the direction of the kitchen.


Mor mounted the stairs very slowly. It seemed an effort to lift each foot. He
opened the library door, and saw Demoyte sitting at the round table near the
window. He was in his dressing-gown. The curtains were all pulled well back and
the morning light filled the room, warmer now, turning to a weak sunshine.


Mor took a chair and sat down on the opposite side of the table. He did not
look at Demoyte. There was silence for a moment.


\x{2018}Oh, you fool, you fool, you fool,\x{2019} said Demoyte in a tired voice.


Mor said nothing. He leaned his elbows on the table and began rubbing his eyes
and passing his two hands over his brow.


\x{2018}What happened?\x{2019} said Mor at last.


\x{2018}Nothing happened,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}She went on painting for two or three hours
after you left her. Then she came back here and packed all her things, and went
away in the car.


Mor turned towards Demoyte. The old man looked ashy grey with his sleepless
night. Behind him near the wall Mor saw a square of colour. It was the
portrait, which stood on the floor, ropped against one of the bookcases. Mor
did not let himself look at it. \x{2018}Is she coming back?\x{2019} he asked Demoyte.


\x{2018}No, of course not,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}She said she was going straight to France,
but not to her own house. Then probably to America.\x{2019}


Mor nodded slowly. He was looking down again, at the floor between his two
feet. One foot tapped rhythmically without his will.


\x{2018}When did she go?\x{2019} he asked.


\x{2018}About two hours ago,\x{2019} said Demoyte. He turned suddenly on Mor, and his anger
shook him so that he had to hold on to the table. \x{2018}Why did you leave her? Why
did you leave her for a single moment? You must have willed to lose her!\x{2019}


Mor did not look up. He could feel the table trembling between them. \x{2018}It was
inevitable,\x{2019} he said dully.


\x{2018}Coward and fool!\x{2019} said Demoyte. Nothing was inevitable here. You have made
your own future.\x{2018}


Mor put his head down upon the table for a moment. He raised it to say, \x{2018}Will
we see her \x{2014} again?\x{2019} His voice did not have the cadence of a question.


\x{2018}Do not deceive yourself,\x{2019} said Demoyte. \x{2018}I shall never see her again. You may
meet her once more by accident in ten years time at a party when you are fat
and bald and she is married. Would you like some coffee? I\x{2019}ll get Handy to make
us some.\x{2019} He rang the bell.


\x{2018}Did she leave any message for me?\x{2019} Mor asked.


\x{2018}She left something,\x{2019} said Demoyte. He got up and went to the desk at the far
window. \x{2018}Here it is.\x{2019}


He brought a large plain envelope and put it into Mor\x{2019}s hand. The envelope was
unsealed. In an agony of apprehension and insane hope Mor drew out its
contents. It was a sketch. He saw at once what it was. It was the sketch which
she had made of him on the first evening when he had come and found her
painting, and had sat with her and Demoyte, the evening when she had begun to
fall in love with him. She had never remembered to show him the sketch. He
looked at it now. She had said that it might have betrayed that she was
beginning to love him. He saw upon the paper a young man with a strong twisted
humorous face and curly hair, head thrown back in a rather proud attitude, a
thick pillar of neck, a hand raised as if in dispute. It bore some resemblance
to himself. He laid the sketch down on the table. Nothing was written upon it.


\x{2018}Was this all?\x{2019} he asked Demoyte.


\x{2018}Yes.\x{2019}


Miss Handforth knocked and came in. She had interpreted the bell and carried a
tray with black coffee and a bottle of brandy. She laid it down between them
and went away without a word.


Mor mixed some brandy with the black coffee and drank it. He turned now to look
at the portrait. He got up and walked across the room to study it more closely.
Demoyte followed him. They looked at it a while in silence. Rain had changed
the head a great deal. At first sight it seemed as if she had spoilt it. The
fine sensitive lines which had built up the quiet musing expression which Mor
had liked so much had been covered over with layer after layer of tiny patches
of paint. The head stood out now solider, uglier, the expression no longer
conveyed by the fine details, but seeming to emerge from the deep structure of
the face. Mor was not sure whether he liked it better. He turned away. They
both went back to sit at the table.


\x{2018}Well,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}we\x{2019}ve each of us received a picture of ourselves.\x{2019} He
poured out some more coffee.


\x{2018}I suppose I ought to go back,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}Nan will be wondering where I am.\x{2019}
He said this without thought, automatically. towards him. \x{2018}You


Demoyte pushed the bottle of brandy towards him. \x{2018}You will take on the
candidature, of course?\x{2019} he said.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}I will do that now. Nan won\x{2019}t resist it any more. She\x{2019}ll
abide by what she said last night\x{2019}


\x{2018}If you drop this plan,\x{2019} said Demoyte, \x{2018}if you let her cheat you out of that
too, I\x{2019}ll never receive you in this house again. Never. I mean that.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Don\x{2019}t worry, sir,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I shall go ahead. I shall go ahead now.\x{2019} He
drank some more brandy. He got up to go. He found that he still had his coat on
with the collar turned up.


Demoyte rose. \x{2018}Aren\x{2019}t you going to take this?\x{2019} He indicated the sketch which
still lay on the table.


\x{2018}No,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}you keep it for me. I should like it to be kept here.\x{2019} He
turned away from it.


He got as far as the door. \x{2018}By the way, sir,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}could I ask one thing?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Demoyte.


\x{2018}You remember you offered to help us to send Felicity to college if it were
necessary? Does the offer still stand?\x{2019}


\x{2018}Of course,\x{2019} said Demoyte.


\x{2018}Thank you,\x{2019} said Mor. \x{2018}I may be glad to accept it. Perhaps I could discuss
this with you later.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Do as you like,\x{2019} said Demoyte. Good-bye.\x{2018}


\x{2018}Good-bye,\x{2019} said Mor. He felt a desire to say \x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry,\x{2019} but kept silent,
lingering at the door.


\x{2018}Come and see me in a few days,\x{2019} said Demoyte.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor. He left the room. The last he saw of Demoyte, the old man was
leaning on the edge of the table, looking gloomily towards the portrait.


Mor went out of the front door and found his bicycle. The sun was shining now,
pale yellow, through a white haze. A steady stream of traffic was passing both
ways along the main road. Mor decided to return home by the road and not by the
fields. He got on to his machine and began to pedal slowly towards the hill. He
felt extreme weariness. His headache had not left him. There was a buzzing in
his ears and the brandy which he had drunk seemed to make his limbs weighty.
The wind was against him.


As he neared the foot of the hill, pedalling with his head down, he heard
through the noise of the traffic a strange cry. He looked up. Then he saw
Felicity, who was coming flying down the hill on her bicycle, across on the
other carriage way. She had seen him and was calling out. She came whirling
towards him, dismounted at a high speed, and hurled herself and the bicycle
across the grass which divided the two sections of the road. Mor came rapidly
in towards the centre to meet her, and rode his bicycle on to the grass. As she
came up to him, tumbling off her machine, Felicity called out something which
at first Mor understood as \x{2018}Rain\x{2019}s come back!\x{2019} Then he realized that what
Felicity must have said was \x{2018}Don\x{2019}s come back!\x{2019} They met with an impact,
cannoning into each other, their bicycles colliding.


\x{2018}Oh, Daddy,\x{2019} cried Felicity, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m so glad I found you!\x{2019} She clung on to him.


\x{2018}Did you say Don had come back?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}at least he\x{2019}s not actually back yet. He came very late
last night to Tim Burke\x{2019}s house, and Tim rang up about half an hour ago to say
that he was going to bring Don over on his motor bike. He says Don is quite all
right. They ought to be arriving any moment now. We might see them on the way.\x{2019}


\x{2018}Well, thank God for that,\x{2019} said Mor. He picked up Felicity\x{2019}s bicycle and his
own, and they got back on to the road and began to push their machines up the
hill. Felicity still clung on to his arm.


\x{2018}How did you know where to look for me?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}I saw you go out,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}and then I saw you go by again towards the
fields. So I thought you might be down at Mr Demoyte\x{2019}s house.\x{2019}


Mor was silent. Arm in arm they plodded up the hill.


\x{2018}Daddy,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}will you be an M.P. now?\x{2019}


\x{2018}I suppose so, darling,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}if I get elected.\x{2019} He put his hand into
hers.


\x{2018}Will we move to London?\x{2019} said Felicity.


\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{201c}we\x{2019}ll move to London.\x{2018}


\x{2018}I\x{2019}m so glad,\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}I shall like that. I\x{2019}m tired of living here.
Daddy \x{2014} \x{2019}


\x{2018}Yes?\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Need I go on that secretarial course?\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}I wasn\x{2019}t sure before, but
now I think I\x{2019}d much rather stay at school for the present.\x{2019}


\x{2018}You shall stay at school then,\x{2019} said Mor, \x{2018}and later on perhaps you\x{2019}ll go to a
university.\x{2019}


Daddy,\x{2018} said Felicity, \x{2019}don\x{2019}t be too cross with Don.\x{2018}


\x{2018}I won\x{2019}t be cross with him,\x{2019} said Mor.


\x{2018}Do you think Don could work with Tim Burke now?\x{2019} said Felicity. \x{2018}He\x{2019}d much
rather do that than chemistry, only he was always afraid to tell you. He\x{2019}s
missed his silly exam anyway.\x{2019}


We\x{2019}ll see about that, darling,\x{2018} said Mor. \x{2019}Perhaps it may be the best thing.
But we\x{2019}ll see.\x{2018}


They were nearly at the top of the hill.


\x{2018}Daddy,\x{2019} said Felicity, \x{2018}when we go to London do you think we could have
another dog?\x{2019}


Mor was very near to tears. Not the tears that he cried, as Rain had told him,
inside his eyes, but visible tears that would stream down and wet his cheeks.
\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}I expect we might have a dog when we go to London, if you\x{2019}d
like that.\x{2019}


They had reached the top of the hill. They mounted their bicycles and began to
free-wheel down the other side towards Mor\x{2019}s house. The tears came to him now,
coursing down his cheeks and blown away by the wind. He put one hand to his
eyes. By the time he had reached his own front gate they were no longer
flowing.


Nan was standing at the door. Mor leaned his bicycle against the fence and came
up the path, followed by Felicity. He looked at Nan. He felt that his shoulders
were bowed. She looked at him. She looked very tired and like an old woman.
Before they could exchange any words a sound was heard which Mor recognized. It
was the note of Tim Burke\x{2019}s Velocette. They all three turned back to the road.


Tim Burke appeared round the corner, riding very slowly now. Donald was sitting
behind him on the pillion, his arms clasped round Tim\x{2019}s waist. The machine
stopped outside the house and the two riders dismounted. Donald was still
dressed in the flannels and gym shoes which he had worn on the day of the
climb. He was also wearing an old mackintosh. His face was pale and withdrawn.
Tim held him by the shoulder and turned towards the group at the gate. He
seemed as nervous about his own reception as about Donald\x{2019}s. He said in a
defiant voice, \x{2018}The prodigal\x{2019}s return!\x{2019}


\x{2018}Come inside,\x{2019} said Mor. He led the way into the house. Donald followed
directly after him, pushed forward by Tim Burke. They all crowded into the
hall. Mor turned to Donald. The boy looked at him, raising his eyebrows in a
half humorous half desperate appeal. Mor embraced him, holding him fast for a
minute in his arms. Then he said, \x{2018}I expect you\x{2019}re dead tired.\x{2019}


Felicity was hugging him now and Nan was kissing him on the cheek. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m
exhausted,\x{2019} said Donald. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m afraid I gave Tim an awful night too. We\x{2019}ve
hardly slept\x{2019}


\x{2018}You\x{2019}d better go straight to bed,\x{2019} said Nan. \x{2018}Your clothes look as if they\x{2019}re
sticking to your body. Off with you now, and I\x{2019}ll bring you up some hot coffee
and an egg in bed.\x{2019}


Donald began to mount the stairs. Mor followed after him and went with him into
his bedroom. The door closed behind them.


Nan went into the kitchen. She nodded to Tim Burke to come with her. She put
the kettle on the stove, and a saucepan to boil the egg. She lit the gas. Then
she looked towards Tim Burke. He was sitting beside the table in an attitude of
dejection. He would not meet her eye.


Felicity was sitting by herself on the stairs, half-way up. From the kitchen
she could hear the noise of crockery and of the hissing gas. From up above she
could hear the quiet sound of voices as Mor and Donald were talking in the
bedroom. Everything was all right now. Why was it then that she was starting to
cry? She fumbled in her clothes until she found a handkerchief. Her eyes were
filled with tears and soon they were streaming down her face. She gave a little
sob into her handkerchief. Everything was all right now. It was all right. It
was all right.
