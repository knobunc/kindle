         a garbled lullaby. Roaming farther afield, he was crossing the end of the now-empty
         cafeteria when he heard sounds coming from a storage room close to the corridor that
         led to the science division. Almost everyone had left, and he\x{2019}d planned to leave soon
         himself, but the sounds distracted him. Who was in there? The elusive janitor, he
         hoped. The horrible cleaning product needed to be switched out. He was convinced it
