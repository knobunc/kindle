            'Johnny took four steps backward and looked at the corner of the goal where he would be aiming. Then he focused on the back of the soccerball, running forward and striking it with his instep, trying to impart as much topspin and curl as he could manage. The ball cleared the wall. It looked as though it would keep rising and end up over the crossbar too, but at the very last second it dipped and bent, striking the top of the post and carrying on into the net. It was <<two-one|5b>>, with less than five minutes to go.',

Your friendly neighborhood hacker, Johnny M.\x{201d} Then he set to work correcting the equations, adding several new ones and improving the design. He hoped that some of the Australian\x{2019}s theories could be adapted for use in the fleet of spacefighters Earth would need in the battle to come. At the very end of the document, where the professor gave detailed specifications for the Project Sirius shuttles (highly maneuverable smaller craft attached to the exterior of the command vehicle), Johnny inserted a design that he hoped would be suitable. It was a cross between the professor\x{2019}s shuttles and his own Starfighter, which was simply too advanced to be copied directly. Louise looked over his shoulder as he added the finishing touches.",

Here there was no obvious sign of Krun activity, but as Johnny watched the youth of Australia having fun he heard the deep voice of the Krun Queen, screaming at him to kill them and bring her a feast.",

Imperial civil servants scurried in all directions, a mixture of different aliens, including stick-like Phasmeers, four-winged Hapchicks, the blue and orange fur-skinned Felixians and cube-like Teningurds. Nearby, the Great Tower of Themissa pointed proudly upward into the atmosphere, far taller than any eye could see, its blue light shining brighter than Johnny had ever witnessed before. The buildings along the sides of the courtyard, white stone bathed in the red glow, had once been Johnny\x{2019}s home for several months and seeing them since had always made him smile, but no longer.",
