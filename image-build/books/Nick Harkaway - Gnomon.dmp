            "In a private villa at Elounda, as part of this healing process, I commission a foam party. My shark picture is projected on to the walls and I arrange for a special Kyriakos cocktail with blue Cura\x{e7}ao and shark fin ice cubes. There is a six-foot ice-luge in the shape of a nude male diver, suitably heroic but still recognisably me, reaching down like God in Michelangelo\x{2019}s painting to bless the shark. Branded vodka is poured into the back of the statue\x{2019}s scuba tank and flows freely from his partly engorged penis. I also fly in a group of adventurous art students from Camberwell and pay them to paint the same tableau across the naked abdomens of five Crazy Horse girls. At <<midnight|13>>, two artists and a dancer persuade me to take off my clothes \x{2013} thank God I\x{2019}ve been on a fitness jag so my body is muscular beneath a layer of fat, and I can tell myself I look titanic rather than obese \x{2013} and they shave me from neck to ankle right there on the leather sofa and wash me in Cristal. At which point the whole night really kicks off, and it\x{2019}s a carnage of oral sex and orifices and everyone has a great time. I personally get laid on top of the ice luge, roaring and thrusting as my balls brush the melting ice and my arsehole gets very cold, but my partner is totally into it. She\x{2019}s screaming and yessing as if she\x{2019}s never had an orgasm before, and that makes me feel pretty fantastic.",

            "The Chamber, as described, is perfectly circular in plan, and domed. It is written that the supplicant enters from below to see the smiling face of the goddess drawn upon the ceiling in a tracery of silver against a <<midnight|13>> mosaic of lapis lazuli. Into this dome are set diamonds in the pattern of the constellations. Around the walls are the images of the four cardinal souls: two men, a woman and a fourth which might be either, and they are scattered across history. Along with the Goddess, they are the bridge between the divine world and the temporal one, and all of them, even her, are concealed in the shadow of the Pentemychos, itself concealed, so that this is the most invisible of pantheons. The divine Mother touches the other four with spirit, and they in turn give her: matter to be shaped as earth; the flow of time without which there is no life; harmony, lest the making unravel itself; and death, so that no one thing shall overrun the others. Here, in this place, angels can be birthed, demons shattered, and miracles made like loaves of bread for market. With the right knowledge, an alchemist working within the Chamber might produce an elixir to offset age and return youth to one who drinks it; transform sickness into abundance; heal any injury and even raise the dead; but the greatest gift of the Chamber is the eternal Alkahest, the Universal Solvent that will free any prisoner and dissolve not only all solid matter but also oaths, curses, kingdoms, years and centuries, even damnation itself. In a very real sense, the Alkahest is the power of God. Armed with it, one might undo the first sin and make the world a new heaven, pull down the sky, or seal the abyss forever and preserve What Is from What Is To Come. The Alkahest is the ink in which Isis writes the book of destiny. It is the tears that fell from the Virgin\x{2019}s eyes on the day of the Crucifixion.",

Screaming glass is transcendent, the lamentation of lovers frozen in different fragments and now tumbling apart.
