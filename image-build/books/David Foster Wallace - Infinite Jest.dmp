            "Not for nothing did Orin say that people outdoors down here just scuttle in vectors
         from air conditioning to air conditioning. The sun is a hammer. I can feel one side
         of my face start to cook. The blue sky is glossy and fat with heat, a few thin cirri
         sheared to blown strands like hair at the rims. The traffic is nothing like Boston.
         The stretcher is the special type, with restraining straps at the extremities. The
         same Aubrey deLint I\x{2019}d dismissed for years as a 2-D martinet knelt gurneyside to squeeze
         my restrained hand and say \x{2018}Just hang in there, Buckaroo,\x{2019} before moving back into
         the administrative fray at the ambulance\x{2019}s doors. It is a special ambulance, dispatched
         from I\x{2019}d rather not dwell on where, with not only paramedics but some kind of psychiatric
         M.D. on board. The medics lift gently and are handy with straps. The M.D., his back
         up against the ambulance\x{2019}s side, has both hands up in dispassionate mediation between
         the Deans and C.T., who keeps stabbing skyward with his cellular\x{2019}s antenna as if it
         were a sabre, outraged that I\x{2019}m being needlessly ambulanced off to some Emergency
         Room against my will and interests. The issue whether the damaged even have interested
         wills is shallowly hashed out as some sort of ultra-mach fighter too high overhead
         to hear slices the sky from south to north. The M.D. has both hands up and is patting
         the air to signify dispassion. He has a big blue jaw. At the only other emergency
         room I have ever been in, almost exactly one year back, the psychiatric stretcher
         was wheeled in and then parked beside the waiting-room chairs. These chairs were molded
         orange plastic; three of them down the row were occupied by different people all of
         whom were holding empty prescription bottles and perspiring freely. This would have
         been bad enough, but in the end chair, right up next to the strap-secured head of
         my stretcher, was a T-shirted woman with barnwood skin and a trucker\x{2019}s cap and a bad
         starboard list who began to tell me, lying there restrained and immobile, about how
         she had seemingly overnight suffered a sudden and anomalous gigantism in her right
         breast, which she referred to as a titty; she had an almost parodic Qu\x{e9}becois accent
         and described the \x{2018}titty\x{2019}s\x{2019} presenting history and possible diagnoses for almost twenty
         minutes before I was rolled away. The jet\x{2019}s movement and trail seem incisionish, as
         if white meat behind the blue were exposed and widening in the wake of the blade.
         I once saw the word KNIFE finger-written on the steamed mirror of a nonpublic bathroom. I have become an infantophile.
         I am forced to roll my closed eyes either up or to the side to keep the red cave from
         bursting into flames from the sunlight. The street\x{2019}s passing traffic is constant and
         seems to go \x{2018}Hush, hush, hush.\x{2019} The sun, if your fluttering eye catches it even slightly,
         gives you the blue and red floaters a flashbulb gives you. \x{2018}Why not? Why not? Why not not, then, if the best reasoning you can contrive is why not?\x{2019} C.T.\x{2019}s voice, receding
         with outrage. Only the gallant stabs of his antenna are now visible, just inside my
         sight\x{2019}s right frame. I will be conveyed to an Emergency Room of some kind, where I
         will be detained as long as I do not respond to questions, and then, when I do respond
         to questions, I will be sedated; so it will be inversion of standard travel, the ambulance
         and ER: I\x{2019}ll make the journey first, then depart. I think very briefly of the late
         Cosgrove Watt. I think of the hypophalangial Grief-Therapist. I think of the Moms,
         alphabetizing cans of soup in the cabinet over the microwave. Of Himself\x{2019}s umbrella
         hung by its handle from the edge of the mail table just inside the Headmaster\x{2019}s House\x{2019}s
         foyer. The bad ankle hasn\x{2019}t ached once this whole year. I think of John N. R. Wayne,
         who would have won this year\x{2019}s WhataBurger, standing watch in a mask as Donald Gately
         and I dig up my father\x{2019}s head. There\x{2019}s very little doubt that Wayne would have won.
         And Venus Williams owns a ranch outside Green Valley; she may well attend the 18\x{2019}s
         Boys\x{2019} and Girls\x{2019} finals. I will be out in plenty of time for tomorrow\x{2019}s semi; I trust
         Uncle Charles. Tonight\x{2019}s winner is almost sure to be Dymphna, sixteen but with a birthday
         two weeks under the 15 April deadline; and Dymphna will still be tired tomorrow at
         <<0830|9o>>, while I, sedated, will have slept like a graven image. I have never before faced
         Dymphna in tournament play, nor played with the sonic balls the blind require, but
         I watched him barely dispatch Petropolis Kahn in the Round of 16, and I know he is

         trusts you, the younger and more generally clueless the little kids in your charge.
         Charles Tavis instituted the practice and calls it the Big Buddy System in the literature
         he sends new kids\x{2019} parents. So the parents can feel their kid\x{2019}s not getting lost in
         the institutional shuffle. Beak, Blott, and Arslanian are all in Hal\x{2019}s Big Buddy group
         for Y.D.A.U. He also in effect has Ingersoll, having traded Todd (\x{2018}Postal-Weight\x{2019})
         Possalthwaite to Axford off the books for Ingersoll, because Trevor Axford found he
         so despised the Ingersoll kid for some unanalyzable reason that he was struggling
         against a horrible compulsion to put Ingersoll\x{2019}s little fingers into the gap by the
         hinges of an open door and then very slowly close the door, and came to Hal almost
         in tears, Axford had. Though technically Ingersoll is still Axford\x{2019}s and Possalthwaite
         Hal\x{2019}s. Possalthwaite, the great lobber, has a weird young-old face and little wet
         lips that lapse into a sucking reflex under stress. In theory, a Big Buddy\x{2019}s somewhere
         between an R.A. and a prorector. He\x{2019}s there to answer questions, ease bumpy transitions,
         show ropes, act as liaison with Tony Nwangi and Tex Watson and the other prorectors
         specializing in little kids. Be somebody they can come to off the record. A shoulder
         to climb up on a footstool and cry on. If a 16-and-Under gets made a Big Buddy it\x{2019}s
         kind of an honor; it means they think you\x{2019}re going places. When there\x{2019}s no tournament
         or travel, etc., Big Buddies get together with their quar-to-sextet in small-group
         private twice a week, in the interval between P.M. challenge matches and dinner, usually after saunas and showers and a few minutes
         of sitting slumped around the locker room sucking air. Sometimes Hal sits with his
         Little Buddies at dinner and eats with them. Not often, however. The savvier Big Buddies
         don\x{2019}t get too overly close with their L.B. ephebes, don\x{2019}t let them forget about the
         unbridgeable gaps of experience and ability and general status that separate ephebes
         from upperclassmen who\x{2019}ve hung in and stuck it out at E.T.A. for years and years.
         Gives them more to look up to. The savvy Big Buddy doesn\x{2019}t rush in or tread heavy;
         he holds his own ground and lets the suppliants realize when they need his help and
         come to him. You have to know when to tread in and take an active hand and when to
         hang back and let the littler kids learn from the personal experience they\x{2019}ll have
         to learn from, inevitably, if they want to be able to hang. Every year, the biggest
         source of attrition, besides graduating 18s, is 13\x{2013}15s who\x{2019}ve had enough and just
         can\x{2019}t hang. This happens; the administration accepts it; not everyone\x{2019}s cut out for
         what\x{2019}s required of you here. Though C.T. makes his administrative assistant Lateral
         Alice Moore drive the prorectors bats trying to ferret out data on littler kids\x{2019} psychic
         states, so he can forecast probable burnouts and attritive defections, so he\x{2019}ll know
         how many slots he and Admissions\x{2019}ll have to offer Incomings for the next term. Big
         Buddies are in a tricky position, requested to keep the prorectors generally informed
         about who among their charges seems shaky in terms of resolve, capacity for suffering
         and stress, physical punishment, homesickness, deep fatigue, but at the same time

      In mid-October Y.D.A.U., Hal had invited Mario for a post-prandial stroll, and they
         were strolling the E.T.A. grounds between the West Courts and the hillside\x{2019}s tree-line,

         ensemble off the path, and let Hal sort of melt away down the path. The whole area
         running along the tree-line and the thickets of like shrubbery and stickery bushes
         and heaven knew what all was covered with fallen leaves that were dry but had not
         yet quite all the way lost their color. The leaves were underfoot. Mario kind of tottered

         but the only thing left of the sunset was a snout just over Newton, and the places

         a Weber Grill. The U.S.S. Millicent Kent was leading them in a set of slightly diminishing
         circles. Then, she said, at age eight she came home early from after-school drills
         at the U.S.T.A. Jr. Facility in Passaic NJ looking forward to slipping into the old
         leotard and getting in some modern interpretive dancing up in her room, only to come
         home suddenly and find her father wearing her leotard. Which needless to say didn\x{2019}t
         fit very well. And with the small front portion of his huge bare feet squeezed into
         a pair of strapless pumps Mrs. Kent had left behind in her haste. In the dining room
         he\x{2019}d moved all the furniture over to the side of, in front of the really wide mirror,

         the U.S.S. Millicent\x{2019}s color. She says that was the exact creepy word for it: capering. Pirouetting and rondelling. Simpering, as well. The crotch of her leotard looked
         like a slingshot, it was so deformed. He hadn\x{2019}t heard her come in. U.S.S. Millicent
         asked Mario if he\x{2019}d ever seen a girl\x{2019}s yin-yang before. Obscene mottled hirsute flesh
         had pooched and spilled out over every centimeter of the leotard\x{2019}s perimeter, she
         recalled. She\x{2019}d had a voluptuous figure even at <<eight|9c:1>>, she told Mario, but the Old
         Man was in a whole different-sized ballpark altogether. Mario kept saying Golly Ned,
         all he could think of to say. His flesh jiggled and bounced as he capered. It was
         repellent, she said. There was no sign of a Husky VI or any other model of tripod
         in any of the thickets and boscages. Her literal term for it was \x{2018}yin-yang.\x{2019} But her
         Old Man wasn\x{2019}t just a cross-dressing transvestite, she said; it turned out they always
         had to be a relative\x{2019}s female clothes. She said she always used to wonder why her sisters\x{2019} one-pieces and
         figure-skating skirts always looked so askewly baggy and elastic-shot, since the sisters
         didn\x{2019}t exactly wear tiny little malnourished sizes themselves. The Old Man didn\x{2019}t
         hear her come in and he capered and jet\x{e9}ed for several more minutes until she happened
         to catch his simpering eye in the mirror, she said. That\x{2019}s when she knew she had to
         get away, she said. And Mario\x{2019}s own old man\x{2019}s Admissions lady had called out of the

         alone to roll but a older type individual who any body could see is no studn but is
         legless on shots alone at the bar fucking shatered slumped over is getting ready to
         depart for green pastures and Poor Tony tells Lolasister to screw she crews with Poor
         Tony some times but not if its\x{2019} wet work and with Cs\x{2019} involvement its\x{2019} always wet
         work, and yrstruly I inform Susan T. Cheese she new better than not to screw as well
         and the older individual de parts shatered and holding onto walls in a hiclass and
         promising coat for the possibility of \$ and pernts his old nose this way and that
         and everything like that thru the Bow&Arrow window C wipes the steam off, and has
         a conversession with a Santaclaus ringing a big bell for the kettle and were\x{2019} like
         Jesus its\x{2019} a never ending strugle to wait and cop but after awhile finally after stifing
         the Santaclaus we watch he picks a direction finally at last up Mass Ave toward the
         Central Squar on foot, and Poor Tony beats it around the block to get up in front
         of him around the block on the ice in his fucking heels and feather snake around his
         neck and gets him some how Poor Tony always knows how over to the dumsters\x{2019} alley
         by Bay Bank off Sherman St, and yrstruly and C crew on the individual and roll him
         and C messes up his older map to a large degree and we leave him in no condition to
         eat cheese in a snow drift of materil under the dumster, and C again wants to siphon
         out a vehicle on Mass Av and set him on fire but he has 400 \$ on his person and then
         some and a coat with a fury collar and a watch we realy scored and C even gosofar
         to take the non studns\x{2019} shoes which they dont\x{2019} fit, and in the dumster they go.",

         up circumstances yrstruly and C almost end up raping a older type nurse in a white
         nurses\x{2019} uniform and coat on the train but we dont\x{2019} and but Poor Tony seems white and
         detracted on the train playng with his feather snake and says he says he seems in
         his mind maybe to recall an involvment in some type deal where Dr. Wo might of got
         slightly got over on and burnt and that maybe down in Chinatown we could air on the
         side of low profiles and try to cop some where else except from the Wos\x{2019}. Except Dr.
         Wo is who we know. C is Wos\x{2019} former aquaintance from crewing with slopes on the North
         shore for Whity Sorkin in the days of his youth. C is not 2Bdenied. And so at the
         Orangeline Tstop we grab a fat cab to about two blocks from Hung Toys and screw out
         of the cab at a light and the thing with fat cabbies is they cant\x{2019} run after you and
         Poor Tony is pisser to watch tearassing it down the street in hiheels with a feather
         stoal. Poor Tony runs right by the front of Hung Toys, this is by pryor agreement
         to wait for us low profile down the street and yrstruly and C go in Hung Toys where
         they dont\x{2019} open till <<2300|9c:0>> and sell tea unquot like 100 Proof tea till all hours and everything like that and never get Inspected
         because Dr. Wo has arrangements with Chinatowns\x{2019} Finest. XMas is noncelebrated in
         Chinatown. Dr. Wo a good thing about Wo is hes\x{2019} always there in Hung Toys at known
         times. Here theres\x{2019} all old slope racial type ladies sitting in booths eating noddles
         and drinking quot tea out of white cups the size of a shotglass and everything like
         that. With small slope kids tearassing it all over and older men in like jew caps
         and skinny beerds out of just the middle of there chin but Dr. Wo is only middle aged
         and wears iron glasses and a tie and looks more like a banker for a slope but he is
         100 % business and icecold all the way down for slope type comerce plus hes\x{2019} connected
         bigtime and not to be fucked or got over on if some body has a head left and yrstruly
         I cant\x{2019} believe Poor Tony would ever take part of tryng to crew on Wo who he knows
         thru C in even the smallest comerce and if he did C says he sure never heard about
         it nor saw any of the skeet or anything like that, and why. Cs\x{2019} the one that knows
         Wo. We arranged Poor Tony to wait for us out side and try to be low profile. Its\x{2019}
         sub 0 snow and hes\x{2019} in a leather spring coat and stoal and brown wig thats\x{2019} not as
         good as a hat and hell\x{2019} freeze his low profile balls off and C was tryng to smile
         and he told Dr. Wo we needed three bundles and Dr. Wo was smiling in his slope manner
         said the boosting life must surely be exellent and C laughed and said most exellent Cs\x{2019} tight with slopes he does the talking and everything like that, and
         he says were\x{2019} going to lay up low profile for the XMas vacation and not crew because
         I had a rape type situation from an older nurse last nite on the T and almost got
         pinched by the Ts\x{2019} Finest and Dr. Wo nods in a special subservant manner he uses for
         non slopes who hes\x{2019} realy polite with but hes\x{2019} a dictater to his slopes when we see
         him with his subservant slopes but with us were\x{2019} allike most polite and everything
         like conversession and its\x{2019} nice but expensive but it feels nice at the time but Wo
         finishes his so called tea and Wo goes back behind the curtains in the back of Hung Toys thats\x{2019} a giant brightred
         curtain with purple mountains or hills and clouds that are flyng snakes with leather
         wings that is one curtain yrstruly would want to boost for personnel hanging use that
         no body that isnt\x{2019} a slope and isnt\x{2019} in with Wo cant\x{2019} never go behind it but you can
         see when he opens it and goes behind the curtain it looks like merly more old slope
         ladies sitting on packing cases with slope writing eating more noddles in bowls they
         hold about like a millmeter from their yellow maps and everything like that. Slopes
         rarly stop shovling in the old noddles. Stokely Darkstar calls them maggoteaters and
         subservant slopes keep going in and out of the curtain while Wos\x{2019} back there a longer
         than avrege time and Cs\x{2019} got the Shivers and starting to jones and dope-fiends are
         full of super station and he says to yrstruly he says the fuck he says maybe what
         if Poor Tony realy did take part with burning Wo and what if a slope sees Poor Tony
         out side and is one of these slopes going in and out of the curtain maybe telling
         Wo, like ratting out Poor Tony as our aquaintance, and my mucis is starting and were\x{2019}
         jonesing super statiously over PT and wheres\x{2019} Wo behind the curtain and everything
         like that, tryng to smile and conversession ultralow, drinking quot tea thats\x{2019} like
         schnapps only wurse and green. And we jones and Dr. Wo comes back finally at last
         out smiling subservantly with all the wonderful skeet three bundles in a newspaper
         who could fucking read it but the pictures are of slope VIPs\x{2019} in suits and Wo sits
         down, and Wo never sits down at the booth with the skeet it isnt\x{2019} done in his comerce,
         and Wos\x{2019} hands are folded over our skeet in the thing and Wo smiling says he asks
         C if weve\x{2019} seen goodold Poor Tony or Susan T. Cheese around we crew with Poor Tony
         in boosting life did we not he said. C he says PT is a fucking dicksucking fag queer
         and a proven cheeseater and wed\x{2019} fucked up his map and Cheese and Lolasisters\x{2019} map
         in a beef and didnt\x{2019} crew with fags since aprox the autum period. C is pouring mucis
         and tryng to smile cusually, Dr. Wo laughed in a harty fashion and said exellent and
         Wo leaned over our skeet sayng if we should happenbychance to see Poor Tony or them
         to please give Poor Tony his quite best regards and wish him prosparity and a thousand
         blisses. And everything like that. And we promote the newspaper of skeet and Wo promotes our
         \$ and very politely outwego and I admit it yrstruly wanted we should burn Poor Tony
         and rickytick the fuck out of Chinatown but we go over down more by the China Pearl
         Place and Poor Tony is sortof hunched behind a lightpoal with his gray teeth chatting
         in his dress and thin coat tryng to be low profile in his red coat and heels around
         a million+ slopes that all are subservants of Wo. And later after screwing out we
         didnt\x{2019} tell him of what Wo said about sitting down and asking about him and Cheeses\x{2019}
         blisses and we screw to the Orangeline to our hot air blowergrate we use at nite at the library
         behind the Copley Squar and we get our personnel works out from behind the brickworks
         behind the bush by the hot blowergrate where we stash our works and were\x{2019} eggerly
         into the first bundle and were\x{2019} cooking up and notice Poor Tony doesnt\x{2019} the least
         bitch when yrstruly and C tie off first in line seeing as were\x{2019} the ones that copped
         it and Poor Tonys\x{2019} gotto wait as usal, except I notice he doesnt\x{2019} bitch even a little,
         normally Poor Tony keeps up this usal wine yrstruly learned how to not notice, but
         when he doesnt\x{2019} wine now that were\x{2019} jonesing and the skeets\x{2019} right there I notice
         hes\x{2019} cusually looking like every place but at the skeet which is unusal and C jonesing
         and with the Shivers cooking up tryng to keep his lighter lit in the hot airs\x{2019} wind
         and snow of nite, and I admit it yrstruly I get a wicked cold inside feeling even
         with all this hot air from the blowergrate blowing up from under us and making our
         hair blow around and Tonys\x{2019} feather snake pernt upword I yrstruly get a cold feeling
         of super station once more, you get wicked super stations in this fucked up kindof
         shit life because its\x{2019} a never ending chase and you get too tired to go by much more
         than never ending habit and super station and everything like that so but I dont\x{2019}
         say any thing but yrstruly I have a cold super station about Poor Tony not wining
         while he makes like he has to cusually piss and takes a piss and the piss steams up
         around the lower ares of the bush with his back turned away and isnt\x{2019} looking around
         with interst or anything like that you never turn your back on the skeet when its\x{2019}
         partly your skeet which is wicked unusal which C is so eggerly dopesick he doesnt\x{2019}
         notice any thing past keeping the lighter lit. And so I admit it I yrstruly did yrstruly
         purplously let C tie off and boot up first while I still cooked up, I did cook up
         unusally slow, fucking with the getting the snowmelt hot in the spoon and everything
         like that yrstruly I let the lighter go out and took more time with the cotton and
         C had the Shivers wurst of us and cooks up the fastest and would of got it anyway.
         Later with Cs\x{2019} map elemonaded Poor Tony later conceited admitting Susan T. Cheese
         helped a Worcester fag get over on Wo for a fronted bundle in autum is why. And all
         three bundles Wo give us in slope news was Hotshots. Laced. It started the instantly
         C undid the belt and booted up we knew allready, yrstruly I and PT thearized it was
         Drano with the blue like glittershit and everything like that taken out by subservant
         slopes it had that Drano like effect on C and everything like that it was laced what
         ever it was C started with the screaming in a loud hipitch fashion instantly after
         he unties and boots and downhegoes flopping with his heels pouning on the metal of
         the blowergrate and hes\x{2019} at his throat with his hands tearing at him self in the most
         fucked up fashions and Poor Tony is hiheeling rickytick over over C zipping up sayng
         he screams sweety C but and stuffing the feather snake from his necks\x{2019} head in Cs\x{2019}
         mouth to shut him up from hipitch screaming in case Bostons\x{2019} Finest can hear involvment
         and blood and bloody materil is coming out Cs\x{2019} mouth and Cs\x{2019} nose and its\x{2019} allover
         the feathers its\x{2019} a sure sign of Drano, blood is and Cs\x{2019} eyes get beesly and bulge
         and hes\x{2019} cryng blood into the feathers in his mouth and tryng to hold onto my glove
         but Cs\x{2019} arms are going allover and one eye it like allofa sudden pops outof his map,
         like with a Pop you make with fingers in your mouth with all this blood and materil
         and a blue string at the back of the eye and the eye falls over the side of Cs\x{2019} map
         and hangs there looking at the fag Poor Tony. And C turned lightblue and bit thru
         the snakes\x{2019} head and died for keeps and shit his pants instanly with shit so bad the
         hot air blowergrate is blowing small bits of fart and blood and missty shit up into
         our maps and Poor Tony backs offof over C and puts his hands over his madeup map and
         looks at C thru his fingers. And yrstruly I take the belt off it goes without saying,
         and dont\x{2019} even rethink or dream about tryng maybe a diffrent bag out of a diffrent
         bundle from C for how could Wo know what bundle wed\x{2019} cook up outof first so all three
         bundles must be Hot so I dont\x{2019} even dream even tho yrstrulys\x{2019} Shiverng and mucis sick
         allready and now in payback Wo has our only \$ to get straight with for XMas. It might
         sound fucking low but the reason we had to leave the decesed body C in one of the
         librarys\x{2019} dumsters is the reason is because the Copley Squars\x{2019} Finest know it is our
         personnel hot air blowergrate and if we leave C there its\x{2019} a sure pinch for us as
         known aquaintance and a period of Kicking The Bird in holding in a cell but the dumster
         was empty of materil and Cs\x{2019} head made a fucked up sound when it hit the empty bottom
         and Poor Tony cried and wined and said he said he had no inkling that beast Wo was
         that vindicative and poorold decesed C and how this was it hes\x{2019} going to get clean
         from heronout and get a straightjob dancing in a Patty type Club in the Fenway and
         everything like that on and on piss and wine. I didnt\x{2019} say any thing. I had to rethink
         on the T to the Squar if yrstruly I should elemonade Poor Tonys\x{2019} map for keeps for
         payback on how he purplously lets C shoot up first and wouldof\x{2019} let yrstruly shoot
         first even knowing, or make that cheese move and go back down the Orangeline to Wo
         and try and get enough bags to get true straight eating cheese to Wo about the wherehouse
         that Poor Tony and Susan T. Cheese and Lolasister with Eckwus crashed at now. Or like
         what. Yrstruly I almost was cryng. It was when Poor Tony took off his hiheels and wanted
         yrstruly I should boost him like over the edge of Cs\x{2019} bodies\x{2019} dumster to get back
         what was left of his feather stoal out of Cs\x{2019} mouth that yrstruly I thought I decided
         what to do. But the connected slope Wo wasnt\x{2019} even there in front of the Hung Toys
         curtain in the early XMas AM, and then Poor Tony departed for green pastures and ate
         cheese, and it took yrstruly two days of Kicking The Bird in the hall out side my
         Mumsters\x{2019} apartment that for payback she locked the door before I yrstruly can get
         in a Detox to atleast cop some methedoan and get three squars to stay down in yrstruly
         to start to thearize on what to try and do after I could standup straight and walk

         lad. Here\x{2019}s to a spiderless section of communal garage. Ah. Bodies bodies everywhere.
         A tennis ball is the ultimate body, kid. We\x{2019}re coming to the crux of what I have to
         try to impart to you before we get out there and start actuating this fearsome potential
         of yours. Jim, a tennis ball is the ultimate body. Perfectly round. Even distribution
         of mass. But empty inside, utterly, a vacuum. Susceptible to whim, spin, to force\x{2014}used
         well or poorly. It will reflect your own character. Characterless itself. Pure potential.
         Have a look at a ball. Get a ball from the cheap green plastic laundry basket of old
         used balls I keep there by the propane torches and use to practice the occasional
         serve, Jimbo. Attaboy. Now look at the ball. Heft it. Feel the weight. Here, I\x{2019}ll\x{2026}
         tear the ball\x{2026} open. Whew. See? Nothing in there but evacuated air that smells like
         a kind of rubber hell. Empty. Pure potential. Notice I tore it open along the seam.
         It\x{2019}s a body. You\x{2019}ll learn to treat it with consideration, son, some might say a kind
         of love, and it will open for you, do your bidding, be at your beck and soft lover\x{2019}s
         call. The thing truly great players with hale bodies who overshadow all others have
         is a way with the ball that\x{2019}s called, and keep in mind the garage door and broiler,
         touch. Touch the ball. Now that\x{2019}s\x{2026} that\x{2019}s the touch of a player right there. And as with
         the ball so with that big thin slumped overtall body, sir Jimbo. I\x{2019}m predicting it
         right now. I see the way you\x{2019}ll apply the lessons of today to yourself as a physical
         body. No more carrying your head at the level of your chest under round slumped shoulders.
         No more tripping up. No more overshot reaches, shattered plates, tilted lampshades,
         slumped shoulders and caved-in chest, the simplest objects twisting and resistant
         in your big thin hands, boy. Imagine what it feels like to be this ball, Jim. Total
         physicality. No revving head. Complete presence. Absolute potential, sitting there
         potentially absolute in your big pale slender girlish hand so young its thumb\x{2019}s unwrinkled
         at the joint. My thumb\x{2019}s wrinkled at the joint, Jim, some might say gnarled. Have
         a look at this thumb right here. But I still treat it as my own. I give it its due.
         You want a drink of this, son? I think you\x{2019}re ready for a drink of this. No? Nein?
         Today, Lesson One out there, you become, for better or worse, Jim, a man. A player.
         A body in commerce with bodies. A helmsman at your own vessel\x{2019}s tiller. A machine
         in the ghost, to quote a phrase. Ah. A ten-year-old freakishly tall bow-tied and thick-spectacled
         citizen of the\x{2026}. I drink this, sometimes, when I\x{2019}m not actively working, to help me
         accept the same painful things it\x{2019}s now time for me to tell you, son. Jim. Are you
         ready? I\x{2019}m telling you this now because you have to know what I\x{2019}m about to tell you
         if you\x{2019}re going to be the more than near-great top-level tennis player I know you\x{2019}re
         going to be eventually very soon. Brace yourself. Son, get ready. It\x{2019}s glo\x{2026} gloriously
         painful. Have just maybe a taste, here. This flask is silver. Treat it with due care.
         Feel its shape. The near-soft feel of the warm silver and the calfskin sheath that
         covers only half its flat rounded silver length. An object that rewards a considered
         touch. Feel the slippery heat? That\x{2019}s the oil from my fingers. My oil, Jim, from my
         body. Not my hand, son, feel the flask. Heft it. Get to know it. It\x{2019}s an object. A
         vessel. It\x{2019}s a two-pint flask full of amber liquid. Actually more like half full,
         it seems. So it seems. This flask has been treated with due care. It\x{2019}s never been
         dropped or jostled or crammed. It\x{2019}s never had an errant drop, not drop one, spilled out of it. I treat it as if it can feel. I give it its due, as a body. Unscrew
         the cap. Hold the calfskin sheath in your right hand and use your good left hand to
         feel the cap\x{2019}s shape and ease it around on the threads. Son\x{2026} son, you\x{2019}ll have to put
         that what is that that Columbia Guide to Refractive Indices Second Edition down, son. Looks heavy anyway. A tendon-strainer. Fuck up your pronator teres and
         surrounding tendons before you even start. You\x{2019}re going to have to put down the book,
         for once, young Sir Jimbo, you never try to handle two objects at the same time without
         just aeons of diligent practice and care, a Brando-like dis\x{2026} and well no you don\x{2019}t just drop the book, son, you don\x{2019}t just just don\x{2019}t drop the big old Guide to Indices on the dusty garage floor so it raises a square bloom of dust and gets our nice white
         athletic socks all gray before we even hit the court, boy, Jesus I just took five minutes explaining how the key to being even a potential player
         is to treat the things with just exactly the\x{2026} here lemme have this\x{2026} that books aren\x{2019}t
         just dropped with a crash like bottles in the trashcan they\x{2019}re placed, guided, with senses on Full, feeling the edges, the pressure on the little floor
         of both hands\x{2019} fingers as you bend at the knees with the book, the slight gassy shove
         as the air on the dusty floor\x{2026} as the floor\x{2019}s air gets displaced in a soft square
         that raises no dust. Like soooo. Not like so. Got me? Got it? Well now don\x{2019}t be that way. Son, don\x{2019}t be that way, now. Don\x{2019}t get
         all oversensitive on me, son, when all I\x{2019}m trying to do is help you. Son, Jim, I hate this when you do this. Your chin just disappears into that bow-tie when your big
         old overhung lower lip quivers like that. You look chinless, son, and big-lipped.
         And that cape of mucus that\x{2019}s coming down on your upper lip, the way it shines, don\x{2019}t,
         just don\x{2019}t, it\x{2019}s revolting, son, you don\x{2019}t want to revolt people, you have to learn
         to control this sort of oversensitivity to hard truths, this sort of thing, take and
         exert some goddamn control is the whole point of what I\x{2019}m taking this whole entire morning off rehearsal with
         not one but two vitally urgent auditions looming down my neck so I can show you, planning
         to let you move the seat back and touch the shift and maybe even\x{2026} maybe even drive
         the Montclair, God knows your feet\x{2019}ll reach, right Jimbo? Jim, hey, why not drive
         the Montclair? Why not you drive us over, starting today, pull up by the courts where
         today you\x{2019}ll\x{2014}here, look, see how I unscrew it? the cap? with the soft very outermost
         tips of my gnarled fingers which I wish they were steadier but I\x{2019}m exerting control
         to control my anger at that chin and lip and the cape of snot and the way your eyes
         slant and goggle like some sort of mongoloid child\x{2019}s when you\x{2019}re threatening to cry
         but just the very tips of the fingers, here, the most sensitive parts, the parts bathed
         in warm oil, the whorled pads, I feel them singing with nerves and blood I let them
         extend\x{2026} further than the warm silver hip-flask\x{2019}s cap\x{2019}s very top down its broadening
         cone where to where the threads around the upraised little circular mouth lie hidden
         while with the other warm singing hand I gently grip the leather holster so I can
         feel the way the whole flask feels as I guide\x{2026} guide the cap around on its silver
         threads, hear that? stop that and listen, hear that? the sound of threads moving through
         well-machined grooves, with great care, a smooth barbershop spiral, my whole hand
         right through the pads of my fingertips less\x{2026} less unscrewing, here, than guiding,
         persuading, reminding the silver cap\x{2019}s body what it\x{2019}s built to do, machined to do,
         the silver cap knows, Jim, I know, you know, we\x{2019}ve been through this before, leave
         the book alone, boy, it\x{2019}s not going anywhere, so the silver cap leaves the flask\x{2019}s mouth\x{2019}s warm grooved
         lips with just a snick, hear that? that faintest snick? not a rasp or a grinding sound
         or harsh, not a harsh brutal Brando-esque rasp of attempted domination but a snick
         a\x{2026} nuance, there, ah, oh, like the once you\x{2019}ve heard it never mistakable ponk of a true-hit ball, Jim, well pick it up then if you\x{2019}re afraid of a little dust, Jim, pick the book up if it\x{2019}s going to make you all goggle-eyed and chinless honestly Jesus why do I try
         I try and try just wanted to introduce you to the broiler\x{2019}s garage and let you drive,
         maybe, feeling the Montclair\x{2019}s body, taking my time to let you pull up to the courts
         with the Montclair\x{2019}s shift in a neutral glide and the eight cylinders thrumming and
         snicking like a healthy heart and the wheels all perfectly flush with the curb and
         bring out my good old trusty laundry\x{2026} laundry basket of balls and racquets and towels
         and flask and my son, my flesh of my flesh, white slumped flesh of my flesh who wanted to embark on what
         I predict right now will be a tennis career that\x{2019}ll put his busted-up used-up old
         Dad back square in his little place, who wanted to maybe for once be a real boy and
         learn how to play and have fun and frolic and play around in the unrelieved sunshine
         this city\x{2019}s so fuck-all famous for, to enjoy it while he can because did your mother
         tell you we\x{2019}re moving? That we\x{2019}re moving back to California finally this spring? We\x{2019}re
         moving, son, I\x{2019}m harking one last attempted time to that celluloid siren\x{2019}s call, I\x{2019}m
         giving it the one last total shot a man\x{2019}s obligation to his last waning talent deserves,
         Jim, we\x{2019}re headed for the big time again at last for the first time since she announced
         she was having you, Jim, hitting the road, celluloid-bound, so say adios to that school
         and that fluttery little moth of a physics teacher and those slumped chinless slide-rule-wielding
         friends of no now wait I didn\x{2019}t mean it I meant I wanted to tell you now, ahead of time, your mother and I, to give you plenty of notice so you could adjust this time because oh you made it so unmisinterpretably clear how this last move to this trailer park upset you so, didn\x{2019}t you, to a mobile home
         with chemical toilet and bolts to hold it in place and widow-webs everyplace you look
         and grit settling on everything like dust out here instead of the Club\x{2019}s staff quarters
         I got us removed from or the house it was clearly my fault we couldn\x{2019}t afford anymore.
         It was my fault. I mean who else\x{2019}s fault would it be? Am I right? That we moved your
         big soft body with allegedly not enough notice and that east-side school you cried
         over and that Negro research resource librarian there with the hair out to here that\x{2026}
         that lady with the upturned nose on tiptoe all the time I have to tell you she seemed
         so consummate east-side Tucsonian all self-consciously not of this earth\x{2019}s grit urging
         us to quote nurture your optical knack with physics with her nose upturned so you
         could see up in there and on her toes like something skilled overhead had sunk a hook
         between her big splayed fingerling\x{2019}s nostrils and were reeling skyward up toward the
         aether little by little I\x{2019}ll bet those heelless pumps are off the floor altogether
         by now son what do you say son what do you think\x{2026} no, go on, cry, don\x{2019}t inhibit yourself,
         I won\x{2019}t say a word, except it\x{2019}s getting to me less all the time when you do it, I\x{2019}ll
         just warn you, I think you\x{2019}re overworking the tears and the\x{2026} it\x{2019}s getting less effec\x{2026}
         effective with me each time you use it though we know we both know don\x{2019}t we just between
         you and me we know it\x{2019}ll always work on your mother, won\x{2019}t it, never fail, she\x{2019}ll
         every time take and bend your big head down to her shoulder so it looks obscene, if
         you could see it, pat-patting on your back like she\x{2019}s burping some sort of slumping
         oversized obscene bow-tied infant with a book straining his pronator teres, crying,
         will you do this when you\x{2019}re grown? Will there be episodes like this when you\x{2019}re a
         man at your own tiller? A citizen of a world that won\x{2019}t go pat-pat-there-there? Will
         your face crumple and bulge like this when you\x{2019}re six-and-a-half grotesque feet tall,
         six-six-plus like your grandfather may he rot in hell\x{2019}s rubber vacuum when he finally
         kicks on the tenth tee and with your flat face and no chin just like him on that poor
         dumb patient woman\x{2019}s fragile wet snotty long-suffering shoulder did I tell you what
         he did? Did I tell you what he did? I was your age Jim here take the flask no give
         it here, oh. Oh. I was thirteen, and I\x{2019}d started to play well, seriously, I was twelve
         or thirteen and playing for years already and he\x{2019}d never been to watch, he\x{2019}d never
         come once to where I was playing, to watch, or even changed his big flat expression
         even once when I brought home a trophy I won trophies or a notice in the paper TUCSON
         NATIVE QUALIFIES FOR NATIONAL JR CH\x{2019}SHIPS he never acknowledged I even existed as
         I was, not as I do you, Jim, not as I take care to bend over backwards way, way out of my way to let you know I see you recognize you am aware of you as a body care about what might go on behind that
         big flat face bent over a homemade prism. He plays golf. Your grandfather. Your grandpappy.
         Golf. A golf man. Is my tone communicating the contempt? Billiards on a big table,
         Jim. A bodiless game of spasmodic flailing and flying sod. A quote unquote sport.
         Anal rage and checkered berets. This is almost empty. This is just about it, son.
         What say we rain-check this. What say I put the last of this out of its amber misery
         and we go in and tell her you\x{2019}re not feeling up to snuff enough again and we\x{2019}re rain-checking
         your first introduction to the Game till this weekend and we\x{2019}ll head over this weekend
         and do two straight days both days and give you a really extensive intensive intro
         to a by all appearances limitless future. Intensive gentleness and bodily care equals
         great tennis, Jim. We\x{2019}ll go both days and let you plunge right in and get wet all
         over. It\x{2019}s only five dollars. The court fee. For one lousy hour. Each day. Five dollars
         each day. Don\x{2019}t give it a thought. Ten total dollars for an intensive weekend when
         we live in a glorified trailer and have to share a garage with two DeSotos and what
         looks like a Model A on blocks and my Montclair can\x{2019}t afford the kind of oil she deserves.
         Don\x{2019}t look like that. What\x{2019}s money or my rehearsals for the celluloid auditions we\x{2019}re
         moving 700 miles for, auditions that may well comprise your old man\x{2019}s last shot at
         a life with any meaning at all, compared to my son? Right? Am I right? Come here, kid. C\x{2019}mere c\x{2019}mere c\x{2019}mere c\x{2019}mere. That\x{2019}s a boy. That\x{2019}s
         my J.O.I. of a guy of a joy of boy. That\x{2019}s my kid, in his body. He never came once,
         Jim. Not once. To watch. Mother never missed a competitive match, of course. Mother
         came to so many it ceased to mean anything that she came. She became part of the environment.
         Mothers are like that, as I\x{2019}m sure you\x{2019}re aware all too well, am I right? Right? Never
         came once, kiddo. Never lumbered over all slumped and soft and cast his big grotesque
         long-even-at-midday shadow at any court I performed on. Till one day he came, once.
         Suddenly, once, without precedent or warning, he\x{2026} came. Ah. Oh. I heard him coming
         long before he hove into view. He cast a long shadow, Jim. It was some minor local
         event. It was some early-round local thing of very little consequence in the larger
         scheme. I was playing some local dandy, the kind with fine equipment and creased white
         clothing and country-club lessons that still can\x{2019}t truly play, even, regardless of
         all the support. You\x{2019}ll find you often have to endure this type of opponent in the
         first couple rounds. This gleaming hapless lox of a kid was some client of my father\x{2019}s
         son\x{2026} son of one of his clients. So he came for the client, to put on some sham show
         of fatherly concern. He wore a hat and coat and tie at 95\x{b0} plus. The client. Can\x{2019}t
         recall the name. There was something canine about his face, I remember, that his kid
         across the net had inherited. My father wasn\x{2019}t even sweating. I grew up with the man
         in this town and never once saw him sweat, Jim. I remember he wore a boater and the
         sort of gregariously plaid uniform professional men had to wear on the weekends then.
         They sat in the indecisive shade of a scraggly palm, the sort of palm that\x{2019}s just
         crawling with black widows, in the fronds, that come down without warning, that hide
         lying in wait in the heat of <<midday|13>>. They sat on the blanket my mother always brought\x{2014}my
         mother, who\x{2019}s dead, and the client. My father stood apart, sometimes in the waving
         shade, sometimes not, smoking a long filter. Long filters had come into fashion. He
         never sat on the ground. Not in the American Southwest he didn\x{2019}t. There was a man
         with a healthy respect for spiders. And never on the ground under a palm. He knew he was too grotesquely tall and ungainly to stand
         up in a hurry or roll screaming out of the way in a hurry in case of falling spiders.
         They\x{2019}ve been known to be willing to drop right out of the trees they hide in, in the
         daytime, you know. Drop right on you if you\x{2019}re sitting on the ground in the shade.
         He was no fool, the bastard. A golfer. They all watched. I was right there on the
         first court. This park no longer exists, Jim. Cars are now parked on what used to
         be these rough green asphalt courts, shimmering in the heat. They were right there,
         watching, their heads going back and forth in that windshield-wiper way of people
         watching quality tennis. And was I nervous, young sir J.O.I.? With the one and only
         Himself there in all his wooden glory there, watching, half in and out of the light,
         expressionless? I was not. I was in my body. My body and I were one. My wood Wilson
         from my stack of wood Wilsons in their trapezoid presses was a sentient expression
         of my arm, and I felt it singing, and my hand, and they were alive, my well-armed
         hand was the secretary of my mind, lithe and responsive and senza errori, because I knew myself as a body and was fully inside my little child\x{2019}s body out there,
         Jim, I was in my big right arm and scarless legs, safely ensconced, running here and
         there, my head pounding like a heart, sweat purled on every limb, running like a veldt-creature,
         leaping, frolicking, striking with maximum economy and minimum effort, my eyes on
         the ball and the corners both, I was two, three, a couple shots ahead of both me and
         the hapless canine client\x{2019}s kid, handing the dandy his pampered ass. It was carnage.
         It was a scene out of nature in its rawest state, Jim. You should have been there.
         The kid kept bending over to get his breath. The smoothly economical frolicking I
         was doing contrasted starkly compared to the heavily jerky way he was being forced
         to stomp around and lunge. His white knit shirt and name-brand shorts were soaked
         through so you could see the straps of his jock biting into the soft ass I was handing
         him. He wore a flitty little white visor such as fifty-two-year-old women at country
         clubs and posh Southwestern resorts wear. I was, in a word, deft, considered, prescient.
         I made him stomp and stagger and lunge. I wanted to humiliate him. The client\x{2019}s long
         sharp face was sagging. My father had no face, it was sharply shadowed and then illuminated
         in the wagging fronds\x{2019} shadow he half stood in but was wreathed in smoke from the
         long filters he fancied, long plastic filtered holders, yellowed at the stem, in imitation
         of the President, as courtiers once spluttered with the King\x{2026} veiled in shade and
         then lit smoke. The client didn\x{2019}t know enough to keep quiet. He thought he was at
         a ball game or something. The client\x{2019}s voice carried. Our first court was right near
         the tree they sat under. The client\x{2019}s legs were out in front of them and protruded
         from the sharp star of frond-shade. His slacks were lattice-shadowed from the pattern
         of the fence his son and I played just behind. He was drinking the lemonade my mother
         had brought for me. She made it fresh. He said I was good. My father\x{2019}s client did.
         In that emphasized way that made his voice carry. You know, son? Good godfrey Incandenza
         old trout but that lad of yours is good. Unquote. I heard him say it as I ran and whacked and frolicked. And I heard the tall
         son of a bitch\x{2019}s reply, after a long pause during which the world\x{2019}s whole air hung
         there as if lifted and left to swing. Standing at the baseline, or walking back to
         the baseline, to either serve or receive, one of the two, I heard the client. His
         voice carried. And then later I heard my father\x{2019}s reply, may he rot in a green and
         empty hell. I heard what\x{2026} what he said in reply, sonbo. But not until after I\x{2019}d fallen.
         I insist on this point, Jim. Not until after I\x{2019}d started to fall. Jim, I\x{2019}d been in
         the middle of trying to run down a ball way out of mortal reach, a rare blind lucky
         dribbler of a drop-shot from the over-groomed lox across the net. A point I could
         have more than afforded to concede. But that\x{2019}s not the way I\x{2026} that\x{2019}s not the way a
         real player plays. With respect and due effort and care for every point. You want
         to be great, near-great, you give every ball everything. And then some. You concede
         nothing. Even against loxes. You play right up to your limit and then pass your limit
         and look back at your former limit and wave a hankie at it, embarking. You enter a
         trance. You feel the seams and edges of everything. The court becomes a\x{2026} an extremely
         unique place to be. It will do everything for you. It will let nothing escape your
         body. Objects move as they\x{2019}re made to, at the lightest easiest touch. You slip into
         the clear current of back and forth, making delicate X\x{2019}s and L\x{2019}s across the harsh
         rough bright green asphalt surface, your sweat the same temperature as your skin,
         playing with such ease and total mindless effortless effort and and and entranced
         concentration you don\x{2019}t even stop to consider whether to run down every ball. You\x{2019}re
         barely aware you\x{2019}re doing it. Your body\x{2019}s doing it for you and the court and Game\x{2019}s
         doing it for your body. You\x{2019}re barely involved. It\x{2019}s magic, boy. Nothing touches it,
         when it\x{2019}s right. I predict it. Facts and figures and curved glass and those elbow-straining
         books of yours\x{2019} lightless pages are going to seem flat by comparison. Static. Dead
         and white and flat. They don\x{2019}t begin to\x{2026}. It\x{2019}s like a dance, Jim. The point is I was
         too bodily respectful to slip up and fall on my own, out there. And the other point
         is I started to fall forward even before I started to hear him reply, standing there: Yes, But He\x{2019}ll Never Be Great. What he said in no way made me fall forward. The unlovely opponent had dribbled
         one just barely over the too-low public-park net, a freak accident, a mishit drop-shot,
         and another man on another court in another early-round laugher would have let it
         dribble, conceded the affordable, not tried to wave a hankie from the vessel of his
         limit. Not race on all eight healthy scarless cylinders desperately forward toward
         the net to try to catch the goddamn thing on the first bounce. Jim, but any man can
         slip. I don\x{2019}t know what I slipped on, son. There were spiders well-known to infest
         the palms\x{2019} fronds all along the courts\x{2019} fences. They come down at night on threads,
         bulbous, flexing. I\x{2019}m thinking it could have been a bulbous goo-filled widow I stepped
         and slipped on, Jim, a spider, a mad rogue spider come down on its thread into the
         shade, flabby and crawling, or that leapt suicidally right from an overhanging frond
         onto the court, probably making a slight flabby hideous sound when it landed, crawling
         around on its claws, blinking grotesquely in the hot light it hated, that I stepped
         on rushing forward and killed and slipped on the mess the big loathsome spider made.
         See these scars? All knotted and ragged, like something had torn at my own body\x{2019}s
         knees the way a slouching Brando would just rip a letter open with his teeth and let
         the envelope fall on the floor all wet and rent and torn? All the palms along the
         fence were sick, they had palm-rot, it was the A.D. year 1933, of the Great Bisbee Palm-Rot epidemic, all through the state, and they
         were losing their fronds and the fronds were blighted and the color of really old
         olives in those old slim jars at the very back of the refrigerator and exuded a sick
         sort of pus-like slippery discharge and sometimes abruptly fell from trees curving
         back and forth through the air like celluloid pirates\x{2019} paper swords. God I hate fronds,
         Jim. I\x{2019}m thinking it could have been either a daytime latrodectus or some pus from a frond. The wind blew cruddy pus from the webbed fronds onto the
         court, maybe, up near the net. Either way. Something poisonous or infected, at any
         rate, unexpected and slick. All it takes is a second, you\x{2019}re thinking, Jim: the body
         betrays you and down you go, on your knees, sliding on sandpaper court. Not so, son.
         I used to have another flask like this, smaller, a rather more cunning silver flask,
         in the glove compartment of my Montclair. Your devoted mother did something to it.
         The subject has never been mentioned between us. Not so. It was a foreign body, or a substance, not my body, and if anybody did any betraying that day I\x{2019}m
         telling you sonny kid boy it was something I did, Jimmer, I may well have betrayed that fine young lithe tan unslumped body, I
         may very well have gotten rigid, overconscious, careless of it, listening for what
         my father, who I respected, I respected that man, Jim, is what\x{2019}s sick, I knew he was there, I was conscious of his flat face
         and filter\x{2019}s long shadow, I knew him, Jim. Things were different when I was growing
         up, Jim. I hate\x{2026} Jesus I hate saying something like this, this things-were-different-when-I-was-a-lad-type
         clich\x{e9} shit, the sort of clich\x{e9} fathers back then spouted, assuming he said anything
         at all. But it was. Different. Our kids, my generation\x{2019}s kids, they\x{2026} now you, this
         post-Brando crowd, you new kids can\x{2019}t like us or dislike us or respect us or not as
         human beings, Jim. Your parents. No, wait, you don\x{2019}t have to pretend you disagree,
         don\x{2019}t, you don\x{2019}t have to say it, Jim. Because I know it. I could have predicted it,
         watching Brando and Dean and the rest, and I know it, so don\x{2019}t splutter. I blame no
         one your age, boyo. You see parents as kind or unkind or happy or miserable or drunk
         or sober or great or near-great or failed the way you see a table square or a Montclair
         lip-red. Kids today\x{2026} you kids today somehow don\x{2019}t know how to feel, much less love, to say nothing of respect. We\x{2019}re just bodies to you. We\x{2019}re just bodies
         and shoulders and scarred knees and big bellies and empty wallets and flasks to you.
         I\x{2019}m not saying something clich\x{e9} like you take us for granted so much as I\x{2019}m saying
         you cannot\x{2026} imagine our absence. We\x{2019}re so present it\x{2019}s ceased to mean. We\x{2019}re environmental.
         Furniture of the world. Jim, I could imagine that man\x{2019}s absence. Jim, I\x{2019}m telling
         you you cannot imagine my absence. It\x{2019}s my fault, Jim, home so much, limping around,
         ruined knees, overweight, under the Influence, burping, nonslim, sweat-soaked in that
         broiler of a trailer, burping, farting, frustrated, miserable, knocking lamps over,
         overshooting my reach. Afraid to give my last talent the one shot it demanded. Talent
         is its own expectation, Jim: you either live up to it or it waves a hankie, receding
         forever. Use it or lose it, he\x{2019}d say over the newspaper. I\x{2019}m\x{2026} I\x{2019}m just afraid of having
         a tombstone that says HERE LIES A PROMISING OLD MAN. It\x{2019}s\x{2026} potential may be worse
         than none, Jim. Than no talent to fritter in the first place, lying around guzzling
         because I haven\x{2019}t the balls to\x{2026} God I\x{2019}m I\x{2019}m so sorry. Jim. You don\x{2019}t deserve to see me like this. I\x{2019}m so scared, Jim. I\x{2019}m so scared of
         dying without ever being really seen. Can you understand? Are you enough of a big thin prematurely stooped young bespectacled
         man, even with your whole life still ahead of you, to understand? Can you see I was
         giving it all I had? That I was in there, out there in the heat, listening, webbed with nerves? A self that touches
         all edges, I remember she said. I felt it in a way I fear you and your generation
         never could, son. It was less like falling than being shot out of something, is the
         way I recall it. It did not did not happen in slow motion. One minute I was at a dead and beautiful forward run for the
         ball, the next minute there were hands at my back and nothing underfoot like a push
         down a stairway. A rude whip-lashing shove square in the back and my promising body
         with all its webs of nerves pulsing and firing was in full airborne flight and came
         down on my knees this flask is empty right down on my knees with all my weight and
         inertia on that scabrous hot sandpaper surface forced into what was an exact parody
         of an imitation of contemplative prayer, sliding forward. The flesh and then tissue
         and bone left twin tracks of brown red gray white like tire tracks of bodily gore
         extending from the service line to the net. I slid on my flaming knees, rushed past
         the dribbling ball and toward the net that ended my slide. Our slide. My racquet had
         gone pinwheeling off Jim and my racquetless arms out before me sliding Jim in the
         attitude of a mortified monk in total prayer. It was given me to hear my father pronounce
         my bodily existence as not even potentially great at the moment I ruined my knees
         forever, Jim, so that even years later at USC I never got to wave my hankie at anything
         beyond the near- and almost-great and would-have-been-great-if, and later could never even hope to audition for those swim-trunk and Brylcreem beach
         movies that snake Avalon is making his mint on. I do not insist that the judgment
         and punishing fall are\x{2026} were connected, Jim. Any man can slip out there. All it takes
         is a second of misplaced respect. Son, it was more than a father\x{2019}s voice, carrying.
         My mother cried out. It was a religious moment. I learned what it means to be a body,
         Jim, just meat wrapped in a sort of flimsy nylon stocking, son, as I fell kneeling
         and slid toward the stretched net, myself seen by me, frame by frame, torn open. I
         may have to burp, belch, son, son, telling you what I learned, son, my\x{2026} my love, too
         late, as I left my knees\x{2019} meat behind me, slid, ended in a posture of supplication
         on my knees\x{2019} disclosed bones with my fingers racquetless hooked through the mesh of
         the net, across which, the net, the sopped dandy had dropped his pricey gut-strung
         Davis racquet and was running toward me with his visor askew and his hands to his
         cheeks. My father and the client he was there to perform for dragged me upright to
         the palm\x{2019}s infected shade where she knelt on the plaid beach-blanket with her knuckles
         between her teeth, Jim, and I felt the religion of the physical that day, at not much
         more than your age, Jim, shoes filling with blood, held under the arms by two bodies
         big as yours and dragged off a public court with two extra lines. It\x{2019}s a pivotal,
         it\x{2019}s a seminal, religious day when you get to both hear and feel your destiny at the
         same moment, Jim. I got to notice what I\x{2019}m sure you\x{2019}ve noticed long ago, I know, I
         know you\x{2019}ve seen me brought home on occasions, dragged in the door, under what\x{2019}s called
         the Influence, son, helped in by cabbies at night, I\x{2019}ve seen your long shadow grotesquely
         backlit at the top of the house\x{2019}s stairs I helped pay for, boy: how the drunk and
         the maimed both are dragged forward out of the arena like a boneless Christ, one man
         under each arm, feet dragging, eyes on the aether.",

         suggests expansion without really expanding. It leads up to the exact kind of inevitability
         it denies. It is heavily digital, but with something of a choral bouquet. But unhuman.
         Mario thinks of the word haunting, like in \x{2018}a haunting echo of thus-and-such.\x{2019} Madame Psychosis\x{2019}s cued music\x{2014}which the
         student engineer never chooses or even sees her bring in\x{2014}is always terribly obscure

         house. Madame Psychosis\x{2019}s cued musics stir very early memories of Mario\x{2019}s father.

         Apeshit has rarely enjoyed so literal a denotation. At the sound of the first windowpane
         breaking and the sight of a blown-out old whore trying to hit a leather-vested biker

         pathetic front lawn, the methedrine addict began laughing so hard that she dropped
         the binoculars from the Ennet House upstairs fire escape where they were watching,
         at like <<0630h|1>>., and the binoculars fell and hit the roof of one of the Ennet House
         counselors\x{2019} cars right below in the little roadlet, with a ringing clunk, just as
         he was pulling in, the counselor, his name was Calvin Thrust and he was four years
         sober and a former NYC porn actor who\x{2019}d gone through the House himself and now took
         absolutely zero in terms of shit from any of the residents, and his pride and joy
         was his customized \x{2019}Vette, and the binoculars made rather a nasty dent, and plus they
         were the House Manager\x{2019}s amateur-ornithology binoculars and had been borrowed out
         of the back office without explicit permission, and the long fall and impact didn\x{2019}t
         do them a bit of good, to say the least, and Gately and the methedrine addict got
         pinched and put on Full House Restriction and very nearly kicked out. The addict from
         New Bedford picked up the aminating needle a couple weeks after that anyway and was
         discovered by a night staffer simultaneously playing air-guitar and polishing the
         lids of all the donated canned goods in the House pantry way after lights out, stark
         naked and sheened with meth-sweat, and after the formality of a Urine she was given

         her neck and a thoroughly eliminated personal map, and Gately\x{2019}s individual counselor

         safe amounts before unleashing it on Boone or Troeltsch or any unwitting civilians.
         Axford having been allowed in on the front end, the question of Hal\x{2019}s defraying the
         opportunity-cost of his part in the experiment is tactfully broached and turns out
         to be no problem. Pemulis\x{2019}s mark-up isn\x{2019}t anything beyond accepted norms, and there\x{2019}s
         always room in Hal\x{2019}s budget for spirited inquiry. Hal\x{2019}s one condition is that somebody
         tech-literate actually take the truck down to B.U. or M.I.T.\x{2019}s medical library and
         physically verify that the compound is both organic and nonaddictive, which Pemulis

         ego, wholly noninsecure since he blew out his knee on a contre-pied in the pre-Thanksgiving exhibition three years back, which is odd, now still in and
         at it for just the fun\x{2014}and more or less doomed, therefore, to a purgatorial existence

         as the fence takes his forward weight, Hal\x{2019}s posture subtly but warmly inclined ever
         so slightly toward his tiny older brother, who resembles him the way creatures of
         the same Order but not the same Family might resemble one another\x{2014}as they stand watching
         and hashing matters out, Hal and Pemulis, there\x{2019}s the thud and sprong of an E.W.D.
         transnational catapult off way below to their left and then the high keen sound of
         a waste-displacement projectile the clouds are too low to let them see the flight
         of\x{2014}though a weirdly yellow sheep-shaped cloud is visible somewhere up off past Acton,
         connecting the horizon\x{2019}s seam to some kind of coming storm-front held off by the ATHSCME
         fans along the Lowell-Methuen stretch of border, northwest. Pemulis finally nixes
         the notion of performing the spirited controlled experiment here in Enfield, where
         Axford has to be at the A squad\x{2019}s dawn drills every morning at <<0500|9c:1>>, and also Hal,
         unless he\x{2019}s slept over at HmH the night before, with HmH just not being a good DMZ-dropping
         venue at all. Pemulis, scanning up and down the length of the fence and winking at
         Mario, posits that a solid 36 hours of demand-free time will be advisable for any
         interaction with the incredibly potent you-know-whatski. That also lets out the inter-academy
         thing with Port Washington tomorrow, for which Charles Tavis has chartered two buses,
         because so many E.T.A. players are getting to go and do battle in this one\x{2014}Port Washington
         Academy is gargantuan, the Xerox Inc. of North American tennis academies, with over
         300 students and 64 courts, half of which they\x{2019}ll have already put under warm inflatable
         TesTar cover as of like Halloween, P.W.\x{2019}s staff being less into the value of elemental
         suffering than Schtitt & Co.\x{2014}so many that Tavis will almost surely go ahead and bus
         them all back up from Long Island just as soon as the post-competition dance is over,
         rather than shell out for all those motel rooms without corporate support. This E.T.A.\x{2013}P.W.
         meet and buffet and dance are a private, inter-academy tradition, an epic rivalry
         almost a decade old. Plus Pemulis says he\x{2019}ll need a couple weeks of quality med-library-stacks-tossing
         time to do the more exacting titration and side-effects research Hal agrees the soldier\x{2019}s
         sobering story seems to dictate. So, they conclude, the window of opportunity looks
         to be 11/20\x{2013}21\x{2014}the weekend right after the big End-of-Fiscal-Year fundraising exhibition
         with the E.T.A. A & B squads in singles against (this year) Qu\x{e9}bec\x{2019}s notoriously hapless
         Jr. Davis and Jr. Wightman Cup squads, 74 invited down under very quiet lowprofile political conditions via the good expatriate
         offices of Avril Incandenza to get vivisected by Wayne and Hal et al for the philanthropic
         amusement of E.T.A. patrons and alums, then to dance the P.M. away at a catered supper and Alumni Ball\x{2014}the weekend right before Thanksgiving week
         and the WhataBurger Invitational in sunny AZ, because this year in addition to Friday
         11/20 they also get Saturday 11/21 off, as in from both class and practice, because
         C.T. and Schtitt have arranged a special one-match doubles exhibition for the Saturday
         A.M. following the big meet, one between two female coaches of the Qu\x{e9}becois Wightmans
         and E.T.A.\x{2019}s infamous Vaught twins, Caryn and Sharyn Vaught, seventeen, O.N.A.N.\x{2019}s
         top-ranked junior women\x{2019}s doubles team, unbeaten in three years, an unbeatable duo,
         uncanny in their cooperation on the court, moving as One at all times, playing not
         just as if but in fact because they shared a brain, or at least the psychomotor lobes
         of one, the twins Siamese, fused at the left and right temple, banned from Singles
         by O.N.A.N. regs, the broad-shadow-casting Vaughts, flinty-eyed tire-executive\x{2019}s daughters
         out of Akron, using her/their four legs to cover chilling amounts of court, plus to
         sweep the Charleston competition at every post-exhibition formal ball for the last
         five years running. Tavis\x{2019}ll be on Wayne to play some sort of exhibitory thing, too,
         though asking Wayne to publicly smear a second Qu\x{e9}becer in two days might be a bit
         much. And but everyone who\x{2019}s anyone\x{2019}ll be down at the Lung, watching the Vaughts vivisect
         some adult-ranked Nucks, plus maybe Wayne, 75 then the E.T.A.s will get Saturday to rest and recharge before starting both the
         pre-WhataBurger training week and the bell-lap of prep for 12/12\x{2019}s Boards, meaning
         late Friday night\x{2013} Sunday A.M. will give Pemulis, Hal, and Axford (and maybe Struck if Pemulis needs to let Struck
         in, for help with library-tossing) enough time to psychospiritually rally from whatever
         meninges-withering hangover the incredibly potent DMZ might involve\x{2026} and Axford in
         the sauna predicted it would be a witherer indeed, since even just LSD alone he observed
         left you the next day not just sick or down but utterly empty, a shell, void inside,
         like your soul was a wrung-out sponge. Hal wasn\x{2019}t sure he concurred. An alcohol hangover
         was definitely no frolic in the psychic glade, all thirsty and sick and your eyes
         bulging and receding with your pulse, but after a night of involved hallucinogens
         Hal said the dawn seemed to confer on his psyche a kind of pale sweet aura, a luminescence.

         basis. What looks like the cage\x{2019}s exit is actually the bars of the cage. The afternoon\x{2019}s

         her heart, smoking first the Chore Boy-scrap she\x{2019}d used to trap the vapors and form

            "Geoffrey (not Geoff, Geoffrey) Day has been at Ennet House six days. He came from
         Roxbury\x{2019}s infamous Dimock Detox, where he was the only white person, which Gately
         bets must have been broadening for him. Day has a squished blank smeared flat face,
         one requiring like great self-effort to like, and eyes that are just starting to lose
         the nictitated glaze of early sobriety. Day is a newcomer and a wreck. A red-wine-and-Quaalude
         man who finally nodded out in late October and put his Saab through the window of
         a Malden sporting goods store and then got out and proceeded to browse until the Finest
         came and got him. Who taught something horseshit-sounding like social historicity
         or historical sociality at some jr. college up the Expressway in Medford and came
         in saying on his Intake he also manned the helm of a Scholarly Quarterly. Word for
         word, the House Manager had said: \x{2018}manned the helm\x{2019} and \x{2018}Scholarly.\x{2019} His Intake estimated that Day\x{2019}s been in and out of a blackout for most of the last
         several years, and his wiring is still as they say a bit frayed. His detox at Dimock,
         where they barely have the resources to give you a Librium if you start to D.T., must
         have been just real grim, because Geoffrey D. alleges it never happened: now his story
         is he just strolled into Ennet House on a lark one day from his home 10+ clicks away
         in Malden and found the place too hilariously egregulous to want to ever leave. It\x{2019}s
         the newcomers with some education that are the worst, according to Gene M. They identify
         their whole selves with their head, and the Disease makes its command headquarters
         in the head. 90 Day wears chinos of indeterminate hue, brown socks with black shoes, and shirts that
         Pat Montesian had described in the Intake as \x{2018}Eastern-European-type Hawaiian shirts.\x{2019}
         Day\x{2019}s now on the vinyl couch with Charlotte Treat after breakfast in the Ennet House
         living room with a few of the other residents that either aren\x{2019}t working or don\x{2019}t
         have to be at work early, and with Gately, who\x{2019}d pulled an all-night Dream Duty shift
         out in the front office till <<0400|9c:0>>, then got temp-relieved by Johnette Foltz so he
         could go to work janitoring down at the Shattuck Shelter till <<0700|9c:0>>, then came and
         hauled ass back up here and took back over so\x{2019}s that Johnette could go off to her
         NA thing with a bunch of NA people in what looked like a dune buggy if the dunes in
         question were in Hell, and is now, Gately, trying to unclench and center himself inside
         by tracing the cracks in the paint of the living room ceiling with his eyes. Gately
         often feels a terrible sense of loss, narcotics-wise, in the A.M., still, even after this long clean. His sponsor over at the White Flag Group says
         some people never get over the loss of what they\x{2019}d thought was their one true best
         friend and lover; they just have to pray daily for acceptance and the brass danglers
         to move forward through the grief and loss, to wait for time to harden the scab. The
         sponsor, Ferocious Francis G., doesn\x{2019}t give Gately one iona of shit for feeling some
         negative feelings about it: on the contrary, he commends Gately for his candor in
         breaking down and crying like a baby and telling him about it early <<one A.M.|5>> over the pay phone, the sense of loss. It\x{2019}s a myth no one misses it. Their particular
         Substance. Shit, you wouldn\x{2019}t need help if you didn\x{2019}t miss it. You just have to Ask
         For Help and like Turn It Over, the loss and pain, to Keep Coming, show up, pray,
         Ask For Help. Gately rubs his eye. Simple advice like this does seem like a lot of
         clich\x{e9}s\x{2014}Day\x{2019}s right about how it seems. Yes, and if Geoffrey Day keeps on steering
         by the way things seem to him then he\x{2019}s a dead man for sure. Gately\x{2019}s already watched
         dozens come through here and leave early and go back Out There and then go to jail
         or die. If Day ever gets lucky and breaks down, finally, and comes to the front office
         at night to scream that he can\x{2019}t take it anymore and clutch at Gately\x{2019}s pantcuff and
         blubber and beg for help at any cost, Gately\x{2019}ll get to tell Day the thing is that
         the clich\x{e9}d directives are a lot more deep and hard to actually do. To try and live by instead of just say. But he\x{2019}ll only get to say it if Day comes
         and asks. Personally, Gately gives Geoffrey D. like a month at the outside before
         he\x{2019}s back tipping his hat to parking meters. Except who is Gately to judge who\x{2019}ll
         end up getting the Gift of the program v. who won\x{2019}t, he needs to remember. He tries
         to feel like Day is teaching him patience and tolerance. It takes great patience and
         tolerance not to want to punt the soft little guy out into the Comm. Ave. ravine and
         open up his bunk to somebody that really desperately wants it, the Gift. Except who
         is Gately to think he can know who wants it and who doesn\x{2019}t, deep down. Gately\x{2019}s arm
         is behind his head, up against the sofa\x{2019}s other arm. The old D.E.C. viewer is on to
         something violent and color-enhanced Gately neither sees nor hears. It was part of
         his gifts as a burglar: he can sort of turn his attention on and off like a light.
         Even when he was a resident here he\x{2019}d had this prescient housebreaker\x{2019}s ability to
         screen input, to do sensory triage. It was one reason he\x{2019}d even been able to stick

         workers, vagrants, indignant car salesmen, bulimic trauma-mamas, bunko artists, mincing

            "Gately wonders what color he\x{2019}d call the ceiling if forced to call it a color. It\x{2019}s
         not white and it\x{2019}s not gray. The brown-yellow tones are from high-tar gaspers; a pall
         hangs up near the ceiling even this early in the new sober day. Some of the drunks
         and tranq-jockeys stay up most of the night, joggling their feet and chain-smoking,
         even though there\x{2019}s no cartridges or music allowed <<after 0000h|1>>. He has that odd House
         Staffer\x{2019}s knack, Gately, already, after four months, of seeing everything in both
         living and dining rooms without really looking. Emil Minty, a hard-core smack-addict
         punk here for reasons nobody can quite yet pin down, is in an old mustard-colored
         easy chair with his combat boots up on one of the standing ashtrays, which is tilting
         not quite enough for Gately to tell him to watch out, please. Minty\x{2019}s orange mohawk
         and the shaved skull around it are starting to grow out brown, which is just not a
         pleasant sight in the morning at all. The other ashtray on the floor by his chair
         is full of the ragged little new moons of bitten nails, which has got to mean that
         the Hester T. that he\x{2019}d ordered to bed at <<0230|18:1>> was right back down here in the chair
         going at her nails again the second Gately left to mop shit at the Shelter. When he\x{2019}s
         up all night Gately\x{2019}s stomach gets all tight and acidy, from either all the coffee
         maybe or just staying up. Minty\x{2019}s been on the streets since he was like sixteen, Gately
         can tell: he\x{2019}s got that sooty complexion homeless guys get where the soot has insinuated
         itself into the dermal layer and thickened, making Minty look somehow upholstered.
         And the big-armed driver for Leisure Time Ice, the quiet kid, Green, a garbage-head
         all-Substance-type kid, maybe twenty-one, face very slightly smunched in on one side,
         wears sleeveless khaki shirts and had lived in a trailer in that apocalyptic Enfield
         trailer park out near the Allston Spur; Gately likes Green because he seems to have
         got sense enough to keep his map shut when he\x{2019}s got nothing important to say, which
         is basically all the time. The tattoo on the kid\x{2019}s right tricep is a spear-pierced
         heart over the hideous name MILDRED BONK, who Bruce G. told him was a ray of living light and a dead ringer for the late lead
         singer of The Fiends in Human Shape and his dead heart\x{2019}s one love ever, and who took
         their daughter and left him this summer for some guy that told her he ranched fucking
         longhorn cows east of Atlantic City NJ. He\x{2019}s got, even by Ennet House standards, major-league
         sleep trouble, Green, and he and Gately play cribbage sometimes in the wee dead hours,
         a game Gately picked up in jail. Burt F.S. is now hunched in a meaty coughing fit,
         his elbows out and his forehead purple. No sign of Hester Thrale, nailbiter and something
         Pat calls Borderline. Gately can see everything without moving or moving his head
         or either eye. Also in here is Randy Lenz, who Lenz is a small-time organic-coke dealer
         who wears sportcoats rolled up over his parlor-tanned forearms and is always checking
         his pulse on the inside of his wrists. It\x{2019}s come out that Lenz is of keen interest
         to both sides of the law because this past May he\x{2019}d apparently all of a sudden lost
         all control and holed up all of a sudden in a Charlestown motel and free-based most
         of a whole 100 grams he\x{2019}d been fronted by a suspiciously trusting Brazilian in what
         Lenz didn\x{2019}t know was supposed to have been a D.E.A. sting operation in the South End.
         Having screwed both sides in what Gately secretly views as a delicious fuck-up, Randy
         Lenz has, since May, been the most wanted he\x{2019}s probably ever been. He is seedily handsome
         in the way of pimps and low-level coke dealers, muscular in the MP-ish way that certain
         guys\x{2019} muscles look muscular but can\x{2019}t really lift anything, with complexly gelled
         hair and the little birdlike head-movements of the deeply vain. One forearm\x{2019}s hair
         has a little hairless patch, which Gately knows well spells knife-owner, and if there\x{2019}s
         one thing Gately\x{2019}s never been able to stomach it\x{2019}s a knife-owner, little swaggery
         guys that always queer a square beef and come up off the ground with a knife where
         you have to get cut to take it away from them. Lenz is teaching Gately reserved politeness
         to people you pretty much want to beat up on sight. It\x{2019}s pretty obvious to everybody
         except Pat Montesian\x{2014}whose odd gullibility in the presence of human sludge, though,
         Gately needs to try to remember had been one of the reasons why he himself had got
         into Ennet House, originally\x{2014}obvious that Lenz is here mostly just to hide out: he
         rarely leaves the House except under compulsion, avoids windows, and travels to the
         nightly required AA/NA meetings in a disguise that makes him look like Cesar Romero
         after a terrible accident; and then he always wants to walk back to the House solo
         afterward, which is not encouraged. Lenz is seated low in the northeasternmost corner
         of an old fake-velour love seat he\x{2019}s jammed in the northeasternmost corner of the
         living room. Randy Lenz has a strange compulsive need to be north of everything, and
         possibly even northeast of everything, and Gately has no clue what it\x{2019}s about but
         observes Lenz\x{2019}s position routinely for his own interest and files. Lenz\x{2019}s leg, like
         Ken Erdedy\x{2019}s leg, never stops joggling; Day claims it joggles even worse in sleep.
         Another gurgle and abdominal chug for Don G., lying there. Charlotte Treat has violently
         red hair. As in hair the color of like a red crayon. The reason she doesn\x{2019}t have to
         work an outside menial job is she\x{2019}s got some strain of the Virus or like H.I.V. Former
         prostitute, reformed. Why do prostitutes when they get straight always try and get
         so prim? It\x{2019}s like long-repressed librarian-ambitions come flooding out. Charlotte
         T. has a cut-rate whore\x{2019}s hard half-pretty face, her eyes lassoed with shadow around
         all four lids. Her also with a case of the dermal-layer sooty complexion. The riveting
         thing about Treat is how her cheeks are deeply pitted in these deep trenches that
         she packs with foundation and tries to cover over with blush, which along with the
         hair gives her the look of a mean clown. The ghastly wounds in her cheeks look for
         all the world like somebody got at her with a woodburning kit at some point in her

            "A nameless cat oozes by on the broad windowsill above the back of the fabric couch.
         Animals here come and go. Alumni adopt them or they just disappear. Their fleas tend
         to remain. Gately\x{2019}s intestines moan. Boston\x{2019}s dawn coming back on the Green Line this
         morning was chemically pink, trails of industrial exhaust blowing due north. The nail-parings
         in the ashtray on the floor are, he realizes now, too big to be from fingernails.
         These bitten arcs are broad and thick and a deep autumnal yellow. He swallows hard.
         He\x{2019}d tell Geoffrey Day how, even if they are just clich\x{e9}s, clich\x{e9}s are (a) soothing,
         and (b) remind you of common sense, and (c) license the universal assent that drowns
         out silence; and (4) silence is deadly, pure Spider-food, if you\x{2019}ve got the Disease.
         Gene M. says you can spell the Disease DIS-EASE, which sums the basic situation up nicely. Pat has a meeting at the Division of Substance
         Abuse Services in Government Center at <<noon|13>> she needs to be reminded about. She can\x{2019}t
         read her own handwriting, which the stroke affected her handwriting. Gately envisions
         going around having to find out who\x{2019}s biting their fucking toenails in the living
         room and putting the disgusting toenail-bits in the ashtray at like <<0500|18:1>>. Plus House
         regs prohibit bare feet anyplace downstairs. There\x{2019}s a pale-brown water stain on the
         ceiling over Day and Treat the almost exact shape of Florida. Randy Lenz has issues
         with Geoffrey Day because Day is glib and a teacher at a Scholarly Journal\x{2019}s helm.
         This threatens the self-concept of a Randy Lenz that thinks of himself as a kind of
         hiply sexy artist-intellectual. Small-time dealers never conceptualize themselves
         as just small-time dealers, kind of like whores never do. For Occupation on his Intake form Lenz had put free lance script writer. And he makes a show of that he reads. For the first week here in July he\x{2019}d held the
         books upside-down in the northeast corner of whatever room. He had a gigantic Medical
         Dictionary he\x{2019}d haul down and smoke and read until Annie Parrot the Asst. Manager
         had to tell him not to bring it down anymore because it was fucking with Morris Hanley\x{2019}s
         mind. At which juncture he quit reading and started talking, making everybody nostalgic
         for when he just sat there and read. Geoffrey D. has issues with Randy L., also, you
         can tell: there\x{2019}s a certain way they don\x{2019}t quite look at each other. And so now of
         course they\x{2019}re mashed together in the 3-Man together, since three guys in one night
         missed curfew and came in without one normal-sized pupil between them and refused
         Urines and got bounced on the spot, and so Day gets moved up in his first week from
         the 5-Man room to the 3-Man. Seniority comes quick around here. Past Minty, down at
         the dining-room table\x{2019}s end, Burt F.S.\x{2019}s still coughing, still hunched over, his face
         a dusky purple, and Nell G. is behind him pounding him on the back so that it keeps
         sending him forward over his ashtray, and he\x{2019}s waving one stump vaguely over his shoulder
         to try and signal her to quit. Lenz and Day: a beef may be brewing: Day\x{2019}ll try to
         goad Lenz into a beef that\x{2019}ll be public enough so he doesn\x{2019}t get hurt but does get
         bounced, and then he can leave treatment and go back to Chianti and \x{2019}Ludes and getting
         assaulted by sidewalks and make out like the relapse is Ennet House\x{2019}s fault and never
         have to confront himself or his Disease. To Gately, Day is like a wide-open interactive
         textbook on the Disease. One of Gately\x{2019}s jobs is to keep an eye on what\x{2019}s possibly
         brewing among residents and let Pat or the Manager know and try to smooth things down
         in advance if possible. The ceiling\x{2019}s color could be called dun, if forced. Someone
         has farted; no one knows just who, but this isn\x{2019}t like a normal adult place where

         of him, Orin, and any decision his very best thinking yielded. But they were still
         in favor of college, privately, you could tell. Orin was clearly not ever going to
         be a professional-caliber adult tennis player. His competitive peak had come at thirteen,
         when he\x{2019}d gotten to the 14-and-Under quarterfinals of the National Clays in Indianapolis
         IN and in the Quarters had taken a set off the second seed; but starting soon after

         and hairy-legged and starting now to clean Orin\x{2019}s own clock at fourteen and fifteen\x{2014}this
         had sucked some kind of competitive afflatus out of him, broken his tennis spirit,
         Orin, and his U.S.T.A. ranking had nosedived through three years until it levelled
         off somewhere in the low 70s, which meant that by age fifteen he wasn\x{2019}t even qualifying
         for the major events\x{2019} main 64-man draw. When E.T.A. opened, his ranking among the
         Boys\x{2019} 18s hovered around 10 and he was relegated to a middle spot on the Academy\x{2019}s
         B-squad, a mediocrity that sort of becalmed his verve even further. His style was
         essentially that of a baseliner, a counterpuncher, but without the return of serve
         or passing shots you need to stand much of a chance against a quality net-man. The
         E.T.A. rap on Orin was that he lobbed well but too often. He did have a phenomenal
         lob: he could hug the curve of the dome of the Lung and three times out of four nail
         a large-sized coin placed on the opposite baseline; he and Marlon Bain and two or
         three other marginal counterpunching boys at E.T.A. all had phenomenal lobs, honed
         through spare P.M. devoted more and more to Eschaton, which by the most plausible account a Croatian-refugee
         transfer had brought up from the Palmer Academy in Tampa. Orin was Eschaton\x{2019}s first

         in the west suburbs; Pemulis\x{2019}d let Tall Paul Shaw take the multi-emblazoned tow truck
         to take Mario down to the Public Gardens to watch the public I.-Day festivities with
         the Bolex H64; the local kids often go home for the day; a lot of the rest like to
         lie in the Viewing Rooms barely moving all I. Day until the dinner gala. Lord tear-asses
         back and forth between Courts 6 and 8, food cart clattering (the food cart, which
         Pemulis and Axford picked up from a kind of a seedy-looking orderly at SJOG hospital
         that Pemulis knew from Allston, has one of those crazy left front wheels that e.g.

         when rushed), ferrying messages which the 18-and-Under guys can tell AMNAT and SOVWAR
         are making deliberately oblique and obtuse so Lord has to do that much more running:
         God is never a particularly popular role to have to play, and Lord this fall has already
         been the victim of several boarding-school-type pranks too puerile even to detail.
         J. A. L. Struck Jr., who as usual has made a swine of himself with the suspiciously

         peace terms in whatever a D. Tree\x{2019}s version of neon letters is, because the biggest
         priority for AMNAT right at <<1515h|1>>. is to avoid having to SACPOP with SOVWAR, since
         if the game stops right now AMNAT\x{2019}s probably won, whereas if they SACPOP with SOVWAR,
         trading massive infliction of INDDIR for massive body-shots of SUFDDIR, staying more
         or less even with each other, AMNAT\x{2019}ll still be the same number of points ahead of
         SOVWAR overall, but it\x{2019}ll have taken such heavy SUFDDIR debits that IRLIBSYR\x{2014}never
         forget IRLIBSYR, brilliantly if obnoxiously Imam\x{2019}d today by eleven-year-old eyebrowless
         Evan Ingersoll of Binghamton NNY\x{2014}by staying out of the SACPOP-fest and lobbing sporadically
         at SOVWAR just often enough to rack up serious INDDIR but not quite enough to piss
         SOVWAR off enough to provoke the retaliatory SS10-wave that would mean significant
         SUFDDIR, could well have a serious shot at overtaking AMNAT for the overall Eschaton,
         especially when you factored in the f(x) advantages for bellicosity and nonexistent civil defense. At some point Axford
         has passed the remainder of the cigarette back over toward Struck without looking
         to see that Struck is no longer in his chair, and Hal finds himself taking the proffered
         duBois and smoking dope in public without even thinking about it or having consciously
         decided to go ahead. Sure enough, poor red-faced runny-nosed Lord is making way too
         many clattering trips between Courts 6 and 8 for it to mean anything but peace terms.
         Evan Ingersoll is positively strip-mining his right nostril. Finally Lord stops with
         the running back and forth and positions himself in the ad service box of Court 7
         and loads a new diskette into the Yushityu. Struck moans something in a possibly foreign
         tongue. All the other upperclass spectators have scooted their chairs well away from
         Struck. Troeltsch extends a blood-blistered palm and rubs the tips of the hand\x{2019}s fingers
         together at Hal, and Hal forks over the fin without handing the thin cigarette back
         over to Axford, somehow. Pemulis has leaned forward intently with his pointy chin
         in his hands; he seems completely absorbed.",

            "Lord is crunching madly away at the TP under the just-opened protection of an old
         beach umbrella a previous game-master had welded to the top of the food cart. Lord
         wipes his nose against the same shoulder that\x{2019}s clamping a phone to his ear, awkwardly,
         and reports he\x{2019}s checked the D.E.C.\x{2019}s Eschaton-Axiom directory via Pink2-capable modem and that unfortunately with all due respect to Ann and Mike it doesn\x{2019}t
         seem to explicitly say players with strategic functions can\x{2019}t become target-areas
         if they traipse around outside their defense-nets. LaMont Chu says how come point-values
         for actual players have never been assigned, then, for Pete\x{2019}s sake, and Pemulis shouts
         across that that\x{2019}s so totally beside the point it doesn\x{2019}t matter, that the reason
         players aren\x{2019}t explicitly exempted in the ESCHAX.DIR is that their exemption is what
         makes Eschaton and its axioms fucking possible in the first place. A kind of pale boat-wake of exhaust exits the idling Ford sedan off behind
         the pavilion and widens as it rises, dispersing. Pemulis says because otherwise use
         your heads otherwise nonstrategic emotions would get aroused and Combatants would
         be whacking balls at each other\x{2019}s physical persons all the time and Eschaton wouldn\x{2019}t
         even be possible in its icily elegant game-theoretical form. He\x{2019}s stopped jumping
         up and down, at least, Troeltsch observes. Players\x{2019} exemption from strikes goes without
         saying, Pemulis says; it\x{2019}s like preaxiomatic. Pemulis tells Lord to consider what he\x{2019}s doing very carefully, because
         from where Pemulis is standing Lord looks to be willing to very possibly compromise
         Eschaton\x{2019}s map for all time. Girls 16\x{2019}s/18\x{2019}s prorector Mary Esther Thode putts from
         left to right behind the pavilion on the long driveway from the circular drive to
         the portcullis and halts her scooter and lifts her helmet\x{2019}s tinted visor and yells
         across for Kittenplan to put a hat on if she\x{2019}s going to play in the snow in a crew-cut.
         This even though Kittenplan isn\x{2019}t even strictly in Ms. Thode\x{2019}s like umbrella of authority,
         Axford observes to Troeltsch, who relays this fact into his headset. Hal moves his
         mouth around to try to gather up spit in a mouth that\x{2019}s gotten rather dry, which when
         you have a plug of Kodiak in is not very pleasant. Ann Kittenplan has been suffering
         from what look like almost Parkinsonian tremors for the last few minutes, her face
         writhing and her mustache almost standing right out straight. LaMont Chu repeats his
         claim that there\x{2019}s no way players even with strategic functions can ever be legit
         target-areas if no INDDIR/SUFDDIR values have been entered for them in EndStat\x{2019}s tally-function.
         Pemulis orders Chu not to distract Otis Lord from the incredibly potent and lethal
         ground Lord\x{2019}s letting Ingersoll lead them onto. He says none of them have ever even
         seen the true meaning of the word crisis yet. Ingersoll calls over to Pemulis that his emeritus veto-power is only over Lord\x{2019}s
         calculations, not over today\x{2019}s game\x{2019}s God\x{2019}s decisions about what\x{2019}s part of the game
         and what isn\x{2019}t. Pemulis invites Ingersoll to do something anatomically impossible.
         Pemulis asks LaMont Chu and Ann Kittenplan if they\x{2019}re just going to stand there with
         their thumbs in their bottoms and let Lord let Ingersoll eliminate Eschaton\x{2019}s map
         for keeps for one slimy cheesy victory in just one day\x{2019}s apocalypse. Kittenplan has
         been trembling and feeling at the back of her vein-laced head and looking across the
         Mediterranean at Ingersoll like somebody who knows they\x{2019}ll go to prison for what they
         want to do. Axford posits certain very unlikely physical conditions under which what
         Pemulis told Ingersoll to do to himself wouldn\x{2019}t be totally impossible. Hal spits
         thickly and gathers and tries to spit again, watching. Troeltsch broadcasts the fact
         that there\x{2019}s always a queer vague vitaminish stink about Mary Esther Thode that he
         never can quite place. There\x{2019}s the sudden tripartite whump of three Empire Waste Displacement
         vehicles being propelled above the cloud-cover to points far north. Hal identifies
         Thode\x{2019}s ambient odor as the stink of thiamine, which for reasons best known to Thode
         she takes a lot of; and Troeltsch broadcasts the datum and refers to Hal as a \x{2018}close
         source,\x{2019} which strikes Hal as odd and somehow off in a way he can\x{2019}t quite name. Kittenplan
         shakes Chu\x{2019}s arm loose and darts over and extracts a warhead from SOVWAR\x{2019}s portable
         stockpile and shouts out that well OK then if players can be targets then in that
         case: and she fires a real screamer at Ingersoll\x{2019}s head, which Ingersoll barely blocks
         with his Rossignol and shrieks that Kittenplan can\x{2019}t launch anything at anything because
         she\x{2019}s been vaporized by a 5-megaton contact-burst. Kittenplan tells Ingersoll to write
         his congressman about it and over LaMont Chu\x{2019}s pleas for reasoned discussion takes
         several more theoretically valuable warheads out of the industrial-solvent bucket
         and gets truly serious about hitting Ingersoll, moving steadily east across Nigeria
         and Chad, causing Ingersoll to run due north across the courts\x{2019} map at impressive
         speed, abandoning IRLIBSYR\x{2019}s ammo-bucket and tear-assing up through Siberia crying
         Foul. Lord\x{2019}s mewing ineffectually for order, but some of the other Combatants\x{2019} staffs
         have begun to smell that Evan Ingersoll\x{2019}s become fair game for cruelty\x{2014}the way kids
         can seem to smell this sort of thing out with such uncanny acuity\x{2014}and REDCHI\x{2019}s General
         Secretary and an AMNAT vector-planning specialist and Josh Gopnik all start moving
         northeast over the map firing balls as hard as they can at Ingersoll, who\x{2019}s dropped
         his launcher and is shaking frantically at the chained gate on the fence\x{2019}s north side,
         where Mrs. Incandenza has decided she doesn\x{2019}t want kids exiting the East Courts and
         trampling her calliopsis; and these little kids can hit balls exceptionally hard.
         Hal is now unable to gather enough spit to spit. One warhead hits Ingersoll in the
         neck and another solidly in the meat of the thigh. Ingersoll begins to limp around
         in small circles holding his neck, crying in that slow-motion shuddery way little
         kids have when they\x{2019}re crying more at the fact of being hurt than at the hurt itself.
         Pemulis is walking backwards away from the south fence back toward the pavilion and
         has both arms up in either appeal or fury or something else. Axford tells Hal and
         Troeltsch he wishes he didn\x{2019}t feel the dark thrill he felt watching Ingersoll get
         pummeled. Some filmy red peanut-skin has gotten into Jim Struck\x{2019}s hair as he lies
         there motionless. O. P. Lord attempts to rule that Ingersoll is no longer on the four
         courts of Eschaton\x{2019}s earth-map and so isn\x{2019}t even theoretically a valid target-area.
         It doesn\x{2019}t matter. Several kids close in on Ingersoll, triangulating their bombardment,
         T. Peterson on point. Ingersoll is hit several times, once right near the eye. Jim
         Troeltsch is up and running to the fence wanting to stop the thing, but Pemulis catches
         him by his headset\x{2019}s cord and tells him to let them all lie in their own bed. Hal,
         now leaning forward, steeple-fingered, finds himself just about paralyzed with absorption.
         Trevor Axford, fist to his chin, asks Hal if he\x{2019}s ever just simply fucking hated somebody without having any idea why. Hal finds himself riveted at something about
         the degenerating game that seems so terribly abstract and fraught with implications
         and consequences that even thinking about how to articulate it seems so complexly
         stressful that being almost incapacitated with absorption is almost the only way out
         of the complex stress. Now INDPAK\x{2019}s Penn and AMNAT\x{2019}s McKenna, who have long-standing
         personal bones to pick with Ann Kittenplan, peel off and gather ordnance and execute
         a pincer movement on Ann Kittenplan. She is hit twice from behind at close range.
         Ingersoll has long since gone down and is still getting hit. Lord is ruling at the
         top of his lungs that there\x{2019}s no way AMNAT can launch against itself when he gets
         tagged right on the breastbone by an errant warhead. Clutching his chest with one
         hand, with the other he flicks the red beanie\x{2019}s propeller, never before flicked, whose
         flicked spin heralds a worst-case-&-utterly-decontrolled-Armageddon-type situation.
         Timmy Peterson takes a ball in the groin and goes down like a sack of refined flour.
         Everybody\x{2019}s scooping up spent warheads and totally unrealistically refiring them.
         The fences shudder and sing as balls rain against them. Ingersoll now resembles some
         sort of animal that\x{2019}s been run over in the road. Troeltsch, who\x{2019}s looking for the
         first time at the idling sedan by West House\x{2019}s dumpsters and asking if anybody knew
         anybody who drove a Nunhagen-Aspirin-adverting Ford, is the only upperclass spectator
         who doesn\x{2019}t seem utterly silently engrossed. Ann Kittenplan has dropped her racquet
         and is charging McKenna. She takes two contact-bursts in the breast-area before she
         gets to him and lays McKenna out with an impressive left cross. LaMont Chu tackles
         Todd Possalthwaite from behind. Struck looks to have wet his pants in his sleep. J.
         J. Penn slips on a grounded warhead near Fiji and goes spectacularly down. The snowfall
         makes everything gauzy and terribly clear at the same time, eliminating all visual
         background so that the map\x{2019}s action seems stark and surreal. Nobody\x{2019}s using tennis
         balls now anymore. Josh Gopnik punches LaMont Chu in the stomach, and LaMont Chu yells
         that he\x{2019}s been punched in the stomach. Ann Kittenplan has Kieran McKenna in a headlock
         and is punching him repeatedly on the top of the skull. Otis P. Lord lets down the
         beach umbrella and starts pushing his crazy-wheeled food cart at a diskette-rattling
         clip toward 12\x{2019}s open south gate, still flicking furiously at the red beanie\x{2019}s propeller.
         Struck\x{2019}s hair is steadily accreting nut-skins. Pemulis is under cover but still standing,
         his legs well apart and his arms folded. The figure in the green Ford still hasn\x{2019}t
         moved once. Troeltsch says he for his own part wouldn\x{2019}t be just sitting and lying
         there if any of the Little Buddies under his personal charge were out there getting
         potentially injured, and Hal reflects that he does feel a certain sort of intense
         anxiety, but can\x{2019}t sort through the almost infinite-seeming implications of what Troeltsch
         is saying fast enough to determine whether the anxiety is over something about what
         he\x{2019}s seeing or something in the connection between what Troeltsch is saying and the
         degree to which he\x{2019}s absorbed in what\x{2019}s going on out inside the fence, which is a
         degenerative chaos so complex in its disorder that it\x{2019}s hard to tell whether it seems
         choreographed or simply chaotically disordered. LaMont Chu is throwing up into the
         Indian Ocean. Todd Possalthwaite has his hands to his face and is shrieking something
         about his \x{2018}doze.\x{2019} It is now, beyond any argument or equivocation, snowing. The sky is off-white. Lord
         and his cart are now literally making tracks for the edge of the map. Evan Ingersoll
         hasn\x{2019}t moved in several minutes. Penn lies in a whitening service box with one leg
         bent beneath him at an impossible angle. Someone way off behind them has been blowing
         an athletic whistle. Ann Kittenplan begins to chase REDCHI\x{2019}s General Secretary south
         across the Asian subcontinent at top speed. Pemulis is telling Hal he hates to say
         he told them so. Hal can see Axford leaning way forward sheltering something tiny
         from the wind as he flicks at it with a spent lighter. It occurs to him this is the
         third anniversary of Axhandle losing a right finger and half his right thumb. Fierce
         little J. Gopnik is flailing at the air and telling whoever wants it to come on, come
         on. Otis P. Lord and his cart sail clattering across Indochina toward the southern
         gate. Hal is suddenly aware that Troeltsch and Pemulis are wincing but is not himself
         wincing and isn\x{2019}t sure why they are wincing and is looking out into the fray trying
         to determine whether he should be wincing when REDCHI\x{2019}s General Secretary, calling
         loudly for his mother and in full flight as he looks over his shoulder at Ann Kittenplan\x{2019}s
         contorted face, barrels directly into Lord\x{2019}s speeding food cart. There\x{2019}s a noise like
         the historical sum of all cafeteria accidents everywhere. 3.6-MB diskettes take flight
         like mad bats across what uncovered would be the baseline of Court 12. Different-colored
         beanies spill from the rolling solander box, whose lock\x{2019}s hasp is broken and protrudes
         like a tongue as it rolls. The TP\x{2019}s monitor and modem and Yushityu chassis, with most
         of Eschaton\x{2019}s nervous system on its hard drive, assume a parabolic southwest vector.
         The heavy equipment\x{2019}s altitude is impressive. An odd silent still moment hangs, the
         TP aloft. Pemulis bellows, his hands to his cheeks. Otis P. Lord hurdles the bent
         forms of food cart and General Secretary and sprints low over the court\x{2019}s map\x{2019}s snow,
         trying to save hardware that\x{2019}s now at the top of its rainbow\x{2019}s arc. It\x{2019}s clear Lord
         won\x{2019}t make it. It\x{2019}s a slow-motion moment. The snowfall\x{2019}s more than heavy enough now,
         Hal thinks, to excuse Lord\x{2019}s not seeing LaMont Chu directly before him, on his hands
         and knees, throwing up. Lord impacts Chu\x{2019}s arched form at about knee-level and is
         spectacularly airborne. The idling Ford reveals a sudden face at the driver\x{2019}s-side
         window. Axford is holding the lighter\x{2019}s chassis up to his ear and shaking it. Ann
         Kittenplan is ramming REDCHI\x{2019}s leader\x{2019}s face repeatedly into the mesh of the south
         fence. Lord\x{2019}s flight\x{2019}s parabola is less spectacular on the y-axis than the TP\x{2019}s has
         been. The Yushityu\x{2019}s hard-drive chassis makes an indescribable sound as it hits the
         earth and its brightly circuited guts come out. The color monitor lands on its back
         with its screen blinking ERROR at the white sky. Hal and everyone else can project
         Lord\x{2019}s flight\x{2019}s own terminus an instant before impact. For a brief moment that Hal
         will later regard as completely and uncomfortably bizarre, Hal feels at his own face
         to see whether he is wincing. The distant whistle patweets. Lord does indeed go headfirst
         down through the monitor\x{2019}s screen, and stays there, his sneakers in the air and his
         warm-up pants sagging upward to reveal black socks. There\x{2019}d been a bad sound of glass.
         Penn flails on his back. Possalthwaite, Ingersoll, and McKenna bleed. The second shift\x{2019}s

            "The White Flag Group of Enfield MA, in metropolitan Boston, meets Sundays in the cafeteria
         of the Provident Nursing Home on Hanneman Street, off Commonwealth Avenue a couple
         blocks west of Enfield Tennis Academy\x{2019}s flat-topped hill. Tonight the White Flag Group
         is hosting a Commitment from the Advanced Basics Group of Concord, a suburb of Boston.
         The Advanced Basics people have driven almost an hour to get here, plus there\x{2019}s always
         the problem of signless urban streets and directions given over the phone. On this
         coming Friday night, a small horde of White Flaggers will drive out to Concord to
         put on a reciprocal Commitment for the Advanced Basics Group. Travelling long distances
         on signless streets trying to parse directions like \x{2018}Take the second left off the
         rotary by the driveway to the chiropractor\x{2019}s\x{2019} and getting lost and shooting your whole
         evening after a long day just to speak for like six minutes at a plywood podium is
         called \x{2018}Getting Active With Your Group\x{2019}; the speaking itself is known as \x{2018}12th-Step
         Work\x{2019} or \x{2018}Giving It Away.\x{2019} Giving It Away is a cardinal Boston AA principle. The term\x{2019}s
         derived from an epigrammatic description of recovery in Boston AA: \x{2018}You give it up
         to get it back to give it away.\x{2019} Sobriety in Boston is regarded as less a gift than
         a sort of cosmic loan. You can\x{2019}t pay the loan back, but you can pay it forward, by spreading the message that despite all appearances AA works, spreading this message
         to the next new guy who\x{2019}s tottered in to a meeting and is sitting in the back row
         unable to hold his cup of coffee. The only way to hang onto sobriety is to give it
         away, and even just 24 hours of sobriety is worth doing anything for, a sober day
         being nothing short of a daily miracle if you\x{2019}ve got the Disease like he\x{2019}s got the
         Disease, says the Advanced Basics member who\x{2019}s chairing this evening\x{2019}s Commitment,
         saying just a couple public words to the hall before he opens the meeting and retires
         to a stool next to the podium and calls his Group\x{2019}s speakers by random lot. The chairperson
         says he didn\x{2019}t used to be able to go 24 lousy minutes without a nip, before he Came In. \x{2018}Coming In\x{2019} means admitting that your personal
         ass is kicked and tottering into Boston AA, ready to go to any lengths to stop the
         shit-storm. The Advanced Basics chairperson looks like a perfect cross between pictures
         of Dick Cavett and Truman Capote 133 except this guy\x{2019}s also like totally, almost flamboyantly bald, and to top it off
         he\x{2019}s wearing a bright-black country-western shirt with baroque curlicues of white
         Nodie-piping across the chest and shoulders, and a string tie, plus sharp-toed boots
         of some sort of weirdly imbricate reptile skin, and overall he\x{2019}s riveting to look
         at, grotesque in that riveting way that flaunts its grotesquerie. There are more cheap
         metal ashtrays and Styrofoam cups in this broad hall than you\x{2019}ll see anywhere else
         ever on earth. Gately\x{2019}s sitting right up front in the first row, so close to the podium
         he can see the tailor\x{2019}s notch in the chairperson\x{2019}s outsized incisors, but he enjoys
         twisting around and watching everybody come in and mill around shaking water off their
         outerwear, trying to find empty seats. Even on the night of the I.-Day holiday, the
         Provident\x{2019}s cafeteria is packed by <<2000h|1>>. AA does not take holidays any more than
         the Disease does. This is the big established Sunday P.M. meeting for AAs in Enfield and Allston and Brighton. Regulars come every week from
         Watertown and East Newton, too, often, unless they\x{2019}re out on Commitments with their
         own Groups. The Provident cafeteria walls, painted an indecisive green, are tonight
         bedecked with portable felt banners emblazoned with AA slogans in Cub-Scoutish blue
         and gold. The slogans on them appear way too insipid even to mention what they are.
         E.g. \x{2018}ONE DAY AT A TIME,\x{2019} for one. The effete western-dressed guy concludes his opening
         exhortation, leads the opening Moment of Silence, reads the AA Preamble, pulls a random
         name out of the Crested Beaut cowboy hat he\x{2019}s holding, makes a squinty show of reading
         it, says he\x{2019}d like to call Advanced Basics\x{2019} first random speaker of the evening, and

         and drug addicts who compose over 70% of a given year\x{2019}s suicides, some try to go out
         with a last great garish Balaclavan gesture: one longtime member of the White Flag
         Group is a prognathous lady named Louise B. who tried to take a map-eliminating dive
         off the old Hancock Building downtown in B.S. \x{2019}81 but got caught in the gust of a
         rising thermal only six flights off the roof and got blown cartwheeling back up and
         in through the smoked-glass window of an arbitrage firm\x{2019}s suite on the thirty-fourth
         floor, ending up sprawled prone on a high-gloss conference table with only lacerations
         and a compound of the collarbone and an experience of willed self-annihilation and

         she\x{2019}s comparatively ignored and avoided, though her AA story, being just like everybody
         else\x{2019}s but more spectacular, has become metro Boston AA myth. But so when you get
         to this jumping-off place at the Finish of your Substance-career you can either take
         up the Luger or blade and eliminate your own personal map\x{2014}this can be at age sixty,
         or twenty-seven, or seventeen\x{2014}or you can get out the very beginning of the Yellow
         Pages or InterNet Psych-Svce File and make a blubbering <<0200h|1>>. phone call and admit
         to a gentle grandparentish voice that you\x{2019}re in trouble, deadly serious trouble, and
         the voice will try to soothe you into hanging on until a couple hours go by and two
         pleasantly earnest, weirdly calm guys in conservative attire appear smiling at your
         door sometime before dawn and speak quietly to you for hours and leave you not remembering
         anything from what they said except the sense that they used to be eerily like you,
         just where you are, utterly fucked, and but now somehow aren\x{2019}t anymore, fucked like
         you, at least they didn\x{2019}t seem like they were, unless the whole thing\x{2019}s some incredibly
         involved scam, this AA thing, and so but anyway you sit there on what\x{2019}s left of your
         furniture in the lavender dawnlight and realize that by now you literally have no
         other choices besides trying this AA thing or else eliminating your map, so you spend
         the day killing every last bit of every Substance you\x{2019}ve got in one last joyless bitter
         farewell binge and resolve, the next day, to go ahead and swallow your pride and maybe
         your common sense too and try these meetings of this \x{2018}Program\x{2019} that at best is probably
         just Unitarian happy horseshit and at worst is a cover for some glazed and canny cult-type
         thing where they\x{2019}ll keep you sober by making you spend twenty hours a day selling
         cellophane cones of artificial flowers on the median strips of heavy-flow roads. And
         what defines this cliffish nexus of exactly two total choices, this miserable road-fork
         Boston AA calls your Bottom, is that at this point you feel like maybe selling flowers
         on median strips might not be so bad, not compared to what you\x{2019}ve got going, personally,
         at this juncture. And this, at root, is what unites Boston AA: it turns out this same
         resigned, miserable, brainwash-and-exploit-me-if-that\x{2019}s-what-it-takes-type desperation
         has been the jumping-off place for just about every AA you meet, it emerges, once
         you\x{2019}ve actually gotten it up to stop darting in and out of the big meetings and start
         walking up with your wet hand out and trying to actually personally meet some Boston
         AAs. As the one particular tough old guy or lady you\x{2019}re always particularly scared
         of and drawn to says, nobody ever Comes In because things were going really well and
         they just wanted to round out their P.M. social calendar. Everybody, but everybody Comes In dead-eyed and puke-white and with their face hanging down around their knees
         and with a well-thumbed firearm-and-ordnance mail-order catalogue kept safe and available
         at home, map-wise, for when this last desperate resort of hugs and clich\x{e9}s turns out
         to be just happy horseshit, for you. You are not unique, they\x{2019}ll say: this initial
         hopelessness unites every soul in this broad cold salad-bar\x{2019}d hall. They are like

         up considerably at 30 days clean when he found he could raise his big mitt in Beginner

         the AAs and how they all seem like limp smug moronic self-satisfied shit-eating pricks

         the boot at AA, how they\x{2019}d pleaded for honest sharing of innermost feelings and OK
         he\x{2019}d honestly shared his deepest feelings on the matter of them and the grinning hypocrites had shaken their fists and told him to screw\x{2026} and but
         so in the meetings the poison would leap and spurt from him, and how but he found
         out all that these veteran White Flaggers would do as a Group when he like vocally
         wished them harm was nod furiously in empathetic Identification and shout with maddening
         cheer \x{2018}Keep Coming!\x{2019} and one or two Flaggers with medium amounts of sober time would
         come up to him after the meeting and say how it was so good to hear him share and
         holy mackerel could they ever Identify with the deeply honest feelings he\x{2019}d shared and how he\x{2019}d
         done them the service of giving them the gift of a real \x{2018}Remember-When\x{2019}-type experience
         because they could now remember feeling just exactly the same way as Gately, when
         they first Came In, only they confess not then having the spine to honestly share
         it with the Group, and so in a bizarre improbable twist they\x{2019}d have Gately ending
         up standing there feeling like some sort of AA hero, a prodigy of vitriolic spine,
         both frustrated and elated, and before they bid him orevwar and told him to come back
         they\x{2019}d make sure to give him their phone numbers on the back of their little raffle
         tickets, phone numbers Gately wouldn\x{2019}t dream of actually calling up (to say what, for chrissakes?) but which he found he rather liked having in his wallet, to just
         carry around, just in case of who knew what; and then plus maybe one of these old
         Enfield-native White Flag guys with geologic amounts of sober time in AA and a twisted
         ruined old body and clear bright-white eyes would hobble sideways like a crab slowly
         up to Gately after a meeting in which he\x{2019}d spewed vitriol and reach way up to clap
         him on his big sweaty shoulder and say in their fremitic smoker\x{2019}s croak that Well
         you at least seem like a ballsy little bastard, all full of piss and vinegar and whatnot,
         and that just maybe you\x{2019}ll be OK, Don G., just maybe, just Keep Coming, and, if you\x{2019}d
         care for a spot of advice from somebody who likely spilled more booze in his day than
         you\x{2019}ve even consumed in yours, you might try to just simply sit down at meetings and
         relax and take the cotton out of your ears and put it in your mouth and shut the fuck
         up and just listen, for the first time perhaps in your life really listen, and maybe you\x{2019}ll end up OK; and they don\x{2019}t offer their phone numbers, not the really
         old guys, Gately knows he\x{2019}d have to eat his pride raw and actually request the numbers of the old ruined grim calm longtimers in White Flag, \x{2018}The Crocodiles\x{2019}
         the less senior White Flaggers call them, because the old twisted guys all tend to
         sit clustered together with hideous turd-like cigars in one corner of the Provident
         cafeteria under a 16 X 20 framed glossy of crocodiles or alligators sunning themselves
         on some verdant riverbank somewhere, with the maybe-joke legend OLD-TIMERS CORNER
         somebody had magisculed across the bottom of the photo, and these old guys cluster
         together under it, rotating their green cigars in their misshapen fingers and discussing
         completely mysterious long-sober matters out of the sides of their mouths. Gately
         sort of fears these old AA guys with their varicose noses and flannel shirts and white
         crew cuts and brown teeth and coolly amused looks of appraisal, feels like a kind
         of low-rank tribal knucklehead in the presence of stone-faced chieftains who rule
         by some unspoken shamanistic fiat, 137 and so of course he hates them, the Crocodiles, for making him feel like he fears
         them, but oddly he also ends up looking forward a little to sitting in the same big
         nursing-home cafeteria with them and facing the same direction they face, every Sunday,
         and a little later finds he even enjoys riding at 30 kph tops in their perfectly maintained
         25-year-old sedans when he starts going along on White Flag Commitments to other Boston
         AA Groups. He eventually heeds a terse suggestion and starts going out and telling
         his grisly personal story publicly from the podium with other members of White Flag,
         the Group he gave in and finally officially joined. This is what you do if you\x{2019}re
         new and have what\x{2019}s called The Gift of Desperation and are willing to go to any excruciating
         lengths to stay straight, you officially join a Group and put your name and sobriety-date
         down on the Group secretary\x{2019}s official roster, and you make it your business to start
         to get to know other members of the Group on a personal basis, and you carry their
         numbers talismanically in your wallet; and, most important, you get Active With Your
         Group, which here in Gately\x{2019}s Boston AA Active means not just sweeping the footprinty floor after the Lord\x{2019}s Prayer and making coffee
         and emptying ashtrays of gasper-butts and ghastly spit-wet cigar ends but also showing
         up regularly at specified P.M. times at the White Flag Group\x{2019}s regular haunt, the Elit (the final e\x{2019}s neon\x{2019}s ballast\x{2019}s out) Diner next to Steve\x{2019}s Donuts in Enfield Center, showing up
         and pounding down tooth-loosening amounts of coffee and then getting in well-maintained
         Crocodilian sedans whose suspensions\x{2019} springs Gately\x{2019}s mass makes sag and getting
         driven, wall-eyed with caffeine and cigar fumes and general public-speaking angst,
         to like Lowell\x{2019}s Joy of Living Group or Charlestown\x{2019}s Plug In The Jug Group or Bridgewater
         State Detox or Concord Honor Farm with these guys, and except for one or two other
         pale wall-eyed newcomers with The Gift of utter Desperation it\x{2019}s mostly Crocodiles
         with geologic sober time in these cars, it\x{2019}s mostly the guys that\x{2019}ve stayed sober
         in White Flag for decades who still go on every single booked Commitment, they go
         every time, dependable as death, even when the Celtics are on Spontaneous-Dis they
         hit the old Commitment trail, they remain rabidly Active With Their Group; and the
         Crocodiles in the car invite Gately to see the coincidence of long-term contented
         sobriety and rabidly tireless AA Activity as not a coincidence at all. The backs of
         their necks are complexly creased. The Crocodiles up front look into the rearview
         mirror and narrow their baggy bright-white eyes at Gately in the sagging backseat
         with the other new guys, and the Crocodiles say they can\x{2019}t even begin to say how many
         new guys they\x{2019}ve seen Come In and then get sucked back Out There, Come In to AA for
         a while and Hang In and put together a little sober time and have things start to
         get better, head-wise and life-quality-wise, and after a while the new guys get cocky,
         they decide they\x{2019}ve gotten \x{2018}Well,\x{2019} and they get really busy at the new job sobriety\x{2019}s allowed them to get, or maybe
         they buy season Celtics tickets, or they rediscover pussy and start chasing pussy
         (these withered gnarled toothless totally post-sexual old fuckers actually say pussy), but one way or another these poor cocky clueless new bastards start gradually drifting
         away from rabid Activity In The Group, and then away from their Group itself, and
         then little by little gradually drift away from any AA meetings at all, and then,
         without the protection of meetings or a Group, in time\x{2014}oh there\x{2019}s always plenty of
         time, the Disease is fiendishly patient\x{2014}how in time they forget what it was like,
         the ones that\x{2019}ve cockily drifted, they forget who and what they are, they forget about
         the Disease, until like one day they\x{2019}re at like maybe a Celtics-Sixers game, and the
         good old Fleet/First Interstate Center\x{2019}s hot, and they think what could just one cold
         foamer hurt, after all this sober time, now that they\x{2019}ve gotten \x{2018}Well.\x{2019} Just one cold one. What could it hurt. And after that one it\x{2019}s like they\x{2019}d never
         stopped, if they\x{2019}ve got the Disease. And how in a month or six months or a year they
         have to Come Back In, back to the Boston AA halls and their old Group, tottering, D.T.ing, with their
         faces hanging down around their knees all over again, or maybe it\x{2019}s five or ten years
         before they can get it up to get back In, beaten to shit again, or else their system
         isn\x{2019}t ready for the recurred abuse again after some sober time and they die Out There\x{2014}the
         Crocodiles are always talking in hushed, \x{2019}Nam-like tones about Out There\x{2014}or else, worse, maybe they kill somebody in a blackout and spend the rest of their
         lives in MCI-Walpole drinking raisin jack fermented in the seatless toilet and trying
         to recall what they did to get in there, Out There; or else, worst of all, these cocky

         Out There and died, or not gotten to die. They even point some of these guys out\x{2014}gaunt

         drooling and incontinent under exquisite mother-bought fashions specially altered
         for atrophy and top-shelf Lanc\x{f4}me cosmetics that looked just lurid on It, and with only the whites of Its eyes showing, with fluid dribbling from Its
         mouth and elsewhere, and making unspeakable gurgly noises, completely pale and moist
         and stagnant; and then, when the adopted daughter now speaking turned fifteen, the
         rabidly Catholic wacko foster mother even announced that OK now that the adopted daughter
         was fifteen she could go out on dates, but only as long as It got to come along too,
         in other words that the only dates the fifteen-year-old adopted daughter could go
         out on were double dates with It and whatever submammalian escort the speaker could
         root up for It; and how this sort of stuff went on and on; and how the nightmarishness
         of Its continual pale soggy ubiquitousness in her young life would alone be more than
         sufficient to cause and explain the speaker\x{2019}s later drug addiction, she feels, but
         that also it so happened that the foster family\x{2019}s quiet smiling patriarch, who worked
         <<0900|18:1>> to 2100 as a claims processor for Aetna, it turned out that the cheerful smiling
         foster father actually made the wacko foster mother look like a Doric column of stability
         by comparison, because there turned out to be things about the biological daughter\x{2019}s
         utter paralytic pliability and catatonic inability to make anything except unspeakable
         gurgly noises that the smiling father found greatly to a certain very sick advantage
         the speaker says she has trouble openly discussing, still, even at thirty-one months
         sober in AA, being as yet still so retroactively Wounded and Hurting from it; but
         so in sum that she\x{2019}d been ultimately forced to run away from the adoptive foster Saugus
         home and so become a Naked-I stripper and so become a raging dope fiend not, as in
         so many ununique cases, because she had been incestuously diddled, but because she\x{2019}d
         been abusively forced to share a bedroom with a drooling invertebrate who by fourteen
         was Itself getting incestuously diddled on a nightly basis by a smiling biological claims processor
         of a father who\x{2014}the speaker pauses to summon courage\x{2014}who apparently liked to pretend
         It was Raquel Welch, the former celluloid sex goddess of the father\x{2019}s glandular heyday,
         and he even called It \x{2018}RAQUEL!\x{2019} in moments of incestuous extremity; and how, the New England summer the speaker
         turned fifteen and had to start dragging It along on double dates and then having
         to make sure to drag It back home again by <<2300h|1>>. so It had plenty of time to be incestuously
         diddled, that summer the smiling quiet foster father even bought, had found somewhere,
         a cheesy rubber Raquel Welch full-head pull-on mask, with hair, and would now nightly come in in the dark and lift Its limp soft head
         up and struggle and lug to get the mask on and the relevant holes aligned for air,
         and then would diddle his way to extremity and cry out \x{2018}RAQUEL!\x{2019} and then but he would just clamber out and off and leave the dark bedroom smiling
         and sated and lots of times leave the mask still on It, he\x{2019}d like forget, or not care, just as he seemed oblivious (But For the Grace
         of God, in a way) to the fetally curled skinny form of the adopted daughter lying
         perfectly still in the next bed, in the dark, pretending to sleep, silent, shell-breathing,
         with her hard skinny wounded pre-addiction face turned to the wall, in the room\x{2019}s
         next bed, her bed, the one without the collapsible crib-like hospital railings along
         the sides\x{2026}. The audience is clutching its collective head, by this time only partly
         in empathy, as the speaker specifies how she was de facto emotionally all but like
         forced to flee and strip and swan-dive into the dark spiritual anesthesia of active drug
         addiction in a dysfunctional attempt to psychologically deal with one particular seminally
         scarring night of abject horror, the indescribable horror of the way It, the biological
         daughter, had looked up at her, the speaker, one particular final time on this one
         particular one of the frequent occasions the speaker had to get out of bed after the
         father had come and gone and tiptoe over to Its bed and lean over the cold metal hospital
         railing and remove the rubber Raquel Welch mask and replace it in a bedside drawer
         under some back issues of Ramparts and Commonweal, after carefully closing Its splayed legs and pulling down Its variously-stained designer
         nightie, all of which she made sure to do when the father didn\x{2019}t bother to, at night,
         so that the wacko foster mother wouldn\x{2019}t come in in the A.M. and find It in a rubber Raquel Welch mask with Its nightie hiked up and Its legs
         agape and put two and two together and get all kinds of deep Denial shattered about
         why the foster father always went around the foster house with a silent creepy smile,
         and flip out and make the invertebrate catatonic\x{2019}s father stop diddling It\x{2014}because,
         the speaker figured, if the foster father had to stop diddling It it didn\x{2019}t exactly
         take Sally Jessy Raphael M.S.W. to figure out who was then probably going to get promoted
         to the role of Raquel, over in the next bed. The silent smiling claims-processor father
         never once acknowledged the adopted daughter\x{2019}s little post-incestuous tidyings-up.
         It\x{2019}s the kind of sick unspoken complicity characteristic of wildly dysfunctional families,
         confides the speaker, who\x{2019}s also proud she says to be a member of a splinter 12-Step
         Fellowship, an Adult-Child-type thing called Wounded, Hurting, Inadequately Nurtured
         but Ever-Recovering Survivors. But so she says it was this one particular night soon
         after she\x{2019}d turned sixteen, after the father had come and gone and uncaringly just
         left Its mask on again, and over to Its bedside the speaker had to creep in the dark,
         to tidy up, and but this time it turned out there was a problem with the Raquel Welch
         mask\x{2019}s long auburn horsehair tresses having gotten twisted and knotted into the semi-living
         strands of Its own elaborately overmoussed coiffure, and the adopted daughter had
         to activate the perimeter of lights on Its bedside table\x{2019}s many-bulbed vanity mirror
         to see to try to get the Raquel Welch wig untangled, and when she finally got the
         mask off, with the vanity mirror still blazing away, the speaker says how she was
         forced to gaze for the first time on Its lit-up paralytic post-diddle face, and how
         the expression thereon was most assuredly quite enough to force anybody with an operant
         limbic system 142 to leg it right out of her dysfunctional foster family\x{2019}s home, nay and the whole
         community of Saugus MA, now homeless and scarred and forced by dark psychic forces
         straight to Route 1\x{2019}s infamous gauntlet of neon-lit depravity and addiction, to try
         and forget, rasa the tabula, wipe the memory totally out, numb it with opiates. Voice
         trembling, she accepts the chairperson\x{2019}s proffered bandanna-hankie and blows her nose
         one nostril at a time and says she can almost see It all over again: Its expression:
         in the vanity\x{2019}s lights only Its eyes\x{2019} whites showed, and while Its utter catatonia
         and paralysis prevented the contraction of Its luridly rouged face\x{2019}s circumoral muscles
         into any conventional human facial-type expression, nevertheless some hideously mobile
         and expressive layer in the moist regions below real people\x{2019}s expressive facial layer,
         some slow-twitch layer unique to It, had blindly contracted, somehow, to gather the
         blank soft cheese of Its face into the sort of pinched gasping look of neurologic
         concentration that marks a carnal bliss beyond smiles or sighs. Its face looked post-coital
         sort of the way you\x{2019}d imagine the vacuole and optica of a protozoan looking post-coital
         after it\x{2019}s shuddered and shot its mono-cellular load into the cold waters of some
         really old sea. Its facial expression was, in a word, the speaker says, unspeakably,
         unforgettably ghastly and horrid and scarring. It was also the exact same expression
         as the facial expression on the stone-robed lady\x{2019}s face in this one untitled photo
         of some Catholic statue that hung (the photo) in the dysfunctional household\x{2019}s parlor
         right above the little teak table where the dysfunctional foster mother kept her beads
         and Hours and lay breviary, this photo of a statue of a woman whose stone robes were
         half hiked up and wrinkled in the most godawfully sensually prurient way, the woman
         reclined against uncut rock, her robes hiked and one stone foot hanging off the rock
         as her legs hung parted, with a grinning little totally psychotic-looking cherub-type
         angel standing on the lady\x{2019}s open thighs and pointing a bare arrow at where the stone
         robe hid her cold tit, the woman\x{2019}s face upturned and cocked and pinched into that
         exact same shuddering-protozoan look beyond pleasure or pain. The wacko foster mom
         knelt daily to that photo, in a beaded and worshipful posture, and also required daily
         that It be hoisted by the adopted daughter from Its never-mentioned wheelchair and
         held under Its arms and lowered so as to approximate the same knelt devotion to the
         photo, and while It gurgled and Its head lolled the speaker had gazed at the photo
         with a nameless revulsion each morning as she held Its dead slumped weight and tried
         to keep Its chin off Its chest, and now was being forced into seeing by mirror-light
         the exact same expression on the face of a catatonic who\x{2019}d just been incestuously
         diddled, an expression at once reverent and greedy on a face connected by dead hair
         to the slack and flapping rubber visage of an old sex goddess\x{2019}s empty face. And to
         make a long story short (the speaker says, not trying to be funny as far as the Flaggers
         can see), the traumatically scarred adopted girl had legged it from the bedroom and
         foster house into the brooding North Shore teen-runaway night, and had stripped and
         semi-whored and IV-injected her way all the way to that standard two-option addicted
         cliff-edge, hoping only to Forget. That\x{2019}s what caused it, she says; that\x{2019}s what she\x{2019}s
         trying to recover from, a Day at a Time, and she\x{2019}s sure grateful to be here with her
         Group today, sober and courageously remembering, and newcomers should definitely Keep
         Coming\x{2026}. As she\x{2019}s telling what she sees as etiological truth, even though the monologue
         seems sincere and unaffected and at least a B+ on the overall AA-story lucidity-scale,
         faces in the hall are averted and heads clutched and postures uneasily shifted in
         empathetic distress at the look-what-happened-to-poor-me invitation implicit in the
         tale, the talk\x{2019}s tone of self-pity itself less offensive (even though plenty of these
         White Flaggers, Gately knows, had personal childhoods that made this girl\x{2019}s look like
         a day at Six Flags Over the Poconos) than the subcurrent of explanation, an appeal
         to exterior Cause that can slide, in the addictive mind, so insidiously into Excuse that any causal attribution is in Boston AA feared, shunned, punished by empathic
         distress. The Why of the Disease is a labyrinth it is strongly suggested all AAs boycott, inhabited
         as the maze is by the twin minotaurs of Why Me? and Why Not?, a.k.a. Self-Pity and Denial, two of the smily-faced Sergeant at Arms\x{2019} more fearsome
         aides de camp. The Boston AA \x{2018}In Here\x{2019} that protects against a return to \x{2018}Out There\x{2019}
         is not about explaining what caused your Disease. It\x{2019}s about a goofily simple practical
         recipe for how to remember you\x{2019}ve got the Disease day by day and how to treat the
         Disease day by day, how to keep the seductive ghost of a bliss long absconded from
         baiting you and hooking you and pulling you back Out and eating your heart raw and
         (if you\x{2019}re lucky) eliminating your map for good. So no whys or wherefores allowed.
         In other words check your head at the door. Though it can\x{2019}t be conventionally enforced,
         this, Boston AA\x{2019}s real root axiom, is almost classically authoritarian, maybe even
         proto-Fascist. Some ironist who decamped back Out There and left his meager effects
         to be bagged and tossed by Staff into the Ennet House attic had, all the way back
         in the Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad, permanently engraved his tribute to AA\x{2019}s real

         no eyelashes at all and a \x{2019}base-head\x{2019}s ruined teeth, gets up there and speaks in an
         r-less South Boston brogue about being pregnant at twenty and smoking Eightballs of
         freebase cocaine like a fiend all through her pregnancy even though she knew it was
         bad for the baby and wanted desperately to quit. She tells about having her water
         break and contractions start late one night in her welfare-hotel room when she was
         right in the middle of an Eightball she\x{2019}d had to spend the evening turning unbelievably
         sordid and degrading tricks to pay for; she did what she had to do to get high, she
         says, even while pregnant, she says; and she says even when the pain of the contractions
         got to be too bad to bear she\x{2019}d been unable to tear herself away from the \x{2019}base-pipe
         to go to the free clinic to deliver, and how she\x{2019}d sat on the floor of the welfare-hotel
         room and freebased her way all through labor (that new Joelle girl\x{2019}s veil\x{2019}s billowing
         in and out with her breath, Gately sees, just like it also was during the last speaker\x{2019}s
         description of the statue\x{2019}s orgasm in the catatonic\x{2019}s dysfunctional Catholic mother\x{2019}s
         devotional photo); and how she\x{2019}d finally delivered of a stillborn infant right there
         alone on her side like a cow on the rug of her room, all the time throughout still
         compulsively loading up the glass pipe and smoking; and how the infant emerged all
         dry and hard like a constipated turdlet, with no protective moisture and no afterbirth-material
         following it out, and how the emerged infant was tiny and dry and all withered and
         the color of strong tea, and dead, and also had no face, had in utero developed no
         eyes or nostrils and just a little lipless hyphen of a mouth, and its limbs were malformed
         and arachnodactylic, and there had been some sort of translucent reptilian like webbing
         between its mucronate digits; the speaker\x{2019}s mouth is a quivering arch of woe; her
         baby had been poisoned before it could grow a face or make any personal choices, it
         would have soon died of Substance-Withdrawal in the free clinic\x{2019}s Pyrex incubator
         if it had emerged alive anyway, she could tell, she\x{2019}d been on such a bad \x{2019}base-binge
         all that pregnant year; and but so eventually the Eightball was consumed and then
         the screen and steel-wool ball in the pipe itself smoked and the cloth prep-filter
         smoked to ash and then of course likely-looking pieces of lint had been gleaned off
         the rug and also smoked, and the girl finally passed out, still umbilically linked
         to the dead infant; and how when she came to again in unsparing noonlight the next
         day and saw what still clung by a withered cord to her empty insides she got introduced
         to the real business-end of the arrow of responsibility, and as she gazed in daylight
         at the withered faceless stillborn baby she was so overcome with grief and self-loathing
         that she erected a fortification of complete and black Denial, like total Denial.
         She held and swaddled the dead thing just as if it were alive instead of dead, and
         she began to carry it around with her wherever she went, just as she imagined devoted
         mothers carry their babies with them everywhere they go, the faceless infant\x{2019}s corpse
         completely veiled and hidden in a little pink blanket the addicted expectant mother\x{2019}d
         let herself buy at Woolworth\x{2019}s at seven months, and she also kept the cord\x{2019}s connection
         intact until her end of the cord finally fell out of her and dangled, and smelled,
         and she carried the dead infant everywhere, even when turning sordid tricks, because
         single motherhood or not she still needed to get high and still had to do what she
         had to do to get high, so she carried the blanket-wrapped infant in her arms as she
         walked the streets in her velvet fuchsia minipants and haltertop and green spike heels,
         turning tricks, until there began to be strong evidence, as she circled her block\x{2014}it
         was August\x{2014}let\x{2019}s just say compelling evidence that the infant in the stained cocoon
         of blanket in her arms was not a biologically viable infant, and passersby on the
         South Boston streets began to reel away white-faced as the girl passed by, stretch-marked
         and brown-toothed and lashless (lashes lost in a Substance-accident; fire hazard and
         dental dysplasia go with the freebase terrain) and also just hauntedly calm-looking,
         oblivious to the olfactory havoc she was wreaking in the sweltering streets, and but
         her August\x{2019}s trick-business soon fell off sharply, understandably, and eventually
         word that there was a serious infant-and-Denial problem here got around the streets,
         and her fellow Southie \x{2019}base-heads and street-friends came to her with not ungentle
         r-less remonstrances and scented hankies and gently prying hands and tried to reason
         her out of her Denial, but she ignored them all, she guarded her infant from all harm
         and kept it clutched to her\x{2014}it was by now sort of stuck to her and would have been
         hard to separate from her by hand anyway\x{2014}and she\x{2019}d walk the streets shunned and trickless
         and broke and in early-stage Substance-Withdrawal, with the remains of the dead infant\x{2019}s
         tummy\x{2019}s cord dangling out from an unclosable fold in the now ominously ballooned and
         crusty Woolworth\x{2019}s blanket: talk about Denial, this girl was in some major-league
         Denial; and but finally a pale and reeling beat-cop phoned a hysterical olfactory

         alcoholic moms all over the hall cross themselves and shudder at the mere mention

         abstruse legal definitions of Neglect and the tungsten-tipped battering ram for triple-locked
         apartment doors; in a dark window Gately sees one reflected mom sitting over with
         the Brighton AAs that has her two little girls with her in the meeting and now at
         the D.S.S. reference clutches them reflexively to her bosom, one head per bosom, as
         one of the girls struggles and dips her knees in the little curtsies of impending
         potty\x{2014}but so now D.S.S. was on the case, and a platoon of blandly efficient Wellesley-alum
         D.S.S. field personnel with clipboards and scary black Chanel women\x{2019}s businesswear
         were now on the prowl in the South Boston streets for the addicted speaker and her
         late faceless infant; and but finally around this time, during last year\x{2019}s awful late-August
         heat wave, evidence that the infant had a serious bio-viability problem started presenting
         itself so forcefully that even the Denial-ridden addict in the mother could not ignore
         or dismiss it\x{2014}evidence which the speaker\x{2019}s reticence about describing (save to say
         that it involved an insect-attraction problem) makes things all the worse for the
         empathetic White Flaggers, since it engages the dark imaginations all Substance-abusers
         share in surplus\x{2014}and so but the mother says how she finally broke down, emotionally
         and olfactorily, from the overwhelming evidence, on the cement playground outside
         her own late mother\x{2019}s abandoned Project building off the L Street Beach in Southie,
         and a D.S.S. field team closed in for the pinch, and she and her infant got pinched,
         and special D.S.S. spray-solvents had to be sent for and utilized in order to detach
         the Woolworth baby-blanket from her maternal bosom, and the blanket\x{2019}s contents were
         more or less reassembled and were interred in a D.S.S. coffin the speaker recalls
         as being the size of a Mary Kay makeup case, and the speaker was medically informed
         by somebody with a clipboard from D.S.S. that the infant had been involuntarily toxified
         to death somewhere along in its development toward becoming a boy; and the mother,
         after a painful D&C for the impacted placenta she\x{2019}d carried inside, then spent the
         next four months on the locked ward of Metropolitan State Hospital in Waltham MA,
         psychotic with Denial-deferred guilt and cocaine-withdrawal and searing self-hatred;

         check she found she had no taste for chunks or powders, she wanted only tall smooth
         bottles whose labels spoke of Proof, and she drank and drank and believed in her heart
         she would never stop or swallow the truth, but finally she got to where she had to,
         she says, swallow it, the responsible truth; how she quickly drank her way to the
         old two-option welfare-hotel window-ledge and made a blubbering <<0200h|1>>. phone call,
         and then so here she is, apologizing for going on so long, trying to tell a truth
         she hopes someday to swallow, inside. So she can just try and live. When she concludes
         by asking them to pray for her it almost doesn\x{2019}t sound corny. Gately tries not to
         think. Here is no Cause or Excuse. It is simply what happened. This final speaker
         is truly new, ready: all defenses have been burned away. Smooth-skinned and steadily
         pinker, at the podium, her eyes squeezed tight, she looks like she\x{2019}s the one that\x{2019}s
         the infant. The host White Flaggers pay this burnt public husk of a newcomer the ultimate
         Boston AA compliment: they have to consciously try to remember even to blink as they
         watch her, listening. I.D.ing without effort. There\x{2019}s no judgment. It\x{2019}s clear she\x{2019}s
         been punished enough. And it was basically the same all over, after all, Out There.
         And the fact that it was so good to hear her, so good that even Tiny Ewell and Kate
         Gompert and the rest of the worst of them all sat still and listened without blinking,
         looking not just at the speaker\x{2019}s face but into it, helps force Gately to remember
         all over again what a tragic adventure this is, that none of them signed up for.",

            "Clipperton\x{2019}s first meaningless victory ever came at sixteen, unseeded, at the Hartford
         Jr. Open, first round, against one Ross Reat, of Maddox OH and the just-opened Enfield
         Tennis Academy. For some reason it\x{2019}s Struck who sort of specializes in this story
         and never misses a chance to tell new E.T.A.s the tale of Clipperton v. Reat. Clipperton\x{2019}s
         an OK player, nothing spectacular but also not like absurdly out of place at a regional-grade
         tourney; but Reat is at fifteen seasoned and high-ranked, and the third seed at Hartford;
         and Reat is, for a while\x{2014}as would be S.O.P. for a high seed in the first round\x{2014}basically
         cleaning under his nails with this unseeded unknown Eric Clipperton. At <<1|9m:1>>\x{2013}4 in the
         second set, Clipperton sits down at the side-change and, instead of toweling off,
         reaches into his gear bag and extracts his classy little blond-wood case and gets
         out the Glock 17. Fondles it. Takes out the clip and hefts it and rams it home in
         its slot at the base of the grip with a chillingly solid-sounding click. Caresses
         his left temple with the thing\x{2019}s blunt shiny barrel. Everybody watching the match
         agrees it is one ugly and all-business-looking piece of personal-defense hardware.
         Clipperton climbs up the rungs of the lifeguardish chair the umpire in his blue blazer
         158 sits in and uses the umpire\x{2019}s mike to make public his intention of blowing his personal
         brains out all over the court with the hideous Glock, should he lose. The small first-round
         gallery stiffens and inhales and doesn\x{2019}t exhale for a long time. Reat audibly gulps.
         Reat is tall, densely freckled, a good kid, one of Incandenza\x{2019}s fair-haired boys,
         not too bright, with the Satellite Tour so clearly in his future that at only fifteen
         he\x{2019}s already starting cholera shots and mastering Third World exchange rates. And
         but for the remainder of the match (which lasts exactly eleven more games) Clipperton
         plays tennis with the Glock 17 held steadily to his left temple. The gun makes tossing
         kind of a hassle, on Clipperton\x{2019}s serve, but Reat is letting the serves go by untouched
         anyway. None of the E.T.A. staff has bothered to show up and coach Reat through what
         was supposed to be a standard first-round fingernail-cleaning, and so Reat is strategically
         and emotionally all alone out there, and he\x{2019}s opted for not even pretending to make
         an effort, given what the unseeded Clipperton seems willing to sacrifice for a win.
         Ross Reat was the first and last junior player ever to shake Clipperton\x{2019}s free hand
         at the end of a match, and the moment\x{2019}s captured in a Hartford Courant staff photo that some E.T.A. wiseacre\x{2019}d later glued to the door of Struck\x{2019}s room
         with so much Elmer\x{2019}s all over the back that taking it off would gut the varnish, so
         the thing stays up for all in the hall to see, Reat here up at net on one knee, one
         arm over his eyes, the other hand extended upward to a Clipperton who\x{2019}d simply obliterated
         him psychologically. And Ross Reat was never quite exactly the same ever again after
         that, both Schtitt and deLint have assured all future potentially mercy-minded E.T.A.
         males.",

         summer, of Subsidized Time, the adverted Year of the Whopper, when the U.S.T.A. became
         the O.N.A.N.T.A, and some Mexican systems analyst\x{2014}who barely spoke English and had
         never once even fondled a ball and knew from exactly zilch except for crunching raw

         of six major junior-tournament championships that spring as sanctioned and real. And
         when the first biweekly issue of the trilingual North American Junior Tennis that\x{2019}s replaced American Junior Tennis comes out, there\x{2019}s one E. R. Clipperton, Home Town \x{2018}Ind.,\x{2019} ranked #1 in Boys\x{2019} Continental
         18-and-Unders; and competitive eyebrows ascend at all latitudes; and but everyone
         at E.T.A., from Schtitt on down, is highly amused, and some of them wonder whether
         maybe now Eric Clipperton will put down his psychic cuirass and take his unarmed competitive
         chances with the rest of them, now that he\x{2019}s got what he\x{2019}s surely been burning over
         and holding himself hostage for all along, a real and sanctioned #1; and the Continental
         Jr. Clay-Courts are coming up the following week, in Indianapolis IN, and little Michael
         Pemulis of Allston takes his PowerBook and odds-software and makes a killing on vig
         in the frenzy of locker-room wagering over whether Clipperton\x{2019}ll even bother to materialize
         at Indy now that he\x{2019}s extorted himself to the sanctioned top he must have craved so
         terribly, or whether he\x{2019}ll retire from the tour now and lie around masturbating over
         the Glock in one hand and the latest issue of NAJT in the other. 175 And so everyone\x{2019}s taken aback when Eric Clipperton of all people suddenly appears
         at the E.T.A. front gate\x{2019}s portcullis on a rainy warm late A.M. two days before the Clays, wearing a flap-frayed trench-type coat and toe-abraded
         sneakers and a five-day growth of armpitty adolescent beard, but without any sticks
         or anything in the way of competitive gear, not even his Glock 17\x{2019}s custom-made wooden
         case, and he makes the cold-eyed part-time portcullis attendant from the halfway place
         down the hill just about lean on the intercom-buzzer, pleading for entry and counsel\x{2014}he\x{2019}s
         in a terrible way, is the portcullis attendant\x{2019}s intercom diagnosis\x{2014}and rules about
         nonenrolled jr. players being on academies\x{2019} grounds are strict and complex, and but
         little Mario Incandenza sways down the steep path to the portcullis in the warm rain
         and interfaces with Clipperton through the bars and has the attendant hold the intercom-button
         down for him and personally requests that Clipperton be admitted under a special nonplay
         codicil to the regulations, saying the kid is truly in desperate psychic straits,
         Mario speaking first to Lateral Alice Moore and then to this prorector Cantrell and
         then to the Headmaster himself as Clipperton stares wordlessly up at the little wrought-iron
         racquet-heads that serve as spikes at the top of the portcullis and fencing around
         E.T.A., his expression so blackly haunted that even the hard-boiled attendant told
         some of the people back at the halfway place later that the spectral trench-coated
         figure had given him sobriety\x{2019}s worst fantods, so far; and J. O. Incandenza finally
         lets Clipperton in over Cantrell\x{2019}s and then Schtitt\x{2019}s vehement objections when it\x{2019}s
         established that Clipperton wants only a few private minutes to obtain the counsel
         of Incandenza Sr. himself\x{2014}of whom I think we can presume Mario\x{2019}s spoken glowingly
         to Clipperton\x{2014}and Incandenza, while not quite strictly sober, is lucid, and has a
         very low melting-point of compassion for traumas connected with early success; and
         so up goes the portcullis, and the Clipperton and the two Incandenzas go at <<high noon|13>>
         up to an unused top-floor room in Subdorm C of East House, the structure nearest the
         front gate, for some sort of psycho-existential CPR-session or something\x{2014}Mario has
         never spoken of what he got to sit in on, not even at night to Hal when Hal\x{2019}s trying
         to go to sleep. But it\x{2019}s a matter of record that at some point first E.T.A. counselor
         Dolores Rusk was beeped by Himself at her Winchester home and then her beep was canceled
         and Lateral Alice Moore was beeped and asked with due speed to get Lyle up from the
         weight room/sauna and over to East House ASAP, and that at some point while Lyle was
         delotusing from the dispenser and making his way with sideways Lateral Alice to this
         emergency-type huddle, at some point in this interval\x{2014}in front of Dr. James O. Incandenza
         and a Mario whose tiny borrowed head-clamped Bolex H128 Incandenza required Clipperton
         to consent to having digitally record the whole crisis-conversation, to protect E.T.A.
         from the O.N.A.N.T.A.\x{2019}s Kafkaesque rules on unregistered recipients of any sort of
         counsel at U.S. academies\x{2014}at some point, w/ Lyle in transit, Clipperton pulls out
         of various pockets in his wet complicated coat an elaborately altered copy of NAJT\x{2019}s biweekly ranking report, a sepia\x{2019}d snapshot of some whey-faced Midwestern couple\x{2019}s
         wedding, and the hideous blunt-barreled Glock 17 9 mm. semiautomatic, which even as
         both Incandenzas reach for the sky Clipperton places to his right\x{2014}not left\x{2014}temple,
         as in with his good right stick-hand, closes his eyes and scrunches up his face and
         blows his legitimated brains out for real and all time, eradicates his map and then
         some; and there\x{2019}s just an ungodly subsequent mess in there, and the Incandenzas respectively
         stagger and totter from the room all green-gilled and red-mist-stained, and\x{2014}because
         reports of Lyle\x{2019}s appearance outside the weight room upright and walking across the
         grounds have spread and caused enormous excitement and student-snapshots\x{2014}it\x{2019}s because

         a stroke during the D.T.s <<one A.M.|5>> that she\x{2019}d been able to Surrender and Come In with the requisite hopeless desperation,

            "About four months into his Ennet House residency, the agonizing desire to ingest synthetic
         narcotics had been mysteriously magically removed from Don Gately, just like the House
         Staff and the Crocodiles at the White Flag Group had said it would if he pounded out
         the nightly meetings and stayed minimally open and willing to persistently ask some
         extremely vague Higher Power to remove it. The desire. They said to get creakily down
         on his mammoth knees in the A.M. every day and ask God As He Understood Him to remove the agonizing desire, and to
         hit the old knees again at night before sack and thank this God-ish figure for the
         Substanceless day just ended, if he got through it. They suggested he keep his shoes
         and keys under the bed to help him remember to get on his knees. The only times Gately
         had ever been on his knees before were to throw up or mate, or shunt a low-on-the-wall
         alarm, or if somebody got lucky during a beef and landed one near Gately\x{2019}s groin.
         He didn\x{2019}t have any God- or J.C.-background, and the knee-stuff seemed like the limpest
         kind of dickless pap, and he felt like a true hypocrite just going through the knee-motions
         that he went through faithfully every A.M. and P.M., without fail, motivated by a desire to get loaded so horrible that he often found
         himself humbly praying for his head to just finally explode already and get it over
         with. Pat had said it didn\x{2019}t matter at this point what he thought or believed or even
         said. All that mattered was what he did. If he did the right things, and kept doing them for long enough, what Gately thought
         and believed would magically change. Even what he said. She\x{2019}d seen it happen again
         and again, and to some awfully unlikely candidates for change. She said it had happened
         to her. The left side of her face was very alive and kind. And Gately\x{2019}s counselor,
         an ex-coke and -phone-bunko guy whose left ear had been one of his Losses, had hit
         Gately early on with the infamous Boston AA cake analogy. The grizzled Filipino had
         met with the resident Don G. once a week, driving Gately around Brighton-Allston in
         aimless circles in a customized Subaru 4\x{d7}4 just like the ones Gately used to hotwire
         and promote to use for burgling. Eugenio Martinez had this eccentric thing where he
         maintained he could only be in touch with his own Higher Power when he was driving.
         Down near E.W.D.\x{2019}s barge-docks off the Allston Spur one night he invited Gately to
         think of Boston AA as a box of Betty Crocker Cake Mix. Gately had smacked himself
         in the forehead at yet another limp oblique Gene M. analogy, which Gene had already
         bludgeoned him with several insectile tropes for thinking about the Disease. The counselor
         had let him vent spleen for a while, smoking as he crawled along behind land-barges
         lined up to unload. He told Gately to just imagine for a second that he\x{2019}s holding
         a box of Betty Crocker Cake Mix, which represented Boston AA. The box came with directions
         on the side any eight-year-old could read. Gately said he was waiting for the mention
         of some kind of damn insect inside the cake mix. Gene M. said all Gately had to do
         was for fuck\x{2019}s sake give himself a break and relax and for once shut up and just follow
         the directions on the side of the fucking box. It didn\x{2019}t matter one fuckola whether
         Gately like believed a cake would result, or whether he understood the like fucking baking-chemistry of how a cake would result: if he just followed the motherfucking directions, and had sense
         enough to get help from slightly more experienced bakers to keep from fucking the
         directions up if he got confused somehow, but basically the point was if he just followed
         the childish directions, a cake would result. He\x{2019}d have his cake. The only thing Gately
         knew about cake was that the frosting was the best part, and he personally found Eugenio
         Martinez a smug and self-righteous prick\x{2014}plus he\x{2019}d always distrusted both Orientals
         and spics, and Gene M. managed to seem like both\x{2014}but he didn\x{2019}t screw out of the House
         or quite do anything they could Discharge him for, and he went to meetings nightly
         and told the more or less truth, and he did the shoe-under-bed knee thing every A.M./P.M. 24/7, and he took the suggestion to join a Group and get rabidly Active and clean
         up ashtrays and go out speaking on Commitments. He had nothing in the way of a like
         God-concept, and at that point maybe even less than nothing in terms of interest in
         the whole thing; he treated prayer like setting an oven-temp according to a box\x{2019}s
         direction. Thinking of it as talking to the ceiling was somehow preferable to imagining
         talking to Nothing. And he found it embarrassing to get down on his knees in his underwear,
         and like the other guys in the room he always pretended his sneakers were like way
         under the bed and he had to stay down there a while to find them and get them out,
         when he prayed, but he did it, and beseeched the ceiling and thanked the ceiling,
         and after maybe five months Gately was riding the Greenie at <<0430|18:0>> to go clean human
         turds out of the Shattuck shower and all of a sudden realized that quite a few days
         had gone by since he\x{2019}d even thought about Demerol or Talwin or even weed. Not just
         merely getting through those last few days\x{2014}Substances hadn\x{2019}t even occurred to him. I.e. the Desire and Compulsion had been Removed. More weeks went by, a blur
         of Commitments and meetings and gasper-smoke and clich\x{e9}s, and he still didn\x{2019}t feel
         anything like his old need to get high. He was, in a way, Free. It was the first time
         he\x{2019}d been out of this kind of mental cage since he was maybe ten. He couldn\x{2019}t believe
         it. He wasn\x{2019}t Grateful so much as kind of suspicious about it, the Removal. How could
         some kind of Higher Power he didn\x{2019}t even believe in magically let him out of the cage
         when Gately had been a total hypocrite in even asking something he didn\x{2019}t believe
         in to let him out of a cage he had like zero hope of ever being let out of? When he
         could only get himself on his knees for the prayers in the first place by pretending
         to look for his shoes? He couldn\x{2019}t for the goddamn life of him understand how this thing worked, this thing that was working. It drove him
         bats. At about seven months, at the little Sunday Beginners\x{2019} Mtg., he actually cracked
         one of the Provident\x{2019}s fake-wood tabletops beating his big square head against it.

         honesty is that once he\x{2019}s jammed himself into a black-as-water Aventura and watched

         taking a little bit less of a direct route to a given Ennet-errand-site than he probably

         It\x{2019}s almost perfectly square, massive and boxy and mysticetously blunt: the head of
         somebody who looks like he likes to lower his head and charge. He used to let people
         open and close elevator doors on his head, break things across his head. The \x{2018}Indestructible\x{2019} in his childhood cognomen referred to the head. His left ear looks a bit like a
         prizefighter\x{2019}s left ear. The head\x{2019}s nearly flat on top, so that his hair, long in
         back but with short Prince Valiant bangs in front, looks sort of like a carpet remnant
         someone\x{2019}s tossed on the head and let slide slightly back but stay. 200 Nobody that lives in these guano-spotted old brown buildings along Comm. with bars
         on the low floors\x{2019} windows 201 ever goes inside, it seems like. Even in thunder and little asterisks of snow, all
         kinds of olive Spanish and puke-white Irish are on every corner, bullshitting and
         trying to look like they\x{2019}re just out there waiting for something important and drinking
         out of tallboys wrapped tight in brown bags. A strange nod to discretion, the bags,
         wrapped so tight the outline of the cans can\x{2019}t be missed. A Shore boy, Gately\x{2019}d never
         used a paper bag around streetcorner cans: it\x{2019}s like a city thing. The Aventura can
         do 80 kph in third gear. The engine never strains or whines, just eventually starts
         to sound hostile, is how you to know to hurt your hip and shift. The Aventura\x{2019}s instrument
         panel looks more like the instrument panel of military aircraft. Something\x{2019}s always
         blinking and Indicating; one of the blinking lights is supposed to tell you when to
         shift; Pat has told him to ignore the panel. He loves to make the driver\x{2019}s-side window

         his ass wet to this day to even think about the grid-interval; but Lenz had thought
         it sounded wicked nice, the sky as digital timepiece. And also between 2216 and 2226
         the ATHSCME giant fans off up at the Sunstrand Plaza within earshot were typically
         shut off for daily de-linting, and it was quiet except for the big Ssshhh of a whole
         urban city\x{2019}s vehicular traffic, and maybe the odd E.W.D. airborne deliverer catapulted
         up off Concavityward, its little string of lights arcing northeast; and of course
         also sirens, both the Eurotrochaic sirens of ambulances and the regular U.S.-sounding
         sirens of the city\x{2019}s very Finest, Protecting and Serving, keeping the citizenry at
         bay; and the winsome thing about sirens in the urban night is that unless they\x{2019}re
         right up close where the lights bathe you in red-blue-red they always sound like they\x{2019}re
         terribly achingly far away, and receding, calling to you across an expanding gap.

         the people that owned them provided more adrenal excitation and thus more sense of
         what Bill James one time called a Catharsis of resolving, which Lenz felt he could agree. A small can of oil in its own little

         in his Principles of Psychology and The Gifford Lectures on Natural Religion after just beating curfew home, which who wouldn\x{2019}t need a bit of an unwinder after
         a stressful close-call-type situation with a flaming cat chasing you and screaming
         in a way that made porch lights go on all up and down Sumner Blake Rd.; except but

         oral mouths which keep horning into the conversation with the mouths\x{2019} own opinions
         and issues and aspects\x{2014}most of the residents are the worst listeners Lenz has ever

         is quiet the way certain stand-up type guys you want to have there with you beside

         own self-oriented thoughts and not even listening to Lenz, etc., treating Lenz like
         a radio you can tune in or out. Lenz has a keen antenna for people like this and their
         stock is low on his personal exchange. Bruce Green inserts low affirmatives and \x{2018}No

            "It\x{2019}s an urban November P.M.: very last leaves down, dry gray hairy grass, brittle bushes, gap-toothed trees.
         The rising moon looks like it doesn\x{2019}t feel very well. The click of Lenz\x{2019}s loafers
         and the crunchy thud of Green\x{2019}s old asphalt-spreader\x{2019}s boots with the thick black
         soles. Green\x{2019}s little noises of attention and assent. He says he\x{2019}s been broken by
         life, is all he\x{2019}ll personally say. Green. Life has kicked his ass, and he\x{2019}s regrouping.
         Lenz likes him, and there\x{2019}s always this slight hangnail of fear, like clinging, whenever
         he likes somebody. It\x{2019}s like something terrible could happen at any time. Less fear
         than a kind of tension in the region of stomach and ass, an all-body wince. Deciding
         to go ahead and think somebody\x{2019}s a stand-up guy: it\x{2019}s like you drop something, you
         give up all of your power over it: you have to stand there impotent waiting for it
         to hit the ground: all you can do is brace and wince. It kind of enrages Lenz to like
         somebody. There would be no way to say any of this out loud to Green. As it gets <<past
         2200h|1>>. and the meatloaf in his pocket\x{2019}s baggie\x{2019}s gotten dark and hard from disuse
         the pressure to exploit the c. 2216 interval for resolution builds to a terrible pitch,
         but Lenz still can\x{2019}t yet quite get it up to ask Green to walk back some other way
         at least once in a while. How does he do it and still have Green know he thinks he\x{2019}s
         OK? But you don\x{2019}t come right out there and let somebody hear you say you think they\x{2019}re
         OK. When it\x{2019}s a girl you\x{2019}re just trying to X it\x{2019}s a different thing, straightforwarder;
         but like for instance where do you look with your eyes when you tell somebody you
         like them and mean what you say? You can\x{2019}t look right at them, because then what if
         their eyes look at you as your eyes look at them and you lock eyes as you\x{2019}re saying
         it, and then there\x{2019}d be some awful like voltage or energy there, hanging between you.
         But you can\x{2019}t look away like you\x{2019}re nervous, like some nervous kid asking for a date
         or something. You can\x{2019}t go around giving that kind of thing of yourself away. Plus
         the knowing that the whole fucking thing\x{2019}s not worth this kind of wince and stress:
         the whole thing\x{2019}s enraging. The afternoon of tonight earlier at circa <<1610h|1>>. Lenz\x{2019}d
         sprayed RIJID-brand male hairspray in the face of a one-eyed Ennet House stray cat
         that had wandered by mischance into the men\x{2019}s head upstairs, but the result: unsatisfying.
         The cat had just run away downstairs, clunking into the bannister only once. Lenz
         then got diarrhea, which always disgusts him, and he had to stay in the head and open
         the little warped frosted-glass window and run the shower on C until the smell\x{2019}s evidence
         cleared, with fucking Glynn pounding on the door and attracting attention howling
         about who\x{2019}s flailing the whale in there all this time is it by any chance Lenz. But
         then how would he be supposed to act henceforward toward Green if he blows him off
         and says to let him walk solo home? How would he be supposed to act if it\x{2019}d seemed
         like he\x{2019}d like spurned Green? What does he henceforward say if he and Green pass each
         other in the aisle at Saturday Night Lively or both reach for the same sandwich at
         the raffle-break at White Flag, or get caught standing there half-naked in towels
         in the hall waiting for somebody to get out of the shower? What if he like spurns
         Green and Green ends up in the 3-Man room while Lenz is still in there and they have
         to room together and interface constantly? And if Lenz tries to temper the spurning
         by telling Green he likes him, where the fuck is he supposed to look when he says
         it? If trying to X a female species Lenz would have nullo problemo with where to look.
         He\x{2019}d have no problem with looking deep into some bitch\x{2019}s eyes and looking so sincere
         it\x{2019}s like he\x{2019}s dying inside him. Or if like assuring a bad-complected Brazilian he
         hadn\x{2019}t stepped on a half-kilo three separate times with Inositol. 231 Or if high: zero problem. If he got high, he\x{2019}d have no problem telling somebody he
         liked him even if he really did. For it\x{2019}d give his spirits a voltage that\x{2019}d more than
         overweigh whatever upsetting voltage might hang in the air between somebody. A few
         lineskers and there\x{2019}d be no stress-issues about telling Bruce G. with all due respects
         to screw, go peddle his papers, go play in the freeway, go play with a chain saw,
         go find a short pier, that no disrespect but Lenz needed to fly solo in the urban
         night. So after the incident with the cat and diarrhea and some hard words with D.
         R. Glynn, who was slumped holding his abdomen down against the south wall of the upstairs
         hall, Lenz decides enough is enough and goes and gets a little square of foil off
         the industrial roll Don G. keeps under the Ennet sink and goes and takes a half-gram,
         maybe a gram at most out of the emergency stash out of the vault-thing he\x{2019}s razored
         out of the Principles of Natural Lectures. Far from your scenario of relapsing, the Bing is medicinal support for assertively
         sharing his need for aloneness with Green, so that issues of early sobriety can get
         resolved before standing in the way of spiritual growth\x{2014}Lenz will use cocaine in the
         very interests of sobriety and growth itself.",

         half-gasper and puts it carefully back in the pack and yawns and stretches and does

         off the top of the toilet-tank and wipes the tank-top off both before and after with
         wet paper towels, ironically rolling up the same crisp buck he\x{2019}d brought for the meeting\x{2019}s

         his gums with the finger and then putting his head way back in the mirror to check
         the kidney-shaped nostrils of his fine aqua-line nose for clinging evidence in the
         trim hair up there and tasting the bitter drip in the back of his frozen throat and
         taking the clean rolled buck and back-rolling it and smoothing it out and hammering
         it with his fist on the lip of the sink and folding it neatly into half of half its
         original Treasury Dept. size so that all evidence anybody ever even had a passing
         thought of rolling the buck into a hard tight tube is, like, anileated. Then sauntered back out like butter wouldn\x{2019}t soften anywhere on his body, knowing

            "He and Lenz have become separated, he realizes. Now way southwest of Union on Comm.,
         Green looks around at traffic and T-tracks and bar-patrons and T.U.L.\x{2019}s huge bottle\x{2019}s
         low-neon flutter. He wonders whether he\x{2019}s somehow blown Lenz off or whether Lenz\x{2019}s
         blown him off, and that\x{2019}s all he wonders, that\x{2019}s the total complexity the speculation
         assumes, that\x{2019}s his thought for the minute. It\x{2019}s like the whole nut-can-and-cigar
         traumas drained into some psychic sump at puberty, sank and left only an oily slick
         that catches the light in distorted ways. The warbly Polynesian music\x{2019}s way clearer
         up here. He starts up the steep hill on Brainerd Rd., which terminates at the Enfield
         line. Maybe Lenz can\x{2019}t move straightforwardly south at all past a certain time. The
         acclivity is not kind to asphalt-spreader\x{2019}s boots. After the initial crazed-gerbil-in-brain
         phase of early Withdrawal and detox, Bruce Green has now returned to his normal psychorepressed
         cerebral state where he has about one fully developed thought every sixty seconds,
         and then just one at a time, a thought, each materializing already fully developed
         and sitting there and then melting back away like a languid liquid-crystal display.
         His Ennet House counselor, the extremely tough-loving Calvin T., complains that listening
         to Green is like listening to a faucet with a very slow drip. His rap is that Green
         seems not serene or detached but totally shut down, disassociated, and Calvin T. tries
         weekly to draw Green out by pissing him off. Green\x{2019}s next full thought is the realization
         that even though the hideous Hawaiian music had sounded like it was drifting up northward
         from down at the Allston Spur, it\x{2019}s somewhat louder now the farther west he moves
         toward Enfield\x{2019}s Cambridge St. dogleg and St. Elizabeth\x{2019}s Hospital. Brainerd between
         Commonwealth and Cambridge St. is a sine wave of lung-busting hills through neighborhoods
         Tiny Ewell had described as Depressed Residential, unending rows of crammed-together
         triple-decker houses with those tiny sad architectural differences that seem to highlight
         the essential sameness, with sagging porches and psoriatic paint-jobs or aluminum
         siding gone carbuncular from violent temperature-swings, yard-litter and dishes and
         patchy grass and fenced pets and children\x{2019}s toys lying around in discarded attitudes
         and eclectic food-smells and wildly different-patterned curtains or blinds in a house\x{2019}s
         different windows due to these old houses are carved up inside into apartments for
         like alienated B.U. students or Canadian and Concavity-displaced families or even
         more alienated B.C. students, or probably it looks like the bulk of the lease-holders
         are Green-and-Bonkesque younger blue-collar hard-partying types that have posters
         of the Fiends In Human Shape or Choosy Mothers or Snout or the Bioavailable Five 241 in the bathroom and black lights in the bedroom and oil-change stains in the driveway
         and that throw their supper dishes into the yard and buy new dishes at Caldor instead
         of washing their dishes and that still, in their twenties, ingest Substances nightly
         and use party as a verb and put their sound-systems\x{2019} speakers in their apartments\x{2019} windows facing
         out and crank the volume out of sheer high-spirit obnoxiousness because they still
         have their girlfriends to pound beers with and do shotguns of dope into the mouth
         of and do lines of Bing off various parts of the naked body of, and still find pounding
         beers and doing bongs and lines fun and get to have fun on a nightly after-work basis,
         cranking the tunes out into the neighborhood air. The street\x{2019}s bare trees are densely
         limbed, they\x{2019}re a certain type of tree, they look like inverted brooms in the residential
         dark, Green doesn\x{2019}t know his tree-names. The Hawaiian music is what\x{2019}s pulled him southwest,
         it emerges: it\x{2019}s originating from someplace in this very neighborhood somewhere around
         W. Brainerd, and Green moves upriver toward what sounds like the source of the sound
         with a blankly horrified fascination. Most of the yards are fenced in stainless-steel
         chainlink fencing, and occasional yard-dogs whine or more commonly bark and snarl
         and leap territorially at Green from behind their fences, the fences shivering from
         the impact and the chainlink stuff dented outward from previous impacts from previous
         passersby. The thought that he isn\x{2019}t scared of dogs develops and recedes in Green\x{2019}s
         midbrain. His jacket creaks with every step. The temperature is steadily dropping.
         The fenced front yards are the toy-and-beer-can-strewn type where the brown grass
         grows in uneven tufts and the leaves haven\x{2019}t been raked and are piled in wind-blown
         lines of force along the base of the fence and unpruned hedges and overfull wastebaskets
         and untwisted trashbags are on the sagging porch because nobody\x{2019}s gotten around to
         taking them down to the E.W.D. dumpster at the corner and garbage from the overfull
         receptacles blows out into the yard and mixes with the leaves along the fences\x{2019} base
         and some gets out into the street and is never picked up and eventually becomes part
         of the composition of the street. A nonpeanut M&M box is like intaglioed into the
         concrete of the sidewalk under Green, so bleached by the elements it\x{2019}s turned bone-white
         and is only barely identifiable as a nonpeanut M&M box, for instance. And, looking
         up from identifying the M&M box\x{2019}s make, Green now espies Randy Lenz. Green has happened
         upon Lenz, way up here on Brainerd, now strolling briskly alone up ahead of Green,
         not close but visible under a functioning streetlight about a block farther uphill
         on Brainerd. There\x{2019}s some disincentive to call out. The incline on this block isn\x{2019}t
         bad. It\x{2019}s cold enough now so his breath looks the same whether he\x{2019}s smoking or not.
         The tall curved streetlamps here look to Green just like the weaponish part of the
         Martian vessels that fired fatal rays in their conquest of the planet in an ancient
         cartridge Tommy Doocy\x{2019}d never tired of that he labelled the case \x{2018}War of the Welles.\x{2019}
         The Hawaiian music dominates the aural landscape by this point, now, coming from someplace
         up near where he sees the back of Lenz\x{2019}s coat. Someone has put Polynesian-music speakers
         in their window, pretty clearly. Creepy slack-key steel guitar balloons across the
         dim street, booms off the sagging facades opposite, it\x{2019}s Don Ho and the Sol Hoopi
         Players, the grass-skirt-and-foamy-breakers sound that makes Green put his fingers
         in his ears while at the same time he moves more urgently toward the Hawaiian-music
         source, a pink or aqua three-decker with a second-floor dormer and red-shingled roof
         with a blue and white Quenucker flag on a pole protruding from a window in the dormer
         and serious JBL speakers facing outward in the two windows on either side of the flag,
         with the screens off so you can see the woofers throbbing like brown bellies hulaing,
         bathing the 1700 block of W. Brainerd in dreadful ukuleles and hollow-log percussives.
         All the blunt fingers in his ears do is add the squeak of Green\x{2019}s pulse and the underwater
         sound of his respiration to the music, though. Figures in plaid-flannel or else floral
         Hawaiian shirts and those flower necklaces melt in and out of lit view behind and
         over the window-speakers with the oozing quality of large-group chemical fun and dancing
         and social intercoursing. The lit windows make slender rectangles of light out across
         the yard, which the yard is a sty. Something about Randy Lenz\x{2019}s movements up ahead,
         the high-kneed tiptoed skulk of a vaudeville fiend up to no good at all, keeps Green
         from calling out to him even if he could have made himself heard over what to him
         is a roar of blood and breath and Ho. Lenz moves through the one operative streetlight\x{2019}s
         cone across the sidewalk and over to the stainless chainlink of the same Quenucker
         house, holding something out to a Shetland-sized dog whose leash is attached to a
         fluorescent-plastic clothesliney thing by a pulley, and can slide. It\x{2019}s cold and the
         air is thin and keen and his fingers are icy in his ears, which ache with cold. Green
         watches, rapt on levels he doesn\x{2019}t know he has, drawn slowly forward, moving his head
         from side to side to keep from losing Lenz in the fog of his breath, not calling out,
         but transfixed. Green and Mildred Bonk and the other couple they\x{2019}d shared a trailer
         with T. Doocy with had gone through a phase one time where they\x{2019}d crash various collegiate
         parties and mix with the upper-scale collegiates, and once in one February Green found
         himself at a Harvard U. dorm where they were having a like Beach-Theme Party, with
         a dumptruck\x{2019}s worth of sand on the common-room floor and everybody with flower necklaces
         and skin bronzed with cream or UV-booth-salon visits, all the towheaded guys in floral
         untucked shirts walking around with lockjawed noblest oblige and drinking drinks with umbrellas in them or else wearing Speedos with no shirts
         and not one fucking pimple anyplace on their back and pretending to surf on a surfboard
         somebody had nailed to a hump-shaped wave made of blue and white papier m\x{e2}ch\x{e9} with
         a motor inside that made the fake wave sort of undulate, and all the girls in grass
         skirts oozing around the room trying to hula in a shimmying way that showed their
         thighs\x{2019} LipoVac scars through the shimmying grass of their skirts, and Mildred Bonk
         had donned a grass skirt and bikini-top out of the pile by the keggers and even though
         almost seven months pregnant had oozed and shimmied right into the mainstream of the
         swing of things, but Bruce Green had felt awkward and out of place in his cheap leather
         jacket and haircut he\x{2019}d dyed orange with gasoline in a blackout and the EAT THE RICH
         patch he\x{2019}d perversely let Mildred Bonk sew onto the groin of his police-pants, and
         then they\x{2019}d finally got tired of the \x{2018}Hawaii Five-0\x{2019} theme and started in with the
         Don Ho and Sol Hoopi CDs, and Green had gotten so uncomfortably fascinated and repelled
         and paralyzed by the Polynesian tunes that he\x{2019}d set up a cabana-chair right by the
         kegs and had sat there overworking the pump on the kegs and downing one plastic cup
         after another of beer-foam until he got so blind drunk his sphincter had failed and
         he\x{2019}d not only pissed but also actually shit his pants, for only the second time ever, and the first public time ever, and was
         mortified with complexly layered shame, and had to ease very gingerly into the nearest-by
         head and remove his pants and wipe himself off like a fucking baby, having to shut
         one eye to make sure which him he saw was him, and then there\x{2019}d been nothing to do
         with the fouled police-pants but crack the bathroom door and reach a tattooed arm
         out with the pants and bury them in the living room\x{2019}s sand like a housecat\x{2019}s litterbox,
         and then of course what was he supposed to put on if he ever wanted to leave that
         head or dorm again, to get home, so he\x{2019}d had to hold one eye shut and reach one arm
         out again and like strain to reach the pile of grass skirts and bikini-tops and snatch
         a grass skirt, and put it on, and slip out of the Hawaiian dorm out a side door without
         letting anybody see him, and then ride the Red Line and C-Greenie and then a bus all
         the way home in February in a cheap leather jacket and asphalt-spreader\x{2019}s boots and
         a grass skirt, the grass of which rode up in the most horrifying way, and he\x{2019}d spent
         the next three days not leaving the trailer in the Spur, in a paralyzing depression
         of unknown etiology, lying on Tommy D.\x{2019}s crusty-stained sofa and drinking Southern
         Comfort straight out of the bottle and watching Doocy\x{2019}s snakes not move once in three
         days, in their tank, and Mildred had given him two days of high-volume shit for first
         sulking antisocially by the keg and then screwing out and abandoning her at seven
         months gone to a sandy room full of tanly anomic blondes who said catty things about
         her tattoos and creepy boys who talked without moving their lower jaw and asked her
         things like where she \x{2018}summered\x{2019} and kept offering her advice on no-load funds and
         inviting her upstairs to check out their D\x{fc}rer prints and saying they found overweight
         girls terribly compelling in their defiance of culturo-ascetic norms, and Bruce Green
         lay there with a head full of Hoopi and unresolved pain and didn\x{2019}t say a word or even
         have a fully developed thought for three days, and had hidden the grass skirt under
         the dustruffle of the couch and later savagely torn it to shreds and sprinkled the
         clippings over Doocy\x{2019}s hydroponic-marijuana development in the tub, for mulch. Lenz
         goes in and out of Green\x{2019}s focus several times within a dozen andante strides, still
         out in front of the Canadian-refugee-type house that\x{2019}s drawn Green on, Lenz holding
         a little can of something up over one side of the fence\x{2019}s gate and dribbling something
         onto the gate, holding something else that suddenly engages the dog\x{2019}s full attention.
         For some reason Green thinks to check his watch. The pink or orange clothesline quivers
         as the leash\x{2019}s pulley runs along it as the dog comes up to meet Lenz inside the gate
         he\x{2019}s slowly opened. The huge dog seems neither friendly nor unfriendly toward Lenz,
         but his attention is engaged. The leash and pulley could never hold him if he decided
         Lenz was food. There\x{2019}s bitter-smelling material from his ear on Green\x{2019}s finger, which
         he can\x{2019}t help but sniff. He\x{2019}s forgotten and left the other finger in his ear. He\x{2019}s
         now pretty close, standing in a van\x{2019}s shadow just outside the pyramid of sodium light
         from the streetlight, like two houses down from the source of the grisly sound, which
         all of a sudden is in the silence between cuts of Ho\x{2019}s early Don Ho: From Hawaii With All My Love, so that Green can hear baritone Canadianese party-voices through the open windows
         and also the low lalations of baby-talk of some sort from Lenz, \x{2018}Pooty ooty doggy
         woggy\x{2019} and whatnot, presumably directed at the dog, who\x{2019}s coming over to Lenz in a
         sort of neutrally cautious but attentive way. Green has no clue what kind of dog it
         is, but it\x{2019}s big. Green can remember not the sight but the two very different sounds
         of the footfalls of his Pop the late Mr. Green pacing the Waltham living room, the
         crinkle of the paper bag around the tallboy in his hand. It\x{2019}s <<well after 2245h|1>>. The
         dog\x{2019}s leash slides hissing to the end of the Day-Glo line and stops the dog a couple
         paces from the inside of the gate, where Lenz is standing, inclined in the slight
         forward way of somebody who\x{2019}s talking baby-talk to a dog. Green can see that Lenz
         has a slightly gnawed square of Don G.\x{2019}s hard old meatloaf out in front of him, holding
         it toward the straining dog. Lenz has the blankly intent look of a short-haired man
         with a Geiger counter. The hideously compelling Ho starts again with the total abruptness
         that makes CDs so creepy. Green\x{2019}s got one finger in one ear, shifting around slightly
         to keep Lenz\x{2019}s lampshadow from blocking the view. The music balloons and booms. The
         Nucks have turned it way up for \x{2018}My Lovely Launa-Una Luau Lady,\x{2019} a song that\x{2019}s always
         made Green want to put his head through a window. Part of the instrumentals sounds
         like a harp on acid. The hollow-log percussives are like a heart in your extremest-type
         terror. Green fancies he can see windows in the houses opposite vibrate from the horrific
         vibration. Green\x{2019}s having way more than one thought p.m. now, the squeak of the gerbil-wheel
         starting to crank deep inside. The undulating shiver is a slack-steel guitar that
         fills little Brucie\x{2019}s head with white sand and undulating tummies and heads that resemble
         New Year\x{2019}s subsidized parade balloons, huge soft shiny baggy wrinkled grinning heads
         nodding and bobbing as they slowly inflate to the shape of a giant head, tilted forward,
         straining at the ropes they\x{2019}re pulled by. Green hasn\x{2019}t watched a New Year\x{2019}s parade
         since the Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad\x{2019}s, which had been obscene. Green\x{2019}s close
         enough to see that the Hawaiianized Nuck house is 412 W. Brainerd. Blue-collar-type
         cars and 4\x{d7}4s and vans are all up and down the street packed in in a somehow partyish
         attitude, as in parked in a hurry, some of them with Canadian lettering on the plates.
         Fleur-de-lis stickers and slogans in Canadian on some of the windows also. An old
         Montego cammed out into a slingshot dragster is parked square in front of 412 in a
         sort of menacing way with two wheels up on the curb and a circle of flowers hung jauntily
         over the antenna, and the ellipses of dull fade in the paintjob of the hood that show
         the engine\x{2019}s been bored out and the hood gets real hot, and Lenz has gotten down on
         one knee and breaks off some of the meatloaf and tosses it underhand to the ground
         inside the leash\x{2019}s range. The dog goes over and lowers its head to the meat. The distinctive
         sound of Gately\x{2019}s meatloaf getting chewed plus the ghastly music\x{2019}s zithery warbling
         roar. Lenz now rises and his movements in the yard have a melting and wraithlike quality
         in the different shades of shadow. The lit window farthest from the limp flag has
         solid swarthy guys in beards and loud shirts passing back and forth snapping their
         fingers under their elbows with flower-strewn females in tow. Many of the heads are
         thrown back and attached to Molson bottles. Green\x{2019}s jacket creaks as he tries to breathe.
         The snake had leapt from the can with a sound like: spronnnnng. His aunt at the Winchester breakfast nook, in dazzling winter dawnlight, quietly
         doing a word-search puzzle. Two dormer windows are half-blocked by the throbbing rectangles
         of the JBLs. Green\x{2019}s the type that can recognize a JBL speaker and Molson-green bottle
         from way far away.",

         their interface: Avril usually tries in a nonintrusive way to discourage Mario from
         taking walks at night, because he doesn\x{2019}t see well at night, and the areas around
         the E.T.A. hill are not the best neighborhood, and there\x{2019}s no skirting the fact that
         Mario would be easy prey for just about anybody, physically. And, though one perk
         of Familial Dysautonomia is a relative physical fearlessness, 242 Mario keeps to a pretty limited area during insomniacal strolls, out of deference
         to Avril\x{2019}s worry. 243 He\x{2019}ll sometimes walk around the grounds of the Enfield Marine P.H.H. at the bottom
         of the hill\x{2019}s east side because they\x{2019}re pretty much enclosed, the grounds are, and
         he knows a couple of the E.M. Security officers from when his father got them to portray
         Boston police in his whimsical Dial C for Concupiscence; and he likes the E.M. grounds at night because the different brick houses\x{2019} window-light
         is yellow lamplight 244 and he can see people on the ground floors all together playing cards or talking
         or watching TP. He also likes whitewashed brick regardless of its state of upkeep.
         And a lot of the people in the different brick houses are damaged or askew and lean
         hard to one side or are twisted into themselves, through the windows, and he can feel
         his heart going out into the world through them, which is good for insomnia. A woman\x{2019}s
         voice, calling for help without any real urgency\x{2014}not like the screams that signify

         the little street that\x{2019}s crammed with cars everybody has to move at <<0000h|1>>. is Ennet\x{2019}s
         House, where the Headmistress has a disability and had had a wheelchair ramp installed
         and has twice invited Mario in during the day for a Caffeine-Free Millennial Fizzy,
         and Mario likes the place: it\x{2019}s crowded and noisy and none of the furniture has protective
         plastic wrap, but nobody notices anybody else or comments on a disability and the
         Headmistress is kind to the people and the people cry in front of each other. The
         inside of it smells like an ashtray, but Mario\x{2019}s felt good both times in Ennet\x{2019}s House
         because it\x{2019}s very real; people are crying and making noise and getting less unhappy,
         and once he heard somebody say God with a straight face and nobody looked at them or looked down or smiled in any sort

            "People from the public can\x{2019}t be in there <<after 2300|18:1>>, though, because they have a Curfew,
         so Mario just totters past on the broken sidewalk and looks in the ground windows
         at all the different people. Every window is lit up with light and some are slid partly
         open, and there is the noise of being outside a house full of people. From one of
         the upstairs windows facing the street comes a voice going \x{2018}Give it here, give it
         here.\x{2019} Someone is crying and someone else is either laughing or coughing very hard.
         An irritable man\x{2019}s voice from a kitchen window at the side says something to somebody
         else that just said something like \x{2018}So get dentures,\x{2019} followed by curse words. Another
         upstairs window, over at the side by the wheelchair ramp and the kitchen window where
         the ground is soft enough to take the stress of a police lock and lead block nicely,
         the upper window has a billowing lengthwise flag for a curtain and an old bumper sticker
         on the glass half scraped off so it says <<ONE|11>> DAY A in cursive, and Mario is arrested by the quiet but unmistakable sound of a recording
         of a broadcast of \x{2018}Sixty Minutes More or Less with Madame Psychosis,\x{2019} which Mario
         has never taped a show of because he feels it wouldn\x{2019}t be right for him but is strangely
         thrilled to hear someone in Ennet\x{2019}s thinking enough of to tape and replay. What\x{2019}s
         coming from behind the open window with a billowing flag for a curtain is one of the
         old ones, from the Year of the Wonderchicken, Madame\x{2019}s inaugural year, when she\x{2019}d
         sometimes talk all hour and had an accent. A hard east wind blows Mario\x{2019}s thin hair
         straight back off his head. His standing angle is 50\x{b0}. A female girl in a little fur
         coat and uncomfortable-looking bluejeans and tall shoes clicks past on the sidewalk
         and goes up the ramp into Ennet\x{2019}s back door without indicating she saw somebody with
         a really big head standing braced by a police lock on the lawn outside the kitchen
         window. The lady had had on so much makeup she\x{2019}d looked unwell but the wake of her
         passage smells very good. For some reason Mario felt like the person behind the flag
         in the window was also a female. Mario thinks it might not be out of the question
         that she might lend tapes to a fellow listener if he could ask. He usually checks
         etiquette questions with Hal, who is incredibly knowledgeable and smart. When he thinks
         of Hal his heart beats and his forehead\x{2019}s thick skin becomes wrinkled. Hal will also
         know the term for private tapes made of broadcast things on the air. Perhaps this
         lady owns multiple tapes. This one is from \x{2018}Sixty Minutes +/\x{2212}\x{2019} \x{2019}s first year, when
         Madame still had a slight accent and often spoke on the show as if she were talking
         exclusively to one person or character who was very important to her. The Moms revealed
         that if you\x{2019}re not crazy then speaking to someone who isn\x{2019}t there is termed apostrophe and is valid art. Mario\x{2019}d fallen in love with the first Madame Psychosis programs
         because he felt like he was listening to someone sad read out loud from yellow letters
         she\x{2019}d taken out of a shoebox on a rainy P.M., stuff about heartbreak and people you loved dying and U.S. woe, stuff that was real.
         It is increasingly hard to find valid art that is about stuff that is real in this
         way. The older Mario gets, the more confused he gets about the fact that everyone
         at E.T.A. over the age of about Kent Blott finds stuff that\x{2019}s really real uncomfortable
         and they get embarrassed. It\x{2019}s like there\x{2019}s some rule that real stuff can only get
         mentioned if everybody rolls their eyes or laughs in a way that isn\x{2019}t happy. The worst-feeling
         thing that happened today was at lunch when Michael Pemulis told Mario he had an idea
         for setting up a Dial-a-Prayer telephone service for atheists in which the atheist
         dials the number and the line just rings and rings and no one answers. It was a joke
         and a good one, and Mario got it; what was unpleasant was that Mario was the only
         one at the big table whose laugh was a happy laugh; everybody else sort of looked
         down like they were laughing at somebody with a disability. The whole issue was far
         above Mario\x{2019}s head, and he was unable to understand Lyle\x{2019}s replies when he tried to
         bring the confusion up. And Hal was for once no help, because Hal seemed even more
         uncomfortable and embarrassed than the fellows at lunch, and when Mario brought up
         real stuff Hal called him Booboo and acted like he\x{2019}d wet himself and Hal was going
         to be very patient about helping him change.",

         Lenz, who sort of oozes through the door just as Gately\x{2019}s going through his keys to
         get the key to lock it, and kind of brushes by and goes up to the 3-Man without a
         word, which he\x{2019}s been doing a lot lately, which Gately has to Log, plus the fact that
         it\x{2019}s now <<after 2330|9c:0>> and he can\x{2019}t account for either the semi-new girl Amy J. or\x{2014}more
         upsetting\x{2014}Bruce Green. Then Green knocks at the front door at <<2336|5d>>\x{2014}Gately has to Log
         the exact time and then it\x{2019}s his call whether to unlock the door. After curfew Staff
         doesn\x{2019}t have to unlock the door. Many a bad-news resident gets effectively bounced
         this way. Gately lets him in. Green\x{2019}s never come close to missing curfew before and
         looks godawful, skin potato-white and eyes vacant. And a big quiet kid is one thing,
         but Green looks at the floor of Pat\x{2019}s office like it\x{2019}s a loved one while Gately gives
         him the required ass-chewing; and Green takes the standard dreaded week\x{2019}s Full House
         Restriction 247 in such a vacantly hangdog way, and is so lamely vague when Gately asks does he want
         to tell him where he\x{2019}s been at and why he couldn\x{2019}t make 2330 and whether there\x{2019}s anything
         that\x{2019}s an issue that he might want to share with Staff, so unresponsive that Gately
         feels like he has no choice but to pull an immediate spot-urine on Green, which Gately
         hates doing not only because he plays cribbage with Green and feels like he\x{2019}s taken
         Green under the old Gately wing and is probably the closest thing to a sponsor the
         kid\x{2019}s got but also because urine samples taken after Unit #2\x{2019}s clinic\x{2019}s closed 248 have to be stored overnight in the little Staff miniature fridgelette in Don Gately\x{2019}s
         basement room\x{2014}the only fridge in the House that no resident could conceivably dicky
         into\x{2014}and Gately hates to have a warm blue-lidded cup of somebody\x{2019}s goddamn urine in
         his fridgelette with his pears and Polar seltzer, etc. Green submits to Gately\x{2019}s cross-armed
         presence in the men\x{2019}s head as Green produces a urine so efficiently and with so little
         bullshit that Gately is able to take the lidded cup between gloved thumb and finger
         and get it downstairs and tagged and Logged and down in the fridgelette in time to
         not be late for getting the residents\x{2019} cars moved, the night-shift\x{2019}s biggest pain
         in the ass; but then his final head-count at <<2345|18:0>> reminds Gately that Amy J. isn\x{2019}t
         back, and she hasn\x{2019}t called, and Pat has told him the decision to Discharge after
         a missed curfew is his call, and at <<2350|9n:0>> Gately makes the decision, and has to get
         Treat and Belbin to go up into the 5-Woman room and pack the girl\x{2019}s stuff up in the
         same Irish Luggage she\x{2019}d brought it in Monday, and Gately has to put the trashbags
         on the front porch with a quick note explaining the Discharge and wishing the girl
         good luck, and has to call Pat\x{2019}s answering device down in Milton and leave word of
         a mandatory Curfew-Discharge at <<2350h|1>>., so Pat can hear about it first thing in the
         A.M. and schedule interviews to fill the available bed ASAP, and then with a hissed curse
         Gately remembers the anti-big-hanging-gut situps he\x{2019}s sworn to himself to do every
         night before <<0000|9c:0>>, and it\x{2019}s <<2356|9c:0>>, and he has time to do only 20 with his huge discolored
         sneakers wedged under the frame of the office\x{2019}s black vinyl couch before it\x{2019}s unavoidably

         and personally escort all residents who own cars out post-curfew outside into the
         little nameless streetlet, and for somebody with Gately\x{2019}s real limited managerial
         skills the headaches involved are daunting: he has to herd the vehicular residents
         together just inside the locked front door; he has to threaten the residents he\x{2019}s
         herded together into staying together by the door while he clomps upstairs to get
         the one or two drivers who always forget and fall asleep before 0000\x{2014}and this straggler-collecting
         is a particular pain in the ass if the straggler\x{2019}s a female, because he has to unlock
         and press the Male Coming Up button by the kitchen, and the \x{2018}buzzer\x{2019} sounds more like
         a klaxon, and wakes the edgiest female residents up with an ugly surge of adrenaline,
         and Gately as he clomps up the stairs gets roundly bitched out by all the mud-masked
         heads sticking out into the female hall, and he by regulation can\x{2019}t go into the sleeper\x{2019}s
         bedroom but has to pound on the door and keep shouting out his gender and get one
         of the straggler\x{2019}s roommates to wake her up and get her dressed and to the bedroom
         door; so he has to retrieve the stragglers and chew them out and threaten them with
         both a Restriction and a possible tow while herding them quick-walking down the staircase
         to join the main car-owner herd as quickly as possible before the main herd can like
         disperse. They\x{2019}ll always disperse if he takes too long getting stragglers; they\x{2019}ll
         get distracted or hungry or need an ashtray or just get impatient and start looking
         at the whole car-moving-after-curfew thing as an imposition on their time. Their early-recovery
         Denial makes it impossible for them to imagine their own car getting towed instead
         of, say, somebody else\x{2019}s car. It\x{2019}s the same Denial Gately can see at work in the younger
         B.U. or -C. students when he\x{2019}s driving Pat\x{2019}s Aventura to the Food Bank or Purity Supreme
         when they\x{2019}ll fucking walk right out in the street against the light in front of the
         car, whose brakes are fortunately in top shape. Gately\x{2019}s snapped to the fact that
         people of a certain age and level of like life-experience believe they\x{2019}re immortal:
         college students and alcoholics/addicts are the worst: they deep-down believe they\x{2019}re
         exempt from the laws of physics and statistics that ironly govern everybody else.
         They\x{2019}ll piss and moan your ear off if somebody else fucks with the rules, but they
         don\x{2019}t deep down see themselves subject to them, the same rules. And they\x{2019}re constitutionally
         unable to learn from anybody else\x{2019}s experience: if some jaywalking B.U. student does
         get splattered on Comm. or some House resident does get his car towed at <<0005|9c:1>>, your
         other student\x{2019}s or addict\x{2019}s response to this will be to ponder just what imponderable
         difference makes it possible for that other guy to get splattered or towed and not
         him, the ponderer. They never doubt the difference\x{2014}they just ponder it. It\x{2019}s like
         a kind of idolatry of uniqueness. It\x{2019}s unvarying and kind of spirit-killing for a
         Staffer to watch, that the only way your addict ever learns anything is the hard way.
         It has to happen to them to like upset the idolatry. Eugenio M. and Annie Parrot always recommend letting
         everybody get towed at least once, early on in their residency, to help make believers
         out of them in terms of laws and rules; but Gately for some reason on his night-shifts
         can\x{2019}t do it, cannot fucking stand to have one of his people get towed as long as there\x{2019}s something he can do to prevent
         it, and then plus if they do get towed there\x{2019}s the nail-chewing hassle of arranging
         their transport to the South End\x{2019}s municipal lot the next day, fielding calls from
         bosses and supplying verification of residents\x{2019} carlessness in terms of getting to
         work without letting the boss know that the carless employee is a resident of a halfway
         house, which is totally sacred private residents\x{2019} private information to give out
         or not\x{2014}Gately breaks a full-body sweat just thinking about the managerial headaches
         involved in a fucking tow, so he\x{2019}ll spend time herding and regathering and chewing
         the absentminded asses of residents who Gene M. says have such calloused asses still

         lamp he brought in with him is on, he\x{2019}s in his rack curled on his side clutching his
         abdomen like a kicked man. McDade is illicitly sitting on Foss\x{2019}s rack reading one

         his car keys in his hand; his legs look like he\x{2019}s about to wet himself. Clenette and
         the new black girl, clearly veterans at gunpoint-etiquette, are prone on the lawn
         with their fingers laced behind their heads. Nell Gunther\x{2019}s assumed Lenz\x{2019}s old martial-arts
         Crane stance, hands twisted into flat claws, eyeing the guy\x{2019}s .44, which pans coolly

         really shoot\x{2014}left foot slightly forward, slightly hunched, a two-handed grip with
         the right arm cocked elbow-out so the Item\x{2019}s held high up in front of the guy\x{2019}s face,
         up to his sighting eye. This is how policemen and Made Guys from the North End shoot.
         Gately knows weapons way better than sobriety, still. And the Item\x{2014}if the guy trig-pulls
         on some resident that resident\x{2019}s going down\x{2014}the Item\x{2019}s some customized version of
         a U.S. .44 Bulldog Special, or maybe a Nuck or Brazilian clone, blunt and ugly and
         with a bore like the mouth of a cave. The stout alcoholic kid Tingley has both hands
         to his cheeks and is 100% at bay. The piece\x{2019}s been modified, Gately can appraise.
         The barrel\x{2019}s been vented out near the muzzle to cut your Bulldog\x{2019}s infamous recoil,
         the hammer\x{2019}s bobbed, and the thing\x{2019}s got a fat Mag Na Port or -clone grip like the
         metro Finest favor. This is not a weekend-warrior or liquor-store-holdup type Item;
         it\x{2019}s one that\x{2019}s made real specifically for putting projectiles into people. It\x{2019}s not
         a semiauto but is throated for a fucking speed-loader, which Gately can\x{2019}t see if the
         guy\x{2019}s got a speed-loader under the loose floral shirt but needs to assume the guy\x{2019}s
         got near-unlimited shots with a speed-loader. The North Shore Finest on the other
         hand wrap their grips in this like colored gauze that wicks sweat. Gately tries to
         recall a past associate\x{2019}s insufferable ammo-lectures when under the influence\x{2014}your
         Bulldog and clones can take anything from light target loads and wadcutter to Colt
         SofTip dum-dums and worse. He\x{2019}s pretty sure this thing could put him down with one
         round; he\x{2019}s not sure. Gately\x{2019}s never been shot but he\x{2019}s seen guys shot. He feels something
         that is neither fear nor excitement. Joelle van D. is shouting stuff you can\x{2019}t make
         out, and Erdedy at bay on the lawn\x{2019}s calling out to her to get her head out of the
         whole picture. Gately\x{2019}s been bearing down this whole brief time, both seeing his breath
         and hearing it, beating his arms across his chest to keep some feeling in his hands.
         You could almost call what he feels a kind of jolly calm. The unAmerican guys chase
         Lenz and then stop across the car facing him for a second and then get furious again
         and chase him. Gately guesses he ought to be grateful the third guy doesn\x{2019}t come over
         and just shoot him. Lenz puts both hands on whatever part of the car he stops at and
         sends language out across the car at the two guys. Lenz\x{2019}s white wig is askew and he\x{2019}s
         got no mustache, you can see. E.M. Security, normally so scrupulous with their fucking
         trucks at <<0005h|1>>., is nowhere around, lending weight to yet another clich\x{e9}. If you
         asked Gately what he was feeling right this second he\x{2019}d have no idea. He\x{2019}s got a hand
         up shading his eyes and closes on the Montego as things further clarify. One of the
         guys now you can see has Lenz\x{2019}s disguise\x{2019}s mustache in two fingers and keeps holding
         it up and brandishing it at Lenz. The other guy issues stilted but colorful threats
         in a Canadian accent, so it emerges on Gately it\x{2019}s Nucks, the trio Lenz has managed
         to somehow enrage is Nucks. Gately cops a black surge of Remember-Whenning, the babbling
         little football-head Qu\x{e9}becer he\x{2019}d killed by gagging a man with a bad cold. This line
         of thinking is intolerable. Joelle\x{2019}s overhead shout to for Christ\x{2019}s sake somebody
         call Pat mixes in and out of the Help lady\x{2019}s cries. It occurs to Gately that the Help
         lady has cried Wolf for so many years that real shouts for real help are all going
         to be ignored. The residents all look to Gately as he crosses the street directly
         into the Montego\x{2019}s wash of light. Hester Thrale screams out Look out there\x{2019}s a Item.
         The plaid-hat Nuck pans stiffly to sight at Gately, his elbow up around his ear. It
         occurs to Gately if you fire with an Item right up to your sighting-eye like that
         won\x{2019}t you get a face full of cordite. There\x{2019}s a break in the circular action around
         the throbbing car as Lenz shouts Don with great gusto just as the Help lady shouts for Help. The Nuck with the Item has
         backed up several steps to keep the residents in his peripheral vision while he sights
         square on Gately as the massive Nuck holding the mustache across the car tells Gately
         if he was him he\x{2019}d return to whence he came, him, to avoid the trouble. Gately nods
         and beams. Nucks really do pronounce the with a z. Both the car and Lenz are between Gately and the large Nucks, Lenz\x{2019}s back to Gately.
         Gately stands quietly, wishing he felt different about potential trouble, less almost
         jolly. Late in Gately\x{2019}s Substance and burglary careers, when he\x{2019}d felt so low about
         himself, he\x{2019}d had sick little fantasies of saving somebody from harm, some innocent
         party, and getting killed in the process and getting eulogized at great length in
         bold-faced Globe print. Now Lenz breaks away from the hood of the car and dashes Gately\x{2019}s way and
         around behind him to stand behind him, spreading his arms wide to put a hand on each
         of Gately\x{2019}s shoulders, using Don Gately like a shield. Gately\x{2019}s stance has the kind
         of weary resolution of like You\x{2019}ll Have to Go Through Me. The only anxious part of
         him can see the Log entry he\x{2019}ll have to make if residents come to physical grief on
         his shift. For a moment he can almost smell the smells of the penitentiary, armpits
         and Pomade and sour food and cribbage-board-wood and reefer and mopwater, the rich
         piss stink of a zoo\x{2019}s lion house, the smell of the bars you lace your hands through
         and stand there, looking out. This line of thinking is intolerable. He\x{2019}s neither goosepimpled
         nor sweating. His senses haven\x{2019}t been this keen in over a year. The stars in their
         jelly and dirty sodium lamplight and stark white steer-horns of headlights splayed
         at residents\x{2019} different angles. Star-chocked sky, his breath, faraway horns, low trill
         of ATHSCMEs way to the north. Thin keen cold air in his wide-open nose. Motionless
         heads at #5\x{2019}s windows.",

         a serve in. Another advantage of the Lung was that it afforded no overhead view, which
         was one more reason why staff waited as long as possible before its erection. There

            "A minor short didactic one Hal likes and runs twice in a row is Wave Bye-Bye to the Bureaucrat. A bureaucrat in some kind of sterile fluorescent-lit office complex is a fantastically
         efficient worker when awake, but he has this terrible problem waking up in the A.M., and is consistently late to work, which in a bureaucracy is idiosyncratic and disorderly
         and wholly unacceptable, and we see this bureaucrat getting called in to his supervisor\x{2019}s
         pebbled-glass cubicle, and the supervisor, who wears a severely dated leisure suit
         with his shirt-collar flaring out on either side of its rust-colored lapels, tells
         the bureaucrat that he\x{2019}s a good worker and a fine man, but that this chronic tardiness
         in the A.M. is simply not going to fly, and if it happens one more time the bureaucrat is going
         to have to find another fluorescent-lit office complex to work in. It\x{2019}s no accident
         that in a bureaucracy getting fired is called \x{2018}termination,\x{2019} as in ontological erasure,
         and the bureaucrat leaves his supervisor\x{2019}s cubicle duly shaken. That night he and
         his wife go through their Bauhaus condominium collecting every alarm clock they own,
         each one of which is electric and digital and extremely precise, and they festoon
         their bedroom with them, so there are like a dozen timepieces with their digital alarms
         all set for <<0615h|1>>. But that night there\x{2019}s a power failure, and all the clocks lose
         an hour or just sit there blinking <<0000h|1>>. over and over, and the bureaucrat still
         oversleeps the next A.M. He wakes late, lies there for a moment staring at a blinking <<0000|18:1>>. He shrieks, clutches
         his head, throws on wrinkled clothes, ties his shoes in the elevator, shaves in the
         car, blasting through red lights on the way to the commuter rail. The <<0816|18:1>> train to
         the City pulls in to the station\x{2019}s lower level just as the crazed bureaucrat\x{2019}s car
         screeches into the station\x{2019}s parking lot, and the bureaucrat can see the top of the
         train sitting there idling from across the open lot. This is the very last temporally
         feasible train: if the bureaucrat misses this train he\x{2019}ll be late again, and terminated.
         He hauls into a Handicapped spot and leaves the car there at a crazy angle, vaults
         the turnstile, and takes the stairs down to the platform seven at a time, sweaty and
         bug-eyed. People scream and dive out of his way. As he careers down the long stairway
         he keeps his crazed eyes on the open doors of the <<0816|18:1>> train, willing them to stay
         open just a little longer. Finally, filmed in a glacial slo-mo, the bureaucrat leaps
         from the seventh-to-the-bottom step and lunges toward the train\x{2019}s open doors, and
         right in mid-lunge smashes headlong into an earnest-faced little kid with thick glasses
         and a bow-tie and those nerdy little schoolboy-shorts who\x{2019}s tottering along the platform
         under a tall armful of carefully wrapped packages. Kerwham, they collide. Bureaucrat
         and kid both stagger back from the impact. The kid\x{2019}s packages go flying all over the
         place. The kid recovers his balance and stands there stunned, glasses and bow-tie
         askew. 279 The bureaucrat looks frantically from the kid to the litter of packages to the kid
         to the train\x{2019}s doors, which are still open. The train thrums. Its interior is fluorescent-lit
         and filled with employed, ontologically secure bureaucrats. You can hear the station\x{2019}s
         PA announcer saying something tinny and garbled about departure. The stream of platform
         foot-traffic opens around the bureaucrat and the stunned boy and the litter of packages.
         Ogilvie\x{2019}d once lectured for a whole period on this kid\x{2019}s character as an instance
         of the difference between an antagonist and a deuteragonist in moral drama; he\x{2019}d mentioned
         the child-actor\x{2019}s name over and over. Hal tries whacking himself just over the right
         eye several times, to dislodge the name. The film\x{2019}s bureaucrat\x{2019}s buggy eyes keep going
         back and forth between the train\x{2019}s open doors and the little kid, who\x{2019}s looking steadily
         up at him, almost studious, his eyes big and liquid behind the lenses. Hal doesn\x{2019}t
         remember who played the bureaucrat, either, but it\x{2019}s the kid\x{2019}s name that\x{2019}s driving
         him bats. The bureaucrat\x{2019}s leaning away, inclined way over toward the train doors,
         as if his very cells were being pulled that way. But he keeps looking at the kid,
         the gifts, struggling with himself. It\x{2019}s a clear internal-conflict moment, one of
         Himself\x{2019}s films\x{2019} very few. The bureaucrat\x{2019}s eyes suddenly recede back into their normal
         places in his sockets. He turns from the fluorescent doors and bends to the kid and
         asks if he\x{2019}s OK and says it\x{2019}ll all be OK. He cleans the kid\x{2019}s spectacles with his
         pocket handkerchief, picks the kid\x{2019}s packages up. About halfway through the packages
         the PA issues something final and the train\x{2019}s doors close with a pressurized hiss.
         The bureaucrat gently loads the kid back up with packages, neatens them. The train
         pulls out. The bureaucrat watches the train pull out, expressionless. It\x{2019}s anybody\x{2019}s
         guess what he\x{2019}s thinking. He straightens the kid\x{2019}s bow-tie, kneeling down the way
         adults do when they\x{2019}re ministering to a child, and tells him he\x{2019}s sorry about the
         impact and that it\x{2019}s OK. He turns to go. The platform\x{2019}s mostly empty now. Now the
         strange moment. The kid cranes his neck around the packages and looks up at the guy
         as he starts to walk away:",

         toward each other. Call it <<2214:10h|1>>. The Chinese women and then Lenz all passed a
         gray-faced woman squatting back between two dumpsters, her multiple skirts hiked up.
         Vehicles were packed bumper-flush all along the curb, with myriad double parking also.
         The Chinese women passed a man lined up at the curb with a toy bow and arrows, and
         when the glasses undarkened Lenz could see him as well as he passed also\x{2014}the guy wore
         a rat-colored suit and was shooting a suction-cup arrow at the side of a For Lease
         building and then going up and drawing a miniature chalk circle on the brick around
         the arrow, and then another circle around that circle, and etc., as in a what\x{2019}s the
         word. The women paid him no Orientoid mind. The suit\x{2019}s string tie was also brown in
         tone, unlike a rat\x{2019}s tail. His wall\x{2019}s chalk was more pinkish. One of the women said
         something high-pitched, like an exclamation to the other. Your monkey-languages\x{2019} exclamatories
         have an explosive ricocheting sound to them. As in a component of boing to every word. A window up across the street was producing The Star-Spanned Banner all this time. The man had a string tie and fingerless little gloves, and he stepped
         back from the wall to examine his pink circles and almost collided with Lenz, and
         they both looked at each other and shook their heads like Look at this poor son of
         an urban bitch I\x{2019}m on the same street with.",

            "Sure enough the Chinkette women had been strengthless and lightweight, flew aside
         like dolls, and their bags were indeed treasure-heavy, hard to heft; but as Lenz cut
         left down the north-south alley he could hold the bags by their twine handles out
         slightly before him, so their weight\x{2019}s momentum kind of pulled him along. The cruciform
         alleys through the blocks between Central and Inman in Little Lisbon were a kind of
         second city. Lenz ran. His breath came easy and he could feel himself from scalp to
         sole. Green and green-with-red dumpsters lined both walls and made the going narrow.
         He vaulted two sitting figures in khaki sharing a can of Sterno on the alley floor.
         He glided through the foul air above them, untouched by it. The sounds behind him
         were his footfalls\x{2019} echo off dumpsters and fire-escapes\x{2019} iron. His left hand ached
         nicely from holding both a bag\x{2019}s handle and his large-print volume. A dumpster up
         ahead had been hitched to an E.W.D. truck and just left to sit: probably quitting
         time. The Empire guys had an incredible union. In the recess of the hitch\x{2019}s bar a
         small blue light flickered and died. This was a dozen dumpsters up ahead. Lenz slowed
         to a brisk walk. His topcoat had slipped slightly off one of his shoulders but he
         had no free hand to fix it and wasn\x{2019}t going to take time to put a bag down. His left
         hand felt cramped. It was somewhere vague between 2224 and <<2226h|1>>. The alley was dark
         as a pocket. A tiny crash off somewhere south down the network of alleys was actually
         Poor Tony Krause rolling the steel waste-barrel that tripped up Ruth van Cleve. The
         tiny blue flame came on, hung still, flickered, moved, hung there, went back out.
         Its glow was dark blue against the back of the huge E.W.D. truck. Empire trucks were
         unstrippable, hitches were valuable but locked down with a Kryptonite device thing
         you needed welding stuff to cut through. From the recess of the hitch there were small
         sounds. When the lighter lit again Lenz was almost on them, two boys on the hitch
         and two squatting down by the hitch facing them, four of them, a fire-escape\x{2019}s pull-ladder
         distended like a tongue and hanging just above them. None of the boys was over like
         twelve. They used a M. Fizzy bottle instead of a pipe, and the smell of burnt plastic
         hung mixed with the sicksweet smell of overcarbonated rock. The boys were all small
         and slight and either black or spic, greedily hunching over the flame; they looked
         ratty. Lenz kept them in peripheral view as he strode briskly by, carrying his bags,
         spine straight and extruding dignified purpose. The lighter went out. The boys on
         the hitch eyed Lenz\x{2019}s bags. The squatting boys turned their heads to look. Lenz kept
         them in peripheral view. None of them wore watches. One of them wore a knit cap and
         watched steadily. He locked eyes with Lenz\x{2019}s left eye, made a gun of his thin hand,
         pretended to draw a slow bead. Like performing for the others. Lenz walked by with
         urban dignity, like he both saw them and didn\x{2019}t. The smell was intense but real local,
         of the rock and bottle. He had to veer out to miss the Empire truck\x{2019}s side mirror
         on its steel strut. He heard them say things as the truck\x{2019}s grille fell behind, and
         unkind laughter, and then something called out in a minority agnate he didn\x{2019}t know.
         He heard the lighter\x{2019}s flint. He thought to himself Assholes. He was looking for someplace
         empty and a bit more lit, to go through the bags. And cleaner than this one north-south
         alley here, which smelled of ripe waste and rotting skin. He would separate the bags\x{2019}
         valuables from the nonvaluables and transfer the valuables to a single bag. He would
         fence the nonnegotiable valuables in Little Lisbon and refill the receptacle in his
         medical dictionary, and buy some attractiver shoes. The alley was devroid of cats
         and rodents both; he did not stop to reflect why. A rock or bit of brick courtesy
         of the junior crack-jockeys back there landed behind him and skittered past and rang
         out against something, and someone cried out aloud, a sexless figure lying back against
         a maybe duffel bag or pack against a dumpster, its hand moving furiously in its groin
         and its feet pointed out into the alley and turned out like a dead body\x{2019}s, its shoes
         two different shoes, its hair a clotted mass around its face, looking up over at Lenz
         going past in the faint start of light from a broader alley\x{2019}s intersection ahead,
         chanting softly what Lenz could hear as he stepped gingerly over the rot-smelling
         legs as \x{2018}Pretty, pretty, pretty.\x{2019} Lenz whispered to himself \x{2018}Jesus what a lot of fucked-up

            "At Joelle\x{2019}s first interface with the whole sad family unit\x{2014}Thanksgiving, Headmaster\x{2019}s
         House, E.T.A., straight up Comm. Ave. in Enfield\x{2014}Orin\x{2019}s Moms Mrs. Incandenza (\x{2018}Please
         do call me Avril, Joelle\x{2019}) had been gracious and warm and attentive without obtruding,
         and worked unobtrusively hard to put everyone at ease and to facilitate communication,
         and to make Joelle feel like a welcomed and esteemed part of the family gathering\x{2014}and
         something about the woman made every follicle on Joelle\x{2019}s body pucker and distend.
         It wasn\x{2019}t that Avril Incandenza was one of the tallest women Joelle had ever seen,
         and definitely the tallest pretty older woman with immaculate posture (Dr. Incandenza
         slumped something awful) she\x{2019}d ever met. It wasn\x{2019}t that her syntax was so artless
         and fluid and imposing. Nor the near-sterile cleanliness of the home\x{2019}s downstairs
         (the bathroom\x{2019}s toilet seemed not only scrubbed but waxed to a high shine). And it
         wasn\x{2019}t that Avril\x{2019}s graciousness was in any conventional way fake. It took a long
         time for Joelle even to start to put a finger on what gave her the howling fantods
         about Orin\x{2019}s mother. The dinner itself\x{2014}no turkey; some politico-familial in-joke about
         no turkey on Thanksgiving\x{2014}was delicious without being grandiose. They didn\x{2019}t even
         sit down to eat until <<2300h|1>>. Avril drank champagne out of a little fluted glass whose
         level somehow never went down. Dr. Incandenza (no invitation to call him Jim, she
         noticed) drank at a tri-faceted tumbler of something that made the air above it shimmer
         slightly. Avril put everyone at ease. Orin did credible impressions of famous figures.
         He and little Hal made dry fun of Avril\x{2019}s Canadian pronunciation of certain diphthongs.
         Avril and Dr. Incandenza took turns cutting up Mario\x{2019}s salmon. Joelle had a weird
         half-vision of Avril hiking her knife up hilt-first and plunging it into Joelle\x{2019}s
         breast. Hal Incandenza and two other lopsidedly muscular boys from the tennis school
         ate like refugees and were regarded with gentle amusement. Avril dabbed her mouth
         in a patrician way after every bite. Joelle wore girl-clothes, her dress\x{2019}s neckline
         very high. Hal and Orin looked vaguely alike. Avril directed every fourth comment
         to Joelle, to include her. Orin\x{2019}s brother Mario was stunted and complexly deformed.
         There was a spotless doggie-dish under the table, but no dog, and no mention was ever
         made of a dog. Joelle noticed Avril also directed every fourth comment to Orin, Hal,
         and Mario, like a cycle of even inclusion. There was New York white and Albertan champagne.
         Dr. Incandenza drank his drink instead of wine, and got up several times to freshen
         his drink in the kitchen. A massive hanging garden behind Avril\x{2019}s and Hal\x{2019}s captains\x{2019}
         chairs cut complex shadows into the UV light that made the table\x{2019}s candles\x{2019} glow a
         weird bright blue. The director was so tall he seemed to rise forever, when he rose
         with his tumbler. Joelle had the queerest indefensible feeling that Avril wished her
         ill; she kept feeling different areas of hair stand up. Everybody Please-and-Thank-You\x{2019}d
         in a way that was sheer Yankee WASP. After his second trip to the kitchen, Dr. Incandenza
         molded his twice-baked potatoes into an intricate futuristic cityscape and suddenly
         started to discourse animatedly on the 1946 breakup of Hollywood\x{2019}s monolithic Studio
         system and the subsequent rise of the Method actors Brando, Dean, Clift et al., arguing
         for a causal connection. His voice was mid-range and mild and devoid of accent. Orin\x{2019}s
         Moms had to be over two meters tall, way taller than Joelle\x{2019}s own personal Daddy.
         Joelle could somehow tell Avril was the sort of female who\x{2019}d been ungainly as a girl
         and then blossomed and but who\x{2019}d only become really beautiful later in life, like
         thirty-five. She\x{2019}d decided Dr. Incandenza looked like an ecologically poisoned crane,
         she told him later. Mrs. Incandenza put everyone at ease. Joelle imagined her with
         a conductor\x{2019}s baton. She never did tell Jim that Orin called him The Mad or Sad Stork.
         The whole Thanksgiving table inclined very subtly toward Avril, very slightly and
         subtly, like heliotropes. Joelle found herself doing it too, the inclining. Dr. Incandenza
         kept shading his eyes from the UV plant-light in a gesture that resembled a salute.
         Avril referred to her plants as her Green Babies. At some point out of nowhere, little
         Hal Incandenza, maybe ten, announced that the basic unit of luminous intensity is
         the Candela, which he defined for no one in particular as the luminous intensity of
         1/600,000 of a square meter of a cavity at the freezing-temperature of platinum. All
         the table\x{2019}s males wore coats and ties. The larger of Hal\x{2019}s two tennis partners passed
         out dental stimulators, and no one made fun of him. Mario\x{2019}s grin seemed both obscene
         and sincere. Hal, whom Joelle wasn\x{2019}t crazy about, kept asking wasn\x{2019}t anybody going
         to ask him the freezing-temperature of platinum. Joelle and Dr. Incandenza found themselves
         in a small conversation about Bazin, a film-theorist Himself detested, making a tormented
         face at the name. Joelle intrigued the optical scientist and director by explaining
         Bazin\x{2019}s disparagement of self-conscious directorial expression as historically connected
         to the neo-Thomist Realism of the \x{2018}Personalistes,\x{2019} an aesthetic school of great influence over French Catholic intellectuals circa
         1930\x{2013}1940\x{2014}many of Bazin\x{2019}s teachers had been eminent Personalistes. Avril encouraged Joelle to describe rural Kentucky. Orin did a long impression of
         late pop-astronomer Carl Sagan expressing televisual awe at the cosmos\x{2019} scale. \x{2018}Billions
         and billions,\x{2019} he said. One of the tennis friends burped just awfully, and no one
         reacted to the sound in any way. Orin said \x{2018}Billions and billions and billions\x{2019} in the voice of Sagan. Avril and Hal had a brief good-natured argument about whether
         the term circa could modify an interval or only a specific year. Then Hal asked for several examples
         of something called Haplology. Joelle kept fighting urges to slap the sleek little
         show-offy kid upside the head so hard his bow-tie would spin. \x{2018}The universe:\x{2019}\x{2014}Orin
         continued long after the wit had worn thin\x{2014}\x{2018}cold, immense, incredibly universal.\x{2019}
         The subjects of tennis, baton-twirling, and punting never came up: organized sports
         were never once mentioned. Joelle noticed that nobody seemed to look directly at Dr.
         Incandenza except her. A curious flabby white mammarial dome covered part of the Academy\x{2019}s
         grounds outside the dining room\x{2019}s window. Mario plunged his special fork into Dr.
         Incandenza\x{2019}s potato-cityscape, to general applause and certain grating puns on the
         term deconstruction from the insufferable Hal kid. Everyone\x{2019}s teeth were dazzling in the candlelight
         and UV. Hal wiped Mario\x{2019}s snout, which seemed to run continuously. Avril invited Joelle
         by all means to make a Thanksgiving call home to her family in rural Kentucky if she
         wished. Orin said the Moms was herself originally from rural Qu\x{e9}bec. Joelle was on
         her seventh glass of wine. Orin\x{2019}s fingering his half-Windsor kept looking more and
         more like a signal to somebody. Avril urged Dr. Incandenza to find a way to include
         Joelle in a production, since she was both a film student and a now a heartily welcome
         honorary addition to the family. Mario, reaching for the salad, fell out of his chair,
         and was helped up by one of the tennis players amid much hilarity. Mario\x{2019}s deformities
         seemed wide-ranging and hard to name. Joelle decided he looked like a cross between
         a puppet and one of the big-headed carnivores from Spielberg\x{2019}s old special-effects
         orgies about reptiles. Hal and Avril hashed out whether misspoke was a bona fide word. Dr. Incandenza\x{2019}s tall narrow head kept inclining toward his
         plate and then slowly rising back up in a way that was either meditative or tipsy.
         Deformed Mario\x{2019}s broad smile was so constant you could have hung things from the corners
         of it. In a fake Southern-belle accent that was clearly no jab at Joelle, more like
         a Scarlett O\x{2019}Hara accent, Avril said she did declare that Albertan champagne always
         gave her \x{2018}the vapors.\x{2019} Joelle noticed that pretty much everybody at the table was
         smiling, broadly and constantly, eyes shiny in the plants\x{2019} odd light. She was doing
         it herself, too, she noticed; her cheek muscles were starting to ache. Hal\x{2019}s larger
         friend kept pausing to use his dental stimulator. Nobody else was using their dental
         stimulator, but everyone held one politely, as if getting ready to use it. Hal and
         the two friends made odd spasmic one-handed squeezing motions, periodically. No one
         seemed to notice. Not once in Orin\x{2019}s presence did anyone mention the word tennis. He had been up half the previous night vomiting with anxiety. Now he challenged
         Hal to name the freezing-point of platinum. Joelle couldn\x{2019}t for the life of her remember
         either of the names of poor old Spielberg\x{2019}s old computer-enhanced celluloid dinosaur
         things, though her own Daddy\x{2019}d personally taken her to each one. At some point Orin\x{2019}s
         father got up to go freshen his drink and never returned.",

         have been counted on to see that the Stork needed to use Joelle somehow, it was the
         Moms. He asked Joelle twice how she\x{2019}d liked her. Joelle\x{2019}s cheek muscles ached something

         cut to\x{2014}as is often the case, it wasn\x{2019}t until Madame Psychosis got to college and gradually
         acquired some psychic distance and matter for emotional comparison that she even began
         to see how creepy her reagent-Daddy\x{2019}s regression had been, and not until a certain
         major-sport-star son\x{2019}s autograph on a punctured football inspired more e-mailed suspicion
         and sarcasm than gratitude from home in KY that she began even to suspect that her

         intrusive discouragement as with her actaeonizing pubescent charms. That\x{2014}pausing briefly
         to spell actaeonizing\x{2014}the shit had hit the intergenerational psychic fan when Madame Psychosis brought
         the Auteur\x{2019}s little rotter of a son home to the KY spread for the third time, for
         Thanksgiving in the Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad, and witnessing her Daddy\x{2019}s infantilizing
         conduct of her and her mother\x{2019}s wordless compulsive canning and cooking, not to mention
         the terrific tension that resulted when Madame Psychosis attempted to move some of
         the stuffed animals out of her room to make room for the Auteur\x{2019}s son, in short experiencing
         her home and Daddy through the comparative filter of enmeshment with the Auteur\x{2019}s
         son brought Madame Psychosis to the crisis that precipitates Speaking the Unspeakable;
         and that it had been at Thanksgiving Dinner, at <<midday|13>> on 24 November Y.T.M.P., when
         the low-pH Daddy began not only cutting up Madame Psychosis\x{2019}s plate\x{2019}s turkey for her
         but mashing it into puree between the tines of his fork, all under the raised comparative
         eyebrows of the Auteur\x{2019}s son, that Madame Psychosis finally aired the unspoken question
         of why, with her now of legal age and living with a male and retired from childhood\x{2019}s
         twirling and carving out an adult career on one and potentially two sides of the film-camera,
         did her own personal Daddy seem to feel she needed help to chew? Molly Notkin\x{2019}s secondhand
         take on the emotional eruptions that ensued is not detailed, but she feels she can
         state w/ confidence that it\x{2019}s plausibly a case of any kind of system that\x{2019}s been under
         enormous silent pressure for some time, that when the system finally blows the accreted
         pressure\x{2019}s such that it\x{2019}s almost always a full-scale eruption. The low-pH Daddy\x{2019}s
         enormous stress had apparently erupted, right there at the table, with his grown daughter\x{2019}s
         white meat between his tines, in the confession that he\x{2019}d been secretly, silently
         in love with Madame Psychosis from way, way back; that the love had been the real
         thing, pure, unspoken, genuflectory, timeless, impossible; that he never touched her,
         wouldn\x{2019}t, nor ogle, less out of a horror of being the sort of mid-South father who
         touched and ogled than out of the purity of his doomed love for the little girl he\x{2019}d
         escorted to the movies as proudly as any beau, daily; that the repression and disguisability
         of his pure love hadn\x{2019}t been all that hard when Madame Psychosis had been juvenile
         and sexless, but that at the onset of puberty and nubility the pressure\x{2019}d become so
         great that he could compensate only by regressing the child mentally to an age of
         incontinence and pre-mashed meat, and that his awareness of how creepy his denial
         of her maturation must have seemed\x{2014}even though neither the daughter nor mother, even
         now wordlessly chewing a candied yam, had remarked on it, the denial and creepiness,
         although the man\x{2019}s beloved pointers were given to whimper and scratch at the door
         when the denial had gotten especially creepy (animals being way more sensitive than
         humans to emotional anomalies, in Molly Notkin\x{2019}s experience)\x{2014}had raised his internal
         limbic system\x{2019}s pressure to near intolerable foot-kilo levels, and that he\x{2019}d been
         hanging on for dear life for the past nigh on now a decade, but that now that he\x{2019}d
         had to actually stand witness to the removal of Pooky and Urgle-Bear et al. from her
         ballerina-wallpapered room to make space for a nonrelated mature male whose physical
         vigor through the peephole the Daddy\x{2019}d exerted every gram of trembling will he\x{2019}d possessed

         in and pulled up a chair and straddled it backwards like a slow-tease stripper, slumping
         and draping his arms over the back of the chair, gesturing with an unlit rodney as
         he spoke. He told Gately that man he looked like shit something heavy had fell on.
         But he told Gately he should get a gander of the other guys, the Nucks in Polynesian-wear.
         Thrust and the House Manager had got there before E.M.P.H.H. Security could drag the
         Finest away from issuing <<midnight|13>> street-side citations down on Comm. Ave., he told
         Gately. Lenz and Green and Alfonso Parias-Carbo had dragged/carried the passed-out
         Gately inside and laid him on the black vinyl couch in Pat\x{2019}s office, where Gately
         had come to and told them ixnay on the ambulanceay and to please wake him up in five
         more minutes, and then passed out for serious real. Parias-Carbo seemed like he\x{2019}d
         suffered a mild intestinal hernia from dragging/carrying Gately, but he was being
         a man about it and had refused codeine downstairs at the E.R. and was expressing gratitude
         for the growth experience, and the thoraxic lump was receding nicely. Calvin Thrust\x{2019}s
         breath smelled of smoke and old scrambled eggs. Gately had once seen a cheap bootleg
         cartridge of a young Calvin Thrust having sex with a lady with only one arm on what
         looked like a crude homemade trapeze. The cartridge\x{2019}s lighting and production values
         had been real low-quality, and Gately had been in and out of a Demerol-nod, but he
         was 98% sure it had been the young Calvin Thrust. Calvin Thrust said how right there
         over Gately\x{2019}s unconscious form in the office Randy Lenz had begun womaning right off
         how of course he, Randy Lenz, was going to somehow get blamed for Gately and the Nucks
         getting fucked up and why didn\x{2019}t they just get it over with and give him the administrative
         Shoe right now without going through the sham motions of deliberating. Bruce Green
         had rammed Lenz up against Pat\x{2019}s cabinets and shaken him like a margarita, but refused
         to rat out Lenz or say why irate Canadians might think a specimen as dickless as Lenz
         might have demapped their friend. The matter was under investigation, but Thrust confessed
         to a certain admiration for Green\x{2019}s refusal to eat cheese. Brucie G. had suffered
         a broken nose in the beef and now had a terrific set of twin shiners. Calvin Thrust
         said both he, Calvin Thrust, and the House Manager had immediately on arrival pegged
         Lenz as either coked up or \x{2019}drined to the gills on some \x{2019}drine, and Thrust said he
         summoned every Oreida of self-control sobriety\x{2019}d blessed him with and had quietly
         taken Lenz out of the office into the special Disabled Bedroom next door and over
         the sound of Burt F. Smith coughing up little pieces of lung in his sleep he said
         he\x{2019}d real controlledly given Lenz the choice of voluntarily resigning his Ennet residency
         on the spot or submitting to a spot-urine and a room-search and everything like that,
         plus to questioning by the Finest, who were pretty doubtless even now on route with
         the fleet of ambulances for the Nucks. Meanwhile, Thrust said\x{2014}gesturing with the gasper
         and occasionally leaning forward to see whether Gately was still conscious and to
         tell him he looked like shit, meanwhile\x{2014}Gately had been lying there passed out, wedged
         with two full filing cabinets to keep him from rolling off the couch he was wider
         than, and was bleeding in a very big way, and nobody knew how to, like, affix a turnipcut to a shoulder, and the good-bodied new girl with the cloth mask was bending
         over the arm of the couch applying pressure to towels on Gately\x{2019}s bleeding, and her
         partly-open robe was yielding a view that even brought Alfonso P.-C. around from his
         herniated fetal posture on the floor, and Thrust and the House Manager were taking
         turns Asking for Help to intuitively know what they ought to do with Gately, because
         it was well known that he was on Probie against a real serious bit, and with all due
         trust and respect to Don it wasn\x{2019}t clear at that point from the scattered damaged
         Canadian forms still in different prone positions out in the street who\x{2019}d done what
         to who in defense of whatever or not, and the Finest tend to take a keen interest
         in huge guys who come into E.R.\x{2019}s with spectacular gunshot wounds, and but then when
         Pat M. pulled up in the Aventura laying rubber a couple minutes later she\x{2019}d screamed
         rather unserenely at Thrust for not having already rikky-ticked Don Gately over to
         St. E.\x{2019}s on his own already. Thrust said he\x{2019}d let go of Pat\x{2019}s screaming like water
         off a duck, revealing that Pat M. had been under felony-weight domestic stress at
         home, he knew. He said and but so Gately was too heavy to carry unconscious for more
         than a few meters, even with the masked girl filling in for Parias-Carbo, and they\x{2019}d
         just barely got Gately outside still in his wet bowling shirt and laid him briefly
         on the sidewalk and covered him with Pat\x{2019}s black suede car-coat while Thrust maneuvered
         his beloved Corvette up as close to Gately as possible. The sounds of sirens on the
         way up Comm. Ave. mixed with the sounds of severely fucked-up Canadians returning
         to whatever passed with Nucks for consciousness and calling for what they called medecins, and with the crazed-squirrel sound of Lenz trying to start his rusted-out brown Duster,
         which had a bad solenoid. They\x{2019}d heaved Gately\x{2019}s dead weight in the \x{2019}Vette and Pat
         M. drove interference like a madwoman in her turbocharged Aventura. Pat let the masked
         girl ride shotgun with her because the masked girl wouldn\x{2019}t quit asking her to let
         her come too. The House Manager stayed behind to represent Ennet House to E.M.P.H.H.
         Security and the somewhat less bullshittable BPD-Finest. The sirens got steadily closer,
         which added to the confusion because senile and mobile-vegetable residents of both
         Unit #4 and the Shed had been drawn out on the frozen lawns by the freakas, and the
         mix of several kinds of sirens didn\x{2019}t do them a bit of good, and they started flapping
         and shrieking and running around and adding to the medical confusion of the whole
         scene, which by the time him and Pat pulled out of there was a fucking millhouse and
         everything like that. Thrust asks rhetorically how much does Don fucking weigh, anyway, because moving the front buckets way up to where like dwarfs put them and
         putting Gately\x{2019}s carcass across the back seat of the \x{2019}Vette had required all available
         hands and even Burt F.S.\x{2019}s stumps, had been like trying to get something humongous
         through a door that\x{2019}s way smaller than the humongous thing was and everything like
         that. Thrust occasionally tapped his gasper like he thought it was lit. The first
         squad cars had come fishtailing around the Warren-Comm. corner just as they all came
         out of the E.M. driveway onto Warren. Pat in her car up ahead had made an arm-motion
         that could have been either waving coolly at the passing Finest or uncoolly clutching
         her head. Thrust said had he mentioned Gately\x{2019}s blood? Gately\x{2019}d bled all over Pat
         M.\x{2019}s vinyl couch and filing cabinets and carpet, the little E.M. streetlet, the sidewalk,
         Pat M.\x{2019}s black suede car-coat, pretty much everybody\x{2019}s winter coats, and the beloved
         upholstery of Thrust\x{2019}s beloved Corvette, which upholstery Thrust might add had been
         new, and dear. But he said not to worry about it, Thrust said: the fucking blood was
         the least of the problems. Gately didn\x{2019}t like the sound of that at all, and started
         trying to blink at him in a kind of crude code, to get his attention, but Thrust either
         didn\x{2019}t notice it or thought it was like a postoperative tic. Thrust\x{2019}s hair was always
         combed straight back like a mobster. Thrust said at the St. E.\x{2019}s E.R. how the E.R.
         crew had been quick and ingenious about getting Gately out of the \x{2019}Vette and onto
         a double-width gurney, though they did have some trouble lifting the gurney so they
         could get the legs with wheels set up under it so the guys in white could roll him
         in with more guys in white walking briskly alongside of him and leaning over him and
         applying pressure and barking little orders in terse code like they always do in E.R.s
         and everything like that, in emergencies. Thrust says he couldn\x{2019}t tell if they could
         tell right away it was a spectacular gunshot wound, nobody used the G-word or anything
         like that. Thrust had babbled something about a chain-saw while Pat nodded furiously.
         The chief two things Gately kept blinking rhythmically to try to find out were: did
         anybody end up getting killed, meaning the Nucks; and has this one certain A.D.A.-type
         figure that always wore a hat come in from Essex County or given any sign of getting
         wind of Gately\x{2019}s whereabouts or involvement; and\x{2014}so really three things\x{2014}and will any
         of the Ennet House residents that were right there on the scene from start to finish
         look respectable enough on paper to have creditibility as like legal witnesses. Plus
         he wouldn\x{2019}t mind knowing what the fuck Thrust was thinking of, scaring Lenz off and
         letting him screw off into the urban night leaving Gately maybe holding the statutory
         bag. Most of Calvin Thrust\x{2019}s legality-experience was filmic and petty-vice. Thrust
         eventually describes that one of the House Manager\x{2019}s key coups of quick thinking was
         doing a quick TP-scan and finding out which of the residents out there milling around
         with the catatonics on the street had up-in-the-air legal issues such that they needed
         to be secloistered in the protected area of the House out of legal sight by the time
         the BPD\x{2019}s Finest hit the scene. He says in his view it was lucky for Gately that he
         (Gately) was such a massive son of a bitch and had so much blood, because even so
         Gately\x{2019}d lost huge volumes of blood all over people\x{2019}s upholstery and was in shock
         and everything like that by the time they got him on the double-width gurney, his
         face cheese-colored and his lips blue and muttering all this shock-type stuff, but
         even so here he (Gately) was, not exactly ready for a GQ cover but still sucking air. Thrust said in the waiting room at the E.R., where they
         wouldn\x{2019}t let a working man smoke down there either, he said then the arrogant new
         girl resident in the white veil had up and tried to take Thrust\x{2019}s inventory for letting
         Randy L. resign and decamp before his part in Gately\x{2019}s legal embryoglio could be nailed
         down, and Pat M. had been pretty unconditionally loving about it but it was obvious
         she wasn\x{2019}t thrilled with Thrust\x{2019}s tactics either and everything like that. Gately
         blinked furiously to signify his agreement with Joelle\x{2019}s position. Calvin Thrust gestured
         stoically with his cigarette and said he\x{2019}d told Pat M. the truth: he always told the
         truth, no matter how unpleasant for himself, today: he said he\x{2019}d said he\x{2019}d encouraged
         Lenz to rikky-tick out of there because otherwise he was afraid that he (Thrust) was
         going to eliminate Lenz\x{2019}s map on the spot, out of rage. Lenz\x{2019}s solenoid appeared to
         have been on the permanent dicky, because the rusty Duster was seen by new resident
         Amy J. real early the next A.M. getting towed from its wrong-side-of-the-street spot in front of #3 when Amy J. slunk
         back to the House all jonesy and hungover to get her Hefty bag full of evicted personal
         shit, Lenz apparently having abandoned his wheels and fleen off by foot during all
         the Finest\x{2019}s confusion and static with the ambulance drivers that who could blame
         them didn\x{2019}t want to take Canadians because of horrible paperwork for Health Card reimbursement
         for Nucks. The House Manager had gone so far as planting herself out in front of the
         House\x{2019}s locked front door with her not-all-that-small arms and legs spread out, blocking
         the door, assertively stating at whatever Finest tried to enter that Ennet House was
         court-mandated Protected by the Commonwealth of MA and could only be entered with
         a Court Order and three working days\x{2019} mandated time for the House to file an injunction
         and wait for a ruling, and the Finest and even the booger-eating morons from E.M.P.H.H.
         Security were successfully held in bay and kept out, therefore, by her, alone, and
         Pat M. was considering rewarding the House Manager\x{2019}s coolness under fire by promoting
         her to Assistant Director next month when the present Assistant Director left to go
         get certified in jet-engine maintenance at East Coast Aerotech on a Mass Rehab grant.",

            '[< 00:00] Infinite Jest - David Foster Wallace.epub (OEBPS/InfiniteJest_chap-20h.html) - before midnight',
            "A recurring bad dream Gately\x{2019}s had ever since he gave up and Came In and got straight
         consists simply of a tiny acne-scarred Oriental woman looking down at him. Nothing
         else happens; she\x{2019}s just looking down at Gately. Her acne scars aren\x{2019}t even all that
         bad. The thing is that she\x{2019}s tiny. She\x{2019}s one of those tiny little anonymous Oriental
         women you see all over metro Boston, always seeming to be carrying multiple shopping
         bags. But in the recurring dream she\x{2019}s looking down at him, from his perspective he\x{2019}s looking up and she\x{2019}s looking down, which means
         Gately in the dream is either (a) lying down on his back looking vulnerably up at
         her or (b) is himself even more incredibly tiny than the woman. Involved in the dream
         also in a menacing way somehow is a dog standing rigidly in the distance past the
         Oriental woman, motionless and rigid, in profile, standing there still and straight
         as a toy. The Oriental woman has no particular expression and never says anything,
         though her face\x{2019}s scars have a certain elusive pattern to them that seems like it
         wants to mean something. When Gately opens his eyes again Geoffrey Day\x{2019}s gone, and
         his hospital bed with its railings and I.V. bottles on stands has been moved way over
         so that it\x{2019}s right up next to the bed of whoever the person in the room\x{2019}s other bed
         is, so it\x{2019}s like Gately and this unknown patient are a sexless old couple sleeping
         together but in separate beds, and Gately\x{2019}s mouth goes oval and his eyes bug out with
         horror, and his effort at yelling hurts enough to wake him up, and his eyelids shoot
         up and rattle like old windowshades, and his hospital bed\x{2019}s back where it\x{2019}s always
         been, and a nurse is giving the anonymous guy in the other bed some sort of late-night-type
         shot you could tell was narcotic, and the patient, who has a very deep voice, is crying.
         Then somewhere later in the couple of hours <<before midnight|13>>\x{2019}s parking-switch symphony
         on Washington St. outside is an unpleasantly detailed dream where the ghostish figure
         that\x{2019}s been flickering in and out of sight around the room finally stays in one spot
         long enough for Gately to really check him out. In the dream it\x{2019}s the figure of a
         very tall sunken-chested man in black-frame glasses and a sweatshirt with old stained
         chinos, leaning back sort of casually or else morosely slumped, resting its tailbone
         against the window sill\x{2019}s ventilator\x{2019}s whispering grille, with its long arms hanging
         at its sides and its ankles casually crossed so that Gately can even see the detail
         that the ghostly chinos aren\x{2019}t long enough for its height, they\x{2019}re the kind kids used
         to call \x{2018}Highwaters\x{2019} in Gately\x{2019}s childhood\x{2014}a couple of Bimmy Gately\x{2019}s savager pals
         would corner some pencil-necked kid in those-type too-short trousers on the playground
         and go like \x{2018}Yo little brother where\x{2019}s the fucking flood?\x{2019} and then lay the kid out with a head-slap or chest-shove so the inevitable violin
         went skittering ass-over-teakettle across the blacktop, in its case. The creepy ghostish
         figure\x{2019}s arm sometimes, like, vanishes and then reappears at the bridge of its nose,
         pushing the glasses up in a weary unconscious morose gesture, just like those kids
         in the Highwater pants on the playground always did in a weak morose way that always
         somehow made Gately himself want to shove them savagely in the chest. Gately in the
         dream experienced a painful adrenal flash of remorse and entertained the possibility
         that the figure represented one of the North Shore violin-playing kids he\x{2019}d never
         kept his savage pals from abusing, now come in an adult state when Gately was vulnerable
         and mute, to exact some kind of payback. The ghostly figure shrugged its thin shoulders
         and said But no, it was nothing of the sort, it was just a plain old wraith, one without
         any sort of grudge or agenda, just a generic garden-variety wraith. Gately sarcastically
         in the dream thought that Oh well then if it was just a garden-variety wraith, is all, geez what a fucking relief. The wraith-figure smiled apologetically and shrugged, shifting its tailbone on the
         whispering grille a bit. There was an odd quality to its movements in the dream: they
         were of regulation speed, the movements, but they seemed oddly segmented and deliberate,
         as if more effort than necessary were going into them somehow. Then Gately considered
         that who knew what was necessary or normal for a self-proclaimed generic wraith in
         a pain-and-fever dream. Then he considered that this was the only dream he could recall
         where even in the dream he knew that it was a dream, much less lay there considering
         the fact that he was considering the up-front dream quality of the dream he was dreaming.
         It quickly got so multilevelled and confusing that his eyes rolled back in his head.
         The wraith made a weary morose gesture as if not wanting to bother to get into any
         sort of confusing dream-v.-real controversies. The wraith said Gately might as well
         stop trying to figure it out and just capitalize on its presence, the wraith\x{2019}s presence
         in the room or dream, whatever, because Gately, if he\x{2019}d bothered to notice and appreciate
         it, at least didn\x{2019}t have to speak out loud to be able to interface with the wraith-figure;
         and also the wraith-figure said it was by the way requiring incredible patience and
         fortitude for him (the wraith) to stay in one position long enough for Gately to really
         see him and interface with him, and the wraith was making no promises about how many
         more months he (the wraith) could keep it up, since fortitude had never seemed to
         have been his long suit. The city\x{2019}s aggregate nighttime lights lightened the sky through
         the room\x{2019}s window to the same dark rose shade you see when you close your eyes, adding
         to the dream-of-dream-type ambiguity. Gately in the dream tried the test of pretending
         to lose consciousness so the wraith would go away, and then somewhere during the pretense
         lost consciousness and really did sleep, for a bit, in the dream, because the tiny
         pocked Oriental woman was back and looking wordlessly down at him, plus the creepy
         rigid dog. And then the sedated patient in the next bed woke Gately back up, in the
         original dream, with some kind of narcotized gurgle or snore, and the so-called wraith-figure
         was still there and visible, only now it was standing on top of the railing at the
         side of Gately\x{2019}s bed, looking down at him now from a towering railing-plus-original-tallness
         height, having to exaggerate his shoulders\x{2019} natural slump in order to clear the ceiling.
         Gately got a clear view of an impressive thatch of nostril-hair, looking up into the
         wraith\x{2019}s nostrils, and also a clear lateral look at the wraith\x{2019}s skinny ankles\x{2019} like
         ankle-bones bulging in brown socks below the cuffs of the Highwater chinos. As much
         as his shoulder, calf, toe, and whole right side were hurting, it occurred to Gately
         that you don\x{2019}t normally think of wraiths or ghostish phantasms as being tall or short,
         or having bad posture, or wearing certain-colored socks. Much less having anything
         as specific as extrusive nostril-hair. There was a degree of, what, specificness about this figure in this dream that Gately found troubling. Much less having the
         unpleasant old-Oriental-woman dream inside this dream right here. He began to wish again that he could call out for assistance
         or to wake himself up. But now not even moos or mews would come, all he could seem
         to do was pant real hard, as if the air was like totally missing his vocal box, or like his vocal
         box was totally demapped from nerve-damage in his shoulder and now just sort of hung
         there all withered and dry like an old hornet nest while air rushed out Gately\x{2019}s throat
         all around it. His throat still didn\x{2019}t feel right. It was exactly the suffocated speechlessness
         in dreams, nightmares, Gately realized. This was both terrifying and reassuring, somehow.
         Evidence for the dream-element and so on and so forth. The wraith was looking down
         at him and nodding sympathetically. The wraith could empathize totally, it said. The
         wraith said Even a garden-variety wraith could move at the speed of quanta and be
         anywhere anytime and hear in symphonic toto the thoughts of animate men, but it couldn\x{2019}t
         ordinarily affect anybody or anything solid, and it could never speak right to anybody,
         a wraith had no out-loud voice of its own, and had to use somebody\x{2019}s like internal
         brain-voice if it wanted to try to communicate something, which was why thoughts and
         insights that were coming from some wraith always just sound like your own thoughts,
         from inside your own head, if a wraith\x{2019}s trying to interface with you. The wraith
         says By way of illustration consider phenomena like intuition or inspiration or hunches,
         or when someone for instance says \x{2018}a little voice inside\x{2019} was telling them such-and-such
         on an intuitive basis. Gately can now take no more than a third of a normal breath
         without wanting to throw up from the pain. The wraith was pushing his glasses up and
         saying Besides, it took incredible discipline and fortitude and patient effort to
         stay stock-still in one place for long enough for an animate man actually to see and
         be in any way affected by a wraith, and very few wraiths had anything important enough
         to interface about to be willing to stand still for this kind of time, preferring
         ordinarily to whiz around at the invisible speed of quanta. The wraith says It doesn\x{2019}t
         really matter whether Gately knows what the term quanta means. He says Wraiths by and large exist (putting his arms out slowly and making
         little quotation-mark finger-wiggles as he said exist) in a totally different Heisenbergian dimension of rate-change and time-passage.
         As an example, he goes on, normal animate men\x{2019}s actions and motions look, to a wraith,
         to be occurring at about the rate a clock\x{2019}s hour-hand moves, and are just about as
         interesting to look at. Gately was thinking for fuck\x{2019}s sake what was this, now even
         in unpleasant fever-dreams now somebody else is going to tell him their troubles now
         that Gately can\x{2019}t get away or dialogue back with anything about his own experience.
         He normally couldn\x{2019}t ever get Ewell or Day to sit down for any kind of real or honest
         mutual sharing, and now that he\x{2019}s totally mute and inert and passive all of a sudden
         everybody seems to view him as a sympathetic ear, or not even a sympathetic real ear, more like a wooden carving or statue of an ear. An empty confessional booth.
         Don G. as huge empty confessional booth. The wraith disappears and instantly reappears
         in a far corner of the room, waving Hi at him. It was slightly reminiscent of \x{2018}Bewitched\x{2019}
         reruns from Gately\x{2019}s toddlerhood. The wraith disappears again and again just as instantly
         reappears, now holding one of Gately\x{2019}s Ennet House basement flea-baggy Staff bedroom\x{2019}s
         cut-out-and-Scotch-taped celebrity photos, this one an old one of U.S. Head of State
         Johnny Gentle, Famous Crooner, on stage, wearing velour, twirling a mike, from back
         in the days before he went to a copper-colored toupee, when he used a strigil instead
         of a UV flash-booth and was just a Vegas crooner. Again the wraith disappears and
         instantly reappears holding a can of Coke, with good old Coke\x{2019}s distinctive interwoven
         red and white French curls on it but alien unfamiliar Oriental-type writing on it
         instead of the good old words Coca-Cola and Coke. The unfamiliar script on the Coke can is maybe the whole dream\x{2019}s worst moment. The
         wraith walks jerkily and overdeliberately across the floor and then up a wall, occasionally
         disappearing and then reappearing, sort of fluttering mistily, and ends up standing
         upside-down on the hospital room\x{2019}s drop ceiling, directly over Gately, and holds one
         knee to its sunken chest and starts doing what Gately would know were pirouettes if
         he\x{2019}d ever once been exposed to ballet, pirouetting faster and faster and then so fast
         the wraith\x{2019}s nothing but a long stalk of sweatshirt-and-Coke-can-colored light that
         seems to extrude from the ceiling; and then, in a moment that rivals the Coke-can
         moment for unpleasantness, into Gately\x{2019}s personal mind, in Gately\x{2019}s own brain-voice
         but with roaring and unwilled force, comes the term PIROUETTE, in caps, which term Gately knows for a fact he doesn\x{2019}t have any idea what it means
         and no reason to be thinking it with roaring force, so the sensation is not only creepy
         but somehow violating, a sort of lexical rape. Gately begins to consider this hopefully
         nonrecurring dream even more unpleasant than the tiny-pocked-Oriental-woman dream,
         overall. Other terms and words Gately knows he doesn\x{2019}t know from a divot in the sod
         now come crashing through his head with the same ghastly intrusive force, e.g. ACCIACCATURA and ALEMBIC, LATRODECTUS MACTANS and NEUTRAL DENSITY POINT, CHIAROSCURO and PROPRIOCEPTION and TESTUDO and ANNULATE and BRICOLAGE and CATALEPT and GERRYMANDER and SCOPOPHILIA and LAERTES\x{2014}and all of a sudden it occurs to Gately the aforethought EXTRUDING, STRIGIL and LEXICAL themselves\x{2014}and LORDOSIS and IMPOST and SINISTRAL and MENISCUS and CHRONAXY and POOR YORICK and LUCULUS and CERISE MONTCLAIR and then DE SICA NEO-REAL CRANE DOLLY and CIRCUMAMBIENTFOUNDDRAMALEVIRATEMARRIAGE and then more lexical terms and words speeding up to chipmunkish and then HELIATED and then all the way up to a sound like a mosquito on speed, and Gately tries to
         clutch both his temples with one hand and scream, but nothing comes out. When the
         wraith reappears, it\x{2019}s seated way up behind him where Gately has to let his eyes roll
         way back in his head to see him, and it turns out Gately\x{2019}s heart is being medically
         monitored and the wraith is seated up on the heart monitor in a strange cross-legged
         posture with his pantcuffs pulled up so high Gately could see the actual skinny hairless
         above-the-sock skin of the wraith\x{2019}s ankles, glowing a bit in the spilled light of
         the Trauma Wing hall. The Oriental can of Coke now rests on Gately\x{2019}s broad flat forehead.
         It\x{2019}s cold and smells a little funny, like low tide, the can. Now footsteps and the
         sound of bubblegum in the hall. An orderly shines a flashlight in and plays it over
         Gately and the narcotized roommate and environs, and makes marks on a clipboard while
         blowing a small orange bubble. It\x{2019}s not like the light passes through the wraith or
         anything dramatic\x{2014}the wraith simply disappears the instant the light hits the heart
         monitor and reappears the instant it moves away. Gately\x{2019}s unpleasant dreams definitely
         don\x{2019}t normally include specific gum-color and intense physical discomfort and invasions
         of lexical terms he doesn\x{2019}t know from shinola. Gately begins to conclude it\x{2019}s not
         impossible that the garden-variety wraith on the heart monitor, though not conventionally
         real, could be a sort of epiphanyish visitation from Gately\x{2019}s personally confused
         understanding of God, a Higher Power or something, maybe sort of like the legendary
         Pulsing Blue Light that AA founder Bill W. historically saw during his last detox,
         that turned out to be God telling him how to stay sober via starting AA and Carrying
         The Message. The wraith smiles sadly and says something like Don\x{2019}t we both wish, young
         sir. Gately\x{2019}s forehead wrinkling as his eyes keep rolling up makes the foreign can
         wobble coldly: of course there\x{2019}s also the possibility that the tall slumped extremely
         fast wraith might represent the Sergeant at Arms, the Disease, exploiting the loose
         security of Gately\x{2019}s fever-addled mind, getting ready to fuck with his motives and
         persuade him to accept Demerol just once, just one last time, for the totally legitimate
         medical pain. Gately lets himself wonder what it would be like, able to quantum off
         anyplace instantly and stand on ceilings and probably burgle like no burglar\x{2019}d ever
         dreamed of, but not able to really affect anything or interface with anybody, having
         nobody know you\x{2019}re there, having people\x{2019}s normal rushed daily lives look like the
         movements of planets and suns, having to sit patiently very still in one place for
         a long time even to have some poor addled son of a bitch even be willing to entertain
         your maybe being there. It\x{2019}d be real free-seeming, but incredibly lonely, he imagines.
         Gately knows a thing or two about loneliness, he feels. Does wraith mean like a ghost, as in dead? Is this a message from a Higher Power about sobriety
         and death? What would it be like to try and talk and have the person think it was
         just their own mind talking? Gately could maybe Identify, to an extent, he decides.
         This is the only time he\x{2019}s ever been struck dumb except for a brief but nasty bout
         of pleuritic laryngitis he\x{2019}d had when he was twenty-four and sleeping on the cold
         beach up in Gloucester, and he doesn\x{2019}t like it a bit, the being struck dumb. It\x{2019}s
         like some combination of invisibility and being buried alive, in terms of the feeling.
         It\x{2019}s like being strangled somewhere deeper inside you than your neck. Gately imagines
         himself with a piratical hook, unable to speak on Commitments because he can only
         gurgle and pant, doomed to an AA life of ashtrays and urns. The wraith reaches down
         and removes the can of un-American tonic from Gately\x{2019}s forehead and assures Gately
         he can more than Identify with an animate man\x{2019}s feelings of communicative impotence
         and mute strangulation. Gately\x{2019}s thoughts become agitated as he tries to yell mentally
         that he never said a fucking thing about impotence. He\x{2019}s got a way clearer and more direct view of the wraith\x{2019}s extreme nostril-hair
         situation than he\x{2019}d prefer to. The wraith hefts the can absently and says age twenty-eight
         seems old enough for Gately to remember U.S. broadcast television\x{2019}s old network situation
         comedies of the B.S. \x{2019}80s and \x{2019}90s, probably. Gately has to smile at the wraith\x{2019}s
         cluelessness: Gately\x{2019}s after all a fucking drug addict, and a drug addict\x{2019}s second
         most meaningful relationship is always with his domestic entertainment unit, TV/VCR
         or HDTP. A drug addict\x{2019}s maybe the only human species whose own personal vision has
         a Vertical Hold, for Christ\x{2019}s sake, he thinks. And Gately, even in recovery, can still
         summon great verbatim chunks not only of drug-addicted adolescence\x{2019}s \x{2018}Seinfeld\x{2019} and
         \x{2018}Ren and Stimpy\x{2019} and \x{2018}Oo Is \x{2019}E When \x{2019}E\x{2019}s at \x{2019}Ome\x{2019} and \x{2018}Exposed Northerners\x{2019} but also
         the syndicated \x{2018}Bewitched\x{2019} and \x{2018}Hazel\x{2019} and ubiquitous \x{2018}M*A*S*H\x{2019} he grew to monstrous
         childhood size in front of, and especially the hometown ensemble-casted \x{2018}Cheers!,\x{2019}
         both the late-network version with the stacked brunette and the syndicated older ones
         with the titless blond, which Gately even after the switch over to InterLace and HDTP
         dissemination felt like he had a special personal relationship with \x{2018}Cheers!,\x{2019} not
         only because everybody on the show always had a cold foamer in hand, just like in
         real life, but because Gately\x{2019}s big childhood claim to recognition had been his eerie
         resemblance to the huge neckless simian-browed accountant Nom who more or less seemed
         to live at the bar, and was unkind but not cruel, and drank foamer after foamer without
         once hitting anybody\x{2019}s Mom or pitching over sideways and passing out in vomit somebody
         else had to clean up, and who\x{2019}d looked\x{2014}right down to the massive square head and Neanderthal
         brow and paddle-sized thumbs\x{2014}eerily like the child D. W. (\x{2018}Bim\x{2019}) Gately, hulking and
         neckless and shy, riding his broom handle, Sir Osis of Thuliver. And the wraith on
         the heart monitor looks pensively down at Gately from upside-down and asks does Gately
         remember the myriad thespian extras on for example his beloved \x{2018}Cheers!,\x{2019} not the
         center-stage Sam and Carla and Nom, but the nameless patrons always at tables, filling
         out the bar\x{2019}s crowd, concessions to realism, always relegated to back- and foreground;
         and always having utterly silent conversations: their faces would animate and mouths
         move realistically, but without sound; only the name-stars at the bar itself could
         audibilize. The wraith says these fractional actors, human scenery, could be seen
         (but not heard) in most pieces of filmed entertainment. And Gately remembers them,
         the extras in all public scenes, especially like bar and restaurant scenes, or rather
         remembers how he doesn\x{2019}t quite remember them, how it never struck his addled mind
         as in fact surreal that their mouths moved but nothing emerged, and what a miserable
         fucking bottom-rung job that must be for an actor, to be sort of human furniture,
         figurants the wraith says they\x{2019}re called, these surreally mute background presences whose presence
         really revealed that the camera, like any eye, has a perceptual corner, a triage of
         who\x{2019}s important enough to be seen and heard v. just seen. A term from ballet, originally,
         figurant, the wraith explains. The wraith pushes his glasses up in the vaguely snivelling way
         of a kid that\x{2019}s just got slapped around on the playground and says he personally spent
         the vast bulk of his own former animate life as pretty much a figurant, furniture
         at the periphery of the very eyes closest to him, it turned out, and that it\x{2019}s one
         heck of a crummy way to try to live. Gately, whose increasing self-pity leaves little
         room or patience for anybody else\x{2019}s self-pity, tries to lift his left hand and wiggle
         his pinkie to indicate the world\x{2019}s smallest viola playing the theme from The Sorrow and the Pity, but even moving his left arm makes him almost faint. And either the wraith is saying
         or Gately is realizing that you can\x{2019}t appreciate the dramatic pathos of a figurant
         until you realize how completely trapped and encaged he is in his mute peripheral status, because like say for example if one of \x{2018}Cheers!\x{2019}
         \x{2019}s bar\x{2019}s figurants suddenly decided he couldn\x{2019}t take it any more and stood up and
         started shouting and gesturing around wildly in a bid for attention and nonperipheral
         status on the show, Gately realizes, all that would happen is that one of the audibilizing
         \x{2018}name\x{2019} stars of the show would bolt over from stage-center and apply restraints or
         the Heineken Maneuver or CPR, figuring the silent gesturing figurant was choking on
         a beer-nut or something, and that then the whole rest of that episode of \x{2018}Cheers!\x{2019}
         would be about jokes about the name star\x{2019}s life-saving heroics, or else his fuck-up
         in applying the Heineken Maneuver to somebody who wasn\x{2019}t choking on a nut. No way
         for a figurant to win. No possible voice or focus for the encaged figurant. Gately
         speculates briefly about the suicide statistics for bottom-rung actors. The wraith
         disappears and then reappears in the chair by the bed\x{2019}s railing, leaning forward with
         its chin on its hands on the railing in what Gately\x{2019}s coming to regard as the classic
         tell-your-troubles-to-the-trauma-patient-that-can\x{2019}t-interrupt-or-get-away position.
         The wraith says that he himself, the wraith, when animate, had dabbled in filmed entertainments,
         as in making them, cartridges, for Gately\x{2019}s info to either believe or not, and but
         in the entertainments the wraith himself made, he says he goddamn bloody well made
         sure that either the whole entertainment was silent or else if it wasn\x{2019}t silent that
         you could bloody well hear every single performer\x{2019}s voice, no matter how far out on
         the cinematographic or narrative periphery they were; and that it wasn\x{2019}t just the
         self-conscious overlapping dialogue of a poseur like Schwulst or Altman, i.e. it wasn\x{2019}t
         just the crafted imitation of aural chaos: it was real life\x{2019}s real egalitarian babble
         of figurantless crowds, of the animate world\x{2019}s real agora, the babble 342 of crowds every member of which was the central and articulate protagonist of his
         own entertainment. It occurs to Gately he\x{2019}s never had any sort of dream where somebody
         says anything like vast bulk, much less agora, which Gately interprets as a kind of expensive sweater. Which was why, the wraith
         is continuing, the complete unfiguranted egalitarian aural realism was why party-line
         entertainment-critics always complained that the wraith\x{2019}s entertainments\x{2019} public-area
         scenes were always incredibly dull and self-conscious and irritating, that they could
         never hear the really meaningful central narrative conversations for all the unfiltered
         babble of the peripheral crowd, which they assumed the babble(/babel) was some self-conscious
         viewer-hostile heavy-art directorial pose, instead of radical realism. The wraith\x{2019}s
         grim smile almost disappears before it appears. Gately\x{2019}s slight tight smile back is
         the way you can always tell he\x{2019}s not really listening. He\x{2019}s remembering that he used
         to pretend to himself that the unviolent and sarcastic accountant Nom on \x{2018}Cheers!\x{2019}
         was Gately\x{2019}s own organic father, straining to hold young Bimmy on his lap and letting
         him draw finger-pictures in the condensation-rings on the bartop, and when he was
         pissed off at Gately\x{2019}s mother being sarcastic and witty instead of getting her down
         and administering horribly careful U.S.-Navy-brig-type beatings that hurt like hell
         but would never bruise or show. The can of foreign Coke has left a ring on his forehead
         that\x{2019}s colder than the feverish skin around it, and Gately tries to concentrate on
         the cold of the ring instead of the dead cold total ache on his whole right side\x{2014}DEXTRAL\x{2014}or the sober memory of his mother Mrs. Gately\x{2019}s ex-significant other, the little-eyed
         former M.P. in khaki skivvies hunched drunk over his notebook\x{2019}s record of his Heinekens
         for the day, his tongue in the corner of his mouth and his eyes scrunched as he tries
         to see a unitary enough notebook to write in, Gately\x{2019}s mother on the floor trying
         to crawl off toward the lockable bathroom quietly enough so the M.P. wouldn\x{2019}t notice
         her again.",

            "The wraith says Just to give Gately an idea, he, the wraith, in order to appear as
         visible and interface with him, Gately, he, the wraith, has been sitting, still as
         a root, in the chair by Gately\x{2019}s bedside for the wraith-equivalent of three weeks, which Gately can\x{2019}t even imagine. It occurs to Gately that none of the people that\x{2019}ve
         dropped by to tell him their troubles has bothered to say how many days he\x{2019}s even
         been in the Trauma Wing now, or what day it\x{2019}s going to be when the sun comes up, and
         so Gately has no idea how long he\x{2019}s gone now without an AA meeting. Gately wishes
         his sponsor Ferocious Francis G. would hobble by instead of Ennet Staff that want
         to talk about prosfeces and residents who come just to share remembered wreckage with
         somebody they don\x{2019}t even think can even hear them, sort of the way a little kid confides
         to a dog. He doesn\x{2019}t let himself even contemplate why no Finest or federally crew-cut
         guys have visited yet, if he\x{2019}s been in here a while, if they\x{2019}ve been all over the
         House like hamsters on wheat already, as Thrust had said. The seated shadow of somebody
         in a hat is still there out there in the hall, though if the whole interlude was a
         dream it isn\x{2019}t and has never been there, Gately realizes, squinting a little to try
         to make sure the shadow is the shadow of a hat and not a fire-extinguisher box on
         the hall wall or something. The wraith excuses himself and disappears but then reappears
         two slow blinks later, back in the same position. \x{2018}That was worth an Excuse Me?\x{2019} Gately
         thinks at the wraith dryly, almost laughing. The sheet of pain from the near-laugh
         send his eyes way up back up in his head. The chassis of the heart monitor doesn\x{2019}t
         look broad enough to support even a wraith\x{2019}s ass. The heart monitor\x{2019}s the silent kind.
         It\x{2019}s got the moving white line with big speed bumps moving across it for Gately\x{2019}s
         pulse, but it doesn\x{2019}t make the sterile beeping that old hospital-drama monitors did.
         Patients in hospital-dramas were frequently unconscious figurants, Gately reflects.
         The wraith says he\x{2019}d just paid a small quantumish call to the old spotless Brighton
         two-decker of one Ferocious Francis Gehaney, and from the way the old Crocodile\x{2019}s
         shaving and putting on a clean white T-shirt, the wraith says, he predicts F.F. will
         be visiting the Trauma Wing soon to offer Gately unconditional empathy and fellowship
         and acerbic Crocodilian counsel. Unless this was just Gately himself thinking this
         up to keep a stiff upper attitude, Gately thinks. The wraith pushes his glasses up
         sadly. You never think of a wraith looking sad or unsad, but this dream-wraith displays
         the whole affective range. Gately can hear the horns and raised voices and U-turn
         squeals way down below on Wash. that indicate it\x{2019}s <<around 0000h|1>>., the switching hour.
         He wonders what something as brief as a car-horn-honk sounds like to a figurant that
         has to sit still for three weeks to be seen. Wraith, not figurant, Gately meant, he
         corrects himself. He\x{2019}s lying here correcting his thoughts like he was talking. He
         wonders if his brain-voice talks fast enough for the wraith not to have to like tap
         its foot and look at its watch between words. Are they words if they\x{2019}re only in your
         head, though? The wraith blows its nose in a hankie that\x{2019}s visibly seen better epochs
         and says he, the wraith, when alive in the world of animate men, had seen his own
         personal youngest offspring, a son, the one most like him, the one most marvelous
         and frightening to him, becoming a figurant, toward the end. His end, not the son\x{2019}s
         end, the wraith clarifies. Gately wonders if it offends the wraith when he sometimes
         refers to it mentally as it. The wraith opens and examines the used hankie just like an alive person can never
         help but do and says No horror on earth or elsewhere could equal watching your own
         offspring open his mouth and have nothing come out. The wraith says it mars the memory
         of the end of his animate life, this son\x{2019}s retreat to the periphery of life\x{2019}s frame.
         The wraith confesses that he had, at one time, blamed the boy\x{2019}s mother for his silence.
         But what good does that kind of thing do, he said, making a blurred motion that might
         have been shrugging. Gately remembers the former Navy M.P. telling Gately\x{2019}s mother
         why it was her fault he lost his job at the chowder plant. \x{2018}Resentment Is The #1 Offender\x{2019}
         is another Boston AA clich\x{e9} Gately\x{2019}d started to believe. That blame\x{2019}s a shell-game.
         Not that he wouldn\x{2019}t mind a private couple of minutes alone in a doorless room with
         Randy Lenz, once he was up and capable again, though.",

            "Gately\x{2019}s also powerless over memories of the older-type lady that had been their neighbor
         when he and his mother shared bed and board with the M.P. A Mrs. Waite. There was
         no Mr. Waite. The smeared window of the little empty garage the M.P. kept his weights
         in was right next to the spiny neglected garden Mrs. Waite kept in the narrow strip
         between the two houses. Mrs. Waite\x{2019}s house had been shall we say indifferently maintained.
         Mrs. Waite\x{2019}s house had made the Gately house look like the Taj. There was something
         wrong about Mrs. Waite. None of the parents said what it was, but none of the kids
         were allowed to play in her yard or ring her bell on Halloween. Gately never got clear
         on what was supposed to be wrong about her, but the little poor neighborhood\x{2019}s psyche
         throbbed with something dire about Mrs. Waite. Older kids drove across her lawn and
         shouted shit that Gately never quite made out, at night. The littler kids thought
         they had it: they were pretty sure Mrs. Waite was a witch. Yes, she did look a little
         witchy, but who over like fifty didn\x{2019}t? But the big thing was she kept jars of stuff
         she\x{2019}d jarred herself in her little garage, brown-green viscous nameless vegetoid stuff
         in mayonnaise jars stacked on steel shelves and rusty-lidded and bearded with dust.
         The littler kids snuck in and broke some of the jars and stole one and ran away in
         mortal terror to break it elsewhere and then run again. They dared each other to ride
         their bikes in tiny diagonals across the edge of her lawn. They told each other stories
         of seeing Mrs. Waite in a pointy hat roasting missing kids whose pictures were on
         milk-cartons and pouring the juice into jars. Some of the bigger littler kids even
         tried that inevitable gag of putting a paper bag full of dog shit on her stoop and
         lighting it. It was somehow a further indictment of Mrs. Waite that she never complained.
         She rarely left her house. Mrs. Gately would never say what was wrong about Mrs. Waite
         but absolutely forbade Don to fuck with her in any way. Like Mrs. Gately was in any
         position to enforce any, like, forbiddings. Gately never fucked with Mrs. Waite\x{2019}s
         stored jars or rode across her lawn, and never much joined in on the witch-stories,
         which who needed witches to fear and despise when you had the good old M.P. right
         there at the kitchen table. But he was still scared of her. When he\x{2019}d once seen her
         gnarly-eyed face up against the smeared garage window <<one P.M.|5>> when he had left the M.P. to beating Mrs. Gately and gone out to lift weights he
         screamed and almost dropped the bench-press bar on his Adam\x{2019}s apple. But over the
         long haul of a low-stimulation North Shore childhood, he\x{2019}d gradually developed a slight
         relationship with Mrs. Waite. He\x{2019}d never all that much liked her; it wasn\x{2019}t like she
         was this lovable but misunderstood old lady; it\x{2019}s not like he ran to her dilapidated
         house to confide in her, or bond. But he went over once or twice, maybe, under circumstances
         he\x{2019}d forgot, and had sat in her kitchen, interfaced a little. She was lucid, Mrs.
         Waite, and apparently continent, and there was no pointy hat anywhere in sight, but
         her house smelled bad, and Mrs. Waite herself had swollen veiny ankles and little
         white bits of that dried paste at the corners of her mouth and about a million newspapers
         stacked and mildewing all over the kitchen, and the old lady basically radiated whatever
         mixture of unpleasantness and vulnerability it was that made you want to be cruel
         to people. Gately was never cruel to her, but it\x{2019}s not like he loved her or anything.
         When Gately went over there the couple times it was mostly when the M.P. was canning
         chowder and his mother had passed out in vomit she expected somebody else to clean
         up, and he probably wanted to act out his kid\x{2019}s anger by doing something Mrs. G.\x{2019}d
         pathetically tried to forbid. He didn\x{2019}t eat much of whatever Mrs. Waite offered. She
         never offered him viscous material from a jar. His memories of whatever they discussed
         are unspecific. She hung herself, eventually, Mrs. Waite\x{2014}as in eliminated her own
         map\x{2014}and because it was fall and cool she wasn\x{2019}t found for maybe weeks after. It wasn\x{2019}t
         Gately who found her. A meter-reader guy found her several weeks after Gately\x{2019}s eighth
         or ninth birthday. Gately\x{2019}s birthday was the same week as several other kids\x{2019}s in
         the neighborhood, by some chance. Usually Gately\x{2019}d have his party over with some of
         the other kids that were having their birthdays with a party. Hats and Twister, X-Men
         videos, cake on Chinette plates, etc. Mrs. Gately was together enough to come a couple
         times. In retrospect, the other kids\x{2019} parents let Gately have birthdays with them
         because they\x{2019}d felt sorry for him, he\x{2019}s involuntarily realized. But at some sober
         neighbors\x{2019} party, part of which was for his own eighth or ninth birthday, he remembers
         how Mrs. Waite had left her house and come rung the sober neighbor\x{2019}s bell and had
         brought a birthday cake. For the birthday. A neighborly gesture. Gately\x{2019}d spilled
         the beans on the annual mass party at a kitchen-table interface with her. The cake
         was uneven and slightly tilted to one side, but it was dark chocolate and decorated
         with four cursive names and had clearly been made with care. Mrs. Waite had spared
         Gately the humiliation of putting just his name on the cake as if the cake was especially
         for him. But it was. Mrs. Waite had saved up for a long time to afford to make the
         cake, Gately knew. He knew she smoked like a chimney and had given up cigarettes for
         weeks to save up for something; she wouldn\x{2019}t tell him what; she\x{2019}d tried to make her
         scary eyes twinkle when she wouldn\x{2019}t tell; but he\x{2019}d seen the mayonnaise jar full of
         quarters on a pile of papers and had wrestled with himself over promoting it, and
         won. But there were only like nine candles on the cake when the party\x{2019}s Mom brought
         it in, and a couple of the kids having birthdays were like twelve, was the private
         tip-off on who the cake was really for. The party\x{2019}s Mom had taken the cake at the
         door and said Thank You but had neglected to invite Mrs. Waite in. Gately was in a
         position during Twister in the garage to see Mrs. Waite walking back home across the
         street, slowly but very straightly and dignified and upright. A lot of the kids went
         to the garage door to look: Mrs. Waite had rarely been seen outside her house before,
         and never off her property. The sober Mom brought the cake in the garage and said
         it was a Touching Gesture from Mrs. Waite across the street; but she wouldn\x{2019}t let
         anybody eat the cake or even come close enough to it to blow out the nine candles.
         The candles didn\x{2019}t all match. The candles burned down far enough so that there was
         a smell of burnt frosting before they went out. The cake sat tilted by itself in a
         corner of the clean garage. Gately didn\x{2019}t defy the sober Mom or any of the kids and
         eat a piece of the cake; he didn\x{2019}t even go near it. He didn\x{2019}t join in the delicious
         whispery arguments about what kind of medical waste or roasted-kid renderings were
         in the cake, but he didn\x{2019}t stand up and argue with the other kids about the fact of
         the poisoning, either. Before the party climaxed and the other kids that had got presents
         opened their presents, the sober Mom had taken the cake into the kitchen when she
         thought nobody was watching and threw it out in the wastebasket. Gately remembers
         the cake must have landed upside-down, because the unfrosted side was facing up in
         the wastebasket when he snuck in and had a look at the cake. Mrs. Waite had disappeared
         back inside her house way before the Mom threw the cake away. There\x{2019}s no way she could
         have seen the Mom take the uneaten cake back inside the house. A couple days later
         Gately had promoted a couple packs of Benson & Hedges 100s from a Store 24 and put
         them in Mrs. Waite\x{2019}s mailbox, where junk mail and utility bills were already piling
         up. He sometimes rang the bell but never saw her. Her bell had been a buzzer instead
         of a bell, he remembers. She got found by a frustrated meter-reader some indefinite
         number of weeks after that. The circumstances of her death and discovery became more
         dark myth for the littler kids. Gately wasn\x{2019}t so into self-torture as to think the
         cake getting not eaten and getting thrown out was in any way connected with Mrs. Waite
         hanging herself. Everybody had their own private troubles, Mrs. Gately had explained
         to him, and even at that age he could see her point. It\x{2019}s not like he\x{2019}d like mourned
         Mrs. Waite, or missed her, or even thought about her even once for many years after
         that.",

            "Kenkle and Brandt were ageless in the special desiccated way janitors are ageless,
         somewhere between thirty-five and sixty. They were inseparable and essentially unemployable.
         Boredom had years ago led us to Lateral Alice Moore\x{2019}s minimally crypto-protected employee
         files, and Brandt\x{2019}s file had listed his S.-B. I.Q. as Submoronic-to-Moronic. He was
         bald and somehow at once overweight and wiry. Both right and left temples carried
         red jagged surgical scars of unknown origin. His affective range consisted of different
         intensities of grin. He lived with Kenkle in an attic apartment in Roxbury Crossing
         overlooking Madison Park High School\x{2019}s locked and cordoned playground, famed site
         of unsolved ritual mutilations in the Year of the Perdue Wonderchicken. His major
         attraction for Kenkle seemed to consist in the fact that he neither walked away nor
         interrupted when Kenkle was speaking. Even in the stairwell I could hear Kenkle discoursing
         on their Thanksgiving plans and directing Brandt\x{2019}s mop-work. Kenkle was technically
         black, as in Negroid, though he was more the burnt-sienna color of a spoiled pumpkin.
         But his hair was a black person\x{2019}s hair, and he wore it in thick dreadlocks that looked
         like a crown of wet cigars. An academic diamond in the very rough Roxbury Crossing,
         he\x{2019}d received his doctorate in low-temperature physics from U.Mass. at <<twenty-one|9:0>>
         and taken a prestigious sinecure at the U.S. Office of Naval Research, then at twenty-three
         had been court-martialed out of the O.N.R. for offenses that changed each time you
         asked him. Some event between twenty-one and twenty-three seemed to have broken him
         at several strategic points, and he\x{2019}d retreated from Bethesda back to the front stoop
         of his old Roxbury Crossing apartment building, where he read Ba\x{2019}hai texts whose jackets
         he covered with intricately folded newspaper, and spat spectacular parabolas of quivering
         phlegm into New Dudley Street. He was dark-freckled and carbuncular and afflicted
         with excess phlegm. He was an incredible spitter, and alleged his missing incisors
         had been removed \x{2018}for facilitating the expec-toratory process.\x{2019} We all suspected he
         was either hypomanic or \x{2019}drine-addicted or both. His expression was very serious at
         all times. He discoursed nonstop to poor Brandt, using spit as a sort of conjunction
         between clauses. He spoke loudly because they both wore earplugs of expanding foam\x{2014}people\x{2019}s
         nightmare-cries gave them the fantods. Their custodial technique consisted of Kenkle
         spitting with pinpoint accuracy onto whatever surface Brandt was to clean next and
         Brandt trotting like a fine hunting dog from glob to glob, listening and grinning,
         laughing when appropriate. They were moving away from me down the hall toward the
         second floor\x{2019}s east window, Brandt making great shining arcs with his doll\x{2019}s-head

         for the mid-A.M., with (according to rumor) Pemulis himself as game-master, was certain to be snowed

         came down to a choice between continuing to play competitive tennis and continuing
         to be able to get high, it would be a nearly impossible choice to make. The distant
         way in which this fact appalled me itself appalled me. The founder of the sub-14\x{2019}s\x{2019}
         Tunnel Club had been Heath Pearson as a very little boy. The rumor that Pemulis himself
         would don the beanie for the next Eschaton came from Kent Blott; Pemulis had been
         avoiding me ever since I returned from Natick on Tuesday\x{2014}as if he sensed something.
         The woman behind the register at the Shell station last night had recoiled as I approached
         to present my card before pumping, as if she too had seen something in my expression
         I hadn\x{2019}t known was there. The North American Collegiate Dictionary claimed that any \x{2018}very heavy\x{2019} snowstorm with \x{2018}high winds\x{2019} qualified as a blizzard.
         Himself, for two years before his death, had had this delusion of silence when I spoke:
         I believed I was speaking and he believed I was not speaking. Mario averred that Himself
         had never accused him of not speaking. I tried to recall whether I had ever brought
         the subject up with the Moms. The Moms was at pains to be completely approachable
         on all subjects except Himself and what had been going on between her and Himself
         as Himself withdrew more and more. She never forbade questions about it; she just
         got so pained and blurry-faced that you felt cruel asking her anything. I considered
         whether Pemulis\x{2019}s cessation of the math-tutorials was perhaps an oblique affirmation,
         a kind of You Are Ready. Pemulis often communicated in a kind of esoteric code. It
         was true that I had kept mostly to myself in the room since Tuesday. The condensed
         O.E.D., in a rare bit of florid imprecision, defined blizzard as \x{2018}A furious blast of frost-wind and blinding snow in which man and beast frequently
         perish,\x{2019} claiming the word was either a neologism or a corruption of the French blesser, coined in English by a reporter for Iowa\x{2019}s Northern Vindicator in B.S. 1864. Orin alleged in Y.T.M.P. that when he took the Moms\x{2019}s car in the morning
         he sometimes observed the smeared prints of nude human feet on the inside of the wind-shield.
         V.R.5\x{2019}s heating duct\x{2019}s grille gave off a sterile hiss. All up and down the hall were
         sounds of the Academy coming to life, making competitive ablutions, venting anxiety
         and complaints at the possible blizzard outside\x{2014}wanting to play. There was heavy foot-traffic
         in the third-floor hall above me. Orin was going through a period where he was attracted
         only to young mothers of small children. A hunched way: she hunches; you hunch. John
         Wayne had had a violent allergic reaction to a decongestant and had commandeered the
         WETA microphone and publicly embarrassed himself on Troeltsch\x{2019}s Tuesday broadcast,
         apparently, and had been taken to St. Elizabeth\x{2019}s overnight for observation, but had
         recovered quickly enough to come home and then finish ahead even of Stice in Wednesday\x{2019}s
         conditioning run. I missed the entire thing and was filled in by Mario on my return
         from Natick\x{2014}Wayne had apparently said unkind things about various E.T.A. staff and
         administration, none of which anyone who knew Wayne and all he stood for had taken
         seriously. Relief that he was OK had dominated everyone\x{2019}s accounts of the whole incident;

         specificity you go to a hard-ass: Sitney and Schneewind\x{2019}s Dictionary of Environmental Sciences required 12 cm./hour of continuous snowfall, minimum winds of 60 kph., and visibility
         of less than 500 meters; and only if these conditions obtained for more than three
         hours was it a blizzard; less than three hours was \x{2018}C-IV Squall.\x{2019} The dedication and

            "It doesn\x{2019}t even register on Gately that it\x{2019}s spitting a little goopy sleet outside
         until he\x{2019}s made himself avert his head from the window and R.N. The ceiling\x{2019}s throbbing
         a little, like a dog when it\x{2019}s hot. The R.N. had told him, from behind, her name was
         Cathy or Kathy, but Gately wants to think of her as just the R.N. He can smell himself,
         a smell like sandwich-meat left in the sun, and feel greasy sweat purling all over
         his scalp, and his unshaved chin against his throat, and the tube taped into his mouth
         is tacky with the scum of sleep. The thin pillow is hot and he has no way to flip
         it over to the cool side of the pillow. It\x{2019}s like his shoulder\x{2019}s grown its own testicles
         and every time his heart beats some very small guy kicked him in them, the testicles.
         The M.D. sees Gately\x{2019}s open eyes and tells the nurse the gunshot patient is semiconscious
         again and is he Q\x{2019}d for any kind of P.M. med. The sleetfall is slight; it sounds like somebody\x{2019}s throwing little fistfuls
         of sand at the window from real far away. The deadly R.N., helping the M.D. clamp
         some kind of weird steel back-braceish thing with what looks like a metal halo they\x{2019}d
         put together from parts out of the big case, clamping the thing to the head of the
         bed and to little steel plates under the bed\x{2019}s heart monitor\x{2014}it looks sort of like
         the upper part of an electric chair, he thinks\x{2014}the R.N. looks down in mid-stretch
         and says Hi Mr. Gately and says Mr. Gately is allergic and doesn\x{2019}t get any meds except
         antipyretics and Toradol in a drip Dr. Pressburger do you Mr. Gately you poor brave
         allergic thing. Her voice is like you can just imagine what she\x{2019}d sound like getting
         X\x{2019}d and really liking it. Gately\x{2019}s repelled at himself for having taken a dump in
         front of this kind of R.N. The M.D.\x{2019}s name had sounded just like \x{2018}Pressburger\x{2019} or
         \x{2018}Prissburger,\x{2019} and Gately\x{2019}s now sure the poor yutz\x{2019}d taken daily ass-kickings from
         sinister future drug addicts, as a kid. The M.D.\x{2019}s perspiring in the ambient sexuality
         of the R.N. He says (the M.D. does) So what\x{2019}s he intubated for if he\x{2019}s conscious and
         self-ventilating and on a drip. This is while the M.D.\x{2019}s trying to screw the metal
         halo itself to the top of the back-braceish thing with bolt-head screws, one knee
         up on the bed and stretching so part of the red soft upper part of his ass is showing
         over his belt, not being able to get the thing screwed on, shaking the metal halo
         like it\x{2019}s its stubborn fault, and even lying there Gately can tell the guy\x{2019}s turning
         the bolt-head screws the wrong way. The R.N. comes over and puts a cool soft hand
         on Gately\x{2019}s forehead in a way that makes the forehead want to die with shame. What
         Gately can get from what she says to Dr. Pressburger is that there\x{2019}d been concern
         that Gately might have got a fragment of whatever projectile he got invaded with in,
         through, or near his lower-something Trachea, since there\x{2019}d been trauma to his Something-with-six-syllables-that-started-with-Sterno, she said the radiology results were indefinite but suspicious, and somebody called
         Pendleton had wanted a 16 mm. siphuncular nebulizer dispensing 4 ml. of 20% Mucomyst
         373 q. 2 h. on the off-chance of hemorrhage or mucoidal flux, like just in case. The
         parts of this Gately can follow he doesn\x{2019}t care for one bit. He doesn\x{2019}t want to know
         his body even fucking has something with six syllables in it. The horrifying R.N. wipes Gately\x{2019}s face off as
         best she can with her hand and says she\x{2019}ll try to fit him in for a sponge bath before
         she goes off-shift at <<1600h|1>>., at which Gately goes rigid with dread. The R.N.\x{2019}s hand
         smells of Kiss My Face\x{2013}brand Organic Hand and Body Lotion, which Pat Montesian also
         uses. She tells the poor M.D. to let her have a try at the cranial brace, those things
         are always a bear to screw in. Her shoes are those subaudible nurses\x{2019} shoes that make
         no sound, so it seems like she glides away from Gately\x{2019}s bed instead of walks away.
         Her legs aren\x{2019}t visible until she gets a certain ways away. The M.D.\x{2019}s own shoes have
         a wet squeak to the left one. The M.D. looks like he hasn\x{2019}t slept well in about a
         year. There\x{2019}s a faint vibe of prescription \x{2019}drines about the guy, on Gately\x{2019}s view.
         He paces squeakily at the foot of the bed watching the R.N. turn the screws the right
         way and pushes his owlish glasses up and says that Clifford Pendleton, scratch golfer
         or no, is a post-traumatic maroon, that nebulized Mucomyst is for (and here his voice
         makes it clear he\x{2019}s reciting from memory, like to show off) abnormal, viscid, or inspissated
         post-traumatic mucus, not potential hemorrhaging or edema, and that 16 mm. siphuncular
         intubation itself had been specifically discreditated as an intratracheal-edema prophylaxis
         in the second-to-latest issue of Morbid Trauma Quarterly as so diametrically invasive that it was more apt to exacerbate than to alleviate
         hemoptysis, according to somebody he calls \x{2018}Laird\x{2019} or \x{2018}Layered.\x{2019} Gately\x{2019}s listening
         in with the uncomprehending close attention of like a child whose parents are discussing
         something adultly complex about child-care in its presence. The condescension with
         which Prissburger inserts that hemoptysis means something called \x{2018}pertussive hemorrhage,\x{2019} like Kathy the R.N. wasn\x{2019}t enough
         of a pro not to have to insert little technical explanations for, makes Gately sad
         for the guy\x{2014}it\x{2019}s obvious the guy pathetically thinks this kind of limp condescending
         shit will impress her. Gately\x{2019}s got to admit he would have tried to impress her, too,
         though, if she hadn\x{2019}t met him by holding a kidney-shaped pan under his working anus.
         The R.N.\x{2019}s finishing packing up the parts of the brace thing the M.D. couldn\x{2019}t seem
         to attach, meanwhile. She was saying the M.D. seemed awful well-up on methodology
         for something called a 2R, as they left, and Gately could tell the M.D. couldn\x{2019}t tell
         she was being a little sarcastic. The M.D. was struggling to try to carry the thing\x{2019}s
         case, which Gately judges weighs at most 30 kg. It occurs to him head-on for the first
         time that the real reason Stavros L. hired shelter-cleaning guys out of halfway houses
         was that he could get away with paying them like bupkis, and that he (Don G.) must
         surely on some level have known this all along but been in some kind of Denial about
         confronting it head-on that he was getting fucked over by Stavros the shoe-freak,
         and that the word embrasure had been surely another invasive-wraith ghostword, and then now also that nobody
         seems to exactly be falling all over themself to bring the paper and pen it had sure
         seemed like Joelle van D. had understood Gately\x{2019}s mimed request for, and that thus
         maybe Joelle\x{2019}s visit and show-and-tell with the snapshots had been just as much a
         febrile hallucination as the figuranted wraith, and that it has stopped spitting sleet
         but the clouds out there still look like they mean serious business out there over
         Brighton-Allston, and that if Joelle v.D.\x{2019}s intimate visit with the photo album was
         a hallucination that at least meant it was also a hallucination she was wearing fucking
         college-kid Ken Erdedy\x{2019}s sweatpants, and that the low-angled sadness of the cloudy
         P.M. light meant it had to be pretty <<near 1600h|1>>. EST so that maybe There By The Grace
         he could avoid maybe getting an uncontrolled woodie getting sponged naked by the horrifyingly
         attractive K/Cathy and but still could get sponged by her linebacker of a replacement,
         because the sour meaty smell of himself was grim, only maybe miss the woodie-hazard
         and get sponged by the big hairy-moled 1600\x{2013}2400h. nurse in support-hose to who Gately\x{2019}s
         anus was a stranger. Plus that <<1600h|1>>. EST was Spontaneous-Dissemination time for Mr.
         Bouncety-Bounce, the mentally ill kiddy-show host Gately\x{2019}s always loved and used to
         try his best with Kite and poor old Fackelmann to be home and largely alert for, and
         that nobody\x{2019}s once offered to click on the HD viewer that hangs next to a myopic fake-Turner
         fog-and-boat print on the wall opposite Gately\x{2019}s and the former kid\x{2019}s beds, and that
         he had no remote with which to either activate the TP at <<1600|18:0>> or ask somebody else
         to activate it. That without some kind of notebook and pencil he couldn\x{2019}t communicate
         even the basicest question or like concept to anybody\x{2014}it was like he was a vegetated
         hemorrhagic-stroke-victim. Without a pencil and notebook he couldn\x{2019}t even seem to
         get across a request for a notebook and pencil; it was like he was trapped inside
         his huge chattering head. Unless, his head then points out, Joelle van Dyne\x{2019}s visit
         had been real and her understanding of the pen-and-notebook gesture had been real,
         and but somebody out there in the hallway with a hat or at the Hospital President\x{2019}s
         office or at the nurses\x{2019} station with his innerdicted M.-Hanley-brownies had also
         innerdicted the request for writing supplies, at the Finest\x{2019}s request, so he couldn\x{2019}t
         get his story straight with anybody before they came for him, that it was like a pre-interrogation
         softening-up thing, they were leaving him trapped in himself, a figurant, mute and
         unmoving and blank like the House\x{2019}s catatonic lady slumped moist and pale in her chair
         or the Advanced Basics Group\x{2019}s adopted girl\x{2019}s vegetable-kingdom sister, or the whole
         catatonic gang over at E.M.P.H.H.\x{2019}s #5 Shed, silent and dead-faced even when touching
         a tree or propped up amid exploding front-lawn firecrackers. Or the wraith\x{2019}s nonexistent
         kid. It\x{2019}s got to be <<past 1600h|1>>., light-wise, unless it\x{2019}s the lowering clouds. There\x{2019}s
         roughly 0% or less visibility now outside the sleet-crusted window. The room\x{2019}s windowlight
         is darkening to that Kaopectate shade that has always marked the just-pre-sunset time
         of day that Gately (like most drug addicts) has always most dreaded, and had always
         either lowered his helmet and charged extra-murderous at somebody to block it out
         (the late-day dread) or else dropped QuoVadis or oral narcotics or turned on Mr. Bouncety-Bounce
         extra loud or busied himself in his silly chef\x{2019}s hat in the Ennet House kitchen or
         made sure he was at a Meeting sitting way up close in nose-pore range, to block it
         out (the late-day dread), the gray-light late-afternoon dread, always worse in winter,
         the dread, in winter\x{2019}s watered-down light\x{2014}just like the secret dread he\x{2019}s always felt
         whenever everybody happened to ever leave the room and left him alone in a room, a

         their arms, arms and noses red from scratching, still at it, the ingestion, on a hell
         of a tear, cooking up and getting off and eating M&M\x{2019}s when they could find their
         mouths with their hands, moving like men deep under water, heads wobbling on strengthless
         necks, the empty room\x{2019}s ceiling sky-blue and bulging and under it hanging on the wall
         overhead to their right the apartment\x{2019}s upscale TP\x{2019}s viewer on a recursive slo-mo
         loop of some creepy thing Fackelmann liked that was just serial shots of flames from
         brass lighters, kitchen-matches, pilot lights, birthday candles, votive candles, pillar
         candles, birch shavings, Bunsen burners, etc., that Fackelmann had got from Kite,
         who just before dawn had come out dressed and declined to get high with them and coughed
         nervously and announced he had to leave for a few days or more for a \x{2018}totally key\x{2019}
         and unmissable software trade-show in a different area code, not knowing Gately now
         knew he knew Fackelmann already to be dead, w/ Kite then trying to leave discreetly
         with every piece of hardware he owned in his arms, including the nonportable D.E.C.,
         trailing cables. Then a bit later, as the A.M. light intensified yellowly and made both Gately and Fackelmann curse the fact that
         the curtains had been stripped and pawned, as they continued to hunch and cook and
         shoot, at maybe <<0830h|1>>. Pamela Hoffman-Jeep was up and vomiting briskly and applying
         mousse against the workaday day, calling Gately Honey and her Night Errand and asking

         A.M. routine in their relationship\x{2014}applying blush and drinking her standard anti-hangover
         breakfast 377 and watching Gately and Fackelmann\x{2019}s chins fall and rise at slightly different underwater
         rates. The smell of her perfume and high-retsin mints hung in the bare room long after
         she\x{2019}d bid them both Ciao Bello. As the A.M. sun got higher and intolerable, instead of taking action and nailing a blanket or
         something over the window they opted instead to obliterate the reality of the eye-scalding
         light and began truly bingeing on Blues, flirting with an O. D. They scaled Fackelmann\x{2019}s
         Mt. Dilaudid at a terrible clip. Fackelmann was by nature a binger. Gately was typically
         more like a maintenance user. He rarely went on a classic-type binge, which meant
         plunking down in one place with an enormous stash and getting loaded over and over
         again for long periods without moving. But when he did start a binge he might as well
         have been strapped to the snout of a missile for all the control he had over length
         or momentum. Fackelmann was having at the mountain of 10-mg. Blues like there was
         no tomorrow. Every time Gately even started to bring up the issue of how Faxter had
         come by such a huge blue haul of the Substance\x{2014}trying maybe to invite Fackelmann to
         confront the reality of his trouble by describing it, like\x{2014}Fackelmann would cut him

            "The consensus among E.T.A.s is that Head Trainer Barry Loach resembles a wingless
         fly\x{2014}blunt and scuttly, etc. One E.T.A. tradition consists of Big Buddies recounting
         to new or very young Little Buddies the saga of Loach and how he ended up as an elite
         Head Trainer even though he doesn\x{2019}t have an official degree in Training or whatever
         from Boston College, which is where he\x{2019}d gone to school. In outline form, the saga
         goes that Loach grew up as the youngest child of an enormous Catholic family, the
         parents of which were staunch Catholics of the old school of extremely staunch Catholicism,
         and that Mrs. Loach (as in the mom)\x{2019}s life\x{2019}s most fervent wish was that one of her
         countless children would enter the R.C. clergy, but that the eldest Loach boy had
         done a two-year U.S.N. bit and had gotten de-mapped early on in the Brazilian O.N.A.N./U.N.
         joint action of Y.T.M.P.; and that within weeks of the wake the next oldest Loach
         boy had died of ciquatoxic food-poisoning eating tainted blackfin grouper; and the
         next oldest Loach, Therese, through a series of adolescent misadventures had ended
         up in Atlantic City NJ as one of the women in sequined leotards and high heels who
         carries a large posterboard card with the Round # on it around the ring between rounds
         of professional fights, so that hopes for Therese becoming a Carmelite dimmed considerably;
         and on down the line, one Loach falling helplessly in love and marrying right out
         of high school, another burning only to play the cymbals with a first-rate philharmonic
         (now crashing away with the Houston P.O.). And so on, until there was just one other
         Loach child and then Barry Loach, who was the youngest and also totally under Mrs.
         L.\x{2019}s thumb, emotionally; and that young Barry had breathed a huge sigh of relief when
         his older brother\x{2014}always a pious and contemplative and big-hearted kid, brimming over
         with abstract love and an innate faith in the indwelling goodness of all men\x{2019}s souls\x{2014}began
         to show evidence of a true spiritual calling to a life of service in the R.C. clergy,
         and ultimately entered Jesuit seminary, removing an enormous weight from his younger
         brother\x{2019}s psyche because young Barry\x{2014}ever since he first slapped a Band-Aid on an
         X-Men figure\x{2014}felt his true calling was not to the priesthood but to the liniment-and-adhesive
         ministry of professional athletic training. Who, finally, can say the whys and whences
         of each man\x{2019}s true vocation? And then so Barry was a Training major or whatever at
         B.C., and by all accounts proceeding satisfactorily toward a degree, when his older
         brother, quite far along toward getting ordained or frocked or whatever as a licensed
         Jesuit, suffered at age twenty-five a sudden and dire spiritual decline in which his
         basic faith in the innate indwelling goodness of men like spontaneously combusted
         and disappeared\x{2014}and for no apparent or dramatic reason; it just seemed as if the brother
         had suddenly contracted a black misanthropic spiritual outlook the way some twenty-five-year-old
         men contract Sanger-Brown\x{2019}s ataxia or M.S., a kind of degenerative Lou Gehrig\x{2019}s Disease
         of the spirit\x{2014}and his interest in serving man and God-in-man and nurturing the indwelling
         Christ in people through Jesuitical pursuits underwent an understandable nosedive,
         and he began to do nothing but sit in his dormitory room at St. John\x{2019}s Seminary\x{2014}right
         near Enfield Tennis Academy, coincidentally, on Foster Street in Brighton off Comm.
         Ave., right by the Archdiocese H.Q. or whatever\x{2014}sitting there trying to pitch playing-cards
         into a wastebasket in the middle of the floor, not going to classes or <<vespers|13>> or
         reading his Hours, and talking frankly about giving up the vocation altogether, which
         all had Mrs. Loach just about prostrate with disappointment, and had young Barry suddenly
         re-weighted with dread and anxiety, because if his brother bailed out of the clergy
         it would be nearly irresistibly incumbent on Barry, the very last Loach, to give up
         his true vocation of splints and flexion and enter seminary himself, to keep his staunch
         and beloved Mom from dying of disappointment. And so a series of personal interviews
         with the spiritually necrotic brother took place, Barry having to station himself
         on the other side of the playing-cards\x{2019} wastebasket so as even to get the older brother\x{2019}s
         attention, trying to talk the brother down from the misanthropic spiritual ledge he
         was on. The spiritually ill brother was fairly cynical about Barry Loach\x{2019}s reasons
         for trying to talk him down, seeing as how both men knew that Barry\x{2019}s own career-dreams
         were on the line here as well; though the brother smiled sardonically and said he\x{2019}d
         come to expect little better than self-interested #1-looking-out from human beings
         anyway, since his practicum work out among the human flocks in some of Boston\x{2019}s nastier
         downtown venues\x{2014}the impossibility of conditions-changing, the ingratitude of the low-life
         homeless addicted and mentally ill flocks he served, and the utter lack of compassion
         and basic help from the citizenry at large in all Jesuitical endeavors\x{2014}had killed
         whatever spark of inspired faith he\x{2019}d had in the higher possibilities and perfectibility
         of man; so he opined what should he expect but that his own little brother, no less
         than the coldest commuter passing the outstretched hands of the homeless and needy
         at Park Street Station, should be all-too-humanly concerned with nothing but the care
         and feeding of Numero Uno. Since a basic absence of empathy and compassion and taking-the-risk-to-reach-out
         seemed to him now an ineluctable part of the human character. Barry Loach was understandably
         way out his depth on the theological turf of like Apologia and the redeemability of
         man\x{2014}though he was able to relieve a slight hitch in the brother\x{2019}s toss that was stressing
         his card-throwing arm\x{2019}s flexor carpi ulnaris muscle and so to up the brother\x{2019}s card-in-wastebasket
         percentage significantly\x{2014}but he was not only desperate to preserve his mother\x{2019}s dream
         and his own indirectly athletic ambitions at the same time, he was actually rather
         a spiritually upbeat guy who just didn\x{2019}t buy the brother\x{2019}s sudden despair at the apparent
         absence of compassion and warmth in God\x{2019}s supposed self-mimetic and divine creation,
         and he managed to engage the brother in some rather heated and high-level debates
         on spirituality and the soul\x{2019}s potential, not that much unlike Alyosha and Ivan\x{2019}s
         conversations in the good old Brothers K., though probably not nearly as erudite and literary, and nothing from the older brother

         both OTC and prescription expectorants and pertussives and analgesics and Vitamin-C
         megaspansules and one bottle of Benadryl and one of Seldane, 22 only the Seldane bottle actually contains several Tenuate 75-mg. capsules Troeltsch
         has incrementally promoted from Pemulis\x{2019}s part of the room and has, rather ingeniously
         he thinks, stashed in bold plain sight in a bedside pill bottle where the Peemster
         would never think to check. Troeltsch is the sort that can feel his own forehead and
         detect fever. It\x{2019}s definitely a rhinovirus, the sudden severe kind. He speculated
         on if yesterday when Graham Rader pretended to sneeze on J. Troeltsch\x{2019}s lunch-tray
         at the milk-dispenser at lunch if Rader might have really sneezed and only pretended
         to pretend, transferring virulent rhinoviri to Troeltsch\x{2019}s delicate mucosa. He feverishly
         mentally calls down various cosmic retributions on Rader. Neither of Troeltsch\x{2019}s roommates
         is here. Ted Schacht is getting the knee\x{2019}s first of several whirlpools for the day.
         Pemulis has geared up and left for <<0745|18:0>> drills. Troeltsch offered Pemulis rights to
         his breakfast to fill up his vaporizer for him and call the first-shift nurse for
         \x{2018}yet more\x{2019} Seldane nuclear-grade antihistamine and a dextromethorphan nebulizer and
         a written excuse from A.M. drills. He lies there sweating freely, watching digitally recorded professional tennis,
         too worried about his throat to feel loquacious enough to call the action. Seldane
         is not supposed to make you drowsy but he feels weak and unpleasantly drowsy. He can
         barely make a fist. He\x{2019}s sweaty. Nausea/vomiting like not an impossibility by any
         means. He cannot believe how fast it came on, the illness. The vaporizer seethes and
         burps, and all four of the room\x{2019}s windows weep against the outside cold. There are
         the sad tiny distant-champagne-cork sounds of scores of balls being hit down at the
         East Courts. Troeltsch drifts at a level just above sleep. Enormous ATHSCME displacement
         fans far up north at the wall and border\x{2019}s distant roar and the outdoor voices and
         pock of cold balls create a kind of sound-carpet below the digestive sounds of the vaporizer
         and the squeak of Troeltsch\x{2019}s bedsprings as he thrashes and twitches in a moist half-sleep.
         He has heavy German eyebrows and big-knuckled hands. It\x{2019}s one of those unpleasant
         opioid feverish half-sleep states, more a fugue-state than a sleep-state, less a floating
         than like being cast adrift on rough seas, tossed mightily in and out of this half-sleep
         where your mind\x{2019}s still working and you can ask yourself whether you\x{2019}re asleep even
         as you dream. And any dreams you do have seem ragged at the edges, gnawed on, incomplete.",

            "The doctor who poked his fine head just inside her hot room\x{2019}s open door and knocked
         maybe a little too gently on the metal jamb found Kate Gompert lying on her side on
         the slim hard bed in blue jeans and a sleeveless blouse with her knees drawn up to
         her abdomen and her fingers laced around her knees. Something almost too overt about
         the pathos of the posture: this exact position was illustrated in some melancholic
         Watteau-era print on the frontispiece to Yevtuschenko\x{2019}s Field Guide to Clinical States. Kate Gompert wore dark-blue boating sneakers without socks or laces. Half her face
         obscured by the either green or yellow case on the plastic pillow, her hair so long-unwashed
         it had separated into discrete shiny strands, and black bangs lay like a cell\x{2019}s glossy
         bars across the visible half of the forehead. The psych ward smelled faintly of disinfectant
         and the Community Lounge\x{2019}s cigarette smoke, the sour odor of medical waste awaiting
         collection with also that perpetual slight ammoniac tang of urine, and there was the
         double bing of the elevator and the always faraway sound of the intercom paging some
         M.D., and some high-volume cursing from a manic in the pink Quiet Room at the other
         end of the psych-ward hall from the Community Lounge. Kate Gompert\x{2019}s room also smelled
         of singed dust from the heat-vent, also of the over-sweet perfume worn by the young
         mental health staffer who sat in a chair at the foot of the girl\x{2019}s bed, chewing blue
         gum and viewing a soundless ROM cartridge on a ward-issue laptop. Kate Gompert was
         on Specials, which meant Suicide-Watch, which meant that the girl had at some point
         betrayed both Ideation and Intent, which meant she had to be watched right up close
         by a staffer twenty-four hours a day until the supervising M.D. called off the Specials.
         Staffers rotated Specials-duty every hour, ostensibly so that whoever was on duty
         was always fresh and keenly observant, but really because simply sitting there at
         the foot of a bed looking at somebody who was in so much psychic pain she wanted to
         commit suicide was incredibly depressing and boring and unpleasant, so they spread
         the odious duty out as thin as they possibly could, the staffers. They were not technically
         supposed to read, do paperwork, view CD-ROMs, do personal grooming, or in any way
         divert their attention from the patient on Specials, on-duty. The patient Ms. Gompert
         seemed both to be fighting for breath and to be breathing rapidly enough to induce
         hypocapnia; the doctor could not be expected not also to notice that she had fairly
         large breasts that rose and fell rapidly inside the circle of arms with which she
         hugged her knees. The girl\x{2019}s eyes, which were dull, had registered his appearance
         in the doorway, but they didn\x{2019}t seem to track as he came toward the bed. The staffer
         was also employing an emery board. The doctor told the staffer that he was going to
         need a few moments alone with Ms. Gompert. It is a sort of requirement that a doctor
         whenever possible be reading or at least looking down at something on his clipboard
         when addressing a subordinate, so the doctor was looking studiously at the patient\x{2019}s

         detoxification unit sits in a blue plastic straight-back chair in front of his and
         Ewell\x{2019}s room\x{2019}s window\x{2019}s air conditioner, watching it. The air conditioner hums and
         gushes, and the man gazes with rapt intensity into its screen of horizontal vents.
         The air conditioner\x{2019}s cord is thick and white and leads into a three-prong outlet
         with black heel-marks on the wall all around it. The November room is around 12\x{b0} C.
         The man turns the air conditioner\x{2019}s dial from setting #4 to setting #5. The curtains
         above it shake and billow around the window. The man\x{2019}s face falls into and out of
         amused expressions as he watches the air conditioner. He sits in the blue chair with
         a trembling Styrofoam cup of coffee and a paper plate of brownies into which he taps
         ashes from the cigarettes whose smoke the air conditioner blows straight back over
         his head. The cigarette smoke is starting to pile up against the wall behind him,
         and to ooze and run chilled down the wall and form a sort of cloud-bank near the floor.
         The man\x{2019}s raptly amused profile appears in the mirror on the wall beside the dresser
         the two in-patients share. The man, like Tiny Ewell, has the rouged-corpse look that
         attends detox from late-stage alcoholism. The man is in addition a burnt-yellow beneath
         his flush, from chronic hepatitis. The mirror he appears in is treated with shatterproof
         Lucite polymers. The man leans carefully forward with the plate of brownies in his
         lap and changes the setting on the air conditioner from <<5 to 3|10a:0>> and then to 7, then
         8, scanning the screen of gushing vents. He finally turns the selector\x{2019}s dial all
         the way around to 9. The air conditioner roars and blows his long hair straight back,
         and his beard blows back over his shoulder, ashes fly and swirl around from his plate
         of brownies, plus crumbs, and his rodney\x{2019}s tip glows cherry and gives sparks. He is
         deeply engaged by whatever he sees on 9. He gives Tiny Ewell the screaming meemies,
         Ewell has complained. He wears pisscatchers, a striped cotton St. Mel\x{2019}s robe, and
         a pair of glasses missing one lens. He has been watching the air conditioner all day.

         bed, undressed, with the good right leg curled under him and the bad ankle soaking
         in a janitor-pail of dissolved Epsom salts, looking through one of Mario\x{2019}s old Hush
         Puppy shoeboxes of letters and snapshots. Saturdays involve classes and drills and
         P.M. matches but no conditioning run or weight circuits. Afternoon\x{2019}s odd mismatched challenge
         matches held on staff-squeegeed Center Courts under a steady metal sunless sky. The
         air still damp after lunchtime\x{2019}s rain. Hal\x{2019}s own odd match was truncated when C-squadder
         Hugh Pemberton took a ball in the eye up at net and began wandering the service box
         in wobbled circles. Hal skipped a quick trip down to the Pump Room and got to shower
         nearly solo in the main locker room. Tomorrow\x{2019}s Interdependence Day communal supper
         at E.T.A. is a big deal and includes each person\x{2019}s own specially selected hat, plus
         real dessert, and a post-prandial Mario-made film, and sometimes a sing-along. Hal
         and Pemulis, Struck and Axford and Troeltsch and Schacht and sometimes Stice have
         their own special private day-before-I.-Day-ritualistic-supper-out-and-trip-to-The-Unexamined-Life
         blowout-gala, since Sunday is a day of total mandatory R&R. The untruncated matches
         are winding down out there, Hal can hear. The sun is coming out just in time to go
         down. The Comm.-Ad. pipes start to moan and sing with crowded showering kids. Pale
         net-shadows are starting to elongate acutely across the sidelines of the courts\x{2019} north
         sides. Mario is more or less the Incandenza family archivist ex officio. Mario has
         been closeted with Disney Leith all day preparing things for Sunday\x{2019}s post-prandial
         gala and filmfest. The phone sits mute atop the answering-machine attachment on the
         telephone\x{2019}s power unit\x{2019}s console. Its antenna is retracted and it simply sits there,
         exuding the vague contained menace of mute phones. The phone\x{2019}s ringer sort of twitters
         instead of ringing. The audio-only comm.-system\x{2019}s power console is bolted to a receptacle
         on the side of Hal and Mario\x{2019}s TP, and its red power light blinks at the slow liquid
         rate of a radio tower. The phone and answering machine are hand-me-downs from Orin\x{2019}s
         days at E.T.A., old models of transparent plastic, so you can see everything\x{2019}s quad-colored
         pasta of wires and chips and tin disks. The only message when Hal got in was from
         Orin at <<1412h|1>>. Orin had said he\x{2019}d just called to ask whether by any chance Hal\x{2019}d ever
         realized that all of Emily Dickinson\x{2014}as in the Belle of Amherst Emily Dickinson, the
         canonical agoraphobic poet\x{2014}that every single one of Ms. Dickinson\x{2019}s canonical poems
         could by sung without loss or syllabic distortion to the tune of \x{2018}The Yellow Rose
         (of Texas).\x{2019} \x{2018}Because I could not stop for Death He kindly stopped for Me,\x{2019} Orin had sung illustratively onto the recording. \x{2018}I hope the Father in the skies Will lift his litt le Girl.\x{2019} Actually more like sort of sung. There\x{2019}d been professional-locker-room sounds in
         the background\x{2014}locker doors banging, bass voices on tile and steel, personal stereos,
         hisses of antiperspirant and styling-spritz. The odd enclosed echo of locker rooms
         everywhere, junior or pro. \x{2018}On my volcano grows the Grass A meditative spot,\x{2019} and so on. The fleshy pop of a professionally snapped towel on adult skin. A black
         man\x{2019}s falsetto laughter. Orin\x{2019}s recorded voice said he\x{2019}d just grabbed an odd free

         Boys\x{2019} 10\x{2019}s. We were the two best 10-year-old males in Boston. We soon became practice
         partners, our mothers driving us every weekday afternoon to a junior development program
         at the Auburndale Tennis Club in West Newton. After my own parents were horribly killed
         on the Jamaica Way commuter road one morning in the freak crash of a radio traffic-report
         helicopter, I became a sort of hanger-on at the Incandenza house out in Weston. When
         J.O.I. founded the Academy, I was one of the first matriculants. Orin and I were inseparable
         until around age 15, when I reached my own zenith in terms of early puberty and athletic
         promise and began to be able to beat him. He took it hard. We were never inseparable
         again. We spent quantity time together again briefly for a few months the next year,
         during a period when we both experimented heavily with recreational substances. We
         both ended up losing enthusiasm for substances after only a couple years, Orin because
         he had finally entered puberty and had discovered the weaker sex and found he needed
         all his faculties and guile, myself because a couple of really negative methoxy-psychedelic
         experiences left me with certain Disabilities that to this day make normal life an
         exceptional challenge, and which I tend to blame on having done deadly-serious hallucinogens
         at a sort of larval psychological stage during which no N. American adolescent should
         be allowed to do hallucinogens. These Disabilities led to my departure from the Enfield
         Tennis Academy at <<17|9c:0>>, prior to graduation, and my withdrawal from competitive junior
         tennis and contemporary life as we know it. Orin was largely burned out on tennis

         their footprints to fill and their obscurely academic-type-journal articles to try
         and absorb and, like, synthesize. Struck\x{2019}s been at this over an hour, and his original
         sights have lowered considerably. He\x{2019}s been feeling a bit punk all day, sinuses with

         See for instance Wayne, who\x{2019}d been in their room right after lunch when Pemulis had
         made the decision to come up for some pre-match Tenuate. Wayne\x{2019}s room was right nearby
         and he was standing there over Troeltsch\x{2019}s pharmacopic bedside table with no shirt
         and wet hair, rheumy-eyed and shiny-nostriled from moisturizer on his Kleenex-chafed
         nostrils. The Viking was squeezing a damp tennis ball with his left hand while he
         scanned his forehead by mostly feel. Pemulis\x{2019}s psychic counter-strategy was not to
         appear in any hurry to dress and stretch and get out there either. Pemulis\x{2014}who feared
         and hated unauthorized people being in his room, and who was constantly on Schacht\x{2019}s
         back about forgetting to lock up when he left, and who wasn\x{2019}t intimidated by Wayne\x{2019}s
         talent and success and affectless reserve, but was cautious around him, John Wayne,
         sort of the way a formidable predator will be unintimidated but cautious around another
         formidable predator, particularly since the virtuosic but tense performance in a certain
         administrative office a week ago, which had been mentioned by neither man\x{2014}had coolly
         asked Wayne if he could help him, and Wayne had just as coolly not looked up from
         rattling through sickly Jim Troeltsch\x{2019}s bedside table\x{2019}s stuff and said he\x{2019}d come in
         for some of Troeltsch\x{2019}s Seldane e, which Pemulis had indeed heard Troeltsch at breakfast describing to a nose-blowing
         Wayne as the battlefield-nuke of antihistamines that didn\x{2019}t make you too drowsy to
         function at an incredibly high level of function. Pemulis adjusted his jock\x{2019}s rear
         straps, trying to remember this Wayne-memory\x{2019}s point. Wayne had wanted a clear head
         and high pulmonary function because he was down to play the Syrian Satelliter in an
         informal exhibition at <<1515h|1>>. Wayne hadn\x{2019}t offered this explanation; Pemulis got it
         off the e-board. One reason Pemulis was cautiously unassertive about Wayne\x{2019}s unauthorized
         presence in the room was the leaflet, which given a certain office-incident it wasn\x{2019}t
         impossible Wayne might choose to suspect seeing Pemulis\x{2019}s hand in the Olde-English-fonted
         leaflet up at various boards and inserted on the E.T.A. TPs\x{2019} communal e-board for
         11/14 announcing a joint John Wayne/Dr. Avril Incandenza arithmetic presentation to
         the pre-quadrivial 14-and-Unders on how 17 can actually go into 56 way more than 3.294
         times. The point was that the half-dressed Wayne had been standing there with one
         foot bare and one in a sock and shoe. Pemulis shook his head slightly and looked down
         at Possalthwaite and tried to gather spit.",
