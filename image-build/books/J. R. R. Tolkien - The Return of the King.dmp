  After the fall of the Dark Tower and the passing of Sauron the Shadow was lifted from the hearts of all who opposed him, but
   fear and despair fell upon his servants and allies. Three times L\x{f3}rien had been assailed from Dol Guldur, but besides the
   valour of the elven people of that land, the power that dwelt there was too great for any to overcome, unless Sauron had come

   there himself. Though grievous harm was done to the fair woods on the borders, the assaults were driven back; and when the
   Shadow passed, Celeborn came forth and led the host of L\x{f3}rien over Anduin in many boats. They took Dol Guldur, and Galadriel
   threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, and the forest was cleansed.",
