According to the principle observed above, Grade 6 should then have represented the voiceless nasals; but since such sounds (exemplified by Welsh nh or ancient English hn) were of very rare occurrence in the languages concerned, Grade 6 (<<21\x{2013}24|5a:0>>) was most often used for the weakest or \x{2018}semi-vocalic\x{2019} consonants of each series. It consisted of the smallest and simplest shapes among the primary letters. Thus 21 was often used for a weak (untrilled) r, originally occurring in Quenya and regarded in the system of that language as the weakest consonant of the tincot\x{e9}ma; 22 was widely used for w; where Series III was used as a palatal series 23 was commonly used as consonantal y.",
