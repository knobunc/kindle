            "The wizard Heald coupled with a poor woman once, in the king\x{2019}s city of Mondor, and she bore a son with one green eye and one black eye. Heald, who had two eyes black as the black marshes of Fyrbolg, came and went like a wind out of the woman\x{2019}s life, but the child Myk stayed in Mondor until he was fifteen. Big-shouldered and strong, he was apprenticed to a smith, and men who came to have their carts mended or horses shod were inclined to curse his slowness and his sullenness, until something would stir in him, sluggish as a marsh beast waking beneath murk. Then he would turn his head and look at them out of his black eye, and they would fall silent, shift away from him. There was a streak of wizardry in him, like the streak of fire in damp, smoldering wood. He spoke rarely to men with his brief, rough voice, but when he touched a horse, a hungry dog or a dove in a cage on market day, the fire would surface in his black eye, and his voice would run sweet as a daydreaming voice of the Slinoon River.
    

    
      One day he left Mondor and went to Eld Mountain. Eld was the highest mountain in Eldwold, rising behind Mondor and casting its black shadow over the city at twilight when the sun slipped, lost, into its mists. From the fringe of the mists, shepherds or young boys hunting could see beyond Mondor, west to the flat Plain of Terbrec, land of the Sirle Lords, north to Fallow Field, where the third King of Eldwold\x{2019}s ghost brooded still on his last battle, and where no living thing grew beneath his restless, silent steps. There, in the rich, dark forests of Eld Mountain, in the white silence, Myk began a collection of wondrous, legendary animals.
    

    
      From the wild lake country of North Eldwold, he called to him the Black Swan of Tirlith, the great-winged, golden-eyed bird that had carried the third daughter of King Merroc on its back away from the stone tower where she was held captive. He sent the powerful, silent thread of his call into the deep, thick forests on the other side of Eld, where no man had ever gone and returned, and caught like a salmon the red-eyed, white-tusked Boar Cyrin, who could sing ballads like a harpist, and who knew the answers to all riddles save one. From the dark, silent heart of the Mountain itself, Myk brought Gyld, the green-winged dragon, whose mind, dreaming for centuries over the cold fire of gold, woke sleepily, pleasurably, to the sound of its name in the half-forgotten song Myk sent crooning into the darkness. Coaxing a handful of ancient jewels from the dragon, Myk built a house of white, polished stone among the tall pines, and a great garden for the animals enclosed within the ring of stone wall and iron-wrought gates. Into that house he took eventually a fountain girl with few words and no fear either of animals or their keeper. She was of poor family, with tangled hair and muscled arms, and she saw in Myk\x{2019}s household things that others saw perhaps once in their lives in a line of old poetry or in a harpist\x{2019}s tale.
    

    
      She bore Myk a son with two black eyes who learned to stand silent as a dead tree while Myk called. Myk taught him to read the ancient ballads and legends in the books he collected, taught him to send the call of a half-forgotten name across the whole of Eldwold and the lands beyond, taught him to wait in silence, in patience for weeks, months or years until the moment when the shock of the call would flame in the strange, powerful, startled mind of the animal that owned the name. When Myk went out of himself forever, sitting silent in the moonlight, his son Ogam continued the collection.
    

    
      Ogam coaxed out of the Southern Deserts behind Eld Mountain the Lyon Gules, who with a pelt the color of a king\x{2019}s treasury had seduced many an imprudent man into unwanted adventure. He stole from the hearth of a witch beyond Eldwold the huge black Cat Moriah, whose knowledge of spells and secret charms had once been legendary in Eldwold. The blue-eyed Falcon Ter, who had torn to pieces the seven murderers of the wizard Aer, shot like a thunderbolt out of the blue sky onto Ogam\x{2019}s shoulder. After a brief, furious struggle, blue eyes staring into black, the hot grip of talons loosened; the Falcon gave his name and yielded to Ogam\x{2019}s great power.
    

    
      With the crook of an ungentle smile inherited from Myk, Ogam called also to him the oldest daughter of the Lord Horst of Hilt as she rode one day too close to the Mountain. She was a frail, beautiful child-woman, frightened of the silence and the strange, gorgeous animals that reminded her of things on the old tapestry in her father\x{2019}s house. She was afraid also of Ogam, with his sheathed, still power and his inscrutable eyes. She bore him one child, and died. The child, unaccountably, was a girl. Ogam recovered from his surprise eventually and named her Sybel.
    

    
      She grew tall and strong in the Mountain wildness, with her mother\x{2019}s slender bones and ivory hair and her father\x{2019}s black, fearless eyes. She cared for the animals, tended the garden, and learned early how to hold a restless animal against its will, how to send an ancient name out of the silence of her mind, to probe into hidden, forgotten places. Ogam, proud of her quickness, built a room for her with a great dome of crystal, thin as glass, hard as stone, where she could sit beneath the colors of the night world and call in peace. He died when she was sixteen, leaving her alone with the beautiful white house, a vast library of heavy, iron-bound books, a collection of animals beyond all dreaming, and the power to hold them.
    

    
      She read one night not long afterward, in one of his oldest books, of a great white bird with wings that glided like snowy pennants unfurled in the wind, a bird that had carried the only Queen of Eldwold on its back in days long before. She spoke its name softly to herself: Liralen; and, seated on the floor beneath the dome, with the book still open in her lap, she sent a first call forth into the vast Eldwold night for the bird whose name no one had spoken for centuries. The call was broken abruptly by someone shouting at her locked gates.
    

    
      She woke the Lyon, asleep in the garden, with a touch of her mind, and sent it padding to the gates to cast a golden, warning eye at the intruder. But the shouting continued, urgent, incoherent. She sighed, exasperated, and sent the Falcon Ter instructions to lift the intrudes and drop him off the top of Eld Mountain. The shouting ceased suddenly, a moment later, but a baby\x{2019}s thin, uncomforted voice wailed into the silence, startling her. She rose finally, walked through the marble hall in her bare feet, out into the garden where the animals stirred restlessly in the darkness about her. She reached the gates, of thin iron bars and gold joints, and looked out.
    

    
      An armed man stood with a baby in his arms and Ter Falcon on his shoulder. The man was silent, frozen motionless under the play of Ter\x{2019}s grip; the child in his mailed arms cried, oblivious. Sybel\x{2019}s eyes moved from the still, half-shadowed face to the Falcon\x{2019}s eyes.
    

    
      I told you, she said privately, to drop him off the top of Eld Mountain.
    

    
      The blue, unwavering eyes looked down into hers. You are young, Ter said, but you are without doubt powerful, and I will obey you if you tell me a second time. But I will tell you first, having known men for countless years, that if you begin killing them, one day they will grow frightened, come in great numbers, tear down your house and loose your animals. So the Master Ogam told us many times.
    

    
      Sybel\x{2019}s bare foot tapped a moment on the earth. She moved her eyes to the man\x{2019}s face and said,
    

    
      \x{201c}Who are you? Why are you shouting at my gates?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Lady,\x{201d} the man said carefully, for the ruffled feathers of Ter\x{2019}s wing brushed his face, \x{201c}are you the daughter of Laran, daughter of Horst, Lord of Hilt?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Laran was my mother,\x{201d} Sybel said, shifting from one foot to another impatiently. \x{201c}Who are you?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren of Sirle. My brother had a child by your aunt\x{2014}your mother\x{2019}s youngest sister.\x{201d} He stopped with a sudden click of breath between his teeth, and Sybel waved a hand at the Falcon.
    

    
      Loose him, or I will be standing here all night. But stay close in case he is mad.
    

    
      The Falcon rose, glided to a low tree branch above the man\x{2019}s head. The man closed his eyes a moment; tiny beads of blood welled like tears through his shirt of mail. He looked young in the moonlight, and his hair was the color of fire. Sybel looked at him curiously, for he gleamed like water at night with link upon link of metal.
    

    
      \x{201c}Why are you dressed like that?\x{201d} she said, and he opened his eyes.
    

    
      \x{201c}I have been at Terbrec.\x{201d} He glanced up at the dark outline of bird above him. \x{201c}Where did you get such a falcon? He cut through iron and leather and silk...\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He killed seven men,\x{201d} Sybel said, \x{201c}who killed the wizard Aer for the jewels on his books of wisdom.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Ter,\x{201d} the young man breathed, and her brows rose in surprise.
    

    
      \x{201c}Who are you?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I told you. Coren of Sirle.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But that means nothing to me. What are you doing at my gates with a baby?\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren of Sirle said very slowly and patiently, \x{201c}Your mother, Laran, had a sister named Rianna\x{2014}she was your aunt. She married the King of Eldwold three years ago. My\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Who is the King these days?\x{201d} Sybel asked curiously.
    

    
      The young man caught a startled breath. \x{201c}Drede. Drede is the King of Eldwold, and he has been King for fifteen years.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh. Go on\x{2014}Drede married Rianna. That is very interesting, but I have a Liralen to call.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Please!\x{201d} He glanced up at the Falcon and lowered his voice. \x{201c}Please. I have been fighting for three days. Then my uncle tossed a baby into my arms and told me to give it to the wizard woman on Eld Mountain. Suppose, I said, she will not take him? What will she want with a baby? And he looked at me and said, you will not come down from that mountain with the child\x{2014}do you want your brother\x{2019}s son dead?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But why does he want to give it to me?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Because it is the child of Rianna and Norrel, and they are both dead.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel blinked. \x{201c}But you said Rianna was married to Drede.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}She was.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Then why is the child Norrel\x{2019}s son? I do not understand.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren\x{2019}s voice rose perilously. \x{201c}Because Norrel and Rianna were lovers. And Drede killed Norrel three days ago on the Plain of Terbrec. Now will you take the baby so I can go back and kill Drede?\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel looked at him out of her black, unwinking eyes. \x{201c}You will not shout at me,\x{201d} she said very softly. The mailed hands of Coren curled and uncurled in the moonlight. He took a step toward her, and the soft light shaped the long bones of his face, traced lines of exhaustion beneath his eyes.
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sorry,\x{201d} he whispered. \x{201c}Please. Try to understand. I have ridden the late day and half the night. My brother and half my kinsmen are dead. The Lord of Niccon joined forces with Drede, and Sirle cannot stand against them both. Rianna died of the child\x{2019}s birth. If Drede finds the child, he will kill it out of revenge. There is no safe place for it in Sirle. There is no safe place for it anywhere but here, where Drede will not think to come. Drede has killed Norrel, but I swear he will not take this child. Please. Take care of him. His mother was of your family.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel looked down at the child. It had stopped crying; the night was very still about them. It waved tiny fists aimlessly in the air, and pushed at the soft blanket wrapped around it. She touched its pale, plump face, and its eyes turned toward her, winking like stars.
    

    
      \x{201c}My mother died of me,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}What is its name?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Tamlorn.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Tamlorn. It is very pretty. I wish it had been a girl.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}If it had been, I would not have had to ride all this way to hide it. Drede is afraid the child might declare its legitimacy, when it is older, and fight Drede\x{2019}s own heir. Sirle would back it\x{2014}my people have been playing for the kingship of Eldwold ever since King Harth died at Fallow Field and Tarn of Sirle held the throne for twelve years, then lost it again.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But if everyone knows the child is not Drede\x{2019}s\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Only Drede, Rianna and Norrel know the truth of the matter, and Rianna and Norrel are dead. Kings\x{2019} bastards can be very dangerous.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He does not look dangerous.\x{201d} Her lean, pale fingers whispered over its cheek. A smile strayed absently across her face. \x{201c}It will go nicely, I think, in the collection.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren\x{2019}s arms tightened around the child. \x{201c}It is Norrel\x{2019}s son\x{2014}it is not an animal.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel\x{2019}s level eyes raised. \x{201c}Is it not less? It eats and sleeps and it does not think, and it requires special care. Only... I do not know what to do with a baby. It cannot tell me what it needs.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren was silent a moment. When he spoke finally, she heard the weariness haunting his voice like an overtone. \x{201c}You are a girl. You should know such things.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Why?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Because\x{2014}because you will have children someday and you\x{2014}will have to know how to care for them.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I had no woman to care for me,\x{201d} Sybel said. \x{201c}My father fed me goat\x{2019}s milk and taught me to read his books. I suppose I will have a child that I can train to care for the animals when I am dead.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren gazed at her, his lips parted. \x{201c}If it were not for my uncle,\x{201d} he said softly, \x{201c}I would take the child back home rather than leave Norrel\x{2019}s son here with you, your ignorance and your heart of ice.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel\x{2019}s face grew as still before him as the still full moon. \x{201c}It is you who are ignorant,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}I could have Ter rip you into seven pieces and drop your bloodless head on the Plain of Terbrec, but I am controlling my temper. Look!\x{201d}
    

    
      She unlocked the gates, her fingers shaking in an anger that roused through her like a clean mountain wind. She snapped private calls into the dream-drugged minds about her, and, like pieces of dreams themselves, the animals moved toward her. Coren stepped in beside her. He propped the child on one shoulder, his mailed arms protecting its back, one hand cupping its head, while his eyes slid, wide, over the moving, rustling darkness. The great Boar reached them first, fire-white in the darkness, his tusks like white marble that hunters dreamed of, and a sound came, inarticulate, from Coren\x{2019}s throat. Sybel rested one hand above the small red eyes. \x{201c}Do you think because I care for these animals, I cannot care for a child? They are ancient, powerful as princes, wise and restless and dangerous, and I give them whatever they require. So I will give this child what it requires. And if that is not what you want, then leave. I did not ask you to come with a child; I do not care if you go with it. I may be ignorant in your world, but here you are in my world and you are a fool.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren stared down at the Boar, struggling for words. \x{201c}Cyrin,\x{201d} he whispered. \x{201c}Cyrin. You have him.\x{201d} He stopped again, his breath jerking through his open mouth. His voice came slow, dredging memory. \x{201c}Rondar\x{2014}Lord of Runrir captured\x{2014}the Boar Cyrin that no man had captured before, the elusive Cyrin, Keeper of Riddles and\x{2014}demanded either Cyrin\x{2019}s life or all the wisdom of the world. And Cyrin uprooted a stone at Rondar\x{2019}s feet, and Rondar said it was worthless and rode away, still searching...\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}How do you know that tale?\x{201d} Sybel asked, astonished. \x{201c}It is not one of Eldwold.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know it. I know.\x{201d} He lifted his head, his arms tight around the child as a great shape swooped toward them, silent, a shadow upon the night. The Swan folded itself gently before them, its back broad as the Boar\x{2019}s, its eyes black as the night between two stars
    

    
      \x{201c}The Swan of Tirlith\x{2014}Is it the Swan? Sybel, is it?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}How do you know my name?\x{201d} she whispered.
    

    
      \x{201c}I know.\x{201d} He watched two cats ease through the night, coming from opposite sides of the house, and she heard him swallow. Tamlorn struggled in his arms, but Coren did not move. The Cat Moriah reached them, nudged its black, flat head under Sybel\x{2019}s hand, then lay down on her feet and yawned at Coren, showing teeth like honed polished stones.
    

    
      \x{201c}Moriah... Lady of the Night, who gave the wizard Tak the spell that opened the doorless tower where he was captured... I do not\x{2014}I do not know the Lyon\x{2014}\x{201d} Gules Lyon, his eyes liquid gold, traced a close circle about Coren\x{2019}s legs, then settled in front of him, muscle sliding leisurely into muscle beneath the glowing pelt. Coren shook his head quickly. \x{201c}Wait\x{2014}There was a Lyon of the Southern Deserts who lived in the courts of great lords, dispensing wisdom, fed on rich meats, wearing their collars and chains of iron and gold only so long as he chose... Gules.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}How do you know these things?\x{201d}
    

    
      The Lyon\x{2019}s great head turned toward Sybel. Where, Gules inquired curiously, did you find this one?
    

    
      He brought me a baby, Sybel said distractedly. He knows my name, and I do not know how.
    

    
      \x{201c}Once he could speak,\x{201d} Coren said.
    

    
      \x{201c}Once they all could. They have been wild, away from men so long that they have forgotten how, except for Cyrin, just as men\x{2014}most men\x{2014}have forgotten their names. How do you\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren started beside her, and she looked up. The span of unfurled wings blotted the moon, shadowed their faces, then dropped lower, each stroke sucking a heartbeat of wind. Tamlorn kicked restlessly against Coren\x{2019}s hold, wailed a complaint into his ear. The Dragon dropped sluggishly before them, holding Coren in its lucent green gaze. Its shadow welled huge to their feet. Its mind-voice was ancient, dry as parchment in Sybel\x{2019}s mind.
    

    
      There is a cave in the mountains where his bones will never be found.
    

    
      No. I called you because I was angry, but <<1 am|5>> not angry, now. He is not to be harmed.
    

    
      He is a man, armed.
    

    
      No. She turned to Coren, as he stood watching the Dragon with Tamlorn wriggling, whimpering, ignored in his arms, and her eyes curved suddenly in a little smile. \x{201c}You know that one.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}His name is not so old that men have forgotten it. There was an Eldwold prince taking rich gifts over the Mountain to a southern lord to buy arms and men, whose bones and treasure have never been found... There are tales still told of fire blazing out of the summer sky over Mondor, and the crops burning, and the Slinoon River steaming in its bed.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He is old and tired,\x{201d} Sybel said. \x{201c}Those days are behind him. I hold his name, and he cannot free himself from me to do such things again.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren shifted Tamlorn finally, and the baby quieted. The dark prints of weariness had eased from his face, leaving it young for a moment, wondering. He looked down at her.
    

    
      \x{201c}They are beautiful. So beautiful.\x{201d} He looked down at her a moment longer, before he spoke again. \x{201c}I must go. There will be news of the battle at Mondor. I cannot bear the thought that my brothers may be dead and I do not know. Will you take Tamlorn? He will be safe here, with such a guard. Will you love him? That\x{2014}that is what he requires most.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel nodded wordlessly. She took the child, holding it awkwardly, and it tugged curiously at her long hair. \x{201c}But how do you know so many things? How do you know my name?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh. I asked an old woman living down the road a ways. She gave your name to me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I do not know any old women.\x{201d}
    

    
      He smiled at a memory. \x{201c}You should know that one. I think\x{2014}I think if you need help with Tamlorn, she will give it to you.\x{201d} He paused, looking at Tamlorn. He touched the soft, round cheek, and the smile drained from his face. leaving it numb with a bewildered grief. \x{201c}Good-bye. Thank you,\x{201d} he whispered, and turned. Sybel followed him to the gate.
    

    
      \x{201c}Good-bye,\x{201d} she said through the bars as he mounted. \x{201c}I know nothing of wars, but I know something of sorrow. And that, I think, is what you pass from hand to hand at Terbrec.\x{201d}
    

    
      He looked down at her, mounted. \x{201c}It is true,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I know.\x{201d}
    

    
      She met, as she turned away from the gate, the little round, fiery eyes of the silver Boar in her path. She caught the minds around her, holding them all in their quietness with an effort. You may go now. I am sorry I woke you, but 1 lost my temper.
    

    
      The Boar did not move. You cannot give love, he remarked, until you have first taken it.
    

    
      You are not very helpful, Sybel said irritably, and the great Boar gave a little snort that was his private laughter.
    

    
      That old woman climbed the wall once, looking for herbs. I snorted at her and she snorted back at me. She could help you. What would you give me for all the wisdom of the world?
    

    
      Nothing, because I do not want it now. Give it to Coren. He said I had a heart of ice.
    

    
      Cyrin snorted again, gently. Indeed, he needs wisdom.
    

    
      I told him so, Sybel said.
    

    
      The next morning, she went out of the house, down the mountain path that led to the city below. The great old pines swayed in the wind, creaking and moaning of the coming of winter. Their needles were soft and cold under her bare feet, stroked here and there with sunlight. She carried Tamlorn, sleeping, in the white wool blanket. He was warm and heavy in her arms, soft and freshly washed. She watched his face, with its long, pale lashes and its heavy cheeks. Once she stopped to nuzzle her face against his soft, pale hair.
    

    
      \x{201c}Tamlorn,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}Tamlorn. My Tam.\x{201d}
    

    
      She saw a small house within the trees, its chimney smoking. A gray cat curled asleep on the roof, and a black raven perched on a pair of antlers hanging above the door. Doves, pecking in the yard, fluttered around her as she walked to the door. The raven looked down at her sideways out of one eye and gave a cry like a question: Who? She ignored it, opened the door. Then she stood motionless in the doorway, for across the threshold there was no floor but mist that moved uneasily, immeasurable at her feet. She looked around, puzzled, and saw the walls of the house looking back at her, with eyes and round dark mouths. The door slipped out of her hand, closed behind her, and the mists moved upward, coiling around the watching eyes, covering them, until it hid even the roof; and the raven flew toward her from somewhere beyond the mists, and gave its question again: Who?
    

    
      Tamlorn wriggled in her arms, wailed a complaint. She kissed him absently. Then she said, standing in the strange, watching house,
    

    
      \x{201c}Whose heart am I in?\x{201d}
    

    
      The mist vanished and the watching faces hardened into pine knot. A thin old woman in a leaf-colored robe, with white hair in a thousand untidy curls around her face, rose from a rocking chair, her ringed hands clasped.
    

    
      \x{201c}A baby!\x{201d} She took him from Sybel, made noises at it like cooing doves. Tamlorn stared at her and made a sudden catch at her long nose. He smiled toothlessly as she clucked at him. Then she looked at Sybel, her eyes iron-gray, sharper than a king\x{2019}s blade. \x{201c}You.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Me,\x{201d} said Sybel. \x{201c}I need advice, if you would be pleased to give it to me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}With Cyrin Boar and Gules Lyon to advise you, child, you come to me? Why, what lovely hair you have, so long and fine... Has any man told you that?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Cyrin Boar and Gules Lyon have never had a baby dumped in their arms. I must give it what it requires, and it cannot tell me. Cyrin said you might help me, since you snorted at him. Cyrin at times makes no sense. But can you help me?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Onions,\x{201d} said the old woman. Sybel blinked at her.
    

    
      \x{201c}Old woman, I have stood in the eye of your heart while you looked at me, and anyone with such an inner eye is no fool. Will you help me?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Of course, child. I let you in. Onions\x{2014}you grow them in your garden. I was trying to remember. Will you let me have a few, now and then?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Of course.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I love them in a good stew. Sit down\x{2014}there, on the sheepskin by the hearth. That was given to me by a man from the city who hated his wife and wanted to be rid of her.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Men are strange in the city. I do not understand loving and hating, only being and knowing. But now I must learn how to love this child.\x{201d} She paused a moment, her ivory brows crooked a little. \x{201c}I think I do love him. He is soft, and he fits so into my arms, and if Coren of Sirle came for him again, it would be hard to give him up.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So, what?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So it is Drede\x{2019}s child. I have been hearing about that from my birds.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren said it is Norrel\x{2019}s child.\x{201d}
    

    
      The thin lips smiled. \x{201c}I do not think so. I think he is the son of Drede the King. There is a raven at the King\x{2019}s palace whose eyes never close...\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel stared at her, lips parted. She drew a slow breath. \x{201c}I do not understand such things. But he is mine now to love. It is very strange. I have had my animals for sixteen years, and this child for one night; and if I had to choose one thing from all of them, I am not sure that I would not choose this thing, so helpless and stupid as he is. Perhaps because the animals could go and require nothing from anyone, but my Tam requires everything from me.\x{201d}
    

    
      The woman watched her, rocking back and forth in her chair, rings flashing on her still hands, fire-flecked.
    

    
      \x{201c}You are a strange child... so fearless and so powerful to hold such great, lordly beasts. I wonder you are not lonely sometimes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Why should I be? I have many things to talk to. My father never spoke much\x{2014}I learned silence from him, silence of the mind that is like clear, still water, in which nothing is hidden. That is the first thing he taught me, for if you cannot be so silent, you will not hear the answer when you call. I was trying to call the Liralen, last night when Coren came.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Liralen...\x{201d} The old woman\x{2019}s face softened until it seemed dreaming and young beneath her curls. \x{201c}The pennant-winged, moon-colored Liralen... Oh, child, when you capture it finally, let me see it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will. But it is very hard to find, especially when people interrupt me with babies. My father fed me goat\x{2019}s milk, but Tam does not seem to like it.\x{201d}
    

    
      The old woman sighed. \x{201c}I wish I could feed him, but a cow would be more useful, unless I find some mountain woman to nurse him.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He is mine,\x{201d} Sybel said. \x{201c}I do not want some other woman to begin to love him.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Of course, child, but\x{2014} Will you let me love him, just a little? It has been so long since I have had children to love. I will steal a cow from someone, leave a jewel in its place.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I can call a cow.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No, child, if anyone is a thief it must be me. You must think of yourself, of what would happen if people suspected you of calling away their animals.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am not afraid of people. They are fools.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, child; but they can be so powerful in their loving and hating. Did your father, when he talked to you, give you a name?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am Sybel. But you did not have to ask me that.\x{201d}
    

    
      The gray eyes curved faintly. \x{201c}Oh, yes, my birds are everywhere... But there is a difference in a name spoken of, and a name given at last by the bearer. You know that. My name is Maelga. And the child\x{2019}s name? Will you give me that as a gift?\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel smiled. \x{201c}Yes. I would like you to have his name. It is Tamlorn.\x{201d} She looked down at him, her ivory hair tickling the small, plump face. \x{201c}Tamlorn. My Tam,\x{201d} she whispered, and Tamlorn laughed.
    

    
      So Maelga stole a cow and left a jeweled ring in its place, and for months afterward people left their barn doors open hopefully. Tam grew strong, pale-haired and gray-eyed, and he laughed and shouted through the still white halls, and teased the patient animals and fed them. Years passed, and he became lean and brown, and explored the Mountain with shepherd boys, climbing through the mists, searching deep caves, bringing home red foxes, birds and strange herbs for Maelga. Sybel continued her long search for the Liralen, calling nights, disappearing for days at a time and returning with old, jeweled books with iron locks that might hold its name. Maelga chided her for stealing, and she would reply absently,
    

    
      \x{201c}From little wizardlings, who do not know how to use them. I must have that Liralen. It is my obsession.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}One day,\x{201d} Maelga said, \x{201c}you will mistake a great wizard for a little wizardling.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So? I am great, too. And I must have the Liralen.\x{201d}
    

    
      One evening, twelve years after Coren had brought Tamlorn to her, Sybel went to the cold, deep cave Myk had built for Gyld the Dragon. It lay behind a ribbon of water, and trees about it grew huge and still as pillars vaulting a chamber of silence. She stepped over three rocks to the falls, then slipped behind it, the water running across her face like tears. Within, the cave was dark and wet as the heart of a mountain; Gyld\x{2019}s green eyes glowed in it like jewels. The great, folded bulk of him formed a shadow against the deeper shadow. Sybel stood still before him, like a slender pale flame in the dark. She looked into the unblinking eyes.
    

    
      Yes?
    

    
      Thoughts rose slow and formless as a dark bubble in the Dragon\x{2019}s mind, and opened to the dry, parchment rustle of his voice. It has been a thousand years since I fell asleep over the gold I gathered from Prince Sirkel, and fell asleep watching his open eyes and his blood trickle slowly over coin piece and coin piece and gather in the hollow neck of a cup. His voice whispered away. There was silence while another bubble formed and broke. I dream of that gold, and wake to see it, and it is not here... I wake to cold stone. Give me leave to gather it once more.
    

    
      Sybel was silent as a stone rising from stone. She said, You will fly, and men will see you and remember your deeds with terror. They will come to destroy my house and they will see gold burning in the sun, and nothing, nothing will turn them back from my house.
    

    
      No, said Gyld. I will go by night and gather it in secret, and if any man watches, I will slay in secret.
    

    
      Then, said Sybel, they would come and kill us both.
    

    
      No man can kill me.
    

    
      What of me? And Tam? No.
    

    
      The great bulk stirred, amorphous, and she felt the warm sigh of his breath.
    

    
      I was old and forgotten when the Master woke me by name in the hollow veins of Eld, and brought me out of my dreaming with his song of my deeds... It was pleasant to be sung of once more... It is pleasant to be named by you, but I must have my sweet gold...
    

    
      Quick and turning as a snake his thoughts fled away from her, slipping down, down through caverns of his mind to the dark maze of it. Swift as water draining into earth, stealthy as man burying man beneath moonlight, he carried his name down to the forgetting regions where he was nameless even to himself, but she was there before him, waiting behind the last door of his mind. She stood among the half fragments of his memories of slayings, lustings and half-eaten meals and said,
    

    
      If you want this so badly, I will think of a way. Do nothing, but be patient. I will think.
    

    
      His breath came once more, and his thoughts welled once more to the dark cave. Do this one thing for me, and I will be patient.
    

    
      She stepped out of the cave, water shining in her hair, and breathed deeply of the cool night air. She thought of the Dragon in flight, smooth flame in motion, and of the deep, peaceful pools of the Black Swan\x{2019}s eyes, and the memory of the Dragon\x{2019}s ground mind with the broken embers of his passions faded deep into her own. Then she heard a rustling behind her in the dark, still earth, sensed a watching.
    

    
      \x{201c}Tam? Maelga?\x{201d}
    

    
      But no voice, no mind answered. The black trees rose like monoliths, blocking the stars. The rustling faded like the breath of wind into silence. She turned again toward the house, a line between her white brows.
    

    
      She went to see Maelga a few days later and sat on the skin by the fireplace, her arms around her knees, and Maelga watched her face as she stirred soup.
    

    
      \x{201c}There is Something in the forest without a name.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Are you afraid of it?\x{201d} Maelga asked. Sybel looked up at her surprisedly.
    

    
      \x{201c}Of course not. But how can I call it if it has no name? It is very strange. I cannot remember reading about a nameless thing anywhere. What are you cooking? If I were not already hungry, I would be hungry from the smell of it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Mushrooms,\x{201d} said Maelga. \x{201c}Onions, sage, turnips, cabbage, parsley, beets, and something Tam brought me that has no name.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Some day,\x{201d} Sybel said, \x{201c}Tam will poison us all.\x{201d} She leaned her shining head back against the stones and sighed. Maelga\x{2019}s eyes flicked to her.
    

    
      \x{201c}What is it? Does it have a name?\x{201d}
    

    
      She stirred. \x{201c}I do not know. I am very restless these days, but I do not know what I want. Sometimes, I fly with Ter in his thoughts as he hunts. He cannot fly as high as I want him to, or so fast, though the earth rushes beneath us and he goes higher than Eld Mountain... And I am there, when he kills. That is why I want the Liralen so. I can ride on its back and we can go far, far into the setting sun, the world of the stars. I want... I want something more than my father had, or even my grandfather, but I do not know what I want.\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga tasted the soup, the jewels on her thin hands winking. \x{201c}Pepper,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}And thyme. Only yesterday a young woman came to me wanting a trap set for a man with a sweet smile and lithe arms. She was a fool, not for wanting him, but for wanting more of him than that.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Did you help her?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}She gave me a box of sweet scent. So now she will be miserable and jealous for the rest of her life.\x{201d} She looked at Sybel, sitting still against the stones, her black eyes hidden, and she sighed. \x{201c}My child, can I do anything for you?\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel\x{2019}s eyes lifted, smiling faintly. \x{201c}Shall I add a man to my collection? I could. I could call anyone I want. But there is no one I want. Sometimes, the animals grow restless like this, dreaming of days of flights and adventures, of the acquiring of wisdom, of the sound of their names spoken in awe, in fear. The days are over, few remember their names, but they dream, still... and I think of the still way I learned, and how only my father, then you, then Tam, ever gave me back my name... I think... I think I want some days to take that mountain path down into the strange, incomprehensible world.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Then go, child,\x{201d} said Maelga. \x{201c}Go.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Perhaps I will. But who would keep my animals?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Hire a wizardling.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}For Ter? No wizardling could hold him. When I was Tam\x{2019}s age, I could hold him. I wish Tam were half wizard. But he is only half king.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You have never told him that, surely.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Am I a fool? What good would knowing that do? A dream like that could make him miserable. In the world below, it may even kill him. He is better off playing with shepherd boys and foxes and marrying, when he is old enough, some pretty mountain girl.\x{201d} She sighed again, her white brows creeping into a little frown. Then she straightened, startled, as the door burst open. Tam stared down at her, taut, glistening with sweat, his pale hair sticking in points to his flushed face.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel\x{2014} The Dragon\x{2014}he hurt a man\x{2014} Come quickly\x{2014}\x{201d} He flashed away like a hare. Sybel followed him out. She stood motionless as a tree in front of the house, and caught the current of the Dragon\x{2019}s thoughts with one swift blaze of his name.
    

    
      Gyld.
    

    
      She felt him curled in the darkness of his wet cave, thoughts tumbling in his mind of flight, of gold, of a man\x{2019}s pale face staring up at him, open-mouthed, then hidden suddenly behind his upflung arms. She gave a tiny murmur of surprise.
    

    
      \x{201c}What is it?\x{201d} Maelga said, her hands clasped anxiously. Sybel\x{2019}s thoughts came back to her.
    

    
      \x{201c}Gyld went to get his gold, and a man saw him flying with it, so Gyld attacked him.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, no. Oh, dear.\x{201d} Then her gray eyes pinpointed Sybel\x{2019}s face. \x{201c}You know him.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know him,\x{201d} she said slowly, and the frown deepened in her eyes. \x{201c}Coren of Sirle.\x{201d}",

            "It was a shadow in the shadows, a black mist taller than she, with eyes like circles of sightless, gleaming ice. She closed the book and slowly rose to face it. She touched its mind and found it as still, as dark.
    

    
      Give me your name.
    

    
      Its mind-voice was a rustle of dried leaf. Blammor.
    

    
      Why have you come to me so freely? Most struggle to hide their names. But you came uncalled.
    

    
      I was not uncalled. And you have a strange power, that draws me and that is to see me as I am truly. Therefore I came to you, and I will serve you, as one day you will serve that one who sees you truly.
    

    
      Do I see you truly now? A black mist with fire-white eyes, sightless yet seeing?
    

    
      That is part of me.
    

    
      You fascinate me, she said. Do all men see you this way? There are tales of your terribleness.
    

    
      Men see what they are most afraid of.
    

    
      What do you require of me?
    

    
      Nothing, it said, but your fearlessness. I will go now. I have night work.
    

    
      It faded into the shadows. They trembled a, moment at its passing.
    

    
      She turned, rubbing her chilled arms, a little smile crooking her mouth. She went to the hearth again and lit a taper from the green flame burning steadily on the mantel. The fire danced in a few moments from the hearth, and she lit candles from it, and torches, moving softly to place them in the chilled room, while the half-lit forms of Swan, Boar and Lyon watched her silently. Then, faint through the singing winter winds, she heard a shouting at her gates.
    

    
      Her white brows knit a little, puzzled. She called Ter, then remembered he had gone, so she took Cyrin out with her, and a fiery torch that set the deep snow ablaze about her. The flakes fell in huge, great wheels of intricate crystal that vanished in the torch flame. A man stood cloaked, hooded at the gates, his horse behind him. She moved the torch to light his face behind the bars and beneath the hood his hair flamed.
    

    
      She sighed. \x{201c}Oh.\x{201d} She unlocked the gates, and he stepped into the yard. \x{201c}Take your horse to the shed on the side of the house; I will keep the others out.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Thank you,\x{201d} he said, the words blowing white in the wind. His shoulders were cloaked with snow that melted in dark trails down his back as he took the torch from her.
    

    
      He joined her a few moments later in the house. He nodded courteously to Gules as he passed, and to Moriah, curled like a shadow. Sybel took his sodden cloak, hung it to dry beside the fire, and he stood at the hearth, drinking the flame, shuddering.
    

    
      \x{201c}That was a long, cold ride from Sirle. Sybel, your house is chilled. Have you been away?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No. I have been... I do not know where I have been, but I do not think I have come back yet.\x{201d} She sat down again, spread her hands to the fire. \x{201c}Why have you come? You must know by now that Tam is with Drede.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I came because you called.\x{201d}
    

    
      She stared up at him in amazement. He smiled, his chilled face taking color from the warmth, his lean hands cupping the blaze.
    

    
      \x{201c}I did not.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I heard you. Sometimes, in silence, at night, I hear the voices of things beyond eyesight, like echoes of ancient songs. I heard your voice, lonely in my dreams\x{2014}it woke me, so I came. You see, I know how it is when you speak a name into an empty room with no one on earth to answer to it.\x{201d}
    

    
      She was silent, her mouth open, wordless. He sat down beside her. Moriah rose leisurely, came to lie at their feet and stare at him out of green, inscrutable eyes. Sybel drew a breath and closed her mouth.
    

    
      \x{201c}I have never heard of such a thing. What are you? You are a fool in some ways, and yet you know other things that amaze me.\x{201d}
    

    
      He nodded, the smile tugging deeper at his mouth. \x{201c}The seventh son of Lord Steth of Sirle, my grandfather, had seven sons, and I am his youngest. Perhaps that is why I hear things the trees tell as their leaves whisper at moonrise, or the growing corn tells, or the birds at twilight. I have good ears. I heard the silence of your white walls even in the noisy halls at Sirle.\x{201d}
    

    
      She looked away from him to the fire. \x{201c}I see,\x{201d} she said softly. I did need someone but I did not know it until now. Are you hungry?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. But sit still a while, and when I get warm, I will cook something.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Can you cook?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Of course. I have been alone many times in lonely places with only the cry of a marsh bird or a hawk to answer me when I talked.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You have five brothers. Why would you need to go alone?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, they hunt with me. But when I need to travel to some forest or lake spoken of in an old tale, to listen to that secret place\x{2014}they cannot get excited about such things. Once I went to Mirkon Forest, the great black forest north of Sirle, with trees like black stone, and roots dark and swollen above the earth, and I listened to one single falling leaf and I heard the whisper of Prince Arn\x{2019}s name as it fell.\x{201d}
    

    
      A corner of her mouth went upward in her tired face. \x{201c}So Maelga used to tell Tam such tales at night, when he was little and troubled.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel, Rok mocks me when I tell him such things. And Eorth, who is a great, witless dragon, grins at me and hugs me until my bones crack. But I did not think you would laugh at me.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her dark eyes slid, hesitant, curious, to his face. \x{201c}I am not laughing at you. But it crossed my mind that you might have come, that your brother might have sent you, to see if I were pledged to help Drede, since I gave Tam to him. Drede\x{2014}Drede was a little afraid of me, because I called him here\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You called him?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes, but only to give Tam to him, nothing more. I did an unwise thing: I told him you had come here, too. So he is unsure of me, as now I think your brother Rok must be, too.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, yes.\x{201d} He smiled wryly, but his red brows were knit. \x{201c}Where was Cyrin or Gules to give you advice? You are wise in things beyond men\x{2019}s knowledge, but it was not wise to call a king insecure in his power, and draw him to you without his knowledge.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I told him he had nothing to fear from me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And that reassured him, I suppose.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I doubt it.\x{201d} Then she shook her head. \x{201c}Oh, but why should it matter to me what he thinks of me, or what the Lord of Sirle thinks. Did Rok have anything to do with your coming?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I told you why I came.\x{201d} His smile had gone, but his light eyes were steady on her face. She made a little, restless gesture.
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. But how you would hear my lonely voice above all the voices in Eldwold, I do not know.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I love you.\x{201d}
    

    
      She opened her mouth to reply, but found suddenly she was wordless. Coren watched, a touch of color on the high bones of his face; when she laughed finally, his face flamed.
    

    
      \x{201c}Well. Drede offered to make me Queen of Eldwold\x{2014}what have you to offer me?\x{201d} She folded her hands on her lap and looked up at him, and found his eyes shocked, ice-blue.
    

    
      \x{201c}Drede,\x{201d} he whispered. \x{201c}Drede.\x{201d} His clenched hands opened, closed on his knees. He drew a deep, soundless breath.
    

    
      \x{201c}Did you laugh like that at him?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No,\x{201d} she said, surprised, and he rose abruptly. She heard the circle of his restless steps on the stones behind her. Then they came back to her.
    

    
      \x{201c}I thought of you with your hair silver as snow all through that cold, slow journey from Sirle,\x{201d} he whispered. \x{201c}I felt you troubled, deep within me, and there was no other place in the world where I would rather have been than in the cold night, riding to you. When you opened your gates to me, I was home. I did not know you would hurt me so.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her lips parted as she heard the echo of her own words. Then she looked down at her taut, folded hands. \x{201c}I am sorry. But, Coren, I cannot\x{2014}I cannot trust you.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I see.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I\x{2014} When I look at you, I see the shadow of your hatred, the shadows of your brothers behind you, wanting me, wanting to use me. You must\x{2014}surely you must understand that.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her eyes flickered up to him. He stood motionless beside her chair, his face still, colorless. She shifted a little, uncertainly. Then she touched his arm.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sit down. We are both tired and hungry. I have not slept since Tam left, and I am tired of arguing.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel\x{2014}\x{201d} He stopped. He sat, not looking at her. He said after a moment, \x{201c}If I swore\x{2014}if I swore by my love for Norrel that I would never try to use you, or let anyone else use you against your will\x{2014}if I swore that, would you begin to trust me a little?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Could you swear that?\x{201d}
    

    
      He met her eyes and nodded. \x{201c}Yes. I will think of a way to kill Drede without involving anyone.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You will not!\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But, Sybel, what am I to do?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You have five other brothers\x{2014}be content with them.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will not! I cannot\x{2014}Sybel, Norrel\x{2014}when I was younger, and so unsure of myself, of my strange knowledge\x{2014}Norrel of all of them never laughed at me. I could tell him that in the Fyrbolg marshes I had seen the ghosts of men who died chasing the White Stag that the wizard Tarn had shaped out of smoke, and he would believe me. He would not understand, but he would believe me. He taught me how to ride, how to fight, how to hunt with a hawk. When he fell in love with Rianna, I fell in love with her, too, wanting her for him. When Drede killed him at Terbrec, I saw him fall. I could not\x{2014}I could not reach him in time, so he died with no one beside him at a battle that was fought for him. That is what I cannot forgive Drede: that Norrel died alone, without help, without comfort.\x{201d} His voice faded. A branch snapped in the fire; the wind murmured restlessly beyond the walls, moving in the darkness around her house like a beast seeking entrance. She said finally, haltingly,
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sorry. But Tam loves Drede. So\x{2014}I do not want Drede killed.\x{201d}
    

    
      She heard his slow, indrawn breath. \x{201c}So. Ice-white Lady, what shall I do? I cannot stop either my loving or my hating.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I do not know what you should do. I know nothing of hating, and only a little of loving. I wish\x{2014}I wish I could ease your sorrow, but I cannot.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You could. I think you could.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d}
    

    
      He sighed. Then his fingers dropped, curled gently over her folded hands, and she raised her head.
    

    
      \x{201c}It took a great love to give Tam to Drede. I hope he is happy with Drede, for his sake, and yours, though I cannot understand how Tam would prefer Drede to you.\x{201d}
    

    
      She smiled, the green light gleaming in her hair, on her weary face. \x{201c}Tam is drawn to people who need him.\x{201d} She paused. \x{201c}Surely\x{2014}surely there is some woman of your own world who has such a need of you. You are gifted, and kind, and\x{2014}very\x{2014}and pleasant to look at.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Thank you,\x{201d} he said gravely. \x{201c}Why is that so hard for you to say? It is so easy for me to say that you are wise, magical, honest, very beautiful to look at, and I love you.\x{201d} He touched a strand of her ivory hair. Then he shook his head quickly at her restless movement. \x{201c}I will not\x{2014}I will not trouble you with things you do not want to hear from me now. But if\x{2014}if you could give me something of friendship, it would ease me.\x{201d}
    

    
      She looked at him, her face opening a little to him. \x{201c}You came tonight, when I needed some kindness. For that, I am in your debt.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Good.\x{201d} He rose, put more wood on the fire, the flame dancing pale over his face. \x{201c}Sybel, your fire is the color of young trees... I will cook some supper now\x{2014} No, stay here. Trust me in your kitchen. Sleep a little, if you can.\x{201d}
    

    
      He left her quietly, and as quietly, Cyrin Boar rose from the shadows and followed him into the kitchen. Investigating, Coren discovered her knives, and pots, the loops of sausages on her rafters, new-made bread, and chilled vegetables from her garden. He stripped a carrot at the cutting board, and began slicing it. The great Boar remarked behind him in its golden voice,
    

    
      \x{201c}The trained falcon returns to its master\x{2019}s hand eventually.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren\x{2019}s knife slipped, struck hard at the cutting board. He turned. \x{201c}I had forgotten that the Lord of Wisdom had a voice to speak with.\x{201d}
    

    
      The small red eyes regarded him, unblinking. \x{201c}What would you give me for all the wisdom of the world?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Nothing.\x{201d} He turned back to his work. \x{201c}I have heard you know the answers to every riddle save one. That will be the one I need answering.\x{201d}
    

    
      Cyrin snorted gently. \x{201c}The wise man knows the riddle to ask it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And that the asking and answering are one.\x{201d} He swept the chopped carrot into a pot, and began peeling a potato. \x{201c}You mistrust me. I am no trained falcon bound by the leash of Rok\x{2019}s politics. He had nothing to do with my coming.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}When the Lord of Dorn received in secret from the witch Glower the death spell she made for his enemies, a shadow darker than night stood beside him, bound to him.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren was silent, slicing the hard potato into rings. He said finally, \x{201c}It is not to you I must prove I can love freely, but to Sybel.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Her eyes see clearly through darkness.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know. I have hidden nothing from her.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Roots are grown in darkness.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So they are.\x{201d} He inspected another, and peeled it. \x{201c}But I do not think, like a root grows, in secret.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}The giant Grof was hit in one eye by a stone, and that eye turned inward so that it looked into his mind, and he died of what he saw there.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren\x{2019}s head turned sharply. The silver-gray Boar stood panting mildly in the doorway.
    

    
      \x{201c}If that is a riddle, I do not know the answer.\x{201d}
    

    
      The sweet-mouthed Boar considered. \x{201c}Then I will tell you. Ask Sybel what name she spoke today before she spoke yours.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren\x{2019}s red, straight brows flicked into a frown. \x{201c}I will,\x{201d} he promised, and reached for a pale length of parsnip.
    

    
      He brought a rich soup and hot spiced sausage, thick-crusted bread and cups of heated wine to her, and found her sleeping, her hands limp in her lap. She half woke as he pulled a small table between their chairs, and he spoke her name gently.
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh.\x{201d} She straightened, rubbing her eyes with her fingers.
    

    
      He gave her wine. \x{201c}I am glad you slept a little.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It was good. I did not dream.\x{201d} She sipped wine, color returning to her face. \x{201c}Your soup smells like Maelga\x{2019}s.\x{201d}
    

    
      He served her, then sat down beside her with a bowl on his knees. \x{201c}You should not go so long without eating.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I forget to. Coren, this is good. I do not know which is warmer in me, your kindness or your soup.\x{201d}
    

    
      He smiled. \x{201c}It does not matter. Cyrin came to talk to me while I cooked.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her brows rose. \x{201c}He did? He speaks so rarely. What did he say?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He gave me a riddle. When I could not answer it, he told me to ask you what name you spoke today just before mine.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Why? Is that the answer?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I think so. Whose name was it?\x{201d}
    

    
      She thought, frowning. \x{201c}Oh. It was the Blammor\x{2019}s name, but I do not see\x{2014}\x{201d} She stopped abruptly, her eyes widening. Her voice flashed sharp with anger. \x{201c}Cyrin!\x{201d} Coren\x{2019}s plate crashed full at her feet as he rose.
    

    
      The Blammor appeared before them, the green flame dancing dimly through it. Its crystal eyes stared into Coren\x{2019}s, and he stood motionless, voiceless, his face the color of ice. Imperceptibly as a mist, the Blammor moved, lengthening, widening, until it hovered like a shadow over Coren, so close his bloodless face seemed smudged and limned with darkness. A sound broke from him, sharp, incoherent, and he swayed gently, as though he were held upright by a wind. Then Sybel, her hands clenched cold against her mouth, heard his whisper.
    

    
      \x{201c}Blammor...\x{201d}
    

    
      The Blammor turned its eyes to Sybel.
    

    
      Is there anything more? it asked indifferently, and she shook her head.
    

    
      \x{201c}No,\x{201d} she whispered. It melted away; the fire sprang, warm into her face.
    

    
      Coren\x{2019}s head dropped into his hands. He covered his hands with the heels of his palms, ground them against his eyes as though to rub away a vision. He fell, so suddenly she could not catch him; she knelt beside him, helped him sit.
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren\x{2014}\x{201d} He did not answer. She reached desperately for wine, and saw, watching beyond the circle of light, the red, imperturbed eyes of Cyrin. She sent the blaze of a furious cry into his mind.
    

    
      I would have sent him on his way\x{2014}there was no need\x{2014}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel\x{2014}\x{201d} Coren\x{2019}s voice came to her as from a deep place within him. She turned to him, her hands closing on his cold, taut fingers.
    

    
      \x{201c}I am here.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Hold me. Hold me tightly.\x{201d}
    

    
      She put her arms around him, held him so close she could feel the leap of his heart and the long shudderings of his breath.
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sorry. I am sorry,\x{201d} she whispered, and kissed him as though he were Tam come to her for comfort. Then a thought stirred in her mind, and she drew away from him. He murmured a protest, his hands dropping from his eyes to pull her back. She said sharply, \x{201c}Coren.\x{201d}
    

    
      He opened his eyes, dazed, as though he were coming out of a dream. \x{201c}What?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren, how did you know Rommalb\x{2019}s name?\x{201d} He gazed at her, his hands limp on her shoulders, his face drawn, white. She moved his hands, held them tightly as she sat with him on the floor. He said finally, \x{201c}I know it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But, Coren, how?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}How do I know anything?\x{201d} He leaned back against the stones, closing his eyes.
    

    
      \x{201c}But how?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I had to know.\x{201d} His words lay strengthless a moment between them. \x{201c}I would have died on your hearth,\x{201d} he whispered. \x{201c}I have been in one great battle, I have fought unexpectedly at night, alone, but I have never\x{2014}I have never before seen death come at me so certainly as at your hearth. It was the color of night, and I could not breathe because it was airless, and I knew\x{2014}I knew if I could find a name, put a name to it, it could not harm me. All my thoughts shouted of death\x{2014}flew in circles like frightened birds\x{2014}but I knew it could not be death, in your house, at your hearth. So a part of me searched for a name among all the ancient names I have known. Then I knew what it was. It was not death but fear. Rommalb. The fear men die of.\x{201d} He opened his eyes, looked at her from some nameless place. \x{201c}Sybel, I could not let myself die for something that could not harm me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Men have,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}Countless men, through countless years.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I could not. I had\x{2014}I had a thing I wanted to stay alive for.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Drede?\x{201d}
    

    
      He shook his head, said nothing for a long while, his eyes closed, until she thought he was sleeping. And then he straightened, leaned forward and kissed her. She drew back, her eyes wide, bewildered. \x{201c}I have never heard of anyone like you. I expected to see you mad or dead in my house, and then find your five brothers at my gates demanding to know why. Instead, you gave Rommalb back his name, and you turn away from death to come back and kiss me on my floor.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It seemed a better thing to do,\x{201d} he said, smiling, and then the terror of a memory froze the smile on his face, and his eyes emptied, chill as lost stars. He shook it away from him, and rose stiffly. Sybel helped him, her brows quirked worriedly.
    

    
      \x{201c}You have such terrible welcomes to my house. I will make Ogam\x{2019}s bed for you. And then I will make Cyrin into sausages.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No\x{2014}Sybel, he asked me a riddle, and I asked him for the answer to it. So he gave it to me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He tricked me into giving it. And there was no reason for him to treat you this way, a guest in my house, who came out of kindness.\x{201d}
    

    
      He sat down, then reached after a moment to pick up the pieces of broken bowl. \x{201c}If you cannot find a reason, I suppose there was none.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I cannot. Leave that, Coren; I will clean it, after you go to bed.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No. I will not sleep tonight in darkness. Let me sit here beside your fire. Sybel\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}What?\x{201d}
    

    
      He looked up at her. \x{201c}Are you afraid of nothing? What are you that Rommalb itself comes obedient to your call?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am afraid of some things. I was afraid for you, then. I am afraid for Tam. But I never thought to be afraid of Rommalb.\x{201d} She knelt to clean the spilled soup, and he watched the firelight pass glittering among the white strands of her hair until they blurred together and he fell asleep.
    

    
      She found him in the morning still sitting beside the fire, with Gules Lyon at his feet. The snow had stopped; the world was moon-colored beyond the ice-barred windows. A loaf of bread sat half-eaten on the table; the wine was gone. He smiled at her, his eyes red-rimmed, and she said gently,
    

    
      \x{201c}You did not sleep well?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I woke, and you had gone, so I did not sleep. Cyrin talked with me awhile; he told me tales.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I hope that is all he told you.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He told me of Prince Lud, who could have had any flower in the world he wanted, but he wanted only the flaming rose that grew on the Black Peak of Fyrbolg. And he got what he wanted and was content. So I still hope.\x{201d}
    

    
      Color rose about her eyes. \x{201c}I do not think any of this is Cyrin\x{2019}s business. Besides, you said yourself I am no flaming rose, but an ice flower, growing in a lifeless world. You belong in the world of the living, and there, I think, you will find your rose.\x{201d}
    

    
      He sighed. \x{201c}And you said, sometimes I am a fool. I think I am the one who has been living until now in a lifeless world. Sybel... last night I dreamed of Norrel. Always\x{2014}always before, when I dreamed of him, I never saw him as he was alive, but only as he lay dying, alone, feeling the death wound in him, seeing Drede turn away from him, trying to call, with no voice to call, no one to hear him\x{2014}I see him call me in my dreams, and he does not see me, and I cannot come to him. But last night, I fell asleep watching you clean the floor, and I dreamed of Norrel as he was alive, when we would talk together late at night. He was talking to me of Rianna, of his love for her. And I was smiling, listening, nodding, because I understood how he felt, what he was saying. I woke, still hearing his voice, and in the moment of my waking, I thought of Drede and I felt pity for him, because he could not have what Norrel had... Sybel, he is only an old, frightened man, with no one to love him but Tamlorn. And I thought he was like Rommalb, a death giver..\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Do you still want him dead?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I think\x{2014}I am tired of thinking about him.\x{201d} He rose, came to her, stood before her without touching her. \x{201c}I love you. When you need me again I will come.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No, Coren,\x{201d} she said helplessly, and found she had reached out to touch him. \x{201c}I am not good at loving. In all my life, I have only loved Maelga, Tam and Ogam, even though he was not very good at loving either. Stay in Sirle, where there are women who\x{2014}who can give you what you require. I belong here.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I require you,\x{201d} he said simply. He turned to get his cloak. \x{201c}When the Prince Rurin pursued the witch Glower for turning all his servants into pigs, she\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know. She thrust a great mountain of glass in his path that he could neither ride over or around. So he returned, defeated.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So,\x{201d} Coren said, and bent to kiss her unresponsive face farewell. \x{201c}What is the difference between glass and ice?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, go home,\x{201d} she said crossly, then laughed in spite of herself. She went to the gates with him to let him out. She stood shivering in the soundless morning, watching him ride down the mountain. The Boar Cyrin came to stand beside her, his warm breath blossoming in and out of the air. She looked down at him.
    

    
      \x{201c}That was a great chance you took,\x{201d} she said soberly. The silver-bristled Boar grunted his private note of laughter. He used with her, for the first time, his bell-sweet voice.
    

    
      \x{201c}One wise fool knows another.\x{201d}
    

    
      Tam came to visit her a few days later. She looked up from her reading to hear Ter\x{2019}s voice and see him circling her domed roof. She threw her cloak over her shoulders and hurried out, and he came to rest on her shoulder, just as Tam rode up to her gates with five men behind him. He slipped off his horse and shouted to her, and she saw his heavy, fur-lined cloak trimmed with gold thread and his soft boots and gloves with cuffs of fur. She opened the gates and he flung himself at her, laughing.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel, Sybel, Sybel\x{2014}\x{201d} He hugged her tightly, then whirled away. \x{201c}Look at my horse. My father chose him for me\x{2014}storm-gray, velvet-gray\x{2014}his name is Drede. He was afraid to let me come, but I begged and begged\x{2014}I cannot stay long, though\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, my Tam, I am glad to see you\x{2014} Come in.\x{201d} She looked into Ter\x{2019}s glittering eyes and asked, Is he well?
    

    
      The King is kind to him.
    

    
      Tam walked beside her, his footsteps deep in the snow, his face bright. \x{201c}Sybel, I am so happy to see you. Drede\x{2019}s palace is so big\x{2014}there are people everywhere\x{2014} Sybel, they are so courteous to me, because I am Drede\x{2019}s son. And I have such rich clothes. But I miss Gules Lyon and Nyl.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Is he good to you?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Of course. I am his protection against the Sirle Lords.\x{201d}
    

    
      She glanced at him, startled. He smiled, his eyes clear.
    

    
      \x{201c}You have grown a little, I think,\x{201d} she said.
    

    
      \x{201c}Drede says I am like you. But Sybel, he is very kind to me, and I am happy; when we are alone together, sometimes, doing simple things\x{2014}then sometimes he laughs.\x{201d} He opened the door. Moriah came to meet him, purring. He knelt down and rubbed his chilled face along her fur, then reached for Gules Lyon\x{2019}s mane and stared into the golden eyes. \x{201c}Gules,\x{201d} he whispered, \x{201c}Gules,\x{201d} and the deep throat rumbled. \x{201c}Do you know what I miss, too, Sybel? Your green fire. It is so beautiful.\x{201d} He shook snow from his cloak. She touched his pale, wet hair.
    

    
      \x{201c}You are growing,\x{201d} she said wonderingly, and he laughed, his voice deepening.
    

    
      \x{201c}I know. Sybel, he wanted me to bring you back with me, but I said I would only ask you\x{2014}I would not beg. I have asked you, and now we can talk about other things. Are the animals well?\x{201d}
    

    
      A smile trembled in her eyes. \x{201c}Very well,\x{201d} she said, and went to sit with him beside the hearth. \x{201c}Tell me now what you do every day.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh\x{2014}Sybel, I have never dreamed of so many people! We rode through the city on market day, and the people shouted my father\x{2019}s name\x{2014}and Sybel, they shouted mine, too\x{2014}Tamlorn\x{2014}and I was so surprised that my father laughed at me. I like to see him laugh.\x{201d}
    

    
      She let his voice run over her in a pleasant stream, soothing, comforting; she sat back, watching him, smiling, half listening. His face, bones forming, firming beneath it, lit and changed as he spoke, laughing, sobering, smiling again a clear, curious smile with a hint of secrecy behind it. Her thoughts melted apart; she let them lay strengthless as she had not done for days, and rested content in the warm green fire, and the white walls, and Tam beside her, long-boned, scratching the space between Moriah\x{2019}s black ears as he talked. Then something rippled, minute, distant, unbidden in the deep part of her mind. Tam touched her and she started.
    

    
      \x{201c}You are not listening. Sybel, I brought you a gift\x{2014}a cloak of white wool with blue flowers woven on it. Drede had some women make it for you.\x{201d} He paused a moment. \x{201c}What is the matter?\x{201d}
    

    
      She shook her head. \x{201c}Nothing. I am a little tired. A cloak? Tam, thank him for me. Is Ter behaving? I was afraid he might eat someone.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, no. We go hunting on still days. He is very polite with Drede\x{2019}s falcons, but he will let only me take him. Sybel\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      She did not answer him, feeling again the movement in her mind, faint and swift as the movement of a star through the <<midnight|13>> sky. Her hands tightened slowly on the arms of her chair.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel,\x{201d} Tam said. His brows flicked together. \x{201c}Do you hurt somewhere? You should talk to Maelga.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will.\x{201d} Her fingers loosened, stretched taut. Her eyes sought the fire, wide, black. \x{201c}I will,\x{201d} she whispered. Then a knocking sounded at the door and Tam\x{2019}s face changed.
    

    
      \x{201c}So soon? But I just came.\x{201d}
    

    
      She turned swiftly. \x{201c}Oh, my Tam\x{2014}not yet, surely\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I told you I could not stay long.\x{201d} He stood up, sighing. \x{201c}Sybel, when times are not so troubled, I will stay longer. I have your cloak in my saddlebag.\x{201d} The knocking sounded again; he raised his voice. \x{201c}I am coming! Sybel, talk to Maelga about what hurts you. She can cure everything.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Prince Tamlorn\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Coming!\x{201d} He put his arm around her as they walked across the yard, the guard following after them silently. Ter Falcon came to land again on Tam\x{2019}s shoulder. \x{201c}Sybel, I will stay longer next time. It\x{2014}I wish you would come to see me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Perhaps I will.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Please come.\x{201d} He unbuckled his saddlebag, and took out a soft, ivory cloak wound with whorls of blue thread. \x{201c}This is for you.\x{201d}
    

    
      She touched it. \x{201c}Oh, Tam, it is beautiful, so soft\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It is lined with ermine.\x{201d} He put it in her arms. Then he kissed her quickly. \x{201c}Please come. And talk to Maelga.\x{201d}
    

    
      She smiled. \x{201c}I will, my Tam. Now, may I say one word to Ter?\x{201d} Tam stood still a moment, and she looked from his gray, smiling eyes to Ter\x{2019}s blue, piercing gaze.
    

    
      Ter.
    

    
      What is it, Ogam\x{2019}s daughter? You are troubled.
    

    
      Tam watched her, saw her face go still a moment, her eyes black, lightless, piercing back at Ter\x{2019}s.
    

    
      There is someone calling me to him. Stop him.",

            "She went to see Maelga that afternoon. The white doves roosted on Maelga\x{2019}s rafters, and the raven came in and out through an open corner of window. The little house was thick with strange scents; Maelga bent murmuring over her cauldron, the steam of it loosening her white curls, plastering them glistening against her cheekbones. She did not look up as Sybel came in, so Sybel did not speak. She moved restlessly, opening and closing Maelga\x{2019}s books, peering at her jars of nameless things, pacing back and forth in the middle of the room, frowning, until Maelga\x{2019}s murmurings stopped abruptly, and she turned her head.
    

    
      \x{201c}My child,\x{201d} she said in wonderment. \x{201c}I am losing count of Things.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sorry,\x{201d} Sybel said. Something she held, worrying with her fingers, snapped; she stared down at it, unseeing. Maelga dropped her spoon in the cauldron.
    

    
      \x{201c}My bone\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}What bone?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}The forefinger of a wizard\x{2019}s right hand. It took me so many years to find one.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel blinked at the broken pieces in her hand. Then she said, \x{201c}I will bring you bones, if you wish. I will bring you a grinning skull, if I can find the brain beheath it.\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga\x{2019}s eyes focused, sharp beneath her untidy curls. \x{201c}What is it?\x{201d}
    

    
      She put the bone down, and her fingers closed tight on her arms. \x{201c}I am being called. I do not know who is calling me, but I cannot close my mind to him. I am being searched and called surely and skillfully as I would call an animal. I am angry, but so is a fish angry, caught on a line, and so helpless.\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga\x{2019}s hands clasped, her rings sparkling. She sat down slowly in her rocking chair. \x{201c}I knew it,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I knew you would get into trouble stealing those books.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel stopped midpace. \x{201c}Do you think it is only that?\x{201d} she said hopefully. Then she shook her head. \x{201c}No. There is a more powerful mind than mine at work. That frightens me. If he knows I have his books, he does not have to trouble me so for them. Maelga, I do not know what to do. There is no place to hide. If anyone came to do me harm, my animals would fight for me, but there is no one to fight this.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, dear,\x{201d} Maelga said. \x{201c}Oh, my dear.\x{201d} She rocked a little, one hand straying through her curls. Then she stopped. \x{201c}I can do one thing for you. I will send a raven with his black, searching eyes to peer into wizards\x{2019} windows.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel nodded. \x{201c}I have sent Ter looking, too.\x{201d} Then she sighed, covering her eyes with her open hands. \x{201c}I am a fool. If he can call me, he can call Ter, too\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}If he knows to call him.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. He may not know Ter. But who? Who is it! I have seen little wizards in their cold towers with straw pallets and dusty books; I have seen greater ones in lords\x{2019} courts growing fat and pompous with riches. But I have seen no one that I ever thought to fear. I do not know why I am being called.\x{201d} She stared helplessly at Maelga. \x{201c}What possible reason could there be? I can do nothing for anyone that strong.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Is he so strong? Perhaps if you do not answer he will yield.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Perhaps... But Maelga, he has broken into my silence, and I cannot follow his call. I cannot find him anywhere, to put a name to him.\x{201d} She resumed her restless pacing, arms folded, her hair drifting behind her like a white cloak. \x{201c}I am so angry... but anger is of no use, and neither is fear. I do not know what to do\x{2014}I can only hope he is not so strong he can take my name from me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Is there a place you can go away to for a while?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Where? I could go beyond the borders of Eldwold, and he could still seek me out, bring me to him.\x{201d} She sat down finally, despairingly, beside the fire. \x{201c}Oh, Maelga,\x{201d} she whispered, \x{201c}I do not know what to do. If I only had the Liralen... I could fly away to the end of the world... to the edge of the stars...\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Do not cry,\x{201d} Maelga said anxiously. \x{201c}You frighten me when you cry.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am not crying. Tears are of no use. There is nothing for me but waiting.\x{201d} She turned her head. \x{201c}Maelga, if\x{2014}if one day you cannot find me, and no one knows where I am, will you watch over my animals?\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga rose, her hands splayed in her hair. \x{201c}Oh, Sybel, it cannot come to that. My raven will find him. Ter will find him, and then I will make him such a thing that will dissolve the bones within his skin.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No, you must keep his finger bone...\x{201d} She rested her cheek against the stones of the fireplace and stared into the flames, seeing nothing as they danced beneath the black cauldron. She sighed. \x{201c}I will go and let you work. There is nothing you can do for me, and little I can do for myself. Perhaps Ter will find him before he finds me, and perhaps then I can do something.\x{201d} She rose. Maelga watched her, the lines of her face puckering into worry.
    

    
      \x{201c}My white one, be careful,\x{201d} she whispered.
    

    
      \x{201c}I will. I hope the one who is calling me has such a friend to give him that warning.\x{201d}
    

    
      She woke that night to the nudge in her mind, gentle as a fingertip stirring water. She sat straight in her bed, her eyes wide to the darkness, while above her the stars flung their icy patterns across the crystal dome. The nudge came again, an unbidden, formless thought, and she heard like a whisper in a motionless night, the faint, breathed call of her name.
    

    
      Sybel.
    

    
      A small cry broke from her in the darkness. She heard a movement by her bed; Gules\x{2019} golden eyes sparkled like cut stones.
    

    
      What is it you fear, Ogam\x{2019}s child?
    

    
      I had a dream...
    

    
      And the voice came again, a toneless murmur: Sybel.
    

    
      She spent a day and a night in the domed room, neither eating nor sleeping, searching ancient books for the name of such a powerful wizard, but she found no hint of it. At dawn, she let the book fall limp in her hands and stared out at the clearing sky. A line of rose traced the rim of the world; white clouds, silver-rimmed, blazing, caught the sun\x{2019}s rays, broke and scattered them over Fallow Field, over the Plain of Terbrec, across the walled city of Mondor, where they warmed the chill, dark walls and towers. She thought hopelessly of the Liralen with its bright, white wings, and called it a little, sending the call toward the white dawn world. The animals began to stir in the house. Then she heard Maelga\x{2019}s voice, calling at her door.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel! Sybel, wake up\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      She rose slowly, stiff, and went through the chill house. The sun streaked the snow with fire; it leaped at her eyes as she opened the door, hurting them. She blinked.
    

    
      \x{201c}Maelga. Come in.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, Sybel\x{2014}you have let your fire die.\x{201d} She stepped in, and Sybel stared at the dark thing in her hands.
    

    
      \x{201c}That is not the only dead thing in this room, I think.\x{201d} She touched the black, stiff body of Maelga\x{2019}s raven. A lightning stroke of fear she had never known before shot through her. Maelga said wearily, \x{201c}Sybel, I sent him out, and this morning he flew into my house and dropped dead at my feet. I think he was dead as he flew.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel shuddered. \x{201c}It is cold,\x{201d} she murmured. \x{201c}I am sorry.\x{201d} She stared down at the motionless bird until Maelga touched her gently, and she started.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel, you are tired. Have you eaten lately?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I do not think so. I have been reading.\x{201d} Her shoulders, strained taut, fell suddenly; she covered her face with her hands. Maelga\x{2019}s arms closed about her.
    

    
      \x{201c}My white child,\x{201d} she mourned, \x{201c}what can I do for you?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Nothing,\x{201d} Sybel whispered. \x{201c}Nothing.\x{201d} She dropped her hands, sighing. \x{201c}I hope Ter is safe. I will call him, send him back to Tam.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will cook you something. You are so thin since Tam left.\x{201d}
    

    
      She went into the kitchen, still carrying the dead raven. Sybel caught the Falcon\x{2019}s mind, felt the sudden sweep of earth beneath its flying.
    

    
      Ter. Go back to Tam. There is danger.
    

    
      There was silence a moment, before the drive of Ter\x{2019}s heartbeat and the run of fire in his veins. Then he said,
    

    
      No.
    

    
      Ter. Go back to Tam.
    

    
      Ogam\x{2019}s child, ask of me anything else. But I have a pair of eyes to pick and a dark mind to still.
    

    
      Ter\x{2014}
    

    
      She lost him suddenly, groped for him, amazed, and lost him again; and a whisper broke into her mind, strong, implacable.
    

    
      Sybel.
    

    
      \x{201c}No,\x{201d} she said, and the word fell lifeless against white stones. \x{201c}No!\x{201d}
    

    
      She sat under the domed roof at <<midnight|13>>, and the full moon watched her like an eye. The world lay silent beyond the dome, hushed and hidden; the mountain itself was still, the stars frozen like ice crystals. The night was voiceless as her own mind, resting in its heart of silence that no wind, no whisper of leaves disturbed. Her eyes were dark in the darkness, motionless as she waited, listening to the quiet of her mind, waiting for the moment, the calls that rippled to the core of its silence. Gules lay beside her, his head raised, golden eyes unblinking, motionless as though he did not breathe. She felt movement near her after a while and found Cyrin, the gleam of his tusks white as starlight.
    

    
      Answer me a riddle, Lord of Wisdom, she said to him, and in his mind heard the swift passage of all the riddles of the world. And his red eyes vanished as his great, glowing head sank before her.
    

    
      That one I cannot answer.
    

    
      Her head dropped onto her knees. \x{201c}I am weary,\x{201d} she whispered, wide-eyed, to the darkness. \x{201c}I do not know what to do.\x{201d} She sat there awhile, still, feeling now and then the faint tug of herself away from herself, like the soft withdrawal of a moon-drawn wave. The moonlight etched her shadow on the white marble floor, and the dark massive shadows of Boar and Lyon. She closed her eyes finally, sent forth a call. And as she called she heard a faint, familiar shouting at her gates.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel,\x{201d} Coren said, as she ran through the night snow to him. \x{201c}Sybel.\x{201d} His hands were closed tight on the bars as though he had tried to pull them apart. \x{201c}I am sorry\x{2014}I am so sorry\x{2014}I was away from Sirle\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I just called you,\x{201d} she said breathlessly, pulling at the frozen bolts. \x{201c}Just a moment ag\x{2014}-Coren, did you fly here?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I tried to.\x{201d} He led his horse in, stopped in front of her, trying to see her face in the dark. \x{201c}What is it?\x{201d} he said anxiously. \x{201c}Sybel, I wanted to come three days ago, but Rok had sent me to Hilt to talk to Lord Horst about some hopeless plan\x{2014}I knew you were troubled; I knew it even while I slept, but I could not leave until yesterday. What is it? Is it Tam?\x{201d}
    

    
      She stared up at his shadowed face, wordless. She shook her head. \x{201c}No. How\x{2014}how did you know I wanted you before I knew that?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I knew. Sybel, what is it? What can I do for you?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Just\x{2014}a little thing.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Anything.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Just\x{2014}hold me.\x{201d}
    

    
      He dropped the reins in the snow. He opened his cloak, drew her into it until it closed on her white hair, and the crown of her head gleamed faintly below his face. She dropped her head against him, smelled the dark, damp fur around her, felt the draw of Coren\x{2019}s breath and the beat of his blood. His breath caught, and she opened her eyes.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel\x{2014}you are afraid.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Hold me closer,\x{201d} she said, and his arms shifted around her, drew her nearer. She heard his heart beneath her ear, felt one gloved hand cupping her head. She drew a long, slow breath and loosed it. \x{201c}I would have called you all the way from Sirle to ask you to hold me like this. Just for this.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I would have come. I would have come only to do this and to go back. But Sybel, there must be more I can do for you.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No. Your voice is like the sunlight; it belongs to the world of men, not the dark world of wizards.\x{201d}
    

    
      His voice tangled in her hair. \x{201c}What is it? What is troubling you?\x{201d}
    

    
      She was silent. Then she lifted her head, sighing, drew away from him and the circle of his arms broke. \x{201c}I did not want to tell you. But now perhaps I should, because if anything happens to me, you\x{2014}you may be troubled until you know.\x{201d}
    

    
      His hands rose, creased with snow, to circle her face, and his voice rose. \x{201c}Sybel\x{2014}what?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Come in to the fire. I will tell you.\x{201d}
    

    
      She told him after he had stabled his horse in her shed and fed it. He hung up his cloak by the fire and sat beside her. She gave him a cup of heated wine and said simply,
    

    
      \x{201c}I am being called.\x{201d}
    

    
      He stared at her, over the rim of his cup. Then he put it down sharply, and the wine splashed over his forgers. \x{201c}Who?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}If I could put a name to him, I could fight him, perhaps. I have looked everywhere for a name to put to him; I have surprised wizards beyond Eldwold with the whisper of my voice in their minds, and their own fear and wonder have told me they do not know me. So now\x{2014}I do not know what to do. He has taken Ter Falcon; I sent Ter to look for him, and he stole Ter\x{2019}s name from me, and I could not hold Ter against his power. He is very strong. I think he is stronger than anyone I have ever heard of. So, I think, I will have to yield to him.\x{201d}
    

    
      He was silent, his brows twisted. \x{201c}I do not think,\x{201d} he said finally, \x{201c}that I will yield you to him.\x{201d}
    

    
      She shifted uneasily. \x{201c}Coren, that is not what I called you for. You cannot help me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I could try. I could not\x{2014}I could not help Norrel, but I will help you. I will stay here with you, and when he comes for you, or when you go to him, I will be there beside you, and he will answer to me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren, what good would that do? I would only have to watch you die, or watch your mind being twisted against itself so that you could never speak my name again. Rommalb was terrible, but not evil. Rommalb was fear, and you survived that, but this wizard, for you, would be death.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Then what shall I do?\x{201d} he demanded helplessly. \x{201c}Do you think I could sit here, or in Sirle, meek as a child while you are taken by some danger without a name?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Well, I will not watch you die in front of me.\x{201d} \x{201c}Well, I would rather do that than lie awake at night with your troubled mind tugging at me, and not know where you are, why you are troubled.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I never asked you to come uncalled when I was troubled. I never asked you to listen for my voice.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know: You never asked me to love you. Well, I do love you, and I am troubled, and I will stay with you no matter how much you argue. It is easy to call a man into your house, but not so easy to have him leave.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You are a true child of Sirle, to think every danger can be frightened away by an unsheathed sword. I thought you were wise, but you are stupid. Did you go to battle at Terbrec against Drede with a spell book in your hands? Well, then what good will it do you to meet a wizard in battle with a sword than can be turned against you with one word? When that wizard melts your sword into a pool at your feet, what will you do next?\x{201d}
    

    
      He was wordless, his mouth tight. Then suddenly, he shrugged. \x{201c}I am stupid to argue with you. Unless you can pick me up and throw me out, Sybel, here I stay. You may ignore me and walk over my feet, and refuse to feed me, but when you go I will follow you, and I will do my best to kill anything that harms you.\x{201d}
    

    
      She rose. She looked down at him, her black eyes distant, quiet, and as he met her eyes, he heard the faint stirrings about him of waking beasts. \x{201c}There is a way,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}to send you back to Sirle reluctant, but alive.\x{201d}
    

    
      Gules Lyon, yawning, its eyes of luminous gold, moved soundless as a shadow from the domed room, milled a circle around Coren, brushing restlessly against him. In the kitchen, Moriah, wakened, murmured a deep-throated song that had no words, melted leisurely toward them. Coren, his eyes on the still black eyes, saw them go momentarily lightless, and heard, in the soundless night, the slow pulse of great winds sucking against the air. He straightened, reached out to Sybel, his hand warm on her wrist, and her thoughts came back to him. He met her gaze, held it while the soft snort of Boar and suck of Dragon wing wove a frail web of sound burst by the Cat\x{2019}s sudden, full-throated scream of warning. Then he tugged at her a little, as though shaking her out of a dream.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel. Are you trying to make me afraid? Why do you not just go into my mind, as you went into Drede\x{2019}s mind, and send me quietly without my knowledge, back to Sirle? I could not argue with that.\x{201d}
    

    
      She stared at him a moment without answering. Then her face twisted, and she broke away from him. He rose quickly, caught her, and she dropped her face into her hands. \x{201c}I cannot,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}I want to, but I cannot.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Then what? If you set these animals at me, I will fight them, and they will be hurt, and so will I. And then we will both be angry with each other for letting such a thing happen. Sybel, it would be better for both of us, you and I, if you simply let me care about you. Let me keep my foolish watch here\x{2014}care enough for me to let me do that. It is the only thing I can do. Please. You owe me some kindness.\x{201d}
    

    
      She dropped her hands. The long fall of her hair hid her face; he could not see it in her silence. Then she shook it back, looked up at him, her eyes quiet, weary with waiting.
    

    
      \x{201c}I want you to go. For your sake I would tie you to Gyld and send you to Sirle, to Rok\x{2019}s doorstep. But for my sake, there is no place I want you but here. Will you go?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Of course not.\x{201d} He drew her close to him until her head dropped forward onto his breast, and he smiled vaguely at Gules Lyon, his lips brushing the top of her hair. She whispered against him,
    

    
      \x{201c}I am selfish. But Coren, this one thing I know, and I will tell you now: where I am going, in the end, I will go alone.\x{201d}
    

    
      She lay awake that night with Gules Lyon at the foot of her bed, and Moriah at her doorway, and the great, cold worlds of fire splayed silent above her head. She felt the steady pulse of the call in her mind, rippling through the silence, through the opened doors and corridors of it, moving downward, steadily, strongly, to the deep places where she kept the clear, cold knowledge of herself in her ground mind. The call moved inevitably toward that place, while her own powers ebbed away, her thoughts lay useless, unformed in her mind. Finally, there was nothing in her but that call, numbing her will, turning the white still house unfamiliar to her until it seemed the shadow of a dream. The deep, secret places of her mind lay open, unprotected; her power was measured, her name taken, all that her name meant: all experience, all instinct, all thought and power was measured and learned.
    

    
      She rose at a command that was scarcely more than a word, and dressed so softly that cloth barely whispered against cloth. A great, gold Lyon lay sleeping in the moonlight; a black Cat, nameless, stretched like a shadow across the threshold. She looked at them, found no names in her mind to wake them, for their names lay like jewels in a deep mountain, hidden from her mind\x{2019}s eye. She stepped over the sleeping Cat so gently its eyes did not flicker. In the room beyond, a red-haired man sat before a green flame, his eyes closed, his hands open, limp. She moved past him silent as a breath in the still room, past the silver-bristled Boar asleep at his feet.
    

    
      The door clicked softly, closing, and Coren started awake. He looked around, blinking. A twig snapped in the fire and he leaned back again, watching the dark room where Sybel slept guarded by Gules and Moriah. And as he watched, Sybel led his horse silently through the snow, out of her gates. She mounted and rode it bareback down the long, fire-white mountain path, past Maelga\x{2019}s sleeping house, down toward the dark, towered city of Mondor.",

            "She climbed the winding steps of a high tower on the north wall of the city. They spiraled into shadow above her, below her; her own shadow, shaped by torchlight, loomed before her up the worn stones. At the end a light limned a closed door. She gripped the heavy iron ring of its latch and opened it.
    

    
      \x{201c}Come in, Sybel.\x{201d}
    

    
      She walked into a round room. A canopy of woven stars glittered brilliant, motionless above her head; white wool and linen etched with ancient tales in rich threads hung from the walls, breathed gently over the high, thin windows. She stepped on soft sheepskin, ankle-deep, that lay the length of the room. A warm fire glowed in the middle of the room. Before it stood a tall man in a robe of black velvet with a silver belt of linked moons at his hips. He stood silently, watching her. His face was lean, hawk-lined, with no hint of feeling but for a single brief line curving faint beside a corner of his mouth. His eyes were cool, deep-shadowed green.
    

    
      \x{201c}Give me your name.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel.\x{201d}
    

    
      At the word the invisible thread of the call that had shadowed her mind broke, and she stood free, blinking in the room. She shivered a little, her eyes moving dark over the walls. The green eyes watched her, unmoved.
    

    
      \x{201c}Come to the fire. You have had a cold journey in the snow.\x{201d} He held out his hand, lean-boned, long-fingered, with a single jeweled ring on his forefinger the color of his eyes. \x{201c}Come,\x{201d} he said again, insistently, and she moved to the firebed slowly, unclasped her wet cloak.
    

    
      \x{201c}Who are you? What do you want with me?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}My name now is Mithran. I have called myself many things through the years. I have served princes in outlandish courts in many worlds; I serve them quietly and well\x{2014}if they are powerful. If they are not, I use them for my own purposes.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her eyes moved, black, to his face. \x{201c}Who do you serve now?\x{201d} she whispered. The line trembled, gossamer-faint, at the corner of his mouth.
    

    
      \x{201c}Until this moment I have been in service. But now, I think I might serve myself.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Whose service?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}A man who at once fears you and wants you.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her lips parted. The breath hissed through them, startled. \x{201c}Drede?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You are surprised. Why? You called him twice from his house, so skillfully he did not know what impulse moved him. He is fighting for his power in Eldwold, and the only weapon he has is his young son against the six sons of Sirle.
    

    
      \x{201c}I told him I would not meddle in their affairs! Why does he think I would go against him, the father of Tam?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Why not, when a red-haired Sirle lordling courts you with his sweet words? You have raised Tamlorn, but you have your own life to lead. You are powerful and\x{2014}beautiful as a rich line of poetry from an ancient, jewel-bound book. How can Drede be sure that an impulse will not move you to Coren?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren\x{2014}\x{201d} She covered her eyes with her fingers, feeling them cold. \x{201c}I told Drede\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You are not made of stone.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No. I am made of ice.\x{201d} She whirled away from the fire, stopped beside a gleaming table, her hands splayed on it. \x{201c}You know my mind. You know it better than any man alive. I have made difficult choices, but always my own freedom to use my power serving my own desires, harming no one, has been my first choice. Why can he not see that?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You loved Tam. Why can you not love Coren of Sirle? You are capable of love. It is a dangerous quality.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I do not love Coren!\x{201d}
    

    
      He stepped away from the fire toward her, his eyes unblinking, unreadable on her face. \x{201c}And Drede? Do you love him? He would make a queen of you.\x{201d}
    

    
      Blood rose in her face. She stared unseeing at goblets of moon-colored silver on the table. \x{201c}I was drawn to him a little... But I will not sit meekly beside him, dispensing my power as he sees fit, drawing Sirle to its doom\x{2014}I will not!\x{201d}
    

    
      The calm, sinewy voice pursued her, inflexible. \x{201c}I am paid to render you to him so meek.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her hands slipped from the wood. She turned to him, the blood slipping from her face, her eyes narrowed as though she were listening to words of a strange spell. \x{201c}Drede\x{2014}wants\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He wants you obedient to him. He wants you to know he can love you, trust you without question, as he can trust no one else in the world. He knows you somewhat. And he thinks there is but one way to achieve this. He hired me to do it.\x{201d}
    

    
      A fear such as she had never known began to stir deep in her, send chill, thin roots through her blood, her mind. \x{201c}How?\x{201d} she breathed, and felt tears run swift across her face.
    

    
      \x{201c}You know, I think. Sybel. How much that name means to you\x{2014}memory, knowledge, experience. There is not one possession more truly, irrevocably yours. Drede has hired me to take that name from you for a while, then give it back to another woman, who will smile and accept it, and then give to Drede, without question, forever, what he asks.\x{201d}
    

    
      A sound came out of her, so sharp and grating she did not recognize her voice. It came again; she slid to her knees on the skins, the hot tears catching between her fingers. She groped for breath, words wrenching from her, \x{201c}Help me\x{2014}I am torn out of myself\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Have you never wept so before? You are fortunate. It will pass.\x{201d}
    

    
      She caught the sobbing between her clenched teeth, her hands clenched on the wool. She turned her head, looked up at him, her face glittering in the firelight.
    

    
      \x{201c}Let me see him. I will\x{2014}I will do whatever he wants. Only do not take my will from me. I will marry him. I will walk meekly beside him\x{2014}only let me choose to do so!\x{201d}
    

    
      The green eyes gazed down at her, inscrutable. The wizard moved after a moment, stooped beside her. He touched her face; tears winked like stars on his fingertips.
    

    
      \x{201c}I wept so once...\x{201d} he whispered. \x{201c}Many years ago, even with the ashes of years of loving and hating cold in my heart. I wept at the flight of the Liralen and the knowledge that though I might have power over all the earth that one thing of flawless beauty was lost to me... I never thought another thing of such white beauty would fall into my keeping. The King requires that it pass from my hands to his... And he such a small man to tame such freedom...\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Will you let me talk to him?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}How could he trust you? He trusted Rianna once, and she betrayed him in secret. He wants no betrayal this time. He is afraid of you and jealous of Coren. Yet your face burned once under his hand, and the young prince loves you. So he would take you to him\x{2014}not powerless, but controlled.
    

    
      \x{201c}What is he paying you?\x{201d}
    

    
      The still eyes lined faintly in a smile. \x{201c}All this\x{2014}riches, leisurely hours in luxurious privacy, your animals, if I break the power of the Sirle family forever. I have not yet decided to do that.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Why is he not afraid of you?\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}I am.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Because when he first spoke to me, he had nothing else I wanted. Now, I am not sure of that.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}What else do you want?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Do you seek to buy your freedom from me?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I cannot buy it from you! You must give it freely, if at all, out of pity.\x{201d}
    

    
      He shook his head slowly from side to side. \x{201c}I have no pity. I have only awe of you... You have a powerful mind, lonely in its knowledge, for the experience of the mind is secret, unsharable. I have been in wastelands beneath the moon\x{2019}s eye, in rich lords\x{2019} courts with the sound of pipe and heartbeat of drum... I have been in high mountains, in hot, small witches\x{2019} huts watching their mad eyes and fire-burned faces; I have spoken with the owl and the snow-white falcon and the black crow; I have spoken to the fools that dwell by thousands in crowded cities, men and women; I have spoken to cool-voiced queens. But never in all my wanderings did I dream there existed one such as you...\x{201d} His hand lifted, the ringed finger touching a strand of her hair. She drew back a little, her eyes wide on his face.
    

    
      \x{201c}Please. Let me talk to Drede.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Perhaps...\x{201d} He rose, stepped away from her. \x{201c}Get up. Take your wet cloak off and warm yourself. I have hot food and wine. There is a bed for you with rich hangings behind that curtain and something else that belongs to you.\x{201d}
    

    
      She got up slowly, and drew back the white curtain. Ter Falcon perched on a stand of gold; his glittering eyes stared at her indifferently. She groped for his mind, speaking his name silently, but nothing of him answered her, and he did not move. She turned wearily.
    

    
      \x{201c}You are strong, Mithran... It is strange that I should be here at your mercy because I chose to love a helpless baby twelve years ago. I am afraid of you and Drede, but fear will not save me, and I do not think anything might save me except you.\x{201d}
    

    
      The black-robed wizard poured her wine. At the windows, the curtains were growing pale with morning. \x{201c}I told you, I have no pity. Eat. Then rest awhile, and I will bring Drede to you. Perhaps he has some pity left in him, but a man afraid in the core of his mind has little room for compassion.\x{201d}
    

    
      Drede came at <<noon|13>>. The draw of the bolt on the door woke Sybel; she heard his low voice.
    

    
      \x{201c}Is it done?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I told you I did not wish to speak to her until it was done!\x{201d}
    

    
      The wizard\x{2019}s voice came, cold. \x{201c}I have never done this before. It goes against me. You will flaw her beyond repair; she will be beautiful, docile, powerful only at your command.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You told her that\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. It is nothing. She will forget. But she wished to speak to you\x{2014}beg you\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will not listen!\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I have told you: I have turned against myself to do this thing. If I must bear the guilt for it, so must you, or I will not do it.\x{201d}
    

    
      Drede was silent. Sybel rose and drew back the curtain. The King\x{2019}s eyes leaped to her face; she saw shame in them, torment, and beneath them the icy glaze of fear. She stood still a moment, her hand on the curtain. Then she went to him and knelt at his feet.
    

    
      \x{201c}Please,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}Please. I will do whatever you ask. I will marry you. I will put the Sirle Lords under your power. I will raise Tam, and I will bear you sons. I will never argue with you; I will obey you without question. But do not let him take my will from me. Do not let him change my mind. It is a terrible thing, more terrible than if you killed me here, now. I would rather you do that. There is a part of me, like a white-winged falcon, free, proud, wild, a soaring thing that goes its own way seeking the bright stars and the sun. If you kill that white bird, I will be earthbound, bound in the patterns of men, with no words of my own, no actions of my own. I will take that bird for you, cage it. Only let it live.\x{201d}
    

    
      Drede lifted one hand, covered his eyes. Then he knelt before Sybel and took her hands in his hands, holding them tightly. \x{201c}Sybel, I am helpless in this matter. I want you, but I am afraid of you\x{2014}afraid of that white bird.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I promise\x{2014}I promise\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No, listen to me. I have been\x{2014}I have lived afraid always of those I hold in power. I have been threatened by my lords, betrayed by those I loved, until there is no one I can speak the truth to without being afraid. My own people, the ones I should trust, I look into their eyes, their secret, expressionless eyes, and I suspect them, I fear their treachery. I am alone. Tamlorn is the one thing in this world I trust and love. You, I could love, and perhaps trust, but I must be certain of you, Sybel.\x{201d}
    

    
      She said, her mouth dry, \x{201c}You\x{2014}cannot ever be certain of those you love\x{2014}that they will not hurt you, even loving you. But to make me certain to love you, will be to take away any love I might give you freely. That white bird\x{2019}s name is Sybel. If you kill it, I will die and a ghost will look out of my eyes. Trust me. Let me live, and trust me.\x{201d}
    

    
      His eyes closed, tightening. \x{201c}I cannot\x{2014}I trusted Rianna, and she betrayed me, smiling. She smiled at me, and kissed my palm, and betrayed me for a blue-eyed Sirle lordling. And you\x{2014}you would marry me, and turn to Coren\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No!\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But how could I be sure? How? One day he would walk smiling into your garden, and you would smile back, and all your promises to me would scatter like leaves on the wind.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No\x{2014} You are talking of Rianna, not me\x{2014}I have nothing to do with Rianna and Norrel! Let me go! Please let me go! I will go back to my white hall, and this wizard can put a wall around it that I will never cross. I will leave Eldwold! I will do anything\x{2014}anything\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      His words came whispered through his teeth. \x{201c}Sybel, I dream of you at nights, and I wake alone and weep. It will be done swiftly, and then you will be with Tamlorn\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      He loosed her, rising, his hands clenched. \x{201c}It will be done!\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So,\x{201d} she whispered, trembling, her eyes dry, unseeing. \x{201c}I am never to love again. That is harsh, considering that I am the first of three wizards to learn how. I would like to kill myself, but I will not be permitted to make even that small choice. I hope you pay this wizard well, because this deed is without price and without parallel.\x{201d}
    

    
      He stood a moment wordless before her. Then he turned, and she heard the whisper of his steps across the sheepskin, and then the beat of them down stone steps. The door closed, the bolt shot, and at the sound she gave a frightened, hopeless cry.
    

    
      \x{201c}Get up, Sybel.\x{201d}
    

    
      She rose unsteadily. Mithran went to the table, poured wine. He gave her a cup and sat down, sipping, watching her across the rim of his goblet.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sit down.\x{201d}
    

    
      She sat. She whispered into the cup, \x{201c}Give me a few minutes of freedom.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}To take yourself out of this world forever? No, you are too valuable.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Leave one small place for freedom in my mind.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}To love?\x{201d}
    

    
      She lifted her eyes. \x{201c}To hate,\x{201d} she whispered. Her fingers circled the cup, kneading the wrought silver. \x{201c}In that one small corner I could breed such a hate that would tear Eldwold apart stone by stone, and leave a wasteland for the Sirle Lords to bicker over for centuries. I would bring that King to his knees as he brought me to mine.\x{201d}
    

    
      The green eyes watched her, unwavering. \x{201c}And what of me? Do you hate me?\x{201d}
    

    
      Her eyes moved lifeless to his face. \x{201c}You are beneath hatred.\x{201d}
    

    
      He leaned forward, the ring on his finger flashing darkly. His mouth tightened suddenly. \x{201c}He is a fool, that King. More so than most men. Did you know that you stole a book from me once?\x{201d}
    

    
      She blinked. \x{201c}No. I would remember you.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}The spell book of the wizard Firnan. You thought the room was empty. A lonely, cold room in a small lord\x{2019}s court near Fyrbolg. I was there. I watched you enter, silently, as though the air had formed you. You looked through my books, took that one, and left so silently... and I watched that place in midair for hours after you went. I did not know your name. I did not know even if you belonged to Eldwold. I only knew that you came before me like the answer to a dream that I had not even dared dream... So I began to listen, to ask a question here and there, and I began to learn of you...\x{201d}
    

    
      She stared at him wonderingly. \x{201c}But why did you call me for Drede?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It is he who told me at last who to call. You see, I am no fool. If I had come to you in your mountain house, you could have said yes to me as easily as no. Today, though, I think there is only one answer you will give me. I want you. If I must take you by force, I will, though with such a choice that you face today, I doubt that you will argue. I am powerful; my knowledge is inexhaustible. I have both loved and hated, but for years I have found nothing worth either loving or hating until I saw you. I can share thoughts, experiences with you as I can with no one else. I loved a woman once for her beauty. I never thought I might want to again. It is as though\x{2014}as though you were made for me.\x{201d}
    

    
      She stared at him numbly. She began to tremble again; she held herself, her fingers tight, cold on her arms. He said,
    

    
      \x{201c}Drink.\x{201d}
    

    
      She drank wine. She leaned forward, dropped her head on her arms. Mithran watched her, motionless.
    

    
      \x{201c}Well?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}This is my fault, a little,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}Maelga warned me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Look at me.\x{201d}
    

    
      She raised her head, her eyes wide, mute on his face. His thin brows flickered a little, drawing together. \x{201c}Does it require such thought?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am not even thinking. There is only emptiness.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel. Choose.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I do not care. I do not care! You choose! If you want me, then keep me\x{2014}if not, give me to Drede. What do you want me to do? Thank you for giving me a place in the wasteland of your heart? Drede at least I understand, but you\x{2014}you are colder than I am.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Am I so?\x{201d} he breathed. He checked himself, his thin mouth tightening again at the corners. \x{201c}White bird, you know I will never give you to that King. Nor will I break your mind to suit either him or me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You have already broken it!\x{201d} she cried. \x{201c}White bird\x{2014}white falcon on a silver thread, to come when you call\x{2014}I would fear you until I died, you have such power over my slightest thought. So I do not care now what you do to me. Do you want me to beg you to save me from Drede? I will go down on my knees to you for that, but I can never give you thanks for it if I am shackled to you.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You could not\x{2014}try to love me?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I love no one! I will never love anyone! So Drede will have me helpless and smiling, or you will have me helpless and afraid\x{2014}which do you prefer?\x{201d}
    

    
      He sat silently a moment, a finger moving up and down his cup, while she watched him, her hands tight on the arms of her chair. He said softly, his words measured to the slow movement of his hand, \x{201c}You will not always fear me, Sybel. I will show you ancient arts and spells even you have never dreamed of learning. I will give you wondrous things: the purple jewel the shape of an eye made by the witch woman Catha that sees into locked doors and boxes; the cloak made of the skins of the blue mountain cats of Lomar, soft as the whisper of breath, warm as the touch of a mouth...I will give you the locked, bound books of the wizard Erden, never opened since his death three centuries ago, and I will tell you how to open them...\x{201d} His words formed like dreams in her mind; she felt herself lulled, her mind eased, darkened. \x{201c}I will capture for you the winged gazelle of the Southern Deserts, with eyes like the luminous night... You will sleep in white wool and purple silk, and wear jewels the color of stars with red and blue fire in their midst...\x{201d} As from far away she saw him rise slowly, shadow-silent, come toward her, his voice low, weaving visions for her that formed and rested in her numbed mind. She felt his fingers straying through her hair. \x{201c}I will give you the silver-stringed harp of the Lord Thrace of Tol, that plays at command, sings lost tales of dead, glorious kings...\x{201d} His breath whispered against her face. A cry rose in her somewhere, faint as a child\x{2019}s cry in the night that faded, lost. She felt his hands at her throat, saw the silver circle of her brooch wink and tremble in the light. \x{201c}I will give you the Cup of Fortune that was thrown by the Prince Verne into the Lost Lake because it foretold his death by water...\x{201d} She felt cloth gathered, tense, in his fingers, heard the hiss of it, torn. She heard the breath shake, faintly between his lips. \x{201c}I will give you all the treasures of the world, and all its secrets... Sybel, my white bird...\x{201d} His head dropped. His lips touched her throat, brushed downward. And then she felt that in his quickening lust for one brief moment he lost her, and she whispered one word without hope, almost without thought.
    

    
      His head jerked upward, his eyes blazing into hers. He whirled away from her abruptly, and found as he turned the crystal-eyed Blammor behind him. He screamed once, and then the Blammor overwhelmed him like a mist that held him upright an instant, his arms outspread, fingers taut. Then he dropped. The Blammor said to Sybel,
    

    
      Is there more?
    

    
      She stared, trembling, at the wizard. Her hands fumbled at her robe, drawing the torn cloth together. No, she said. No more. And it faded. Beside the bed the Falcon Ter gave a fierce cry of rage. The wizard Mithran lay on his back, the bones crushed and broken in his face, his hands, his throat. Ter swooped downward, clung to the broken head, his talons piercing the open eyes.
    

    
      \x{201c}Ter,\x{201d} Sybel breathed, and he came to her, perched on her chair. She stood, still trembling, and drew on her cloak. Ter\x{2019}s voice floated into her mind; she felt him in his hot rage.
    

    
      And Drede.
    

    
      No.
    

    
      Drede.
    

    
      No. She went to the door, pulled the bolt with shaking hands. Drede is mine.",

            '[12:00] The Forgotten Beasts of Eld - Patricia A. McKillip.epub (OEBPS/Text/The_Forgotten_Beasts_of_Eld_split_014.html) - noon',
            "They sat late with Rok, Ceneth and Eorth, until the great hall quieted and the dogs had gone to sleep at their feet. Coren told of their meeting with Tam and Drede\x{2019}s guards, and Rok listened silently, whirling a wine cup slowly between forefinger and thumb. Me grunted when Coren finished.
    

    
      \x{201c}The boy is soft, yet. I wonder what Drede himself would have done.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He would have done what I wanted him to,\x{201d} Sybel said. Rok\x{2019}s tawny eyes flicked to her face.
    

    
      \x{201c}Could you have controlled all of them?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No. They could have overwhelmed us, but it would not have been a pleasant encounter for them.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But you could control the King.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Rok,\x{201d} Corers murmured, and Rok\x{2019}s eyes dropped. He leaned back in his chair.
    

    
      \x{201c}Well. I am thankful you are safe. It was foolish of me to think of you for a moment as simply a man and his wife who could move safely as children through Eldwold, and to let you go alone.\x{201d}
    

    
      Cores shrugged. \x{201c}It was best that you did. There would have been a small war in Sybel\x{2019}s house if Eorth and Herne had been with us, and we would all be licking our wounds in Mondor by now, including the animals. Besides, even if Eorth had kept his temper, he probably would have broken his neck falling off Gyld on the way home.\x{201d}
    

    
      Eorth refilled his cup. \x{201c}At least, I would have had enough sense not to let myself get trapped in a corner by three of Drede\x{2019}s men. They must have made enough noise riding up the hill to warn you.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren flushed. \x{201c}I know,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I should have heard them. I was distracted. Cyrin was telling me about the time he met the witch Carodin in her doorless tower and answered six out of her seven riddles and discovered even she could not answer the seventh.\x{201d}
    

    
      Eorth looked at him bewilderedly. \x{201c}A Boar told you all that?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He talks.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, Coren, you have told us ridiculous things, but\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It is not ridiculous. It is true. Eorth, you never could see farther than the sword in your hand\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Well, that is as far as any man needs to see in this land.\x{201d} He appealed to Sybel. \x{201c}Is he lying?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He never lies.\x{201d}
    

    
      He looked at her incredulously. Rok said, with a grunt of laughter, \x{201c}Eorth, do not start a fight on my hearth. I never would have believed Coren would ride a Dragon to my doorstep, but he did and I do, now. And I am also beginning to think twice about other things he has said.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren reached across the table for Sybel\x{2019}s hand. \x{201c}You see what a poor reputation I had before you married me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So. You married me for my animals. I always knew it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I married you because you never laughed at me. Except when I asked you to marry me.\x{201d}
    

    
      Eorth leaned back in his chair and grinned. \x{201c}She laughed? Tell us about that, Coren.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I laughed because I thought you had sent him to marry me,\x{201d} Sybel said. \x{201c}Then, when I realized he loved me, I stopped laughing.\x{201d}
    

    
      Ceneth rose, moved to the fire. The great house was still about them; shadows fell like tapestry from the walls.
    

    
      \x{201c}If you are not careful, Eorth, Sybel will have Gyld leave you naked on top of Eld Mountain and no one will miss you.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sorry.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You are not. You are jealous that you did not marry a woman with a dragon.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Now we have one in our wine cellar,\x{201d} Rok murmured. \x{201c}I wonder what our father would have said about that.\x{201d}
    

    
      Eorth gave a snort of laughter. \x{201c}He would have quit drinking. I thought of something a moment ago.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Did you?\x{201d} Ceneth said wonderingly. \x{201c}What?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}That if Sybel had a daughter, she could marry Tamlorn, control him, and in two generations the Sirle Lords could be Eldwold Kings.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I hardly think Tam would wait fifteen years to get married,\x{201d} Rok said dryly.
    

    
      \x{201c}He could marry into Sirle anyway,\x{201d} Ceneth said. \x{201c}Herne\x{2019}s daughter Vivet is twelve in summer.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Drede would never permit it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So? The boy could melt Drede like wax.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And who in Sirle is to melt Tam to this plan?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel, of course.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren\x{2019}s hand came down sharply on the table. The wine quivered in their cups. He looked at the three silent men: Rok, big, gold-maned; Ceneth with his sleek black hair and cat-calm eyes; Eorth, slow, and leaf-bright and powerful. He lifted his hand from the table and closed it. Eorth said, flushed,
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sorry. I was babbling.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}We all were.\x{201d} Ceneth troubled the fire a moment with his foot. Then he turned, dropped a hand on Coren\x{2019}s shoulder. \x{201c}It will not happen again.\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren sighed, his face loosening. \x{201c}Yes, it will. I know this house. And I know what talk is worth these days. Like a dragon flight, it comes to nothing in the end but sleep.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Harsh, but true,\x{201d} Rok said. They were silent awhile. The fire dwindled to a single flame that danced above the embers. Eorth yawned, his teeth winking white as Moriah\x{2019}s.
    

    
      \x{201c}It is late,\x{201d} he said surprisedly. Ceneth nodded.
    

    
      \x{201c}I am going to bed.\x{201d} He stopped beside Sybel, took her hand and kissed it. \x{201c}Lady, be patient with us.\x{201d}
    

    
      She smiled up at him. \x{201c}You make it easy to be patient.\x{201d}
    

    
      He left them. They sat finishing their wine, while the shadows lengthened and locked over their heads. Coren put his empty cup down, swallowing a yawn.
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren, go to bed,\x{201d} Sybel said. \x{201c}You look tired.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Come with me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}In a moment. I want to talk to Rok about Gyld.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Always Rok. I will wait.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And then I want a bath.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh.\x{201d} He pushed his chair back and leaned across the table to kiss the top of her head. \x{201c}Do not keep Rok up too long. He is an old man and needs his sleep.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Old\x{2014} At least I am not getting so slow and deaf I am easy game to any fool in Drede\x{2019}s service.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Three fools,\x{201d} Coren said. \x{201c}It took three. Good night.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Good night,\x{201d} Rok said. Beside him, Eorth\x{2019}s head drooped, his cup dangling empty from his hands. Rok took it from him and set it on the table. \x{201c}Eorth.\x{201d} He began to snore softly. Rok turned away from him, his mouth crooked.
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sorry if we troubled you tonight. Coren is right, though: since Drede stopped us at Terbrec, we talk a good deal and do little.\x{201d} He paused a moment. \x{201c}What is it you wanted to tell me?\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel\x{2019}s eyes lifted to his face. The hall was dim around them but for the flame of a last torch; Eorth\x{2019}s snoring sounded weak against the great rising of silent, ancient stone. She leaned toward Rok, her eyes dark, unwavering on his face as the black, moonlit pools of Fyrbolg.
    

    
      \x{201c}Something,\x{201d} she said finally, \x{201c}that I have never told any man.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok was silent. Eorth was silent, too, a moment; he caught a sudden breath midsnore and woke himself up, blinking at them.
    

    
      \x{201c}Eorth, go to bed,\x{201d} Rok said impatiently, and Eorth heaved himself to his feet.
    

    
      \x{201c}All right.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok watched him go. Then he turned back to Sybel, his eyes narrowed.
    

    
      \x{201c}Tell me.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel folded her hands on the table. \x{201c}Did Coren tell you about the wizard who called me?\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok nodded. \x{201c}He said you had been captured\x{2014}called\x{2014}by a very powerful wizard who was attracted to you, and that the wizard died and you came back free. He did not tell me how the wizard died.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Let that be for a moment. What Coren does not know is that the wizard was paid by Drede to take me, and to make me\x{2014}obedient to Drede, so that Drede could marry me without fearing me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}How\x{2014}obedient?\x{201d}
    

    
      Her mouth twitched a little, steadied. \x{201c}He was paid to destroy a part of my mind, the part that chooses and wills of its own. I would have retained most of my powers, but they would have been subject to Drede. I was to be made\x{2014}content with Drede.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok\x{2019}s lips parted. \x{201c}Could he have done that?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. He held\x{2014}he held my mind so completely, more completely than any man holds his own mind. I would have been controlled by Drede; I would have done whatever he wanted without question or hope of question, and I would have been happy, afterward, that I had pleased Drede. That, Drede wanted.\x{201d} Her taut hands loosened; one lifted, cut the air. \x{201c}For that, I will destroy him.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok sat back in his chair, the breath easing from him soundlessly. \x{201c}Is that why you married Coren?\x{201d} he asked suddenly. \x{201c}As part of your revenge?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{2019}Yes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You do not love him?\x{201d} he asked almost wistfully.
    

    
      \x{201c}I love him.\x{201d} Her hands eased apart then. \x{201c}I love him,\x{201d} she repeated softly. \x{201c}He is kind and good and wise, all those things I am not, and if I lost him, I would hunger for those things in him. For that reason, I do not want him to know what is\x{2014}what is in my heart. He might hate me for this. I do not\x{2014}I do not like myself so much these days. But I want Drede to suffer. I want him to know what dread and hopelessness I knew. He is learning a little of it now. Tam said he is beginning to be afraid, and with good reason. I want war between Sirle and Drede, and I want Drede powerless. I will help you under two conditions.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Name them,\x{201d} Rok breathed.
    

    
      \x{201c}That Coren will not know I am involved. And that Tam is not used in any way against Drede. For that, I will call the Lords of Niccon and Hilt to side with you against Drede; I will use my own animals against Drede, and I will give you a king\x{2019}s treasure for the gathering and arming of men.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok gazed at her wordlessly. She saw the muscles of his throat move as he swallowed. \x{201c}You yourself are a dream come true, Lady,\x{201d} he whispered. \x{201c}Where will you get the treasure?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}From Gyld. He has amassed enough gold through the centuries to arm every man and child in Eldwold. If I ask him, he will give me part of it. You see, Ter was captured, too, that day, and he watched powerless himself, while Drede and Mithran spoke of their plan. When I came to Eld Mountain today, every animal there knew what had been done to us.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But how did you escape that wizard, if he was so powerful?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Rommalb killed him.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Rommalb\x{2014}\x{201d} She saw the memories flick in his eyes. \x{201c}The nightwalker\x{2014} How?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He\x{2014}crushed him.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok\x{2019}s face was shocked, motionless in the firelight. \x{201c}That is what Coren met on your hearth?\x{201d}
    

    
      She nodded. \x{201c}It was not a pleasant meeting, but Coren did what\x{2014}what few men have ever done.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}What?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He survived.\x{201d} She stirred, her hands stretching taut on the table. \x{201c}I never meant for that to happen; it was Cyrin\x{2019}s doing, and I was terrified. But Coren is wiser than I dreamed he could be.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So he must be\x{2014}wiser than we all dreamed. Why do you not set this Rommalb at Drede?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Because I want a slow revenge. I want him to know what is being done to him and why, and who is responsible. The things he fears most in the world are the power and energy of Sirle, and me. He came to Mithran\x{2019}s tower that day expecting to find a woman who would smile and take his hand and do his bidding. Instead he found that woman gone and a great wizard lying broken on the floor. Since that day he has been afraid. Now, with your help, I will overwhelm him with his fears.\x{201d}
    

    
      His head moved slowly from side to side. \x{201c}You are merciless.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. If you choose to refuse me, I will go to bed and we will never speak of this again. But with or without Sirle, it will be done.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You have such things involved with this\x{2014}Coren\x{2019}s love, Tamlorn\x{2019}s. Do you want to risk them?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I have thought deep in the night, night after night, about this plan. I know the risks. I know that if Coren finds out how I have used him, or if Tam suspects that I am destroying his father, they will be hurt past bearing, and I will lose all that I value in this world. But I told you tonight what I have decided.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Are you sure?\x{201d}
    

    
      She held his eyes. \x{201c}It will be done.\x{201d}
    

    
      He drew a soft breath and loosed it. \x{201c}I think it will be done with Sirle.\x{201d}
    

    
      The building of the gardens for the animals began with the softening of the earth in spring and progressed into the long summer. One by one Sybel called the animals to Sirle: first the Black Swan to take its place in a small, glass-clear lake filled with smooth stones and fire-bright fish. She went to meet it as it descended slowly over the garden, and came to glide without a ripple, night-black and regal, over the still waters. Its voice ran smooth, melodious through her thoughts.
    

    
      It is small, but pleasing.
    

    
      Rok, said Sybel, is going to have a white fountain put in the middle.
    

    
      The shape, Sybel?
    

    
      Two swans in flight, soaring upward, with their beaks touching.
    

    
      Yes. And that matter concerning you?
    

    
      It will be settled. Soon.
    

    
      I am in readiness, when you have need of me.
    

    
      She called Gyld from his corner in the dark, damp wine cellar and he fell asleep again in a grotto shaded by trees, cooled by a vein of the Slinoon trained beneath the wall that danced past his cave into the Swan\x{2019}s lake. Jewels, cups and gold pieces past value winked dully in the shadows around him, for he had given Sybel the path to his mountain cave, and Rok had sent Eorth, Bor and Herne secretly to bring his gold. They had returned, three days after he sent them, exhausted, overladen and awestricken.
    

    
      \x{201c}We could not bring it all,\x{201d} Bor said to Rok and Sybel. He rubbed his weary eyes as though at a vision for which there were no words. \x{201c}Rok, we waded ankle-deep in places through silver pieces. There were the bones of three dead men, and one wore a king\x{2019}s crown. And that is the beast we put so blithely into our wine cellar.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You have nothing to fear from him,\x{201d} Sybel said. \x{201c}He is old, and he wants nothing now but his dreams, and his gold securely about him. He is pleased with his cave.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You could buy a kingdom with that gold,\x{201d} Herne said, his blue eyes gleaming in his arched, restless face. A corner of Rok\x{2019}s mouth lifted faintly.
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
    

    
      She called the Lyon and the great, green-eyed Cat next, and they came by night, gleaming, velvet beneath the moonlight across the Sirle fields. Sybel met them at the gate, opened it for them, and they passed through softly into the garden, the grass whispering beneath them, the blossoming trees white and still against the night sky.
    

    
      By winter there will be a warm place built for you, she said. I will miss you wandering in and out of my rooms. Perhaps by winter they will learn not to fear you. This place is small, but it is private and no one should disturb you.
    

    
      Gules Lyon lay down in the long grass at her feet. Moriah prowled soft as a shadow through the night, while the Black Swan drifted drowsing through moon-shot waters.
    

    
      The Lord of Sirle has done much for you, White One, said Gules. Have you spoken to him yet?
    

    
      Yes. I offered him Eldwold. He accepted.
    

    
      Gules gave a rumble, deep in his throat. Good.
    

    
      Coren came to see them the next morning. He brought his brothers; they stood together silently, watching Gules tear open the haunch of a deer Coren had shot for him. Ceneth sucked breath between his teeth.
    

    
      \x{201c}You control that?\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel nodded. \x{201c}In the mountains, most of the time they do their own hunting, since the gardens were wide. But here, there are so many things\x{2014}farmers, horses, cattle\x{2014}that would be frightened by their comings and goings.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will assign men to hunt for them,\x{201d} Rok said, and her face cleared.
    

    
      \x{201c}Thank you. Now I will give them your names.\x{201d}
    

    
      She called the two Cats to her, and the Black Swan; and the men were still beneath the still gazes of the three, while Sybel moved among them, one by one, naming each.
    

    
      Rok. Bor. Eorth. Herne. Ceneth. Remember them. Guard them.
    

    
      \x{201c}Where is Cyrin?\x{201d} Coren said. \x{201c}Have you called him?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d}
    

    
      He looked at her, surprised. \x{201c}Surely the place is ready for him. Call him now, Sybel. He must be lonely by himself. He will think you do not want him.\x{201d}
    

    
      She drew a breath. \x{201c}I hope he will be happy here.\x{201d} She lifted her face toward the wind and sent the final call across the land, and felt Cyrin, beneath a tree, rise in answer.
    

    
      \x{201c}Cyrin,\x{201d} Eorth said to Herne. \x{201c}The Boar. Coren says he talks.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I believe it,\x{201d} Herne said simply. \x{201c}After what we have seen these past days, I am willing to believe anything.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel spoke with Rok again that night, in private when the household lay asleep around them and the dogs stretched dreaming at their feet. The scent of early summer rose from the crushed blossoms and new rushes on the stone floor, from the fields lying night-damp, with seedlings breaking the earth.
    

    
      \x{201c}I have told Ceneth and Bor that you will help us against Drede,\x{201d} Rok said. \x{201c}Eorth and Herne know only that we plot a war: they will not question how or why, but Ceneth and Bor have wits and use them. They know Sirle might overthrow the King alone, but not the combined forces of the King and the Lords of Niccon and Hilt. So they asked me, of course, where we would get the strength. I explained. They approved.\x{201d} He paused a moment, sipping wine. \x{201c}We were reared to battle, Sybel. Our grandfather laid the seventy-day siege of Mondor, and our father, not much older than Tamlorn, then, fought beside him. Since Norrel\x{2019}s death at Terbrec we have wanted revenge, but Niccon sided with Drede at that battle, and Horst of Hilt threw up his hands in despair and waited for the outcome of the war over his dead daughter. So we have not been sure of support.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Would Horst of Hilt fight, do you think, for the wrong Drede has done Laran\x{2019}s daughter; or would he fight for Rianna\x{2019}s child, Drede\x{2019}s son?\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok shook his head. \x{201c}I would not like to make a choice like that myself. Coren is right, I suspect: he will fight for the man he thinks will win. In this case: Drede.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So. I will persuade him otherwise.\x{201d} She lifted her eyes to Rok\x{2019}s face. \x{201c}And the Lord of Niccon. When shall I bring them to you?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Let me begin gathering men. Drede will turn to Hilt and Niccon, ask for support, and they will no doubt give it to him. Then, Sybel, you may call them, and Drede will watch his support drain like water through his fingers... I think he will know then who is behind the Sirle war.\x{201d}
    

    
      She nodded. \x{201c}And Coren. Does he know what you are planning?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He will, when Herne and Eorth begin to babble. No doubt he will think I am mad, until he sees Derth of Niccon ride into our courtyard.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He must not know where the money comes from.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d}
    

    
      She stirred a little. \x{201c}I am afraid.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Of Coren?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. I am afraid of the look in his eyes the day he finds out what game I am playing with Sirle.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It is our game as much as yours. You gave us a choice, and we took it. Besides, do you think if you told him what Drede had done to you he would not want revenge of his own? Why will you not tell him?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But why? He is your husband\x{2014}he would surely support your revenge. He has no love for Drede.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her mouth tightened. \x{201c}I will not draw Coren into the whirlpool of my anger and hatred. No revenge of his making could satisfy me, and it is purposeless involving him in mine. I want\x{2014}I want to keep him free of hate. He\x{2014}the night we flew the Dragon, we dropped downward suddenly, rushing toward darkness as though toward the endless deep of the night, blind, helpless, as you are when there is nothing left of you but the unhidden center of yourself\x{2014}and from the core of him came a living, joyous laughter. Lost in his own hate for Drede, he could not have laughed like that. He may fight in this war simply because if he refused to fight for my sake and you died at battle, he would never forgive himself for not being with you. But I will give him no great cause to fight for. I will not drag him through his grief and bitterness again. He has given me so much love. At least I can give him that one protection.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok looked at her silently a moment, his lips parted \x{201c}I doubt if it is possible,\x{201d} he said at last, gently. \x{201c}But I love you for trying.\x{201d}
    

    
      She went the next afternoon to the room high in the house that Rok had given her and sat for a while in the silence, stilling her thoughts, searching in far and secret places for the elusive Liralen. Her books stood on shelves against the walls, the metal and jewels on their backs searched by fingers of light that came from windows facing three directions. Lost to Sirle, sending thread after thread of a call that drifted always idly, unattached, unanswered, she did not see Coren until he knelt before her where she sat on cushions, and spoke her name.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel.\x{201d}
    

    
      She drew her mind back from regions farther than she had ever gone, and looked at him silently, blinking a moment.
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren. I am sorry\x{2014}I did not hear you come in. I was calling the Liralen. I am looking in places so far they have no names, and yet I think it must be closer; I think sometimes it must have answered, but I did not hear it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel\x{2014}\x{201d} He paused, his brows drawn in a rare frown. She reached out, traced the lines of it on his face.
    

    
      \x{201c}What is it?\x{201d}
    

    
      He took her hand, folded her fingers in his. \x{201c}Sybel, my brothers are babbling of war. Rok has sent messengers to our border farmers to mend their armor and shoe their war-horses, and he is sending Bor and Eorth to the lesser lords of Eldwold who are pledged through lands and favors to Sirle. I have asked Rok why, and why again, and he laughs and says that Drede is afraid of us or they would have killed me that day on Eld Mountain. I have asked him what hope of support he has, why he would risk our lives and lands for a battle that will be only another Terbrec, and he says that he will dangle the bait of power in front of Lord Horst, who is kin to both you and Tamlorn. He told me he did not expect me to fight against Drede, the father of the boy my wife reared and loved, but I cannot\x{2014}I cannot sit quietly while they go to their deaths. So\x{2014}I have come to you, to see what look is in your eyes when I tell you I will fight.\x{201d}
    

    
      She drew a deep breath, her eyes wide on his face. \x{201c}It is sudden, this war.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Too sudden. Rok says Drede will be weakened by the unexpectedness of it, but I think that bitter man is prepared to fight every day of his life, and that the Lion of Sirle is moving in a dreamworld. Sybel, are you angry with me? You know I want no war against Drede and Tam, especially not such a futile, hopeless thing as this. But if I stay here safe within these walls, and if my brothers die in battle, I will see their faces, hear their voices calling to me in my dreams until I die. Can you forgive me? Or can you give me a reason, one I can cling to even through my brothers\x{2019} deaths, not to fight?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}Only that all my joy will be gone from the earth if you are killed in this war. Coren, perhaps the Lion is not dreaming. Perhaps Rok is right and Sirle will defeat Drede, and no one will be killed.\x{201d}
    

    
      He shook his head, his face pained, hopeless. \x{201c}Sybel, men will die; perhaps not my brothers, but men of Sirle. At Terbrec, I heard their broken, weary voices weeping of their wounds while I fought, until I did not know anymore, in the dust, heat and blinding leap of metal, if they were truly men\x{2019}s voices, or the broken, crying voices of my own thoughts that could never again be coherent. It will be the same thing all over again, now. Rok is mad. I told him so, but he simply told me I did not have to fight. But he knows I will.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He does not seem mad,\x{201d} she said gently. \x{201c}Perhaps he knows something you do not know.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I hope so, for all our sakes.\x{201d} He lifted a hand, traced the line of her hair. \x{201c}You are not angry. I thought you would be. I thought you might leave me, go back to Eld.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And what would there be for me at Eld but an empty house? Coren, I knew when I married you that one day, sooner or later, I would have to watch you leave me, I would have to wait here quietly within these stones like Rok\x{2019}s wife and Eorth\x{2019}s wife, and not know if I would ever see you again. I just did not expect it now, so soon.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I did not dream Rok would ever do this; I thought we would live peacefully for years before anything such as this would happen.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know. But things\x{2014}things have simply woven together into a pattern, and now I cannot tell anymore where the thread of events began. So you must do what you must, and I\x{2014}what I must.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sorry,\x{201d} he whispered helplessly.
    

    
      \x{201c}No. The only thing you will have to be sorry for is if you die, and then beware because I will follow you.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. I will not let you wander among the stars alone.\x{201d}
    

    
      He smiled a little, swallowing. He touched her lips, then kissed them gently. Then he held her tightly, crushed against him, gathering her hair in his hands, and she listened to the slow life beat of his heart. They sat silent, motionless in the fall of sunlight, until Coren\x{2019}s hold loosened. He stood up, helped her up. Then he said, looking over her shoulder out the window,
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel, Cyrin is coming across the fields. We should go down and open the gate for him.\x{201d}
    

    
      The silver Boar met them at the postern, his tusks shining in the hot <<noon|13>>. He stood a moment, panting at Sybel\x{2019}s feet, looking at her out of his red eyes, and then he spoke to her in his flute-smooth voice,
    

    
      \x{201c}The giant Grof was hit in one eye by a stone, and that eye turned inward so that it looked into his mind and he died of what he saw there.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel stiffened. Coren stared incredulously at the great Boar. His head turned, flashing, toward Sybel, and she saw the startled question in his eyes. She found answer for neither of them, so she simply held open the gate, and Cyrin passed through into her garden.",

            '[12:00] The Forgotten Beasts of Eld - Patricia A. McKillip.epub (OEBPS/Text/The_Forgotten_Beasts_of_Eld_split_015.html) - noon',
            "She moved the Lords of Niccon and Hilt like chess pieces across Eldwold, from their heartlands to the house of the Lord of Sirle, until they stood blinking as at a dream while the smiling Rok welcomed them into his house. Rok\x{2019}s hall began to fill at <<noon|13>> and evenings with men who sat at their meals in shirts of leather and steel, with knives at their belts, and who spoke with their mouths full of battles they had seen and the scars they had taken as remembrances. The outer yards rang with the constant hollow beat of hammer as swords were forged, shields repaired, spear points welded to lengths of pale, straight ash, carts built, harness and gear of the great-hooved war-horses mended. All this the Lord Horst of Hilt, and in his turn, Lord Derth of Niccon, a fiery-haired young man who had sworn life and family to Drede\x{2019}s service, saw and looked within themselves to find good. Derth of Niccon, arriving a week after the Lord of Hilt, said rather plaintively at Rok\x{2019}s hearth, with a cup of wine in his hand,
    

    
      \x{201c}I did not realize you had so many followers, or I would not have pledged everything to Drede. But I did that because of Terbrec.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I do not intend a second Terbrec,\x{201d} Rok said, his eyes calm, gleaming faintly below the gold mane of hair. A little away from them, an ivory-haired woman sat quietly, needlework in her hands, her black eyes never moving from Derth\x{2019}s face, and to him she was little more than a shadow that did not impress itself into his memory. Derth sighed, tapping his cup with a fingernail.
    

    
      \x{201c}I can give you five hundred mounted men and three or four times as many on foot.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}The Lord of Hilt offered me less.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}His lands are divided\x{2014}part of them Carn of Hilt captured during the seventy-day siege of Mondor, and the men on them are claiming their old allegiance to the King.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}So? No doubt we can deal with them. Horst is too old for these games. I pity him.\x{201d}
    

    
      Derth snorted into his cup. \x{201c}Pity Drede, if you must. I have heard Horst was pledged to Drede, too, first, before he turned to you.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok\x{2019}s brows rose in polite surprise; he refrained from comment.
    

    
      Coren, weaving his way through the benches of men at their <<noon|13>> meal, caught sight of the red-haired lord and stood still midstep. Ceneth, with a faint smile, turned from his food and pushed a full cup into Coren\x{2019}s hand. Coren stared down at him.
    

    
      \x{201c}Do you see who that is?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Derth of Niccon. Ceneth, how did Rok get him here? Drede gave his father lands and gold for the work he did at Terbrec. What is Derth doing sitting at our hearth?\x{201d}
    

    
      Ceneth shrugged. \x{201c}Doubtless he heard the Lord of Hilt had turned to Sirle\x{2019}s side and discovered he would rather fight with Hilt than against it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But, Ceneth\x{2014}\x{201d} He groped for words, found them inaccessible for once, and drank instead. Then he saw Sybel and went to her.
    

    
      \x{201c}I have been looking for you everywhere.\x{201d}
    

    
      She blinked up at him, startled, the thread of her call broken. \x{201c}Coven\x{2014}\x{201d} Beside Rok, the Lord of Niccon rubbed his eyes with his fingers.
    

    
      \x{201c}I feel very confused,\x{201d} he commented. Rok refilled his cup.
    

    
      \x{201c}You are tired from your ride.\x{201d} He turned, tugged Coren away from Sybel. \x{201c}Eorth was looking for you; it seemed important.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I want to take Sybel riding. She is not used to all this babble and din.\x{201d} He paused a moment, then asked slowly, \x{201c}What are you doing here with Rok and Lord Derth?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, she said vaguely, her thoughts rushing like birds ahead of her. \x{201c}I wanted to talk to Rok.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok added smoothly, \x{201c}She was worried. Eorth is talking about riding Gyld into battle.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}What!\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}She could not talk him out of it. Perhaps you can.\x{201d} The Lord of Niccon leaned across Rok to stare at Sybel. \x{201c}Are you Sybel? I have heard about you...\x{201d}
    

    
      She smiled at him sweetly, holding his eyes, and he sank back in his chair. Coren said grimly,
    

    
      \x{201c}Perhaps if I tie him to his horse he will understand. Sybel, wait for me\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      He turned and made his way back into the crowd. Rok sighed softly and turned to the subdued Lord of Niccon.
    

    
      \x{201c}Now. The siege of my grandfather failed because he did not have the men to deal with supplies coming down the Slinoon River into Mondor. This time, I want men of Sirle and Niccon attacking by water, sailing through to the heart of the city and attacking within. We will need boats. Niccon is in the lake country of Eldwold. Can you build boats for three hundred men, and gather men to sail them?\x{201d}
    

    
      The Lord of Niccon stared at him like a man asleep with his eyes open and nodded. \x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will bear the cost for them.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}When do you want them?\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok smiled a little. \x{201c}Soon, but there is no great hurry. I am sure Drede will wait for us.\x{201d}
    

    
      He put the Lord of Niccon into Lynette\x{2019}s care when he had done with him, and she took him, puzzled, half-drunk, but enthused, to the same chamber where the Lord of Hilt had slept a week before. Sybel rose and paced a little through the empty hall; Rok watched her. \x{201c}What are you thinking?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}If I bring the animals into the battlefield, will Coren see them?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He can hardly avoid seeing Gyld. But the others... In the crush of men, the close flash and thrust of battle, he will probably notice nothing he does not expect to see. Why would you risk them, though? There is no need.\x{201d}
    

    
      A little, tight smile played about her mouth. She said softly, \x{201c}The Prince Ilf went one day with fifty men to capture the lovely daughter of Mak, Lord of Macon; on the way Ilf saw a black mountain Cat with fur that gleamed like a polished jewel. The Cat looked at him out of her green eyes, and Ilf gave chase and no one saw him or his fifty men on earth again. The three strong sons of King Pwill went with their friends hunting one day, and saw a silver-bristled Boar with great tusks white as the breasts of their highborn wives, and Pwill waited for them to come home, waited seven days and seven nights, and of those fifteen young men only his youngest son ever returned from that hunt. And he returned half-mad.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok stared at her. \x{201c}So will Drede be, seeing parts of his army vanish before his eyes. Will they do this for you?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Even the Boar? You said he did not approve.\x{201d}
    

    
      She traced a meaningless design on an oaken tables with her forefinger. \x{201c}He will do this if I command him to. The Swan I will send to Tam, to fly with him to Eld Mountain if at any moment his life is in danger. And Ter Falcon will guard Tam.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And Gyld?\x{201d}
    

    
      Her eyes narrowed in a slow smile. \x{201c}Gyld will bring Drede to me.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok\x{2019}s head moved once from side to side. \x{201c}Now,\x{201d} he said softly, \x{201c}I am beginning to pity Drede.\x{201d}
    

    
      There was a step without. They turned to see Coren, his hair bright in the summer light, pause at the open doors, one hand on the stones. He looked at Rok and asked softly,
    

    
      \x{201c}Why did you lie to me about Eorth?\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok sighed. \x{201c}Because I was telling lies to the Lord of Niccon, and I did not want you embarrassing me with the truth.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You are lying to me now.\x{201d} He stepped forward into the quiet, sun-streaked hall, came to stand so close to Rok there was scarcely a hand\x{2019}s breadth between them.
    

    
      \x{201c}Why did you need my wife beside you while you told lies to Derth of Niccon, who could barely recognize truth if it leaped like a salmon from the bottom of his wine cup?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren,\x{201d} Sybel said, but his eyes did not move from Roles face.
    

    
      \x{201c}There are things I do not understand about this war you plot. There are things I am not sure, now, that I want to understand. How you persuaded that old man, Horst of Hilt to your side, when last winter you sent me to him and I found him terrified of Drede, wanting only to live out his days in peace, to forget his unfortunate daughter and the chaos she made of Drede\x{2019}s love. Why Derth of Niccon, whose older brother you killed at Terbrec, would come and sit beside you, drink your wine and plan a war with you? Why you planned this war before you even spoke to them? And why, if there are simple reasons for all these things, you did not have the courtesy or the regard for me to tell me before I had to ask?\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok was silent. He drew a long breath, his eyes hidden in his still face, and Coren\x{2019}s hands closed at his sides.
    

    
      \x{201c}Do not lie to me again,\x{201d} he whispered.
    

    
      \x{201c}Coren,\x{201d} Sybel said. His eyes moved slowly from Rok\x{2019}s face to hers, and she saw in them the dark, reluctant blooming of his doubt. For a long moment they stood motionless, their eyes locked, still as the sunlight falling against the crushed summer flowers on the hall floor. Then Coren moved away from Rok, went out of the hall, down the steps to the yard. Rok watched his head gleam in and out of the shadows. Then he heard the sharp catch of Sybel\x{2019}s breath and turned.
    

    
      \x{201c}What did you do?\x{201d} he breathed incredulously.
    

    
      \x{201c}I did not mean to\x{2014}\x{201d} Her hands rose, covering her mouth. \x{201c}I did not mean to\x{2014} Not to Coren\x{2014}not Coren. It was\x{2014} I did not know what to say to him\x{2014}and it was so easy\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But what did you do?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I made him forget what he saw today, what he asked you. I am sorry.\x{201d} She began to tremble suddenly, and tears slid glittering between her fingers. \x{201c}I am so sorry. It was so\x{2014}easy.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}\x{2019}I am frightened.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel.\x{201d} He went to her, held her gently by the shoulders. \x{201c}It was no worse than lying to him.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It was! It was! I took things from his mind\x{2014}as\x{2014}Mithran would have taken them from mine\x{2014}it was a thing no one should do, in either love or hate\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sh. Sybel, you are tired from the work this morning, and you forgot what you were doing. There is no great harm done. It is better for him this way, and you will never do it again.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am afraid.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Hush, you did little harm, little more than lying\x{2014}you will not do it again.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{2019}No. \x{201c}
    

    
      \x{201c}Then do not worry.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her eyes, staring wide out of the empty doorway, came back to his face. \x{201c}You do not understand. He\x{2014}he thinks I am honest. And I have lied to him since the day I married him.\x{201d} She looked down suddenly at his hands, as though realizing for the first time that he was holding her. She pulled away from him, ran to the door.
    

    
      She saw Coren walking out the main gate toward the open fields and ran after him through the yard, past the billowing smoke of the smithy, the pound of hammers from the carpenter\x{2019}s shop, the startled faces of farmers and warriors, moving aside so she could pass. Coren heard her call finally and stopped on the dusty road. He waited for her, the smile on his face fading as she neared him. He lifted his hands, caught her, and she crept close to him, her head against his shoulder.
    

    
      \x{201c}Hold me, Coren,\x{201d} she whispered, and his arms formed a circle of peace about her. He felt her trembling.
    

    
      \x{201c}What is it?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Nothing. Just hold me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You have been crying.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I know.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}What has made you cry?\x{201d}
    

    
      Her eyes opened, dark, to the hot fields and the shimmering sky. She felt his hold tighten. \x{201c}I was thinking,\x{201d} she whispered, and the words burned through her throat, \x{201c}of myself without you... and how I could not bear it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel, what can I say to comfort you? There will be no comfort in this war until it is over. But you were right somehow: Rok is not mad and there is, through some magic I do not understand, a chance for Sirle. So perhaps it will be brief\x{2014}though that cannot comfort you much either, where Tam is concerned. But I am so glad that you still care enough to cry about me in spite of this.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I care. I care.\x{201d} She stirred finally and his arms dropped. He glanced around puzzledly at the green fields.
    

    
      \x{201c}I forgot why I came out here. You frightened me, running toward me with your hair like a silver wake and tears on your face.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. I made you forget,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}I am sorry.\x{201d}
    

    
      He put his arm around her, and they walked back together to the house, black crows fluttering upward from the fields around them as they passed.
    

    
      She spoke to her animals that evening. She had called Ter Falcon from Mondor; he came in the twilight, shooting like a star from the blue-black sky. He perched among the rich green leaves of the summer trees, and she said to him,
    

    
      Ter. Tell me of Drede.
    

    
      He is a man afraid to the core and the bone, said the glittering-eyed Falcon. He shouts in his sleep at night, and a torch burns always in his room. He is afraid of the night shadows. A fear beyond the fear of battle grows behind his eyes like thick, winter ice. There are whispers that he is going mad, but he contains himself, saying little.
    

    
      And Tam?
    

    
      Tam watches. He takes me with him everywhere; he talks to me late at night and falls asleep sometimes still talking. He wants you to help Drede. He told me to ask you. He is desperate.
    

    
      And you?
    

    
      I am ready.
    

    
      Listen then for any words that may help Rok. When the moment comes, I want you at Tam\x{2019}s side, protecting him. She lifted her head, called the Swan to Gules came to lie at her feet, and Moriah beside her and she woke Gyld in his cave with a touch of mind. Cyrin Boar came to her between the trees, glowing in the darkness. For a long moment that tested strength and sinew of her mind, straining concentration to its limits, she held the six proud, restless minds at once.
    

    
      Listen to me. When the Lord of Sirle and his brothers ride out of Sirle to battle, Ter and the Swan of Tirlith will fly then to Mondor, to Tam. The Swan will be ready at any moment to fly him to Eld Mountain, if there is danger to him. Ter, I want you to keep Tam safe. Moriah, Gules and Cyrin, you will appear to Drede\x{2019}s army, before the battle, during the battle, luring men away with the magic of your eyes, the beauty of you. Gyld, I will keep with me until Drede is finished, and then Gyld will bring the King to me at the wizard\x{2019}s tower in Mondor.
    

    
      At all times keep yourselves discreetly out of sight until you see fit to move. Stay away from Rok\x{2019}s men. Put yourself into no unnecessary danger, except for Tam\x{2019}s sake and\x{2014}if you choose\x{2014}for Coren\x{2019}s sake. Ter, stay away from Drede. Unless he is killed in battle, I want him brought to me alive.
    

    
      The wind sighed briefly in the quiet night. She paused a moment, weary, then trained her mind once more into theirs.
    

    
      The legends told of you are countless, but all of them old. What you do in this battle, harpists will sing of for years, touching their silver strings with wonder, and your proud, ancient names will echo again within the stone walls of men\x{2019}s courts, fine-sounding as new-polished gold, honored and revered.
    

    
      She paused again, feeling in one moment the swift, pulsing beat of Ter\x{2019}s thoughts, the jewels of the hidden memories in Gules\x{2019} mind, Moriah\x{2019}s mind, the serene acquiescence of the Black Swan\x{2019}s moonlit mind, the twists of Gyld\x{2019}s fiery brain, the constant play of riddle upon riddle in Cyrin\x{2019}s mind, woven out of the unending threads of his thoughts. She loosed them, spent, and as they waited quietly around her, she rested a moment. Then she took their questions.
    

    
      Do you want Drede\x{2019}s men destroyed? Moriah asked. Or returned after a suitable time?
    

    
      I do not want their lives. Run them in circles a while, then let them go.
    

    
      Why will you not let me fight? Gyld asked. I could scatter Drede\x{2019}s army with a single flight through it.
    

    
      No. You would frighten Rok\x{2019}s men, too. Wait patiently with me.
    

    
      There may be men guarding Eld Mountain, the Swan said. Where then, Sybel?
    

    
      Then bring him to Sirle. But take him first to the mountain and wait for me, if there is no danger.
    

    
      What will you do with Drede? Ter asked.
    

    
      Nothing. I want only to look into his eyes when I am done with him, when he has nothing-neither power, nor rank, nor even Tam to comfort him. Mithran was fortunate compared to him. By then, he may be mad.
    

    
      And what will you do with yourself afterward? Cyrin asked.
    

    
      Sybel, looking into his red eyes, was silent. The leaves rustled in the wind above her as at a sudden breath, then stilled. She whispered at last to herself,
    

    
      \x{201c}I do not know.\x{201d}
    

    
      There came a few days later to Rok\x{2019}s hall a slender, long-nosed woman with rich rings on her fingers and her white hair in a thousand untidy curls. She passed into it so quietly that she reached Rok\x{2019}s elbow unnoticed as he sat at his meal, with Lynette on one side of him and Bor at the other, and she tugged at his sleeve. He turned, startled, to meet the iron-gray eyes.
    

    
      \x{201c}Where is Sybel?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel?\x{201d} He sent a glance down the table. \x{201c}She left, I think, with Coren. Perhaps they are\x{2014} Old woman, who are you? Will you sit with us? I did not hear you come in.\x{201d}
    

    
      Her wandering eyes came back to him. \x{201c}Oh, I am the sharp-eyed old crow of Eld Mountain. And you\x{2014}you I think are the Lion of Sirle. Such a lovely family you have, such peach-colored children and lordly brothers. I have had such a walk from Eld Mountain.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You walked!\x{201d} Rok exclaimed. Beside him, Bor rose courteously.
    

    
      \x{201c}Sit down, Lady. Eat with us.\x{201d}
    

    
      She smiled at him, her hands fluttering to touch her hair. \x{201c}So kind...\x{201d} she murmured and sat. \x{201c}Oh, my feet. I am Maelga, Sybel\x{2019}s mother.\x{201d} At her right hand, Ceneth coughed over his wine and she turned to him. \x{201c}I am the only mother she ever had. You may not think a mountain witch would make a very good mother.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I am sure you were better than nothing,\x{201d} Ceneth said weakly. Rok caught his eye, and he reddened.
    

    
      \x{201c}I am not so sure of that,\x{201d} Maelga said candidly, searching through a plate of sugared fruits and nuts. \x{201c}Otherwise, I would not have had to walk all the way from Eld Mountain to Sirle to find out why Cyrin Boar came snorting to me with such a tale I could not believe...\x{201d} She caught Rok\x{2019}s swift glance from side to side over the rows of preoccupied faces. \x{201c}Oh, is it a secret?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Old woman, what do you want?\x{201d} Rok said softly and she sighed.
    

    
      \x{201c}Dried, sweetened apricots... I am a child with sweet things. You see, Rok, I have done\x{2014}oh, things by twilight, dim things by candlelight that are spoken of best by hushed voices. I am an old woman with a weakness for meddling, and people give me rings and soft furs and bright ribbons. I weave on a small loom with threads of simple colors. But Sybel\x{2014}now there is a weave, her weave, with a loom the size of Eldwold and threads of living scarlet.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It is her choice.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes, but it frightens me in my old heart. It frightens Cyrin, too, and he such a wise old Boar. Rok, when you look at her you see a beautiful, strong-willed woman whose power is the star of fortune over Sirle. And I see a child with a festering hurt that eventually will be the death of her.\x{201d}
    

    
      Rok set his cup softly on the table. Maelga looked at him, her white brows arched over her sharp eyes, her chin resting on her ringed forgers. He was silent a moment, his fingers tapping the silver.
    

    
      \x{201c}Indeed,\x{201d} he said, his voice low in the noise, \x{201c}she is weaving a living tapestry with herself and us in it as well as the King and the Lords of Eldwold. She has gone too far to stop, and so have I. She is no child: she has plotted this thing with me step by step and has kept it secret even from Coren. I am playing for power; it is a game my ancestors taught me, and I will play it until I die of it. Sybel is playing her own game of power, not for gain, or even for fame, but for a kind of dark triumph over Drede and even over Mithran. When she has had her triumph, she will come back to live quietly, contentedly with her animals and with Coren. It is not enough for me to know Sirle can defeat Drede\x{2014}I must act in the knowledge, and keep acting afterward to protect my great power. But Sybel is more fortunate. She can achieve great power and then let it go and rest content in the knowledge of what she could do if she willed. If this were not true, I would be as frightened of her as Drede is. But there is love in her for Coren, for the children, for simple, quiet things. I think you taught her this, Maelga, when you loved her. Do not be worried. She will take her revenge and be satisfied.\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga watched him silently over her flickering jewels until he finished. Then she dropped her hands. \x{201c}I could never talk to lions\x{2014}I cannot growl. Where is she?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}She may be with her animals. I will send for her.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d} She rose. \x{201c}Tell me how to find them. I will go there alone.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will take you and then leave you with her.\x{201d} He pushed his chair back, led her past the tables. \x{201c}But if Coren is with her, talk of the weather, of star patterns, of how you ate nothing at the table of the Lord of Sirle. He is innocent of this; she values that.\x{201d}
    

    
      They found her with Coren in the gardens, laughing together beside the lake while the Black Swan took bread pieces from Coren\x{2019}s fingers. The Cats lay lazily beneath the warm sun; Cyrin Boar nosed at something idly through the grass as he stood in the shade. Sybel turned as the gate closed behind Maelga. The smile on her face melted to astonishment.
    

    
      \x{201c}Maelga!\x{201d}
    

    
      Coren turned, tossed the rest of the bread into the water and followed Sybel, smiling as she flung her arms around Maelga.
    

    
      \x{201c}I am glad to see you.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}My white child, you have grown so\x{2014}so bright! Let me look at you.\x{201d} She held Sybel at arm\x{2019}s length. \x{201c}You did not stop to see me when you came to the Mountain last.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}How did you know\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Cyrin Boar told me. He told me many things\x{201c}
    

    
      Sybel\x{2019}s eyes grew still. She glanced at Coren, and he touched her cheek.
    

    
      \x{201c}I will go and let you talk.\x{201d}
    

    
      She smiled. \x{201c}Please, Coren. It is only women\x{2019}s talk.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}When one is a witch and the other a wizard, I doubt that.\x{201d} He left them. They looked at one another a moment, quietly. Then Maelga\x{2019}s fingers folded against one another and she brought them to her mouth.
    

    
      \x{201c}My child, what are you doing?\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel sighed. \x{201c}Sit down. How did you get here?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}On my own feet.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh, Maelga, you should have taken a horse.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I was afraid whom I might steal from...\x{201d} She got down beside Sybel, under a strong-limbed apple tree. \x{201c}Cyrin told me a tale Ter had told him of a King and a white bird in a tower...\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel glanced at the silver Boar. \x{201c}Wisdom never learned silence, and it is most annoying when least wanted.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Why did you not tell me what Drede did to you?\x{201d}
    

    
      Her mouth tightened. \x{201c}Because it hurt too much. Because I was angry to my heart\x{2019}s core and there were no words for it. That little King would have\x{2014}\x{201d} She brushed her hand across the grass impatiently. \x{201c}There are no words in either you or Cyrin to stop me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel, I do not know what you are doing\x{2014}I only know that Tam came to me two days ago\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Tam?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Afraid. He said war was murmuring all over Eldwold against his father, and the King blamed you. He said lords who had pledged to help his father suddenly turned to Sirle without reason. He said the King walks like a man of stone. Sybel, he sat at my hearth with his eyes wide, unblinking, while he told me this, and his hands gripping his arms as if he were cold. There were no tears left in him.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel picked a single grass-blade, stared down at it
    

    
      without seeing it. She shivered a little. \x{201c}My poor Tam... It will only be a little while longer.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And then what?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}`Then Drede will lose his throne. Perhaps his mind. Perhaps his life.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And Tam?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Rok will make a king of him. In a suitable time he will marry Herne\x{2019}s daughter Vivet, and her sons will begin the Sirle line of Kings in Eldwold.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}And Coren? I have heard he knows nothing of this.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Maelga, as I will do what I must to destroy Drede, I will do what I must to keep Coren from knowing what I am doing\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}How? Will you destroy a thought or two in his mind?\x{201d}
    

    
      Her face twisted. She dropped her head on her bent knees, hidden from the searching gray eyes. \x{201c}No,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}I will not do that. I did that once. Once. I will not do it again. I will lose him first. Maelga, I have taken a step in the dark, and I will not turn back for any word in Eldwold. I am glad to see you, but I think now you are not so glad to see me. I have been hurt, and now I will hurt in my own turn. It is that simple. I am sorry for Tam. But that is the only thing I am sorry for.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You do not see,\x{201d} Maelga whispered. \x{201c}Child, Tam loves that King. Drede is the one in the world who can look into Tam\x{2019}s eyes and give Tam his pride. And he is being driven mad before Tam\x{2019}s eyes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}What is that to me?\x{201d} She rose abruptly, facing the afternoon wind so that it blew her hair tangled, restless behind her. \x{201c}He must find his own pride. Maelga\x{2014}\x{201d} She lifted her hands suddenly to her face and found tears slipping between her cold fingers. She covered her eyes with her fingers. \x{201c}I cannot forgive him,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}My heart aches for Tam, but I can not. I will not. And I will not cry for myself... only a little for Tam. Did he blame me himself?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He suspects that Drede did something to make you angry. But he does not believe\x{2014}he does not want to believe that you could terrify Drede so, because you know he loves Drede. Oh, he sees things in his heart and he closes his heart\x{2019}s eye to them, a child closing his eyes to the dark. When he is forced to open his eyes, Sybel, what will you tell him? What comfort will you give him? His heart will shrink like a wounded thing from any touch.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}It is Drede\x{2019}s fault.\x{201d} She shook her head abruptly. \x{201c}No. It is my doing, too. But Drede should never have tried to ruin me.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}He is doing it now.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel turned, looked down at her, dark eyed. \x{201c}That may be, but now it is my choice. Drede was a fool and so was Mithran, for underestimating that white-haired woman they caught. And neither of them will ever make that mistake again.\x{201d} She paused a moment, then said more gently. \x{201c}I am hard and stubborn these days. There is no moving me. Maelga, let us talk of other things now, little things. I am sorry we did not stop to see you that night, but Drede\x{2019}s men found us there with Tam and it seemed wiser to leave without speaking to you, in case we were watched.\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga\x{2019}s hands moved in the long grass. Lines puckered her brow above her sharp eyes but she said only, \x{201c}Are you happy, then, with the wise one of Sirle?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Yes. I want no one else, ever. I want to bear him children, if\x{2014}if he wants them of me when this is done.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}You expect none yet?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No.\x{201d} She sat down again in the grass. \x{201c}But perhaps it is better for the moment. I am happy here, Maelga. The people are good to me, and the children and women seem so bright, so contented among the gray stones. I miss the deep, roaring winds, the clear streams and the quiet places of Eld Mountain; the animals miss them, too, sometimes, but we are all content enough here among men. Rok made a room for me, high in the house with windows facing north, east and south, and he put my books there. I read there, and call. I miss you, too. I cannot run to you for comfort, though there is no one, these days, to give me comfort.\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga touched a strand of the white hair that brushed across her hand. \x{201c}I miss you, too. But now I see the Lion was right: you are no longer a child. You have grown a queen among men. You no longer would be happy among the stones and trees of the Mountain. But I see the ghost of you sometimes, slipping barefoot through the great red pillars with a round-eyed child running at your side. And the shadows of you make me stop and smile. And then I remember they are only shadows, that my children have grown away from me, gone their ways...\x{201d} She sighed, her lean hands fluttering. \x{201c}But I was so fortunate to have you.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel\x{2019}s fingers closed gently around Maelga\x{2019}s parchment-colored, ringed hand. \x{201c}And I was that fortunate to have you,\x{201d} she said softly. \x{201c}I was as wild and proud as any of my animals that day I walked through your door. Whatever gentleness I have, you and Tam taught me, and later, Coren. But I am still wild, proud as my father and my grandfather were, deep in me where the white bird lives free that no man can capture. It is that pride in me crying out for revenge\x{2014}the pride in my knowledge and power. That same pride drove Myk away from men to the isolation of Eld Mountain to build his white hall and capture perfection. But because of you and Tam, I learned to love something beyond pure knowledge. And Coren taught me greatly of joy... I may not be so good at loving, Maelga, but it is my own fault\x{2014}I have been rich in teachers.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}My white one,\x{201d} Maelga whispered, \x{201c}when you disappeared that night from your hall, I knew I would never see you again, and there was such a sorrow in my withered heart. And today, again, there is that sorrow... you will step again into the night and when I see you again I will look into a stranger\x{2019}s eyes.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Strange to you, but Maelga, I think I have never been less strange to myself as now. It is a terrible thing to say, but there is a triumph in me that I do not even have the sense to fear. It is as though in my thoughts I am Gyld, flying high, high in the night sky, huge, powerful, irresistible, with pride in all the memories of battles, of slayings, of stealings, of songs where my name is a beat of awe and fear. There is no one in all the world to check my night flight of triumph. When it is done, that thing in me will find a place to coil and sleep and I can forget it.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But will you forget? Rok will ask more of you, and more\x{2014} I saw that in his Lion\x{2019}s eyes. And Tam\x{2014}you may teach Tam to ask of you\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}No. Tam is good. And Rok will spare me for Coren\x{2019}s sake.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}Will he? Will you even care by then for Coren\x{2019}s love?\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will care. I care now.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}But you fly alone, away from him\x{2014} I wonder, will you want to come back earthward after that flight?\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel sighed. She loosed Maelga\x{2019}s hand and touched her eyes with her fingers. \x{201c}I am tired of the ceaseless weave to and fro of questioning, wondering, thinking. I will set Eldwold aflame and then find out if I am trapped within the ring of fire, or safe outside it... Maelga, you must be tired, too, after your long walk. Let me take you to my chamber, where you can eat, and wash and rest.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will not rest in this house\x{201c}
    

    
      \x{201c}Well. Then if you will not stay here with me, let Rok send someone with you to Herne\x{2019}s house, or Bor\x{2019}s house.\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga patted Sybel\x{2019}s hand. She rose a little unsteadily and brushed the grass off her skirt. \x{201c}No. I will rest here a while, with your animals. I will go and sit with the Black Swan. Such a lovely swan fountain, there. I never cared much for men\x{2019}s houses\x{2014}you cannot get in and out of them easily.\x{201d}
    

    
      Sybel smiled a little. \x{201c}No.\x{201d} She put her arm around Maelga, walked with her to the lake. The Black Swan glided to meet them. \x{201c}I will bring you food and wine. If you want to sleep out here tonight, I will stay with you.\x{201d}
    

    
      Maelga sank down at the lake\x{2019}s edge. \x{201c}Oh, my bones. The sun is so kind in summer to an old woman. And you are kind, still, to powerless things. It is comforting.\x{201d}
    

    
      \x{201c}I will be back soon,\x{201d} Sybel said.
    

    
      \x{201c}There is no hurry, my white one. I will take a little nap.\x{201d} She closed her eyes. Sybel went quietly to the gate, closed it softly behind her as she left. Then she looked up to see Coren standing before her, and she blinked, startled.
    

    
      \x{201c}Oh\x{2014}\x{201d}
    

    
      He lifted his hands slowly, gripped her arms. His eyes moved back and forth across her face, narrowed, bewildered, as though he were reading ancient words he could not understand. Then he drew a breath and shouted,
    

    
      \x{201c}Sybel, what are you doing?\x{201d}",
          ],
        ];
