            "In 1953, Carl Hiaasen was born in Plantation, Florida, a tiny suburb of Ft. Lauderdale at the westernmost edge of then-rural Broward County. By <<1960|9n:0>>, around the time he got his first typewriter, Plantation's population of 4,800 was roughly that of Ft. Lauderdale in 1922, when Hiaasen's grandfather moved down from North Dakota to eventually found the area's first law firm. While Plantation remained safely fringed by Everglades and swamp, providing the perfect environment for an idyllic boyhood, Broward County's population of 84,000 had almost quadrupled by 1960. By <<1960|9n:0>> as well, almost one-third of the state's entire population was concentrated in southeast Florida, which had grown in that same decade by over 113 percent. In the years since, Florida has absorbed into its population approximately 300,000 people a year, for a relative growth rate almost triple that of the rest of the country. To accommodate the 700-1,000 new residents arriving daily, a minimum of 300 acres of green space must be paved, also daily, for subdivisions, streets, schools, and shopping malls. Added to that has been the considerable development required to house and entertain tourists, 41 million of them in 1990, the year before Native Tongue, Hiaasen's satirical novel about theme parks, was published. During the same years that 75 percent of all currently existing developments were being built, at least five animal species disappeared completely, and a significant number of others were greatly reduced as their habitats either vanished or were poisoned by agricultural runoff or toxins like mercury. Today, the Everglades is half its original size, Florida Bay is endangered, and Broward County (with a population of 1.5million and recently ranked ninth in the nation for destroyed wetlands and forests) has drawn Plantation into its geographical center. The dirt bike-path Hiaasen and his friends rode into the swamp, where they camped and caught water moccasins, is now University Drive, nine shopping malls lining the same route they once took. These are the sources of Carl Hiaasen's outrage and satire, the losses beginning even in childhood, when he and his friends would pull up or relocate surveyor's stakes, feeling that such small, futile acts were nevertheless their moral duty. \"We were kids,\" he says. \"We didn't know what else to do. We were little and the bulldozers were big.\" Their memorable roar Hiaasen often compares to \"the sound of money,\" because greed, he says, is \"the engine that has run Florida ever since there was a Florida.\" Greed and its accompanying corruption, in fact, occupy one side of Hiaasen's clearly articulated system of right and wrong, while unspoiled wilderness lies on the other. The two are separated by what Skink, in Double Whammy, perceives to be \"the moral seam of the universe\" as he gazes at the dike separating a contaminated development from pristine swampland. Against this backdrop, events play out in Hiaasen's novels and columns, the moral landscape making almost tangible certain basic and universal values: we should be loyal to our friends, behave with civility and decency, earn our paychecks honestly, experience shame if we steal, preserve the world for our children, and never surrender\x{2014}either our belief in these values, or to anyone who would violate them for personal gain. As Hiaasen says, \"You try to be a good citizen wherever you live. Plant mangroves and don't piss in the water.\" Hiaasen traces his strong sense of right and wrong back to the losses of the 1960s\x{2014}the \"complete end of innocence\" caused by the Kennedy assassinations, two tragic events creating the historical circumstances that placed Richard Nixon in the White House, accelerated the war in Vietnam, and ultimately led to Watergate. \"It was a poisonous time to be coming of age,\" Hiaasen says. \"It seemed to me there was so much wrong in the world. I felt such outrage for so many years over those things happening that it wasn't a hard thing to carry into journalism.\" When Hiaasen began his Miami Herald column in 1985, however, after having first been a general assignment reporter and then a member of the Herald's prize-winning investigation team, the newspaper hadn't yet established a tradition of commentary written with \"ferocity and passion, mordant wit, and moral outrage,\" as Doug Clifton, former executive editor of the Miami Herald, describes Hiaasen's bi-weekly column. Miami was still a young city, Hiaasen explains, with no voice, even on the editorial page, that expressed strongly held opinions likely to inspire an equally strong response from readers. So when Hiaasen ridiculed the first Cuban American county manager, whose indictment for grand theft was dismissed because of a 1951 ruling on cattle rustling (\"a standard of conduct against which all public officials should be tested,\" Hiaasen dryly observed), Herald editors initially cringed. Interestingly, however, the following year that same county manager forgot to disclose, as required by law, a large profit he made on a land deal, prompting Hiaasen to write that such memory lapses by someone controlling the county budget suggested the need for a brain scan in addition to a lawyer: \"If I thought [he] deserved to be fired for lying to the IRS and buying stolen suits and lying about it, I would say that in the column. Gotta get rid of the guy. And it was unheard of at the time.\" From the start, it was also clear Hiaasen would not allow himself to be bullied. In 1987, when a city commissioner objected to funding the Sister Cities convention because representatives from communist countries might attend, Hiaasen called his antics \"boneheaded.\" By certified mail, the commission sent a formal, albeit unintelligible, resolution demanding that the Herald retract or clarify Hiaasen's \"false and misleading statement,\" to which Hiaasen replied that since his original column was neither false nor misleading, he couldn't add even \"a cheerfully instructive footnote.\" He did, however, formulate a resolution of his own, which reads, in part: \"Be it resolved: It is hereby demanded that the Miami City Commission quit wasting time on dumb, self-serving resolutions when there are so many more important issues facing the community. \"Regarding the Sister Cities International convention and the alleged Communist menace therein, it is hereby demanded that city commissioners halt such reactionary nonsense immediately, since it exposes all South Florida to national scorn and ridicule. It is further demanded that if the commissioners choose to make fools of themselves, that they do so in the privacy of their homes and not in a public forum.\" Now, much of Miami has come to expect a no-holds-barred Hiaasen column that synthesizes news stories and corruption scandals, and makes sense of issues in its own \"brilliant fashion, with humor that skewers,\" according to Jim Savage, head of the Herald's investigations team, who worked with Hiaasen in the mid-1980s on uncovering and ultimately stopping Port Bougainville, one of several illegally sited developments that would have added altogether some 60,000 people to North Key Largo. On this project, and on the Smuggler's Island investigation, which began with a memo about a water main and ended with a series on dope running in Key West, Savage observed firsthand Hiaasen's legendary insight. It was Hiaasen, Savage notes, who quickly recognized the heart of the story\x{2014}how drug dealing dramatically altered people's lives, especially in Key West, but with implications for the rest of the country. Savage now uses Hiaasen's story-assembling techniques, as well as his accuracy, fairness, and skillful interviewing, as a model of excellence in investigative reporting when he teaches seminars in project writing. \"Carl is the most talented journalist I've worked with because he's an outstanding researcher and a world-class writer,\" Savage says. \"It would be great if we could clone Carl Hiaasen, so one could still be working with me.\"",

            "At his funniest and most playful, Hiaasen still remains dedicated to what he considers his responsibility to the public\x{2014}being straightforward and up-front. \"A columnist is paid to take a stand. If a reader can't figure out how I feel about something, then I don't deserve to take my paycheck home that week, because I copped out,\" Hiaasen says. \"I feel strongly about the advocacy role of the columnist.\" Certainly, he has never shied away from directly tackling issues in the public interest, even when doing so cost the Herald money, as in 1994 when the Lennar Corporation, implicated in the construction scandals following Hurricane Andrew, withdrew advertising because Hiaasen lambasted his own newspaper for promoting Lennar's new home giveaway contest. \"According to an exciting full-page advertisement,\" he wrote, \"a lucky reader will win Lennar's 'Home of the Future.' This is not to be confused with Lennar's 'homes of the past,' many of which splintered like Popsicle sticks during Hurricane Andrew.\" Particularly scathing, this column suggests that, as a \"marvel of modern engineering,\" the home of the future might be made of shingles \"actually nailed to the roofs,\" gables \"actually anchored to the walls,\" real plywood in place of \"pressed fiber-board,\" and might therefore remain \"vertical, even in 100-mile per hour winds.\" (Interestingly, two years later, Hiaasen again had occasion to write about Lennar Homes, when sinkholes full of trash opened up behind houses in a Miramar subdivision the company had built. <<After 250|9n:1>> truckloads of \"tires, rotting tree limbs, rusty appliances and construction debris\" were hauled away, the remaining pit filled with brown water and had to be fenced.) Despite its loss of a major advertiser, the Herald never told Hiaasen to stop writing about Lennar, even though \"at many, many other newspapers there would have been a heel on the back of my neck to lay off,\" he says. The Herald also printed Hiaasen's criticism of the newspaper's then-publisher, Dave Lawrence, when he contemplated running for governor in 1998. While praising Lawrence as a \"smart, decent, compassionate fellow who cares about Florida and believes fervently in the innate goodness of mankind,\" Hiaasen also vigorously objected to the \"untenable and queasy position\" his candidacy would have created for \"this newspaper, the reporters, columnists and editors who produce it.\" Anything Herald staffers wrote about Lawrence or his opponent, Hiaasen pointed out, could have been perceived as coming from \"Lawrence's personal campaign machine,\" and not from the independent voices the public was entitled to hear. \"What would our readers have thought if I stayed silent? I couldn't. The only way I knew to let our readers know it's business as usual was to do the same kind of tough column on Dave I would do on anyone,\" Hiaasen says. \"It put us in a helluva position.\" The column in which he takes on his own boss (who was less surprised perhaps than others at the Herald, Hiaasen says, and who remains to this day a friend) begins with that customary punch:",

            "Fun and frolics reigned at Haulover Beach again this past weekend, as scores of chowderheads ignored posted warnings and plunged straight into a dangerous riptide. If that weren't enough excitement, a mob of male high-school kids attacked several teenage girls, ripping off all their clothes, grabbing their breasts and genitals and chasing them down the beach. When one of the Haulover lifeguards tried to shield one of the girls, he was kicked repeatedly. \"She was naked and they were grabbing her. I just wanted to get her out of the crowd,\" said the lifeguard, Ken Chouinard. \"It made me sick, and it also made me fearful for the people who come out here.\" Some of these festivities were captured on tape by a WTVJ-Channel 4 news crew and should be recommended viewing for anyone who is considering a leisurely family outing at Haulover. For years this has been a trouble spot, though the parks department doesn't advertise the fact. Keeping the beach safe apparently is a low priority in the budget, as evidenced by the minimal way in which the county polices the area and staffs its lifeguard crews. \"We get the same consideration as macrame classes and kickball games,\" says Lt. David Battenfield, a Haulover lifeguard for the past 15 years. \"This county is providing people access to this beach, but it's not providing their protection.\" For a long time, the lifeguards have been trying to get someone to pay attention. The near-riot this weekend, combined with the perilous surf conditions, portend a disaster in the making\x{2014}an expensive one. Currently, Haulover Park has 11 full-time lifeguards on staff. Part-timers are hired to fill out the shifts, though many are not trained as emergency medical technicians, as the full-time lifeguards usually are. Haulover Beach is about 1.4 miles long, but almost 43 percent is out of immediate range of a lifeguard tower and basically unguarded. The biggest stretch between towers measures 810 yards\x{2014}a long way to run, if somebody's drowning at the other end. The last accident took place March 23. Lifeguards got there swiftly and pulled the 42-year-old tourist out of the water, but he died later. The miracle is that it doesn't happen more often. During the past week or so, strong winds and spring tidal conditions have made Haulover particularly treacherous, with invisible run-out currents sweeping many swimmers out toward the open water. Lifeguards officially closed the beach on three days, but plenty of idiotic showoffs hopped in anyway. On March 27, Haulover lifeguards logged 10 rescues. On March 29, the number was nine. On March 30, it was <<15|9d>>. Business peaked again this past weekend with 19 rescues on Saturday and 28 more on Sunday. While the park is much more crowded than it was in 1975, there are five fewer full-time lifeguards now. During last year's budget crunch, the county proposed cutting back even more on the staffs, but the lifeguards successfully argued against it. Today the lifeguards meet with county parks officials to plead\x{2014}again\x{2014}for help in making the beach safer. They aren't asking for salary hikes; they want more lifeguards, more towers and better lifesaving equipment. They also want a regular and visible police presence. Saturday's clothes-ripping melee took place with a Metro crime suppression team nearby. Still, the teenagers ran wild. \"A combat zone,\" Battenfield said. No arrests were made at the scene; police say they are trying to identify the assailants. On the bright side, at least nobody took a bullet. On March 26, startled Haulover beachgoers watched as one man pulled out a machine gun and shot another, while still a third drew his own pistol and popped off a few rounds. A bystander was shot and wounded as he walked his three children out of the park. Just another day at the beach. If the undertow doesn't get you, the snipers will.",

            "We beat the ambulance by two minutes. The emergency room at Mount Sinai was filling with gray-suited men wearing plastic IDs, and out front were the cops\x{2014}motormen, patrol officers, detectives, SWAT commandos, all with the same haggard look in their eyes. The look of the Grim Wait. The call had gone out as a hostage situation, then a sniper and then this: \"We have two police officers down!\" Racing across the Julia Tuttle Causeway, we'd heard another voice on the radio: \"They're on the way to Sinai. We need a trauma team. We need a trauma team!\" And both of us, the photographer and I, thought the worst. Somebody murdered some cops, we thought. At the emergency room we were told that the number was four. Four police officers shot during\x{2014}what else\x{2014}a drug deal. In the swank Doral Beach Hotel, of all places. In the middle of a dead summer, in the murder capital of America. What exactly had gone wrong was not clear, but it certainly wasn't Crockett andTubbs gliding through a TV bust. Four cops down was life gravely mocking art. It doesn't matter how long you do this sort of thing, the sight of the first ambulance always turns your throat to sandpaper. Because the first ambulance usually is where they put the one who took the worst shot.The first ambulance tells the story\x{2014}just how bad it's going to be. The doors swung open and there lay Detective Jim Mahle. His head was wrapped to cover two bullet holes in the right side of his skull. But one hand was moving. Best of all, he was conscious. Then came Detective Joe White, bearded and shirtless, his white shorts bloodied. His eyes were open and he was holding his own IV bag. Sgt. Mike Lowe, a crimson smear on his forehead, walked into the emergency room on his own. Another ambulance delivered undercover man James Scarberry (\"I'm OK,\" he said), and then came the wounded police informant, pale, and moaning into an oxygen mask. A few minutes later, a woman in a pink outfit gingerly made her way past the police cordon. A reporter asked if she were related to one of the victims. \"No, my daughter just had a baby,\" the woman said, smiling. \"I'm here for a happy occasion.\" Soon a trauma specialist came out to announce that the policemen were going to make it. Miraculously, none of the injuries was life-threatening. Over at the Doral, a man with a mop swabbed the front steps. The place was quiet. \"I got to work and I saw all these cop cars,\" said Rocky Hile, the downstairs bartender. \"I thought they were shooting another episode of MiamiVice. I saw the blood on the steps and I thought: Boy, they really go all out. Then I come in and turn on the news at <<six o'clock|6>> and that's when I found out ... \"I had a guy at the bar earlier tonight who was on the loth floor when it happened. Heard all the shots and thought it was some kind of celebration,\" Rocky said. \"Then the elevator door opens and there's a guy on a stretcher, all covered with blood. It still didn't occur to the guy that somebody had actually been shot. \"Until he got downstairs and saw the SWAT team.\" I thought about that poor tourist\x{2014}gaping at the stretcher in the elevator, finding the elegant lobby taken over by men with automatic weapons. I imagined the fellow turning to his wife and muttering, \"You were right. We should've gone to Epcot Center.\" Or maybe not. Maybe he knew what to expect from the South Florida vacation package: four days-three nights-one shootout. That evening, by the hotel pool, Pfizer and Co. threw a private party attended by trim executives with new golf-course tans. There was an open bar and a twirling ice sculpture of a sailfish. Upstairs, in a suite on the 11th floor, forensic experts hunted for bullet fragments and measured the bloodstains on the carpet.",

            "A new national study reports that South Florida's TV stations spend 27.5 percent of their evening news broadcasts on crime and criminal justice, prompting the obvious question: Is that all? The surprise isn't how much time Miami TV devotes to murder and mayhem, but how little. The average for local <<6 P.M.|5>> news broadcasts was 29.3 percent\x{2014}about 30 seconds more than in the blood-spattered Dade-Broward market. If anything, our stations show uncommon restraint. South Florida being the violent pit it is, TV news directors could easily fill the entire program with local gore. They seldom do. Yet the University of Miami professor who directed the media study laments the findings. \"It's unfortunate,\" said Joe Angotti, \"that body-bag journalism is what local news chooses to focus on at the expense of more important stories.\" Hogwash. What is unfortunate is that there's so much violence that it can't be ignored. Sadly, body-bag journalism reflects a body-bag world. We all worry some about crime because it's touched all of us. Is it not \"important\" news when a two-bit shoplifter guns down a security guard in broad daylight at one of South Florida's busiest shopping malls? How about when four members of a family, including two little children, are slaughtered in their Miramar home? Or when a father, his son and a friend are executed by intruders at an electronics warehouse in West Dade? All that from just a week's worth of police-blotter entries. You see the problem: No other single place can compete with our volume, ferocity and weirdness of crime. Considering the deluge, Miami's TV stations do a decent job of balancing police news with health, education and politics. Some days, it isn't easy. Give viewers a choice between an informative story about a new low-cholesterol diet or a grisly tale about sickos stealing human heads out of crypts, and they'll dial up the cadavers every time. For the crime-content survey, researchers in eight markets studied a half-hour of news broadcasts on four random days. Wow, that's two whole hours of TV in each city\x{2014}and who's calling whom shallow? (Incredibly, the most infamous of our local stations, WSVN-Channel 7, finished third in the body-bag derby. No talk yet of a slander suit.) One hole in the methodology: Only English-speaking TV stations were studied. Another flaw: Only <<6 P.M.|5>> broadcasts were analyzed. Many stations start the news at <<5 P.M.|5>>, and in-depth features often air that first hour. That's not to say some crime stories aren't overplayed and exploited on TV, sometimes disgracefully. It's also true that some are underplayed. In any case, there aren't many news directors who wouldn't love to get more time for school issues, medical breakthroughs, political analysis and I-Team investigations. The problem is, news keeps happening. You can't keep it off the air. To insinuate that crime coverage isn't serious journalism is to repudiate one of the media's essential roles. People want to be safe in their communities, and they deserve to know when they're not. One reason that serious crime fell so sharply in New York is that the media kept a spotlight on it. As for the use of \"sensational video\" decried by Professor Angotti, Anthony Windes probably isn't complaining. He's the Sears guard whose shooting was captured by a store camera. The chilling replay, widely broadcast, is what enabled police to identify the shoplifter who allegedly pulled the trigger. How much more important can TV news be?",

            "Seven long summers ago, Northwest 22nd Avenue was afire in July. People who lived in the James E. Scott housing project lined the sidewalks to throw rocks and bottles and epithets at passing cars. The mood was furious and grieving, an afterburst of the McDuffie riots. Today, if you visit Scott or just about any project in Liberty City, ask the people what has changed in their lives. The answer is sometimes bitter and sometimes resigned, but always the same: Nothing has changed, they say; not a damn thing. The New York Timescould run a 7-year-old photograph of the Scott project and nobody would notice the difference, because there is no difference. Many have tried to do good things, but the lives of most people haven't improved. It's hard to explain how there is so little money for job training or decent housing or black business loans at the same time \$2 million in public funds is being spent on a one-day visit by the pope. Last week, while some folks were hyperventilating about Miami's image in the newspaper, folks in Liberty City were trying to sweat out the deep heat. While civic leaders flew to Manhattan and got rooms at the Waldorf, activist Georgia Ayers stayed here and tried to keep a few youngsters out of jail. She lost no sleep over the Times magazine article. \"I'm not angry about anything they said about Miami,\" she said. \"I hope it shames the hell out of them.\" The ugly, malignant truth is that things are worse in Liberty City and Overtown than they were in 1980 or 1983, when riots broke out. Add to the unemployment, lousy housing, high crime and lost promises a new ingredient for despair: crack cocaine. A block off 62nd Street, lanky dealers hang in pairs on the street corners, with toddlers playing underfoot. Driving through is chilling enough; having to live here is harrowing. The Rev. Barry Young is a former juvenile court bailiff who is now a counselor with Ayers' Alternative Program, which works with first-time criminal offenders. Rev. Young thinks the peace on the streets is brittle and tense. \"The spark is there,\" he said as we pulled into Scott. On a scrubby vacant lot, middle-aged men sat in the shade and watched the cars go by. Counselor Marcia Wallace: \"When you get up at <<7:30 in the morning|2a>> and your father's sitting out there, and when you come home after school at <<3 o'clock|6>> and he's still there \x{2026} \" William Smith: \"There's a lot of people out of a job. Like me, I'm out of a job.\" But he was radiantly proud of his niece, Jarenae, who last year won two trophies and two certificates for scholastic excellence at Drew Junior High. By contrast, a magenta Cadillac cruised 6ist Street\x{2014}brand-new car, the paper tag still taped to the rear window. The driver wasn't more than 17; his passengers even younger. \"Did you see that? Can you believe that?\" Rev. Young said. On a corner across from Gwen Cherry Park, where knee-high kids were running circles in the grass, a young man in a black Jaguar sedan pulled up to do some business with the local retailers. Everyone on the block knew who and what he was; the little ones will, too, someday. Julia Sullivan, 73, has lived two decades in the same Liberty City apartment. From her front door she sees a world that is not much different for her four great-grandchildren than it was for her 20 grandchildren, or her 11 children before that. \"The children need to get off the streets, they need a job,\" Mrs. Sullivan said. \"Sometimes needing and wanting are two different things.\" In the projects, the heat bakes so hard and the air rises so thick that it would seem to leave no strength for picking up a rock or a bottle or a gun. That's what we thought seven years ago, too. Of a shy young ninth-grader, Rev. Young asked: \"What do you want to see change?\" \"Everything,\" the young man said.",

            "The word is riot. Not melee, or disturbance, or incident. If it makes you feel better, go ahead and say it that way. But the word is riot. Whether it lasts five minutes, five hours or five days, the ingredients are the same\x{2014}the fierce combustion of honest passion, confused fury, frustration and idle thuggery. A young man is dead in the street with a police bullet in his head, and all you know is what you hear on the corner, and what you hear on the corner is bad. So there is your spark. What you saw on television the other night you've seen before. And if you were there, in Overtown, there was only one word for what was happening. And it was happening on Martin Luther King Day, of all days. Gunshots. Looting. Cars on fire. Cops under siege. What would you call it\x{2014}a heated dispute? For, oh, how we yearn to minimize this thing, to calibrate it in some way to reassure the tourists and the national media that it isn't as terrible as it was in 1982 or 1980. No, it's not nearly as terrible. Not if you merely add up the dead and wounded, count all the rocks and bottles. Take a quick survey of gutted buildings and charred cars. No, by that measure it's not as terrible as before. Not unless you happen to live there. Then it's worse. On Monday night, troopers blocked the interstate and sealed off the core of the city. On Tuesday morning, civic types downplayed what this will do to Miami's future as a vacation destination. They hoped that the visiting press wouldn't dwell on this isolated \"disturbance\" on the eve of the Super Bowl. Well, screw the football game. This community's problem is slightly more pressing than PR. What good is a shimmering new skyline when the streets below it are bleaker than ever? We've got neighborhoods that in eight years have edged no closer to becoming humane places to raise a family. Neighborhoods with not enough decent housing and not enough decent jobs. And now we've got a new influx of refugees to add to the tension. We also have something we didn't have in 1982 or 1980, something to deepen the cycle of despair and futility. Now we have crack cocaine. In these neighborhoods, some of the first sounds that a child learns to recognize are the flat crack of gunfire and the whine of a police siren. Nearing <<midnight|13>>: We are on the corner of Northwest Second Avenue and 2oth Street. A building has been set aflame and a crowd is gathered outside to watch it go down, and talk about what happened to the young man on the motorcycle, the young man who died. The intersection is clogged with cops and journalists. The fire gives an orange glow to the smoke roiling skyward, a sight that brings back memories. This time around, the cops know the drill of neighborhood containment. This time around, most of the photographers are wearing bulletproof vests. Every time a squad car goes by\x{2014}pump guns bristling from the windows\x{2014}there is the crackle of broken glass on pavement; glass everywhere, just like the last time. Two dumpsters are on fire. Overhead a police helicopter circles the blaze and aims a piercing white eye on the dismal neighborhood. On the corners with the women are children, so many of them, and so small. Many of these kids were not yet born when Arthur McDuffie was beaten to death near the expressway. Some were still in diapers when Nevell Johnson Jr. was shot in the head at a video arcade. Now, barefoot, these children of the new Miami tiptoe around the glass on the street. Gingerly they pick up the small gray cardboard canisters\x{2014}toys for the little ones, souvenirs for teenagers. The labels on the canister say: No. 2 Riot Agent CS Grenade, Continuous Discharge. Manufactured by the Smith & Wesson Chemical Co. Riot agent. Gas. A pungent damp cloud of the stuff rolls down 2oth Street. This time around, the cops and photographers have brought masks. The little children rub their eyes and scurry to get upwind. It is their first whiff of tear gas, but they are learning fast. On these streets, they will have no choice.",

The United States says Petrona should not stay here, that it's safe for her to go home; there is a new government in Guatemala and things are looking up. This week Petrona's deportation trial began in U.S. Immigration Court in Miami. It was a most unusual proceeding. Petrona is a Kanjobal Indian, one of about 800 who have resettled in Indiantown as migrants. She is 26, and partially crippled from a childhood disease. She speaks neither English nor Spanish, only the unique Mayan dialect of her village. The court interpreter, the only one to understand Kanjobal, had learned a language slightly different from Petrona's. Her story, painful to recall under any circumstances, became excruciating in Judge Neale Foster's court. She wore a beautiful Mayan dress and sat impassively on the witness stand. Often she spoke in little more than a shy whisper. She tried to tell how they had practically skinned her father alive. In 1982 Petrona's village, El Mul, was caught in Guatemala's vicious civil war. The guerrillas would raid the rural towns for food and chickens; then the army would sweep in, tracking the insurgents and punishing those thought to have aided them. Defense attorney Peter Upton: \"How do you know there was a war?\" Petrona: \"Because the helicopters came by.\" Q. \"What were the helicopters doing?\" A. \"They were dropping bombs and shooting bullets.\" Later Upton asked: \"Did the soldiers ever kill anyone in your family?\" A. \"They came and killed my father \x{2026} he was taken by them and beaten by them \x{2026} It was <<6 in the morning|5>>. We were sleeping at the time. They broke down the door.\" Petrona said the army men seized her father and two brothers, Esteban and Alonzo, and dragged them away from the others. Alonzo was only 14. Petrona said the soldiers beat them with rifles and hacked them with machetes. She and her mother ran for their lives. After the soldiers had gone, Petrona said, she came back and found her home burned to the ground. Her brothers and father lay dead. Her father's features were \"destroyed.\" His hands had been bound behind him; Petrona untied the rope. In all, 11 men were murdered in El Mul that morning. Petrona said she remembered their names, they were her neighbors: Tomas Augustin, his son Daniel, Miguel Jose, Mateo Martin, Esteban Martin, and so on. After the massacre Petrona eventually fled to Mexico to pick cotton and coffee. From there she made her way to America. She does not fully understand the politics of her country, but what she knows is this: Men with guns came from the hills and invaded her village. They stole her family's food. Other men in uniforms arrived and stole more. They also slaughtered her father. As you might imagine, Petrona does not wish to go home. Kathy Hersh of the American Friends Service Committee says of the Mayans: \"They were really caught in the crossnre.They are apolitical.The government doesn't know what to do with them.\" Six months ago Guatemala elected its first civilian government since 1966.The United States says this is a new leaf, that the military is enlisting \"civil patrols\" to improve its image and help battle insurgents. Unfortunately, more than 700 men and women have been murdered in political violence since the new regime came to power. Petrona seeks asylum here. Her case, and those of other Mayans, probably won't be settled until early next year. The immigration court must decide if the Kanjobales would be singled out for violence if they returned home, if they have a well-founded fear of persecution. What Petrona Mateo Esteban has is simply a well-founded fear of death.",

            "What a great idea for civil disobedience: Let's block an expressway! Brilliant. Let's see how many thousands of working people we can tick off on a sweltering afternoon! Won't that help the cause! The plan is to call attention to the fate of 13 rafters returned to Cuba by the U.S. government. And Monday's mess on State Road 836 did attract all the TV stations, as did Wednesday's multiple street blockades. What the protesters have failed to anticipate is the fierce backlash. An elementary rule of pro test: You don't win public support by antagonizing the public. Those stuck in a man-made traffic morass aren't thinking about rafters or the implications of U.S. immigration policy. They're thinking: Where are the cops? Why aren't these yahoos being hauled away? They're thinking: I'm late for work. I might lose my job. I'm late for court. I'm late for a sales meeting. I'm late for a doctor's appointment. My children are waiting at the day-care center. My mother's waiting at home for her medical prescription. My baby's in the car and it's 95 degrees out here. What do these people think they're doing? All over town, small numbers of Cuban-American protesters are staging \"spontaneous\" traffic blockages. Everyone else is out of patience. The havoc bred rancor, starting at the 836 tollbooth. The public relations damage from such a brainless, inconsiderate stunt is incalculable. Those protesting President Clinton's new Cuba policy are a minority who ought to be trying to win converts, not alienate those who might otherwise be sympathetic. I was a long blessed way from the traffic jams, but I know how drivers felt. What a senseless tragedy if some elderly motorist, trapped between exits, had died from a heart attack or a stroke. Nothing is gained by disrupting the lives and livelihoods of ordinary folks who had nothing to do with the Cuba deal. It's infinitely more logical to hop a bus to Washington, B.C., and block traffic at the White House. Of course, the police there wouldn't be quite so tolerant. That's the irony. Outside of Miami, hardly anybody in the country cares much about what's happening in Cuba. Polls show that more Americans are upset about the admission of the Guantanamo refugees than about the new repatriation policy. In fact, a WPLG-Channel 10 poll reveals similar feelings here in Dade, including a sharp division within the Cuban-American community. The last thing that protesters can afford to do is undermine their support here at home, but that's what they do when they block traffic. It's reckless, pointless and counterproductive. Civil demonstrations are a core part of American democracy, and of the Miami exile movement. Marches and rallies take place frequently, and are almost always well-organized and nonviolent. On Tuesday, a couple of local politicians, to show support for the refugees, got themselves peacefully arrested outside the White House. That's a tradition. Another is the hunger strike, such as the one taking place outside the Herald. Equally irresistible to TV cameras, these protests make their point\x{2014}and they make the <<6 o'clock|6>> news. Meanwhile, nobody's day gets snarled. Nobody's welfare is endangered. Nobody gets stuck in the hot sun. Nobody's fuming and cursing. Nobody's worried sick about their kids, their jobs or their doctor's appointments. There are many ways to keep the passion and anger in political demonstrations without provoking scorn and hostility. All those motorists stranded by protests were plenty angry, but not at Bill Clinton or Fidel Castro.",

            "As I write this, I'm wired to the gills on cocaine. Speeding like a bug-eyed banshee. Flying first-class on the David Crosby Express. That's what urinalysis shows. The only trouble is, I haven't touched any cocaine. Not a single toot. Is the test wrong? Technically, no. But it's not right, either. Here's what happened and why it illustrates a hazard of drug-testing mania. Last week you probably heard about Health IncaTea, a Peruvian product sold in health food stores. Health Inca is an herbal tea made from coca leaves. \"Just one cup leaves you feeling up,\" the box promises. The leaves are purportedly \"decocainized\" to remove the cocaine\x{2014}the same process used for Coca-Cola. However, the Journal of the American Medical Associationrecently reported that Health Inca Tea was not cocaine-free, and that traces of the drug turned up in urine samples of 36 tea drinkers. The amount was quite small and not considered harmful for normal persons (Andean dwellers have been chewing coca leaves for centuries with no ill effects). But, as you might expect, some stooge in California drank 80 tea bags' worth of Health Inca and complained of \"severe agitation.\" Surprise, surprise. The reaction to the journal article was predictable.The DBA and FDA immediately announced plans to reassess the legality of Health IncaTea, and wholesalers yanked crateloads out of circulation. Meanwhile, health food stores were inundated by consumers who generously offered to buy up all remaining coca tea bags (no doubt to keep them from the hands of impressionable youngsters). The controversy was too crazy to pass up. The other day I bought one of the last boxes of Health IncaTea from Beehive Natural Foods in South Miami. Dr. Lee Hearn, a well-known Miami toxicologist and drug expert, offered to test my urine after I drank the tea. Honestly, this is not great stuff. My sister remarked that it smells like old lawn cuttings, and the taste is not dissimilar. The only way to choke it down is with honey. Last Tuesday I drank less than two ounces. A day later I stopped by Dr. Hearn's lab to give a urine sample\x{2014}sure enough, the test revealed minute but detectable traces of a cocaine metabolite. The big experiment began: On Wednesday I drank five cups between <<8:30 P.M.|2a>> and <<11:30 P.M.|2a>> That's 35 ounces of tea. God hasn't invented the bladder that can hold 35 ounces of hot tea, so it was a long night. According to the journal report, each tea bag contains 4.8 milligrams of cocaine. Five tea bags are roughly equivalent to one line of street cocaine. After the first cup, I felt slightly peppy and that's all. Pulse: normal. Frankly, I get more of a buzz from a can of Pepsi. Even after five cups I wasn't exactly hanging from the ceiling by my fingernails. I wasn't grinding my teeth. I wasn't paranoid and I wasn't euphoric. I wasn't even doing my party impression of Robin Leach. What I was, was bloated. Slept like a log. Pulse: normal. The experiment continued: Thursday, <<6 A.M.|5>> Groggily I aimed for the little bottle. Then the ultimate etiquette question of the 1980s: Exactly how does one carry a urine sample? I tried an inside pocket of my coat, but then I thought: What if I get in a messy car accident? People will think I'm bleeding this stuff. Next I tried the glove compartment, but then I thought: What if the top of the bottle comes unscrewed? It would ruin my new ZZTop tape, not to mention the auto warranty. So I put the sample in my briefcase, which contains nothing of value, and drove to Toxicology Testing Service. On Friday Dr. Hearn called with the news: \"A good strong positive.\" Under both the common EMIT drug screen and the more sophisticated gas chromatography mass spectrometry, my urine tested positive. It showed cocaine and two related substances, benzoylecgonine and methylecgonine, the latter in such concentration that the test went off the scale, Dr. Hearn said. \"There was a bunch of cocaine,\" he said. \"We found a complete pattern of someone who uses cocaine \x{2026} a very high positive.\" Except that all I had was coca tea, a legal product, purchased and consumed legally. \"It's not decocainized,\" Dr. Hearn asserted. The amount of cocaine in Health IncaTea probably isn't enough to get you high, he said, adding, \"The only thing it can do is get you in trouble.\" Why? Because many companies and branches of the military automatically fire, discharge or refuse to hire anyone whose urine shows benzoylecgonine. Courts, employers and DUI prosecutors have long recognized this as proof that someone has used illicit cocaine. But, as shown, that's not necessarily so. An expert witness in many drug trials, Dr. Hearn had never heard of Health IncaTea before last week. Most drug labs hadn't. It isn't known how many other such products are floating around. Dr. Hearn plans more tests on the Health Inca brand. When he called the health food store to order a box, the price had jumped from \$7 to \$24\x{2014}the true spirit of free enterprise! I told my boss that I failed the drug test but he refused to fire me, even though it would have made a better ending to the column. The real ending is not so funny. With consternation Dr. Hearn described the current case of a U.S. Air Force man in Panama. The Air Force wants to dump him because his urine tested positive for cocaine. All along, the serviceman has insisted that he's never used the drug. What he has done, he says, is drink a blend of coca tea, purchased regularly (and legally) at a small Panama shop. Last week Dr. Hearn called Air Force investigators and told them to go find a box of that tea. This time it's not a lark. This time a man's career is at stake.",

            "Recent news stories have exposed another harrowing menace to tourists. Giant rogue barracudas are leaping from the sea to mangle unsuspecting boaters, then flopping back into the water to resume their diabolical stalk. Could it be true! The first attack happened July 9 in Islamorada. A 46-year-old Tampa woman was badly lacerated after a barracuda rocketed from the depths of Florida Bay and knocked her to the deck of a houseboat. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the fish was probably jumping, as barracudas often do, in an attempt to rid itself of an angler's hook. That somewhat pertinent possibility escaped mention in the first news accounts, which depicted the incident as a bizarre and premeditated assault. Best of all, the length of the deranged barracuda was soberly reported as eight feet\x{2014}the supernatural equivalent of, say, a 90-pound squirrel. By the time this newspaper delved into the fish story, it was too late to stem the hype. The barracuda's victim had granted an exclusive interview to ABC's Good Morning America, so an entire breakfasting nation got to hear the terrifying tale and view the actual sutures. For those of us who have devoted our lives to scaring people away from Florida, it was a magic moment. In the past, periodic creature attacks\x{2014}sharks, gators, snakes, etc.\x{2014}rated attention mainly from breathless local TV anchors and junky tabloid shows. But this was the big time! This was a legitimate network program embracing the legend of the mutant barracuda and beaming it into millions of households. You can't put a price on that kind of publicity. And almost immediately the phones began to jangle with reports of other horrifying attacks. An Alabama man, fishing in Bradenton, was said to have incurred minor wounds when struck by a leaping 'cuda. A wire-service account quoted a \"shark expert\" in Gainesville as saying the incident was \"an amazing fluke. I've never even heard of [barracudas] jumping out of the water.\" Not in Gainesville, anyway. The fact is, barracudas are adroit jumpers, especially in pursuit of bait fish. The theory that they would utilize this talent to terrorize tourists is intriguing, but far-fetched. Seasoned fishermen and charter captains crack up at the notion of a killer 'cuda, stealthily circling a boatload of pink-skinned visitors who peer innocently into the brine, adjusting their rented snorkels for that first, fateful dive ... Yet I would urge native Floridians not to rush forward and punch holes in such a valuable myth. If people choose to believe that a primordial genetic code has gone haywire, and that a normally indifferent ocean species has turned savagely against humans (particularly those visiting from out-of-town), then by all means let them believe it. To intervene with dull facts would only squander a prime opportunity. The appetite for weird Florida news is obviously so insatiable that the national media is ready to jump on any story, no matter how flimsy. We must ride the momentum, and keep the barracuda panic alive. Keep the calls and letters coming. It's been years since Jaws was a hit, but lots of people still carry a phobia about sharks. The 'cuda scare has even greater potential because the \"attacks\" occur out of the water. No one would be safe from flying barracudas. A splash, a gleam of silver\x{2014}and suddenly a volleyballer on South Beach is scalped, mid-spike. Two lovers, minced beyond recognition during a <<midnight|13>> stroll on the jetty. A tawny young rollerblader, brutally truncated while skating along a seawall. Would it ever end? For God's sake, somebody do something. Somebody call Spielberg.",

            "Thousands of tourists are being deprived of one of South Florida's greatest cultural treasures, the nightly newscast on WSVN-Channel 7. To protest the station's preoccupation with crime, some hotels have begun blocking WSVN's news from their guests' rooms. This stringent step is being taken to guard the tender sensibilities of visitors, in the same way that grown-ups lock the cable box so the kids won't sneak a peek at the Playboy Channel. The Continental Cos., which owns several local hotels, declared that it was fed up with WSVN's nightly dose of violent video. Another hotelier complained that tourists \"look at Channel 7, and they're afraid to go out on the street.\" So what? Many folks who live here are afraid to go out on the streets, and it's got nothing to do with Channel 7. It's that evening lullaby of semiautomatic gunfire and police sirens that tends to discourage social excursions in some neighborhoods. True, on a slow news day, anchor Rick Sanchez can make a routine domestic shooting sound like a sniper attack on an orphanage. But any out-of-towner who doesn't recognize silly hype when he sees it deserves to be scared out of his trousers. Queasy tourists we don't need. Give us the tough ones. The wily and the battle-hardened. The adventurers. The hotels' contention that one reckless TV station can frighten off business is a backhanded compliment to Channel 7's cold-blooded programming strategy; people do watch. On the other hand, there are nights when even MacNeil-Lehrer scares the hell out of me. The world can be a scary place. Whether they're from Oshkosh or Oslo, most of our tourists aren't easily intimidated. Gun battle on South Beach? No problem. Tonight we'll go to the Grove. Whatever horrors might appear on the TV screen at <<six|9c:1>> and <<eleven|9k:0>>, these intrepid travelers won't waste their precious vacations cowering in a \$150 hotel room. They will put on bright telltale clothes. They will go outdoors. They will spend money. Unless they've been living in a cave for the last 15 years, would-be tourists are well aware that Florida has guns, drugs, nuts and social unrest. To shield them completely from the daily flow, hotels would be forced to zap all local news off the cable. Channel 7 merely offers a more elaborate smorgasbord than the others. Sure, it's everything the critics say it is\x{2014}sensationalistic, lubricious and irresponsibly gruesome. If Jeffrey Dahmer lived here, Channel 7 undoubtedly would be his favorite station. Yet its hard-gore news format has drawn good ratings, worldwide press attention and imitators around the country. Like it or not, Channel 7 is famous. That's why hotels such as the Grand Bay in the Grove and the Pier House in Key West shoot themselves in the cash register by yanking Rick Sanchez off the cable: Channel 7 itself has become an exotic tourist attraction, to be mentioned in the same breath as Parrot Jungle or Everglades National Park. People who come to South Florida expect to see blood, and Channel 7 is often the only place they can find it. Take that away, and you've got some mighty disappointed tourists. Forget the cheap souvenirs. They want lurid anecdotes of shopping-mall shootouts and Dumpster dismemberments to take back home. Otherwise, what's the point of risking a vacation in Miami? If hotel owners were smart, they wouldn't take the Channel 7 newscast off the tube. They'd put it on Spectravision and charge \$7.50 to see it, just like they do with slasher movies.",

            "The Mole People finally adjourned in Tallahassee, emerging squinty-eyed into the sunshine where they are now posing, partying and nearly wrenching their arms patting themselves on the back. Having committed their largest deeds behind closed doors, the legislators of the great state of Florida would now like you to know what a valiant effort they've made on your behalf. They passed the biggest tax increase in state history, set up a lottery, and agreed to spend millions more on prisons, indigent health care and water cleanup. They also passed laws that will legally put handguns into the fists of more drunks, half-wits and fruitcakes than ever before. Despite so-called \"safeguards,\" the Legislature will have no more success keeping licensed pistols from lunatics than it does keeping bad drivers off the highways. In other ways it was a progressive session because\x{2014}like them or not\x{2014}new taxes are the only way to start paying for Florida's explosive growth. The scary part is that the average voter has practically no say in how these revenues will be spent, or who'll get their paws on the money. Years ago Florida passed its famous Sunshine Laws, ostensibly to take the business of government out of the cloakrooms and corridors. At the time a reform-minded Legislature boldly voted that all meetings of public bodies be held in the open\x{2014}except, naturally, those of the Legislature itself. The law that makes it illegal for members of a city council or a school board or a county commission to meet secretly doesn't apply to your faithful representatives in Tallahassee, who this year had their way with \$18.7 billion of your money. How did they do it? We're not exactly sure, since they wouldn't let us in. True, floor sessions and regular committee meeting are wide open to the press and public, but the real lawmaking doesn't happen there. It happens in private. Take the controversial new sales tax on services, for instance. It wasn't negotiated on the floor in view of the gallery. It was drafted over beer and pizza at the Tallahassee townhouse of Bob Coker, a lobbyist for a Big Sugar firm. Among those joining the House and Senate leaders in the late-night festivities were key aides to Gov. Bob Martinez. You remember Bob Martinez, that fellow who campaigned vigorously on a promise of no secret meetings? Remember his indignant TV ads, showing arrogant cracker legislators slamming the door in the public's face? Apparently the governor is not so indignant now. For a brief moment this session a few senators rebelled. They proposed an amendment that would have required legislators to meet in the open at all times, even when jawboning with the governor. You can imagine the rapture with which this idea was greeted. Senate Rules Chairman Dempsey Barren and Senate President John Vogt (the King and Crown Prince of the Mole People) snuffed the Sunshine amendment as quickly as possible. Later Sen. Larry Plummer of South Miami pointedly offered a new version that would have opened all governmental sessions, including \"<<midnight|13>> meetings over pepperoni pizza or anything else.\" This, too, was flattened by Vogt's gavel. Think about what it means. These are people who work for you, and whose salaries you pay\x{2014}yet they won't let you watch what they're doing. It's like having the Maytag repairman lock you out of your own house until he's finished fiddling with your appliances. Admittedly, cutting deals is a part of the legislative process that's easier done in a tunnel than on TV But if nothing sleazy is going on, then what's the harm in letting the public see? Martinez says gee whiz, he'd just love to open all the meetings, really he would\x{2014}but those darn legislators just won't go along. It sounds like the governor's eyes have already adjusted to the dark.",

            'One way to save Florida tons of money, and loads of embarrassment, would be to abolish the Senate. No one would miss these bunglers, who are stinking up Tallahassee with their rotten, self-serving politics. While the state rapidly goes broke, senators remain pathologically obsessed with redistricting. Translation: saving their own sorry butts. Republicans want more Republican districts, Democrats want to cling to what they\'ve got. The logjam has paralyzed government. On Tuesday, the Senate froze <<20-20|5a:1>> on a vote to adjourn. That\'s how bad things are. Voters aren\'t the only ones to be nauseated. Last week, a panel of federal judges intervened to snatch redistricting powers from the Legislature. Barring a last-minute miracle at the Capitol, boundaries for new legislative and congressional districts will be drawn by a nonpartisan expert, and ratified by the judges in late May. That\'s the best news Floridians could get. It\'s painfully clear that politicians can\'t be trusted with such important matters. To appreciate the Senate\'s miserably irresponsible performance, look no farther than its president, Gwen Margolis, a Democrat from North Dade. Margolis is full of ambition. She wants to run for Congress in one of two new districts that will be mostly Hispanic. At the same time, she doesn\'t want to give up her power base in North Dade and Miami Beach. So what does she do? She tailors a new congressional district to fit her desired demographics. To an untrained eye, the proposed boundaries look like the etchings of a mapmaker on heavy pharmaceuticals. In reality, it\'s a masterpiece of diabolical gerrymandering. The Margolis Magical Mystery Tour starts in South Beach and steam-rolls up the coast to Hallandale. There it shrinks weirdly to a one-block-wide corridor, sneaks up to Dania, darts back down to Pembroke Park, hopscotches west to Miramar, slithers south to Hialeah, then angles sharply toward Sweetwater. From there the boundary meanders east, grazing Little Havana and parts of Over town on its journey back to the Miami River. Nobody said the road to Congress was easy, but this is ridiculous. Some of Margolis\' colleagues don\'t like the map, and now it\'s a bargaining point: Republicans won\'t approve the new congressional boundaries unless she approves more GOP seats in the Legislature. The Senate has fought to an impasse. Seeking compromise, seven Democrats recently endorsed a congressional map drawn by Common Cause, a citizens\' lobby. Margolis rejected the plan because it put her in the same district with Dante Fascell, who\'s not about to surrender his seat. Margolis isn\'t the only one playing games. Members of both parties are consumed by fear that redistricting will put them out of office, or stack them against a formidable opponent. They all want a clear, breezy path to re-election. If only they\'d spend half as much time, energy and imagination trying to fix the budget. Instead it\'s the raw, greedy politics of self-preservation. While the Senate snivels and stalls, our schools run out of money. New prisons remain unopened. Hospitals cut back vital services to the poor. It\'s a disgrace, but neither Margolis nor the others seem the least bit ashamed. With the feds drawing up the new districts, she probably won\'t be getting that free ride to Congress in November. That means her amazing psychedelic map will go to waste. Perhaps voters can think of a suitable place for her to put it.',

As they capered and grinned and blew kisses at the courtroom cameras, I couldn't help but wonder if steroids destroy brain tissue. Imagine: You're a young policeman. You are hauled out of your home in the wee hours, handcuffed, fingerprinted and hustled bleary-eyed into the Dade County Jail like a bum. You are accused of a triple homicide, of racketeering, of stealing cocaine and selling it on the street, of using your badge and oath as instruments of crime. You are accused of being the worst thing that a cop can be\x{2014}crooked. Yet when you and your weightlifter pals go to court the next morning, what emotion do you display while the whole city is watching? Arrogance.You mug for the cameras, laughing and joking while every good and decent cop on the streets feels a hot knot tightening in the gut. The feeling is shame. But you don't have any. So you and your buddies cling to the macho routine. Hire a big-shot lawyer and wait for bail. Act like it's no sweat. Act like you're not afraid. Disco all the way to the slammer. What a way for 1985 to end. It really was a rotten year for integrity. Don't let anyone try to say South Florida's police corruption is no worse than any other metropolis, because they're wrong. No place else comes close. Consider the local cavalcade of stars this past 12 months: A DBA agent goes to jail for peddling computer secrets to dopers; three Customs agents are indicted in a pot smuggling ring; an FBI man pleads guilty to accepting cocaine kickbacks; a Metro-Dade officer is charged as a home-invasion robber; a Hialeah cop plea-bargains a seven-year term for his role in a cold-blooded drug execution; a Miami officer awaits trial for allegedly offering to sell badges and guns to drug dealers. Now this latest milestone: Eight current or former Miami policemen busted in the past week for a smorgasbord of drug crimes, including the ever-popular trafficking of cocaine. One of them, his pockets stuffed with \$ i, 180 cash, fled from fellow officers in a red Porsche, thus ratifying every cheap Miami cliche. Police Chief Clarence Dickson called the arrests \"a total positive,\" and city leaders were quick to praise the department's housecleaning. \"Housecleaning\" seems a polite term for what's going on. This is not some teensy boo-boo, but a scandal of monstrous dimensions. Arrests were overdue and welcome, but they were not the result of Miami police simply washing their own dirty laundry. The pressure was external and intense: Investigators from Metro-Dade homicide, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and DEA have been swarming all over the place for weeks. Something was bound to break. Still, Dickson's cooperation and determination to help solve the Miami River murders are encouraging. I know some cities where it never would have happened, where outside investigators would have hit a wall of hostility. The Key West police force, once a rat's nest of corruption, was famous for this kind of obstruction. So now a few Miami cops are in jail, but a celebration is premature. Much more is yet to unravel. The full story of what happened last July 27 at the dock of the Mary C is bound to be chilling. No one there was a Boy Scout. Three of them wound up floaters, snagged on a gaff. Unfortunately, the criminal charges go beyond this one <<midnight|13>> episode. They portray a violent network of cocaine thuggery, a mob in blue. The upcoming testimony will not likely calm the nerves next time you see a flashing light in the rearview mirror. The trial process will be tedious, and feature some of Miami's top defense lawyers. We'll be hearing a lot about how the three dead guys in the river were nothing but low-life drug dealers, how the witnesses against the police are nothing but liars and scoundrels, how Messrs. Estrada, Garcia, Rodriguez and Co. are nothing but innocent scapegoats. In dope cases such strategy is predictable, and sometimes effective. It can also be justified. In any event, you can bet that the Merry Weight-lifters will be the picture of restraint in the jury's presence. Convicting a policeman of any crime is difficult, and there are precious few prosecutors who can't be eaten alive by defense attorneys of Roy Black's caliber. Don't be surprised if some of the cops are acquitted.",

            "It was many months ago that 60 Minutes arrived to do a segment on Broward Sheriff Nick Navarro. The sheriff reacted as he always does at the prospect of seeing himself on TV\x{2014}with joyous gusto. Navarro is a publicity junkie, and the idea of appearing on America's most popular (and serious) news show must've sent him into ecstasy. Sure, he's bosom buddies with Geraldo Rivera, but nobody takes Geraldo seriously. 60 Minutes is the big leagues. A prime-time puff piece would guarantee Navarro's re-election. But now the picture's gone bad. The Broward Sheriffs Office is the target of a federal investigation into corruption and influence-peddling. The press, which has given Slick Nick such a sweet ride for so long, now snarls at his throat. Even worse for Navarro, the 60 Minutes producers are reshaping, if not reconsidering, their profile of the dapper sheriff. By the time it's over, the 2 Live Crew fiasco will look like comic relief. Ironically, Navarro's own pathological itch for self-promotion is what caused some of his problems. Back in 1986, the sheriff was too eager to help Geraldo Rivera find a target for a prime-time drug bust. BSO chose a coke dealer named Nelson Scott. After complaining for years about Scott's activities, neighbors were glad to see him finally arrested. Why it took so long was something of a mystery, until Scott started talking. He testified that he'd been paying off deputies with cash, dope and hookers. A BSO investigation discounted Scott's charges, but the feds are listening to him now. The scandal has other dimensions. Agents are exploring the lifestyles of some of the sheriffs top guys. <<One|9k:0>>, Ron Cacciatore, managed to build a \$69,000 home on a captain's salary. Cacciatore has said his family inherited some money and invested wisely. He was seen socializing with a fugitive smuggler in the Bahamas, but has insisted he didn't know the man's true identity. Another focal point is Navarro's friendship with auto dealer Jim Moran, the sheriffs most generous campaign contributor. Recently Moran sold BSO a fleet of used cars at new-car prices. Once Navarro hired one of Moran's security men as a BSO commander, even though the man, James Burkett, had failed a polygraph when asked about drug crimes. Burkett recently was convicted of lying to U.S. agents about a marijuana operation. He was sentenced to 21 months. The rain of subpoenas is enough to make Navarro's hair turn from white to black. All involved have denied any wrongdoing, while the sheriff clings to the Nixon defense: Bad things might've happened, but I sure didn't know about 'em. No, Mr. Tough Guy Sheriff was too busy busting rap musicians to pay attention to what was going on inside his own department. Now he's got a mess that will not stop stinking before the '92 election. The media, which had been Navarro's pliant co-conspirators for so long, are now lambasted for their \"feeding frenzy.\" To scoff at Navarro's past grandstanding is to underestimate his shrewdness. Over the years he has hyped himself into a national personality; he is far more widely known and recognized than his low-key Dade counterpart, Police Director Fred Taylor. Even Broward commissioners have been intimidated by Navarro's silky celebrity\x{2014}they've inflated the BSO budget to an outlandish \$197 million a year. For reasons still unclear to taxpayers, the sheriff now employs about 3,200 people. As much as he'd love to duck responsibility for the BSO scandal, Navarro can't. It's his own top, hand-picked men who are in trouble\x{2014}not the rank-and-file deputies. These days, the sheriffs moth-like frenzy for the kleig lights has abated. The true test will come if 60 Minutes calls again. Can Nick resist the urge to face the cameras, to beam his suave visage into 2.0 million American homes? Probably not. He who lives by the tube, dies by the tube.",

            "Tips for tourists and visiting journalists who are having trouble keeping track of Miami's mayors: The current mayor and former ex-mayor, Joe Carollo, is fondly known as Crazy Joe. He occupies City Hall. The former mayor and current ex-mayor, Xavier Suarez, is fondly known as Mayor Loco. He occupies a mystic parallel universe. The current mayor was restored to office after courts agreed that widespread ballot fraud had corrupted the November elections. The current ex-mayor has vowed to regain the post with a multipronged legal assault. The battle promises to drag on, bitterly dividing Miami. That's why a parallel universe is useful. While Carollo returns to the lugubrious chore of trying to balance the city's threadbare budget, Suarez's supporters can go on pretending he was wrongly deposed by a sinister cabal that includes the governor, law enforcement, the English-speaking media and the entire judicial system. Having two different Miamis and two different mayors isn't so weird, when viewed in a psycho therapeutic context. Experts say fantasizing can be a healthy escape from extreme stress. And these days few places are more extreme or stressed out than Miami\x{2014}hobbled by debt, humiliated by Wall Street, shamed by graft and scandalized by flagrant thievery at the polls. Denial is an understandable reaction to such grim reality, though the breadth of Suarez's denial is notable. Imagine a frothy make-believe world in which the city's image glistens, the budget is in rock-solid shape, the elections are honorably conducted and normal behavior includes driving around and surprising people at their homes after dark. That's the whimsical parallel universe in which the current ex-mayor dwells. Almost two weeks ago he showed up unexpectedly on the doorstep of the former ex-mayor. Carollo said Suarez came to confront him about charges that furniture had disappeared from City Hall after Suarez's exit. Carollo said Suarez was jabbering away, upsetting the children. \"He made no sense,\" the former ex-mayor said. \"We just wanted to get this man, the best way we could, out of our front door and out of our property.\" However, in Suarez's parallel universe the trip to the Carollo homestead went very smoothly. \"Cordial,\" is the way the current ex-mayor recalled it. \"A nice, nice discussion.\" He saw nothing rude or inappropriate about his unannounced visit, which is one of the fringe benefits of living in a fantasy world\x{2014}there's no such thing as bad manners. Sometimes the two universes do converge in potentially dangerous ways. A few months before becoming ex-mayor, Suarez made that infamous late-night sojourn to the home of a feisty Little Havana constituent who'd criticized him in a letter. Alarmed at the knocking on her door, the woman (who obviously did not live in the same world as Suarez) picked up a handgun and peeped outside. Luckily for the future ex-mayor, the woman recognized him and held her fire. Since then Suarez has made other surprise nocturnal jaunts, not all of them publicized. He is becoming Miami's own <<midnight|13>> rambler, in both the itinerant sense and the verbal sense. This week an appellate panel declined to reconsider his plea for reinstatement. In a parallel universe, that could mean the judges are part of the secret anti-Suarez conspiracy. It also could mean that, one of these nights, the judges might hear a stranger at the back door; a stranger who quickly engages them in \"cordial\" discussion. The only thing to do is nod politely, and pretend it all makes sense. Because, in some eerie faraway world, it must.[\"chapter_10\"] Our Leaders on Parade",

            "When investigators tailed Dade building inspectors on daily rounds, they saw: a roofing inspector who never climbed a ladder the whole time; an electrical inspector who goofed off at a bowling alley; an elevator inspector who spent county time napping at the library. Construction was certified on some projects using the convenient drive-by method, so the inspector never had to leave the comfort of his car. Other work was approved, site unseen. The Dade grand jury says the Building and Zoning Department is often more devoted to helping the construction industry than protecting the public from sleazy contractors. It's virtually the same conclusion that another grand jury reached in 1976. Nothing ever changes. Only four years ago, an undercover cop posing as a building inspector collected thousands of dollars in \"gifts\" from local contractors. Detectives said it was business as usual. Efforts to weed out the crooks and deadbeats have been stymied. Just last week, prosecutors mysteriously declined to provide the names of those few inspectors whose antics were exposed in the most recent probe. This means they're still on the job\x{2014}or at least pretending to be. If only they kept a journal ... <<8 A.M.|5>> Drove out to Old Cutler Shady-Lakes-On-the-Bay Estates for a thorough inspection. The cement is still slightly mushy, but what can you expect after only six weeks? When I got back to the car, I discovered someone had dropped an envelope with \$500 on the front seat. Must be my lucky day! <<8:07 A.M.|2a>> Drove out to New Cutler Meadows-Near-the-Bay to check on complaints of substandard work. Everything looked jim-dandy to me. I leaned my golf bag against several walls, and not one fell down. While I was checking the place over, someone put two first-class plane tickets to Bermuda on the windshield of my car. Some sort of sweepstakes, I guess. Talk about luck! <<9-10 A.M.|5a:1>> Stopped by library to check the stocks in the Wall Street Journal. Blue chips look strong, but I'm thinking about dumping IBM while it's riding high. Also, I wonder if I went too heavy into tax-free munis. <<10:15 A.M.|2a>> Drove out to Green Cutler Gardens Somewhat-Near-the-Bay to check on reports of inferior drywall. Another false alarm: Every wall I inspected was dry as a bone. When I got back to the car, I found a new gold Rolex Submariner on the front seat. Too bad I've already got one. <<10:30|2>>-<<Noon|13>>. Stopped at the bowling alley to see how the ceiling struts were holding up after 23 years. Just by coincidence, the All-Dade Hooters Waitress League was having a tournament, so I stayed to watch\x{2014}just to make sure they weren't injured by any falling beams. <<12:15 P.M.|2a>> Ran into the new guy, Mario, on a site for that new nursing home. Get this\x{2014}he was actually up on a ladder, checking out some piddly leak in the roof. A ladder! I nearly busted a gut laughing. Told him he should've been a fireman. <<12:30 P.M.|2a>> Tried to inspect the New World Old Cutler Financial Plaza-In-the-Bay but traffic was lousy and it started to drizzle. Just so happened I could see the structure perfectly from Hooters, where I'd stopped for a late lunch. So I used my binoculars to count the floors: forty-two, right on the button! As I was phoning in my inspection, somebody broke into my car and left a deed to a three-bedroom condo in Cozumel. Not only that, they were considerate enough to put it in a third-party offshore trust! <<1:55 P.M.|2a>>Went out to Rolling Cutler Hills Nowhere-Near-the-Bay Estates for a final inspection, and all 1,344 units checked out fine\x{2014}at least they looked pretty darn nice from the car. As I drove past, someone lobbed a tooled-leather valise in the front seat. Just a guess, but it looks like it might contain \$25,000 in nonsequential unmarked bills. What a day I'm having! <<2:11 P.M.|2a>> Holy cow, where did the time go? The wife is probably worried sick. Still, I ought to swing by the bowling alley once more to double check those struts.",

            "We didn't need Nostradamus to predict this one: <<After 2|9:0>> 1/2 years of so-called investigation, the Dade State Attorney's Office has found nobody to prosecute for the shabby construction of the Country Walk subdivision, blown to twigs by Hurricane Andrew. Residents are disheartened but not stunned, given the state's record in ducking these cases. Lennar Homes similarly was let off the hook for its crackerbox construction. Now it's Arvida/JMB Partners and the Walt Disney Co., which owned Country Walk when much of the subdivision was built. Goofy, Pluto and the other construction supervisors are yukking it up today. Who can forget Country Walk, Land of the Flying Gables\x{2014}trusses without braces, braces without nails, corners without brackets. Of 184 homes, 147 were deemed uninhabitable after Andrew. Initially, Arvida blamed Mother Nature, the standard alibi following the hurricane. Yet independent reviews of the destruction in South Dade cited shoddy work, dumb designs, substandard materials and lax code enforcement. Still, nobody is going to jail. The State Attorney's Office says it cannot prove criminal wrongdoing at Country Walk, though the term \"insufficient evidence\" seems hollow to those who were knee-deep in it on Aug. 24, 1992. The companies probably lost no sleep worrying about an indictment. What really grabbed their attention were the lawsuits. These days it's fashionable to rail about runaway litigation. A key conservative plank is \"tort reform,\" meant to discourage private citizens from suing big companies. Yet that was the only remedy for customers of Lennar and Arvida who were wiped out by the hurricane. Suing was the only way to get compensation, and settlements provided that. Insurance companies are also in court with Arvida and Disney over the Country Walk debacle. This is good if it discourages flimsy house building. The larger the cash penalty, the greater the incentive for companies to be more diligent next time. Eventually, corner-cutting developers will sit down with a calculator and figure out that Andrew was bad for the bottom line. While it's great to sell scads of houses, it's not good business when scads of customers and their insurance companies sue your pants off. Homeowners were left with few options. The building industry obviously didn't police itself, while government failed at every step in its obligation to protect consumers from such a preventable tragedy. Plied by campaign donations from developers, Dade politicians made scarcely a peep as the South Florida Building Code was watered down. Even then it wasn't well-enforced. And those who violated or corrupted it seldom got punished. So that left the civil courts as the only forum where Arvida, Lennar and the others could be held accountable. The State Attorney's Office admitted as much. In explaining why it took so long to complete the Country Walk probe, the lead investigator said he was \"waiting to see if the civil litigation revealed any smoking guns.\" Good thing they don't handle murder cases that way. For home buyers, the lesson is simple but cynical. If you're looking for a safely built house or condominium, expect no trustworthy safeguards from the state or county. And expect no action when gross abuses come to light. The way to avoid heartache in the next hurricane is to avoid living in cheesy cardboard subdivisions. Judging by the houses that endured Andrew's worst winds, good builders are out there. The trick is finding them. Start with the ones who aren't tied up in court.",

            "The hottest vacation package in Florida is being offered by the city of Miami, which is paying its top brass big bucks to stay in town. It's such a good deal that you wonder why every little kid doesn't want to grow up and be a faithful public servant. The trick is to store up as much \"accrued vacation time\" as possible. The longer you do this, the more money you get at retirement. Why? Because the city, in all its fiscal wisdom, will pay you for any unused vacation hours at your current top salary scale. It doesn't matter if you piled up the time 10 years ago while making \$10 an hour. If you're now earning \$20 an hour, that's the rate at which you get reimbursed. How big-hearted can a bureaucracy be! This vacation gig is better than an IRA account.Throw in pensions and sick time and you've got yourself a healthy nest egg. With this kind of incentive, it's no surprise that so many city executives claim they go for years without taking time off. You've got to feel sorry for these tireless souls, toiling at their desks day after day while each summer their pals trundle off to Disney World or Six Flags or Knott's Berry Farm. As a matter of fact, it might be instructive to locate and publish the time sheets of these working-class heroes\x{2014}not to test their memories, mind you, but merely to give inspiration to new employees. The all-work, no-play mentality is so pervasive at City Hall that Miami now has \$9.5 million of accrued vacation time on its payroll. Alarmed, the city manager wants to pay some of this in lump sums now, instead of letting the money build up until workers reach retirement. Under this voluntary payback program, the city has already delivered some handsome checks. Assistant budget director Frank May got \$25,085 for 894 hours of unused vacation\x{2014}no days, 109 nights in beautiful Miami. Deputy City Attorney Robert Clark cashed in <<100 hours|1>> at more than \$45 an hour. Finance director Carlos Garcia collected 263.5 hours at more than \$36 an hour. And budget director Manohar Surana got about \$42 an hour for 286 hours of unused vacation. (His \$87,000-plus salary is almost as high as that of his New York City counterpart.) One of the biggest winners was internal audit director Sujan Chhabra. For 18 weeks of vacation time he received nearly \$30,000, which, city officials say, he needed for a new house. Interestingly, only Miami's highest-paid honchos are eligible for this exciting program. City sanitation workers are limited to <<100 hours|1>> of accrued vacation while many other general employees are allowed no more than 180 hours. City Manager Cesar Odio himself has racked up 11 weeks of unused vacation during his seven years as a Miami employee. If he elected to cash in now (which he says he won't), Odio would be paid at his current salary rate of about \$44.23 an hour\x{2014}or \$20,125. However, if he waited 10 years and retired from the same job at the same pay, his accumulated vacation time could be worth \$45,000 cash, or more. If, as Odio says, the early vacation payback will save the public money, then perhaps he ought to set an example by doing it himself. As long as it's optional, some employees will continue to hoard their hours and cash out at retirement. What would really save money is to require workers to take all their vacation the year they earn it. This radical policy is enforced at most private companies because the other method is not only ridiculously expensive, but counterproductive to healthy work habits. Some people might even say it would be more sensible if all city workers with accrued vacation (no matter how much) were forced to take it right now\x{2014}say, starting this morning. Just hop a plane and go away for a while. Don't come back until your vacation is used up. But think of what this would mean: The big shots at City Hall would be gone for weeks and weeks. Why, there would be no one to sit around and dream up these rackets. How would we ever get by?",

            "The bad news: Vanquished Port of Miami chief Carmen Lunetta will receive a golden parachute of \$328,501 cash, in addition to his \$113,000-a-year pension. The good news: Some lawyer will probably get most of it. Lunetta leaves the busy cruise port awash in a \$22 million red tide and a stinking scandal. His hefty cash severance includes unused sick pay, vacation and holidays accrued over Lunetta's 38 years with the county. If he'd spent less time at the office, perhaps the port wouldn't be in so much trouble. Lunetta hastily resigned Friday after the Herald obtained records detailing one of the artifices through which Dade taxpayers were robbed. For years, a stream of public funds was routed through a company called Fiscal Operations, which controls the port's gantry cranes. The firm was headed by Calvin Grigsby, a rich San Francisco political wheeler-dealer. It turns out that Miami's port paid for Calvin's California yacht, and maid service to keep it spiffy. The port also paid for Calvin's Super Bowl seats, country club membership and symphony subscription. It even paid a parking ticket. The port not only gave Calvin a \$75,000 salary as president of Fiscal Operations, it paid him \$300 an hour to give legal advice to his own company. Then it paid the company a \$150,000 \"management fee.\" Meanwhile, Fiscal Operations secretly funneled thousands in campaign funds to Democratic candidates and local commissioners. Along the way, the crane-operating firm fell behind on \$24 million in payments and interest to the port\x{2014}money that will never be collected. This sheds fresh light on the agency's embarrassing debt. All these Grigsby boondoggles had to be approved by port boss Lunetta. The mystery is: Why was he so generous to Calvin, and what did he get in return? Some inquiring soul ought to pose those questions today, if Lunetta appears as scheduled before the Metro Commission. Lots of cash went streaking through Fiscal Operations, and investigators might never be able to track it all. The probe is another unhappy tiding for Grigsby, already implicated in the Operation Greenpalm corruption investigation. The FBI has videotape of Grigsby and Metro Commissioner James Burke, allegedly chatting about a \$300,000 kickback. Agents believe the payment was to be made in exchange for Burke steering a piece of Dade's municipal bond business to Grigsby's investment firm. As expected, both fellows heartily deny any wrongdoing. Grigsby has retained the services of O. J. Simpson defense ace Johnnie Cochran. Lunetta ought to take a cue. Lots of big-name lawyers would be be eager to offer counsel, especially after ogling that humongous severance package. When \$328,000 is on the other end of the line, even F. Lee Bailey picks up the phone. The size of Lunetta's golden parachute shows he was assiduous about logging his own attendance at work. If only he'd been half as careful with the port's budget, the place might actually be turning a profit. Lunetta had help with the ransacking. Dade commissioners regularly dipped into port funds to pay for pet projects. Still, it isn't easy losing money on the world's busiest commercial sea harbor. You've really got to work at it. Records show that Lunetta put in for 301 accumulated sick days, <<500 hours|1>> of unused vacation and salary for showing up on 68 1/2 county holidays. Who knows how much of that time was spent serving the port, and how much of it was spent disbursing the public's money to Calvin Grigsby and other secret pals.",

            "For those wondering how long it would take the new Metro Commission to start throwing money away, the wait is over: \$20 million for auto racing in Homestead. The 11\x{2014}1 vote came last Tuesday at <<midnight|13>>, when public attendance was conveniently at a minimum. It brought to \$31 million the total that Grand Prix hustler Ralph Sanchez has charmed from the county commission since October. It's his biggest jackpot ever. Who needs telethons when you've got such softhearted politicians? Sanchez and Homestead City Manager Alex Muxo had no trouble selling the outlandish proposition that South Dade's hurricane recovery should be anchored by a private racetrack, to be used for only three or four major events a year. Behind-the-scenes players included two longtime Sanchez cohorts, lobbyists Ron Book and Sergio Pereira. Pereira is an old hand at frittering public funds. As county manager, he once spent \$9,400 on a new desk. The Sanchez giveaway comes from a sports tax on hotel beds. Muxo raided the same kitty before; the result is an empty \$12 million baseball stadium. Now Homestead wants racing, even though Sanchez's track record is an 11-year skid of red ink. While claiming his races are a hit, Sanchez remains mysteriously dependent on the dole: \x{fffd} 1985. Despite receiving more than \$1 million in public subsidies, Sanchez says his races lost more than \$2 million. Nonetheless, he manages to find the money to pay for a new Mercedes-Benz for his lobbyist, Book. \x{fffd} February 1986. Ralph Aid I: Miami paves Bicentennial Park into a grand prix track. The city also gives Sanchez \$250,000, plus an interest-free loan. That's added to the \$800,000 he's already gotten from the county and the state. \x{fffd} July 1986. Ralph Aid II: Sergio Pereira, then county manager, decides Sanchez needs more. He proposes a \$5 million bailout over 10 years. The Metro Commission pares the handout to \$200,000 a year, plus a \$368,000 payment for \"unexpected\" costs. \x{fffd} 1987-1988. Still itchy, Pereira and Sanchez hatch a scheme for Metro to buy out Sanchez's operations, and move the races to the Opa-locka airport. That nutty idea costs taxpayers \$300,000 in consultant fees. The plan is dropped when Pereira quits as county manager, after he's caught lying about his secret involvement in a land deal. \x{fffd} 1992. Miami gives Sanchez his customary \$200,000, plus \$300,000 in fire and police services. Not enough! He wants to move the Grand Prix to Munisport, a toxic dump in North Miami. Residents protest, saying they'd rather have a quiet dump than a noisy racetrack. Sanchez turns to Homestead ... And Homestead is ripe for the picking. Flattened by the storm, vacated by the Air Force, jilted by the Cleveland Indians, the city is frantic for a boost. Disguising Ralph Relief as hurricane relief worked brilliantly. Commissioner Larry Hawkins played everything but the violin, and Sanchez got his racetrack without putting up a penny. The public got a \$20 million lube job. Like the ballpark, a track will bring temporary construction jobs to South Dade. But after it's built, then what? For all but a few weeks each year, the place won't draw flies, much less tourists. (Muxo says Homestead police might use the new track for training, making it the world's most expensive driver-education course.) If the Grand Prix can't turn a healthy profit on prime downtown bayfront, Sanchez stands no chance in the distant fields of South Dade. The only winners in this deal are the taxpayers of Miami, who will be spared their annual \$500,000 bailout of Ralph's party. Now he is Homestead's charity case.",

So far, unsuspecting taxpayers have forked out \$8.9 million on the Golf Club of Miami. That's not a typo: \$8.9 million\x{2014}with about \$8 million more to come. Even using silk flags and the lushest Bermuda grass, it hardly seems possible to spend so much to spruce up a few fairways. Here's what happened. Five years ago, the county contracted with the PGA Tour to rejuvenate the Golf Club of Miami in North Dade. The courses had gotten ratty, and worried neighbors voted to tax themselves to purchase much of the property. The county had the rest. The PGA Tour eagerly offered to run the place and touted itself as capable and experienced. The prestige of attaching the Tour's name was supposed to attract a luxury hotel and hordes of golf-crazy tourists. As it turned out, a bunch of chimpanzees couldn't have negotiated a worse contract than the one approved by Metro commissioners. Ironically, the only one opposed to it was then-Mayor Steve Clark, the county's undisputed authority on all golfing matters. Clark said the Golf Club of Miami deal was no good, and he was right. Oh, the courses are in better shape today, and they're finally making a modest profit. Unfortunately, the county's seeing little of it; \$500,000 annually comes off the top, for the PGA. How bad was the contract? Item: new cart paths. The Tour's price tag: \$558,000, or about three times the going rate. The Caddyshack Commission said sure. Since 1989, the Golf Club of Miami has drained a small fortune from the county's general fund, including \$863,000 a year in bond payments. We're stuck with those until <<2004|9c:1>>. Of course, the big luxury hotel never materialized, costing Metro another \$4.2 million in bed taxes to repay investors. Incredibly, the Parks Department also \"loaned\" the golf club \$4. i million to construct a third course, an executive-style par 62. Not only was the price higher than many first-class par 725, but the short course lost a tidy \$460,000 in its first two years. The county claims all of that money eventually will be paid back out of future revenues from the golf club. Sure. When they raise the greens fees to \$2,000 a day. In addition to the \$8.9 million in general funds, the Golf Club of Miami has received much more from other public sources. Metro commissioners grabbed \$3.5 million from the sports-franchise bed tax and built a new clubhouse dedicated to one of their own, Sherman Winn. His name on the building is a fitting reminder of the suckers who paid for it. Defending the project, county officials say the funds spent on the Golf Club of Miami aren't a total waste. Said one: \"At least we've gotten into public ownership three pretty nice golf courses.\" And a dandy bargain it is. Let's see \x{2026} 54 holes at a minimum final cost of \$24.6 million. That comes to about \$455,555 per fairway. From now on, golfers will have an option of replacing their divots, or listing them with Century 21.",

            "Last week, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay uttered one of the most stunning comments ever to exit the lips of a Florida politician. \"In the past,\" he said, \"we've had a policy of trying to stimulate growth. We measured our success by the numbers of people who moved into the state. We can no longer continue to do that.\" What refreshing blasphemy! Finally, somebody in elected office has the guts to admit that Florida is drowning in its own humanity. Every crisis facing the state\x{2014}water, pollution, crime, health care, traffic, and budget\x{2014}is the result of too many people, too few resources and gutless leader ship. The quality of life is deteriorating in direct correlation with population growth, but until lately you could find only a handful of Florida politicians willing to come out and say so. More was always better. To challenge that philosophy was to jeopardize hefty campaign contributions from banks, builders and utilities. Unthinkable! That's why officeholders always talk about \"managing\" growth instead of stopping it. With the state government practically broke, the Chiles administration is promoting the theme of \"growing smarter.\" Translation: Help! What do we do now! The statistics are chilling. Each day, more than 900 people stampede to Florida, and that's not counting illegal aliens. Think of it as adding two entire cities the size of Hialeah every year. Every day, more than 300 acres of green space are paved for shopping malls and subdivisions. Planners say that keeping up with such expansion requires two new miles of road, two new classrooms, two new prison beds, two new cops and two new schoolteachers hired each day. In other words, there's no way to keep pace. Nine hundred newcomers a day is insane and ultimately suicidal. Stopping the flow will take imagination and a radical change in the way we promote the state. Pro-growthers say Florida's got plenty of space to grow\x{2014}just look out the window when you're on an airplane! And it's true, you can actually see some empty green patches in the center of the state. Unfortunately, that's not where most new residents want to go. Until now, people who've migrated here were foolishly allowed to settle any place they wanted. Not surprisingly, the coastal cities were overrun\x{2014}first Jacksonville, Miami and Fort Lauderdale, now Boca Raton, Tampa and Fort Myers. A big mess. Glorified human ant farms. One smart way for the Chiles administration to modify Florida's metastatic growth is to channel it\x{2014}by decree\x{2014}toward more thinly populated areas. Absolutely nobody else should be permitted to settle in Miami until North Florida fills up. It's only fair. Consider that the density of Pinellas County (anchored by St. Petersburg) is about 3,055 people per square mile, the worst in the state. Broward is second with about i ,026 people per square mile, and Dade is third at <<958|3:1>> per square mile. No wonder the homicide rate is so high. Now think of Liberty County. Tucked snugly in the Panhandle and bordered by the misty Apalachicola River, Liberty County has the lowest density in Florida\x{2014}about six people for every square mile. Paradise! Or Lafayette County, kissed by the quiet Suwannee\x{2014}and only 10 human beings per mile of riverside. Or spring-fed Gilchrist County, which grows some of the world's juiciest watermelons, and does it with only 22 people per square mile. Why do they deserve all the peace and quiet? It's time for rural Florida to carry an honest share of growth's burden. Think of it as a redistribution of wealth. Starting tomorrow, Liberty County should take at least 100 of Florida's 900 daily new arrivals. Sprinkle the remainder in Lafayette, Gilchrist, Wakulla, Calhoun, DeSoto and so on. Give those folks a taste of what we're experiencing down here, and you won't hear any fuzzy debates about \"growth management.\" They'll vote to close the borders.",

            "Now it will be a good Thanksgiving at <<1640|18:1>> S. Bayshore Drive. Now the kids who live there can stay as long as they need. The Miami City Commission said so Tuesday in an act of decency and wisdom. The house is owned by CHARLEE, Inc., a nonprofit group that places abused and neglected children in foster home settings. Opened in July 1985, the home on South Bayshore operated successfully and without controversy, until a few neighbors complained this year. They didn't complain so much about the kids; it was the idea of such a place in their neighborhood. They said it wasn't really a foster home, but a therapeutic facility. They said it was a zoning matter. Three years ago the city said that CHARLEE houses qualified as foster homes, and should be treated the same way. This year a different zoning official gave a less favorable opinion. The dispute could have shut down the Bayshore house and three others in the city. Doris Capri, CHARLEE's executive director, said: \"The majority of our children do not have healthy homes to return to.\" Curiously, the two most prominent opponents of the Bayshore home, lawyer A. J. Barranco and County Judge Murray Klein, did not appear at Tuesday's meeting. City Hall filled with other neighbors who felt strongly both ways. An attorney for CHARLEE got up to talk about definitions. The city zoning man got up to disagree. The commissioners wrangled about concepts like \"equitable estoppel.\" While all this was going on, the kids were home doing their school-work. The house parents, Mima and Fadi Aftimos, kept it a secret that Tuesday was the big day. They didn't want the children to worry. The children have been worried most of their lives. Some of them have been beaten and sexually molested by their real parents. The home on Bayshore is the safest they've ever known. Back at the commission chambers, everybody was agreeing that CHARLEE was a wonderful program, and that the children now living at the Bayshore home are model kids. Even Commissioner J. L. Plummer, who wanted the issue taken to a full-blown public hearing, felt obliged to say: \"I gotta tell you, I think the CHARLEE program is doing a terrific job. Let's put that in the record.\" And having put that in the record, Plummer then launched into a rather odd and irrelevant inquisition into the finances at <<1640|18:1>> S. Bayshore\x{2014}how much are the house parents paid (\$9,000 each), how much the state pays CHARLEE for each foster child (\$53 per day) and so on. This would have been understandable if the city of Miami were paying the bills, but it isn't. The house is owned outright by CHARLEE and every dime of expenses is paid by the state. The real issue was not zoning, finance, or improper definitions. It was the children\x{2014}whether or not they belonged. \"These are not juvenile delinquents,\" said attorney Gary Brooks. Said one neighbor, \"Give us some control, that's all we ask.\" Said another: \"Are we, the residents of this area, going to add to their neglect and abuse? \x{2026} Let's do what is right and just.\" Another man implied that he saw one of the youngsters jump from the roof into their swimming pool. \"My kids do the same thing,\" remarked Mayor Xavier Suarez, \"and I don't even have a pool.\" The house on Bayshore is only a few blocks down the road from City Hall. One of the commissioners, Rosario Kennedy, actually took the time to visit. She talked with the children and their foster parents, and even their teachers in school. On Tuesday, after listening to nearly two hours of debate over whether the place should be zoned as a foster home or something else, Kennedy finally just said: \"All I saw was a very neat house with two caring parents \x{2026} All I saw was a house full of caring and love.\" The vote to reverse the zoning administrator was 4-1, with Plummer dissenting. Afterward Fadi Aftimos couldn't wait to get home to tell the kids they can stay. No one needs to hear it more.",
