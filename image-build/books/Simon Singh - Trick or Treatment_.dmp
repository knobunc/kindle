            'The hallmark treatment of the chiropractor is a range of techniques known as spinal manipulation, which is intended to realign the spine in order to restore the mobility of joints. Chiropractors also call this an adjustment. It can be a fairly aggressive technique, which pushes the joint slightly beyond what it is ordinarily capable of achieving. One way to think about spinal manipulation is as the <<third of three|10>> levels of flexibility that can be achieved by a joint. The first level of flexibility is that which is possible with only voluntary movement. A second and higher level of flexibility can be achieved by exerting an external force, which pushes the joint until there is resistance. The third level of flexibility, which corresponds to spinal manipulation, involves a thrusting force that pushes the joint even further. The chiropractor will submit the vertebrae of the spine to this third level of motion by using a technique called high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust. This means that the chiropractor exerts a relatively strong force in order to move the joint at speed, but the extent of the motion needs to be limited, because otherwise there would be damage to the joint and its surrounding structures. Although spinal manipulation is often associated with a cracking sound, this is not a result of the bones crunching against each other or a sign that bones are being put back in their right place. Instead, the noise is caused by the release and popping of gas bubbles, which are generated when the fluid in the joint space is put under severe stress.',

Conducted in 1996, it estimated that the number of strokes, cord compressions, fractures and large blood clots was <<1.46|5a:0>> per million neck manipulations. This is a remarkably small risk, essentially one in a million, but it is misleadingly low for two reasons. First, experts suspect that the vast majority of incidents go unreported and unrecognized, so most incidents could not have been included in the study. Second, a patient may receive more than ten treatments for a particular condition, thus increasing the risk by a factor of more than ten.',

It was this powder that inspired Samuel Hahnemann to invent homeopathy, as discussed in Chapter 3.

Speculating that it was only one component of the bark that was medically active, they attempted to isolate that component and then deliver it in a more concentrated and potent manner. It took until <<1820|9c:0>> before two French chemists, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph-Bienaim\x{e9} Caventou, isolated a compound that they called quinine, based on the Inca word for the cinchona tree.

            "The dangers of aristolochia are discussed by the investigative journalist Dan Hurley in his book Natural Causes, which also reveals the dangers of many other herbal medicines. One of the most recent examples in his catalogue of horrors is ephedra, a remedy extracted from the Chinese plant ma huang (ephedra sinica). Scientists had long been concerned about the side-effects of ephedra, so they developed a safer version called pseudoephedrine, which acts as an effective decongestant and which can still be bought today as a component in many cold remedies. Nevertheless, the original herbal extract has continued to be used by millions of people, particularly athletes and slimmers, to improve physique and lose weight. However, by <<2005|9n:0>> there was strong evidence that 19,000 people had suffered severe reactions and at least 164 had died as a result of using ephedra. The most prominent case was Steve Bechler, a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, who died in 2003 during training as a result of heatstroke. Ephedra increases perspiration and dehydration, which is why the medical examiner concluded that ephedra had played a \x{2018}significant role\x{2019} in Bechler\x{2019}s sudden death.

 This is true, but irrelevant. Failing to understand how a therapy works has never been a barrier to accepting that it does work. Indeed, the history of medicine is littered with breakthrough treatments that were clearly effective and yet not initially understood.

Nevertheless, his treatment spread across the world. It was only in <<around 1930|18:0>> that scientists isolated vitamin C and understood why lemons safeguard against scurvy.
