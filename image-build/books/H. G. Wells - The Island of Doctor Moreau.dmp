            "The Island of Lost Souls (1933, Paramount Pictures) was the first of three authorized adaptations of H. G. Wells\x{2019}s novel. Directed by Erle Kenton from a screenplay by Waldemar Young and science fiction author Philip Wylie, the sixty-two-minute film was very literate and provided an excellent blend of science fiction and horror. Edward Parker (Richard Arlen) finds himself stranded on the tiny tropical island of Dr. Moreau (Charles Laughton) when an angry ship\x{2019}s captain leaves him behind. Moreau is very secretive about his work, but Parker eventually discovers the mad doctor is a whip-cracking taskmaster to a growing population of his own gruesome human-animal experiments. His one prize result, Lota (Kathleen Burke), is the beautiful and erotic Panther Woman, but because she has rejected Moreau and set her sights on Parker, the doctor seeks to destroy him. Unfortunately, Wells did not care very much for the adaptation, even though it was very close to his original novel. Part of his dislike for the film had to do with the casting of screen heavy Charles Laughton as Moreau. Wells intended his story to be a parable about man playing God and envisioned his mad scientist as a man with lofty goals and ideals who becomes corrupted by absolute power. But Laughton, in one of the best performances of his career, is far from the benevolent madman of the novel. He is sinister, perverse, and sadistic, and he\x{2014}literally\x{2014}throws his weight around like a schoolyard bully. When he cracks his whip, he conveys the perfect fiendish megalomaniac. Any of the redeeming qualities of the novel\x{2019}s characterization have been completely lost in Laughton\x{2019}s over-the-top performance. Wells was also upset by the barbarous portrayal of Moreau\x{2019}s surgical transformations, but he was not as upset as the antivivisectionist groups in his native country. In fact, their protests caused The Island of Lost Souls to be banned in England and most of the British commonwealth until <<1958|9c:0>>.",

            "I say, luckily for us he did not reach us, and I might almost add luckily for himself, for there were only a small beaker of water and some soddened ship\x{2019}s biscuits with us\x{2014}so sudden had been the alarm, so unprepared the ship for any disaster. We thought the people on the launch would be better provisioned (though it seems they were not), and we tried to hail them. They could not have heard us, and the next morning when the drizzle cleared\x{2014}which was not until <<past midday|13>>\x{2014}we could see nothing of them. We could not stand up to look about us because of the pitching of the boat. The sea ran in great rollers, and we had much ado to keep the boat\x{2019}s head to them. The two other men who had escaped so far with me were a man named Helmar, a passenger like myself, and a seaman whose name I don\x{2019}t know, a short sturdy man with a stammer.",

            '<<Towards midnight|13>> our talk of London died away, and we stood side by side leaning over the bulwarks, and staring dreamily over the silent starlit sea, each pursuing his own thoughts. It was the atmosphere for sentiment, and I began upon my gratitude.',

            'And at last the fury of the hunt slackened. We had pinned the wretched brute into a comer of the island. Moreau, whip in hand, marshaled us all into an irregular line, and we advanced, now slowly, shouting to one another as we advanced, and tightening the cordon about our victim. He lurked, noiseless and invisible, in the bushes through which I had run from him during that <<midnight|13>> pursuit.',

            "When this was accomplished, and we had washed and eaten, Montgomery and I went into my little room and seriously discussed our position for the first time. It was then <<near midnight|13>>. He was almost sober, but greatly disturbed in his mind. He had been strangely under the influence of Moreau\x{2019}s personality. I do not think it had ever occurred to him that Moreau could die. This disaster was the sudden collapse of the habits that had become part of his nature in the ten or more monotonous years he had spent on the island. He talked vaguely, answered my questions crookedly, wandered into general questions.",

I came out of the bushes, and, revolver in hand, walked down towards these seated figures. <<One|9k:0>>, a Wolf Woman, turned her head and stared at me, and then the others. None attempted to rise or salute me. I felt too faint and weary to insist against so many, and I let the moment pass.',

            'And then came a day, a wonderful day, that I spent in ecstasy. I saw a sail to the southwest, a small sail like that of a little schooner, and forthwith I lit a great pile of brushwood and stood by it in the heat of it and the heat of the <<midday|13>> sun, watching. All day I watched that sail, eating or drinking nothing,  so that my head reeled; and the Beasts came and glared at me, and seemed to wonder and went away. The boat was still distant when night came and swallowed it up, and all night I toiled to keep my blaze bright and high, and the eyes of the Beasts shone out of the darkness, marveling. In the dawn it was nearer, and I saw that it was the dirty lug-sail of a small boat. My eyes were weary with watching, and I peered and could not believe them. Two men were in the boat, sitting low down, one by the bows and the other at the rudder. But the boat sailed strangely. The head was not kept to the wind; it yawed and fell away.',
