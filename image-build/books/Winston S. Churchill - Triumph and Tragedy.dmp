LONG MONTHS of preparation and planning for the greatest amphibious operation in history ended on D-Day, June 6, 1944. During the preceding night the great armadas of convoys and their escorts sailed, unknown to the enemy, along the swept channels from the Isle of Wight to the Normandy coast. Heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force attacked enemy coast-defence guns in their concrete emplacements, dropping 5200 tons of bombs. When dawn broke, the United States Air Force came on the scene to deal with other shore defences, followed by medium and fighter bombers. In the twenty-four hours of June 6 the Allies flew over 14,600 sorties. So great was our superiority in the air that all the enemy could put up during daylight over the invasion beaches was a mere hundred sorties. From <<midnight|13>> three airborne divisions were alighting, the British 6th Airborne Division northeast of Caen to seize bridgeheads over the river between the town and the sea, and two American airborne divisions north of Carentan to assist the seaborne assault on the beaches, and to check the movement of enemy reserves into the Cotentin peninsula. Although in places the airborne divisions were more widely scattered than had been intended, the object was in every case achieved.',

            "Prime Minister to Marshal Stalin
7 June 44I am well satisfied with the situation up to <<noon|13>> today, 7th. Only at one American beach has there been serious difficulty, and that has now been cleared up. Twenty thousand airborne troops are safely landed behind the flanks of the enemy\x{2019}s lines, and have made contact in each case with the American and British seaborne forces. We got across with small losses. We had expected to lose about 10,000 men. By tonight we hope to have the best part of a quarter of a million men ashore, including a considerable quantity of armour (tanks), all landed from special ships or swimming ashore by themselves. In this latter class of tanks there have been a good many casualties, especially on the American front, owing to the waves overturning the swimming tanks. We must now expect heavy counter-attacks, but we expect to be stronger in armour, and of course overwhelming in the air whenever the clouds lift.2. There was a tank engagement of our newly landed armour with fifty enemy tanks of the 21st Panzer-Grenadier Division late last night towards Caen, as the result of which the enemy quitted the field. The British 7th Armoured Division is now going in, and should give us superiority for a few days. The question is, how many can they bring against us in the next week? The weather outlook in the Channel does not seem to impose any prohibition on our continued landings. Indeed, it seems more promising than before. All the commanders are satisfied that in the actual landing things have gone better than we expected.3. Most especially secret. We are planning to construct very quickly two large synthetic harbours on the beaches of this wide, sandy bay of the Seine estuary. Nothing like these has ever been seen before. Great ocean liners will be able to discharge and run by numerous piers supplies to the fighting troops. This must be quite unexpected by the enemy, and will enable the build-up to proceed with very great independence of weather conditions. We hope to get Cherbourg at an early point in the operations.4. On the other hand, the enemy will concentrate rapidly and heavily and the fighting will be continuous and increasing in scale. Still, we hope to have by D plus 30 about twenty-five divisions deployed, with all their corps troops, with both flanks of the second front resting on the sea and possessed of at least three good harbours \x{2014} Cherbourg and the two synthetic harbours. This front will be constantly nourished and expanded, and we hope to include later the Brest peninsula. But all this waits on the hazards of war, which, Marshal Stalin, you know so well.5. We hope that this successful landing and the victory of Rome, of which the fruits have still to be gathered from the cut-off Hun divisions, will cheer your valiant soldiers after all the weight they have had to bear, which no one outside your country has felt more definitely than I.6. Since dictating the above I have received your message about the successful beginning of \x{201c}Overlord,\x{201d} in which you speak of the summer offensive of the Soviet forces. I thank you cordially for this. I hope you will observe that we have never asked you a single question, because of our full confidence in you, your nation, and your armies.Stalin replied:",

17 July 44Thank you for your message. General conditions for big attack tomorrow now very favourable, as main enemy weight has moved to west of Orne, as was intended, to oppose my attacks in Evrecy area, and these attacks will be continued today and tonight.For complete success tomorrow good flying weather essential. Am determined to loose the armoured divisions tomorrow if in any way possible, and will delay zero hour up to <<3 P.M.|5>> if necessary.The British Army attacked with three corps, with the aim of enlarging their bridgeheads and carrying them well beyond the river Orne. The operation was preceded by an even greater bombardment by the Allied air. The German Air Force was totally prevented from interfering. Good progress was made to the east of Caen, until clouded skies began to hamper our planes and led to a week\x{2019}s delay in launching the break-out from the American sector. I thought this was an opportunity to visit Cherbourg and to spend a few days in the \x{201c}Mulberry\x{201d} harbour. On the 20th I flew direct in an American Army Dakota to their landing-ground on the Cherbourg peninsula, and was taken all around the harbour by the United States commander. Here I saw for the first time a flying bomb launching point. It was a very elaborate affair. I was shocked at the damage the Germans had done to the town, and shared the staff disappointment at the inevitable delay in getting the port to work. The basins of the harbour were thickly sown with contact mines. A handful of devoted British divers were at work day and night disconnecting these at their mortal peril. Warm tributes were paid to them by their American comrades. After a long and dangerous drive to the United States beach-head known as Utah Beach I went aboard a British motor torpedo-boat, and thence had a rough passage to Arromanches. As one gets older, seasickness retreats. I did not succumb, but slept soundly till we were in the calm waters of our synthetic lagoon. I went aboard the cruiser Enterprise, where I remained for three days, making myself thoroughly acquainted with the whole working of the harbour, on which all the armies now almost entirely depended, and at the same time transacting my London business.",

3 Aug. 44I am delighted that the unfolding of your plan, which you explained to me, has proceeded so well. It is clear that the enemy will hold on to his eastern flank and hinge with desperate vigour. I am inclined to feel that the Brest peninsula will mop up pretty cheaply. I rejoice that our armour and forward troops have taken Vire. It looks on the map as if you ought to have several quite substantial cops. Naturally I earnestly desire to see the Second Army armour, which cannot be far short of 2500, loose on the broad plains. In this war by-passing has become a brand-new thing on land as well as at sea. I may come to you for a day in the course of the next week, before I go to Italy. Every good wish.

4 Aug. 44Thank you for your message.2. I fancy we will now have some heavy fighting on eastern flank, and especially on that part from Villers-Bocage to Vire which faces due east. The enemy has moved considerable strength to that part from area south and southeast of Caen.3. I am therefore planning to launch a heavy attack with five divisions from Caen area directed towards Falaise. Am trying to get this attack launched on August 7.4. I have turned only one American corps westward into Brittany, as I feel that will be enough.The other corps of Third United States Army will be directed on Laval and Angers. The whole weight of First United States Army will be put into the swing around south flank of Second Army and directed against Domfront and Alen\x{e7}on.5. Delighted to welcome you here next week or at any time.



Prime Minister to General Montgomery
6 Aug. 44I was sorry I could not reach you yesterday. If possible I will come tomorrow, Monday. Please make no special arrangements on my account or inconvenience yourself in any way. Eisenhower, with whom I spent yesterday afternoon, suggested I should also visit Bradley at his headquarters, which I should like to do in the afternoon if you see no objection. The party would consist of self, General Hollis, and Tommy only.Accordingly, on the 7th I went again to Montgomery\x{2019}s headquarters by air, and after he had given me a vivid account with his maps an American colonel arrived to take me to General Bradley. The route had been carefully planned to show me the frightful devastation of the towns and villages through which the United States troops had fought their way. All the buildings were pulverised by air bombing. We reached Bradley\x{2019}s headquarters <<about four o\x{2019}clock|6>>. The General welcomed me cordially, but I could feel there was great tension, as the battle was at its height and every few minutes messages arrived. I therefore cut my visit short and motored back to my aeroplane, which awaited me. I was about to go on board when, to my surprise, Eisenhower arrived. He had flown from London to his advanced headquarters, and, hearing of my movements, intercepted me. He had not yet taken over the actual command of the army in the field from Montgomery; but he supervised everything with a vigilant eye, and no one knew better than he how to stand close to a tremendous event without impairing the authority he had delegated to others.",

On August 24 the first detachments moved on the city from Rambouillet, where they had arrived from Normandy the day before. The main thrust, led by Colonel Billotte, son of the commander of the First French Army Group, who was killed in May 1940, moved up from Orleans. That night a vanguard of tanks reached the Porte d\x{2019}Italie, and at <<9.22|9:1>> precisely entered the square in front of the H\x{f4}tel de Ville. The main body of the division got ready to enter the capital on the following day. Early next morning Billotte\x{2019}s armoured columns held both banks of the Seine opposite the Cite. By the afternoon the headquarters of the German commander, General von Choltitz, in the H\x{f4}tel Meurice, had been surrounded, and Choltitz surrendered to a French lieutenant, who brought him to Billotte. Leclerc had meanwhile arrived and established himself at the Gare Montparnasse, moving down in the afternoon to the Prefecture of Police. <<About four o\x{2019}clock|6>> von Choltitz was taken before him. This was the end of the road from Dunkirk to Lake Chad and home again. In a low voice Leclerc spoke his thoughts aloud: \x{201c}Maintenant, \x{e7}a y est,\x{201d} and then in German he introduced himself to the vanquished.

            "The total weight of bombs so far dropped by us on flying bomb and rocket targets in France and Germany, including Peenem\x{fc}nde, has now reached about fifty thousand tons, and the number of reconnaissance flights totals many thousands. The scrutiny and interpretation of the tens of thousands of air photographs obtained for this purpose has alone been a stupendous task, discharged by the Air Reconnaissance and Photographic Interpretation units of the Royal Air Force. These efforts have been exacting to both sides, friends and foes. Quite a considerable proportion of our flying power has been diverted for months past from other forms of offensive activity. The Germans for their part have sacrificed a great deal of manufacturing strength which would have increased their fighter and bomber forces working with their hard-pressed armies on every front. It has yet to be decided who has suffered and will suffer the most in the process. There has in fact been in progress for a year past an unseen battle into which great resources have been poured by both sides. This invisible battle has now flashed into the open, and we shall be able, and indeed obliged, to watch its progress at fairly close quarters\x{2026}.We must neither underrate nor exaggerate. In all, up to <<six o\x{2019}clock this morning|6>>, about two thousand seven hundred and fifty flying bombs have been discharged from the launching-stations along the French coast. A very large proportion of these either have failed to cross the Channel or have been shot down and destroyed by various methods\x{2026}. The weather however during June has been very unfavourable to us for every purpose. In Normandy it has robbed us in great part of the use of our immense superiority\x{2026}. In Britain it has made more difficult the work and combination of the batteries and aircraft. It has also reduced the blows we strike at every favourable opportunity at the launching-sites and suspected points on the other side of the Channel. Nevertheless the House will, I think, be favourably surprised to learn that the total number of flying bombs launched from the enemy\x{2019}s stations has killed exactly one person per bomb\x{2026}. Actually, the latest figures up to <<six o\x{2019}clock this morning|6>> are 2754 flying bombs launched and 2752 fatal casualties sustained\x{2026}. A very high proportion of the casualties, somewhere around 10,000, not always severe or mortal, has fallen upon London, which presents to the enemy a target eighteen miles wide by over twenty miles deep. It is therefore the unique target of the world for the use of a weapon of such proved inaccuracy. The flying bomb is a weapon literally and essentially indiscriminate in its nature, purpose, and effect. The introduction by the Germans of such a weapon obviously raises some grave questions, upon which I do not propose to trench today.* * * * *",

            "The lay-out of our defences against the flying bomb has been reviewed in the light of the results obtained during the past few weeks.Experience has shown that under the original plan fighters and guns frequently interfered with one another and that an unnecessarily large proportion of the flying bombs destroyed were brought down over land.It has accordingly been decided to re-deploy our defences in four distinct belts, as follows:(i) Fighter Belt at SeaFighter aircraft will operate under close radio control at a distance of not less than 10,000 yards from the shore.(ii) Coastal Gun BeltAll anti-aircraft guns allotted for defence against the flying bomb will be deployed in a narrow strip 5000 yards in width, extending along the coast from Beachy Head to St. Margaret\x{2019}s Bay. These guns will fire out to sea up to the 10,000-yard limit.(iii) Inland Fighter BeltInland, between the coastal gun zone and the balloon barrage, there will be a second fighter belt in which aircraft will operate under running commentary control. The bursts of anti-aircraft fire in the gun belt should be a great help to pilots in spotting the line of flight of approaching bombs. By night they will have the additional assistance of searchlights over the whole of the inland fighter zone.(iv) Balloon BeltThere will be no important changes in the boundaries of the balloon barrage.The re-deployment of the anti-aircraft guns on to their new sites along the coast was carried out over the week-end and the new defence plan came into operation at <<six o\x{2019}clock this morning|6>>.The new deployment was a vast undertaking, and it was executed with the most praiseworthy speed. Nearly four hundred heavy and six hundred Bofors guns had to be moved and re-sited. Three thousand miles of telephone cable were laid.

Secondly, a state of stagnation has been enforced here by the breaking in full career of these two great armies, the Fifth and the Eighth, and by the milking out of the key personnel in them. The consequence of this has been the withdrawal from the Italian front of three German divisions, including one very strong Panzer having an active strength of 12,500.

But apart from the smoke puffs of shells bursting seven or eight thousand yards away in a scattered fashion there was nothing to see. Presently Alexander said that we had better not stay any longer, as the enemy would naturally be firing at observation posts like this and might begin again. So we motored two or three miles to the westward, and had a picnic lunch on the broad slope of a hillside, which gave almost as good a view as the peak and was not likely to attract attention.",

            "News was now received that our troops had pushed on a mile or two beyond the river Metauro. Here Hasdrubal\x{2019}s defeat had sealed the fate of Carthage, so I suggested that we should go across too. We got into our cars accordingly, and in half an hour were across the river, where the road ran into undulating groves of olives, brightly patched with sunshine. Having got an officer guide from one of the battalions engaged, we pushed on through these glades till the sounds of rifle and machine-gun fire showed we were getting near to the front line. Presently warning hands brought us to a standstill. It appeared there was a minefield, and it was only safe to go where other vehicles had already gone without mishap. Alexander and his aide-de-camp now went off to reconnoitre towards a grey stone building which our troops were holding, which was said to give a good close-up view. It was evident to me that only very loose fighting was in progress. In a few minutes the aide-de-camp came back and brought me to his chief, who had found a very good place in the stone building, which was in fact an old ch\x{e2}teau overlooking a rather sharp declivity. Here one certainly could see all that was possible. The Germans were firing with rifles and machine-guns from thick scrub on the farther side of the valley, about five hundred yards away. Our front line was beneath us. The firing was desultory and intermittent. But this was the nearest I got to the enemy and the time I heard most bullets in the Second World War. After about half an hour we went back to our motor-cars and made our way to the river, keeping very carefully to our own wheel tracks or those of other vehicles. At the river we met the supporting columns of infantry, marching up to lend weight to our thin skirmish line, and by <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>> we were home again at General Leese\x{2019}s headquarters, where the news from the whole of the Army front was marked punctually on the maps. On the whole the Eighth Army had advanced since daybreak about seven thousand yards on a ten- or twelve-mile front, and the losses had not been at all heavy. This was an encouraging beginning.",

28 Aug. 44General Alexander received a telegram from S.H.A.E.F. asking for efforts to be made to prevent the withdrawal of more [German] divisions from the Italian front. This of course was the consequence of the great weakening of our armies in Italy, and has taken place entirely since the attack on the Riviera. In all, four divisions have left, including a very strong Panzer en route for Ch\x{e2}lons. However, in spite of the weakening process Alexander began about three weeks ago to plan with Clark to turn or pierce the Apennines. For this purpose the British XIIIth Corps of four divisions has been placed under General Clark\x{2019}s orders, and we have been able to supply him with the necessary artillery, of which his army had been deprived. This army of eight divisions \x{2014} four American and four British \x{2014} is now grouped around Florence on a northerly axis.2. By skinning the whole front and holding long stretches with nothing but anti-aircraft gunners converted to a kind of artillery-infantry and supported by a few armoured brigades, Alexander has also been able to concentrate ten British or British-controlled divisions representative of the whole British Empire on the Adriatic flank. The leading elements of these attacked <<before midnight|13>> on the 25th, and a general barrage opened and an advance began at dawn on the 26th. An advance of about nine miles was made over a large area, but the main position, the Gothic Line, has still to be encountered. I had the good fortune to go forward with this advance, and was consequently able to form a much clearer impression of the modern battlefield than is possible from the kinds of pinnacles and perches to which I have hitherto been confined.3. The plan is that the Eighth Army of ten divisions, very heavily weighted in depth, will endeavour to pierce the Gothic Line and turn the whole enemy\x{2019}s position, entering the Po valley on the level of Rimini; but at the right moment, depending on the reactions of the enemy, Mark Clark will strike with his eight divisions and elements of both armies should converge to Bologna. If all goes well I hope that the advance will be much more rapid after that and that the continued heavy fighting will prevent further harm being done to Eisenhower by the withdrawal of divisions from Italy.4. I have never forgotten your talks to me at Teheran about Istria, and I am sure that the arrival of a powerful army in Trieste and Istria in four or five weeks would have an effect far outside purely military values. Tito\x{2019}s people will be awaiting us in Istria. What the condition of Hungary will be then I cannot imagine, but we shall at any rate be in a position to take full advantage of any great new situation.I did not send this message off till I reached Naples, whither I flew on the 28th, nor did I receive the answer till three days after I got home.



President Roosevelt to Prime Minister
31 Aug. 44I was very glad to receive your account of the way in which General Wilson has concentrated his forces in Italy and has now renewed the offensive. My Chiefs of Staff feel that a vigorous attack, using all the forces available, should force the enemy into the Po valley. The enemy may then choose to withdraw entirely from Northern Italy. Since such action on his part might enable the enemy to release divisions for other fronts, we must do our best to destroy his forces while we have them in our grasp. I am confident that General Wilson has this as his objective. With an offensive under way and being pressed full strength in Italy, I am sure that General Eisenhower will be satisfied that everything possible is being done in the Mediterranean to assist him by mauling German divisions which might otherwise be moved against his forces in the near future. I understand all available British resources in the Mediterranean are being put into Italy. We are pressing into France all reinforcements and resources we can in order to guarantee that General Eisenhower will be able to maintain the impetus of the joint victories our forces have already won. With the smashing success of our invasion of Southern France and the Russians now crumbling the enemy flank in the Balkans, I have great hopes that complete and final victory will not be long delayed.It is my thought that we should press the German Army in Italy vigorously with every facility we have available, and suspend decision of the future use of General Wilson\x{2019}s armies until the results of his campaign are better known and we have better information as to what the Germans may do.We can renew our Teheran talk about Trieste and Istria at \x{201c}Octagon\x{201d} [Quebec].I was struck by the emphasis which this message laid upon General Wilson.",

24 Aug. 44The following is an eye-witness account of the Warsaw rising. A copy has already been given to the Soviet Ambassador in London.1. August 11The Germans are continuing, despite all efforts of A.K., their ruthless terror methods. In many cases they have burnt whole streets of houses and shot all the men belonging to them and turned the women and children out on the street, where battles are taking place, to find their way to safety. On Krolewska Street many private houses have been bombed out. One house was hit by four separate bombs. In one house, where lived old retired professors of Polish universities, the S.S. troops forced an entrance and killed many of them. Some succeeded in escaping through the cellars to the other houses. The morale of A.K. and the civilian population is of the highest standard. The watchword is \x{201c}Death to the Germans.\x{201d}2. August 11The German tank forces during last night made determined efforts to relieve some of their strong-points in the city. This is no light task however, as on the corner of every street are built huge barricades, mostly constructed of concrete pavement slabs torn up from the streets especially for this purpose. In most cases the attempts failed, so the tank crews vented their disappointment by setting fire to several houses and shelling others from a distance. In many cases they also set fire to the dead, which litter the streets in many places\x{2026}. The German Tank Corps have begun to have a great respect for the Polish barricade, for they know that behind each one wait determined troops of A.K. with petrol bottles. These petrol bottles have caused great destruction to many of their comrades.3. August 13The German forces have brutally murdered wounded and sick people, both men and women, who were lying in the SS. Lazarus and Karol and Marsa hospitals.When the Germans were bringing supplies by tank to one of their outposts they drove before them 500 women and children to prevent the troops of A.K. from taking action against them. Many of them were killed and wounded. The same kind of action has been reported from many other parts of the city.Despite lack of weapons, the Polish forces continue to hold the initiative in the battle for Warsaw. In some places they have broken into German strongholds and captured much-needed arms and ammunition. On August 12, 11,600 rounds of rifle ammunition, five machine-guns, 8500 [rounds of] small arms ammunition, twenty pistols, thirty anti-tank mines, and transports were captured. The German forces are fighting desperately. When A.K. set fire to a building which the Germans were holding as a fortress two German soldiers tried to escape to the Polish lines with a white flag, but an S.S. officer saw them and shot them dead. During the night of August 12/13 A.K. received some weapons from Allied aircraft.4. August 15The dead are buried in back yards and squares. The food situation is continually deteriorating, but as yet there is no starvation. Today there is no water at all in the pipes. It is being drawn from the infrequent wells and house supplies. All quarters of the town are under shell fire, and there are many fires. The dropping of supplies has intensified the morale. Everyone wants to fight and will fight, but the uncertainty of a speedy conclusion is depressing.5. August 16Fighting continues to be very bitter in Warsaw. The Germans fight for every inch of ground. It is reported that in some places whole districts have been burnt and the inhabitants either shot or taken to Germany. The inhabitants continue to repeat, \x{201c}When we get weapons we will pay them back.\x{201d}Fighting for the electric power station began on August 1 at <<5.10 P.M.|2a>> Twenty-three soldiers of the Polish Home Army were stationed in the works before that hour, because they were employed in the normal course of things, expecting the outbreak of the rising. The Germans had on the day before raised the strength of the garrison to 150 militarised police, stationed in concrete pill-boxes and blockhouses, also in all the works buildings. The signal for action was the explosion of a mine under one of the buildings. After nineteen hours of fighting the electric power station was fully in Polish hands. The Polish losses were seventeen killed and twenty-seven wounded. The German losses were twenty killed and twenty-two wounded, with fifty-six taken as prisoners of war. The detachment which captured the station consisted solely of manual and metal workers of the works. In spite of the fact that the buildings of the station are daily bombarded with 75-mm. shells by the Germans, the personnel has succeeded in maintaining the supply of current to the civil population without the slightest interruption.The battle also raged literally underground. The only means of communication between the different sectors held by the Poles lay through the sewers. The Germans threw hand grenades and gas bombs down the manholes. Battles developed in pitch-darkness between men waist-deep in excrement, fighting hand to hand at times with knives or drowning their opponents in the slime. Above ground German artillery and fighters set alight large areas of the city.",

            "Prime Minister to General Ismay, for C.O.S. Committee
12 Sept. 44The British share in this war may take the form either of direct participation in particular United States enterprises in the Far East or of British diversionary enterprises on a major scale calculated to wear down the enemy forces by land and air, and also to regain British possessions conquered by the Japanese. Of the two I favour the latter, because:(a) It is nearly always a sound policy to engage the largest number of the enemy as closely and continuously as possible, at the earliest moment and for the longest time.(b) This can best be achieved by a direct thrust across the short-haul of the Bay of Bengal, aimed at \x{201c}Dracula\x{201d} [Rangoon], \x{201c}Culverin\x{201d} [Sumatra], or other attainable preliminary objectives.(c) A great diminution of the forces engaged with the enemy results from lengthening the communications. A gush has to be poured into the pipe-line at one end to produce only a trickle at the other, so great is the leakage as the route lengthens.2. It follows, for the above reasons, that I am opposed to sending any British troops to join the Australians and New Zealanders under General MacArthur. The contribution would be both petty and tardy. On the other hand, I do not object to supporting General MacArthur with a British Naval Task Force, including carriers, or with R.A.F. squadrons, provided that the detachment of these does not weaken our major operations across the Bay of Bengal.3. Admiral Leahy informed me yesterday that it had been decided to accept the British offer to send our Fleet to participate in the main operations against Japan. It would not be inconsistent with this policy to make a detachment from it for the purpose of sustaining General MacArthur\x{2019}s operations.4. To sum up, our policy should be to give naval assistance on the largest scale to the main American operations, but to keep our own thrust for Rangoon as a preliminary operation, or one of the preliminary operations, to a major attack upon Singapore. Here is the supreme British objective in the whole of the Indian and Far Eastern theatres. It is the only prize that will restore British prestige in this region, and in pursuing it we render the maximum aid to the United States operations by engaging the largest numbers of the enemy in the most intense degree possible and at the earliest moment.In our discussions at Quebec we had carried the Americans with us on the Rangoon plan. This promised many advantages. Six months\x{2019} fighting in the hills and jungles of Burma and on the frontier of India was estimated to have cost the British and Imperial forces 288,000 losses from sickness alone, but a seaborne stroke against Rangoon and a northward advance would cut the enemy\x{2019}s communications and divide his forces. The destruction of the Japanese in Burma would liberate a considerable army, which could immediately attack such targets across the Bay of Bengal as might be considered to be most beneficial to the common cause, the wearing down of Japanese troops, and above all air forces. For this purpose we had resolved to strain every nerve to attack Rangoon by March 15, 1945. It was thought that five or six divisions would be needed for such an operation, but Mountbatten could only supply two or three and not more than one could be spared from the United Kingdom. Failure meant not only needless sacrifices through prolonging in Burma operations ravaged by disease but the setback of our whole further deployment against the Malay peninsula and beyond until <<1946|9c:0>>.",

            "Early in October the Royal Air Force struck the first blow. In a series of brilliant attacks they blew a great gap, nearly four hundred yards across, in the Westkapelle dyke. Through it poured the sea, flooding all the centre of the saucer and drowning such defences and batteries as lay within. But the most formidable emplacements and obstacles were on the saucer\x{2019}s rim, and their capture, already admirably described, can be told here only in outline. The attack was concentric. In the east the 2d Canadian Division tried to advance from South Beveland over the connecting causeway, and finally seized a bridgehead with the help of a brigade of the 52d Division. In the centre, on November 1, No. 4 Commando was ferried across from Breskens and boldly landed on the sea-front of Flushing. This first wave was followed rapidly by troops of the 52d Division, who battled their way into the town. The main attack was from the west, launched by three Marine Commandos under Brigadier Leicester. Embarking at Ostend, they sailed for Westkapelle, and at <<7 A.M.|5>> on November 1 they sighted the lighthouse tower. As they approached the naval bombarding squadron opened fire. Here were H.M.S. Warspite and the two 15-inch-gun monitors Erebus and Roberts, with a squadron of armed landing craft. These latter came close inshore, and, despite harsh casualties, kept up their fire until the two leading Commandos were safely ashore. No. 41, landing at the northern end of the gap in the sea-wall, captured the village of Westkapelle and drove on towards Domburg. No. 48, landing south of the gap, soon met fierce resistance. Invaluable though the naval covering fire had been, a principal adjunct was lacking. A heavy bombardment had been planned for the previous day, but mist prevented our aircraft from taking off. Very effective fighter-bomber attacks helped the landing at a critical moment, but the Marines met much stronger opposition, from much less damaged defences, than we had hoped.",

In the gathering darkness the Commando killed or captured the defenders. Next morning it pressed on and took Zouteland by <<midday|13>>. There No. 47 took up the attack, and, with a weakening defence, reached the outskirts of Flushing. On November 3 they joined hands with No. 4 Commando after its stiff house-to-house fighting in the town. In a few days the whole island was in our hands, with 8000 prisoners.',

Presently when Marshal Stalin came into the box for the first time in this war and stood beside him there was an almost passionate demonstration.

5 Dec. 44I have given instructions to General Wilson to make sure that all forces are left with you and all possible reinforcements are sent to you.2. You are responsible for maintaining order in Athens and for neutralising or destroying all E.A.M.-E.L.A.S. bands approaching the city. You may make any regulations you like for the strict control of the streets or for the rounding up of any number of truculent persons. Naturally E.L.A.S. will try to put women and children in the van where shooting may occur. You must be clever about this and avoid mistakes. But do not hesitate to fire at any armed male in Athens who assails the British authority or Greek authority with which we are working. It would be well of course if your commands were reinforced by the authority of some Greek Government, and Papandreou is being told by Leeper to stop and help. Do not however hesitate to act as if you were in a conquered city where a local rebellion is in progress.
3. With regard to E.L.A.S. bands approaching from the outside, you should surely be able with your armour to give some of these a lesson which will make others unlikely to try. You may count upon my support in all reasonable and sensible action taken on this basis. We have to hold and dominate Athens. It would be a great thing for you to succeed in this without bloodshed if possible, but also with bloodshed if necessary.This telegram was dispatched at <<4.50 A.M.|2a>> on the 5th. I must admit that it was somewhat strident in tone. I felt it so necessary to give a strong lead to the military commander that I intentionally worded it in the sharpest terms. The fact that he had such an order in his possession would not only encourage him to decisive action, but gave him the certain assurance that I should be with him in any well-conceived action he might take, whatever the consequences might be. I felt grave concern about the whole business, but I was sure that there should be no room for doubts or hedging. I had in my mind Arthur Balfour\x{2019}s celebrated telegram in the eighties to the British authorities in Ireland: \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t hesitate to shoot.\x{201d} This was sent through the open telegraph offices. There was a furious storm about it in the House of Commons of those days, but it certainly prevented any loss of life. It was one of the key stepping-stones by which Balfour advanced to power and control. The setting of the scene was now entirely different. Nevertheless \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t hesitate to shoot\x{201d} hung in my mind as a prompter from those far-off days.",

            "Prime Minister to President Roosevelt
17 Dec. 44About Greece. The present position is that our representatives on the spot, Macmillan and Leeper, have strongly recommended the appointment of the Archbishop as Regent. This is obnoxious to the Papandreou Government, though they might be persuaded to advocate a Regency of three, namely, the Archbishop, General Plastiras, and Dragoumis. There is suspicion that the Archbishop is ambitious of obtaining chief political power, and that, supported by E.A.M., he will use it ruthlessly against existing Ministers. Whether this be true or not I cannot say. The facts are changing from hour to hour. I do not feel at all sure that in setting up a one-man Regency we might not be imposing a dictatorship on Greece.2. There is also to be considered the fact that the King refuses, I think inflexibly, to appoint a Regency, certainly not a one-man Regency of the Archbishop, whom he distrusts and fears. According to the Greek constitution, the Crown Prince is Regent in the absence of the King. The King also states that all his Ministers under Papandreou advise him against such a step, and that, as a constitutional monarch, he cannot be responsible for it.3. The War Cabinet decided to await for three or four days the course of military operations. Our reinforcements are arriving rapidly, and the British General Staff Intelligence says that there are not more than twelve thousand E.L.A.S. in Athens and the Piraeus. The Greek King\x{2019}s estimate is fifteen to twenty-two thousand. Anyhow, we shall by the middle of next week be far superior in numbers. I am not prepared, as at present informed, to give way to unconstitutional violence in such circumstances.4. Our immediate task is to secure control of Athens and the Piraeus. According to the latest reports, E.L.A.S. may agree to depart. This will give us a firm basis from which to negotiate the best settlement possible between the warring Greek factions. It will certainly have to provide for the disarming of the guerrilla forces. The disarmament of the Greek Mountain Brigade, who took Rimini, and the Sacred Squadron, who have fought so well at the side of British and American troops, would seriously weaken our forces, and in any case we could not abandon them to massacre. They may however be removed elsewhere as part of a general settlement.5. I am sure you would not wish us to cast down our painful and thankless task at this time. We embarked upon it with your full consent. We desire nothing from Greece but to do our duty by the common cause. In the midst of our task of bringing food and relief and maintaining the rudiments of order for a Government which has no armed forces we have become involved in a furious, though not as yet very bloody, struggle. I have felt it much that you were unable to give a word of explanation for our action, but I understand your difficulties.6. Meanwhile the Cabinet is united and the Socialist Ministers approve Mr. Bevin\x{2019}s declarations at the Labour conference, which on this matter endorsed the official platform by a majority of 2,455,000 votes to 137,000. I could at any time obtain, I believe, a <<ten to one|10a:1>> majority in the House of Commons. I am sure you will do whatever you can. I will keep you constantly informed.* * * * *",

26 Dec. 44On our arrival at air-port at Athens Foreign Secretary and I held a conference with Field-Marshal Alexander, Mr. Macmillan, and Mr. Leeper.2. Field-Marshal Alexander gave an encouraging account of present military situation, which had been grave a fortnight ago but was now much better. The Field-Marshal however had formed the decided view that behind the E.L.A.S. units there was a stubborn core of resistance, Communist in character, which was stronger than we had thought and would be very difficult to eradicate. If we were successful in pushing the E.L.A.S. force outside the boundaries of Athens we should still be faced with a tremendous task if we tried to eliminate them altogether.3. Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Leeper informed us they had been considering the summoning of a conference of all the political leaders, which E.L.A.S. would be invited to attend. We felt that the convening of such a conference, with the declared object of putting an end to fratricidal strife in Greece, would, even if E.L.A.S. refused the invitation, ensure that our intentions would have been made clear to the world. We also agreed it would be a good move that the Archbishop should be chairman of the conference. At our meeting [in the airplane] we drew up the text of a public statement which Messrs. Macmillan and Leeper were to show to the Greek Prime Minister and the Archbishop, text of which has already been telegraphed to you.4. We expressed our wishes that the conference should rapidly become a conference among Greeks, though we would stay there as long as it was helpful. When the time came to put this to the Archbishop we had been informed beforehand that he would agree to play his part. When he came to see us [on board the Ajax] he spoke with great bitterness against the atrocities of E.L.A.S. and the dark, sinister hand behind E.A.M. Listening to him, it was impossible to doubt that he greatly feared the Communist, or Trot-skyite as he called it, combination in Greek affairs. He told us that he had issued an encyclical to-day condemning the E.L.A.S. crowd for taking eight thousand hostages, middle-class people, many of them Egyptians, and shooting a few every day, and that he had said that he would report these matters to the Press of the world if the women were not released. After some wrangling he understood that the women would be released. Generally he impressed me with a good deal of confidence. He is a magnificent figure, and he immediately accepted the proposal of being chairman of the conference. We are asking the U.S. and Soviet representatives in Athens to be present as observers. The conference is fixed for <<4 P.M.|5>> on December 26.5. The Archbishop, at my request, is sending me proposals for the agenda of the conference. I cannot foretell what may come out of it. It may be of course that E.L.A.S. will refuse the invitation. If they do so they will be shown before the world as making an unbridled bid for power. If they do accept I do not rate the chance of forming a united Government high. I was impressed, especially from what the Archbishop said, by the intensity of hatred for Communists in the country. We had no doubt of this before we came here. Present position is confirmed by all we have heard so far. There is no doubt how the people of Athens would vote if they had a chance, and we must keep the possibility of getting them that chance steadily in view. We will send you further reports after we have met E.L.A.S., if they come tomorrow.I had of course kept the President informed.',

Our Staffs had done a remarkable piece of work. Their discussions had centred principally round Eisenhower\x{2019}s plans for carrying his forces up to and across the Rhine. There were differences of opinion on the subject, which are related in another chapter. The opportunity was of course taken to review the whole span of the war, including the war against the U-boats, the future campaigns in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, and the Mediterranean situation. We reluctantly agreed to withdraw two divisions from Greece as soon as they could be spared, but I made it clear that we should not be obliged to do this until the Greek Government had built up its own military forces. Three divisions were also to be withdrawn from Italy to reinforce Northwest Europe, but I stressed that it would be unwise to make any significant withdrawal of amphibious forces. It was very important to follow up any German surrender in Italy, and I told the President that we ought to occupy as much of Austria as possible, as it was \x{201c}undesirable that more of Western Europe than necessary should be occupied by the Russians.\x{201d} In all these military matters a large measure of agreement was reached, and the discussions had the useful result that the Combined Chiefs of Staff were aware of their respective points of view before engaging in talks with their Russian counterparts.",

They had hoped to withdraw trained troops from the Vistula and use them to defend the river, but the Russian armour had by-passed them. Now they had only a mobile or strategic reserve of twenty or thirty badly trained divisions.

8 Feb. 45 (<<2.49 A.M.|2a>>)Today has been much better. All the American proposals for the Dumbarton Oaks constitution were accepted by the Russians, who stated that it was largely due to our explanation that they had found themselves in a position to embrace the scheme wholeheartedly. They also cut down their demand for sixteen membership votes of the Assembly to two, making the plea that White Russia and the Ukraine had suffered so much and fought so well that they should be considered for inclusion among the founder members of the new World Organisation. The President by no means rejected this idea, though obviously visualising difficulties from the American standpoint. He suggested that it should be submitted to a conference of the United Nations which he seeks to convene in America during March.Our position appears to me to be somewhat different. For us to have four or five members, six if India is included, when Russia has only one is asking a great deal of an Assembly of this kind. In view of other important concessions by them which are achieved or pending I should like to be able to make a friendly gesture to Russia in this matter. That they should have two besides their chief is not much to ask, and we will be in a strong position, in my judgment, because we shall not be the only multiple voter in the field.At the present moment all I ask is that we should be authorised by the Cabinet to give to the Russians the undertaking that when this matter comes up for decision, whether here or at the conference in America in March, we shall favour their view. I trust the Cabinet will grant us this authority to use or not to use as circumstances may dictate. The undertaking would be in the nature of a gentleman\x{2019}s agreement, and would be no different from that which we gave them long ago about supporting them on the Curzon Line.If this increased representation is conceded or virtually conceded to Russia the whole business relating to Dumbarton Oaks is settled by unanimous agreement, and anyhow I think it will go through. This must be regarded as a considerable advantage, and one to which the Americans will attach great value for the purposes of politics, predominance, and publicity. It also forms a part of our main scheme for the World Organisation\x{2026}.In spite of our gloomy warning and forebodings Yalta has turned out very well so far. It is a sheltered strip of austere Riviera, with winding Corniche roads. The villas and palaces, more or less undamaged, are of an extinct imperialism and nobility.

When however the Conference assembled in plenary session at <<four o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>> Molotov produced some fresh proposals which were much nearer to the American draft. The Lublin Government was to be \x{201c}reorganised on a wider democratic basis, with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland itself, and also from those living abroad.\x{201d} He and the British and American Ambassadors should consult together in Moscow about how this would be done. Once reorganised the Lublin Government would be pledged to hold free elections as soon as possible, and we should then recognise whatever Government emerged. Mr. Stettinius had desired a written pledge that the three Ambassadors in Warsaw should observe and report that the elections were really free and unfettered, but Molotov opposed this, because, he alleged, it would offend the Poles. Subject to this and to a few minor amendments, he accepted the United States plan.",

The Poles should have part of East Prussia and be free to go up to the line of the Oder if they wished, but we were very doubtful about going any farther or saying anything on the question at this stage, and I told the Conference that we had had a telegram from the War Cabinet which strongly deprecated any reference to a frontier as far west as the Western Neisse because the problem of moving the population was too big to manage.',

In Hamley\x{2019}s Operations of War, which I had pondered over ever since Sandhurst days, he argues the truth that a river running parallel to the line of advance is a much more dangerous feature than one which lies squarely athwart it; and he illustrates this theory by Napoleon\x{2019}s marvellous campaign of 1814. I was therefore in good hopes of the battle even before the Field-Marshal explained his plans to me. Moreover, we had now the measureless advantage of mastery in the air.

For nearly two hours a succession of young officers, of about the rank of major, presented themselves. Each had come back from a different sector of the front. They were the direct personal representatives of the Commander-in-Chief, and could go anywhere and see anything and ask any questions they liked of any commander, whether at the divisional headquarters or with the forward troops. As in turn they made their reports and were searchingly questioned by their chief the whole story of the day\x{2019}s battle was unfolded. This gave Monty a complete account of what had happened by highly competent men whom he knew well and whose eyes he trusted. It afforded an invaluable cross-check to the reports from all the various headquarters and from the commanders, all of which had already been sifted and weighed by General de Guingand, his Chief of Staff, and were known to Montgomery. By this process he was able to form a more vivid, direct, and sometimes more accurate picture. The officers ran great risks, and of the seven or eight to whom I listened on this and succeeding nights two were killed in the next few weeks. I thought the system admirable, and indeed the only way in which a modern Commander-in-Chief could see as well as read what was going on in every part of the front. This process having finished, Montgomery gave a series of directions to de Guingand, which were turned into immediate action by the Staff machine. And so to bed.",

Bernadotte suggested L\x{fc}beck, and they had met the previous evening. Himmler, though tired and admitting Germany was finished, was still calm and coherent. He said that Hitler was so desperately ill that he might be dead already, and in any case would be so within the next few days. Himmler stated that while the Fuehrer was still active he would not have been able to do what he now proposed, but as Hitler was finished he could act with full authority. He then asked if the Swedish Government would arrange for him to meet General Eisenhower and capitulate on the whole Western Front. Bernadotte said there was no need for this as he could simply order his troops to surrender, and in any case he would not forward the request unless Norway and Denmark were included in the capitulation. If this were done there might be some point in a meeting, because special arrangements might be necessary as to how and to whom the Germans there were to lay down their arms. Himmler thereupon said he was prepared to order the German forces in Denmark and Norway to surrender to either British, American, or Swedish troops. When asked what he proposed to do if the Western Allies refused his offer, Himmler replied that he would take command of the Eastern Front and die in battle. Himmler said he hoped that the Western Allies rather than the Russians would be the first to enter Mecklenburg, in order to save the civilian population.",

1 Jan. 45It is not possible for me, on the information available, to determine how far the high rates for sickness in the Burma campaign have been due to failure of unit discipline in enforcing antimalarial orders and how far to any inadequacy in our medical service; but certain questions present themselves, on which I should be glad to have your observations.1. To what extent have specialists on tropical hygiene been attached as consultants to the Army at home and overseas?2. Have the specialists been given independent civilian status, or are they posted in subordinate ranks in the Service hierarchy?3. What civilian professional advice is available to the Secretary of State and the Director-General in considering medical matters? I understand that there are two committees for this purpose. How often have these met in each of the last five years, and what sort of problems have been referred to them?These questions are not intended to imply any condemnation of the Royal Army Medical Corps. I have no reason to criticise their work. I am sure you will agree however that the drainage of man-power due to tropical diseases has been of such magnitude that every aspect of the matter requires most searching examination.




Prime Minister to Chief of Air Staff
2 Jan. 45German air attack on our airfields in Belgium, It is very easy to disperse aircraft, and especially to separate large ones by sandbags, etc. I doubt very much whether the question of dispersion was examined as such and rejected. It seems more probable that the aircraft congestion was allowed to grow and no preparations were made. After all, we have had many of these airfields in our possession for months. No doubt it was their crowded state that led the enemy to attack. What will be done now? Will the airfields be left in their congested state, or will they be properly dispersed? I should have thought dispersion would be part of the drill the moment there was time to spare. I cannot consider the incident satisfactory, and I should like to have a report upon the points I have mentioned.2. There is another incident which requires your attention, and that is the surrender at Kifissia of <<about 700|18:0>> R.A.F. ground forces. These men were mostly of the non-combatant variety, but, in spite of several warnings, were left out at this detached station seven miles away from Athens. They had, I believe, two platoons of infantry to defend them. There appears to be a bad arrangement between the military and the air. In a matter like this the military [command] should have recalled this party instead of letting them linger on, with the inhabitants, on a precarious footing. I fear the sufferings of the prisoners may have been very severe. Naturally I asked Field-Marshal Alexander to have a searching inquiry made. This is now taking place, but I wish particularly to know how many of these men had rifles and what training they had in rifle fire. One airman told the Field-Marshal, while we were together at one of the advanced posts, that they were only allowed five rounds for practice per annum. Everybody \x{2014} I repeat, everybody \x{2014} who wears the King\x{2019}s uniform should be capable of fighting, if it be only with a pistol or a tommy-gun.SUPPLIES AND RELIEF FOR EUROPE",

2 Mar. 45Now that the Yalta Conference is over we must decide at once how to meet the large British shipping deficit that emerged.The import programme must not be reduced. Various economies may be possible in other fields, but it seems that the main cut will have to fall on military shipments to the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. The Services have demanded 122 sailings a month to these theatres over the next four months. I am thinking in terms of a ceiling of eighty sailings a month.Pray let me know urgently what easement this would provide to our general shipping position, and what effect it would have on our military plans.




Prime Minister to Foreign Secretary
5 Mar. 45I have every intention of working to the utmost for a Poland free to manage its own affairs and to which Polish soldiers in our service will be glad to return. If this fails we must provide for the Poles in arms inside the British Empire, which can easily accommodate such brave and serviceable men. In the first instance no doubt they would be employed upon garrisoning Germany, with proportionate relief of our military burden.2. However, there may always be a certain number of individual Poles who will not wish to go back to Poland because of their inveterate hostility to Russia. For these, who will not be many if we are successful, the alternative of British citizenship must be open, even if they are unreasonable in their views about the kind of life open to them in Poland.




Prime Minister to Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sir Edward Bridges
5 Mar. 45I am notifying the three Service Ministers concerned that I wish the matter [of the British Bombing Research Mission] to be dealt with in the first instance between them and the Treasury, and that it is only after it has been thoroughly examined by the Treasury, as such a proposal would be in peace-time, and we have the Treasury safeguards against this expenditure fully operative, that it should be brought before the Cabinet. In particular, the exact cost of this grandiose proposal would be ascertained, as well as the injury to other aspects of our desired revival of civil life.




Prime Minister to Minister of Aircraft Production
6 Mar. 45At the beginning of the war the buildings of Malvern School were requisitioned by the Admiralty, and were, I understand, subsequently taken over by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for research purposes. The Malvern boys found refuge at Harrow, whose numbers had been depleted owing to the raids on London; but the prospective entrants to Harrow have now greatly increased, and while Malvern remains at Harrow it is impossible to find accommodation for them. The Governors of both schools are very anxious that the existing arrangements should be terminated, and I should be glad if you would let me know whether there is any possibility of your Ministry being able to dispense with the buildings at Malvern, in order that the school may now return there.




Prime Minister to General Ismay, for C.O.S. Committee
7 Mar. 45I thought the Polish divisions in Italy had been equipped with British equipment. Is there no more of this available? It would at any rate be desirable to begin the equipment of these two extra Polish units, and for this purpose we should not hesitate to draw upon reserves.2. In regard to the exact scale of equipment, a considerable tolerance should be allowed. No rigid rule should apply to formations which will be useful and necessary as the war draws to a close but which may not have to sustain its brunt. The use of these Polish units in occupying Germany will take the strain off our man-power, which will be of great importance to us in the period immediately following the collapse of Germany. For this purpose they would not require the equipment, transport, etc., which has been deemed necessary to full combat readiness.




Prime Minister to Minister of Food and Minister of War Transport
9 Mar. 45The attached proposals for increased production of pigs and eggs were made to me by the Minister of Agriculture. Certainly they seem to offer great advantages, and should not be impracticable in view of the fact that wheat is more plentiful than almost any other food commodity.Kindly let me have your joint views about this.




Prime Minister to Chancellor of the Exchequer
9 Mar. 45The following points have occurred to me, on which I should like to hear from you.The first is about children\x{2019}s allowances. Surely these sums should be free from income tax, and should be considered the property of the children? Would not this save a great many complications? How much would it cost?2. I see today in the Times that the Bill empowers the Ministers to reduce or withhold allowances payable to the families of Service men and women. Considering that the object in view is to encourage the birth and extra nourishment of children, I cannot see why this additional benefit should be denied to those classes; in fact, I should think that the prejudice which such a decision would cause would greatly detract from the popularity of the measure, for which, nevertheless, an immense annual sum is to be paid\x{2026}.




Prime Minister to Foreign Secretary
9 Mar. 45There is no question of the new Greek Army and Navy being paid on the British Middle East rates. Their remuneration must be proportionate to the conditions in the Greek State.2. I am anxious however lest the Navy, which has done so well, and the small military forces, who are to be the key men of the new Greek Army, should be suddenly confronted with such a violent pay cut. Would it not be possible to give them six months\x{2019} notice that they will revert to Greek rates? It would be a great pity to upset them at the moment, especially when we are so anxious to get our troops away. I do not suppose the amount at stake is very large. Could we not pay the difference between our rates and the Greek rates to these men for the next six months? How much would this cost?




Prime Minister to Minister of Labour
10 Mar. 45Thank you for your minute [about labour controls and persons released from the armed forces]. I confess I was not aware that the universal, overriding power of direction was to be applied after the defeat of Germany. Would you, for instance, in theory be entitled to take an author, a playwright, or an artist from his studies, although these yielded no immediate practical results, and direct him down a coal-pit, the said person having previously been released under Class A from the Army? Would you be entitled to take a man of the above class who is looking after his own farm, although not the actual farmer, and send him into a steel works? Are you entitled to take an officer or a soldier who has had four years\x{2019} fighting service overseas, and says he wants a year of rest and leisure and is making no claim upon the State for maintenance, and put him in a stone quarry?2. It seems to me that these dire and overwhelming powers can only be asserted by the State in times of mortal peril. I always understood from you in our very brief talks about these matters that the Class A men and those released in their proper turn from the Army would be free to seek what work they chose, but that those who were released as a privilege before their turn on account of being key men would of course be subject to direction into particular industries.3. You speak of \x{201c}an essential job of the highest urgency.\x{201d} What kind of job have you in mind? It is impossible to compel a person to discharge extremely high-grade functions. You cannot compel a man, for instance, to be a scientist. You can however compel him to sweep out the laboratory. But surely the latter is not \x{201c}an essential job of the highest urgency for which it is impossible to find a suitable candidate.\x{201d} Clearly you cannot compel a doctor to doctor if he does not wish to do so. Do you then claim the power to order him to grow mangelwurzels? Will you not allow a gipsy to go back to his caravan after serving his time? May not an ex-soldier with decorations for gallantry become a bookmaker if he chooses? Are you prepared to take a man who is fully employed at some special work of his own and transfer him to a basic industry against his will? If not, what classes of occupation do you regard as reserved for this purpose? What happens to the Bevin Boys after the German war is over? Are they to be compelled to go down the pits when some of them would like to go to the universities or go and fight against Japan?4. It would be easy to multiply the instances where the claim would be to direct persons who have paid their full debt to war-time compulsion against their will into high-class functions. To direct them into ordinary manual labour may only be to displace those who have need of the job. According to my principles, only mortal peril can justify these extreme invasions of individual liberty.5. I do not myself consider that the power of universal direction can be maintained over all the men and women in the country for very long after the German war is at an end. I was not aware that the Cabinet had lent itself to such far-reaching decisions of principle. So much is going on, and I have much to do, but I certainly claim to have the matter discussed or reviewed.6. I may say that the above is all based upon principle and theory. I am sure that in practice while Minister of Labour you would never allow any of these hard cases to arise. Nevertheless a Briton is supposed to be a free man except in times of national emergency.




Prime Minister to Minister of Production
10 Mar. 45Thank you for your minute of February 19 about penicillin. I am glad that we are at last producing really substantial quantities here. I am disturbed however to hear that the quality of penicillin produced in this country is said to be inferior to that from the United States. If so, I trust that this will soon be remedied. We must not sacrifice quality for quantity.No doubt you will let me have a further report when supplies become clearly surplus to Service needs, outlining proposals for increased distribution to the civilian population.




Prime Minister to Lord President of the Council
10 Mar. 45The expression \x{201c}mandate system\x{201d} was only used at Yalta to limit the territories which would conic within the scope of discussions affecting \x{201c}territorial trusteeship.\x{201d} This is necessary in view of the disappearance of the old League of Nations, on whose authority the mandates were held. It in no way governs any arrangement that may be made for the future. We are certainly not committed to the maintenance of the mandate system; but there is no question of subjecting any non-mandated British territories to any form of territorial trusteeship unless we choose to do so of our own accord. I should myself oppose such a departure, which might well be pressed upon nations like Britain, France, Holland, and Belgium, who have great colonial possessions, by the United States, Russia, and China, who have none.




Prime Minister to First Lord
10 Mar. 45I was shocked to hear your Civil Lord say in the debate [on the Navy Estimates] that now while the war was on was the best time to procure enlargement of the Royal dockyards, etc. You must realise that after the war the air will take a very large part of the duties hitherto discharged by the Royal Navy. In any case, decisions affecting post-war policy ought not to be taken, apart from the ordinary restrictions of peace-time Treasury examination (as long as that system prevails). Pray let me have a statement on your policy and plans for extending the Royal dockyards at the present time, together with estimates of the cost involved.

14 Mar. 45I learn that considerable dissatisfaction exists about the Government decision regarding war gratuities for the Women\x{2019}s Land Army. If a scheme could be devised which would not have wide and costly repercussions I think it would be wise and just to adopt it. I should be glad if you would examine the following scheme which has been put to me, and let me know whether it falls within the definition just mentioned.The proposal is that women on leaving the Land Army should receive a special allocation of coupons and a proportionate money grant designed to take account of the fact that they have surrendered coupons in excess of the special industrial allowance for their uniforms.Pray have this examined urgently. Meanwhile I am in no way committed.




Prime Minister to Secretary of State for War
18 Mar. 45I have been studying the latest figures of battle casualties in Europe as contained in the C.I.G.S.\x{2019}s summary for March 10.At the middle of February, I understand, the American Army was two and a half times as large as ours, while on D-Day the numbers were roughly equal. Taking the average bearing of the strength figures from June 6 to the middle of February, there were roughly twice as many Americans exposed to risk as British and Canadian troops. the same between the two Allies per man on the strength, with a slightly heavier loss to the Americans.For every American killed they report 4\x{bc} wounded; for every British and Canadian soldier killed we find 3\x{bc}wounded. In Italy also the American ratio of wounded to killed is higher than the British, though admittedly the variation is not so large as in Northern Europe \x{2014} 3.5 to 3.1. Unless we are to assume that the British soldier succumbs to wounds more easily than the American it seems very difficult to account for the discrepancy, save by the definition of \x{201c}Wounded,\x{201d} as both Armies are exposed to the same risks by the same weapons. I should be interested to know what is the War Office explanation of this point.




Prime Minister to General Ismay, for C.O.S. Committee, Secretary of State for Air, and C.A.S.
18 Mar. 45This complaint [from the Netherlands Foreign Minister] reflects upon the Air Ministry and Royal Air Force in two ways. First, it shows how feeble have been our efforts to interfere with the rockets, and, secondly, the extraordinarily bad aiming which has led to this slaughter of Dutchmen. The matter requires a thorough explanation. We have had numerous accounts of the pin-point bombing of suspected Gestapo houses in Holland and of other specialised points; but good indications are given in this account of the wood where the rockets are stored, and of the railway lilies which, if interrupted, would hamper the supply of rockets. All this ought to have been available from Air Intelligence. Instead of attacking these points with precision and regularity, all that has been done is to scatter bombs about this unfortunate city [The Hague], without the slightest effect on their rocket sites, but much on innocent human lives and the sentiments of a friendly people.




Prime Minister to Chancellor of the Exchequer
18 Mar. 45I see that the Foreign Office salaries are up by \x{a3}666,893. What are the principal causes of this very large increase? How was this settled with the Treasury? Did your officials go into it in detail, or is it simply done under war powers?Surely Treasury control should be resumed in an effective manner now that the peak of the war has been passed in Europe.

He hopes therefore that we shall be agreed in not standing on punctilio in this emergency. You should also express my good wishes and compliments.

25 Mar. 45It seems to me that a case has been made out (a) for the better and quicker outfitting of released trawlers; (b) for the release of more trawlers, especially the high-grade ones. Pray let me know what you will do. If you are unable to do anything we shall have to bring it before the Cabinet.




Prime Minister to Mr. Norman Brook
27 Mar. 45The Housing Squad meeting should be at <<10 P.M.|5>> on Wednesday.I wish to raise particularly the supply of labour in the first year after Germany is beaten, including of course releases from the Army, formation of special units for housing construction, releases from munitions works, etc. I cannot accept a ceiling of 800,000 or an average bearing of 500,000 for the first year after the German defeat. I am prepared to go into the whole question of releases from the Army from the moment that organised resistance in Germany has ceased. All men brought home out of turn from the Army will naturally be in the directed class. I am also considering the formation of special mobile units, on a two or three years\x{2019} contract, to prepare sites or erect bungalows. One would naturally draw in the main upon Army engineers for this purpose.We must clear up the position of the local authorities. The strength of the national hand must be more predominant while the emergency lasts.




Prime Minister to Secretary of Slate for Air
28 Mar. 45You have no grounds to claim that the Royal Air Force frustrated the attacks by the V weapons. The R.A.F. took their part, but in my opinion their effort ranks definitely below that of the anti-aircraft artillery, and still farther below the achievements of the Army in cleaning out all the establishments in the Pas de Calais, which so soon would have opened a new devastating attack upon us in spite of all the Air Force could do.As to V2, nothing has been done or can be done by the R.A.F.I thought it a pity to mar the glories of the Battle of Britain by trying to claim overweening credit in this business of the V weapons. It only leads to scoffing comments by very large bodies of people.




Prime Minister to Chancellor of the Exchequer
29 Mar. 45Our progress on the Continent seems to justify a revision of the Yalta dates for the end of the European war. I have referred this to the Chiefs of Staff, who have asked for time to consider the question. No doubt we shall know more in a fortnight; but we cannot delay the necessary studies for a single day. Your Manpower Committee should therefore plan now on the assumption that the European war will end not later than May 31, bearing in mind that if we should suffer an unexpected reverse in Germany we might be forced to revert to the Yalta dates, and conversely that an earlier collapse is also a possibility.




President Roosevelt to Marshal Stalin



29 Mar. 45I cannot conceal from you the concern with which I view the development of events of mutual interest since our fruitful meeting at Yalta. The decisions we reached there were good ones, and have for the most part been welcomed with enthusiasm by the peoples of the world, who saw in your ability to find a common basis of understanding the best pledge for a secure and peaceful world after this war. Precisely because of the hopes and expectations that these decisions raised, their fulfilment is being followed with the closest attention. We have no right to let them be disappointed. So far there has been a discouraging lack of progress made in the carrying out, which the world expects, of the political decisions which we reached at the Conference, particularly those relating to the Polish question. I am frankly puzzled as to why this should be, and must tell you that I do not fully understand in many respects the apparent indifferent attitude of your Government. Having understood each other so well at Yalta, I am convinced that the three of us can and will clear away any obstacles which have developed since then. I intend therefore in this message to lay before you with complete frankness the problem as I see it.Although I have in mind primarily the difficulties which the Polish negotiations have encountered, I must make a brief mention of our agreement embodied in the declaration on Liberated Europe. I frankly cannot understand why the recent developments in Rumania should be regarded as not falling within the terms of that agreement. I hope you will find time personally to examine the correspondence between our Governments on this subject.However, the part of our agreement at Yalta which has aroused the greatest popular interest and is the most urgent relates to the Polish question. You are aware of course that the Commission which we set up has made no progress. I feel this is due to the interpretation which your Government is placing upon the Crimean decisions. In order that there shall be no misunderstanding I set forth below my interpretation of the points of the agreement which are pertinent to the difficulties encountered by the Commission in Moscow.In the discussions that have taken place so far your Government appears to take the position that the new Polish Provisional Government of National Unity which we agreed should be formed should be little more than a continuation of the present Warsaw Government. I cannot reconcile this either with our agreement or our discussions. While it is true that the Lublin Government is to be reorganised and its members play a prominent r\x{f4}le, it is to be done in such a fashion as to bring into being a new Government. This point is clearly brought out in several places in the text of the agreement. I must make it quite plain to you that any such solution which would result in a thinly disguised continuance of the present Warsaw r\x{e9}gime would be unacceptable and would cause the people of the United States to regard the Yalta agreement as having failed. It is equally apparent that for the same reason the Warsaw Government cannot under the agreement claim the right to select or reject what Poles are to be brought to Moscow by the Commission for consultation. Can we not agree that it is up to the Commission to select the Polish leaders to come to Moscow to consult in the first instance and invitations be sent out accordingly? If this could be done I see no great objection to having the Lublin group come first in order that they may be fully acquainted with the agreed interpretation of the Yalta decisions on this point. In order to facilitate the agreement the Commission might first of all select a small but representative group of Polish leaders who could suggest other names for the consideration of the Commission. We have not and would not bar or veto any candidate for consultation whom Mr. Molotov might propose, being confident that he would not suggest any Poles who would be inimical to the intent of the Crimean decision. I feel that it is not too much to ask that my Ambassador be accorded the same confidence. It is obvious to me that if the right of the Commission to select these Poles is limited or shared with the Warsaw Government the very foundation on which our agreement rests would be destroyed.While the foregoing are the immediate obstacles which in my opinion have prevented the Commission from making any progress in this vital matter, there are two other suggestions which were not in the agreement but nevertheless have a very important bearing on the result we all seek. Neither of these suggestions has been as yet accepted by your Government. I refer to:(1) That there should be the maximum of political tranquillity in Poland and that dissident groups should cease any measures and counter-measures against each other. That we should respectively use our influence to that end seems to me so eminently reasonable.(2) It would also seem entirely natural, in view of the responsibilities placed upon them by the agreement, that representatives of the American and British members of the Commission should be permitted to visit Poland.I wish I could convey to you how important it is for the successful development of our programme of international collaboration that this Polish question be settled fairly and speedily. If this is not done all of the difficulties and dangers to Allied unity which we had so much in mind in reaching our decision at the Crimea will face us in an even more acute form. You are, I am sure, aware that genuine popular support in the United States is required to carry out any Government policy, foreign or domestic. The American people make up their own mind, and no Government action can change it. I mention this fact because the last sentence of your message about Mr. Molotov\x{2019}s attendance at San Francisco made me wonder whether you give full weight to this factor.




Prime Minister to Chancellor of the Exchequer
30 Mar. 45I am greatly disturbed by your minute [attaching the report of the Committee on Public Relations Branches of Government Departments], and most certainly, should the matter be brought to Cabinet, I shall urge that an arbitrary 25 per cent cut should be made throughout the Public Relations services, and that a Ministerial committee be set up to share it between the different departments. Perhaps in the meantime you will let me know what were the charges for Public Relations work the year before the war, and what are proposed for the present year, or what were actually charged in the last completed year.I always do my best to help in coping with expenditure, and you are right in thinking I am very disappointed.




Prime Minister to First Lord and First Sea Lord
30 Mar. 45In view of the progress on the Western Front and the fact that the Admiralty forecast of shipping losses by U-boats has been proved to be so far much beyond the actual results, I must ask that 10 per cent of the high-grade trawlers are released in April and 10 per cent in May. We can discuss the numbers of the June releases later on in the light of the war situation. I trust you will be able to conform to this direction with out my having to bring the matter before the War Cabinet as a matter of confidence. The food supply of Britain has a military as well as a national significance.2. Report also whether it is possible to send these ships to sea for fishing while they retain their guns, and what is the estimated time for conversion to shipping purposes in each case. When I asked for more speed in converting the older trawlers which had been released I noted that a large proportion of them were so worn out as to be unfit to move from port to port. This was therefore not a great sacrifice.APRIL",

3 Apr. 45(Copy to Foreign Secretary)You and I are both determined to make the strongest possible stand against Russia\x{2019}s behaviour since Yalta about Poland. The only question is how best to do it. Obviously we cannot change the course to which we and the United States are committed, namely, to urge Russia to send the strongest possible delegation to San Francisco. Anyhow, Russia\x{2019}s attitude must be judged in relation to the very serious telegrams dispatched by the President and by me in full and perfect accord. No one can form any opinion on this matter till we receive replies to these.2. If the replies are wholly hostile, I think it most unlikely that Russia will come to San Francisco. She will prefer to fight it out on the side of the Lublin Poles. The question will then arise whether the San Francisco Conference should be held or not. We have not yet reached this point. But looking ahead at it, Anthony and I both consider that it would be a great blow to our cause and prestige and also to the cause of a free Poland if the sulkiness of Russia prevented this World Conference from being held. The Russians would feel that their mere abstention paralysed world action. Although I have never been at all keen on this Conference, I should then in that event become very keen upon it. It would be an admission of weakness on the part of the whole of the rest of the friendly world which would far exceed any inconvenience of holding the Conference at the present time. I am quite sure that in the event of a Russian refusal we should confront her with the blunt fact that the civilised world is not afraid of her and is not dependent upon her, and that their Organisation would proceed with her outside unless she will come inside. No doubt we should make suitable modifications if she definitely remains aloof.3. The picture of all the United Nations, with Britain and the United States at their head, being put off their stroke by a mere gesture of insolence from Stalin and Molotov is a bad one. The picture of the United States and Britain holding a Conference without Russia which all the United Nations attend is an immense rebuke to Russia. Moreover, the military power of Britain and the United States is at this moment greater than that of Russia and comprises practically the whole world outside Russian territory and the conquered satellite Powers. There is no doubt on which side the hopes of humanity will rest.4. Therefore should events take the unhappy turn assumed in this note of mine, I should without the slightest hesitation proceed to carry forward the Conference. Les absents ont toujours tort. Nothing would show the Soviets where they get off more clearly. Thus I consider that this is the best tactical path to follow, and also the rightful moral path for the great mass of the world to follow, headed by the English-speaking Armies and forces of all kinds.5. I give you these reasons, which will determine my action irrespective of any other consequences which may arise. Pray give them careful thought and see whether they do not carry out your purposes in the most effectual manner. Also always remember, please, that there are various large matters in which we cannot go further than the United States are willing to go. Anyhow we have to wait (a) until the Russian response to the Notes we have sent Stalin is received; (b) till we know whether the Russians will reject their San Francisco observations; and (c) till we know whether in that event the Americans wish to persist or not. If they do I shall certainly urge that we back them up.6. You say you can \x{201c}only trust to your own instincts.\x{201d} I have offered you reasons at the end of a long day.




Prime Minister to Paymaster-General, General Jacob, and Private Office
3 Apr. 45I have not been able to read these papers [about the rocket sites in Northern France], but I am quite clear that the services rendered by the Army in sweeping up the coast were the prime cause of our deliverance. Next in order comes the anti-aircraft artillery, and the Air may divide the credit with them; but anything more foolish than to leave out the great services, alone decisive, of Field-Marshal Montgomery\x{2019}s army, including the Canadians, in sweeping the coast can scarcely be imagined.




Prime Minister to First Lord and First Sea Lord
3 Apr. 45Further to my minute about the release of trawlers, it may interest you to know that the figure to which my 10 per cent cut referred was <<about 425|18:1>> requisitioned British trawlers in home waters which are the cream of the fishing fleet. I will accept for April forty-two of these, but I shall require, unless there is a change in the war situation, 20 per cent for the month of May. We can consider June later. I am expecting the Admiralty to render this great service to the British nation by handing over these vessels with extreme promptitude and seeing that they are made good for fishing, so far as the Admiralty is concerned, in the full spirit of a naval evolution. Perhaps you do not realise that \x{201c}British-caught white fish\x{201d} in 1938 was 750,000 tons, but in 1944 only 240,000 tons.




Prime Minister to Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Food, and Minister of War Transport
3 Apr. 45Your minute about increasing our home production of pork and eggs.Everything depends upon the progress of the German war. I have given as a guesswork figure towards which we should now work the end of May 1945, but it may well be that the end will come before this. At any rate, before the end of April we should be in a position to take a much more sure and precise view. There is no reason why preparations should not be made and shipping assigned on the basis of the war ending on April 30, but let me see these in detail, so that the Chiefs of Staff can consider whether it is an undue risk to run. It is a good cause.2. Do not, I pray you, give up the egg scheme and the chicks necessary for full-scale production in the spring of 1946.3. On no account reduce the barley for whisky. This takes years to mature, and is an invaluable export and dollar producer. Having regard to all our other difficulties about exports, it would be most improvident not to preserve this characteristic British element of ascendancy.4. The Minister of War Transport must be bold and not let himself be overlaid by the sombre deadweight of military demands. The people of this country are entitled to have their minimum food supplies. He will run a terrible risk if a lot of shipping is thrown on his hands before the end of April as a result of the German submission.5. The Treasury should certainly be asked to sanction the purchase of 200,000 tons of cereals from the Plate on the assumptions mentioned. How much would it cost?6. I hope you will meet together and take an altogether bolder line on the very considerable lead I have given you, which I will do my best to support. The revised paper could be circulated to the Cabinet. Let me see it first.




Prime Minister to Sir Edward Bridges
4 Apr. 45Arrange with the Admiralty to bring up both cases of the transfer of warships to Canada and Australia at some Cabinet meeting to which the Dominion Ministers are summoned. Then make them a full and free presentation there and then across the table. The Admiralty should propose this. No financial considerations should be adduced. We owe too much to Canada in money alone, and the effect of gestures like this upon both Dominions concerned will be achieved far better than by arguments about trading off the value of the ships against certain financial considerations. This is not a moment for a \x{201c}penny-wise, pound-foolish\x{201d} policy. We must either keep the ships or give them. If the Admiralty think they can be given, now is the time to make the presentation in the most friendly form. Cast your bread upon the waters; it will return to you in not so many days.Bring this before the parties involved.




Prime Minister to Foreign Office
4 Apr. 45Attention should be drawn to the mis-spelling \x{201c}inadmissable.\x{201d} I have noticed this several times before in Foreign Office telegrams.




Prime Minister to General Ismay, for C.O.S. Committee
7 Apr. 45My view [about future operations in South-East Asia] is the following, and, if necessary, I will communicate with General Marshall through Field-Marshal Wilson on the subject on this sort of line:\x{201c}In the last war and this we have found it in all our affairs most detrimental to give absolute overriding priorities to any one set of operations-or supplies. Once this is agreed to, those who own the absolute priority take the last ounce of their requirements, of which they become the sole judges, irrespective of the ruin of the lesser priorities. For instance, a department that needs five tons of a commodity and has the absolute priority will not hesitate to take the five tons without consideration of other vital and important priorities which all together may need no more than a hundredweight of the said commodity. Widespread havoc is therefore wrought without a due sense of proportion.\x{201c}We have always in our dealings in this war and to a large extent on both sides of the Atlantic accompanied and modified first priorities by assignments. We could certainly not be bound to accept absolute priorities for the main effort without agreements being reached as to the very much smaller, but none the less essential, supplies required for other operations. We should resent and resist to the utmost of our capacity any proposal which proceeded without the slightest regard to operations to which we attach intrinsic importance, though undoubtedly on a much smaller scale than the main operation. We therefore hope that these matters may be settled by reasonable discussion.\x{201d}




Prime Minister to General Ismay, for C.O.S. Committee
8 Apr. 45Proposed British Bombing Research Mission. I much regret that I do not find myself in agreement with your proposal to spend such very large sums of money and use so much highly skilled personnel, required in e starting up again of our own country, upon what I judge to be a sterile task. You have asked for 1000 persons, of whom one-half are high-grade experts. I cannot conceive that any results can be yielded commensurate with such an expenditure of our remaining resources.I offer you thirty experts, who, with the large number of air groundsmen who will be scattered about Germany during the next few months, and who could be drawn upon temporarily in any locality, should be quite sufficient to find out the particular points about which you are interested.




Prime Minister to Foreign Office
8 Apr. 45This war would never have come unless, under American and modernising pressure, we had driven the Habsburgs out of Austria and Hungary and the Hohenzollerns out of Germany. By making these vacuums we gave the opening for the Hitlerite monster to crawl out of its sewer on to the vacant thrones. No doubt these views are very unfashionable\x{2026}.




Prime Minister to First Lord
8 Apr. 45I will certainly try to fit in an opportunity for seeing you and the First Sea Lord this week, but I cannot hold out any expectation that my most modest request [for the release of trawlers] should not be met now, so that our fishermen can get to work and relieve the great strain on British food. There should be no delay in taking action.




Prime Minister to President of the Board of Trade
14 Apr. 45It is absolutely essential to increase the supply of civilian clothes. The suggestions I have seen that there will be a critical shortage after VE-Day are intolerable, and it would be a grave reflection on the Board of Trade if such a thing occurred. You should be getting a considerable increase of labour as a result of my directive of February 26, and of this I trust that the clothing trades will receive an early and adequate quota.If this is not enough to ensure sufficient supplies of civilian clothing in the autumn I am quite willing to consider diverting from making military clothing up to 20 per cent of the man-power engaged, even if this entails delay in fulfilling Service demands.MAN-POWER IN 1945",
