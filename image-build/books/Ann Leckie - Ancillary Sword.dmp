The nearest edge was lined with the lilies we\x{2019}d glimpsed as we\x{2019}d come down the slope. Some meters to the left of that a slight, arched bridge led to a tiny island with a large stone in the middle, a one-and-a-half-meter cylinder with fluted sides, as high as it was wide. Elsewhere, here and there, rocks jutted out of the water. And away on the opposite side of the pond, up against the wall\x{2014}up, so far as I could see, against hard vacuum\x{2014}a waterfall. Not the trickles we\x{2019}d seen on the way in, but a rushing, noisy mass of it foaming and spilling down a rock wall, churning the bit of lake below it. That rock wall stretched across the far side of the lake, ledged and irregular. There was another entrance there, which gave onto the ledges, and a path that led from there around the water.",

I used a Liost term I\x{2019}d learned from Station last night. The Samirend that had been brought to Athoek had spoken Liost, sometimes still did. This person was Samirend, I\x{2019}d learned enough from Station to know that. And learned enough from Citizen Fosyf to know that Samirend overseers had been involved in those strikes. \x{201c}You\x{2019}d have been, maybe, sixteen? <<Seventeen|9k:0>>?
