            "We have achieved a temporal sentience that our ancestors lacked. It was long in coming. The year 1900 brought a blaze of self-consciousness about times and dates. The twentieth century was rising like a new sun. \x{201c}No century has ever issued from the womb of time whose advent has aroused the high expectation, the universal hope, as that which the <<midnight|13>> litanies and the secular festivals but eight days hence will usher in,\x{201d} wrote the editorialist of the Philadelphia Press. The Hearst-owned New York Morning Journal declared itself \x{201c}The Twentieth Century Newspaper\x{201d} and organized an electrical publicity stunt: \x{201c}The Journal Asks All Citizens of New York to Illuminate Their Homes Monday <<Midnight|13>> as a Welcome to the Twentieth Century.\x{201d} New York festooned City Hall with two thousand lightbulbs in red, white, and blue, and the president of the city council addressed a throng: \x{201c}Tonight when the clock strikes <<twelve|11>> the present century will have come to an end. We look back upon it as a cycle of time within which the achievements in science and in civilization are not less than marvelous.\x{201d} In London the Fortnightly Review invited its now famous futurist, the thirty-three-year-old H. G. Wells, to write a series of prophetic essays: \x{201c}Anticipations of the Reaction of Mechanical and Scientific Progress upon Human Life and Thought.\x{201d} In Paris they were already calling it fin de si\x{e8}cle, emphasis on fin: decadence and ennui were all the rage. But when the time came, the French, too, looked forward.",

Besides Madden with his Memoirs of the Twentieth Century and Mercier with his dream of the year 2440, others attempted imaginative fiction about societies to come, which can, in hindsight, be called \x{201c}futuristic,\x{201d} though that word did not register in English until <<1915|9c:0>>.

            "So the idea of science fiction as a genre, distinct from literary fiction and presumably inferior, was born here, in trashy magazines barely distinguishable from the funnies or pornography. Yet so was a cultural form, a way of thinking, that soon could not be dismissed as trash. \x{201c}I can just suggest,\x{201d} wrote Kingsley Amis when not much time had passed, \x{201c}that while in 1930 you were quite likely to be a crank or a hack if you wrote science fiction, by <<1940|9n:0>> you could be a normal young man with a career to start, you were a member of the first generation who had grown up with the medium already in existence.\x{201d} In the pages of the pulps, the theory and praxis of time travel began to take shape.

            "Along with quite a few of his contemporaries, Eliot was influenced by a slightly crackpot book, An Experiment with Time, written by an Irish aeronautical pioneer named John William Dunne. Dunne was an acquaintance of Wells who at the turn of the century began building aircraft models, then gliders, then powered biplanes, all tailless (a design with stability problems). In the twenties, having left aeronautics behind, he noticed that his dreams sometimes predicted future events. They were \x{201c}precognitive dreams,\x{201d} he decided. Reverse memory. He had dreamed of a volcano killing four thousand on a French island and then, later (or so he recalled), read in the newspaper of the Pel\x{e9}e eruption on Martinique, killing forty thousand. He began keeping a notebook and pencil under his pillow; he interviewed his friends about their dreams; and he put two and two together. By <<1927|9n:0>> he had a theory and a book.",
