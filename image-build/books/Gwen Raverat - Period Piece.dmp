We were seated in the cab [American for railway carriage] when suddenly I was aroused by Aunt C. saying in stentorian tones, \"I have forgotten the tickets for the Greek play\".' After some agitation they 'decided to run the risk of being turned away' and went off shopping to 'Picadolly [sic] and Regent Streets'. Here Aunt C. purchased for herself 'a little black and gold-braided bonnet, with four yellow roses and a little narrow black velvet ribbon,' for which she paid two pounds. There is something so succulent about this bonnet that I have not the heart to omit it, as I have all the numberless other things they bought. In the evening they 'had no difficulty in getting in. . . . Gladstone, Sir Isaac Newton [sic], Sir Frederic Leighton and some other great codger sat immediately in front of us.' [Query: Who can Sir Isaac Newton have been?] 'Gladstone looks exactly like the caricatures of him, only his collar is a little larger and his eyes are so keen and bright and twinkle so when he laughs. Sir F. Leighton had charge of the scenic effects and succeeded very well, only all the rouge and powder and Greek dresses could not make perfect beauties of the English girls. The play was called The Tale of Troy, and this night was spoken entirely in Greek.' [Of which, of course, she knew not a word.] 'Mr Stephen [J. K. Stephen] was Hector and acted remarkably well. Lionel Tennyson as Ulysses would have been better had he known his part. I enjoyed the play very much and equally so the people. Such dresses!!! Words fail me for description.'",

I still now feel that there is an unnatural gap in the landscape, where Foster\'s Mill used to stand before it was pulled down; and I find it hard to believe that the boys, who now sit fishing on the parapet, have no idea that there once was a great mill behind them. We used to spend many hours watching the fat corn-sacks being hauled up by a pulley into the overhanging gable, sometimes from a barge, but more often from the great yellow four-horse wagons, which stood beneath the trapdoor. The sacks butted the trapdoors open with their own noses, and the doors fell to, with a loud clap, behind them. At night there was a watchman in the mill who used to divert himself by trying to play the flute. It was a doleful sound to hear at <<three in the morning|5>>, especially as he had not advanced very far in his studies. My father, always a bad sleeper, was much worried by his aimless tootlings, but felt it would be cruel to protest; however, in the end, they came to an agreement which suited them both.',

And on Saturdays, market days, the farmers came trotting by in their traps; and the carriers' carts plodded in with their slow horses from villages as much as fifteen miles away. Sometimes they were hooded carts, sometimes they were just open carts, with planks for seats, on which sat twelve cloaked and bonneted women, six a side, squeezed together, for the interminable journey.

            "She had had a romantic history. She was born in 1840, Caroline Reynolds, the sister of my mother's mother. Her father was an English clergyman, who had emigrated to the States, round <<about 1825|18:0>>. At the age of sixteen she married Lieutenant Slemmer of the United States Army. Four years later, when in 1861 the Civil War seemed inevitable, he was sent to command the fortifications at Pensacola in Florida. One of the many legends about Aunt Cara concerns this time. She is said to have wept on President Lincoln's shoulder in order to obtain promotion for her husband, which she considered had been unjustly withheld. I began to try to draw this scene, and at once came to the conclusion that it was impossible to imagine Aunt Cara weeping on anyone's shoulder. I then learnt the true story. She went, with two brothers-in-law, to an arranged interview with the President; saying to herself, 'After all he's only a man like any other,' by which she meant that, of course, she could get him to do what she wanted. They found the President sitting at a writing table; at first the conversation was rather halting, but presently Aunt Cara, who was standing beside him, laid her hand lightly on his shoulder, as she put forward her plea. Mr. Lincoln smiled, and gently placed his hand on hers for a moment, and the ice was broken. She was successful, for among the Lincoln Papers is the following note in his own handwriting: 'List of Officers I wish to remember when I make appointments for Officers of the Regular Army, [several names, and last of all]\x{2014}Lieut. Slemmer\x{2014}his pretty wife says a Major or First Captain.' Aunt Cara always said that Lincoln was the greatest man she ever met, so perhaps she had not found him quite so easy to manage as she had expected.",

  One of the important duties which ladies had to perform was going to London for the day to shop. They had to catch the <<8.30|5a:1>> Great Northern train to King\'s Cross. In those days no one ever went to St. Pancras by the Great Eastern Railway if they could help it; and Liverpool Street was unknown to the genteel. The early start put a great strain on the whole household. Sometimes the Bull bus came to fetch my mother; it went round the town picking up such people as had bespoken its services. It cost sixpence, luggage and all. But sometimes the bus was booked up, and then a fly from the Bull yard was ordered to come at <<8 o\'clock|6>>. But when red-faced Ellis drove up to the door, my mother was nowhere near being ready. Once, when she was leaving to catch the boat-train for New York, she was still in her nightdress when Ellis came; and she caught the train, too. If not actually in her nightdress when he came, she was always still in her bedroom; perfectly calm, though all the three maids, and Nana, and I, were running about to fetch things and to help her to dress; while my father stood at the foot of the stairs, watch in hand, looking worried, and calling up in his patient voice: \'Maud, you\'ll miss the train.\' Of course she had not attempted breakfast, and I used to put slices of buttered toast on the seat of the cab for her. This was important, as her day\'s work was so absorbing, that she never had time for lunch, and used to come home in the evening quite famished and worn out. When she was in the fly I used to hand in through the window her boots and a button-hook, so that she could put them on as she went; while she gave me in exchange her slippers to take back.',

One has only to think of the omissions in all the mid- and late-Victorian novels, to perceive the fantastic unreality of the outlook of decent people, from <<about 1850|18:0>> to 1914. It is often hard to believe that these decent people were not being deliberately hypocritical, when they were so unwilling to face the facts; but very few of them were consciously shirking; they were merely taking on the views of the time, as it is natural enough for unthinking or inexperienced people to do. For nearly seventy years the English middle classes were locked up in a great fortress of unreality and pretence; and no one who has not been brought up inside the fortress can guess how thick the walls were, or how little of the sky outside could be seen through the loopholes.",

  She was always going away to rest, in case she might be tired later on in the day, or even next day. She would send down to the cook to ask her to count the prune-stones left on her plate, as it was very important to know whether she had eaten three or four prunes for luncheon. She would make Janet put a silk handkerchief over her left foot as she lay in bed, because it was that amount colder than her right foot. And when there were colds about she often wore a kind of gas-mask of her own invention. It was an ordinary wire kitchen-strainer, stuffed with antiseptic cotton-wool, and tied on like a snout, with elastic over her ears. In this she would receive her visitors and discuss politics in a hollow voice out of her eucalyptus-scented seclusion, oblivious of the fact that they might be struggling with fits of laughter. She characteristically wrote to a proposed visitor: 'Don't come by the <<ten o'clock|6>> train, but by the <<3.30|5a:1>>, so as to give me time to put you off, if I am not well.' In the year 1920, when she was seventy-seven, one of her little great-nieces happened to get chicken-pox in her house. Aunt Etty wrote to Charles at Cambridge, asking him to look in the Down family Bible to find out whether she had had the disease herself, as she did not want to catch it. He was not able to find the Bible at once\x{2014}it was in a box at the bank\x{2014}so she wrote again, very urgently. Upon which he had the satisfaction of replying by telegram: 'Yes, you had chicken-pox in August 1845.'

  Uncle Frank was always apt to suffer from fits of depression. This was his form of the family hypochondria; but it had no doubt been accentuated by the shock from which he never recovered: the death of his young wife, Amy Ruck, at the birth of her first child, Bernard (later to be the golfer and writer). Certainly, after this, he continually expected the worst about everything; though, from various stories of his childhood I have the impression that he had always been of a melancholy temperament. It was natural enough that he should have a horror of childbirth and illness, but his melancholy went deeper than that. He was difficult to cheer in his moods of heaviness; he seemed to have no spring of hope in him. Sometimes it even seemed doubtful whether it was good for him to play golf, it reduced him to such despondency; nearly every day he came home saying that nobody had ever played so badly before!\'',
