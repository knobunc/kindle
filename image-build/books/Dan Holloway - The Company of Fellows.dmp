As he reached the beginning of the 1990s, around the time the art and culture market was going stratospheric, there were several pages torn out of Christie\x{2019}s and Sotheby\x{2019}s auction catalogues, from London and New York. They were taken from specialist sales devoted to fine art, furniture, antiques, and wine. Shaw had attached notes to many of these detailing the prices the lots actually fetched. Uniformly the auction house figures were vast underestimates of the voracity of a market fuelled by stockbroker bonuses, coke-fuelled competitiveness, and a whole new generation of buyers looking for another bubble to pump for profit. In a few instances the sales exceeded by a factor of <<ten|3j>> the already-inflated estimates.",

It had, according to Charles\x{2019} immaculate script next to the estimate, fetched \$7000 at Sotheby\x{2019}s New York. A case of the other, Chateau Cheval Blanc from <<1947|9c:0>>, had sold for \x{a3}84,000 at Christie\x{2019}s in London to an advertising executive - \x{a3}7000 per bottle. Reaching further back in time, there was a case of Tokaji Eszencia from <<1811|9c:0>>, the most celebrated year in the wine-growing world and known, because of the appearance of Halley\x{2019}s Comet, as the year of the comet. The first time the case had been moved from the cellars of its Hungarian producer by the Nazis. The owner, Tommy noted, had recently died. He wondered if this was how an unsuspecting family had found out their father was a war criminal. Still, they hadn\x{2019}t been too repulsed to emphasise the perfect cellar conditions in which it had been stored. Nor had the Canadian investment banker who bought the case for \x{a3}98,000 had any qualms about provenance. What historians know about the Nazis would make those members of the general public who have only seen the published photographs of concentration camps recoil in shock. What cultural historians, on the other hand, know about the Nazis is how carefully they looked after their art.",

But Tommy was spent. He didn\x{2019}t want to see his thesis again before the viva, so he had left his third copy in Professor Shaw\x{2019}s college pigeon hole.
