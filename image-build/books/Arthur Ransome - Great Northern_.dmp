They were at sea and that was enough for them. If there was not enough wind, even Columbus suffered from calms. They might for a moment envy half-a-dozen fishing boats shooting northwards with the tide, but they were perfectly content to sit in the cockpit and on the foredeck, in bright sunshine on blue water. And as for being sorry they had spent those two nights in the wild anchorage of Scrubbers\x{2019} Bay, they were all agreed that yesterday had been the best day of the whole cruise. Even Roger thought that, though it was a pity that today of all days the tank should be running dry, just when the lack of wind would have given the engine and the engineer a noble chance of being useful.
The morning passed. Roger sounded eight bells for <<noon|13>>.

swung gently to her anchor with a glimmering light above her deserted deck. The two great birds slept on their island and had forgotten the noises that had worried them. Mr Jemmerling turned in his bunk aboard the Pterodactyl, thinking of a huge glass case with two stuffed birds in it and the eggs that would be the crowning glory of the Jemmerling Collection. In the grey house over the top of the ridge, Ian, the young Highlander, slept without a dream. Old Angus and he, climbing home again in the dusk, had, like the crew of the Sea Bear, made their own plans for the morrow.',
