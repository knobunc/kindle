Ever since this discovery scientists have searched for the mathematical rules which appear to govern every single physical process and have found that numbers crop up in all manner of natural phenomena. For example, one particular number appears to guide the lengths of meandering rivers. Professor Hans-Henrik St\x{f8}lum, an earth scientist at Cambridge University, has calculated the ratio between the actual length of rivers from source to mouth and their direct length as the crow flies. Although the ratio varies from river to river, the average value is slightly greater than 3, that is to say that the actual length is roughly three times greater than the direct distance. In fact the ratio is <<approximately 3.14|5a:0>>, which is close to the value of the number \x{3c0}, the ratio between the circumference of a circle and its diameter.",

            "By <<1937|9n:0>> it was established that, unlike their Japanese and Italian counterparts, the German army, the German navy and probably the air force, together with other state organisations like the railways and the SS used, for all except their tactical communications, different versions of the same cypher system \x{2013} the Enigma machine which had been put on the market in the 1920s but which the Germans had rendered more secure by progressive modifications. In 1937 the Government Code and Cypher School broke into the less modified and less secure model of this machine that was being used by the Germans, the Italians and the Spanish nationalist forces. But apart from this the Enigma still resisted attack, and it seemed likely that it would continue to do so.

The Enigma machine consisted of a keyboard connected to a scrambler unit. The scrambler unit contained three separate rotors and the positions of the rotors determined how each letter on the keyboard would be enciphered. What made the Enigma code so difficult to crack was the enormous number of ways in which the machine could be set up. First, the three rotors in the machine were chosen from a selection of five, and could be changed and swapped around to confuse the code-breakers. Second, each rotor could be positioned in one of twenty-six different ways. This means that the machine could be set up in over a million different ways. In addition to the permutations provided by the rotors, plugboard connections at the back of the machine could be changed by hand to provide a total of over 150 million million million possible setups. To increase security even further, the three rotors were continually changing their orientation, so that every time a letter was transmitted, the set-up for the machine, and therefore the encipherment, would change for the next letter.

Although this is one way of thinking about multiplication in clock arithmetic, there are short cuts which speed up calculations. For example, to calculate 5 \x{d7} 7 in 12-clock arithmetic, we can begin by just working out the normal result which is 35. We then divide 35 by 12 and work out the remainder, which is the answer to the original question.
