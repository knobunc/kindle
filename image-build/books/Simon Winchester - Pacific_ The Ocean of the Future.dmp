            'The Americans got going. The Pentagon had already named its planned rescue Operation Fiery Vigil, and that got fully under way. All the aircraft had flown safely away from the air base and the naval air station. Streams of military trucks and private cars were taking airmen and civilians down to Subic. Traffic jams extended for miles. Heavily armed U.S. Marines lined the choked highway, in case Marxist rebels operating in the region took the opportunity to stage ambushes. The <<noontime|13>> temperature was well over one hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and the combination of fear, urgency, and the ever-present sight of the erupting volcano nearby made for a volatile couple of days.',

Nine hundred feet had been erased from the mountaintop,3 hurled out and into the upper atmosphere and then back down to earth, which meant the two bases below had been wrecked, utterly. They were covered in a foot and more of heavy, gray, and greasy mud. It would take millions of dollars to clean up the bases, and they would be inoperable for years.',

Six hundred officials live there, with power, water, public telephones, and Internet service, and with a cell phone signal inadvertently supplied from a Beijing-occupied reef nearby. Despite its political opposition, Beijing has made no moves to acquire the island, assuming that, as with Taiwan, it will revert naturally in good time.

            "At the time this was done, the Pacific was a commercially comatose expanse of sea, with neither aircraft nor telephone cables in place, its international trade limited mainly to the peddling of copra, whale oil, and guano. The existence of an ephemeral line that magically decreed it to be <<noon|13>> on a nonworking Tokyo Saturday while it was still breakfast time on a potentially busy California Friday had scarcely any effect on such matters as the trade in guano futures. In the days long before arbitrage became all the rage, the date line was no more than an idle conceit, something for the stewards on long-haul ships to tell their passengers, who found \x{201c}gaining a day\x{201d} or \x{201c}losing a day\x{201d} to be greatly amusing.",

It turns out there was ample reason for concern. <<After 1941|9:0>> and the attacks on Pearl Harbor, on Malaysia, on Hong Kong, these now formidably well-equipped and well-defended islands (Pulau, Chuuk, Jaluit, and the two Marshall Island atolls to which United 154 was now heading, Majuro and Kwajalein) could be used as bases from which to attack Western forces. And it was clear the Japanese had been preparing them for such roles since back in the 1930s, confirming Western suspicions that Japan\x{2019}s intentions in taking the islands had been for military domination all along.",
