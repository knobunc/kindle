            "\x{201c}As a matter of fact I don\x{2019}t care two pins about accuracy. Who is accurate? Nobody nowadays. If a reporter writes that a beautiful girl of twenty-two dies by turning on the gas after looking out over the sea and kissing her favourite labrador, Bob, good-bye, does anybody make a fuss because the girl was twenty-six, the room faced inland, and the dog was a Sealyham terrier called Bonnie? If a journalist can do that sort of thing, I don\x{2019}t see that it matters if I mix up police ranks and say a revolver when I mean an automatic, and a dictograph when I mean a phonograph, and use a poison that just allows you to gasp one dying sentence and no more. What really matters is plenty of bodies! If the thing\x{2019}s getting a little dull, some more blood cheers it up. Somebody is going to tell something\x{2014}and then they\x{2019}re killed first. That always goes down well. It comes in all my books\x{2014}camouflaged different ways, of course. And people like untraceable poisons, and idiotic police inspectors and girls tied up in cellars with sewer gas or water pouring in (such a troublesome way of killing anyone really) and a hero who can dispose of anything from <<three to seven|10a:0>> villains single-handed. I\x{2019}ve written thirty-two books by now\x{2014}and of course they\x{2019}re all exactly the same really, as M.
