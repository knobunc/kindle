But something always caused him to halt, select <<one of the clocks|6>> and use his Pangolin privilege to open the alcove, remove the evil thing and hold it in his hands. This time he chose a clock he did not believe he had examined before, one that was dark and unornamented enough to have escaped his curiosity on previous occasions.",

Found: LCS, SIAM, <<13:54|2>>, <<17:03|2>>:15 YST.
Finder: Valery Chapelon.
Duration of construction: unknown.
Primary base materials: common ferrous alloys.
Origin of base materials: unknown.
Movement: double-roller anchor escapement.
Remarks: electron microscopy reveals atomic-scale fractal patterning in top-right
spandrel. Nature of fractal patterning obscure, but may echo visible detail on
pendulum hinge of clock #341.
Status: functional.
Known booby traps: none.
Associated fatalities: none.
Estimated hazard level: low.',

He did not so much see the ship as detect the subtle gradation in darkness between its hull and the background surface of the rock\x{2019}s hollowed-out heart.

            "The deep-system cruiser Universal Suffrage sat in its berthing cradle, ready to be pushed out of the hangar into space. Final preparations were under way, with just the latter phases of fuelling and armament still to be completed. The <<midnight|13>>-black wedge of the ninety-metre-long vehicle was offset by the luminous markings delineating general instructions and warnings, power and fuel umbilical sockets, sensor panels, airlocks and weapons and thruster vents. Only when the cruiser was under way would these lines and inscriptions fade back into the absolute blackness of the rest of the hull. Conferring with the pilot, Dreyfus had already worked out an approach strategy. They would come in fast, tail-first, and execute a last-minute high-burn deceleration. It would be bone-crushingly hard, but the cruiser was built to tolerate it and the prefects would be protected by quickmatter cocoons. A slower approach would give Aubusson\x{2019}s anti-collision weapons too great a chance of achieving a target lock.",
