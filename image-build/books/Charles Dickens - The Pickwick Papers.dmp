By and by, there comes a great bustle downstairs, and a lanky chap with a red nose and a white neckcloth rushes up, and sings out, \"Here's the shepherd a\x{2013}coming to wisit his faithful flock;\" and in comes a fat chap in black, vith a great white face, a\x{2013}smilin' avay like clockwork. Such goin's on, Sammy! \"The kiss of peace,\" says the shepherd; and then he kissed the women all round, and ven he'd done, the man vith the red nose began. I was just a\x{2013}thinkin' whether I hadn't better begin too\x{2014}'specially as there was a wery nice lady a\x{2013}sittin' next me\x{2014}ven in comes the tea, and your mother\x{2013}in\x{2013}law, as had been makin' the kettle bile downstairs.

I wish you could ha' seen the shepherd walkin' into the ham and muffins. I never see such a chap to eat and drink\x{2014}never. The red\x{2013}nosed man warn't by no means the sort of person you'd like to grub by contract, but he was nothin' to the shepherd. Well; arter the tea was over, they sang another hymn, and then the shepherd began to preach: and wery well he did it, considerin' how heavy them muffins must have lied on his chest. Presently he pulls up, all of a sudden, and hollers out, \"Where is the sinner; where is the mis'rable sinner?\" Upon which, all the women looked at me, and began to groan as if they was a\x{2013}dying. I thought it was rather sing'ler, but howsoever, I says nothing. Presently he pulls up again, and lookin' wery hard at me, says, \"Where is the sinner; where is the mis'rable sinner?\" and all the women groans again, ten times louder than afore. I got rather savage at this, so I takes a step or two for'ard and says, \"My friend,\" says I, \"did you apply that 'ere obserwation to me?\" 'Stead of beggin' my pardon as any gen'l'm'n would ha' done, he got more abusive than ever:\x{2014}called me a wessel, Sammy\x{2014}a wessel of wrath\x{2014}and all sorts o' names.

And what does this allusion to the slow coach mean?

Gentlemen, my uncle opened his eyes so wide at all this, that, to the very last moment of his life, he used to wonder how it fell out that he had ever been able to shut 'em again.",
