I pulled my old typewriter from the closet and set her up in the guest room with everything she\'d need, a card table for a desk, a chair, paper, some glasses, a pitcher of water, a hotplate, some flowers, crackers, it wasn\'t a proper office but it would do, she said, "But it\'s a Nothing Place," I wrote, "What better place to write your life story?" She said, "My eyes are crummy," I told her they were good enough, she said, "They barely work," putting her fingers over them, but I knew she was just embarrassed by the attention, she said, "I don\'t know how to write," I told her there\'s nothing to know, just let it come out, she put her hands on the typewriter, like a blind person feeling someone\'s face for the first time, and said, "I\'ve never used one of these before," I told her, "Just press the keys," she said she would try, and though I\'d known how to use a typewriter since I was a boy, trying was more than I ever could do.

She said, "I\'d like to show you something." I followed her to the guest room, she pointed in the direction of the card table in the corner, on which the typewriter was wedged between two stacks of paper of about the same height, we walked over together, she touched everything on the table and then handed me the stack on the left, she said, "My Life." "Excuse me?" I asked by shrugging my shoulders, she tapped the page, "My Life," she said again, I riffled the pages, there must have been a thousand of them, I put the stack down, "What is this?" I asked by putting her palms on the tops of my hands and then turning my palms upward, flipping her hands off mine, "My Life," she said, so proudly, "I just made it up to the present moment. Just now. I\'m all caught up with myself. The last thing I wrote was \'I\'m going to show him what I\'ve written. I hope he loves it.\'" I picked up the pages and wandered through them, trying to find the one on which she was born, her first love, when she last saw her parents, and I was looking for Anna, too, I searched and searched, I got a paper cut on my forefinger and bled a little flower onto the page on which I should have seen her kissing somebody, but this was all I saw:',
