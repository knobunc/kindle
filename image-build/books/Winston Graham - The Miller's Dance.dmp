It was a light frost, disappearing each <<midday|13>> and coming down again at night \x{2013} which was the norm for this area \x{2013} but it meant that the wind had at last dropped and the sea was quiet. For a time it had even been feared they were to be frustrated by the sudden lack of that element of which they had for so long had too much; but after a couple of days the lightest of breezes had sprung up from the north-east and before dawn this Monday morning the convoy had set out from Hayle. It had taken them until <<noon|13>> to get here, which was full tide \x{2013} though a neap tide, leaving a wide expanse of beach uncovered and much of the sand soft and yielding. The sea was very slight, its hair at the edge in little rolls of curlers hardly big enough to disturb a child.",

This was the really difficult job. The giant cast-iron beam weighed eighteen tons \x{2013} two and a half times as much as the boiler. A larger timber frame was now being brought along this second pathway of sleepers, with rollers to lay over the sleepers as before. This was altogether too heavy a job for men, and a double team of twelve horses \x{2013} six a side \x{2013} waited in harness to pull the makeshift trolley back along the track.
