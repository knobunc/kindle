            "It was <<almost midnight|13>>, but the Great Room was still buzzing with activity. Julian, Paul, and a few of the other guys were crashed on the couches, watching the sports channel. The ankle-biters (our three youngest trainees) were coloring pictures on the floor. Chip bags and soda cans littered the coffee table. Shoes were tossed randomly across the snakeskin rug. In the middle of the room, the two-story-tall statue of Thoth, the ibis-headed god of knowledge, loomed over our initiates with his scroll and quill. Somebody had put one of Amos\x{2019}s old porkpie hats on the statue\x{2019}s head, so he looked like a bookie taking bets on the football game. One of the ankle-biters had colored the god\x{2019}s obsidian toes pink and purple with crayons. We\x{2019}re big on respect here at Brooklyn House.",
