She had never lived alone before, and at first had found it strange, but gradually had learned to accept it as a blessing and to indulge herself in all sorts of reprehensible ways, like getting up when she felt like it, scratching herself if she itched, sitting up until <<two in the morning|5>> to listen to a concert. And food was another thing. All her life she had cooked for her family and friends and she was an excellent cook, but she discovered, as time went by, an underlying penchant for the most disgusting snacks. Baked beans eaten cold, with a teaspoon, out of the tin. Bottled salad cream spread over her lettuce, and a certain sort of pickle which she would have been ashamed to set on her table in the old days of Oakley Street.',

She believed, of course, and went to church at Christmas and Easter, because without something to believe in, life would be intolerable.

Every other person, it seemed, wore the black of mourning, and the streets of the city, which had never failed to fill him with delight, seemed to have lost their spell. He returned to London, to the old family house in Oakley Street. By now his parents were dead and the house was his, but far too large and rambling for a single man. He solved this by occupying only the basement and the ground floor, and letting the upper rooms to any soul who needed a home and was able to pay him some rent. In the big garden at the back of his house was his studio. He opened it up, cleared out some of the accumulated rubbish, and, putting memories of war resolutely behind him, he picked up his brushes, and with them, the threads of his life.',

Tired and dirty, with, hopes dashed, his gloom burnt to resentment. This was mostly directed against his mother, whose fault everything was.

Olivia, seeing them off, watched the last car turn the corner by the gate and then, in some relief, turned and went back into the house. The kitchen hummed with activity. Mr. Plackett and Danus, who had spent the last half-hour directing traffic and endeavouring to untangle a number of ineptly parked cars, had now moved indoors and were helping Mrs. Plackett and Antonia collect and wash up all the tea-things. Mrs. Plackett was at the sink, elbow-deep in suds. Mr. Plackett, obliging as ever, stood at her side and dried the silver teapot. The dishwasher whirred, Danus came through the door with another trayful of cups and saucers, and Antonia was getting the vacuum cleaner out of its cupboard.',

She got off the bed and went to close and latch the window for the last time. At the mirror she paused to check on her reflection and make certain that her face betrayed no trace of tears. Then she picked up the book, the letter and the photograph safe within its pages, and went out of the room, closing the door behind her. Downstairs in the deserted kitchen, she took up the heavy iron poker and used it to lift the lid from the boiler. A furnace heat flowed up, scorching her cheeks, and she dropped Mumma\'s secret into the heart of the glowing red coals and watched it burn.',

Antonia\'s voice over the telephone had betrayed a state of some agitation, and Olivia was not perfectly certain of what sort of reception she was about to receive. She imagined their reunion. Saw herself walking into L\'Escargot and finding Antonia waiting for her. Antonia would be wearing her usual worn jeans and cotton shirt, and would look, in that costly venue of expense-account business men, totally out of place. It\'s really important. What could be so important that she had claimed an hour of Olivia\'s precious day, and would not take No for an answer? It was hard to believe that anything could possibly have gone wrong for Danus and Antonia, but it was always better to prepare oneself for the worst. Various eventualities presented themselves. They had been unable to find any suitable plot in which to raise their cabbages, and Antonia now wanted to discuss some alternative plan. They had found a plot but felt unenthusiastic about the house that went with it, and wished Olivia to travel to Devon, view it, and give her opinion. Antonia had started a baby. Or perhaps they had discovered that after all they had little in common, and so no future to share, and had decided to part.',
