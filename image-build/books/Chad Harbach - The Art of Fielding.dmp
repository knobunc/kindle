He, not Schwartz, had messed everything up. He, not Schwartz, was to blame. And yet every memory that popped into his head as he sat there in that underground room thick with memories was a memory of Schwartz causing him pain. He was angry at Schwartz. He kind of hated Schwartz. Remember when he arrived at Westish, friendless and adrift, and Schwartz, who\x{2019}d brought him here, who\x{2019}d led Henry to expect he would guide him, had left him hanging for twelve long lonely weeks before he\x{2019}d finally called, and said by way of excuse that he\x{2019}d been busy with football?

Hated him too for every weighted stadium he\x{2019}d made him run, every <<five a.m.|5>> workout, every thousand-pull-up workout, every torturous toss of a medicine ball\x{2026} it was pain that Henry had craved and demanded, purposeful pain, or so it had seemed, but what broke over him now was all that pain in its purest state, pain that meant nothing, could not be redeemed, because it all led only here, and here was nowhere. God, how he hated Schwartz. Hated him for his attention and hated him for his neglect. Lately, since Pella, it had been neglect again. Without Schwartz pushing him, torturing him, he wouldn\x{2019}t be here. Schwartz had brought him here and now he was fucked. Before he met Schwartz his dreams were just dreams.
