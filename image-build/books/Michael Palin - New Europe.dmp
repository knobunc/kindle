The architecture is as striking as I remember it, the city as beautiful, but now it is open, welcoming and anxious to please, and you can talk about anything, anywhere. The \x{2018}Golden Mile\x{2019}, running from St Vitus\x{2019} Cathedral and the castle through Mala Strana (the Little Quarter), across Charles Bridge to the Old Town Square, must be one of the most over-appreciated stretches of any capital in Europe. In the high tourist time of day - from <<nine till five|10>> - a thick, slow-moving crowd clogs this lucrative artery, making it impossible to get a sense of anything except other people. Prague is endlessly hospitable and seems as much at ease with the night-time adventurer as the daytime masses. Quite late at night I saw vehicles, looking like converted jeeps, offering rides to the nearest brothel. I also saw a group of medics from Portsmouth, bowling down through Wenceslas Square, all dressed identically in green surgical overalls. They were pissed as newts and yet the Czech people I was with seemed to take it quite philosophically. And they were policemen.",
