Seven years younger than I, he could still go out drinking all night, get completely smashed, and jump out of bed the next morning and go to work. I could drink only when I had nothing to do the next day. I\'m three-quarters Irish, which should have blessed me with a high tolerance, but the infrequency of my drinking has lowered my defenses. As my eldest brother remarks whenever we go out for a drink, I am a lightweight. The word sits in his mouth like a spoonful of spoiled mayonnaise. The fact that I can drink only one beer to his three is pitiable. How I struggle through life with this infirmity, he can\'t fathom.',
