            "My brother and I, as I have said, were forbidden this room; but when we were a little older Mr Million used to take us, about twice a week, on expeditions to the city library. These were very nearly the only times we were allowed to leave the house, and since our tutor disliked curling the jointed length of his metal modules into a hire cart, and no sedan chair would have withstood his weight or contained his bulk, these forays were made on foot.
For a long time this route to the library was the only part of the city I knew. Three blocks down Saltimbanque Street where our house stood, right at the Rue d\x{201c}Asticot to the slave market and a block beyond that to the library. A child, not knowing what is extraordinary and what commonplace, usually lights midway between the two, finds interest in incidents adults consider beneath notice and calmly accepts the most improbable occurrences. My brother and I were fascinated by the spurious antiques and bad bargains of the Rue d\x{201c}Asticot, but often bored when Mr Million insisted on stopping for an hour at the slave market.
It was not a large one, Port-Mimizon not being a center of the trade, and the auctioneers and their merchandise were frequently on a most friendly basis\x{2014}having met several times previously as a succession of owners discovered the same fault. Mr Million never bid, but watched the bidding, motionless, while we kicked our heels and munched the fried bread he had bought at a stall for us. There were sedan chairmen, their legs knotted with muscle, and simpering bath attendants; fighting slaves in chains, with eyes dulled by drugs or blazing with imbecile ferocity; cooks, house servants, a hundred others\x{2014}yet David and I used to beg to be allowed to proceed alone to the library.
This library was a wastefully large building which had held government offices in the French-speaking days. The park in which it had once stood had died of petty corruption, and the library now rose from a clutter of shops and tenements. A narrow thoroughfare led to the main doors, and once we were inside, the squalor of the neighbourhood vanished, replaced by a kind of peeling grandeur. The main desk was directly beneath the dome, and this dome, drawing up with it a spiraling walkaway lined with the library\x{2019}s main collection, floated five hundred feet in the air: a stony sicy whose least chip falling might kill one of the librarians on the spot.
While Mr Million browsed his way majestically up the helix, David and I raced ahead until we were several full turns in advance and could do what we liked. When I was still quite young it would often occur to me that, since my father had written (on the testimony of the lady in pink) a roomful of books, some of them should be here; and I would climb resolutely until I had almost reached the dome, and there rummage. Because the librarians were very lax about reshelving, there seemed always a possibility of finding what I had failed to find before. The shelves towered far above my head, but when I felt myself unobserved I climbed them like ladders, stepping on books when there was no room on the shelves themselves for the square toes of my small brown shoes, and occasionally kicking books to the floor where they remained until out next visit and beyond, evidence of the staff\x{2019}s reluctance to climb that long, coiled slope.
The upper shelves were, if anything, in worse disorder than those more, conveniently located, and one glorious day when I attained the highest of all I found occupying that lofty, dusty position (besides a misplaced astronautics text, The Mile-Long Spaceship, by some German) only a lorn copy of Monday or Tuesday leaning against a book about the assassination of Trotsky, and a crumbling volume of Vernor Vinge\x{2019}s short stories that owed its presence there, or so I suspect, to some long-dead librarian\x{2019}s mistaking the faded V. Vinge on the spine for \x{201c}Winge\x{201d}.
I never found any books of my father\x{2019}s, but I did not regret the long climbs to the top of the dome. If David had come with me, we raced up together, up and down the sloping floor\x{2014}or peered over the rail at Mr Million\x{2019}s slow progress while we debated the feasibility of putting an end to him with one cast of some ponderous work. If David preferred to pursue interests of his own farther down I ascended to the very top where the cap of the dome curved right over my head; and there, from a rusted iron catwalk not much wider than one of the shelves I had been climbing (and I suspect not nearly so strong), opened in turn each of a circle of tiny piercings\x{2014}piercings in a wall of iron, but so shallow a wall that when I had slid the corroded cover plates out of the way I could thrust my head through and feel myself truly outside, with the wind and the circling birds and the lime-spotted expanse of the dome curving away beneath me.
To the west, since it was taller than the surrounding houses and marked by the orange trees on the roof, I could make out our house. To the south, the masts of the ships in the harbor, and in clear weather\x{2014}if it was the right time of day\x{2014}the whitecaps of the tidal race Sainte Anne drew between the peninsulas called First Finger and Thumb. (And once, as I very well recall, while looking south I saw the great geyser of sunlit water when a star-crosser splashed down.) To east and north spread the city proper, the citadel and the grand market and the forests and mountains beyond.
But sooner or later, whether David had accompanied me or gone off on his own, Mr Million summoned us. Then we were forced to go with him to one of the wings to visit this or that science collection. This meant books for lessons. My father insisted that we learn biology, anatomy, and chemistry thoroughly, and under Mr Million\x{2019}s tutelage, learn them we did\x{2014}he never considering a subject mastered until we could discuss every topic mentioned in every book catalogued under the heading. The life sciences were my own favorites, but David preferred languages, literature, and law; for we got a smattering of these as well as anthropology, cybernetics, and psychology.
When he had selected the books that would form our study for the next few days and urged us to choose more for ourselves, Mr Million would retire with us to some quiet corner of one of the science reading rooms, where there were chairs and a table and room sufficient for him to curl the jointed length of his body or align it against a wall or bookcase in a way that left the aisles clear. To designate the formal beginning of our class he used to begin by calling roll, my own name always coming first.
I would say, \x{201c}Here,\x{201d} to show that he had my attention.
\x{201c}And David.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Here.\x{201d} (David has an illustrated Tales From the Odyssey open on his lap where Mr Million cannot see it, but he looks at Mr Million with bright, feigned interest. Sunshine slants down to the table from a high window, and shows the air as warm with dust.)
\x{201c}I wonder if either of you noticed the stone implements in the room through which we passed a few moments ago?\x{201d}
We nod, each hoping the other will speak.
\x{201c}Were they made on Earth, or here on our own planet?\x{201d}
This is a trick question, but an easy one. David says, \x{201c}Neither one. They\x{2019}re plastic.\x{201d} And we giggle.
Mr Million says patiently, \x{201c}Yes, they\x{2019}re plastic reproductions, but from where did the originals come?\x{201d} His face, so similar to my father\x{2019}s, but which I thought of at this time as belonging only to him, so that it seemed a frightening reversal of nature to see it on a living man instead of his screen, was neither interested, nor angry, nor bored; but coolly remote.
David answers, \x{201c}From Sainte Anne.\x{201d} Sainte Anne is the sister planet to our own, revolving with us about a common center as we swing around the sun. \x{201c}The sign said so, and the aborigines made them\x{2014}there weren\x{2019}t any abos here.\x{201d}
Mr Million nods, and turns his impalpable face toward me. \x{201c}Do you feel these stone implements occupied a central place in the lives of their makers? Say no.\x{201d}
\x{201c}No.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Why not?\x{201d}
I think frantically, not helped by David, who is kicking my shins under the table. A glimmering comes.
\x{201c}Talk. Answer at once.\x{201d}
\x{201c}It\x{2019}s obvious, isn\x{2019}t it?\x{201d} (Always a good thing to say when you\x{2019}re not even sure \x{201c}it\x{201d} is even possible.) \x{201c}In the first place, they can\x{2019}t have been very good tools, so why would the abos have relied on them? You might say they needed those obsidian arrowheads and bone fishhooks for getting food, but that\x{2019}s not true. They could poison the water with the juices of certain plants, and for primitive people the most effective way to fish is probably with weirs, or with nets of rawhide or vegetable fiber. Just the same way, trapping or driving animals with fire would be more effective than hunting; and anyway stone tools wouldn\x{2019}t be needed at all for gathering berries and the shoots of edible plants and things like that, which were probably their most important foods\x{2014}those stone things got in the glass case here because the snares and nets rotted away and they\x{2019}re all that\x{2019}s left, so the people that make their living that way pretend they were important.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Good. David? Be original, please. Don\x{2019}t repeat what you\x{2019}ve just heard.\x{201d}
David looks up from his book, his blue eyes scornful of both of us. \x{201c}If you could have asked them, they would have told you that their magic and their religion, the songs they sang and the traditions of their people were what were important. They killed their sacrificial animals with flails of seashells that cut like razors, and they didn\x{2019}t let their men father children until they had had stood enough fire to cripple them for life. They mated with trees and drowned the children to honor their rivers. That was what was important.\x{201d}
With no neck, Mr Million\x{2019}s face nodded. \x{201c}Now we will debate the humanity of those aborigines. David negative and first.\x{201d}
(I kick him, but he has pulled his hard, freckled legs up beneath him, or hidden them behind the legs of his chair, which is cheating.) \x{201c}Humanity,\x{201d} he says in his most objectionable voice, \x{201c}in the history of human thought implies descent from what we may conveniently call Adam; that is, the original Terrestrial stock, and if the two of you don\x{2019}t see that, you\x{2019}re idiots.\x{201d}
I wait for him to continue, but he is finished. To give myself time to think, I say, \x{201c}Mr Million, it\x{2019}s not fair to let him call me names in a debate. Tell him that\x{2019}s not debating, it\x{2019}s fighting, isn\x{2019}t it?\x{201d}
Mr Million says, \x{201c}No personalities, David.\x{201d} (David is already peeking at Polyphemus the Cyclops and Odysseus, hoping I\x{2019}ll go on for a long time. I feel challenged and decide to do so.)
I begin, \x{201c}The argument which holds descent from Terrestrial stock pivotal is neither valid nor conclusive. Not conclusive because it is distinctly possible that the aborigines of Sainte Anne were descendants of some earlier wave of human expansion\x{2014}one, perhaps, even predating The Homeric Greeks.\x{201d}
Mr Million says mildly, \x{201c}I would confine myself to arguments of higher probability if I were you.\x{201d}
I nevertheless gloss upon the Etruscans, Atlantis, and the tenacity and expansionist tendencies of a hypothetical technolological culture occupying Gondwanaland. When I have finished Mr Million says, \x{201c}Now reverse. David, affirmative without repeating.\x{201d}
My brother, of course, has been looking at his book instead of listening, and I kick him with enthusiasm, expecting him to be stuck; but he says, \x{201c}The abos are human because they\x{2019}re all dead.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Explain.\x{201d}
\x{201c}If they were alive it would be dangerous to let them be human because they\x{2019}d ask for things, but with them dead it makes it more interesting if they were, and the settlers killed them all.\x{201d}
And so it goes. The spot of sunlight travels across the black-streaked red of the tabletop\x{2014}traveled across it a hundred times. We would leave through one of the side doors and walk through a neglected areaway between two wings. There would be empty bottles there and wind-scattered papers of all kinds, and once a dead man in bright rags over whose legs we boys skipped while Mr Million rolled silently around him. As we left the areaway for a narrow street, the bugles of the garrison at the citadel (sounding so far away) would call the troopers to their evening mess. In the Rue d\x{2019}Asticot the lamplighter would be at work, and the shops shut behind their iron grilles. The sidewalks magically clear of old furniture would seem broad and bare.
Our own Saltimbanque Street would be very different, with the first revelers arriving. White-haired, hearty men guiding very young men and boys, men and boys handsome and muscular but a shade overfed; young men who made diffident jokes and smiled with excellent teeth at them. These were always the early ones, and when I was a little older I sometimes wondered if they were early only because the white-haired men wished to have their pleasure and yet a good night\x{2019}s sleep as well, or if it were because they knew the young men they were introducing to my father\x{2019}s establishment would be drowsy and irritable <<after midnight|13>>, like children who have been kept up too late.
Because Mr Million did not want us to use the alleys after dark we came in the front entrance with the white-haired men and their nephews and sons. There was a garden there, not much bigger than a small room and recessed into the windowless front of the house. In it were beds of ferns the size of graves; a little fountain whose water fell upon rods of glass to make a continual tinkling, and which had to be protected from the street boys; and, with his feet firmly planted, indeed almost buried in moss, an iron statue of a dog with three heads.
It was this statue, I suppose, that gave our house its popular name of Maison du Chien, though there may have been a reference to our surname as well. The three heads were sleekly powerful with pointed muzzles and ears. One was snarling and one, the center head, regarded the world of garden and street with a look of tolerant interest. The third, the one nearest the brick path that led to our door, was\x{2014}there is no other term for it\x{2014}frankly grinning; and it was the custom for my father\x{2019}s patrons to pat this head between the ears as they came up the path. Their fingers had polished the spot to the consistency of black glass.",

            "Spring surprised me, as she always does those of us who remain most of our lives indoors. One day, while I still thought, if I thought about the weather at all, in terms of winter, David threw open the window and insisted that I go with him into the park\x{2014}and it was April. Mr Million went with us, and I remember that as we stepped out the front door into the little garden that opened into the street, a garden I had last seen banked with the snow shoveled from the path, but which was now bright with early bulbs and the chiming of the fountain, David tapped the iron dog on its grinning muzzle and recited: \x{201c}And thence the dog/With fourfold head brought to these realms of light.\x{201d}
I made some trivial remark about his having miscounted.
\x{201c}Oh, no. Old Cerberus has four heads, don\x{2019}t you know that? The fourth\x{2019}s her maidenhead, and she\x{2019}s such a bitch no dog can take it from her.\x{201d} Even Mr Million chuckled, but I thought afterward, looking at David\x{2019}s ruddy good health and the foreshadowing of manhood already apparent in the set of his shoulders, that if, as I had always thought of them, the three heads represented Ma\x{ee}tre, Madame, and Mr Million, that is, my father, my aunt (David\x{2019}s maidenhead, I suppose), and my tutor, then indeed a fourth would have to be welded in place soon for David himself.
The park must have been a paradise for him, but in my poor health I found it bleak enough and spent most of the morning huddled on a bench, watching David play squash. <<Toward noon|13>> I was joined, not on my own bench, but on another close enough for there to be a feeling of proximity, by a dark-haired girl with one ankle in a cast. She was brought there, on crutches, by a sort of nurse or governess who seated herself, I felt sure deliberately, between the girl and me. This unpleasant woman was, however, too straight-backed for her chaperonage to succeed completely. She sat on the edge of the bench, while the girl, with her injured leg thrust out before her, slumped back and thus gave me a good view of her profile, which was beautiful; and occasionally, when she turned to make some remark to the creature with her, I could study her full face\x{2014}carmine lips and violet eyes, a round rather than an oval face, with a broad point of black hair dividing the forehead; archly delicate black eyebrows and long, curling lashes. When a vendor, an old woman, came selling Cantonese egg rolls Oonger than your hand, and still so hot from the boiling fat that they needed to be eaten with great caution as though they were in some way alive), I made her my messenger and, as well as buying one for myself, sent her with two scalding delicacies to the girl and her attendant monster.
The monster, of course, refused; the girl, I was charmed to see, pleaded; her huge eyes and bright cheeks eloquently proclaiming arguments I was unfortunately just too far away to hear but could follow in pantomime: it would be a gratuitous insult to a blameless stranger to refuse; she was hungry and had intended to buy an egg roll in any event\x{2014}how thriftless to object when what she had wished for was tendered free! The vending woman, who clearly delighted in her role as go-between, announced herself on the point of weeping at the thought of being forced to refund my gold (actually a bill of small denomination nearly as greasy as the paper in which her wares were wrapped, and considerably dirtier), and eventually their voices grew loud enough for me to hear the girl\x{2019}s, which was a clear and very pleasing contralto. In the end, of course, they accepted; the monster conceded me a frigid nod, and the girl winked at me behind her back.
Half an hour later when David and Mr Million, who had been watching him from the edge of the court, asked if I wanted lunch, I told them I did, thinking that when we returned I could take a seat closer to the girl without being brazen about it. We ate, I (at least so I fear) very impatiently, in a clean little cafe close to the flower market; but when we came back to the park the girl and her governess were gone.
We returned to the house, and about an hour afterward my father sent for me. I went with some trepidation, since it was much earlier than was customary for our interview\x{2014}before the first patrons had arrived, in fact, while I usually saw him only after the last had gone. I need not have feared. He began by asking about my health, and when I said it seemed better than it had been during most of the winter he began, in a self-conscious and even pompous way, as different from his usual fatigued incisiveness as could be imagined, to talk about his business and the need a young man had to prepare himself to earn a living. He said, \x{201c}You are a scientific scholar, I believe.\x{201d}
I said I hoped I was in a small way, and braced myself for the usual attack upon the uselessness of studying chemistry or biophysics on a world like ours where the industrial base was so small, of no help at the civil service examinations, does not even prepare one for trade, and so on. He said instead, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m glad to hear it. To be frank, I asked Mr Million to encourage you in that as much as he could. He would have done it anyway I\x{2019}m sure; he did with me. These studies will not only be of great satisfaction to you, but will . . .\x{201d} he paused, cleared his throat, and massaged his face and scalp with his hands, \x{201c}be valuable in all sorts of ways. And they are, as you might say, a family tradition.\x{201d}
I said, and indeed felt, that I was very happy to hear that.
\x{201c}Have you seen my lab? Behind the big mirror there?\x{201d}
I hadn\x{2019}t, though I had known that such a suite of rooms existed beyond the sliding mirror in the library, and the servants occasionally spoke of his \x{201c}dispensary\x{201d} where he compounded doses for them, examined monthly the girls we employed, and occasionally prescribed treatment for \x{201c}riends\x{201d} of patrons, men recklessly imprudent who had failed (as the wise patrons had not) to confine their custom to our establishment exclusively. I told him I should very much like to see it.
He smiled. \x{201c}But we are wandering from our topic. Science is of great value; but you will find, as I have, that it consumes more money than it produces. You will want apparatus and books and many other things, as well as a livelihood for yourself. We have a not unprofitable business here, and though I hope to live a long time\x{2014}thanks in part to science\x{2014}you are the heir, and it will be yours in the end . . .\x{201d}
(So I was older than David!)
\x{201c}. . . every phase of what we do. None of them, believe me, are unimportant.\x{201d}
I had been so surprised, and in fact elated, by my discovery that I had missed a part of what he said. I nodded, which seemed safe.
\x{201c}Good. I want you to begin by answering the front door. One of the maids has been doing it, and for the first month or so she\x{2019}ll stay with you, since there\x{2019}s more to be learned there than you think. I\x{2019}ll tell Mr Million, and he can make the arrangements.\x{201d}
I thanked him, and he indicated that the interview was over by opening the door of the library. I could hardly believe, as I went out, that he was the same man who devoured my life in the early hours of almost every morning.",

            "I mentioned the incident to Phaedria the next time we met, but she was more interested in learning about my father\x{2019}s house. Phaedria, if I have not used her name before now, was the girl who had sat near me while I watched David play squash. She had been introduced to me on my next visit to the park by no one less than the monster herself, who had helped her to a seat beside me and, miracle of miracles, promptly retreated to a point which, though not out of sight, was at least beyond earshot. Phaedria had thrust her broken ankle in front of her, halfway across the graveled path, and smiled a most charming smile. \x{201c}You don t object to my sitting here?\x{201d} She had perfect teeth.
\x{201c}I\x{2019}m delighted.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You\x{2019}re surprised too. Your eyes get big when you\x{2019}re surprised, did you know that?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am surprised. I\x{2019}ve come here looking for you several times, but you haven\x{2019}t been here.\x{201d}
\x{201c}We\x{2019}ve come looking for you, and you haven\x{2019}t been here either, but I suppose one can\x{2019}t really spend a great deal of time in a park.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I would have,\x{201d} I said, \x{201c}if I\x{2019}d known you were looking for me. I went here as much as I could anyway. I was afraid that she . . .\x{201d} I jerked my head at the monster, \x{201c}wouldn\x{2019}t let you come back. How did you persuade her?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t,\x{201d} Phaedria said. \x{201c}Can\x{2019}t you guess? Don\x{2019}t you know anything?\x{201d}
I confessed that I did not. I felt stupid, and I was stupid, at least in the things I said, because so much of my mind was caught up not in formulating answers to her remarks but in committing to memory the lilt of her voice, the purple of her eyes, even the faint perfume of her skin and the soft, warm touch of her breath on my cool cheek.
\x{201c}So you see,\x{201d} Phaedria was saying, \x{201c}that\x{2019}s how it is with me. When Aunt Uranie\x{2014}she\x{2019}s only a poor cousin of mother\x{2019}s, really\x{2014}got home and told him about you he found out who you are, and here I am.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} I said, and she laughed.
Phaedria was one of those girls raised between the hope of marriage and the thought of sale. Her father\x{2019}s affairs, as she herself said, were \x{201c}unsettled\x{201d}. He speculated in ship cargoes, mostly from the south\x{2014}textiles and drugs. He owed, most of the time, large sums which the lenders could not hope to collect unless they were willing to allow more to recoup. He might die a pauper, but in the meanwhile he had raised his daughter with every detail of education and plastic surgery attended to. If when she reached marriageable age he could afford a good dowry, she would link him with some wealthy family. If he were pressed for money instead, a girl so reared would bring fifty times the price of a common street child. Our family, of course, would be ideal for either purpose.
\x{201c}Tell me about your house,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}Do you know what the kids call it? \x{2018}The Cave Canem\x{201d}, or sometimes just \x{201c}The Cave\x{201d}. The boys all think-it\x{2019}s a big thing to have been there and they lie about it. Most of them haven\x{2019}t.\x{201d}
But I wanted to talk about Dr Marsch and the sciences of Earth, and I was nearly as anxious to find out about her own world, \x{201c}the kids\x{201d} she mentioned so casually, her school and family as she was to learn about us. Also, although I was willing to detail the services my father\x{2019}s girls rendered their benefactors, there were some things, such as my aunt\x{2019}s floating down the stairwell, that I was adverse to discussing. But we bought egg rolls from the same old woman to eat in the chill sunlight and exchanged confidences and somehow parted not only lovers but friends, promising to meet again the next day.
At some time during the night, I believe at almost the same time that I returned\x{2014}or to speak more accurately was returned since I could scarcely walk\x{2014}to my bed after a session of hours with my father, the weather changed. The masked exhalation of late spring or early summer crept through the shutters, and the fire in our little grate seemed to extinguish itself for shame almost at once. My father\x{2019}s va!et opened the window for me and there poured into the room that fragrance that tells of the melting of the last snows beneath the deepest and darkest evergreens on the north sides of mountains. I had arranged with Phaedria to meet at <<ten|9g>>, and before going to my father\x{2019}s library I had posted a note on the escritoire beside my bed, asking that I be awakened an hour earlier; and that night I slept with the fragrance in my nostrils and the thought\x{2014}half-plan, half-dream\x{2014}in my mind that by some means Phaedria and I would elude her aunt entirely and find a deserted lawn where blue and yellow flowers dotted the short grass.
When I woke, it was <<an hour past noon|10>>, and rain drove in sheets past the window. Mr Million, who was reading a book on the far side of the room, told me that it had been raining like that since six, and for that reason he had not troubled to wake me. I had a splitting headache, as I often did after a long session with my father, and took one of the powders he had prescribed to relieve it. They were gray, and smelled of anise.
\x{201c}You look unwell,\x{201d} Mr Million said.
\x{201c}I was hoping to go to the park.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I know.\x{201d} He rolled across the room toward me, and I recalled that Dr Marsch had called him an \x{201c}unbound\x{201d} simulator. For the first time since I had satisfied myself about them when I was quite small, I bent over (at some cost to my head) and read the almost obliterated stampings on his main cabinet. There was only the name of a cybernetics company on Earth and, in French as I had always supposed, his name: M.Million\x{2014}\x{201c}Monsieur\x{201d} or \x{201c}Mister\x{201d} Million. Then, as startling as a blow from behind to a man musing in a comfortable chair, I remembered that a dot was employed in some algebras for multiplication. He saw my change of expression at once. \x{201c}A thousand million word core capacity,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}An English billion or a French milliard, the M being the Roman numeral for one thousand, of course. I thought you understood that some time ago.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You are an unbound simulator. What is a bound simulator, and whom are you simulating\x{2014}my father?\x{201d}
\x{201c}No.\x{201d} The face in the screen, Mr Million\x{2019}s face as I had always thought of it, shook its head. \x{201c}Call me, call the person simulated, at least, your great-grandfather. He\x{2014}I\x{2014}am dead. In order to achieve simulation, it is necessary to examine the cells of the brain, layer by layer, with a beam of accelerated particles so that the neural patterns can be reproduced, we say \x{2018}core imaged\x{2019}, in the computer. The process is fatal.\x{201d}
I asked after a moment, \x{201c}And a bound simulator?\x{201d}
\x{201c}If the simulation is to have a body that looks human the mechanical body must be linked\x{2014}\x{2018}bound\x{2019}\x{2014}to a remote core, since the smallest billion word core cannot be made even approximately as small as a human brain.\x{201d} He paused again, and for an instant his face dissolved into myriad sparkling dots, swirling like dust motes in a sunbeam. \x{201c}I am sorry. For once you wish to listen but I do not wish to lecture. I was told, a very long time ago, just before the operation, that my simulation\x{2014}this\x{2014}would be capable of emotion in certain circumstances. Until today I had always thought they lied.\x{201d} I would have stopped him if I could, but he rolled out of the room before I could recover from my surprise.
For a long time, I suppose an hour or more, I sat listening to the drumming of the rain and thinking about Phaedria and about what Mr Million had said, all of it confused with my father\x{2019}s questions of the night before, questions which had seemed to steal their answers from me so that I was empty, and dreams had come to flicker in the emptiness, dreams of fences and walls and the concealing ditches called ha-has, that contain a barrier you do not see until you are about to tumble on it. Once I had dreamed of standing in a paved court fenced with Corinthian pillars so close set that I could not force my body between them, although in the dream I was only a child of three or four. After trying various places for a long time, I had noticed that each column was carved with a word\x{2014}the only one that I could remember was carapace\x{2014}and that the paving stones of the courtyard were mortuary tablets like those set into the floors in some of the old French churches, with my own name and a different date on each.
This dream pursued me even when I tried to think of Phaedria, and when a maid brought me hot water\x{2014}for I now shaved twice a week\x{2014}I found that I was already holding my razor in my hand, and had in fact cut myself with it so that the blood had streaked my nightclothes and run down on to the sheets.",

            "I have thought since, may times, of that girl as I saw her leaving: the high-heeled platform shoes and grotesquely long legs, the backless dress dipping an inch below the coccyx. The bare nape of her neck; her hair piled and teased and threaded with ribbons and tiny lights. As she closed the door she was ending, though she could not have known it, the world she and I had known.
\x{201c}She\x{2019}ll be waiting when you come out,\x{201d} my father said to Marsch.
\x{201c}And if she\x{2019}s not, I\x{2019}m sure you can supply others.\x{201d} The anthropologist\x{2019}s green eyes seemed to glow in the lamplight. \x{201c}But now, how can I help you?\x{201d}
\x{201c}You study race. Could you call a group of similar men thinking similar thoughts a race?\x{201d}
\x{201c}And women,\x{201d} Marsch said, smiling.
\x{201c}And here,\x{201d} my father continued, \x{201c}here on Sainte Croix, you are gathering material to take back with you to Earth?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am gathering material, certainly. Whether or not I shall return to the mother planet is problematical.\x{201d}
I must have looked at him sharply; he turned his smile toward me, and it became, if possible, even more patronizing than before. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re surprised?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I\x{2019}ve always considered Earth the center of scientific thought.\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}I can easily imagine a scientist leaving it to do field work, but\x{2014}\x{201d}
\x{201c}But it is inconceivable that one might want to stay in the field?
\x{201c}Consider my position. You are not alone\x{2014}happily for me\x{2014}in respecting the mother world\x{2019}s gray hairs and wisdom. As an Earth-trained man I\x{2019}ve been offered a department in your university at almost any salary I care to name, with a sabbatical every second year. And the trip from here to Earth requires twenty years of Newtonian time; only six months subjectively for me, of course, but when I return, if I do, my education will be forty years out of date. No, I\x{2019}m afraid your planet may have acquired an intellectual luminary.\x{201d}
My father said, \x{201c}We\x{2019}re straying from the subject, I think.\x{201d}
Marsch nodded, then added, \x{201c}But I was about to say that an anthropologist is peculiarly equipped to make himself at home in any culture\x{2014}even in so strange a one as this family has constructed about itself. I think I may call it a family, since there are two members resident besides yourself. You don\x{2019}t object to my addressing the pair of you in the singular?\x{201d}
He looked at me as if expecting a protest, then when I said nothing: \x{201c}I mean your son David\x{2014}that, and not brother is his real relationship to your continuing personality\x{2014}and the woman you call your aunt. She is in reality daughter to an earlier\x{2014}shall we say \x{2018}version\x{2019}?\x{2014}of yourself.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You\x{2019}re trying to tell me I\x{2019}m a cloned duplicate of my father, and I see both of you expect me to be shocked. I\x{2019}m not. I\x{2019}ve suspected it for some time.\x{201d}
My father said: \x{201c}I\x{2019}m glad to hear that. Frankly, when I was your age the discovery disturbed me a great deal; I came into my father\x{2019}s library\x{2014}this room\x{2014}to confront him, and I intended to kill him.\x{201d}
Dr Marsch asked, \x{201c}And did you?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t think it matters\x{2014}the point is that it was my intention. I hope that having you here will make things easier for Number Five.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Is that what you call him?\x{201d}
\x{201c}It\x{2019}s more convenient since his name is the same as my own.\x{201d}
\x{201c}He is your fifth clone-produced child?\x{201d}
\x{201c}My fifth experiment? No.\x{201d} My father\x{2019}s hunched, high shoulders wrapped in the dingy scarlet of his old dressing-gown made him look like some savage bird; and I remembered having read in a book of natural history of one called the red-shouldered hawk. His pet monkey, grizzled now with age, had climbed on to the desk. \x{201c}No, more like my fiftieth, if you must know. I used to do them for drill. You people who have never tried it think the technique is simple because you\x{2019}ve heard it can be done, but you don\x{2019}t know how difficult it is to prevent spontaneous differences. Every gene dominant in myself had to remain dominant, and people are not garden peas\x{2014}few things are governed by simple Mendelian pairs.\x{201d}
Marsch asked, \x{201c}You destroyed your failures?\x{201d}
I said: \x{201c}He sold them. When I was a child I used to wonder why Mr Million stopped to look at the slaves in the market. Since then I\x{2019}ve found out.\x{201d} My scalpel was still in its case in my pocket; I could feel it.
\x{201c}Mr Million,\x{201d} my father said, \x{201c}is perhaps a bit more sentimental than I\x{2014}besides, I don\x{2019}t like to go out. You see, Doctor, your supposition that we are all truly the same individual will have to be modified. We have our little variations.\x{201d}
Dr Marsch was about to reply, but I interrupted him. \x{201c}Why?\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}Why David and me? Why Aunt Jeannine a long time ago? Why go on with it?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} my father said, \x{201c}why? We ask the question to ask the question.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t understand you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I seek self-knowledge. If you want to put it this way, we seek self-knowledge. You are here because I did and do, and I am here because the individual behind me did\x{2014}who was himself originated by the one whose mind is simulated in Mr Million. And one of the questions whose answers we seek is why we seek. But there is more than that.\x{201d} He leaned forward, and the little ape lifted its white muzzle and bright, bewildered eyes to stare into his face. \x{201c}We wish to discover why we fail, why others rise and change and we remain here.\x{201d}
I thought of the yacht I had talked about with Phaedria and said, \x{201c}I won\x{2019}t stay here.\x{201d} Dr Marsch smiled.
My father said, \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t think you understand me. I don\x{2019}t necessarily mean here physically, but here, socially and intellectually. I have traveled, and you may, but\x{2014}\x{201d}
\x{201c}But you end here,\x{201d} Dr Marsch said.
\x{201c}We end at this level!\x{201d} It was the only time, I think, that I ever saw my father excited. He was almost speechless as he waved at the notebooks and tapes that thronged the walls. \x{201c}After how many generations? We do not achieve fame or the rule of even this miserable little colony planet. Something must be changed, but what?\x{201d} He glared at Dr Marsch.
\x{201c}You are not unique,\x{201d} Dr Marsch said, then smiled. \x{201c}That sounds like a truism, doesn\x{2019}t it? But I wasn\x{2019}t referring to your duplicating yourself. I meant that since it became possible, back on Earth during the last quarter of the twentieth century, it has been done in such chains a number of times. We have borrowed a term from engineering to describe it, and call it the process of relaxation\x{2014}a bad nomenclature, but the best we have. Do you know what relaxation in the engineering sense is?\x{201d}
\x{201c}No.\x{201d}
\x{201c}There are problems which are not directly soluble, but which can be solved by a succession of approximations. In heat transfer, for example, it may not be possible to calculate initially the temperature at every point on the surface of an unusually shaped body. But the engineer, or his computer, can assume reasonable temperatures, see how nearly stable the assumed values would be, then make new assumptions based on the result. As the levels of approximation progress, the successive sets become more and more similar until there is essentially no change. That is why I said the two of you are essentially one individual.\x{201d}
\x{201c}What I want you to do,\x{201d} my father said impatiently, \x{201c}is to make Number Five understand that the experiments I have performed on him, particularly the narcotherapeutic examinations he resents so much, are necessary. That if we are to become more than we have been we must find out\x{2014}\x{201d} He had been almost shouting, and he stopped abruptly to bring his voice under control. \x{201c}That is the reason he was produced, the reason for David too\x{2014}I hoped to learn something from an outcrossing.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Which was the rationale, no doubt,\x{201d} Dr Marsch said, \x{201c}for the existence of Dr Veil as well, in an earlier generation. But as far as your examinations of your younger self are concerned, it would be just as useful for him to examine you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Wait a moment,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}You keep saying that he and I are identical. That\x{2019}s incorrect. I can see that we\x{2019}re similar in some respects, but I\x{2019}m not really like my father.\x{201d}
\x{201c}There are no differences that cannot be accounted for by age. You are what? <<Eighteen|9k:0>>? And you,\x{201d} he looked toward my father, \x{201c}I should say are nearly fifty. There are only two forces, you see, which act to differentiate between human beings: they are heredity and environment, nature and nurture. And since the personality is largely formed during the first three years of life, it is the environment provided by the home which is decisive. Now every person is born into some home environment, though it may be such a harsh one that he dies of it; and no person, except in this situation we call anthropological relaxation, provides that environment himself- it is furnished for him by the preceding generation.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Just because both of us grew up in this house\x{2014}\x{201d}
\x{201c}Which you built and furnished and filled with the people you chose. But wait a moment. Let\x{2019}s talk about a man neither of you have ever seen, a man born in a place provided by parents quite different from himself: I mean the first of you . . .\x{201d}
I was no longer listening. I had come to kill my father, and it was necessary that Dr Marsch leave. I watched him as he leaned forward in his chair, his long, white hands making incisive little gestures, his cruel lips moving in a frame of black hair; I watched him and I heard nothing. It was as though I had gone deaf or as if he could communicate only by his thoughts, and I, knowing the thoughts were silly lies had shut them out. I said, \x{201c}You are from Sainte Anne.\x{201d}
He looked at me in surprise, halting in the midst of a senseless sentence. \x{201c}I have been there, yes. I spent several years on Sainte Anne before coming here.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You were born there. You studied your anthropology there from books written on Earth twenty years ago. You are an abo, or at least half-abo; but we are men.\x{201d}
Marsch glanced at my father, then said: \x{201c}The abos are gone. Scientific opinion on Sainte Anne holds that they have been extinct for almost a century.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You didn\x{2019}t believe that when you came to see my aunt.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I\x{2019}ve never accepted Veil\x{2019}s Hypothesis. I called on everyone here who had published anything in my field. Really, I don\x{2019}t have time to listen to this.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You are an abo and not from Earth.\x{201d}
And in a short time my father and I were alone.",

            "By the time Sandwalker was thirteen he was nearly as tall as a man. The years of his world, where the ships turned back, were long years; and his bones stretched, and his hands\x{2014}large and strong. There was no fat on him (but there was no fat on anyone in the country of sliding stones) and he was a foodbringer, though he dreamed strange dreams. When his thirteenth year was almost done his mother and old Bloodyfinger and Flying Feet decided to send him to the priest, and so he went out alone into the wide, high country, where the cliffs rise like banks of dark cloud, and all living things are unimportant beside the wind, the sun, the dust, the sand, and the stones. He traveled by day, alone, always south, and at night caught rock-mice to leave with twisted necks before his sleeping place. In the morning these were sometimes gone.
<<About noon|13>> on the fifth day he reached the gorge of Thunder Always, where the priest was. By great good luck he had been able to kill a feign-pheasant to bring as a gift, and he carried this by its hairy legs, with the long naked head and neck trailing behind him as he walked; and he, knowing that he was that day a man, and that he would reach the gorge before the sun set (Flying Feet had told him landmarks and he had passed them) walked proudly, but with some fear.
He heard Thunder Always before he saw it. The ground was nearly level, dotted with rock and bush, and held no hint that there was less than stone forever beneath his feet. There was a faint grumbling, a muttering of the air. As he walked on he saw a faint mist rising. This could not indicate the gorge of Thunder Always because he could see plainly farther ground, not far off, through it; and the sound was not loud.
He took three steps more. The sound was a roaring. The earth shook. At his feet a narrow crevice opened down and down to white water far below. He was wet with the spray, and the dust ran from his body. He had been warm and he was chill. The stones were smooth and wet and shook. Carefully he sat, his legs over the darkness and white water far below, and then, feet foremost as a man lets himself down into a lower place, climbed into Thunder Always. Not until he searched just where the water foamed, where the sky was a slot of purple no wider than a finger and sprinkled with day stars, did he find the priest\x{2019}s cave.",

            "When Sandwalker woke he was stiff and cold. He had had such dreams before, but they faded quickly and if there was any message in this one he did not understand it, and he knew that Lastvoice was certainly not the priest whose ghost he had invited. For a few minutes he toyed with the idea of staying in the gorge until he was ready to sleep again, but the thought of the clear morning sky above and the warmth of the sun on the plateau decided him against it. It was <<almost noon|3b>> when, ravenously hungry, he made the last climb and flung himself down to rest on the warm, dusty ground.
In an hour he was ready to rise again and hunt. He was a good hunter, young and strong, and more patient than the long-toothed bitch cat that waits flattened on a ledge all day, two days, remembering her cubs that weaken as they mew for her and sigh, and sleep, and cry again until she kills. There had been others when Sandwalker was only a year or two younger; not, perhaps, quite so strong as he; others who, after running and stalking and hunting again until the sun was almost down had come back to the sleeping place with hands empty and slack bellies, hoping for leavings and begging their mothers for breasts now belonging to a younger child. These were dead. They had learned the truth that the sleeping place is easily found by a food-bringer, not hard for a full belly to find; but shifts and turns before hungry mouths until it is lost in the stones, and on the third empty day is gone forever.
And so for two days Sandwalker hunted as only hill-men hunt, seeing everything, gleaning everything, sniffing out the nest of the owl-mouse to swallow her children like shrimp and chew the hoarded seeds to sweet pulp; creeping, his skin the cold stone color of the dust, his wild hair breaking the telltale silhouette of his head; silent as the fog that reaches into the high country and is not seen until it touches the cheek (when it blinds).
An hour before full dark of the second day he crossed the trail of a tick-deer, the hornless little ungulate that lives by licking up the brown blood drinkers its hoofs\x{2019} click calls from their hiding places near water holes. He followed it while sisterworld rose and ruled, and was still following when she had sunk half her blue wealth of continents behind the farthest of the smoking mountains of the west. Then he heard spring up before him the feasting song the Shadow children sing when they have killed enough for every mouth, and he knew that he had lost.
In the great old days of long dreaming, when God was king of men, men had walked unafraid among the Shadow children by night, and the Shadow children, unafraid, had sought the company of men by day. But the long dreaming had given its years to the river long ago, floating down to the clammy meadowmeres and death. Yet a great hunter, thought Sandwalker, (and then because he had held since least boyhood that milk-gift that allows a man to look from eyes outside his own and laugh he added, a great hunter who was very hungry) might attempt the old ways again. God, surely, orders all things. The Shadow children might slay by the right hands and the left while the sun slept, but what fools they\x{2019}d look if they tried to kill him if God did not wish it, by night or day.
Silently, but proud and straight, he strode on until sisterworld\x{2019}s blue light showed the place where, like bats around spilled blood, the Shadow children ringed the tick-deer. Long before he reached them their heads turned, on sterns unhindered as the necks of owls. \x{201c}Morning met where much food is,\x{201d} Sandwalker said politely.
While he walked five paces there was no sound, then a mouth not human answered, \x{201c}Much food indeed.\x{201d}
Women at the sleeping place, wishing to frighten children still playing when their shadows were longer than themselves, said the Shadow children\x{2019}s teeth dripped poison. Sandwalker did not believe it, but he remembered this when the other spoke. He knew \x{201c}much food\x{201d} did not mean the tick-deer, but he said: \x{201c}That is well. I heard your song\x{2014}you sang of many mouths and all full. It was I who drove your meat to you, and I ask a share\x{2014}or I kill the largest of you to eat myself, and the rest may dine upon the bones when I have finished. It is all one to me.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Men are not as you. Men do not eat the flesh of their kind.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You mean yourselves? Only when you are hungry, but you are hungry all the time.\x{201d}
Several voices said softly, \x{201c}No,\x{201d} drawing out the word. \x{201c}A man I know\x{2014}Flying Feet, a tall man and not afraid of the sun\x{2014}killed one of you and left the head for night-offering. When he woke, the skull was stripped.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Foxes,\x{201d} said a voice that had not spoken before, \x{201c}or it was a native boy of his own get he killed, which is more likely. Mice you left us while you came here, and now you would be repaid in deer\x{2019}s flesh. Dear mice indeed. We should have strangled you while you slept.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You would have lost many in the attempt.\x{201d} \x{201c}I could kill you now. I alone. So we butcher your brats that come whimpering to.us\x{2014}quiet them and dine well.\x{201d} One of the dark figures rose.
\x{201c}I am no suckling\x{2014}I have fourteen summers. And I do not come starving. I have eaten today and I will eat again.\x{201d}
The Shadow Child who had risen took a step forward. Several of the others reached toward him as though to stop him, but did not. \x{201c}Come!\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}Do you think to call me from the sleeping place to kill among the rocks? Baby killer!\x{201d} He flexed his knees and hands and felt the strength that lived in his arms. Before making his bold approach he had resolved that if the Shadow children tried to kill him he would flee at once without trying to fight\x{2014}he was certain that he could quickly outdistance theii short legs. But he was equally sure now that whether the poisoned bite was real or not, he could deal with the diminutive figure facing him.
The voice which had spoken to him first said urgently, but so softly it was almost a whisper, \x{201c}You must not harm him. He is sacred.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I did not come to fight you,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. T only want a fair portion of the tick-deer I drove into your hands. You sing that you have much.\x{201d}
The Shadow Child who had risen to face him said, \x{201c}With my smallest finger, little native animal, I will break your bones until the ends burst through your skin.\x{201d}
Sandwalker edged away from the talons the other thrust toward him and announced contemptuously, \x{201c}If you are his blood, make him squat again\x{2014}or he is mine.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Sacred,\x{201d} their voices replied. The sound of the word was like the night wind that looks for the sleeping place and never finds it.
His left hand would bat the shrunken claws aside; his right take the small, too-supple throat in the grip that killed. Sandwalker set his feet and waited, crouching, the slight farther advance that would bring the shuffling figure within sure reach. And then, perhaps because at the edge of sight a mile-wide plume of smoke from the Mountains of Manhood had blown aside to reveal her, sisterworld\x{2019}s light fell, in the instant before setting and as quickly as lightning-glare, on The Shadow Child\x{2019}s face. It was dark and weak, huge eyes above sagging flesh, the cheeks sunken, the nose and mouth, from which a thick liquid ran, no larger than an infant\x{2019}s.
But though Sandwalker remembered these things later he did not notice them in the brief flash of blue light. Instead he saw the face of all men, and the strength they think theirs when they are full of meat, and that they are fools to be destroyed with a breath; and because Sandwalker was young he had never seen that thing before. When the talons touched his throat he tore himself away, and, gasping and choking for a reason he could not understand, dodged back toward the knot of dark bodies about the tick-deer.
\x{201c}Look,\x{201d} said the voice which had spoken to him first. \x{201c}He weeps. Boy, here, quickly, sit with us. Eat.\x{201d}
Sandwalker squatted, drawn down by their small, dark hands, beside the tick-deer with the others. Someone said to The Shadow Child whose fingers had stretched for his throat a moment before, \x{201c}You mustn\x{2019}t hurt him; he\x{2019}s our guest.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Ah.\x{201d}
\x{201c}It\x{2019}s all right to play with them, of course; it keeps them in their place. But let him eat now.\x{201d}
Another put a gobbet of the tick-deer\x{2019}s flesh into Sandwalker\x{2019}s hands, and as he always had, he gorged it before it could be snatched away. The Shadow Child who had threatened him laid a hand on his shoulder. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry I frightened you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}It\x{2019}s all right.\x{201d}
Sisterworld had set and, no longer robbed of their brilliance, the constellations blazed across the autumn sky: Burning Hair Woman, bearded Five Legs, Rose of Amethyst that the people of the meadowmeres, the marshmen, called Thousand Feelers and the Fish. The tick-deer was sweet in Sandwalker\x{2019}s mouth and sweeter in his belly, and he felt a sudden content. The shrunken figures around him were his friends. They had given him to eat. It was good to be sitting thus, with friends and food, while Burning Hair Woman stood on her head in the night sky.
The voice that had addressed him first (he could not, for a time, make out from whose mouth it came) said: \x{201c}You are our friend now. It has been a long time since we\x{2019}ve taken a shadow-friend from among the native population.\x{201d}
Sandwalker did not know what was meant, but it seemed polite, and safe, to nod; he did so.
\x{201c}You say we sing. When you came you said we sang The Song of Many Mouths and All Full. There is a singing in you now, a happy song, though without counterpoint.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Who are you?\x{201d} Sandwalker asked. \x{201c}I can\x{2019}t tell which of you is talking.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Here.\x{201d} Two of the Shadow children edged (apparently) aside, and a dark area which Sandwalker had thought was only the star-shadow of a stone straightened and showed a shrunken face and bright eyes.
\x{201c}Well met,\x{201d} said Sandwalker, and gave his name.
\x{201c}I am called the Old Wise One,\x{201d} said the oldest of the Shadow children. \x{201c}Well met truly.\x{201d} Sandwalker noticed that the stars could be seen faintly through the Old Wise One\x{2019}s back, so he was a ghost; but this did not greatly bother Sandwalker\x{2014}ghosts (though they most frequently stayed in the dreamworld as who would not if he might) were a fact of life, and a helpful ghost could be a strong ally.
\x{201c}You think me a shadow of the dead,\x{201d} said the Old Wise One, \x{201c}but it is not so.\x{201d}
\x{201c}We are all,\x{201d} Sandwalker pronounced diplomatically, \x{201c}but shadows cast ahead of them.\x{201d}
\x{201c}No,\x{201d} said the Old Wise One, \x{201c}I am not that. Since you are a shadowfriend, now I will tell you what I am. You see all these others\x{2014}your friends as truly as I\x{2014}gathered about this carcass?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes.\x{201d} (Sandwalker had been counting them lest another appear. There were seven.)
\x{201c}You would say that these sing. There is The Song of Many Mouths and All Full, The Bending Sky-Paths Song that none may corne, The Hunting Song, The Song of Ancient Sorrows we sing when the Fighting Lizard is high in the summer sky and we see our old home as a little yellow gem in his tail. And so on. Your people say these songs sometimes disturb your dreams.\x{201d}
Sandwalker nodded, his mouth full.
\x{201c}Now when you speak to me, or your own people sing at your sleeping places, that singing is a shaking in the air. When you speak, or one of these others speaks to you, that, too, is a shaking in the air.\x{201d}
\x{201c}When the thunder speaks,\x{201d} said Sandwalker, \x{201c}that is a shaking. And now I feel a small shaking in my throat when I talk to you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes, your throat shakes itself and thus the air, as a man shakes a bush by first shaking his arm which holds it. But when we sing it is not the air that shakes. We shake extension; and I am the song all the Shadow children sing, their thought when they think as one. Hold your hands before you thus, not touching. Now think of your hands gone. That is what we shake.\x{201d}
Sandwalker said, \x{201c}That is nothing.\x{201d}
\x{201c}That which you call nothing is what holds all things apart. When it is gone, all the worlds will come together in a fiery death from which new worlds will be born. But now listen to me. As you are named shadowfriend you must learn before this night is over to call our help when you require it. It is easily done, and it is done this way: when you hear our singing\x{2014}and you will find now that if you listen well, lying or sitting without motion and bending your thought to us, you may hear us very far off\x{2014}you, in your mind, must sing the same song. Sing with us, and we will hear the echo of our song in your thought and know you require us. Try it now.\x{201d}
All about Sandwalker, the Shadow children began singing The Daysleep Song, which tells of the sun\x{2019}s rising; and of the first light; the long, long shadows and the dances the dust-devils do on the hilltops. \x{201c}Sing with us,\x{201d} the Old Wise One urged.
Sandwalker sang. At first he tried to add something of his own to the song, as men do at the sleeping place; but the Shadow children pinched him and frowned. After that lie only sang The Daysleep Song as he heard them singing, and soon all of them were dancing around the bones of the tick-deer, showing how the dust-devils would.
He now saw that the Shadow children were not all old men as he had imagined. Two indeed were wrinkled and stiff. One seemed a woman though like the rest she had only wisps of hair; two neither old nor young; and two, little more than boys. Sandwalker watched their faces as he danced, marveling that they seemed at once both young and old\x{2014}and the faces of the others that seemed old yet young. He could see much better than he had been able to while they were squatting about the tick-deer, and it came to him\x{2014}both understandings at once, so that surprise pushed surprise\x{2014}that in the east the black of the sky was giving way to purple, and that there were but seven Shadow children. The Old Wise One was gone. He turned to face the rising sun\x{2014}half from instinct, half because he thought the Old Wise One might have gone that way. When he turned again the Shadow children had scattered behind him, darting among the rocks. Only two were visible, then none. His first thought was to pursue them, but he felt certain they would not wish it. He called loudly, \x{201c}Go with God!\x{201d} and waved his arms.
The first beams of the new sun sent shapes of black and gold leaping toward him. He looked at the tick-deer; some shreds of flesh remained, and bones that would yield marrow if he could break them. Half-humorously he said to these leavings, \x{201c}Morning met where much food is,\x{201d} then ate again before the ants came.
An hour later, as he picked his teeth with a fingernail, he thought about his dream of the night before. The Old Wise One, he felt, might have interpreted it for him. He wished that he had asked. If he slept now, by daylight, there was little chance that any good dream would come, but he was tired and cold. He stretched himself in the warm sunshine\x{2014}and noticed that the back of the woman walking before him looked familiar. He was walking faster than she and soon could see that it was his mother, but when he tried to greet her he found he was unable to do so. Then he, who had always been so sure of foot, tripped on a stone. He threw out his hands to save himself, a shock went through his whole body, and he found himself sitting up, alone, and sweating from the sun\x{2019}s heat.
He stood, still trembling, brushing at the grit that clung to his damp limbs and his back. It was only foolishness. There was no use in sleeping by day\x{2014}his spirit only left the body at once and went wandering, and then if the priest did come to him in sleep there would be no one to receive him. The priest might even become angry with him and not come back. No, he must either return to the cave and try again there, or acknowledge failure and go away\x{2014}which would be intolerable. He would return, then, to the gorge.
But not with empty hands. The feign-pheasant he had brought before had proved an inadequate gift. This might be because the priest was in some way displeased with him; but, as he reflected with some satisfaction, it might also be because the priest intended some revelation of great moment, for which the feign-pheasant was insufficient. Another tick-deer, if he could find one, might be satisfactory. He had come from the north and had seen few signs of game; to go east would mean crossing the river gorge before he traveled far, and westward, toward the burning moun-tains, stretched a waterless wilderness of stone. He went south.
The land rose slowly as he went. There had been little vegetation, but it became less. The gray rock gave way to red. <<About noon|13>>, as his tireless stride brought him to the summit of a ridge, he saw something he had seen only twice before in his life: a tiny, watered valley, an oasis of the high desert which had managed to hold soil enough for real grass, a few wild flowers, and a tree.
Such a place was of great significance, but it was possible to drink there, and even to stay for a few hours if one dared. And it was less offensive to the tree, as Sandwalker knew, if one came alone\x{2014}an advantage for him. Approaching, as custom dictated, neither swiftly nor slowly, but with an expression of studied courtesy, he was about to greet it when he saw a girl sitting, holding an infant, among the roots.
For a moment, impolitely, his eyes left the tree. The girl\x{2019}s face was heart-shaped, timorous, scarcely a woman\x{2019}s yet. Her long hair (and this was something to which Sandwalker was unaccustomed) was clean\x{2014}she had washed it in the pool at the foot of the tree, and untied the tangles with her fingers so that it now spread a dark caul upon her brown shoulders. She sat cross-legged and unmoving, with the baby, a flower thrust in its hair, asleep on her thighs.
Sandwalker greeted the tree ceremoniously, asking permission to drink and promising not to stay long. A murmuring of leaves answered him, and though he could not understand the words they did not sound angry. He smiled to show his appreciation, then went to the pool and drank.
He drank long and deep, as desert animals do; and when he had had his fill and lifted his head from the wind-rippled water he saw the girl\x{2019}s reflection dancing beside his own. She was watching him with large, fearful eyes; but she was quite close. \x{201c}Morning met,\x{201d} he said.
\x{201c}Morning met.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am Sandwalker.\x{201d} He thought of his journey to the cave, of the tick-deer and the feign-pheasant and the Old Wise One. \x{201c}Sandwalker the far-traveled, the great hunter, the shadow-friend.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am Seven Girls Waiting,\x{201d} the girl said. \x{201c}And this,\x{201d} she smiled tenderly down at the baby she carried, \x{201c}is Mary Pink Butterflies. I called her that because of her little hands, you know. She waves them at me when she\x{2019}s awake.\x{201d}
Sandwalker, who in his own short life had seen how many children come and how few live, smiled and nodded.
The girl looked down into the pool at the foot of the tree, at the tree, at the flowers and grass, everywhere but at Sandwalker\x{2019}s face. He saw her small, white teeth creep out like snowmice to touch her lips, then flee again. The wind made patterns on the grass, and the tree said something he could not understand\x{2014}though Seven Girls Waiting, perhaps, did. \x{201c}Will you,\x{201d} she asked hesitantly, \x{201c}make this your sleeping place tonight?\x{201d}
He knew what she meant and answered as gently as he could, \x{201c}I have no food to share. I\x{2019}m sorry. I hunt, but what I find I must keep for a gift for the priest in Thunder Always. Doesn\x{2019}t anyone sleep where you sleep?\x{201d}
\x{201c}There was nothing anywhere. Pink Butterflies was new, and I could not walk far . . . We slept up there, beyond the bent rock.\x{201d} She made a wretched little gesture with her shoulders.
\x{201c}I have never known that,\x{201d} Sandwalker said, laying a hand on her arm, \x{201c}but I know how it must feel, sitting alone, waiting for them to come when no one comes. It must be a terrible thing.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You are a man. It will not come to you until you are old.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t mean to make you angry.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I\x{2019}m not angry. I\x{2019}m\x{2019}not alone either\x{2014}Pink Butterflies is with me all the time, and I have milk for her. Now we sleep here.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Every night?\x{201d}
The girl nodded, half-defiantly.
\x{201c}It isn\x{2019}t good to sleep where a tree is for more than one night.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Pink Butterflies is his daughter. I know because he told me in a dream a long time before she was born. He likes having her here.\x{201d}
Sandwalker said carefully, \x{201c}We were all engendered in women by trees. But they seldom want us to stay by them for more than a single night.\x{201d}
\x{201c}He\x{2019}s good to us! I thought . . .\x{201d} the girl\x{2019}s voice dropped until it was barely audible above the rustling of the wind in the grass, when you came he might have sent you to bring us something to :at.\x{201d}
Sandwalker looked at the little pool. \x{201c}Are there fish here?\x{201d}
The girl said humbly, as though confessing some misdemeanor, I haven\x{2019}t been able to find any for . . . for . . .\x{201d}
\x{201c}How long?\x{201d}
\x{201c}For the last three days. That\x{2019}s how we were living. I ate the fish from the pool, and I had milk for Pink Butterflies. I still have milk.\x{201d} She looked down at the baby, then up again at Sandwalker, her wide eyes begging him to believe her. \x{201c}She just drank. There was enough milk.\x{201d}
Sandwalker was looking at the sky. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s going to be cold,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}See how clear it is.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You will make this your sleeping place tonight?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Any food I find must go toward my gift.\x{201d} He told her about the priest, and his dream.
\x{201c}But you will come back?\x{201d}
Sandwalker nodded, and she described the best places to hunt\x{2014}the places where her people had found game, when they had found game.
The long, rocky slope above the tree and pool and little circle of living grass took the better part of an hour to climb. At the bent rock\x{2014}a crooked finger of stone left pointing skyward after some calamity of erosion\x{2014}he found the sleeping place her people had used: the rocks that had sheltered the sleepers from wind, a few scuffed tracks the weather had not yet erased, the gleaming bones of small animals. But the sleeping place was of no use or interest to him.
He hunted until sisterworld rose, and found nothing, and would have liked to sleep where he was; but he had promised the girl he would come back, and there was already an icy spirit in the air. He found her, as he had expected, lying with her arms around the baby among the tangled roots of the tree.
Exhausted, he flung himself down beside her. The sound of his breathing and the warmth of his body woke her; she started, then looked at him and smiled, and he was suddenly glad he had come back. \x{201c}Did you catch anything?\x{201d} she said.
He shook his head.
\x{201c}I did. Look. I thought you might like to have it for your gift.\x{201d} She held up a small fish, now stiff and cold.
Sandwalker took it, then shook his head. If the feign-pheasant had been inadequate, this would certainly not be acceptable. \x{201c}A fish would spoil before I got it there,\x{201d} he said. He started a hole in the belly with his teeth, then widened it with his fingers until he could scrape out the intestines and lift away most of the bones, leaving two little strips of flesh. He gave one to the girl.
\x{201c}Good,\x{201d} she said, swallowing. Then, \x{201c}Where are you going?\x{201d}
Sandwalker had risen, still chewing the fish, and stood stretching his tired, cold muscles in sisterworld\x{2019}s blue light. \x{201c}Hunting,\x{201d} he answered. \x{201c}Before, I was looking for something large, something I could take for a gift. Now I\x{2019}m going to look for something small, just something for us to eat tonight. Rock-mice, maybe.\x{201d}
Then he was gone, and the girl lay hugging her child, looking through the leaves at the bright band of The Waterfall and the broad seas and scattered storms of sisterworld. Then her eyes closed, and she could pull sisterworld from the tree. She put the blue rind to her lips and tasted sweetness. Then she woke again, the sweet juice still in her mouth. Someone was bending over her, and for a moment she was afraid.
\x{201c}Come on.\x{201d} It was he, Sandwalker. \x{201c}Wake up. I\x{2019}ve got something.\x{201d} He touched her lips again with his fingers; they were sticky, and fragrant with a piercing perfume of fruit, flowers, and earth.
She stood, holding Pink Butterflies pressed against her, her jutting breasts warming Pink Butterflies\x{2019}s stomach and legs (that was what they were for, besides milk), her arms wrapped about the little body, shivering.
Sandwalker pulled her. \x{201c}Come on.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Is it far?\x{201d}
\x{201c}No, not very far.\x{201d} (It was far, and he wanted to offer to carry Pink Butterflies, but he knew Seven Girls Waiting would fear he might harm her.)
The way lay north by, east, almost on the margin of the earliest beginning of the river. Seven Girls Waiting was stumbling by the time they reached it: a small dark hole where Sandwalker had kicked in the ground with his heel. \x{201c}Here,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I stopped to rest here, and with my ears close I could hear them talking.\x{201d} He ripped up the seemingly solid ground with strong fingers, tossing away the clods; then a clod, dark as the others in sisterwor\x{2019}d\x{2019}s blue light, came up dripping. There was a soft murmuring. He broke the clotted stuff in two, thrusting half into his own mouth, half into hers. She knew, suddenly, that she was starving and chewed and swallowed frantically, spitting out the wax.
\x{201c}Help me,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}They won\x{2019}t sting you. It\x{2019}s too cold. You can just brush them off.\x{201d}
He was digging again and she joined him, laying Pink Butterflies in a safe place and smearing her little mouth with honey to lick, and her hands so that she could lick her fingers. They ate not only the honey but the fat, white larva, digging and eating until their arms and faces, their entire bodies, were sticky and powdered with the bee-rotten soil; Sandwalker, thrusting his choice finds into the girl\x{2019}s mouth and she, her best discoveries into his, brushing aside the stupefied bees and digging and eating again until they fell back happy and surfeited in one another\x{2019}s arms. She pressed against him, feeling her stomach hard and round as a melon beneath her ribs and against his skin. Her lips were on his face, and it was dirty and sweet.
He moved her shoulders gently. \x{201c}No,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}not on top of me. I\x{2019}d split. I\x{2019}d be sick. Like this.\x{201d} His tree had grown large, and she wrapped it with her hands. Afterward they put Pink Butterflies between their perspiring bodies to keep her warm and slept the remainder of the night, the three of them, pressed in a tangle of legs and sighs.
The roaring of Thunder Always came to Sandwalker\x{2019}s ears. He rose and went into the priest\x{2019}s cave, but this time, though it was as dark as before, he could see everything. He had found the power, he did not know where, to see without eyes and without light; the cave stretched to either side of him and ahead of him\x{2014}a jumble of fallen slabs.
He went forward and upward. It was drier. The floor became gritty clay. Icicles of stone hung from the coldly sweating rocks overhead and lifted from the floor at his feet until he walked as if in the mouth of a beast. Drier still, and there were no more stone teeth, only the rough tongue of clay and the vaulted throat growing smaller and smaller. Then he saw the bed of the priest with the bones of gifts all around it, and the priest rose on his bed to look at him.
\x{201c}I am sorry,\x{201d} Sandwalker told him, \x{201c}you are hungry and I\x{2019}ve brought you nothing.\x{201d} Then he held out his hands and saw he held a dripping comb in one and a mass of fat larva cemented with honey in the other. The priest took them, smiling, and bending down chose from among the litter of bones an animal\x{2019}s skull, which he held out to Sandwalker.
Sandwalker took it; it was dry and old, but the priest\x{2019}s hand had stained it with fresh blood, and as he watched, the blood brought life to it: the bone becoming new and wet, then marble with dark veins, then wrapped in skin and fur. It was the head of an otter. The eyes, liquid and living, looked into Sandwalker\x{2019}s face.
In them he saw the river, where the otter had been born; the river trickling past the despoiled hive; saw the water dive through the high hills seeking the true surface of the world; saw it rush in torrents through Thunder Always and slow from plunging rapids to a swift stream and at last to a broad halfmile, winding almost without current through the meadowmeres. He saw the stiff flight of hair-herons and aigrettes, yellow frogs wrestling for the possession of the wind; and through the slow, green water, as though he were swimming in it himself twenty feet down among the stones and gravel and mountain-born sand of the bottom, the figure of the otter. With brown fur that was nearly black it threaded the waters like a snake until, close to him, it turned broad side on and he could see its short strong legs paddling\x{2014}clear of the sandy bottom by a finger-width, but seeming to walk along it.
\x{201c}What?\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}What?\x{201d} Pink Butterflies was squirming against him. Sleepily he helped her until she reached one of her mother\x{2019}s breasts, then cupped his hand about the other. He was cold and thought of his dream, but it seemed hardly to have ended.
He stood beside the broad river, his feet in mud. It was not yet quite sunrise, but the stars were dimming. Rushes rippled in the dawn wind, the waves running to the edge of the world. Calf-deep in the river, with slow eddies circling their legs, stood Flying Feet, old Bloodyfinger, Leaves-you-can-eat, the girl Sweetmouth, and Cedar Branches Waving.
From behind him stepped two men. The people of the meadowmeres, he knew, drove their young men from women until fire from the mountains proved their manhood and left their thigh and shoulders puckered with scars. These men had such scars, and their hair had been knotted in locks, and they wore grass about their wrists and waxy blossoms at their necks. A man with a scarred head chanted, then ended. He saw Flying Feet see that the man\x{2019}s eyes were on him and step backward\x{2014}and so doing, into a place where the river was suddenly deeper. Flying Feet sank, floundering. The scarred man seized him. The water churned with his stragglings, but the scarred men, themselves now waist-deep, bent over him, thrusting him down. The stragglings grew less, and Sandwalker, knowing he dreamed\x{2014}Sandwalker asleep beside Seven Girls Waiting\x{2014}thought as he dreamed that were he Flying Feet he would feign death until they brought him to the air again. Meantime Flying Feet\x{2019}s churning of the river had ceased. The silt his kicking had raised floated away, leaving the water clear. In it his arms and legs lay lifeless, and his long hair trailed behind him like weed. The dream Sandwalker strode to him, feet lifting high, scarcely splashing when they came down. He looked at the blank white face under the water, and as he looked, the eyes opened, and the mouth opened, and there was an agony in them which faded and became slack, the eyes no longer seeing.
Sandwalker could not breathe. He sat up trembling, gulping air, a pressure on his chest. He stood, feeling he must thrust his head higher than water he could not see. Seven Girls Waiting stirred, and Pink Butterflies waked and whimpered.
He left them and walked to the top of a small knoll. As in his dream the sun was corning, and the east was rose and purple with the reflection of his face.
When Seven Girls Waiting had drunk from the river and was feeding Pink Butterflies he explained his dream to her: \x{201c}Flying Feet thought as I. He would pretend death. But the marshmen had seen that trick, and . . .\x{201d} Sandwalker shrugged.
\x{201c}You said he couldn\x{2019}t get up,\x{201d} she said practically, \x{201c}so he would have died anyway.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Will you hunt today? You still need a gift, and since we didn\x{2019}t stay at the tree last night you could sleep there tonight.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t think the priest requires another gift of me,\x{201d} Sandwalker said slowly. \x{201c}I thought he was not helping me, but now I see that the dream I dreamed in his cave of floating and watching the stars was by his help, and the dream I dreamed by daylight of walking with my mother and the others was by his help, and the dream I dreamed last night. Truly, the men of the marsh have taken my people.\x{201d}
Seven Girls Waiting sat down, holding Pink Butterflies on her lap and not looking at his face. \x{201c}It is a long way to the marshes,\x{201d} she said.
\x{201c}Yes, but my dream has shown me how I may travel swiftly.\x{201d} Sandwalker walked to the edge of the little stream which would become the great river and looked down into it. The water was very clear, and hip-deep. The bottom was sand and stones. He plunged in.
The current, fast even here, took him. For a moment he raised his head from the water. Seven Girls Waiting was already far away, a small figure shining in the new sun; she waved and held up Pink Butterflies so that she could see, and he knew that she was calling, \x{201c}Go with God.\x{201d}
The water took him again and he spun on to his belly and thought of the otter, imagining that he too had nostrils close to the top of his head and short, powerful swimming legs in place of his long limbs. He stroked and shot ahead, stroked and shot ahead, occasionally pausing to listen for the roar of a falls.",

            "He passed many, leaving the river and circling them on foot. The lesser rapids he swam, growing more skillful at each. Through half the gorge of Thunder Always he carried a large fish to leave as an offering in the priest\x{2019}s cave. In deep pools the currents sent him swirling toward the bottom until, with their force spent, he hung suspended in the green light, his hair a cloud about his face - then streaming straight out behind it as he followed the waters to the surface again among crystal spheres of air.
Late that day, though he could only guess it, he passed through the country most familiar to him, the rocky hills where his own people roved, having come farther north since morning than he had traveled southward on the way to Thunder Always in five days. Evening came, and, from a stretch of the river quieter than most, he crawled onto a sandy bank, finding himself almost too tired to drag his body from the water. He slept on the sand in the shelter of high grass, and did not look at the stars at all.
The next morning he walked for half an hour along the little beach before slipping, hungry, into the water again. Everything was easier now. Fish were more plentiful and he caught a fine one, then a dabduck by swimming under water, eyes open and limbs scarcely moving, until he could grasp the unlucky bird\x{2019}s feet.
The river, too, was quieter; and if he did not rush along as swiftly, his progress,,.was less exhausting. It flowed smoothly among wooded hills; then, much broader, slipped through lowlands where great trees sank roots in the water and arched branches fifty feet toward mid-channel from either side. At last it seemed to stagnate in a flatland where reeds, dotted with trees and brush, spread without limit; and the cold, unliving water acquired, by means Sandwalker did not comprehend, faintly, the taste of sweat.
Now night came again, but there was no friendly bank. Cautiously he picked his way half a mile over the reeking mud to reach a tree. Waterfowl circled overhead, calling to each other and sometimes crying\x{2014}as though the death of the sun meant terror and death for them as well, a night of fear.
He spoke to the tree when he reached it, but it did not reply and he felt that whatever power dwelt in the lonely oasis trees of his own land was absent here; that this tree spoke to the unseen no more than to him, engineering no babes in women. After begging permission (he might, after all, be wrong) he climbed into a high fork to sleep. A few insects found him, but they were torpid in the cold. The sky was streaked with clouds through which sisterworld\x{2019}s bloodless lightshoneonlyfitfully. Heslept, then woke; and first smelled, then heard, then in the wanton beams saw, a ghoul-bear lope by\x{2014}huge, thick-limbed, and stinking.
Almost he slept again. Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow.
Not sorrow, he thought, though when he remembered Seven Girls Waiting and Pink Butterflies and the living, thinking tree ruling kindly its little lake and flowered lawn in the country of sliding stones, something hurt.
Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow, sang the night wind, throbbing.
Not sorrow, Sandwalker thought to himself, hate. The marshmen had killed Flying Feet, who had sometimes out of his plenty given him to eat when he was small. They would kill Bloody-finger and Leaves-you-can-eat, Sweetmouth and his mother.
Sorrow, sing sorrow.
Not sorrow, he thought, the wind, the tree. He sat up, listening to convince himself that it was only the sighing of the wind he heard, or perhaps the tree murmuring of better places. Whatever it was\x{2014}perhaps, indeed, he had been wrong about this lonely, reed-hemmed tree\x{2014}it was not an angry sound. It was . . . nothing.
The lost wind sighed, but not in words. The leaves around him scarcely trembled. Far overhead and far away thunder boomed. Sorrow, sang many voices. Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow. Loneliness, and the night coming that will never go.
Not the wind; not the tree. Shadow children. Somewhere. Forming the words softly, Sandwalker said, \x{201c}Morning met. I am not lonely or sad, but I will sing with you.\x{201d} Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow. He remembered that the Old Wise One had said, \x{201c}As you are named shadowfriend, you must learn before this night is over to call for our help when you require it.\x{201d} He had hoped, with a boy\x{2019}s optimism, to free his people by his own strength, but if the Shadow children would help him he was very willing that they should. \x{201c}Loneliness,\x{201d} he sang with them, and then, closing his lips and unfolding his mind to the clouds and the empty miles of water and reeds, and the night coming that will never go.
Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow, sang again the Shadow children (somewhere), but the mind-song seemed now something less an expression of feeling and something more a ritual, a song traditional to their circumstances. They had heard him. Come to us, shadowfriend. Aid us in our sorrow.
He tried to ask questions, and discovered he could not. As soon as his thought was no longer the thought of the song, as long as it no longer swayed and pleaded with the others, the touching was broken and he was alone.
Aid us, aid us, sang the Shadow children. Help us.
Sandwalker climbed down from the tree, shuddering at the thought of the ghoul-bear. Far off in the night a bird chuckled fiendishly. Not only was it difficult to tell from whence the song came, but activity submerged the impression of it in his own mind\x{2019}s motions. He stopped, first standing, then leaning against the bole of the tree, finally closing his eyes and throwing back his head. Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow. A direction\x{2014}perhaps\x{2014}north by west; diagonally away from the main channel of the river. He looked at the sky, hoping to take a bearing from the Eye of Cold\x{2014}but the clouds, rank upon serried rank, allowed no star more than an instant.
He walked and splashed, then halted, embarrassed by his own noise. Around him the marsh seemed to listen. He tried again, and in a few hundred steps developed a method of walking which was reasonably silent. Knees high, he moved his feet quickly across the water and put them down with the whole foot arched like a diver. Like a wading bird, he thought. He remembered the times he had seen the long-limbed, plumed frog-spearers stalking the margins of the river. I am Sandwalker truly.
But there was mud underfoot now. Several times he was afraid he would be mired, and small animals he recognized as somehow akin to the rockrats scuttled away at his approach or dove into ponds. Something he could never see whistled at him from thickets of reeds and the black mouths of burrows.
Sorrow, sorrow, sorrow, sang the Shadow children, closer now. The ground, though still soft, was no longer covered with standing water. Sandwalker moved from shadow to shadow, immobile when the clouds leaked sisterworld\x{2019}s light. A voice\x{2014}a Shadow child\x{2019}s thin voice, but a real voice that came to the ears\x{2014}said (at some distance, but distinctly), \x{201c}They are waiting to take him.\x{201d}
\x{201c}They will not take him,\x{201d} answered a second, much less clearly. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s our friend. He . . . we . . . will kill them all.\x{201d}
Sandwalker crouched among rushes. For five minutes, ten minutes, he did not move. Overhead the clouds flew east and were replaced by more. The wind swayed the reeds and whispered. After a long time a voice, not a Shadow child\x{2019}s said: \x{201c}They\x{2019}ve gone. If there ever were any. They heard them.\x{201d}
A second voice grunted. Ahead of him a hundred paces or more something moved; he heard rather than saw it. After another five minutes he began to circle to his left.
An hour later he knew that there were four men waiting in a rough square, and suspected that the Shadow children were in the center. To be hunted was no new experience\x{2014}twice as a child he had been hunted by starving men\x{2014}and it would be simple now to melt away and find a new sleeping place or return to his old one. He crept forward instead, at once frightened and excited.
\x{201c}Light soon,\x{201d} one of the men said, and another answered him, \x{201c}More might still come; be quiet.\x{201d} Sandwalker had almost reached the center of the square.
Slowly he crept forward. His hand touched air. The earth was no longer level in front of him. He groped. It fell away. Not straight down, but down at a steep slope, very soft. He peered into the darkness, and a reedy Shadow voice whispered: \x{201c}We see you. A little further, if you can, and hold out your hands.\x{201d}
They were taken by diminutive, skeletal fingers, tugged, and there was a small, dark shape beside him; tugged again and there was another. <<Three|9k:0>>, but already the first had faded into the rushes. <<Four|9k:0>>, but only the newcomer beside him. <<Five|9k:0>>, and he and the fifth were alone. Holding his body close to the ground, he turned and began to creep away the way he had come. There were stealthy noises around him, and one of the hunters said, almost (it seemed) in his ear, \x{201c}Go look.\x{201d} Then there was a crash as a hundred reeds snapped, and a confusion of thrashing sound. To his right a man stood up and began to run. The Shadow child beside him threw himself at the marshman\x{2019}s ankles as he passed and he came crashing down.
Sandwalker was upon him almost before he hit, his thumbs merciless as stones as they drove into the neck. Lightning flashed, and he saw the contorted face, and two small hands that reached down to pluck out the marshman\x{2019}s eyes.
Then he was up; it was blind dark, and the marshmen were yelling and a thin voice screaming. A man loomed in front of him and Sandwalker kicked him expertly, then drove the head down with his hands to meet his knees; he took a step backward and a Shadow child was on the man\x{2019}s shoulders, his fleshless legs locked around the throat and his fingers plunged into the hair. \x{201c}Come,\x{201d} Sandwalker said urgently, \x{201c}we have to get away.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Why?\x{201d} The Shadow child sounded calm and happy. \x{201c}We\x{2019}re winning.\x{201d} The man he rode, who had been doubled over in agony, straightened up and tried to free himself; the Shadow child\x{2019}s legs tightened, and as Sandwalker watched, the marshman fell to his knees. It was suddenly quiet\x{2014}much quieter, in fact, than it had been before they had been discovered, because the insects and night birds were mute. The wind no longer stirred the reeds. A Shadow child\x{2019}s voice said: \x{201c}That\x{2019}s over. They\x{2019}re a fine lot, aren\x{2019}t they?\x{201d}
Sandwalker, who was not equally sure that there would be no more fighting, answered, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m certain your people are brave, but it was I who overcame two of these wetlanders.\x{201d}
The marshman who had dropped to his knees a moment before rose shakily, and guided by the Shadow child on his shoulders staggered away. \x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t mean us,\x{201d} the voice talking to Sandwalker said. \x{201c}I meant them. We have enough here for a number of feasts. Now everyone\x{2019}s meeting by the hole where they kept us. Go over there and you can see.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Aren\x{2019}t you coming?\x{201d} Sandwalker had been looking for the speaker, and could not locate him.
There was no answer. He turned, and guided by a well-developed sense of direction went back to the pit. The four men were there, three of them with riders on their shoulders, the fourth moaning and swaying, scrubbing with bloodied hands at the bleeding sockets of his eyes. Two more Shadow children crouched in the trampled marsh grass.
A voice from behind Sandwalker said, \x{201c}We should eat the blind one tonight. The rest we can drive into the hills to share with friends.\x{201d} The blind man moaned.
\x{201c}I wish I could see you,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}Are you the same Old Wise One I talked to three nights ago?\x{201d}
\x{201c}No.\x{201d} A sixth Shadow child stepped from somewhere. In the faint light (even Sandwalker\x{2019}s eyes had difficulty seeing more than half-shapes and outlines; the ridden men were bulks more felt than seen) he seemed completely solid, but older than any of the others.
The starlight, when the clouds permitted starlight, glittered on his head as on frost. \x{201c}We knew you as a shadow friend only by your singing. You are very young. Was it only three nights ago that you became one of us?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am your friend,\x{201d} Sandwalker said carefully, \x{201c}but I do not think I am one of you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}In the mind. Only the mind is significant.\x{201d}
\x{201c}The stars.\x{201d} It was the blind man, and his voice might have been the voice of a wound, speaking through livid lips with a tongue of running blood. \x{201c}If Lastvoice our starwalker were here he would explain to you. Leaving the body behind to rove the stars and straddle the back of the Fighting Lizard. Seeing what God sees to know what he knows and what he must do.\x{201d}
\x{201c}There are those in my country who speak thus,\x{201d} said Sandwalker, \x{201c}and we drive them to the edges of the cliffs\x{2014}and beyond.\x{201d}
\x{201c}The stars tell God,\x{201d} the blind prisoner mumbled stubbornly, \x{201c}and the river tells the stars. Those who look into the nightwaters may see, in the ripples, the shifting stars coming. We give them the lives of you ignorant hillsmen, and if a star leaves its place we darken the water with the starwalker\x{2019}s blood.\x{201d}
The Old Wise One seemed to have gone away\x{2014}Sandwalker could no longer see him among the silently waiting Shadow children\x{2014}but his voice said, \x{201c}Enough talk. We hunger.\x{201d}
\x{201c}A few moments more. I want to ask about my mother and my friends. They are prisoners of these people.\x{201d}
The blind man said, \x{201c}Make the not-men go, first.\x{201d}
Sandwalker said, \x{201c}Go away,\x{201d} and the two Shadow children who were not riding men moved their feet to make a trampling in the grass, but remained where they were. \x{201c}They are gone,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}Now what of the prisoners?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Was it you who blinded me?\x{201d}
\x{201c}No, a Shadow child; mine were the hands at your throat.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Their singing brought you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Thus we keep them where no other men are, near the hills. And often their singing brings more of the kind\x{2014}until sometimes we have as many as twenty, for they do not care if their friends may be eaten if they themselves may escape. But sometimes instead, as now, we lose what we have\x{2014}though I never thought this should come to me. But I have never known of the singing to bring a boy.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am a man. I have known woman, and dreamed great dreams. You drowned Flying Foot, defiling God\x{2019}s purity with death. What of the others?\x{201d}
\x{201c}You will try to save them, Fingers at My Throat?\x{201d}
\x{201c}My name is Sandwalker. Yes, if I can.\x{201d}
\x{201c}They are far north of here,\x{201d} said the terrible voice of the blind man. \x{201c}Near the great observatory of The Eye. In the pit called The Other Eye. But my own eye is gone, and my other eye also; tell me, how stand the stars now? I must know when it is time to die.\x{201d}
Sandwalker glanced up, though the racing clouds covered everything; and as he did, the blind man lunged. In an instant the Shadow children were on him like ants on carrion, and Sandwalker kicked him in the face. The other prisoners bolted.
\x{201c}Will you eat this meat with us?\x{201d} the Old Wise One asked when the blind man had been subdued. \x{201c}As a shadowfriend you are one of us, and may eat this meat without disgrace.\x{201d} He had reappeared, though he took no part in the struggle with the blind man\x{2014}at least, one of the dim figures seemed to be he.
\x{201c}No,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}I ate well yesterday. But will you not pursue those who fled?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Later. Burdened with this one, we would never retrieve them, and he would flee too\x{2014}blind or not\x{2014}if we were to leave him alone. It would be possible to break his legs, but there is a ghoul-bear near; we winded him before you came.\x{201d}
Sandwalker nodded. \x{201c}I too.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Would you see this one\x{2019}s death?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I might start the trail of the others,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. To himself he reflected that they would run north, downstream. Toward the pit call The Other Eye.
\x{201c}That is a good thought.\x{201d}
Sandwalker turned away. He had not taken ten steps before the rain came; through its drumming he heard the blind man\x{2019}s death rattle.",

            "They took Sandwalker at twilight, a great ring of them. They had come behind him and closed from all sides, big, scarred men with ugly eyes. He ran from one part of their circle to another, from end to end, finding no escape, the marshmen always closer until they were shoulder to shoulder, he hoping for dark but caught (at last) in the dark. He fought hard and they hurt him.
For five days they held him, then all night drove him before them, and at first light, cast him into that pit which is called The Other Eye. There were four there already. They were his mother, Cedar Branches Waving; Leaves-you-can-eat; old Bloodyfinger; and the girl Sweetmouth.
\x{201c}My son!\x{201d} said Cedar Branches Waving, and she wept. She was very thin.
For half a day Sandwalker tried to climb the walls of The Other Eye. He made Leaves-you-can-eat and the girl Sweetmouth push him, and he persuaded old Bloodyfinger to lean against the slopingxsand while Leaves-you-can-eat climbed upon his shoulders so that he, Sandwalker, might climb upon both and so escape; but the walls of the pit called The Other Eye are of so soft a sand that they fade under the feet and hands, and the more they are pulled down, the less they can be climbed. Bloodyfinger floundered and Sandwalker fell, and they were the same as before.
At about an hour after the <<noon|13>>, another Sandwalker appeared at the rim of the pit, and stood a long time looking down. Sandwalker, in the pit, stared up at himself. Then men, the big men of the meadowmeres with their scars, brought a long liana, and holding one end of this woody vine flung the other down. \x{201c}That one,\x{201d} said the Sandwalker who stood in the high place, and he pointed to the real Sandwalker.
Sandwalker shook his head. No.
\x{201c}You are not to be sacrificed\x{2014}not yet. Climb up.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Am I to be freed?\x{201d}
The other laughed.
Then if you would speak to me, Brother, you must come down.\x{201d}
Eastwind looked at the men holding the liana, shrugged in a way that was half a joke, and with his hands on the vine slid down. \x{201c}I wish to see you better,\x{201d} he said to Sandwalker. \x{201c}You have my face.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You are my brother,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}I have dreamed of you, and my mother told me of you. Two of us were born, and at the washing she held me and her own mother you. The marshmen came and forced your name from her mother\x{2019}s mouth that they might have power over you, then killed her.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I know all that,\x{201d} Eastwind said. \x{201c}Lastvoice, my teacher, has told me.\x{201d}
Sandwalker hoped for some advantage by drawing their mother into the talk, so he said, \x{201c}What was her name, mother? Your mother, whom they drowned? I have forgotten.\x{201d} But Cedar Branches Waving was weeping and would not answer.
\x{201c}You are to be killed,\x{201d} said Eastwind, \x{201c}that you may carry our messages to the river, who tells the stars, who tell God. Lastvoice has warned me that there may be some danger to me in your death. We are, perhaps, but one person.\x{201d}
Sandwalker shook his head and spat.
\x{201c}It is an honor for you. You are a hill-boy like ten others\x{2014}but in the stars you will be greater than I, who learn to read the instructions the river writes God.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You are really not so much like me,\x{201d} Sandwalker said, \x{201c}and you have no beard.\x{201d} He touched his lip where the bristles were beginning to sprout. Unexpectedly the girl Sweetmouth, who had been (with Leaves-you-can-eat and old Bloodyfinger) watching them silently, began to giggle. Sandwalker looked at her angrily and she pointed at Eastwind, unable to contain her laughter.
\x{201c}When I was an infant,\x{201d} Eastwind said. \x{201c}We bind those things tightly with a woman\x{2019}s hair, and they putrefy. It is not painful, and only a few of those who will be starwalkers die. I had wished to say that Lastvoice has warned me that we are one. You will die before I, and go to the river and the stars. I am not afraid of that. In my dreams I shall float with you in places of power; I came to tell you that in your dreams you may yet walk as a living man.\x{201d}
A voice from the rim of the pit hailed Eastwind. \x{201c}Scholar of the Sky, there are more. Do you wish to come up?\x{201d}
Sandwalker looked up and saw the small forms of Shadow children, hemmed on three sides by the marshmen.
\x{201c}No,\x{201d} said Eastwind. \x{201c}If I am not afraid of these\x{2014}these are at least men\x{2014}should I fear those?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Perhaps,\x{201d} Sandwalker said.
The Shadow children came tumbling down the soft slope. In the bright sunlight they looked far smaller than they had by night, bloodless and crook-legged. Sandwalker thought real children looking so would soon die.
\x{201c}We will soon die,\x{201d} one of the Shadow children (Sandwalker was not certain which) said. \x{201c}And be eaten by these. You too.\x{201d}
Eastwind said: \x{201c}The ritual eating of gifts given the river is very different from feasting, little mock-men. We shall feast on you.\x{201d}
The marshman who had called to Eastwind, apparently a man of some importance among them, announced from his place at the rim, \x{201c}<<Five|9k:0>>, Scholar of the Sky.\x{201d} He rubbed his hands. \x{201c}And there\x{2019}s no sweeter meat than Shadow child\x{2019}s.\x{201d}
\x{201c}<<Six|9k:0>>,\x{201d} Eastwind corrected him.
\x{201c}This pit was not dug by hands,\x{201d} said one of the Shadow children. Several of them were by now poking about, sifting the fine sand through their fingers.
\x{201c}These are your followers,\x{201d} Eastwind said to Sandwalker. \x{201c}Would you care to explain their new home to them?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I would if I could, but no one knows why the world is as it is, save that it conforms to the will of God.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Learn, then, where you stand. Here\x{2014}a few hundred paces east\x{2014}the river widens forever. It is as a stem widens to the flower, save that the flower of the river, which is called Ocean, widens without limit.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t believe it,\x{201d} Sandwalker said.
\x{201c}Don\x{2019}t you understand yet? Don\x{2019}t you know why the river exceeds in holiness both God and the stars? Why children at the beginning of their lives must be washed by it, and its waters muddied with the blood of the very starwalkers should a star fall? The river is Time, and it ends at this sacred place in Ocean, which is the past and extends forever. On the east bank, where the ground is low and the water sometimes sweet and sometimes salt, is the Eye, the great circle from which the starwalkers go forth. On this west bank it has pleased Ocean to build this Other Eye to contain the gifts that will in time be his. Lastvoice, who has thought much on all things, says that the hands of Ocean, which strike the beaches forever, draw forth the sand on which we stand even as more slips down to replace it\x{2014}having been returned by him to the beaches. Thus it is that The Other Eye is never empty and can never be filled.\x{201d}
\x{201c}We wash our children in the river,\x{201d} Sandwalker said, \x{201c}because it signifies the purity of God. The root-earth of the trees, their fathers is still upon them and should be washed away. As for the rest of your nonsense, I think it no better than that about our being the same person.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Lastvoice has opened the bodies of women . . .\x{201d} Eastwind began, then seeing the disgust on Sandwaiker\x{2019}s face he turned on his heel, grasped the liana, and signaled the men waiting to pull him up. At the rim he waved briefly and called, \x{201c}Good-by, Mother. Good-by, Brother,\x{201d} then was gone.
Old Bloodyfinger said in his snarling voice, \x{201c}You might have got something from him\x{2014}but he won\x{2019}t be back.\x{201d}
Sandwalker shrugged and said: \x{201c}Do they let us go up to drink? I\x{2019}m thirsty and there are no pools in this place.\x{201d}
There was no shade either, but the Shadow children were lying down on the side of the pit which would be shaded first, curling into small, dark balls. Bloodyfinger said, \x{201c}About sundown they\x{2019}ll throw down stalks that don\x{2019}t have much flavor but a lot of iuice. That\x{2019}s all the drink you\x{2019}ll get. All the food too.\x{201d} He jerked a thumb at the Shadow children. \x{201c}But butchering those vermin would give us food and juicy drink. Three of us, five of them, that\x{2019}s not bad, and they won\x{2019}t fight well while the sun is high.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Two of you, six of us. And Leaves-you-can-eat won\x{2019}t fight if I fight him.\x{201d}
For a moment Bloodyfingers looked angry, and Sandwalker remembering those big fists, readied himself to dodge and kick. Then Bloodyfinger grinned his gap-toothed grin\x{2014}\x{201c}Just you and I, huh, boy? Bruising each other while the rest watch and yell. If you win, your friends eat, and if I do\x{2014}why they come for me after dark. No. In a few days you\x{2019}ll be hungry\x{2014}if any of us are alive. I\x{2019}ll talk to you again then.\x{201d}
Sandwalker shook his head, but smiled. He had been driven all night by his captors and had spent the morning struggling with the slipping walls, so when Bloodyfinger turned away he scooped a place in the sand near the Shadow children and lay down. After a time the girl Sweetmouth came and lay beside him.",

            "At sunset, as Bloodyfinger had said, the stems of plants were thrown down to them. The Shadow children were beginning to stir, and brought two for Sweetmouth and Sandwalker, Sweetmouth took hers, but she was frightened by the Shadow children\x{2019}s gleaming eyes. She went to the other side of the pit to sit with Cedar Branches Waving.
The Old Wise One came to sit beside Sandwalker, who noticed that he had no water stalk. Sandwalker said, \x{201c}Well, what do we do now?\x{201d}
Talk,\x{201d} said the Old Wise One.
\x{201c}Why?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Because there is no opportunity to act. It is always wise to talk a great deal, discussjng what has been done and what may be done, when nothing can be done. All the great political movements of history were born in prisons.\x{201d}
\x{201c}What are political movements, and history?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Your forehead is high and your eyes are far apart,\x{201d} the Old Wise One said. \x{201c}Unfortunately like all your species you have your brain in your thorax\x{2014}\x{201d} (he tapped Sandwalker\x{2019}s hard, flat belly, or at least made the gesture of doing so, though his finger had no substance) \x{2019}so neither of those indications of mental capacity is valid.\x{201d}
Sandwalker said tactfully, \x{201c}All of us have our brains in our stomachs when we are hungry.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You mean minds,\x{201d} the Old Wise One told him, \x{201c}It is possible for the mind to float fourteen thousand feet or more above the head.\x{201d}
\x{201c}The starwalkers of these wetlanders say their minds\x{2014}perhaps they mean their souls\x{2014}leave the ground, tumble through space, kick off from sisterworld, and, drawn by the tractive universe, glide, soar, sweep, and whirl among the constellations until dawn, reading everything and tending the whole. So they told me in my captivity.\x{201d}
The Old Wise One made a spitting sound and asked Sandwalker, \x{201c}Do you know what a starcrosser is?\x{201d}
Sandwalker shook his head.
\x{201c}Have you ever seen a log floating in the river? I mean high in the hills, where the water rushes between stones and the log with it.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I rode the river myself that way. That\x{2019}s how I came to the meadowmeres so quickly.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Better yet.\x{201d} The Old Wise One lifted his head to stare at the night sky. \x{201c}There,\x{201d} he said, pointing. \x{201c}There. What do you call that?\x{201d}
Sandwalker was trying to follow the direction of his shadowy finger. \x{201c}Where?\x{201d} he said. Burning Hair Woman watched with calm, unseeing eyes through the Old Wise One\x{2019}s hand.
\x{201c}There, spread across all the heavens from end to end.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Oh, that,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s the Waterfall.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Exactly. Now think of a hollow log big enough for men to get into. That would be a starcrosser.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I see.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Now humans\x{2014}my race\x{2014}actually traveled in those, cruising among the stars before the long dreaming days. We came here that way.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I thought you were always here,\x{201d} Sandwalker said.
The Old Wise One shook his head. \x{201c}We either came recently or a long, long time ago. I\x{2019}m not sure which.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Don\x{2019}t your songs tell?\x{201d}
\x{201c}We had no songs when we came here\x{2014}that was one of the reasons we stayed, and why we lost the starcrosser.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You couldn\x{2019}t have gone back in it anyway,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. He was thinking of going upstream on a river.
\x{201c}We know. We\x{2019}ve changed too much. Do you think we look like you, Sandwalker?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Not very much. You\x{2019}re too small and you don\x{2019}t look healthy, and your ears are too round and you don\x{2019}t have enough hair.\x{201d}
\x{201c}True,\x{201d} said the Old Wise One, and fell silent. In the quiet that followed, Sandwalker could hear softly a sound he had never heard before, a sound rising and falling: it was Ocean smoothing the beach a quarter-mile away with his wet hands, but Sandwalker did not know this.
\x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t mean to be insulting,\x{201d} Sandwalker said at last. \x{201c}I was just pointing these things out.\x{201d}
\x{201c}It is thought,\x{201d} the Old Wise One said, \x{201c}that makes things so. We do not conceive of ourselves as you have described us, and so we are not actually that way. However, it\x{2019}s sobering to hear how another thinks of us.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry.\x{201d}
\x{201c}In any event, we once looked just as you do now.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Ah,\x{201d} said Sandwalker. When he was younger, Cedar Branches Waving had often told him stories with names like \x{201c}How the Mule-Cat Got His Tail\x{201d} (stole it from the lack-lizard, who had it for a tongue) and \x{201c}Why the Neagle Never Flies\x{2019} (doesn\x{2019}t want the other animals to see his ugly feet, so he hides them in the grass unless he\x{2019}s using them to kill something). He thought the Old Wise One\x{2019}s story was going to be something like these, and since he hadn\x{2019}t heard it before he was quite willing to listen.
\x{201c}We came either recently or a long, long time ago, as I said. Sometimes we try to recall the name of our home as we sit staring at each other\x{2019}s faces in the dawn, before we raise the Day-sleep Song. But we hear also the mind-singing of our brothers\x{2014}who do not sing\x{2014}as they pass up and down between the stars; we bend their thinking then, making them go back, but these thoughts come into our songs. It is possible that our home was named Atlantis or Mu\x{2014}Gondwanaland, Africa, Poictesme, or The Country Of Friends. I, for five, remember all these names.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} said Sandwalker. He had enjoyed the names, but the Old Wise One\x{2019}s referring to himself as five had reminded him of the other Shadow children. They all seemed to be awake and listening, but sitting far off in various places around the pit. <<Two|9k:0>>, so it appeared, had attempted to climb the shifting walls, and now waited where they had abandoned the effort\x{2014}one a quarter way, one almost halfway up. All the humans except himself slept. The blue radiance of sisterworld was sifting over the rim,
\x{201c}When we came we looked as you do now\x{2014}\x{201d} began the Old Wise One.
\x{201c}But you took off your appearance to bathe,\x{201d} Sandwalker continued for him, thinking of the feathers and flowers his own people sometimes thrust into their hair, \x{201c}and we stole it from you and have worn it ever since.\x{201d} Cedar Branches Waving had once told him some similar story.
\x{201c}No. It was not necessary for us to lose our appearance for you to gain it. You come of a race of shape-changers\x{2014}like those we called werewolves in our old home. When we came some of you looked like every beast, and some were of fantastic forms inspired by the clouds\x{2014}or by lava flows, or water. But we walked among you in power and majesty and might, hissing like a thousand serpents as we splashed down in your sea, stepping like conquerors when we strode ashore with burning lights in our fists, and flame.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Ah!\x{201d} said Sandwalker, who was enjoying the story.
\x{201c}Of flame and light,\x{201d} repeated the Old Wise One, rocking back and forth. His eyes were half-shut, and his jaws moved vigorously as though he were eating.
\x{201c}Then what happened?\x{201d} asked Sandwalker.
\x{201c}That is the end. We so impressed your kind that you became like us, and have so remained ever since. That is, as we were.\x{201d}
\x{201c}That can\x{2019}t be the end,\x{201d} said Sandwalker. \x{201c}You told how we becam>e the same, but you haven\x{2019}t told yet how we became different. I am taller already than any of you, and my legs are straight.\x{201d}
\x{201c}We are taller than you, and stronger,\x{201d} said the Old Wise One. \x{201c}And wrapped in terrible glory. It is true that we no longer have the things of flame and light, but our glance withers, and we sing death to our enemies. Yes, and the bushes drop fruit into our hands, and the earth yields the sons of flying mothers do we but turn a stone.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Ah,\x{201d} said Sandwalker again. He wanted to say, Your bones are bent and weak and your faces ill; you run from men and the light, but he did not. He had called himself a shadowfriend\x{2014}besides, there was no point in quarreling now. So he said, \x{201c}But we\x{2019}re still not the same, since my own people do not have those powers; neither do our songs come on the night wind to disturb sleep.\x{201d}
The Old Wise One nodded and said, \x{201c}I will show you.\x{201d} Then looking down he coughed into his hands and held them out to Sandwalker.
Sandwalker tried to see what it was he held, but sisterworld was shining brightly now and the Old Wise One\x{2019}s hands were cobweb. There was something\x{2014}a dark mass\x{2014}but though he bent close Sandwalker could see nothing more, and when he tried to touch what the Old Wise One held, his fingers passed through the hands as well as what they contained, making him feel suddenly foolish and alone, a boy who sat muttering to empty air when he might have slept.
\x{201c}Here,\x{201d} the Old Wise One said, and motioned. A second Shadow child came and squatted beside him, solid and real. \x{201c}Is it you I\x{2019}m talking to, really?\x{201d} Sandwalker asked, but the other did not answer or meet his eyes. After a moment he coughed into his hands as the Old Wise One had done and held them out.
\x{201c}You talk to all of us when you talk to me,\x{201d} the Old Wise One said. \x{201c}Mostly to us five here; but also to all Shadow children. Though weak, their songs come from far away to help shape what I am. But look at what this one is showing you.\x{201d}
For a moment Sandwalker looked instead at the Shadow child. He might have been young, but the dark face was silent and closed. The eyes were nearly shut, yet through the lids Sandwalker sensed his stare, friendly, embarrassed, and afraid.
\x{201c}Take some,\x{201d} invited the Old Wise One. Sandwalker prodded the chewed stuff with a finger and sniffed\x{2014}vile.
\x{201c}For this we have given up everything, because this is more than anything, though it is only a herb of this world. The leaves are wide, warty, and gray; the flowers yellow, the seed pink prickled eggs.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I have seen it,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}Leaves-you-can-eat warned me of it when I was young. It is poisoned.\x{201d}
\x{201c}So your kind believes, and so it is if swallowed\x{2014}though to die in that way might be better than lifd But once, between the full face of sisterworld and her next, a man may take the fresh leaves, and folding them tightly carry them in his cheek. Then there is no woman for him, nor any meat; he is sacred then, for God walks in him.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I met such a one,\x{201d} Sandwalker said softly. \x{201c}I would have killed him save that I pitied him.\x{201d}
He had not meant to speak aloud and he expected the Old Wise One to be angry, but he only nodded. \x{201c}We too pity such a one,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}and envy him. He is God. Understand that he pitied you as well.\x{201d}
\x{201c}He would have killed me.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Because he saw you for what you are, and seeing felt your shame. But only once, until sisterworld appears again as she did, may a man search out the plant and pluck new leaves, spitting away then that which he has carried and chewed until it comforts him no longer. If he takes the fresh leaves more often, he will die.\x{201d}
\x{201c}But the plant is harmless as you use it?\x{201d}
\x{201c}All of us have been warmed by it since we were very young, and we are healthy as you see us. Didn\x{2019}t we fight well? We live to a great age.\x{201d}
\x{201c}How long?\x{201d} Sandwalker was curious.
\x{201c}What does it matter? It is great in terms of experience\x{2014}we feel many things. When we die at last we have been greater than God and less than the beasts. But when we are not great, that which we carry in our mouths comforts us. It is flesh when we hunger and there is no fish, milk when we thirst and there is no water. A young man seeks a woman and finds her and is great and dies to the world. Afterward he is never as great again, but the woman is a comfort to him, reminding him of the time that was, and he is a little again with her what once he was wholly. Just so with us until our wives that were are white when we spit them into our palms, and without comfort. Then we watch sister-world\x{2019}s face to see how great the time has been, and when the phase comes again we find new wives, and are young, and God.\x{201d}
Sandwalker said, \x{201c}But you no longer look as we look now.\x{201d}
\x{201c}We were that, and have exchanged for this. Long ago in our home, before a fool struck fire, we were so\x{2014}roaming without whatever may be named save the sun, the night, and each other. Now we are so again, for are gods, and things made by hands do not concern us. And as we are, so are you\x{2014}because you walk only as you see us walk, doing as we do.\x{201d}
The thought of his own people imitating the Shadow children whom they by day despised amused Sandwalker; but he only said, \x{201c}Now it is late, and I must rest. I thank you for all your kindness.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You will not taste?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Not now.\x{201d}
The silent Shadow child, who seemed less real than the gossamer figure he crouched beside, returned the chewed fiber to his mouth and wandered away. Sandwalker stretched himself and wished Sweetmouth would come again to lie with him. The Old Wise One, without having left, was gone; and there were evil dreams: every part of him had vanished, so that he saw without eyes and felt without sJtin, hanging, a naked worm of consciousness amid blazing glories. Someone screamed.
They screamed again, and he came up fighting nothing, his arms flailing but his legs bound, his mouth full of grit. Cedar Branches Waving was screaming, and Leaves-you-can-eat and old Bloodyfinger seized his arms and pulled until he thought he must break. Around him in a circle the Shadow children watched, and Sweetmouth was crying.
\x{201c}This dirt at the bottom goes down,\x{201d} Bloodyfinger said when they had pulled him free, \x{201c}and sometimes it goes down fast.\x{201d}
Cedar Branches Waving said, \x{201c}When you were still small but thought you were grown, you wouldn\x{2019}t sleep beside me any longer, and I used to get up in the night and go over and see if you were all right. I woke and thought of that tonight.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Thank you.\x{201d} He was still gagging and spitting sand.
From the shadows a voice told him, \x{201c}We did not know. In the future, unsleeping eyes will watch you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Thank you all,\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}I have many friends.\x{201d}
There was more talk until, one by one, the humans returned to their resting places and lay down again. Sandwalker moved for a time around the floor of the pit, testing the footing and listening for the crawling of the sand. He heard only Ocean, and at last tried to sleep again. \x{201c}This cannot be true, Lastvoice was saying. \x{201c}Look again!\x{201d} \x{201c}I cannot . . . a cloud\x{2014}\x{201d} Ahead the oily surface of the river stretched away beneath the night sky; black, glistening, broadening, it showed no stars, nothing but its own water and bits of floating weed. \x{201c}Look again!\x{201d} Long hands, soft yet bony, gripped his shoulders.
Someone shook him, and it was not yet light. For a moment he felt that he was sinking into the sand once more, but it was not so. Bloodyfinger and Sweetmouth were beside him, and behind them other, unfamiliar, figures. He sat up and saw that these were marshmen with scarred shoulders and knotted hair. Sweetmouth said, \x{201c}We have to go.\x{201d} Her large, foolish eyes looked everywhere at no one.
There was a liana to help them climb, and with the marshmen behind they floundered up, Sandwalker and Bloodyfinger first, then Leaves-you-can-eat, then the two women and the Shadow children. \x{201c}Who?\x{201d} Sandwalker asked Bloodyfinger, but the older man only shrugged.
At the river Lastvoice stood with his feet in the shallows and the dawnlight behind him. There was a chaplet of white flowers on his head, hiding the scars where his hair had been burned away; and another garland, of red blossoms that looked black in the pale light, upon his shoulders. Eastwind stood near him, watching, and on the bank several hundred people waited\x{2014}silent figures light-stained early morning colors of yellow and red, their features growing clearer, individuals, a man here, a child there, standing suddenly contrasted from the mass with mask-like, immobile faces. Sandwalker ignored them and stared at Lastvoice; it was the first time he had seen the starwalker beyond the dreamworld.
Their guards drove them into the water until it reached their knees. Then Lastvoice lifted his arms and, facing the fading stars, began to chant. The chant was blasphemy, and after a few moments Sandwalker closed his ears to it, begging God that he might dive, swim deep, and so escape; but then the others would be left behind, and there were so many marshmen on the bank, and he had always heard that they were good swimmers. He asked the priest to help him, but the priest was not there. Then Lastvoice had finished, long before he expected it.
There was a silence, and Lastvoice stabbed the air with both hands. A sound, a moan that might have been of pleasure, came from the watchers. Men surged forward and seized old Bloody-finger and Leaves-you-can-eat, forcing them into deeper water. Sandwalker sprang to help them, but was at once struck down from behind; he floundered, fighting, expecting that they would try to hold him under, but no one molested him further. He got his feet beneath him and stood, coughing and wiping his long hair from his eyes. Men were still clustered around Leaves-you-can-eat and old Bloodyfinger, but the water was still, the ripples gold-tipped by the rising sun.
\x{201c}Two today,\x{201d} someone said behind Sandwalker. \x{201c}The people are delighted.\x{201d} He turned and saw Eastwind, who pushed past him and stalked away with the high-kneed hair-heron gait. \x{201c}Back to the pit,\x{201d} one of the guards announced, and with Cedar Branches Waving and Sweetmouth, Sandwalker turned and splashed back toward shore, the Shadow children following. He had just left the water when he heard the snap of breaking bone, and turning saw that two of the Shadow children were dead, their heads lolling as marshmen carried them away. He stopped, angry in a way he had not been at the other deaths. A guard pushed him.
\x{201c}Why did you kill them?\x{201d} Sandwalker said. \x{201c}They weren\x{2019}t even part of the ceremony.\x{201d}
Two grabbed him and bent his arms behind him. One said: \x{201c}They\x{2019}re not people. We can eat them anytime.\x{201d} The other added, \x{201c}Big feast tonight.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Let him go.\x{201d} It was Eastwind, who took his elbow. \x{201c}No use fighting, Brother. They\x{2019}ll just break your arms.\x{201d}
\x{201c}All right.\x{201d} Sandwalker\x{2019}s shoulders had been close to breaking already. He swung his arms back and forth.
Eastwind was saying: \x{201c}We usually sacrifice only one at a time\x{2014}that\x{2019}s why the people are excited now. With the two men and the two others there will be enough for a large piece for everyone, so they\x{2019}re happy.\x{201d}
\x{201c}The stars were kind, then,\x{201d} said Sandwalker.
\x{201c}When the stars are kind,\x{201d} Eastwind answered in a flat voice that was yet like an echo of his own, \x{201c}we don\x{2019}t send the river any messengers at all.\x{201d}
They had reached the pit before Sandwalker realized it was near. He strode to the edge determined to climb down rather than be pushed. Someone, a small figure that seemed to hold a smaller one, was already there; he stopped in surprise, was straight-armed from behind, and tumbled ignominiously down.
The newcomer was Seven Girls Waiting. That night the Old Wise One and the other remaining Shadow children sang the Tear Song for their dead friends. Sandwalker lay on his back and tried to read the stars to see if the message old Bloodyfinger and Leaves-you-can-eat had carried had had any effect, but he was not learned and they seemed only the familiar constellations. Seven Girls Waiting had spent the day telling all of them how she had followed him down the river and been caught, and the sorrow he had felt at first in seeing her had turned, as he listened, to a kind of weak anger at her foolishness. Seven Girls Waiting herself seemed more happy than frightened, having found in the pit substitutes for the companions who had deserted her. Sandwalker reminded himself that she had not seen the drownings.
Who could read the stars? The night was clear, and sisterworld, now much waned, had not yet risen; they shone in glory. Perhaps old Bloodyfinger could have, but he had never asked. He reminded himself that this was why the pit was called The Other Eye. Somewhere across the river Eastwind and Lastvoice would be studying the stars as well. Fretfully he rolled from side to side: the next time he would dive into the river and try to escape. Free, he might be able to help the others. If there remained others after the next time. He thought of Cedar Branches Waving being pushed beneath the surface (her face seen in agony through the ripples), then tried to put the thought aside. He wished that Seven Girls Waiting or Sweetmouth would come and lie with him and distract him, but they lay side by side, hands outstretched and touching, both asleep. The Tear Song rose and fell, then faded and died; Sandwalker sat up. \x{201c}Old Wise One! Can you read the stars?\x{201d}
The Old Wise One came acrass the sand to him. He seemed fainter than ever, but taller, as if his illusion had been stretched. \x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Although I do not always read there what your kind do.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Can you walk among them?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I can do whatever I choose.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Then what do they say? Will more die?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Tomorrow? The answer is both no and yes.\x{201d}
\x{201c}What does that mean? Who?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Someone dies every day,\x{201d} the Old Wise One answered. And then, \x{201c}I am what you call a Shadow child, remember. If the stars speak to me it is of our own affairs they speak. But it is all foolish divination\x{2014}the truth is what one believes.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Will it be Cedar Branches Waving?\x{201d}
The Old Wise One shook his head. \x{201c}Not she. Not tomorrow.\x{201d}
Sandwalker lay back, sighing with relief. \x{201c}I won\x{2019}t ask about the others. I don\x{2019}t want to know.\x{201d}
\x{201c}That is wise.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Then why walk among stars?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Why indeed? We have just sung the Tear Song for our dead. You were full of thoughts of the others who died, so we are not angry that you did not join\x{2014}but the Tear Song is better than such thoughts.\x{201d}
\x{201c}It won\x{2019}t bring them back.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Would we wish it?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Wish what?\x{201d} Sandwalker found, with a certain wrench of surprise, that he was angry, and angry at himself for being so. When the Old Wise One did not answer immediately he added, \x{201c}What are you talking about?\x{201d} The constellations flashed with icy contempt, ignoring them both.
\x{201c}I only meant,\x{201d} the Old Wise One said slowly, \x{201c}if our song could call back Hatcher and Hunter, would we sing? Returned from death, would we not kill them?\x{201d} Sandwalker noticed that the Old Wise One seemed younger than he had previously. Ghosts were strange.
And easily offended he remembered. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry if I sounded discourteous,\x{201d} he said as politely as he could. \x{201c}Hatcher and Hunter were your friends\x{2019} names? They were my friends too if I am a shadowfriend, and Bloodyfinger, and Leaves-you-can-eat. We should do something for them too\x{2014}sit around and tell stories about them until late\x{2014}but this doesn\x{2019}t seem like a place where you can do it. I don\x{2019}t feel good.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I understand. You yourself resemble the man you called Bloodyfinger to a marked degree.\x{201d}
\x{201c}His mother\x{2019}s mother and my mother\x{2019}s were probably sisters or something.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You are looking at my comrades, the other Shadow children. Why?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Because I never thought of Shadow children having names. I only thought of them as the Shadow children.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I know.\x{201d} The Old Wise One was staring at the sky again, reminding Sandwalker that he had said he could walk there. After what seemed a long time (Sandwalker lay down again, turning on his belly and resting his head on his arms, where he could smell, faintly, the salt tang of his own flesh), he said, \x{201c}Their names are Foxfire, Swan, and Whistler.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Just like people.\x{201d}
\x{201c}We had no names before men came out of the sky,\x{201d} the Old Wise One said dreamily. \x{201c}We were mostly long, and lived in holes between the roots of trees.\x{201d}
Sandwalker said, \x{201c}I thought we were the ones.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am confused,\x{201d} the Old Wise One admitted. \x{201c}There are so many of you now and so few of us.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You hear our songs?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am made of your songs. Once there was a people using their hands\x{2014}when they had hands\x{2014}only to take food; there came among them another who crossed from star to star. Then it was found that the first heard the songs of the second and sent them out again\x{2014}greater, greater, greater than before. Then the second felt their songs more strongly in all their bones\x{2014}but touched, perhaps, by the first. Once I was sure I knew who the first were, and the second; now I am no longer sure.\x{201d}
\x{201c}And I am no longer sure of what it is you\x{2019}re saying,\x{201d} Sandwalker told him.
\x{201c}Like a spark from the echoless vault of emptiness,\x{201d} the Old Wise One continued, \x{201c}the shining shape slipped steaming into the sea . . .\x{201d} But Sandwalker was no longer listening. He had gone to lie between Sweetmouth and Seven Girls Waiting, reaching out a hand to each.",

            ". . . a deceptive quality even to daylight, feeding the imagination, so that I sometimes wonder how much of what I see here exists only in my own mind. It gives me an unbalanced feeling, which the too-long days and stretched nights don\x{2019}t help. I wake up\x{2014}I did even in Roncevaux\x{2014}hours before dawn.
Anyway it\x{2019}s a cool climate, so the thermometer tells me; but it does not seem cool\x{2014}the whole effect is of the tropics. The sun, this incredible pink sun, blazes down, all light and no heat, with so little output at the blue end of the spectrum that it leaves the sky behind it nearly black, and this very blackness is\x{2014}or at least seems to me\x{2014}tropical; like a sweating African face, or the green-black shadows at <<noon|13>> in a jungle; and the plants, the animals and insects, even this preposterous jerrybuilt city, all contribute to the feeling. It makes me think of the snow langur\x{2014}the monkey that lives in the icy valleys of the Himalayas; or of those hairy elephants and rhinoceros that during the glaciations held on to the freezing edges of Europe and North America. In the same way, here they had bright-colored birds and wide-leaved, red- and yellow-blossomed plants (as if this were Martinique or Tumaco) in profusion wherever the ground is high enough to free it from the monotonous grasp of the salt reeds of the meadowmeres.
Mankind collaborates. Our town (as you see, a few days in one of these new-built, falling-down metropolises makes you an old resident, and I was considered an Early Settler before I had transferred the contents of my bags to the splintering dresser in my room) is largely built of logs from the cypress-like trees that dot the lowlands around it and roofed with plastic sheet, corrugated\x{2014}so that all we need is the throbbing of native drums in the distance. (And wouldn\x{2019}t it make my job easier to hear a few! Actually some of the earliest explorers farther south are supposed to have reported signal drumming on the standing trunks of hollow trees by the Annese; they are said to have used no drum-sticks, striking the trunk with the open hand as if it were a tom-tom, and like all primitives they would presumably have been communicating by imitating, with the sound of their blows, their own speech\x{2014}\x{201c}talking drums.\x{201d})",

            "Now that I have paper again it has proved possible, just as I predicted, to decipher the tappings of my fellow prisoners. How? you ask. Very well, I will tell you. Not because I must, but in order that you may admire my intelligence. You should, you know, and I need it.
By listening to the tapping it was not difficult to separate code groups which, as I realized, each represented a letter. I was greatly helped, I admit, by the knowledge that this code was meant to be understood, not to baffle, and that it must often be employed by uneducated men. By marking tallies I could determine the frequency of use of each group; so much was easy, and anyone could have done as well. But what were the frequencies of the letters? No one carries that information in his head except a cryptographer, and here is where I thought out a solution I flatter myself you would never have arrived at if you had had to sit in this cell, as it seems I must, until the walls crumble away to sand: I analyzed my own conversation. I have always had an excellent memory for what I have heard said, and it is even better for what I have said myself\x{2014}I can still recall, for example, certain conversations I had with my mother when I was four, and the oddity is that I comprehend now things she said to me which were perfectly opaque at the time, either because I did not know even the simple words she used or because the ideas she expressed, and her emotions, were beyond the apprehension of a child.
But I was telling you about the frequencies. I talked to myself\x{2014}like this\x{2014}sitting here on my mattress; but to prevent my unconscious favoring certain letters I wrote nothing down. Then I printed out the alphabet and went back, in my mind, over all that I had said, spelling the words and putting tallies beneath the letters.
And now I can put my ear to the sewer pipe that runs down through my cell, and understand.
At first it was hard, of course. I had to scribble down the taps, then work it out, and the fragment of message I had been able to record often conveyed no meaning: YOU HEARD WHAT THEY . . .
Often I got less than that. And I wondered why so much of what was being said was in numbers: <<TWO TWELVE|5k:1>> TO THE MOUNTAINS . . . Then I realized that they, we, call ourselves usually by our cell number, which gives the location and is the most important thing, I suppose, about a prisoner anyway.",

            "April 8. The boy is the worst shot I have ever seen; it is almost the only thing I have found thus far he doesn\x{2019}t do well. I have been having him carry the light rifle, but after watching him trying to shoot for three days I have taken it away from him\x{2014}his whole idea seems to be to point the gun in the general direction of whatever animal I indicate to him, shut his eyes, and pull the trigger. I honestly think that in his heart of hearts (if the boy has such a thing) he believes it is the noise that kills. Such game as we\x{2019}ve gotten so far I have shot myself, either snatching the light rifle away from him after he had fired once and making a second (running) shot before whatever he had missed was out of sight, or by using the heavy rifle, which is a waste of expensive ammunition as well as of meat.
On the other hand, the boy (I don\x{2019}t really know why I call him that, except that his father did; he is nearly a man, and now that I come to think of it, only eight or nine years younger, physiologically at least, than I am) has the best eye for wounded game I have ever seen He ij. better than a good dog, both at locating and retrieving\x{2014}which is saying a good deal\x{2014}and has traveled often in the \x{201c}back of beyond\x{201d}, though he\x{2019}s never been as far upriver as the (I hope not mystical) sacred cave we\x{2019}re looking for. At any rate he seems to have lived in the wilderness with his mother for long periods\x{2014}I get the impression she didn\x{2019}t care much for the kind of life her husband made for them in Frenchman\x{2019}s Landing, for which I can\x{2019}t say I much blame her. However that may be, with the boy\x{2019}s nose for blood and my shooting, I don\x{2019}t think we\x{2019}ll run short of meat.
What else today? Oh yes, the cat. One had been following us, apparently at least since we passed through Frogtown. I caught a glimpse of it today <<about noon|13>>, and (the sun-shimmer reinforcing the deceptive and fantastic quality extension has in the green landscape under this black-sky) thought for an instant that it was a tire-tiger. My bullet went high, naturally, and when I saw it kick up dust, everything snapped back into perspective: my \x{201c}scrub trees\x{201d} were bushes, and the distance which I had thought at least 250 yards away was less than a third of that\x{2014}making my \x{201c}tire-tiger\x{201d} only a big domestic cat of Terrestrial stock, no doubt a stray from some farm. It seems to follow us quite deliberately, staying, now, about a quarter mile behind us. This afternoon I took a couple of rather long-ranged (200 to 300 yards) shots at it, which upset the boy so much that I regretted my felicidal intentions and told him that if he could get the animal into camp he could keep it as a pet. I suppose it is following us for the scraps of food we leave behind. There will be plenty for it tomorrow\x{2014}I got a dew-deer today.",

            "April 11. An eventful day. Let me see if I can cure my habit of skipping back and forth and give everything of interest in the order in which it occurred. When I came back into camp last night (I see that at the close of yesterday\x{2019}s entry I left myself blundering about in bushes), the boy was asleep in his bag. I put more wood on the fire and played back the.tape and wrote the stuff on the last page, then turned in. About an hour before dawn we were both roused by a commotion among the mules and went running out to see what the trouble was, myself with a flashlight and the heavy rifle, the boy with two burning sticks from the fire. Didn\x{2019}t see anything, but smelled a stink like rotten meat and heard some big animal, which I really don\x{2019}t believe could have been one of the mules, making off. The mules, when we found them, were covered with sweat, and one had broken its hobble\x{2014}fortunately it didn\x{2019}t go far, and as soon as it got light the boy was able to catch it, though it took him the best part of an hour\x{2014}and the two that were still with us seemed very glad to claim the protection due domestic animals.
By the time we had thrashed around long enough to decide there was nothing to find, further sleep was out of the question. We struck the tent, loaded the mules, and then at my insistence spent the first hour in backtracking our path of the day before to see if we could turn up the spoor of any large predatory animal. We saw the cat (which growing bolder now that I\x{2019}ve stopped shooting at it) and some tracks of what the boy calls a fire-fox and which, by comparing his description with my Field Guide to the Animals of Sainte Anne, I have decided is most probably Hutchesson\x{2019}s fennec, a fox or coyote-like creature with immense ears and a liking for poultry and carrion.
After this little interlude of backtracking we made good progress, and about <<an hour before noon|10>> I made the best shot of the trip to date, dropping a huge brute\x{2014}not described in the Field Guide\x{2014}similar to the carabao of Asian Earth; this with a single brain shot from the heavy rifle. I paced the distance when the animal was down and found it to be a full three hundred yards!
Naturally I was proud as hell and carefully examined the result of my shot, which had struck the big fellow just in back of the right ear. Even there the skull was so massive that the bullet had failed to penetrate completely; so that the animal had probably been alive for a good part of the time while I was pacing off the distance to it; there seemed to have been a heavy flow of lachrymal fluid that left broad wet streaks in the dust beneath each eye. I lifted one of the eyelids with my fingers after I had looked at the wound and noticed that the eyes were double-pupiled, like those of certain Terrestrial fish; the lower segments of one eye moved slightly when I touched it with my finger, indicating that the animal may have been hanging on a bit even then. The double pupils don\x{2019}t seem characteristic of most life here; so I suppose they must be an adaptation induced by the creature\x{2019}s largely aquatic habits.
I longed to have the head mounted, but that was out of the question; as it was the boy was almost in tears (his own eyes, which are large, are a startling green), imagining that I would want to load the entire carcass, which must have weighed a good fifteen pounds, on to the mules, and assuring me that they could not be expected to carry so much. Eventually I was able to convince him that I intended to leave behind the entrails, the head (though how I regretted those horns!) and the hide and hoofs, as well as the ribs and, in fact, all but the choicest meat. The mules, even so, appreciated neither the added weight nor the smell of blood, and we had more difficulty with them than I had anticipated.
About an hour after we got them going again, we reached the bank of the Tempus. It is a very different river from the one I saw when the boy\x{2019}s father showed me the Annese\x{201c}temple\x{201d}. There it was nearly a mile wide, brackish, and had hardly a trace of current, the mouth itself being not a single river but a serpent cluster of dull streams meandering through a choking delta of mud and reeds. Here everything is changed: the water has hardly any yellow coloration, and flows fast enough to whisk a stick out of sight in a few seconds.
The meadowmeres are entirely behind us now, and this new, swift, clear Tempus runs among rolling hills covered with emerald grass and dotted with trees and thickets. I see now that my original plan of ascending the river by boat was\x{2014}as my acquaintances in Frenchman\x{2019}s Landing warned me\x{2014}completely impractical, no matter how convenient it would have been to search for riverbank caves that way. Not only is the water so swift even here that we would be spending most of our fuel just to fight the current, but the river shows every sign of falls and rapids farther up in the mountains. A hovercraft would perhaps be ideal, but with Sainte Anne\x{2019}s small industrial capacity there are probably not more than two dozen on the whole planet, and they are (typically) the sacred prerogative of the military.
But I will not complain. In a hovercraft we might already have found the cave, but with what chance of making contact with any Annese who may yet survive? With our small and I hope not frightening party moving slowly and living off the country, we can hope for contact, if any Annese remain.
Besides, let me confess now, I enjoy it. When we had struck the river and gone a mile or so upstream the boy became very excited and told me we had reached an important point which he had often visited with his mother. It seemed to me to be in no way unusual\x{2014}a slight bend with a few (very large) overhanging trees and a somewhat oddly shaped stone\x{2014}but he insisted that it was a beautiful and special locality, showing me how comfortable the stone was, on which one could sit or lie in various positions, how the trees shaded the sun and would give protection from rain and even, covered with snow, form a sort of hut in winter. There were deep pools at the foot of the stone that always had fish\x{2014}we could find mussels and edible snails (that French mother!)\x{2014}along the bank here, and in short it was a veritable garden spot. (After listening to him talk in this way for a few minutes I realized that he looks upon the outdoors\x{2014}at least on certain special areas or parts of it such as this\x{2014}in the way that most people are accustomed to looking at buildings or rooms, which is an odd idea.) I had been wanting to be alone for a few minutes anyway; so I decided to pamper his harmless enthusiasm, and asked him to take the mules on ahead while I remained behind to contemplate the beauty of the wonderful place to which he had introduced me. He was delighted, and in a few minutes I was more utterly alone than it is ever given most of us born on Earth to be, with only the wind and the sun and the sighing of the great trees that trailed their roots in the murmuring water before me.
Alone I should say except for our camp-follower cat, who came meowing up and had to be chased after the mules with rocks. It gave me time to think\x{2014}about that carabao-like animal I got this morning (which would surely be a record trophy of some sort if only I had been able to take the skull back to civilization) and about this entire trip. Not that I am not as eager as I was before to show that the Annese are not yet extinct, and to record as much as I can of their customs and mode of thought before they fade from humanity\x{2019}s knowledge altogether. I am, but for new reasons. When I landed here on Sainte Anne, all I really cared about was acquiring by field work enough reputation to get a decent faculty post on Earth. Now I know that field work can be, and should be, an end in itself; that those highly distinguished old professors I used to envy for their reputations were not seeking (as I thought) to go back into the field\x{2014}even if it were just to work over poor old played-out Melanesia once more\x{2014}to enhance their academic dignity; but rather that their standing was a tool they employed to secure backing for their field work. And they were right! Each of us finds his way, his place; we rattle around the universe until everything fits; this is life; this is science, or something better than science.",

            "Where was I? Yes, my arrest. The whole house was quiet\x{2014}I thought this was only because of the lateness of the hour, but I now realize that most of them must have been awake, knowing that they were waiting in my room for me, lying in their beds hardly daring to breathe while they waited for the shots or screams, Madame Duclose, particularly, must have been concerned for the large, gilt-framed mirror in my room, which she had cautioned me about repeatedly. (Mirrors, I have found\x{2014}I mean good ones of silvered glass, not polished bits of metal\x{2014}are quite expensive in Port-Mimizon.) And thus there was no snoring, no one stumbling down the corridor to the lavatory, no muffled sighs of passion from Mlle Etienne\x{2019}s room while she entertained herself with the fruits of imagination and a tallow candle.
I did not notice. I scrawled my note (others think my hand very bad, but I do not think so; when I receive my appointment I will\x{2014}if I have to teach classes at all\x{2014}have my students write on the chalkboard for me, or distribute notes for my classes already printed in purple ink on yellow paper) for Mme Duclose and went up, as I thought, to bed.
They were quite confident. They had a light burning in my room, and I saw the stripe of radiance at the bottom of my door. Surely if I had in fact committed some crime I would have turned and fled on tiptoe when I saw that light. As it was, I thought only that there had been some letter or message for me\x{2014}perhaps from the president of the university, or possibly from the brothelkeeper at the Cave Canem who had earlier that evening asked my help in dealing with his \x{201c}son\x{201d}; and I decided that if it were he, I would not answer until the evening following; I was very tired and had drunk enough brandy to feel let down now when it was flickering out, and I was conscious of the inefficiency of my motions as I got out my key and then discovered that my door was not locked.
There were three of them, all seated, all waiting for me. Two were uniformed; the third wore a dark suit which had once been good but was now worn and stained with food grease and the oil from lamps and, moreover, was a little too small for him, so that he had the appearance of the valet of a miser. He sat in my best chair, the chair with the needlepoint seat, with one arm hanging quite carelessly over the back of it, and the lamp with the globe painted with roses and the fringed shade at his elbow as though he had been reading. Mme Duclose\x{2019}s mirror was behind him, and I could see that his hair was cut short and that he had a scarred head, as though he had been tortured or had had an operation on his brain or had fought with someone armed with some tearing weapon. Over his shoulder I could see myself in the tall hat I had bought here in Port-Mimizon after landing, and my second best cape and my stupid, surprised face.
One of the uniformed men got up and shut the door behind me, throwing the night bolt. He wore a gray jacket and gray trousers and a peaked cap, and around his waist a broad brown pistol belt with a very large, old-fashioned looking revolver in a holster. When he sat again, I noticed that his shoes were ordinary workmen\x{2019}s shoes, not of much quality and already quite worn. The second uniformed man said, \x{201c}You may hang up your hat and coat, if you like.\x{201d}
I said, \x{201c}Of course,\x{201d} hanging them, as I usually did, on the hooks on the back of the door.
\x{201c}It will be necessary for us to search your person.\x{201d} (This was still the second uniformed man, who wore a short-sleeved green jacket with many pockets and loose green trousers with straps about the ankles, as though he were intended to ride a bicycle as part of his duties.) \x{201c}We will do this in either of two ways, depending on your own preference. You may, if you like, disrobe; we will then search your clothing and allow you to dress yourself again\x{2014}however, you must disrobe before us so that you have no opportunity to secrete anything you may have on your person. Or we will search you here and now, as you are. Which do you prefer?\x{201d}
I asked if I were under arrest and if they were the police. The man in the needlepoint chair answered, \x{201c}No, Professor, certainly not.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am not a professor, at least, not at present as far as I know. If I am not under arrest, why am I being searched? What am I supposed to have done?\x{201d}
The man who had shut the door said, \x{201c}We\x{2019}re going to search you to see if there\x{2019}s any reason to arrest you,\x{201d} and looked at the man in the black suit for confirmation. The other uniformed man said: \x{201c}You must choose. How will you be searched?\x{201d}
\x{201c}And if I will not submit to being searched?\x{201d}
The man in black said: \x{201c}Then we will have to take you to the citadel. They will search you there.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You mean that you will arrest me?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Monsieur . . .\x{201d}
\x{201c}I am not French. I am from North America, on Earth.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Professor, I urge you\x{2014}as a friend\x{2014}not to force us to arrest you. It is a serious matter here, to have been arrested; but it is possible to be searched to be questioned, to be\x{2014}as it may be\x{2014}even held for a time\x{2014}\x{201d}
\x{201c}Perhaps even to be tried and executed,\x{201d} the man in the green jacket finished for him.
\x{201c}\x{2014}without having been arrested. Do not, I beg you, force us to arrest you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}But I must be searched.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} said both the uniformed men.
\x{201c}Then I prefer to be searched as I am, without undressing.\x{201d}
The two uniformed men looked at one another as though this were significant. The man in black looked bored and picked up the book he had been reading, which I saw was one of my own\x{2014}A Field Guide to the Animals of Sainte Anne.
The man with the pistol belt came over, half-apologetically, to search me, and I noticed for the first time that his uniform was that of the City Transit Authority. I said: \x{201c}You\x{2019}re a horsecar driver, aren\x{2019}t you? Why are you carrying that gun?\x{201d}
The man in black said: \x{201c}Because it is his duty to carry it. I might ask why you yourself are armed.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I\x{2019}m not.\x{201d}
\x{201c}On the contrary, I have just been examining this book of yours\x{2014}there are tables of figures penciled on the flyleaves in the back, you see? Can you tell me what they are?\x{201d}
\x{201c}They were left there by some former owner,\x{201d} I told him, \x{201c}and I have no idea what they are. Are you accusing me of being some sort of spy? If you\x{2019}ll look at them you\x{2019}ll see they\x{2019}re nearly as old as the book and badly faded.\x{201d}
\x{201c}They are interesting figures; pairs of numbers of which the first is given in yards and the second in inches.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I\x{2019}ve seen them,\x{201d} I said. The man in the City Transit uniform was patting my pocjcets; whenever he found anything\x{2014}my watch, my money, my pocket notebook\x{2014}he handed it with an obsequious little gesture to the man in black.
\x{201c}I am of the mathematical turn of mind.\x{201d}
\x{201c}How fortunate for you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I have analyzed these figures\x{2014}they approximate quite well the conic section called a parabola.\x{201d}
\x{201c}That means nothing to me. As an anthropologist I am more often concerned with the normal distribution curve.\x{201d}
\x{201c}How fortunate for you,\x{201d} the man in black said, repaying me for my sarcasm of a moment before. He motioned to the two uniformed men, who came to him. For a moment the three whispered together, and I noticed how similar their faces were, all three with pointed chins, black brows and narrow eyes, so that they might have been brothers, the man in black the eldest and probably the cleverest as well, the City Transit man the least imaginative, but all three of a family.
\x{201c}What are you talking about?\x{201d} I said.
\x{201c}We were speaking of your case,\x{201d} the man in black said. The City Transit man left the room, shutting the door behind him.
\x{201c}And what were you saying?\x{201d}
\x{201c}That you are ignorant of the law here. That you should have an attorney.\x{201d}
\x{201c}That\x{2019}s probably true, but I don\x{2019}t believe you were saying that.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You see? An attorney would advise you against contradicting us in that tone.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Listen, are you from the police? Or the prosecutor\x{2019}s office?\x{201d}
The man in black laughed. \x{201c}No, not at all. I am a civil engineer from the department of public works. My friend here,\x{201d} he indicated the man in green, \x{201c}is an army signalman. My other friend as you divined, is a horsecar driver.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Then why have you come to arrest me as though you were police?\x{201d}
\x{201c}You see how ignorant you are of our ways here. On Earth, as I understand, it is different; but here all public employees are of one fraternity, if you follow me. Tomorrow my friend the horse-car driver may be picking up garbage\x{2014}\x{201d}
The man in green interrupted to snicker, \x{201c}You may say he\x{2019}s doing that tonight.\x{201d}
\x{201c}\x{2014}my friend here may be a crewman on one of the patrol boats and I may be an inspector of cats. Tonight we have been sent to get you.\x{201d}
\x{201c}With a warrant for my arrest?\x{201d}
\x{201c}I must tell you again that it is best for you if you are not arrested. I say to you frankly that if you are arrested it is very improbable that you will ever be released.\x{201d}
As he completed this sentence the door opened behind me, and I saw in the mirror Mme Duclose and Mlle Etienne, with the horsecar driver standing behind them. \x{201c}Come in, ladies,\x{201d} the man in black said, and the horsecar driver herded them into the room, where they stood side by side in front of the washstand, looking frightened and confused. Mme Duclose, an old, gray-haired woman with a fat stomach, wore a faded cotton dress with a long skirt (whether because the horsecar driver had allowed her to put it on before summoning her or because she had been using it for a night-gown, I do not know). Mlle Etienne\x{2014}a very tall girl of twenty-seven or -eight\x{2014}might have been not the sister, but possibly the half-sister or cousin of the three men. She had the sharply pointed face and the black eyebrows, but hers had been plucked thin to form arches over her eyes, which were, mercifully, not the dark, narrow eyes of the men but large and blue-purple like the dots of paint on the face of a doll. Her hair was a mop of brown curls, and she was, as I have said, exceedingly tall, her legs stiltlike in their elongation, rising on thin, straight bones to hips broader than seemed consonant with the remainder of her physique, after which her body contracted again abruptly to a small waist, small breasts, and narrow shoulders. She boasted tonight a negligee of some gossamer fabric like a very thin cheesecloth, but this was gathered in so many layers and foldings and wraps as to be quite opaque.
\x{201c}You are Mme Duclose?\x{201d} the man in black asked that lady. \x{201c}The owner of this house? You rent the room we presently occupy to this gentleman here?\x{201d}
She nodded.
\x{201c}It will be necessary for him to accompany us to the citadel, where he will converse with various officials. You will close this room and lock the door when we leave, do you understand? You will disturb nothing.\x{201d}
Mme Duclose nodded, wisps of gray hair bobbing.
\x{201c}In the event that the gentleman has not returned within one week, you will apply to the Department of Parks, which will dispatch a reputable man to this address. In his company you will be permitted to enter this room to inspect it for rodent damage and to open, the windows for the period of one hour, at the close of which you will be required to relock the room, and he will leave. Do you understand what I have just said?\x{201d}
Mme Duclose nodded again.
\x{201c}In the event that the gentleman has not returned by Christmas, you will apply to the Department of Parks as before. On the day following Christmas\x{2014}or in the event that Christmas falls on a Saturday, on the following Monday\x{2014}a reputable man will be dispatched as previously. In his company you will be permitted to change the bedding and, if you wish, air the mattress.\x{201d}
\x{201c}On the day after Christmas?\x{201d} Mme Duclose asked in bewilderment.
\x{201c}Or in the event that Christmas falls on Saturday, on the Monday following. In the event that the gentleman has not returned by one year from this date\x{2014}which you may compute, for your convenience, as being the first of the current month, should you so choose\x{2014}you may again apply to the Department of Parks. You may at that time\x{2014}if you wish\x{2014}place the gentleman\x{2019}s belongings in storage at your expense, or you may store them elsewhere in your home if you wish. They will be inventoried by the Department of Parks at that time. You may then use this room for other purposes. In the event that the gentleman has still not returned at a date fifty years distant from the date whose calculation I have just explained to you, you\x{2014}or your heirs or assigns\x{2014}may again apply to the Department of Parks. At that time the government will claim any article falling under the following categories: articles made wholly or in part of gold, silver, or any other precious metal; moneys in the currencies of Sainte Croix, Sainte Anne, or Earth, or other worlds; antiques; scientific appliances; blueprints, plans, and documents of all sorts; jewelry; body linen; clothing. Any article not falling under these categories shall become the property of you, your heirs, and assigns. If tomorrow you find you do not clearly recall what I have just told you, apply to me at the Department of Public Works, Subdepartment of Sewers and Drains, and I will explain to you again. Ask for the assistant to the General Inspector of Sewers and Drains. You understand?\x{201d}
Mme Duclose nodded.
\x{201c}And now you, Mademoiselle,\x{201d} the man in black continued, turning his attention to Mlle Etienne. \x{201c}Observe; I hand the gentleman a visiting pass.\x{201d} He took a stiff card, perhaps six inches long and two wide, from the breast pocket of his greasy coat and handed it to me. \x{201c}He will write your name thereupon and give it to you, and with it you will be admitted on your own recognizance to the citadel on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month between the hours of <<nine|20>> and <<eleven p.m.|5>>\x{201d}
\x{201c}Wait a moment,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t even know this young lady.\x{201d}
\x{201c}But you are not married?\x{201d}
\x{201c}No.\x{201d}
\x{201c}So your dossier informed me. In cases where the prisoner is unmarried it is the rule to give the card to the closest resident single woman of suitable age. It is, you will understand, based upon statistical probabities. The young woman may transfer the card to whomever you wish, who may then use it in her name. That will be something for you to discuss\x{2014}\x{201d} (he paused a moment in thought) \x{201c}\x{2014}ten days from now. Not now. Write down her name.\x{201d}
I was forced to ask Mlle Etienne\x{2019}s first name, which proved to be Celestine.
\x{201c}Give her the card,\x{201d} the man in black said.
I did so, and he laid one hand heavily on my shoulder and said, \x{201c}I hereby place you under arrest.\x{201d}",

            "I have been moved. I continue this record of my thoughts\x{2014}if that is what it may be said to be\x{2014}in a new cell. I am no longer my old self, <<one forty-three|9j>>, but some new, unknown 143; this because that old number was chalked upon the door of this new cell. The transition must seem very abrupt to you, reading this; but I was not actually interrupted in the task of writing, as it must seem. The truth is that I grew tired of detailing my arrest. I scratched. I slept. I ate some bread and soup the warder brought me and found a small bone\x{2014}the rib bone, I suspect, of a goat\x{2014}in my soup and with this held long conversations with my neighbor upstairs, forty-seven. I listened to the madman on my left until it almost seemed to me that among his idiot scratching and scrapings I could discern my own name.
Then there was a rattling of keys at the door of my cell, and I thought that perhaps Mlle Etienne was to be permitted to see me after all. I tried insofar as I could to make myself clean, smoothing my hair and beard with my fingers. Alas, it was only the guard, and with him a powerfully built man wearing a black hood which concealed his face. Naturally I thought I was going to be killed, and though I tried to be courageous\x{2014}and really felt that I was not especially fearful\x{2014}I found that my knees had become so weak that I could only stand with great difficulty. I thought of escape (as I always do when they take me to be questioned; it\x{2019}s the only chance, because there\x{2019}s no escaping from these cells), but there was only the narrow corridor to run in, as always, without windows and with a guard posted at every stair. The hooded man took my arm and, without speaking, led me through passageways and up and down steps until I was completely confused; we must have walked for hours. I saw any number of miserable dirty faces like my own staring at me through the tiny glassed Judas windows in the doors of the cells. Several times we passed through courtyards, and I thought I was to be shot in each; it was <<about noon|13>>, and the bright sunlight made me blink and my eyes water. Then in a corridor much like all the others we halted before a door marked 143, and the hooded man raised a concrete slab from the center of the floor, showing me a narrow hole from which a steep iron stair descended. I went down and he followed me; the distance must have been fifty meters or more, and at the bottom it was only with a flashlight that we were able to grope our way down a corridor stinking of stale urine, until we reached the door of this cell into which a push from him sent me sprawling.
At the time I was happy enough to sprawl, for I thought, as I have said, that I was about to be executed. I still do not know that it is not true; the man was certainly dressed as an executioner though that may have been merely to frighten me, and perhaps he has other duties.",

            "March 22. Met the two beggars, father and son, <<a few minutes before ten|10>>, this time remembering to bring my tape recorder, which I had neglected on the previous visit. (The account of our conversation I gave yesterday is true and correct to the best of my memory and was written immediately after the event, but I can promise no more.) Also a shotgun, bought locally yesterday, in case the meadowmeres afforded any edible waterfowl; it is a twenty gauge and thus rather too small for the purpose, but the only thing available except some poorly finished single-shots intended for sale to farmers. My landlord here recommended getting the gun and promised to cook anything I bagged in return for a half share of the meat.
(To anticipate slightly, I was fortunate and killed three good- sized specimen of a bird called the reed-hen, which the beggar pointed out to me as good to eat. It is slightly smaller than a goose and of a beautiful green color like a parrot or a parakeet; he claims they were a favorite article of diet among the Annese, and from my dinner tonight I believe him, though I am sure he knows no more about it than I do.)
All traces of the boat-hut were gone when I arrived, and the spot where it had stood was a mere corner of waste ground. The boy, bare-chested and barefooted, was leaning against a building nearby, and explained that his father was taking care of our vessel; he at once relieved me of the basket lunch I was carrying (which my landlord had prepared for us) and would have carried my tape recorder and gun as well if I had been willing to let him.
He led me some distance along the waterfront to a little floating jetty (which he called a stage), where I saw his father, in a blue shirt and an old red scarf, waiting in the boat that had been our roof the day before. The older man at once demanded the payment we had agreed upon, but settled, after an argument, for half\x{2014}the remaining amount to be paid on the termination of our tour. I then clambered (rather cautiously, I admit) into the boa the boy jumped in after me, and we were off, father and son each pulling an oar.
For five minutes or so we picked our way among the ships in the harbor, following an almost imperceptible curve in the river; then between the hulls of two big four-masters I saw, as though I were looking through a cleft rock into a valley of incredible green, the open, wild meadowmeres of Sainte Anne, which had been, before the coming of the first starcrossers from Earth (as the older man had truly said), the paradise of the Annese. Father and son laid harder to the oars; a sailor on one of the big ships gave us a few halfhearted curses, and we shot between them and out on to the broad water of the Tempus, now swollen by a high tide still making.
\x{201c}Five kilometers farther to the Oceansea,\x{201d} the beggar explained, \x{201c}and if the Doctor agrees\x{2014}\x{201d}
He was interrupted, as I saw, by something he had seen behind me. I twisted in my seat in the stern to look, but at first could see nothing.
\x{201c}Just by the t\x{2019}gallant yard of the ship on our left,\x{201d} the boy told me softly. I saw it then, a silvery object in the sky that seemed no bigger than a blown leaf. In three minutes it was overhead, a shark-shaped military craft perhaps a mile and a half long. It was not really silver, but the color of a knife, and I could make out tiny dots lining the sides that might have been observation ports or laser muzzles or both. The beggar said, \x{201c}Do not wave,\x{201d} then whispered something to the boy of which I caught only the beginning and end: \x{201c}Fa\x{ee}tes attention . . . fran\x{e7}ais!\x{201d} I think the meaning must have been, \x{201c}Remember that you are French.\x{201d} The boy answered something I could not hear and shook his head.",

            "I have made a discovery! A real discovery. I know where I am. After writing that last, I blew out my candle and lay down and tried to sleep again, and with my ear against the floor I could hear the sound of bells. If I took my ear from the floor I could not hear them at all, but if I pressed against it they were there, for as long as the ringing lasted. The corridor outside my door, then, runs under the Old Square toward the cathedral; and I must be near its foundations with the sound transmitted by the stones of the bell tower. Every few minutes now, I press my ear to the wall and listen again. For all the time I lived in the city I cannot remember how often the cathedral bells rang, except that I know they did not strike the hours like a clock.
At home there was no cathedral, but several churches, and for a time we lived close to that of St Madeleine. I remember the bells ringing at night\x{2014}I suppose for a <<midnight|13>> mass\x{2014}but it did not frighten me as other sounds did. Often the ringing did not wake me, but if it did I would sit up in my bed and look for my mother, who would also be sitting up, her beautiful eyes shining like shards of green glass in the dark. Any sound woke her, but when my father came stumbling home she would pretend to be asleep and make herself as unattractive as possible, something she could do without your noticing\x{2014}even if you were watching her\x{2014}with the muscles of her face. I have the same ability, though not to the extent she did; but I chose to cover everything with this beard instead, because I was afraid of it\x{2014}frightened of myself\x{2014}and needed only to make my voice like his and look older. But it does not do to be too clever, and I suppose I have been here more than long enough to have a beard now even if it had been clean-shaven when I was arrested.
I suppose, too, I grew my beard for my mother, to show her\x{2014}if I were ever to find her again (and there seemed to be some reason to think, at Roncevaux, that she had come here)\x{2014}that I am now a man. She never told me, but I know now that among the Free People a boy remains a boy until his beard sprouts. When he has enough to protect his throat from the teeth of the other men he is a man. (What a fool I was. I thought when she left, and for many years after, that she had gone because she was shamed by me, having found me with that girl; I know now that she had only been waiting until the milk-task was done. I had wondered why she smiled at me then.)",

I was very small and my mother\x{2014}at least I think the girl was my mother\x{2014}was holding me on her lap. My father was rowing us on the river, as he often did then, while he was still fond of fishing; I saw the reeds bowing to the wind all about us, and there were yellow flowers floating around the boat, but the odd thing about my dream was that I knew everything that I was to learn later, and I looked at my father, who seemed a red-bearded giant, and knew what would happen to his hands so that he could no longer follow his trade. My mother\x{2014}yes, I am sure it was she, though I never understood how one of the Free People could bear a child to my father\x{2014}had been buttoned into her yellow dress by him, and had the happy, tumbled look of a woman who had been dressed by a man; she smiled when he spoke, and I laughed; we all smiled. I suppose it was only some memory come back in the dream, and in those days he must have seemed an ordinary man, possibly a little more fond of talk than most, who lived on bread and meat and coffee and wine; it was only when he hadn\x{2019}t them anymore, not for himself or to give to us, that we found he lived on words.",

The day after the mule was killed (the thirteenth) I backtracked two hours in the hope of catching the ghoul-bear over the body. I was too late; the dead mule had been torn to bits, and everything but the hoofs and the largest bones consumed, also some of the carabao meat we had abandoned to lighten the animals. Wfiere the mule\x{2019}s carcass had been I saw hundreds of footprints left by a number of species. Some very small tracks might have been those of human children, but I cannot be sure.

V. R. T.: \x{201c}They are afraid.\x{201d}
Self: \x{201c}Of us?\x{201d}
V. R. T.: (Silent)
Self: \x{201c}Is it because the settlers have killed so many?\x{201d}
V. R. T.: (Very quickly) \x{201c}The Free People are good\x{2014}they do not steal unless others have plenty\x{2014}they will work\x{2014}they can herd cattle\x{2014}find horses\x{2014}scare away the fire-fox.\x{201d}
Self: \x{201c}You know I wouldn\x{2019}t shoot one of the Free People, don\x{2019}t you? I only want to ask them .questions, to study them. You\x{2019}ve read Miller\x{2019}s Introduction to Cultural Anthropology. Didn\x{2019}t you notice that the anthropologists never harm the people they\x{2019}re studying?\x{201d}
V. R. T.: (Stares at me)
Self: \x{201c}Do you think the Free People are frightened of us just because I shoot game to eat? That doesn\x{2019}t mean I would shoot one of them.\x{201d}
V. R. T.: \x{201c}You leave the meat on the ground; you could hang it in the trees so that the Free People and the Shadow children could climb and get it. Instead you leave it on the ground and the ghoul-bear and tire-tiger follow us.\x{201d}

Self: \x{201c}Why yes, you\x{2019}re an intelligent young man, but it would take a great deal of study, and you would have to go to college. How old are you?\x{201d}
V. R. T.: \x{201c}<<Sixteen|9q>> now. I know about college.\x{201d}
Self: \x{201c}You seem older than that\x{2014}would say seventeen at least. Are you counting in Earth years?\x{201d}
V. R. T.: \x{201c}No, Sainte Anne years. They are longer here, and besides we of the Free People grow up very fast. I can look older than this if I want to, but I didn\x{2019}t want to change too much from when you first saw me and hired our boat.

Self: \x{201c}Yes, I do. I didn\x{2019}t say I thought you could go directly into college; your preparatory work probably hasn\x{2019}t been good enough, and you would have to study for several years first, and learn at least the rudiments of a foreign language\x{2014}but I forgot, you already have some French.\x{201d}

Once in the iong dreaming days when Trackwalker was shaman of the abos, there was a girl called Three Faces. An abo girl, you see, and she used the colored clays the abos found by the river to paint a face on each breast\x{2014}one face, sir, forever saying No!\x{2014}that was the left breast\x{2014}and the other, the right, painted to say Yes! She met a cattle-drover in the back of beyond who fell very much in love with her, and she turned her right breast toward him! Well, sir, they lay together all night in the pitch darkness that you find at night in the back of beyond, and he asked her to come and live with him and she said she would, and learn to cook and keep house and do all the things human women do. But when the sun rose he was still asleep, and when he got up later she had gone and washed herself in the river\x{2014}that\x{2019}s for forgetfulness in the tales, you see\x{2014}and had only her one, natural face; and when he reminded her of all the things she had promised in the dark, she stood and stared at him and wouldn\x{2019}t talk, and when he tried to take hold of her, she ran away.\x{2019} \x{201d}
Self: \x{201c}That\x{2019}s an interesting bit of folklore, Dr Hagsmith. Is that the end of the story?\x{201d}
V. R. T.: \x{201c} \x{2018}No. When the drover began to dress himself\x{2014}after the girl was gone\x{2014}he found he had the images of the two faces on his own chest, the Yes! face on his left side and the No! face on his right. He put his shirt on over them and rode into Frenchman\x{2019}s Landing where there was a man who did tattoos and had him trace them with the tattoo needle. People say that when the drover died the undertaker skinned his chest inside the coat, and that he has the two faces of Three Faces preserved, rolled with cardamom in his desk drawer in the mortuary and tied with a black ribbon; but don\x{2019}t ask me if it\x{2019}s true\x{2014}I haven\x{2019}t seen them.\x{2019} \x{201d}",

            "<<Midnight|13>> or past. Fortunately they let me keep my candles and matches, or I could not write this. I had gone to sleep when a guard came in, took me by the shoulder, and told me I was \x{201c}wanted\x{201d}. My first thought was that I was to die; but he was grinning in a way that made that seem improbable, and I thought then that it was to be some nasty but half-funny indignity like getting my head shaved.
He took me to a room just at the edge of the cell area and shoved me in, and there waiting for me was Celestine Etienne, the girl from Mme Duclose\x{2019}s lodginghouse. It must be the height of summer outside now, for she was dressed as if to attend an evening mass on a summer Sunday\x{2014}a pink dress without sleeves, white gloves, and a hat. I know I used to think her tall as a stork, but the truth is that she looked a pretty creature there, with her big, frightened, blue-violet eyes. She stood when I came in, and said, \x{201c}Oh, Doctor, how thin you look.\x{201d}
There was one chair, a light we could not turn off, a wall mirror (which meant, I feel sure, that we were being observed from the next room) and an old, sagging bed with clean sheets stretched over a mattress it was probably better not to see.
And, surprisingly, a bolt on the inside of the door. We talked for a time afterward, and she told me that the day after I was arrested a man from the city treasurer\x{2019}s office had come to see her and told her that on Thursday of the following week\x{2014}the day she was to see me\x{2014}at <<eight p.m.|5>> precisely, she was to report herself to the Bureau of Licences. She had, and had been kept waiting until <<eleven|9c:1>>, when an official told her she could see no one that night as they w,ere closing the office, but to come back in two weeks. She had known very well, she said, what was being done, but had been afraid not to go every two weeks as they told her. Tonight she had no sooner sat down on the bench in the waiting room than the same official who had always dismissed her at eleven appeared and suggested that she go here to the citadel instead, adding that her presence at the Bureau of Licences would not be required again in the foreseeable future. She had stopped by Mme Duclose\x{2019}s to put on scent and changed her frock, and come here.",

            "April 26. The boy is dead. I have buried him where he will never be found, because I find, looking at the dead face, that I do not believe in strangers looking into graves. It happened this way. <<About noon|9h>> today we were leading the mules along a path that ran along the south rim of the gorge. It was about two hundred meters deep there, and narrow, with the water running swiftly in a deep channel at the bottom, bordered with red sand and broken stones. I reminded him that he had said we were still too far downstream to find the sacred cave of the Free People, but he said that there might be other such caves and climbed among the rocks anyway. I saw him fall. He tried to grasp a rock, then screamed and dropped down. I hobbled the mules and went back looking for him, hoping that in quieter water he would have been able to swim out. Downstream a long way, a big tree stood grasping the rock, with water at his feet, and had thrust out a root to catch my friend.
Let me confess now that I lied. The dates on this page and the one before are not correct. Today is the first of June. For a long time I did not write anything in this notebook, and then, tonight, I thought that I would keep it again and write down what had happened. As you see, my hand is still bad; I do not think it will ever be right again, although it looks healthy and there is no scar. I have trouble holding on to things.
I hid the dead boy\x{2019}s body in the cave in a sheer cliff beside the river. I think he would have liked that, and the ghoul-bears will not get it there; they can move big stones aside, but they cannot climb like a man. It took me three days to find the cave, with him strapped to one of the mules. Thecat I killed and laid at his feet.
I find I am unused to writing like this\x{2014}not just my hand, but writing down my thoughts. I wrote down the interviews, of course, and about seeing the sacred places, but not my thoughts. It has a fascination, and now there is no one else to talk to. No one else will read this anyway.
We\x{2014}the two mules and I\x{2014}move much more slowly than when he was alive. We walk only for three or four hours in the morning, and there is always something to stop for in these hills, a beautiful spot with shady trees and ferns or a place to look for the cave or a deep hole with fish in it. I have not killed any large animals since -he died, only eating fish and a few small creatures for which I set nooses I make of the tail hair I comb from the mules. Several times these snares have been robbed, but I am not angry; I believe I know who steals.
There are many things to eat here besides fish and animals, though it is still too soon for fruits or all but the first berries. I believe that the Wetlanders, I should say the Annese.of the meadowmeres, ate the roots of the salt reeds; I have tried them (you must first strip away the black underbark which is bitter and will kill fish if you pound a great deal of it between two stones), and they are good, though I think not very nourishing; it is best to eat them by Ocean so the white part can be dipped into the salt water after each bite.
There, in the meadowmeres, if you want to eat the roots you have only to pull some up, but there is very little else to eat besides fish and clams, or snails in the spring, unless you catch a bird. Here things are quite different and there are many foods, but all are hard to find. The shoots of certain plants are good, and worms you find in rotten wood. There is a fungus that grows only where no light comes that is very good.
As I said, I have not killed any large animals, though once I was very tempted. But the rifle makes so much noise\x{2014}and the shotgun even more\x{2014}that I am certain it would frighten away those I wish to find.",

            'June 7. Today a small stone came tumbling down the slope ahead of us. Dislodged by some animal, I am sure, but I could not see the animal. I thought that we were no longer followed since I have not been shooting game; my snares are seldom robbed now, and when they are there is often sign of the fire-fox. How strange I must look to them, with the mules. I wear no clothing except my shoes, which I need for the stones, but the mules must frighten them.
Much later. I do not know what time it is. Far <<after midnight|13>>, I think; sisterworld is half down the sky in the west, but she grows brighter and I can see far, far down the valley, and the great cliffs ahead glow with her blue light.
I will not say Later, for I only left this book for a few seconds to gather brush and dead grass for a fire. This is the first fire I have had in several days, but now that I am out of my sleeping bag I am cold, and I do not want to go back to sleep. I dreamed that naked people were crowding all around me as I slept. Children, twisted Shadow children that are neither children nor men, and a tall girl with long, straight hair that hung almost in my face when she bent over me.',

\x{201c}Yes, Ma\x{ee}tre.\x{201d}
\x{201c}You will be serving the commandant today?\x{201d}

\x{201c}Possibly an opportunity\x{2014}a graceful opportunity\x{2014}to speak to him will occur. Most probably when he asks you to convey his thanks to me for the loan of your services\x{2019}
\x{201c}Yes, Ma\x{ee}tre.\x{201d}
\x{201c}At that time you might contrive to inform him that I remained awake all night to deal with this case, and that I sent it off this morning by the first ship sailing for Port-Mimizon. Do you understand?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes, Ma\x{ee}tre. Ida, Ma\x{ee}tre.\x{201d}
For an instant the slave let slip his normal look of deference and smiled; and the officer, seeing that smile, understood that he would carry out the instruction if he could, that some secret love of intrigue and duplicity in him delighted in it. And the slave, seeing the officer\x{2019}s expression, knew that he would never have to return to the carding rooms and the looms, understanding that the officer knew that he would do everything he could, for the sheer love of it. He put the dispatch box on his shoulder to carry it to the wharf and the ship Evenstar, and they parted, both quite happy. When he had gone, the officer found a spool of tape where it had rolled behind the lamp on his table; he dropped it ffttt the window into one of the neglected flower beds, among the sprawling angels\x{2019}-trumpets.",
