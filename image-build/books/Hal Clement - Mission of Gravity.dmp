            "And the fear passed with it. <<Nearly six|9:0>> body lengths above the ground, he found himself crouched almost calmly. He was holding tightly, of course; he even remembered, later, reflecting how lucky it was that the wind had continued to drop, even though the smooth metal offered an unusually good grip for his sucker-feet. It was amazing, the viewpoint that could be enjoyed\x{2014}yes, he enjoyed it\x{2014} from such a position. Looking down on things really helped; you could get a remarkably complete picture of so much ground at once. It was like a map; and Barlennan had never before regarded a map as a picture of country seen from above.",

            '"I haven\'t the faintest idea," the Mesklinite replied dryly. "I have seen things like this before, but only rarely. They usually stay in the deeper, permanent seas; I have seen one once only on the surface, and <<about four|9:0>> cast up as is this one. I do not know what they eat, but apparently they find it far below the surface. I have never heard of a ship\'s being attacked by one."',

"All right. What\'s my <<noon|13>> bearing?"
The men were keeping close track of the Bree\'s position by means of the radiation from the vision sets, although it was quite impossible to see the ship from beyond the atmosphere with any telescope, and the meteorologist had no trouble in giving the captain the bearing he wanted. The sails were adjusted accordingly and the Bree moved off on the new course.',

            'Fortunately Reejaaren did not return for a good many days. His people remained; <<four to six|10a:0>> gliders were always drifting overhead, and several more squatted on the hilltops beside their catapults. The number of aircraft did not change noticeably, but the population of the hilltops increased day by day. The Earthmen above had entered into Dondragmer\'s plan with enthusiasm and, Barlennan suspected, some little amusement. A few of the sailors were unable to pick up what was needed with sufficient speed, and had to be left out of the main plan in one sense; but even they understood the situation and would, Barlennan was sure, be able to contribute to the desired effect. In the meantime he put them to work repairing the shattered masts, whose rigging had at least kept them with the ship.',

Rick, look up or find out somehow the solubility of hydrogen in methane at eight atmospheres pressure and temperatures between minus <<one forty-five|5k:1>> and one eighty-five Centigrade. Dave, put that slide rule back in your pocket and get to a calculator; get as precise a value of the hydrogen density on that clifftop as physics, chemistry, math, and the gods of good weather men will let you. Incidentally, didn\'t you say there was a drop of as much as three atmospheres in the center of some of those tropical hurricanes? Charlie, find out from Barlennan whether and how much he and his men felt that. Let\'s go." The conference broke up, its members scattering to their various tasks. Rosten remained in the screen room with Lackland, listening to his conversation with the Mesklinite far below.',

Look: winter in the part of Mesklin you know\x{2014}the southern hemisphere\x{2014}coincides with the world's passage of its closest point to the sun. That's summer in the north, and the icecap boils off\x{2014}that's why you have such terrific and continual storms at that season. We already knew that. The condensing moisture\x{2014} methane\x{2014}whatever you want to call it\x{2014}gives up its heat and warms the air in your hemisphere, even though you don't see the sun for three or four months. The temperature probably goes up nearly to the boiling point of methane\x{2014}around minus <<one forty-five|5k:1>> at your surface pressure. Isn't that so? Don't you get a good deal warmer in winter?\"",
