            "Let\x{2019}s start with the title, The Friends of Eddie Coyle. Eddie Coyle has no friends. Eddie barely has acquaintances. Eddie Coyle is our hopeless, helpless, hapless Everyman in the Boston criminal underworld of 1970. He might be the worst guide ever, because he is utterly out of his depth. Or, on second thought, maybe he\x{2019}s the best guide ever, because most of the people who swim in this sea are out of their depth, which is how they end up on the <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> news or on a metal slab, doing <<ten-to-twelve|10a:1>> on C Block, or hanging from a post office wall. In Eddie Coyle\x{2019}s world, no one is out to screw anyone on purpose; it just happens that way. No one wakes up trying to do bad or put a hurt on anyone; they\x{2019}re just trying to get by, and sometimes getting by means leaving a fair share of accidental wreckage in your wake. But rest assured, it\x{2019}s nothing personal.",

Eighteen inches away from the clock, down two feet from its eye-level location, there was the black-gloved hand of the spokesman. It held, very steadily, a heavy revolver. Sam saw that there was some kind of a rib on the barrel, and that the handle was molded out to cover the top of the hand that held it. He saw touches of gold inside the black metal of the cylinders. The hammer of the revolver was drawn back to full cock. The minute hand did not seem to have moved.',
