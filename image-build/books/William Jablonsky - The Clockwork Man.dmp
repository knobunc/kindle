She has been the Master\x{2019}s closest companion since the death of Frau Gruber two years before I was first wound, and he has on many occasions benefited from her assistance in his workshop. Just last night, in fact, she stayed up well past her usual bedtime of <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> (despite it being a school night) helping him perfect the rotation on a multi-ringed carousel clock meant as a gift for Jakob\x{2019}s middle school. She has, with the Master\x{2019}s help, built herself an impressive attic observatory, where she often retreats after dinner to peer at the stars through the homemade telescope she and her father built together. It is her place of refuge, where she records whatever new phenomenon shemight observe in the hope of discovering something heretofore unknown. In fact, she believes she has charted a new comet that has thus far gone unnoticed, and is in the process of taking notes to submit to the Astronomical Society. Her only qualm is that she will undoubtedly have to submit her findings through her father, as her recent posts to the Society have gone without response. The Master has remarked several times that she may well become the next Copernicus, and that he ought to send her to Oxford or Wittenberg to foster her magnificent intellect, but as soon as the words leave his lips, his face falls and he goes quiet. I have observed his behavior long enough to know her absence would fill him with great sadness. I myself can scarcely imagine life in this house without her.",

It is not simply some bare-walled cellar devoid of stimulation\x{2014}quite the opposite. In fact, I find myself fascinated by the many sketches and designs for his great clocks, those already constructed and others he is currently planning. The blueprints are so intricate, it would take me many hours to fully comprehend the design and function of each component, much less the whole mechanism. A few of these magnificent spectacles have taken years to construct, particularly the steeple design commissioned by a hotel owner in London, which features hundreds of tiny swallows perched all over the clock\x{2019}s face, who flap their wings at <<seven o\x{2019}clock|6>> each morning. The Master fashioned them one at a time, testing each individually before mounting them to the clock. While he was completing the project, the tiny, feathery, flapping things covered his worktables so that there was not a free inch of space. They were quite realistic, with real feathers he and Giselle had glued on, and beady, glinting onyx eyes, though I have come to expect nothing less from his craftsmanship. When Jakob, then only five, saw them flapping their wings on the tabletops, he screamed, and the Master laughed with pride before rushing up to comfort him. (Giselle has since informed me that, during a foray in the park before I was wound, he wandered too close to a flock nesting in several trees, and was attacked.) On occasion he still has nightmares in which he is swarmed by dense flocks of tiny birds, pecking and scratching at his limbs and face. (The problem was once so severethe Master feared Jakob would require the services of a mental health specialist, but it has since leveled off to rare bouts.)",

I am still uncertain as to why, but I have no knowledge of the culinary arts and so must assume she had good reason.

At <<5:30|2>> on the morning of the twenty-eighth, an armored truck appeared in the police station\x{2019}s parking lot, and three burly, armed men came into my holding area to escort me into the truck. Sergeant Albright followed, presumably to walk me to the door. I searched the grounds for a glimpse of Greeley, but did not see him. Perhaps he has washed his hands of me in frustration. Though I insisted I would not flee, one of the armed men put a pair of handcuffs and leg irons on me.",

I find it marvelous that the house still stands; yet I recall the oppressive silence after I had been left alone. Without the family there, I can only assume it is similarly empty and silent, and while I might inhabit all the familiar places of my past, I should never be able to share them, save with the occasional visiting tourist. And there are certain rooms in which I could not bring myself to set foot, lest I be reminded that my happiest, most intimate moments are but distant memories. While I should be grateful if, by my mere presence, the true extent of the Master\x{2019}s genius might finally be revealed to the world, I would be but a relic, yet another piece in a collection of his works.",

I regret having caused some laughter among the onlookers, as my inexplicable accent has lingered throughout my time here.

I was also momentarily distracted during my <<one o\x{2019}clock|6>> performance by a familiar face in the crowd: Greeley, standing in a corner of the mall, shaking his head disgustedly as he watched me, then leaving before I had finished.
