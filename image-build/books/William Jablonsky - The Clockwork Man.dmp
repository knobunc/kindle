I am pleased to report that Giselle\x{2019}s ball was a splendid success, and she the hit of the evening. According to her own account, several of the young men complimented her on her dancing, and she herself took the lead with some of the less-experienced cadets. Since then, she has been twirling about the house, playing various waltzes on the phonograph to accompany herself. She is so pleased with her success that she insists we continue to practice at least once a week when I am not assisting her father with his work.",

            "She is a highly intelligent girl, and despite her age\x{2014}she is but three months from her seventeenth birthday\x{2014}she has demonstrated an intellectual curiosity that matches her father\x{2019}s. She has been the Master\x{2019}s closest companion since the death of Frau Gruber two years before I was first wound, and he has on many occasions benefited from her assistance in his workshop. Just last night, in fact, she stayed up well past her usual bedtime of <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> (despite it being a school night) helping him perfect the rotation on a multi-ringed carousel clock meant as a gift for Jakob\x{2019}s middle school. She has, with the Master\x{2019}s help, built herself an impressive attic observatory, where she often retreats after dinner to peer at the stars through the homemade telescope she and her father built together. It is her place of refuge, where she records whatever new phenomenon shemight observe in the hope of discovering something heretofore unknown. In fact, she believes she has charted a new comet that has thus far gone unnoticed, and is in the process of taking notes to submit to the Astronomical Society. Her only qualm is that she will undoubtedly have to submit her findings through her father, as her recent posts to the Society have gone without response. The Master has remarked several times that she may well become the next Copernicus, and that he ought to send her to Oxford or Wittenberg to foster her magnificent intellect, but as soon as the words leave his lips, his face falls and he goes quiet. I have observed his behavior long enough to know her absence would fill him with great sadness. I myself can scarcely imagine life in this house without her.",

Giselle cleared off one of the benches and gently removed my jacket so her father could repair the dent in my outer shell with a thick, heavy suction cup. I lay facedown on his workbench, forbidden to move lest I cause him to slip and damage me. As he worked Giselle gently intertwined her fingers with mine, and I was not afraid.

This morning I accompanied Giselle and Fr\x{e4}ulein Gruenwald on a number of errands in town, strolling back and forth along Elisabeth Street to patronize the densely packed shops that line this part of the city. I am told the ancient buildings and cobblestone streets, some of which are several hundred years old, are part of the charm of this city, though I must admit, having known them for the entirety of my existence, I cannot fully appreciate their beauty.

Upon further thought, I feel it necessary to explain that exile into the Master\x{2019}s workshop is not an unpleasant fate. It is not simply some bare-walled cellar devoid of stimulation\x{2014}quite the opposite. In fact, I find myself fascinated by the many sketches and designs for his great clocks, those already constructed and others he is currently planning. The blueprints are so intricate, it would take me many hours to fully comprehend the design and function of each component, much less the whole mechanism. A few of these magnificent spectacles have taken years to construct, particularly the steeple design commissioned by a hotel owner in London, which features hundreds of tiny swallows perched all over the clock\x{2019}s face, who flap their wings at <<seven o\x{2019}clock|6>> each morning. The Master fashioned them one at a time, testing each individually before mounting them to the clock. While he was completing the project, the tiny, feathery, flapping things covered his worktables so that there was not a free inch of space. They were quite realistic, with real feathers he and Giselle had glued on, and beady, glinting onyx eyes, though I have come to expect nothing less from his craftsmanship. When Jakob, then only five, saw them flapping their wings on the tabletops, he screamed, and the Master laughed with pride before rushing up to comfort him. (Giselle has since informed me that, during a foray in the park before I was wound, he wandered too close to a flock nesting in several trees, and was attacked.) On occasion he still has nightmares in which he is swarmed by dense flocks of tiny birds, pecking and scratching at his limbs and face. (The problem was once so severethe Master feared Jakob would require the services of a mental health specialist, but it has since leveled off to rare bouts.)",

Frau Gruber, while sifting through the Master\x{2019}s pantry, had discovered the kosher salt Fr\x{e4}ulein Gruenwald had purchased to encrust her pork shoulder roast, and had found it unacceptable. I am still uncertain as to why, but I have no knowledge of the culinary arts and so must assume she had good reason. Fr\x{e4}ulein Gruenwald volunteered to replace it with a coarse sea salt, and before leaving the Master instructed me to accompany her, if only to free me from his workshop for a while, and to provide Fr\x{e4}ulein Gruenwald with a suitable escort.",

I am somewhat relieved to report that Herr Gruber\x{2019}s anger with me was not significant. However, nine hours, twenty-seven minutes after sending me down to his workshop, he finally came for me. He ordered me up onto my bench and began probing me in several places with a thin screwdriver. By his estimation, that newsstand weighednearly a thousand pounds, and I had hoisted it high into the air and into a wall ten feet away. A single human being, even a very strong one, would have torn several muscles by simply lifting it, and while my construction differs greatly, he wished to inspect me for injury.",

(The Master dearly loves his mother; however, around guests she has a tendency to be somewhat abrasive, and he admires these visitors too much to risk embarrassment.) Then, soon after, I will accompany him on a long train trip to survey sites for new commissions, and to service some of his existing models. He has determined that in light of my miscalculated rescue in front of the taxidermist\x{2019}s shop, it might be a sound idea for me to spend some time away from this place, so that the population might forget their nervousness around me. (I also accompany him for practical reasons; some of his clocks contain large components far too heavy for him to manipulate alone.) While I have traveled with him before, he has promised that on this trip, I will see things I have only read about in his library.

This afternoon Herr Gruber entertained his two gentlemen from America, who represent a large research and manufacturing concern based in Detroit. He deeply admires the work of the elder, a greatmind credited with hundreds of inventions, most notably harnessing electric light in a small glass bulb, which the Master predicts will soon replace all the gaslights on our city streets. I have seen this creation, and despite its ingenuity, I will be sad to see the warmth of our gaslights vanish in favor of the harsh glare of that little bulb. The great inventor was a stately, courteous man of middle age, balding, immaculately dressed, with a slight hearing impairment\x{2014}the Master and I often had to repeat ourselves for his sake. His junior counterpart was a small, wiry man with a deep brow, sunken eyes, and a wide, well-lined forehead who overenunciated when he spoke, perhaps as a concession to his companion\x{2019}s disability.",

Surprisingly, he asked me what I thought of the sights on the trip, and seemed delighted when I responded in English. Finally he opened his briefcase and handed the Master a two-week-old edition of The New York Times he had bought at the train station, pointing out a small article which quoted Herr Edison denouncing me as a fraud, in his words a \x{201c}walking cuckoo clock,\x{201d} and had filed a patent himself on behalf of his Detroit Edison Company, whom he claimed would have a virtual army of clockwork servants ready for the market within five years.

I wondered why, despite his confidence that Herr Edison could never duplicate his design, he continued to brood so. Upon reflection I believe his long-held admiration for the great inventor blinded him to Herr Edison\x{2019}s motives, and is the source of his disappointment. I have yet to know such disappointment or betrayal, and it comforts me that, so long as I am in the care of the Master and his family, I never will.

For the past two days the Master has been in his study, a small square of a room adjoining the den, attempting to compose a rebuttal to Herr Edison\x{2019}s claim that I am a fraud. He believes that, if published in The New York Times or some other highly circulated newspaper, he will gain moral vindication, and has tossed aside a score of drafts as being unworthy of a gentleman. Giselle and Fr\x{e4}ulein Gruenwald have been charged with preparing food for the upcoming family gathering, while for most of that time I have been at his side, or fetching him carafes of coffee and wine, only leaving to check on Giselle and Jakob or to wind myself. He instructed me to inform the children that he is finalizing arrangements for the Nonnberg Abbey clock\x{2014}the detail is primarily for Giselle, who would balk at a less specific excuse\x{2014}and was not to be disturbed. Jakobhas spent most of this time trying to sled outside, though the snow is hardly deep enough; for her part, Giselle continues to suspect her father\x{2019}s distress is not the product of fatigue, but has thus far respected his request for privacy. He has slept only sporadically since beginning the letter; from time to time he falls face-first at his writing desk in midsentence. He ordered me to prod him awake if he should doze, but on Fr\x{e4}ulein Gruenwald\x{2019}s suggestion I have taken to letting him sleep up to an hour before rousing him.",

As the family prepared to leave yesterday, I was called upon to help carry the bags out to their respective carriages.

In the meantime the Master has offered me greater freedom outside his home, should I wish to go somewhere (accompanied by Giselle or Fr\x{e4}ulein Gruenwald, of course, to avoid any misunderstandings), a relaxation of my household duties, additional books as my interests grow.

The Master has not stirred from his workshop in forty-eight hours, taking neither food nor drink.

I must admit, my curiosity was not great; since discovering the great length of time I have missed, I have had little motive to leave the garage. Now that he is reasonably certain I will not allow myself to run down again, Greeley has ventured out for brief periods to solicit funds from passersby and purchase hot dogs from a local vendor, and to relieve himself\x{2014}which he does on the curb outside this structure. The Master would have been appalled that I had fallen in with such an individual\x{2014}he detested beggars and tramps, whom he considered lazy and irresponsible.

For the past two afternoons Herr Greeley has been wandering into town to, as he puts it, \x{201c}earn some money.\x{201d} By this I assume he means to panhandle. Despite my deeply ingrained resistance to the practice, I gather he is most adept at it, as he often returns with upwardof twenty dollars, mostly in coin form, his pockets jingling when he moves. He has also managed to obtain two half-consumed packs of cigarettes and several frankfurters from a local vendor, which he stores in his pack for future meals. It is somewhat warm, particularly in this garage, and if he does not eat them before the next day they tend to go rancid; twice after eating one he has vomited profusely. The first time he was able to reach the curb outside; the second time, the urge overcame him too quickly, and he spewed the contents of his stomach in the corner, which he then left to dry for several hours before finally diluting it with a bottle of water from his pack. Apparently he keeps several, which he fills at drinking fountains in various public buildings. The odor, he says, has lingered for some time, prompting him to try to open one of the windows, which are barred by thick metal plates bolted over them; after several failed attempts he looked at me impatiently, and I pulled off the plate easily. As I have previously mentioned, the Master never gifted me with an olfactory sense, so it does not affect me; Herr Greeley says I should be grateful. I asked him why he continued to eat the spoiled wieners if they sickened him, to which he replied, \x{201c}Gotta take \x{2019}em when you can get \x{2019}em.\x{201d}",

Across the river, partly illuminated by the light from the bridge, were a number of former warehouses and factories which, if the signs are accurate, will soon be transformed into fashionable luxury apartments.",

The words Lakeside Floral And Gifts were painted on the front window, which was filled with red-and-white carnations and lined with cardboard cutouts in the shape of daisies and roses. Next to the building was a small greenhouse, its walls papered over, sporting signs advertising discounts on various plants. I saw no lights on from my vantage point. At the time I was concerned that the culprits might have stolen the van, or taken Carrie elsewhere to commit their perversions upon her. Had that been the case our cause would be lost and Carrie doomed.

He has also replaced the thin glass of my window with a much thicker, stronger variety he claims will stop a bullet. While I believe I am capable of breaking the cables, the gate and window are another matter. To make matters worse, I am now being monitored at all times, and would be discovered immediately.",
