For the last two weeks her husband had refused to see anyone, remaining locked up in his workroom with orders that he not be disturbed. As the Colonel\x{2019}s carriage reached the gates, a painted mechanical gate-keeper wheeled jerkily out of its lodge, legs moving on an electric track as it approached and touched the lock of the gates. The gates swung open, the automaton stiffly raising its right arm in salute. When the carriage had crossed the hidden trip wire which lay at the entrance the gates began to close. As the carriage moved off in a wall of dust down the rutted road which led to Tours, the automaton trundled back into its lodge and an electric bell sounded within the house signalling that the visitor had departed. A moment later she heard a second bell. She looked up at the bell panel installed in her sitting room. That would be for Jules. Soon Jules would come upstairs to tell her that the Master could not leave his work to join her for supper.",

The year before last in the Rue de Rivoli at <<eight o\x{2019}clock|6>> on a September evening Emmeline stood in a crowd of spectators, watching a file of carriages move into the courtyard of the Palais des Tuileries. From these carriages she saw, descending, gentlemen in knee breeches and silk stockings, officers in dress uniforms and decorations, ladies in billowing crinolines, their breasts almost bare, their necks and arms adorned with pearls, rubies and diamonds. A woman beside Emmeline pointed out two famous beauties, the Duchesse de Pourtales and the Marquesa de Contadades, as the guests moved under a marquee into the entrance hall of the Pavillon de l\x{2019}Horloge. Swiss guards stood to attention there, halberds to hand, plumed helmets on their heads.

            "That Thursday, arriving with Madame Cournet at precisely <<three o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>> at a Parisian villa in the suburbs of Paris, Emmeline wearing her very best daytime dress, coat and hat was shown by a servant into a reception room crowded with gilt-edged chairs, gold mirrors, embroidered pillows, small tables covered with knick-knacks and silver-framed photographs. She and Madame Cournet were invited to sit on a large red satin sofa. In an adjoining room a fountain of eau-de-Cologne spurted continuously, filling the air with a sweet yet pungent odour. Monsieur West made his entrance ten minutes later, accompanied by three young male assistants. He was enormously fat and spoke French with an English accent which Emmeline found hard to understand. He wore a loose silk smock, black velvet trousers and a huge velvet beret which fell over his right eye. He described himself as an artist and in the next hour, having inspected Emmeline as though she were a piece of furniture, he made sketches and notes which in subsequent weeks evolved into morning costumes of grey velvet, black velvet and dark-blue poplin adorned with sable tippets. There were also sable and chinchilla hats with coats to match; five afternoon gowns and seven sumptuous evening dresses, each costume, gown and dress made to emphasize that it was unique and indisputably the work of an artist in haute couture. Because all of the evening dresses were crinolines, Emmeline had to practise walking in them, so difficult were they to manoeuvre. In addition, under their wide hoops she must wear pantaloons. And as she lacked certain items of jewellery which Monsieur West considered essential, Madame Cournet took her to a discreet boutique where decorated fans, bracelets and bandeaux were rented out to her for a period of a month against a large deposit.",

When porters had been summoned, the two servants followed the luggage into the station, Emmeline remaining outside the entrance not wanting to be the first guest to arrive. At <<2 p.m.|5>> when at last she went in, she saw at once, on Platform Number One, a smart train, its carriages adorned with the Napoleonic eagle, waiting under a sign, Extra et Imperial. Standing near this sign was a gentleman who, when he saw her approach, introduced himself as Vicomte Walsh, an imperial chamberlain.

To the peasants and even the townspeople in nearby Tours her husband was not, as he thought, a person they regarded with fear and reverence. Fear, yes, but it was a fear of witchcraft, of persons in league with the Evil One. Emmeline knew this, as Lambert would never know it, for her mother was a country woman, born in the Bercy, not far from here. Her mother, while pretending to laugh at such superstitions, was, Emmeline knew, no different from her peasant forebears. In the unchanging world Parisians called La France profonde, night was host to hobgoblins, witches and will-o\x{2019}-the-wisps. Even in the bright sunlight of a summer\x{2019}s day you might touch a grassy mound or venture into a field sacred to the fairies, those malevolent others who could cast a spell on you, a spell which brought misfortune. And why should the peasants not believe in such things, passed down from generation to generation? For them the world did not exist outside their townlands. Most did not know how to read or write, few had ever been in a theatre and, even in cities like Tours or Rouen, many among her husband\x{2019}s audiences believed his inventions and illusions were a gift, granted him by that world which lies hidden behind our visible world, a world ruled by mysterious powers stronger than the Church, capable of miracles no saint could match.",

The Governor-General, Mar\x{e9}chal Randon, was, Emmeline saw, a short spare man in his late fifties with the air of an administrator rather than a highly decorated soldier. She felt Henri come to attention beside her, felt his tension as he prepared to step on stage in a role different from any he had played before. But at that moment she saw Deniau, walking a little to the left of the Mar\x{e9}chal but with the air of someone of equal rank to the Governor-General himself. And in that moment he raised his head and looked directly at her. He smiled, gave a slight bow and kept on looking at her as the Mar\x{e9}chal\x{2019}s cort\x{e8}ge reached the spot where she and Henri stood. He had not looked at, or acknowledged, her husband and she, for her part, was so transfixed by his gaze that in the moment of being presented to the Governor-General she almost forgot to curtsy. Randon, for his part, bowed in her direction and then, almost theatrically, made a sort of reverence in greeting her husband. Lambert, ever the actor, received this false tribute with a certain solemn dignity, befitting his role of marabout. The Governor-General then passed on down the receiving line, pausing to speak to an old sheikh and to three high-turbaned holy men who had been pointed out earlier as revered marabouts of the Algerine plain. A military band struck up a triumphal march as the Governor\x{2019}s cort\x{e8}ge made a leisurely circle of the colonnaded court. At this point Deniau was lost to Emmeline\x{2019}s view behind the plumes of water rising from the central fountain. She stood, impatient, as aides-de-camp brought up various sheikhs to exchange greetings with her husband and, as soon as the presentations ended, hurried across the courtyard, pretending to look for someone, but in reality moving directly to the spot where Deniau stood chatting to an imposing figure who was wearing a richly embroidered waistcoat and a red fez.",

Emmeline, who had spent most of the morning preparing herself for this luncheon, now ran out on to her balcony, hoping to catch a glimpse of these Muslim devotions. But as she stood searching the adjoining rooftops the maid assigned to her quarters came to tell her that a messenger from Colonel Deniau was waiting at the main gates of the residence. When she went down through the central courtyard past the Zouave sentries who saluted her as they held open the gates she saw, standing in the street outside, a Negro, so tall he was almost a giant, his ashen grey skin giving him the look of a corpse. He wore an orange burnous and a red fez, and was holding the reins of a small mule which had been fitted with a sidesaddle. On seeing her he bowed and knelt, cupping his hands in a stirrup with which he lifted her lightly on to the saddle. He then took the reins and guided the mule, walking beside her as they moved along the dark narrow street which wound uphill under stone archways and overhanging balconies that completely shut out the hot <<noonday|13>> sun. This street, like a turn in a maze, led to yet another dark narrow lane and then another and as they progressed the ascent became steeper, the mule carefully picking its way, guided by the black giant who, when the animal hesitated, slapped its flanks with the flat of his huge hand, the palm of which was white as a lady\x{2019}s glove. In these narrow lanes when Arab pedestrians came towards them, the presence of the mule forced them to take refuge in a doorway or turn sideways as they eased past. But apart from these passersby the city seemed empty of people. The fa\x{e7}ades of the buildings were uniformly plain, their infrequent windows small, grated holes which gave no view of the interiors. And yet, as her ear became attuned to the jumble of sounds, Emmeline heard, behind these fa\x{e7}ades, the murmur of female voices, the cries of children and, once, the disconsolate braying of an ass.",

Fanning themselves in the <<noonday|13>> heat, the congregation made up of diplomatic representatives, the Prefect and his staff, the leading French, German and Syrian merchants, French army officers, nuns and priests from the diocese\x{2019}s convents and seminaries, waited for the Mass to begin. In this former mosque, columns fifty feet high supported the cupola which was lit from above by stained-glass windows.

Yet above this painting in prominent relief was a series of ornate, interlaced sentences from the Koran which had not been erased despite the fact that they proclaimed in Arabic that there is only one God and Muhammad is his prophet. Even stranger than this juxtaposition was the Mass itself. As priests and acolytes filed out on to the altar the gay martial music continued. Ranks of soldiers in full regimentals stood before the tabernacle and as the service got under way and the sacramental bell rang to announce the miracle of transubstantiation, the noise of twenty drums thundered under the cupola.

            "Next morning as their caravan set out, the sun rose like a threat in the pale dawn sky. The road Deniau had spoken of was a trackless desert landscape with no sign of other travellers. Against the red background of the desert soil neutral shades stood out: their servants\x{2019} ochre clothing, the rust and beige of the camels\x{2019} hides, the black and brown coats of the horses; all of these dull colourings seeming to intensify the growing heat. Within two hours the sun became a punishment. She felt her hair grow wet. Rivulets of sweat trickled down between her breasts as she spurred her horse, moving ahead of Deniau, unwilling to let him see her heated face and disarrayed coiffure. <<Towards midday|13>> the desert\x{2019}s rolling dunes changed to a series of steep ravines where her horse slithered and stumbled in a near vertical descent, threatening to tumble her on to the ground. <<Shortly after noon|13>> Deniau halted the caravan, the servants quickly erecting a goatskin lean-to, under which they laid out a frugal meal of dates, ewe\x{2019}s milk and bread. Emmeline retired behind this shelter attempting with soap and a basin of water to make a hasty toilette before sitting down on the carpet where the meal was served. She heard Deniau tell her husband that they would lodge that evening in the house of a sheikh named Ben-Gannah where they would be served a proper meal. \x{2018}Tomorrow we will travel on a less demanding road. The worst part of the journey is over.\x{2019}",

            "Deniau came down into the courtyard, <<shortly before four|9e>>, watching as Lambert rehearsed his and Emmeline\x{2019}s performance, for the eighth time. When Lambert had finished Deniau applauded, then vaulted on to the stage and kissed Emmeline\x{2019}s hand, congratulating her. \x{2018}Wonderful! No magician in history has had so beautiful a foil. And now I want to ask one last favour of you, dear Madame. As Bou-Aziz has already arrived, we are planning a dinner for him this evening and we very much hope you will attend.\x{2019}",
