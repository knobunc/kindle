Floating forward in this manner the vast sidewalk below of lightning-shaped cracks and flat, adhered pebbles, receded, section by section, into my past; in the dim light the many black islands of spent gum, various in size and shape but consistent in frequency, seemed like so many portals to null space. And at the Ptolemaic center lay a steaming lump of rags that only suggested humanity. For out of that amorphous shape emerged two leg-like structures ending in dull orange Chuck Taylors, one of which had been purposely ripped open near the ankle to expose a gapingly open sore that wetly reflected streetlamp light. But wait, maybe his entire body was an open sore and the circle I was staring at the only healthy patch. I looked away. Just before the cab was a round, waist-high kid dressed from chubby head to toe in aggressive pink and testing the limits of acceptable distance from the only nearby woman emitting any maternal air. He stared back at me as if I owed him money and sang distractedly in a troubling falsetto. He sang: \x{a0}You\x{2019}ve got to accen\x{2014}tuate the positive, eli\x{2014}minate the negative .\x{a0}.\x{a0}.  and wasn\x{2019}t it like <<one in the morning|5>> on a Thursday night?

Just to see everything through that prism again you know? A happy youth I must have had overall. Or was I miserable but with a poor memory? Oh whatever. Remember that old record player in the lime green case, the one with the detachable knobs? I saw it in the garage the other day. In the garage Casi! I put it on and it worked. I mean I didn\x{2019}t have any records to really test it but it was spinning and that was amazing enough for me. I remember the oldsters would start in with the endless clave patterns and you and I would reach for that thing in protest. Then up to your room for a little Reader\x{2019}s Digest Edition of the LVB piano sonatas, remember thinking RD was like good? And remember we would limit ourselves to the pre-Heiligenstadt Testament ones to exclude our runaway favorite, the cataclysmic Appasionata, with you being definitely partial to the Opus 28 Pastorale because it was supposedly after this one that he told Krumholz he would be taking a new path and me arguing that those kinds of ancillary matters were not fairly considerable and that sometimes, just occasionally, overwhelming popularity is warranted and that the second 27, The Moonlight, with its initial melancholia was the greater work? Remember that? Well if you listen to them now I bet you\x{2019}ll be sent up to that room whether you\x{2019}re willing or not. And if you listen the right way then you\x{2019}re forced to actually be that person. Isn\x{2019}t that just the height of weirdness?

Well one thing we know about them is they don\x{2019}t have any money. We know this first of all because we\x{2019}re their attorneys. It\x{2019}s hard to imagine any group of people being held in less esteem than we are by our clients. The overwhelming majority of them feel that we are either bumbling incompetents\x{2014}after all if we\x{2019}re otherwise why aren\x{2019}t we in private practice making real money?\x{2014}or, even worse, actively conspiring with the DA against them as evidenced by the fact that we know and appear to act friendly towards a lot of these people who are prosecuting them. Throw in that we are employed, at least in their eyes, by the same government. We also know that people tend to greatly overestimate the efficacy of private attorneys. Now despite these time-honored perceptions, I find that I have no shortage of drug clients and that other attorneys, who I\x{2019}m sure inspire far less confidence than I do, also have an abundance of drug cases. What this means is that these people, who were arrested for participating in the drug trade and who presumably profit from what is unquestionably a highly lucrative industry, are unable to scrounge up enough money to hire an attorney in a city that has more attorneys than mosquitoes, and this is the case even though they firmly believe their failure to do so will result in them going to prison for long stretches. Throw in the added fact that a substantial majority of this same population is being held in jail on bail the equivalent of which I spend in assorted bars in a typical week. Really though I only say all this in the interests of being thorough since we don\x{2019}t really need this recitation of facts to tell us that the majority of these defendants are indigent right? Seeing is believing and we can see that these people are primarily toothless drug addicts or twerpy teens who think they\x{2019}re being hard and ultimately these are the people that are getting sent upstate and who the police are cracking down on. So what do you say about this situation Casi?

            "\x{201c}When I was an intern in Brooklyn I second sat a case where our client was a last-minute lookout for an impromptu robbery committed by two other girls. She was a toothless prostitute with tracks on her arms, a predicate for a Hurd-type sale, and the nicest damaged person you could ever meet. The two codefendants pled and the case against our girl was weak. She was out after a 30.30 release and she would come to court in skirts that looked like belts. At trial, they had shit too until in saunters one of the fucking co-defendants to testify and blow our girl out of the fucking water. Bear in mind that this witness was the reason our client was on trial in the first place. The robbery had been completely instigated by this woman and she was the one who threatened the complainants with a razor. Of course she wasn\x{2019}t a predicate and thanks to her cooperation she ultimately got something like a flat year. At sentencing, our client, who during the robbery had essentially stood around looking up and down the street and imploring her friends to hurry up, got the minimum which was goddamn eight. When the verdict came in her husband was in the audience. What hurt most was that as the court officers were putting her in for what would be, at best, eight years her husband was up at the rail trying to get some last words in. I don\x{2019}t know why and I\x{2019}ll never forget this but all he kept asking her was whether she wanted the newspaper he was carrying. Like all insistent too.

According to the complainant, he had just checked on the van ten minutes before coming upon the defendant. Therefore, adjusting for the time it takes to break into the van, the evidence strongly suggests that the defendant did not spend a great deal of time in the presence of the van before breaking in. The majority of vans are not used by businesses for commercial purposes so a person is justified in believing that a van they are breaking into belongs to this non-commercial majority. The People must overcome that presumption with proof that the defendant knew the vehicle was used to conduct business therein and they have failed to do so. Accordingly, the case should be dismissed.

The key to the trunk was previously mailed to Escalera from Freddy. In return Escalera used a mailing service to mail Freddy a garage door opener that opens the garage to 410 and a key. Presumably, Freddy then turned around and mailed the opener to his mule here. Next Wednesday morning the mule will drive the Nova, with the locked Tansu in the trunk of the car, to 410. She will use the garage door opener to open the door and enter the garage at exactly <<3:00 a.m.|2a>> She cannot be late.

            "Then the room was suddenly bathed in a surreal silence and the reason for that was the people depicted on the screen. Those people appeared to not know what to do next. There seemed to be no one there who was in charge. Someone like a mayor is never really in charge in a situation like that and that was evident from the way he looked around waiting for instruction. Our silence persisted with neither of us thinking of moving or otherwise disturbing it. Then, at the exact moment that Angus\x{2019}s triangle changed its numbers to <<6:08|2>>, the mayor acknowledged some unseen person with his chin, rose from the row of folding chairs that had been carefully arranged on a stage to face a quiet invited audience, and walked to the podium. The podium bowed under the weight of its multi-microphone hat; each microphone clearly identified by its owner while vying to hear the mayor best. Toad spoke, haltingly at first but then with growing confidence when a Television with a built-in VCR (or was that a built-in Carousel?) was wheeled into the room and rushed to his side. The mayor spoke with what he thought was the appropriate solemnity. He pointed toward the people he had just sat with, one of whom was identified as a Video Vigilantes bigwig by the crawl at the bottom of the screen, and clapped his hands without sound. Then he held up an odd-looking tubular device as a foreign head suddenly appeared behind the microphones to inform the invisible audience that there would be no questions until the footage had been completely aired. This new guy thanked The Post and in response the camera cut back to the row of chairs. There one of the guys nodded gravely while the previously helpful crawl stood mute. The mayor was at Television now where he proceeded to insert his tube. The whole event had such a high-tech sheen to it that I was surprised by the third-rate letters that appeared on the screen to announce we would soon be viewing The Tula Kidnapping Etc. and that the so-titled footage was A Video Vigilantes Production. What next appeared on the screen in no way resembled a dispassionate frills-lacking recording though. Instead we saw an active camera zooming in and out and panning from side to side. Different angles were tried and rejected. Black and white rejected in favor of color and various filters used before settling on a slightly blue one. Those preliminary matters determined, the picture revealed a green, old-fashioned baby stroller appearing from the left of the screen as the audience gasped. Now the people on the stage seemed to bend toward their screen as across from them Angus did the same. I wished I had left.",
