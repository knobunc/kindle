The spars branched and merged randomly, forming a wooden cytoskeleton of pleasing complexity. Here and there the spars bulged sufficiently to accommodate enclosed spaces, hollows that glowed with pastel lantern-light. Elsewhere, a cobweb of smaller strands provided a structural mesh to which most of the greenery was anchored. The whole assemblage was festooned with irrigation pipes and nutrient feedlines, threading back into the support machinery lurking at the very heart of the core. Sun lamps studded the membrane at irregular intervals, and were distributed throughout the green masses themselves. Now they shone with the hard blue light of <<high noon|13>>, but as the day progressed \x{2014} they were slaved to twenty-six-hour Yellowstone time \x{2014} the lamps would slide down through the spectrum towards the bronze and russet reds of evening.",

The largest shuttle can move five hundred people into orbit, where they can transfer to an in-system craft with a capacity about four times that. That means we\x{2019}ll need to make four hundred surface-to-orbit flights. The in-system ship will need to make about one hundred round trips to Volyova\x{2019}s ship. That\x{2019}s the real bottleneck, though \x{2014} each of those round trips will take at least thirty hours, and that\x{2019}s assuming almost zero time for loading and unloading at either end. Better assume forty hours to be on the safe side. That means we\x{2019}re looking at nearly six standard months. We can shave some time off that by pressing another surface-to-orbit ship into service, but we\x{2019}ll be doing very well if we get it much below five months. And that, of course, is assuming that we can have two thousand people ready and waiting to be moved off Resurgam every forty hours\x{2026}\x{2019} Vuilleumier smiled.
