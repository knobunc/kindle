The King\x{2019}s Bench, the nearby Marshalsea, and the Fleet were different from most London prisons. They were very old, for a start, and were privately run according to a set of very strange rituals. They had been instituted for a sole purpose\x{2014}the holding, for as long as necessary, of men and women who could not or would not pay their bills. These three institutions were debtors\x{2019} prisons\x{2014}and the reason that crowds formed around their entrances each sunrise is that, every morning just after dawn, it was the policy of their wardens to free those inmates who had discharged their obligations.",
