community into existence: \x{201c}There was no thought, let alone premonition, of
founding a company, avocation or industry in 1952 when I sat down in an
apartment in Catonsville, Maryland, to design what ultimately became known as Tactics\x{a0}(1954), the first modern board wargame.\x{201d} [6]
His motivation for designing a military game was simply to acquaint himself
with the mechanics of war, since, as an American reservist in the early 1950s, Roberts\x{a0}faced the prospect of a tour of duty. When it transpired that the Korean\x{a0}police action did not require his services, and he consequently found himself with a
serendipitous opening in his schedule, he decided to market his game to the
general public rather than see his creation go to waste. From 1954 to 1957, roughly
2,000 copies of Tactics were sold at \$4.95 each, by mail order, under
the imprint of the \x{201c}Avalon Game Company,\x{201d} mostly through the catalogs of Stackpole
Books. [7]
The box cover bore the legend \x{201c}... the new, realistic land army war game!\x{201d} To

the market forty years later, they too reflected a rosier past. The nature of
warfare fundamentally changed in 1945 when the United States employed atomic
weapons\x{a0}against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Avalon Hill\x{2019}s most successful titles in the 1960s\x{2014}games like Stalingrad, Afrika Korps, Battle of the Bulge, D-Day\x{2014}emphasized conventional military actions\x{a0}in World War II in the European theater, all of them Allied victories (or at least Axis losses).

American teenagers of that era, how could the heavy cavalry actions in 1940s
North Africa not serve as a comforting fantasy of warfare, like the quaint
Napoleonic adventures of Little Wars were to Wells? Perhaps wargaming

this theme has a great deal of resonance. Eddaic literature constantly
references the threat of Ragnar\x{f6}k, a battle that will bring about the
end of the world. While forces massing for a world-shattering confrontation
recur in many ancient religions\x{2014}notably in the Christian battle of Armageddon
foretold in Revelation (<<16:14|2>>\x{2013}16)\x{2014}the Norse account of Ragnar\x{f6}k supplies
a list of various fantastic participants in the final showdown. The Gylfaginning\x{a0}(51), which quotes liberally from the V\x{f6}lusp\x{e1}, describes the assault
on Asgard led by the fiery sons of M\x{fa}spell, the Midgard Serpent, the
Fenris Wolf, Loki and the frost giants. On the opposing side are the \x{c6}sir, the
Norse gods, including Odin, Thor and Frey. We know that Odin dispatches valkyries
to recruit the spirits of valiant warriors killed in battle for his V\x{e4}lholl,
where men daily practice their martial skills, so that these men can assist the
\x{c6}sir when Ragnar\x{f6}k\x{a0}comes\x{2014}even though the outcome of the battle
has been foreordained. As the battle-lines are drawn by the Eddas, we can see
the prototype for a delineation of fantastic creatures and people into two
camps. Although the V\x{f6}lusp\x{e1} mentions both the elves and the dwarves\x{a0}in connection with Ragnar\x{f6}k, it assigns them no particular role in the upcoming battle. Giants
are fated to oppose the \x{c6}sir at Ragnar\x{f6}k, but in some Eddaic stories
giants and gods cooperate and even intermarry. The vague allegiances of these
beings are not clarified in later folktales either. The elves of Sir Orfeo, for example, are ominous kidnappers, and the various beliefs in elf-shot imply antagonism
towards humans; the fairy tradition, however, furnishes lighter-hearted elves,
like \x{201c}every elf and fairy sprite\x{201d} in the Midsummer Night\x{2019}s Dream. In the fairy tales collected by Grimm, we see dwarves who are benevolent (Grimm #53) and malign

            "While the consequences for spiritual classes
like the Cleric are clear, it is less obvious in the original rules how
alignment matters to the Fighting-man or the Magic-user. If a character dies
and is restored to life with the spell \x{201c}Reincarnation,\x{201d} they will return as a creature of the same alignment (a Lawful character might return as a hippogriff, a Chaotic character as a manticore). This is however a fairly remote contingency.
The larger question is the relationship of alignment to the traditional
wargaming concept of \x{201c}sides,\x{201d} and the meaning of sides in the context of Dungeons
& Dragons. While in Chainmail, players command forces on opposing sides of a battlefield, in Dungeons & Dragons the
players are, for the most part, on the same \x{201c}side,\x{201d} in a common opposition to
forces lurking in dungeons and other places of adventure. The notion that
player characters form a cooperative \x{201c}party\x{201d} has an important interaction with
alignment, and more or less replaces the previous notion in Chainmail of
a game where competing players representing good and evil battle for supremacy.
As Section <<1.10|5a:0>> previously noted, this remained the situation of the Blackmoor\x{a0}campaign in the fall of 1972, where the \x{201c}Blackmoor Bunch,\x{201d} nominally the forces
of Law, continued their struggle against the \x{201c}Baddies\x{201d} who had decisively won
the prior Blackmoor campaign. When Arneson demonstrated the game to Gygax at
around that time, the Twin Cities characters had left behind the dungeons of
Blackmoor Castle for exile in Loch Gloomen;\x{a0}the forces in the dungeon, though nominally remnants of the forces of Fred Funk (who played the King of the Orcs) and other
\x{201c}Baddies,\x{201d} were de jure non-player characters, as were the elves who
took custody of Blackmoor Castle after the bungling of the Lawful crew. Gygax
also saw Megarry\x{2019}s\x{a0}prototype of DUNGEON!\x{a0}at this time, a game
where player characters do not fight one another directly, but compete to amass
as much wealth as possible by slaying monsters in the dungeon and taking their
treasure. The idea that denizens of the dungeon were under referee control, and
that player characters had an incentive to slay those antagonists, certainly
informed the concept of a collaborative party that appears in Dungeons &

directly the miniature wargame Chainmail, but since Dungeons &

            "The history of wargaming that follows is divided
into five subsections. After exploring how chess finally settled into its
familiar system in the sixteenth century, we discover in 3.1.1 that the
earliest German authors on chess promoted the game as a way to educate leaders
about war and statecraft. While numerous eighteenth-century variants rendered chess
less abstract and more like a modern battlefield, the seminal work of Hellwig
(3.1.2) of Braunschweig (better known in English as Brunswick) first rethought board
games from the ground up as tools for simulating warfare. Hellwig\x{2019}s ambitions
were however impeded by vestigial elements of chess in his design. It was not
until the work of the Reiswitz family (3.1.3) in the 1820s that wargaming freed
itself from the abstractions of boards and figurines, as well as primitive
conflict resolution mechanisms\x{2014}these gave way to mathematical principles of
probability that decided game events. The Reiswitzian kriegsspiel tradition
(3.1.4) dominated thinking about wargames for a full half-century, <<before two|9:0>>
distinct reactions finally overthrew it: one that found its burgeoning
complexity an obstacle to military instruction, the other that reinvented
wargaming as purely a form of entertainment for hobbyists. The latter reaction intersected
with the producers and collectors of model soldiers (3.1.5) in the seminal
games of Robert Louis Stevenson and H. G. Wells; the former, however, persisted
in a military wargaming tradition (3.1.6) in the English-speaking world that
grew in importance between the World Wars. Eventually, these diverse influences
gave rise to political wargames (of which Diplomacy is a prominent
example, as Chapter Four will show) and the tactical board wargaming tradition
(3.1.7).",

            "The nature of the board\x{a0}itself is among the most
influential of Hellwig\x{2019}s inventions. His board is a large grid, but unlike the
abstract two-tone setting of the chessboard, each square in his grid contains
one of a set of terrain\x{a0}types, coded by color. White signified ordinary ground,
but the more interesting varieties included mountain (red), swamp (green) and
water (blue) squares. Special terrain might impose restrictions on unit
movement or confer combat advantages; mountains, for example, are completely
impassible, and crossing a river requires the deployment of a special pontoon
unit. Cities, villages and even various fortifications can rise and fall on these
squares during the course of gameplay. At the start of the game, the available
territory is typically divided between the two players by an explicit border,
and players are free to distribute their forces throughout their territory
provided that all their units begin more than one turn\x{2019}s march away from the
border\x{2014}quite a departure from the assigned seating of chess pieces. Hellwig
furthermore prescribes no particular size for his board; while he notes that he \x{201c}usually\x{201d} employs a rectangular board\x{a0}of 49 ranks by 33 files (yielding 1,617
squares total), and in fact offers a board of those dimensions for sale with a
fixed arrangement of terrain types, this is only the simplest of several layouts
for his board. [346]
Even in his earliest edition, he encouraged experimentation and customization
of the board to fit the needs of players. In the back of his 1782 expansion
(which mostly runs through the moves of a demonstration game), he proposed a
configurable \x{201c}board\x{201d} built from 2,000 six-sided cubes, which displayed a
different terrain\x{a0}type on each face, all of which could be rotated
independently and then ordered into a grid\x{a0}and arranged to form completely
arbitrary battlefields at the discretion of players; by <<1803|9n:0>>, he offered such
an apparatus for sale in lieu of a board for the considerable sum\x{a0}of ten Pistolen, a gold coin of the era. [347]
If 2,000 squares of terrain did not suit a particular customer, Hellwig happily
sold smaller or larger configurable battlefields. His game thus allowed players
to approximate real or fictional territories as desired for any given battle
scenario. By 1782, Hellwig had already received notice of players recreating\x{a0}with his game the Battle of Krefeld (1758), an important encounter in the Seven
Years\x{2019} War\x{a0}in which the Brunswickers did notable service.",

on the resolution level of the map. The Cassini family\x{2019}s map, for example, had
a scale of 1:86,400. Although Venturini replaced the wargame board with a map,
he still imposed a one-inch square grid over that map, and he imagined each
square of the grid to be two thousand paces (Schritte) across, which if
we assume a German military pace of rough thirty inches, means his game employs
a scale <<around 1:60|2>>,000, or a bit shy of one mile per square. The size of map
was of less importance to Venturini than its scale; he felt any map sized
between five feet by three feet (2,160 squares, or 60 ranks by 36 files) and
eight feet by six feet (6,912 squares, or 96 ranks by 72 files) would be
equally suitable for his game. [356] Venturini includes a full-color map of that
smaller size in the back of his book, as well as a tinier tactical map (36 by
24, or 865 squares) that shows rivers, fortresses, bridges and similar terrain\x{a0}features. The ability to map his game

            "The release of Venturini in 1797, along with the
revision of Hellwig in 1803, inspired a wave of kriegsspiel publications
in Germany, Austria, Italy, France and England over the next twenty years. One
author of the era, Georg Emmanuel Opiz, claimed that his father Johann Ferdinand
Opiz (1741\x{2013}1812), a former Jesuit and a well-known writer of his time, had
actually invented kriegsspiel\x{a0}sometime <<around 1760|18:1>>, though the Opiz game did not see print until <<1806|9c:0>>, when kriegsspiel deriving from
Hellwig already enjoyed widespread acclaim. [358]
By 1804, Hellwig appeared in French, no doubt prompting le Comte de Firmas-P\x{e9}ri\x{e9}s
to produce his very Hellwig-inspired Le jeu de Strat\x{e9}gie, ou les \x{e9}ches
militaires in 1808. In Italy, Francesco Giacometti\x{a0}circulated his Nuovo Giuoco di Scacchi, ossia il Giuoco della Guerra first in an Italian
edition in 1793, and then, given certain changes in the political situation of
Italy, in a French-language edition of 1801, Nouveau jeu des \x{e9}ches ou jeu de
la Guerre. Major J. J. von Gl\x{f6}den in 1817 issued a German-language kriegsspiel,
as did Johann Gottlieb Perkuhn that same year. Some openly
acknowledged their debt to Hellwig, like the Zus\x{e4}tze zu den Regeln des
Hellwigschen Kriegsspiel und Ver\x{e4}nderung dieser Regeln (1818). No
less than fifteen European authors had weighed in on wargaming before the first
quarter of the nineteenth century had passed. While the great interest in wars
and gaming owes a real debt to Hellwig\x{2019}s landmark inspiration, it perhaps owes
still more to the extremely volatile military situation in Europe at the time. Kriegsspiel
was birthed by Germans, and significantly, came into its celebrity in an
hour in which the Germanic people\x{2019}s militaries had suffered crushing defeats
before the armies of the French Empire of Napoleon\x{a0}Bonaparte.",

arc shots. Therefore, if firing against an infantry line at 1,500 paces, even

            "Scharnhorst\x{a0}further elaborates the variations in the probability (Wahrscheinlichkeit) of scoring a hit when the size
of the target wall is altered, and is particularly fond of establishing through
empirical examination a range of variance in expected strikes. When, as we
noted above, the younger Reiswitz says of firepower that \x{201c}the results achieved
can differ considerably, even when circumstances are the same,\x{201d} he practically
paraphrases the name of one of the sections in Wirkung die Feuergewehrs
(S25, Die Verschiedenheit der Wirkungen bei gleichen Umst\x{e4}nden). [387] The conclusions
Scharnhorst\x{a0}draws from this data are of immediate use to commanders: he advises
on how to adjust the elevation of cannons in the face of advancing troops, the
ideal amount of gunpowder to be used in various circumstances and the relative
quality of the rifles\x{a0}issued by the major European powers. It is less the
conclusions than the data itself that would inspire the Reiswitz family,
however. A year before Scharnhorst\x{2019}s book came out, the elder Reiswitz provided
his own statistics to describe the effects of gunfire, but only in a very
anecdotal and deterministic fashion: one hundred troops, he reckons, can fire
four hundred shots in a minute, but only a twelfth of those shots will hit at
three hundred paces, whereas an eighth will hit at two hundred paces. These translated
directly into the consequences of infantry fire in his wargame, which provided
loss markers with fractions like one eighth that one could set on a damaged
game piece after fire. The younger Reiswitz a decade later extracted from Scharnhorst\x{2019}s
compilation the cumulative effect of artillery bombardment, or small arms fire,
for given intervals of time, along with the effects of terrain, the minimum and
maximum effective range of guns and the decline in performance over increasing
distances. [388]
Scharnhorst\x{a0}mostly provides this quantitative information in charts displaying
his raw experimental data, from which the probability of the success of a
particular use of firearms must be inferred. In some cases Scharnhorst\x{a0}even gives direct odds; for example, in describing the behavior of a gun\x{a0}he says, \x{201c}The hitting of rifles and smooth-bore guns against the target at <<200|3:1>> paces behaves as <<2 to 1|10a:1>>, at

            "Two years later in 1875, Meckel\x{a0}published his proposed reinterpretation of wargaming (Anleitung zum Kriegsspiel), which notably
considered martial activities on three distinct scales: a \x{201c}detachment\x{201d} game at
a map scale\x{a0}of 1:6,250 which emphasized the study of minute tactical details, a
\x{201c}grand war game\x{201d} at a scale of <<1:12|2>>,500 governing the larger movements of
forces, and finally a \x{201c}strategic\x{201d} game at the massive scale of 1:100,000. It is
the 1:6,250 detailed tactical maps that borrow his name, the \x{201c}Meckel\x{a0}maps,\x{201d} for which he is largely remembered: he emphasizes that the maps should depict in
sufficient detail such terrain\x{a0}features as rivers and villages that the
tactical benefits of stationing troops in these locations will be clear from
the map. His greatest contribution to the future development of wargaming,
however, is the idea that a single action might be considered at several scales,
and thus effectively in several modes. For example, there might be a
strategic-level map showing the breadth of an entire campaign on which opposing
commanders maneuver their armies into place; when those forces meet, they would
be resituated on a more detailed, tactical-level map where subordinate
commanders would direct a battle with only general guidance from above. This
two-mode approach to wargaming\x{a0}is a feature of many later games, including the
campaign games of Scruby, Bath, Gygax and Arneson. The simplification Meckel\x{a0}hoped to inspire, however, failed to manifest\x{2014}for all his protestations about the
needless difficulty of managing quantified fire effects, Meckel\x{2019}s wargame still endorses the use of dice and the computation of losses\x{a0}for tactical games played out at this scale.",

result of several years of private study, unassisted by reference to any
foreign code until it had become a finished system\x{201d} is, however, a somewhat
less credible claim. [413]
The debt that his Advanced Game owes to the Reiswitzian\x{a0}tradition would be obvious to any cursory reader. The referee\x{2014}yes, Totten calls the administrator of the game a \x{201c}referee\x{201d}

course), the player-commanders and their subordinates submit their orders\x{a0}in writing, and turns\x{a0}represent a five-minute interval of game time (a slight expansion of
Reiswitz\x{2019}s two minutes). Topographic maps\x{a0}(at a scale\x{a0}somewhere between 1:6,000
and <<1:12|2>>,000) are recommended for play, ideally with three map instances used
simultaneously: one maintained as the secret master copy of the referee marking
the authoritative position of all units, and one for each of the two contending
sides showing only their perspective on the battlefield. The game pieces in
play are wooden blocks scaled to the size that formations would assume on the
map. When combat or other circumstances requiring judgment arise, the referee
first calculates the \x{201c}ratios of possibility\x{201d} from the magnitude of the involved
forces and the tactical situation, and dice resolve the conflict. Victory\x{a0}is incidental to the game and largely undefined; the general idea dictates the circumstances
of battle, and the players themselves are left to understand when it is
appropriate to withdraw from contention. Totten would not have needed \x{201c}reference\x{201d}
to any foreign system to assimilate these ideas, which were more than fifty
years old and circulated through many channels among students of military
science long before the kriegsspiel vogue brought actual translations to

by any particular, it is that Totten shows a tendency toward exactly the faults
that Meckel\x{a0}and Verdy du Vernois\x{a0}hoped to eradicate: the proliferation of rules
and tables. Most of the rules of the Advanced Game are committed to a set of
tables lettered A through W. His Table I, for example, lists some thirty-six exceptional
situations which might arise in a wargame, with the corresponding probabilities
and the canned result of a successful roll\x{2014}surely derived in form and content
from the \x{201c}Special Circumstances\x{201d} tables in Baring\x{2019}s translation of Tschischwitz. Some seem almost laughably overspecified: for example, No. 15, \x{201c}Artillery fire
unanswered, if heavy, may a bridge be constructed under it?\x{201d} (2:1 odds in favor
of no). Or after a battery sets fire to a wooden building, consider No. 27, \x{201c}The
fire, having taken and 5 minutes having elapsed, has it spread?\x{201d} (again, a 2:1
chance that it has). Table R shows the many \x{201c}multipliers\x{201d} applied to the
calculation of losses\x{a0}(points of damage) due to any number of tactical circumstances: natural or manmade cover, slopes in the ground, morale of troops, quality of weapons, beneficial formations,
ad nauseam\x{2014}Table R lists no less than 147 numbered \x{201c}Cases\x{201d} that might
prevail. In an example Totten gives where the dice indicate thirteen men in an
artillery brigade would have been affected by gunfire\x{a0}skirmishes, he then shows how to apply modifiers: \x{201c}The several multipliers that affect the result are
given in Cases 9, 16, 54 and 62. These modifiers are respectively 1/15, 7/8,
2/1, and 5/1; hence, by the above rule, we have 1/15 x 7/8 x 2/1 x 5/1 = 7/12,
and 7/<<12 of 13|10>> = 7 7/12, say, 8 men, or about 1 \x{2018}killed\x{2019} and 7 \x{2018}wounded.\x{201d} [414] The prospect for
a referee of sifting through these Cases for applicable instances and
multiplying the resulting cluster of fractions whenever combat occurs is
nothing less than nightmarish. These are precisely the sort of rules that
Meckel and Verdy du Vernois abhorred, stipulations that are seemingly ignorant
of the enormous gulf between their narrowness and the great breadth of
circumstances likely to arise in a practical game, to say nothing of their
sheer impracticability.",

exciting and quickest method is to fire by throwing with the hand,\x{201d} and
suggests that \x{201c}large dried butter beans\x{201d} might serve well for this purpose. The
4.7, however, offers \x{201c}a very realistic\x{a0}method of firing.\x{201d} Following Stevenson,
the Great War Game\x{a0}does require troops to pull along the ammunition\x{a0}for the guns in carts. The game has a relatively simple movement system:
infantry may move six inches per turn, cavalry twelve inches. Anticipating
later developments, the Great War Game recommends that during larger
actions entire companies might be moved at once on a \x{201c}board\x{201d} or tray. As with Stevenson, the combat system for artillery is more clear than for the other
branches, though the text does refer to \x{201c}infantry fire\x{201d} as well as \x{201c}artillery
fire,\x{201d} and suggests using a smaller projectile for the former, such as \x{201c}hand
dried peas.\x{201d} Regardless of the size of the missile, loss of balance due to
physical blows forms the basis of all miniature damage. A miniature that is
only partially upset, left leaning against a comrade for example, is considered
wounded, and may be dragged to a field hospital where it has an even chance of
surviving and returning later to the battle. [437]
If two forces collide on the battlefield, presumably after all of the dried
peas on hand have been launched, a larger force can surround, subdue and
imprison\x{a0}a force half its size. Prisoners must be escorted off the field under
guard, and may be rescued by their companions, though to rearm themselves liberated
captives must return to the base camp and baggage. They might also be exchanged

Europe still lived in the shadow of the Great War. While Germany languished

hardly less dire. Given the persistence of antiwar sentiment, the market for
military-themed diversions needed significant time to recover. It would not be

Britains released its first depiction of the German combatants in that war,

of English miniature wargaming had already entered the hobby. Captain J. C.
Sachs, who became associated with Gottstein\x{2019}s cabal in September 1935 and
eventually served as a Lifetime Vice-President of the Society, initiated a
wargaming \x{201c}Tactical Cup Challenge\x{201d} within the BMSS\x{a0}as of 1939, a tournament\x{a0}which he ran yearly under his own personal miniature wargaming\x{a0}rules.

machine guns, tanks, trenches, pillboxes, barbed wire and even aviation. The
core system borrowed liberally from Wells: artillery fire is still simulated
with mechanical breechloading spring cannons, and that artillery makes four
shots per turn, for example. The rates of movement\x{a0}halved Little Wars at six inches for infantry and a foot for cavalry. Melee combat\x{a0}is slightly less deadly: when equal forces meet, only half the troops on each side are
eliminated, and for unequal forces, the amount of the inequality is the initial
number of troops deducted from the losing side, though each side then

            "Equally revolutionary in Sachs was the notion
that infantry might actually discharge their rifles\x{a0}as firearms rather than merely lunging with them as bayonets per Wells\x{2019}s troops. Rifles and machine guns\x{a0}have a range of twelve inches, though their effect is partially determined by another concept Sachs
reinvented from the antiquity of wargaming, this time from Hellwig: the
direction that guns are facing. In attempting to approach a company of
riflemen, a body of troops will take firing damage that gets worse as they get
closer. Sachs applied to the base number of riflemen several modifiers and
multipliers to the intensity of fire, which results in a number called the \x{201c}firing
strength\x{201d}\x{2014}as opposed to the \x{201c}actual strength,\x{201d} the raw number of riflemen. If
riflemen are facing the approaching force, their firing strength is a quarter
stronger than their regular strength (for example, a force of 13 men has a
firing strength of 16); where if the riflemen are entrenched, meaning they
remain in the same place for more than six turns, their firing strength\x{a0}is double their actual strength. Flanking\x{a0}maneuvers that approach a body of troops from a
side or behind similarly reduce the firing strength of the defenders to only
those troops that can turn and face the aggressors. This firing strength then
determines losses among the approaching force: one attacker is killed for every
four points of firing strength at the range of 12\x{201d} to 6\x{201d}, but from <<6|9c:0>>\x{201d} to melee
fire is more intense, and one attacker is killed for every three points\x{a0}of firing strength. [451]
Once the approaching force reaches the riflemen, all notion of firing strength
is discarded, however, and combat is adjudicated as a melee above. The very
notion of quantifying firing strength as something abstract that admits of
mathematical modifiers is a huge advance over Wells (though something
anticipated by Hellwig), and is a clear step toward the Avalon Hill concept of
a quantified \x{201c}combat factor\x{201d} representing the strength of troops in later
wargames.",

            "Tactics can thus be seen as something of
a fusion of Hellwig\x{2019}s board mechanics and Reiswitzian combat, varying more
through simplification than elaboration. In its original 1954 incarnation,
however, Tactics lacked some of the mature features that formed the core
of the Avalon Hill system, and as subsequent games acquired them, they only
came more to resemble the work of Hellwig\x{a0}and Venturini. The unusual Tactics movement mechanism, with a budget of thirty squares of movement divided
across all units, was replaced in the 1958 Tactics II with a much
simpler \x{201c}movement factor\x{201d} (MF), a maximum number of squares that each unit
could move in a turn. [482]
In the manner of later Hellwig, players could move all, some or none of their
pieces, and each could move any number of squares up to its MF. By <<1960|9n:0>>, every
printed unit bore its CF and MF on its face for easy reference; with the
benefit of hindsight, one might say that each unit had an early precursor of a \x{201c}character
sheet\x{201d} printed on it. Avalon Hill\x{2019}s other famous 1958 release, Gettysburg,
restored Hellwig\x{2019}s idea of unit orientation: each unit\x{a0}counter bore an arrow depicting the direction it was facing, and with that came a system for flanking\x{a0}vulnerabilities. No Battle of Gettysburg\x{a0}could be complete without cannons, and Roberts
faithfully delivers artillery that destroys units at range. Gettysburg also
resurrects Venturini\x{2019}s fidelity to terrain: it has a definite scale\x{a0}(1 inch equaling a quarter mile, or <<1:15|2>>,840) and a topographic map\x{a0}of the actual area where the historical battle was fought, including elevation markings which confer
benefits to firing units. Up until 1961, the map of Gettysburg sported
the same square grid overlay as Tactics II, though thereafter it upgraded to the hexagonal\x{a0}\x{201c}honeycomb\x{201d} overlay that Avalon Hill\x{a0}popularized in the commercial board wargame industry. [483]
Both Tactics II and Gettysburg also have random weather\x{a0}systems, another feature familiar from Venturini.",

while touring the battlefields of the Great War, the young Scruby fell in love
with some miniature diorama installations of thousands of lead soldiers
reenacting\x{a0}the circumstances of a decade before. From that point forward, he
received boxes of Britains\x{a0}for every birthday, though in adulthood his passion
for these figurines was forgotten until he regained his taste for it
vicariously through the fascination of his own son. Scruby, however, was not
satisfied merely to possess toy soldiers\x{2014}he wanted to make them himself. His
wife Wanda, fortunately, taught arts and crafts, and in 1951 she imparted to
Scruby the basics of constructing plaster molds suitable for figure casting.
After an initial success constructing a knock-off of one of his favorite
Britains (the Cameron Highlander), Scruby branched out into various models of
his own invention. It was not until <<1952|18:0>> that he made contact with the
enthusiasts in the Southern California Miniature Collectors Society, including his figure-casting mentor Frank Conley,\x{a0}who often painted the miniatures\x{a0}Scruby sold in the 1950s. Through the Society, in 1953 he met Pat Gorman, who introduced Scruby
to wargaming on the basic model of Wells. Another member of this circle,
Society President Robert Fowler, taught Scruby\x{a0}to cast from plastic rubber molds, and when he perfected this process, it enabled him to go into business
(part-time) manufacturing miniature figures. By the time he submitted his
advertisement to the Bulletin, Scruby had amassed thousands of figures
of his own construction, including six or seven miniature armies of different
periods suitable for wargaming. For Scruby was not the sort to polish up his
soldiers and admire them under glass: \x{201c}I am not\x{2014}and never have been\x{2014}a bona fide

            "The teetotum\x{a0}alone did not liberate Totten from the shackles of six-outcome implements of chance. Totten also recognized
that multiple six-sided dice rolled together produced more nuanced results. The
combinatorial sums of rolling three six-sided dice had long been understood by gamblers, as Section 3.1.3 already illustrated [514]
Totten relies on these general principles in Table K of Strategos\x{a0}to allow a referee to decide several irregular probabilities. When rolling multiple six-sided dice, the odds greatly favor sums in the middle of the possible range; for 3d6,
it is vastly more likely that the resulting sum will amount to 10 or 11 or 12
than, say, 3 or 18. Applying these odds to wargaming, if a referee needs to
resolve an event whose chances are only 1 in 14, one could establish a model
where the event occurs only if a roll of three six-sided dice results in the
sum of 7. For a much more rare event, with prospects of only 1 in 71, a sum of 4
is needed from three dice. Since there is only a 1 in 215 chance of rolling a
three with three six-sided dice, Totten dutifully reports this as a further
probability resolvable in Table K, albeit in a real battle troops are unlikely
to attempt a venture with odds <<near 215|18:1>> to 1. The casting of multiple dice, or
at least multiple die rolls, is a feature of several other tables in Strategos, notably Tables M through Q, which model the efficacy\x{a0}of firearms\x{a0}(from infantry rifles to fancier Gatling guns) by consulting three successive die rolls: the
first determines whether the effect is \x{201c}good\x{201d} or \x{201c}poor,\x{201d} the second

in order to derive a number between one and ten, but recall that ten-sided

below); note as well that ten-sided dice are not among the recommended
equipment in the first edition of Dungeons & Dragons, as
twenty-sided dice served double duty to resolve chances ranging over half the number of their

simulating an event with a probability of success of say, <<0.41|9p>>. A red die might
be selected for the first digit of the number; a yellow for the second. Since

prior to its resurgence, the aforementioned March 1959 naval theme issue of War
Game Digest revealed that the hobby community had already reinvented and
embraced the core idea of shipboard guns dealing points of damage. Virtually every submission talked about the quantification of \x{201c}damage\x{201d} as \x{201c}points\x{201d} dealt when
a \x{201c}hit\x{201d} is scored. George Dunlap\x{2019}s article on \x{201c}Modern Naval War Games\x{201d} reads, \x{201c}Damage
to a ship will be counted on a point system, with the following values: for a
battleship, 27 needed to sink, 23 needed to put out of action, 18 needed to
make motionless. For a carrier or cruiser, 18 needed to sink, 14 put out of
action, 9 to make motionless.\x{201d} [WGD:v3n1] R. L. Patterson\x{a0}and R. W. Dickinson, in separate articles, both describe their shared local system. Patterson provides
a handy chart which enumerates the \x{201c}Points to Sink\x{201d} and \x{201c}Reduce to 1/2 Speed
After\x{201d} totals in \x{201c}damage points\x{201d} for various ship classes; for a battleship, 20
to sink and 15 to halve speed, for a cruiser, 16 to sink and 12 to slow, and so
on. Art Mikel\x{2019}s\x{a0}naval system also focuses on \x{201c}calculating damage done by hits,\x{201d}
and further notes that particular types of missile\x{a0}fire between ships may cause
different amounts of damage: \x{201c}Missiles are arranged in order relative to their
hitting power and assigned a number of points depending on how much damage each
size can do. The number of hits is known and the points times hits gives the
damage.\x{201d} From this we can definitively assert that both the concepts and
vocabulary of hits, points and damage (though not the precise construction \x{201c}hit
points\x{201d}) had spread throughout hobby wargames, at least naval games, even

Kriegspiel\x{201d} in which \x{201c}each Officer is given a rating. This rating sums up his
ability, courage and morale.\x{201d} [WGD:v4n2] As the rating ranges from <<one to six|10a:0>>,
dice may assign it without difficulty, or all officers may start with a rating
of three. An officer figure may accompany other troops into battle, and the
resulting \x{201c}battle factor\x{201d} for the army is the sum of the number of units
engaged plus the rating of the officer and an additional random morale\x{a0}factor. Haskell\x{2019}s system is especially noteworthy for one critical addition: officers in a
victorious engagement rise\x{a0}one level in rating, whereas losing officers decline
one level in rating. Progression systems, as we shall see, almost always reward
survival with some incremental benefit, but only revoke experience under rare
and exceptional conditions. [561]
Tony Bath, in 1960, explains a very similar system of \x{201c}Generalship,\x{201d} one where:
\x{201c}the skill or lack of skill of the commanding generals... have some influence
on the results of battles. All generals will be classed initially as \x{2018}C\x{2019} and by

pieces\x{a0}worth\x{2014}the choice of the gold piece as the base unit of weight
measurement is certainly a wise one, given the expected course of gameplay. At
any encumbrance above 1,500, characters must move\x{a0}at half their normal speed. This threshold is surprisingly easy for a Fighting-man to reach; an example in Men
& Magic of a character with plate armor, a helmet, a shield, a flail, a dagger, a bow\x{a0}with a twenty-arrow quiver and a few miscellaneous sundries already wears
1,200 gold pieces worth of encumbrance, and thus can pick up only 300 more

armor costs 50 gold pieces, but weighs in at <<750|3:0>> worth, and thus an adventurer
would be foolish indeed to strip plate armor from the dead and carry it back to
town for resale, if instead there were gold to carry; shields also weigh

budget of 300 measly gold pieces worth of weight cannot suffice for a mildly
successful dungeon sacking. In an encounter on the first level of a dungeon,
one might find thousands of coins, and without a substantial party, hauling the
stuff out of pits requires serious logistical preparations. Copper and silver
pieces seem to exist in Dungeons & Dragons for no reason other than
to value themselves less than gold pieces and encumber their finders. Hirelings, and to some degree mules, can mitigate these difficulties, but both require

briefly attended that institution\x{2019}s prestigious law school before taking the
foreign service exam and spending some months posted abroad. Upon his return to
Massachusetts, Calhamer drafted rules for a board game\x{a0}which, in its 1958
manuscript form, bore the working title \x{201c}The Game of Realpolitik.\x{201d} It
represented the culmination of ideas Calhamer had developed during his time at
Harvard, although it was not until <<1958|18:0>> that \x{201c}Operations
Research people played many games and offered many suggestions for improvement.\x{201d} [616] The academic discipline of \x{201c}operations research,\x{201d} a fashionable one
at the time, incorporated many of the military topics and practices researched
at RAND, and by the mid-1950s many operations research professionals at
universities or in the employ of private think-tanks\x{a0}had adopted RAND methods. On the strength of his manuscript for \x{201c}The
Game of Realpolitik,\x{201d} Calhamer found employment in operations research at
Sylvania, a defence contractor. However, when Sylvania made no use of his
creation, Calhamer took matters into his own hands. Contracting for the
printing of five hundred copies with his own money, he began selling the game
from his living room, following the precedent of many a game designer before
him\x{2014}including, not so long ago, Charles S. Roberts. Calhamer\x{2019}s game sold under
the title Diplomacy\x{a0}(1959).",

island, peopled it with important political persons of the day they knew from
periodicals and began devising its story. The Play of the \x{201c}Young Men,\x{201d} the
twelve adventurers represented by the wooden soldiers, or the \x{201c}Twelves,\x{201d} as
they came to be known, proved the most enduring, at least for Charlotte\x{a0}and Branwell. From its humble beginnings as an improvised romance about the Twelves setting
out to colonize an African coast controlled by hostile Ashanti natives, the
story evolved into an epic of politics and society, spanning several African
nations, articulated in volumes of text generated by Charlotte and her brother.
As the children matured, the story and characters evolved to fit their tastes.
Branwell\x{a0}sketched a map\x{a0}of the colonial African setting, based on the coast of Guinea, where one might find a province assigned to each of the Bront\x{eb}
children: Wellington\x{2019}s Land, Parry\x{2019}s Land, Ross\x{2019}s Land, and Sneaky\x{2019}s Land, \x{201c}Sneaky\x{201d}

1830s. Charlotte, for her part, focused more on society, on the relationships
between the heroic potentates of Angria, as well as the beauty of the land
itself. Both generated untold hundreds of pages on the history of Angria. By

the efforts of several real-life players who played different roles in the
administration, just as Gygax, Don Kaye and Rob Kuntz shared the direction of
the United States, a practice that recalls the divisions of labor in the
Inter-Nation Simulation. As Section 1.7 already noted, each played a particular role in the administration:
Kaye as President, Kuntz as Secretary of State and Gygax as Secretary of the
Navy. Implicitly, the rulers of the various powers in the Napoleonic Simulation
Campaign shared the identity of their players\x{2014}at the very least, they shared\x{a0}a name. The use of real player names for rulers in Arneson\x{2019}s game probably should
be understood as a casual convention rather than any attempt to populate that
alternate history with plausible leadership; the narrative almost certainly was
not that Duane Jenkins, say, went back in time and became Prime Minister of
England. [662]
As many nations with various executives entered the game, the sheer number of
personae involved soon exceeded that of all but the wackiest Diplomacy\x{a0}variants. Moreover, Arneson heaped on the shoulders of personalities many
non-Diplomacy responsibilities\x{2014}the national budget, the management of marriages,
injuries and recuperations, successions and so on. Suffice it to say that the overall
experience of simulating a world of nations by post successfully established
significant levels of immersion in players. As Section <<1.10|5a:0>> already noted, the
management of the eventual twenty-five or so personalities became an integral
but intensive component of the game administration, one which Arneson fielded
out to Mike Carr, whose experiences with the Fight in the Skies\x{a0}Society rendered him especially qualified for this job of the \x{201c}Personality

the activities of personalities: after all, from a strict Diplomacy perspective,

issue, and the level of interest in the game world remained deeply uncertain.

vetted rules proposals and began the balloting process by which players agreed
on changes. By August, one year after HeiCon, Patterson began to advertise the
existence of the game in some of the higher-circulation outlets of British

mitigation\x{a0}of damage, such that leather armor\x{a0}will absorb seven hits before it

aptitudes, and while adventuring, one accrues experience\x{a0}points from slaying adversaries or recovering treasure. Petal Throne does include a notably
detailed skill\x{a0}system, ranging from Plebian vocations like that of a barber, mason or tailor, through Skilled jobs like that of a fletcher, jeweler or
scribe-accountant, up to Noble forays as an alchemist, dancer or poet.
Virtually all such skills have some applicability to game situations. The magic
system, in contrast to Dungeons & Dragons, allows casters to select
from a flat list of spells\x{2014}spells do not have tiers like in Dungeons &

of successfully casting a spell, however\x{2014}first-level characters have a base 60%
chance of failing to cast a spell, dropping to 20% at level five and 0% at
level nine, though a high Psychic Ability improves odds at all levels. The
overuse of more powerful spells is curtailed by an intrinsic limit on the
number of times they may be cast per day\x{2014}a sort of \x{201c}cooldown\x{201d} period between
casting. [818]

twelve players each, or a total of 240 players\x{2014}almost one in ten of the

One latecomer, Bill Paley, did not arrive until Sunday, but he discovered that
Dave Arneson would host a visit to the Blackmoor\x{a0}dungeon that afternoon at <<3:30|2>> for twelve brave souls. [A&E:#16] Even though sign-ups would not open

reports. [883]

Dragon, though as Paley discovered, Blackmoor can be unforgiving. The party
of twelve fortunately included a ringer\x{2014}Greg Svenson, one of the Blackmoor
Bunch, playing his character the Great Svenny (Paley heard the name as \x{201c}the
Great Sweeney\x{201d}) to provide some adult supervision. When the party encountered a
group of goblins, for example, a fight broke out until those unfortunate
dungeon dwellers caught a glimpse of Svenny, at which point \x{201c}they instantly
recognized him and immediately dropped weapons, etc., and ran like... er,
heaven was after them.\x{201d} When facing a horde of orcs, insulted by hearing their \x{201c}national
anthem\x{201d} played backward (readers of the First Fantasy Campaign may
recognize this circumstance), apparently Svenny killed seventeen orcs\x{a0}in a single melee round. After the party pilfered treasure which belonged to non-player \x{201c}Heroes\x{201d}
who had staked out an area of the dungeon, Svenny\x{2019}s presence once again
prevented an outright slaughter. When the party found a magic stairway,

Cleric, who was named Tindell, climbed to the top of the staircase and fell
through a trap door there, only to find himself high in the air above Blackmoor
Castle and plummeting into the lake, wherein he drowned. Paley\x{2019}s description
abounds with expressions of bafflement, and is perhaps best summed up by his
aside: \x{201c}don\x{2019}t blame me; it\x{2019}s Arneson\x{2019}s dungeon.\x{201d}",

Gaming devotes a small section to \x{201c}Hexagonal Grid Systems\x{201d} (<<4-27|5a:0>>, at least
in its third edition of 1966, and thus it may well have existed in the 1960
printing) which more precisely explicates the value of hexagons: \x{201c}When a
[square] grid system is used for generalized games in which the forces are
permitted to move only from one square to an adjacent square, a force may move
in any one of eight directions. However, if it moves diagonally, it covers
about 1.4 times the distance that it does when it moves vertically or
horizontally. Hexagonal grid patterns, on the other hand, equalize the length
of moves between adjacent hexagons, but restrict the possible directions of
movement to six.\x{201d} McHugh further notes that the system was in use by the RAND
Corporation.",

Bath uses the term \x{201c}saving throw\x{201d} throughout his 1966 rules. By this time it
was a common term in wargaming, thanks to its popularization in Donald
Featherstone\x{2019}s War Games (1962), which included Bath\x{2019}s ancient miniature
rules and accordingly Bath\x{2019}s terminology. Although the concept of saving throws
does not appear in Bath\x{2019}s original 1956 rules, by <<1960|9n:0>> he had developed the
concept entirely, e.g.: \x{201c}In my period allowance is made for protective armour.
Thus a man without armour or shield\x{2014}the majority of light infantry\x{2014}needs a 6 to
save him; if he is in armour or carries a shield, a 5 or 6; and if he has both
armor and a shield a 4, 5 or 6 will save him.\x{201d} [WGD:v4n3] This must be among
the very earliest uses of the idea (and terminology) of a roll to \x{201c}save\x{201d} a
wargame unit after a hit. Note that Arneson and Gygax invoked the term \x{201c}saving
throw\x{201d} in Don\x{2019}t Give Up the Ship\x{a0}prior to Dungeons & Dragons.",

[IWS:Sep70] Robin Laws, 40 Years of Gen Con, 15, even has a picture of

picture was taken by Mike Carr, a participant in both the Napoleonic Simulation
Campaign and Blackmoor\x{2014}thus at least one member of the Twin Cities gaming
circle saw this game first-hand in 1970, an important time in the evolution of
role-playing in the Twin Cities, and perhaps others from that group took in the

From Games & Puzzles, January
1974. In that same article on the history of Diplomacy, Calhamer asserts that \x{201c}the game was completed in 1954 and [has] undergone
relatively little change since then,\x{201d} and stresses the insignificance of the
improvements introduced <<around 1958|18:1>>. Calhamer has made similar pronouncements
in other venues; in a 1966 piece in Diplomania #12, he states: \x{201c}I
began devising the game in 1953 and completed the first set in 1954.\x{201d} Calhamer
also provided to Graustark\x{a0}#315 (Aug 1974) an article on \x{201c}The
First Four Games of Diplomacy, 1953\x{2013}1954,\x{201d} records of which had \x{201c}just
come to light,\x{201d} detailing the players in each game, the number of moves played
and the final tallies of supply centers held. It is difficult to ascertain how
much these early efforts resembled Calhamer\x{2019}s finished product, though the
significance of the differences between the 1958 and 1959 rules demonstrates
that the variance could be quite large. In the Diplomania article,
Calhamer reports of early versions <<around 1953|18:1>>\x{2013}1954 that \x{201c}in the first two
games, negotiation was entirely by written notes passed from player to player
at the board\x{201d} and then avows that this was quickly abandoned in favor of verbal
communications; the 1958 manuscript, however, still requires written
communication between players, which argues that \x{201c}the first two games\x{201d} may have
been quite a bit later than Calhamer recalled in 1966. Calhamer\x{2019}s oldest
reflection on the history of Diplomacy (from late 1963) says that at an
earlier stage in the evolution of the game \x{201c}there had been several more
provinces in each power; at another England opened the game with a fleet in
Gibraltar, and Switzerland had a defensive army with which it could resist
encroachments on Swiss territory by other powers. An English supply center in
Ireland, a Turkish center in Egypt, and a neutral center in Iceland were once
part of the game\x{201d} as well. [GRS:#11] Calhamer insists, in the Games &
Puzzles article, that chess and the card game\x{a0}\x{201c}Hearts\x{201d} are the only
antecedents of Diplomacy; it seems almost certain, however, that Diplomacy
owes some debt to both the rigid and free wargaming mechanics popularized
at RAND.",

impossible that any contemporary copy of the profoundly obscure Corner of

there is someone else out there too and after finding out they could clobber us

The manuscripts for some of his prospective titles survive, most notably the
game Ships of the Line, which in its typewritten form has a foreword
from Gygax written in 1972 (while still intending its publication for Guidon
Games), but also a foreword from Arneson which refers to TSR. It is probably
best described as an aggregation of the rules for the naval aspects of the
Napoleonic Simulation Campaign (see
Section <<1.10|5a:0>> for more on Ships of the Line). Although it contains many
disjointed chunks of system, it gives little sense of how the overall campaign
might actually work\x{2014}what objectives players might achieve or what form their
orders or moves might take, aside from a great deal of tactical information
that is at best redundant with Don\x{2019}t Give Up the Ship. It alludes to the

provides no similar backdrop that might establish the parameters of play for Ships
of the Line. Its afterword begins, \x{201c}After reading this far, are you

deficiencies as a potential release. Even more curiously, Arneson sold a
