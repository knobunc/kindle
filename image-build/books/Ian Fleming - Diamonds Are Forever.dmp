One of the directors of the Tiara happens to be called that. He\x{2019}s another one with a joke name. \x{2018}Lame-brain\x{2019} Pissaro. Used to be in charge of their dope racket. Ran the stuff over the Mexican border and then broke it down and parcelled it out to middlemen on the coast. The FBI got on to him and he did a term in San Quentin. Then he came out and Spang gave him the job at the Tiara in exchange for the rap he\x{2019}d carried. And now he\x{2019}s a racehorse owner like the Vanderbilts. Nice going. I\x{2019}ll be interested to see what sort of shape he\x{2019}s in these days. He was almost a main-liner in the days he was dealing in coke. They gave him the cure in San Q, but it\x{2019}s left him a bit soft in the head. Hence the \x{2018}Lame-brain\x{2019}. Then there\x{2019}s the jock, \x{2018}Tingaling\x{2019} Bell.

Enough to give him quite a bulky packet in police records. But for the last few years he\x{2019}s been running straight, if you care to call it that, as trainer for Spang.\x{201d}",
