The rest of the Birdseyes were not apolitical. His daughter Ruth would be active in the League of Women Voters, for instance. His own children and their spouses never knew if Birdseye was a Democrat or a Republican, even though they were mostly loyal Democrats. On the other hand, his father had been an outspoken Republican. But there is no record of Birdseye ever uttering a political statement. He was not a rebel. He never denounced religion, war, or corporations, but his participation in such institutions was always slightly removed. At heart he was something of an outsider, the odd kid they called Bugs, a likable maverick who knew how to get along with people. And so he had something in common with the National Geographic Society, adventurers who tried to remain apolitical at the center of the Washington establishment.",
