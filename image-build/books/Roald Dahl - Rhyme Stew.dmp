Young fools rush in, it\x{2019}s always said,
Where even angels fear to tread.\x{201d}
How wise. Had this been you or me,
We would have jumped up instantly
And rushed along the street point-blank
To rob the safe in Barclays Bank.
Not Ali Baba, no not he,
He wanted fun, not villainy.
And so, upon that selfsame day,
At <<midnight|13>>, Ali made his way
To London, which he knew quite well,
And thence into the Ritz Hotel.",
