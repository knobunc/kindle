            'Wheeler has told me just this minute that we dine in an hour\'s time at <<four o\'clock|6>>. On my remarking that I proposed to request more ample accommodation he paused for a moment\'s reflection, then replied it would be a matter of some difficulty and that he advised me to wait for a while. On my expressing some indignation that such a decrepit vessel should be used for such a voyage, he, standing in the door of my hutch with a napkin over his arm, lent me as much as he could of a seaman\'s philosophy-as: Lord sir she\'ll float till she sinks, and Lord sir she was built to be sunk; with such a lecture on lying in ordinary with no one aboard but the boatswain and the carpenter, so much about the easiness of lying to a hawser in the good old way rather than to a nasty iron chain that rattles like a corpse on a gibbet, he has sunk my heart clear down to her filthy ballast! He had such a dismissiveness of copper bottoms! I find we are no more than pitched within and without like the oldest vessel of all and suppose her first commander was none other than Captain Noah! Wheeler\'s parting comfort to me was that he was sure she is "safer in a blow than many a stiffer vessel". Safer! "For," said he, "if we get into a bit of a blow she\'ll render like an old boot. \' To tell the truth he left me with much of the brandy\'s good work undone. After all that, I found it was positively required I should remove all articles that I should need on the voyage from my chests before they were struck down below! Such is the confusion aboard this vessel I can find no one who has the authority to countermand this singularly foolish order. I have resigned myself therefore, used Wheeler for some of this unpacking, set out my books myself, and seen my chests taken away. I should be angry if the situation were not so farcical. However, I had a certain delight in some of the talk between the fellows who took them off, the words were so perfectly nautical. I have laid Falconer\'s Marine Dictionary by my pillow; for I am determined to speak the tarry language as perfectly as any of these rolling fellows!',

            'But this ship has more strings than a violin, more than a lute, more I think than a harp, and under the wind\'s tuition she makes a ferocious music. I will own that after a while I could have done with human company, but the Church has succumbed and the Army too. No lady can possibly be anywhere but in her bunk. As for the Navy-well, it is literally in its element. Its members stand here and there encased in tarpaulin, black with faces pale only by contrast. At a little distance they resemble nothing so much as rocks with the tide washing over them. When the light had quite faded I felt my way back to my hutch and shouted for Wheeler, who came at once, got me out of my oilskins, hung the suit on the hook where it at once took up a drunken angle. I told him to bring me a lamp but he told me it was not possible. This put me in a .temper but he explained the reason well enough. Lamps are dangerous to us all since once overset there is .no controlling them. But I might have a candle if I cared to pay for it since a candle dowses itself when it falls, and in any case I must take a few safety measures in the management of it. Wheeler himself had a supply of candles. I replied that I had thought such articles were commonly obtained from the purser. After a short pause Wheeler agreed. He had not thought I would wish to deal directly with the purser who lived apart and was seldom seen. Gentlemen used not to have any traffic with him but employed their servants who ensured that the transaction was honest and above board. "For," said he, "you know what pursers are!" I agreed with an air of simplicity which in an instant-you observe, sir, that I was coming to myself-concealed a revised estimate of Mr Wheeler, his fatherly concern and his willingness to serve me! I made a mental note that I was determined always to see round and through him farther than he supposed that he saw round and through me. So by <<eleven o\'clock at night|6>>-six beUs according to the book -behold me seated at my table-Rap with this journal open before me. But what pages of trivia! Here are none of the interesting events, acute observations and the, dare I say, sparks of wit with which it is my first ambition to entertain your lordship! However, our passage is but begun.',

            "\"\\Vho the devil is this, Cumbershum? Have they not read my orders?\" This remark so astonished me that I did not attend to Cumbershum's reply, if indeed he made any. My first thought was that in the course of some quite incomprehensible misunderstanding Captain Anderson was about to strike me. At once, and in a loud voice, I made myself known. The man began to bluster and my anger would have got the better of me had I not been more and more aware of the absurdity of our position. For standing as we did, I, the captain, Cumbershum and his satellite, we all had one leg stiff as a post while the other flexed regularly as the deck -moved under us. It made me laugh in what must have seemed an unmannerly fashion but the fellow deserved the rebuke even if it was accidental. It stopped his blusters and heightened his colour, but gave me the opportunity of producing your name and that of His Excellency your brother, much as one might prevent the nearer approach of a highwayman by quickly presenting a brace of pistols. Our captain squinted first-you will forgive the figure-down your lordship's muzzle, decided you were loaded, cast a fearful eye at the ambassador in my other hand and reined back with his yellow teeth showing! I have seldom seen a face at once so daunted and so atrabilious. He is a complete argument for the sovranty of the humours. This exchange and the following served to move me into the fringes of his local despotism\x{b7} so that I felt much like an envoy at the Grande Porte who may regard himself as reasonably safe, if uncomfortable, while all round him heads topple. I swear Captain Anderson would have shot, hanged, keel-hauled, marooned me if prudence had not in that instant got the better of his inclination. Nevertheless, if today when the French clock in the Arras room chimed <<ten|11>> and our ship's bell here was struck <<four|11>> times-at that time, I say, if your lordship experienced a sudden access of well-being and a warming satisfaction, I cannot swear that it may not have been some distant notion of what a silver-mounted and murdering piece of ordnance a noble name was proving to be among persons of a middle station!",

There is a known, true, tried and tested link between the perception of female charms and the employment of strong drink! <<After three|9:1>> glasses I have seen twenty years vanish from a face like snow in summer! A sea voyage added to that stimulant-and one that has set us to move gently through the tropics of all placeshas an effect on the male constitution that may be noted in the more recondite volumes of the profession-I mean the medical profession-but had not come my way in the course of an ordinary educationo Perhaps somewhere in Martial-but I have not got him with me-or that Theocritus-you remember, <<midday|13>> and summer's heat TOV\x{b0}n&.va. &8oUcap.Efo Oh yes, we may well fear Pan here or his naval equivalent whoever it may be!

It is all madness, tropical madness, a delirium, if not a transport! But now, standing by the bulwarks in the tropic night, stars caught among the sails and swaying very gently all together, I find that I deepen my voice so that her name vibrates and yet I know my own madness-she meanwhile, why she heaves her scarcely covered bosom with more motion than stirs the glossy deep. It is folly; but then, how to describe-Noble godfather, if I do you wrong, rebuke me. Once ashore and I will be sane again, I will be that wise and impartial adviser, administrator, whose foot you have set on the first rung-but did you not say \"Tell all\"?

            'Mr Prettiman paces the afterdeck. The Famille Pike, father, mother and little daughters, hurry up and down the afterdeck and the waist peering on this side and that lest they should be accosted, I suppose, and subjected to some indignity or impropriety. Colley comes by in the waist; and every time nowadays he not only favours me with his reverence but tops it off with a smile of such understanding and sanctity he is a kind of walking invitation to mal de mer. What could I do? I could scarcely hand the lady into the foretop! You will ask what is wrong with my hutch or her hutch. I answer "Everything!" Does Mr Colley but cry "Hem!" on the other side of the lobby he wakes Miss Granham in the hutch just aft of him. Does that windbag Mr Brocklebank but break wind-as he does every morning <<just after seven|10>> bells-our timbers shudder clear through my hutch and into Mr Prettiman\'s just forrard of me. I have had to prospect farther for a place suitable to the conduct of our amours. I had thought of finding and introducing myself to the purser-but to my surprise I found that all the officers shied away from mention of him as if the man were holy, or indecent, I cannot tell which, and he never appears on deck. It is a subject I propose to get clear in my mind-when I have a mind again and this, this surely temporary madness-',

            'I t is the same night and I have recovered from what I now think a morbid view of practically everything! The truth is I am more concerned with what Wheeler may discover and pass on to his fellows than considerations of a kind of methodistical moralism! For one thing, I cannot get the iron ring back into precise shape and for another, that curst perfume .lingers yet! Confound the fool of a woman! As I look back, it seems to me that what I shall ever remember is not the somewhat feverish and too brief pleasure of my entertainment but the occasional and astonishing recourse to the Stage which she employed whenever her feelings were more than usually roused-or perhaps when they were more than usually definable! Could an actress convey an emotion that is indefinable? And would she not therefore welcome with gratitude a\' situation where the emotion was direct and precise? And does this not account for stagey behaviour?" In my very modest involvement with amateur theatricals at the university, those whom we had hired to be our professional advisers named for us some of the technicalities of the art, craft or trade. Thus, I should have said that after my remark "Why, my dear, we must cross that bridge when you come to it!" she did not reply in words; but being half-turned away she turned wholly away and started forward away from me-would have gone much further had the hutch allowed of it-would have performed the movement we were told constituted a break down stage right! I laughed to remember it and was somewhat more myself again. Good God, as the captain would agree, one parson in a ship is one too many, and the stage serves as an agreeable alternative to moralism! Why, was there not a performance given us by the reverend gentleman and Miss Brocklebank in the course of the one service we have had to suffer? I am this very moment possessed by a positively and literally Shakespearean concept. He had found her attractive and she had shown herself, as women will, anxious to kneel before a male officiant-they made a pair! Should we not do them good-or, as an imp whispered to me, do us all three good? Should not this unlikely Beatrice and Benedict be brought into a mountain of affection for each other? "I will do any modest office to help my cousin to a good husband." I laughed aloud as I wrote that-and can only hope that the other passengers, lying in their bunks at <<three bells of the middle watch|15>> think that like Beatrice I laughed in my sleep! I shall for the future single out Mr Colley for the most, shall I say, distinguished attentions on my part-or at least until Miss Brocklebank proves to be no longer in danger from the French!',

Our sails hang down and there is a vaporous dimness everywhere, even at <<noon|13>>. Once more and with that same terrifying instantaneity came Rashes of lightning in the mist that were awful in their fury! I Bed to my cabin with such a sense of our peril from these warring elements, such a return of my sense of our suspension over this liquid profundity, that I could scarce get my hands together in prayer. However, little by little I came to myself and to peace though all outside was turmoil. I reminded myself, as I should have done before, that one good soul, One good deed, good thought, and more, one touch of Heaven\'s Grace was greater than all these boundless miles of rolling vapour and wetness, this intimidating vastness, this louring majesty! Indeed, I thought, though with some hesitation, that perhaps bad men in their ignorant deaths may find here the awfulness in which they must dwell by reason of their depravity. You see, my dear sister, that the strangeness of our surroundings, the weakness consequent on my prolonged nausea and a natural diffidence that has led me too readily to shrink into my shell has produced in me something not unlike a temporary disordering of the intellects! I found myself thinking of a seabird crying as one of those lost souls to whom I have alluded!

Oldmeadow himself was in full dress and unblooded sword, as were the ship\'s officers. Even our young gentlemen wore their dirks and expressions of piety. We passengers were dressed as sombrely as possible. The seamen were drawn up by watches, and were as presentable as their varied garments permit. Portly Mr Brocklebank was erect but yellow and drawn from potations that would have reduced Mr Colley to a ghost. As I inspected the man I thought that Brocklebank would have gone through the whole of Colley\'s ordeal and fall with no more than a bellyache and a sore head. Such are the varied fabrics of the human tapestry that surrounds me! Our ladies, who must surely have had such an occasion in their minds when they fitted themselves for the voyage, were in mourning-even Brocklebank\'s two doxies, who supported him on either side. Mr Prettiman was present at this superstitious ritual by the side of Miss Granham, who had led him there. What is all his militant Atheism and Republicanism when pitted against this daughter of a canon of Exeter Cathedral? I made a note as I saw him fretting and barely contained at her side, that she was the one of the two with whom I must speak and to whom I must convey the kind of delicate admonition I had intended for our notorious Freethinker!',

At Sydney Cove, or the Cape of Good Hope, should we put in there, Deverel intends-or the drink in him intends-to resign his commission, call the captain out and shoot him dead! "For", said he in a louder voice and with his shaking right hand lifted, "I can knock a crow off a steeple with one barker!" Hugging and patting me and calling me his good Edmund he informed me I was to act for him when the time came; and if, if by some luck of the devil, he himself was taken off, why the information was to be put fully in my famous journal-I had much ado to F him taken to his cabin without rousing the whole ship. But here is news indeed! So that is why a certain captain so detests a parson! It would surely be more reasonable in him to detest a lord! Yet there is no doubt about it.
