            "In some of these early civilizations a few steps in mathematics were taken. In prehistoric times, which means roughly before 4000 B.C., several civilizations at least learned to think about numbers as abstract concepts. That is, they recognized that three sheep and three arrows have something in common, a quantity called <<three|9f>>, which can be thought about independently of any physical objects. Each of us in his own schooling goes through this same process of divorcing numbers from physical objects.

The term \x{201c}Babylonian\x{201d} includes a succession of civilizations which occupied the region of modern Iraq. Both of these peoples possessed whole numbers and fractions, a fair amount of arithmetic, some algebra, and a number of simple rules for finding the areas and volumes of geometrical figures. These rules were but the incidental accumulations of experience, much as people learned through experience what foods to eat. Many of the rules were in fact incorrect but good enough for the simple applications made then. For example, the Egyptian rule for finding the area of a circle amounts to using 3.16 times the square of the radius; that is, their value of \x{3c0} was <<3.16|5a:0>>.

They were unified under the leadership of the prophet Mohammed and began an attempt to convert the world to Mohammedanism, using the sword as their most decisive argument. They conquered all the land around the Mediterranean Sea. In the Near East they took over Persia and penetrated as far as India. In southern Europe they occupied Spain, southern France, where they were stopped by Charles Martel, southern Italy and Sicily. Only the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire was not subdued and remained an isolated center of Greek and Roman learning. In rather surprisingly quick time as the history of nations goes, the Arabs settled down and built a civilization and culture which maintained a high level from <<about 800|18:0>> to 1200 A.D. Their chief centers were Bagdad in what is now Iraq, and Cordova in Spain. Realizing that the Greeks had created wonderful works in many fields, the Arabs proceeded to gather up and study what they could still find in the lands they controlled. They translated the works of Aristotle, Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes, and Ptolemy into Arabic. In fact, Ptolemy\x{2019}s chief work, whose title in Greek meant \x{201c}Mathematical Collection,\x{201d} was called the Almagest (The Greatest Work) by the Arabs and is still known by this name. Incidentally, other Arabic words which are now common mathematical terms are algebra, taken from the title of a book written by Al-Khowarizmi, a ninth-century Arabian mathematician, and algorithm, now meaning a process of calculation, which is a corruption of the man\x{2019}s name.",

The Hindus made a few contributions of their own, such as the use of special number symbols from <<1 to 9|10a:0>>, the introduction of 0, and the use of positional notation with base ten, that is, our modern method of writing numbers.

            'Before we examine just how Renaissance painters employed mathematics and thereby revolutionized the art of painting, let us see what had been going on in this field. Rather early in the medieval period painting became an extensive activity. Kings, princes, and church leaders commissioned works of art to enhance buildings. The system which the medieval painters used until <<about 1300|18:0>> was conceptual. Their objective was to portray and embellish the central themes in the Christian drama. Since the intent was to stir up religious feelings rather than to present real scenes, people and objects were drawn in accordance with conventions which had acquired symbolic meaning. Thus people were placed in unnatural, stylized positions; the general impression was one of flatness; and the entire painting had a two-dimensional effect. The backgrounds were usually solid gold to suggest that the action or people existed in some supra-earthly region.',

His ideas were furthered and written down by the architect and painter Leone Battista Alberti (1404\x{2013}1472). It is not Alberti\x{2019}s artistic work which entitles him to fame but his technical knowledge. He studied architecture, painting, perspective, and sculpture, wrote several books explaining theoretical matters to artists, and exercised enormous influence. In his Della Pittura (1435) Alberti says that learning is essential to the artist. The arts are learned by reason and method; they are mastered by practice. He says further that the first necessity of a painter is to know geometry and that painting by incorporating and revealing the mathematical structure of nature can even improve on nature.",

At any rate, except for Descartes, Pascal, and Fermat, Desargues\x{2019} colleagues exhibited the usual reactions to radical ideas: they dismissed them, called Desargues crazy, and forgot projective geometry.

The job, which entailed mainly the management of estates owned by the Cathedral, left Copernicus with plenty of time to make astronomical observations and to think about the relevant theory.

If time is measured from the instant at which the man starts out and if he has been traveling for 20 minutes, say, then t varies from <<0 to 20|10a:1>>.

            "In the seventeenth century one of the most pressing problems of the times was time itself. The increasing scientific activity, particularly in an age which had decided to measure and to seek quantitative laws, created the need for convenient, accurate methods of measuring time. Moreover, as we have already had occasion to mention in other connections, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were concerned with the very practical problem of improving the method by which ships determined their longitude at sea. Here a good clock is the simplest answer. Suppose that the longitude of a given place on land is known and that a ship has on board a clock set to agree with the time prevailing at that given locality. Since the earth turns through 360\x{b0} of longitude in one day, it turns through 15\x{b0} in each hour. Hence for each 15\x{b0} that a ship is west, say, of the fixed locale, <<midday|13>> occurs one hour later compared to the time at the fixed position on land. If a ship\x{2019}s officer notes (by means of the sun\x{2019}s position) when <<midday|13>> occurs at his position at sea and finds, for example, that his clock reads <<3 o\x{2019}clock|6>> whereas it should, of course, read <<12 o\x{2019}clock|6>>, he knows that the longitude of his position is 45\x{b0} west of the given reference locality on land. We can see then why scientists decided to search for a reliable and accurate clock.",

Such a function, even if it were suitable in all other respects, could not represent the motion of a bob whose maximum displacement is 2 or 3, say. This difficulty is easily obviated. Now that we have y = sin A, we can readily manufacture hundreds of new functions whose amplitudes are whatever we choose to make them. Consider, for example, y = 2 sin A. How does this function behave compared to y = sin A? The answer is immediate. For any value of A, y = 2 sin A is twice as much as y = sin A. Thus when A = \x{3c0}/4 or 45\x{b0}, sin A = 0.71, and 2 sin A is <<1.42|5a:0>>. Figure 18\x{2013}10 shows how y = 2 sin A looks compared to y = sin A.

Indeed, it goes back to the very first emergence of any real mathematics and science, namely the beginning of the classical Greek period. For example, the Pythagoreans discovered that the lengths of two equally taut plucked strings whose sounds harmonize are related by simple numerical ratios such as <<2 to 1|10a:0>>, <<4 to 3|10a:0>>, and <<3 to 2|10a:0>>. The lower note in each case originates with the longer string. They also designed musical scales whose notes, as measured quantitatively by the lengths of the vibrating strings, possessed precise numerical values. From Pythagorean times onward, mathematicians and scientists were convinced that musical sounds had important mathematical properties, and music, along with arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, became part of the quadrivium. These four subjects were studied together right through the medieval period. Although Greek, Arab, and medieval mathematicians continued to investigate musical sounds and wrote books on music, their work was essentially limited to the construction of new systems of scales for instrumental and vocal music.',

The function y2 = sin 4\x{3c0}t goes through two full cycles in the interval from t = 0 to t = 1 and begins its third cycle of sine values as soon as t increases beyond 1. Thus at t = 1 both functions begin to repeat the values which they had taken on at t = 0 and, in the interval from t = 1 to t = 2, both functions will repeat the behavior exhibited in the interval from t = 0 to t = 1. Since y1 and y2 repeat their former behavior, it follows that y, which is the sum of y1 and y2, will also repeat its former behavior. In other words, in the interval from t = 1 to t = 2, y will behave precisely as it did in the interval from t = 0 to t = 1. And in each succeeding unit interval of t-values, the function will repeat the behavior exhibited in the interval from t = 0 to t = 1. If we therefore determine the behavior of y in the interval from <<0 to 1|10a:0>>, we know how it behaves for all larger values of t.",

The amount of information that can be deduced from some sets of axioms is almost incredible. Euclid deduced <<about 500|18:0>> theorems from his set.

The civilizations which should be discussed are the Egyptian and Babylonian, the classical Greek, the Alexandrian Greek, the Roman, the Hindu and Arabic, the medieval, and Western European since <<about 1400|18:0>>. The Roman and medieval civilizations are singular because despite achievements in other areas, they were nonproductive in mathematics. These exceptional cases could provoke a discussion of what factors in a civilization promote mathematical activity.
