Suppose that a person has a fixed amount of fencing at his disposal and wishes to enclose as much area as possible along a river front in such a way that no fencing is required along the shore itself. The question now is, What should the shape of the boundary curve be? According to a legend, which may or may not have a factual basis, this problem was solved thousands of years ago by Dido, the founder of the city of Carthage on the Mediterranean coast of Africa. Dido, the daughter of the king of the Phoenician city of Tyre, ran away from home. She took a fancy to this land on the Mediterranean, and made an agreement to pay a definite sum of money for as much land as \x{201c}could be encompassed by a bull\x{2019}s hide.\x{201d} Dido thereupon took a bull\x{2019}s hide, cut it up into thin long strips, tied the strips together, and used this length to \x{201c}encompass land.\x{201d} She chose an area along the shore, because she was smart enough to realize that no hide would be needed along the shore. But there still remained the question of what shape to use for the boundary formed by the hide, that is, for ABC of Fig. <<6\x{2013}10|5a:0>>.

The answer to this problem is a circle. If, therefore, we choose a semicircle for arc ABC, it will contain maximum area on one side of the shore. For if there were a more favorable shape than the semicircle, the mirror image in AC of that shape would, together with the original, do better than the circle and yet have the same perimeter as the circle.

            "The first reasonably accurate calculation of the size of the earth was made by a simple application of Euclidean geometry. One of the most learned men of the Alexandrian Greek world, Eratosthenes (275\x{2013}194 B.C.), a geographer, mathematician, poet, historian, and astronomer, used the following plan. At the summer solstice, the sun shone directly down into a well at Syene (C in Fig. <<6\x{2013}12|5a:0>>). As Eratosthenes well appreciated, this meant that the sun was directly overhead. At the same time, at the city of Alexandria, 500 miles north of Syene, the direction of the sun was AS\x{2032}, whereas the overhead direction was OAD. Now the sun is so far away that the lines AS\x{2032} and CS could be taken to be parallel. Eratosthenes measured the angle DAS\x{2032} and found it to be 74\x{b0}. But this angle equals the vertical angle OAE, and the latter and angle AOC are alternate interior angles of parallel lines. Hence angle AOC is also , or , or 1/48 of the entire angle at O. Then arc AC is 1/48 of the entire circumference. Since AC is 500 miles, the entire circumference is 48 \x{b7} 500 or 24,000 miles.",

We shall describe a simple one just to see that the latitude and longitude of places on the earth can be determined. Suppose we seek the latitude of some point P (Fig. <<7\x{2013}15|5a:1>>). On the day of the spring equinox, that is about March 21, the sun is in the plane of the equator and, at <<noon|3b>> on that day, it is also in the plane of the meridian of longitude.

Then angle 2 equals the angle of latitude POV because they are alternate interior angles of parallel lines. But angle 1 equals angle 2 because they are verticle angles.

Finding the distance to the moon.
We shall consider first how one can find the distance to the moon. Suppose that P and Q (Fig <<7\x{2013}21|5a:0>>) are two points on the earth\x{2019}s equator which are chosen to satisfy the following conditions: The moon is to be directly overhead at P; that is, the moon, M, regarded as a point, is to be on the line from the center of the earth, E, through P. The moon is in this position at certain times each month. The point Q is chosen such that the moon is just visible from it. This means that the moon is clearly visible from points closer to P but not visible from points farther away from P and along the equator. Another way of saying the same thing is that the line MQ is tangent to the equator at Q. Let us draw the line EQ. The angle EQM is a right angle because the radius of a circle drawn to the point of contact of a tangent is perpendicular to the tangent.",

However, because the distances PM and QM are much larger in the case of the sun, angle E is larger and very close to 90\x{b0}. Moreover, the angle must be measured very accurately because a small error in the angle will cause a large error in the value of PM.

Refraction of light.
We often recognize that something strange does happen when light goes from air to water, say, because a straight rod when partially immersed in water seems to bend sharply at the water level. Also if one should shine a flashlight beam into water, he would observe the sudden change in the direction of the beam as it enters the water. This bending of light is called refraction. The Alexandrians sought to determine the extent of this change in direction. Specifically, if i is the angle (Fig. <<7\x{2013}26|5a:0>>) which the direction of the incident light ray makes with the perpendicular to the surface which separates the two media, say air and water, and if r is the angle which the refracted light makes with this same perpendicular, then what the Alexandrians sought is the relationship between angle i and angle r. But the Alexandrians and Ptolemy, in particular, who worked very hard on this problem, were baffled. They did observe that as increased, r increased, but the increase did not occur in any simple manner. Moreover, the r which corresponds to a given i is not the same for any two different media. Thus, if the first medium should be air, then for the same i, the value of r for glass would be different from that for water.",

Since this angle of incidence also is greater than the critical angle, the light is again totally reflected at an angle of 45\x{b0} with B\x{2032}A\x{2032} and takes the direction RO\x{2032}. Thus the final ray, RO\x{2032}, has the same direction as the original ray, OP, but is displaced by the distance PR.",

Refraction by a lens.
Total reflection is but one phenomenon of the refractive effect of light. The most common use of the refractive effect of light is in lenses. If light streams out from an object at P (Fig. <<7\x{2013}32|5a:0>>) in all directions, some of the rays will strike the lens at points such as Q1, Q2, and Q3. There their directions will change because they are entering glass. Thus the rays PQ1, PQ2, and PQ3 may take the directions Q1R1, Q2R2 and Q3R3, respectively. At the right-hand surface of the glass, the rays re-enter the air and, since the medium in which the light is traveling changes, the light rays bend again. By properly shaping the lens surfaces, that is Q1Q2Q3 on the left and R1R2R3 on the right, the light from P may be made to concentrate at S. All optical instruments, such as telescopes, microscopes, binoculars, and cameras, contain lenses of this kind.",

When light enters the eye (Fig. <<7\x{2013}33|5a:0>>), it passes through a liquid (denoted by A in the figure), called the aqueous humor, then through the lens, L, which is made of a fibrous jelly, and finally it enters another liquid, V, called the vitreous humor. Although all three media have some refractive effect upon the light, most of the refraction occurs when it encounters the aqueous humor. To be perceived, light rays that enter the eye must strike the retina, R, in the rear. The eye has a ciliary muscle which changes the shape of the lens and therefore the direction of the light rays passing through the eye so that the rays are directed toward the retina. Eyes which for one reason or another cannot direct the rays to the retina must be aided by additional lenses in eyeglasses.

We have been discussing the law of refraction and some of the remarkable effects which take place at a sharp boundary between the two media. But the refractive effect of light is equally striking and important when there is a gradual change in the nature of the medium through which the light passes. Let us consider the passage of light through air, which is not a uniform medium. Generally it is more dense near the ground and thinner at higher altitudes. Hence, when light comes to a person at P (Fig. 1\x{2013}1) from the sun at O, the light ray follows a curved path as it travels through the earth\x{2019}s atmosphere because it is continually refracted. For the observer at P the direction of the incoming light is O\x{2032}P, and hence he thinks that the source lies along the direction PO\x{2032}. This is the reason that we are often deceived about the true position of the sun (see Chapter 1).",

            "The refractive effect of light is, as we can see, a peculiar phenomenon. Why does light behave this way? We do not understand what light is and so cannot analyze the substance itself to learn why it refracts, but we have another kind of explanation which sheds light on nature\x{2019}s operations. The clue lies in the law of refraction. We note that refraction depends upon the velocity of light in the medium. The seventeenth-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat, whom we shall meet again, pondered on this fact and, after analyzing the law of refraction, found an important principle. Suppose that light travels from the point P in air (Fig. <<7\x{2013}34|5a:0>>) to the point Q in water and bends at O in accordance with the law of refraction. Were the light to follow the straight-line path from P to Q instead of the broken-line path POQ, it would travel a shorter distance. Let us note, however, that the distance O\x{2032}Q in water would be longer than OQ. Because the velocity in water is smaller than in air, the light might lose more time in traveling the path O\x{2032}Q instead of OQ than it might save by traveling the shorter distance PO\x{2032} instead of PO in air. By a mathematical argument Fermat showed that light takes the path which requires least time.",

Light takes the path requiring least time.
But is this fact true for other phenomena of light? When light travels from one point to another in a uniform medium, it takes the straight-line path. It would seem as though in this case light chooses the criterion of shortest path and not that of least time. But in a uniform medium the velocity of light is constant, and so the shortest path requires the least time. Let us consider next what happens when light goes from a point P to a mirror and then to a point Q. We proved in Chapter 6 that light takes the shortest path. But here too the light travels in one medium and, because the medium is uniform, the velocity is constant; hence the shortest path again means least time. It would appear from Fermat\x{2019}s analysis that nature is wise. It knows mathematics and employs it in the interest of economy.",

The system which the medieval painters used until <<about 1300|18:0>> was conceptual. Their objective was to portray and embellish the central themes in the Christian drama. Since the intent was to stir up religious feelings rather than to present real scenes, people and objects were drawn in accordance with conventions which had acquired symbolic meaning. Thus people were placed in unnatural, stylized positions; the general impression was one of flatness; and the entire painting had a two-dimensional effect. The backgrounds were usually solid gold to suggest that the action or people existed in some supra-earthly region.',

He studied architecture, painting, perspective, and sculpture, wrote several books explaining theoretical matters to artists, and exercised enormous influence. In his Della Pittura (1435) Alberti says that learning is essential to the artist. The arts are learned by reason and method; they are mastered by practice.

Let us now suppose that JK (Fig. <<10\x{2013}10|5a:0>>) is a horizontal line which makes an angle of 45\x{b0} with the screen. Assume that the eye at E looks out along the line JK toward infinity. Then the line from the eye to the point at infinity on JK will be parallel to JK. Since JK is horizontal, the new line, EL in Fig. <<10\x{2013}10|5a:0>>, will also be horizontal. It will pierce the screen at some point, say D1, and will also make an angle of 45\x{b0} with the screen. The triangle D1EO\x{2032} is a right triangle because EO\x{2032} is perpendicular to the screen. In view of the acute angles of 45\x{b0}, O\x{2032}D1 = EO\x{2032}. Then the point D1 is as far from O\x{2032} as E is. The projection from E to the various points of JK cuts the screen in some line, J\x{2032}K\x{2032}, say. As the eye continues to follow JK toward infinity, the projection cuts the screen in points lying on an extension of J\x{2032}K\x{2032}, and we have already established that when the eye looks toward infinity on JK, the projection cuts the screen at D1. Hence J\x{2032}K\x{2032} must go through D1. We now have another important result. The image of any horizontal line which makes an angle of 45\x{b0} with the screen must go through the point D1 which lies on the screen, on the same level as E, but is as far to the right of the principal vanishing point as E is from the principal vanishing point.

Actually this pleasure is denied to us. Perhaps Desargues\x{2019} novel terminology baffled his contemporaries just as many people today are baffled and repulsed by the language of mathematics. At any rate, except for Descartes, Pascal, and Fermat, Desargues\x{2019} colleagues exhibited the usual reactions to radical ideas: they dismissed them, called Desargues crazy, and forgot projective geometry. Desargues himself became discouraged and returned to the practice of architecture and engineering. Every printed copy of Desargues\x{2019} book, originally published in 1639, was lost. Pascal\x{2019}s work on conics and his other studies on projective geometry, though published in 1640, also remained unknown until <<almost 1800|9c:0>>. Fortunately, a pupil of Desargues, Philippe de La Hire, made a manuscript copy of Desargues\x{2019} book which was accidentally picked up in a bookshop by the nineteenth-century geometer Michel Chasles, and thus the world finally learned the full extent of Desargues\x{2019} major work. Apart from some results which La Hire used and which were incorrectly credited to him for 150 years, Desargues\x{2019} and Pascal\x{2019}s discoveries had to be remade one by one by the nineteenth-century geometers.",

The clue lies in the fact that a curve is after all but a collection of points satisfying some condition. For example, the circle is the set of all points at a fixed distance from a given point. The principle of duality suggests, then, that the figure dual to a given curve might be a collection of lines satisfying the condition dual to the condition defining the given curve. (However the definition given for the circle is not in the form which can be dualized.)

This conjecture is correct. The clue to the relationship between the two geometries may be obtained by again examining projection and section. Consider a geometric figure, a rectangle say (Fig. <<11\x{2013}14|5a:0>>). Let a projection of this figure be formed from an arbitrary point O, and then let a section of this projection be made by a plane parallel to the plane of the rectangle.

This last type of projection, called parallel projection, thus yields congruent sections. In other words, from the standpoint of projective geometry, the relationships of congruence and similarity which are so intensively studied in Euclidean geometry can be studied through projection and section for special projections.

We see, for example, that (a, b) and (\x{2013}a, b) are symmetrically placed with respect to the Y-axis. What we have learned so far is that if the ellipse contains a point (a, b) which lies in the first quadrant, it contains the point (\x{2013}a, b) which is symmetrically situated with respect to the Y-axis; it contains the point (a, \x{2013}b) which is symmetrically situated with respect to the X-axis; and it contains the point (\x{2013}a, \x{2013}b) which is symmetric to (\x{2013}a, b) with respect to the X-axis. Hence, if we can determine which points lie on the ellipse in the first quadrant, we can, by symmetry, decide what the ellipse looks like in the other three quadrants.",

The increasing scientific activity, particularly in an age which had decided to measure and to seek quantitative laws, created the need for convenient, accurate methods of measuring time. Moreover, as we have already had occasion to mention in other connections, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were concerned with the very practical problem of improving the method by which ships determined their longitude at sea. Here a good clock is the simplest answer. Suppose that the longitude of a given place on land is known and that a ship has on board a clock set to agree with the time prevailing at that given locality. Since the earth turns through 360\x{b0} of longitude in one day, it turns through 15\x{b0} in each hour. Hence for each 15\x{b0} that a ship is west, say, of the fixed locale, <<midday|13>> occurs one hour later compared to the time at the fixed position on land. If a ship\x{2019}s officer notes (by means of the sun\x{2019}s position) when <<midday|13>> occurs at his position at sea and finds, for example, that his clock reads <<3 o\x{2019}clock|6>> whereas it should, of course, read <<12 o\x{2019}clock|6>>, he knows that the longitude of his position is 45\x{b0} west of the given reference locality on land.

Such a function, even if it were suitable in all other respects, could not represent the motion of a bob whose maximum displacement is 2 or 3, say. This difficulty is easily obviated. Now that we have y = sin A, we can readily manufacture hundreds of new functions whose amplitudes are whatever we choose to make them. Consider, for example, y = 2 sin A. How does this function behave compared to y = sin A? The answer is immediate. For any value of A, y = 2 sin A is twice as much as y = sin A. Thus when A = \x{3c0}/4 or 45\x{b0}, sin A = 0.71, and 2 sin A is <<1.42|5a:0>>. Figure 18\x{2013}10 shows how y = 2 sin A looks compared to y = sin A.

Indeed, it goes back to the very first emergence of any real mathematics and science, namely the beginning of the classical Greek period.

The lower note in each case originates with the longer string. They also designed musical scales whose notes, as measured quantitatively by the lengths of the vibrating strings, possessed precise numerical values. From Pythagorean times onward, mathematicians and scientists were convinced that musical sounds had important mathematical properties, and music, along with arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, became part of the quadrivium. These four subjects were studied together right through the medieval period. Although Greek, Arab, and medieval mathematicians continued to investigate musical sounds and wrote books on music, their work was essentially limited to the construction of new systems of scales for instrumental and vocal music.',

The concepts of ethics, politics, economics, and philosophy would be the analogues of numbers, and the relationships among these concepts would be the analogues of the operations of arithmetic. They referred to this plan as a universal algebra. The work of Descartes and Leibniz was not successful because they undertook too much. (One can hardly imagine learned Republican and Democratic algebraists sitting down to calculate the solution of a vexing political problem by means of some system of algebra.) It is not likely that the ideas of disciplines such as philosophy and economics can be compactly represented by symbols and the reasoning performed by suitable algebraic operations.

            "The possible outcomes, that is, the possible numbers of those remaining alive without treatment among 20 afflicted people, are precisely the same as the possible outcomes in a throw of 20 coins. Just as the number of heads which may show up can vary from <<0 to 20|10a:0>>, so among the 20 people, none may live beyond the specified period, one may, and so on up to 20. Since the probability that any one person will remain alive is the same as that of tossing a head on a single throw, the probabilities of the various outcomes will be the same in the two situations. Hence the mean number of those remaining alive is () \x{b7} 20, or 10. The standard deviation of this distribution is . In our case,",

The student should learn that mathematics was not created once and for all in some ancient time but that there have been successive periods of development and these have been tied to and stimulated by problems and movements of various civilizations. The civilizations which should be discussed are the Egyptian and Babylonian, the classical Greek, the Alexandrian Greek, the Roman, the Hindu and Arabic, the medieval, and Western European since <<about 1400|18:0>>. The Roman and medieval civilizations are singular because despite achievements in other areas, they were nonproductive in mathematics. These exceptional cases could provoke a discussion of what factors in a civilization promote mathematical activity. The question cannot be answered at this stage but students might be asked to keep this in mind and to note that the answer is important because it would tell us what we must do in our civilization to foster mathematics.',
