She had found that she could not provide Carol the constant care she needed, so she traveled to the U.S. and installed her daughter in the Vineland Training Center in New Jersey. Pearl had also concluded that her marriage could not be salvaged. Though she did not file for divorce until <<1935|9c:0>>, she had told Lossing Buck that she intended to leave him several years before that.',

The wheat had borne and been cut and the field flooded and the young rice set, and now the rice bore harvest, and the ears were ripe and full after the summer rains and the warm ripening sun of early autumn. Together they cut the sheaves all day, bending and cutting with short-handled scythes. She had stooped stiffly, because of the burden she bore, and she moved more slowly than he, so that they cut unevenly, his row ahead, and hers behind. She began to cut more and more slowly as <<noon|13>> wore on to afternoon and evening, and he turned to look at her with impatience. She stopped and stood up then, her scythe dropped.

At first, after he had dug the silver from the wall and taken it to the great house, after the honor of speaking as an equal to the Old Lord\'s equal was past, he was visited with a depression of spirit which was almost regret. When he thought of the hole in the wall now empty that had been filled with silver he need not use, he wished that he had his silver back. After all, this land, it would take hours of labor again, and as O-lan said, it was far away, more than a li which is a third of a mile. And again, the buying of it had not been quite so filled with glory as he had anticipated. He had gone too early to the great house and the Old Lord was still sleeping.
