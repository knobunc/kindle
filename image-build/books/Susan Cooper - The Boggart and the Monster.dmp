            'ELEVENANGUS CAMERON HAD BEEN very busy in the last few hours. By <<two|9:1>> separate special messengers, arranged at huge cost which he hoped would be reimbursed, he had sent his first pictures of the Monster to the Glasgow Herald and his first videotape to Scottish Television, with a careful stipulation that he himself was to keep the world rights of each. Since there had been no time to process either the film or the tape, he had no idea whether his pictures were hopelessly blurred or amazingly clear, but his hopes were high.',

And his video film was to be the lead story of the <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> television news, at stations not only in Scotland but in England, Ireland, France, Germany and the U.S.A.
