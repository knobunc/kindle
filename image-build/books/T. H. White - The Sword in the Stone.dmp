            'SIR  ECTOR\'S  home  was  called  The  Castle  of  the  Forest  Sauvage.  It was more like a town or a village  than  any  one  man\'s  home,  and  indeed  it was the  village  during  all  times  of  danger.  Whenever  there  was  a  raid  or an invasion, everybody on the estate  hurried  into  the  castle,  driving  all the beasts  before  them  into  the  courts,  and  there  they  remained  until  the danger  was  over.  The  little  wattle  and  daub  cottages  nearly  always  got burned, and had to be built again afterwards with much profanity.  For  this reason  it  was  not  worth  while  troubling  to  have  a  village  church,  as  it would constantly be having to be replaced. The villagers  went  to church  in the  chapel  of the  castle.  They  wore  their  best  clothes  and  trooped  up  the street with their most respectable gait on Sundays, looking  with  vague  and dignified  looks in  all directions,  as if  reluctant  to  disclose  their  destination, and  on  week-days  they  came  to  mass  and  <<vespers|13>>  in  their  ordinary clothes, walking much more cheerfully. Everybody  went  to church  in  those days, and liked it.',

            'It ought  perhaps  to be  explained,  before  we  go  any  further,  that  in those  far-off  days,  when  there  was  actually  a  college  for  Witches  and Warlocks  under  the  sea  at  Dom-Daniel  and  when  all  wizards  were  either black  or  white,  there  was  a  good  deal  of  ill-feeling  between  the  different creeds.  Quarrels  between  white  and  black  were  settled  ceremonially,  by means of duels. A wizard\'s duel was run like this.  The  two principals  would stand opposite each other in some large  space  free  from  obstructions,  and await the  signal  to begin.  When  the  signal  was  given  they  were  at  liberty to  turn  themselves  into  things.  It  was  rather  like  the  game  that  can  be played  by  two  people  with  their  fists.  They  say  One,  Two,  Three,  and  at <<Three|9:1>>  they  either  stick  out  two  fingers  for  scissors,  or  the  flat  palm  for paper,  or  the  clenched  fist  for  stone.  If  your  hand  becomes  paper  when your  opponent\'s  become  scissors,  then  he  cuts  you  and  wins:  but  if  yours has  turned  into  stone,  his scissors  are  blunted,  and  the  win  is  yours.  The object  of  the  wizard  in  the  duel  was,  to  turn  himself  into  some  kind  of animal,  vegetable  or  mineral  which  would  destroy  the  particular  animal, vegetable or mineral which had been selected by his opponent. Sometimes it went on for hours.',
