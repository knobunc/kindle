There were dozens of big houses arrayed on the slopes around it, the most expensive and exclusive in the town, though they didn\x{2019}t match its grandeur.

Often, when he looked out, Ozzie would see great swathes of them smashed and shattered, leaving jagged stumps surrounded by a pile of ice-encrusted branches. There were narrow steep saddle valleys to surmount, where their speed was reduced to a painful crawl on the ascent, only to degenerate into a mad slither downwards, more abrupt and frightening than the trip down from the massif.
