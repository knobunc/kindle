The right pH (potential of Hydrogen) is important to your trees because it determines the point at which they will make maximum use of the nutrients in the soil. Using samples of topsoil uncovered during the percolation test, check the pH rating with a soil test kit, which determines the alkaline-acid balance of the soil. These are available from state agricultural services or garden supply stores. This pH measurement is a simple scale in which the number 7 represents a neutral soil; numbers above 7 indicate increasing alkalinity, and those below, increasing acidity. Some grains prefer a \x{201c}sweet\x{201d} soil of 7 or 8, while blueberries do best in extremely acidic soil, <<around 4|9:0>>. Apple trees grow best in slightly acidic soils, about pH 6.",

Then, the still maker multiplies circumference by coil total to get the length of tubing needed. An additional three or four feet is included for the neck and another four or five inches for the drip-spout.

In 1840, the Whig Party nominated William Henry Harrison as its candidate for president, and the campaign symbol was a barrel of cider. This \x{201c}Cider Campaign,\x{201d} in which the Whigs served free cider to all who could or would vote, brought Harrison to a landslide victory.
