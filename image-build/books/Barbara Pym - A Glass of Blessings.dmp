            'I decided to wait for a bus to take me to the shops, and when the right one came I went on the top and sat looking down into the street. We had not gone very far before I saw Piers about to enter what could not by any stretch of the imagination have been his place of work, for it was a pub, or rather a \'wine lodge\' - one of those attractively named places of refreshment which seem to have an almost poetic air about them like the Portuguese quintas - and indeed the comparison was not inappropriate, for Piers and his sister had been brought up in Portugal where their father had been in the wine trade. I began to look back over what I could remember of Piers\'s career. He had been at Oxford or Cambridge but had got a disappointingly low class in his final examinations. He had taught in a school, been a courier with a travel agency, worked for a time in the B.B.C., and helped in the compilation of a Portuguese dictionary. It was from the title page of this work that I had gleaned some further information, for he was described as \'Piers Longridge, B.A., late of the British Museum, sometime lecturer in English Literature\' at a college in Portugal whose name I could not remember - and now creeping into a wine lodge at <<two o\'clock in the afternoon|6>> when he had told me that he was going back to work. How the glory had departed, if glory it had ever been! The words \'late\' and \'sometime\' seemed all of a sudden rather sad; and Piers himself, glimpsed from the bus, a rather shambling figure, more worn and less glamorous than he had seemed in the kindlier light of the church. I noticed that he did not go in immediately to have his drink but lurked outside on the pavement, gazing into the road and then at a line of parked cars in what seemed a very odd way. Then I remembered Rowena telling me about his obsession with car numbers which he either collected in simple numerical order or used in more complicated games, such as spotting a car with his own initials and adding up the numbers that followed it to see if they were \'propitious\'. It seemed a foolish game for a grown man to play, and I felt mean to have caught him at his folly, to be spying on him as it were. I was glad when the bus moved on and I saw him at last enter the wine lodge.',

Perhaps the sound of spoons clattering in saucers and the rattle of the trolley would already be audible along the corridors of the Ministry where Rodney and James Cash worked; at this very moment they might be taking their mugs out of drawers or cupboards. I sometimes liked to imagine myself in a small cosy office where a little group of women might gather in a room, drinking tea and eating biscuits, discussing the iniquities of the Boss. I could picture the boss himself coming bursting into the room, perhaps with an ill-typed letter in his hand, and the cool stares of the women as they stood with their teacups in their hands, letting him have his say, putting him out of countenance with their insolent detachment, so that his wrath smouldered out like a damp squib and he was left floundering and stammering.',

This seemed to be rather presumptuous, for the new curate might well have a hearty appetite and would surely deserve more than a light breakfast after saying an early Mass. The letter then returned to spiritual matters - the attendances at Solemn <<Evensong|13>> and Devotions were lamentably poor, it was really hardly worth while for Mr Fasnidge the organist to come all the way from Peckham - and ended with hopes for better things in the Church\'s New Year. But then an agitated postscript had been added. \'Oh dear me, Mrs Greenhill, our housekeeper, has just come into my study and told me that she will have to leave - she has been finding the work too much, and then there is her fibrositis. Well, perhaps we are all finding the work too much for us. Now we are really in the soup! Prayers, please, and practical help.

I could think of nobody else who would have been likely to. The circumstances fitted so well and it was just-the kind of unusual and imaginative thing he might do. It was tantalizing not to be able to see him and find out and even to follow up its implications, whatever they might be, for I could not know his mood when he had sent it. I could only think that he must have been walking in some street where there were antique shops - not, somehow, the Goldhawk Road - and had seen the box in a window and thought it would be just right for me, being the kind of thing I liked and the words so appropriate to my refusal or inability to spend an evening with him.

Books I had expected to see, and there were certainly a great many including some well bound sets of the English poets, and Dante and Goethe. I wondered whether in his youth Father Thames had been one of those preachers who adorn their sermons with quotations, like a certain Archdeacon Hoccleve who had been a distant cousin of my mother\'s and who even sometimes took as his text a phrase from one of our greater English poets. Such sermons seemed to have gone out of fashion, for all we got from Father Thames now was ten minutes\' rather dry teaching on such topics as \'The Significance of <<Evensong|13>>\', or little nagging perorations about why we ought to go to confession.
