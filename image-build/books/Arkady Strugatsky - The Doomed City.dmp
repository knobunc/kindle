            "Herr Hofstadter, a greengrocer from Erfurt, had been filled with hope all his life, and all his life he had been unlucky. When in 1932 some Jew made a beggar of him by opening a large, modern greengrocer\x{2019}s shop across the street from his, Hofstadter realized that he was a true German and joined a brigade of storm troopers. In the storm troopers he was on the point of making a career, and in 1934 he personally pummeled the face of the aforementioned Jew and was about to close in on his business enterprise, but then came the disaster of R\x{f6}hm\x{2019}s denunciation and Hofstadter was purged. And by that time he was\x{a0}already married, and his charming little blonde-haired Elsa was already\x{a0}growing up. He managed to get by more or less for a few more years, then he was called up into the army and was about to embark on the conquest of Europe, but at Dunkirk he was bombed by his own side\x{2019}s planes and received a massive piece of shrapnel in the lungs, so that instead of ending up in Paris, he found himself in a military hospital in Dresden, where he lay until <<1945|9c:0>> and was on the point of being discharged when the Allied air forces made their famous raid that destroyed Dresden in a single night. The horror he experienced made all his hair fall out, and he went a bit crazy, according to the way that he himself told the story. So after finding himself back in his native Erfurt, he sat out the most hectic period, when it was still possible to decamp to the\x{a0}West, in the cellar of his little house. When he finally plucked up the courage to emerge into the light of day, everything was all over. Admittedly, they did allow him to run a greengrocer\x{2019}s shop, but any kind of expansion of the business was out of the question. In \x{2019}46 his wife died, and in his clouded state of mind he yielded to the blandishments of a Mentor and, without really understanding the choice that he was making, moved here, where he had improved a bit, but to this day he still seemed to suspect that he had ended up in a large, specialized concentration camp somewhere in Central Asia, to which all the Germans from East Germany had been exiled. His brainbox still hadn\x{2019}t been restored to completely normal functioning: he adored genuine Germans and was convinced that he had a special nose for detecting them, and he was mortally afraid of Chinese, Arabs, and blacks, whose presence here he didn\x{2019}t understand and couldn\x{2019}t explain, but above all he worshipped and adored Herr Heiger. The point was that during one of Heiger\x{2019}s first visits to Hofstadter\x{2019}s, while the greengrocer was filling the bag, the brilliant Fritz had briefly flirted, soldier fashion, with blonde-haired Elsa, who had been driven to a frenzy by the lack of any prospect of a decent marriage. And from that moment a blinding hope had been conceived in the heart of the insane, bald Hofstadter\x{2014}the hope that this magnificent Aryan, a staunch supporter of the f\x{fc}hrer and scourge of the Jews, would at long last escort the unfortunate Hofstadter family out of turbulently heaving seas into some quiet backwater.",
