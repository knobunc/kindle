            "There is a court that John and Elizabeth Proctor fear. It is <<one|9f>>, moreover, which if it has no power to sentence them to death does nonetheless command their lives. Proctor says to his wife, \x{201c}I come into a court when I come into this house!\x{201d} Elizabeth, significantly, replies, \x{201c}The magistrate sits in your heart that judges you.\x{201d} Court and magistrate are simply synonyms for guilt. The challenge for John Proctor is to transform guilt into conscience and responsibility. Guilt renders him powerless, as it had Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman; individual conscience restores personal integrity and identity, and places him at the center of social action. Miller has remarked of Proctor, \x{201c}I suppose I had been searching a long time for a tragic hero, and now  I had him; the Salem story was not going to be abandoned. The longer I worked the more certain I felt that improbable as it might seem, there were moments when an individual conscience was all that could keep the world from falling apart.\x{201d}",
