But this flawless afternoon in June knows nothing of them yet: from the dovecot beyond the home orchard floats the drowsiest of all English sounds: the jackdaws wheel to the same lazy tempo above the elm walk; a bell in the distant stables chimes <<four|11>>; Scamnum slumbers. On the hill no tourist, field-glass in hand, disturbs the gently nibbling sheep or speculates on such activity as Scamnum reveals. There is no one to identify as the Duke the little knicker-bockered figure who has paused to speak to a gardener by the lily-pond; no one to recognize in the immaculately breeched and booted youth sauntering up from the stables Noel Yvon Meryon Gylby, a scion of the house; no one to guess that the tall figure strolling down the drive is his old tutor Giles Gott, the eminent Elizabethan scholar, or that the beautiful girl, looking thoughtfully after him from the terrace, is the Lady Elizabeth Crispin. Nobody knows that the restless man with the black box is not a photographer from the Queen but an American philologist. And nobody knows that the Rolls-Royce approaching the south lodge contains the Lord High Chancellor of England, come down to play a prank with his old friend Anne Dillon, the present Duchess of Horton.',

            "Much was to depend on the rapidity and continuity of action which the reconstructed Elizabethan stage made possible. The play was to begin at <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>; there was to be one interval only, taken at the end of the second act; it was to be over <<just before midnight|10>>. There was no scenery to change, and few properties to manipulate. Now on one and now on another of the three stage spaces \x{2013} front stage, rear stage, upper stage \x{2013} the action would run smoothly forward. As the first scene, \x{2018}The Battlements of Elsinore\x{2019}, ended on the upper stage, Claudius and his court would enter in procession for Scene Two, \x{2018}The Council Chamber in the Castle\x{2019}, on the front stage. And as soon as the last characters in this scene had made their exit the curtain of the rear stage would be drawn back, revealing Laertes and Ophelia in Scene Three, \x{2018}A Room in the House of Polonius\x{2019}. The curtain would no sooner be drawn again on this than Hamlet and his companions would appear \x{2018}aloft\x{2019} for the meeting with the Ghost in Scene Four. In this way the play was assured something of the impetus it enjoyed three hundred years ago. An audience accustomed to the constant dropping of a curtain over a proscenium-arch and to a succession of elaborate stage sets might be disconcerted for a time, but they would be seeing Hamlet played in the manner in which Shakespeare himself had played in it.",

Would Lord Auldearn not have noticed it himself if it had been in the car throughout the journey? And would he not have been likely to notice its being tossed in? No, said Williams; his Lordship was distinctly short-sighted and often failed to notice more conspicuous things than a ball of paper. If they had not picked up Mr Gott he would certainly have found it himself sooner or later; probably on handing out to the footmen on arrival. And, of course, he would have given it to his lordship; he would not take the responsibility of destroying what might be of consequence.

Anyone could have gone down in the middle of the night, set the machine going, slipped through the door, and returned to an upper corridor by more than one pair of service stairs. Scamnum was a building made for such tricks. And in the alarm, occasioned by the pealing bell, nobody had been on the look-out for suspicious movements. From all this there was derivable only one inference: the Black Hand had a fair familiarity with the house. Which told one really nothing. So far, Appleby said to himself, the enemy was winning all along the line.",

The most important witness here was not available; it would be some time before Bunney could again be on speaking terms with the world. But significant facts were to be gleaned. Bunney had arrived after luncheon on Friday and had lost no time in bringing his machine into play \x{2013} as Gott had discovered on the terrace before dinner. Mysterious phonetic nicety apart, there was nothing particularly novel about the machine, except that it combined recording and reproducing units in an unusually compact way. But Bunney, being proud of it, hawked it round. Late on Friday night he had been demonstrating to all comers in the library; in the library <<just short of midnight|10>>, the somewhat reluctant Bagot had repeated the Lord\x{2019}s Prayer; and in the library, finally, the machine had been left for the night. The Black Hand had merely to walk in. Which was not helpful, thought Appleby \x{2013} and turned to his last chance.",

            "So that was it. That was why Gervase had received his message when he did. There was one day in the year on which anybody could send off a telegram from the little post office of Scamnum Ducis without the slightest chance of being remembered. And that was on the day of the local race-meeting, when the village became an artery for streams of cars, and when scores of these stopped hourly at the post office to enable their owners to wire or telephone bets. Not only could anyone have driven down from London or anywhere else and sent the telegram in perfect safety; anyone from Scamnum could safely have sent it too. For there had been two strange assistants working hard, and the Duke himself could have handed a telegram to one of these without anyone being the wiser. And, finally, the message had been handed over the counter, not telephoned. The old person found it without difficulty, duly endorsed as having been despatched at <<two-fifteen p.m.|5>> It was a common telegraph form with the message pencilled in neat block capitals \x{2013} a thing with which nothing could be done outside a fairy-story.",

            "Appleby walked back to Scamnum with the feeling that in the matter of the messages he had come off second-best. All he had gained was certain exiguous facts of time and place. Setting aside the thoughts of agents and accomplices, he had it that the Black Hand had been in Scamnum Duds post office at <<two-fifteen|3b>> on the Monday before the murders and that a few days later \x{2013} on the Friday \x{2013} he had been either outside Auldearn\x{2019}s London home <<just after two|10>> or in the neighbourhood of the Scamnum south lodge <<just after four|10>> or \x{2013} less probably \x{2013} somewhere on the route between these places at the time of the passing of Auldearn\x{2019}s car. But this information, if slight, was not valueless; it might serve to eliminate \x{2013} at least in a tentative way \x{2013} this person and that from what was an alarmingly large body of suspects. And in conjunction with the other similar tests a good deal of progress might be made. Take, for example, Malloch as a suspect. One would ask could he, on his verifiable movements, have (a) thrown the message into the car, (b) sent the telegram, (c) shot Auldearn, (d) stabbed Bose, and (e) attacked Bunney. By this means, laborious as it would be to apply to over a score of people, one should get a long way. And this was a fact that the murderer must have reckoned on; it was his rashness again. And suddenly Appleby halted in his stride; he thought it likely that he had got somewhere already \x{2013} and not where he wanted to be.",

            "\x{2018}Yes, sir. I\x{2019}ll begin with the first murder, although there are earlier events to be considered. Lord Auldearn was shot through the heart just on <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> last night. Owing to the construction of what they call the rear stage no one could see what happened, with the probable exception of the prompter \x{2013} the Indian gentleman \x{2013} who seems to have paid for his knowledge with his life. But we have a certain amount of evidence as to what occurred, nevertheless. There is the remarkable fact that the shot was not fired from the shelter of the double curtains: the experts swear to that on the strength of the powder-marks. Just conceivably the shot might have come from above when Lord Auldearn was in the act of lying down; in other words, just conceivably the shot might have come from the painter, Mr Cope. But it seems more likely that the shot was fired by a person who walked straight across the rear stage to effect it \x{2013} risking the observation of the prompter in doing so. There may have been a moment\x{2019}s struggle or flurried movement, because an iron cross was knocked off what they call, I think, the faldstool; or this may have happened when the murderer was making his hurried escape back to the curtains. We must notice that the revolver \x{2013} a small foreign weapon which it will not be easy to trace \x{2013} was carried off the scene of the shooting and hidden in a very odd spot in this green-room here. And there\x{2019}s a point where I differ from you a little, sir. You see that as evidence of deliberate hardihood \x{2013} one of a number of such. pieces of evidence. But whatever we may think of placing the gun in the skull, I feel that carrying it away would be automatic. Calculation would no doubt tell the murderer to drop it before attempting his getaway through the curtains \x{2013} I admit that. But calcution may not have come in. It isn\x{2019}t a man\x{2019}s instinct to drop a gun after firing; he makes off, gun and all.\x{2019}",
