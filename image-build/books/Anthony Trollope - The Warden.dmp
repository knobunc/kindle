            "Ever since Edmund Wilson\x{2019}s essay on Dickens in The Wound and the Bow (1941), critics have made much of Dickens\x{2019}s passionate resentment of the months he spent in the blacking-factory as a child. One sometimes wonders, though, whether Trollope did not suffer more in absolute terms from his prolonged experience of lost caste, but since he wrote no Bildungsroman like David Copperfield or Great Expectations the influence of the experience can be sensed only indirectly in his fiction, as for example in the remarkable description of the sufferings of \x{2018}poor gentry\x{2019} in Chapter 9 of The Last Chronicle of Barset (1867). Certainly he responded to it very differently. If the blacking-factory and the debtors\x{2019} prison made Dickens a rebel and a social reformer, the humiliations of Harrow and Winchester made Trollope, in part of himself, a passionate conformist, hungry for social acceptance. The man who could write of his \x{2018}exceeding longing\x{2019} to join in cricket and rackets, of the \x{2018}Elysium\x{2019} of being able to make friends with his contemporaries on a basis of equality, was no disdainful aesthete, and the story of his life is \x{2013} from one point of view \x{2013} the story of someone who had lost caste in his youth making his way slowly back into the Elysium of gentlemen. Nothing illustrates this ambition better than the efforts that this \x{2018}incorrigible dunce\x{2019} made to teach himself Latin in adult life, thereby redeeming the schoolboy\x{2019}s failure to acquire the classical learning that was the hallmark of the gentleman. (There is something of the same impulse at work in the touchingly modest claim at the end of the Autobiography not \x{2018}to any literary excellence\x{2019} but \x{2018}to whatever merit should be accorded to me for persevering diligence in my profession\x{2019} in writing forty-seven novels.) Hence the gregarious, fox-hunting figure who emerges from contemporary recollections of Trollope: the conscientious civil servant and part-time author, frequenter of clubs and rider to hounds, with his high colour, loud laugh, boisterous spirits and gesticulating manner \x{2013} almost as if he were trying to live up to his idea of the hearty English squire. Hence, too, the no-nonsense portrait of the artist in the Autobiography, where aspiring writers are advised to stick to their desks \x{2018}as though they were lawyer\x{2019}s clerks\x{2019} and the legendary Trollope routine was posthumously revealed: at the desk by <<5.30 a.m.|2a>>, three hours writing at <<250|3:0>> words every quarter of an hour by the clock, ten pages a day \x{2013} a rate, he reckoned, which would have enabled him to complete three three-volume novels a year, if the market could have stood it \x{2013} then off to the Post Office for a day\x{2019}s work.",

            "The conservative cleric, the reformer, and the newspaper editor all speak and think in the abstract public language of rights and principles, which cannot begin to deal with the complex individual case of Mr Harding. His language, on the other hand, is wordless and intuitive, the language of his beloved cello, which is soon silenced by his troubles and turns into the soundless mime which is \x{2018}his constant consolation in conversational troubles\x{2019} (p. 39). Literature, which should be able to link the public and the private languages, is shown in the case of Dr Pessimist Anticant (Carlyle) and Mr Popular Sentiment (Dickens) to be merely a melodramatic form of journalism. Like the reformers and the conservatives, these writers can take only a single-minded and one-dimensional view of the issue. The majority of Trollope\x{2019}s critics have found these parodies a mistake and a blemish. My own view is that the parody of Carlyle, at least, scores some palpable hits at the expense of a writer who by the time of Latter-Day Pamphlets (1850) had shot his bolt and was starting to parody himself. But this, as Ruth apRoberts wisely remarks, is not the point: \x{2018}Whether these parodies succeed or not \x{2013} whether they are good as parodies and whether they are decorous \x{2013} they are altogether functional. Trollope is defining, by negatives, what he himself would do.\x{2019}<<13|5g:0>> By deploring in his own trade the moral simplifications he attacks in Bold and the Jupiter, Trollope was writing an incidental manifesto for the kind of sympathetic, quiet-voiced realism which from The Warden onwards was to be the mark of his own work.",

Cardinal Thomas Wolsey (1474?\x{2013}1530) became Archbishop of York in 1514 and Henry VIII\x{2019}s Lord Chancellor in 1515; he was successful in foreign affairs until he failed to achieve papal approval for Henry\x{2019}s divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and in 1530 he was arrested for high treason, dying on his way to London to face trial.

            "Hiram\x{2019}s Hospital, as the retreat is called, is a picturesque building enough, and shows the correct taste with which the ecclesiastical architects of those days were imbued. It stands on the banks of the little river which flows nearly round the cathedral close, being on the side furthest from the town. The London road crosses the river by a pretty one-arched bridge, and, looking from this bridge, the stranger will see the windows of the old men\x{2019}s rooms, each pair of windows separated by a small buttress. A broad gravel walk runs between the building and the river, which is always trim and cared for; and at the end of the walk, under the parapet of the approach to the bridge, is a large and well-worn seat, on which, in mild weather, three or four of Hiram\x{2019}s bedesmen are sure to be seen seated. Beyond this row of buttresses, and further from the bridge, and also further from the water which here suddenly bends, are the pretty oriel windows of Mr Harding\x{2019}s house, and his well-mown lawn. The entrance to the hospital is from the London road, and is made through a ponderous gateway under a heavy stone arch, unnecessary, one would suppose, at any time, for the protection of twelve old men, but greatly conducive to the good appearance of Hiram\x{2019}s charity. On passing through this portal, never closed to anyone from <<six a.m.|5>> till <<ten p.m.|5>>, and never open afterwards, except on application to a huge, intricately hung, medieval bell, the handle of which no uninitiated intruder can possibly find, the six doors of the old men\x{2019}s abodes are seen, and beyond them is a slight iron screen, through which the more happy portion of the Barchester \x{e9}lite pass into the Elysium of Mr Harding\x{2019}s dwelling.8",

The Bishop of Barchester
BOLD at once repaired to the hospital. The day was now far advanced, but he knew that Mr Harding dined in the summer at <<four|9c:1>>, that Eleanor was accustomed to drive in the evening, and that he might therefore probably find Mr Harding alone. It was between seven and eight when he reached the slight iron gate leading into the precentor\x{2019}s garden, and though, as Mr Chadwick observed, the day had been cold for June, the evening was mild, and soft, and sweet. The little gate was open. As he raised the latch he heard the notes of Mr Harding\x{2019}s violoncello from the far end of the garden, and, advancing before the house and across the lawn, he found him playing: and not without an audience. The musician was seated in a garden chair just within the summer-house, so as to allow the violoncello which he held between his knees to rest upon the dry stone flooring; before him stood a rough music desk, on which was open a page of that dear sacred book, that much-laboured and much-loved volume of church music, which had cost so many guineas; and around sat, and lay, and stood, and leaned, ten of the twelve old men who dwelt with him beneath old John Hiram\x{2019}s roof. The two reformers were not there. I will not say that in their hearts they were conscious of any wrong done or to be done to their mild warden, but latterly they had kept aloof from him, and his music was no longer to their taste.",

Yes, from this time he never again admitted the name by which he had been so familiarly known, and in which, to tell the truth, he had rejoiced. The love of titles is common to all men, and a vicar or fellow is as pleased at becoming Mr Archdeacon or Mr Provost, as a lieutenant at getting his captaincy, or a city tallow-chandler in becoming Sir John on the occasion of a Queen\x{2019}s visit to a new bridge. But warden he was no longer, and the name of precentor, though the office was to him so dear, confers in itself no sufficient distinction; our friend, therefore, again became Mr Harding.",

It must take some time to get out of one house into another; the curate at Crabtree could not be abolished under six months, that is, unless other provision could be made for him; and then the furniture \x{2013} the most of that must be sold to pay Sir Abraham Haphazard for sitting up till <<twelve at night|9a>>. Mr Harding was strangely ignorant as to lawyers\x{2019} bills; he had no idea, from twenty pounds to two thousand, as to the sum in which he was indebted for legal assistance. True, he had called in no lawyer himself; true, he had been no consenting party to the employment of either Cox and Cummins, or Sir Abraham; he had never been consulted on such matters \x{2013} the archdeacon had managed all this himself, never for a moment suspecting that Mr Harding would take upon him to end the matter in a way of his own. Had the lawyers\x{2019} bills been ten thousand pounds, Mr Harding could not have helped it; but he was not on that account disposed to dispute his own liability. The question never occurred to him; but it did occur to him that he had very little money at his banker\x{2019}s, that he could receive nothing further from the hospital, and that the sale of the furniture was his only resource.",
