Do mufflers fall off cars? Something fell off ours and it looks suspiciously like one. Mr. Hinshore recommended a garage in Taunton, so I\x{2019}ve driven over there to see if they can stick it back on again. 

Curses, we\x{2019}re not alone after all. A couple of archaeologists have moved in and one of them (I forget his name*) says he knows you.

But don\x{2019}t get your hopes up too high. Nate really has behaved like a fool. Robyn believes he should be drummed out of the corps entirely, and\x{2026} well, to be perfectly frank, I think the poor dumb bastard has it coming.\" He colored slightly at this excess. \"I don\x{2019}t know what your surprise is, but I hope it\x{2019}s a good one.\"",

Gideon stood up\x{2014}a little too suddenly; his vision blurred and a hundred places in his body twinged and burned, as if he\x{2019}d been rubbed all over with heavy-grade sandpaper. But he was anxious to get going. There were still plenty of things he didn\x{2019}t understand, but now he had a personal score to settle and he wanted to get on with it.
\"Let\x{2019}s go,\" he said to Julie. \"It\x{2019}s <<after eight|9f>>.\"
Conley looked startled. \"But \x{2026}you can\x{2019}t simply go like that\x{2026}.You must let me\x{2014}here, let me write down my name and address.\" He pulled over a notepad that had been near the telephone and began scribbling. \"I absolutely insist that all bills be sent to me.
