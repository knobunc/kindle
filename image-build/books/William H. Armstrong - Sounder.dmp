            "Finally the great clock on the roof of the courthouse struck <<twelve|11>>. It frightened the boy because it seemed to shake the town. Now the red-faced man opened the door and let several people in. Inside, the man lined everybody up and felt their clothes and pockets. He jerked the cardboard box from the boy and tore off the top. The boy could hear iron doors opening and closing. Long hallways, with iron bars from floor to ceiling, ran from the door into the dim center of the building. The man with the red face squeezed the cake in his hands and broke it into four pieces. \x{201c}This could have a steel file or hacksaw blade in it,\x{201d} he said. Then he swore and threw the pieces back in the box. The boy had been very hungry. Now he was not hungry. He was afraid. The man shoved the box into the boy\x{2019}s hands and swore again. Part of the cake fell to the floor; it was only a box of crumbs now. The man swore again and made the boy pick up the crumbs from the floor.",

            "A great part of the way home the boy walked in darkness. In the big houses he saw beautiful lights and candles in the windows. Several times dogs rushed to the front gates and barked as he passed. But no stray pup came to him along the lonely, empty stretches of road. In the dark he thought of the bull-necked man crumpled on the floor in the cake crumbs, like the strangled bull in the cattle chute, and he walked faster. At <<one|9m:0>> big house the mailbox by the road had a lighted lantern hanging on it. The boy walked on the far side of the road so he wouldn\x{2019}t show in the light. \x{201c}People hangs \x{2019}em out when company is comin\x{2019} at night,\x{201d} the boy\x{2019}s father had once told him.",
