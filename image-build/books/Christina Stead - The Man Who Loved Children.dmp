He struggled unaided except by iced water, through the drowsiness of the siesta hours, trying to write his impressions and articles for papers back home (he very much admired the profession of the journalist, thinking him a good retail purveyor of enlightenment); and <<about five|9:1>> or <<six|20a:1>> would go home to take a shower and would sit with a bath towel round his loins, or with nothing on at all but a clout, while he wrote up his diary or his mail for the day. But in this climate everything had become a weariness of the flesh, even writing and speaking. He, a man capable of doing walks of twenty miles on Sundays, at home, here could hardly make ten paces without feeling weak. Still he kept it up, walking round Singapore, or the other towns, or struggling through the jungle without a moan, avoiding the European streets and shops, finding the poorest, immigrant and native-born people, the ones with no home, the ones that walked the streets all night, even after nightfall and against all warnings roaming the congested streets, through dark throngs whose faces he could not see but only suspect in the flashing of an eyeball, tooth, or trinket, in the light of a shop lamp, or electric sign hanging downwards, or the frosted bleary sparkle of some miserable shopwindow, perhaps mildew-grown.',

Meanwhile, Ernie\x{2019}s lead was a standing joke, and even Henny grumbled perpetually about his \x{201c}damnfool lead collection collecting dust and making rust marks on the cement floor, under his bed.\x{201d} Sam wisely kept away from the washhouse while the children were showing their presents to Saul Pilgrim and, having nothing better to do, went into the boys\x{2019} room to smile to himself and also to step off the dimensions of a darkroom for photography that he proposed to build in one corner of it, near the kitchen sink, until such time as he could build in a bench and sink for the darkroom. He moved Ernie\x{2019}s bed, and an astonishing sight met his eyes, five or six large lumps of lead, irregularly formed, and several small ones that seemed to have been hammered out of shape. He had not looked for several weeks and had no idea how Ernie had got so much. Beside the lead were the bottles and several pieces of iron. In moving the bed, he had upset a chamber pot, and the urine, with the sight of the lead and the rust marks on the floor, caused him to begin hallooing and howling for the children, in a great state of excitement, fun, and horror. Saul Pilgrim had to come in and see how his house was kept at <<eleven in the morning|5>>; and then Sam flung out of the room with him, until the mess was cleaned up, and then once outside he began to poh! and pooh! and fooey! and fwow! at the smells and sights, while the little boys stamped around giggling, and Ernie, the cause of all this, stood aside mournfully, until Sam called him \x{201c}Glossy-eyes,\x{201d} when he turned the corner, even more mournfully, and went down to poke a stick in the sand and write his name, \x{201c}Ernest Paine Pollit.\x{201d} On the beach their shouts still reached him, \x{201c}Oh, fwow! What a pigsty!\x{201d} and then commandment, \x{201c}Goyls, clean up the stinking shop! It\x{2019}s a pigsty! It\x{2019}s a sump! It\x{2019}s a garbage tip! Chicago is a violet farm by comparison,\x{201d} then the boys giggling again, and a remark by Saul Pilgrim, and Henny shrieking out of a top window, \x{201c}What\x{2019}s the matter?\x{201d} and Sam, actually replying to her, \x{201c}Tell the dirty girls to clean up this pigsty of a house for once,\x{201d} and Henny answering (all in the tops of the trees), \x{201c}Ten maids couldn\x{2019}t clean up after the filth you slop over the house every minute,\x{201d} and Sam shouting, in a towering passion, \x{201c}You look after my house and children, or I\x{2019}ll get a separation,\x{201d} and Henny yelling, \x{201c}I couldn\x{2019}t look after your child if I had ten hands and twenty eyes. Why don\x{2019}t you stop her picking her nose?\x{201d} (For Henny had had a row with Louie ten minutes ago.) After this came a calm, during which the girls, both bawling, cleaned up the room and stripped the beds to air, while Sam, in a low, sad voice, lectured the boys outside on female sluttishness, and told them the sort of wives they must pick. \x{201c}When I saw my first baby was a girl,\x{201d} continued Sam, pathetically, \x{201c}I gave a whoop of joy, I wanted a little girl\x{2014}\x{201d}",

John Kydd made toys and, to show it, had two rocking-horse heads on his gate. He left promptly at <<seven-thirty|5b>> every morning and returned rotating on his fat legs at six every evening. In between these hours the lonely and scared old woman would often call in Louisa, who was such a big, brave girl, to keep her company. Louisa did not care for either place; they offered her nothing to eat and they reeked of eccentricity; but Junius Walker took pains to explain to her things that no one else had mentioned, ceramics, glazes, firing, and offered to teach her china painting, and as for the Kydds, no one in the neighborhood but herself had ever been invited into the frowsy, furniture-choked dwelling. Sam, always lampooning, found the Kydds and the Walkers inexhaustible sources of inspiration: every day he found new jokes about the two eccentrics. Though Louie knew them much better than he did, she saw them with his eyes, as ridiculous if not positively touched, filthy and mean-spirited to be so poor, vain to have airs and graces when so poor, superstitious to hold any religious beliefs, thickheaded to hold any political beliefs, hoity-toity to hold any esthetic beliefs, fustian to pretend to any education, when so poor. But Louie never said what was in her head and she had a kind heart; so she came down, with bare legs, and in her faded, dirty, outgrown dress, in torn underwear from her fine house on the hill, and listened for hours to the notions that these strange poor folk had about themselves. She felt at home with them. She was eccentric, ugly, and awkward, and they were quite evidently, in their lives, eccentric, ugly, and awkward. Sam had a voice, she had an ear, and these struggling, poor people, gasping just at the surface of the river, about to sink, had lives. They told her something about their lives, which were not cataclysmic, such as Pollitry lived, but lives lived in neat corpuscles, lives which only looked out, squinted-eyed, askance, dubious, through two fishy eyes. The Walkers and Kydds repelled Louie, but she was flattered that they chose her. Ernie knew all the men and women; Evie visited all the \x{201c}ladies with babies,\x{201d} as she said, and Tommy was dangerously favored: only the two oddities wanted Louie.",

She carried herself as if she were a yellow solid valise cheerfully borne by a successful commercial traveler. She carried other things with her, a light coat, an umbrella, a purse, a book, and a package. When the twins came flying down the path, she shifted the parcel to the other hand and patted them while kissing them heartily.',

            "\x{201c}And another thing,\x{201d} cried Jo, more moderately, \x{201c}I want to ask you about my income tax, Sam, about the deductions. A man came to ask me questions. I\x{2019}m perfectly sure I\x{2019}m overassessed; and I can\x{2019}t sleep at night with the pneumatic drilling in the streets; and I couldn\x{2019}t get half that price if I really tried to sell it. I\x{2019}m going to get a loan to put in improvements\x{2014}but what\x{2019}s the use really? I ought to lease it to a boardinghouse keeper who would give me my rents regularly and I shouldn\x{2019}t have to worry. It all keeps me awake and I can\x{2019}t afford to lose sleep over a lot of irresponsible people. That old woman with the rosary on her bed only comes once a fortnight to get her relief, or when she had a fight with her son-in-law. That nice German, such a decent fellow and a good tenant, is going to his homeland to see his parents. Such a studious man, nice and quiet; and those two awful Italians didn\x{2019}t work for four days. They went out on a beer party and got stinking drunk and didn\x{2019}t work. My house is simply going down, and I haven\x{2019}t time to do it up, put them out, and get decent tenants. That horrible little thing on the first floor is going to have another baby and the first one hardly with a tooth, she doesn\x{2019}t get through washing the dishes till <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> or <<twelve|20a>> and then another bedraggled girl comes with her baby carriage and there they sit in the dark, in the damp, and chatter and cook a bit of spaghetti, and that shiftless tramp with a cigarette stuck between his lips when he hasn\x{2019}t enough to eat even and the rent not paid. It makes me sick, such shiftless horrible people in the world, and they are the ones the government supports! Can you understand it, Sam? I can\x{2019}t. And in the house next to mine is a woman with a piece of land in the country, who gets relief. Isn\x{2019}t it wicked, Sam? Oh, you don\x{2019}t know what\x{2019}s going on, Sam, because you\x{2019}re in a government department and you don\x{2019}t meet people as I do. I have to meet them face to face, I have to actually speak to these awful creatures, because they are my tenants, and I have to worry about the plumbing for them. Do you think they\x{2019}re pleased with anything? No, you don\x{2019}t know a lot yourself, Sam. That\x{2019}s what I say. Don\x{2019}t throw it up at me that I\x{2019}m not married; for I could easily have been married, but I just said, \x{2018}No, no, I\x{2019}m waiting for Mr. Right.\x{2019} What do you think of that, Sam? Another baby, with one nine months old, it just makes me sick.\x{201d}",
