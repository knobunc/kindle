We sat near a door through which came sounds of voices, shouts, chairs scraping on the floor; a vague hubbub which reminded me of one of those small-town \x{201c}socials\x{201d} when, after the concert\x{2019}s over, the hall is cleared for dancing.",

After a short time, just enough for me to realize how tired I was feeling, they came for me. I was back in the same room, confronting the same faces, and the whole thing started again. But the heat had meanwhile much increased, and by some miracle fans had been procured for everyone: the jury, my lawyer, the Prosecutor, and some of the journalists, too. The young man and the robot woman were still at their places. But they were not fanning themselves and, as before, they never took their eyes off me.',

For really, when one came to think of it, there was a disproportion between the judgment on which it was based and the unalterable sequence of events starting from the moment when that judgment was delivered. The fact that the verdict was read out at <<eight P.M.|5>> rather than at <<five|9c:0>>, the fact that it might have been quite different, that it was given by men who change their underclothes, and was credited to so vague an entity as the \x{201c}French people\x{201d}\x{2014}for that matter, why not to the Chinese or the German people?\x{2014}all these facts seemed to deprive the court\x{2019}s decision of much of its gravity.

When something happens to me I want to be ready for it. That\x{2019}s why I got into the habit of sleeping off and on in the daytime and watching through the night for the first hint of daybreak in the dark dome above. The worst period of the night was that vague hour when, I knew, they usually come; once it was <<after midnight|13>> I waited, listening intently. Never before had my ears perceived so many noises, such tiny sounds. Still, I must say I was lucky in one respect; never during any of those periods did I hear footsteps. Mother used to say that however miserable one is, there\x{2019}s always something to be thankful for. And each morning, when the sky brightened and light began to flood my cell, I agreed with her. Because I might just as well have heard footsteps, and felt my heart shattered into bits. Even though the faintest rustle sent me hurrying to the door and, pressing an ear to the rough, cold wood, I listened so intently that I could hear my breathing, quick and hoarse like a dog\x{2019}s panting\x{2014}even so there was an end; my heart hadn\x{2019}t split, and I knew I had another twenty-four hours\x{2019} respite.",

In the evening it was less pleasant, as the roller towel, after being used by so many people, was sopping wet. I once brought this to my employer\x{2019}s notice. It was regrettable, he agreed\x{2014}but, to his mind, a mere detail. I left the office building a little later than usual, at <<half-past twelve|10>>, with Emmanuel, who works in the Forwarding Department. Our building overlooks the sea, and we paused for a moment on the steps to look at the shipping in the. harbor. The sun was scorching hot. Just then a big truck came up, with a din of chains and backfires from the engine, and Emmanuel suggested we should try to jump it. I started to run. The truck was well away, and we had to chase it for quite a distance. What with the heat and the noise from the engine, I felt half dazed. All I was conscious of was our mad rush along the water front, amongst cranes and winches, with dark hulls of ships alongside and masts swaying in the offing. I was the first to catch up with the truck. I took a flying jump, landed safely, and helped Emmanuel to scramble in beside me. We were both of us out of breath, and the bumps of the truck on the roughly laid cobbles made things worse. Emmanuel chuckled, and panted in my ear, \x{201c}We\x{2019}ve made it!\x{201d}",
