            "On my way upstairs, in the dark, I ran into old Salamano, my neighbor across the landing. He was with his dog. The two of them have been inseparable for eight years. The spaniel has a skin disease\x{2014}mange, I think\x{2014}which makes almost all its hair fall out and leaves it covered with brown sores and scabs. After living together for so long, the two of them alone in one tiny room, they\x{2019}ve ended up looking like each other. Old Salamano has reddish scabs on his face and wispy yellow hair. As for the dog, he\x{2019}s sort of taken on his master\x{2019}s stooped look, muzzle down, neck straining. They look as if they belong to the same species, and yet they hate each other. Twice a day, at <<eleven|9:0>> and <<six|20a:0>>, the old man takes the dog out for a walk. They haven\x{2019}t changed their route in eight years. You can see them in the rue de Lyon, the dog pulling the man along until old Salamano stumbles. Then he beats the dog and swears at it. The dog cowers and trails behind. Then it\x{2019}s the old man who pulls the dog. Once the dog has forgotten, it starts dragging its master along again, and again gets beaten and sworn at. Then they both stand there on the sidewalk and stare at each other, the dog in terror, the man in hatred. It\x{2019}s the same thing every day. When the dog wants to urinate, the old man won\x{2019}t give him enough time and yanks at him, so that the spaniel leaves behind a trail of little drops. If the dog has an accident in the room, it gets beaten again. This has been going on for eight years. C\x{e9}leste is always saying, \x{201c}It\x{2019}s pitiful,\x{201d} but really, who\x{2019}s to say? When I ran into him on the stairs, Salamano was swearing away at the dog. He was saying, \x{201c}Filthy, stinking bastard!\x{201d} and the dog was whimpering. I said \x{201c}Good evening,\x{201d} but the old man just went on cursing. So I asked him what the dog had done. He didn\x{2019}t answer. All he said was \x{201c}Filthy, stinking bastard!\x{201d} I could barely see him leaning over his dog, trying to fix something on its collar. I spoke louder. Then, without turning around, he answered with a kind of suppressed rage, \x{201c}He\x{2019}s always there.\x{201d} Then he left, yanking at the animal, which was letting itself be dragged along, whimpering.",

You could make out the shape of her firm breasts, and her tan made her face look like a flower.

The <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> sun wasn\x{2019}t too hot, but the water was warm, with slow, gently lapping waves. Marie taught me a game. As you swam, you had to skim off the foam from the crest of the waves with your mouth, hold it there, then roll over on your back and spout it out toward the sky. This made a delicate froth which disappeared into the air or fell back in a warm spray over my face. But after a while my mouth was stinging with the salty bitterness. Then Marie swam over to me and pressed herself against me in the water. She put her lips on mine. Her tongue cooled my lips and we tumbled in the waves for a moment.",

Raymond told him. \x{201c}Take that cigarette out of your mouth when you\x{2019}re talking to me,\x{201d} the cop said. Raymond hesitated, looked at me, and took a drag on his cigarette.

The look on Raymond\x{2019}s face changed, but he didn\x{2019}t say anything for a minute, and then he asked, in a meek voice, if he could pick up his cigarette. The cop said to go ahead and added, \x{201c}Next time you\x{2019}ll know better than to clown around with a policeman.\x{201d} Meanwhile the girl was crying and she repeated, \x{201c}He beat me up!

He also said that Raymond ought to be ashamed to be so drunk that he\x{2019}d have the shakes like that. Then Raymond explained, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not drunk, officer.
