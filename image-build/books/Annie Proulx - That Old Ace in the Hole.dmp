            "At the time Bob\x{2019}s parents had dropped him off on the doorstep, Uncle Tam had had a roommate, Wayne Redpoll, with glary eyes and a rubbery mug, his features arranged around a nose so beaked that it made his eyes unmemorable. His brown hair was crinkled and violent, springing with energy. In the mornings before <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> when the shop opened, he lounged around without a shirt doing crossword puzzles, tapping the pencil against his discolored teeth. His chest was strange, the nipples almost under his armpits. He was not good at the puzzles, too impatient for them, and after a few minutes would go his own way, filling in the blanks with any old word, right or wrong. Bob disliked him mildly and it was partly to vanquish him at crosswords that he began to study The Child\x{2019}s Illustrated Dictionary which Uncle Tam had fished out of a box and handed to him, saying, \x{201c}Happy congratulations on this great Wednesday morning.\x{201d} By the time he was twelve he could do the Tuesday New York Times puzzle with a pen in less than twenty minutes, but Thursday and Friday took many hours with pencil as the clues were sly and presumed knowledge of cultural events in the dim past. All kinds of words streamed through his mind\x{2014}ocelot, strabismus, plat du jour, archipelago, bemusement, vapor, mesa, sitar, boutique. Wayne tried to counter Bob\x{2019}s skill by dredging up odd crossword information and explaining it to him as though that were the point of the puzzles: that crosswords had been invented in 1913 by a Liverpool newspaperman, that in 1924 they became a national craze. He generally pooh-poohed the New York Times puzzles, which, he said, were child\x{2019}s play\x{2014}a meaningful look at Bob\x{2014}compared to the evil puzzles of the British, particularly those with cryptic clues constructed by the old masters, Torquemada, Ximenes and Azed. But this persiflage did him no good. He did not have the knack and Bob did.",

They talked about making the big discovery that would put them over the top, and, very often, filled with enthusiasm, they headed out for the evening flea markets, coming home at <<midnight|13>> with boxes of worthless oddities.

Even with the big gazetteer, The Roads of Texas, he could not locate the marker streams, Bosque Grande Creek and Red Deer Creek.

Later, from LaVon, he learned what he suspected, that this \x{201c}adobe fort,\x{201d} after the Bents abandoned it, was the famous Adobe Walls, the scene of a battle in 1874 between a war party of several hundred Comanches, Kiowas and Cheyennes (including the young Quanah Parker), led by the Comanche warrior Coyote Droppings (who claimed his medicine made him and those with him immune to bullets), and twenty-eight sharpshooter buffalo-hide hunters. The Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 forbade white men the right to hunt south of the Arkansas River, but white men did as they pleased. The same treaty forbade the Indians from raiding panhandle settlements, but the Indians continued to swoop down on homesteads. On this fine spring morning the Indians made a classic dawn attack. But the buffalo hunters had been awakened at <<two in the morning|5>> by the snap of the breaking ridgepole. They had repaired the pole and, sparked with coffee, decided to stay up and get an early start on the day. When the cry of \x{201c}Indians!\x{201d} came, they were awake and alert. They held off the Indians for three days. After a number of the attacking men fell, the main Indian body retreated to the ridges above Adobe Walls where they rode back and forth out of rifle range. On the third day the plainsman Billy Dixon snapped off a shot at one of the distant riders with his .50 Sharps rifle. The Indian fell dead from his horse and soon after the demoralized attackers, who had believed their strong medicine protected them from bullets, left. It was the beginning of the end, and a year later the panhandle had been ethnically cleansed of its native people. Billy Dixon\x{2019}s long shot became a pillar of western myth.",

This one was in the schoolhouse at Cowboy Rose, when it was a schoolhouse, not like now, all fixed up into a house for two funny boys and the kids sent on a bus to a far-off school, and it was a box supper. After World War Two the box suppers stopped. They got in the movie show in Woolybucket and the diner and that\x{2019}s what people wanted a do, step out and get entertained. It was the women wanted it. Anyway, that dance. Didn\x{2019}t get much work out a none a us that day, we was so busy scrubbin and smoothin and brushin our hats and puttin grease on our boots. Quite a rough road a Cowboy Rose and everbody a-horseback set off <<after noon|13>> dinner a get there in time to bid on the supper boxes. Some drove in a automobile, though there wasn\x{2019}t so many of them around here and most of us stuck to the horse. One or two rode a tractor over. You know how that box supper game goes\x{2014}the girls make a fancy dish and put it in a fancy box and the men bid on the box and whoever wins a box with a high bid gets to set with the lady that made it. Somehow or other ever cowboy always knew what his favorite gal\x{2019}s wrap-up was to be\x{2014}flary paper with a flar in the knot, wood crate with strawr packed around some pots a keep somethin hot, pink paper and jingle bells and all manner of foofaraw getups. Some reason, Fanny come in late after all the others, and they\x{2019}d already started the bids. He\x{2019}s climbin up the steps when this little shirttail girl hardly reaches his belt buckle comes out carryin a bowl and the tears runnin down her freckles like rain.",

            'The air outside was lukewarm, the sky as unmarked with weather trouble as a sheet of blue paper. As he drove toward Woolybucket over a road the color of crushed almonds he realized he felt extremely well, free of the press of hog farm site finagling, ready for a day of pleasure. The temperature heated up as he drove. By the time he got to Woolybucket the bank thermometer read 94 degrees. In Woolybucket it seemed everyone felt as he did, for people were jovial and laughing, nearly everyone dressed in jeans, long-sleeved shirts and cowboy boots except for a few tourists in shorts, their legs already red. He did not have a hat and set out to find one in the dozens of kiosks and booths standing along Main Street. The town was transformed. Crews must have worked all night to get the stands and platforms and booths ready. The stage, with a sign wreathed in barbwire nailed across the front, was at the end of the street:
STREET DANCE <<8 PM|5>>
PANHANDLE PINTOS',

            "At <<11:45|2>>, in the liquid heat, he walked out to the rodeo arena at the north end of the main street, a place of steel and wood corrals he had seen fifty times deserted and forlorn, the air pale yellow with suspended dust. Now the place thrummed with diesel pickups and stock trucks, early comers already filling the spectator bleachers, horses and bulls and calves in the stock pens. The thunderheads loomed, the darkling plain flat beneath its indigo bulk. The entranceway flew a banner announcing the 68th Woolybucket Ranch Rodeo. Barkers hawked cotton candy and cold drinks. He bought a ticket and went to the stands, picking out an aisle seat. The front row was taken up by eight assorted men, whom Bob guessed to be the monks from the Triple Cross, for they were dressed in chinos and short-sleeved shirts while the lay Woolybucket audience wore jeans and cowboy boots. Tourists wore shorts and T-shirts. The smell of food was everywhere. A turkey leg vendor roamed the aisles selling the hot meat, followed by the taco man, the barbecue rib man and the popcorn lady, then the stringy youth with a pierced cardboard tray holding towering cones of cotton candy, to Bob\x{2019}s mind the second vilest confection on the planet, first place going to the candy apple. In the crowd Bob thought he saw the nurse with the flapper hair and dimpled cheeks, but when she turned he saw it was another woman. Perhaps he could see the nurse again when he met with the Chines at the hospital. Behind him someone said, \x{201c}Fixin a have us a storm.\x{201d}",

The line of thunderheads flickered with lightning but seemed no closer. The northeast breeze freshened and people sighed with pleasure. As the crowd sat down the Grand Parade began, composed of scout troops and the children of local business owners in gaudy costumes and waving advertising flags on horses groomed to spectacular showiness, their polished hooves gleaming, brushed haunches a-shine, manes plaited in intricate designs that would excite envy in an Afro-American beauty shop. The announcer, up in his high booth, was Warnell Pue, an Old Dog regular, and he was drunk, cracking jokes about the clowns (clothed in women\x{2019}s dresses chopped short at midthigh), mixing up names and even events. The contestants clustered with others from their ranches, stood leaning on the arena rails, alternately watching the action and the sky.",
