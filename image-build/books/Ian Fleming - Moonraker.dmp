Tomorrow morning the site will be opened again until <<midday|13>> for a final check and from that moment, except for the gyro settings, the Moonraker will be ready to go. The guards will be permanently on duty round the site. On Friday morning I shall personally supervise the gyro settings. The men from the Ministry will take over the firing point and the R.A.F. will man the radar. The B.B.C. will set up their vans behind the firing point and will begin their running commentary at <<eleven-forty-five|5b>>.

Well now. Shipping will be cleared from the target area from <<midnight|13>> on Thursday. The Navy will provide a patrol of the boundaries of the area all through the morning. There will be a B.B.C. commentator in one of the ships. The Ministry of Supply experts will be in a salvage ship with deep-sea television and after the rocket has landed they will try to bring up the remains. You may be interested to know,\x{2019} continued Drax, rubbing his hands with almost childish pleasure, \x{2018}that a messenger from the Prime Minister has brought me the very welcome news that not only will there be a special Cabinet Meeting to listen to the broadcast, but the Palace will also be listening in to the launching.\x{2019}",

Calm as a millpond. No wind. Bright sunshine. And the target area is reported clear of shipping. Is that right, Commander Edwards? Yes, the Captain says it\x{2019}s quite clear. Nothing on the radar screens yet. I\x{2019}m not allowed to tell you the range we shall pick her up at. Security and all that. But we shall only catch the rocket for a split second. Isn\x{2019}t that right, Captain? But the target\x{2019}s just showing on the screen. Out of sight from the bridge, of course. Must be seventy miles north of here. We could see the Moonraker going up. Terrific sight. Noise like thunder. Long flame coming out of the tail. Must have been ten miles away but you couldn\x{2019}t miss the light. Yes, Captain? Oh yes, I see. Well, that\x{2019}s very interesting. Big submarine coming up fast. Only about a mile away. Suppose it\x{2019}s the one they say Sir Hugo\x{2019}s aboard with his men. None of us here were told anything about her. Captain Edwards says she doesn\x{2019}t answer the Aldis lamp. Not flying colours. Very mysterious. I\x{2019}ve got her now. Quite clear in my glasses. We\x{2019}ve changed course to intercept her. The Captain says she isn\x{2019}t one of ours. Thinks she must be a foreigner. Hullo! She\x{2019}s broken out her colours. WHAT\x{2019}S that? Good heavens. The Captain says she\x{2019}s a Russian. I say! And now she\x{2019}s hauled down her colours and she\x{2019}s submerging. Bang. Did you hear that? We fired a shot across her bows. But she\x{2019}s disappeared. What\x{2019}s that? The asdic operator says she\x{2019}s going even faster under water. Twenty-five knots. Terrific. Well, she can\x{2019}t see much under water. But she\x{2019}s right in the target area now. <<Twelve minutes past noon|10>>. The Moonraker must have turned and be on her way down. A thousand miles up. Coming down at ten thousand miles an hour. She\x{2019}ll be here any second now. Hope there\x{2019}s not going to be a tragedy. The Russian\x{2019}s well inside the danger zone. The radar operator\x{2019}s holding up his hand. That means she\x{2019}s due. She\x{2019}s coming. She\x{2019}s COMING\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}Whew! Not even a whisper. GOD! What\x{2019}s that? Look out! Look out! Terrific explosion. Black cloud going up into the air. There\x{2019}s a tidal wave coming at us. Great wall of water tearing down. There goes the submarine. God! Thrown out of the water upside down. It\x{2019}s coming.

What would she like? Where would she like to go? Where had she ever been? Germany, of course. France? Miss out Paris. They could do that on their way back. Get as far as they could the first night, away from the Pas de Calais. There was that farmhouse with the wonderful food between Montreuil and Etaples. Then the fast sweep down to the Loire. The little places near the river for a few days. Not the chateau towns. Places like Beaugency, for instance. Then slowly south, always keeping to the western roads, avoiding the five-star life. Slowly exploring. Bond pulled himself up. Exploring what? Each other? Was he getting serious about this girl?',
