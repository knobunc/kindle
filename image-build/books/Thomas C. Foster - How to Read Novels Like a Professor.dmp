            "Irony. Or not\x{2014}some novels are in dead earnest. The entire nineteenth century springs to mind. Okay, maybe not Mark Twain. Oh, and Gustave Flaubert. But you know what I mean. Others are ironic on any number of levels\x{2014}verbal, dramatic, comic, situational\x{2014}and often that shows up right away. This is one of Parker\x{2019}s Spenser novels, A Catskill Eagle, getting rolling: \x{201c}It was <<midnight|13>> and I was just getting home from detecting. I had followed an embezzler around on a warm day in early summer trying to observe him spending his ill-gotten gain. The best I\x{2019}d been able to do was catch him eating a veal cutlet in a sub shop in Danvers Square across from the Security National Bank. It wasn\x{2019}t much, but it was as close as you could get to sin in Danvers.\x{201d} Now Spenser is utterly earnest about what he does when he\x{2019}s doing it; he never expresses doubt or irony while shooting someone, for instance, but he\x{2019}s plenty ironic when he talks about it. He knows that his chosen trade, \x{201c}professional thug\x{201d} as he calls it in another book, is morally dubious. And that awareness makes its way into the books in phrases like \x{201c}getting home from detecting.\x{201d} He may, moreover, want to distance his \x{201c}real\x{201d} or \x{201c}private\x{201d} self from the actions of his professional self: \x{201c}I\x{2019}m the sensitive lover and excellent cook who likes wine with dinner and not merely the hired tough guy who threatens and shoots people,\x{201d} he seems to say with this strategy. And he also knows full well that you can find plenty of sin in Danvers or any other sleepy burg; that\x{2019}s just frustration talking. Throughout the novel, then, he\x{2019}ll veer between hard-charging action\x{2014}lots of bodies fall in this one\x{2014}and ironic, distanced commentary.",

            "Meanwhile, an example. Let\x{2019}s say you want to write about a big event. A really big, earth-changing event. Something like, oh, Indian independence. At <<midnight|13>> on August 15, 1947, something on the order of half a billion people achieved their freedom from colonial rule. Now that\x{2019}s big. Might even be worth writing about. Here\x{2019}s the catch, though: how do you write about half a billion people? You don\x{2019}t. You can\x{2019}t. Even just saying the names would take thousands of pages. But you can write about one person. You can even give that one person a special trait, maybe connect him (it is a him) to a few others who share that trait. You could even have him be born on August 15, 1947. At <<midnight|13>>. He could be telepathically connected to others who share the moment of birth with him and the newly formed countries of India and Pakistan. That\x{2019}s the conceit of Salman Rushdie\x{2019}s brilliant evocation of the emerging nations in <<Midnight|13>>\x{2019}s Children. His novel is a sprawling tragicomedy centered around Saleem Sinai, whose life and tangled fate parallels that of his country. The strategy proves a winner. Why? In part, we can follow the ups and downs of Saleem\x{2019}s fate far better than those of a whole nation. Partly, too, by using Saleem, Rushdie can select those aspects of India\x{2019}s entry into nationhood he wishes to emphasize; an individual life, however messy, is far tidier than the whole history of a country. Even if that history is very short. And finally, he tells a great story.",

Still, the stylistic effects were pernicious, or at least occasionally obnoxious. All that repetition, all that thumping a point to death. The shrillness, the stridency. Oh well, part of being a student is trying on different masks, even badly fitting or poorly made ones. But here\x{2019}s the real crime in my stylistic slavishness: neither my essays nor my fiction had any need of the Lawrence touch. I couldn\x{2019}t have written Women in Like, much less Love, and without Lawrence\x{2019}s genius, one is best off leaving his style alone. In his creative writing text, Three Genres, Stephen Minot employs the term \x{201c}mock-Faulkner\x{201d} for a certain kind of overwrought short story that attempts to pack all the action of a Faulkner novel\x{2014}two murders, incest, rape, a kidnapping, three fires, and several outrageous racist incidents\x{2014}into twenty-five hundred words, broken into maybe five sentences.

Modernity, or more particularly modernism, decided it could live without certainty. Oh sure, some of the old guard, folks like Arnold Bennett and John Galsworthy, along with writers of genre fiction from Rafael Sabatini (who had a bestseller nearly every year in the 1920s with books like Captain Blood and Scaramouche) and Dashiell Hammett were still doing the old thing, more or less. But others were moving on. Consider, if you will, two examples, neither of whom could be described as wildly experimental. E. M. Forster found early success in the first decade of the century with fairly conventional novels like A Room with a View (1908), which, as a romantic comedy, ends quite predictably with the appropriate couple honeymooning where they first encountered each other. Fast-forward sixteen years to A Passage to India, an altogether more problematic story of intercultural misunderstanding amid the evils of colonialism. At the last, the wronged Dr. Aziz, now exonerated, and the well-meaning but not wholly effectual Cyril Fielding, representing India and England, argue over the possibility of friendship as equals between the two. Even the conversation, which consists largely of exchanging passionate statements of the obvious, cannot be completed; their horses and the landscape conspire against definitive closure. Much the same thing, minus horses, in Lawrence\x{2019}s Women in Love (1920), where, after great upheaval and mayhem for the two principal couples, Birkin and Ursula close the novel with an argument whose final words are, \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t believe that.\x{201d} Critics and readers are sometimes tempted to take Birkin\x{2019}s impassioned speech as the last word, but that honor belongs to Ursula.

Thinking on last things almost necessarily prompts thoughts of first things: How did we get here? How did the world look before us? Was there a before-us, is there a higher power than ourselves?
