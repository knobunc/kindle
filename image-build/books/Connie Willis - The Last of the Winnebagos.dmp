The appointment\'s for ten. Listen, McCombe, I got the poop on the Amblers for you. They bill themselves as \'One Hundred Percent Authentic,\' but they\'re not. Their RV isn\'t really a Winnebago, it\'s an Open Road. It is the last RV on the road, though, according to Highway Patrol. A man named Eldridge was touring with one, also not a Winnebago, a Shasta, until March, but he lost his license in Oklahoma for using a tanker lane, so this is it. Recreation vehicles are banned in all but four states. Texas has legislation in committee, and Utah has a full-divided bill coming up next month. Arizona will be next, so take lots of pictures, Davey boy. This may be your last chance. And get some of the zoo."',

            'It\'s a tough job being a photographer. The minute most people see a camera, their real faces close like a shutter in too much light, and all that\'s left is their camera face, their public face. It\'s a smiling face, except in the case of Saudi terrorists or senators, but, smiling or not, it shows no real emotion. Actors, politicians, people who have their pictures taken all the time are the worst. The longer the person\'s been in the public eye, the easier it is for me to get great vidcam footage and the harder it is to get anything approaching a real photograph, and the Amblers had been at this for nearly twenty years. By a <<quarter to nine|10>> they would already have their camera faces on.',

She still had the dishtowel in her hand, even though there couldn\'t possibly be space for that many dishes in the tiny RV. The inside was even smaller than I had thought it would be, low enough that I had to duck and so narrow I had to hold the Nikon close to my body to keep from hitting the lens on the passenger seat, It felt like an oven inside, and it was only <<nine o\'clock in the morning|6>>.',
