At <<ten o\'clock|6>> the Keetons returned home and packed a picnic hamper. <<Shortly before noon|13>> the three of them set off across Windy Cave Meadow, towards Fox Water and beyond. They followed a dry track along the dense hedgerows between adjacent farms, and very soon Tallis realized, with a combined sense of fear and excitement, that they were walking towards Ryhope Wood.',

She turned to the picture called The Riders to the Sea, which had been marked in pen with a large exclamation sign. It showed <<four|11b:0>> knights on horseback, riding hard, bent low over the withers of their mounts, cloaks streaming as they escaped a terrible, dark storm.',

Tallis went down to the Wyndbrook, Hunter's Brook, and moved slowly among the trees. She wondered whether she should take a chance and cross the unnamed field to Ryhope Wood. She longed to visit the ruined house again and she was often strongly tempted to risk that visit. But against that thought was the feeling that the house was something\x{2026} something not of her.

Soon the forest closed around her, so dense and dark in places that even as the new day broke she imagined herself still to be in a <<midnight|13>> realm. The character and nature of the wood changed with every furlong\'s riding, and the traces and butchery of battle with it. In the woods of oak she passed glades where cowled men chanted over carved wooden heads or walked about the piled armor of dead warriors. She saw oval shields, with boars and stags brilliantly gilded upon the slashed leather, broken swords, highly coloured cloaks and small chariots of wicker, broken or burned, in each of which crouched the naked form of its dead rider. There were heads hanging from branches in these places, which gleamed as if oiled. The chanting of the priests seemed to summon wings, though as Tallis skirted these Celtic shrines she could see nothing; and only heard the raucous pleasure of the crow goddess.',
