I saw this happen the previous Thanksgiving, which we spent together in a rental house in Hawaii. Dinner was served at <<seven o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and <<around midnight|13>>, an hour or so after she\x{2019}d gone to bed, Gretchen drifted out of her room. Hugh and I looked up from our books and watched her enter the kitchen. There, she took the turkey out of the refrigerator and started twisting off meat with her fingers. \x{201c}Why don\x{2019}t you get a plate?\x{201d} I asked, and she looked at me, not scornfully but blankly, as if it had been the wind talking. Then she reached into the carcass and yanked out some stuffing.
