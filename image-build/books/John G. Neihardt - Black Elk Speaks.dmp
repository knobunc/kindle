Does this plan seem a good one to you, and if it seems good to you, will you not be willing to help me make it successful? I do feel that so much is known by you Indians that our white people do not know and should know, that I am very eager to write this book if you will help me. Write and tell me how much you think you should be paid for each meeting, and there should be from <<six to ten|10a:0>> meetings. And tell me if you think you could get three or four of the fine old men that you know to meet with us and talk about old times while you are telling your story to me.',

            "I returned to the transcript again and again, referring to them in college term papers, in my Ph.D. dissertation, and in some of my early publications. They form such an important source for the anthropological study of Lakota culture that I was convinced that they should be published. Finally, in 1980, when I had gained tenure at Indian a University, I felt in a position to undertake the job. I proposed the project to Hilda Neihardt who allowed it to proceed and ultimately gave permission to publish not only the 1931 interviews, but also those from <<1944|9c:0>>, for which she had served as her father\x{2019}s stenographer. The book, called The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk\x{2019}s Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt (1984) includes a biographical introduction about Black Elk and a complete and corrected version of the 1931 notes based on a retran-scription of Enid\x{2019}s original shorthand. While the publisher wanted a title that would attract attention, perhaps \x{201c}Black Elk Speaks Again,\x{201d} I preferred something that reflected the message that Black Elk wished to send, so I based the title on his statement, \x{201c}the sixth grandfather was myself, who represented the spirit of mankind\x{201d} (so, 141). For the subtitle I wanted to avoid \x{201c}interviews\x{201d} and thought about Black Elk\x{2019}s statement to Neihardt at their first meeting in 1930: \x{201c}He has been sent to learn what I know, and I will teach him\x{201d} (BES).",
