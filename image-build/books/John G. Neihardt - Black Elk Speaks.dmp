            "I returned to the transcript again and again, referring to them in college term papers, in my Ph.D. dissertation, and in some of my early publications. They form such an important source for the anthropological study of Lakota culture that I was convinced that they should be published. Finally, in 1980, when I had gained tenure at Indian a University, I felt in a position to undertake the job. I proposed the project to Hilda Neihardt who allowed it to proceed and ultimately gave permission to publish not only the 1931 interviews, but also those from <<1944|9c:0>>, for which she had served as her father\x{2019}s stenographer. The book, called The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk\x{2019}s Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt (1984) includes a biographical introduction about Black Elk and a complete and corrected version of the 1931 notes based on a retran-scription of Enid\x{2019}s original shorthand. While the publisher wanted a title that would attract attention, perhaps \x{201c}Black Elk Speaks Again,\x{201d} I preferred something that reflected the message that Black Elk wished to send, so I based the title on his statement, \x{201c}the sixth grandfather was myself, who represented the spirit of mankind\x{201d} (so, 141). For the subtitle I wanted to avoid \x{201c}interviews\x{201d} and thought about Black Elk\x{2019}s statement to Neihardt at their first meeting in 1930: \x{201c}He has been sent to learn what I know, and I will teach him\x{201d} (BES).",
