Moishe was not the same. The joy in his eyes was gone. He no longer sang. He no longer mentioned either God or Kabbalah. He spoke only of what he had seen. But people not only refused to believe his tales, they refused to listen. Some even insinuated that he only wanted their pity, that he was imagining things. Oth- ers flatly said that he had gone mad. As for Moishe, he wept and pleaded: \x{201c}Jews, listen to me! That's all I ask of you. No money. No pity. Just listen to me!\x{201d} he kept shouting in synagogue, between the prayer at dusk and the <<evening prayer|13>>. Even I did not believe him. I often sat with him, after ser- vices, and listened to his tales, trying to understand his grief. But all I felt was pity. \x{201c}They think I'm mad,\x{201d} he whispered, and tears, like drops of wax, flowed from his eyes. Once, I asked him the question: \x{201c}Why do you want people to believe you so much? In your place I would not care whether they believed me or not\x{2026}\x{201d} He closed his eyes, as if to escape time. \x{201c}You don't understand,\x{201d} he said in despair. \x{201c}You cannot under- stand. I was saved miraculously. I succeeded in coming back. Where did I get my strength? I wanted to return to Sighet to describe to you my death so that you might ready yourselves while there is still time. Life? I no longer care to live. I am alone. But I wanted to come back to warn you. Only no one is listening to me \x{2026}\x{201d} This was toward the end of 1942. Thereafter, life seemed normal once again.

As for my mother, she went on tending to the many chores in the house. Sometimes she would stop and gaze at us in silence. Three days later, a new decree: every Jew had to wear the yel- low star. Some prominent members of the community came to consult with my father, who had connections at the upper levels of the Hungarian police; they wanted to know what he thought of the situation. My father's view was that it was not all bleak, or per- haps he just did not want to discourage the others, to throw salt on their wounds: \x{201c}The yellow star? So what? It's not lethal\x{2026}\x{201d} (Poor Father! Of what then did you die?) But new edicts were already being issued. We no longer had the right to frequent restaurants or cafes, to travel by rail, to attend synagogue, to be on the streets <<after six o'clock in the evening|6>>. Then came the ghettos. TWO GHETTOS were created in Sighet. A large one in the center of town occupied four streets, and another smaller one extended over several alleyways on the outskirts of town. The street we lived on, Serpent Street, was in the first ghetto. We therefore could remain in our house. But, as it occupied a corner, the win- dows facing the street outside the ghetto had to be sealed. We gave some of our rooms to relatives who had been driven out of their homes. Little by little life returned to \x{201c}normal.\x{201d} The barbed wire that encircled us like a wall did not fill us with real fear. In fact, we felt this was not a bad thing; we were entirely among ourselves. A 11",

The courtyard turned into something like an antechamber to an operating room. We stood, waiting for the door to open. Neighbors, hearing the ru- mors, had joined us. We stared at our watches. Time had slowed down. What was the meaning of such a long session? \x{201c}I have a bad feeling,\x{201d} said my mother. \x{201c}This afternoon I saw new faces in the ghetto. Two German officers, I believe they were Gestapo. Since we've been here, we have not seen a single of- ficer\x{2026}\x{201d} It was close to <<midnight|13>>. Nobody felt like going to sleep, though some people briefly went to check on their homes. Others left but asked to be called as soon as my father returned. At last, the door opened and he appeared. His face was drained of color. He was quickly surrounded. \x{201c}Tell us. Tell us what's happening! Say something\x{2026}\x{201d} At that moment, we were so anxious to hear something en- couraging, a few words telling us that there was nothing to worry about, that the meeting had been routine, just a review of welfare and health problems\x{2026}But one glance at my father's face left no doubt. \x{201c}The news is terrible,\x{201d} he said at last. And then one word: \x{201c}Transports.\x{201d} The ghetto was to be liquidated entirely. Departures were to take place street by street, starting the next day. We wanted to know everything, every detail. We were stunned, yet we wanted to fully absorb the bitter news. \x{201c}Where will they take us?\x{201d} That was a secret. A secret for all, except one: the president of the Jewish Council. But he would not tell, or could not tell. The Gestapo had threatened to shoot him if he talked. 13",

That nothing had happened. It was all in jest\x{2026} My throat was dry and the words were choking me, paralyzing my lips. There was nothing else to say. At last he understood. He got out of bed and began to dress, automatically. Then he went over to the bed where his wife lay sleeping and with infinite tenderness touched her forehead. She opened her eyes and it seemed to me that a smile crossed her lips. Then he went to wake his two children. They woke with a start, torn from their dreams. I fled. Time went by quickly. It was already <<four o'clock in the morn|6>>- ing. My father was running right and left, exhausted, consoling friends, checking with the Jewish Council just in case the order had been rescinded. To the last moment, people clung to hope. The women were boiling eggs, roasting meat, preparing cakes, sewing backpacks. The children were wandering about aimlessly, not knowing what to do with themselves to stay out of the way of the grown-ups. Our backyard looked like a marketplace. Valuable objects, precious rugs, silver candlesticks, Bibles and other ritual objects were strewn over the dusty grounds\x{2014}pitiful relics that seemed never to have had a home.

I was in the midst of prayer when suddenly there was shouting in the streets. I quickly unwound my phylacteries and ran to the window. Hungarian po- lice had entered the ghetto and were yelling in the street nearby. \x{201c}All Jews, outside! Hurry!\x{201d} They were followed by Jewish police, who, their voices break- ing, told us: \x{201c}The time has come\x{2026}you must leave all this\x{2026}\x{201d} The Hungarian police used their rifle butts, their clubs to in- discriminately strike old men and women, children and cripples. One by one, the houses emptied and the streets filled with peo- ple carrying bundles. By <<ten o'clock|6>>, everyone was outside. The police were taking roll calls, once, twice, twenty times. The heat was oppressive. Sweat streamed from people's faces and bodies. Children were crying for water. Water! There was water close by inside the houses, the back- yards, but it was forbidden to break rank. \x{201c}Water, Mother, I am thirsty!\x{201d} Some of the Jewish police surreptitiously went to fill a few jugs. My sisters and I were still allowed to move about, as we were destined for the last convoy, and so we helped as best we could. AT LAST, at <<one o'clock in the afternoon|6>> came the signal to leave. There was joy, yes, joy. People must have thought there could be no greater torment in God's hell than that of being stranded here, on the sidewalk, among the bundles, in the middle of the street under a blazing sun. Anything seemed preferable to that. They began to walk without another glance at the abandoned streets, the dead, empty houses, the gardens, the tombstones\x{2026} 16",

They first had been herded through the main syna- gogue, where they were thoroughly searched to make sure they were not carrying away gold, silver, or any other valuables. There had been incidents of hysteria and harsh blows. \x{201c}When will it be our turn?\x{201d} I asked my father. \x{201c}The day after tomorrow. Unless\x{2026}things work out.

My father had risen before all of us, to seek information in town. He returned <<around eight o'clock|6>>. Good news: we were not leaving town today; we were only moving to the small ghetto. That is where we were to wait for the last transport. We would be the last to leave. At <<nine o'clock|6>>, the previous Sunday's scenes were repeated.

The afternoon went by slowly. Then the doors of the wagon slid open. Two men were given per- mission to fetch water. When they came back, they told us that they had learned, in exchange for a gold watch, that this was the final destination. We were to leave the train here. There was a labor camp on the site. The conditions were good. Families would not be separated. Only the young would work in the factories. The old and the sick would find work in the fields. Confidence soared. Suddenly we felt free of the previous nights' terror. We gave thanks to God. Mrs. Sch\x{e4}chter remained huddled in her corner, mute, un- touched by the optimism around her. Her little one was stroking her hand. Dusk began to fill the wagon. We ate what was left of our food. At <<ten o'clock in the evening|6>>, we were all trying to find a position for a quick nap and soon we were dozing. Suddenly: \x{201c}Look at the fire! Look at the flames! Over there!\x{201d} With a start, we awoke and rushed to the window yet again. We had believed her, if only for an instant. But there was nothing outside but darkness. We returned to our places, shame in our souls but fear gnawing at us nevertheless. As she went on howl- ing, she was struck again. Only with great difficulty did we suc- ceed in quieting her down.

She'll be taken there soon.\x{201d} <<Around eleven o'clock|6>>, the train began to move again. We pressed against the windows. The convoy was rolling slowly. A quarter of an hour later, it began to slow down even more. Through the windows, we saw barbed wire; we understood that this was the camp. We had forgotten Mrs. Sch\x{e4}chter's existence. Suddenly there was a terrible scream: \x{201c}Jews, look! Look at the fire! Look at the flames!\x{201d} And as the train stopped, this time we saw flames rising from a tall chimney into a black sky. Mrs. Sch\x{e4}chter had fallen silent on her own. Mute again, indif- ferent, absent, she had returned to her corner. We stared at the flames in the darkness. A wretched stench floated in the air. Abruptly, our doors opened. Strange-looking creatures, dressed in striped jackets and black pants, jumped into the wagon. Holding flashlights and sticks, they began to strike at us left and right, shouting: \x{201c}Everybody out! Leave everything inside. Hurry up!\x{201d} We jumped out. I glanced at Mrs. Sch\x{e4}chter. Her little boy was still holding her hand. In front of us, those flames. In the air, the smell of burning flesh. It must have been <<around midnight|13>>. We had arrived. In Birkenau. T HE BELOVED OBJECTS that we had carried with us from place to place were now left behind in the wagon and, with them, finally, our illusions. Every few yards, there stood an SS man, his machine gun trained on us. Hand in hand we followed the throng. An SS came toward us wielding a club. He commanded: \x{201c}Men to the left! Women to the right!\x{201d} Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight simple, short words. Yet that was the moment when I left my mother. There was no time to think, and I already felt my fa- ther's hand press against mine: we were alone. In a fraction of a second I could see my mother, my sisters, move to the right. Tzi- pora was holding Mother's hand. I saw them walking farther and farther away; Mother was stroking my sister's blond hair, as if to protect her. And I walked on with my father, with the men. I didn't know that this was the moment in time and the place where I was leaving my mother and Tzipora forever. I kept walk- ing, my father holding my hand. 28",

I thought he was crying with joy at still being alive. \x{201c}Don't cry, Yehiel,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}Don't waste your tears\x{2026}\x{201d} \x{201c}Not cry? We're on the threshold of death. Soon, we shall be inside\x{2026}Do you understand? Inside. How could I not cry?\x{201d} I watched darkness fade through the bluish skylights in the roof. I no longer was afraid. I was overcome by fatigue. The absent no longer entered our thoughts. One spoke of them\x{2014}who knows what happened to them?\x{2014}but their fate was not on our minds. We were incapable of thinking. Our senses were numbed, everything was fading into a fog. We no longer clung to anything. The instincts of self-preservation, of self- defense, of pride, had all deserted us. In one terrifying moment of lucidity, I thought of us as damned souls wandering through the void, souls condemned to wander through space until the end of time, seeking redemption, seeking oblivion, without any hope of finding either. <<AROUND FIVE O'CLOCK in the morning|6>>, we were expelled from the barrack. The Kapos were beating us again, but I no longer felt the pain. A glacial wind was enveloping us. We were naked, hold- ing our shoes and belts. An order: \x{201c}Run!\x{201d} And we ran. After a few minutes of running, a new barrack. A barrel of foul-smelling liquid stood by the door. Disinfec- tion. Everybody soaked in it. Then came a hot shower. All very fast. As we left the showers, we were chased outside. And ordered to run some more. Another barrack: the storeroom. Very long ta- bles. Mountains of prison garb.

We were led toward one of those \x{201c}blocks.\x{201d} Seated on the ground by the entrance, we began to wait again. From time to time somebody was allowed to go in. These were the showers, a compulsory routine. Going from one camp to the other, several times a day, we had, each time, to go through them. After the hot shower, we stood shivering in the darkness. Our clothes had been left behind; we had been promised other clothes. <<Around midnight|13>>, we were told to run. \x{201c}Faster!\x{201d} yelled our guards. \x{201c}The faster you run, the faster you'll get to go to sleep.\x{201d} After a few minutes of racing madly, we came to a new block. The man in charge was waiting. He was a young Pole, who was smiling at us. He began to talk to us and, despite our weariness, we listened attentively. \x{201c}Comrades, you are now in the concentration camp Ausch- witz. Ahead of you lies a long road paved with suffering.

We were given new clothing. They brought us black coffee. We left the block <<around ten o'clock|6>> so it could be cleaned. Outside, the sun warmed us. Our morale was much improved.

In the sky, a few small white clouds. We were walking slowly. The guards were in no hurry. We were glad of it. As we were passing through some of the villages, many Germans watched us, showing no surprise. No doubt they had seen quite a few of these processions\x{2026} On the way, we saw some young German girls. The guards be- gan to tease them. The girls giggled. They allowed themselves to be kissed and tickled, bursting with laughter. They all were laughing, joking, and passing love notes to one another. At least, during all that time, we endured neither shouting nor blows. After four hours, we arrived at the new camp: Buna. The iron gate closed behind us. T HE CAMP looked as though it had been through an epi- demic: empty and dead. Only a few \x{201c}well-dressed\x{201d} in- mates were wandering between the blocks. Of course, we first had to pass through the showers. The head of the camp joined us there. He was a stocky man with big shoul- ders, the neck of a bull, thick lips, and curly hair. He gave an im- pression of kindness. From time to time, a smile would linger in his gray-blue eyes. Our convoy included a few ten- and twelve- year-olds.

We were to wait there until we could be incorporated into work Komman- dos. Then we would be assigned to a block. In the evening, the Kommandos returned from the work yards. Roll call.

(In fact, this affection was not entirely altruistic; there existed here a veri- table traffic of children among homosexuals, I learned later.) He told us: \x{201d}You will stay with me for three days in quarantine. Afterward, you will go to work. Tomorrow: medical checkup.\x{201c} One of his aides\x{2014}a tough-looking boy with shifty eyes\x{2014}came over to me: \x{201d}Would you like to get into a good Kommando?\x{201c} \x{201d}Of course. But on one condition: I want to stay with my father.\x{201c} \x{201d}All right,\x{201c} he said. \x{201d}I can arrange it. For a pittance: your shoes. I'll give you another pair.\x{201c} I refused to give him my shoes. They were all I had left. \x{201d}I'll also give you a ration of bread with some margarine\x{2026}\x{201c} He liked my shoes; I would not let him have them. Later, they were taken from me anyway. In exchange for nothing, that time. The medical checkup took place outside, early in the morn- ing, <<before three|9:0>> doctors seated on a bench. The first hardly examined me. He just asked: \x{201d}Are you in good health?\" Who would have dared to admit the opposite? On the other hand, the dentist seemed more conscientious: he asked me to open my mouth wide. In fact, he was not looking for 48",

The Kapo was waiting. \x{201c}<<Twenty-four\x{2026}twenty-five|5k:1>>!\x{201d} It was over. I had not realized it, but I had fainted. I came to when they doused me with cold water.

I began to distinguish what he was shouting: \x{201c}Stand up!\x{201d} I must have made some movement to get up, but I felt myself fall back on the crate. How I wanted to get up! \x{201c}Stand up!\x{201d} He was yelling even more loudly. If only I could answer him, if only I could tell him that I could not move. But my mouth would not open. At Idek's command, two inmates lifted me and led me to him. \x{201c}Look me in the eye!\x{201d} I looked at him without seeing him. I was thinking of my fa- ther. He would be suffering more than I. \x{201c}Listen to me, you son of a swine!\x{201d} said Idek coldly. \x{201c}So much for your curiosity. You shall receive five times more if you dare tell anyone what you saw! Understood?\x{201d} I nodded, once, ten times, endlessly. As if my head had de- cided to say yes for all eternity.

He had already been through all the slaughterhouses, all the factories of death. <<Around nine o'clock|6>>, he came to stand in our midst: \x{201c}Achtung!\x{201d} There was instant silence. \x{201c}Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you.\x{201d} For the first time, his voice quivered. \x{201c}In a few moments, selection will take place. You will have to undress completely. Then you will go, one by one, before the SS doctors. I hope you will all pass. But you must try to increase your chances. Before you go into the next room, try to move your limbs, give yourself some color. Don't walk slowly, run! Run as if you had the devil at your heels! Don't look at the SS. Run, straight in front of you!\x{201d} He paused and then added: \x{201c}And most important, don't be afraid!\x{201d} That was a piece of advice we would have loved to be able to follow. I undressed, leaving my clothes on my cot. Tonight, there was no danger that they would be stolen. Tibi and Yossi, who had changed Kommandos at the same time I did, came to urge me: \x{201c}Let's stay together. It will make us stronger.\x{201d} Yossi was mumbling something. He probably was praying. I had never suspected that Yossi was religious. In fact, I had always believed the opposite. Tibi was silent and very pale. All the block inmates stood naked between the rows of bunks. This must be how one stands for the Last Judgment. \x{201c}They are coming!\x{201d} Three SS officers surrounded the notorious Dr. Mengele, the very same who had received us in Birkenau. The Block\x{e4}lteste at- tempted a smile. He asked us: \x{201c}Ready?\x{201d} 71",

But then again, what if he was telling the truth? I de- cided to wait and see. THE DOCTOR CAME TO TELL ME that he would operate the next day. \x{201c}Don't be afraid,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Everything will be all right.\x{201d} At <<ten o'clock in the morning|6>>, I was taken to the operating room. My doctor was there. That reassured me. I felt that in his presence, nothing serious could happen to me. Every one of his words was healing and every glance of his carried a message of hope. \x{201c}It will hurt a little,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}but it will pass. Be brave.\x{201d} The operation lasted one hour. They did not put me to sleep. I did not take my eyes off my doctor. Then I felt myself sink\x{2026} When I came to and opened my eyes, I first saw nothing but a huge expanse of white, my sheets, then I saw my doctor's face above me. \x{201c}Everything went well. You have spunk, my boy. Next, you'll stay here two weeks for some proper rest and that will be it. You'll eat well, you'll relax your body and your nerves\x{2026}\x{201d} All I could do was follow the movements of his lips. I barely understood what he was telling me, but the inflection of his voice soothed me. Suddenly, I broke into a cold sweat; I couldn't feel my leg! Had they amputated it? \x{201c}Doctor,\x{201d} I stammered. \x{201c}Doctor?\x{201d} \x{201c}What is it, son?\x{201d} I didn't have the courage to ask him. \x{201c}Doctor, I'm thirsty\x{2026}\x{201d} He had water brought to m e \x{2026} He was smiling.

Do you trust me?\x{201d} \x{201c}Very much, Doctor.\x{201d} \x{201c}Then listen well: in two weeks you'll be fully recovered. You'll be able to walk like the others. The sole of your foot was full of pus. I just had to open the sac. Your leg was not amputated. You'll see, in two weeks, you'll be walking around like everybody else.\x{201d} All I had to do was wait two weeks. BUT TWO DAYS AFTER my operation, rumors swept through the camp that the battlefront had suddenly drawn nearer. The Red Army was racing toward Buna: it was only a matter of hours. We were quite used to this kind of rumor. It wasn't the first time that false prophets announced to us: peace-in-the-world, the-Red-Cross-negotiating-our-liberation, or other fables\x{2026}And often we would believe them\x{2026} It was like an injection of morphine. Only this time, these prophecies seemed more founded. Dur- ing the last nights we had heard the cannons in the distance. My faceless neighbor spoke up: \x{201c}Don't be deluded. Hitler has made it clear that he will annihilate all Jews before the clock strikes <<twelve|11>>.\x{201d} I exploded: \x{201c}What do you care what he said? Would you want us to con- sider him a prophet?\x{201d} His cold eyes stared at me. At last, he said wearily: 80",

He alone has kept his promises, all his promises, to the Jewish people.\x{201d} THAT AFTERNOON AT <<FOUR O'CLOCK|6>>, as usual, the bell called all the Block\x{e4}lteste for their daily report. They came back shattered. They had difficulty opening their mouths. All they could utter was one word: \x{201c}Evacuation.\x{201d} The camp was going to be emptied and we would be sent to the rear. Where to? Somewhere in deepest Germany. To other camps; there was no shortage of them. \x{201c}When?\x{201d} \x{201c}Tomorrow night.\x{201d} \x{201c}Perhaps the Russians will arrive before\x{2026}\x{201d} \x{201c}Perhaps.\x{201d} We knew perfectly well they would not. The camp had become a hive of activity. People were running, calling to one another. In every block, the inmates prepared for the journey ahead. I had forgotten about my lame foot. A doctor came into the room and announced: \x{201c}Tomorrow, right after nightfall, the camp will start on its march. Block by block. The sick can remain in the infirmary. They will not be evacuated.\x{201d} That news made us wonder. Were the SS really going to leave hundreds of prisoners behind in the infirmaries, pending the ar- rival of their liberators? Were they really going to allow Jews to hear the clock strike <<twelve|11>>? Of course not. \x{201c}All the patients will be finished off on the spot,\x{201d} said the faceless one. \x{201c}And in one last swoop, thrown into the furnaces.\x{201d} \x{201c}Surely, the camp will be mined,\x{201d} said another. \x{201c}Right after the evacuation, it will all blow up.\x{201d} 81",

For whom? \x{201c}For the liberating army,\x{201d} he told us. \x{201c}Let them know that here lived men and not pigs.\x{201d} So we were men after all? The block was cleaned from top to bottom.

The gates of the camp opened. It seemed as though an even darker night was waiting for us on the other side. The first blocks began to march. We waited. We had to await the exodus of the fifty-six blocks that preceded us. It was very cold. In my pocket, I had two pieces of bread. How I would have liked to eat them! But I knew I must not. Not yet. Our turn was coming: Block 53\x{2026}Block 5 5 \x{2026} \x{201c}Block 57, forward! March!\x{201d} It snowed on and on. 84",

            "days except for a few stalks of grass and some potato peels found on the grounds of the kitchens. At <<ten o'clock in the morning|6>>, the SS took positions through- out the camp and began to herd the last of us toward the Ap- pelplatz. The resistance movement decided at that point to act. Armed men appeared from everywhere. Bursts of gunshots. Grenades ex- ploding. We, the children, remained flat on the floor of the block. The battle did not last long. <<Around noon|13>>, everything was calm again. The SS had fled and the resistance had taken charge of the camp. At <<six o'clock that afternoon|6>>, the first American tank stood at the gates of Buchenwald. OUR FIRST ACT AS FREE MEN was to throw ourselves onto the provisions. That's all we thought about. No thought of revenge, or of parents. Only of bread. And even when we were no longer hungry, not one of us thought of revenge. The next day, a few of the young men ran into Weimar to bring back some potatoes and clothes\x{2014}and to sleep with girls. But still no trace of revenge. Three days after the liberation of Buchenwald, I became very ill: some form of poisoning. I was transferred to a hospital and spent two weeks between life and death. One day when I was able to get up, I decided to look at myself in the mirror on the opposite wall. I had not seen myself since the ghetto. From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me has never left me. 115",
