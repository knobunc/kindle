Now, considering the distance traveled, it had to have made that flight before Copernicus was destroyed. So the Formics came in clear view of Copernicus, but the satellite never saw them. The IF acts all surprised by this, but they shouldn\x{2019}t be. Copernicus was really only good for spotting the big stuff. Hundreds of smaller objects get by it all the time. Maybe thousands.
