            "Today Emily Dickinson is recognized not only as a major poet of the American nineteenth century but also as one of the most intriguing poets of any place or time, in both her art and her life. The outline of her biography is well known. She was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1830 and, except for a few excursions to Philadelphia, Washington, and Boston, spent her entire life there, increasingly limiting her activities to her father\x{2019}s house. \x{201c}I do not cross my Father\x{2019}s ground to any House or Town,\x{201d} she wrote, referring to a personal reclusiveness that was noticeable even to her contemporaries. In the front corner bedroom of that house on Main Street, Dickinson wrote over 1,700 poems, often on scraps of paper and on the backs of grocery lists, only a handful of which were published in her lifetime and then anonymously. She was known to give poems to friends and neighbors, often as an accompaniment to the cakes and cookies she baked, sometimes lowering them from an upstairs window in a basket. Her habit of binding groups of poems together into little booklets called fascicles might indicate she felt her poems were presentable, but most of her poems never went farther than her desk drawer where they were discovered by her sister after Dickinson\x{2019}s death in 1886 of kidney failure. In her lifetime, her poetry remained unknown, and although a few small editions of her poems were published in the 1890s, it was not until <<1955|18:0>> that a reliable scholarly edition appeared, transcribing the poems precisely from the original manuscripts and preserving all of Dickinson\x{2019}s typographical eccentricities (see Note). Convincingly or not, she called publication \x{201c}the auction of the mind\x{201d} and compared the public figure to a frog croaking to the admiring audience of a bog.",
