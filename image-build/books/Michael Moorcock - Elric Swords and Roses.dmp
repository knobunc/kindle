Yet still she did not see me, did not scent me. I was invisible to her supernatural senses. She moved off towards the mountains and was back at <<noon that next day|9a>> with a kill, some nomad boy, probably a herder, and two lambs, which she had dragged, using the boy\x{2019}s body as a kind of sledge. The human remains she left for herself, but assumed her woman form once she had brought the lambs into camp. These she prepared for her children. Later that evening, as they ate the rich-smelling stew she had cooked, she returned to her human kill and devoured a good deal of him, almost certainly in wolf shape.

Sexton Blake began his career in 1897, but it was not until <<1918|18:0>> that his greatest enemy appeared in the pages of the Union Jack, a weekly paper devoted to Blake\x{2019}s adventures. The enemy was Monsieur Zenith (always \x{201c}Monsieur,\x{201d} perhaps to show that he was a Romanian aristocrat in disguise), a pink-eyed albino who smoked opium cigarettes, played the violin like an angel, was waited on by fanatically loyal Japanese servants, and was immensely strong and agile, living only for danger and careless of his own life. He would battle Blake in a series written always by Anthony Skene (real name G.N. Phillips) until <<1941|18:0>> when, in The Affair of the Bronze Basilisk, he would die in an air-raid. The Sexton Blake Library finished in the early 1960s, but not before it had published my first novel Caribbean Crisis under a house pseudonym. Blake stories, however, continue to be written to this day.",
