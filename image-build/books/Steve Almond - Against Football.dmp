            "It\x{2019}s true: we accepted the pain. I can remember being knocked cold in a game with some bigger kids and staggering home from Los Robles Park with a knot above my eye and a thumping headache, livid they wouldn\x{2019}t let me keep playing. I was probably nine. At a sleepover in seventh grade, we snuck out for a <<midnight|13>> game and Steve Hayes tripped on a sprinkler head and broke his arm and we got his best friend to walk him home so his dad could drive him to the emergency room so we could finish the contest.",

            "By <<2004|9n:0>>, Tillman had been redeployed to Afghanistan. That April, he was killed in what military officials described as a firefight near the Pakistan border. He was awarded the Silver Star, a medal reserved for soldiers who exhibit \x{201c}gallantry in action against an enemy of the United States.\x{201d} ESPN broadcast his memorial service live. His former team, the Phoenix Cardinals, erected a Pat Tillman Freedom Plaza outside its stadium. Even in death, Tillman\x{2019}s identity was being carefully constructed.
