Janet Evason appeared on Broadway at <<two o\'clock in the afternoon|6>> in her
underwear. She didn\'t lose her head. Though the nerves try to keep going
in the previous track, she went into evasive position the second after she
arrived (good for her) with her fair, dirty hair flying and her khaki shorts
and shirt stained with sweat. When a policeman tried to take her arm, she
threatened him with le savate, but he vanished. She seemed to regard the
crowds around her with a special horror. The policeman reappeared in the
same spot an hour later with no memory of the interval, but Janet Evason
had returned to her sleeping bag in the New Forest only a few moments after
her arrival. A few words of Pan-Russian and she was gone. The last of them
waked her bedmate in the New Forest.',

you can get old films of Mae West or Marlene Dietrich (who is a Vulcan; look

that pot helps, at fifteen that reading's even better. She learned, wearing
her rimless glasses, that the world is full of intelligent, attractive, talented
women who manage to combine careers with their primary responsibilities as
wives and mothers and whose husbands beat them. She's put a gold circle pin
on her shirt as a concession to club day. She loves her father and once is
enough. Everyone knows that much as women want to be scientists
and engineers, they want foremost to be womanly companions to men (what?)

a woman's identity inheres in the style of her attractiveness. Laur is daydreaming.

sitting tailor-fashion on her bed, she'll read Engels on the family and make

  Under the Mashopi mountain range is a town called Wounded Knee and beyond
this the agricultural plain of Green Bay. Janet could not have told you where
the equivalents of these landmarks are in the here-and-now of our world and
neither can I, the author. In the great terra-reforming convulsion of P.C.
400 the names themselves dissolved into the general mess of re-crystallization
so that it would be impossible for any Whileawayan to tell you (if you were
to ask) whether Mashopi was ever a city, or Wounded Knee a kind of bush,
or whether or not Green Bay was ever a real bay. But if you go South from
the Altiplano over the Mashopi Range, and from that land of snow, cold, thin
air, risk, and glaciers, to the glider resort at Utica (from whence you may
see mountain climbers setting off for Old Dirty-Skirts, who stands twenty-three
thousand, nine hundred feet high) and from there to the monorail station
at Wounded Knee, and if you take the monorail eight hundred miles into Green
Bay and get off at a station I won't name, you'll be where Janet was when
she had just turned seventeen. A Whileawayan who had come from the Mars training
settlement in the Altiplano would have thought Green Bay was heaven; a hiker
out of New Forest would have hated it. Janet had come by herself from an
undersea farm on the continental shelf on the other side of the Altiplano
where she had spent five wretched weeks setting up machinery in inaccessible
crannies and squeaking whenever she talked (because of the helium). She had
left her schoolmates there, crazy for space and altitude. It's not usual
to be alone at that age. She had stayed at the hostel in Wounded Knee, where
they gave her an old, unused cubicle from which she could work by induction
in the fuel-alcohol distillery. People were nice, but it was a miserable
and boring time. You are never so alone, schoolmates or not. You never feel
so all-thumbs (Janet). She made her insistence on change formally, the line
of work came through, goodbye everybody. She had left a violin in Wounded
Knee with a friend who used to cantilever herself out of the third story
of the hostel and eat snacks on the head of a public statue. Janet took the
monorail at <<twenty-two o'clock|6>> and sulkily departed for a better personal
world. There were four persons of Three-Quarters Dignity in the car, all
quiet, all wretched with discontent. She opened her knapsack, wrapped herself
in it, and slept. She woke in artificial light to find that the engineer
had opened the louvers to let in April: magnolias were blooming in Green
Bay. She played linear poker with an old woman from the Altiplano who beat
her three times out of three. At dawn everyone was asleep and the lights
winked out; she woke and watched the low hills form and re-form outside under
an apple-green sky that turned, as she watched it, a slow, sulphurous yellow.
It rained but they sped through it. At the station\x{97}which was nothing but
the middle of a field\x{97}she borrowed a bicycle from the bicycle rack and flipped
the toggle to indicate the place she wanted to go. It's a stout machine,
with broad tires (compared to ours) and a receiver for registering radio
beacons. She rode into the remaining night hung between the plantations of
evergreens, then out into the sunrise again. There was an almighty cheeping
and chirping, the result of one limb of the sun becoming visible over the
horizon. She could see the inflated main dome of the house before she reached
the second bicycle drop; somebody going West would pick it up in time and
drop it near the monorail. She imagined great masses of sulky girls being
requisitioned to ride bicycles coast-to-coast from regions that had a bicycle
surplus to those crying out for bicycles. I imagined it, too. There was the
sound of a machinist's ground-car off to the left\x{97}Janet grew up with that
noise in her ears. Her bicycle was singing the musical tone that lets you
know you're on course, a very lovely sound to hear over the empty fields.
\"Sh!\" she said and put it on the rack, where it obediently became silent.
She walked (and so did I) to the main dome of the house and let herself in,
not knowing whether everyone was sleeping late or had got up early and already
gone out. She didn't care. We found the empty guest room, ate some stirabout\x{97}that's
not what you think, it's a kind of bread\x{97}from her knapsack, lay down on the
floor, and fell asleep.",

a sort of dramatic presentation, for Jeannine will have a big wedding. Mrs.
Dadier drops her gardening trowel in sheer astonishment. She\'ll hurry inside,
a tremendous elevation of mood enveloping both women; they will, in fact,
embrace and kiss one another, and Jeannine will dance around the kitchen.
"Wait \'til Bro hears about this!" Jeannine will exclaim. Both will
cry. It\'s the first time in Jeannine\'s life that she\'s managed to do something
perfectly O.K. And not too late, either. She thinks that perhaps the lateness
of her marriage will be compensated for by a special mellowness; there must
be, after all, some reason for all that experimenting, all that reluctance.
She imagines the day she will be able to announce even better news: "Mother,
I\'m going to have a baby." Cal himself hardly figures in this at all, for
Jeannine has forgotten his laconism, his passivity, his strange mournfulness
unconnected to any clear emotion, his abruptness, how hard it is to get him
to talk about anything. She hugs herself, breathless with joy, waiting for
Mrs. Dadier to hurry inside; "My little baby!" Mrs. Dadier will say emotionally,
embracing Jeannine. It seems to Jeannine that she has never known anything
so solid and beautiful as the kitchen in the morning sunlight, with the walls
glowing and everything so delicately outlined in light, so fresh and real.
Jeannine, who has almost been killed by an unremitting and drastic discipline
not of her own choosing, who has been maimed almost to death by a vigilant
self-suppression quite irrelevant to anything she once wanted or loved, here
finds her reward. This proves it is all right. Everything is indubitably
good and indubitably real. She loves herself, and if I stand like Atropos
in the corner, with my arm around the shadow of her dead self, if the other
Jeannine (who is desperately tired and knows there is no freedom for her
this side the grave) attempts to touch her as she whirls joyfully past, Jeannine
does not see or hear it. At <<one|9m:0>> stroke she has amputated her past. She\'s
going to be fulfilled. She hugs herself and waits. That\'s all you have to
do if you are a real, first-class Sleeping Beauty. She knows.',

  She took us topside in the branch elevator: The Young One, The Weak
One, The Strong One, as she called us in her own mind. I'm the author and
I know. Miss Sweden (she also called Janet this) ran her hands over
the paneling and studied the controls while the other two gaped. Think of
me in my usual portable form. Their underground cities are mazes of corridors
like sunken hotels; we passed doors, barricades, store windows, branch corridors
leading to arcades. What is this passion for living underground? At <<one|9m:1>> barrier
they put us in purdah, that is, some kind of asbestos-like fireman's suit
that protects you against other people's germs and them against yours. But
this time it was a fake, meant only to hide us. \"Can't have them looking
at you,\" said Jael. She went apart with the border guard and there was some
low-voiced, aggressive byplay, some snarling and lifting of hackles which
a third party resolved by a kind of rough joking. I didn't hear a word of
it. She told us honestly that we couldn't be expected to believe anything
we hadn't seen with our own eyes. There would be no films, no demonstrations,
no statistics, unless we asked for them. We trundled out of the elevator
into an armored car waiting in a barn, and across an unpaved, shell-pocked
plain, a sort of no-man's-land, in the middle of the night. Is the grass
growing? Is that a virus blight? Are the mutated strains taking over
 ? Nothing but gravel, boulders, space, and stars. Jael flashed her pass
at a second set of guards and told them about us, jerking her thumb backwards
at the three of us: unclean, unclean, unclean. No barriers, no barbed wire,
no searchlights; only the women have these. Only the men make a sport of
people-hunting across the desert. Bulkier than three pregnancies, we followed
our creatrix into another car, from out that first one, through the rubble
and ruin at the edges of an old city, left standing just as it had been during
the plague. Teachers come out here on Sundays, with their classes. It looks
as if it's been used for target practice, with holes in everything and new
scars, like mortar scars, on the rubble. \"It has,\" says Jael Reasoner. Each
of us wears a luminous, shocking-pink cross on chest and back to show how
deadly we are. So the Manlanders (who all carry guns) won't take pot-shots
at us. There are lights in the distance\x{97}don't think I know any of this by
hearsay; I'm the spirit of the author and know all things. I'll know it when
we begin to pass the lit-up barracks at the edge of the city, when we see
in the distance the homes of the very rich shining from the seven hilltops
on which the city is built; I'll know it when we go through a tunnel of rubble,
built fashionably to resemble a World War I trench, and emerge neither into
a public nursery (they're either much further inside the city proper or out
in the country) nor into a brothel, but into a recreation center called The
Trench or The Prick or The Crotch or The Knife. I haven't decided on a name
yet. The Manlanders keep their children with them only when they're very
rich\x{97}but what posit I? Manlanders have no children. Manlanders buy infants
from the Womanlanders and bring them up in batches, save for the rich few
who can order children made from their very own semen: keep them in city
nurseries until they're five, then out into the country training ground,
with the gasping little misfits buried in baby cemeteries along the way.
There, in ascetic and healthful settlements in the country, little boys are
made into Men\x{97}though some don't quite make it; sex-change surgery begins
at sixteen. One out of seven fails early and makes the full change; one out
of seven fails later and (refusing surgery) makes only half a change: artists,
illusionists, impressionists of femininity who keep their genitalia but who
grow slim, grow languid, grow emotional and feminine, all this the effect
of spirit only. Five out of seven Manlanders make it; these are \"real-men.\"
