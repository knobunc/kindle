She lived in those days in Ban\x{ed}. Not the frenzied Ban\x{ed} of right now, supported by an endless supply of DoYos who\x{2019}ve laid claim to most of Boston, Providence, New Hampshire. This was the lovely Ban\x{ed} of times past, beautiful and respectful. A city famed for its resistance to blackness, and it was here, alas, that the darkest character in our story resided. On one of the main streets near the central plaza. In a house that no longer stands. It was here that Beli lived with her mother-aunt, if not exactly content, then certainly in a state of relative tranquility. From 1951 on, \x{2018}hija\x{2019} and \x{2018}madre\x{2019} running their famous bakery near the Plaza Central and keeping their fading, airless house in tip-top shape. (Before <<1951|9c:0>>, our orphaned girl had lived with another foster family, monstrous people if the rumors are to be believed, a dark period of her life neither she nor her madre ever referenced. Their very own p\x{e1}gina en blanco.)",

            "For the first month, that is. Gradually Beli began to see beyond the catcalls and the Dios m\x{ed}o asesina and the y ese tetator\x{ed}o and the que pechonalidad to the hidden mechanisms that drove these comments. One day on the way back from the bakery, La Inca muttering at her side about that day\x{2019}s receipts, it dawned on Beli: Men liked her! Not only did they like her, they liked her a fucking lot. The proof was the day that one of their customers, the local dentist, slipped her a note with his money, and it said, I want to see you, as simple as that. Beli was terrified, scandalized, and giddy. The dentist had a fat wife who ordered a cake from La Inca almost every month, either for one of her seven children or for her fifty-some cousins (but most likely for her and her alone). She had a wattle and an enormous middle-aged ass that challenged all chairs. Beli mooned over that note like it was a marriage proposal from God\x{2019}s hot son, even though the dentist was bald and paunchier than an OTB regular and had a tracery of fine red veins all over his cheeks. The dentist came in as he always did but now his eyes were always questing, Hello, Senorita Beli! his greeting now fetid with lust and threat, and Beli\x{2019}s heart would beat like nothing she\x{2019}d ever heard. <<After two|9:0>> such visits she wrote, on a whim, a little note that said simply, Yes, you can pick me up at the park at tal-and-tal time, and passed it back to him with his change and by hook and crook arranged to be walking with La Inca through the park at the very moment of the assignation. Her heart going like crazy; she didn\x{2019}t know what to expect but she had a wild hope, and just as they were about to leave the park, Beli spotted the dentist sitting in a car that was not his, pretending to read the paper but looking forlornly in her direction. Look, Madre, Beli said loudly, it\x{2019}s the dentist, and La Inca turned and homeboy threw the car frantically into gear and tore out of there before La Inca could even wave. How very strange! La Inca said.",

            "When Beli encountered the Gangster, that ignominious <<midnight|13>> flight still haunted him. Beyond the financial attachment, Cuba was an important component to his prestige \x{2014} to his manhood, really \x{2014} and our man could still not accept the fact that the country had fallen to a rabble of scurvied students. Some days he was better than others, but whenever the latest news reached him of the revolution\x{2019}s activities he would pull his hair and attack the nearest wall in sight. Not a day passed when he did not fulminate against Batista (That ox! That peasant!) or Castro (The goat-fucking comunista!) or CIA chief Allen Dulles (That effeminate!), who had failed to stop Batista\x{2019}s ill-advised Mother\x{2019}s Day Amnesty that freed Fidel and the other moncadistas to fight another day.

            'Beli in love! <<Round Two|9:0>>! But unlike what happened with Pujols, this was the real deal: pure uncut unadulterated love, the Holy Grail that would so bedevil her children throughout their lives. Consider that Beli had longed, hungered, for a chance to be in love and to be loved back (not very long in real time but a forever by the chronometer of her adolescence). Never had the opportunity in her first lost childhood; and in the intervening years her desire for it had doubled over and doubled over like a katana being forged until finally it was sharper than the truth. With the Gangster our girl finally got her chance. Who is surprised that in the final four months of her relationship with him there would be such an outpouring of affect? As expected: she, the daughter of the Fall, recipient of its heaviest radiations, loved atomically.',

            "The next day the protective bubble about their idyll finally burst and the troubles of the real world came rushing in. A motorcycle driven by a hugely overweight policeman arrived at their cabana. Capitan, you\x{2019}re needed in the Palacio, he said from under his chinstrap. More trouble with the subversives, it seems. I\x{2019}ll send a car for you, the Gangster promised. Wait, she said, I\x{2019}ll go with you, not wanting to be left, again, but he either didn\x{2019}t hear or didn\x{2019}t care. Wait, goddamn it, she shouted in frustration. But the motorcycle never slowed. Wait! The ride never materialized either. Fortunately Beli had gotten into the habit of stealing his money while he slept so that she could maintain herself during his absences; otherwise she would have been stranded on that fucking beach. After waiting eight hours like a parig\x{fc}aya she hoisted her bag (left his shit in the cabana) and marched through the simmering heat like a vengeance on two legs, walked for what felt like half a day, until at last she happened upon a colmado, where a couple of sunstroked campesinos were sharing a warm beer while the colmadero, seated in the only shade in sight, waved the flies from his dukes. When they realized she was standing over them they all scrambled to their feet. By then her anger had drained away and she only wanted to be spared further walking. Do you know anybody who has a car? And by <<noon|13>> she was in a dust-choked Chevy, heading home. You better hold the door, the driver advised, or it might fall of.",

Even in the middle of the night, doesn\x{2019}t take much to get into the station or to walk out onto the tracks, which is exactly what he did. Stumbled out toward the river, toward Route 18. New Brunswick falling away beneath him until he was seventy-seven feet in the air. Seventy-seven feet precisely. From what he would later recall, he stood on that bridge for a good long time. Watching the streaking lights of the traffic below. Reviewing his miserable life. Wishing he\x{2019}d been born in a different body. Regretting all the books he would never write. Maybe trying to get himself to reconsider. And then the <<4:12|2>> express to Washington blew in the distance. By then he was barely able to stand.
