I thought she was easy because she was sleeping in the same room as the owner of the place. But it turned out later, he never laid a finger on her\x{2014}couldn\x{2018}t, in fact. She was his beard. Anyway, she was painting murals, so I got her to paint my drum. We fell madly in love. After the summer, I visited her once a week, taking the subway from Brooklyn to Upper Riverside Drive. Papa and Mama always left us alone. We took chances that were unbelievable. I think I first said I loved her on the top of an open Fifth Avenue bus. Do you know that they had open Fifth Avenue buses? I was working at Paul\x{2019}s Rendezvous with a five-piece band and also trying somehow to go to NYU at night. At seven dollars a point, I couldn\x{2019}t afford it. (As I said, I never knew I got into City College.) Maxwell Bodenheim used to come into Paul\x{2019}s Rendezvous to recite poetry in exchange for a drink: \x{201c}Death comes like jewels dropped in a velvet bag ...\x{201d} I seem to remember. We got married in 1933 because the Volstead Act was being repealed and we thought there\x{2019}d be work in the clubs. Roosevelt was inaugurated in March. People were starving: apple sellers on the streets, Hooverville on the river. Our first apartment was on Twenty-second Street between Eighth and Ninth. It was a rooming house with the bathtub in the middle of the kitchen. We\x{2019}d get two months concession on the rent and move out when the concession was up. We lived in a lot of places that way. At one time we were at 118th and Riverside Drive\x{2014}thrilled to be on the same avenue as George Gershwin. Musicians worked from <<eight o\x{2019}clock|6>> until unconscious. Eda would meet me and we\x{2019}d walk home at night up Broadway and have breakfast at Nedick\x{2019}s. Romantic. She worked all day demonstrating art supplies at Bloomingdale\x{2019}s. She got to take home the paints, so it seemed like a good deal. We never slept. Then, when I was twenty-four, in 1935, I got my first big break. Mickey Green the agent\x{2014}don\x{2019}t use his name, he\x{2019}s still alive\x{2014}got me an audition with Cole Porter for Jubilee\x{2014}and I got the job. From then on I was working.",

His hair is slicked back with Brylcreem and he reeks of ice-blue Aqua Velva. The smell evokes tinkling pianos in the next apartment and <<midnight|13>>-blue limousines with phallic fins. He dances like a dream, gliding over floors of polished anthracite in his polished anthracite shoes. He is desire, love, luck, a trip to the moon on gossamer wings. He can play anything from his fake book\x{2014}forgotten songs like \x{201c}So Many Memories\x{201d} or \x{201c}The Jersey Bounce,\x{201d} and famous songs like \x{201c}Love Walked In\x{201d} and \x{201c}Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.\x{201d} He can dance the tango, the mambo, the rhumba with an h, and when he leaves, he gives you the blues (but you\x{2019}d rather have the blues than any other guy). He is Daddy and the wild redheaded boy with the Harvard scarf who held the doors of the subway train on Seventy-eighth Street and Central Park West. Once, he sweated into a T-shirt, left it in your hamper, and you pulled it out and never washed it. You have been sleeping with it ever since.",

            "Everyone else you have loved or married is a stand-in for the Famous Guy. His eyes are blue and green and brown and warm gold all at once. He can change heads faster than Princess Langwidere. As you get older, you meet him less and less often. A snatch of melody wafting through a wall, a scent of sweat and sweet cologne, and you seem to see him. Once, you cruised the city in a <<midnight|13>> limousine looking for him, sure that when you found him you would drag him into it and make love right there on the floor, while the chauffeur with the Braille eyes and the crystal skull drove like wet velvet, giving you the chance to do the same. Oh, Famous Guy\x{2014}when will you come to live in my life?",

            "At the end of November, there is an eclipse of the moon. Ken and I have driven all the way back from Vermont under its full golden disc and, at <<midnight|13>>, we climb up the back stairs of our apartment building to the twenty-ninth floor, exit the stairwell at the roof level, and walk among the stars. The city is still. The roof looks like a lunar landscape. The traffic noises seem suddenly stopped. And we stand alone in the middle of the roof, heads tilted back until they hurt, watching a dark shadow encroach across the face of the moon. It takes an hour and a half for the eclipse to be total. We stand transfixed and shivering, unable to leave until the whole disc is closed in darkness. When a sliver of light emerges on the other side, I say, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m glad I saw that.\x{201d}",
