            "Every spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs\x{2019} notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during <<prime|16>> time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV\x{2019}s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it\x{2019}s still an art form, of hearing people in \$5,000 gowns invoke lush clich\x{e9}s of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.\x{2014}the whole cynical postmodern deal\x{2014}but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there\x{2019}s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there\x{2019}s still joy. That we think it\x{2019}s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.",

If the purpose of displaying a flag is to make a statement, it seems like at a certain point of density of flags you\x{2019}re making more of a statement if you don\x{2019}t have a flag out. It\x{2019}s not totally clear what statement this would be, though. What if you just don\x{2019}t happen to have a flag? Where has everyone gotten these flags, especially the little ones you can fasten to your mailbox? Are they all from the Fourth of July and people just save them, like Christmas ornaments? How do they know to do this? There\x{2019}s nothing in the Yellow Pages under Flag. At some point there starts to be actual tension. Nobody walks by or stops their car and says, \x{201c}Hey, how come your house doesn\x{2019}t have a flag?,\x{201d} but it gets easier and easier to imagine them thinking it. Even a sort of half-collapsed house down the street that everybody thought was abandoned has one of the little flags on a stick in the weeds by the driveway. None of Bloomington\x{2019}s grocery stores turn out to stock flags. The big novelty shop downtown has nothing but Halloween stuff.

The cold reality is that there is not a flag to be had in this town. Stealing one out of somebody\x{2019}s yard is clearly just out of the question. I\x{2019}m standing in a fluorescent-lit KWIK-N-EZ afraid to go home. All those people dead, and I\x{2019}m sent to the edge by a plastic flag. It doesn\x{2019}t get really bad until people come over and ask if I\x{2019}m OK and I have to lie and say it\x{2019}s a Benadryl reaction (which in fact can happen).",

In 1989, her one serious attempt at a comeback ended on the way to the US Open, when a speeder ran a red light and nearly killed her.

            "Dear Person Reading This:
Evidently I\x{2019}m supposed to say something about what the following document is and where it came from.
From what I understand, in autumn 1999 the powers that be at Rolling Stone magazine decided they wanted to get four writers who were not political journalists to do articles on the four big presidential candidates and their day-to-day campaigns in the early primaries. My own r\x{e9}sum\x{e9} happens to have \x{201c}NOT A POLITICAL JOURNALIST\x{201d} right there at the very top, and Rolling Stone magazine called, and pitched the idea, and furthermore said I could pick whichever candidate I wanted (which of course was flattering, although in retrospect they probably told the other three writers the same thing\x{2014}magazines are always very flattering and carte blancheish when they\x{2019}re trying to get you to do something). The only candidate I could see trying to write about was Senator John McCain (R-AZ), whom I\x{2019}d seen a recent tape of on Charlie Rose and had decided was either incredibly honest and forthright or else just insane. There were other reasons for wanting to write about McCain and party politics, too, all of which are explored in considerable detail in the document itself and so I don\x{2019}t see any reason to inflict them on you here. 
The Electronic Editor (actual title, like on his office letterhead and everything) says I should insert here that I, the author, am not a Republican, and that actually I ended up voting for Sen. Bill Bradley (D-NJ) in the Illinois primary. I don\x{2019}t personally see how my own politics are anybody\x{2019}s business, but I\x{2019}m guessing the point of the insertion is to make clear that there are no partisan motives or conservative agenda behind the article even though parts of it (i.e., of the upcoming article) might appear to be pro-McCain. It\x{2019}s not, though neither is it anti-; it\x{2019}s just meant to be the truth as one person saw it. 
What else to tell you. At first I was supposed to follow McCain around in New Hampshire as he campaigned for 1 February\x{2019}s big primary there. Then, around Christmastime, Rolling Stone decided that they wanted to abort the assignment because Governor Bush was way ahead in the polls and outspending McCain <<ten to one|10a:0>> and they thought McCain was going to get flattened in New Hampshire and that his campaign would be over by the time anything could come out in Rolling Stone and that they\x{2019}d look stupid. Then on 1 February, when the early NH returns had McCain ahead, the magazine suddenly turned around and called again and said the article was a Go again but that now they wanted me to fly out to NH and start that very night, which (because I happen to have dogs with professionally diagnosed emotional problems who require special care, and it always takes me several days to recruit, interview, select, instruct, and field-test a dogsitter) was out of the question. Some of this is probably not too germane, but the point is that I ended up flying out the following week and riding with the McCain2000 traveling press corps from 7 to 13 February, which in retrospect was probably the most interesting and complicated week of the whole 2000 GOP race. 
Especially the complicated part. For it turned out that the more interesting a campaign-related person or occurrence or intrigue or strategy or happenstance was, the more time and page-space it took to make sense of it, or, if it made no sense, to describe what it was and explain why it didn\x{2019}t make sense but was interesting anyway if viewed in a certain context that then itself had to be described, and so on. With the end result being that the actual document delivered per contract to Rolling Stone magazine turned out to be longer and more complicated than they\x{2019}d asked for. Quite a bit longer, actually. In fact the article\x{2019}s editor pointed out that running the whole thing would take up most of Rolling Stone\x{2019}s text-space and might even cut into the percentage of the magazine reserved for advertisements, which obviously would not do.  And so at least half the article got cut out, plus some of the more complicated stuff got way compressed and simplified, which was especially disappointing because, as previously mentioned, the most complicated stuff also tended to be the most interesting. 
The point here is that what you\x{2019}ve just now purchased the ability to download or have e-mailed to you or whatever (it\x{2019}s been explained to me several times, but I still don\x{2019}t totally understand it) is the original uncut document, the as it were director\x{2019}s cut, verbally complete and unoccluded by any lush photos of puffy-lipped girls with their Diesels half unzipped, etc. 
There are only a couple changes. All typos and factual boners have now (hopefully) been fixed, for one thing. There were also certain places where the original article talked about the fact that it was appearing in Rolling Stone magazine and that whoever was reading it was sitting there actually holding a copy of Rolling Stone, etc., and many of these got changed because it just seemed too weird to keep telling you you were reading this in an actual 10\" \x{a5} 12\" magazine when you now quite clearly are not. (Again, this was the Electronic Editor\x{2019}s suggestion.) You will note, though, that the author is usually still referred to in the document as \x{201c}Rolling Stone\x{201d} or \x{201c}RS.\x{201d} I\x{2019}m sorry if this looks strange to you, but I have declined to change it. Part of the reason is that I was absurdly proud of my Rolling Stone press badge and of the fact that most of the pencils and campaign staff referred to me as \x{201c}the guy from Rolling Stone.\x{201d} I will confess that I even borrowed a friend\x{2019}s battered old black leather jacket to wear on the Trail so I\x{2019}d better project the kind of edgy, vaguely dangerous vibe I imagined an RS reporter ought to give off. (You have to understand that I hadn\x{2019}t read Rolling Stone in quite some time.) Plus, journalistically, my covering the campaign for this particular organ turned out to have a big effect on what I got to see and how various people conducted themselves when I was around. For example, it was the main reason why the McCain2000 High Command pretty much refused to have anything to do with me  but why the network techs were so friendly and forthcoming and let me hang around with them (the sound techs, in particular, were Rolling Stone fans from way back). Finally, the document itself is sort of rhetorically directed at voters of a particular age-range and attitude, and I\x{2019}m figuring that the occasional Rolling Stone reference might help keep the reasons for some of this rhetoric clear. 
The other thing I\x{2019}d note is simply what the article\x{2019}s about, which turned out to be not so much the campaign of one impressive guy, but rather what McCain\x{2019}s candidacy and the brief weird excitement it generated might reveal about how millennial politics and all its packaging and marketing and strategy and media and spin and general sepsis actually makes us US voters feel, inside, and whether anyone running for anything can even be \x{201c}real\x{201d} anymore\x{2014}whether what we actually want is something real or something else. Whether it works on your screen or Palm or not, for me the whole thing ended up relevant in ways far beyond any one man or magazine. If you don\x{2019}t agree, I imagine you\x{2019}ll have only to press a button or two to make it all go away.",

            "Facts. The 1996 presidential election had the lowest Young Voter turnout in US history. The 2000 GOP primary in New Hampshire had the highest. And the experts agree that McCain drew most of them. He drew first-time and never-before voters; he drew Democrats and Independents, Libertarians and soft socialists and college kids and soccer moms and weird furtive guys whose affiliations sounded more like cells than parties, and won by 18 points, and nearly wiped the smirk off Bush2\x{2019}s face.

Bullshit 1 is the caravan\x{2019}s second bus, a luxury Grumman with good current and workable phone jacks, and a lot of the national pencils use it to pound out copy on their laptops and send faxes and e-mail stuff to their editors. The campaign\x{2019}s logistics are dizzyingly complex, and one of the things the McCain2000 staff has to do is rent different buses and decorate the nicest one with STRAIGHT TALK EXPRESS and McCAIN2000.COM in each new state. In Michigan yesterday there was just the STE plus one bus for non-elite press, which had powder-gray faux-leather couches and gleaming brushed-steel fixtures and a mirrored ceiling from front to back; it creeped everyone out and was christened the Pimpmobile. The two press buses in South Carolina are known as Bullshit 1 and Bullshit 2, names conceived as usual by the extremely cool and laid-back NBC News cameraman Jim C. and\x{2014}to their credit\x{2014}immediately seized on and used with great glee at every opportunity by McCain\x{2019}s younger Press Liaisons, who are themselves so cool and unpretentious it\x{2019}s tempting to suspect that they are professionally cool and unpretentious.",

            "Plus Bullshit 1 is also a box, of course, just the way anything you can\x{2019}t exit till somebody else lets you out is, and right now there are 27 members of the national political media on board, halfway to Charleston. A certain percentage of them aren\x{2019}t worth introducing you to because they\x{2019}ll get rotated back off the Trail tonight and be gone tomorrow, replaced by others you\x{2019}ll just be starting to recognize by the time they too rotate out. That\x{2019}s what these pros call it, the Trail, the same way musicians talk about the Road. The schedule is fascist: wake-up call and backup alarm at <<0600h|1>>, express check-out, Baggage Call at <<0700|18:1>> to throw bags and techs\x{2019} gear under the bus, haul ass to McCain\x{2019}s first THM at <<0800|9c:1>>, then another, then another, maybe an hour off to F&F someplace if ODTs permit, then usually two big evening events, plus hours of dead highway DT between functions, finally getting into that night\x{2019}s Marriott or Hampton Inn at like 2300 just when room service closes so that you\x{2019}re begging rides from FoxNews to find a restaurant still open, then an hour at the hotel bar to try to shut your head off so you can hit the rack at <<0130|9c:1>> and get up at <<0600|9c:1>> and do it all again. Usually it\x{2019}s four to six days for the average pencil and then you go off home on a gurney and your editor rotates in fresh meat. The network techs, who are old hands at the Trail, stay on for months at a time. The McCain2000 staff have all been doing this full-time since Labor Day, and even the young ones look like the walking dead. Only McCain seems to thrive. He\x{2019}s 63 and practically Rockette-kicks onto the Express every morning. It\x{2019}s either inspiring or frightening.",

            "Here\x{2019}s a quick behind-the-scenes tour of everything that\x{2019}s happening on BS1 at <<1330h|1>>. A few of the press are slumped over sleeping, open-mouthed and twitching, using their topcoats for pillows. The CBS and NBC techs are in their usual place on the couches way up front, their cameras and sticks and boom mikes and boxes of tapes and big Duracells piled around them, discussing obscure stand-up comedians of the early 70s and trading press badges from New Hampshire and Iowa and Delaware, which badges are laminated and worn around the neck on nylon cords and apparently have value for collectors. Jim C., who looks like a chronically sleep-deprived Elliott Gould, is also watching Travis\x{2019}s leather bookbag swing metronomically by its over-shoulder strap as Travis leans against the safety bar and dozes. All the couches and padded chairs face in, perpendicular to BS1\x{2019}s length, instead of a regular bus\x{2019}s forward-facing seats. So everyone\x{2019}s legs are always out in the aisle, but there\x{2019}s none of the normal social anxiety about your leg maybe touching somebody else on a bus\x{2019}s leg because nobody can help it and everyone\x{2019}s too tired to care. Right behind each set of couches are small white plastic tables with recessed cup-receptacles and AC outlets that work if Jay can be induced to turn on the generator (which he will unless he\x{2019}s low on fuel); and the left side\x{2019}s table has two pencils and two field producers at it, and one of the pencils is Alison Mitchell, as in the Alison Mitchell, who is the NY Times\x{2019}s daily eye on McCain and a very high-end journalist but not (refreshingly) one of the Twelve Monkeys, a slim calm kindly lady of maybe 45 who wears dark tights, pointy boots, a black sweater that looks home-crocheted, and a perpetual look of concerned puzzlement, as if life were one long request for clarification. Alison Mitchell is usually a regular up on the Straight Talk Express but today has a tight <<1500h|1>> deadline and is using BS1\x{2019}s superior current to whip out the story on her Apple PowerBook. (Even from outside the bus it\x{2019}s easy to tell who\x{2019}s banging away on a laptop right then, because their window shades are always down against daytime glare, which is every laptop-journalist\x{2019}s great nemesis.) An ABC field producer across the table from A. Mitchell is trying to settle a credit card dispute on his distinctive cell phone, which is not a headset phone per se but consists of an earplug and a tiny hanging podular thing he holds to his mouth with two fingers to speak, a device that manages to make him look simultaneously deaf and schizophrenic. People in both seats behind the table are reading USA Today (and this might be worth noting\x{2014}the only news daily read by every single member of the national campaign press is, believe it or not, USA Today, which always appears as if by dark magic under everybody\x{2019}s hotel door with their express check-out bill every morning, and is free, and media are as susceptible to shrewd marketing as anybody else). The local TV truck\x{2019}s muffler gets louder the farther back you go. About two-thirds of the way down the aisle is a little area that has the bus\x{2019}s refrigerator and the liquor cabinets (the latter unbelievably well stocked on yesterday\x{2019}s Pimpmobile, totally empty on BS1) and the bathroom with the hazardous door. There\x{2019}s also a little counter area piled with Krispy Kreme doughnut boxes, and a sink whose water nobody ever uses (for what turn out to be good reasons). Krispy Kremes are sort of the Deep South equivalent of Dunkin\x{2019} Donuts, ubiquitous and cheap and great in a sort of what-am-I-doing-eating-dessert-for-breakfast way, and are a cornerstone of what Jim C. calls the Campaign Diet.",

In the primary campaign there is no more definitive behind-the-scenes locale than an F&F Room, which is usually some hotel\x{2019}s little third-string banquet- or meeting room off the lobby that McCain2000 rents (at the media\x{2019}s expense, precisely prorated and tallied, just like each day\x{2019}s seat on the buses and plane and the continental breakfasts before Baggage Call and even the F&F Rooms\x{2019} \x{201c}catered lunches,\x{201d} which today are strange bright-red ham on Wonder Bread, Fritos, and coffee that tastes like hot water with a brown crayon in it, and the pencils all bitch about the McCain2000 food and wistfully recount rumors that the Bush2000 press lunches are supposedly hot and multi-food group and served on actual plates by unctuous men with white towels over their arm) so that those media with PM deadlines can finish their stories and file and feed. In Flint, the F&F Room is a 60' \x{a5} 50' banquet room with fluorescent chandeliers and overpatterned carpet and eight long tables with fax machines, outlets and jacks, and folding chairs (padded) for the corps to sit in and open notebooks and set up laptops and Sony SX- and DVS-Series Digital Editors and have at it. By <<1515h|1>>, each chair is filled by a producer or pencil trying to eat and type and talk on the phone all at once, and there\x{2019}s an enormous bespectacled kid of unknown origin and status going around with NoGlare Computer Screen Light Filters and Power Strip Anti-Surge Eight-Slot Adapters and offering technical support for people whose laptops or phones are screwing up, and Travis and Todd and the other Press Liaisons are handing out reams of daily press releases, and the whole F&F Room is up and running and alive with the quadruple-ding of Windows booting up, the honk and static of modem connections, the multiphase clicking of 40+ keyboards, the needly screech of fax gear saying hi to New York and Atlanta, and the murmur of people on headset phones doing the same. The Twelve Monkeys have their own long table and are seated there in some very precise hierarchical order known only to them, each positioned exactly the same with his ankles crossed under his chair and a steno notebook and towering bottle of Evian at his left hand.",

            "\x{201c}OTS\x{201d} is, as previously mentioned, Trailese for \x{201c}Opportunity to Smoke,\x{201d} which with very few exceptions only the techs seem to do\x{2014}and do a lot\x{2014}and which is prohibited on the buses even if you promise to exhale very carefully out the window; and so just about the only good thing about F&Fs is that they\x{2019}re basically one long OTS, although even here you have to go all the way outside in the cold and look at Flint, and the techs are required to get permission from their producers and let them know exactly where they\x{2019}ll be. Outside the Riverfront\x{2019}s side door off the parking lot, where it\x{2019}s so cold and windy you have to smoke with mittens on (a practice Rolling Stone in no way recommends), Jim C. and his longtime friend and partner Frank C. detail various other Trail faux pas and expand with no small sympathy on the brutality of these campaign reporters\x{2019} existence: living out of suitcases and trying to keep their clothes pressed; praying that that night\x{2019}s hotel has room service; subsisting on the Campaign Diet, which is basically sugar and caffeine (diabetes is apparently the Black Lung of political journalism). Plus constant deadlines, and the pencils\x{2019} only friends on the Trail are also their competitors, whose articles they\x{2019}re always reading but trying to do it secretly so they don\x{2019}t look insecure. Four young men in jackets over sweatshirts with the hoods all the way up are circling the press\x{2019}s Pimpmobile bus and boosting each other up to try the windows, and the two veteran techs just roll their eyes and wave. The Pimpmobile\x{2019}s driver is nowhere in sight\x{2014}no one knows where drivers go during F&Fs (though there are theories). Also not recommended is trying to smoke in a high wind while jumping up and down in place. Plus, the NBC techs say, it\x{2019}s not just campaigns: political media are always on the road in some type of box for weeks at a time, very alone, connected to loved ones only by cell phone and 1-800 answering service. Rolling Stone speculates that this is maybe why everybody in the McCain2000 press corps, from techs to 12M, sports a wedding band\x{2014}it\x{2019}s important to feel like there\x{2019}s someone to come home to. (His wife\x{2019}s slightly obsessive micromanagement of his health aside, Jim C. credits her presence on the Trail with preserving his basic sanity, at which Frank C. drolly credits his own wife\x{2019}s absence from the Trail with preserving same.) Neither tech smokes filtereds. Rolling Stone mentions being in hotels every night, which before the faux pas shut him down as a source the unnamed sound guy had said was probably the McCain campaign media\x{2019}s number-one stressor. The Shrub apparently stays in five-star places with putting greens and spurting-nymph fountains and a speed-dial number for the house masseur. Not McCain2000, which favors Marriott, Courtyard by Marriott, Hampton Inn, Signature Inn, Radisson, Holiday Inn, Embassy Suites. Rolling Stone, who is in no way cut out to be a road journalist, invokes the soul-killing anonymity of chain hotels, the rooms\x{2019} terrible transient sameness: the ubiquitous floral design of the bedspreads, the multiple low-watt lamps, the pallid artwork bolted to the wall, the schizoid whisper of ventilation, the sad shag carpet, the smell of alien cleansers, the Kleenex dispensed from the wall, the automated wake-up call, the lightproof curtains, the windows that do not open\x{2014}ever. The same TV with the same cable with the same voice saying \x{201c}Welcome to ____________\x{201d} on its menu channel\x{2019}s eight-second loop. The sense that everything in the room\x{2019}s been touched by a thousand hands before. The sounds of others\x{2019} plumbing. RS asks whether it\x{2019}s any wonder that over half of all US suicides take place in chain hotels. Jim and Frank say they get the idea. Frank raises a ski glove in farewell as the young men at the bus finally give up and withdraw. RS references the chain hotel\x{2019}s central paradox: the form of hospitality with none of the feeling\x{2014}cleanliness becomes sterility, the politeness of the staff a vague rebuke. The terrible oxymoron of \x{201c}hotel guest.\x{201d} Hell could easily be a chain hotel. Is it any coincidence that McCain\x{2019}s POW prison was known as the Hanoi Hilton? Jim shrugs; Frank says you get used to it, that it\x{2019}s better not to dwell. Network camera and sound techs earn incredible overtime for staying in the field with a campaign over long periods. Frank C. has been with McCain2000 w/o break since early January and won\x{2019}t rotate out until Easter; the money will finance three months off during which he\x{2019}ll engineer indie records and sleep till <<eleven|9f>> and not think once of hotels or scrums or the weird way your kidneys hurt after jouncing all day on a bus.",

Watching the techs gear up to go scrum around McCain as he boards the Straight Talk Express is a little like watching soldiers outfit themselves for combat: there are numerous multipart packs and cases to strap across backs and chests and to loop around waists and connect and lock down, and pieces of high-priced machinery to load with filters and tape and bulbs and reserve power cells and connect to each other with complex cords and co-ax cable, and weasels to wrap around high-filter boom mikes, and sticks to choose and carefully telescope out all the way till they look like the probosces of some monstrous insect and bob, slightly\x{2014}the soundmen\x{2019}s sticks and mikes do\x{2014}as the techs in the scrum keep pace with McCain and try to keep his head in the center of their shot and right underneath the long stick\x{2019}s mike in case he says something newsworthy. McCain has on a fresh blue pinstripe suit, and his complexion is hectic with CF fever or tactical adrenaline, and as he passes through the Riverfront lobby toward the scrum there\x{2019}s a faint backwash of quality aftershave, and from behind him you can see Cindy McCain using her exquisitely manicured hands to whisk invisible lint off his shoulders, and at moments like this it\x{2019}s difficult not to feel enthused and to really like this man and want to support him in just about any sort of feasible way you can think of.",

He takes a couple more THM questions, then stops abruptly and says he\x{2019}s sorry but he\x{2019}s just so upset about the Chris Duren Incident that he\x{2019}s having a hard time concentrating, and he asks the THM crowd\x{2019}s forgiveness, and thanks them, and forgets his message-discipline and doesn\x{2019}t finish with he\x{2019}ll always.

(The lobby\x{2019}s lined with red and blue rubber\x{2014}yes, rubber\x{2014}and 20 feet up a green iron spiral staircase is an open mezzanine with fencing of mustard-colored pipe from which hang long purple banners for the Lowcountry Youth Hockey Association, and you can hear the rink\x{2019}s organ someplace inside and a symphony of twitters and boings from an enormous video arcade just down the bright-orange hall, and on either side of the THM stage are giant monitors composed of nine identical screens arrayed 3 \x{a5} 3, and the monitor on the left has nine identical McCain faces talking while the one on the right has just one big McCain face cut into nine separate squares, and every square foot of the nauseous lobby is occupied by wildly supportive South Carolinians, and it\x{2019}s at least 95 degrees, and the whole thing is so sensuously assaultive that all the media except Jim C. and the techs turn around and listen facing away, most drinking more than one cup of coffee at once.) And even on four hours\x{2019} sleep at the very outside now McCain on the stage is undergoing the same metamorphosis that happens whenever the crowd is responsive and laughs at his jokes and puts down coffee and kids to applaud when he says he\x{2019}ll beat Al Gore like a drum. In person, McCain is not a sleek gorgeous telegenic presence like Rep. Mark Sanford or the Shrub. McCain is short and slight and stiff in a bit of a twisted way. He tends to look a little sunken in his suit. His voice is a thin tenor and not hypnotic or stirring per se. But onstage, taking questions and pacing like something caged, his body seems to dilate and his voice takes on a resonance, and unlike the Shrub he is bodyguardless and the stage wide open and the questions unscreened and he answers them well, and the best Town Meetings\x{2019} crowds\x{2019} eyes brighten, and unlike Gore\x{2019}s dead bird\x{2019}s eyes or the Shrub\x{2019}s smug glare McCain\x{2019}s own eyes are wide and candid and full of a very attractive inspiring light that\x{2019}s either devotion to causes beyond him or a demagogue\x{2019}s love of the crowd\x{2019}s love or an insatiable hunger to become the most powerful white male on earth. Or all three.",
