Keith Hill, for our side, made a similar response. The complicating factor was the large, brooding presence of JP. Transport, of course, is something he knows all about.

All I said was that exhortations from politicians were not likely to cut much ice with a hard-nosed commercial institution like Barclays, but there was nothing to stop customers voting with their feet. When I got to the House there was a message waiting from Alastair Campbell. I gave him my version of events and he didn\x{2019}t seem bothered. I guess he has to cope with nonsense of this sort every day. Later, I saw the transcript of his morning briefing with the lobby hacks at which my speech was the main item on the agenda. Alastair played a straight bat, sticking up for me throughout. Apparently William Hague was asked about it on Today this morning and, although he distanced himself from the idea of a boycott, he reserved most of his criticism for Barclays. It was left to a woman from the Institute of Directors to huff and puff and say how wicked I was. Needless to say, the entire discussion was based on the false premise that I had called for a boycott.",

I have ended up offending not just The Sisters, but a number of my friends. I had put down an amendment forcing a separate vote on Wednesday sittings which Robin \x{2013} fearing he might lose \x{2013} was anxious to avoid. He was not best pleased and circulated a crib sheet describing mine as \x{2018}a wrecking amendment\x{2019}. The modernisers were well organised and when I got up to speak they were all around me heckling and trying to intervene. \x{2018}Get a life,\x{2019} shouted that ambitious pipsqueak from the Rhondda. I was doing all right until about halfway when I chanced a little joke. (\x{2018}If I was a spouse living at the other end of the country, I would want to be assured that my other half was snug in the warm bosom of the Mother of Parliaments and not wandering the streets with too much time on his hands and too much money in his pockets.\x{2019}) From this point onwards they all went bananas. The harassment became so bad that the Deputy Speaker had to intervene in order that I be heard. I sat down to some hear-hearing from the Tories, but with just about everyone else I had blown it. Jean Corston was furious with me for not giving way to her in the debate. She thought I\x{2019}d deliberately ignored her, but in truth I hadn\x{2019}t seen her (I eventually managed to convince her of this). Dawn Primarolo, a friend for over 20 years, told me that she thought my speech was \x{2018}despicable\x{2019}. Even so, the vote when it came was close. There was some tension since no one had a clue how it would go. In the event it was carried 274 to 267. So they only just got away with it. We have once again voted for our own convenience over the public interest. (Diane Abbott told me she had voted for the reduction in hours \x{2018}out of naked self-interest\x{2019}.) The quality of scrutiny will not be improved one iota. On the contrary, it will be diminished.

To an upper committee room for a meeting which Ann Clwyd has organised with Dr Barham Saleh, \x{2018}prime minister\x{2019} of northern Iraq. A soft-spoken, civilised man, with a large, round, cheerful face and circular spectacles, who exuded warmth and charm. He knew he was speaking to an audience of sceptics, but did not attempt to hector or bombard us. He just said quietly, \x{2018}If it is inconvenient for you to find yourselves on the same side as the United States, it is an intellectual inconvenience. For us it is a matter of life or death.\x{2019}",

            "Mike O\x{2019}Brien spent ten minutes in the Tea Room trying to convince me to vote with the government. His arguments were the standard ones \x{2013} the wickedness of Saddam, the perfidy of the French and, more persuasively, that if we failed to act against Iraq all the little tyrannies would want their own dirty weapons. My difficulty is that for weeks I have been telling anyone who asked, on the basis of repeated assurances from the highest levels, that a second resolution was my bottom line. I cannot suddenly switch just because it is inconvenient. A cannier politician would have kept his head down and his mouth closed, but I am not made that way. Which is no doubt why my political career peaked at Under-Secretary of Folding Deck Chairs. I asked Mike if there was any message I should give The Man when I see him. He dropped his voice. \x{2018}Tell him not to make any more promises to George Bush. Somewhere along the line he\x{2019}s promised Bush that we would be there with him and now he can\x{2019}t back down because his integrity is at stake.\x{2019} Well, my integrity is at stake, too, and I\x{2019}m staying put.

As I made my way through the throng to vote for the amendment and against the government, who should I come face to face with but The Man, who was, of course, heading resolutely in the other direction. He affected not to notice, but I am sure he did. The Lib Dems and the Nationalists were there in force but, despite promises to the contrary, there were only a handful of Tories. No sign of Roger Gale, who only days ago assured me that there would be many more Tory rebels next time around. It is clear that the rebellion is not as large as the whips had been predicting (a lot of people have been talked out of it in the final hours), but it is still enormous \x{2013} 139 Labour Members have defied the whip.

Can any British embassy enjoy a grander setting? An Edwardian villa, wreathed in purple bougainvillea, in an 87-acre walled compound, a gift from the Emperor in 1896. A hundred servants, horses, giant tortoises, a miniature golf course, woodland, a vegetable garden. The entire embassy is housed within the estate, in villas scattered discreetly around the compound. And yet, so I am assured (and I have no reason to disbelieve), this place is extremely cost-effective, due to the cheapness of the labour and the absence of rents.",

We have lost 47 seats. In London the swing to the Tories was stronger than expected (the Evening Standard factor?). Some bright spots. Jack had an excellent result in Blackburn. Ann Cryer is safely back in Keighley, in the teeth of strong opposition from both medievalist Muslims and the BNP. Ann Campbell (Cambridge), Jon Owen Jones (Cardiff Central) and astonishingly Keith Bradley (Manchester Withington) have fallen to the students and we have had close shaves in other student strongholds like Durham and Newcastle. Elsewhere the odious Tim Collins fell to the Lib Dems and incredibly we held Dorset South, but in east London George Galloway triumphed over Oona King. At Blaenau Gwent a popular independent has triumphed over a woman imposed by Central Casting (yet another New Labour fix comes unstuck. Will they ever learn?). The Man looks exhausted and miserable.
