It was in the air about half the time I was fighting it. The first leap came about ten seconds after I clipped myself into the chair, a wild burst of white spray and bright green flesh about 300 yards behind the boat, and the second one almost jerked my arms off. These buggers are strong, Ralph, and they have an evil sense of timing that can break a man\'s spirit. Just about the time your arms go numb they will rest for two or three seconds -- and then, in that same split second when your muscles begin to relax, they will take off in some other direction like something shot out of a missile-launcher.',
