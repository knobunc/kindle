            "The house at number 7, Royalty Avenue, near to Clapham Common, had been put up for sale and contained no furniture, pictures or indeed anything at all. It was this improbable venue that Percy, in his declining years, had apparently decided to break and enter by night. It seemed that Royalty Avenue had the remarkable privilege, unlike most streets in London, of having a police constable patrolling it at night. It was <<about two o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> when PC Simpson saw Percy with his arm in an open window at the back of number 7.",

She wanted to meet me urgently at her home at <<twelve-thirty|5c>> the next day. It was an address in Willesden. I tried ringing her on the number the hospital had, but there was no reply. So I decided to call at the Willesden house.\x{2019}",

Then I remembered the days when this was the fruit and vegetable market where farmers set out their produce, where the pubs were open at <<five o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> and barrow boys shouted about their wares and the pavements were littered with discarded boxes and cabbage leaves. Regrettably, it had been tidied up, the market moved to a distant part of London.",

The most encouraging call I had during that doleful period was from Bonny Bernard, who offered to buy me a drink at Pommeroy\x{2019}s that evening at <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>>. The time-honoured tradition of the drinks at Pommeroy\x{2019}s was that they were marked down on my slate and my most loyal solicitor didn\x{2019}t even bother to look as though he was fumbling for the cash. That he was undertaking to foot the bill raised my hopes of there being a big money brief somewhere in the offing.",
