            "As the oldest boy at Long Tomorrows, Jun Do had responsibilities\x{2014}portioning the food, assigning bunks, renaming the new boys from the list of the 114 Grand Martyrs of the Revolution. Even so, the Orphan Master was serious about showing no favoritism to his son, the only boy at Long Tomorrows who wasn\x{2019}t an orphan. When the rabbit warren was dirty, it was Jun Do who spent the night locked in it. When boys wet their bunks, it was Jun Do who chipped the frozen piss off the floor. Jun Do didn\x{2019}t brag to the other boys that he was the son of the Orphan Master, rather than some kid dropped off by parents on their way to a <<9-27|5a:1>> camp. If someone wanted to figure it out, it was pretty obvious\x{2014}Jun Do had been there before all of them, and the reason he\x{2019}d never been adopted was because his father would never let someone take his only son. And it made sense that after his mother was stolen to Pyongyang, his father had applied for the one position that would allow him to both earn a living and watch over his son.",

We had the interns check the hot boxes, even though the red lights were off. We checked the sense-dep cells and the time-out tanks, where subjects got some first aid and a chance to catch their breath. We lifted the floor hatch and descended down the ladders into the sump. There were many lost souls down there, all of them too far gone to be Ga, but still, we checked the names on their ankle bracelets and lifted their heads long enough to shine a light in their slow-to-dilate eyes. Finally, with trepidation, we checked a room the old-timers called the shop. It was dark when we swung open the door\x{2014}there was only the occasional winking glint of a slowly turning power tool, suspended from the ceiling by its yellow pneumatic hose.
