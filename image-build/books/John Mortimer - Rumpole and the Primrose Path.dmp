            "The facts of the case were alarmingly simple. It happened <<around six o\x{2018}clock|6>> one weekday evening when the Tube station was crowded with released office workers. There had been numerous cases of dipped-into handbags, emptied hip pockets and pinched purses at that particular station, so the railway police were inconspicuously alert. Two of them were present in the lift when Mr Hornby, a company director who prided himself on his use of public transport, felt a fluttering disturbance in his breast pocket and found his wallet flown away. Being an old-fashioned sort of company director he called out \x{2018}Stop, thief!\x{2019} and the railway policeman in the lift detained the passengers. Trevor Timson was unhesitantly  denounced by a witness who said she saw him take the wallet, which was then found intact in his half-open shoulder bag. It contained three hundred pounds in crisp twenties.",

            "So, after everyone had had a share of the New Bullingham warm welcome, Archie Prosser, the latest arrival at our Chambers, rose and opened his case. The story of the Underground station was told again in detail. Mr Hornby, the company director, entered the witness box and identified his stolen wallet, which was wrapped in cellophane and labelled \x{2018}Prosecution Exhibit A\x{2019}, being handled carefully as it had been examined for fingerprints. With some reluctance and a great deal of delay, the prosecution had agreed to providing the fingerprint evidence which had given me, when I read it, a good deal of quiet satisfaction. We had started after lunch  and by <<four o\x{2018}clock|6>> the New Bullingham beamed at us and said, \x{2018}Would it suit the convenience of you two gentlemen if we stop now and we hear the chief prosecution witness in the morning?\x{2019} We beamed back and told him that would suit our convenience perfectly.",

Later she was able to get in touch with another department, which promised to send a social worker, who never arrived. Cameron was collected by another friend from the Candy Crocodile, who offered to take him for lunch at McDonald\x{2019}s and then to The Lord of the Rings at the Odeon Swiss Cottage.
