  \x{a7} Amber

  Amber has occupied a big piece of my writing time over the years\x{2014}ten books of it\x{2014}and I want to say things about it here that will not give away the plot to those who are about to visit there for the first time. So I have to talk about the books without talking about what happens in the books. Okay. A challenge\x{2026} One day I found myself walking in a part of Baltimore I had never visited before. Precisely where it was, or why I was there, I no longer recall. It was a sunny autumn day, though, a bit brisk, and I was passing down a narrow street lined with shops. I came to a corner and turned right. Immediately, I found myself on a totally different sort of street\x{2014}residential, tree-lined, rather quaint. I had not anticipated the sudden shift and was somewhat surprised by the contrast. I passed along the street, however, and turned left at the next corner. With almost perfect timing, the sun was covered by a cloud as I turned, showing me a dark, alleylike street with a 19th-century feeling to it. Another turn, and there were open lots, houses set farther back from the road; and the sun came out again. It felt as if I were in the country rather than the city. I forget where I went after that, what I did, or how I got back. But the succession of contrasting prospects was already producing an effect in that place in my mind where stories occur. What form it would take, I had no idea at the time. It did not occur to me till later, when I was writing them, that this was a piece with the shadow walk and the hellride, two of the Amberites\x{2019} means of passing through realities.",

This unnamed company did not want Zelazny to write the screenplay.[1] In 1998 and 1999, Warner Bros. announced Nine Princes in Amber to be written by Ed Neumeier (Robocop, Starship Troopers) and co-produced by Akiva Goldsman (Batman Forever) and Mark Canton.[8-9] However, neither project ever materialized.
