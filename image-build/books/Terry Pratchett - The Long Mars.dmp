Chapter 3, On the Origin of Species, <<1859|9l>>: \x{201c}As species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably, some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than between species of distinct genera.\x{201d}\x{2019} He put down the tablet. \x{2018}Darwin knew. He could have predicted this. It won\x{2019}t be war. It won\x{2019}t be civilized. It will be much more primitive than that. It will be biological.
