In a quiet corner of the Mended Drum tavern, where the adventuresses Herrena the henna-haired Harridan, Red Scharron and Diome, Witch of the Night, were meeting for some girl talk and a game of canasta, all the drinks turned into small yellow elephants.
\x{2018}It\x{2019}s them wizards up at the University,\x{2019} said the barman, hastily replacing the glasses. \x{2018}It oughtn\x{2019}t to be allowed.\x{2019}

The Council of Wizardry rubbed their eyes and stared blearily at one another. They felt it oughtn\x{2019}t to be allowed too, since they weren\x{2019}t the ones that were allowing it.
Finally the new Archchancellor, Ezrolith Churn, suppressed a yawn, sat up straight in his chair, and tried to look suitably magisterial. He knew he wasn\x{2019}t really Archchancellor material. He hadn\x{2019}t really wanted the job. He was ninety-eight, and had achieved this worthwhile age by carefully not being any trouble or threat to anyone. He had hoped to spend his twilight years completing his seven-volume treatise on Some Little Known Aspects of Kuian Rain-making Rituals, which were an ideal subject for academic study in his opinion since the rituals only ever worked in Ku, and that",

It took place in the <<midnight|13>> in the University\x{2019}s Great Hall, in a welter of incense, candlesticks, runic inscriptions and magic circles, none of which was strictly necessary but which made the wizards feel better. Magic flared, the chants were chanted, the invocations were truly invoked.
The wizards stared into the magic octogram, which remained empty. After a while the circle of robed figures began to mutter amongst themselves.
\x{2018}We must have done something wrong.\x{2019}
\x{2018}Ooook.\x{2019}
\x{2018}Maybe He is out.\x{2019}
\x{2018}Or busy . . .\x{2019}
\x{2018}Do you think we could give up and go back to bed?\x{2019}
Who are we waiting for, exactly?
The Bursar turned slowly to the figure beside him. You could always tell a wizard\x{2019}s robe; it was bedecked with sequins, sigils, fur and lace, and there was usually a considerable amount of wizard inside it. This robe, however, was very black. The material looked as though it had been chosen for its hard-wearing qualities. So did its owner. He looked as though if he wrote a diet book, it would be a bestseller.
Death was watching the octogram with an expression of polite interest.
\x{2018}Er,\x{2019} said the Bursar. \x{2018}The fact is, in fact, that, er, you should be on the inside.\x{2019}
I\x{2019}m so sorry.
Death stalked in a dignified way into the centre of the room and watched the Bursar expectantly.",

The stonemason stood back, handed the latest blunted obsidian chisel to his assistant, and gave Rincewind an expectant look.
Rincewind stood back and examined the rock critically.
\x{2018}It\x{2019}s very good,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}I mean, it\x{2019}s a very good likeness. You\x{2019}ve got his hairstyle and everything. Of course, he\x{2019}s not as, er, square as that normally but, yes, very good. And here\x{2019}s the chariot and there\x{2019}s the step-pyramids. Yes. Well, it looks as though they want you to go to the city with them,\x{2019} he said to Eric.
\x{2018}Tell them yes,\x{2019} said Eric firmly.
Rincewind turned to the headman.
\x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} he said.

Rincewind sighed. Without saying a word the stonemason put a fresh chisel into his unresisting fingers and manhandled a new slab of granite into position.
One of the problems of being a Tezuman, apart from having a god like Quezovercoatl, is that if you unexpectedly need to order an extra pint of milk tomorrow you probably should have started writing the note for the milkman last month. Tezumen are the only people who beat themselves",

\x{2018}I was born in a cage, you raving wossname!\x{2019} screamed the parrot. Rincewind faced it, nose to beak.
\x{2018}It\x{2019}s that or fricassee time,\x{2019} he said. The parrot opened its beak to bite his nose, saw his expression, and thought better of it.

The priests sat around thoughtfully. Occasionally one of them stood up and made a short speech.
It was clear that points were being made. For example, how the economics of the kingdom depended on a buoyant obsidian knife industry, how the enslaved neighbouring kingdoms had come to rely on the smack of firm government, and incidentally on the hack, slash and disembowelling of firm government as",
