I just want to find another Lord and his woman, who came to this world to escape from the Black Bellers. In fact, I\'ll tell you who that Lord is. It\'s Jadawin. Maybe your boss will remember him. It\'s Jadawin, who\'s changed very much. Jadawin isn\'t interested in challenging your boss; he could care less. All he wants to do is get back to his own world. You tell him that, though I doubt it\'ll do any good. I\'ll call your home tomorrow <<about noon|13>>, so you can relay more of what I have to say to your boss. I\'ll call your home. Your boss might want to be there so he can talk to me directly."',

He called the Los Angeles Times ad department and dictated an item for the personal column. He gave as his address the motel and also gave a fictitious name. He had thought about using Ramos\' name in case the Times man checked out the address. But he did not want any tie between the ad and Cambring, if he could help it.
