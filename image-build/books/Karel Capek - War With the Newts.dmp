            "Some time later the Belgian ferryboat Oudenbourgh was sailing from Ostend to Ramsgate. Halfway across the Straits of Dover the duty officer noticed \x{2018}something happening in the water\x{2019} half a mile south of her usual course. Because he was unable to make out if somebody was not perhaps drowning he gave orders for the ship to make for the spot where the water was so fiercely churned up. <<Nearly 200|9:0>> passengers watched the strange spectacle from the windward side: in some places the water was splashing up in vertical columns, in others something like a black body was flung up with it; over an area about 300 metres across the sea\x{2019}s surface was intensely agitated and seething, and a loud rumble and roar was heard to come from the depth. It was just as if a small volcano was erupting under water. As the Oudenbourgh slowly drew near the spot a gigantic precipitous wave suddenly rose up some ten metres from her bows and there was a frightful explosion. The whole ship rose sharply and a shower of near-boiling water descended on her deck; simultaneously a powerful black body smacked down on her foredeck, writhing and screaming in agony: it was a mutilated and scalded Newt. The captain ordered full steam astern to prevent the ship sailing straight into the middle of that exploding inferno but by now explosions were occurring all over the place and the surface was strewn with pieces of dismembered Newts. Eventually the ship was turned about, and the Oudenbourgh made off north at full steam. Just then there was a terrifying explosion and a huge column of water and steam, perhaps 100 metres high, shot up some 600 metres astern. The Oudenbourgh headed straight for Harwich, radioing warnings in all directions: \x{2018}Warning, warning, warning! Great danger of submarine explosions on Ostend-Ramsgate route. Cause unknown. All craft advised to avoid the area!\x{2019} Meanwhile the rumble and roar continued, almost as if naval exercises were taking place; but because of the spouts of water and steam there was nothing to be seen. By then torpedo-boats and destroyers had set out from Dover and Calais at full steam and squadrons of military aircraft were making for the spot. However, all they found on arrival was the surface muddied with yellow slime and covered with dead fish and mangled Newts.",

As far as has been possible to establish so far, the fissure runs from Vermilion Bay in an east-north-easterly direction, near Franklin it turns north, running into Grand Lake, extending thence further north to a line Plaquemine-Lafayette, where it ends in a small ancient lake; a second arm of the fissure connects Grand Lake to the west with Lake Napoleonville. Total length of subsidence about eighty kilometres, width two to eleven kilometres. Epicentre of earthquake was evidently here. By amazing good fortune fissure avoided all major settlements. Even so, loss of life considerable. In Franklin sixty centimetres of mud rained down, in Patterson forty-five centimetres. People from Atchafalaya Bay state that during tremor sea receded by about three kilometres, thereupon came hurtling back towards shore with wave thirty metres high.

At <<half past eight|10>> they published an interview on the causes of the Louisiana earthquake with Dr Wilbur R. Brownell, a leading seismologist from Memphis University. It was too soon for any definitive conclusions, the scientist stated, but it would seem that the tremors were unconnected with the volcanic activity still occurring in the Central American volcanic belt situated opposite the affected area. Today\x{2019}s earthquake seemed instead to be of tectonic origin, i.e. it had been caused by the pressure of mountain masses - the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Madre on the one side and the Appalachian range on the other - on the extensive depression of the Gulf of Mexico of which the wide plain of the Mississippi delta was a continuation. The fissure now running out of Vermilion Bay was but a new and relatively insignificant rift, a minor episode in the geological downward movement that had created the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea with the arc of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, that remnant of an ancient continuous mountain range. There was no doubt that the Central American subsidence would continue, bringing new tremors, faults and fissures. It could not be ruled out that the Vermilion fissure was a mere prelude to a revival of tectonic activity centred on the Gulf of Mexico. In that event we might witness enormous geological catastrophes with almost one-fifth of the United States sinking below the sea. On the other hand, if that were to happen, we could expect, with a high degree of probability, that the sea-floor in the neighbourhood of the Antilles would begin to rise instead, or even further to the east where ancient legend spoke of a drowned Atlantis.",
