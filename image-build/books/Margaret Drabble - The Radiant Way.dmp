            "New Year\x{2019}s Eve, and the end of a decade. A portentous moment, for those who pay attention to portents. Guests were invited for nine. Some are already on their way,
  travelling towards Harley Street from outlying districts, from Oxford and Tonbridge and Wantage, worried already about the drive home. Others are dining, on the cautious assumption that a <<nine
  o\x{2019}clock|6>> party might not provide adequate food. Some are uncertainly eating a sandwich or a slice of toast. In front of mirrors women try on dresses, men select ties. As it is a night of many
  parties, the more social, the more gregarious, the more invited of the guests are wondering whether to go to Harley Street first, or whether to arrive there later, after sampling other offerings. A
  few are wondering whether to go at all, whether the festive season has not after all been too tiring, whether a night in slippers in front of the television with a bowl of soup might not be a wiser
  choice than the doubtful prospect of a crowded room. Most of them will go: the communal celebration draws them, they need to gather together to bid farewell to the 1970s, they need to reinforce
  their own expectations by witnessing those of others, by observing who is in, who is out, who is up, who is down. They need one another. Liz and Charles Headleand have invited them, and obediently,
  expectantly, they will go, dragging along their tired flat feet, their aching heads, their over-fed bellies and complaining livers, their exhausted opinions, their weary small talk, their
  professional and personal deformities, their doubts and enmities, their blurring vision and thickening ankles, in the hope of a miracle, in the hope of a <<midnight|13>> transformation, in the hope of a
  new self, a new life, a new, redeemed decade.",

  promised, even, to go early, but cannot persuade her husband Brian to go early with her. A couple of hours of any party is enough for me, Brian has said, and we\x{2019}ll have to stay until
  <<midnight|13>>, so I\x{2019}m certainly not turning up before <<ten|9c:1>>. All right, I\x{2019}ll go alone, said Alix. She thought Brian was quite reasonable not to want to go early. She herself is not a
  reasonable person, she suspects, a suspicion confirmed that evening in the bathroom as she tries, out of respect to Liz\x{2019}s party, to apply a little of a substance called Fluid Foundation to
  the winter-dry skin of her face. This is what people do before parties: she has seen them doing it on television: indeed, she used to do it herself when she was young, when she had no need of such
  substances, before she reverted so inexorably to her ancestral type.",

  An ugly sister? Alix has always felt rather sorry for the poor competitive disappointed Ugly Sisters. Indeed, she feels sorry for almost everybody. It is one of her weaknesses. But she does not

  patients at <<eight in the morning|5>> and Charles\x{2019}s working hours are wildly irregular. But at weekends, they attempt to rendezvous over the Oxford marmalade, and on this occasion had succeeded.

  clock from the bedroom reflected in the dressing-room mirror, at an interesting, an unlikely angle. Her eyes focused upon her own image. She looked all right, she concluded, without much interest.

  minimal, but, like Alix Bowen, she decided that it was after all a festive occasion, and she began at this late moment to apply a little mascara. Her mascara container, like Alix\x{2019}s Fluid
  Foundation, was rarely called upon, and appeared to have dried up. She licked the curved brush, and tried again. A big black dry grainy nodule stuck itself unobligingly to her lashes. Impatiently

  Seven minutes of solitude she had, and then she would descend. As she sat there, she experienced a sense of what seemed to be preternatural power. She had summoned these people up, these ghosts
  would materialize, even now they were converging upon her in their finery at her bidding, each of them willing to surrender a separate self for an evening, to eat, to drink, to talk, to exchange
  embraces, to wait for the witching hour. Soon their possible presences would become real presences, and here, under this roof, at her command, patterns would form and dissolve and form again,
  dramas would be enacted, hard and soft words exchanged, friendships formed, acquaintances renewed. The dance would be to her tune. A pity, in a way, that the dancing would be merely metaphorical:
  this was a house large enough to accommodate dancing, but their friends were not of the dancing classes, would gaze in astonishment, alarm, sophisticated horror, intellectual condemnation, at
  dancing in a private house . . . another year, perhaps, for the dancing. This year, the dying year, the social dance would suffice.',

  all save one, and he had been from another country, and she had not known his name. There were not so many of them: <<five|9k:0>>, to be precise, and one of those was Charles, and another her first husband
  Edgar Lintot, to whom she had remained married for less than a year. Of the other three, one had been revenge, one an escapade, and one half serious, but all had now merged into a sentimental
  distance, an affectionate presence. She had set much store by retaining or restoring her relations with these men, and thought she knew why. After the sickening shock of the rapid deterioration of
  her first childish marriage, she had been so afraid of ever again being engulfed by hatred and violence that she had maintained a resolute pleasantness even through the worst of times, even with
  Charles, who was not an easy man. She had called it maturity, this pleasantness. She was determined never again to be a party to the hideous transformation which overcomes the partners of a bad
  marriage, who grow fangs and horns and sprout black monstrous wolfish hair, who claw and cling and bite and suck. There would be no more of that: she would see the person as he was, and see him
  steadily, setting aside her own long shadow as it fell. Her success in this enterprise had fortified her in her career as psychotherapist, had given her confidence in her right to pursue it, in the
  rightness of her pursuing it. Even her first husband she had regained from that dreadful hinterland of marsh and bog and storm cloud: and now they were good friends, she and Edgar, in the sunlight,

  guests that broccoli was out of fashion, and was busily engaged in conversation with a television journalist who had just returned from making a programme for Charles in Iran. He was telling her
  about the Ayatollah, and she was telling him about her convent days. Their words fluttered between them like lubricious little doves. At Deirdre\x{2019}s elbow stood the faithless Jonathan
  Headleand, who was trying to explain to his stepmother\x{2019}s first husband Edgar why he\x{2019}d decided, after all his protests, to follow in his father\x{2019}s footsteps, while simultaneously
  trying to keep one eye on Deirdre (for whom he felt responsible) and the other on his girlfriend Kate Williams who was being harangued by a Tory backbencher about Marxist infiltration of the Open
  University. The Open University was also the subject of debate between Alix Bowen and Teddy Lazenby of the Department of Education and Science: Alix\x{2019}s face was expressing a most delicate
  mixture of disbelief, disapprobation and polite attention as Teddy, somewhat indiscreetly presuming on their long, if long-interrupted, acquaintance, revealed what were clearly his own opinions on
  the inadvisability of wasting money on the education of housewives and taxi drivers. In other corners and other rooms, dozens of other topics floated gaily on the lively, slightly choppy waters,
  their pennants bobbing and fluttering in the end-of-year, the terminal breeze: the approaching steel strike, the brave new era of threatened privatization, the abuse of North Sea oil resources, the
  situation in Afghanistan, the Annan report, the prospect of a fourth television channel, the viability of Charles\x{2019}s attempt to conquer the United States, the Cambridge Apostles, the disarray
  of the Labour Party, the deplorable vogue for Buck\x{2019}s Fizz as a party drink, the Yorkshire Ripper, the Harrow Road murderer, the Prince of Wales. In a doorway, wedged between a
  Guardian leader writer and a Kleinian analyst, Alan Headleand and his ex-tutor Otto Werner from the LSE were debating with a fine abstraction and a noble disregard of interruption the
  question as to whether or not a television programme was a primary product or a service, and whether, by implication or extension, Charles\x{2019}s production company, Global Information Network
  (Telex GIN) was allied in ideological terms with the manufacturing or the service industries: with equal commitment Esther Breuer and Jules Griffin (colleague of Liz Headleand) were discussing the

            "The temperature is high in Garfield on Tuesday, 1 January 1980. Here it is party time, here also there is glitter. Alix could feel the heat at once, embodied in more than the pink and green
  balloons, the paper chains, the tinsel. Garfield, of all the institutions in which she had ever worked, was most responsive to mood, to atmosphere; it shifted and changed from day to day, from week
  to week, for it had, like the larger society of her larger imagining, its own corporate, its own embodied spirit, all the more powerful for its caging, its high barbed wire, its high walls. On some
  evenings, the place was dull, impassive, stifled, solid with boredom: on some evenings it grumbled ominously, with violence, waiting for Lights Out; on some evenings it was studious, attentive,
  solemn; and on other evenings, like this, it sang with a high, sweet, feverish erotic intensity, a claustrophobic glamour, an emotional throb. This was a sweet evening. Alix found herself embraced,
  caressed, her hand held, her hair stroked, her new striped woolly hat with its purple bobble extravagantly admired. These liberties were permitted. This was a liberal r\x{e9}gime, the only
  r\x{e9}gime of its kind in the country. Sometimes Alix shook off the liberties irritably, but tonight she submitted, responding to the petting, intimate, female warmth; she kissed and was kissed,
  she thanked them for their Christmas cards, she wished them a Happy New Year, she shook hands with the older women, she laughed and felt safe with her friends, she made no effort to repel their
  eager affection. (It did not always go this way: sometimes they sulked and abused her, sometimes they threatened her and one another, sometimes they would not attend class.) The wardens, Eric and
  Hannah Glover, welcomed her with more restraint but equal friendliness and introduced her to a man from the Home Office who had come to visit \x{2013} well, to inspect, in effect, but the mood was
  holiday, informal, and the man from the Home Office smiled with the rest of them. There were sandwiches and cups of coffee. The half-hour\x{2019}s entertainment was due to begin at <<eight thirty|5d>>:
  some relatives, waiting now patiently in the hall, had been admitted, but were not allowed backstage to mingle. Freedom, but not too much freedom. Some of those taking part were already in costume:
  Jilly Fox was wearing what looked like an Iranian chadour, contrived from a sheet, Karen Gray was dressed up as a nurse, and Bob Saxby who taught pottery was encased in a Michelin-man spacesuit
  which he claimed was an Arctic explorer\x{2019}s sleeping bag. \x{2018}Imagine, man, trying to kip in this,\x{2019} he kept asking, to anyone who would listen, as he demonstrated the inconvenience of
  his garb. Innocent, innocent, like schoolchildren, the thieves and murderers. Toni Hutchinson stroked Alix\x{2019}s arm, possessively, affectionately, wheedling out of her the story of the party of
  the night before: \x{2018}So you wore your blue dress? And did you put your hair up? Did it stay up?\x{2019} She liked to tease Alix about her hair, which was forever wispily
  descending from its large wooden slide: Toni\x{2019}s own curled neatly in angelic dyed blonde braids, and sometimes on request she had given Alix lessons in hair management, but Alix could not,

            "Esther, Liz and Alix, who in Jane Austen\x{2019}s day would never have met at all, met in Cambridge in 1952. Just before Christmas, when they were up for interview from their
  respective schools. Alix was applying to read English Literature, Liz to read Natural Sciences (with a view to medicine) and Esther to read Modern Languages. This should have safely prevented any
  rapport between them, but did not. There were, it is true, many awkwardnesses in their first communications, for none of them was much used to speaking to strangers, but this lack of practice was
  balanced by a strong desire on the part of all three of them to enter upon a new life in which speaking to strangers was possible. Otherwise, each had separately recognized, the future was
  circumscribed. Somehow, haltingly, over dinner in Hall (chicken, leeks and tinned spaghetti, a mixture delicious to each after years of post-war whale meat and school meals) they lurched into
  conversation, having found themselves for no good reason sitting together: Liz and Alix discovered that both came from Yorkshire, and that neither played lacrosse, nor had ever seen it being
  played, and Esther joined the discussion by volunteering that she had herself managed to avoid playing netball for the past three years on the grounds that she was too small. \x{2018}I said I was
  unfairly handicapped, and they let me do extra Latin instead,\x{2019} she said. The fact that both Liz and Alix seemed to accept that extra Latin might be preferable to netball indicated that
  further interchange might be possible, and they continued to talk, through the fruit tart and custard, of the nature of intellectual and physical education, of matter and spirit, of Descartes
  (brought up by Esther), of T. S. Eliot (brought up by Alix) and of schizophrenia (brought up by Liz). The matter was abstract, for none of them knew anything other than abstractions, and the tone
  lofty. It was what they had expected of University, but had not hoped so soon to find. Esther, at the end of the meal, expressed her satisfaction with her new companions by inviting them to go with
  her to visit a friend already attending the college, an Old Girl of her school. They accepted with alacrity the prospect of a glimpse of the world inside, and all three of them went along dark
  portrait-hung corridors and up panelled staircases to the room of one Flora Piercy, a second year History student of considerable sophistication, who offered them a glass of wine. Had they known
  how rare such a commodity was in a woman\x{2019}s college at that date, they might have been even more astonished, but in a sense, looking round Flora\x{2019}s room, with its bright scatter cushions
  and Picasso prints and posters for plays at the ADC, with its invitations on the mantelpiece, with its gas fire and clutter of old shoes, with its romantic piles of what looked like lecture notes
  and essays, with its candle in a pewter stick and its wilting rose in a vase, they were beyond astonishment. The glass of wine went quickly to each head, for Alix\x{2019}s family was teetotal, and
  Liz\x{2019}s alcohol consumption to that date comprised perhaps three glasses of brown sherry and one (celebrating her A levels with her teacher) of Liebfraumilch: Esther seemed better connected
  with drink as with friends, but even she became confiding under the mild influence. They shared their dreams and aspirations, encouraged by the benevolent, admonitory, tutelary spirit of ample
  broad-faced Flora. \x{2018}I would like,\x{2019} said Liz Ablewhite, <<after midnight|13>>, staring into the white flaming chalky cracked pitted flaring columns of the gas fire, \x{2018}to make sense of
  things. To understand.\x{2019} By things, she meant herself. Or she thought she meant herself. \x{2018}I would like,\x{2019} said Alix, \x{2018}to change things.\x{2019} By things, she did not mean
  herself. Or thought she did not mean herself. \x{2018}You reach too high,\x{2019} said Esther. \x{2018}I wish to acquire interesting information. That is all.\x{2019}",

  is not only the comfort that she needs, though that is a part of it. She is afraid that if she takes a step back, all her worldly riches will crumble, like Cinderella\x{2019}s at <<midnight|13>>, and that
  she will find herself once more polishing the boots. Well, of course she is afraid of this, we are all afraid of this, if we have any imagination. But she is more afraid of this than most. She

  was his job. Liz had no wish whatsoever to see Ivan, or to eat lunch. Nevertheless, here she found herself, at <<one o\x{2019}clock|6>> on a weekday in Soho in late spring, settling herself on to a
  comfortable upholstered banquette, shaking out a large thick well-ironed dark-pink damask napkin, smiling politely, professing herself delighted to see Ivan, and allowing herself to order a Campari
  and soda. It arrived, clinking, misted, in a long-stemmed tulip glass, with a slice of orange. How had it happened? How had he managed it? She gazed at his unattractive, malevolent, highly
  coloured, smug face with curiosity. It was almost as though Ivan had some power of blackmail over her, over all those he held in thrall: but what could the secret be, when she could think of
  nothing dishonourable that he could know of her, when she knew so many dishonourable things of him? And why was it that she felt, in his company, a sense of illicit, uncomfortable pleasure, a sense
  of slightly corrupt collusion? Was the very fact of her presence, here, in this restaurant, a shared crime, did he know her distaste, her reluctance, was it because of her distaste, her reluctance,
  that he continued to press her, continued to seek her out? Or could it be that she actually wanted to be cross-questioned by Ivan Warner about her divorce proceedings, about how Charles
  was getting on in New York, about Henrietta Latchett, about the children\x{2019}s response to Charles\x{2019}s move? She had observed in some of her patients a guilty pleasure in surrender of

  black, what was the significance, psychologically, of the severed-head motif, was the attacker mad, and what did Liz mean by mad? Liz responded at first vaguely by saying that perhaps after all
  Esther Breuer ought to give up walking along the Harrow Road by herself late at night, but then attached herself more generously to the subject of madness and psychopathology in general and to the
  history of the McNaghten Rules in particular. Liz and her ex-husband Edgar Lintot share the view, as Liz now explained to Ivan, that not much is gained by the use of the word \x{2018}mad\x{2019} to
  describe deviations from the norm as wide as that of Virginia Woolf, her unfortunate cousin J. K. Stephen (also, oddly, a candidate for the role of Jack the Ripper), and the supposed Horror of
  Harrow Road, but that does not mean that the rejection of the term implies that the Jack the Rippers of this world are not suffering from diminished responsibility by reason of insanity: insane
  they are, responsible they are not, and let us forget the emotive word \x{2018}madness\x{2019} in this context. But, argued Ivan, did that mean that she and Edgar thought all murderers were
  insane and of diminished responsibility? Liz prevaricated slightly, for in fact she and Edgar are, in a sense, of this opinion, but in a sense that would need careful presentation to a layman, and
  she did not wish to see herself quoted in the press on the topic: but Ivan, to do him justice where one could, was not a man for hanging and flogging, for interminable prison sentences and short
  sharp shocks, and the severed-head business had suggested to him as strongly as it had to Liz and Edgar that the Horror of Harrow Road was probably not quite in his right mind. \x{2018}Not that that
  makes it any nicer for the corpse,\x{2019} said Ivan, as Liz glanced again, this time ostentatiously, at her watch. \x{2018}Ivan, I must go,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve got a consultation at
  <<three thirty|5b>>, and I can\x{2019}t be late.\x{2019} He rose to his feet, escorted her to the door, saw her on to the shabby, sunlit, sex-postered street: \x{2018}It\x{2019}s been a delight to see you,
  Liz,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}as ever\x{2019} \x{2013} taking her hand, squeezing it, reaching up slightly to kiss her cheek \x{2013} \x{2018}it\x{2019}s a pity we didn\x{2019}t have more time, I wanted to
  ask you where you\x{2019}re going to live when you\x{2019}ve got rid of that great gloomy house of yours. Such a dark, depressing, lumpen-bourgeois street, I\x{2019}ve always thought, haven\x{2019}t

  some internal problem: it grew more feeble at every incline, its power was dying in it. Alix, on her way home to Wandsworth from Sussex, feared she would not make it. She had no idea what was wrong
  with the car: it had been sickening for some days, but she had been unable to consult Brian, for he was in Northam with his dying father, and she had not liked to trouble him. She had been visiting
  her ex-mother-in-law, Deborah Manning, who was also dying. And the car, with the year, was dying too. The windscreen wipers battled frantically, manically, against the driving sheets of wet: solid

  Hattersley, when consulted, had complicated the issue by talking about the winter solstice. Esther, who knew about iconography and saints, had failed to answer her telephone, and Alix had been
  unable to find her battered old edition of Donne, which might also have supplied the answer. If St Lucy\x{2019}s Day really was the 13th, as Harvey claimed, was Donne under the impression that the

  seemed by eight to want to eat again. Nothing much, just a snack, they all cried, and Liz was standing in the kitchen making smoked-salmon sandwiches when the telephone rang. It was her sister
  Shirley. \x{2018}But I spoke to her this morning,\x{2019} Liz began, defensively, in response to Shirley\x{2019}s opening phrase, \x{2018}It\x{2019}s mother\x{2019}: and then, in the ensuing silence,
  quickly replayed, re-read that phrase, that intonation, and for one wild glorious moment hoped that her mother was dead. \x{2018}What is it?\x{2019} she asked, as Shirley said nothing.
  \x{2018}Shirley?\x{2019} And Shirley explained that their mother had had a stroke. She gave details. Quite a severe stroke, but not, said Shirley grimly, severe enough. She had been admitted to
  hospital.",

  she, Liz Headleand, was still alive. Her forehead had turned cold and damp. Clammy. She was beginning to feel hungry. The organism, the machine, was beginning, despite all, to restore itself. She
  rang room service and ordered an omelette and chips and half a bottle of Beaujolais. Propped up, alone, in her white five-year-old nightdress, she studied the unsatisfactory nature of knowledge.
  The anti-climactic nature of knowledge. So this was it. A night of bad dreams, a day of sweat, then a desire for omelette and chips. Already she was losing interest in the riddle that had teased
  her for decades. Tomorrow she would go and stuff that old rubbish in the Ideal Boiler and put a match to it. Why bother Shirley with these shabby little speculations? Let them go up in smoke:
  guesses, suspicions, half-truths, the Royal Family, Stocklinch Hall, Miss Featherstone\x{2019}s credentials, Dr Alethea Ward, and those pitiable paedophiles. She would remember no more. She would no
  longer gaze at the past, she would no more question her own wicked heart. On she would go, relentlessly, into the dark-red sun, down the radiant way, towards the only possible ending.",
