After all, Human Beings do not expect to see at <<six o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> a sheet of hardboard with small furry legs. The motorist drew into the side of the road and mopped his forehead and then his eyes grew even rounder because, in spite of the early morning mist, he was quite certain that he could see a swan walking up and down like a sentry with rows and rows of fish watching its progress, their heads turning from right to left as they did so.",
