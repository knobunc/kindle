The deep, rolling, blue water all around them, a Jew gunboat, and this mad old English woman with the skin peeling off her nose. You can see the coffin with the lid off and Elie\x{2019}s face and crossed hands in the <<midday|13>> sun. The Jews took their hats off while Madame swore at them. They all bobbed up and down. There was a dolphin. They even asked her how she knew her course. She had the salt dried on her face and hands, so much white powder. Her father was a sailor. By night she kept the North Star well on her port. By day she\x{2019}d recognise any landfall. She\x{2019}d know Carmel. Beyond that Naqura. The truth is, the set of the wind this time of year you wouldn\x{2019}t go far wrong if you just sailed with it. There\x{2019}s a dolphin I know, goes that way too in the middle of June.

After all the days were cooler. It was October and he could sit on the balcony wearing nothing but a pair of drawers in the <<noon|13>> sun.

It was absurd. The occasional table with cherubs had cost Elie fifty guineas in Wigmore Street and the grand total, the chairs, that big picture of a cock and hens, would be nearer a thousand.

She was going to wherever she had disappeared to that morning at the Greek Club when he had searched in those showers and walked about the garden and ended up drinking with that mat-chested trio. They swore she didn\x{2019}t exist. Maybe she didn\x{2019}t, just at that moment. She had expunged herself. She was doing it again and this time she was expunging him as well.

Military policemen walked about shouting. From the air it must have looked like a fairground: unshaded lights burned, a bell clanged, and a mad, sighing snarl came from a loaded camel being led between the tracks. Townrow was watching his chance to make a bolt for it. The first thing he did on being pushed into an empty first class compartment was to hop to the opposite door and try the handle. It was locked. He wondered whether Amin, who had a great pistol on his thigh, would have tried a pot shot. Probably, and missed. There were the four of them, two soldiers, Amin and himself, all sitting with the blinds drawn, smoking, a small blue light burning overhead.',

The clearest strip was the moving picture of his father stepping out of the car, climbing the wall, and setting off across the field to the trees. And that girl, she was seventeen, saying, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve got news for you, boy,\x{201d} and laughing as though pregnancy was a joke, the foetus actually tickled.

They seemed to release their rockets dead overhead to go screaming away south. Somebody might take it into his head to blow up the ferry in which case the Greek Sailing Club would probably stop a few rockets. Townrow turned this possibility over but he continued down the path. He came to a pergola with loofahs hanging down, some of them dead ripe and ready for the bath. Now, that pergola really was something he had forgotten. On the other side of the banana leaves there was a clicking noise. He paused. Perhaps some sort of weapon was being set up. Or it might have been rifle fire from a long way off.

Anti-aircraft fire came from the Eastern Mole, from Port Said itself, from Navy House and other emplacements on the other side of Port Fouad, no doubt near the salt beds. It was entirely ineffective. The Paras came out of the low-flying planes so quickly they seemed linked by a thread. It looked like the plane losing its entrails. Then the chutes opened and the men could be seen rocking over the red roof tops apparently using their automatics while they were still in the air, spraying the ground. One man, whose parachute failed to open, fell smack into the water about half a mile from where Townrow was resting. When Townrow arrived at the spot there was no sign of him.',
