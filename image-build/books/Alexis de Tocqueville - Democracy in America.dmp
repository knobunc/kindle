            "Tocqueville\x{2019}s parents did not flee France during the revolutionary or Napoleonic years, as had many of their fellow aristocrats, and became quite wealthy through inheriting property left them by relations who had either emigrated or been executed. When the Bourbon monarchy was restored in 1814, Tocqueville\x{2019}s father was rewarded by Louis XVIII with important appointments in the royal civil service. He served as pr\x{e9}fet, or chief royal administrator, in the capitals of various d\x{e9}partements such as Dijon and Metz. Royal favor continued <<after 1824|18:0>> when Charles X, the youngest brother of Louis XVI, succeeded his two older brothers to the throne, since Tocqueville\x{2019}s father staunchly supported Charles, a self-proclaimed reactionary who had himself crowned at Reims with all the pomp and pageantry of France\x{2019}s medieval monarchs.",

            'Put down in 1830, republicanism had never really died and by the middle 1840s French radicals were demanding universal suffrage and a republic. Liberals like Tocqueville wanted to expand the suffrage but retain the constitutional monarchy. By <<1848|9n:0>> republican agitation was augmented by socialists, like Louis Blanc, who wanted the creation of state-supported, collectivist manufacturing workshops. Fearful of the threat such working-class demands posed to liberal institutions in their call for an intrusive and supervisory state, Tocqueville bitterly attacked socialism in a January 1848 speech to the Chamber of Deputies. State provision of industrial jobs would lead, he predicted, to centralized, monolithic state control, and the ultimate erosion of private property, so fundamental and valuable an expression of individual independence.',

            "Tocqueville applauded the quashing of the socialist threat and even supported Cavaignac in the hastily called direct election of a new president held under universal suffrage in December 1848. But Louis Napoleon, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, who had become the head of the family when Napoleon\x{2019}s only son died in 1832, trounced Cavaignac by 5.4 to 1.5 million votes. A new legislative assembly was elected in May 1849, also under universal suffrage, and Tocqueville was elected once again from his Normandy seat, winning 110,000 of the 120,000 votes cast. Louis Napoleon, who admired Tocqueville, appointed him foreign minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Odilon Barrot, in which post Tocqueville remained for five months until Barrot\x{2019}s ministry was dismissed. By <<1852|9n:0>>, Louis Napoleon had replaced the republic with a revived empire and declared himself emperor. Under the title Napoleon III, he set about crafting the first modern dictatorship, rooted in popular support\x{2014}just as Tocqueville had foreseen in Democracy in America.",

            "1. In democratic societies, it is only the central power which has any stability in its position and any permanence in its undertakings. All the citizens are in a state of ceaseless movement and change. Thus, it is in the nature of every government to seek constantly to enlarge its sphere of influence. It is, therefore, impossible for this not to be successful in the long run, since it acts with a fixed design in mind and a constant will imposed upon men whose position, ideas, and desires change from day to day.

\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}It often happens that citizens work for the central power without meaning to.

\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Democratic periods are times of experiment, innovation, and adventure. There is always a host of men who are engaged upon some difficult or new enterprise that they pursue by themselves without disturbing their peers. These people are the first to admit that, as a general principle, the public authority should not interfere in private affairs; but, as an exception to that, each one of them wants its assistance with the particular affair which concerns him and seeks to attract the government to act on his behalf, all the time seeking to restrict it in every other sphere.

\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}With a whole host of people taking this particular view on a range of different issues at <<one|9c:0>> and the same time, the sphere of the central power extends imperceptibly in all directions although everyone wants to restrain it. A democratic government, therefore, increases its powers simply because of its permanence. Time is on its side; it profits from every chance event; individual passions unconsciously help it along and it could be said that the older a democratic society is the more centralized its government becomes.",
