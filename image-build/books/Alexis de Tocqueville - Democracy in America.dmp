            "Tocqueville\x{2019}s parents did not flee France during the revolutionary or Napoleonic years, as had many of their fellow aristocrats, and became quite wealthy through inheriting property left them by relations who had either emigrated or been executed. When the Bourbon monarchy was restored in 1814, Tocqueville\x{2019}s father was rewarded by Louis XVIII with important appointments in the royal civil service. He served as pr\x{e9}fet, or chief royal administrator, in the capitals of various d\x{e9}partements such as Dijon and Metz. Royal favor continued <<after 1824|3b>> when Charles X, the youngest brother of Louis XVI, succeeded his two older brothers to the throne, since Tocqueville\x{2019}s father staunchly supported Charles, a self-proclaimed reactionary who had himself crowned at Reims with all the pomp and pageantry of France\x{2019}s medieval monarchs.",

            'Put down in 1830, republicanism had never really died and by the middle 1840s French radicals were demanding universal suffrage and a republic. Liberals like Tocqueville wanted to expand the suffrage but retain the constitutional monarchy. By <<1848|9n:0>> republican agitation was augmented by socialists, like Louis Blanc, who wanted the creation of state-supported, collectivist manufacturing workshops. Fearful of the threat such working-class demands posed to liberal institutions in their call for an intrusive and supervisory state, Tocqueville bitterly attacked socialism in a January 1848 speech to the Chamber of Deputies. State provision of industrial jobs would lead, he predicted, to centralized, monolithic state control, and the ultimate erosion of private property, so fundamental and valuable an expression of individual independence.',

            "Tocqueville applauded the quashing of the socialist threat and even supported Cavaignac in the hastily called direct election of a new president held under universal suffrage in December 1848. But Louis Napoleon, the nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, who had become the head of the family when Napoleon\x{2019}s only son died in 1832, trounced Cavaignac by 5.4 to 1.5 million votes. A new legislative assembly was elected in May 1849, also under universal suffrage, and Tocqueville was elected once again from his Normandy seat, winning 110,000 of the 120,000 votes cast. Louis Napoleon, who admired Tocqueville, appointed him foreign minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Odilon Barrot, in which post Tocqueville remained for five months until Barrot\x{2019}s ministry was dismissed. By <<1852|9n:0>>, Louis Napoleon had replaced the republic with a revived empire and declared himself emperor. Under the title Napoleon III, he set about crafting the first modern dictatorship, rooted in popular support\x{2014}just as Tocqueville had foreseen in Democracy in America.",

A fierce breeze blew from the north-west and gave the waters of Lake Erie every appearance of an ocean. On the right, the horizon stretched out limitless; on the left, we hugged the southern shores of the lake which we frequently approached within shouting distance. These shores were entirely flat and contrasted in that respect with all the European lakes I had ever had the opportunity of visiting. Nor were they at all like seashores. Extensive forests cast their shade over them and formed around the lake a dense and almost uninterrupted belt. Occasionally, however, the countryside suddenly changed its appearance. Coming around the angle of a wood, we glimpsed the elegant spire of a bell tower, brilliantly white, and spruce houses and shops. A few steps more and the primitive and apparently impenetrable forest recovered its sway and once again cast the reflection of its foliage upon the waters of the lake.",

Having abandoned any hope of falling asleep, I rose and went to open the door of our cabin to breathe the fresh night air at least. It had not rained again and the atmosphere appeared calm but the forest was already swaying; it growled and moaned far into its depths. Occasionally lightning lit up the sky. The quiet flow of the Saginaw, the narrow strip along its banks, the roofs of five or six cabins, and the belt of surrounding foliage looked just then, for a moment, like an evocation of the future. Everything melted into the darkest obscurity and the frightening voice of the wilderness began again to be heard.',

Only one inhabited spot lay between us and the limitless wilderness and we had just left it behind. Moreover, these thoughts simply served to spur our horses on and after three hours we reached an abandoned wigwam and the isolated banks of the River Cass.
