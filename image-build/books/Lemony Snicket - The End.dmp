The End
By: Lemony SnicketDear Reader,
You are presumably looking at the back of this book, or the end of THE END. The end of THE END is the best place to begin THE END, because if you read THE END from the beginning of the beginning of THE END to the end of the end of THE END, you will arrive at the end of the end of your rope.
This book is the last in A Series of Unfortunate Events, and even if you braved the previous twelve volumes, you probably can't stand such unpleasantries as a fearsome storm, a suspicious beverage, a herd of wild sheep, an enormous bird cage, and a truly haunting secret about the Baudelaire parents.
It has been my solemn occupation to complete the history of the Baudelaire orphans, and at last I am finished. You likely have some other occupation, so if I were you I would drop this book at once, so THE END does not finish you.With all due respect,
Lemony Snicket

CHAPTER FOURTEEN .. 96CHAPTEROne
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{a0}If you have ever peeled an onion, then you know that the first thin, papery layer reveals another thin, papery layer, and that layer reveals another, and another, and before you know it you have hundreds of layers all over the kitchen table and thousands of tears in your eyes, sorry that you ever started peeling in the first place and wishing that you had left the onion alone to wither away on the shelf of the pantry while you went on with your life, even if that meant never again enjoying the complicated and overwhelming taste of this strange and bitter vegetable.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In this way, the story of the Baudelaire orphans is like an onion, and if you insist on reading each and every thin, papery layer in A Series of Unfortunate Events, your only reward will be 170 chapters of misery in your library and countless tears in your eyes. Even if you have read the first twelve volumes of the Baudelaires' story, it is not too late to stop peeling away the layers, and to put this book back on the shelf to wither away while you read something less complicated and overwhelming. The end of this unhappy chronicle is like its bad beginning, as each misfortune only reveals another, and another, and another, and only those with the stomach for this strange and bitter tale should venture any farther into the Baudelaire onion. I'm sorry to tell you this, but that is how the story goes.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaire orphans would have been happy to see an onion, had one come bobbing along as they traveled across the vast and empty sea in a boat the size of a large bed but not nearly as comfortable. Had such a vegetable appeared, Violet, the eldest Baudelaire, would have tied up her hair in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes, and in moments would have invented a device to retrieve the onion from the water. Klaus, the middle sibling and the only boy, would have remembered useful facts from one of the thousands of books he had read, and been able to identify which type of onion it was, and whether or not it was edible. And Sunny, who was just scarcely out of babyhood, would have sliced the onion into bite-sized pieces with her unusually sharp teeth, and put her newly developed cooking skills to good use in order to turn a simple onion into something quite tasty indeed. The elder Baudelaires could imagine their sister announcing \x{201c}Soubise!\x{201d} which was her way of saying \x{201c}Dinner is served.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} But the three children had not seen an onion. Indeed, they had not seen much of anything during their ocean voyage, which had begun when the Baudelaires had pushed the large, wooden boat off the roof of the Hotel Denouement in order to escape from the fire engulfing the hotel, as well as the authorities who wanted to arrest the children for arson and murder. The wind and tides had quickly pushed the boat away from the burning hotel, and by sunset the hotel and all the other buildings in the city were a distant, faraway blur. Now, the following morning, the only things the Baudelaires had seen were the quiet, still surface of the sea and the gray gloom of the sky. The weather reminded them of the day at Briny Beach when the Baudelaires had learned of the loss of their parents and their home in a terrible fire, and the children spent much of their time in silence, thinking about that dreadful day and all of the dreadful days that had followed. It almost would have been peaceful to sit in a drifting boat and think about their lives, had it not been for the Baudelaires' unpleasant companion.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Their companion's name was Count Olaf, and it had been the Baudelaire orphans' misfortune to be in this dreadful man's company since they had become orphans and he had become their guardian. Olaf had hatched scheme after scheme in an attempt to get his filthy hands on the enormous fortune the Baudelaire parents had left behind, and although each scheme had failed, it appeared as if some of the villain's wickedness had rubbed off on the children, and now Olaf and the Baudelaires were all in the same boat. Both the children and the count were responsible for a number of treacherous crimes, although at least the Baudelaire orphans had the decency to feel terrible about this, whereas all Count Olaf had been doing for the past few days was bragging about it.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I've triumphed!\x{201d} Count Olaf reiterated, a word which here means \x{201c}announced for the umpteenth time.\x{201d} He stood proudly at the front of the boat, leaning against a carving of an octopus attacking a man in a diving suit that served as the boat's figurehead. \x{201c}You orphans thought you could escape me, but at last you're in my clutches!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Yes, Olaf,\x{201d} Violet agreed wearily. The eldest Baudelaire did not bother to point out that as they were all alone in the middle of the ocean, it was just as accurate to say that Olaf was in the Baudelaires' clutches as it was to say they were in his. Sighing, she gazed up at the tall mast of the boat, where a tattered sail drooped limply in the still air. For some time, Violet had been trying to invent a way for the boat to move even when there wasn't any wind, but the only mechanical materials on board were a pair of enormous spatulas from the Hotel Denouement's rooftop sunbathing salon. The children had been using these spatulas as oars, but rowing a boat is very hard work, particularly if one's traveling companions are too busy bragging to help out, and Violet was trying to think of a way they might move the boat faster.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I've burned down the Hotel Denouement,\x{201d} Olaf cried, gesturing dramatically, \x{201c}and destroyed V.F.D. once and for all!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}So you keep telling us,\x{201d} Klaus muttered, without looking up from his commonplace book.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} For quite some time, Klaus had been writing down the details of the Baudelaires' situation in this dark blue notebook, including the fact that it was the Baudelaires, not Olaf, who had burned down the Hotel Denouement. V.F.D. was a secret organization that the Baudelaires had heard about during their travels, and as far as the middle Baudelaire knew it had not been destroyed\x{2014}not quite\x{2014}although quite a few V.F.D. agents had been in the hotel when it caught fire. At the moment, Klaus was examining his notes on V.F.D. and the schism, which was an enormous fight involving all of its members and had something to do with a sugar bowl. The middle Baudelaire did not know what the sugar bowl contained, nor did he know the precise whereabouts of one of the organization's bravest agents, a woman named Kit Snicket. The children had met Kit only once before she headed out to sea herself, planning to meet up with the Quagmire triplets, three friends the Baudelaires had not seen in quite some time who were traveling in a self-sustaining hot air mobile home. Klaus was hoping the notes in his commonplace book would help him figure out exactly where they might be, if he studied them long enough.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}And the Baudelaire fortune is finally mine!\x{201d} Olaf cackled. \x{201c}Finally, I am a very wealthy man, which means everybody must do what I say!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Beans,\x{201d} Sunny said. The youngest Baudelaire was no longer a baby, but she still talked in a somewhat unusual way, and by \x{201c}beans\x{201d} she meant something like, \x{201c}Count Olaf is spouting pure nonsense,\x{201d} as the Baudelaire fortune was not to be found in the large, wooden boat, and so could not be said to belong to anyone. But when Sunny said \x{201c}beans,\x{201d} she also meant \x{201c}beans.\x{201d} One of the few things the children had found on board the boat was a large clay jar with a rubber seal, which had been wedged underneath one of the boat's wooden benches. The jar was quite dusty and looked very old, but the seal was intact, a word which here means \x{201c}not broken, so the food stored inside was still edible.\x{201d} Sunny was grateful for the jar, as there was no other food to be found on board, but she couldn't help wishing that it had contained something other than plain white beans. It is possible to cook a number of delicious dishes with white beans\x{2014}the Baudelaire parents used to make a cold salad of white beans, cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil, all mixed together with lime juice, olive oil, and cayenne pepper, which was a delicious thing to eat on hot days\x{2014} but without any other ingredients, Sunny had only been able to serve her boat mates handfuls of a bland, white mush, enough to keep them alive, but certainly nothing in which a young chef like herself could take pride. As Count Olaf continued to brag, the youngest Baudelaire was peering into the jar, wondering how she could make something more interesting out of white beans and nothing else.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I think the first thing I'll buy for myself is a shiny new car!\x{201d} Count Olaf said. \x{201c}Something with a powerful engine, so I can drive faster than the legal limit, and an extra-thick bumper, so I can ram into people without getting all scratched up! I'll name the car Count Olaf, after myself, and whenever people hear the squeal of brakes they'll say, 'Here comes Count Olaf!' Orphans, head for the nearest luxury car dealership!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires looked at one another. As I'm sure you know, it is unlikely for a car dealership to be found in the middle of the ocean, although I have heard of a rickshaw salesman who does business in a grotto hidden deep in the Caspian Sea. It is very tiresome to travel with someone who is constantly making demands, particularly if the demands are for utterly impossible things, and the children found that they could no longer hold their tongues, a phrase which here means \x{201c}keep from confronting Olaf about his foolishness.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We can't head for a car dealership,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}We can't head anywhere. The wind has died out, and Klaus and I are exhausted from rowing.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Laziness is no excuse,\x{201d} Olaf growled. \x{201c}I'm exhausted from all my schemes, but you don't see me complaining.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Furthermore,\x{201d} Klaus said, \x{201c}we have no idea where we are, and so we have no idea which direction to go in.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I know where we are,\x{201d} Olaf sneered. \x{201c}We're in the middle of the ocean.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Beans,\x{201d} Sunny said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I've had enough of your tasteless mush!\x{201d} Olaf snarled. \x{201c}It's worse than that salad your parents used to make! All in all, you orphans are the worst henchmen I've ever acquired!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We're not your henchmen!\x{201d} Violet cried. \x{201c}We simply happen to be traveling together!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I think you're forgetting who the captain is around here,\x{201d} Count Olaf said, and knocked one dirty knuckle against the boat's figurehead. With his other hand, he twirled his harpoon gun, a terrible weapon that had one last sharp harpoon available for his treacherous use. \x{201c}If you don't do what I say, I'll break open this helmet and you'll be doomed.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires looked at the figurehead in dismay. Inside the helmet were a few spores of the Medusoid Mycelium, a terrible fungus that could poison anyone who breathed it in. Sunny would have perished from the mushroom's deadly power not so long ago, had the Baudelaires not managed to find a helping of wasabi, a Japanese condiment that diluted the poison.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You wouldn't dare release the Medusoid Mycelium,\x{201d} Klaus said, hoping he sounded more certain than he felt. \x{201c}You'd be poisoned as quickly as we would.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Equivalent flotilla,\x{201d} Sunny said sternly to the villain.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Our sister's right,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}We're in the same boat, Olaf. The wind has died down, we have no idea which way to go, and we're running low on nourishment. In fact, without a destination, a way of navigating, and some fresh water, we're likely to perish in a matter of days. You might try to help us, instead of ordering us around.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Count Olaf glared at the eldest Baudelaire, and then stalked to the far end of the boat. \x{201c}You three figure out a way to get us out of here,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}and I'll work on changing the nameplate of the boat. I don't want my yacht called Carmelita anymore.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires peered over the edge of the boat, and noticed for the first time a nameplate attached to the rear of the boat with thick tape. On the nameplate, written in a messy scrawl, was the word \x{201c}Carmelita,\x{201d} presumably referring to Carmelita Spats, a nasty young girl whom the Baudelaires had first encountered at a dreadful school they were forced to attend, and who later had been more or less adopted by Count Olaf and his girlfriend Esm\x{e9} Squalor, whom the villain had abandoned at the hotel. Putting down the harpoon gun, Count Olaf began to pick at the tape with his dirt-encrusted fingernails, peeling away at the nameplate to reveal another name underneath. Although the Baudelaire orphans did not care about the name of the boat they now called home, they were grateful that the villain had found something to do with his time so they could spend a few minutes talking among themselves.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}What can we do?\x{201d} Violet whispered to her siblings. \x{201c}Do you think you can catch some fish for us to eat, Sunny?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The youngest Baudelaire shook her head. \x{201c}No bait,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}and no net. Deep-sea dive?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I don't think so,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}You shouldn't be swimming down there without the proper equipment. There are all sorts of sinister things you could encounter.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires shivered, thinking of something they had encountered while on board a submarine called the Queequeg. All the children had seen was a curvy shape on a radar screen that resembled a question mark, but the captain of the submarine had told them that it was something even worse than Olaf himself. \x{201c}Klaus is right,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}You shouldn't swim down there. Klaus, is there anything in your notes that might lead us to the others?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Klaus shut his commonplace book and shook his head. \x{201c}I'm afraid not,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Kit told us she was going to contact Captain Widdershins and meet him at a certain clump of seaweed, but even if we knew exactly which clump she meant, we wouldn't know how to get there without proper navigation equipment.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I could probably make a compass,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}All I need is a small piece of magnetized metal and a simple pivot. But maybe we shouldn't join the other volunteers. After all, we've caused them a great deal of trouble.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}That's true,\x{201d} Klaus admitted. \x{201c}They might not be happy to see us, particularly if we had Count Olaf along.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sunny looked at the villain, who was still scraping away at the nameplate. \x{201c}Unless,\x{201d} she said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Violet and Klaus shared a nervous glance. \x{201c}Unless what?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sunny was silent for a moment, and looked down at the concierge uniform she was still wearing from her time at the hotel. \x{201c}Push Olaf overboard,\x{201d} she whispered.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The elder Baudelaires gasped, not just because of what Sunny had said but because they could easily picture the treacherous act Sunny had described. With Count Olaf overboard, the Baudelaires could sail someplace without the villain's interference, or his threats to release the Medusoid Mycelium. There would be one fewer person with whom to share the remaining beans, and if they ever reached Kit Snicket and the Quagmires they wouldn't have Olaf along. In uneasy silence they turned their gazes to the back of the boat, where Olaf was leaning over to peel off the nameplate. All three Baudelaires could imagine how simple it would be to push him, just hard enough for the villain to lose his balance and topple into the water.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Olaf wouldn't hesitate to throw us overboard,\x{201d} Violet said, so quietly her siblings could scarcely hear her. \x{201c}If he didn't need us to sail the boat, he'd toss us into the sea.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}V.F.D. might not hesitate, either,\x{201d} Klaus said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Parents?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires shared another uneasy glance. The children had recently learned another mysterious fact about their parents and their shadowy past\x{2014}a rumor concerning their parents and a box of poison darts. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, like all children, had always wanted to believe the best about their parents, but as time went on they were less and less sure. What the siblings needed was a compass, but not the sort of compass Violet had mentioned. The eldest Baudelaire was talking about a navigational compass, which is a device that allows a person to tell you the proper direction to travel in the ocean. But the Baudelaires needed a moral compass, which is something inside a person, in the brain or perhaps in the heart, that tells you the proper thing to do in a given situation. A navigational compass, as any good inventor knows, is made from a small piece of magnetized metal and a simple pivot, but the ingredients in a moral compass are not as clear. Some believe that everyone is born with a moral compass already inside them, like an appendix, or a fear of worms. Others believe that a moral compass develops over time, as a person learns about the decisions of others by observing the world and reading books. In any case, a moral compass appears to be a delicate device, and as people grow older and venture out into the world, it often becomes more and more difficult to figure out which direction one's moral compass is pointing, so it is harder and harder to figure out the proper thing to do. When the Baudelaires first encountered Count Olaf, their moral compasses never would have told them to get rid of this terrible man, whether by pushing him out of his mysterious tower room or running him over with his long, black automobile. But now, standing on the Carmelita, the Baudelaire orphans were not sure what they should do with this villain who was leaning so far over the boat that one small push would have sent him to his watery grave.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} But as it happened, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny did not have to make this decision, because at that instant, as with so many instants in the Baudelaire lives, the decision was made for them, as Count Olaf straightened up and gave the children a triumphant grin. \x{201c}I'm a genius!\x{201d} he announced. \x{201c}I've solved all of our problems! Look!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The villain gestured behind him with one thick thumb, and the Baudelaires peered over the edge of the boat and saw that the CARMELITA nameplate had been removed, revealing a nameplate reading COUNT OLAF, although this nameplate, too, was attached with tape, and it appeared that yet another name-plate was underneath this one. \x{201c}Renaming the boat doesn't solve any of our problems,\x{201d} Violet said wearily.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Violet is right,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}We still need a destination, a way of navigating, and some kind of nourishment.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Unless,\x{201d} Sunny said, but Count Olaf interrupted the youngest Baudelaire with a sly chuckle.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You three are really quite slow-witted,\x{201d} the villain said. \x{201c}Look at the horizon, you fools, and see what is approaching! We don't need a destination or a way of navigating, because we'll go wherever it takes us! And we're about to get more fresh water than we could drink in a lifetime!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires looked out at the sea, and saw what Olaf was talking about. Spilling across the sky, like ink staining a precious document, was an immense bank of black clouds. In the middle of the ocean, a fierce storm can arrive out of nowhere, and this storm promised to be very fierce indeed\x{2014}much fiercer than Hurricane Herman, which had menaced the Baudelaires some time ago during a voyage across Lake Lachrymose that ended in tragedy. Already the children could see the thin, sharp lines of rain falling some distance away, and here and there the clouds flickered with furious lightning.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Isn't it wonderful?\x{201d} Count Olaf asked, his scraggly hair already fluttering in the approaching wind. Over the villain's nefarious chuckle the children could hear the sound of approaching thunder. \x{201c}A storm like this is the answer to all your whining.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}It might destroy the boat,\x{201d} Violet said, looking nervously up at the tattered sails. \x{201c}A boat of this size is not designed to withstand a heavy storm.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We have no idea where it will take us,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}We could end up even further from civilization.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}All overboard,\x{201d} Sunny said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Count Olaf looked out at the horizon again, and smiled at the storm as if it were an old friend coming to visit. \x{201c}Yes, those things might happen,\x{201d} he said with a wicked smile. \x{201c}But what are you going to do about it, orphans?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires followed the villain's gaze to the storm. It was difficult to believe that just moments ago the horizon had been empty, and now this great black mass of rain and wind was staining the sky as it drew closer and closer. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny could do nothing about it. An inventing mind, the notes of a researcher, and surprisingly adept cooking skills were no match for what was coming. The storm clouds unfurled wider and wider, like the layers of an onion unpeeling, or a sinister secret becoming more and more mysterious. Whatever their moral compass told them about the proper thing to do, the Baudelaire orphans knew there was only one choice in this situation, and that was to do nothing as the storm engulfed the children and the villain as they stood together in the same boat.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It is useless for me to describe to you how terrible Violet, Klaus, and even Sunny felt in the hours that followed. Most people who have survived a storm at sea are so shaken by the experience that they never want to speak of it again, and so if a writer wishes to describe a storm at sea, his only method of research is to stand on a large, wooden boat with a notebook and pen, ready to take notes should a storm suddenly strike. But I have already stood on a large, wooden boat with a notebook and pen, ready to take notes should a storm suddenly strike, and by the time the storm cleared I was so shaken by the experience that I never wanted to speak of it again. So it is useless for me to describe the force of the wind that tore through the sails as if they were paper, and sent the boat spinning like an ice-skater showing off. It is impossible for me to convey the volume of rain that fell, drenching the Baudelaires in freezing water so their concierge uniforms clung to them like an extra layer of soaked and icy skin. It is futile for me to portray the streaks of lightning that clattered down from the swirling clouds, striking the mast of the boat and sending it toppling into the churning sea. It is inadequate for me to report on the deafening thunder that rang in the Baudelaires' ears, and it is superfluous for me to recount how the boat began to tilt back and forth, sending all of its contents tumbling into the ocean: first the jar of beans, hitting the surface of the water with a loud glop!, and then the spatulas, the lightning reflecting off their mirrored surfaces as they disappeared into the swirling tides, and lastly the sheets Violet had taken from the hotel laundry room and fashioned into a drag chute so the boat would survive its drop from the rooftop sunbathing salon, billowing in the stormy air like jellyfish before sinking into the sea. It is worthless for me to specify the increasing size of the waves rising out of water, first like shark fins, and then like tents, and then finally like glaciers, their icy peaks climbing higher and higher until they finally came crashing down on the soaked and crippled boat with an unearthly roar like the laughter of some terrible beast. It is bootless for me to render an account of the Baudelaire orphans clinging to one another in fear and desperation, certain that at any moment they would be dragged away and tossed to their watery graves, while Count Olaf clung to the harpoon gun and the wooden figurehead, as if a terrible weapon and a deadly fungus were the only things he loved in the world, and it is of no earthly use to provide a report on the front of the figurehead detaching from the boat with a deafening crackle, sending the Baudelaires spinning in one direction and Olaf spinning in the other, or the sudden jolt as the rest of the boat abruptly stopped spinning, and a horrible scraping sound came from beneath the shuddering wood floor of the craft, as if a gigantic hand were grabbing the remains of the Count Olaf from below, and holding the trembling siblings in its strong and steady grip. Certainly the Baudelaires did not find it necessary to wonder what had happened now, after all those terrible, whirling hours in the heart of the storm, but simply crawled together to a far corner of the boat, and huddled against one another, too stunned to cry, as they listened to the sea rage around them, and heard the frantic cries of Count Olaf, wondering if he were being torn limb from limb by the furious storm, or if he, too, had found some strange safety, and not knowing which fate they wished upon the man who had flung so much misfortune on the three of them. There is no need for me to describe this storm, as it would only be another layer of this unfortunate onion of a story, and in any case by the time the sun rose the next morning, the swirling black clouds were already scurrying away from the bedraggled Baudelaires, and the air was silent and still, as if the whole evening had only been a ghastly nightmare.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The children stood up unsteadily in their piece of the boat, their limbs aching from clinging to one another all night, and tried to figure out where in the world they were, and how in the world they had survived. But as they gazed around at their surroundings, they could not answer these questions, as they had never seen anything in the world like the sight that awaited them.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At first, it appeared that the Baudelaire orphans were still in the middle of the ocean, as all the children could see was a flat and wet landscape stretching out in all directions, fading into the gray morning mist. But as they peered over the side of their ruined boat, the children saw that the water was not much deeper than a puddle, and this enormous puddle was littered with detritus, a word which here means \x{201c}all sorts of strange items.\x{201d} There were large pieces of wood sticking out of the water like jagged teeth, and long lengths of rope tangled into damp and complicated knots. There were great heaps of seaweed, and thousands of fish wriggling and gaping at the sun as seabirds swooped down from the misty sky and helped themselves to a seafood breakfast. There were what looked like pieces of other boats\x{2014}anchors and portholes, railings and masts, scattered every which way like broken toys\x{2014}and other objects that might have been from the boats' cargo, including shattered lanterns, smashed barrels, soaked documents, and the ripped remains of all sorts of clothing, from top hats to roller skates. There was an old-fashioned typewriter leaning against a large, ornate bird cage, with a family of guppies wriggling through its keys. There was a large, brass cannon, with a large crab clawing its way out of the barrel, and there was a hopelessly torn net caught in the blades of a propeller. It was as if the storm had swept away the entire sea, leaving all of its contents scattered on the ocean floor.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}What is this place?\x{201d} Violet said, in a hushed whisper. \x{201c}What happened?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Klaus took his glasses out of his pocket, where he had put them for safekeeping, and was relieved to see they were unharmed. \x{201c}I think we're on a coastal shelf,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}There are places in the sea where the water is suddenly very shallow, usually near land. The storm must have thrown our boat onto the shelf, along with all this other wreckage.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Land?\x{201d} Sunny asked, holding her tiny hand over her eyes so she might see farther. \x{201c}Don't see.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Klaus stepped carefully over the side of the boat. The dark water only came up to his knees, and he began to walk around the boat in careful strides. \x{201c}Coastal shelves are usually much smaller than this,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}but there must be an island somewhere close by. Let's look for it.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Violet followed her brother out of the boat, carrying her sister, who was still quite short. \x{201c}Which direction do you think we should go?\x{201d} she asked. \x{201c}We don't want to get lost.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sunny gave her siblings a small smile. \x{201c}Already lost,\x{201d} she pointed out.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Sunny's right,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}Even if we had a compass, we don't know where we are or where we are going. We might as well head in any direction at all.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Then I vote we head west,\x{201d} Violet said, pointing in the opposite direction of the rising sun. \x{201c}If we're going to be walking for a while, we don't want the sun in our eyes.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Unless we find our concierge sunglasses,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}The storm blew them away, but they might have landed on the same shelf.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We could find anything here,\x{201d} Violet said, and the Baudelaires had walked only a few steps before they saw this was so, for floating in the water was one piece of detritus they wished had blown away from them forever. Floating in a particularly filthy part of the water, stretched out flat on his back with his harpoon gun leaning across one shoulder, was Count Olaf. The villain's eyes were closed underneath his one eyebrow, and he did not move. In all their miserable times with the count, the Baudelaires had never seen Olaf look so calm.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I guess we didn't need to throw him overboard,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}The storm did it for us.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Klaus leaned down to peer closer to Olaf, but the villain still did not stir. \x{201c}It must have been terrible,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}to try and ride out the storm with no kind of shelter whatsoever.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Kikbucit?\x{201d} Sunny asked, but at that moment Count Olaf's eyes opened and the youngest Baudelaire's question was answered. Frowning, the villain moved his eyes in one direction and then the other.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Where am I?\x{201d} he muttered, spitting a piece of seaweed out of his mouth. \x{201c}Where's my figurehead?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Coastal shelf,\x{201d} Sunny replied.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At the sound of Sunny's voice, Count Olaf blinked and sat up, glaring at the children and shaking water out of his ears. \x{201c}Get me some coffee, orphans!\x{201d} he ordered. \x{201c}I had a very unpleasant evening, and I'd like a nice, hearty breakfast before deciding what to do with you.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}There's no coffee here,\x{201d} Violet said, although there was in fact an espresso machine about twenty feet away. \x{201c}We're walking west, in the hopes of finding an island.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You'll walk where I tell you to walk,\x{201d} Olaf growled. \x{201c}Are you forgetting that I'm the captain of this boat?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}The boat is stuck in the sand,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}It's quite damaged.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Well, you're still my hench people,\x{201d} the villain said, \x{201c}and my orders are that we walk west, in the hopes of finding an island. I've heard about islands in the distant parts of the sea. The primitive inhabitants have never seen civilized people, so they will probably revere me as a god.\x{201d} The Baudelaires looked at one another and sighed. \x{201c}'Revere\x{201d} is a word which here means \x{201c}praise highly, and have a great deal of respect for,\x{201d} and there was no person the children revered less than the dreadful man who was standing before them, picking his teeth with a bit of seashell and referring to people who lived in a certain region of the world as \x{201c}primitive.\x{201d} Yet it seemed that no matter where the Baudelaires traveled, there were people either so greedy that they respected and praised Olaf for his evil ways, or so foolish that they didn't notice how dreadful he really was. It was enough to make the children want to abandon Olaf there on the coastal shelf, but it is difficult to abandon someone in a place where everything is already abandoned, and so the three orphans and the one villain trudged together westward across the cluttered coastal shelf in silence, wondering what was in store for them. Count Olaf led the way, balancing the harpoon gun on one shoulder, and interrupting the silence every so often to demand coffee, fresh juice, and other equally unobtainable breakfast items. Violet walked behind him, using a broken banister she found as a walking stick and poking at interesting mechanical scraps she found in the muck, and Klaus walked alongside his sister, jotting the occasional note in his commonplace book. Sunny climbed on top of Violet's shoulders to serve as a sort of lookout, and it was the youngest Baudelaire who broke the silence with a triumphant cry.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Land ho!\x{201d} she cried, pointing into the mist, and the three Baudelaires could see the faint shape of an island rising out of the shelf. The island looked narrow and long, like a freight train, and if they squinted they could see clusters of trees and what looked like enormous sheets of white cloth billowing in the wind.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I've discovered an island!\x{201d} Count Olaf cackled. \x{201c}I'm going to name it Olaf-Land!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You didn't discover the island,\x{201d} Violet pointed out. \x{201c}It appears that people already live on it.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}And I am their king!\x{201d} Count Olaf proclaimed. \x{201c}Hurry up, orphans! My royal subjects are going to cook me a big breakfast, and if I'm in a good mood I might let you lick the plates!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires had no intention of licking the plates of Olaf or anyone else, but nevertheless they continued walking toward the island, maneuvering around the wreckage that still littered the surface of the shelf. They had just walked around a grand piano, which was sticking straight out of the water as if it had fallen from the sky, when something caught the Baudelaire eyes\x{2014}a tiny white figure, scurrying toward them.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}What?\x{201d} Sunny asked. \x{201c}Who?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}It might be another survivor of the storm,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}Our boat couldn't have been the only one in this area of the ocean.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Do you think the storm reached Kit Snicket?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Or the triplets?\x{201d} Sunny said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Count Olaf scowled, and put one muddy finger on the trigger of the harpoon gun. \x{201c}If that's Kit Snicket or some bratty orphan,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}I'll harpoon her right where she stands. No ridiculous volunteer is going to take my island away from me!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You don't want to waste your last harpoon,\x{201d} Violet said, thinking quickly. \x{201c}Who knows where you'll find another one?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}That's true,\x{201d} Olaf admitted. \x{201c}You're becoming an excellent henchwoman.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Poppycock,\x{201d} growled Sunny, baring her teeth at the count.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{201c}My sister's right,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}It's ridiculous to argue about volunteers and hench-people when we're standing on a coastal shelf in the middle of the ocean.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Don't be so sure, orphan,\x{201d} Olaf replied. \x{201c}No matter where we are, there's always room for someone like me.\x{201d} He leaned down close to give Klaus a sneaky smile, as if he were telling a joke. \x{201c}Haven't you learned that by now?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It was an unpleasant question, but the Baudelaires did not have time to answer it, as the figure drew closer and closer until the children could see it was a young girl, perhaps six or seven years old. She was barefoot, and dressed in a simple, white robe that was so clean she could not have been in the storm. Hanging from the girl's belt was a large white seashell, and she was wearing a pair of sunglasses that looked very much like the ones the Baudelaires had worn as concierges. She was grinning from ear to ear, but when she reached the Baudelaires, panting from her long run, she suddenly looked shy, and although the Baudelaires were quite curious as to who she was, they also found themselves keeping silent. Even Olaf did not speak, and merely admired his reflection in the water.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When you find yourself tongue-tied in front of someone you do not know, you might want to remember something the Baudelaires' mother told them long ago, and something she told me even longer ago. I can see her now, sitting on a small couch she used to keep in the corner of her bedroom, adjusting the straps of her sandals with one hand and munching on an apple with the other, telling me not to worry about the party that was beginning downstairs. \x{201c}People love to talk about themselves, Mr. Snicket,\x{201d} she said to me, between bites of apple. \x{201c}If you find yourself wondering what to say to any of the guests, ask them which secret code they prefer, or find out whom they've been spying on lately.\x{201d} Violet, too, could almost hear her mother's voice as she gazed down at this young girl, and decided to ask her something about herself.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}What's your name?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The girl fiddled with her seashell, and then looked up at the eldest Baudelaire. \x{201c}Friday,\x{201d} she said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Do you live on the island, Friday?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} the girl said. \x{201c}I got up early this morning to go storm scavenging.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Storm scavawha?\x{201d} Sunny asked, from Violet's shoulders.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Every time there's a storm, everyone in the colony gathers everything that's collected on the coastal shelf,\x{201d} Friday said. \x{201c}One never knows when one of these items will come in handy. Are you castaways?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I guess we are,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}We were traveling by boat when we got caught in the storm. I'm Violet Baudelaire, and this is my brother, Klaus, and my sister, Sunny.\x{201d} She turned reluctantly to Olaf, who was glaring at Friday suspiciously. \x{201c}And this is\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I am your king!\x{201d} Olaf announced in a grand voice. \x{201c}Bow before me, Friday!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}No, thank you,\x{201d} Friday said politely. \x{201c}Our colony is not a monarchy. You must be exhausted from the storm, Baudelaires. It looked so enormous from shore that we didn't think there'd be any castaways this time. Why don't you come with me, and you can have something to eat?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We'd be most grateful,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}Do castaways arrive on this island very often?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}From time to time,\x{201d} Friday said, with a small shrug. \x{201c}It seems that everything eventually washes up on our shores.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}The shores of Olaf-Land, you mean,\x{201d} Count Olaf growled. \x{201c}I discovered the island, so I get to name it.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Friday peered at Olaf curiously from behind her sunglasses. \x{201c}You must be confused, sir, after your journey through the storm,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}People have lived on the island for many, many years.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Primitive people,\x{201d} sneered the villain. \x{201c}I don't even see any houses on the island.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We live in tents,\x{201d} Friday said, pointing at the billowing white cloths on the island. \x{201c}We grew tired of building houses that would only get blown away during the stormy season, and the rest of the time the weather is so hot that we appreciate the ventilation that a tent provides.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I still say you're primitive,\x{201d} Olaf insisted, \x{201c}and I don't listen to primitive people.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I won't force you,\x{201d} Friday said. \x{201c}Come along with me and you can decide for yourself.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I'm not going to come along with you,\x{201d} Count Olaf said, \x{201c}and neither are my hench people! I'm Count Olaf, and I'm in charge around here, not some little idiot in a robe!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}There's no reason to be insulting,\x{201d} Friday said. \x{201c}The island is the only place you can go, Count Olaf, so it really doesn't matter who's in charge.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Count Olaf gave Friday a terrible scowl, and he pointed his harpoon gun straight at the young girl. \x{201c}If you don't bow before me, Friday, I'll fire this harpoon gun at you!\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires gasped, but Friday merely frowned at the villain. \x{201c}In a few minutes,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}all the inhabitants of the island will be out storm scavenging. They'll see any act of violence you commit, and you won't be allowed on the island. Please point that weapon away from me.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Count Olaf opened his mouth as if to say something, but after a moment he shut it again, and lowered the harpoon gun sheepishly, a word which here means \x{201c}looking quite embarrassed to be following the orders of a young girl.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Baudelaires, please come with me,\x{201d} Friday said, and began to lead the way toward the distant island.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}What about me?\x{201d} Count Olaf asked. His voice was a little squeaky, and it reminded the Baudelaires of other voices they had heard, from people who were frightened of Olaf himself. They had heard this voice from guardians of theirs, and from Mr. Poe when the villain would confront him. It was a tone of voice they had heard from various volunteers when discussing Olaf's activities, and even from his henchmen when they complained about their wicked boss. It was a tone of voice the Baudelaires had heard from themselves, during the countless times the dreadful man had threatened them, and promised to get his hands on their fortune, but the children never thought they would hear it from Count Olaf himself. \x{201c}What about me?\x{201d} he asked again, but the siblings had already followed Friday a short way from where he was standing, and when the Baudelaire orphans turned to him, Olaf looked like just another piece of detritus that the storm had blown onto the coastal shelf.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Go away,\x{201d} Friday said firmly, and the castaways wondered if finally they had found a place where there was no room for Count Olaf.CHAPTERThree\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As I'm sure you know, there are many words in our mysterious and confusing language that can mean two completely different things. The word \x{201c}bear,\x{201d} for instance, can refer to a rather husky mammal found in the woods, as in the sentence \x{201c}The bear moved quietly toward the camp counselor, who was too busy putting on lipstick to notice,\x{201d} but it can also refer to how much someone can handle, as in the sentence \x{201c}The loss of my camp counselor is more than I can bear.\x{201d} The word \x{201c}yarn\x{201d} can refer both to a colorful strand of wool, as in the sentence \x{201c}His sweater was made of yarn,\x{201d} and to a long and rambling story, as in the sentence \x{201c}His yarn about how he lost his sweater almost put me to sleep.\x{201d} The word \x{201c}hard\x{201d} can refer both to something that is difficult and something that is firm to the touch, and unless you come across a sentence like \x{201c}The bears bear hard hard yarn yarns\x{201d} you are unlikely to be confused. But as the Baudelaire orphans followed Friday across the coastal shelf toward the island where she lived, they experienced both definitions of the word \x{201c}cordial,\x{201d} which can refer both to a person who is friendly and to a drink that is sweet, and the more they had of <<one|3j>> the more they were confused about the other.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Perhaps you would care for some coconut cordial,\x{201d} Friday said, in a cordial tone of voice, and she reached down to the seashell that hung around her neck. With one slim finger she plucked out a stopper, and the children could see that the shell had been fashioned into a sort of canteen. \x{201c}You must be thirsty from your journey through the storm.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We are thirsty,\x{201d} Violet admitted, \x{201c}but isn't fresh water better for thirst?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}There's no fresh water on the island,\x{201d} Friday said. \x{201c}There's some saltwater falls that we use for washing, and a saltwater pool that's perfect for swimming. But all we drink is coconut cordial. We drain the milk from coconuts and allow it to ferment.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Ferment?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Friday means that the coconut milk sits around for some time, and undergoes a chemical process making it sweeter and stronger,\x{201d} Klaus explained, having learned about fermentation in a book about a vineyard his parents had kept in the Baudelaire library.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}The sweetness will wash away the taste of the storm,\x{201d} Friday said, and passed the seashell to the three children. One by one they each took a sip of the cordial. As Friday had said, the cordial was quite sweet, but there was another taste beyond the sweetness, something odd and strong that made them a bit dizzy. Violet and Klaus both winced as the cordial slipped thickly down their throats, and Sunny coughed as soon as the first drop reached her tongue.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}It's a little strong for us, Friday,\x{201d} Violet said, handing the seashell back to Friday.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You'll get used to it,\x{201d} Friday said with a smile, \x{201c}when you drink it at every meal. That's one of the customs here.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I see,\x{201d} Klaus said, making a note in his commonplace book. \x{201c}What other customs do you have here?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Not too many,\x{201d} Friday said, looking first at Klaus's notebook and then around her, where the Baudelaires could see the distant figures of other islanders, all dressed in white, walking around the costal shelf and poking at the wreckage they found. \x{201c}Every time there's a storm, we go storm scavenging and present what we've found to a man named Ishmael. Ishmael has been on this island longer than any of us, and he injured his feet some time ago and keeps them covered in island clay, which has healing powers. Ishmael can't even stand, but he serves as the island's facilitator.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Demarc?\x{201d} Sunny asked Klaus.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}A facilitator is someone who helps other people make decisions,\x{201d} the middle Baudelaire explained.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Friday nodded in agreement. \x{201c}Ishmael decides what detritus might be of use to us, and what the sheep should drag away.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}There are sheep on the island?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}A herd of wild sheep washed up on our shores many, many years ago,\x{201d} Friday said, \x{201c}and they roam free, except when they're needed to drag our scavenged items to the arboretum, on the far side of the island over that brae over there.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Brae?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}A brae is a steep hill,\x{201d} Klaus said, \x{201c}and an arboretum is a place where trees grow.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}All that grows in the island's arboretum is one enormous apple tree,\x{201d} Friday said, \x{201c}or at least, that's what I've heard.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You've never been to the far side of the island?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}No one goes to the far side of the island,\x{201d} Friday said. \x{201c}Ishmael says it's too dangerous with all the items the sheep have brought there. Nobody even picks the bitter apples from the tree, except on Decision Day.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Holiday?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{201c}I guess it's something of a holiday,\x{201d} Friday said. \x{201c}Once a year, the tides turn in this part of the ocean, and the coastal shelf is completely covered in water. It's the one time a year that it's deep enough to sail away from the island. All year long we build an enormous outrigger, which is a type of canoe, and the day the tides turn we have a feast and a talent show. Then anyone who wishes to leave our colony indicates their decision by taking a bite of bitter apple and spitting it onto the ground before boarding the outrigger and bidding us farewell.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Yuck,\x{201d} the youngest Baudelaire said, imagining a crowd of people spitting up apple.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}There's nothing yucky about it,\x{201d} Friday said with a frown. \x{201c}It's the colony's most important custom.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I'm sure it's wonderful,\x{201d} Violet said, reminding her sister with a stern glance that it is not polite to insult the customs of others.",

            "A Series of Unfortunate Events 13 - The End\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Where are we?\x{201d} Kit said. The Baudelaires were silent for a moment, and realized for the first time that they did not even know the name of the place where they were. \x{201c}We're on a coastal shelf,\x{201d} Violet said finally, although she decided not to add that they had been abandoned there.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}There's an island nearby,\x{201d} Klaus said. The middle Baudelaire did not explain that they were not welcome to set foot on it.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Safe,\x{201d} Sunny said, but she did not mention that Decision Day was approaching, and that soon the entire area would be flooded with seawater. Without discussing the matter, the Baudelaires decided not to tell Kit the whole story, not yet.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Of course,\x{201d} Kit murmured. \x{201c}I should have known I'd be here. Eventually, everything washes up on these shores.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Have you been here before?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}No,\x{201d} Kit said, \x{201c}but I've heard about this place. My associates have told me stories of its mechanical wonders, its enormous library, and the gourmet meals the islanders prepare. Why, the day before I met you, Baudelaires, I shared Turkish coffee with an associate who was saying that he'd never had better Oysters Rockefeller than during his time on the island. You must be having a wonderful time here.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Janiceps,\x{201d} Sunny said, restating an earlier opinion.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I think this place has changed since your associate was here,\x{201d} said Klaus.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}That's probably true,\x{201d} Kit said thoughtfully. \x{201c}Thursday did say that the colony had suffered a schism, just as V.F.D. did.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Another schism?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Countless schisms have divided the world over the years,\x{201d} Kit replied in the darkness. \x{201c}Do you think the history of V.F.D. is the only story in the world? But let's not talk of the past, Baudelaires. Tell me how you made your way to these shores.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}The same way you did,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}We were castaways. The only way we could leave the Hotel Denouement was by boat.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I knew you ran into danger there,\x{201d} Kit said. \x{201c}We were watching the skies. We saw the smoke and we knew you were signaling us that it wasn't safe to join you. Thank you, Baudelaires. I knew you wouldn't fail us. Tell me, is Dewey with you?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Kit's words were almost more than the Baudelaires could stand. The smoke she had seen, of course, was from the fire the children had set in the hotel's laundry room, which had quickly spread to the entire building, interrupting Count Olaf's trial and endangering the lives of all the people inside, villains and volunteers alike. And Dewey, I'm sad to remind you, was not with the Baudelaires, but lying dead at the bottom of a pond, still clutching the harpoon that the three siblings had fired into his heart. But Violet, Klaus, and Sunny could not bring themselves to tell Kit the whole story, not now. They could not bear to tell her what had happened to Dewey, and to all the other noble people they had encountered, not yet. Not now, not yet, and perhaps not ever.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}No,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}Dewey isn't here.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Count Olaf is with us,\x{201d} Klaus said, \x{201c}but he's locked up.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Viper,\x{201d} Sunny added.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Oh, I'm glad Ink is safe,\x{201d} Kit said, and the Baudelaires thought they could almost hear her smile. \x{201c}That's my special nickname for the Incredibly Deadly Viper. Ink kept me good company on this raft after we were separated from the others.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}The Quagmires?\x{201d} Klaus asked. \x{201c}You found them?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} Kit said, and coughed a bit. \x{201c}But they're not here.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Maybe they'll wash up here, too,\x{201d} Violet said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Maybe,\x{201d} Kit said uncertainly. \x{201c}And maybe Dewey will join us, too. We need as many associates as we can if we're going to return to the world and make sure that justice is served. But first, let's find this colony I've heard so much about. I need a shower and a hot meal, and then I want to hear the whole story of what happened to you.\x{201d} She started to lower herself down from the raft, but then stopped with a cry of pain.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You shouldn't move,\x{201d} Violet said quickly, glad for an excuse to keep Kit on the coastal shelf. \x{201c}Your foot's been injured.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Both my feet have been injured,\x{201d} Kit corrected ruefully, lying back down on the raft. \x{201c}The telegram device fell on my legs when the submarine was attacked. I need your help, Baudelaires. I need to be someplace safe.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We'll do everything we can,\x{201d} Klaus said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{201c}Maybe help is on the way,\x{201d} Kit said. \x{201c}I can see someone coming.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires turned to look, and in the dark they saw a very tiny, very bright light, skittering toward them from the west. At first the light looked like nothing more than a firefly, darting here and there on the coastal shelf, but gradually the children could see it was a flashlight, around which several figures in white robes huddled, walking carefully among the puddles and debris. The shine of the flashlight reminded Klaus of all of the nights he spent reading under the covers in the Baudelaire mansion, while outside the night made mysterious noises his parents always insisted were nothing more than the wind, even on windless evenings. Some mornings, his father would come into Klaus's room to wake him up and find him asleep, still clutching his flashlight in one hand and his book in the other, and as the flashlight drew closer and closer, the middle Baudelaire could not help but think that it was his father, walking across the coastal shelf to come to his children's aid after all this time. But of course it was not the Baudelaires' father. The figures arrived at the cube of books, and the children could see the faces of two islanders: Finn, who was holding the flashlight, and Erewhon, who was carrying a large, covered basket.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Good evening, Baudelaires,\x{201d} Finn said. In the dim light of the flashlight she looked even younger than she was.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We brought you some supper,\x{201d} Erewhon said, and held out the basket to the children. \x{201c}We were concerned that you might be quite hungry out here.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We are,\x{201d} Violet admitted. The Baudelaires, of course, wished that the islanders had expressed their concern in front of Ishmael and the others, when the colony was deciding to abandon the children on the coastal shelf, but as Finn opened the basket and the children smelled the island's customary dinner of onion soup, the children did not want to look a gift horse in the mouth, a phrase which here means \x{201c}turn down an offer of a hot meal, no matter how disappointed they were in the person who was offering it.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Is there enough for our friend?\x{201d} Klaus asked. \x{201c}She's regained consciousness.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I'm glad to hear it,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}There's enough food for everyone.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}As long as you keep the secret of our coming here,\x{201d} Erewhon said. \x{201c}Ishmael might not think it was proper.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I'm surprised he doesn't forbid the use of flashlights,\x{201d} Violet said, as Finn handed her a coconut shell full of steaming soup.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Ishmael doesn't forbid anything,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}He'd never force me to throw this flashlight away. However, he did suggest that I let the sheep take it to the arboretum. Instead I slipped it into my robe, as a secret, and Madame Nordoff has been secretly supplying me with batteries in exchange for my secretly teaching her how to yodel, which Ishmael says might frighten the other islanders.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}And Mrs. Caliban secretly slipped me this picnic basket,\x{201d} Erewhon said, \x{201c}in exchange for my secretly teaching her the backstroke, which Ishmael says is not the customary way to swim.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Mrs. Caliban?\x{201d} said Kit, in the darkness. \x{201c}Miranda Caliban is here?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}Do you know her?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I know her husband,\x{201d} Kit said. \x{201c}He and I stood together in a time of great struggle, and we're still very good friends.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Your friend must be a little confused after her difficult journey,\x{201d} Erewhon said to the Baudelaires, standing on tiptoes so she could hand Kit some soup. \x{201c}Mrs. Caliban's husband perished many years ago in the storm that brought her here.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}That's impossible,\x{201d} Kit said, reaching down to take the bowl from the young girl. \x{201c}I just had Turkish coffee with him.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Mrs. Caliban is not the sort to keep secrets,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}That's why she lives on the island. It's a safe place, far from the treachery of the world.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Enigmorama,\x{201d} Sunny said, putting her coconut shell of soup on the ground so she could share it with the Incredibly Deadly Viper.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}My sister means that it seems this island has plenty of secrets,\x{201d} Klaus said, thinking wistfully of his commonplace book and all the secrets its pages contained.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I'm afraid we have one more secret to discuss,\x{201d} Erewhon said. \x{201c}Turn the flashlight off, Finn. We don't want to be seen from the island.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Finn nodded, and turned the flashlight off. The Baudelaires had one last glimpse of each other before the darkness engulfed them, and for a moment everyone stood in silence, as if afraid to speak.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Many, many years ago, when even the great-great-grandparents of the oldest person you know were not even day-old infants, and when the city where the Baudelaires were born was nothing more than a handful of dirt huts, and the Hotel Denouement nothing but an architectural sketch, and the faraway island had a name, and was not considered very faraway at all, there was a group of people known as the Cimmerians. They were a nomadic people, which meant that they traveled constantly, and they often traveled at night, when the sun would not give them sunburn and when the coastal shelves in the area in which they lived were not flooded with water. Because they traveled in shadows, few people ever got a good look at the Cimmerians, and they were considered sneaky and mysterious people, and to this day things done in the dark tend to have a somewhat sinister reputation. A man digging a hole in his backyard during the afternoon, for instance, looks like a gardener, but a man digging a hole at night looks like he's burying some terrible secret, and a woman who gazes out of her window in the daytime appears to be enjoying the view, but looks more like a spy if she waits until nightfall. The nighttime digger may actually be planting a tree to surprise his niece while the niece giggles at him from the window, and the morning window watcher may actually be planning to blackmail the so-called gardener as he buries the evidence of his vicious crimes, but thanks to the Cimmerians, the darkness makes even the most innocent of activities seem suspicious, and so in the darkness of the coastal shelf, the Baudelaires suspected that the question Finn asked was a sinister one, even though it could have been something one of their teachers might have asked in the classroom.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Do you know the meaning of the word mutiny'?\x{201d} she asked, in a calm, quiet voice.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Violet and Sunny knew that Klaus would answer, although they were pretty sure themselves what the word meant. \x{201c}A mutiny is when a group of people take action against a leader.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}Professor Fletcher taught me the word.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We are here to tell you that a mutiny will take place at breakfast,\x{201d} said Erewhon. \x{201c}More and more colonists are getting sick and tired of the way things are going on the island, and Ishmael is the root of the trouble.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Tuber?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} '\x{201c}Root of the trouble' means 'the cause of the islanders' problems,'\x{201d} Klaus explained.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Exactly,\x{201d} Erewhon said, \x{201c}and when Decision Day arrives we will finally have the opportunity to get rid of him.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Rid of him?\x{201d} Violet repeated, the phrase sounding sinister in the dark.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We're going to force him aboard the outrigger right after breakfast,\x{201d} Erewhon said, \x{201c}and push him out to sea as the coastal shelf floods.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}A man traveling the ocean alone is unlikely to survive,\x{201d} Klaus said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}He won't be alone,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}A number of islanders support Ishmael. If necessary, we'll force them to leave the island as well.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}How many?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}It's hard to know who supports Ishmael and who doesn't,\x{201d} Erewhon said, and the children heard the old woman sip from her seashell. \x{201c}You've seen how he acts. He says he doesn't force anyone, but everyone ends up agreeing with him anyway. But no longer. At breakfast we'll find out who supports him and who doesn't.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Erewhon says we'll fight all day and all night if we have to,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}Everyone will have to choose sides.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The children heard an enormous, sad sigh from the top of the raft of books. \x{201c}A schism,\x{201d} Kit said quietly.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Gesundheit,\x{201d} Erewhon said. \x{201c}That's why we've come to you, Baudelaires. We need all the help we can get.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}After the way Ishmael abandoned you, we figured you'd be on our side,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}Don't you agree he's the root of the trouble?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires stood together in the silence, thinking about Ishmael and all they knew about him. They thought of the way he had taken them in so kindly upon their arrival on the island, but also how quickly he had abandoned them on the coastal shelf. They thought about how eager he had been to keep the Baudelaires safe, but also how eager he was to lock Count Olaf in a bird cage. They thought about his dishonesty about his injured feet, and about his secret apple eating, but as the children thought of all they knew about the facilitator, they also thought about how much they didn't know, and after hearing both Count Olaf and Kit Snicket talk about the history of the island, the Baudelaire orphans realized they did not know the whole story. The children might agree that Ishmael was the root of the trouble, but they could not be sure.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I don't know,\x{201d} Violet said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You don't know?\x{201d} Erewhon repeated incredulously. \x{201c}We brought you supper, and Ishmael left you out here to starve, and you don't know whose side you're on?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We trusted you when you said Count Olaf was a terrible person,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}Why can't you trust us, Baudelaires?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Forcing Ishmael to leave the island seems a bit drastic,\x{201d} Klaus said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}It's a bit drastic to put a man in a cage,\x{201d} Erewhon pointed out, \x{201c}but I didn't hear you complaining then.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Quid pro quo?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}If we help you,\x{201d} Violet translated, \x{201c}will you help Kit?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Our friend is injured,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}Injured and pregnant.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}And distraught,\x{201d} Kit added weakly, from the top of the raft.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}If you help us in our plan to defeat Ishmael,\x{201d} Finn promised, \x{201c}we'll get her to a safe place.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}And if not?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We won't force you, Baudelaires,\x{201d} Erewhon said, sounding like the facilitator she wanted to defeat, \x{201c}but Decision Day is approaching, and the coastal shelf will flood. You need to make a choice.\x{201d}\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires did not say anything, and for a moment everyone stood in a silence broken only by Count Olaf's snores. Violet, Klaus, and Sunny were not interested in being part of a schism, after witnessing all of the misery that followed the schism of V.F.D., but they did not see a way to avoid it. Finn had said that they needed to make a choice, but choosing between living alone on a coastal shelf, endangering themselves and their injured friend, and participating in the island's mutinous plan, did not feel like much of a choice at all, and they wondered how many other people had felt this way, during the countless schisms that had divided the world over the years.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We'll help you,\x{201d} Violet said finally. \x{201c}What do you want us to do?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We need you to sneak into the arboretum,\x{201d} Finn said. \x{201c}You mentioned your mechanical abilities, Violet, and Klaus seems very well-read. All of the forbidden items we've scavenged over the years should come in very handy indeed.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Even the baby should be able to cook something up,\x{201d} Erewhon said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}But what do you mean?\x{201d} Klaus asked. \x{201c}What should we do with all the detritus?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We need weapons, of course,\x{201d} Erewhon said in the darkness.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We hope to force Ishmael off the island peacefully,\x{201d} Finn said quickly, \x{201c}but Erewhon says we'll need weapons, just in case. Ishmael will notice if we go to the far side of the island, but you three should be able to sneak over the brae, find or build some weapons in the arboretum, and bring them to us here before breakfast so we can begin the mutiny.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Absolutely not!\x{201d} cried Kit, from the top of the raft. \x{201c}I won't hear of you putting your talents to such nefarious use, Baudelaires. I'm sure the island can solve its difficulties without resorting to violence.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Did you solve your difficulties without resorting to violence?\x{201d} Erewhon asked sharply. \x{201c}Is that how you survived the great struggle you mentioned, and ended up shipwrecked on a raft of books?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}My history is not important,\x{201d} Kit replied. \x{201c}I'm worried about the Baudelaires.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}And we're worried about you, Kit,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}We need as many associates as we can if we're going to return to the world and make sure that justice is served.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}You need to be in a safe place to recuperate from your injury,\x{201d} Klaus said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}And baby,\x{201d} said Sunny.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}That's no reason to engage in treachery,\x{201d} Kit said, but she did not sound so sure. Her voice was weak and faint, and the children heard the books rustling as she moved her injured feet uncomfortably.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{201c}Please help us,\x{201d} Finn said, \x{201c}and we'll help your friend.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}There must be a weapon that can threaten Ishmael and his supporters,\x{201d} Erewhon said, and now she did not sound like Ishmael. The Baudelaires had heard almost the exact same words from the imprisoned mouth of Count Olaf, and they shuddered to think of the weapon he was hiding in the bird cage.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Violet put down her empty soup bowl, and picked up her baby sister, while Klaus took the flashlight from the old woman. \x{201c}We'll be back as soon as we can, Kit,\x{201d} the eldest Baudelaire promised. \x{201c}Wish us luck.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The raft trembled as Kit uttered a long, sad sigh. \x{201c}Good luck,\x{201d} she said finally. \x{201c}I wish things were different, Baudelaires.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}So do we,\x{201d} Klaus replied, and the three children followed the narrow beam of the flashlight back toward the colony that had abandoned them. Their footsteps made small splashes on the coastal shelf, and the Baudelaires heard the quiet slither of the Incredibly Deadly Viper, loyally following them on their errand. There was no sign of a moon, and the stars were covered in clouds that remained from the passing storm, or perhaps were heralding a new one, so the entire world seemed to vanish outside the secret flashlight's forbidden light. With each damp and uncertain step, the children felt heavier, as if their thoughts were stones that they had to carry to the arboretum, where all the forbidden items lay waiting for them. They thought about the islanders, and the mutinous schism that would soon divide the colony in two. They thought about Ishmael, and wondered whether his secrets and deceptions meant that he deserved to be at sea. And they thought about the Medusoid Mycelium, fermenting in the helmet in Olaf's grasp, and wondered if the islanders would discover that weapon before the Baudelaires built another. The children traveled in the dark, just as so many other people had done before them, from the nomadic travels of the Cimmerians to the desperate voyages of the Quagmire triplets, who at that very moment were in circumstances just as dark although quite a bit damper than the Baudelaires', and as the children drew closer and closer to the island that had abandoned them, their thoughts made them heavier and heavier, and the Baudelaire orphans wished things were very different indeed.CHAPTERNine
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The phrase \x{201c}in the dark,\x{201d} as I'm sure you know, can refer not only to one's shadowy surroundings, but also to the shadowy secrets of which one might be unaware. Every day, the sun goes down over all these secrets, and so everyone is in the dark in one way or another. If you are sunbathing in a park, for instance, but you do not know that a locked cabinet is buried fifty feet beneath your blanket, then you are in the dark even though you are not actually in the dark, whereas if you are on a <<midnight|13>> hike, knowing full well that several ballerinas are following close behind you, then you are not in the dark even if you are in fact in the dark. Of course, it is quite possible to be in the dark in the dark, as well as to be not in the dark not in the dark, but there are so many secrets in the world that it is likely that you are always in the dark about one thing or another, whether you are in the dark in the dark or in the dark not in the dark, although the sun can go down so quickly that you may be in the dark about being in the dark in the dark, only to look around and find yourself no longer in the dark about being in the dark in the dark, but in the dark in the dark nonetheless, not only because of the dark, but because of the ballerinas in the dark, who are not in the dark about the dark, but also not in the dark about the locked cabinet, and you may be in the dark about the ballerinas digging up the locked cabinet in the dark, even though you are no longer in the dark about being in the dark, and so you are in fact in the dark about being in the dark, even though you are not in the dark about being in the dark, and so you may fall into the hole that the ballerinas have dug, which is dark, in the dark, and in the park.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaire orphans, of course, had been in the dark many times before they made their way in the dark over the brae to the far side of the island, where the arboretum guarded its many, many secrets. There was the darkness of Count Olaf's gloomy house, and the darkness of the movie theater where Uncle Monty had taken them to see a wonderful film called Zombies in the Snow. There were the dark clouds of Hurricane Herman as it roared across Lake Lachrymose, and the darkness of the Finite Forest as a train had taken the children to work at Lucky Smells Lumbermill. There were the dark nights the children spent at Prufrock Preparatory School, participating in Special Orphan Running Exercises, and the dark climbs up the elevator shaft of 667 Dark Avenue. There was the dark jail cell in which the children spent some time while living in the Village of Fowl Devotees, and the dark trunk of Count Olaf's car, which had carried them from Heimlich Hospital to the hinterlands, where the dark tents of the Caligari Carnival awaited them. There was the dark pit they had built high in the Mortmain Mountains, and the dark hatch they had climbed through in order to board the Queequeg, and the dark lobby of the Hotel Denouement, where they thought their dark days might be over. There were the dark eyes of Count Olaf and his associates, and the dark notebooks of the Quagmire triplets, and all of the dark passageways the children had discovered, that led to the Baudelaire mansion, and out of the Library of Records, and up to the V.F.D. Headquarters, and to the dark, dark depths of the sea, and all the dark passageways they hadn't discovered, where other people traveled on equally desperate errands. But most of all, the Baudelaire orphans had been in the dark about their own sad history. They did not understand how Count Olaf had entered their lives, or how he had managed to remain there, hatching scheme after scheme without anyone stopping him. They did not understand V.F.D., even when they had joined the organization themselves, or how the organization, with all of its codes, errands, and volunteers, had failed to defeat the wicked people who seemed to triumph again and again, leaving each safe place in ruins. And they did not understand how they could lose their parents and their home in a fire, and how this enormous injustice, this bad beginning to their sad history, was followed only by another injustice, and another, and another. The Baudelaire orphans did not understand how injustice and treachery could prosper, even this far from their home, on an island in the middle of a vast sea, and that happiness and innocence\x{2014} the happiness and innocence of that day on Briny Beach, before Mr. Poe brought them the dreadful news\x{2014}could always be so far out of reach. The Baudelaires were in the dark about the mystery of their own lives, which is why it was such a profound shock to think at last that these mysteries might be solved. The Baudelaire orphans blinked in the rising sun, and gazed at the expanse of the arboretum, and wondered if they might not be in the dark any longer.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Library\x{201d} is another word that can mean two different things, which means even in a library you cannot be safe from the confusion and mystery of the world. The most common use of the word \x{201c}library,\x{201d} of course, refers to a collection of books or documents, such as the libraries the Baudelaires had encountered during their travels and troubles, from the legal library of Justice Strauss to the Hotel Denouement, which was itself an enormous library\x{2014}with, it turned out, another library hidden nearby. But the word \x{201c}library\x{201d} can also refer to a mass of knowledge or a source of learning, just as Klaus Baudelaire is something of a library with the mass of knowledge stored in his brain, or Kit Snicket, who was a source of learning for the Baudelaires as she told them about V.F.D. and its noble errands. So when I write that the Baudelaire orphans had found themselves in the largest library they had ever seen, it is that definition of the word I am using, because the arboretum was an enormous mass of knowledge, and a source of learning, even without a single scrap of paper in sight. The items that had washed up on the shores of the island over the years could answer any question the Baudelaires had, and thousands more questions they'd never thought of. Stretched out as far as the eye could see were piles of objects, heaps of items, towers of evidence, bales of materials, clusters of details, stacks of substances, hordes of pieces, arrays of articles, constellations of details, galaxies of stuff, and universes of things\x{2014}an accumulation, an aggregation, a compilation, a concentration, a crowd, a herd, a flock, and a register of seemingly everything on Earth. There was everything the alphabet could hold\x{2014}automobiles and alarm clocks, bandages and beads, cables and chimneys, discs and dominos, earmuffs and emery boards, fiddles and fabric, garrotes and glassware, hangers and husks, icons and instruments, jewelry and jogging shoes, kites and kernels, levers and lawn chairs, machines and magnets, noisemakers and needles, orthodontics and ottomans, pull toys and pillars, quarters and quivers, race cars and rucksacks, saws and skulls, teaspoons and ties, urns and ukuleles, valentines and vines, wigs and wires, xeranthemums and xylorimbas, yachts and yokes, zithers and zabras, a word which here means \x{201c}small boats usually used off the coasts of Spain and Portugal\x{201d}\x{2014}as well as everything that could hold the alphabet, from a cardboard box perfect for storing twenty-six wooden blocks, to a chalkboard perfect for writing twenty-six letters. There were any number of things, from a single motorcycle to countless chopsticks, and things with every number on them, from license plates to calculators. There were objects from every climate, from snowshoes to ceiling fans; and for every occasion, from menorahs to soccer balls; and there were things you could use on certain occasions in certain climates, such as a waterproof fondue set. There were inserts and outhouses, overpasses and underclothes, upholstery and down comforters, hotplates and cold creams and cradles and coffins, hopelessly destroyed, somewhat damaged, in slight disrepair, and brand-new. There were objects the Baudelaires recognized, including a triangular picture frame and a brass lamp in the shape of a fish, and there were objects the Baudelaires had never seen before, including the skeleton of an elephant and a glittering green mask one might wear as part of a dragonfly costume, and there were objects the Baudelaires did not know if they had seen before, such as a wooden rocking horse and a piece of rubber that looked like a fan belt. There were items that seemed to be part of the Baudelaires' story, such as a plastic replica of a clown and a broken telegraph pole, and there were items that seemed part of some other story, such as a carving of a black bird and a gem that shone like an Indian moon, and all the items, and all their stories, were scattered across the landscape in such a way that the Baudelaire orphans thought that the arboretum had either been organized according to principles so mysterious they could not be discovered, or it had not been organized at all. In short, the Baudelaire orphans had found themselves in the largest library they had ever seen, but they did not know where to begin their research. The children stood in awed silence and surveyed the endless landscape of objects and stories, and then looked up at the largest object of all, which towered over the arboretum and covered it in shade. It was the apple tree, with a trunk as enormous as a mansion and branches as long as a city street, which sheltered the library from the frequent storms and offered its bitter apples to anyone who dared to pick one.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Words fail me,\x{201d} Sunny said in a hushed whisper.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Me, too,\x{201d} Klaus agreed. \x{201c}I can't believe what we're seeing. The islanders told us that everything eventually washes up on these shores, but I never imagined the arboretum would hold so many things.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Violet picked up an item that lay at her feet\x{2014}a pink ribbon decorated with plastic daisies\x{2014}and began to wind it around her hair. To those who hadn't been around Violet long, nothing would have seemed unusual, but those who knew her well knew that when she tied her hair up in a ribbon to keep it out of her eyes, it meant that the gears and levers of her inventing brain were whirring at top speed. \x{201c}Think of what I could build here,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I could build splints for Kit's feet, a boat to take us off the island, a filtration system so we could drink fresh water. . . .\x{201d} Her voice trailed off, and she stared up at the branches of the tree. \x{201c}I could invent anything and everything.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Klaus picked up the object at his feet\x{2014}a cape made of scarlet silk\x{2014}and held it in his hands. \x{201c}There must be countless secrets in a place like this,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Even without a book, I could investigate anything and everything.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sunny looked around her. \x{201c}Service a la Russe,\x{201d} she said, which meant something like, \x{201c}Even with the simplest of ingredients, I could prepare an extremely elaborate meal.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}I don't know where to begin,\x{201d} Violet said, running a hand along a pile of broken white wood that looked like it had once been part of a gazebo.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We begin with weapons,\x{201d} Klaus said grimly. \x{201c}That's why we're here. Erewhon and Finn are waiting for us to help them mutiny against Ishmael.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The oldest Baudelaire shook her head. \x{201c}It doesn't seem right,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}We can't use a place like this to start a schism.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Maybe a schism is necessary,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}There are millions of items here that could help the colony, but thanks to Ishmael, they've all been abandoned here.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}No one forced anyone to abandon anything,\x{201d} Violet said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Peer pressure,\x{201d} Sunny pointed out.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We can try a little peer pressure of our own,\x{201d} Violet said firmly. \x{201c}We've defeated worse people than Ishmael with far fewer materials.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}But do we really want to defeat Ishmael?\x{201d} Klaus asked. \x{201c}He's made the island a safe place, even if it is a little boring, and he kept Count Olaf away, even if he is a little cruel. He has feet of clay, but I'm not sure he's the root of the problem.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}What is the root of the problem?\x{201d} Violet asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Ink,\x{201d} Sunny said, but when her siblings turned to give her a quizzical look, they saw that the youngest Baudelaire was not answering their question, but pointing at the Incredibly Deadly Viper, who was slithering hurriedly away from the children with its eyes darting this way and that and its tongue extended to sniff the air.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}It appears to know where it's going,\x{201d} Violet said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Maybe it's been here before,\x{201d} Klaus said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Taylit,\x{201d} Sunny said, which meant \x{201c}Let's follow the reptile and see where it heads.\x{201d} Without waiting to see whether her siblings agreed, she hurried after the snake, and Violet and Klaus hurried after her. The viper's path was as curved and twisted as the snake itself, and the Baudelaires found themselves scrambling over all sorts of discarded items, from a cardboard box, soaked through from the storm, that was full of something white and lacy, to a painted backdrop of a sunset, such as might be used in the performance of an opera. The children could tell that the path had been traveled before, as the ground was covered in footprints. The snake was slithering so quickly that the Baudelaires could not keep up, but they could follow the footprints, which were dusted around the edges in white powder. It was dried clay, of course, and in moments the children reached the end of the path, following in Ishmael's footsteps, and they arrived at the base of the apple tree just in time to see the tail of the snake disappear into a gap in the tree's roots. If you've ever stood at the base of an old tree, then you know the roots are often close to the surface of the earth, and the curved angles of the roots can create a hollow space in the tree's trunk. It was into this hollow space that the Incredibly Deadly Viper disappeared, and after the tiniest of pauses, it was into this space that the Baudelaire orphans followed, wondering what secrets they would find at the root of the tree that sheltered such a mysterious place. First Violet, and then Klaus, and then Sunny stepped down through the gap into the secret space. It was dark underneath the roots of the tree, and for a moment the Baudelaires tried to adjust to the gloom and figure out what this place was, but then the middle Baudelaire remembered the flashlight, and turned it on so he and his siblings would no longer be in the dark in the dark.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaire orphans were standing in a space much bigger than they would have imagined, and much better furnished. Along one wall was a large stone bench lined with simple, clean tools, including several sharp-looking razor-blades, a glass pot of paste, and several wooden brushes with narrow, fine tips. Next to the wall was an enormous bookcase, which was stuffed with books of all shapes and sizes, as well as assorted documents that were stacked, rolled, and stapled with extreme care. The shelves of the bookcase stretched away from the children past the beam of the flashlight and disappeared into the darkness, so there was no way of knowing how long the bookcase was, or the number of books and documents it contained. Opposite the bookcase stretched an elaborate kitchen, with a huge potbellied stove, several porcelain sinks, and a tall, humming refrigerator, as well as a square wooden table covered in appliances ranging from a blender to a fondue set. Over the table hung a rack from which dangled all manner of kitchen utensils and pots, as well as sprigs of dried herbs, a variety of whole dried fish, and even a few cured meats, such as salami and prosciutto, an Italian ham that the Baudelaire orphans had once enjoyed at a Sicilian picnic the family had attended. Nailed to the wall was an impressive spice rack filled with jars of herbs and bottles of condiments, and a cupboard with glass doors through which the children could see piles of plates, bowls, and mugs. Finally, in the center of this enormous space were two large, comfortable reading chairs, one with a gigantic book on the seat, much taller than an atlas and much thicker than even an unabridged dictionary, and the other just waiting for someone to sit down. Lastly, there was a curious device made of brass that looked like a large tube with a pair of binoculars at the bottom, which rose up into the thick canopy of roots that formed the ceiling. As the Incredibly Deadly Viper hissed proudly, the way a dog might wag its tail after performing a difficult trick, the three children stared around the room, each concentrating on their area of expertise, a phrase which here means \x{201c}the part of the room in which each Baudelaire would most like to spend time.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Violet walked over to the brass device and peered into the eyes of the binoculars. \x{201c}I can see the ocean,\x{201d} she said in surprise. \x{201c}This is an enormous periscope, much bigger than the one in the Queequeg. It must run all the way up the trunk of the tree and jut out over the highest branch.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}But why would you want to look at the ocean from here?\x{201d} Klaus asked.\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{201c}From this height,\x{201d} Violet explained, \x{201c}you could see any storm clouds that might be heading this way. This is how Ishmael predicts the weather\x{2014}not by magic, but with scientific equipment.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}And these tools are used to repair books,\x{201d} Klaus said. \x{201c}Of course books wash up on the island\x{2014}everything does, eventually. But the pages and bindings of the books are often damaged by the storm that brought them, so Ishmael repairs them and shelves them here.\x{201d} He picked up a dark blue notebook from the bench and held it up. \x{201c}It's my commonplace book,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}He must have been making sure none of the pages were wet.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sunny picked up a familiar object from the wooden table\x{2014}her whisk\x{2014}and held it to her nose.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Fritters,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}With cinnamon.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Ishmael walks to the arboretum to watch for storms, read books, and cook spiced food,\x{201d} Violet said. \x{201c}Why would he pretend to be an injured facilitator who predicts the weather through magic, claims that the island has no library, and prefers bland meals?\x{201d}\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Klaus walked to the two reading chairs and lifted the heavy, thick book. \x{201c}Maybe this will tell us,\x{201d} he said, and shone the flashlight so his sisters could see the long, somewhat wordy title printed on the front cover.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}What does it mean?\x{201d} Violet asked. \x{201c}That title could mean anything.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Klaus noticed a thin piece of black cloth stuck in the book to mark someone's place, and opened the book to that page. The bookmark was Violet's hair ribbon, which the eldest Baudelaire quickly grabbed, as the pink ribbon with plastic daisies was not to her taste. \x{201c}I think it's a history of the island,\x{201d} Klaus said, \x{201c}written like a diary. Look, here's what the most recent entry says: 'Yet another figure from the shadowy past has washed ashore\x{2014}Kit Snicket (see page 667). Convinced the others to abandon her, and the Baudelaires, who have already rocked the boat far too much, I fear. Also managed to have Count Olaf locked in a cage. Note to self: Why won't anyone call me Ish?'\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Ishmael said he'd never heard of Kit Snicket,\x{201d} Violet said, \x{201c}but here he writes that she's a figure from the shadowy past.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}<<Six six|5l:1>> seven,\x{201d} Sunny said, and Klaus nodded. Handing the flashlight to his older sister, he quickly turned the pages of the book, flipping back in history until he reached the page Ishmael had mentioned.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}'Inky has learned to lasso sheep,'\x{201d} Klaus read, '\x{201c}and last night's storm washed up a postcard from Kit Snicket, addressed to Olivia Caliban. Kit, of course, is the sister of. . .'\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The middle Baudelaire's voice trailed off, and his sisters stared at him curiously. \x{201c}What's wrong, Klaus?\x{201d} Violet asked. \x{201c}That entry doesn't seem particularly mysterious.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}It's not the entry,\x{201d} Klaus said, so quietly that Violet and Sunny could scarcely hear him. \x{201c}It's the handwriting.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Familia?\x{201d} Sunny asked, and all three Baudelaires stepped as close as they could to one another. In silence, the children gathered around the beam of the flashlight, as if it were a warm campfire on a freezing night, and gazed down at the pages of the oddly titled book. Even the Incredibly Deadly Viper crawled up to perch on Sunny's shoulders, as if it were as curious as the Baudelaire orphans to know who had written those words so long ago.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Yes, Baudelaires,\x{201d} said a voice from the far end of the room. \x{201c}That's your mother's handwriting.\x{201d}CHAPTERTen
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ishmael stepped out of the darkness, running a hand along the shelves of the bookcase, and walked slowly toward the Baudelaire orphans. In the dim glow of the flashlight, the children could not tell if the facilitator was smiling or frowning through his wild, woolly beard, and Violet was reminded of something she'd almost entirely forgotten. A long time ago, before Sunny was born, Violet and Klaus had begun an argument at breakfast over whose turn it was to take out the garbage. It was a silly matter, but one of those occasions when the people arguing are having too much fun to stop, and all day, the two siblings had wandered around the house, doing their assigned chores and scarcely speaking to each other. Finally, after a long, silent meal, during which their parents tried to get them to reconcile\x{2014} a word which here means \x{201c}admit that it didn't matter in the slightest whose turn it was, and that the only important thing was to get the garbage out of the kitchen before the smell spread to the entire mansion\x{201d}\x{2014}Violet and Klaus were sent up to bed without dessert or even five minutes of reading. Suddenly, just as she was dropping off to sleep, Violet had an idea for an invention that meant no one would ever have to take out the garbage, and she turned on a light and began to sketch out her idea on a pad of paper. She became so interested in her invention that she did not listen for footsteps in the hallway outside, and so when her mother opened the door, she did not have time to turn out the light and pretend to be asleep. Violet stared at her mother, and her mother stared back, and in the dim light the eldest Baudelaire could not see if her mother was smiling or frowning\x{2014}if she was angry at Violet for staying up past her bedtime, or if she didn't mind after all. But then finally, Violet saw that her mother was carrying a cup of hot tea. \x{201c}Here you go, dear,\x{201d} she said gently. \x{201c}I know how star anise tea helps you think.\x{201d} Violet took the steaming cup from her mother, and in that instant she suddenly realized that it had been her turn to take out the garbage after all.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ishmael did not offer the Baudelaire orphans any tea, and when he flicked a switch on the wall, and lit up the secret space underneath the apple tree with electric lights, the children could see that he was neither smiling nor frowning, but exhibiting a strange combination of the two, as if he were as nervous about the Baudelaires as they were about him. \x{201c}I knew you'd come here,\x{201d} he said finally, after a long silence. \x{201c}It's in your blood. I've never known a Baudelaire who didn't rock the boat.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires felt all of their questions bump into each other in their heads, like frantic sailors deserting a sinking ship. \x{201c}What is this place?\x{201d} Violet asked. \x{201c}How did you know our parents?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Why have you lied to us about so many things?\x{201d} Klaus demanded. \x{201c}Why are you keeping so many secrets?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Who are you?\x{201d} Sunny asked.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ishmael took another step closer to the Baudelaires and gazed down at Sunny, who gazed back at the facilitator, and then stared down at the clay still packed around his feet. \x{201c}Did you know I used to be a schoolteacher?\x{201d} he asked. \x{201c}This was many years ago, in the city. There were always a few children in my chemistry classes who had the same gleam in their eyes that you Baudelaires have. Those students always turned in the most interesting assignments.\x{201d} He sighed, and sat down on one of the reading chairs in the center of the room. \x{201c}They also always gave me the most trouble. I remember one child in particular, who had scraggly dark hair and just one eyebrow.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Count Olaf,\x{201d} Violet said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ishmael frowned, and blinked at the eldest Baudelaire. \x{201c}No,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}This was a little girl. She had one eyebrow and, thanks to an accident in her grandfather's laboratory, only one ear. She was an orphan, and she lived with her siblings in a house owned by a terrible woman, a violent drunkard who was famous for having killed a man in her youth with nothing but her bare hands and a very ripe cantaloupe. The cantaloupe was grown on a farm that is no longer in operation, the Lucky Smells Melon Farm, which was owned by\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Sir,\x{201d} Klaus said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ishmael frowned again. \x{201c}No,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}The farm was owned by two brothers, one of whom was later murdered in a small village, where three innocent children were accused of the crime.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Jacques,\x{201d} Sunny said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}No,\x{201d} Ishmael said with another frown. \x{201c}There was some argument about his name, actually, as he appeared to use several names depending on what he was wearing. In any case, the student in my class began to be very suspicious about the tea her guardian would pour for her when she got home from school. Rather than drink it, she would dump it into a house-plant that had been used to decorate a well-known stylish restaurant with a fish theme.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Cafe Salmonella,\x{201d} Violet said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}No,\x{201d} Ishmael said, and frowned once more. \x{201c}The Bistro Smelt. Of course, my student realized she couldn't keep feeding tea to the house-plant, particularly after it withered away and the houseplant's owner was whisked off to Peru aboard a mysterious ship.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}The Prospero\x{201d} Klaus said.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ishmael offered the youngsters yet another frown. \x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}although at the time the ship was called the Pericles. But my student didn't know that. She only wanted to avoid being poisoned, and I had an idea that an antidote might be hidden\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}Yaw,\x{201d} Sunny interrupted, and her siblings nodded in agreement. By \x{201c}yaw,\x{201d} the youngest Baudelaire meant \x{201c}Ishmael's story is tangential,\x{201d} a word which here means \x{201c}answering questions other than the ones the Baudelaires had asked.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}We want to know what's going on here on the island, at this very moment,\x{201d} Violet said, \x{201c}not what happened in a classroom many years ago.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}But what is happening now and what happened then are part of the same story,\x{201d} Ishmael said. \x{201c}If I don't tell you how I came to prefer tea that's as bitter as wormwood, then you won't know how I came to have a very important conversation with a waiter in a lakeside town. And if I don't tell you about that conversation, then you won't know how I ended up on a certain bathyscaphe, or how I ended up shipwrecked here, or how I came to meet your parents, or anything else contained in this book.\x{201d} He took the heavy volume from Klaus's hands and ran his fingers along the spine, where the long, somewhat wordy title was printed in gold block letters. \x{201c}People have been writing stories in this book since the first castaways washed up on the island, and all the stories are connected in one way or another. If you ask one question, it will lead you to another, and another, and another. It's like peeling an onion.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \x{201c}But you can't read every story, and answer every question,\x{201d} Klaus said, \x{201c}even if you'd like to.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ishmael smiled and tugged at his beard. \x{201c}That's just what your parents told me,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}When I arrived here they'd been on the island a few months, but they'd become the colony's facilitators, and had suggested some new customs. Your father had suggested that a few castaway construction workers install the periscope in the tree, to search for storms, and your mother had suggested that a shipwrecked plumber devise a water filtration system, so the colony could have fresh water, right from the kitchen sink. Your parents had begun a library from all the documents that were here, and were adding hundreds of stories to the commonplace book. Gourmet meals were served, and your parents had convinced some of the other castaways to expand this underground space.\x{201d} He gestured to the long bookshelf, which disappeared into the darkness. \x{201c}They wanted to dig a passageway that would lead to a marine research center and rhetorical advice service some miles away.\x{201d} The Baudelaires exchanged amazed looks. Captain Widdershins had described such a place, and in fact the children had spent some desperate hours in its ruined basement. \x{201c}You mean if we walk along the bookcase,\x{201d} Klaus said, \x{201c}we'll reach Anwhistle Aquatics?\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ishmael shook his head. \x{201c}The passageway was never finished,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}and it's a good thing, too. The research center was destroyed in a fire, which might have spread through the passageway and reached the island. And it turned out that a very deadly fungus was contained in that place. I shudder to think what might happen if the Medusoid Mycelium ever reached these shores.\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The Baudelaires looked at one another again, but said nothing, preferring to keep one of their secrets even as Ishmael told them some of his own. The story of the Baudelaire children may have connected with Ishmael's story of the spores contained in the diving helmet Count Olaf was hiding under his gown in the bird cage in which he was a prisoner, but the siblings saw no reason to volunteer this information.",
