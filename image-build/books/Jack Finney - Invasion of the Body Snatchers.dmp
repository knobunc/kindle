            'For me it began <<around six o\'clock|6>>, a Thursday evening, August 13, 1953, when I let my last patient - a sprained thumb - out of the side door of my office, with the feeling the day wasn\'t over for me. And I wished I weren\'t a doctor, because with me that kind of hunch is often right. I\'ve gone on a vacation certain I\'d be back in a day or so; as I was, for a measles epidemic. I\'ve gone to bed staggering-tired, knowing I\'d be up in a couple hours driving out to a country call; as I did, have done often, and will again.',

In any other business you could do that, but not in mine. My nurse had gone - she\'d probably raced the last patient to the stairway, winning handily - and now, for a moment or so, one foot on the radiator under the window, I just sipped my drink, looking down at the street and pretending, as the gentle rapping began again, that I wasn\'t going to answer it. It wasn\'t dark yet, and wouldn\'t be for sometime, but it wasn\'t full daylight any more, either. A few neon lights had come on, and Main Street below was empty - at <<six|9c:1>>, around here, nearly everyone is eating - and I felt lonely and depressed.',

The teacher had accepted their apologies gracefully, showing some understanding of what had happened; and she\'d made the sensible suggestion that the girls simply explain to their schoolmates that it had all been a joke, a schoolgirl hoax. They\'d done this, and successfully. Their friends, the mother in my office assured me, actually admired the girls\' skill as pranksters, and now she, the mother, wasn\'t worried a bit.

"The one road into Santa Mira," Jack said angrily, "and they let it fall apart." He pulled hard on the wheel to bring us out of a rut and avoid a miniature gully just ahead. "Typical town-council stupidity," he burst out. "They let this one go to pieces because the new state road was coming through town, then change their minds, and veto the new road. Miles, you read about that?" I said no, and Jack said, "Yeah, in the Tribune. The council\'s against the highway now; it would spoil the quiet residential quality of the town, they say," Jack said bitterly. "And now surveying\'s stopped, and looks like they\'ll re-route the new highway. Leaving us with one practically impassable road, and with the winter rains coming on, there\'s no point fixing it now." The rear bumper guards scraped dirt, as the back wheels lurched out of a hole, and Jack cursed and complained steadily until <<eleven-thirty|9c:1>>, when we passed the black-and-white Santa Mira City Limits sign, population 3,890.',
