            "The way they are in this world, that is. In \x{201c}Leaf by Niggle\x{201d} Tolkien presents his vision of a world elsewhere, one with room in it for Middle-earth and Fa\x{eb}rie and all other hearts\x{2019} desires as well. Nevertheless, although it presents a \x{201c}divine comedy\x{201d} and ends with world-shaking laughter, the story began in fear. Tolkien reported in more than one letter that the whole story came to him in a dream and that he wrote it down immediately, at some time (reports vary) between 1939 and 1942. This is the more plausible in that it is so obvious what kind of a dream it was: an anxiety-dream, of the kind we all get. Students with an exam to take dream that they have overslept and missed it, academics due to make a presentation dream they have arrived on the podium with nothing to read and nothing in their heads, and the fear at the heart of \x{201c}Leaf by Niggle\x{201d} is clearly that of never getting finished. Niggle knows he has a deadline\x{2014}it is  obviously death, the journey we all have to take\x{2014}he has a painting he desperately wants to finish, but he puts things off and puts things off, and when he finally buckles down to it, first there is a call on his time he cannot refuse, and then he gets sick, and then an Inspector turns up and condemns his painting as scrap, and as he starts to contest this the Driver turns up and tells him he must leave now with no more than he can snatch up. He leaves even that little bag on the train, and when he turns back for it, the train has gone. This kind of one-thing-after-another dream is all too familiar. The motive for it is also easy to imagine, in Tolkien\x{2019}s case. By <<1940|9e:1>> he had been working on his \x{201c}Silmarillion\x{201d} mythology for more than twenty years, and none of it had been published except for a scattering of poems and the \x{201c}spin-off\x{201d} The Hobbit. He had been writing The Lord of the Rings since Christmas 1937, and it too was going slowly. His study was full of drafts and revisions. One can guess also that, like most professors, he found his many administrative duties a distraction, though Niggle (and perhaps Tolkien) is guiltily aware that he is easily distracted, and not a good manager of his time.",

            "At the very thought of Tinker, Rover began to feel thoroughly frightened; but cats were soon put right out of his mind. The garden about him suddenly vanished, and Rover felt himself whisked off, he didn\x{2019}t know where. When the rush was over, he found he was in the dark, lying against a lot of hard things; and there he lay, in a stuffy box by the feel of it, very uncomfortably for a long while. He had nothing to eat or drink; but worst of all, he found he could not move. At first he thought this was because he was packed so tight, but afterwards he discovered that in the daytime he could only move very little, and with a great effort, and then only when no one was looking. Only <<after midnight|13>> could he walk and wag his tail, and a bit stiffly at that. He had become a toy. And because he had not said \x{2018}please\x{2019} to the wizard, now all day long he had to sit up and beg. He was fixed like that.",

            "Now the reason of all this queerness was simple: the oldest of all the sand-sorcerers lived in that cove, Psamathists as the sea-people call them in their splashing language. Psamathos Psamathides was this one\x{2019}s name, or so he said, and a great fuss he made about the proper pronunciation. But he was a wise old thing, and all sorts of strange folk came to see him; for he was an excellent magician, and very kindly (to the right people) into the bargain, if a bit crusty on the surface. The mer-folk used to laugh over his jokes for weeks after one of his <<midnight|13>> parties. But it was not easy to find him in the daytime. He liked to lie buried in the warm sand when the sun was shining, so that not more than the tip of one of his long ears stuck out; and even if both of his ears were showing, most people like you and me would have taken them for bits of stick.",

They put broken glass and tintacks outside the lairs of some of the lesser dragons (while they were asleep), and lay awake till the middle of the night to hear them roar with rage\x{2014}dragons often have tender tummies, as I have told you already, and they go out for a drink at <<twelve midnight|13>> every night of their lives, not to speak of between-whiles. Sometimes the dogs even dared to go spider-baiting\x{2014}biting webs and setting free the moonbeams, and flying off just in time, while the spiders threw lassoes at them from the hill-tops. But all the while Roverandom was looking out for Postman Mew and  News of the World (mostly murders and football-matches, as even a little dog knows; but there is sometimes something better in an odd corner).",

He had no idea, of course, that a giant was also out for a walk. That would have given him a good reason for going out without leave, but a still better reason for staying quiet in the kitchen. At <<about two o\x{2019}clock|6>> the giant arrived in Farmer Giles\x{2019}s fields, broke the hedges, trampled on the crops, and flattened the mowing-grass.
