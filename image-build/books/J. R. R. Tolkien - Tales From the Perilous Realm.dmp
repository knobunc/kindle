            "At the very thought of Tinker, Rover began to feel thoroughly frightened; but cats were soon put right out of his mind. The garden about him suddenly vanished, and Rover felt himself whisked off, he didn\x{2019}t know where. When the rush was over, he found he was in the dark, lying against a lot of hard things; and there he lay, in a stuffy box by the feel of it, very uncomfortably for a long while. He had nothing to eat or drink; but worst of all, he found he could not move. At first he thought this was because he was packed so tight, but afterwards he discovered that in the daytime he could only move very little, and with a great effort, and then only when no one was looking. Only <<after midnight|13>> could he walk and wag his tail, and a bit stiffly at that. He had become a toy. And because he had not said \x{2018}please\x{2019} to the wizard, now all day long he had to sit up and beg. He was fixed like that.",

            "Now the reason of all this queerness was simple: the oldest of all the sand-sorcerers lived in that cove, Psamathists as the sea-people call them in their splashing language. Psamathos Psamathides was this one\x{2019}s name, or so he said, and a great fuss he made about the proper pronunciation. But he was a wise old thing, and all sorts of strange folk came to see him; for he was an excellent magician, and very kindly (to the right people) into the bargain, if a bit crusty on the surface. The mer-folk used to laugh over his jokes for weeks after one of his <<midnight|13>> parties. But it was not easy to find him in the daytime. He liked to lie buried in the warm sand when the sun was shining, so that not more than the tip of one of his long ears stuck out; and even if both of his ears were showing, most people like you and me would have taken them for bits of stick.",

They put broken glass and tintacks outside the lairs of some of the lesser dragons (while they were asleep), and lay awake till the middle of the night to hear them roar with rage\x{2014}dragons often have tender tummies, as I have told you already, and they go out for a drink at <<twelve midnight|13>> every night of their lives, not to speak of between-whiles. Sometimes the dogs even dared to go spider-baiting\x{2014}biting webs and setting free the moonbeams, and flying off just in time, while the spiders threw lassoes at them from the hill-tops. But all the while Roverandom was looking out for Postman Mew and News of the World (mostly murders and football-matches, as even a little dog knows; but there is sometimes something better in an odd corner).",

            "It was a fine night. The cows were in the fields, and Farmer Giles\x{2019}s dog had got out and gone for a walk on his own account. He had a fancy for moonshine, and rabbits. He had no idea, of course, that a giant was also out for a walk. That would have given him a good reason for going out without leave, but a still better reason for staying quiet in the kitchen. At <<about two o\x{2019}clock|6>> the giant arrived in Farmer Giles\x{2019}s fields, broke the hedges, trampled on the crops, and flattened the mowing-grass.

And maybe he was right, and the mare, for all her wisdom, had not yet understood the change in her master.

Once in these wanderings he was overtaken by a grey mist and strayed long at a loss, until the mist rolled away and he found that he was in a wide plain. Far off there was a great hill of shadow, and out of that shadow, which was its root, he saw the King\x{2019}s Tree springing up, tower upon tower, into the sky, and its light was like the sun at <<noon|13>>; and it bore at once leaves and flowers and fruits uncounted, and not one was the same as any other that grew on the Tree.",
