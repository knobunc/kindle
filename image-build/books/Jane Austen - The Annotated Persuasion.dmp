All his sanguine expectations, all his confidence had been justified. His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.

This carefully acquired knowledge arouses Sir Walter to admiration for himself as the holder of a surviving baronetcy.

After Jane Austen\x{2019}s father retired from his clerical position in 1801, he and his wife and daughters moved to Bath, staying until his death five years later. For them and others Bath offered a combination of beautiful architecture, the result of its eighteenth-century boom, a wide variety of entertainments, excellent shopping, and the presence of many other genteel people.

This ship could be a rival warship or an enemy commercial vessel\x{2014}intercepting such vessels to choke off the other side\x{2019}s commerce was a standard part of warfare then. The navy would assess the value of the ship and its cargo, and distribute the sum, according to a set formula, among the members of the capturing ship. The captain received the greatest share (three-eighths until <<1808|9c:0>>, one-sixth thereafter), while the rest was apportioned among others on the ship, with the highest-ranking officers receiving the most per person, and ordinary crewmen the least. If the ship was sailing, as it often was, under the command of a higher-ranking officer such as an admiral, the captain had to give this superior officer one-third of his share. Because naval salaries, at all levels, were low, and the value of captured ships usually high, prize money was often the main source of remuneration for those in the navy, and it provided a strong incentive for ships to act aggressively against the enemy. Many captains and admirals made substantial fortunes through this means.",

Another reason was that bearing children was the main function of a wife, which meant men preferred a bride in a state of maximum fertility (there were no medical treatments then for infertility).
