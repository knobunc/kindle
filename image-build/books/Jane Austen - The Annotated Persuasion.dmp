In the eighteenth century cosmetics, including rouge, had been popular, especially among very wealthy and fashionable women, as well as among some men. By the early nineteenth century cosmetics had begun to fall out of favor, though many still used them discreetly. A principal reason was the growing taste for a simpler and more natural look, in clothing and hairstyles as well as facial appearance. A popular beauty guide from <<1811|9c:0>>, The Mirror of Graces, advocates such a look and strenuously denounces white makeup, widely used in the previous century. The author does say, however, that rouge, because it simply replicates the natural redness of the cheeks, can be tolerated, though not recommended, when it comes to women who have lost that natural redness. Lady Russell might be among those who take an even stricter view, though we cannot know whether she actually uses no cosmetics\x{2014}almost anyone might fall short of the mark there in Sir Walter\x{2019}s eyes\x{2014}or whether, if she does not, it results from disapproval or from simple unwillingness to take the trouble.",

The former meaning could be appropriate since, dutifulness would be important in a wife: discussions of marriage then emphasized its many duties, with a particular emphasis on those of a wife.
