Sprawling wings rose <<two to four|10a:0>> stories high, accented with sporadic towers. Additions of different ages crisscrossed each other to create both vast and intimate courts, some justly proportioned, some rather accidental-looking. The east fa\x{e7}ade was of the most uniform style, heavy with stone carving. The north side was more cut-up, interlocking with elaborate formal gardens.
