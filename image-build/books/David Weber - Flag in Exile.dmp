            '"All right. Now, if our strength estimates are correct, they don\'t have anything heavier than a battlecruiser, and a battlecruiser can pull five hundred to <<five-twenty|5k:0>> gees. A DuQuesne-class SD, on the other hand, can pull a maximum accel of only about four hundred and twenty-five. Intelligence estimates the Manties\' new inertial compensators increase their efficiency by two to three percent, which would up that to four <<thirty-three to four|10a:0>> thirty-eight, assuming they\'ve had time to refit with it. Intelligence calls that unlikely, but even if they have, those figures are for maximum military power with no safety margin, and the Manties don\'t like to do that any more than we do. So figure eighty percent as their normal full power setting, and you get roughly three <<forty-six to three|10a:0>> fifty gees for an SD even with the new compensator. If we see anything in that envelope, it may mean Stalking Horse didn\'t actually get all their SDs out of the system, and that means we\'ll have to rethink our entire plan."',

Magnificent can make <<about two fifty|5k:0>> gees; Terrible and Courageous have impeller damage of their own, but they\'re both good for about three sixty. I wouldn\'t push them harder than that with so many shot-up nodes unbalancing their wedges, Milady." Honor nodded, and Mercedes rocked back in her chair. "Furious\' drive is actually in the best shape, but she took a real pounding in that last exchange. She\'s lost half her energy weapons and three-quarters of her missile tubes, and Captain Gates says his starboard sidewall is \'iffy.\' " Her lips twitched at Gates\' choice of adjective, then she shrugged. "For all intents and purposes, Milady, Terrible and Courageous are all we\'ve got, and neither of them is what I\'d call healthy."',

His astrogator spoke quietly to CIC, and the plot changed once more. A new course projection speared out from Conquerant\'s own light code, and Theisman tapped an order of his own into the plot. A broad-based, shaded cone of green blinked alight, spreading out to port, and a digital time display appeared beside it. Conquerant was the apex of the cone, and a three-quarters sphere of amber light stretched out ahead of it. The time display ticked downward, and as it did, the cone shrank and the amber both filled in about it and moved steadily aft. Theisman gazed down at the plot, humming softly under his breath, then turned his head as he felt a presence at his elbow.',
