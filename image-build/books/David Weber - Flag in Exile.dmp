A DuQuesne-class SD, on the other hand, can pull a maximum accel of only about four hundred and twenty-five. Intelligence estimates the Manties\' new inertial compensators increase their efficiency by two to three percent, which would up that to four <<thirty-three to four|10a:0>> thirty-eight, assuming they\'ve had time to refit with it. Intelligence calls that unlikely, but even if they have, those figures are for maximum military power with no safety margin, and the Manties don\'t like to do that any more than we do. So figure eighty percent as their normal full power setting, and you get roughly three <<forty-six to three|10a:0>> fifty gees for an SD even with the new compensator. If we see anything in that envelope, it may mean Stalking Horse didn\'t actually get all their SDs out of the system, and that means we\'ll have to rethink our entire plan."',

            'Her small smile thanked him, and he smiled back, grateful once again that Nimitz wasn\'t a telepath. After all, what the Steadholder didn\'t know wouldn\'t upset her, and Colonel Hill\'s intelligence net had identified the agitators most likely to inveigh against her for the "lechery" of her unmarried affair with Paul Tankersley. They were the truly dangerous ones, he thought, for the sanctity of marriage - and the sinfulness of unmarried sex - were part of Grayson\'s religious bedrock. Most (though certainly not all) Graysons reserved their contempt for the man when such things occurred, for female births outnumbered male on Grayson by <<three to one|10a:0>>, and Grayson was a hard world, where survival and religion alike had evolved an iron code of responsibility. A man who engaged in casual dalliance violated his overriding obligation to provide for and protect a woman who gave him her love and might bear his children. But it wasn\'t entirely one-sided, and even the Graysons who most respected the Steadholder were often uncomfortable over her relationship with Tankersley. The majority of them seemed to accept the self-evident fact that Manticorans had different standards and that, by those standards, neither she nor Tankersley had done wrong, but LaFollet suspected most of them did their best not to think about it at all. And he more than suspected that the handful of fanatics who hated her for simply being what she was knew it, too. Sooner or later one of them would use it against her where she could hear it, and the major knew how cruelly that would wound her. Not just politically, but inside, where the loss of the man she loved had cut so deep into her soul.',

Magnificent can make <<about two fifty|5k:0>> gees; Terrible and Courageous have impeller damage of their own, but they\'re both good for about three sixty. I wouldn\'t push them harder than that with so many shot-up nodes unbalancing their wedges, Milady." Honor nodded, and Mercedes rocked back in her chair.

She\'s lost half her energy weapons and three-quarters of her missile tubes, and Captain Gates says his starboard sidewall is \'iffy.\' " Her lips twitched at Gates\' choice of adjective, then she shrugged.

His astrogator spoke quietly to CIC, and the plot changed once more. A new course projection speared out from Conquerant\'s own light code, and Theisman tapped an order of his own into the plot. A broad-based, shaded cone of green blinked alight, spreading out to port, and a digital time display appeared beside it. Conquerant was the apex of the cone, and a three-quarters sphere of amber light stretched out ahead of it. The time display ticked downward, and as it did, the cone shrank and the amber both filled in about it and moved steadily aft. Theisman gazed down at the plot, humming softly under his breath, then turned his head as he felt a presence at his elbow.',

            'Honor had feared Miranda might feel her official title of "maid" was somehow slighting, but the occupation had a far higher social status on Grayson than the word might imply to an off-worlder. An upper-class Grayson woman\'s maid was a well paid, highly respected professional, not a menial, and Miranda suited Honor very well. She needed a companion and cultural guide far more than she did a servant, and Miranda had slipped into the role with ease. She could flutter a bit too anxiously over Honor\'s appearance, but that seemed an inescapable part of any Grayson woman\'s cultural baggage. Which, Honor conceded, made sense on a planet where women outnumbered men <<three to one|10a:0>> and the only fully acceptable female career for almost a millennium had been that of wife and mother. And while she might wish Miranda would hover a little less, she knew her new role required her to master the skills Miranda had to teach her. It wasn\'t really all that different from a naval officer\'s need always to present the best possible appearance; all that had changed were the rules which defined what the proper appearance was.',
