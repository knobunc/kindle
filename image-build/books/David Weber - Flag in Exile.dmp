A DuQuesne-class SD, on the other hand, can pull a maximum accel of only about four hundred and twenty-five. Intelligence estimates the Manties\' new inertial compensators increase their efficiency by two to three percent, which would up that to four <<thirty-three to four|10a:0>> thirty-eight, assuming they\'ve had time to refit with it. Intelligence calls that unlikely, but even if they have, those figures are for maximum military power with no safety margin, and the Manties don\'t like to do that any more than we do. So figure eighty percent as their normal full power setting, and you get roughly three <<forty-six to three|10a:0>> fifty gees for an SD even with the new compensator. If we see anything in that envelope, it may mean Stalking Horse didn\'t actually get all their SDs out of the system, and that means we\'ll have to rethink our entire plan."',
