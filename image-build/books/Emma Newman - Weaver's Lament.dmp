            "The yard was empty and it was <<almost eight o\x{2019}clock in the evening|6>>. She was tired from the journey and feeling horribly out of sorts. She was wearing an old cotton dress that Ben had given her, with a rather threadbare underdress that had seen better days. She\x{2019}d changed in an empty worker\x{2019}s cottage nearby which Ben had taken her to after they\x{2019}d dined together. When she first saw the clothes, she\x{2019}d refused to wear them; with the ground-in dirt around the hem and cuffs and stains in the armpits of the underdress, she\x{2019}d thought they were unwashed. They\x{2019}d argued, Ben explaining that they were simply stained, rather than dirty, and needed to look used so she wouldn\x{2019}t stick out like a sore thumb. She couldn\x{2019}t deny that her hooped crinoline would be the most ridiculous thing to turn up in. She\x{2019}d given in after reminding herself not to be unreasonable when her brother\x{2019}s freedom\x{2014}and possibly his life\x{2014}were at stake.",
