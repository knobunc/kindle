Jake could peg it no closer than that because his digital Seiko no longer worked . . .  or rather, was working in an extremely eccentric way. When he had first glanced at it after coming through, the Seiko claimed it was 98:71:65, a time which did not, so far as Jake knew, exist. A longer look showed him that the watch was now running backward. If it had been doing this at a steady rate, he supposed it might still have been of some use, but it wasn\x{2019}t. It would unwind its numbers at what seemed like the right speed for awhile (Jake verified this by saying the word \x{201c}Mississippi\x{201d} between each number), and then the readout would either stop entirely for ten or twenty seconds\x{2014}making him think the watch had finally given up the ghost\x{2014}or a bunch of numbers would blur by all at once.",
