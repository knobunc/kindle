On the trip downtown Alice put her purse between her feet, stepping firmly on the strap, and used her hands to count up her friends. With Laura, Sidney, and Howard, to whose homes she had never been, and Janet O\x{2019}Connor, who had so many children, in Minneapolis, that she never had time to write, Alice still could not fill up two hands. Denny and Craig, of course, could hardly be so soon replaced, and it was hard to tell if Jim Ellis should be called a friend or not. There was no one else, no lover from the years since Jim that she could even telephone. The fewness of them shocked her, and what shocked her even more was that until now they had seemed plenteous, a wealth of friends. Of course, she had spent her whole childhood with her parents, not understanding the occasional sympathetic query, \x{201c}Wouldn\x{2019}t you like to have brothers and sisters?\x{201d} To share Doreen and Hugh? Wasn\x{2019}t seven at the table, plus friends, for holidays, an enormous number? Riding downtown on the Fifth Avenue bus, Alice felt for the first time in her life depopulated. She tried to think that Susan\x{2019}s suspicions of their friends didn\x{2019}t have to influence her, but posing the unanswerable question, to whom would she go if she had to, she saw that already the influence was felt. Her brief, nearly involuntary mental images of Noah killing Craig out of a jealous passion (and Denny because he entered the apartment at the wrong moment?) and of Ray lending out his key to thugs and of Rya teasing Noah with the rivalry of his best friend distanced her absolutely from them no matter how she regretted it. Of course, there was Susan. Alice smiled at the richness of the friendship: its length, its intimacy, its comfort, at her own deftness in handling Susan\x{2019}s porcupine periods and at Susan\x{2019}s skill with her jellyfish periods. There would always be Susan, but still\x{2014}She jumped off at the library. She rarely came in this late, and when she looked up toward the grand sunlit facade with its rising pigeons and tranquil lions, she thought it beautiful.

Across the hall, a man with a guitar looked up and scowled before she could get the door shut. She crept toward the stairs. Her own behavior was making her afraid. Surely it hadn\x{2019}t really been an emergency. Ray hadn\x{2019}t called it an emergency. He had wanted her, but he hadn\x{2019}t needed her. If he needed someone, wouldn\x{2019}t he call Noah, or some friend that Alice didn\x{2019}t know, someone who\x{2019}d seen him more frequently over the last year? Thinking of how they had drifted apart rather reassured Alice. At the top of the stairs she stood up straight. A face she recognized came out of one room and went into another, but she barely had time to remember the name, much less ask him if he knew Ray Reschley. The emptiness of the high-ceilinged corridor made her jumpy. She looked at her watch. It was <<six thirty-three|5b>>. She opened the door next to her. Inside, someone very famous, judging by his resplendent clothing and his entourage, was practicing. No Ray. Five chords boomed over her before she got the door closed. After that she knew that she couldn\x{2019}t open any more doors. Shortly after that, she began to view favorably the notion that Ray had gone home. Why should the kid lie? Ray was probably in his apartment right now, wondering what had happened to her. She should go home, too, and wait for his call. Call him, even. The door in her distracted gaze opened, startling her.

Anyway, these two guys got up on stage and sang a lot of folk music. Kingston Trio, the usual. But every set they sang two songs, \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t Think Twice, It\x{2019}s All Right\x{2019} and \x{2018}That\x{2019}s What You Get for Lovin\x{2019} Me.\x{2019} I was entranced.

Those two songs made them seem so mean, and then they\x{2019}d sing something like \x{2018}Early Morning Rain\x{2019} and instead of seeming mean, they\x{2019}d seem tormented. We sat there for hours. Sometime in the last set, they sang that old Ian and Sylvia thing called \x{2018}Song for Canada\x{2019} and I just knew they were Canadians. Denny was completely hairy, as if he\x{2019}d just gotten in from the Arctic, and Craig simply looked exciting. He could have been from anywhere far away and difficult. Then Jerry said we should buy a pitcher and get the singers, who he knew slightly, and the girls at the next table, who he kept talking about, to join us. It worked like a charm, except that the funny thing was that I angled to sit next to Craig, and then one of the girls just shot in there and grabbed the seat, so I was stuck sitting next to Denny, who looked almost normal rather than in the advanced stages of some Romantic agony. The first thing he said to me was \x{2018}I was watching you from the stage,\x{2019} which of course sounded thrilling and sophisticated. These two guys just moved in on Jerry, and it was so graceful and worldly and perfectly cruel that it seemed marvellous to me. There was a teasing sexual innuendo in everything they said that flattered us and made us laugh and made adulthood seem very possible and desirable. I\x{2019}m sure I was arch and joking and rather distant, I mean, you had to be, but inside I was leaning and melting, and when Denny told me he was from Minnesota after all, and then when he talked affectionately about his family and all the other kids, he somehow didn\x{2019}t get any less exotic or cruel, he just got exotic and cruel and familiar and kind and desirous and experienced all at the same time. We left Jerry at the bar, which seemed to be what he deserved, and went to their apartment, which was furnished entirely with mattresses on the bare floor and with their record collection, and of course Craig got out the dope and the unfiltered apple juice, and there was Country Joe and kissing on the Indian bedspreads and discussion of whether marijuana enhanced or dampened sexual desire, and then some friends came over to play music, and that was what really struck me, that friends who rode motorcycles could just walk in at <<one in the morning|5>>. Exotic again! I shook his hand in the doorway, but there seemed such a terrible lack of compromise between never seeing Denny again and becoming his slave.\x{201d}",

He smiled, but slightly, without making eye contact. It was <<nearly five|3b>> when they left the restaurant. Although still not compelling, Henry was not like any other man she knew. She walked in his aura of safety and enthusiasm as under an umbrella, certain, among other things, that Ray was okay and the murder well in the past. Although he himself did not fascinate her\x{2014}she didn\x{2019}t care to hear, for example, about his family in Wisconsin or his experiences in grammar school\x{2014}in his company, many things were interesting, and while Alice felt dull by contrast, Henry did not seem bored with her, and so the familiar worry about being good enough company did not nag her. He talked of books he had read and books they had both read. There were books she had read that he had always meant to read. While he had been to the Orient, she had been to Mexico, and he quizzed her enviously. In his talk there was a vivid sense of the populous, busy world. It was enormously agreeable, and Alice found herself kissing him on the cheek as they waited for the subway train back to Manhattan. Henry squeezed her shoulders. By Eighty-sixth Street, they were holding hands.",

It startled her, the presence of another person, no doubt one of the clerks, in someplace so obscure. Although if you thought about it, no place in this cataloguing system could be any obscurer than any other place, since at least the oldest books were arranged according to size and date of acquisition rather than according to subject or author.

She took a few deep breaths, and exhaled them vigorously, as if thereby blowing out the last weightless but clogging motes of what had possessed her. What had possessed her? Riding up in the elevator she considered the previous few days and it seemed to her that they were comprised of uncontrollable angers, desires, and fears, threaded together like beads on a string of uncontrollable hunger. When she wasn\x{2019}t thinking about Henry, or wasn\x{2019}t angry at something or fearful, she was contemplating her next meal. At night, she planned breakfast. When she ate with someone else, she wanted what they had as well as her own. When she and Susan conversed, if they didn\x{2019}t reminisce or reconsider the murder, they discussed food. The elevator stopped at the ground floor, its tinny doors creaked open, and Alice stepped out. Even the main floor reading room was about deserted. As always it struck Alice as too grand for those who studied there, too grand for term papers on Sarah Orne Jewett and Nathan Hale, too grand for anything human. As she looked at it now it seemed so alien as to be almost funny. For what cause could those eleven men, was it, have possibly died, and wasn\x{2019}t there one still buried in the walls? Not for the great work of preserving books, since as an edifice of book preservation, the library was not ideal. For the greater glory of Lennox, Astor, and Tilden, then? She let herself out of the librarians\x{2019} station between the reading rooms and glanced up at the spot where men had come once to scrub up the gold leaf of the vault, a vast and dangerous undertaking that trustees in the modem era had rejected as not cost effective.

The moon, which must have been above and behind Henry\x{2019}s building, shone with penetrating whiteness upon the windows of her apartment, into them, in fact. She could make out any number of things, including the sandals she had worn to work, which she had left on the kitchen floor while washing the raspberries. From this angle, with this full moon, her apartment was wide open. It was disconcerting, but not nearly so disconcerting as Henry\x{2019}s declaration of love. The possibility of his friendship, of his good advice, of a concentrated focus on her tangle of ignorance now seemed hopelessly remote. While she talked he would look at her hair or her breasts. His advice would be too quick and enthusiastic, too colored by the vividness of his new feelings and his wish to protect them. It was not a matter of trying. Henry would try hard to be calm and objective, but in Alice\x{2019}s limited experience, lovers were as often adversaries of a sort as they were friends. In addition, there was her undutiful self, who could think with some perspective, who could panic and hesitate under the weight of someone\x{2019}s love, but only if the lover was not in the room. She was doomed to reciprocate on the first eligible occasion. Whether or not it was Henry she adored, it was certain that she did adore, that she shivered with delight every time she thought of Henry actually saying, \x{201c}Alice, I love you.\x{201d}",

Someone in a white shirt that reflected the moonlight. She looked in each window systematically, starting in the laundry room, then the living room, then the dining room, then the kitchen. Whoever it was didn\x{2019}t appear again, but there had been something odd\x{2014}the sandals. The sandals in the kitchen that had been right in the middle of the floor were off to one side and separated. Whoever it was had stumbled over them and kicked them.

            "THE cab dropped Susan <<after midnight|13>>; Alice didn\x{2019}t dare look at her watch when she got into her place. Because of the wine, her eyes opened for good at <<six|9c:1>>, but she didn\x{2019}t feel ill, or even disoriented. She awoke knowing everything was settled. Two weeks ago, the murder had exploded underneath them all like a landmine, scattering them aloft. Now they had all come down where Alice wanted them to be\x{2014}Noah on a permanent vacation, maybe, Rya at leisure with her parents, Susan safe in her apartment, and Alice safe with Susan. The way Henry\x{2019}s presence had divided her, even for only a week, had been a strain. She saw now that things had changed since Jim\x{2014}that although she had plenty of time and energy for dates, there was just no room for someone as consuming as Henry. She looked out her bathroom window at his three quiet ones, experienced a moment of pleasurable regret, then turned away humming. She felt unusually alert, as fresh as the cool dry air blowing from the west. She went into her bedroom and opened the closet door. There was a muslin sundress back from the cleaners that she had been saving for some date with Henry. She ripped off the plastic bag with both hands, pulled it off the hanger and slipped it over her head. It fit better than last year. She closed the closet door, took clean underpants out of her drawer and stepped into them, then made the bed and turned the two spider plants in the windows, as she did every month or so. Usually she was proud of her plants, but the new, pristine bare look of Susan\x{2019}s apartment made them seem scraggy and old-fashioned. Henry, too, would probably sneer at them. She went to the laundry room and got the dustmop. Just then the downstairs door buzzed, which made her drop the mop, but she felt no intimation of danger, though it was not yet <<seven in the morning|5>>. She pressed the talk button and said, \x{201c}Who is it?\x{201d} then, \x{201c}Who\x{2019}s there?\x{201d}",

Soon, sometime in the next ten minutes, the night\x{2019}s conversation would take root. First, two or three topics would be begun and discarded as boring or worn out. This would happen automatically, a result of the cake or the newspaper open on the floor or the view of a neighbor passing across the street. Inevitably, though, something would take root, then grow and branch and exfoliate into a whole evening\x{2019}s talk. Susan rolled over and reached under the coffeetable for the Arts and Leisure section of last Sunday\x{2019}s paper. Alice smiled and wandered over to the chair across from her. Weren\x{2019}t they set for life, with steady jobs, enough money, no commitments, couldn\x{2019}t this last for years, in a way that marriage could never last, without effort, without swings in desire, or mistakes in translation, or the balancing of needs that marriages always demanded? People stayed home for passion and went out for companionship, when actually the reverse would work much better. Alice picked up the book review and glanced over the poetry reviews. Susan said, \x{201c}There\x{2019}s a free concert of medieval consort music at the Cloisters. <<Eight o\x{2019}clock|6>>.\x{201d}",

She had thought Thursday night that the surprise would never leave her, that without wishing to she would never look at Susan and not sense those two corpses in close proximity. But she had apparently overestimated her capacity for moral outrage. Homicidal drunk drivers and cheating landlords that she saw on the news outraged her more. Everything about her upbringing and education had prepared her for a grand repudiation of this wrong: Susan had taken two lives, and two lives that Alice was close to and cared about. Nonetheless, Alice knew that her adoration of her friend, and her anticipation of lasting, comfortable intimacy were greater than ever. The evening before, she could have sent Susan back to Chops and gone off with Henry, but she had not. Although monumentally confused just at the moment, she had not acted confused at all. Part of her had wanted to be polite and careful and conventional, but the rest of her had simply acted. Alice smiled.",

Once she allowed herself to think that, then there was no stopping a flood of other suspicions\x{2014}primarily variations on the theme of the power and ubiquity of Ray\x{2019}s \x{201c}friends.\x{201d} If some of them were in real estate, then why not others in locks? Who was more likely to have duplicate keys to all the attractive residences in town than a smart locksmith? Or keys to the apartments of unsuspecting women? You had people at your mercy if you had keys to their apartments. Did locksmiths have to be licensed? Could locksmithing be as profitable as systematic stealing? What would keep a locksmith honest besides a moral decision? Was the population as a whole, of which locksmiths would be a fair sample, more honest than not? She was shaking, not with fear, but the peculiarity and excitement of her speculations. What she really wanted to know, what she felt she could not exist without knowing, was whether Ray\x{2019}s \x{201c}friends\x{201d} were a knot of deviants on Christopher Street, or whether they formed a pervasive network that included the locksmith or Detective Honey or even other people\x{2014}Henry? Henry had appeared awfully suspiciously the very night of the murder, hadn\x{2019}t he? The buzzer rang and the locksmith announced himself. When he got upstairs, Alice made him tell her his name slowly, so that she could remember. While he was inspecting the door again, she wandered with apparent idleness into the kitchen and wrote it down next to the phone\x{2014}5/24/80\x{2014}Don Dorfmann\x{2014}<<7 PM|5>>.
