But Lurvy didn\x{2019}t push\x{2014}in fact, he never mentioned what he was selling unless you asked. I suspect few people did. Merchandise didn\x{2019}t seem to matter much to Lurvy, except as conversation\x{2014}garrulous conversation, too, because Lurvy preferred to run about one-quarter drunk. Along American turnpikes he had failed to peddle vacuum cleaners, saucepans, patent medicines, candy, cufflinks, hairpieces. (I didn\x{2019}t know all this at the time, but would learn it soon, gracefully worded, in his obituary.) Though he probably came through Roofing but once or twice yearly, it was more than enough to establish him as a kind of mean joke among us clannish kids. One Christmas Eve (the dishes done, the gospel of Luke read aloud, presents imminent), Davy looked out the window and said, \x{201c}Oh, no, Tin Lurvy\x{2019}s driving up!\x{201d} The bluff dropped my organs into my shoes. Worse, it turned prophetic: Lurvy really was driving up, except he was only as far as Michigan at the time. Come New Year\x{2019}s Eve (<<10 P.M.|5>>, popcorn rattling in the pan, Swede and I looking ahead to the one time all year we\x{2019}d see <<midnight|13>>), Lurvy drove up for real.

Dad studied the bones of the science department\x{2019}s hanging skeleton, name of Yorick, a short scurvied fellow gone the color of weak tea. A professor of Dad\x{2019}s told him Yorick was no conscientious volunteer but was instead a hard-luck Calcuttan who\x{2019}d been dredged from the Ganges River and been boiled clean and had ridden the black market to the American Midwest. It made a person think. When not studying, Dad worked, sweeping and painting in the athletic building twenty hours a week, unknowingly getting all the education he was going to need right there in his coveralls. It was the athletic building, Dewey Hall, that the tornado struck, <<just past eleven|10>> one heatsoaked night in September. This, by the way, is the only story Dad ever told us in whispers: how the tornado came cruising up out of the south, birthed from a yellow cloud; how it touched earth at the fringe of town, a pale umbilical rope, to corkscrew almost shyly up College Drive, gathering dirt but little else. Next morning the first thing emergent residents noticed was their street, swept like never before, and all streetside grass combed and pointed as if in praise to some passing magnificence.",

Assured laymen, all of them, with no need for fuel, while we moved slowly through, wondering moment to moment when the last spoonful of gas would drain from the tank and leave us to wait on whoever might come by. Between towns we drove west between stubbled fields, the stubble sticking up through what poor snow had blown and dried and shrunk across the plains. In no place did we see a state trooper; in no place a gas station lit from within. We drove for hours. That we didn\x{2019}t run dry may indeed have been the miracle Swede wanted. Nearing <<midday|13>> we began seeing what looked like mountains shorn off at the roots. Swede pointed them out as buttes or mesas and said it meant we were in the West for certain, a fact also evident in the presence of beef cattle and oil derricks, often in the same pasture. Swede said something about Teddy Roosevelt, her hero among all presidents, and how he\x{2019}d ranched not far from here, and how the winters had been so bad in those years that ranchers sometimes lost a thousand head in a single storm. She had read a book about this, as you might expect. It was called Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail and was written by Mr. Roosevelt himself. Swede said he was not only the best cowboy ever to live in the White House but the best writer also. He was a friend to Owen Wister, to Frederic Remington. He credited the hardness of ranching in North Dakota with his recovery from asthma and numerous other griefs. This was good information but not new to me.

            "<<JUST PAST MIDNIGHT|10>> THAT HUNCHED BUNDLE BEHIND THE BARN WAS ME, Reuben Land, in deep regret. Skittish, that\x{2019}s what I was, and unnerved about walking out into the dark. Here all day I\x{2019}d imagined the glory of this act\x{2014}waiting for a certain heaviness in the house, slipping on pants, ghosting down to the kitchen, pocketing ginger-snaps, easing shut the door, crossing some hundreds of yards into Davy\x{2019}s night\x{2014}just thinking of it beforehand slid me into the company of heroes. Sure, I foresaw some nerves. Dark is dark. But I remembered Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry, afraid that night in the graveyard. And David Balfour ascending the crumbly tower with his uncle downstairs listening for him to drop. And what about Odysseus, rowing down to Hell with a canteen of blood to slake the shade of Tiresius? Odysseus was scared, and look at all he\x{2019}d been through. Wouldn\x{2019}t I, too, defeat jitters and win out for Davy\x{2019}s sake?",

            "AT MY AGE TEDDY ROOSEVELT\x{2019}S LUNGS WOULD LOCK DOWN SO TIGHT HIS father would gallop his fastest horse down gaslit New York boulevards with the boy astraddle before him. Mr. Roosevelt was called Greatheart, and his idea was to impel air down Teddy\x{2019}s throat by their very speed. This fusion of hoofbeats, daring, and <<midnight|13>> mercy romanced Swede, but to me it spoke less of romance than of desperation. I thought of panicked Roosevelts as Teddy strove for wind. I imagined a cycle wherein his lovely mother, at the first tightness of breath, propped the boy upright and stroked his cheek and told him gentle stories of exotic pet animals, llamas and guinea fowl and allegiant shaggy knee-high ponies, or of the glorious lavender moths her brother Captain James had collected in South America, moths with phosphor wings a foot across before which natives knelt in worship. It was Mrs. Roosevelt\x{2019}s belief such tales could turn her son\x{2019}s mind to pleasing things and relax his crimping passages. At times it worked, at others not. Then Great-heart, the bearded patriarch, would rise from bed and stride to the stables to saddle his fleet charger\x{2014}return for his son, now bundled in wool and furs\x{2014}and dash away in the night with Teddy gaping at the wind.",

            "SO I TURNED AT LAST. SO I BETRAYED MY BROTHER. BEFORE DAYLIGHT NEXT morning we assembled horseback at Lonnie Ford\x{2019}s ranch. I say we. The party included Mr. Ford; the young county sheriff Mike Lanz; a federal investigator, Harper Juval, who\x{2019}d driven in from Bismarck; and three ad hoc local deputies. The deputies were skittish, pleased at this chance to saddle up with scabbarded Winchesters and go hunting fugitives in the snow. Mr. Juval looked them over without expression. Two hours earlier a rancher had found Andreeson\x{2019}s Mercury parked empty on a county road\x{2014}actually blocking the road, snow to its fenders. As the hilltops pinked it was briefly argued whether I had any business going.
\x{201c}What are you, boy? <<About nine|9:1>>?\x{201d} This was Mr. Juval.

In any case, once I rose in the small hours and walked down from my rented bed to a pine-bench cafe, which in season is full of hunters sociably forking down eggs by <<five in the morning|5>>. Outside, leaves beat past in a wet wind. What I wanted was pancakes and sausage, so I ordered and took a clean cup and helped myself to coffee.",
