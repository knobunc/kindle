There are <<four to eight|10a:0>> boxes in each hive.Tradition, then, has dictated that beekeeping equipment comes to you in hundreds of pieces, with inadequate assembly instructions that require a variety of tools to assemble, plus the space and time required to put them together.',

            "One of the greatest challenges to urban beekeeping is having bees near a neighbor\x{2019}s swimming pool. Fences may minimize contact, but the attraction of all that chlorinated water can be an irresistible force. Make sure your water source never dries up, and install screens to get the bees\x{2019} flight path high above any swimmers.Bee TemperamentGentle bees are easier and more fun to manage. Due to studied, deliberate breeding programs, the bees you buy today are gentler than the bees available twenty years ago. Breeders and producers have selectively bred for gentleness for decades. Every line of bees is different though, and sometimes gentleness is more subdued.Experience is the best teacher when it comes to judging your bees\x{2019} character, but here are some guidelines to look for when evaluating your bees for gentleness:\x{2022} Guard bees should not greet you before you get to the hive. They should stay in the hive or at the entrance. This doesn\x{2019}t include bees leaving to forage.\x{2022} In even a large colony you should not have many bees in the air after 10 minutes of having the colony open. A light puff of smoke should keep all the bees inside and between frames. There should be very few in the air when you remove the cover and inner cover.\x{2022} Bees should remain relatively still on top bars when you remove the inner cover.\x{2022} When a frame is lifted, the bees should remain calm, and should not fly away or become agitated.\x{2022} Slow, easy movements should help you avoid any stings. Being stung should be the exception rather than the rule.\x{2022} Bees should not run or fly out of a super when it is removed from the hive and set aside.\x{2022} After examining a colony no bees should follow you more than a few steps from the hive.In addition, you have to work with your bees in such a way so they\x{2019}ll stay gentle. Follow the guidelines below to keep your actions to a minimum, and to engage your bees as little as possible.\x{2022} Only examine your colonies on sunny, wind-free, mild days (temperature between 65\x{b0}F [18\x{b0}C] and 98\x{b0}F [37\x{b0}C]) so the bees can take advantage of the honey flow.\x{2022} Absolutely avoid working colonies when it\x{2019}s cool, rainy, windy, cloudy, going to storm, or just finished storming.\x{2022} Don\x{2019}t start too early in the day, or too late in the evening. Between <<10:00 am|2a>> and <<4:00 pm|2a>> is usually the best time because that\x{2019}s when the temperature is the warmest, the wind the least likely to be blowing, and the most bees out foraging.\x{2022} Always be gentle when opening the colony. Quick movements and loud, snapping sounds irritate the bees.\x{2022} Use enough smoke to make working the bees comfortable, but don\x{2019}t overdo it. Too much smoke will overdose the bees and soon they won\x{2019}t react to it at all.\x{2022} Keep your bee suit clean, and wash it often. The occasional sting on the suit will allow venom to build up, giving off an \x{201c}alarming\x{201c} odor to the bees.\x{2022} A manipulating cloth, which is a canvas and wire device that covers all of the frames of an open colony except the one you are working on, keeps bees contained and in the dark.If your bees are not very gentle, and they begin to sting people and cause trouble, you can requeen the colony. (See page 90 for more information on requeening.)So, again, all the regular rules apply: screens, fences, gates, and buildings\x{2014}anywhere the colonies are\x{2014}should be out of sight. Neutral-colored hives work well, certainly better than white boxes, and living screens are effective\x{2014}all this for ground-or near-ground level colonies. But remember the sun: Honey bee colonies do better in the sun. It keeps the bees warmer and drier, and makes it easier to dehydrate honey. It\x{2019}s a trade-off. If the screens, fences, and gates are high enough to keep busy eyes away, they are probably high enough to keep sunlight off the bees most of the day. Try to locate your ground-resting colonies such that you only need two or three sides screened so that some sun gets to the bees in the morning or afternoon. They\x{2019}ll be happier, and so will you.",

            "RobbingHoney bee foragers have a fundamental goal\x{2014}finding food. Most often that food is nectar or pollen from flowers. Other food sources can include floral food, sugar syrup in a feeder, or honey found in another hive. Small, weak colonies with few guards are unable to defend themselves from an onslaught of foragers from other hives, but they will try. Guards will fight to the death to keep strangers from stealing their hard-won stores, but if they are overwhelmed, the colony will be robbed of all of its honey, and in the process, many of the bees will be killed.Beekeepers can inadvertently expose a weak colony to robbing by opening it during a dearth, or at any time foragers from other colonies are having difficulty finding food. Opening the colony sends an aromatic message\x{2014}food!There are several signs that a colony is being robbed, and it pays to recognize them before the colony is destroyed. There will be many bees at the entrance fighting, with workers balling up together with five, six, or maybe ten in a ball. There will be individuals rolling on the landing board and falling off, and all the time more and more bees arriving at the colony. Bees from <<one|9c:1>>, <<two|9k:0>>, maybe all the rest of the colonies in your yard can become involved.Because of the mayhem and fighting, alarm phero mone fills the air. You may even smell the banana-like odor. Guards rush out of their colonies searching for the source of the alarm pheromone but will be unable to locate a typical intruder. When this happens, they can become defensive in a hurry, stinging everything and anything for several yards in all directions. A robbing situation can become fatal for the robbed colony and dangerous for people and pets in the area. If you suspect the colony you are working, or perhaps one you just finished, is being robbed, you have a responsibility to protect that colony before it succumbs. Immediately reduce entrances to all colonies in your yard using entrance reducers or even handfuls of grass. Apply smoke to every colony to disorient the inhabitants and disrupt their rush to rob. Close up the colony that is being robbed, making sure that upper entrances are closed. Seal off the front door with a reducer and grass. This stops outside bees from entering and allows the colony being robbed to reassemble its forces. Honey robbing by outsider bees can begin during a beekeeper\x{2019}s inspection, when honey is exposed. If robbing begins, close up all colonies as fast as you can. Restrict the entrances of the colonies doing the robbing by inserting grass or a reducer, and completely close up the colony that is being robbed until the behavior ceases. A weak colony can be killed by robbing bees during the melee.Bees that were robbing will continue to investigate previous openings, trying to gain entrance. If you\x{2019}ve done your job, they won\x{2019}t be able to enter and in anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, the turbulence in the area of the colony subsides. When it appears that life is back to normal, it will be safe to slightly open one entrance to the colony that was being robbed. Leave the entrance reduced for days, or even weeks if the colony remains small or weak. Don\x{2019}t work any colony during a dearth, and know and watch for signs of robbing. It may be the worst thing that can happen to your colony and to your good reputation as a beekeeper.",

            "If food is dispersed evenly, foragers exploit nearby areas, circling the colony. This is seldom the case, however, because flowering trees, shrubs, and weeds grow where they can, rather than where bees would prefer them. And as the season progresses, bees\x{2019} tastes change. Therefore, the forage area changes from day to day. To add to this complexity, some plants produce flowers, nectar, and pollen during only part of the day. Cucumbers, for instance, bloom from very early in the morning until <<about noon|13>>, when their blossoms wither. Bees visiting a cucumber patch learn the daily schedule and visit during the morning only. They may turn their attention elsewhere in the afternoon or take the rest of the day off.",

            "When pollen is abundant, a colony will often store nearly entire frames of it. An overwintering colony can use <<two to three|10a:0>> full frames of pollen to feed brood in the spring when brood-rearing starts, before pollen-bearing plants are blooming.PropolisHoney bee foragers collect nectar, pollen, water, and propolis\x{2014}a wonderfully mysterious substance. Most plants have evolved some form of self-protection from microbial, insect, or even animal predation. Thorns, stinging hairs, bitter flavor, and poisons all are used by plants to thwart being eaten. A technique used by some species is the exuding of a sticky, microbially active resinous substance that covers leaf or flower buds while they are developing to protect them during this tender stage. Other plants secrete resinous substances around wounds for the same protection.Bee foragers collect this substance by scraping it off buds or wounds with their mandibles and packing it away in their pollen baskets. Because freshly collected propolis is sticky, other bees help remove the mass when the forager returns to the hive.Propolis varies in color, depending on the plant from which it was collected, ranging from nearly black to brown, red, or gold. Also, the various microbial chemicals vary, as do the other compounds. In spite of this variability, however, no matter where it is collected, propolis is more similar than different, suggesting that bees seek plant resins with a detectable quality. The protective aspects of propolis should not be underestimated: it is active against potentially pathogenic bacteria and fungi in a hive.Bees use propolis to seal cracks and crevices in the hive that are smaller than a bee. This makes this space unavailable to other creatures that may cause harm to the bees or the honey. If small hive beetles are present in your area, bees may actually build prisons of propolis on top bars and other locations to contain the adults and keep them from laying eggs on frames.These cracks and crevices include the spaces where the boxes are joined together, where the inner cover and the top box meet, and where frames rest on the ledge in each box. If propolis builds up on this ledge, bee space is violated. Every so often, you must remove all frames and clean off the propolis from each box. When removing frames, clean the propolis off the lugs of the frames to prevent buildup.The bees also use propolis as plaster to smooth rough spots on box sides, frame pieces, bottom board edges, and so on. Sometimes they will seal the entrance almost completely, leaving only a bee space doorway for them to use.The propolis that is placed between boxes, or between the inner cover and the top box, will be sticky and gooey (at best) on warm days, but it becomes brittle when the weather turns cold. Even when it is cool, separating boxes or lifting the inner cover will cause the seal made by the propolis to snap loudly, alerting the bees that an intruder is present. It pays to keep those edges clean.Harvesting PropolisThis goo can be profitable. It is a raw material used in homemade treatments for scratches, sore throats, and other minor ailments. Some propolis varieties from South America are said to be very good antibiotics and are marketed as such.If harvesting propolis is an option for you there are companies that will purchase your collections for good money. Beekeeping supply companies sell propolis traps so you can collect propolis on an industrial scale. Installed like queen excluders, the mat is a mesh of slits, all smaller than bee space that the bees will fill with propolis to seal. When the mesh is full, remove the mat, freeze it for a few days, then bang it on something solid that is covered with newspaper, and much of the propolis will be dislodged, ready for collection. Then, reapply the mat and collect again. You can also collect the scrapings from frames, sides, doors, and wherever you find it in your hives. Do not mix propolis with beeswax because it will darken the wax, and will cause beeswax candles to burn poorly.Propolis will be a part of your beekeeping life. For honey bees it is essential. For beekeepers it will be irksome, ordinary, and for some profitable.Removing Unwanted PropolisAlways have a bottle of ethyl alcohol in your tool kit to remove propolis from your hands, hive tool, and smoker. Use a rag for the equipment, but just pour some on your hands and rub the propolis off. When you get propolis on your clothes (and you will), before washing use a commercial spot remover full strength and let it soak overnight. Once washed, propolis stains are permanent. Honey bees use propolis to stick things together to keep them water- and windproof. A cover, such as this one, can be difficult to remove when it\x{2019}s warm outside because the propolis will be sticky. When it\x{2019}s cold outside, the propolis will be brittle\x{2014}when you open the cover, it will vibrate and snap, an activity the bees inside frown on. When propolis is warm, it has the consistency of chewing gum and will stick to anything it touches. When routinely working your colony, take a moment to clean the frame rests and frame ends of sticky propolis. If left too long, the buildup will cause the frame tops to violate bee space. Also, clean frames help keep your hands and clothes clean when working the colony. Honey bees will cover objects too large to move in the hive\x{2014}such as these two mice\x{2014}with propolis. The propolis retards bacterial and fungal growth and keeps the bodies from rotting. They just dry out when covered with this material.WaterWater is crucial to honey bee survival. Nectar, which is mostly water, provides much of the needed moisture in a colony but not all of it.Foragers will collect water when there is a need in a colony. Water is used to dissolve crystallized honey, to dilute honey when producing larval food, for evaporative cooling during warm weather, and for a cool drink on a hot day. A full-sized colony at the height of the season will use, on average, a quart or more of water in excess of the nectar collected, daily.Water isn\x{2019}t stored, like nectar or pollen, but rather is added to honey, or placed in cells or on top bars so it evaporates, cooling the colony in the process.Foragers seem to seek water sources that are scented, and the greatest scented water source in an urban or suburban neighborhood is a chlorinated swimming pool. The rising aroma is like a neon sign that says \x{201c}Free Water Here\x{2014}All You Can Drink.\x{201d}Stagnant pools of water and swamp land are also attractive because of the scent, and roadside ditches with rain runoff will see bees, as will storm drains and farm animal yards. The latter are especially attractive because of the minerals and nutrients that are dissolved in the water.Foragers will mark unscented sources of water with their Nasonov pheromone so others can locate the source too.Once bees learn of a close, accessible, and reliable water source they will remain loyal to it. If that source dries up they will find another source and visit that until it, too, goes dry. It is in your best interests to keep their daily drink in your backyard. Foragers collect water where they find it, when they need it. Ponds like this one are ideal because they have an odor and are easy for other foragers to find.Try the following techniques:\x{2022} Set an outside faucet to drip on a slanted board all the time during flying season.\x{2022} Install a water garden, or a bird bath, that automatically fills when water falls below a preset level.\x{2022} Invest in an automatic pet-watering device that refills itself when the container falls below a certain level. Check occasionally to make sure animals haven\x{2019}t overturned or upset it, but this should be a nearly flawless way to provide water, without constant inspection, all season long. Be certain to shut it off when it gets cold, if it gets cold where you are.\x{2022} Put in your own swimming pool (admittedly, a significant investment).Drones",
