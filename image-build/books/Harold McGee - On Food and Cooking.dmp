            "The Buffalo The water buffalo is relatively unfamiliar in the West but the most important bovine in tropical Asia. Bubalus bubalis was domesticated as a draft animal in Mesopotamia around 3000 BCE, then taken to the Indus civilizations of present-day Pakistan, and eventually through India and China. This tropical animal is sensitive to heat (it wallows in water to cool down), so it proved adaptable to milder climates. The Arabs brought buffalo to the Middle East <<around 700|18:0>> CE, and in the Middle Ages they were introduced throughout Europe. The most notable vestige of that introduction is a population approaching 100,000 in the Campagna region south of Rome, which supplies the milk for true mozzarella cheese, mozzarella di bufala. Buffalo milk is much richer than cow\x{2019}s milk, so mozzarella and Indian milk dishes are very different when the traditional buffalo milk is replaced with cow\x{2019}s milk.",

The railroads made it possible to get fresh country milk to the cities, where rising urban populations and incomes fueled demand, and new laws regulated milk quality. Steam-powered farm machinery meant that cattle could be bred and raised for milk production alone, not for a compromise between milk and hauling, so milk production boomed, and more than ever was drunk fresh. With the invention of machines for milking, cream separation, and churning, dairying gradually moved out the hands of milkmaids and off the farms, which increasingly supplied milk to factories for mass production of cream, butter, and cheese.',

            "Milk Proteins: Coagulation
by Acid and Enzymes
Two Protein Classes: Curd and Whey There are dozens of different proteins floating around in milk. When it comes to cooking behavior, fortunately, we can reduce the protein population to two basic groups: Little Miss Muffet\x{2019}s curds and whey. The two groups are distinguished by their reaction to acids. The handful of curd proteins, the caseins, clump together in acid conditions and form a solid mass, or coagulate, while all the rest, the whey proteins, remain suspended in the liquid. It\x{2019}s the clumping nature of the caseins that makes possible most thickened milk products, from yogurt to cheese. The whey proteins play a more minor role; they influence the texture of casein curds, and stabilize the milk foams on specialty coffees. The caseins usually outweigh the whey proteins, as they do in cow\x{2019}s milk by <<4 to 1|10a:0>>.",

            "Homogenization Left to itself, fresh whole milk naturally separates into two phases: fat globules clump together and rise to form the cream layer, leaving a fat-depleted phase below (p. 18). The treatment called homogenization was developed in France <<around 1900|18:0>> to prevent creaming and keep the milk fat evenly \x{2014} homogeneously \x{2014} dispersed. It involves pumping hot milk at high pressure through very small nozzles, where the turbulence tears the fat globules apart into smaller ones; their average diameter falls from 4 micrometers to about 1. The sudden increase in globule numbers causes a proportional increase in their surface area, which the original globule membranes are insufficient to cover. The naked fat surface attracts casein particles, which stick and create an artificial coat (nearly a third of the milk\x{2019}s casein ends up on the globules). The casein particles both weigh the fat globules down and interfere with their usual clumping: and so the fat remains evenly dispersed in the milk. Milk is always pasteurized just before or simultaneously with homogenization to prevent its enzymes from attacking the momentarily unprotected fat globules and producing rancid flavors.",

            "The Rise of Vegetable Margarine Modern margarine is now made not from solid animal fats, but from normally liquid vegetable oils. This shift was made possible <<around 1900|18:0>> by German and French chemists who developed the process of hydrogenation, which hardens liquid oils by altering the structures of their fatty acids (p. 801). Hydrogenation allowed manufacturers to make a butter substitute that spreads easily even at refrigerator temperature, where butter is unusably hard. An unanticipated bonus for the shift to vegetable oils was the medical discovery after World War II that the saturated fats typical of meats and dairy products raise blood cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fat in hard stick margarine is only 1 to 3, where in butter it is 2 to 1. Recently, however, scientists have found that trans fatty acids produced by hydrogenation actually raise blood cholesterol levels (see box). There are other methods for hardening vegetable oils that don\x{2019}t produce trans fatty acids, and manufacturers are already producing \x{201c}trans free\x{201d} margarines and shortenings.",

These widely dispersed communities developed their cheesemaking techniques independently to suit their local landscape, climate, materials, and markets. Small, perishable soft cheeses, often made from the milk of a few household animals, were consumed locally and quickly and could only be sent to nearby towns. Large hard cheeses required the milk of many animals and were often made by cooperatives (the Gruy\x{e8}re fruiteries began <<around 1200|18:0>>); they kept indefinitely and could be transported to market from distant regions. The result was a remarkable diversity of traditional cheeses, which number from 20 to 50 in most countries and several hundred in France alone, thanks to its size and range of climates.",

            "Cheese Melting What is going on when we melt a piece of cheese? Essentially two things.

Melting behavior is largely determined by water content. Low-moisture hard cheeses require more heat to melt because their protein molecules are more concentrated and so more intimately bonded to each other; and when melted, they flow relatively little. Separate pieces of grated moist mozzarella will melt together, while flecks of Parmesan remain separate. With continued exposure to high heat, moisture will evaporate from the liquefied cheese, which gets progressively stiffer and eventually resolidifies. Most cheeses will leak some melted fat, and extensive breakdown of the protein fabric accentuates this in high-fat cheeses. The ratio of fat to surrounding protein is just 0.7 in part-skim Parmesan, <<around 1|9:0>> in mozzarella and the alpine cheeses, but 1.3 in Roquefort and Cheddar, which are especially prone to exuding fat when melted.",

Sounds suitably colorful: except that the French writer Massialot had already published a recipe for \x{201c}Meringues\x{201d} in 1691.
The linguist Otto J\x{e4}nicke has traced the word meringue back to an alteration of the Latin word merenda, meaning \x{201c}light evening meal,\x{201d} into meringa, a form that was found in the Artois and Picardie near what is now Belgium. J\x{e4}nicke cites many variations on merenda that variously meant \x{201c}evening bread,\x{201d} \x{201c}shepherd\x{2019}s loaf,\x{201d} \x{201c}food taken to the field and forest,\x{201d} \x{201c}traveler\x{2019}s snack.\x{201d}
What do breads and road food have to do with whipped egg whites? Early baked sugar-egg pastes were called \x{201c}biscuits,\x{201d} \x{201c}breads,\x{201d} and \x{201c}loaves\x{201d} because they were miniature imitations of these baked goods (biscuits, being thoroughly dried and therefore light and durable, were standard traveler\x{2019}s fare). Perhaps such a confection was called meringa in northeast France. Then, when cooks from that region discovered the advantage of beating the eggs thoroughly with the new straw whisk before adding sugar, the local term spread with their invention, and in the rest of France served to distinguish this delicate foam from its dense predecessors.",

Preserved Eggs
Until the recent developments in breeding and artificial lighting, domesticated birds produced eggs seasonally: they would begin laying in the spring, continue through the summer, and then cease in the fall. So, just as they did for milk and for fruits and vegetables, our ancestors developed methods for preserving eggs so that they could be eaten year-round. Many of these methods simply isolated the eggs from the air and left them largely unchanged. Water saturated with lime, or calcium hydroxide, is alkaline enough to discourage bacteria, and coats the egg shell with a thin layer of calcium carbonate that partly seals the shell pores. Oiling with linseed oil apparently began on Dutch farms <<around 1800|18:0>>. The early 20th century brought the use of waterglass, or a solution of sodium silicate, which again seals the shell pores and is bactericidal. These treatments were rendered obsolete by the advent of refrigeration and year-round egg production.',

This chemical stress causes what might be thought of as an inorganic version of fermentation: that is, it denatures the egg proteins, and breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats into simpler, highly flavorful components. The disruptively high pH forces the egg proteins to unfold, and at the same time confers on them a strongly repelling negative charge. The dissolved salt, with its positive and negative ions, moderates the repulsion enough that the fine strands of widely dispersed albumen proteins are able to bond into a solid yet transparent gel. In the yolk, the same extreme conditions destroy the organized structure of the yolk spheres, and with it the usual graininess; the yolk proteins coagulate into a creamy mass. The extreme alkalinity also browns the albumen by accelerating the reaction between the proteins and the trace of glucose (see p. 89), and it greens the yolk by encouraging the formation of ferrous sulfide throughout the yolk, not just at its surface (as in hard-cooked eggs; see p. 89). Finally, the alkalinity intensifies the egg\x{2019}s flavor by breaking down both proteins and phospholipids into hydrogen sulfide, distinctly animal fatty acids, and pungent ammonia (the fumes from a freshly opened egg will turn litmus paper blue).",

Ornithological and geographical confusion appear to be responsible for the common names of this bird, which came late to Europe.

The Importance of Timing, Posture, and Temperature For a brief period after the animal\x{2019}s death its muscles are relaxed, and if immediately cut and cooked will make especially tender meat. Soon, however, the muscles clench in the condition called rigor mortis (\x{201c}stiffness of death\x{201d}). If cooked in this state, they make very tough meat. Rigor sets in (after <<about 2.5 hours|1>> in the steer, 1 hour or less in lamb, pork, and chicken) when the muscle fibers run out of energy, their control systems fail and trigger a contracting movement of the protein filaments, and the filaments lock in place. Carcasses are hung up in such a way that most of their muscles are stretched by gravity, so that the protein filaments can\x{2019}t contract and overlap very much; otherwise the filaments bunch up and bond very tightly and the meat becomes exceptionally tough. Eventually, protein-digesting enzymes within the muscle fibers begin to eat away the framework that holds the actin and myosin filaments in place. The filaments are still locked together, and the muscles cannot be stretched, but the overall muscle structure weakens, and the meat texture softens. This is the beginning of the aging process.

The best-known explanation of a cooking method is probably this catchy phrase: \x{201c}Sear the meat to seal in the juices.\x{201d} The eminent German chemist Justus von Liebig came up with this idea <<around 1850|18:0>>. It was disproved a few decades later. Yet this myth lives on, even among professional cooks.
Before Liebig, most cooks in Europe cooked roasts through at some distance from the fire, or protected by a layer of greased paper, and then browned them quickly at the end. Juice retention was not a concern. But Liebig thought that the water-soluble components of meat were nutritionally important, so it was worth minimizing their loss. In his book Researches on the Chemistry of Food, he said that this could be done by heating the meat quickly enough that the juices are immediately sealed inside. He explained what happens when a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water, and then the temperature reduced to a simmer:

When it is introduced into the boiling water, the albumen immediately coagulates from the surface inwards, and in this state forms a crust or shell, which no longer permits the external water to penetrate into the interior of the mass of flesh\x{2026}. The flesh retains its juiciness, and is quite as agreeable to the taste as it can be made by roasting; for the chief part of the sapid [flavorful] constituents of the mass is retained, under these circumstances, in the flesh.",

They are ground together with the fat \x{2014} usually pork for its ideal consistency \x{2014} to mix protein and fat intimately.

Compensate for uneven thickness by cutting slashes in the thick areas every 1\x{2013}2 cm. This effectively divides the thick areas into smaller portions and allows heat to penetrate more rapidly. Another strategy for relatively large portions is to cover thin areas loosely with aluminum foil, which blocks radiant heat and slows their cooking.

This can be done by measuring the internal temperature with a reliable thermometer, peering into a small incision to see whether the interior is still translucent or already opaque, pulling on a small bone to see whether the connective tissue has dissolved enough to release it, or pushing a small skewer or toothpick into the flesh to see whether it encounters resistance from coagulated muscle fibers.

In fish cooking, however, slow cooking can sometimes produce an unpleasant, mushy texture. This is caused by protein-digesting enzymes in the muscle cells of active fish and shellfish that help convert muscle mass into energy (p. 189). Some of these enzymes become increasingly active as the temperature rises during cooking, until they\x{2019}re inactivated at <<130|3:1>>\x{2013}140\x{ba}F/55\x{2013}60\x{ba}C.

During one to four months of curing in a moderate brine (16\x{2013}20% salt), these enzymes circulate and supplement the activity of both muscle and skin enzymes, breaking down proteins to create a tender, luscious texture and a wonderfully complex flavor, at once fishy, meaty, and cheesy. Such herring are eaten as is, without desalting or cooking.",

The most remarkable preserved fish is katsuobushi, a cornerstone of Japanese cooking, which dates from <<around 1700|9c:1>> and is made most often from one fish, the skip-jack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis. The fish\x{2019}s musculature is cut away from the body in several pieces, which are gently boiled in salt water for about an hour, and their skin removed. Next, they undergo a routine of daily hot-smoking above a hardwood fire until they have fully hardened. This stage lasts 10 to 20 days. Then the pieces are inoculated with one or more of several different molds (species of Aspergillus, Eurotium, Penicillium), sealed in a box, and allowed to ferment on their surface for about two weeks. After a day or two of sun-drying, the mold is scraped off; this molding process is repeated three or four times. At the end, after a total of three to five months, the meat has turned light brown and dense; when struck, it\x{2019}s said to sound like a resonant piece of wood.",

            "A Brief History of Spices
The story of spices is a colorful one, and has been told many times. It turned out that tropical Asia was especially rich in spice plants. To the peoples of the Mediterranean and Europe, who depended on Arab traders for both the spices and information about them, this meant that cinnamon and pepper and ginger were rare treasures from fabled lands.
The Romans knew a number of Eastern spices but in cooking used mainly pepper. A thousand years later, Arab cultural influence introduced other spices to wealthy medieval tables throughout Europe, and demand for them grew with the middle classes. Medieval sauces often call for a half-dozen spices, usually beginning with cinnamon, ginger, and grains of paradise. The Turkish control of supply routes and prices impelled Portugal and Spain to search for a new sea route to Asia; Columbus reached the Americas, the home of chillis and vanilla, in 1492, and Vasco da Gama reached India in 1498. The Portuguese and then the Spanish controlled the Spice Islands and the trade in nutmeg and cloves until <<around 1600|9c:0>>, when the Dutch embarked on two centuries of brutally efficient control.
As spices were planted in other tropical countries and became cheaper and more commonly available, they slowly faded from their former prominence in European dishes, persisting mainly in sweets. But at the end of the 20th century, the consumption of herbs and spices rose sharply in the West. In the United States it tripled between 1965 and 2000 (to about 4 grams per day per person), thanks to a growing appreciation of Asian and Latin American foods, and especially the spiciness of \x{201c}hot\x{201d} chillis.",

The first Europeans to taste vanilla were the Spanish, who gave it its name; vainilla is the Spanish diminutive for \x{201c}sheath\x{201d} or \x{201c}husk\x{201d} (from the Latin vagina). A 19th-century Belgian botanist, Charles Morren, figured out how to pollinate vanilla flowers by hand, and thus made it possible to produce the spice in regions that lacked the proper pollinating insects. And the French took the vine to the islands off the coast of southeast Africa that now supply much of the world: Madagascar, R\x{e9}union, and Comoros, which collectively produce what is called Bourbon vanilla.",

Around 1750, the French came up with the most important advance before espresso: the drip pot, in which hot water was poured onto a bed of grounds and allowed to pass through into a separate chamber. This invention did three things: it kept the temperature of the extracting water below the boil, it limited the contact time between water and ground coffee to a matter of a few minutes, and it produced a sedimentless brew that would keep for a while without getting stronger. The limits on brewing temperature and time meant a less complete extraction of the coffee. This reduced the bitterness and astringency, and allowed the other elements of coffee flavor more prominence, the tartness and aroma that were more appealing to European tastes.',

Rolled oats are whole kernels that are steamed to make them soft and malleable, then pressed between rollers to make them thin and quick to reabsorb water during cooking or simple soaking (as for muesli).

            "Long-grain rice has an elongated shape, its length four to five times its width. Thanks to its relatively high proportion of amylose (22%), it tends to require the largest proportion of water to rice (1.7 to 1 by weight, 1.4 to 1 by volume), and to produce separate springy grains that become firm as they cool, and distinctly hard if chilled. Most Chinese and Indian rices are long-grain indicas, as is most of the rice sold in the United States.
Medium-grain rice is two to three times longer than it is wide, contains less amylose (15\x{2013}17%) than long-grain rice and requires less water, and develops tender grains that cling to each other. Italian risotto rices and Spanish paella rices are medium-grain japonicas.
Short-grain rice is only slightly longer than it is wide, and otherwise similar to medium-grain rice. Short-and medium-grain japonicas are the preferred types in north China, Japan, and Korea. They\x{2019}re ideal for sushi because they cling together in small masses and remain tender even when served at room temperature.
Sticky rice, also called waxy, glutinous, or sweet rice, is a short-grain type whose starch is practically all amylopectin. It requires the least water (<<1 to 1|10a:0>> by weight, 0.8 to 1 by volume) and becomes very clingy and readily disintegrates when cooked (it\x{2019}s often soaked and then steamed, not boiled).

Carya illinoiensis is one of about 14 species of hickories, and its nuts among the tastiest and easiest to shell. Wild pecans were enjoyed by the native Americans, and apparently made into a kind of milk that was used for drinking, cooking, and possibly fermenting. The earliest intentional plantings may have been made by the Spanish <<around 1700|18:0>> in Mexico, and a few decades later the trees were grown in the eastern British colonies. The first improved varieties were made possible in the 1840s by a Louisiana slave named Antoine, who worked out how to graft wood from superior trees onto seedling stocks. Georgia, Texas, and New Mexico are now the largest producers of pecans.',

The late medieval period and Renaissance brought notable progress in the art of enriched breads; both puff pastry and choux pastry date from this time. Domestic recipes for bread begin to appear in cookbooks for the emerging middle class, and already look much like modern recipes. English and American cookbooks from the 18th century on contain dozens of recipes for breads, cakes, and cookies. In England <<around 1800|18:0>>, most bread was still baked in domestic or communal village ovens. But as the Industrial Revolution spread and more of the population moved to crowded city quarters, the bakeries took over an ever increasing share of bread production, and some of them adulterated their flour with whiteners (alum) and fillers (chalk, ground animal bones). The decline of domestic baking was criticized on economic, nutritional, and even moral grounds. The English political journalist William Cobbett wrote in Cottage Economy (1821), a tract addressed to the working class, that it is reasonable to buy bread only in cities where space and fuel are in short supply. Otherwise,',

            "The Decline and Revival
Of Traditional Breads
Twentieth-Century Industrialization The 20th century brought two broad trends to Europe and North America. One was a decline in the per capita consumption of plain bread. As incomes rose, people could afford to eat more meat and more high-sugar, high-fat cakes and pastries. So we now lean less heavily than did our ancestors on the staff of life. The other trend was the industrialization of bread making. Today very little bread is made in the home, and with the exception of countries with a strong tradition of buying fresh bread every day \x{2014} especially France, Germany, and Italy \x{2014} most bread is made in large central factories, not in small local bakeries. Mechanical aids to breadmaking, powered mixers and others, began to appear <<around 1900|18:1>>, and culminated in the 1960s in largely automated factories that produce bread in a fraction of the usual time. These manufacturing systems replace biological dough development, the gradual, hours-long leavening and gluten strengthening of the dough by yeast, with nearly instantaneous, mechanical and chemical dough development. This production method produces breads with a soft, cake-like interior, an uncrusty crust, and an uncharacteristic flavor. They are formulated to remain soft and edible in plastic bags for a week or more. Industrial breads bear little resemblance to traditional breads.",

As the flour ages for a few weeks in contact with the air, its gluten and baking properties improve. We understand now that oxygen in the air gradually frees the glutenin proteins\x{2019} end sulfur groups to react with each other and form ever longer gluten chains that give the dough greater elasticity. Beginning <<around 1900|18:0>>, millers began to save time, space, and money by supplementing freshly milled flour with oxidizing chlorine gas and then with potassium bromate. However, worries about the potential toxicity of bromate residues in the late 1980s led most millers to replace bromate with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or azodicarbonamide. (Ascorbic acid itself is an antioxidant, but becomes oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid, which in turn oxidizes the gluten proteins.) In Europe, fava bean flour and soy flour have been used as flour improvers; their active fat-oxidizing enzymes, which generate the typical beany flavor, also indirectly cause the oxidation and elongation of gluten proteins.",

            "Traditional Bread Ovens Until the middle of the 19th century, bread was baked in clay, stone, or brick ovens that were preheated by a wood fire, and that could store a large amount of heat energy. The baker started the fire on the floor of the oven, let it burn for hours, cleaned out the ashes, and then introduced the loaves of dough and closed the oven door. The oven surfaces start out at <<700|3:1>>\x{2013}900\x{ba}F/350\x{2013}450\x{ba}C, the domed roof radiating its stored heat from above, the floor conducting heat directly into the loaves from beneath. As the dough heats it releases steam, which fills the closed chamber and further speeds the transfer of heat to the loaves. Slowly the oven surfaces lose their heat, and the temperature declines during the bake, at the same time that the loaf is browning and therefore becoming more efficient at absorbing heat. The result is a rapid initial heating that encourages the dough to expand, and temperatures high enough to dry the crust well and generate the color and flavors of the browning reactions (p. 778).",

Beginning in the Middle Ages, one of the primary purposes of pastry was to contain and help preserve preparations of meat. Meat brought to a simmer inside a thick, durable crust would essentially be pasteurized and protected against contamination by microbes in the air, so in a cool place it would keep for many days. Other dishes to be eaten freshly baked would be made with a more delicate pastry. As Gervase Markham wrote <<around 1615|18:0>> in The English Housewife,
our English housewife must be skilful in pastry, and know how and in what manner to bake all sorts of meat, and what paste is fit for every meat, and how to handle and compound such pastes.',

The starch granules slowly absorb a limited amount of water, about 30% of their own weight, and they simply sink to the bottom of the pot and sit there. But when the water gets hot enough, the energy of its molecules is sufficient to disrupt the weaker regions of the granule. The granules then absorb more water and swell up, thereby putting greater and greater stress on the more organized, stronger granule regions. Within a certain range of temperatures characteristic of each starch source but usually beginning <<around 120|18:0>>\x{2013}140\x{ba}F/50\x{2013}60\x{ba}C, the granules suddenly lose their organized structure, absorb a great deal of water, and become amorphous networks of starch and water intermingled.

This range can be recognized by the fact that the initially cloudy suspension of granules suddenly becomes more translucent.

            "Heat Thickens \x{2014} and Curdles The consistency of the hot egg sauces depends on two factors. One is the form and amount in which the butter is incorporated. Whole butter is about 15% water, so each addition thins the egg phase and the sauce as a whole; clarified butter is all butterfat, and thickens the sauce with every addition. The second influence on consistency is the degree to which the egg yolks are heated and thickened.

Europe barely knew what we now consider ordinary table sugar until <<around 1100|9c:0>>, and it was a luxury until <<1700|9c:0>>. Our first major source of sucrose was the sugar cane, Saccharum officinarum, a 20-foot-tall member of the grass family with an unusually high sucrose content \x{2014} about 15% \x{2014} in its fluids. Sugar cane originated in New Guinea in the South Pacific and was carried by prehistoric human migration into Asia. Sometime before 500 BCE, people in India developed the technology of making unrefined, \x{201c}raw\x{201d} sugar by pressing out the cane juice and boiling it down into a dark mass of syrup-coated crystals. By 350 BCE, Indian cooks were combining this dark gur with wheat, barley, and rice flours and with sesame seeds to make a variety of shaped confections, some of them fried. A couple of centuries later, Indian medical texts distinguished among a number of different syrups and sugars from cane, including crystals from which the dark coating had been washed. These were the first refined white sugars.",

Sugar became more widely available in the 18th century, when whole cookbooks were devoted to confectionery. England developed an especially strong sugar habit, and consumed large amounts in the tea and jams that fueled the working class. The per capita consumption rose from 4 pounds/2 kg a year in 1700 to 12 pounds/5 kg in 1780. By contrast, the French limited their use of sugar mainly to preserves and to desserts. In the 19th century, the growing production of sugar from beets, and the development of machines that automated the cooking, manipulation, and shaping of sugar preparations, brought inexpensive candies for all and encouraged an inventiveness that continues to this day. It\x{2019}s in the 19th century that familiar modern candies and chocolates were invented, and the control of crystallization was refined. Taffy or toffee, from the Creole for a mixture of sugar and molasses, and nougat, from the vulgar Latin for \x{201c}nut cake,\x{201d} entered the language early in the century; fondant, from the French for \x{201c}melting,\x{201d} the basic material of fudge and all semisoft or creamy centers, was developed <<around 1850|18:0>>.

Columbus carried the cane to Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic) on his second voyage in 1493. By <<about 1550|18:0>>, the Spanish and Portuguese had occupied many Caribbean islands and the coasts of western Africa, Brazil, Mexico, and were producing sugar in significant quantities; English, French, and Dutch colonists followed in the next century. By <<1700|9n:0>>, some 10,000 Africans were being traded via the Portuguese colony S\x{e3}o Tom\x{e9} to the Americas every year. The sugar industry was not the only force behind the great expansion of slavery, but it probably was the major force and helped ease its introduction into the southern American colonies and the cotton plantations. According to one estimate, fully two-thirds of the 20 million Africans enslaved in the Americas worked on sugar plantations. The intricate trade in sugar, slaves, rum, and manufactured goods made major ports out of the hitherto minor cities of Bristol and Liverpool in England, and Newport, Rhode Island. And the huge fortunes made by plantation owners helped finance the opening stages of the Industrial Revolution.",

It is the characteristic sweetener in such pastries as baklava and lebkuchen, such confections as nougat and torrone, halvah and pasteli, and in such liqueurs as Benedictine, Drambuie, and Irish Mist.

Because it is more hygroscopic, or water attracting, than table sugar, honey will keep breads and cakes moister than sugar will, losing water to the air more slowly, and even absorbing it on humid days. Thanks to its antioxidant phenolic compounds, it slows the development of stale flavors in baked goods and warmed-over flavors in meats. Bakers can use its acidity to react with baking soda and leaven quickbreads.

High-maltose syrups are valuable in ice creams, and some confections, where lowered freezing points or interference with crystallization are desired but sweetness is not; maltose is less sweet than either table sugar or glucose. In baked goods, maltose feeds yeasts and improves leavening.

\x{201c}Fine\x{201d} expensive chocolates are made from beans selected for their excellent flavor potential, often processed in small batches to optimize flavor development, and contain far more than the minimum amount of cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Their flavor is stronger and more complex.
Dark chocolate contains cocoa solids, cocoa butter, and sugar, but no milk solids. It is manufactured in a range of compositions, from sugarless bitter, to bittersweet, to sweet.

The higher the proportion of cocoa solids, the more intense the chocolate flavor, including its bitterness and astringency. Strong chocolates deliver more flavor to cream, egg, and flour mixtures, whose proteins bind to the phenolic substances and reduce the apparent astringency.
Milk chocolate is the most popular form of chocolate, and the mildest. It contains milk solids and a large proportion of sugar, which together usually outweigh the combination of cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Thanks to its relatively low cocoa butter content, milk chocolate tends to be softer and less snappy than bittersweet chocolate.
Couverture chocolate (from the French for \x{201c}to cover\x{201d}) is dark or milk chocolate formulated to flow easily when melted, and therefore to work well for forming thin, delicate chocolate coatings.

Some of the molecules that provide aroma break apart or react with oxygen and each other to form a new suite of aromas, so fruity, floral notes fade in favor of a more subdued general \x{201c}wineyness.\x{201d} White and light red wines are generally bottled young, <<after 6|9:0>>\x{2013}12 months, with a fairly fresh, fruity bouquet, while astringent dark reds may require a year or two to develop and smooth out.",

            "An ordinary dry wine is sweetened with some unfermented grape juice, and the combination treated to prevent further fermentation with a dose of sulfur dioxide, or filtration that removes all yeast and bacteria from the wine.
Grapes are dried on the vine or after picking to concentrate their sugars to 35% or more of the grape weight. This leaves residual sugar in the wine when the yeasts reach their maximum alcohol level and the fermentation stops. German Trockenbeerenauslese and Italian recioto wines are examples.
Grapes are left on the vine past the first frost and picked when frozen (or frozen artificially), and then gently pressed while cold to separate the concentrated juice from the ice crystals. The concentrated juice ferments into a stable wine with residual sugar. German Eiswein dates from <<around 1800|9c:0>>.
The grapes are allowed to become infected with \x{201c}noble rot,\x{201d} the mold Botrytis cinerea, which dehydrates the grapes, concentrates their sugars, and transforms their flavor and consistency. This method originated in the Tokaji region of Hungary <<around 1650|18:0>>, and was adopted in the German Rheingau by 1750 and in the Sauternes region of Bordeaux <<around 1800|18:0>>.

Enjoying Sparkling Wines 
In order to appreciate their sparkle, sparkling wines are best served very cold, around 40\x{ba}F/5\x{ba}C, in tall, narrow glasses that allow their rising bubbles to be admired for several seconds. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water at low temperatures, so the bubbles will be smaller and longer-lasting in cold wine. Because soaps, fats, and oils cause bubbles to collapse (p. 639), bubbliness is reduced when our lips deposit lipstick or oils from food on the glass, or when the glass has been incompletely rinsed and carries traces of dish soap.",

Nowadays there are versions of beer for people who like beer but don\x{2019}t want to consume alcohol, or want to consume alcohol but reduce their intake of calories.

Low-calorie \x{201c}light\x{201d} or \x{201c}dry\x{201d} beers have 100\x{2013}110 calories, a savings produced by using a lower proportion of malt and adjuncts to water, and then adding enzymes that digest more of the carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. The fermentation then produces a brew with only a slightly lower alcohol content, but about half the sugar chains \x{2014} and very little body.
\x{201c}Nonalcoholic beers\x{201d} can be made by modifying the fermentation so that the yeasts produce little alcohol (very low temperatures, abundant oxygen), or by removing the alcohol from normally fermented beer using a molecular version of sieving called \x{201c}reverse osmosis.\x{201d} The lowest-alcohol malt product is \x{201c}malta,\x{201d} a popular drink in the Caribbean made by bottling a full-fledged wort without any fermentation at all.

The cool wort is then poured into wooden casks that contribute microbes from previous batches, and ferments in the casks for 6 to 24 months.

The important properties of ordinary water can be understood as different manifestations of one fact. Each water molecule is electrically unsymmetrical, or polar: it has a positive end and a negative end.

This polarity means that the negative oxygen on one water molecule feels an electrical attraction to the positive hydrogens on other water molecules. When this attraction brings the two molecules closer to each other and holds them there, it\x{2019}s called a hydrogen bond. The molecules in ice and liquid water are participating in from <<one to four|10a:0>> hydrogen bonds at any given moment.

            "The pH Scale The standard measure of proton activity in solutions is pH, a term suggested by the Danish chemist S. P. L. S\x{f8}renson in 1909. It\x{2019}s essentially a more convenient version of the minuscule percentages of molecules involved (for some details, see box below). The pH scale runs from <<0 to 14|10a:0>>. The pH of neutral, pure water, with equal numbers of protons and OH ions, is set at <<7|9c:0>>. A pH lower than 7 indicates a greater concentration of protons and so an acidic solution, while a pH above 7 indicates a greater prevalence of proton-accepting groups, and so a basic solution. Here\x{2019}s a list of common solutions and their usual pH.",

The properties of a given triglyceride molecule depend on the structure of its three fatty acids and their relative positions on the glycerol frame. And the properties of a fat depend on the particular mixture of triglycerides it contains.',

            "Atoms and Molecules
All matter on earth is a mixture of <<around 100|18:0>> pure substances, which we call the elements: hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and so on. An atom is the smallest particle into which an element can be subdivided without losing its characteristic properties. Atoms are very small indeed: several million would fit into the period at the end of this sentence. All atoms are made up of smaller \x{201c}subatomic\x{201d} particles, electrons, protons, and neutrons. The different properties of the elements arise from the varying combinations of subatomic particles that make up their atoms, and in particular their quotas of protons and electrons. Hydrogen atoms contain one proton and one electron; oxygen carries 8 of each, and iron 26.",
