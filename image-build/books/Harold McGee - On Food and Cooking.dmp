            'Industrial and Scientific Innovations Beginning <<around 1830|18:0>>, industrialization transformed European and American dairying. The railroads made it possible to get fresh country milk to the cities, where rising urban populations and incomes fueled demand, and new laws regulated milk quality. Steam-powered farm machinery meant that cattle could be bred and raised for milk production alone, not for a compromise between milk and hauling, so milk production boomed, and more than ever was drunk fresh. With the invention of machines for milking, cream separation, and churning, dairying gradually moved out the hands of milkmaids and off the farms, which increasingly supplied milk to factories for mass production of cream, butter, and cheese.',

            "Two Protein Classes: Curd and Whey There are dozens of different proteins floating around in milk. When it comes to cooking behavior, fortunately, we can reduce the protein population to two basic groups: Little Miss Muffet\x{2019}s curds and whey. The two groups are distinguished by their reaction to acids. The handful of curd proteins, the caseins, clump together in acid conditions and form a solid mass, or coagulate, while all the rest, the whey proteins, remain suspended in the liquid. It\x{2019}s the clumping nature of the caseins that makes possible most thickened milk products, from yogurt to cheese. The whey proteins play a more minor role; they influence the texture of casein curds, and stabilize the milk foams on specialty coffees.

            "Homogenization Left to itself, fresh whole milk naturally separates into two phases: fat globules clump together and rise to form the cream layer, leaving a fat-depleted phase below (p. 18). The treatment called homogenization was developed in France <<around 1900|18:0>> to prevent creaming and keep the milk fat evenly \x{2014} homogeneously \x{2014} dispersed. It involves pumping hot milk at high pressure through very small nozzles, where the turbulence tears the fat globules apart into smaller ones; their average diameter falls from 4 micrometers to about 1. The sudden increase in globule numbers causes a proportional increase in their surface area, which the original globule membranes are insufficient to cover. The naked fat surface attracts casein particles, which stick and create an artificial coat (nearly a third of the milk\x{2019}s casein ends up on the globules). The casein particles both weigh the fat globules down and interfere with their usual clumping: and so the fat remains evenly dispersed in the milk. Milk is always pasteurized just before or simultaneously with homogenization to prevent its enzymes from attacking the momentarily unprotected fat globules and producing rancid flavors.",

According to business legend, the American Gail Borden reinvented evaporated milk <<around 1853|18:0>> after a rough transatlantic crossing that sickened the ship\x{2019}s cows. Borden added large amounts of sugar to keep his concentrated milk from spoiling.

            "The Rise of Vegetable Margarine Modern margarine is now made not from solid animal fats, but from normally liquid vegetable oils. This shift was made possible <<around 1900|18:0>> by German and French chemists who developed the process of hydrogenation, which hardens liquid oils by altering the structures of their fatty acids (p. 801). Hydrogenation allowed manufacturers to make a butter substitute that spreads easily even at refrigerator temperature, where butter is unusably hard. An unanticipated bonus for the shift to vegetable oils was the medical discovery after World War II that the saturated fats typical of meats and dairy products raise blood cholesterol levels and the risk of heart disease. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fat in hard stick margarine is only 1 to 3, where in butter it is 2 to 1. Recently, however, scientists have found that trans fatty acids produced by hydrogenation actually raise blood cholesterol levels (see box). There are other methods for hardening vegetable oils that don\x{2019}t produce trans fatty acids, and manufacturers are already producing \x{201c}trans free\x{201d} margarines and shortenings.",

These widely dispersed communities developed their cheesemaking techniques independently to suit their local landscape, climate, materials, and markets. Small, perishable soft cheeses, often made from the milk of a few household animals, were consumed locally and quickly and could only be sent to nearby towns. Large hard cheeses required the milk of many animals and were often made by cooperatives (the Gruy\x{e8}re fruiteries began <<around 1200|18:0>>); they kept indefinitely and could be transported to market from distant regions. The result was a remarkable diversity of traditional cheeses, which number from 20 to 50 in most countries and several hundred in France alone, thanks to its size and range of climates.",

            "Cheese Melting What is going on when we melt a piece of cheese? Essentially two things.

Then at higher temperatures \x{2014} around 130\x{ba}F/55\x{ba}C for soft cheeses, 150\x{ba}F/65\x{ba}C for Cheddar and Swiss types, 180\x{ba}F/82\x{ba}C for Parmesan and pecorino \x{2014} enough of the bonds holding the casein proteins together are broken that the protein matrix collapses, and the piece sags and flows as a thick liquid. Melting behavior is largely determined by water content. Low-moisture hard cheeses require more heat to melt because their protein molecules are more concentrated and so more intimately bonded to each other; and when melted, they flow relatively little. Separate pieces of grated moist mozzarella will melt together, while flecks of Parmesan remain separate. With continued exposure to high heat, moisture will evaporate from the liquefied cheese, which gets progressively stiffer and eventually resolidifies. Most cheeses will leak some melted fat, and extensive breakdown of the protein fabric accentuates this in high-fat cheeses. The ratio of fat to surrounding protein is just 0.7 in part-skim Parmesan, <<around 1|9:0>> in mozzarella and the alpine cheeses, but 1.3 in Roquefort and Cheddar, which are especially prone to exuding fat when melted.",

So, just as they did for milk and for fruits and vegetables, our ancestors developed methods for preserving eggs so that they could be eaten year-round. Many of these methods simply isolated the eggs from the air and left them largely unchanged. Water saturated with lime, or calcium hydroxide, is alkaline enough to discourage bacteria, and coats the egg shell with a thin layer of calcium carbonate that partly seals the shell pores. Oiling with linseed oil apparently began on Dutch farms <<around 1800|18:0>>. The early 20th century brought the use of waterglass, or a solution of sodium silicate, which again seals the shell pores and is bactericidal. These treatments were rendered obsolete by the advent of refrigeration and year-round egg production.',

            "Creating Clarity, Color, and Flavor The real transforming agent in pidan is the alkaline material, which gradually raises the already alkaline egg from a pH of <<around 9 to 12|10>> or more. This chemical stress causes what might be thought of as an inorganic version of fermentation: that is, it denatures the egg proteins, and breaks down some of the complex, flavorless proteins and fats into simpler, highly flavorful components. The disruptively high pH forces the egg proteins to unfold, and at the same time confers on them a strongly repelling negative charge. The dissolved salt, with its positive and negative ions, moderates the repulsion enough that the fine strands of widely dispersed albumen proteins are able to bond into a solid yet transparent gel. In the yolk, the same extreme conditions destroy the organized structure of the yolk spheres, and with it the usual graininess; the yolk proteins coagulate into a creamy mass. The extreme alkalinity also browns the albumen by accelerating the reaction between the proteins and the trace of glucose (see p. 89), and it greens the yolk by encouraging the formation of ferrous sulfide throughout the yolk, not just at its surface (as in hard-cooked eggs; see p. 89). Finally, the alkalinity intensifies the egg\x{2019}s flavor by breaking down both proteins and phospholipids into hydrogen sulfide, distinctly animal fatty acids, and pungent ammonia (the fumes from a freshly opened egg will turn litmus paper blue).",

Soon, however, the muscles clench in the condition called rigor mortis (\x{201c}stiffness of death\x{201d}). If cooked in this state, they make very tough meat. Rigor sets in (after <<about 2.5 hours|1>> in the steer, 1 hour or less in lamb, pork, and chicken) when the muscle fibers run out of energy, their control systems fail and trigger a contracting movement of the protein filaments, and the filaments lock in place. Carcasses are hung up in such a way that most of their muscles are stretched by gravity, so that the protein filaments can\x{2019}t contract and overlap very much; otherwise the filaments bunch up and bond very tightly and the meat becomes exceptionally tough. Eventually, protein-digesting enzymes within the muscle fibers begin to eat away the framework that holds the actin and myosin filaments in place. The filaments are still locked together, and the muscles cannot be stretched, but the overall muscle structure weakens, and the meat texture softens. This is the beginning of the aging process.

The others were unpredictable mineral impurities in the rock, sea, and vegetable salts originally used for curing. One of these, potassium nitrate (KNO3), was discovered during the Middle Ages and named saltpeter because it was found as a salt-like crystalline outgrowth on rocks. In the 16th or 17th century, it was found to brighten meat color and improve its flavor, safety, and storage life. <<Around 1900|9u>>, German chemists discovered that during the cure certain salt-tolerant bacteria transform a small portion of the nitrate into nitrite (NO2), and that nitrite rather than nitrate is the true active ingredient. Once this was known, producers could eliminate saltpeter from the curing mixture and replace it with much smaller doses of pure nitrite. This is now the rule except in the production of traditional dry-cured hams and bacons, where prolonged ripening benefits from the ongoing bacterial production of nitrite from nitrate.',

Two characteristics of fish add to the trickiness of cooking them well. First, whole fish and fillets are thick at the center and taper down to nothing at the edges: so thin areas overcook while the thick areas cook through. And second, fish vary widely in their chemical and physical condition, and therefore in their response to heat. The fillets of cod, bluefish, and other species often suffer from some degree of gaping, separations of muscle layers through which heat penetrates more rapidly. Such fish as tuna, swordfish, and shark have very dense flesh, crammed full of protein (around 25%), which absorbs a lot of heat before its temperature rises; less active members of the cod family get by with less protein (<<15\x{2013}16|5a:0>>%) in their muscle, and cook more rapidly.

Colorless quince slices cooked in a sugar syrup lose their astringency and develop a ruby-like color and translucency. Quinces and certain varieties of pear are especially rich in phenolic chemicals, including aggregates (proanthocyanidins) of from <<2 to 20|10a:0>> anthocyanin-like subunits. The aggregates are the right size to cross-link and coagulate proteins, so they feel astringent in our mouth. When these fruits are cooked for a long time, the combination of heat and acidity causes the subunits to break off one by one; and then oxygen from the air reacts with the subunits to form true anthocyanins: so the tannic, pale fruits become more gentle-tasting and anything from pale pink to deep red.

The potatoes are cut into thin cross sections around 1.5 mm thick, the equivalent of just <<10\x{2013}12|5a:1>> potato cells, then deep-fried until dry and crisp. There are two basic ways of frying chips, and they produce two different textures. Cooking at a fairly constant and high oil temperature, around 350\x{ba}F/175\x{ba}C, heats the slices so rapidly that the starch granules and cell walls have little chance to absorb any moisture before they\x{2019}re desiccated and done, in 3\x{2013}4 minutes. The texture is therefore delicately crisp and fine-grained. Most packaged chips have this texture because they\x{2019}re made in a continuous processor whose oil temperature stays high. On the other hand, cooking at an initially low and slowly increasing temperature, beginning around 250\x{ba}F/120\x{ba}C and reaching 350\x{ba}F/175\x{ba}C in 8\x{2013}10 minutes, gives the starch granules time to absorb water, exude dissolved starch into the potato cell walls, and reinforce and glue them together. The result is a much harder, crunchier chip. This is the texture created by \x{201c}kettle frying,\x{201d} or cooking the slices by the batch in a vessel like an ordinary pot. The temperature of the preheated kettle drops immediately when a batch of cold potatoes is dumped in, so the potatoes cook in oil whose temperature starts low and rises slowly as the potatoes\x{2019} moisture is cooked out and the heater catches up.",

As the season progresses, the rhizomes become depleted of stored energy, and sugar levels in the shoots decline. Once harvested, the actively growing shoot continues to consume its sugars, and does so more rapidly than any other common vegetable. Its flavor flattens out; it loses its juiciness, and it becomes increasingly fibrous from the base up. These changes are especially rapid in the first 24 hours after harvest, and are accelerated by warmth and light. Moisture and sugar losses can be partly remedied by soaking the spears in dilute sugar water (5\x{2013}10%, or <<5\x{2013}10|5a:1>> gm per 100 ml/1\x{2013}2 teaspoons per half-cup) before cooking.

Most of them extract between 20 and 25% of the bean\x{2019}s substance, and produce a cup containing somewhere between 1.3% and5.5% bean solids by weight. The facing chart places some of the major styles in relation to each other. Standard American filter-drip coffee is the lightest, and Italian espresso the strongest. The initial proportion of coffee to water is <<1:15|2>> for American, 1:5 for espresso. One clear lesson from the chart is that it\x{2019}s always best to use too much coffee rather than too little: a strong but balanced cup can be diluted with hot water and remain balanced, but a weak cup can\x{2019}t be improved. This principle can help avoid problems caused by the fact that cup and coffee scoop measures vary, and that scoops themselves are a very approximate measure (one 2-tablespoon/30-ml scoop may deliver anywhere from 8 to 12 gm coffee, depending on grind and packing).",

Noodles extruded through modern low-friction Teflon dies end up with a glossier, smoother surface, with fewer pores and cracks through which hot water can leak in and dissolved starch can leak out.

            "White and Yellow Noodles Salted white noodles arose in northern China and are now most widely known in their Japanese version, udon (below). Yellow noodles, which are made with alkaline salts, appear to have originated in southeast China sometime before <<1600|9c:0>>, and then spread with Chinese migrants to Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The yellowness of the traditional noodles (modern ones are sometimes colored with egg yolks) is caused by phenolic compounds in the flour called flavones, which are normally colorless but become yellow in alkaline conditions. The flavones are especially concentrated in the bran and germ, so less refined flours develop a deeper color. Because they\x{2019}re based on harder wheats, southern yellow noodles have a firmer texture than white salted noodles, and alkalinity (pH <<9\x{2013}11|5a:0>>, the equivalent of old egg whites) increases this firmness. The alkaline salts (sodium and potassium carbonates at 0.5\x{2013}1% of noodle weight) also cause the noodles to take longer to cook and absorb more water, and they contribute a characteristic aroma and taste.",

            "Lager From the times of Egypt and Sumeria to the Middle Ages, brewers made beer without much control over the temperature of fermentation, and with yeasts that grew at the surface of the liquid. The beer fermented in a few days, and it was consumed within days or weeks. Sometime <<around 1400|18:0>>, in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, there evolved a new kind of beer. It was fermented in cool caves over the period of a week or more, and with a special yeast that grew below the surface of the liquid. Then it was packed in ice for several months before it was drawn off the yeast sediment for drinking. The cool, slow fermentation gave the beer a distinctive, relatively mild flavor, and the cold temperature and long settling time produced a sparkling-clear appearance. This lager beer (from the German lagern, \x{201c}to store,\x{201d} \x{201c}to lay down\x{201d}) remained distinctly Bavarian until the 1840s, when the special yeast and techniques were taken to Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, to Copenhagen, and to the United States, and became the prototype of most modern beers. England and Belgium are the only major producers that still brew most of their beer in the original way, at warm temperatures and with top-fermenting yeasts.",

This was malted barley roasted very dark, and used in small amounts only to adjust the color and flavor of ales and beers, not to provide fermentable sugars. Patent and pale malts made it possible to produce a range of dark beers with a combination of light, largely fermentable malt and very dark coloring malt.

            "The most unusual Belgian beers are the lambics. The hallmark of brewing traditional lambic is a spontaneous and months-long fermentation of the wort in wood barrels. Once the wort has been boiled, it is cooled in a broad open tank, where it picks up microbes from the ambient air. The cool wort is then poured into wooden casks that contribute microbes from previous batches, and ferments in the casks for 6 to 24 months. The fermentation proceeds in four stages: an initial growth of wild yeasts (Kloeckera and others) and various bacteria (Enterobacter and others) that takes 10\x{2013}15 days and produces acetic acid and vegetable aromas; the main alcohol-producing growth of Saccharomyces yeasts, which dominate for several months; at <<6|9m:0>> to 8 months, the acid-producing growth of lactic and acetic bacteria (Pediococcus, Acetobacter); and finally the growth of Brettanomyces yeasts, which produce a range of fruity, spicy, smoky, and animal aromas (see box, p. 730). The resulting brew may then be blended with other lambics and aged to make gueuze, with a wine-like acidity and complexity; or blended with some ordinary top-fermented ale and flavored with sugar and coriander to make faro; or re-fermented in the barrel for four to six months with fresh whole cherries or raspberries, to make kriek and framboise.",

It\x{2019}s distilled twice in pot stills to about 70% alcohol, and has a strong, distinctive flavor. Another, grain whisky, is less flavorful and less costly; it is made in the lowlands from various cereals and just a small portion (<<10\x{2013}15|5a:0>>%) of malted barley to convert their starches into sugars, and distilled in a continuous still to a neutral 95% alcohol. The third and most common is a blend of malt and grain whiskies, with grain whisky accounting for 40\x{2013}70%. Such blending began in the 1860s for economic reasons, and turned out to produce a milder, more widely appealing drink just in time to replace brandy when the insect scourge phylloxera devastated European vineyards in the 1870s and 1880s. This is when Scotch developed its international reputation.

Absinthe developed a reputation for inducing convulsions and insanity, and was therefore outlawed in many countries <<around 1910|18:1>>, and replaced by simpler anise-flavored spirits. Whatever toxicity wormwood had for the heavy drinker was probably exacerbated by absinthe\x{2019}s high alcohol content, around 68% and nearly double the strength of most spirits. Absinthe remains legal in a number of countries and has recently enjoyed a modest and moderate revival.",

These are known as the Maillard reactions, after Louis Camille Maillard, a French physician, who discovered and described them <<around 1910|18:0>>. The sequence begins with the reaction of a carbohydrate molecule (a free sugar or one bound up in starch; glucose and fructose are more reactive than table sugar) and an amino acid (free or part of a protein chain). An unstable intermediate structure is formed, and this then undergoes further changes, producing hundreds of different by-products. Again, a brown coloration and full, intense flavor result. Maillard flavors are more complex and meaty than caramelized flavors, because the involvement of the amino acids adds nitrogen and sulfur atoms to the mix of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and produces new families of molecules and new aromatic dimensions (see illustration below, and box, p. 779).',

Each water molecule is electrically unsymmetrical, or polar: it has a positive end and a negative end. This is because the oxygen atom exerts a stronger pull than the hydrogen atoms on the electrons they share, and because the hydrogen atoms project from one side of the oxygen to form a kind of V shape: so there\x{2019}s an oxygen end and a hydrogen end to the water molecule, and the oxygen end is more negative than the hydrogen end. This polarity means that the negative oxygen on one water molecule feels an electrical attraction to the positive hydrogens on other water molecules. When this attraction brings the two molecules closer to each other and holds them there, it\x{2019}s called a hydrogen bond. The molecules in ice and liquid water are participating in from <<one to four|10a:0>> hydrogen bonds at any given moment. However, the motion of the molecules in the liquid is forceful enough to overcome the strength of hydrogen bonds and break them: so the hydrogen bonds in liquid water are fleeting, and are constantly being formed and broken.",
