            "Pepper and ginger pungency burns only the mouth or whatever body surface the food touches.
White and black pepper, green peppercorns, chillis (many varieties of red \x{201c}peppers,\x{201d} cayenne, paprika, pimientos), and ginger burn the mouth. Pepper pungency survives cooking.
Mustard pungency burns the nose and lungs as well as the mouth. It\x{2019}s volatile and is carried on the breath and through the air. Cooking diminishes mustard pungency.
Mustard seeds and their various preparations, horseradish root, and Japanese wasabi root all sting the nose and lungs.
Wasabi powder is usually horseradish powder combined with green food coloring. Authentic fresh wasabi root is available in Japanese groceries; grate it just before using.
To avoid a coughing fit from excessive mustard pungency, or to recover from <<one|9c:0>>, inhale only through the nose and exhale only through the mouth.
Sichuan pepper pungency is a buzzing, numbing sensation in the mouth, caused by Sichuan peppercorns, Japanese sansho powder and leaves, and Australian mountain pepper. It survives cooking.

All pungent flavorings can irritate the eyes and lungs when they\x{2019}re heated during cooking or dishwashing.",
