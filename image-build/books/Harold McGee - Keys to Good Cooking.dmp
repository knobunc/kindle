            "Pepper and ginger pungency burns only the mouth or whatever body surface the food touches.
White and black pepper, green peppercorns, chillis (many varieties of red \x{201c}peppers,\x{201d} cayenne, paprika, pimientos), and ginger burn the mouth. Pepper pungency survives cooking.
Mustard pungency burns the nose and lungs as well as the mouth. It\x{2019}s volatile and is carried on the breath and through the air. Cooking diminishes mustard pungency.
Mustard seeds and their various preparations, horseradish root, and Japanese wasabi root all sting the nose and lungs.
Wasabi powder is usually horseradish powder combined with green food coloring. Authentic fresh wasabi root is available in Japanese groceries; grate it just before using.
To avoid a coughing fit from excessive mustard pungency, or to recover from <<one|9c:0>>, inhale only through the nose and exhale only through the mouth.
Sichuan pepper pungency is a buzzing, numbing sensation in the mouth, caused by Sichuan peppercorns, Japanese sansho powder and leaves, and Australian mountain pepper. It survives cooking.

All pungent flavorings can irritate the eyes and lungs when they\x{2019}re heated during cooking or dishwashing.",

            "Choose a properly sized pan, either well seasoned or nonstick, so that the eggs will form a medium-thin layer (an 8-inch-diameter/ 20-centimeter pan for <<2 to 3|10a:0>> eggs).
Have any filling ingredients warm and ready. Precook vegetables to remove excess water.
Whisk together eggs, other liquids, and seasonings.
Heat the pan alone over moderately high heat to 275 to 300\x{b0}F /135 to 150\x{b0}C, or hot enough to vaporize a water drop in 1 to 2 seconds. Coat the pan with oil or fat, and pour in the eggs.
Stir and scrape until the mass just begins to hold together.
Place any filling on the top.
Leave the eggs undisturbed just long enough to set and, if desired, lightly brown the bottom surface.
Fold the omelet in half or in thirds and slide onto a prewarmed plate.

Frittatas and flat omelets usually include vegetables, meats, or cheese, aren\x{2019}t folded onto themselves, and are made thicker to begin with.",

            'Use a meat grinder or, if necessary, a food processor.
Prechill the meats, grinder or processor blade, and bowl in the freezer to prevent the meat and fat from softening into a paste.
Process the meat in short pulses, stopping every few to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
For a moist-cooked sausage or hamburger, include pieces of fat to make a total of about 20 percent fat in the mix, <<about 3|9:0>> to 4 ounces per pound/200 grams per kilogram.


To cook meat well, it helps to know why some meats start out tender and others tough, and what kind of cooking is best for each.',
