            "In the last thirty years, Ron has invented a succession of kitchen gadgets, among them the Ronco Electric Food Dehydrator and the Popeil Automatic Pasta and Sausage Maker, which featured a thrust bearing made of the same material used in bulletproof glass. He works steadily, guided by flashes of inspiration. In August of 2000, for instance, he suddenly realized what product should follow the Showtime Rotisserie. He and his right-hand man, Alan Backus, had been working on a bread-and-batter machine, which would take up to ten pounds of chicken wings or scallops or shrimp or fish fillets and do all the work \x{2014} combining the eggs, the flour, the breadcrumbs \x{2014} in a few minutes, without dirtying either the cook\x{2019}s hands or the machine. \x{201c}Alan goes to Korea, where we have some big orders coming through,\x{201d} Ron explained recently over lunch \x{2014} a hamburger, medium-well, with fries \x{2014} in the VIP booth by the door in the Polo Lounge, at the Beverly Hills Hotel. \x{201c}I call Alan on the phone. I wake him up. It was <<two in the morning|9a>> there. And these are my exact words: \x{2018}Stop. Do not pursue the bread-and-batter machine. I will pick it up later. This other project needs to come first.\x{2019} \x{201d} The other project, his inspiration, was a device capable of smoking meats indoors without creating odors that can suffuse the air and permeate furniture. Ron had a version of the indoor smoker on his porch \x{2014} \x{201c}a Rube Goldberg kind of thing\x{201d} that he\x{2019}d worked on a year earlier \x{2014} and, on a whim, he cooked a chicken in it. \x{201c}That chicken was so good that I said to myself\x{201d} \x{2014} and with his left hand Ron began to pound on the table \x{2014} \x{201c}This is the best chicken sandwich I have ever had in my life.\x{201d} He turned to me: \x{201c}How many times have you had a smoked-turkey sandwich? Maybe you have a smoked-turkey or a smoked-chicken sandwich once every six months. Once! How many times have you had smoked salmon? Aah. More. I\x{2019}m going to say you come across smoked salmon as an hors d\x{2019}oeuvre or an entr\x{e9}e once every three months. Baby-back ribs? Depends on which restaurant you order ribs at. Smoked sausage, same thing. You touch on smoked food\x{201d} \x{2014} he leaned in and poked my arm for emphasis \x{2014} \x{201c}but I know one thing, Malcolm. You don\x{2019}t have a smoker.\x{201d}",

            "Ron Popeil started pitching his father\x{2019}s kitchen gadgets at the Maxwell Street flea market in Chicago, in the midfifties. He was thirteen. Every morning, he would arrive at the market at <<five|9c:1>> and prepare fifty pounds each of onions, cabbages, and carrots, and a hundred pounds of potatoes. He sold from <<six in the morning|5>> until <<four in the afternoon|5>>, bringing in as much as \$500 a day. In his late teens, he started doing the state- and county-fair circuit, and then he scored a prime spot in the Woolworth\x{2019}s at State and Washington, in the Loop, which at the time was the top-grossing Woolworth\x{2019}s store in the country. He was making more than the manager of the store, selling the Chop-O-Matic and the Dial-O-Matic. He dined at the Pump Room and wore a Rolex and rented \$150-a-night hotel suites. In pictures from the period, he is beautiful, with thick dark hair and blue-green eyes and sensuous lips, and, several years later, when he moved his office to 919 Michigan Avenue, he was called the Paul Newman of the Playboy Building. Mel Korey, a friend of Ron\x{2019}s from college and his first business partner, remembers the time he went to see Ron pitch the Chop-O-Matic at the State Street Woolworth\x{2019}s. \x{201c}He was mesmerizing,\x{201d} Korey says. \x{201c}There were secretaries who would take their lunch break at Woolworth\x{2019}s to watch him because he was so good-looking. He would go into the turn, and people would just come running.\x{201d} Several years ago, Ron\x{2019}s friend Steve Wynn, the founder of the Mirage resorts, went to visit Michael Milken in prison. They were near a television, and happened to catch one of Ron\x{2019}s infomercials just as he was doing the countdown, a routine taken straight from the boardwalk, where he says, \x{201c}You\x{2019}re not going to spend two hundred dollars, not a hundred and eighty dollars, not one-seventy, not one-sixty . . .\x{201d} It\x{2019}s a standard pitchman\x{2019}s gimmick: it sounds dramatic only because the starting price is set way up high. But something about the way Ron did it was irresistible. As he got lower and lower, Wynn and Milken \x{2014} who probably know as much about profit margins as anyone in America \x{2014} cried out in unison, \x{201c}Stop, Ron! Stop!\x{201d}",

The second was an electronic ledger showing the total sales up to that point. As Ron took flight, one by one, people left the studio to gather around the computers. Shannon Popeil came first. It was <<12:40 a.m.|2a>> In the studio, Ron was slicing onions with one of his father\x{2019}s Dial-O-Matics. She looked at the second monitor and gave a little gasp. Forty minutes in, and Ron had already passed \$700,000. A QVC manager walked in.

The numbers on the second screen began to change in a blur of recalculation \x{2014} rising in increments of \$129.72 plus shipping and taxes. \x{201c}You know, we\x{2019}re going to hit a million dollars, just on the first hour,\x{201d} one of the QVC guys said, and there was awe in his voice. It was one thing to talk about how Ron was the best there ever was, after all, but quite another to see proof of it, before your very eyes. At that moment, on the other side of the room, the door opened, and a man appeared, stooped and drawn but with a smile on his face. It was Ron Popeil, who invented a better rotisserie in his kitchen and went out and pitched it himself. There was a hush, and then the whole room stood up and cheered.",

            "One of Taleb\x{2019}s earliest Wall Street mentors was a short-tempered Frenchman named Jean-Patrice, who dressed like a peacock and had an almost neurotic obsession with risk. Jean-Patrice would call Taleb from Regine\x{2019}s at <<three in the morning|9a>>, or take a meeting in a Paris nightclub, sipping champagne and surrounded by scantily clad women, and once Jean-Patrice asked Taleb what would happen to his positions if a plane crashed into his building. Taleb was young then and brushed him aside. It seemed absurd. But nothing, Taleb soon realized, is absurd. Taleb likes to quote David Hume: \x{201c}No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.\x{201d} Because LTCM had never seen a black swan in Russia, it thought no Russian black swans existed. Taleb, by contrast, has constructed a trading philosophy predicated entirely on the existence of black swans, on the possibility of some random, unexpected event sweeping the markets. He never sells options, then. He only buys them. He\x{2019}s never the one who can lose a great deal of money if GM stock suddenly plunges. Nor does he ever bet on the market moving in one direction or another. That would require Taleb to assume that he understands the market, and he doesn\x{2019}t. He hasn\x{2019}t Warren Buffett\x{2019}s confidence. So he buys options on both sides, on the possibility of the market moving both up and down. And he doesn\x{2019}t bet on minor fluctuations in the market. Why bother? If everyone else is vastly underestimating the possibility of rare events, then an option on GM at, say, \$40 is going to be undervalued. So Taleb buys out-of-the-money options by the truckload. He buys them for hundreds of different stocks, and if they expire before he gets to use them, he simply buys more. Taleb doesn\x{2019}t even invest in stocks, not for Empirica and not for his own personal account. Buying a stock, unlike buying an option, is a gamble that the future will represent an improved version of the past. And who knows whether that will be true? So all of Taleb\x{2019}s personal wealth, and the hundreds of millions that Empirica has in reserve, is in Treasury bills. Few on Wall Street have taken the practice of buying options to such extremes. But if anything completely out of the ordinary happens to the stock market, if some random event sends a jolt through all of Wall Street and pushes GM to, say, \$20, Nassim Taleb will not end up in a dowdy apartment in Athens. He will be rich.",

            "At Empirica, by contrast, every day brings a small but real possibility that they\x{2019}ll make a huge amount of money in a day; no chance that they\x{2019}ll blow up; and a very large possibility that they\x{2019}ll lose a small amount of money. All those dollar, and fifty-cent, and nickel options that Empirica has accumulated, few of which will ever be used, soon begin to add up. By looking at a particular column on the computer screens showing Empirica\x{2019}s positions, anyone at the firm can tell you precisely how much money Empirica has lost or made so far that day. At <<11:30 a.m.|2a>>, for instance, they had recovered just 28 percent of the money they had spent that day on options. By <<12:30|2>>, they had recovered 40 percent, meaning that the day was not yet half over and Empirica was already in the red to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars. The day before that, it had made back 85 percent of its money; the day before that, 48 percent; the day before that, 65 percent; and the day before that also 65 percent; and, in fact, with a few notable exceptions \x{2014} like the few days when the market reopened after September 11 \x{2014} Empirica has done nothing but lose money since last April. \x{201c}We cannot blow up, we can only bleed to death,\x{201d} Taleb says, and bleeding to death, absorbing the pain of steady losses, is precisely what human beings are hardwired to avoid. \x{201c}Say you\x{2019}ve got a guy who is long on Russian bonds,\x{201d} Savery says. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s making money every day. One day, lightning strikes and he loses five times what he made. Still, on three hundred and sixty-four out of three hundred and sixty-five days he was very happily making money. It\x{2019}s much harder to be the other guy, the guy losing money three hundred and sixty-four days out of three hundred and sixty-five, because you start questioning yourself. Am I ever going to make it back? Am I really right? What if it takes ten years? Will I even be sane ten years from now?\x{201d} What the normal trader gets from his daily winnings is feedback, the pleasing illusion of progress. At Empirica, there is no feedback. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s like you\x{2019}re playing the piano for ten years and you still can\x{2019}t play \x{2018}Chopsticks,\x{2019} \x{201d} Spitznagel say, \x{201c}and the only thing you have to keep you going is the belief that one day you\x{2019}ll wake up and play like Rachmaninoff.\x{201d} Was it easy knowing that Niederhoffer \x{2014} who represented everything they thought was wrong \x{2014} was out there getting rich while they were bleeding away? Of course it wasn\x{2019}t. If you watched Taleb closely that day, you could see the little ways in which the steady drip of losses takes a toll. He glanced a bit too much at the Bloomberg. He leaned forward a bit too often to see the daily loss count. He succumbs to an array of superstitious tics. If the going is good, he parks in the same space every day; he turned against Mahler because he associates Mahler with the last year\x{2019}s long dry spell. \x{201c}Nassim says all the time that he needs me there, and I believe him,\x{201d} Spitznagel says. He is there to remind Taleb that there is a point to waiting, to help Taleb resist the very human impulse to abandon everything and stanch the pain of losing. \x{201c}Mark is my cop,\x{201d} Taleb says. So is Pallop: he is there to remind Taleb that Empirica has the intellectual edge.",

            "The situation with mammography is different. The way in which we ordinarily speak about calcium and lumps is clear and unambiguous. But the picture demonstrates how blurry those seemingly distinct categories actually are. Joann Elmore, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Washington Harborview Medical Center, once asked ten board-certified radiologists to look at <<150|3:0>> mammograms \x{2014} of which 27 had come from women who developed breast cancer, and 123 from women who were known to be healthy. One radiologist caught 85 percent of the cancers the first time around. Another caught only 37 percent. One looked at the same X-rays and saw suspicious masses in 78 percent of the cases. Another doctor saw \x{201c}focal asymmetric density\x{201d} in half of the cancer cases; yet another saw no \x{201c}focal asymmetric density\x{201d} at all. There was one particularly perplexing mammogram that three radiologists thought was normal, two thought was abnormal but probably benign, four couldn\x{2019}t make up their minds about, and one was convinced was cancer. (The patient was fine.) Some of these differences are a matter of skill, and there is good evidence that with more rigorous training and experience radiologists can become better at reading breast X-rays. But so much of what can be seen on an X-ray falls into a gray area that interpreting a mammogram is also, in part, a matter of temperament. Some radiologists see something ambiguous and are comfortable calling it normal. Others see something ambiguous and get suspicious.",

            "The problem of interval tumors explains why the overwhelming majority of breast-cancer experts insist that women in the critical fifty-to-sixty-nine age group get regular mammograms. In Porter\x{2019}s study, the women were X-rayed at intervals as great as every three years, and that created a window large enough for interval cancers to emerge. Interval cancers also explain why many breast-cancer experts believe that mammograms must be supplemented by regular and thorough clinical breast exams. (Thorough is defined as palpation of the area from the collarbone to the bottom of the rib cage, one dime-size area at a time, at <<three|9:1>> levels of pressure \x{2014} just below the skin, the midbreast, and up against the chest wall \x{2014} by a specially trained practitioner for a period not less than five minutes per breast.) In a major study of mammography\x{2019}s effectiveness \x{2014} one of a pair of Canadian trials conducted in the 1980s \x{2014} women who were given regular, thorough breast exams but no mammograms were compared with those who had thorough breast exams and regular mammograms, and no difference was found in the death rates from breast cancer between the two groups. The Canadian studies are controversial, and some breast-cancer experts are convinced that they may have understated the benefits of mammography. But there is no denying the basic lessons of the Canadian trials: that a skilled pair of fingertips can find out an extraordinary amount about the health of a breast, and that we should not automatically value what we see in a picture over what we learn from our other senses.",

            "In the fall of 1973, the Syrian army began to gather a large number of tanks, artillery batteries, and infantry along its border with Israel. Simultaneously, to the south, the Egyptian army canceled all leaves, called up thousands of reservists, and launched a massive military exercise, building roads and preparing anti-aircraft and artillery positions along the Suez Canal. On October 4, an Israeli aerial reconnaissance mission showed that the Egyptians had moved artillery into offensive positions. That evening, Aman, the Israeli military intelligence agency, learned that portions of the Soviet fleet near Port Said and Alexandria had set sail, and that the Soviet government had begun airlifting the families of Soviet advisers out of Cairo and Damascus. Then, at <<four o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> on October 6, Israel\x{2019}s director of military intelligence received an urgent telephone call from one of the country\x{2019}s most trusted intelligence sources. Egypt and Syria, the source said, would attack later that day. Top Israeli officials immediately called a meeting. Was war imminent? The head of Aman, Major General Eli Zeira, looked over the evidence and said he didn\x{2019}t think so. He was wrong. That afternoon, Syria attacked from the east, overwhelming the thin Israeli defenses in the Golan Heights, and Egypt attacked from the south, bombing Israeli positions and sending eight thousand infantry streaming across the Suez. Despite all the warnings of the previous weeks, Israeli officials were caught by surprise. Why couldn\x{2019}t they connect the dots?",

            "Nor did the other signs seem remarkable. The fact that the Soviet families had been sent home could have signified nothing more than a falling-out between the Arab states and Moscow. Yes, a trusted source called at <<four in the morning|9a>>, with definite word of a late-afternoon attack, but his last two attack warnings had been wrong. What\x{2019}s more, the source said that the attack would come at sunset, and an attack so late in the day wouldn\x{2019}t leave enough time for opening air strikes. Israeli intelligence didn\x{2019}t see the pattern of Arab intentions, in other words, because, until Egypt and Syria actually attacked, on the afternoon of October 6, 1973, their intentions didn\x{2019}t form a pattern. They formed a Rorschach blot. What is clear in hindsight is rarely clear before the fact. It\x{2019}s an obvious point, but one that nonetheless bears repeating, particularly when we\x{2019}re in the midst of assigning blame for the surprise attack of September 11.",

During this period of time, the target stopped the turn, and the airspeed decreased to <<about 153|18:0>> KIAS. About 2139, the target leveled off at 2500 feet and flew in a southeasterly direction.

            "But instead, from all appearances, he panicked. At the moment when he needed to remember the lessons he had been taught about instrument flying, his mind \x{2014} like Morphew\x{2019}s when she was underwater \x{2014} must have gone blank. Instead of reviewing the instruments, he seems to have been focused on one question: Where are the lights of Martha\x{2019}s Vineyard? His gyroscope and his other instruments may well have become as invisible as the peripheral lights in the underwater-panic experiments. He had fallen back on his instincts \x{2014} on the way the plane felt \x{2014} and in the dark, of course, instinct can tell you nothing. The NTSB report says that the last time the Piper\x{2019}s wings were level was seven seconds <<past 9:40|2>>, and the plane hit the water at <<about 9:41|2>>, so the critical period here was less than sixty seconds. At twenty-five seconds past the minute, the plane was tilted at an angle greater than forty-five degrees. Inside the cockpit it would have felt normal. At some point, Kennedy must have heard the rising wind outside, or the roar of the engine as it picked up speed. Again, relying on instinct, he might have pulled back on the stick, trying to raise the nose of the plane. But pulling back on the stick without first leveling the wings only makes the spiral tighter and the problem worse. It\x{2019}s also possible that Kennedy did nothing at all, and that he was frozen at the controls, still frantically searching for the lights of the Vineyard, when his plane hit the water. Sometimes pilots don\x{2019}t even try to make it out of a spiral dive. Langewiesche calls that \x{201c}one G all the way down.\x{201d}",
