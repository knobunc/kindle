yours and let you in on a secret: girls kick arse. We\x{2019}re faster,
smarter and better than boys. We play harder. We spend too much
time thinking that we\x{2019}re freaks for gaming and when we do game, we
never play as girls because we catch so much shite for it. Time to
turn that around. I am the best gamer in the world and I\x{2019}m a girl.
I started playing at <<10|9c:0>>, and there were no women in games\x{2014}you
couldn\x{2019}t even buy a game in any of the shops I went to. It\x{2019}s
different now, but it\x{2019}s still not perfect. We\x{2019}re going to change
that, chickens, you lot and me.",
