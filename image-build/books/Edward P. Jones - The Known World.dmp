There was a good-sized plot at the back and off to the left of the house where Henry had planned for himself, Caldonia  and  their  generations  to  be  buried.  It  was  on  the  same  piece  of  land  where  slaves  were buried,  but  separate,  the  way  white  slaveowners  did  it.  The  slave  cemetery  was  nearly  empty  of adults, unlike the generations of men and women who were in other slave cemeteries in Manchester County.  Henry  Townsend  had  not  been  a  master  long  enough  for  his  adult  slaves  to  die  and populate the cemetery. In that slave cemetery there was Peter, the man run over by the horses, and there  was  Sadie,  a  fairly  new  purchase  by  Henry  at  the  time  of  her  death.  A  tall  woman  of  forty who, five years before, fell asleep on an empty stomach after fourteen hours in the field and never woke up. Beside Peter in death, she had been mostly alone in life, owing perhaps to her newness to the  plantation.  No  husband,  though  she  had  lain  twice  with  a  man  from  another  plantation.  That man\x{2019}s master, a white man of five slaves to his name, allowed the slave to come to Sadie\x{2019}s funeral, though  he  warned  Andy  that  if  the  funeral  went  on  too  long,  as  nigger  funerals  sometimes  did, Andy  was  to  step  away  and  come  straight  back  home.  He  wrote  Andy  a  pass  that  expired  at  <<two o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>>. There were ten infants in the slave cemetery, five girls, five boys, only two of  them  related;  none  had  seen  their  second  year  of  life.  No  two  had  died  of  the  same  thing.  An inability  to  digest  even  mother\x{2019}s  milk,  an  infection  from  a  burn  from  a  flying  ember,  a  silent, unexplained death during the night as if not to disturb her mother\x{2019}s sleep. One had died strapped to his mother\x{2019}s back as the woman worked in the fields, two days before the end of harvest, the day Loretta  the  maid  and  Caldonia  the  mistress  were  away  and  Zeddie  the  cook  took  sick  and  was unable to look after the  baby. The only  child over two  years in the cemetery  was twelve-year-old Luke, a gangly boy of a sweet nature, dead of hard work on a farm to which he had been rented for \$2 a week. A boy Elias and Celeste had loved. Henry had Luke\x{2019}s mother brought in for the funeral from  two  counties  over,  but  no  one  could  find  his  father.  Both  cemeteries  were  on  a  rise,  both guarded by trees, some apple, some dogwoods, a stunning magnolia, and some trees no one could make head or tail of.

Elias looked up and found the winking stars in a clear part of the sky that were supposed to have guided him away. How ready he had been, at ease, legs powerful, heart desperate to beat under another moon and sun. He sat down again and put the doll inside his shirt and leaned over to pick up another piece of wood. It was nearing <<nine-thirty|5k:0>>. As he took up the knife, Alice came out of her cabin and danced down the lane and stood before him with her hands on  her  hips.  They  had  rarely  spoken  because  nothing  she  said  ever  made  sense.  \x{201c}Whatcha  makin now?\x{201d} she said, surprising him. \x{201c}Somethin for my boy.\x{201d} \x{201c}Well,  you just make it good, make it to last,\x{201d} Alice said. He waited for her to follow up with some nonsense, but she just stood as she had been.

This  was  in  the  time  when  Sheriff  John  Skiffington\x{2019}s  patrollers  were getting used to their new jobs. Elias got about five miles from the Townsend place when he began losing his strength. He ate most of the hoe cakes he brought with him, thinking the problem was a body rebellious due to hunger. He stopped as often as he could to collect himself but each time he started  up  again,  he  was  weaker  than  before.  At  about  seven  miles  he  was  nearly  reduced  to crawling, and at the eighth mile he collapsed. He awoke, stretched out in the road, to hear a slow horse coming his way. Uncertain which way the horse was coming from, he began crawling toward the side of the road where tall grass waited. He parted the grass and made a place for himself and heard the horse come up and stop. It was William Robbins on Sir Guilderham. \x{201c}Whatever you are, I know you are there,\x{201d} Robbins said. \x{201c}Come out if you\x{2019}re nigger, and if you are white, tell me your name and I\x{2019}ll leave you to it.\x{201d}",

Sam, the man with one ear, lived on at the Robbins\x{2019}s plantation. He had a cabin to himself, which Robbins had permitted even after the overseer had said it would spoil him. \x{201c}Once he learned right from wrong, he gave me good work,\x{201d} Robbins said to the overseer. Sam was still grabbing and frightening little children. The grown-ups knew it was a habit that they could do nothing about, so they tried to teach the children to avoid him. \x{201c}Give him not even so much as a good mornin or  a good night. Wave from way over yonder when he speak to you and be on your way.\x{201d} On  his  way  to  the  Townsend  place  on  Tuesday  morning,  Oden  Peoples  the  Cherokee  met Sheriff John Skiffington and told him he had been hired by Henry after one of his slaves had run away.  Skiffington  had  in  his  saddlebag  a  month-old  letter  from  his  cousin  Counsel  Skiffington  in North  Carolina.  The  letter  swore  by  a  woman  in  Amelia  County  who  had  a  cure  for  stomach ailments, which John Skiffington had suffered from since he was a boy. Counsel had always teased John about his \x{201c}woman\x{2019}s stomach\x{201d} but he had never thought his cousin\x{2019}s pain was not real. John had set out for an overnight trip to the woman in Amelia, but hearing about Elias running away, he decided to go with Oden Peoples, one of his patrollers. A runaway slave was, in fact, a thief since he  had  stolen  his  master\x{2019}s  property\x{2013}himself.  They  arrived  <<about  9:30|2>>.  Moses  and  one  other  man took Elias from the field and Oden sliced off about a third of his ear as everyone, including Henry, stood in the lane. Elias had his head down all the while except when Oden pulled it up to get the razor to do a better job. All of the lobe and then some. Oden always carried a pouch with a pepper poultice, which he blended with vinegar and mustard and a little salt\x{2013}a proven remedy to halt the bleeding  of  even  those  who  seemed  to  have  more  blood  than  other  men.  \x{201c}The  bleeders,\x{201d}  Oden called them. Elias lowered his head again and stood with his hands at his side, refusing to hold the poultice in place. In the end, Oden had to tie the poultice on Elias\x{2019}s head with a rag Moses brought from his cabin.",

He was too near to them to run; it would not take them long to overtake him and the horse.

When  they  had  all  cleared  the  forest,  they  sat  down  as  one  on  their haunches. At some safe distance, he thought, he could have admired the wonder of them, the variety of colors and sizes, and the sense that they were sharing the same mind. They had stopped but the thunder on the ground went on. He eased his gun out of the holster and held it along with the reins.",
