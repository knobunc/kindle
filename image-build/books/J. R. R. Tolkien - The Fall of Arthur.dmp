            "More than seven centuries had passed since the departure from Britain of the Roman legions when in the mid-years of the twelfth century, probably <<about 1136|18:0>>, there appeared a work entitled Historia Regum Britanniae, by Geoffrey of Monmouth (who incidentally makes a momentary appearance in my father\x{2019}s work The Notion Club Papers, published in Sauron Defeated, pp.192, 216). Of this History of the Kings of Britain it was said (by Sir Edmund Chambers, in 1927) that \x{2018}no work of imagination, save the Aeneid, has done more to shape the legend of a people.\x{2019} He used the word \x{2018}imagination\x{2019} advisedly. It is said that Geoffrey of Monmouth\x{2019}s book was the source of the \x{2018}historical\x{2019} (as opposed to the \x{2018}romance\x{2019}) tradition of King Arthur, but the word is very misleading unless it is understood to mean that Geoffrey\x{2019}s work, while full of marvels and extravagances embedded in a totally unhistorical structure, was nonetheless in \x{2018}the mode of history\x{2019} (a narrative chronicle of events in Latin, soberly told), but not by any means of its substance: hence \x{2018}pseudo-historical\x{2019} is a term that is applied to it.",

Arthur saw that there was \x{2018}a chayere of chalke-whytte silver\x{2019} at the top of Fortune\x{2019}s Wheel, from which six kings had fallen and now clung with broken crowns to the outer circle of the wheel, each in turn lamenting that he had fallen from such heights of greatness and power; and two kings were climbing up to claim the high seat at the summit of the wheel. The lady Fortune now raised Arthur to that seat, telling him that it was through her that he had won all his honour in war, that she had chosen him to sit in the high chair, and treating him as \x{2018}soverayne in erthe\x{2019}.

            "In all the accounts of this war Sir Gawain is credited with the possession of a very singular \x{2018}grace\x{2019}, a faculty whereby his strength greatly increased <<towards noon|13>> and then again declined. When Lancelot perceived that this was so he dodged to and fro and avoided Gawain\x{2019}s thrusts for a long time until his miraculous strength began to wane, whereupon Lancelot fell on him and gave him a great wound. (Incidentally the Mort Artu tells the story that during the time of Gawain\x{2019}s recovery Arthur left the siege of Benwick and conducted his Roman campaign, in which the Emperor Lucius was slain; Malory of course ignored this, since he had already told the story in his tale of Arthur and the Emperor Lucius, see here.) But when Gawain was able to fight again all was repeated a second time with the same outcome, for Lancelot struck him in the place of the former wound. And even yet Gawain\x{2019}s hatred was unappeased, but as he prepared for a third attempt news came from England that led Arthur to raise the siege of Benwick and return. That news was that Mordred had claimed to have received letters telling that Arthur had been slain in battle by Lancelot; that he had \x{2018}made a parlemente\x{2019}, and had had himself crowned king at Canterbury; and that he had declared that he would wed Guinevere, naming the day and preparing the bridal feast.",
