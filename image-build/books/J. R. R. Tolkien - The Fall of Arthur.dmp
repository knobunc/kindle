            '[12:00] The Fall of Arthur - J. R. R. Tolkien.epub (index_split_009.html) - noon',
            "Dawn came dimly.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}On the dark faces \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 15\x{a0} 
of the old mountains\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}eastward staring\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
light was kindled.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The land shimmered.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Sun came shining.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Silver morning\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
bathed in water\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}bright ascended\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
the bare heaven\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}blue and lofty. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 20\x{a0} 
Beams fell slanting \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}through the boughs of trees\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
glancing and glimmering\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the grey forest;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
rain drops running\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}from rustling leaves\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
like drops of glass\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}dripped and glistened.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
No beast was stirring:\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}the birds listened. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 25\x{a0} 
As wary as wolves\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}through the wood stalking\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
to the marches rode there\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Mordred\x{2019}s hunters,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
huge and hungry\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}hounds beside them\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
the fewte followed\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}fiercely baying.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
The queen they hunted\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}with cold hatred \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 30\x{a0} 

till their hope failed them\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}amid houseless stones,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
halting hungry-eyed\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}under the hills\x{2019} menace\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
at the walls of Wales.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}War was behind them\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and woe in Britain.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Winds were shifting,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Mordred waiting.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Their message found him\x{a0}35\x{a0} 
by the seaward cliffs\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the south-country\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
sheer and shining.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Upon shaven grass\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
his tents were marshalled,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}as a town clustered\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
with lanes and alleys\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}loud with voices\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
in the dales hidden\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and on downs rising \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 40\x{a0} 
above Romeril\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}where running water\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
to the shore had cloven\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}a shallow pathway.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
From the East, from Angel\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and the isles of mist,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
there kings of Almain\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}their craft mustered,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
under cliff crowding\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}their carven prows \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 45\x{a0} 

and black banners\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the breeze flying.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Fair wind came foaming\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}over flecked water,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
on gleaming shingle\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}green and silver\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
the waves were washing\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}on walls of chalk.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
On a mound of grass\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Mordred stood there: \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 50\x{a0} 
ever gazed his eyes\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}out and southward,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
lest Arthur\x{2019}s ships\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}unawares to shore\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
the winds should waft.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Watchmen he posted\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
by the sea\x{2019}s margin\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the south-country,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
by night and day\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}the narrow waters \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 55\x{a0} 
from the hills to heed.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}There on high raised he\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
builded beacons\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}that should blaze with fire,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
if Arthur came,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to his aid calling\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
his men to muster\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}where he most needed.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Thus he watched and waited\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and the wind studied.\x{a0} 60\x{a0} 

\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 
Ivor hailed him\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}with eager voice\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
by his tent standing\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}tall and brooding;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
words unwelcome\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}from the West brought he.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{2018}O King!\x{2019} he cried,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}the Queen is lost!\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Her trail faded\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the trackless stones; \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 65\x{a0} 
hound and hunter\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the hills faltered.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
To the hidden kingdom\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and the holy vales\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
where Leodegrance\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}once long ago\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
lived beleaguered,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}lord enchanted,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
she hath fled and is free.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}But few love her. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 70\x{a0} 

Fear her no longer,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}the fay-woman!\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Fell fate take her!\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}May her feet never\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
return hither\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to trouble Mordred!\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
From thy mind thrust her!\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}With men deal thou,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
woman forsaking\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and to war turning! \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 75\x{a0} 
Thine hour is at hand.\x{2019}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Then his eyes wavered\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and his tongue halted.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Turning slowly\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
with frown of thunder\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}fiercely Mordred\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
gazed on him glaring.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}Begone!\x{2019} cried he.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{2018}The master\x{2019}s hour\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}master chooseth. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 80\x{a0} 
Nought thou knowest.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}At need failing\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
from vain errand\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}dost venture home\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
with tongue untamed\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to teach Mordred\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
thy fool\x{2019}s counsel?\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Flee mine anger\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
unto foul fortune.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The fiend take thee!\x{2019} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 85\x{a0} 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 
Alone then long\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}lowering paced he.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
In his bosom there burned\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}under black shadow\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
a smouldering fire\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}whose smoke choked him;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
his mind wavered\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in a maze walking\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
between fear and fury.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}At first his thought \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 90\x{a0} 
hunger-hunted\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}from his hold wandered\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
by lust allured\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to its long torment.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
But he guessed that Guinever\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}had greeting sent\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
by secret servant\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}over sea speeding\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
to Lancelot,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}love recalling \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 95\x{a0} 
and his aid asking\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in her evil day.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Should Ban\x{2019}s kindred\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to battle hasten\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and the fair lily\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}on the field sable\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
once more be seen\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}marching proudly\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Arthur to strengthen,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}ill were boded \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 100\x{a0} 
to his plot and purpose.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Thus he pondered long.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
For Lancelot,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}lord of Benwick,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
most he hated\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and yet most dreaded,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and words of witchcraft\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}well remembered\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
that lords of Benwick\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}the lily bearing \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 105\x{a0} 
in open battle\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}should he ever challenge\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
he would reap ruin.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Thus wrath with cunning,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
doubt with daring\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in his dark counsel\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
warred uncertain.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The wind lessened.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
In cloudless sky\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}clear and golden \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 110\x{a0} 
the sun at evening\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}summer rekindled\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
in a glow sinking.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The sea glimmered\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
under streaming stars\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the steep heaven.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Day followed day.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Dawn came brightly\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
with a breeze blowing\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}blithe at morning \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 115\x{a0} 
cool and keenwing\x{e9}d.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}A cry woke him.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{2018}A sail, a sail\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}on the sea shining!\x{2019}\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Watchmen were calling,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}wailing voices\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
from ward to ward\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}the wind carried,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and grasping brands\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}guards by the beacons \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 120\x{a0} 
wakeful waited.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}No word gave he.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Eager went his eyes\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}out and southward,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and sails saw he\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}on the sea climbing.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Thus came Arthur\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}at early morn\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
at last returning\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to his lost kingdom. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 125\x{a0} 
On his shrouds there shone\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}sheen with silver\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
a white lady\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in holy arms\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
a babe bearing\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}born of maiden.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Sun shone through them.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The sea sparkled.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Men marked it well,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Mordred knew it, \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 130\x{a0} 
Arthur\x{2019}s ensign.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Yet his eyes wandered;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
for the banner of Benwick\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}breathless looked he,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
silver upon sable.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}But he saw it not.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
The fair flower-de-luce\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}on its field withered\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
drooping in darkness.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Doom came nearer. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 135\x{a0} 
The sun mounted\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and the sails whitened.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Far over the sea\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}faintly sounding\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
trumpets heard they.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Towering upward\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
from Arthur\x{2019}s side\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}eager hastened\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
a mighty ship\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the morn gleaming \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 140\x{a0} 
high, white-timbered,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}with hull gilded;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
on its sail was sewn\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}a sun rising,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
on its broidered banner\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the breeze floated\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
a fiery griffon\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}golden flaming.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Thus came Gawain\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}his king guarding \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 145\x{a0} 
valiant-hearted\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} the vaward leading:\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
a hundred ships\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}with hulls shining\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and shrouds swelling\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and shields swinging.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Behind beheld they\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}the host faring:\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
deepweighed dromonds\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and drawn barges, \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 150\x{a0} 
galleys and galleons\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}with gear of war,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
six hundred sail\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in the sun turning,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
fair sight and fell.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Flags were streaming;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
ten thousand told\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}targes hung there\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
bright on the bulwarks,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}blazons of princes \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 155\x{a0} 
and knights of the North\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and the nine kingdoms\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
of Britain the blessed.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}But Ban\x{2019}s kindred,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and Lancelot\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}with his lilies came not.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 
Then Mordred laughed\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}loud and mirthless.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Word he shouted.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Wild were the trumpets. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 160\x{a0} 
Beacons were blazing,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}banners were lifted,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
shaft rang on shield,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and the shores echoed.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
War was awakened\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and woe in Britain.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Thus came Arthur\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to his own kingdom\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
in power and majesty\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}proud returning \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 165\x{a0} 
to Romeril\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}where running slowly\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
by the shore now weeps\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}a shuddering water.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Sun shone on swords.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Silver-pointed\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}

at their stems standing\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}sternly shouted;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
blades they brandished\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and broad axes, \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 175\x{a0} 
on their gods calling\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}with grim voices.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}

their sea-horses\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to sudden onset,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
swerving swifly\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and swinging inward.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Beak met bulwark.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Burst were timbers. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 180\x{a0} 
There was clang of iron\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}and crash of axes;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
sparked and splintered\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}spears and helmets;\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
the smiths of battle\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}on smitten anvils\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}

wrath and ruin.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Red their hands were. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 185\x{a0}

\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}

His great galleon\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}golden shining\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}

with wind behind her.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}In her wake followed\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
lieges of Lothian,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}lords and captains.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Oars were splintered.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Iron clave timber,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and ropes were riven.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}With rending crash\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
masts dismantled\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}as mountain-trees \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 195\x{a0}

his sword renowned \x{2013} smiths enchanted\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}

forth leapt he as fire\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}a flame wielding.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
The king of Gothland\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}on his carven prow\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}

hewed asunder.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}High rang his voice\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{2018}Arthur\x{2019} calling.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The air trembled\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
with thunderous answer\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}thousandfolded.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
As straw from storm,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}as stalks falling\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
before reapers ruthless,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}as roke flying \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 210\x{a0}

his foemen fled.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Fear o\x{2019}ercame them.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
From board and beam\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}beaten fell they,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
in the sea they sank\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}their souls losing.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Boats were blazing,\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}burned and smoking; \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 215\x{a0} 
some on shore shivered\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to shards broken.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Red ran the tide\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}the rocks staining.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
Shields on the water\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}shorn and splintered\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
as flotsam floated.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Few saved their lives\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
broken and bleeding\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}from that battle flying. \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 220\x{a0} 
Thus came Arthur\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}to his own kingdom\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0} 
and the sea\x{2019}s passage\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}with the sword conquered,\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}

But there is no reference to his strength increasing <<towards noon|13>> and then declining, which was an important element in the story of the siege of Benwick, where Lancelot wounded him grievously when his strength waned (see here).

            "More than seven centuries had passed since the departure from Britain of the Roman legions when in the mid-years of the twelfth century, probably <<about 1136|18:0>>, there appeared a work entitled Historia Regum Britanniae, by Geoffrey of Monmouth (who incidentally makes a momentary appearance in my father\x{2019}s work The Notion Club Papers, published in Sauron Defeated, pp.192, 216). Of this History of the Kings of Britain it was said (by Sir Edmund Chambers, in 1927) that \x{2018}no work of imagination, save the Aeneid, has done more to shape the legend of a people.\x{2019} He used the word \x{2018}imagination\x{2019} advisedly. It is said that Geoffrey of Monmouth\x{2019}s book was the source of the \x{2018}historical\x{2019} (as opposed to the \x{2018}romance\x{2019}) tradition of King Arthur, but the word is very misleading unless it is understood to mean that Geoffrey\x{2019}s work, while full of marvels and extravagances embedded in a totally unhistorical structure, was nonetheless in \x{2018}the mode of history\x{2019} (a narrative chronicle of events in Latin, soberly told), but not by any means of its substance: hence \x{2018}pseudo-historical\x{2019} is a term that is applied to it.",

When Lancelot perceived that this was so he dodged to and fro and avoided Gawain\x{2019}s thrusts for a long time until his miraculous strength began to wane, whereupon Lancelot fell on him and gave him a great wound. (Incidentally the Mort Artu tells the story that during the time of Gawain\x{2019}s recovery Arthur left the siege of Benwick and conducted his Roman campaign, in which the Emperor Lucius was slain; Malory of course ignored this, since he had already told the story in his tale of Arthur and the Emperor Lucius, see here.) But when Gawain was able to fight again all was repeated a second time with the same outcome, for Lancelot struck him in the place of the former wound. And even yet Gawain\x{2019}s hatred was unappeased, but as he prepared for a third attempt news came from England that led Arthur to raise the siege of Benwick and return. That news was that Mordred had claimed to have received letters telling that Arthur had been slain in battle by Lancelot; that he had \x{2018}made a parlemente\x{2019}, and had had himself crowned king at Canterbury; and that he had declared that he would wed Guinevere, naming the day and preparing the bridal feast.",
