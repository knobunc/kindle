The dragon formed a picture of a very nice looking little plant. A human person walked past, and it reached out a vine to stroke the person\'s leg. The person burst out laughing and skittered away. Then a dragon walked by, and the plant touched it similarly, making it puff smoke and depart in good humor. The plant treated several passersby that way, between times folding its foliage about it in a most aesthetic form. That was it.',

            'Two Xanth novels ago I intended to change from Windows to the Linux operating system. I didn\'t make it then; despite what open source fans may claim, it\'s not an easy change. But one Xanth novel ago I was using it. For this one I changed again, to a more advanced Linux system with parallel hard drives and the next generation of my StarOffice word processor: OpenOffice. I like it very well, but it still was not easy. You see, I\'m an ornery independent nut-it\'s the way ogres are-and I don\'t use the standard KWERTY keyboard, I use Dvorak. Most computer systems have it, and so does this one-but mine is the original, not the flawed version the computer folk put on. So I need to change it to mine, and therein lies the hassle. This system had the wrong Dvorak, and resisted my modifications. So I started this novel on my old Linux system and did the first five chapters. Then when I finally got the keyboard right I changed to StarOffice on this new system, dubbed MoNsTeR, and did chapter 6. Then I got OpenOffice and did chapters <<7-18|5a:0>> in it. OpenOffice is nice; it is file oriented, has beautiful clear font display, and saves files to half the size of MS Word files, effectively doubling my storage space. So if you notice some change of type or quality at these points, that\'s why, though I suspect it\'s all in your marvelous imagination.',
