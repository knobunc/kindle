            "Mariane.\x{a0} Me?\x{a0} No.

Valere.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ah.\x{a0} Well then, I'll soon be abroad.

Adieu, madam.\x{a0} [He slowly starts to leave.]

Mariane.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Adieu.

Dorine [to Mariane].\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} I think, perchance,

You've lost your mind through extravagance,

And I've only allowed you to go on

Like this to see what folly you might spawn.

Hey!\x{a0} Valere!



[She grabs him by the arm and he makes a show of resistance.]



Valere.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Huh?\x{a0} What do you want, Dorine?

Dorine.\x{a0} Come here.

Valere.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} No.\x{a0} I'm too mad.\x{a0} Don't intervene.

She wishes me to drain this bitter cup.

Dorine.\x{a0} Stop.

Valere.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} No, can't you see that my mind's made up?

Dorine.\x{a0} Ah!

Mariane [aside].\x{a0} My presence pains him, I drive him away.

I think it would be best if I didn't stay.

Dorine\x{a0} [She leaves Valere and runs after Mariane].\x{a0} Now where are you going?

Mariane.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Let go.

Dorine.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Then return.

Mariane.\x{a0} No, no, Dorine.\x{a0} It's none of your concern.

Valere [aside].\x{a0} I see that my presence causes her pain;

It would be best if I freed her again.

Dorine [She leaves Mariane and runs to Valere].

Wait!\x{a0} May you both be damned if I want this mess!

Come here you two and settle this fracas.



[She pulls them both together.]



Valere [to Dorine].\x{a0} But what's your plan?

Mariane [to Dorine].\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} What do you wish to do?

Dorine.\x{a0} To patch things up a bit between you two.

[To Valere].\x{a0} Are you out of your mind to fight in this way?

Valere.\x{a0} Did you hear her treat me like a popinjay?

Dorine [to Mariane].\x{a0} Are you mad to have gotten so enraged?

Mariane.\x{a0} Did you see what happened?\x{a0} It can't be assuaged.

Dorine.\x{a0} You're both dunces.\x{a0} [To Valere] She wants nothing more

Than to be the one woman you adore.

[To Mariane]\x{a0} He loves you alone, and to make you his wife

Is his only desire--I swear on my life!

Mariane [to Valere].\x{a0} How, then, could you give me such bad advice?

Valere.\x{a0} And how could you demand it?\x{a0} Was that wise?

Dorine.\x{a0} You're both insane.\x{a0} Now give your hands to me.

[To Valere]\x{a0} Come on.

Valere [giving his hand to Dorine]. What for?

Dorine.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} There.\x{a0} [To Mariane]\x{a0} Now yours, don't you see.

Mariane [giving her hand as well].\x{a0} What's the point of all this?

Dorine.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Lord!\x{a0} Quick!\x{a0} Come on!

Your love for each other can't be withdrawn.



[Valere and Mariane hold hands for awhile without looking at each other.]



Valere [turning toward Mariane].\x{a0} Don't react so painfully by the book.

Try giving a fellow a civil look.



[Mariane turns her gaze on Valere and gives him a shy smile.]



Dorine.\x{a0} All lovers are crazy!\x{a0} It's sad, but true.

Valere [to Mariane].\x{a0} Am I not right to complain about you?

And to tell the truth, weren't you rather unkind

To delight in trying to unsettle my mind?

Mariane.\x{a0} What about you?\x{a0} Aren't you the bigger ingrate . . . ?

Dorine.\x{a0} Let's wait until later for this debate

And try instead to stop this marriage.

Mariane.\x{a0} Tell us, then, what we can use for leverage.

Dorine.\x{a0} We will wage warfare on every front.

Your father is bluffing and playing a stunt.

[To Mariane] But it might be better for you to seem

To sweetly consent to his crazy scheme

So that, whatever the future may bring,

You can postpone and postpone this wedding.

By gaining time, we gain our remedy.

Sometimes you will feign a strange malady

Whose sudden onset will bring some delay;

Sometimes an ill-omen will cause you dismay:

You saw a corpse and never felt queerer,

Dreamt of muddy water, or broke a mirror.

The point above all is that no one, I guess,

Can force you to marry unless you say, \"Yes.\"

But our ship would sail in fairer weather

If you were never seen talking together.

[To Valere] Go, and without delay employ each friend

To keep him on course toward what we intend.

[To Mariane] We are going to seek help from his brother

And we'll also recruit your step-mother.

Farewell.

Valere [to Mariane].\x{a0} Whatever we attempt to do,

In truth, my greatest hope resides in you.

Mariane [to Valere].\x{a0} Although I cannot answer for my father,

I vow I'll never belong to another.

Valere.\x{a0} How happy you have made me!\x{a0} If they ever . . .

Dorine.\x{a0} Fie! You young lovers prattle forever!

Be off, I say.

Valere [going a step and then returning].

\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Finally . . .

Dorine.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}What blather!

You go off that way, and you go the other.





ACT III



SCENE I

Damis, Dorine



Damis.\x{a0} May a bolt of lightning now strike me dumb,

May everybody treat me like a bum

If either respect or force can hinder me

From blowing my top at this calamity!

Dorine.\x{a0} For heaven's sake, control your displeasure.

Your father has merely mentioned this measure.

No one does everything he proposes.

How something opens may not be how it closes.

Damis.\x{a0} I need to stop this vulgar coxcomb's plot

And in two little words tell him what's what.

Dorine.\x{a0} Whoa now!\x{a0} Why don't you let your stepmother

Manage him just as she does your father.

Over Tartuffe she has her own little ways

Of making him welcome all that she says,

And perhaps she makes his heart go pitter-patter.

Pray God it's true!\x{a0} That would be a fine matter.

In fact she has summoned him for your sake

In order to learn exactly what's at stake,

To find out his feelings, and to let him know

What really rotten results would flow

From any pretensions he might have to marry.

His valet says he's praying, and I should tarry--

That he'll descend after he meditates.

Be off then, I beg you, and let me wait.

Damis.\x{a0} I demand to be here the whole time they meet.

Dorine.\x{a0} No. They must be alone.

Damis.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} I won't even speak.

Dorine.\x{a0} You're kidding yourself.\x{a0} You're so quick to anger,

And that would surely put us all in danger.

Go.

Damis.\x{a0} No.\x{a0} I'm going to watch--without getting cross.

Dorine.\x{a0} How tiresome you are!\x{a0} Here they come.\x{a0} Get lost!



[Damis hides himself in a closet.]



SCENE II

Tartuffe, Laurent, Dorine



Tartuffe [observing Dorine].\x{a0} Laurent, lock up my hair shirt and my scourge,

And pray for freedom from each carnal urge.

If anyone comes calling, say I have gone

To share my alms with the poor souls in prison.

Dorine [aside].\x{a0} Such affectation and boastful behavior!

Tartuffe.\x{a0} What do you wish?

Dorine.\x{a0} \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} To say . . .

Tartuffe [taking a handkerchief from his pocket].\x{a0} Wait!\x{a0} By our Savior,

Please!\x{a0} Before you speak take this handkerchief.

Dorine.\x{a0} Why?

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.

Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,

And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.

Dorine.\x{a0} Then you are quite ready for temptation,

And bare skin makes on you a big impression.

I truly don't know why you feel such passion;

I myself think lust is out of fashion,

For I could see you nude from top to toe

Without your pelt setting my cheeks aglow.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Put a little modesty in your discourse

Or I must leave you instantly perforce.

Dorine.\x{a0} No, it is I who will leave you here in peace,

And I will just say this before I cease:

Madam is coming down to visit you

And demands the favor of a rendezvous.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Oh yes!\x{a0} Most willingly!

Dorine [to herself].\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Isn't he sweet!

I'm even surer now that dog's in heat.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Will she soon come?

Dorine.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} I think I can hear her.

Yes, there.\x{a0} Now I will leave you two together.



SCENE III

Elmire, Tartuffe



Tartuffe.\x{a0} May Heaven forever in its great bounty

Grant you good health both in soul and body,

And bless your days as much as he desires

Who is the humblest of those your love inspires!

Elmire.\x{a0} I'm much obliged for your pious wishes, but please,

Let us be seated and put ourselves at ease.

Tartuffe [sitting down].\x{a0} Have you quite recovered from your illness?

Elmire [sitting as well].\x{a0} Yes, my headache quickly lost its sharpness.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} My prayers haven't enough value to buy

Such grace from the Heavenly One on High,

But most of my recent prayers have in essence

Been mainly focused on your convalescence.

Elmire.\x{a0} Your concern for me is somewhat disquieting.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I dearly cherish your precious well-being,

And to restore it I would have given my own.

Elmire.\x{a0} Such Christian charity is overblown,

But I am much obliged for all your care.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I try to do as much for you as I dare.

Elmire.\x{a0} I wish to speak of some private business

And am pleased there's no one to overhear us.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I, too, am delighted, and entre nous

It's very sweet being one-on-one with you.

For this also have I begged the Deity,

But only now has he granted it to me.

Elmire.\x{a0} I myself want an encounter between us two

Where your whole heart is opened through and through.



[Without exposing himself and in order to better hear the conversation, Damis opens the door of the closet in which he is hiding.]



Tartuffe.\x{a0} In exchange for this unique blessing, I

Desire only to reveal to you my

Whole soul, and to swear that all my preaching

About your guests--though perhaps over-reaching--

Was not caused by any anger or hate

But rather by a zeal that's passionate

And pure . . .

Elmire.\x{a0} I wholly understand and declare

My belief that you seek only my welfare.

Tartuffe [pressing the tips of her fingers].\x{a0} Yes, madam, it's true; my devotion is such . . .

Elmire.\x{a0} You're hurting me.

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Passion pushes me too much.

I never wanted to hurt you, I swear,

And I would rather . . .



[He puts his hand on her knee.]



Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Why is your hand there?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I'm feeling your dress.\x{a0} Such fine dimity!

Elmire.\x{a0} Oh!\x{a0} Please let me go.\x{a0} You're tickling me.



[She pushes her chair back, and Tartuffe moves his forward.]



Tartuffe [putting his hand on her lacy collar].

Dear Lord!\x{a0} But this workmanship is marvelous!

Lacework nowadays is miraculous.

I've never seen anything quite so fine.

Elmire.\x{a0} That's true.\x{a0} But let's speak of this concern of mine.

I hear that my husband may be breaking his word

And giving you his daughter.\x{a0} What have you heard?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} In truth, madam, some such words did transpire,

But that is not the joy to which I aspire,

And I see elsewhere those splendid attractions

Which I seek to attain through all of my actions.

Elmire.\x{a0} Then all your earthly love has been overthrown?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} My breast does not hold a heart made of stone.

Elmire.\x{a0} I'm sure that all your thoughts are on salvation,

And nothing less holds any fascination.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} The love that attracts us to what's eternal

Does not stop our love for the merely temporal.

Our senses can be quite easily charmed

By the perfect Earthly works that God has formed.

His glory is mirrored in those like you,

But in you yourself we see its rarest hue.

He has molded your face with such sublime art

That it surprises the eye and transports the heart,

And I can't gaze upon you, you perfect creature,

Without worshipping in you both God and nature,

And sensing in my soul an ardent love

For this, the most beautiful portrait by God above.

At first I feared that my secret passion

Might be a tricky trap laid by Satan,

And I even resolved to flee from your eyes

As if you were something to exorcise.

But I finally learned, oh beauty most lovable,

That my ardor for you could never be culpable,

That I should even consider it right,

And so I submit to my heart's delight.

I confess that I'm playing an audacious part

In presenting to you the gift of my heart,

But I place all my faith in your kindness

Like a beggar-man hindered by blindness.

In you I seek peace, hope, and happiness;

On you depends my torment or my bliss.

And through you alone I will finally be

Happy if you will, or sad if you please.

Elmire.\x{a0} That declaration is very urbane,

But in a man of God it's a bit profane.

You ought to protect your heart a bit better

And reflect more deeply on such a matter.

A saint like you whom we all hail . . .

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I may be holy, but I'm nonetheless male,

And when one sees your heavenly charms,

It's time for reason to throw up its arms.

I know such words from me may seem strange--though,

Madam, after all, I am not an angel,

And if you condemn the confession I'm making,

Admit nonetheless that your beauty's breath-taking.

From the first time I set eyes on your supreme

Splendor, my heart became yours and you my queen.

The ineffable sweetness of your divine gaze

Shattered my stout heart and set it ablaze.

That look conquered all--fasting, prayers, duty--

And turned my vows into praise of your beauty.

My eyes and my sighs have often shown my choice

But to make it still clearer I now add my voice.

If you should look down with a kindly eye

Upon the base woes of a slave such as I

And if your great kindness should happen to lead

You to stoop down and grant what I need,

I should always have for you, oh precious one,

A love that beggars all comparison.

With me your honor will never be damaged;

No disgrace can attend an affair I have managed.

All these gallants at court, for whom wives act absurd,

Are reckless in their deeds and rash in their words.

They endlessly brag about every success.

Each favor they receive, they quickly confess,

And their wagging tongues, on which you rely,

Dishonor the shrine before which they lie.

But men like me burn with a discreet fever,

And we keep your sweet secrets safe forever.

The concern we have for our good reputation

Will also preserve you in your own station;

In us you will find, if you wish it, my dear,

Love without scandal, pleasure without fear.

Elmire.\x{a0} I have heard your words, and your rhetoric

Leaves your point clear--though you lay it on thick.

Aren't you afraid that I could be in the mood

To tell my husband of your solicitude,

And that a sudden knowledge of that sort

Might set back your hopes of his lasting support?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I know that you are only too gracious

And that you will forgive my audacious

Deeds since they spring from a human failing

In that passionate love that you are bewailing,

And that you will reflect when you view things afresh

That I am not blind, and a man's only flesh.

Elmire.\x{a0} Others might take things differently, I suppose,

But discretion prevails, and I won't expose

This matter to my spouse.\x{a0} In return, it's true,

I do want one little favor from you:

To push forward without any sly snare

The wedding of Mariane and Valere,

To renounce on your own the unjust power

That would enrich you with another's dower,

And . . .



SCENE IV

Elmire, Damis, Tartuffe



Damis [coming out of the closet in which he was hiding].

No, madam, no.\x{a0} All this must be exposed.

By hiding here I've heard all he proposed,

And God in His goodness has guided me

To confound this noisome bastard's treachery,

To discover a way to take my vengeance

For his hypocrisy and insolence,

To wake up my father, and to justly screw

This scumbag who wants to make love to you.

Elmire.\x{a0} No, Damis.\x{a0} It's enough if he has striven

To reform and merit the pardon I've given.

Don't make me retract what I have avowed.

I don't choose to discuss scandal out loud:

A woman laughs at these masculine foibles,

And never plagues her mate with paltry troubles.

Damis.\x{a0} You have your own reasons for acting so,

And I have reasons for my quid-pro-quo.

The very thought of sparing him is a joke,

And the insolent pride of this base bloke

Has triumphed too often over my just wrath,

And has sown too much trouble along my path.

For too long that liar has ruled my old man

Blocking both my love and that of Mariane.

His perfidy must be brought to light of day,

And for that God gives us a ready way.

For this occasion I thank the good Lord;

It is far too lucky to be ignored.

The only way to deserve to lose it

Is to have it in hand and not to use it.

Elmire.\x{a0} But Damis . . .

Damis.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} No, please, my mind is made up.

It is time to rejoice and fill up the cup,

And you're trying in vain to obligate me

To give up the pleasure of my victory.

I'm going to expose this affair without delay;

This is just the thing that will make my day.



SCENE V

Orgon, Damis, Tartuffe, Elmire



Damis.\x{a0} Father, it may surprise . . . and amuse you greatly . . .

To hear the news of what's gone on lately.

You're being well paid for all your caresses

By your friend's response to those tendernesses.

His great love for you has shown its hold

Through his eagerness to make you a cuckold.

And I heard him here confess to your bride

A love that has made him heart-sick and dove-eyed.

At all costs she wants to remain discreet

And preserve his secret--because she's sweet--

But I cannot bear the man's impudence.

Besides, my silence would cause you offense.

Elmire.\x{a0} Yes, I would never disturb my husband's rest

By reporting the words of silly pest.

My honor does not depend on such a thing

Since I'm well able to resist flattering.

You wouldn't have spoken out against my view

If I had any power over you.



SCENE VI

Orgon, Damis, Tartuffe



Orgon. What do I hear?\x{a0} Good God!\x{a0} Is it credible?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Yes, brother, I'm wicked and culpable,

A sorry sinner, full of iniquity,

As great a wretch as there ever could be.

My entire life has been soiled with evil;

It's nothing but a mass of sinful upheaval.

And I see that God has, for my punishment,

Chosen to mortify me with this event.

Let them connect any crime with my name;

I waive all defense and take all the blame.

Believe what they tell you, stoke up your wrath,

And drive me like a felon from your path.

The shame that I bear cannot be too great,

For I know I deserve a much worse fate.

Orgon [to his son].\x{a0} Traitor! Do you dare, by your duplicity,

To taint both his virtue and purity?

Damis.\x{a0} What?\x{a0} Can the false meekness of this hypocrite

Cause you to belie . . .

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Shut up, you\x{a0} misfit.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Oh, let him go on.\x{a0} You are wrong to scold,

And you'd be wise to believe the story he's told.

In light of his claims, why should you favor me?

What do you know of my culpability?

Why put your faith in my exterior?

Why should you think that I'm superior?

No, no, appearances are fooling you,

I am the kind of man you should eschew.

The whole world thinks that I have earned God's blessing,

But the plain truth is . . . that I'm worth nothing.



[Addressing Damis]



Yes, my dear son, speak.\x{a0} And don't merely chide.

Accuse me of treason, theft, and homicide.

Call me every foul name you can recall.

I deny nothing.\x{a0} I merit it all.

And I beg on my knees to bear this chagrin

As the shameful result of my life of sin.

Orgon [To Tartuffe].\x{a0} That's too much, brother.\x{a0} [To his son]\x{a0} Why can't you let go,

Scoundrel?

Damis.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} What!\x{a0} Have his words seduced you so . . .

Orgon. Keep quiet, you bum!\x{a0} [To Tartuffe].\x{a0} Brother, please arise.

[To his son].\x{a0} Shame!

Damis.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He can . . .

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Silence!

Damis.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Damn!\x{a0} Do you surmise . . .

Orgon.\x{a0} If you say one word, I will break your arm.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} In the name of God, brother, do no harm.

I would rather face a ravening beast

Than that your dear son should be harmed in the least.

Orgon [to his son].\x{a0} Ingrate!

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Leave him in peace.\x{a0} On my two knees

I beg you to give him your grace . . .

Orgon [throwing himself to his knees and embracing Tartuffe].\x{a0} Don't!\x{a0} Please!

[To his son]\x{a0} Wretch, see his goodness.

Damis.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Then . . .

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Shhh!

Damis.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} I . . .

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Cease, I say.

I'm aware of your motive in this foray:

You all hate him, and now I see how my wife,

Children, and maid conspire against his life.

You impudently try every trick you can

To alienate me from this holy man,

But the harder you try to drive him away,

The harder I'll try to get him to stay.

And I'll hasten his marriage to Mariane

To demolish the pride of this whole clan.

Damis.\x{a0} So you will force her to marry this fellow?

Orgon.\x{a0} Yes, this very night, to see you bellow.

I defy you all, and stand here to say

I am the master and you must obey.

Come now.\x{a0} Retract your words, oh foul pollution!

Throw yourself down and demand absolution.

Damis.\x{a0} Who, me?\x{a0} Of that villain, by whose pretense . . .

Orgon.\x{a0} So you refuse, you scum, and your impertinence

Persists? [To Tartuffe]\x{a0} A stick!\x{a0} A staff!\x{a0} Don't hold me back.

[To his son] Get out of my house and don't even pack,

And never again let me see your face.

Damis.\x{a0} Yes, I will go, but . . .

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Quickly!\x{a0} Leave this place.

I am cutting you off and what is worse

I am leaving you with my heart-felt curse.



SCENE VII

Orgon, Tartuffe



Orgon.\x{a0} To offend in that way a saintly man!

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Heavenly Lord pardon him if you can.

[To Orgon.]\x{a0} If you only knew with what pain

I see them trying to blacken my name. . . .

Orgon.\x{a0} Alas!

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The mere thought of this ingratitude

Makes me suffer from a torture so crude . . .

The horror I feel . . . My soul longs to cry . . .

I can't even speak, and I'm sure I will die.

Orgon [He runs weeping to the door through which he had chased his son.]

Villain!\x{a0} How I regret that I held my hand

And that I did not crush you where you stand.

[To Tartuffe.]\x{a0} Calm yourself, brother and try not to fret.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Let's stop these squabbles that end in regret.

The great friction I have caused makes me grieve,

And I believe, brother, that I should leave.

Orgon.\x{a0} What?\x{a0} Surely you jest?

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} They hate me and I see

That they want you to doubt my integrity.

Orgon.\x{a0} Who cares!\x{a0} Do you think I'll listen to them?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} No doubt they'll continue their stratagem;

And the same tales that you reject today

You may find credible some other day.

Orgon.\x{a0} No, brother, never.

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Ah, brother, a man's mate

Can easily make her spouse speculate.

Orgon.\x{a0} No, no.

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Let me leave here at once and so

Escape the threat of another low blow.

Orgon.\x{a0} No, please remain.\x{a0} I can't live without you.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Well!\x{a0} I suppose I will suffer if I do.

Still, if you wish . . .

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Oh!

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} All right! It's a pact.

But in future I know how I must act.

Honor is tender, and friendship engages

Me to prevent gossip--however outrageous.

I'll avoid your wife and you will not see me . . .

Orgon.\x{a0} No, in spite of everyone, you and she

Must often meet.\x{a0} I love to make a stir,

So day and night let them see you with her.

No, that's not enough, but this will make them stew:

I don't want to have any heir but you,

And I'm going to legally designate

You as the owner of my whole estate.

A frank and true friend, whom I take as my son,

Is dearer to me than my wife or children.

Will you accept the offer I am making?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} May God's will be done in this undertaking!

Orgon.\x{a0} Poor man!\x{a0} Let's quickly put it all in writing,

And let their envy choke on its own spiting.





ACT IV

SCENE I

Cleante, Tartuffe



Cleante.\x{a0} Yes, the whole town is talking about it,

And they don't think it does you much credit.

And I've sought you out, sir, just for the sake

Of telling you bluntly what I think's at stake.

I'm not going to dredge up the whole dispute;

The fact is Damis is in disrepute.

Supposing that he did act like a fool

And that you are unfairly being called cruel,

Shouldn't a Christian pardon the offense

And purge his soul of desire for vengeance?

And should you permit him, for this one goof,

To be driven away from his father's roof?

I'll tell you again, and I'll be bold:

You are scandalizing both young and old.

If you take my advice, you will seek a truce

And not be a party to this boy's abuse.

Make an offering to God of your acrimony,

And restore the son to his patrimony.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Alas!\x{a0} As for myself, I seek that solace:

I do not have for him the slightest malice;

I wholly forgive him of any blame,

And long to restore him to his good name.

But in the service of God I can't permit

It, for if he remains I shall have to quit

This house.\x{a0} No prior offense holds a candle

To his.\x{a0} Our meeting would cause a huge scandal.

Lord only knows what people would assume!

They would impute it to cunning, I presume,

And say that my guilt has made me pretend

To excuse him of any intent to offend,

And that I fear him and wish to placate him

As a crafty move in my plan to checkmate him.

Cleante.\x{a0} I think you are making up excuses,

And your arguments, monsieur, seem like ruses.

Must you assume the role of the Deity?

Does He need us to punish the guilty?

Leave it to Him to take care of vengeance;

He bids us to forgive every offense

And not to consider human judgments

When we follow God's sovereign commandments.

What?\x{a0} Should the petty fear of what some may say

Prevent you from doing this good deed today?

No, let us always follow God's commands,

And leave all other matters in His hands.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I've told you already that I forgive

Him, and that, sir, is God's directive.

But after such scandal and vituperation

God doesn't demand our cohabitation.

Cleante.\x{a0} And does He demand that you lend your hand

To the pure caprice of the father's command

And accept the gift of his whole estate,

Which you cannot justly appropriate?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Those who know me will not believe that I'd

Do anything selfish or unjustified.

I hold worldly goods in quite low esteem.

I can't be dazzled by their phony gleam.

And if in the end I decide to take

The gift that the father wishes to make,

It is only, I swear, because I fear

That it could be left to a false profiteer,

Or that it could be shared by those who would

Use it to do evil rather than good,

And who would not use it, as I'm sure I can,

For the glory of God and one's fellow man.

Cleante.\x{a0} Oh, sir!\x{a0} Don't put on that scrupulous air

While your actions injure a rightful heir.

Don't feel uneasy or risk your good health

By fretting about the perils of his wealth.

It is better spent on a young man's whim

Than that you be accused of defrauding him.

I only wonder why you aren't ashamed

By this proposal in which you are named.

In true religion is there some dictum

That says it's okay to make an heir your victim?

And if God has put some obstacle in place

Against you and Damis sharing the same space,

Wouldn't you prefer to be more discrete

And leave this house in a noble retreat

Than to sit and see the son of the house

Thrust from his home like a beggarly louse.

Believe me, it would prove your probity,

Monsieur, . . .

Tartuffe.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It is now, Monsieur, <<half past three|10>>:

Certain religious rites demand my presence,

And you must excuse me for my absence. [He leaves.]

Cleante.\x{a0} Ah!



SCENE II

Elmire, Mariane, Dorine, Cleante



Dorine [to Cleante].\x{a0} Please, sir, help us help her, for pity's sake.

Her suffering is such that her heart may break,

And the pact her father made this evening

Is the cause of all this awful grieving.

Here he comes.\x{a0} Let's join forces, I beg you,

And try through skill or cunning to undo

The vicious scheme that's left us all so troubled.



Scene III

Orgon, Elmire, Mariane, Cleante, Dorine



Orgon.\x{a0} Ah!\x{a0} I'm pleased to see you all assembled.

[To Mariane]\x{a0} This contract here should make you very gay;

I'm sure you know what I'm about to say.

Mariane [kneeling].\x{a0} In the name of God, who knows how I hurt,

And of everything which might move your heart,

Forgo, for now, the rights of paternity

And release me from my vow of docility.

Do not reduce me by some brutal rule

To asking God why you've grown so cruel.

And this life, alas, that you gave to me--

Do not make it a life of misery.

If, contrary to all my sweet hopes of

Joy, you forbid me to wed the man I love,

Hear me at least--on my knees I implore

You not to give me to a man I abhor,

And don't push me past the point of despair

By using your full force in this affair.

Orgon [to himself, sensing himself weakening].

Be firm.\x{a0} This is no time for humanity!

Mariane.\x{a0} Your fondness for him doesn't bother me.

Indulge it, and if it's not enough to consign

Your whole estate to him--then give him mine!

I freely consent and will sign on demand,

But please, please, do not offer him my hand,

And allow me to live in a convent where I

May count the sad days till God lets me die.

Orgon.\x{a0} Young girls always play such religious pranks

When their fathers hobble their lusty flanks!

Get up!\x{a0} The harder you have to work to bear it,

The greater the virtue and the merit.

Let this marriage mortify your senses

And quit bothering me with your meek defenses.

Dorine.\x{a0} But . . .

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Keep quiet, and stay out of this matter.

I completely forbid you to add to the chatter.

Cleante.\x{a0} If you will allow me to offer some advice . . .

Orgon.\x{a0} Brother, your advice is worth any price:

It is thoughtful and I truly respect it,

But I hope you don't mind if I reject it.

Elmire [to her husband].\x{a0} What can I think about what you're saying

Except that your blindness is quite dismaying!

You must be besotted and led astray

To refuse to believe what has happened today.

Orgon.\x{a0} My dear, I only call 'em as I see 'em.

You favor my son, that worthless young bum,

And I think that you are afraid to condemn

His dirty trick on this most saintly of men.

You are, in fact, too calm to be believed;

You ought to have seemed a bit more aggrieved.

Elmire.\x{a0} When a love-sick man makes a foolish mistake

Must we take up arms as if honor's at stake?

And should we always respond to small slips

With fire in our eyes and abuse on our lips?

For myself, I laugh at these signs of lust;

It doesn't please me at all to grow nonplussed.

I seek wisdom tempered with charity,

And I'm not one of those prudes whose asperity

Is such that they fight for virtue tooth and nail,

And scratch a man's eyes out for being male.

Heaven preserve me from that kind of virtue!

I am an honest wife, but not a shrew,

And I believe that a calm, icy glance

Is quite enough to rebuff an advance.

Orgon.\x{a0} I know what I know and I won't change my mind.

Elmire.\x{a0} I'm again amazed that you could be so blind.

But would you keep that incredulity

If I made you see that we have spoken truly?

Orgon.\x{a0} See?

Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Yes.

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Fantasy!

Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} But if I found a way

To make you see it all in light of day?

Orgon.\x{a0} Fairy tales!

Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} What a man!\x{a0} At least reply.

I don't ask you to believe me, but I

Do wonder what you will say of your good man

If I bring you to a place where you can

Clearly see and hear these things?\x{a0} What then?

Orgon.\x{a0} In that case I would say . . . nothing again,

For it cannot be.

Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} You've been blind too long,

And in calling me a liar, you're wrong!

So for your pleasure, but with modesty,

I'll make you witness my veracity.

Orgon.\x{a0} Good.\x{a0} I take you at your word.\x{a0} Now let's see

How in the world you will prove this to me.

Elmire [to Dorine].\x{a0} Bid him come to me.

Dorine [to Elmire].\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He's a crafty one

And perhaps he won't easily be undone.

Elmire [to Dorine].\x{a0} No, we're easily duped by our affection,

And vanity aids in our misdirection.



[Speaking to Cleante and Mariane]



Send him down here to me.\x{a0} And you can go.





SCENE IV

Elmire, Orgon



Elmire.\x{a0} Bring the table here, and then crouch down low.

Orgon.\x{a0} Why?

Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Hiding you well is to be desired.

Orgon.\x{a0} Why under the table?

Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Just do what's required!

I've made my plans and we'll see how they fare!

Get under the table, and when you're down there,

Don't let him see you and try not to grunt.

Orgon.\x{a0} I really think I'm far too tolerant,

But I'll stay through the end of your stratagem.

Elmire.\x{a0} You won't, I'm sure, have a thing to condemn.



[To her husband, who is now under the table.]



Mind you, I'm going to have strange things to say

And you must not be shocked in any way.

Whatever I may say, you must allow;

I only wish to convince you, anyhow.

I'm going to use sex, since I'm reduced to it,

To strip off the cloak of this hypocrite;

I'll stoke up the fires of his insolent heart

And give a free field to this base upstart.

For your sake, and to deepen his disrepute,

I'm going to pretend to welcome his suit.

I'll quit just as soon as you've heard enough.

Things needn't go farther than you wish, my love.

And you must stop them from becoming bizarre

When you think his mad love has gone too far.

Spare your wife and don't leave me in his hands

Longer than reaching your conviction demands.

This is your concern and you are in command.

Here he comes.\x{a0} Keep still! Keep down! Understand?



SCENE V

Tartuffe, Elmire, Orgon (under the table)



Tartuffe.\x{a0} You wish to speak with me in here, I'm told.

Elmire.\x{a0} Yes. I now have some secrets to unfold,

But shut the door before I say a word

And look around--we mustn't be overheard.



[Tartuffe closes the door and returns.]



I don't want another fracas to ensue

Like the one that overtook us hitherto.

Never before have I been so dismayed!

Damis startled me and made me afraid

For you.\x{a0} You must have seen that I did my best

To disrupt his plan and soothe his unrest.

It is true that I was so filled with shame

That I never thought of denying his claim,

But by the grace of God, I'm nearly sure

All is for the best and we're now more secure.

The prestige of your name has dispelled the storm,

And my husband will never suspect you of harm.

Defying those with rumors to foment,

He wants us together at every moment.

And that is why without blame I can

Be alone with you although you're a man,

And that allows me to open my heart

Willingly to the sweet thoughts you impart.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I find it odd that you have kind words to say;

Earlier you treated me in a different way.

Elmire.\x{a0} Ah!\x{a0} If you're angry about that rebuff,

You know nothing about a woman's love!

And how little you know about our intent

If you think a weak defense is really meant!

At such times our modesty must contend

With the tender feelings that triumph in the end.

No matter how strongly you make love's claim,

In embracing it we always feel some shame.

We resist at first, but in our faces

It's clear that we'll soon yield to your embraces.

Our words and our wishes are often opposed:

A refusal may mean we accept what's proposed.

No doubt I am making too free a confession

And I may be committing an indiscretion,

But since my attempt at silence has gone awry,

Ask yourself why I sought to pacify

Damis, and what made me listen so long

And so kindly to your sweet love song?

Would I have reacted as you saw me do

If the offer of your heart didn't please me too?

And what should you be able to conclude

From my fervent desire to preclude

The marriage that has been announced just now?

Isn't it that I'd hate for a wedding vow

To come between us, and that I care for you

And want nothing at all to split us in two?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} There is no pleasure in Heaven above

Sweeter than such words from the lips I love;

Their honeyed sound flows richly through my senses

With the sweetness of the purest essences.

The pleasure of pleasing you is my one goal,

And my heart finds happiness in that role,

But that heart also takes the slight liberty

Of daring to doubt this felicity.

Perhaps these sweet words are a decorous ruse

Designed to disrupt my hymeneal news;

And, if I may speak quite freely with you,

I won't believe that all you say is true

Until I'm assured that you couldn't lie

By a few of those favors for which I sigh.

Such favors would make me your devotee

And a true believer in your fondness for me.

Elmire [she coughs to warn her husband].

Do you demand to push on with such great speed,

And drain my heart dry by your burning need?

I risk my life in proclaiming my love,

And for you even that is not enough!

Can't you be satisfied with what I say?

Must you force me into going all the way?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} The less one merits, the more one desires.

Mere words will never quench our raging fires.

A promised gift is often suspected;

We rarely believe it, until we inspect it.

I, who so little merit your favors,

Doubt the happy outcome of my labors.

And I will not believe a thing, my dear,

Until you ease my pain to prove you're sincere.

Elmire.\x{a0} Good God, your love is too oppressive;

It troubles my soul and becomes obsessive!

What a crazy power it has on the heart!

With what fierce passion it tears me apart!

What!\x{a0} Is there no way to stave off your desire?

Won't you give me a moment to respire?

Do you think it is fair to be so firm,

To demand everything and watch me squirm,

To take what you want, pushing and pressing,

And abusing my weakness in acquiescing?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} If you look on me with a kindly heart,

Then prove how you feel by playing your part.

Elmire.\x{a0} But how can I give you the things you seek

Without offending that God of whom you speak?

Tartuffe.\x{a0} If it's only God that opposes my desire,

I'll think up a way to make him conspire,

And that need not restrain your heart, my dear.

Elmire.\x{a0} But the decrees of God scare me to tears.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} I can dispel your foolish fears, madame,

For I know the art of quashing each qualm.

Though God forbids certain gratifications,

With him one can reach one's accommodations.

It is a science to stretch out the strings

Of conscience in the service of diverse things

And to rectify an evil action

With the purity of our intention.

Regarding these secrets, I shall instruct you;

You need only allow me to conduct you.

Satisfy my desire and have no fear;

I'll assume the sin and leave your soul clear.



[Elmire coughs more loudly.]



That's quite a cough, madame.

Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Yes, it's a torment.

Tartuffe [offering Elmire a piece of candy].

Would it help to have a licorice or mint?

Elmire.\x{a0} It's an obstinate illness, and I see

That all the mints in the world won't help me

Tartuffe.\x{a0} It's certainly troublesome.

Elmire.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} That's for sure!

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Your scruples at least are easy to cure:

You can be sure that I will keep things quiet--

A deed is evil only if men spy it.

The noise of scandal is the source of offense;

There is no sin if one sins in silence.

Elmire [after having coughed and knocked on the table].

At last I see I'm forced to go astray,

And I must consent to let you have your way,

And that I cannot hope that short of the deed

You will be content and willing to concede.

It is very hard to be forced to do it,

And in spite of myself to stoop down to it;

But since you persist in making me obey,

Since you refuse to believe what I say,

And since you demand more convincing proof,

I'll have to give in and quit acting aloof.

If this action causes anyone grief,

The blame be on him who refused all relief.

The fault most certainly is none of mine.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Yes, madame, I agree and that is fine . . .

Elmire.\x{a0} Peek out of the door and see, I beg you,

If my spouse is spying on our rendezvous.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} Why do you care what he sees or where he goes?

He's a man who loves to be led by the nose.

Our trysts are something he's proud of achieving,

And he'd watch us go to it without believing.

Elmire.\x{a0} No matter.\x{a0} Please, go have a look outside;

I'd hate to think he's found some place to hide.



SCENE VI

Orgon, Elmire



Orgon [coming out from under the table].\x{a0} There, I swear, is an abominable man!

I can't get over it.\x{a0} What is his plan?

Elmire.\x{a0} How now?\x{a0} Come out so soon?\x{a0} Were you having fun?

Get back down there.\x{a0} We've only just begun.

Wait till the end to be completely sure,

And don't put your faith in mere conjecture.

Orgon.\x{a0} No man more evil has been spawned in Hell.

Elmire.\x{a0} Dear Lord!\x{a0} Don't believe the lies people tell.

Be wholly convinced before you concede:

Cautious men shun the slips that come with speed.



[She pushes her husband behind her.]



SCENE VII

Tartuffe, Elmire, Orgon



Tartuffe [without seeing Orgon].\x{a0} All things conspire, madame, for my contentment:

I've closely examined the whole apartment;

No one is around, and my heart's delight. . .



[Just as Tartuffe comes forward with open arms to embrace Elmire, she steps back and Tartuffe sees Orgon.]



Orgon [stopping him].\x{a0} Hold on!\x{a0} Your desires are too quick to ignite,

And you mustn't let passion be overdone.

Oh!\x{a0} Man of blessings, you wished to give me one!

How temptation has taken over your life!

You'd marry my daughter, and covet my wife!

I've doubted your word for quite a long while,

And I've always believed you'd change your style;

But this is enough to give me my proof:

I am fed up and want no more, Tartuffe.

Elmire [to Tartuffe].\x{a0} It was against my will to act this way,

But I was forced into the part I play.

Tartuffe [to Orgon].\x{a0} What?\x{a0} You think . . .

Orgon.\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Come, please, let's have no to-do.

Get out of my home without more ado.

Tartuffe.\x{a0} My intent . . .",
          ],
        ];
