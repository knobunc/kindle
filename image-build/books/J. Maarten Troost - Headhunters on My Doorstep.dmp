I spoke to a Frenchman who had been a ship\x{2019}s pilot on R\x{e9}union Island, retired, and now was traveling with his wife for two months throughout French Polynesia and ruminating on whether or not to take a house on Moorea for another three. Meanwhile, one of the Italians on board was forever standing and falling on the rest of us as he tried to take pictures from a speedboat that was rocking along as fast as its twin engines could take it.

He was of the type who dawdle on the sidewalk, five abreast, at <<6:00 P.M.|2a>> as everyone else rushes to catch a subway, or who drive thirty-five mph in the fast lane, making phone calls and texting, as others swerve around him, giving him the bird, which he never ever sees.

The mahu are physically male but, since time immemorial, have been raised as females. Often it was the eldest boy, who was groomed to help with the household chores, including cooking and tending to the younger siblings. Some eventually grew out of being the designated mahu and eventually married and had children of their own. Many, however, whether due to nature or nuture, embraced the designation. Polynesians, notoriously, have a very elastic sense of sexuality and if a man hooked up with the village mahu, it wasn\x{2019}t a gay thing or a straight thing, but just kind of an island thing. In other cultures, of course, effeminate boys are bullied and jeered, but not so in Tahiti, which, like elsewhere in Polynesia, long ago acknowledged that some are men or women and some are neither and both. Today, the mahu are mahu by choice and many have breast implants and wear dresses and sashay and are so over the top in their femininity that they could only be really campy men.

Tuberculosis, pneumonia, plague, smallpox, elephantitis, syphilis, and a host of other ailments decimated the indigenous population of the South Pacific.

Well, it certainly wasn\x{2019}t for lack of trying. My tolerance, always high, now increased exponentially, and yet I\x{2019}d never hit the sweet spot, the moment when I was suffused with a cheery warmth. Within a few short years, though, I\x{2019}d undergo the physiological change that marks the terminal alcoholic. I\x{2019}d become dependent on the drink. I never developed the shakes. I never drank while I worked. But come <<3:00|2>>, <<4:00 P.M.|2a>> my head would feel like a belt was rapidly tightening around it, my anxiety levels would skyrocket, my usual mellow disposition would undergo a Dr. Jekyll\x{2013}like transformation, and I\x{2019}d become a short-tempered asshole until I\x{2019}d had a drink or ten, and suddenly I\x{2019}d feel \x{201c}normal,\x{201d} no better, no worse.",

            "So to say that I was eager to get off the boat and commit to some hardy endorphin-stimulating exercise would be an understatement. That intense craving I\x{2019}d had just a few days prior left me tremulous with worry. It would be so easy, I knew, to relapse here, on a small ship in the middle of nowhere, filled with people drinking from <<noon|13>> to night, like vacationers without a worry in the world, passing the time over long wine-soaked lunches and dinners because there wasn\x{2019}t much else to do. This, I knew, was not an ideal milieu for me. From time to time, my brain would zap me a message: Hey, it said, how about we change our no-drinking rule to no-drinking-on-terra-firma? That could work, right? That would free up boats, airplanes, and inner tubes. What do you say? After a few days of this, I was fairly frothing like a racehorse locked in the gate, looking forward to nothing more than a long trek on a dirt trail.",

            "The first Westerner to spot the island was the Spanish explorer \x{c1}lvaro de Menda\x{f1}a, who named the islands after his benefactor, the viceroy Las Marquesas de Mendoza, in 1595. Luckily for the Fatu Hivans he never made it to shore, which was most fortunate, because in the northern Marquesas, he had a habit of shooting locals on sight, while spending his downtime infecting hundreds of women with syphilis, and marking the occasion of his visit to what he thought was the fabled gold-laden kingdom of Solomon with three enormous crosses on the island of Tahuata. It wasn\x{2019}t until <<1825|18:0>> that the first Westerner set foot on Fatu Hiva, and it would take another fifty years until missionaries succeeded in converting the locals to Catholicism. By then, of course, the decimation of the population had begun in earnest, and the surviving remnants, mostly young adults\x{2014}the diseases had carried away the small and the old\x{2014}abandoned their hillside villages to settle into the two remaining coastal hamlets. Today, deep in the forests of Fatu Hiva and the other Marquesan islands, hundreds of ancient villages lie dormant and undisturbed, reclaimed by nature, hovered over by ghosts.",
