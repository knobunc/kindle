Some of its pages can be read only <<after midnight|13>>, or by strange and improbable illuminations. There are descriptions of underground constellations and wines as yet unfermented (see RE-ANNUAL PLANTS). For the really up-to-the-epoch occultist, who can afford the version bound in spider skin, there is even an insert showing the London Underground with three stations they never dare show on public maps.

Teachers and librarians say things like: \x{2018}Your books are really popular among children who don\x{2019}t read.\x{2019} I think I know what they mean, I just wish they\x{2019}d put it a different way.",
