Roger was the serious, thoughtful worrier\x{2014}the sort who was constantly looking to the future, trying to anticipate oncoming storms and shape his course to deal with them. Caitrin wasn\x{2019}t really the mental gadabout she often liked to portray, but there was no denying that she was far more inclined to take things as they came rather than rushing to meet them.",

They\x{2019}d managed to provide their own equivalent of the Havenite Basic Living Stipend without completely destroying their economies\x{2019} competitiveness and productivity, and they\x{2019}d managed to pay for their social programs without plunging themselves ever further into debt, but they\x{2019}d done it only by radically changing their spending goals and policies.

Despite the century of research between their discovery and Axelrod\x{2019}s attack on the Star Kingdom in 1543 PD, no other multi-terminus wormhole had ever been discovered. Wormhole theory and astrogation were still in the early stages of formulation, and most theoreticians had dismissed the possibility of such phenomena as possessing a very low order of probability. Even after the Manticore Wormhole Junction\x{2019}s discovery had forced a reconsideration of that belief, its sheer size and strength made the task of properly surveying it a formidable one.",

            "The only real challenge to the Manticoran monarchy came in 1721 PD with the so-called \x{201c}Gryphon Uprising,\x{201d} which remains the most serious internal dissent the Star Kingdom has been forced to confront. Gryphon, the least congenial of the three habitable planets of the Manticore System, had, by far, the smallest share of First Shareholder families. The bulk of its aristocracy came from the Second Shareholders, who, for the most part, had substantially less credit than First Shareholders and so received smaller \x{201c}Clear Grants\x{201d} (that is, land to which clear title was granted prior to improvements by the owner/tenant). The Crown, however, had established the principle of \x{201c}Crown Range\x{201d} (land in the public domain and free for the use of any individual) to encourage emigration to Gryphon. By <<1715|9:0>> PD, the population of Gryphon had grown to the level set under the Crown Range Charter of 1490, so the Crown began phasing out the Crown Range, granting title on the basis of improvements made. That\x{2019}s when the trouble began. Yeomen who hoped to become independent ranchers, farmers, or miners claimed that the planetary nobility was using strong-arm tactics to force them off the land. Something very like a shooting war erupted between these \x{201c}squatters\x{201d} and \x{201c}the children of shareholders.\x{201d} After two years of increasingly bloody unrest, the Gryphon Range Commission was established in 1717 with extraordinary police powers and a mandate to suppress open violence and reach a settlement. Its final finding was that there was a sound foundation to the yeomen\x{2019}s original complaints and the Manticoran Army, having pacified and stabilized the situation, then oversaw a closely regulated privatization of the Crown Range. There remains some hostility between small landholders and certain of the noble families, although it has become something of a tradition rather than a source of active hostility for the majority of the population.",

During the locust years of the Janacek Admiralty, the Office of Technology began to form its own relationships with Alliance navies and had established robust channels of communication independent of the RMN by the time the war resumed.',

Unfortunately, the lack of room for additional missile storage reduced the number of salvoes per launcher from <<eight to six|10a:0>>. Defenses include dual gravitically driven point defense autocannon as chasers and an additional autocannon on the broadsides. These autocannon were imported ex-Solarian weapons. Grayson industry was as yet unable to construct such weapons, but the GSN was able to acquire them from Solarian reclamation yards as the SLN converted to laser clusters in more recent construction. Although the autocannon were more volume intensive than the cruder, electromagnetically driven Grayson weapons, they required much less volume and a lower energy budget than laser clusters would have, while their higher rate of fire and muzzle velocity remained more than adequate for dealing with then state-of-the-art Masadan shipkillers.',

Incorporated into an amendment to the Solarian League Constitution, the Edict obligated the Solarian League Navy to punish\x{2014}effectively, to destroy\x{2014}the government of any star nation guilty of genocidal attack (including any use of proscribed biological, chemical, or nanotech weapons) or planetary bombardment of nonmilitary targets. In the case of pirates or brigands guilty of the same offense, the Eridani Edict classified them as \x{201c}general enemies of all mankind\x{201d} and authorized SLN warships and officers to summarily execute the offenders. In the case of \x{201c}rogue states,\x{201d} the government responsible for authorizing the Eridani violation was to be dissolved and replaced with one overseen and administered by the Office of Frontier Security until such time as the League could be confident the offense would not be repeated. Individual members of the government that authorized the violation were subject to arrest and prosecution in Solarian courts, and faced imprisonment and even execution. By <<1800|9:0>> PD, many non-Solarian star systems had come to the view that the Solarian League was utilizing its role as guardian and enforcer of the Eridani Edict as a tool to empower its own imperial expansion.

Although the Haven System lay over 250 light-years from the Manticore Binary System, the Star Kingdom\x{2019}s wealth and the strategic prize of its wormhole junction (see below) meant that Manticoran strategists must consider the threat which the expanding borders of the People\x{2019}s Republic posed to their own security.

            "The introduction of missile pods near the beginning of the war fundamentally altered naval tactics. No longer would ships of the wall slug it out in protracted duels that might begin at long range but must culminate in the inevitable short-range pounding match. Instead, with the massive opening salvos made possible by the pods (themselves largely unarmored and hence vulnerable to destruction), the opening salvo of an engagement was often the only salvo. Initially, pods were towed on tractors behind existing ships, but beginning in <<about 1910|18:0>> PD, the Manticoran introduction of the multidrive missile, married to the use of pods, completely transformed the nature of combat and hence of the platforms best optimized for it. With the arrival of the MDM, the energy-armed superdreadnought became hopelessly obsolete, and the resulting total redesign produced the \x{201c}podnought,\x{201d} or SD(P): a hollow-cored design intended to deploy pods of very large, very capable, very long ranged, and very lethal missiles in the largest possible numbers. The possession of that weapon and those ships gave the RMN an overwhelming advantage, which brought the first phase of the Havenite Wars to a disastrous conclusion for the People\x{2019}s Republic in 1914\x{2013}1915 PD.",

            "Throughout the period of hostilities, the RMN made strenuous and largely successful efforts to meet its manning requirements through voluntary enlistments. It succeeded in large part because of the high premium the Star Kingdom\x{2019}s citizens placed upon military service and the preservation of their independence after the long, agonizing buildup of the sixty-year-long \x{201c}Cold War\x{201d} between the People\x{2019}s Republic and the Star Kingdom and its allies. Good pay, good benefits, significant technical training opportunities, and the opportunity for promotion and advancement inherent in the steadily expanding Navy also helped attract quality personnel. By <<1914|9e:1>>, the Navy was seriously considering conscription, but the adoption of increased shipboard automation drastically curtailed manning requirements, which eased much of the pressure. There were countervailing pressures, of course, including the adoption of large numbers of new, highly capable light attack craft, but the enormous ships\x{2019} companies required by prewar ships of the wall had become a thing of the past, and the Navy\x{2019}s ability to stand down the forts covering the Manticoran Wormhole Junction following the liberation of Trevor\x{2019}s Star freed up a very substantial manpower pool.",

            "By the time the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the People\x{2019}s Republic of Haven actually met in combat, both sides had been actively preparing for over half a T-century. In theory, the level of readiness\x{2014}both for the fleet and for its \x{201c}shore establishment\x{201d}\x{2014}was very high on both sides. Indeed, the peacetime ammunition loadout for the Royal Manticoran Navy was identical to its wartime loadout, and from 1880 PD on, personnel strengths aboard Manticoran warships were maintained at one hundred percent of wartime manning requirements. The People\x{2019}s Navy was at a lower level of manning, and although it was theoretically at the same level in terms of mat\x{e9}riel, it was, in fact, probably at no more than eighty-five percent of Manticoran levels of readiness prior to <<about 1904|18:0>> PD. At that point, in the Legislaturalists\x{2019} deliberate buildup to hostilities against Manticore, readiness was increased to very nearly the same level as in the RMN. One effect of the increase in personnel, however, was to dilute the experience levels of its units on the very verge of war by the introduction of so many newly trained personnel. This was exacerbated by the PRH\x{2019}s educational deficiencies, since it took a proportionately longer time for Havenite personnel to acquire the necessary expertise.",

            "Prior to the emergence of the People\x{2019}s Republic of Haven, the Star Kingdom\x{2019}s relations with Haven were actually very good. While it was the Junction which accommodated so much of the population movement into the Haven Sector, Haven was actually settled around a century before the Star Kingdom, thanks to the emergence of the impeller drive and Warshawski sail, which allowed the initial Haven colony expedition to overtake and pass the sublight Manticore colony ship Jason. It was a well-financed expedition, the quadrant contained a higher than average concentration of desirable star types, it established a vigorous economy and an attractive political system, and it aggressively and actively sought to bolster and support follow-on waves of settlers. As a consequence, it was seen as the \x{201c}Athens of the Verge\x{201d} by many, including the Star Kingdom of Manticore. Manticore had never had the population Haven did and, prior to the discovery of the Junction, was essentially an out-of-the-way star system which didn\x{2019}t go out of its way to draw attention to itself or (after the Plague Years, at least) actively seek to promote immigration. By the time the Junction was discovered, Manticore had become accustomed to thinking of Haven as the \x{201c}way of the future,\x{201d} and it took some centuries for the Star Kingdom to begin to recognize the true nature of the commanding economic and strategic advantage the Junction conferred upon it. There was no Manticoran merchant marine, really, before the Junction was surveyed in the 1580s, and by <<1650|9e:1>>, the Republic had begun its slide into the People\x{2019}s Republic, although that didn\x{2019}t become readily apparent to the outside galaxy for quite some time and immigration into the Republic actually increased rather dramatically once the Junction gave access to Beowulf. During that seventy-year window, the Star Kingdom became an ever more potent economic force, building its merchant marine and coming to decisively dominate the carrying trade of the Haven Sector (including the transport of quite a few of those Haven-bound immigrants). What was not immediately apparent to either Manticore or Haven was that in the process, the Star Kingdom was replacing the Republic as the region\x{2019}s dominating economic power.",
