The Veronica Lake hairdo was not yet in fashion and she wore her hair in that style too awful ever to have been revived, the front rolled up and back into a sausage, the back hanging loose. Eden's beauty could not be spoiled by it. To me it seemed wonderfully chic. She had a gymslip on, a plain, round-neck pinafore, not one of the old box-pleated kind, a dark red blazer with her school crest on the pocket, and hanging from one shoulder, her satchel. She kissed me and called me her little niece in a very kindly way, asked me how my parents were \x{2013} Vera had forgotten to mention my mother but Eden did not \x{2013} and said she hoped the train journey had been pleasant. Then she went away to her room, emerging ten minutes afterwards with powder on her nose and lipstick on her lips, her school tunic changed for a skirt and blouse. She seemed even older. We sat down to Vera's enormous tea, working our way through sandwiches and cakes and buns, and tea was always to be the principal meal of the day, this first one being no festive exception. It seems strange to me now to think of those teas, the bread and butter and mountains of sweet food we ate, at least four rounds of bread each, at least one slice of cake, a series of small buns, slices, biscuits, cupcakes. None of us put on weight or came out in spots. And we ate like that every day as a matter of course at <<five o'clock|6>>, Vera encouraging Eden and now me to stuff ourselves, saying it was all good, wholesome and home-made food. She seemed to have the idea that everything bought in a shop was bad for you and everything made at home good for you, a widely held view responsible, no doubt, for many an untimely death.",

I called him \x{2018}a master at\x{2019} Balliol because I thought I had misheard and if he was head of a college he would have been called a headmaster, an error for which I again got the rough side of Vera's tongue.",

Routine-driven, I thought, everything done by the clock, a fanatical emphasis on hygiene, cot sheets ironed as well as laundered and napkins, too, I wouldn\'t have been surprised. He could not disappear at bed-time and be hunted through the house and streets but it could be impressed upon his infant ears that <<six o\'clock|6>> was the crucial hour, the point in time after which no well-conditioned baby should be out of his cot.',

            "Sunny, however, she is said to have disliked. It is hard to imagine a beautiful, healthy, comfortably situated girl of seventeen disliking her two-year-old half-sister, especially as the child was known for her easy disposition and \x{2018}sunny\x{2019} temperament. On the other hand, two things about Sunny might, if we are to see May as paranoid, or a near-psychopath, have inspired a pathological dislike in her. She bore an extraordinarily close resemblance to her mother, Mrs Irene Durham, and she was adored by her father to the extent perhaps of displacing May in his affections. Georgina Hallam-Saul, the only writer to have dealt at any length with the Kirby Theiston case, put forward a curious postulation. This is that in the early part of the twentieth century, more specifically from <<1910|9c:0>> till <<about 1940|18:0>>, there was a definite cult of aligning blondeness with beauty, so that a dark-haired woman was considered less well-favoured than a fair one, often irrespective of other claims to beauty such as feature, figure or eye colour. Now May Durham, as has been said, was dark-haired and with very dark colouring, olive skin, brown eyes. She favoured her mother. Charles Durham inclined to fairness, his second wife was a very fair, pale-skinned blonde and their daughter Sunny had golden hair and blue eyes. Miss Hallam-Saul suggests this as a cause of envy and resentment on May's part of her half-sister but Miss Hallam-Saul, of course, is committed to her theory of May as perpetrator.",

She spent the night before the wedding at Laurel Cottage and Vera was the first to see her dressed in this amazing confection with its tight bodice and sleeves and huge skirt. A girl who worked for a local hairdresser (and who lived with her parents in Inkerman Terrace next door to the house that had been the Marches\') came at <<nine in the morning|9a>> to do her hair first and then Vera\'s. My hair, being very long and straight, didn\'t need doing. The night before, it had been quite like old times, Francis sleeping in the room on the other side of the landing, Eden and I sharing her room, the beds still as far removed from each other as possible. When she opened one of the drawers in the dressing-table to hunt about for a pair of eyebrow tweezers, guilt got hold of me and I wondered if she had ever noticed my incursions into her privacy, if I had left a long, brown hair behind or the marks of none-too-clean twelve-year-old fingers. But it was soon apparent that she had discarded every cosmetic and perfume that dressing-table had contained. She had gone up the scale now and nothing but top-rank French toiletries would do for her. But her sophistication did not extend to the appointments of the room.
