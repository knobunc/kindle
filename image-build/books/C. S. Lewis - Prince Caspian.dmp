            "After that they went on till they came among tall beech trees and Trufflehunter called out, \x{201c}Pattertwig! Pattertwig! Pattertwig!\x{201d} and almost at once, bounding down from branch to branch till he was just above their heads, came the most magnificent red squirrel that Caspian had ever seen. He was far bigger than the ordinary dumb squirrels which he had sometimes seen in the castle gardens; indeed he was nearly the size of a terrier and the moment you looked in his face you saw that he could talk. Indeed the difficulty was to get him to stop talking, for, like all squirrels, he was a chatterer. He welcomed Caspian at once and asked if he would like a nut and Caspian said thanks, he would. But as Pattertwig went bounding away to fetch it, Trufflehunter whispered in Caspian\x{2019}s ear, \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t look. Look the other way. It\x{2019}s very bad manners among squirrels to watch anyone going to his store or to look as if you wanted to know where it was.\x{201d} Then Pattertwig came back with the nut and Caspian ate it and after that Pattertwig asked if he could take any messages to other friends. \x{201c}For I can go nearly everywhere without setting foot to ground,\x{201d} he said. Trufflehunter and the Dwarfs thought this a very good idea and gave Pattertwig messages to all sorts of people with queer names telling them all to come to a feast and council on Dancing Lawn at <<midnight|13>> three nights ahead. \x{201c}And you\x{2019}d better tell the three Bulgies too,\x{201d} added Trumpkin. \x{201c}We forgot to mention it to them.\x{201d}",

There was an animal roaring, a clash of steel; the boys and Trumpkin rushed in; Peter had a glimpse of a horrible, gray, gaunt creature, half man and half wolf, in the very act of leaping upon a boy about his own age, and Edmund saw a badger and a Dwarf rolling on the floor in a sort of cat fight. Trumpkin found himself face to face with the Hag. Her nose and chin stuck out like a pair of nutcrackers, her dirty gray hair was flying about her face and she had just got Doctor Cornelius by the throat.

In between, a square space of level grass had been staked for the combat. At the two far corners stood Glozelle and Sopespian with drawn swords. At the near corners were Giant Wimbleweather and the Bulgy Bear, who in spite of all their warnings was sucking his paws and looking, to tell the truth, uncommonly silly. To make up for this, Glenstorm on the right of the lists, stock-still except when he stamped a hind hoof occasionally on the turf, looked much more imposing than the Telmarine baron who faced him on the left. Peter had just shaken hands with Edmund and the Doctor, and was now walking down to the combat. It was like the moment before the pistol goes at an important race, but very much worse.",

            "Next day messengers (who were chiefly squirrels and birds) were sent all over the country with a proclamation to the scattered Telmarines\x{2014}including, of course, the prisoners in Beruna. They were told that Caspian was now King and that Narnia would henceforth belong to the Talking Beasts and the Dwarfs and Dryads and Fauns and other creatures quite as much as to the men. Any who chose to stay under the new conditions might do so; but for those who did not like the idea, Aslan would provide another home. Anyone who wished to go there must come to Aslan and the Kings at the Ford of Beruna by <<noon|13>> on the fifth day. You may imagine that this caused plenty of head-scratching among the Telmarines. Some of them, chiefly the young ones, had, like Caspian, heard stories of the Old Days and were delighted that they had come back. They were already making friends with the creatures. These all decided to stay in Narnia. But most of the older men, especially those who had been important under Miraz, were sulky and had no wish to live in a country where they could not rule the roost. \x{201c}Live here with a lot of blooming performing animals! No fear,\x{201d} they said. \x{201c}And ghosts too,\x{201d} some added with a shudder. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s what those there Dryads really are. It\x{2019}s not canny.\x{201d} They were also suspicious. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t trust \x{2019}em,\x{201d} they said. \x{201c}Not with that awful Lion and all. He won\x{2019}t keep his claws off us long, you\x{2019}ll see.\x{201d} But then they were equally suspicious of his offer to give them a new home. \x{201c}Take us off to his den and eat us one by one most likely,\x{201d} they muttered. And the more they talked to one another the sulkier and more suspicious they became. But on the appointed day more than half of them turned up.",

Everything became much brighter, and after a few steps they found themselves at the edge of the wood, looking down on a sandy beach. A few yards away a very calm sea was falling on the sand with such tiny ripples that it made hardly any sound. There was no land in sight and no clouds in the sky.

Eating hot fish with no forks, and one pocket-knife between five people, is a messy business and there were several burnt fingers before the meal was ended; but, as it was now <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>> and they had been up since five, nobody minded the burns so much as you might have expected. When everyone had finished off with a drink from the well and an apple or so, the Dwarf produced a pipe about the size of his own arm, filled it, lit it, blew a great cloud of fragrant smoke, and said, \x{201c}Now.\x{201d}",
