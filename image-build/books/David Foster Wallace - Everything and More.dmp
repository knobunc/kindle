            "The tactical reason for sometimes using \x{2018}\x{221e}\x{2019} instead of \x{2018}infinity\x{2019} in the natural-language text here is that the double-blink strangeness of \x{2018}\x{221e}\x{2019} serves as a reminder that it\x{2019}s not clear what we\x{2019}re even talking about. Not yet. For instance, beware of thinking that \x{221e} is just an incredibly, unbelievably enormous number. There are, of course, many such numbers, especially in physics and astronomy\x{2014}like, if in physics an ultranano-instant of 5 \x{d7} 10\x{2212}44 seconds is generally acknowledged to be the smallest time-interval in which the normal concept of continuous time applies (which it is), astronomical data indicates that there have been roughly 6 \x{d7} 1060 such ultranano-instants since the Big Bang. That\x{2019}s a 6 followed by 60 zeroes. We\x{2019}ve all heard about numbers like this, which we usually imagine can be conceived and manipulated only with really advanced super-cooled computers or something. Actually, there are plenty of numbers too big for any real or even theoretical computer to process. Bremermann\x{2019}s Limit is the operative term here. Given limits imposed by basic quantum theory, one H. Bremermann proved in 1962 that \x{201c}No data processing system, whether artificial or living, can process more than 2 \x{d7} 1047 bits per second per gram of its mass,\x{201d} which means that a hypothetical supercomputer the size of the earth (= c. 6 \x{d7} 1027 grams) grinding away for as long as the earth has existed (= about 1010 years, with c. <<3.14|5a:0>> \x{d7} 107 seconds/year) can have processed at most <<2.56|5a:0>> \x{d7} 2092 bits, which number is known as Bremermann\x{2019}s Limit. Calculations involving numbers larger than <<2.56|5a:0>> \x{d7} 2092 are called transcomputational problems, meaning they\x{2019}re not even theoretically doable; and there are plenty of such problems in statistical physics, complexity theory, fractals, etc. All this is sexy but not quite germane. What\x{2019}s germane is: Take some such transcomputational number, imagine it\x{2019}s a grain of sand, conceive of a whole beach, or desert, or planet, or even galaxy filled with such sand, and not only will the corresponding 10 number be <\x{221e}, but its square will be <\x{221e}, and 10(x(10)) will be <\x{221e}, and so on; and actually it\x{2019}s not even right to compare 10 and \x{221e} arithmetically this way because they\x{2019}re not even in the same mathematical area code\x{2014}even, as it were, the same dimension. And yet it\x{2019}s also true that some \x{221e}s are bigger than others, as in arithmetically bigger. All this will get discussed; the thing for now is that only after R. Dedekind and G. Cantor is it even possible to talk about infinite quantities and their arithmetic coherently, meaningfully. Hence the point of using \x{2018}\x{221e}\x{2019}.",

Take the single most ubiquitous and oppressive feature of the concrete world\x{2014}namely that everything ends, is limited, passes away\x{2014}and then conceive, abstractly, of something without this feature. Analogies to certain ideas of God are obvious; abstraction from all limitation is one way to account for the religious impulse in secular terms. This is a.k.a. the anthropology of religion: a perfect being can be understood as one devoid of all the imperfections we perceive in ourselves and the world, an omnipotent one as without limitations on his will, etc. The fact that it\x{2019}s a pretty dry and doleful way to talk about religion is neither here nor there; the point is that the exact same sort of explanation can be given for where we got the concept of \x{221e} and what we ultimately mean by all the forms of the word \x{2018}infinite\x{2019} we toss around. Whether it\x{2019}s actually the right explanation, though, involves what it commits us to. Meaning metaphysically.

It should be unsurprising, since \x{221e} is both the ultimate abstraction and inveterately fuzzy, that it figures in many such paradoxes. Like take the ideas that there is no last or largest integer and that time extends infinitely forward. Then imagine a perfectly constructed and durable desk lamp with a big red On/Off button, and imagine that this morning the lamp is off but at <<4:30 P.M.|2a>> CST it will be turned on, then at <<4:30 P.M.|2a>> tomorrow it will be turned back off, but then back on again at <<4:30|2>> the following day, and so on, every day, for the rest of time; and now contemplate whether, after an infinite number of days, the lamp will be on or off. You might recall from college math21 that this is actually a Word Problem involving something called a divergent infinite series, more specifically the Grandi Series, 1 \x{2212} 1 + 1 \x{2212} 1 + 1 \x{2212} 1 + 1 \x{2026}, which series sums to 0 if we compute it as (1 \x{2212} 1) + (1 \x{2212} 1) + (1 \x{2212} 1) + \x{2026} but sums to 1 if we compute it as 1 + (\x{2212}1 + 1) + (\x{2212}1 + 1) + (\x{2212}1 + 1) \x{2026}, with the kicker being that, since both computations are mathematically licit, the series\x{2019} \x{2018}real\x{2019} sum appears to be both 1 and not-1, which by LEM is impossible. You may or may not further recall, however,22 that the Grandi Series happens to be a particular subtype of divergent infinite series known as an oscillating series, and that as such it\x{2019}s an object lesson in stipulation for partial sums (symbolized sn), with the relevant symbolism being \x{2018}1 +\x{3a3}(\x{2212}1) where sn = 0 for even n and sn = \x{2212}1 for odd n\x{2019}\x{2014}which symbolism appears so legalistically arcane and clunky precisely because it has to be designed to avoid crevasses like the Lamp Paradox.",

But of course the natural-language \x{2018}solve\x{2019} can mean different things. As mentioned, one way in math to take care of destabilizing problems is to legislate them out of existence\x{2014}by banishing certain kinds of math entities and/or by loading theorems with stipulations and exclusions designed to head off crazy results. Prior to the invention of transfinite math, this was the way most paradoxes of \x{221e} were handled. You \x{2018}solved\x{2019} them by first fudging the distinction between a paradox and a contradiction, and then by applying a kind of metaphysical reductio: if allowing infinite quantities like the number of points on a line or the set of all integers led to paradoxical conclusions, there must be something inherently wrong or nonsensical about infinite quantities, and thus \x{221e}-related entities couldn\x{2019}t really \x{2018}exist\x{2019} in a mathematical sense.

The Reich was apparently worried that Cantor might have been Jewish; by then he was regarded as one of Germany\x{2019}s greatest intellectuals ever. The foundling story still circulates sometimes\x{2014}it fits some of our own templates as well as the Nazis\x{2019}. Another big one is that Cantor derived many of his most famous proofs about \x{221e} while in an asylum, which is also hooey. Cantor\x{2019}s first hospitalization was in 1884, when he was 39; most of his important work had already been done by then. He wasn\x{2019}t hospitalized again until 1899. It was in the last 20 years of his life that he was in and out of places all the time. He died in the Halle Nervenklinic 6 January 1918.",

            "The reason Russell <<lauds|13>> him w/r/t the problem of infinitesimals is the same reason Weierstrass gets top billing in the Arithmetization of Analysis. He is the first to give a wholly rigorous and metaphysically untainted theory of limits. Because it\x{2019}s important, and underlies the way most of us are now taught calc in school, let\x{2019}s at least quickly observe that Weierstrass\x{2019}s definition of limits replaces Abel/Bolzano/Cauchy\x{2019}s natural-language terms like \x{2018}approaches a limit\x{2019} and \x{2018}becomes less than any given quantity\x{2019} with the little epsilon and delta and the \x{2018}| |\x{2019} brackets of absolute value. A great fringe benefit of Weierstrass\x{2019}s theory is that it characterizes limits and continuity in such a way that either can be defined in terms of the other. See for example his definition of continuous function, which is still the industry standard 150 years later65: f(x) is continuous at some point xn if and only if, for any positive number \x{3b5}, there exists a positive \x{3b4} such that for any x in the interval |x \x{2212} xn| < \x{3b4}, |f(x) \x{2212} f(xn)| < \x{3b5}.*",

If the abstract is-a-a-member-of-s-or-not thing is clear enough so that you understand why it alone explains why a set A with three members will have 23 subsets, feel free to skip the rest of this \x{b6}. If it isn\x{2019}t, we\x{2019}ll do a concrete example. Let\x{2019}s say A is the same set {1, 2, 3} unpacked on p. 267, where we listed A\x{2019}s subsets: { }, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}. Take a look at those subsets and see how many times any particular member of A\x{2014}let\x{2019}s say the member 1\x{2014}is included in the eight total subsets. You\x{2019}ll notice it\x{2019}s included in four of the subsets and excluded from <<four|9c:0>>. If you look at A\x{2019}s member 2, you\x{2019}ll see it\x{2019}s the same thing: 2 is present in four and absent from <<four|9c:0>>. Same with 3. Can you see why? There are eight total subsets; half of them contain any particular member of A, and half of them don\x{2019}t. You can actually construct the set of all A\x{2019}s subsets this way. Take any member of A. If your first subset s doesn\x{2019}t contain the member, your next one s\x{2032} will. Or obversely. That is, for any particular member and subset, there are two choices, and the set of all subsets will comprise them both. Two choices for each member. Hence the number of subsets of {1, 2, 3} will be 2 \x{d7} 2 \x{d7} 2, or 23. If this still fails to make the basic idea clear, you\x{2019}re asked to please just eat it (the idea) because this is the best we can do.)",
