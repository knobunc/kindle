            "The tactical reason for sometimes using \x{2018}\x{221e}\x{2019} instead of \x{2018}infinity\x{2019} in the natural-language text here is that the double-blink strangeness of \x{2018}\x{221e}\x{2019} serves as a reminder that it\x{2019}s not clear what we\x{2019}re even talking about. Not yet. For instance, beware of thinking that \x{221e} is just an incredibly, unbelievably enormous number. There are, of course, many such numbers, especially in physics and astronomy\x{2014}like, if in physics an ultranano-instant of 5 \x{d7} 10\x{2212}44 seconds is generally acknowledged to be the smallest time-interval in which the normal concept of continuous time applies (which it is), astronomical data indicates that there have been roughly 6 \x{d7} 1060 such ultranano-instants since the Big Bang. That\x{2019}s a 6 followed by 60 zeroes. We\x{2019}ve all heard about numbers like this, which we usually imagine can be conceived and manipulated only with really advanced super-cooled computers or something. Actually, there are plenty of numbers too big for any real or even theoretical computer to process. Bremermann\x{2019}s Limit is the operative term here. Given limits imposed by basic quantum theory, one H. Bremermann proved in 1962 that \x{201c}No data processing system, whether artificial or living, can process more than 2 \x{d7} 1047 bits per second per gram of its mass,\x{201d} which means that a hypothetical supercomputer the size of the earth (= c. 6 \x{d7} 1027 grams) grinding away for as long as the earth has existed (= about 1010 years, with c. <<3.14|5a:0>> \x{d7} 107 seconds/year) can have processed at most <<2.56|5a:0>> \x{d7} 2092 bits, which number is known as Bremermann\x{2019}s Limit. Calculations involving numbers larger than <<2.56|5a:0>> \x{d7} 2092 are called transcomputational problems, meaning they\x{2019}re not even theoretically doable; and there are plenty of such problems in statistical physics, complexity theory, fractals, etc. All this is sexy but not quite germane. What\x{2019}s germane is: Take some such transcomputational number, imagine it\x{2019}s a grain of sand, conceive of a whole beach, or desert, or planet, or even galaxy filled with such sand, and not only will the corresponding 10 number be <\x{221e}, but its square will be <\x{221e}, and 10(x(10)) will be <\x{221e}, and so on; and actually it\x{2019}s not even right to compare 10 and \x{221e} arithmetically this way because they\x{2019}re not even in the same mathematical area code\x{2014}even, as it were, the same dimension. And yet it\x{2019}s also true that some \x{221e}s are bigger than others, as in arithmetically bigger. All this will get discussed; the thing for now is that only after R. Dedekind and G. Cantor is it even possible to talk about infinite quantities and their arithmetic coherently, meaningfully. Hence the point of using \x{2018}\x{221e}\x{2019}.",

It\x{2019}s sort of the ultimate in drawing away from actual experience. Take the single most ubiquitous and oppressive feature of the concrete world\x{2014}namely that everything ends, is limited, passes away\x{2014}and then conceive, abstractly, of something without this feature. Analogies to certain ideas of God are obvious; abstraction from all limitation is one way to account for the religious impulse in secular terms. This is a.k.a. the anthropology of religion: a perfect being can be understood as one devoid of all the imperfections we perceive in ourselves and the world, an omnipotent one as without limitations on his will, etc. The fact that it\x{2019}s a pretty dry and doleful way to talk about religion is neither here nor there; the point is that the exact same sort of explanation can be given for where we got the concept of \x{221e} and what we ultimately mean by all the forms of the word \x{2018}infinite\x{2019} we toss around. Whether it\x{2019}s actually the right explanation, though, involves what it commits us to. Meaning metaphysically.

The integers never stop; there is no end. Does the set of all integers compose a real \x{221e}?

Or are maybe integers and/or sets only \x{2018}mathematically real\x{2019} as opposed to really real, and what exactly is the difference, and might we want to grant \x{221e} a certain mathematical reality but not the other kind (assuming there\x{2019}s only one other kind)?

It should be unsurprising, since \x{221e} is both the ultimate abstraction and inveterately fuzzy, that it figures in many such paradoxes. Like take the ideas that there is no last or largest integer and that time extends infinitely forward. Then imagine a perfectly constructed and durable desk lamp with a big red On/Off button, and imagine that this morning the lamp is off but at <<4:30 P.M.|2a>> CST it will be turned on, then at <<4:30 P.M.|2a>> tomorrow it will be turned back off, but then back on again at <<4:30|2>> the following day, and so on, every day, for the rest of time; and now contemplate whether, after an infinite number of days, the lamp will be on or off. You might recall from college math21 that this is actually a Word Problem involving something called a divergent infinite series, more specifically the Grandi Series, 1 \x{2212} 1 + 1 \x{2212} 1 + 1 \x{2212} 1 + 1 \x{2026}, which series sums to 0 if we compute it as (1 \x{2212} 1) + (1 \x{2212} 1) + (1 \x{2212} 1) + \x{2026} but sums to 1 if we compute it as 1 + (\x{2212}1 + 1) + (\x{2212}1 + 1) + (\x{2212}1 + 1) \x{2026}, with the kicker being that, since both computations are mathematically licit, the series\x{2019} \x{2018}real\x{2019} sum appears to be both 1 and not-1, which by LEM is impossible.

But of course the natural-language \x{2018}solve\x{2019} can mean different things. As mentioned, one way in math to take care of destabilizing problems is to legislate them out of existence\x{2014}by banishing certain kinds of math entities and/or by loading theorems with stipulations and exclusions designed to head off crazy results. Prior to the invention of transfinite math, this was the way most paradoxes of \x{221e} were handled. You \x{2018}solved\x{2019} them by first fudging the distinction between a paradox and a contradiction, and then by applying a kind of metaphysical reductio: if allowing infinite quantities like the number of points on a line or the set of all integers led to paradoxical conclusions, there must be something inherently wrong or nonsensical about infinite quantities, and thus \x{221e}-related entities couldn\x{2019}t really \x{2018}exist\x{2019} in a mathematical sense.

Put a little more sexily, the limit L of the infinite sequence p1, p2, p3, \x{2026} , pn, \x{2026} is the number that the sequence approaches (or \x{2018}tends to\x{2019}) as n approaches \x{221e}, with this latter approach symbolized by a little sublinear \x{2018}\x{2192}\x{2019} and the whole thing by  The limit of a function is basically the value that the dependent variable approaches as the independent variable approaches some other value.

It\x{2019}s a restriction of some kind(s) on the function\x{2019}s range. A classic example from trig is f(x) = sin x, where all the values of f(x) are going to be between\x{a0}\x{2212}1 and 1. More important for our purposes is that functions can have upper bounds (U) and/or lower bounds (L) such that f(x) \x{2264} U and/or f(x) \x{2265} L for all x in the function\x{2019}s domain. Even more important are the further-specified least upper bound and greatest lower bound of a function, where U1 is the least upper bound of f(x) if any other upper bound Un is \x{2265} U1, and L1 is f(x)\x{2019}s greatest lower bound if it\x{2019}s \x{2265} any other lower bound Ln.

In other words, a perfect one-to-one correspondence: There are exactly as many R.L.-points in [0, 1] as there are in [0, 2]. And (as now appears obvious, but Bolzano was the first to point it out) simply by changing the function\x{2019}s x-coefficient to any other integer\x{2014}y = 5x, y = 6,517x\x{2014}you can prove that there are exactly as many real numbers between 0 and 1 as between 0 and any other finite number you can think of.*",

This is mainly because of analysis\x{2019}s ability to quantify motion and process and change, and because of the greatly increased generality of physical laws expressed as differential equations and/or trigonometric series. At the same same time, and just as with the development of classical calc, much of the mathematical progress from 1700 to at least 1830 is in response to scientific problems\x{2014}again, some of these have already been mentioned. The point is even more emphatic here than it was in \x{a7}3b: in everything from astronomy to engineering, to navigation, to warfare, etc., the tools of analysis really worked.

It involves defining the decimal representation of point (x, y) as the convergent series  and then \x{201c}pulling the terms of [this series] apart\x{201d} in such a way as to form for each member a sequence of \x{201c}\x{3c1} independent variables\x{201d} in [0,1], these latter designated \x{3b1}1, \x{3b1}2, \x{3b1}3, \x{3b1}4, \x{2026}, \x{3b1}\x{3c1}. The \x{201c}pulling apart\x{201d} and subsequent mapping (as well as the reverse, so that the \x{3b1}\x{2194}\x{3b2} correspondence works both ways) is accomplished via four equations, of which the first looks like: \x{2018}\x{3b1}1,n = \x{3b2}(n\x{2212}1)\x{3c1}+1\x{2019}.
