The I\x{fa}monna Gold Galdre Bewunden of 1923, though with no reference to \x{2018}gods\x{2019}, also includes \x{2018}Silmarillion\x{2019} echoes, for instance that the Elves sang under green hills (in Elfinesse, an earlier equivalent of Elvenhome) before \x{2018}dwarves were spawned in dungeons rude\x{2019} (primitive). It is conceivable that the mythology \x{2013} always a \x{2018}dominant construction\x{2019} in Tolkien\x{2019}s thoughts (Letters, p. 346) \x{2013} had an influence on the earlier poem\x{2019}s composition; but it need not have done. Literary treatments of hoards were abundant before <<1923|9c:0>>, if any were needed for inspiration, and the subjects of greed and power run like a thread through Tolkien\x{2019}s fiction, most significantly in The Hobbit with its \x{2018}dragon-sickness\x{2019}, The Lord of the Rings with its overmastering Ring, and the story of F\x{eb}anor and the Silmarils in \x{2018}The Silmarillion\x{2019}.",
