            "\x{2018}The germ of Tom Bombadil\x{2019} evolved at length into Bombadil Goes Boating, which had no published form before it appeared in the Bombadil collection in 1962. Tolkien developed the poem through at least ten versions as well as fragmentary workings (Bodleian Library, MS Tolkien 19, ff. <<10\x{2013}28|5a:0>>, 37\x{2013}40), calling it variously The Fliting of Tom Bombadil, The Merry Fliting of Tom Bombadil, and The Adventures of Tom Bombadil II: The Merry Fliting before settling on its less recondite final title. Fliting, from the Old English for \x{2018}strive\x{2019} or \x{2018}quarrel\x{2019}, refers to a contest of insults, often in verse. Examples are found in Northern and medieval literature, for instance in the exchange in Beowulf between Beowulf and Unferth before the former faces Grendel. This indeed is the thread which runs through Bombadil Goes Boating, in which Tom is scolded by the willow-wren, the kingfisher, the otter, the swan, the \x{2018}little folk of Hays-end and Breredon\x{2019}, and Farmer Maggot, and gives back as good as he gets. Violent though the encounters may seem, in truth \x{2013} and arrows in his hat notwithstanding \x{2013} the many threats given or received by Tom are made in good humour. Tolkien says in the preface to the collection: \x{2018}Tom\x{2019}s raillery is here turned in jest upon his friends, who treat it with amusement (tinged with fear)\x{2019}.",

            "And yet, in \x{2018}The Silmarillion\x{2019} as it stood in 1937 but not in the Oxford Magazine poem of that year (carried forward in 1962), the main labours of the Ainur took place long before the creation of the moon and sun; and it also must be said that \x{2018}When the moon was new and the sun young\x{2019} is very much of a kind with \x{2018}once upon a time, long ago\x{2019} as a traditional way to begin a story, whether or not it refers to an earlier conception. The I\x{fa}monna Gold Galdre Bewunden of 1923, though with no reference to \x{2018}gods\x{2019}, also includes \x{2018}Silmarillion\x{2019} echoes, for instance that the Elves sang under green hills (in Elfinesse, an earlier equivalent of Elvenhome) before \x{2018}dwarves were spawned in dungeons rude\x{2019} (primitive). It is conceivable that the mythology \x{2013} always a \x{2018}dominant construction\x{2019} in Tolkien\x{2019}s thoughts (Letters, p. 346) \x{2013} had an influence on the earlier poem\x{2019}s composition; but it need not have done. Literary treatments of hoards were abundant before <<1923|9c:0>>, if any were needed for inspiration, and the subjects of greed and power run like a thread through Tolkien\x{2019}s fiction, most significantly in The Hobbit with its \x{2018}dragon-sickness\x{2019}, The Lord of the Rings with its overmastering Ring, and the story of F\x{eb}anor and the Silmarils in \x{2018}The Silmarillion\x{2019}.",
