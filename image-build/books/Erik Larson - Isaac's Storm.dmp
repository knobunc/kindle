He had stayed up until <<midnight|13>> recording weather observations from a bank of instruments mounted on the roof of the Levy Building, a four-story brick building in the heart of Galveston\'s commercial district. The barometers had captured only a slight decrease in pressure. The anemometer, which caught the wind in cups mounted at opposite ends of crossed metal bars, recorded wind speeds of eleven to nineteen miles an hour. It was capable of measuring velocities as high as one hundred miles an hour, but conditions had never come close to testing this capacity, nor did any rational soul believe they ever would. Throughout Friday afternoon and evening, a peculiar oppressiveness had settled over the city. Temperatures remained high well into the night.',

He needed to find a permanent home for his children and a woman to care for them. He put Joseph in charge of the office, although it must have pained him to do so.

They computed an average speed of five hundred miles per hour. Rear Admiral L. G. Billings wrote, "Looking seaward, we saw, first, a thin line of phosphorescent light, which loomed higher and higher until it seemed to touch the sky; its crest, crowned with the death light of phosphorescent glow, showing the sullen masses of water below." The Wateree landed upright and intact three kilometers inland. The U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey later estimated the tsunami had risen to seventy feet in height. See Zebrowski, 131-35.',
