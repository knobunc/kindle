Payne produced a glowing orange whip from within his voluminous coat and whirled it about his head before lashing out. <<After three|9:0>> explosive cracks, the poles flinched, then hastily straightened back up. Payne tossed the whip into the air\x{2014}where it vanished with a bang.",

            "17 Lilith, Agatha\x{2019}s foster mother, had been an exuberant proponent of the preserving, canning, drying and pickling of various fruits and vegetables. Agatha had once complained that this might make sense if the Clays managed a farm, but in fact, they lived in town, and all of the produce they processed was purchased from local green-grocers. Lilith had said nothing at the time, but that night, Agatha awakened and discovered that, <<after midnight|13>>, her parents\x{2019} forge served as a gathering place for constructs she had never seen before. These were twisted, bizarre creations. Things that could never feel comfortable out in public, despite the Baron\x{2019}s laws enforcing tolerance. They labored in the many unseen jobs offered by the University. Despite their often horrific appearance, Agatha found them to be intelligent, well-read, and urbane, in their own strange way. It was these creatures who received the bulk of the preserved food. The Clays always refused direct payment, but Agatha now understood the source of the many odd and useful things that appeared overnight upon the Clay\x{2019}s doorstep.",
