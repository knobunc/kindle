The direct result of the 701/704 was the beginning of work on Fortran (which stands for formula translator) by John Backus at IBM in 1953. Work on the Fortran translator (we would call it a compiler) began in 1955 and was completed in 1957. Fortran was, without a doubt, the first programming language.',

Only a tithe of these are in use today, but the growth and development of them has been progressive and organic.',
