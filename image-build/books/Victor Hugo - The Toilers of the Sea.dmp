            "After opposing the coup d\x{2019}\x{e9}tat of 1851, Hugo went into exile in Brussels and Jersey, launching fierce literary attacks on the Second Empire in Napoleon the Little, Chastisements, and The Story of a Crime. Between 1855 and 1870 he lived in Guernsey in the Channel Islands. There he was joined by his family, some friends, and his mistress, Juliette Drouet, whom he had known since 1833, when as a young actress she had starred in his Lucrezia Borgia. His political interests were supplemented by other concerns. From <<around 1853|18:0>> he became absorbed in experiments with spiritualism and table tapping. In his later years he wrote the Contemplations (1856), considered the peak of his lyric accomplishment, and a number of more elaborate poetic cycles derived from his theories about spirituality and history: the immense The Legend of the Centuries (1859\x{2013}83) and its posthumously published successors The End of Satan (1886) and God (1891). In these same years he produced the novels Les Mis\x{e9}rables (1862),  The Toilers of the Sea (1866), The Laughing Man (1869), and  Ninety-Three (1873).",

            "On that Christmas morning the road that skirts the sea between St. Peter Port and the Vale was covered in white. It had been snowing from <<midnight|13>> until dawn. <<About nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>, just after sunrise, since it was not yet time for the Anglicans to go to St. Sampson\x{2019}s Church and the Wesleyans to the Eldad Chapel, the road was practically deserted. In the whole stretch between the first and second Martello towers there were only three people\x{2014}a child, a man, and a woman. These three, walking at some distance from one another, had apparently no connection with one another. The child, whose age might be about eight, had stopped and was looking curiously at the snow. The man was perhaps a hundred paces behind the woman. Like her, he was making for St. Sampson. Youngish, he looked like a workman or seaman or something of that kind. He was dressed in his workaday clothes, a jacket of coarse brown cloth and trousers with tarpaulin leggings\x{2014}suggesting that, notwithstanding the holy day, he was not on his way to church or chapel. His thick shoes of rough leather, the soles studded with large nails, left prints on the snow more like the lock of a prison gate than a man\x{2019}s footprint. The woman for her part was evidently dressed for church: she wore a wide padded cloak of black ribbed silk, under which was a smart dress of Irish poplin striped white and pink, and but for her red stockings could have been taken for a Parisienne. She walked with a light and lively step, a gait that had not yet borne the weight of life and that revealed her to be a young girl. She had the fugitive grace of bearing that marks the most delicate of transitions\x{2014} adolescence, the mingling of two twilight periods, the first emergence of a woman in the final stage of childhood.

            'The Norman fishermen of the Channel need to take a great many precautions when they are at sea because of the illusions created by the Devil. It was long believed that Saint Maclou lived on the great square stack of Ortach, in the open sea between Alderney and the Casquets, and in the past many old seamen declared that they had frequently seen him in the distance, sitting on the rock and reading a book. And so seamen sailing past the rock made many genuflections as they passed until the fable was dissipated and gave place to the truth. It was discovered, and is now generally known, that the rock was inhabited not by a saint but by a devil. This devil, one Jochmus, had been clever enough to be accepted for several centuries as Saint Maclou. The Church itself, of course, sometimes falls into errors of this kind. The devils Raguhel, Oribel, and Tobiel were saints until <<745|9c:0>>, when Pope Zacharias, having found them out, ejected them. In order to carry out such expulsions, which are undoubtedly beneficial, it is necessary to know your way about with devils.',

These monstrous facts are well authenticated. Some witches and warlocks are obliging and, for two or three guineas, will take over your illnesses. Then they writhe about on their bed, groaning. While they are writhing you say: \x{201c}There! I\x{2019}m all right again.\x{201d} Others will cure you of all ills by tying a handkerchief around your body: a remedy so simple that it is surprising no one has thought of it before. Last century the Royal Court of Guernsey put them on a pile of faggots and burned them alive.

A visitor would have found himself carried back to the seafaring world of the seventeenth century. A specialist archaeologist could have gone there to study the ancient language, used in working ships and in battle, roared out by Jean Bart88 through the loud-hailer that terrified Admiral Hyde. The seafaring vocabulary of our fathers, almost completely changed in our day, was still in use on Guernsey <<around 1820|18:1>>. A ship that was a good plyer was a bon boulinier, one that carried a weather helm, in spite of her foresails and rudder, was a vaisseau ardent. To get under way was prendre l\x{2019}aire; to lie to in a storm was capeyer; to make fast running rigging was faire dormant; to get to windward was  faire chapelle; to keep the cable tight was faire teste; to be out of trim was \x{ea}tre en pantenne; to keep the sails full was  porter plain. All these terms have fallen out of use. Today we say  louvoyer (to beat to windward), they said leauvoyer; for naviguer (to sail) they said naviger; for virer (to tack) they said  donner vent devant; for aller de l\x{2019}avant (to make headway) they said tailler de l\x{2019}avant; for tirez d\x{2019}accord (haul together) they said halez d\x{2019}accord; for d\x{e9}rapez (weigh anchor), d\x{e9}plantez; for embraquez (haul tight), abraquez; for taquets (cleats), bittons; for burins (toggles),  tappes; for balancines (lifts), valancines; for tribord  (starboard), stribord; for les hommes de quart \x{e0} b\x{e2}bord (men of the port watch), les basbourdis. Admiral Tourville89 wrote to Hocquincourt, Nous avons singl\x{e9} (sailed) instead of  cingl\x{e9}.

Its rectilinear radiance, broken up into long straight shafts of light over the opacity of the depths, growing lighter or darker from one crevice in the rock to another, looked as if it were divided by sheets of glass. There was light in this cavern, but light of an unknown kind. It had nothing of the quality of our everyday light. It was as if one had found one\x{2019}s way onto another planet. This light was an enigma; it was like the glaucous gleam in the eye of a sphinx. The cavern resembled the interior of an enormous and magnificent skull; the vault was the cranium, the arch was the mouth; the sockets for the eyes were missing. The mouth, swallowing and disgorging the inflow and outflow of the sea, wide open to catch the full light of <<midday|13>>, drank in light and vomited forth bitterness. There are some beings, intelligent and evil, like that. The rays of the sun, passing through this porch obstructed by a vitreous mass of seawater, became green, like the glimmering light from Aldebaran. The water, filled with this moist light, appeared like molten emerald. The whole cavern had a soft aquamarine tinge of extraordinary delicacy. The vault of the cavern, with its lobes resembling those of a brain and its intricate ramifications like a network of nerves, was bathed in a tender shade of chrysoprase. The shimmering ripples on the water were reflected on the roof of the cavern, where they dissolved and re-formed endlessly, forming a golden mesh that was now wider and now narrower, in a mysterious dance movement. It had a spectral aspect; observing it, one might well wonder what prey secured or expectation to be realized gave rise to this joyously magnificent network of living fire. From the projections in the vault and the irregularities in the rock there hung long thin trails of vegetation, their roots probably bathed in some deposit of water higher up in the granite, with drops of water trickling like pearls, one after the other, from their tips. These pearls dropped into the gulf below with a gentle splash. The effect of the scene was indescribable.

            "There was one spot on the deck that was bathed in sunshine, and it was this he was looking at. In this patch of sunlight were Ebenezer and D\x{e9}ruchette. They were sitting side by side, nestling close together, like two birds warming themselves in the <<noonday|13>> sun, on one of those benches sheltered under a tarpaulin awning that well-equipped vessels provide for their passengers, labeled, in the case of an English vessel, FOR LADIES ONLY. D\x{e9}ruchette\x{2019}s head was on Ebenezer\x{2019}s shoulder and his arm was around her waist; they held each other\x{2019}s hands, the fingers intertwined. The difference between one angel and the other was reflected in these two exquisite faces informed by innocence. One was more virginal, the other more astral. Their chaste embrace was expressive: it held all the closeness of marriage, and all its modesty. The bench they were sitting on was a private nook, almost a nest. It was, too, a glory: the gentle glory of love fleeing in a cloud.",

            "Hugo politely offered a piano. But, as the Ocean pointed out, a piano could never express the synaesthetic dialogue of sounds, sights, and scents. \x{201c}The piano I need would not fit into your house. It has only two keys, one white and one black, day and night; the day full of birds, the night full of souls.\x{201d} Hugo then suggested using Mozart as a go-between: \x{201c}Mozart would be better,\x{201d} agreed the Ocean. \x{201c}I myself am unintelligible.\x{201d}
HUGO: \x{201c}Could you ask Mozart to come this evening at <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>?\x{201d}
THE OCEAN: \x{201c}I shall have the message conveyed to him by the Twilight.\x{201d}",
