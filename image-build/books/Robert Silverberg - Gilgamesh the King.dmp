I pointed into the classroom, where Bir-hurturre and Zabardi-bunugga were staring at me and making faces with their tongues, and demanded that they be put to death at once. But the school-father replied only that I had risen from my place without permission, I had spoken to him without permission; and he gave me over to the whipping-slave to cane me for my unruliness. It was not the last time those two tormented me, and occasionally some of the others joined in, the bigger ones, at least. I found I could do nothing against any of this persecution. School-father and his assistant always took their side, and told me I must hold my tongue, I must master my temper. I wrote down the names of my enemies, both my schoolfellows and my tutors, so that I could have them all flayed alive when I was king.

I have loved her and I have loathed her, often at <<one|9c:1>> and the same time; and I have been locked in such struggle of the soul with that woman that I have not tasted the common sort of domestic love with any other.

A message that comes from <<one|9c:0>>, under the auspices of the other, might well be an invitation to doom. I must move carefully.
