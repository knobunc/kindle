            "Loudly they murmured, and some cried: \x{201c}Woe to him that ravishes anew our Tree,\x{201d} and V\x{e1}na was in great ire. Yet did none dare to draw nigh, for those twain Aul\x{eb} and Tulkas might scarcely bear up even upon their godlike shoulders that great globe of flame and were tottering beneath it. Hearing their anger indeed Aul\x{eb} stayed, saying: \x{201c}Cease ye of little wisdom and have a patience,\x{201d} but even with those words his foot went astray and he stumbled, and even Tulkas might not bear that fruit alone, so that it fell, and striking stony ground burst asunder. Straightway such a blinding radiance leapt forth as even the full bloom of Laurelin had not yielded of old, and the darkened eyes of the Vali were dazzled so that they fell back stunned; but a pillar of light rose from that place smiting the heavens that the stars paled above it and the face of Taniquetil went red afar off, and Aul\x{eb} alone of all those there was unmoved by sorrow. Then said Aul\x{eb}: \x{201c}Of this can I make a ship of light\x{2014}surpassing even the desire of Manw\x{eb},\x{201d} and now Varda and many others, even V\x{e1}na, understood his purpose and were glad. But they made a mighty corbel of twisted gold, and strewing it with ardent petals of its own bloom they laid therein the halves of the fruit of <<noon|13>> and uplifting it with many hands bore it away with much singing and great hope. Then coming to the courts of Aul\x{eb} they set it down, and thereupon began the great smithying of the Sun; and this was the most cunning-marvellous of all the works of Aul\x{eb} Talkamarda, whose works are legion. Of that perfect rind a vessel did he make, diaphanous and shining, yet of a tempered strength, for with spells of his own he overcame its brittleness, nor in any way was its subtle delicacy thereby diminished.",

Its floor they made of gold and its walls of polished bronze, and an arcade of golden pillars topped with fires engirdled it, save only on the East; but Yavanna set a great and nameless spell around it, so that therein was poured the most of the waters of the fruit of <<noon|13>> and it became a bath of fire. Indeed is it not called Tanyasalp\x{eb}, the bowl of fire, even Faskalan\x{fa}men, the Bath of the Setting Sun, for here when Urwendi after returned from the East and the first sunset came on Valinor the ship was drawn down and its radiance refreshed against new voyagings on the morrow while the Moon held High Heaven.",

Now it was at that time seven times seven days since the fruit of <<noon|13>> was born upon Laurelin, and many of the Eldar and of the sprites and of the Gods were drawn nigh, listening to L\x{f3}rien\x{2019}s song; but he heeded them not, gazing upon the Tree.",

            "Lo, its new leaves were crusted with a silver moisture, and their undersides were white and set with pale gleaming filaments. Buds there were of flowers also upon the bough, and they opened, but a dark mist of the sea gathered about the tree, and the air grew bitterly cold as it never before had been in Valinor, and those blossoms faded and fell and none heeded them. One only was there at the branch\x{2019}s end that opening shone of its own light and no mist or cold harmed it, but indeed waxing it seemed to suck the very vapours and transform them subtly to the silver substance of its body; and it grew to be a very pale and wondrous glistering flower, nor did even the purest snow upon Taniquetil gleaming in the light of Silpion out-rival it, and its heart was of white flame and it throbbed, waxing and waning marvellously. Then said L\x{f3}rien for the joy of his heart: \x{201c}Behold the Rose of Silpion\x{201d}, and that rose grew till the fruit of Laurelin had been but little greater, and ten thousand crystal petals were in that flower, and it was drenched in a fragrant dew like honey and this dew was light. Now L\x{f3}rien would suffer none to draw near, and this will he rue for ever: for the branch upon which the Rose hung yielded all its sap and withered, nor even yet would he suffer that blossom to be plucked gently down, being enamoured of its loveliness and lusting to see it grow mightier than the fruit of <<noon|13>>, more glorious than the Sun.",

Moreover, behold, that living Rose continued to give forth a honey as of light that distills upon the isle of glass, and a dew of moonbeams glistens there, yet rather does this weigh the vessel than buoy it as did the increase of the Sunship\x{2019}s flames. So is it that Ilinsor must return at times, and that overflowing radiance of the Rose is stored in Valinor against dark days\x{2014}and it is to tell that such days come ever and anon, for then the white flower of the isle wanes and scarcely shines, and then must it be refreshed and watered with its silver dew, much as Silpion was wont of old to be.",

            "As a result of this fullness and intensity of description, the origin of the Sun and Moon in the last fruit and last flower of the Trees has less of mystery than in the succinct and beautiful language of The Silmarillion; but also much is said here to emphasize the great size of the \x{2018}Fruit of <<Noon|13>>\x{2019}, and the increase in the heat and brilliance of the Sunship after its launching, so that the reflection rises less readily that if the Sun that brilliantly illumines the whole Earth was but one fruit of Laurelin then Valinor must have been painfully bright and hot in the days of the Trees. In the early story the last outpourings of life from the dying Trees are utterly strange and \x{2018}enormous\x{2019}, those of Laurelin portentous, even ominous; the Sun is astoundingly bright and hot even to the Valar, who are awestruck and disquieted by what has been done (the Gods knew \x{2018}that they had done a greater thing than they at first knew\x{2019}, p. 190); and the anger and distress of certain of the Valar at the burning light of the Sun enforces the feeling that in the last fruit of Laurelin a terrible and unforeseen power has been released. This distress does indeed survive in The Silmarillion (p. 100), in the reference to \x{2018}the prayers of L\x{f3}rien and Est\x{eb}, who said that sleep and rest had been banished from the Earth, and the stars were hidden\x{2019} but in the tale the blasting power of the new Sun is intensely conveyed in the images of \x{2018}the heat dancing above the trees\x{2019} in the gardens of L\x{f3}rien, the silent nightingales, the withered poppies and the drooping evening flowers.",

In the tale the fruit of Laurelin also fell to the ground, when Aul\x{eb} stumbled and its weight was too great for Tulkas to bear alone: the significance of this event is not made perfectly clear, but it seems that, had the Fruit of <<Noon|13>> not burst asunder, Aul\x{eb} would not have understood its structure and conceived that of the Sunship.",
