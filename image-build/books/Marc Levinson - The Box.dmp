Terry Malloy, the muscular hero played by Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront, would not be at home. Almost every one of the intricate movements required to service a vessel is choreographed by a computer long before the ship arrives. Computers, and the vessel planners who use them, determine the order in which the containers are to be discharged, to speed the process without destabilizing the ship. The actions of the container cranes and the equipment in the yard all are programmed in advance. The longshoreman who drives each machine faces a screen telling him which container is to be handled next and where it is to be moved\x{2014}unless the terminal dispenses with longshoremen by using driverless transporters to pick up the containers at shipside and centrally controlled stacker cranes to handle container storage. The computers have determined that the truck picking up incoming container ABLQ 998435 should be summoned to the terminal at <<10:45 a.m.|2a>>, and that outgoing container JKFC 119395, a 40-foot box bound for Newark, carrying 56,800 pounds of machinery and currently stacked at yard location A-52- G-6, will be loaded third from the bottom in the fourth slot in the second row of the forward hold. They have ensured that the refrigerated containers are placed in bays with electrical hookups, and that containers with hazardous contents are apart from containers that could increase the risk of explosion. The entire operation runs like clockwork, with no tolerance for error or human foibles. Within twenty-four hours, the ship discharges its thousands of containers, takes on thousands more, and steams on its way.",

The Australian Stevedoring Board took over longshore work assignments after World War II, and the creation of Britain\x{2019}s National Dock Labour Board in 1947 did away with the scramble.

The Pennsy signed up 150 motor carriers to pick up and deliver the trailers, and soon had a \$100-million-a-year business. It created a research-and-development department\x{2014}a highly unusual step for a railroad\x{2014}and charged it with improving TrucTrain. The biggest hurdle, TrucTrain\x{2019}s managers decided, was that the Pennsy could not transfer loaded cars to many connecting railroads. In November 1955, TrucTrain was incorporated as Trailer Train Company, and other railroads were invited to buy in. The idea was simple: instead of each railroad\x{2019}s operating its own small trailer business, Trailer Train would handle truck trailers nationwide. It would own the flatcars, collect revenue from truck lines, and pay the railroads to haul its cars over their tracks. At the end of the year, any profit would be divided among the railroads that had become shareholders. Trailer Train started small, operating barely 500 flat-cars in 1956. Other railroads quickly joined the enterprise, allowing Trailer Train to gain economies of scale beyond the reach of individual railroads. By <<1957|9n:0>>, the company was buying a fleet of 85-foot flatcars, enabling it to boost efficiency by carrying two of the new 40-foot truck trailers on a single car.",

Since the 1930s, its ships had picked up rolls of newsprint from Crown Zellerbach\x{2019}s mills at Port Angeles and Camas, in Washington State, and hauled them down the coast to California. The business was reliable\x{2014}until the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads went after the traffic. They exempted newsprint from their general rate increases in the 1950s, and then they began to lower their rates in order to capture the cargo. To compete, the ship line had to slash its tariff for news-print from \$32 to \$18 per ton. By <<1958|9n:0>>, Coastwise Steamship Company was near insolvency, and the Pacific coastal trade in newsprint was dead.",

By the late 1950s, only six piers were in parttime use for general cargo, and the port\x{2019}s tax-advantaged foreign trade zone was so quiet that the Seattle Port Commission, a county agency, considered closing it. A local television documentary about the sorry state of the port turned the political situation around in 1959. Business leaders formed a port committee, and in July 1960 the Port Commission unveiled a \$32 million construction plan that included two container terminals. The port was suddenly the center of attention: in November 1960, no fewer than seventeen candidates stood for election to the Port Commission. Voters approved a \$10 million bond issue for the first stage of construction.",

From 1968 through 1975, no fewer than 406 containerships entered service. Most of the new vessels were at least twice as large as any that had been on the scene in 1967. Beyond these fully containerized vessels, ship lines added more than 200 partially containerized ships, with container cells built into some of their holds but not others, and <<almost 300|9n:0>> roll on-roll off ships to serve routes that lacked the volume to justify containerships.

In principle, it should be possible to quantify transport-cost saving over time by comparing a country\x{2019}s imports under two different definitions, free on board (f.o.b.), which represents the value of merchandise at the point of export, and cost of insurance and freight (c.i.f.), which is the value at the point of import, including transport costs. In practice, however, the difference between c.i.f. and f.o.b. imports provides little guidance concerning freight-cost trends. The accuracy of the underlying data is questionable; if IMF figures are to be believed, insurance and freight accounted for a mere 1 percent of Switzerland\x{2019}s imports as long ago as 1960. Data for countries with large-scale trade in bulk products, such as coal and oil, may not reflect changes affecting manufactured goods. More problematic, the use of aggregate c.i.f. and f.o.b. data assumes that the composition and origin of imports have not changed over time. Scott L. Baier and Jeffrey H. Bergstrand, \x{201c}The Growth of World Trade: Tariffs, Transport Costs, and Income Similarity,\x{201d} Journal of International Economics 53, no. 1 (2001): <<1\x{2013}27|5a:0>>, show that for 16 wealthy nations, transport fell from 8.2 percent to 4.3 percent of import value between 1958\x{2013}60 and 1986\x{2013}88, but the various factors cited above make this conclusion unpersuasive.",
