He, Mrs Rattery, Lena Lawson, old Mrs Rattery, his mother, and his son Philip \x{2013} a wee boy \x{2013} had dinner together. They all ate the same food. The deceased and his mother took whisky with their food, the rest water. None of the others suffered any ill effects.

They all repaired to the drawing room with the exception of Master Philip. George Rattery was seized with severe pains between ten and fifteen minutes later. The women folk, poor souls, were helpless. They gave him a mustard emetic, but that only aggravated the seizure; the symptoms, of course, are very horrifying. Their own medical man, whom they rang up first, was out to a road accident, and by the time they had got hold of another, it was too late. Dr Clarkson arrived a little before <<ten|9c:1>> \x{2013} he\x{2019}d been out on a maternity case \x{2013} and applied the usual chloroform treatment, but Rattery was too far gone then.
