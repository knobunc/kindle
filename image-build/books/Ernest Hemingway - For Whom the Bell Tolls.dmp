            "\x{201c}Yes. It is a name I can never dominate. We had two with a machine gun. They were sent also by the army. They could not get the gun away and lost it. Certainly it weighed no more than that girl and if the old woman had been over them they would have gotten it away.\x{201d} He shook his head remembering, then went on. \x{201c}Never in my life have I seen such a thing as when the explosion was produced. The train was coming steadily. We saw it far away. And I had an excitement so great that I cannot tell it. We saw steam from it and then later came the noise of the whistle. Then it came chu-chu-chu-chu-chu-chu steadily larger and larger and then, at the moment of the explosion, the front wheels of the engine rose up and all of the earth seemed to rise in a great cloud of blackness and a roar and the engine rose high in the cloud of dirt and of the wooden ties rising in the air as in a dream and then it fell onto its side like a great wounded animal and there was an explosion of white steam before the clods of the other explosion had ceased to fall on us and the m\x{e1}quina commenced to speak ta-tat-tat-ta!\x{201d} went the gypsy shaking his two clenched fists up and down in front of him, thumbs up, on an imaginary machine gun. \x{201c}Ta! Ta! Tat! Tat! Tat! Ta!\x{201d} he exulted. \x{201c}Never in my life have I seen such a thing, with the troops running from the train and the m\x{e1}quina speaking into them and the men falling. It was then that I put my hand on the m\x{e1}quina in my excitement and discovered that the barrel burned and at that moment the old woman slapped me on the side of the face and said, \x{2018}Shoot, you fool! Shoot or I will kick your brains in!\x{2019} Then I commenced to shoot but it was very hard to hold my gun steady and the troops were running up the far hill. Later, after we had been down at the train to see what there was to take, an officer forced some troops back toward us at the point of a pistol. He kept waving the pistol and shouting at them and we were all shooting at him but no one hit him. Then some troops lay down and commenced firing and the officer walked up and down behind them with his pistol and still we could not hit him and the m\x{e1}quina could not fire on him because of the position of the train. This officer shot two men as they lay and still they would not get up and he was cursing them and finally they got up, <<one two|5l:1>> and <<three|91:1>> at a time and came running toward us and the train. Then they lay flat again and fired. Then we left, with the m\x{e1}quina still speaking over us as we left. It was then I found the girl where she had run from the train to the rocks and she ran with us. It was those troops who hunted us until that night.\x{201d}",
