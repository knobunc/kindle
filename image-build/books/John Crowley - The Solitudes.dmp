Now there are health-food stores and shops with clever names on the ground floors of some houses, galleries in the old warehouses; but still, especially in hard weather, an older, less hopeful place still persists, a black and white photograph: dirty-faced children, a sour church bell, coal smoke, smells of <<five-o\x{2019}clock|6>> supper.

As a child, Rosie hadn\x{2019}t perceived the decline, if it was <<one|9f>>, of the Rasmussens; she had had a Grandfather and a Grandmother Rasmussen in addition to Boney, a father too, and cousins, and her Sunday visits were always to one Rasmussen satrapy or another; but even in those days a kind of abstraction was setting in, was in fact well advanced, her own father\x{2019}s flight first to the West and then increasingly into his own fast-darkening soul (he died of an overdose of morphine when Rosie was fourteen) was only the extremest example of it. When Mike got the job here at The Woods (partly through Boney\x{2019}s influence, the Rasmussen Foundation still contributed to the place\x{2019}s existence) and Rosie returned to the Faraways, she felt a little like a princess who had awakened after being asleep for a hundred years: grandparents were dead, known houses sold to strangers, cousins departed, new blacktop highways and plastic shopping centers laid over Rasmussen pastures and horse barns. Only Boney, her grandfather\x{2019}s older brother, oldest of them all, old even when Rosie was a child, still survived, outliving them all. And Butterman\x{2019}s, her castle, to the best anyway of Boney\x{2019}s remembrance, was still hers or his: her castle, which she had told stories of, to herself and others, during her long life else-where.

Once they were said, running off with her was mere practical necessity; in those days of universities standing in loco parentis (nowadays they didn\x{2019}t even know that lingo) the two of them were barred from cohabiting, from coitus too if they could be caught at it, and she was the first woman he had both loved and lain with, so there was nothing for it but to cash in their just-paid-for class-admittance cards like chips\x{2014}his had been paid for with a scholarship, no matter, by an oversight he was allowed to liquidate them anyway\x{2014}and use the money to flee; and though when he staggered from the bus at a rest stop into the unreal sunshine of Albuquerque he did for an awful moment think What have I done, he didn\x{2019}t ever, then or later, certainly not on the long bus ride back east alone, back into winter and the string of lies he had left behind him, ever really think he had much choice in the matter.",

Jews did business in the shops and chandleries without any yellow badge; at <<noon|13>> from a tiny minaret a man in a turban leaned out and crowed a long unintelligible prayer: for even the Turks were allowed to have a mosque for their people. But in the market the shipmen of many nations gathered to argue over the galley slaves for sale there, for Livorno was also the great slave market of the Christian world, and Moors, Turks, Greeks, a wild confusion of humanity, some sleeping, some weeping in their chains, were being bought and sold as Bruno passed. Following the inward map the blond boy of the Vatican had given him, he found the dock he needed, spoke the right name, and, almost unable not to cry aloud in astonishment, glee, and fear, was handed down into a long and narrow felucca just putting out to sea: Avanti signor.
