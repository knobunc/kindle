            "The geography of the world in which these stories are set is bounded by the mansion flat in Froxbury Court, from which Rumpole leaves each morning on the <<8.45|3c>> tube; his Chambers at Equity Court, where every morning he searches his corner of the mantelpiece for a brief, and steps politely over one of \x{2018}Uncle Tom\x{2019}s\x{2019} putts across the rug; the Old Bailey, where the struggle against the irascible Judge Bullingham continues; and Pommeroy\x{2019}s Wine Bar, where our hero repairs to refuel, reflect and cash cheques. He seldom ventures outside this ambit, though necessity, from time to time, forces him into a branch of the \x{2018}Caring Bank\x{2019} \x{2013} resented custodians of the Rumpole overdraft. Crime, as Rumpole is fond of reminding us, does not pay.",
