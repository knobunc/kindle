            "\x{201c}Oh yes; there\x{2019}s nothing like a fiddle,\x{201d} said the dairyman. \x{201c}Though I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows\x{2014}at least that\x{2019}s my experience. Once there was a old aged man over at Mellstock\x{2014}William Dewy by name\x{2014}one of the family that used to do a good deal of business as trantersbm over there, Jonathan, do ye mind?\x{2014}I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in a manner of speaking. Well, this man was a coming home-along from a wedding where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight night, and for shortness\x{2019} sake he took a cut across Forty-acres, a field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass. The bull seed William, and took after him, horns aground, begad; and though William runned his best, and hadn\x{2019}t much drink in him (considering \x{2018}twas a wedding, and the folks well off), he found he\x{2019}d never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself Well, as a last thought, he pulled out his fiddle as he runned, and struck up a jig, turning to the bull, and backing towards the corner. The bull softened down, and stood still, looking hard at William Dewy, who fiddled on and on; till a sort of a smile stole over the bull\x{2019}s face. But no sooner did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of William\x{2019}s breeches. Well, William had to turn about and play on, willy-nilly; and \x{2019}twas only <<three o\x{2018}clock|6>> in the world, and \x{2019}a knowed that nobody would come that way for hours, and he so leerybn and tired that \x{2018}a didn\x{2019}t know what to do. When he had scraped till <<about four o\x{2019}clock|6>> he felt that he verily would have to give over soon, and he said to himself, \x{201d}There\x{2019}s only this last tune between me and eternal welfare! Heaven save me, or I\x{2019}m a done man.\x{201d} Well, then he called to mind how he\x{2019}d seen the cattle kneel o\x{2019} Christmas Eves in the dead o\x{2019} night. It was not Christmas Eve then, but it came into his head to play a trick upon the bull. So he broke into the \x{2018}Tivity Hymn, just as at Christmas carol-singing; when, lo and behold, down went the bull on his bended knees, in his ignorance, just as if \x{2019}twere the true \x{2018}Tivity night and hour. As soon as his horned friend were down, William turned, clinked off like a long-dog,bo and jumped safe over hedge, before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him. William used to say that he\x{2019}d seen a man look a fool a good many times, but never such a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had been played upon, and \x{2019}twas not Christmas Eve ... Yes, William Dewy, that was the man\x{2019}s name; and I can tell you to a foot where\x{2019}s he a-lying in Mellstock Churchyard at this very moment\x{2014}just between the second yew-tree and the north aisle.\x{201d}",
