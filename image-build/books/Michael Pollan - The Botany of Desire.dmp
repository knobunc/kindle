            "Maybe that was the key. Maybe it was Swedenborg\x{2019}s thought that gave Chapman\x{2019}s mind just what it needed to dissolve all these paradoxes. In Swedenborg\x{2019}s philosophy there is no rift between the natural world and the divine. Much like Emerson, who cited him as an influence, Swedenborg claimed that there were <<one-to-one|10a:0>> \x{201c}correspondences\x{201d} between natural and spiritual facts, so that close attention and devotion to the former would advance one\x{2019}s understanding of the latter. Thus an apple tree in bloom was part of the natural process of making fruit at the same time it was a \x{201c}living sermon from God\x{201d}; likewise, a crow wheeling overhead was a type of the black forces waiting to overtake men\x{2019}s souls when they wandered off the Path. The river before you might be that Path, yet a wrong turn on it might land you in Newark, Ohio, a hard-drinking town notorious for gambling and prostitution that Chapman believed offered a literal preview of Hell. Everything before us was doubled; not this world or that, but both.",

            "It\x{2019}s hard to date with precision exactly when the bubble in Holland formed, but the autumn of 1635 marked a turning point. That\x{2019}s when the trade in actual bulbs gave way to the trade in promissory notes: slips of paper listing details of the flowers in question, the dates they would be delivered, and their price. Before then, the tulip market followed the rhythm of the season: bulbs could change hands only between the months of June, when they were lifted from the ground, and October, when they had to be planted again. Frenzied as it was, the market <<before 1635|18:0>> was still rooted in reality: cash money for actual flowers. Now began the windhandel\x{2014}the wind trade.",

            "The bubble logic driving tulipomania has since acquired a name: \x{201c}the greater fool theory.\x{201d} Although by any conventional measure it is folly to pay thousands for a tulip bulb (or for that matter an Internet stock), as long as there is an even greater fool out there willing to pay even more, doing so is the most logical thing in the world. By <<1636|9n:0>> the taverns were crowded with such people, and as long as Holland remained home to an expanding population of greater fools\x{2014}people blinded by their desire for instant wealth\x{2014}the truly foolish act would have been to abstain from the tulip trade.*",

            "Certainly the color break I spotted in Grand Army Plaza was like that\x{2014}a wayward splatter of paint on a monochromatic ground, an extravagance I might not have noticed if not for the scrupulous precinct of order\x{2014}of petal, of blossom, of plant\x{2014}in which it happened to detonate. Etymologically, the word extravagant means to wander off a path or cross a line\x{2014}orderly lines, of course, being Apollo\x{2019}s special domain. In this may lie a clue to the abiding power of the tulip, as well as, perhaps, to the nature of beauty. The tulip is a flower that draws some of the most exquisite lines in nature and then, in spasms of extravagance, blithely oversteps them. On the same principle, syncopation enlivens a regular, <<four-four|5l:0>> measure of music, enjambment the stately line of iambic pentameter. So here is a third constituent of beauty to add to the desiderata offered to us by the flower: first came contrast, then pattern (or form), and finally variation.",

            "Whenever I read something like this, I wonder, How do you tell when a jaguar is hallucinating? Then I think about Frank, my late, cranky old tomcat, who I became convinced used drug plants habitually in order to hallucinate. Every summer evening at <<around five|9c:1>>, Frank would lumber into the vegetable garden for a happy-hour nip of Nepeta cataria, or catnip. He would first sniff, then tug at the leaves with his teeth and proceed to roll around in paroxysms of what looked to me like sexual ecstasy. His pupils would shrink to pinpricks and take on a slightly scary thousand-mile stare, preparatory to pouncing on unseen enemies or\x{2014}who can say?\x{2014}lovers. Frank would crash-land in the dirt, pick himself up, do a funny little sidestep, then pounce again until, exhausted, he\x{2019}d go sleep it off in the shade of a tomato plant.",

            "I learned later that catnip contains a chemical compound, called \x{201c}nepetalactone,\x{201d} which mimics the pheromone cats produce in their urine during courtship. This chemical key just happens to fit an aphrodisiac lock in a cat\x{2019}s brain and apparently no other. It was amusing to watch a plant derange my cat, but also unsettling; for that brief interlude, Frank would wobble through the garden as though he were literally beside himself. Yet he\x{2019}d be back again the next day\x{2014}though, curiously, never before <<five|9c:1>>. Maybe he ritualized the practice to keep it under control; or maybe it took him the better part of the day to remember just where it was that the magic plant grew.",

            "A close call ended my career as a marijuana farmer. I\x{2019}d ordered a cord of wood from a man who\x{2019}d posted a flyer in town. He showed up with the first half early on a Saturday morning, a compact block of a man with a pewter crew cut, and asked where I wanted it stacked. Though open to the elements on two sides, the ruined barn did at least have a tight roof, and we agreed it was far and away the best place to stack the wood. But before getting down to work, the man and I fell into conversation, leaning there on the warm hood of his truck, enjoying the crisp October morning. Making small talk, I asked if he sold cordwood for a living. No, he chuckled, firewood was just a sideline, that and plowing driveways in the winter.
\x{201c}<<Nine to five|10a:0>>, I\x{2019}m chief of police of New Milford.\x{201d}
All at once the bones in my legs began to go soft. I found I could no longer form a sentence without specifically addressing the muscles in my lips. The barn, you see, was nothing more than a shell of boards, and no police officer standing in it could fail to spot the two green giants through the opening in the rear wall. But what else was I going to do? Dumping the wood anywhere but in the barn was ridiculous.",

One that\x{2019}s been selected to yield long, handsome french fries or unblemished, round potato chips is the expression of a national food chain and a culture that likes its potatoes highly processed.

            "Eventually the potato\x{2019}s undeniable advantages over grain would convert all of northern Europe, but outside Ireland the process was never anything less than a struggle. In Germany, Frederick the Great had to force peasants to plant potatoes; so did Catherine the Great in Russia. Louis XVI took a subtler tack, reasoning that if he could just lend the humble spud a measure of royal prestige, peasants would experiment with it and discover its virtues. So Marie Antoinette took to wearing potato flowers in her hair, and Louis hatched an ingenious promotional scheme. He ordered a field of potatoes planted on the royal grounds and then posted his most elite guard to protect the crop during the day. He sent the guards home at <<midnight|13>>, however, and in due course the local peasants, suddenly convinced of the crop\x{2019}s value, made off in the night with the royal tubers.",
