I dragged myself out of bed and moved like a greasy slug along the floor of my bedroom, into the hallway, out the front door into dazzling sunlight. Keeping my pajama pants on was an issue, but then it always is. Wiggling across the patchy grass lawn, I thought about Frank Williams, the late entry and surprise winner of our little contest. Father of four. Or was it <<five|9f>>? All boys. He was always trying to teach his sons to ride a bike. When it wasn\x{2019}t one son wobbling past my window with a hysterically tense grimace, it was another. I always hated the Williams boys for being slow learners. Now I felt sorry for them. No one should lose a parent through clumsiness. Their whole lives, those boys are going to have to say, \x{201c}Yeah. My father fell off a roof. Lost his balance. What?

But it is necessary for you to know where I stand on certain contentious issues so you\x{2019}ll know what kind of blunders I\x{2019}ll be making. Well, I am certainly not on the right. I don\x{2019}t care if gays get married or get divorced. Not that I\x{2019}m not for gay rights specifically, I\x{2019}m just against the phrase \x{2018}family values.\x{2019} In fact, when someone says the phrase \x{2018}family values,\x{2019} I feel like I\x{2019}ve been slapped in the face with a condom from <<1953|9c:0>>.

Eight hundred million people went to bed hungry today. All right, I\x{2019}ll admit for a while our roles as massively wasteful consumers seemed to be doing us a world of good\x{2014} we were slimming down, a good half of us had breast implants; frankly, we were looking good\x{2014} but now we\x{2019}re all fatter and more cancerous than ever, so what\x{2019}s the point of it? The world is getting hotter, the ice caps are melting, because man keeps saying to nature, Hey, our whole idea of a cozy future is to have jobs. That\x{2019}s all we\x{2019}ve got planned. What\x{2019}s more, we will pursue this aim at any cost, even, paradoxically, if it means the eventual destruction of our workplace. Man says, Sacrifice industry and economy and jobs? For what? Future generations? I don\x{2019}t even know those guys! I\x{2019}ll tell you something for free\x{2014} it makes me ashamed that our species, which is so finely ennobled by its sacrifices, winds up sacrificing it all for the wrong things and comes off just looking like a race of people who like to use the hair dryer while taking a bath. I\x{2019}m only sorry I was born three-quarters through this self-inflicted tragedy and not at the very beginning or at the very end. I\x{2019}m fucking sick of watching this tragedy in slow motion. The other planets aren\x{2019}t, though\x{2014} they\x{2019}re on the edge of their suns. The reason we\x{2019}ve never had visitors from outer space isn\x{2019}t that they don\x{2019}t exist but that they don\x{2019}t want to know us. We\x{2019}re the village idiots of all the teeming galaxies. On a quiet night you can hear their crackled laughter. And what are they laughing at? Let me put it this way: humanity is the guy who shits in his own pants and then walks around saying, \x{2018}So, do you like my new shirt?\x{2019} What\x{2019}s my point? To let you know I am an environmentalist insofar as I wouldn\x{2019}t like to live in a caldron of boiling piss. Believe me, there\x{2019}s no politics in staying alive. That\x{2019}s why I\x{2019}m an apolitical person entering the world of politics. But I\x{2019}m not perfect. Tell me, why have we been infected by that American disease of wanting our politicians to be pure as monks? Society went through the sexual revolution decades ago, but for some reason we judge the people who manage our economy by Victorian standards, and this doesn\x{2019}t seem strange to us. Let me get this out of the way\x{2014} if I see a chance of having an illicit affair with an intern or a colleague\x{2019}s wife, I will jump at it with both feet. As far as I\x{2019}m concerned, \x{2018}getting away with it\x{2019} has nothing to do with no one finding out and everything to do with no one falling pregnant. OK? I deny nothing. I admit everything. And let me say this to you too: I will not pretend that I\x{2019}m not attracted to certain high school girls. Some of them are seventeen, for Chrissakes. They\x{2019}re not children! They\x{2019}re sexy, blossoming young women, most of whom lost their virginity at fourteen!
