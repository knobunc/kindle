He had disappeared hours earlier from the ball, and he still sat here in his dinner coat, though it was <<long after midnight|13>>.",

            "Anson never lunched at home, for he went up to Boston each morning at <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>, like a man of affairs, with much business to care for. He kept an office in Water Street and went to it with a passionate regularity, to spend the day in the petty affairs of club committees and societies for the improvement of this or that; for he was a man who fortified his own soul by arranging the lives of others. He was chairman of a committee which \x{201c}aired\x{201d} young girls who had fallen into trouble, and contributed as much as he was able out of his own rather slender income to the activities of the Watch and Ward Society. And a large part of the day was spent in correspondence with genealogists on the subject of \x{201c}The Pentland Family and the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\x{201d} He did not in a whole year earn enough money to pay the office rent for one month, but he had no patience with the many cases of poverty and destitution which came to his notice. The stocks and bonds of the Pentland estate had been kept carefully out of his reach, by a father who distrusted activities such as Anson\x{2019}s, and even now, when he was nearly fifty, Anson had only a small income left by his grandfather and an allowance, paid him each month by his father, as if he were still a boy in college.",
