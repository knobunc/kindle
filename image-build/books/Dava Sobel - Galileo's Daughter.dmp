of a conduit that delivered wind from a waterfall inside a nearby mountain cave. Such ingenious systems ventilated numerous
sixteenth-century villas in the Italian countryside but may have admitted some noxious vapors along with the welcome zephyrs,
as apparently occurred in Galileo\x{2019}s case. When the men awoke from their two-hour nap, they complained of various symptoms
including cramps and chills, intense headache, hearing loss, and muscle lethargy. Within days, the strange malaise proved
fatal for one of its victims; the second man lived longer but also died of the same exposure. Galileo alone recovered. For
the rest of his life, however, bouts of pain, later described by his son as arthritic or rheumatic seizures, would strike
him down and confine him to his bed for weeks on end.",

available, now that a nun who desperately needs money wants to sell it; and, thanks to Suor Luisa\x{2019}s having spoken well on
my behalf, this nun prefers me over any of the others offering to buy it. But because its price is 35 scudi, while I have only ten, which Suor Luisa kindly gave me, plus the five I expect from my income, I cannot take possession of
