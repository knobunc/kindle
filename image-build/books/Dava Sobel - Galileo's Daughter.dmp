            "Fatefully during his Paduan idyll, while visiting friends outside the city, Galileo and two gentleman companions escaped the <<midday|13>> heat one afternoon by taking a siesta in an underground room. Natural air-conditioning cooled this chamber by means of a conduit that delivered wind from a waterfall inside a nearby mountain cave. Such ingenious systems ventilated numerous sixteenth-century villas in the Italian countryside but may have admitted some noxious vapors along with the welcome zephyrs, as apparently occurred in Galileo\x{2019}s case. When the men awoke from their two-hour nap, they complained of various symptoms including cramps and chills, intense headache, hearing loss, and muscle lethargy. Within days, the strange malaise proved fatal for one of its victims; the second man lived longer but also died of the same exposure. Galileo alone recovered. For the rest of his life, however, bouts of pain, later described by his son as arthritic or rheumatic seizures, would strike him down and confine him to his bed for weeks on end.",

            "As he neared completion of his treatise on floating bodies, Galileo penned an explanation to the grand duke and the general public as to why his new book concerned bodies in water, instead of continuing the great chain of astronomical discoveries trumpeted in The Starry Messenger. Lest anyone think he had dropped his celestial observations or pursued them too slowly, he could account for his time. \x{201c}A delay has been caused not merely by the discoveries of three-bodied Saturn and those changes of shape by Venus resembling the moon\x{2019}s, along with consequences that follow thereon,\x{201d} Galileo wrote in the introduction, \x{201c}but also by the investigation of the times of revolution around Jupiter of each of the four Medicean planets, which I managed in April of the past year, <<1611|9l>>, while I was at Rome. . . . I add to these things the observation of some dark spots that are seen in the Sun\x{2019}s body. . . .

            'To ban Copernicus now that his doctrine is daily reinforced by many new observations and by the learned applying themselves to the reading of his book, after this opinion has been allowed and tolerated for those many years during which it was less followed and less confirmed, would seem in my judgment to be a contravention of truth, and an attempt to hide and suppress her the more as she revealed herself the more clearly and plainly. Not to abolish and censure his whole book, but only to condemn as erroneous this particular proposition, would (if I am not mistaken) be a still greater detriment to the minds of men, since it would afford them occasion to see a proposition proved that it was heresy to believe. And to prohibit the whole science would be but to censure a hundred passages of Holy Scripture which teach us that the glory and greatness of Almighty God are marvelously discerned in all His works and divinely read in the open book of Heaven. For let no one believe that reading the lofty concepts written in that book leads to nothing further than the mere seeing of the splendor of the Sun and the stars and their rising and setting, which is as far as the eyes of brutes and of the vulgar can penetrate. Within its pages are couched mysteries so profound and concepts so sublime that the <<vigils|13>>, labors, and studies of hundreds upon hundreds of the most acute minds have still not pierced them, even after continual investigations for thousands of years.',

            "Stunned by the Protestant Reformation fomented in Germany <<around 1517|18:1>>, the Roman Church struck a defensive posture throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries called the Counter-Reformation. The Church hoped quickly to close the rift that had split Protestantism from Catholicism by convening an ecumenical council, but intrigues and obstacles of all sorts\x{2014} including disputes over where to stage the event\x{2014}postponed the meeting for many years, while the rift continued to widen. Finally, Pope Paul III (the same pontiff honored in the dedication of Copernicus\x{2019}s book) convened bishops, cardinals, and leaders of religious orders at Trent, where Italy bordered the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. On and off over a period of eighteen years, from 1545 to 1563, the Council of Trent debated and voted and ultimately drafted a series of decrees* These dictated how the clergy were to be educated, for example, and who was empowered to interpret Holy Scripture. Rejecting Martin Luther\x{2019}s insistence on the right to a personal reading of the Bible, the council declared in 1546 that \x{201c}no one, relying on his own judgment and distorting the Sacred Scriptures according to his own conceptions, shall dare to interpret them.\x{201d}",
