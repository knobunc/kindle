Diane was putting on a brave face. Simon had given her some kind of New Kingdom pep talk.

            'The display lasted eight hours. By morning I was at the local hospital lending a hand in the emergency ward. By <<noon|13>> I had seen seven separate cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, folks who had intentionally locked themselves in the garage with an idling car. Most were dead well before I pronounced them and the survivors were hardly better off. Otherwise healthy people, people I might have passed at the grocery store, would be spending the rest of their lives hooked up to ventilators, irreparably brain damaged, victims of a botched exit strategy. Not pleasant. But the gunshot wounds to the head were worse. I couldn\'t treat them without thinking of Wun Ngo Wen lying on that Florida highway, blood gouting from what remained of his skull.',

            'And no bowls or spoons. But I was as hungry as I was sleep deprived. I told Simon we ought to let the engine cool off, and while it did we sat in the shade of the car, windows rolled down, a gritty breeze coming off the desert, the sun suspended in the sky like <<high noon|13>> on the surface of Mercury. We used the torn-off bottoms of empty plastic bottles as makeshift cups and ate Cheerios moistened with tepid water. It looked and tasted like mucilage.',

            "The day dawned overcast. I did not, therefore, have to drive directly into the glare of the sun; but even this muted sunrise was dauntingly strange. The entire eastern half of the sky became a churning soup of red light, as hypnotic in its way as the embers of a dying campfire. Occasionally the clouds parted and fingers of amber sunlight probed the land. But by <<noon|13>> the overcast had deepened and within the hour rain began to fall\x{2014}a hot, lifeless rain that coated the highway and mirrored the sickly colors of the sky.",
