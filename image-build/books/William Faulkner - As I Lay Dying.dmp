never see him with a shirt on that looked like it was his in all my life. They
all looked like Jewel might have give him his old
ones. Not Jewel, though. He's long-armed, even if he is spindling. Except for the lack of sweat. You could tell they aint been
nobody else's but Anse's that way without no mistake. His eyes look like pieces
of burnt-out cinder fixed in his face, looking out over the land.
When the shadow touches the steps he says
\"It\x{2019}s <<five oclock|6>>.\"
Just as I get up Cora comes to the door
and says it's time to get on. Anse reaches for his shoes. \"Now, Mr
Bundren,\" Cora says, \"dont you get up now.\" He puts his shoes
on, stomping into them, like he does everything, like he is hoping all the time
he really cant do it and can quit trying to. When we
go up the hall we can hear them clumping on the floor like they was iron shoes.
He comes toward the door where she is, blinking his eyes, kind of looking ahead
of hisself before he sees, like he is hoping to find her setting up, in a chair
maybe or maybe sweeping, and looks into the door in that surprised way like he
looks in and finds her still in bed every time and Dewey Dell still a-fanning
her with the fan. He stands there, like he dont aim to
move again nor nothing else.",
