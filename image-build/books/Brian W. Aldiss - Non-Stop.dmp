            "When they came to the first subsidiary connection between decks, it was clearly enough marked. It stood in a short side corridor and consisted of two single metal doors a yard apart, each capable of closing off the corridor, although now blocked open with the ubiquitous green growth. Before <<one|9c:1>>, the words \x{2018}Deck 61\x{2019} were stencilled and, after the other, \x{2018}Deck 60\x{2019}. Marapper grunted in satisfaction at this, but was too hot to make further comment. Complain on his hunting had come across such connections before, and seen similar inscriptions, but they had meant nothing; now he tried to integrate the previous knowledge into the conception of a moving ship: but as yet the idea was too new to be acceptable.",

For instance, you accepted the fact that one sleep-wake in four was dark. Living at four times the normal rate, naturally four of your days or sleep-wakes only made one ordinary one. When the ship was a going concern \x{2013} on the voyage out to Procyon \x{2013} the lights automatically dimmed all over the vessel from <<midnight|13>> to six, partly to give a friendly illusion of night, partly to allow the servicers to work behind scenes, making any necessary repairs.
