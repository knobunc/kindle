In August Sam had first experienced something that her doctor thought might be an epileptic seizure, though for a month she\x{2019}d had no more. Then, <<just past midnight|10>> on the autumn equinox\x{2014}a night of wild wind\x{2014}Sam had her second seizure, a worse one than the first, taking hold of her small body and all its contents for nearly a minute, and no doubt about it then. And next day in the splendor of the blue morning, amid a pageant of fast-moving white clouds and the trees still softly gesturing with their turning leaves, Rosie drove Sam again to the doctor\x{2019}s, and talked long with him; and then went to the drugstore in Blackbury Jambs. So now Sam took a small dose of phenobarbital elixir, three times a day. Too young at barely five to swallow pills. Rosie had the bitter liquid with her, and a little plastic syringe without a needle to draw it up with and squirt it into Sam\x{2019}s mouth, after a battle, always a battle.",
