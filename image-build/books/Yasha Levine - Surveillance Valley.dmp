This was in the late 60s, before personal computers and desktop publishing so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions. Stewart and his team put out several issues of the Whole Earth Catalog and then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s and I was your age. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road. The kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: stay hungry, stay foolish. It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay hungry, stay foolish.

            "2. When the privacy community found out I bought tickets and planned to attend the event, they spent days insulting and making veiled threats against me on Twitter. Much of this was driven by Tor contractor Andrea Shepard, who tweeted out that she would consider my presence at 31c3 conference\x{2014}a public event attended by thousands of people, including journalists like myself\x{2014}to be \x{201c}stalking and aggression\x{201d} against her personally, and she warned that she would retaliate in \x{201c}self-defense.\x{201d} At some point on Twitter, she mentioned a hammer and alluded to the fact that drugging my drink would be \x{201c}liquid-phase hacking.\x{201d} Shepard was not just a random developer attending the conference but an employee of a contractor backed by powerful military and intelligence interests\x{2014}an organization that I had spent the past year investigating. So I took these threats seriously. I also saw them as a cynical attempt by a Pentagon contractor to escape scrutiny by framing critical investigative journalism as if it was nothing but personal harassment and stalking. Imagine if other powerful private military contractors like Blackwater or Booz Allen made similar claims against reporters? The situation worried Paul Carr, my editor at Pando, who grew concerned for my safety and reached out by email to Tor\x{2019}s executive director Shari Steele. \x{201c}To be clear, Yasha\x{2019}s trip to 32C3 has nothing to do with Ms Shepard (except in so far that she is an employee of Tor) and is part of our continuing coverage on Tor, hacking and surveillance,\x{201d} he wrote on December 19, 2015. \x{201c}Yasha is entitled to go about his job safely and without threats of violence, especially from paid employees of Tor. My normal next step as Yasha\x{2019}s editor would be to contact police in Berlin to put them on notice of the threat should Ms Shepard or one of her followers decide to act on it. Given the nature of the conference, that\x{2019}s not an ideal way to handle this situation. I\x{2019}d rather not be responsible for bringing police into a hacker conference. With that in mind, I\x{2019}m hoping someone at Tor can help.
