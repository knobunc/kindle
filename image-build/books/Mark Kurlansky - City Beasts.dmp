            "These questions raced through his mind as he walked into town. He had to see Romeo, but it was well known that Romeo spent all night in the clubs along the Malec\x{f3}n and did not get up until <<about four in the afternoon|9h>>. Baldito wandered through town, testing his craziness. Every minute until he did something about it the spider venom was making its way to his mind. Would he get crazier with time? So now was he only a little crazy? He stopped at the stand near Porvenir where a friend sold cane. He bought a stick and peeled off the end and started chewing and sucking in the sweetness. This was normal, right? He talked to his friend for a while about baseball. The friend wanted to know how his training was going and how much money he thought he could get for signing. And that seemed to go well. He didn\x{2019}t have an impulse to say anything strange. He didn\x{2019}t say, \x{201c}I think they will offer fifty million dollars.\x{201d}",

When he got to Romeo\x{2019}s apartment building it was exactly <<four|9f>>, though Baldito was not certain because he had no watch. Several Major Leaguers lived in the building and their black Monteros were lined up inside the gate. Romeo answered his door in a plush velvety wine-colored bathrobe and dark sunglasses that hid his eyes. Baldito could feel the cold air rushing out of the apartment like he was standing in the doorway of the walk-in on the dock where they froze the fish.",

The Basque ate every night at <<midnight|13>> in his apartment on Fifth Avenue near the Spanish embassy that was a six-story baroque palace. The apartment was new and clean-looking, unlike any place Segundo had ever been, and the kitchen was better than the one at the hotel school, though slightly smaller. The Basque knew everything about food and Segundo learned from him, but this was not the great chance the Revolution would offer him. That was still to come.",
