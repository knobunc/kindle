            "What happened next has become part of historical legend, a tale told to every American schoolchild. At <<ten o'clock that night|6>>, Warren and Revere met. They decided they had to warn the communities surrounding Boston that the British were on their way, so that local militia could be roused to meet them. Revere was spirited across Boston Harbor to the ferry landing at Charlestown. He jumped on a horse and began his \x{201c}<<midnight|13>> ride\x{201d} to Lexington. In two hours, he covered thirteen miles. In every town he passed through along the way \x{2014} Charlestown, Medford, North Cambridge, Menotomy \x{2014} he knocked on doors and spread the word, telling local colonial leaders of the oncoming British, and telling them to spread the word to others. Church hells started ringing. Drums started beating. The news spread like a virus as those informed by Paul Revere sent out riders of their own, until alarms were going off throughout the entire region. The word was in Lincoln, Massachusetts, by <<one A.M.|5>>, in Sudbury by three, in Andover, forty miles northwest of Boston, by <<five A.M.|5>>, and by <<nine in the morning|5>> had reached as far west as Ashby, near Worcester. When the British finally began their march toward Lexington on the morning of the nineteenth, their foray into the countryside was met \x{2014} to their utter astonishment\x{2014} with organized and fierce resistance. In Concord that day, the British were confronted and soundly beaten by the colonial militia, and from that exchange came the war known as the American Revolution.",

            "Here, then, is the explanation for why Paul Revere's <<midnight|13>> ride started a word-of-mouth epidemic and William Dawes's ride did not. Paul Revere was the Roger Horchow or the Lois Weisberg of his day. He was a Connector. He was, for example, gregarious and intensely social. When he died, his funeral was attended, in the words of one contemporary newspaper account, by \x{201c}troops of people.\x{201d} He was a fisherman and a hunter, a cardplayer and a theater-lover, a frequenter of pubs and a successful businessman. He was active in the local Masonic Lodge and was a member of several select social clubs. He was also a doer, a man blessed \x{2014} as David Hackett Fischer recounts in his brilliant book Paul Revere's Ride \x{2014} with an \x{201c}uncanny genius for being at the center of events.\x{201d} Fischer writes: When Boston imported its first streetlights in 1774, Paul Revere was asked to serve on the committee that made the arrangement. When the Boston market required regulation, Paul Revere was appointed its clerk. After the Revolution, in a time of epidemics, he was chosen health officer of Boston, and coroner of Suffolk County. When a major fire ravaged the old wooden town, he helped to found the Massachusetts Mutual Fire Insurance Company, and his name was first to appear on its charter of incorporation. As poverty became a growing problem in the new republic, he called the meeting that organized the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, and was elected its first president. When the community of Boston was shattered by the most sensational murder trial of his generation, Paul Revere was chosen foreman of the jury.",

            'This is surely part of the explanation for why Paul Revere\'s message was so powerful on the night of his <<midnight|13>> ride. News of the British march did not come by fax, or by means of a group e-mail. It wasn\'t broadcast on the nightly news, surrounded by commercials. It was carried by a man, a volunteer, riding on a cold night with no personal agenda other than a concern for the liberty of his peers. With Hush Puppies as well, perhaps the shoes caught the attention of Connectors precisely because they weren\'t part of any self-conscious, commercial fashion trend. Maybe a fashion Maven went to the East Village, looking for new ideas, and found out that you could get these really cool old Hush Puppies at a certain thrift store, for a very good price, and told his friends, who bought the shoes for themselves because there is something about the personal, disinterested, expert opinion of a Maven that makes us all sit up and listen. And why are the Zagat restaurant guides so popular? Partly it is because they are a convenient guide to all the restaurants in a given town.',

            "The results were fascinating. Dan Rather scored <<10.46|5a:0>> \x{2014} which translates to an almost perfectly neutral expression \x{2014} when he talked about Mondale, and <<10.37|5a:0>> when he talked about Reagan. He looked the same when he talked about the Republican as he did when he talked about the Democrat. The same was true for Brokaw, who scored <<11.21|5a:0>> for Mondale and <<11.50|5a:0>> for Reagan. But Peter Jennings of ABC was much different. For Mondale, he scored <<13.38|5a:0>>. But when he talked about Reagan, his face lit up so much he scored <<17.44|5a:0>>. Mullen and his colleagues went out of their way to try to come up with an innocent explanation for this. Could it be, for example, that Jennings is just more expressive in general than his colleagues? The answer seemed to be no. The subjects were also shown control segments of the three newscasters, as they talked about unequivocally happy or sad subjects (the funeral of Indira Gandhi; a breakthrough in treating a congenital disease).",

On the \x{201c}happy\x{201d} segments inserted for comparison purposes, he scored <<14.13|5a:0>>, which was substantially lower than both Rather and Brokaw.

            "But is the commercial theory of learning true? Daniel Anderson says that new research suggests that children actually don't like commercials as much as we thought they did because commercials \x{201c}don't tell stories, and stories have a particular salience and importance to young people.\x{201d} The original Sesame Street was anti-narrative: it was, by design, an unconnected collection of sketches. \x{201c}It wasn't just the ads that influenced the early Sesame Street,\x{201d} Anderson says. \x{201c}There was also a theoretical perspective at the time, based in part on (the influential child psychologist] Piaget, that a preschool child couldn't follow an extended narrative.\x{201d} Since the late 1960s, however, this idea has been turned on its head. At <<three|9t:0>> and <<four|20a:0>> and <<five|20a:0>>, children may not be able to follow complicated plots and subplots. But the narrative form, psychologists now believe, is absolutely central to them. \x{201c}It's the only way they have of organizing the world, of organizing experience,\x{201d} Jerome Bruner, a psychologist at New York University, says. \x{201c}They are not able to bring theories that organize things in terms of cause and effect and relationships, so they turn things into stories, and when they try to make sense of their life they use the storied version of their experience as the basis for further reflection. If they don't catch something in a narrative structure, it doesn't get remembered very well, and it doesn't seem to be accessible for further kinds of mulling over.\x{201d}",

            "The purpose of the experiment was to try to find out why prisons are such nasty places. Was it because prisons are full of nasty people, or was it because prisons are such nasty environments that they make people nasty? In the answer to that question is obviously the answer to the question posed by Bernie Goetz and the subway cleanup, which is how much influence docs immediate environment have on the way people behave? What Zimbardo found out shocked him. The guards, some of whom had previously identified themselves as pacifists, fell quickly into the role of hard-bitten disciplinarians. The first night they woke up the prisoners at <<two in the morning|5>> and made them do pushups, line up against the wall, and perform other arbitrary tasks. On the morning of the second day, the prisoners rebelled. They ripped off their numbers and barricaded themselves in their cells. The guards responded by stripping them, spraying them with fire extinguishers, and throwing the leader of the rebellion into solitary confinement. \x{201c}There were times when we were pretty abusive, getting right in their faces and yelling at them,\x{201d} one guard remembers. \x{201c}It was part of the whole atmosphere of terror.\x{201d} As the experiment progressed, the guards got systematically cruder and more sadistic. \x{201c}What we were unprepared for was the intensity of the change and the speed at which it happened,\x{201d} Ximbardo says. The guards were making the prisoners say to one another they loved each other, and making them march down the hall-way, in handcuffs, with paper bags over their heads. \x{201c}It was completely the opposite from the way I conduct myself now,\x{201d} another guard remembers. \"I think I was positively creative in terms of my mental cruelty.'' After 36 hours, one prisoner began to get hysterical, and had to be released. Four more then had to be released because of \x{201c}extreme emotional depression, crying, rage, and acute-anxiety.\x{201d} Zimbardo had originally intended to have the experiment run for two weeks. He called it off after six days. \x{201c}I realize now,\x{201d} one prisoner said after the experiment was over, \x{201c}that no matter how together I thought I was inside my head, my prisoner behavior was often less under my control than I realized.\x{201d} Another said: \"I began to feel that I was losing my identity, that the person I call \x{2014}, the person who volunteered to get me into this prison (because it was a prison to me, it still is a prison to me, I don't regard it as an experiment or a simulation...) was distant from me, was remote, until finally I wasn't that person.

            'There is a concept in cognitive psychology called the channel capacity, which refers to the amount of space in our brain for certain kinds of information. Suppose, for example, that I played you a number of different musical tones, at random, and asked you to identify each one with a number. If I played you a really low tone, you would call it <<one|9f>>, and if I played you a medium tone you would call it <<two|9f>>, and a high tone you would call three. The purpose of the test is to find out how long you can continue to distinguish among different tones. People with perfect pitch, of course, can play this game forever. You can play them dozens of tones, and they\'ll be able to distinguish between all of them. But for the majority of us, this game is much harder. Most people can divide tones into only about six different categories before they begin to make mistakes and start lumping different tones in the same category.',

You don't have enough things in common, and then you start to become strangers and that close-knit fellowship starts to get lost.\x{201d} Gross spoke from experience. He had been in Hutterite colonies that had come near to that magic number and seen firsthand how things had changed. \x{201c}What happens when you get that big is that the group starts, just on its own, to form a sort of clan.\x{201d} He made a gesture with his hands, as if to demonstrate division. \x{201c}You get two or three groups within the larger group.
