Cuervo told people that Sixto\x{2019}s scar was a bullet wound, a crease from an M16. Actually, some little brat back in Managua had thwacked him in the face with a Pepsi bottle, point-blank, blood all over the uniform. Even better, the kid got away.

Without a monitor, no one in the penthouse could see the newsman. However, Cuervo could hear the famous voice on the earpiece, which he mashed against his head with two nervous fingers.
