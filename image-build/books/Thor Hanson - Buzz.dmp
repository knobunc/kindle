            "Though scarce in Southeast Asia and absent from Australia, mining bees occur nearly everywhere else and number close to 3,000 species. They are particularly common in arid habitats with lots of open ground for digging their nest tunnels, which can reach a depth of nearly ten feet (three meters) for the larger species. All bees in this family are solitary, though some do nest in aggregations and occasionally share the same tunnels. Members of the most diverse genus (Andrena\x{2014}about 1,300 species) boast prominent fringed scopae that run the entire length of both back legs. They often specialize on one or a very few species of flowers, as do the tiny bees in the genus Perdita (<<about 700|18:0>> species). Perdita bees are extremely gentle, and many have lost the ability to sting. Studies have compared the reproductive strategies of mining bees in deserts to the seeds of the plants they rely on. Like seeds, dormant bees can endure in the soil for extended periods, waiting for up to three years for the rainfall that will bring a life-sustaining bloom. The bee pictured here is a female tawny mining bee (Andrena fulva) carrying a full pollen load into her nest tunnel. I\x{200c}LLUSTRATION \x{a9} CHRIS SHIELDS.",

            "28 group defense tactics: E. O. Wilson and other evolutionary thinkers maintain that the group defense of a nest is an essential condition for developing a fully eusocial lifestyle, so it\x{2019}s not surprising that the fiercest bee stings are found in highly social species like honeybees. What is surprising is that the largest group of eusocial bees have tiny, reduced stingers incapable of inflicting harm. The Meliponine or \x{201c}stingless\x{201d} bees include <<approximately 500|18:0>> mostly tropical species. Their evolutionary story remains controversial, but it appears they lost their sting after becoming eusocial, and many have since compensated by developing foul odors, mobbing behaviors, and painful bites augmented with caustic, blistering chemicals. Suicidal, kamikaze-style biters have even been proposed as a measure of altruism for stingless species. But why they didn\x{2019}t simply retain the stinging ability that helped them achieve sociality in the first place remains anyone\x{2019}s guess (see Wille 1983, Cardinal and Packer 2007, and Shackleton et al. 2015).",

            "Dredging dead bugs in pulverized grain may sound like a crude substitute for pollination, but my results were surprisingly informative. The flour behaved beautifully, separating into tiny white clumps that stuck to insect hairs just like the real thing. Orchardists know all about this, and they often mix flour with pollen in ratios as high as <<nine to one|10a:0>> when artificially fertilizing date palms, pistachios, or other high-maintenance trees. (Like adding water to soup to feed more people, this technique can stretch a small amount of pollen to reach a larger number of trees.) I lifted the bee out first. Flour covered its body like fake snow on a shopping mall Christmas tree, perfectly edging each leg and coating every tuft of exposed fuzz from stem to stern. I tapped the bee lightly and even blew a gentle wind across it, but most of the flour stayed put. On the scale, the bee\x{2019}s weight had increased by 28.5 percent, which would equate to something like a fifty-pound (twenty-three kilogram) backpack for an average-sized person. That\x{2019}s a pretty good haul for a stiff, inanimate specimen, and it\x{2019}s not surprising that live individuals do even better\x{2014}wild bumblebees have been caught carrying pollen loads in excess of half their body weight. Turning my attention to the wasp, I saw that it, too, carried a dusting of flour. But if the bee\x{2019}s load was like heavy snowfall, then this was the sort of faint trace that would surely disappoint skiers, snowboarders, or any child hoping for a day off from school. A few flecks of white clung to the spiky hairs on its abdomen and legs, but most of the wasp\x{2019}s body looked perfectly clean. My scale, accurate to the hundredth of a gram, registered no discernable increase in weight.",

            "History does not tell us whether Rev. Price suspected the significance of his bee observations, but experts now turn to the Ophrys example to understand how pollination strategies can lead to new species. The example is apt because, while questions about the parallel rise of bees and flowering plants date back to Darwin and Saporta, documenting that connection has proven surprisingly difficult. Any given bee/plant interaction usually takes place in the context of multiple pollinators, mimics, competitors, pests, and other factors playing out across a dynamic landscape, making it nearly impossible to tease out the effects of coevolution from the routine hum of individual adaptation. The time frame is also a challenge. With new lineages branching off on <<three to five|10a:0>> occasions every hundred thousand years or so, Ophrys orchids have diversified as fast as any plants studied to date. But since the average graduate student spends only two to four years on a project, and a whole career flashes past in mere decades, speciation can\x{2019}t exactly be studied in real time. Most efforts have instead remained theoretical, relying on broad evolutionary trends, simulations, and the reams of circumstantial evidence offered by pollination syndromes. Only recently have genetic and conventional approaches combined to show just how new species can arise from pollinator interactions, with the specialized flowers of Ophrys as a prime case study.",

            "10 perky splashes of red: By one way of thinking, even red would be limited. Some experts argue that birds favor red blossoms less out of preference than opportunity. They visit a range of colors, but since red flowers are invisible to most bees (or at least more difficult to find), they offer birds a nectar source with far fewer competitors, encouraging bird/plant specialization. Without bee competition driving that system, birds might be just as likely to visit other colors, such as in the bee-free flora of the Juan Fern\x{e1}ndez Islands, where only <<three of fourteen|10>> hummingbird-pollinated species are red.",

            "The Oxford English Dictionary traces the origin of the expression \x{201c}Duh!\x{201d} to a Merry Melodies cartoon from <<1943|9c:0>>. The similar term \x{201c}Doh!\x{201d}\x{2014}popularized by Homer Simpson\x{2014}got its start on a BBC radio program a few years later. Either phrase would have been appropriate for me in that forehead-slapping moment. As their name implies, digger bees dig, excavating nests in patches of bare soil, clay embankments, the walls of gullies and dry washes, or, when they can find them, the sheer faces of sandy cliffs. French entomologist Jean-Henri Fabre aptly dubbed them \x{201c}those children of the precipitous earthy banks.\x{201d} For years I had been hiking that trail and idly watching bees on its prolific flowers without ever connecting the fact that it followed the crest of just such an earthy bank\x{2014}a steep slope of sand and gravelly soil that rose to heights of fifty feet (fifteen meters) above the beach below. That afternoon, as soon as Noah was settled in for the restless period that counted as his nap, I grabbed a notebook and scurried down the beach for the first of many visits to a site still known in our family as \x{201c}Papa\x{2019}s Bee Cliff.\x{201d}",

            "I saw the very same behaviors and the same industrious vigor, but where Nininger estimated the population of his bee cliff in California\x{2019}s San Gabriel Mountains at <<around 100|3:0>> individuals, I could see thousands at a glance. Up close, the pockmarks in the cliff resolved into a carpet of nest holes as dense as 60 per square foot (630 per square meter). But even so, the sheer number of bees outstripped the space available, and I saw tussles break out continuously as resident females struggled to fend off interlopers and keep control of their burrows. More than once, an entangled pair dropped right down on top of me and rolled off again, still fighting as they tumbled together down the slope. If these had been true bumblebees instead of look-alikes, I might have worried about getting stung. But while diggers excavate their nests practically on top of one another, they remain fundamentally solitary, like mason bees, and lack the potent stings and coordinated defenses of social species. In fact, the digger variety at my cliff had taken their pacifist inclinations one step further. By mimicking a more dangerous species, they had engaged in a classic evolutionary bluff, adopting a threatening appearance that had become their primary means of defense. So long as bona fide bumblebees continued to sting, their digger mimics would be feared by association, allowing them to stop investing energy in their own defensive equipment and behavior. They still retained a stinging apparatus, but, as one observer noted, even with rough handling, \x{201c}they cannot be induced to sting.\x{201d}",

            "Nobody trusts an exoskeleton. The mere sight of insects and other arthropods can trigger a measurable fear reaction in the human brain. Often, synapses associated with disgust also light up. Psychologists believe these feelings are innate, an evolutionary response to something that might bite, sting, or transmit disease. But there is also a deep sense of otherness about those brittle, segmented bodies: even from a safe distance, we know that such creatures would give a sickening crunch if stepped upon. Mammals like us belong to the vertebrates, animals who all share the chaste trait of tucking their structural parts out of sight inside the body in the form of bones. Technically, putting the hard bits on the outside may be the better evolutionary strategy\x{2014}arthropod species outnumber vertebrates by more than <<twenty to one|10a:0>>. But the fact remains that people find exoskeletons creepy, particularly since they so often go along with faceted eyes, waving antennae, and multiple, scrabbling legs. Filmmakers understand this, which is why Ridley Scott based the terrifying monsters in Alien on insects and marine invertebrates rather than puppies, and why the scariest creature in The Lord of the Rings was not a pig-like orc or a cave troll, but Shelob, the giant spider. Even trained professionals sometimes fall prey to this squeamishness. In his book The Infested Mind, career entomologist Jeffrey Lockwood confessed to abandoning his research\x{2014}and transferring to the philosophy department\x{2014}after the grasshoppers he was studying suddenly overwhelmed him in a teeming swarm.",
