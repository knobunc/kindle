            "Glassware evolved dramatically over the course of the past hundred years. At the beginning of the twentieth century, drinks were served in small glasses made of glass. Then the middle of the century saw an explosion in nonglass vessels, a trend pioneered by Victor Bergeron and Donn Beach, who served drinks in coconuts and bamboo, miniature rum kegs and old-fashioned sugar pots, metal and ceramic, anything. In the contemporary era, these gimmicky containers have mostly gone the way of curiosities and collectibles, and we\x{2019}re back to the realm of the all-glass bar. But many of these glasses have grown immensely, and the classic V-shaped cocktail glass\x{2014}also known as a martini glass\x{2014}that once held about 3 ounces is now produced in sizes up to 14 ounces. In The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks by David Embury, published in 1949, he says about cocktail glasses, \x{201c}You will find them in sizes ranging from <<2|20b>> to <<3|20a>>\x{bd} ounces. Get the large ones\x{2014}not less than 3 ounces.\x{201d} If you came across a 3-ounce cocktail glass in a bar today, \x{201c}large\x{201d} would definitely not be the description to come to mind.",

            "Finally, it\x{2019}s crucial that the glass be appropriate to the cocktail, and the most important aspect of its appropriateness is size (although shape or material may also be crucial for the proper mixing of some drinks, such as the Pousse Caf\x{e9} and mint julep). And size really does matter, but not in the bigger-is-better sense; I happen to think that today\x{2019}s giant glasses are not only an abomination, they\x{2019}re downright dangerous. A martini is not meant to be an 8-ounce drink\x{2014}that\x{2019}s simply too much strong spirit. Most drinks are meant to be 3 ounces, maybe 4\x{2014}that is, <<12 to 15|10a:0>> good cold sips. But if you put this quantity into a 10-ounce glass, you look stingy. And if you fill a 10-ounce glass with something like a martini, you quickly have someone inebriated.

            "This liqueur is about to celebrate its five hundredth anniversary. How\x{2019}s that for brand longevity? It was first made in 1510 by the Benedictine monk Dom Bernard Vincelli, who lived in a fortified castle under the protection of the Duke of Normandy in the city of Faecamp. The Benedictine monks, like those of many other monasteries, disappeared during the anti-Catholic post\x{2013}French revolution period. Then, in 1836, a wine merchant in Faecamp by the name of Alexandra LeGrand unearthed the Benedictines\x{2019} recipe for a liqueur made from twenty-seven herbs and spices (among them hyssop, melissa, cinnamon, and thyme) infused in grain alcohol and then aged for two years in oak casks. The result is a light yellow liqueur with subtle herbal aromas and a sophisticated flavor that mixes well with brown spirits like brandy, bourbon, and scotch. By <<1937|9:0>>, one of the top cocktails at 21\x{2014}which itself was one of the top bars in the world\x{2014}was brandy mixed with Benedictine. Not surprisingly, this popularity caught the eye of the makers, who were not thrilled about losing half the sale of every drink that was, in essence, a showcase for their product. So they decided to bottle the product that became known as B&B\x{2014}Benedictine and brandy, pre-mixed in the bottle.",

Beginning in the 1880s, Maraschino cherries were available in the United States from the Luxardo company, which bottled marasca cherries in actual Maraschino liqueur.

By <<1920|9:0>>, the American version had pretty much entirely replaced the Italian import. Luxardo is still the brand name of choice for Maraschino liqueur. But, sadly, real Maraschino cherries\x{2014}marasca cherries bottled in Maraschino liqueur\x{2014}are hard to come by.
