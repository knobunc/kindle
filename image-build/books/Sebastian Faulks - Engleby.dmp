            "It\x{2019}s teatime on Friday in November. Mist is coming off the river and is drifting up towards the Victorian buildings where the girl students live, a short distance out of town. The road is lit by the lamps of bicycles; cars pass at their peril, slowly, because the pedalling girls, some frizzy and stout, some slight and eager, the girls with their lights front and rear, are the queens of the highway.  In the college, the kettle\x{2019}s on and the curtains are drawn since there\x{2019}s no daylight left in the Fens. East of the town, there are no hills until you come to the Urals, so they say, which explains why it\x{2019}s so cold, because there\x{2019}s nothing to stop the wind from the Russian steppe. This is one of those things they tell you when you first arrive, and you\x{2019}re meant to pass it on or tell your family about it in a letter. It\x{2019}s like a shibboleth or password, to show you\x{2019}re local now.  Back from games, the girls are flushed; their faces are red from the Ural wind. Red Russian wind from communist mountains, from the giant Soviet factories. Some girls are returning on foot from town, where they\x{2019}ve been to the University Library or to the shops. Jennifer is running down the corridor, lively with the sense of her good fortune. Her friend Anne\x{2019}s a Northern girl, dark. They\x{2019}re having tea now in Anne\x{2019}s room, which has a gas ring. Molly comes in with cake she bought in town: a sponge cake with cherries. They sit on chairs and floors and beds. There isn\x{2019}t much room, but there\x{2019}s always music on Anne\x{2019}s cheap record player at this time of day: a balladeer, a minstrel, shock-haired with a guitar \x{2013} afternoon songs for girls in jeans with coloured silk scarves knotted or held with silver woggles from Morocco. They wear little make-up; Anne has small round glasses. Cat Stevens is the singer. It\x{2019}s said the Jewish Chronicle had an article wondering if his real name was Steven Katz. He looks quite Jewish; he could be.  They ought to work, but they have to go to dinner in the dining hall at <<six-thirty|5b>> and by the time they\x{2019}ve finished tea it won\x{2019}t seem worth opening books for half an hour. So they talk instead. Jennifer\x{2019}s reading Carlos Castaneda, Anne has Jonathan Livingston Seagull hidden under a pillow. Anyway, they\x{2019}ve already been to lectures today in History, Physics and Anthropology, and to supervisions with a don. They talk and talk over the music. Molly\x{2019}s family is from Portsmouth. She talks of her boyfriend and whether he\x{2019}ll come to visit; her breath is warm with tea and cherries. Will he at least come to the summer ball? The other two are sympathetic. Boys are difficult to understand, in their opinion. They\x{2019}re like stage flats: colourful, exciting. Flat.  Jennifer has enough friends in her girls\x{2019} college not to mind about boyfriends. Anne sometimes tries to make her more interested in them because she finds Jennifer\x{2019}s detachment unconvincing. She doesn\x{2019}t want to admit how much she herself thinks about men, or more particularly, a man, the man \x{2013} a being as yet so incompletely imagined that all aspects are provisional, except one: he\x{2019}s male.  There are noises in the corridor. Laughter, crockery, music suddenly through an open door, which is then banged shut.  The lives of these young women make a sort of harmony. Their goodwill towards one another sets a tone in which intimacy can flourish; they\x{2019}re happy.  Dinner bell rings. Lights fade\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.  That\x{2019}s what I think it might be like, but I don\x{2019}t really know.",

            "Dear Mum and Dad,  Thank you for the letter and the tights and the cheque. All much appreciated.  It\x{2019}s really great living in a house. Anne and Molly are sharing a room at the moment because there was some sort of flood at the back and Nick refused to budge, even though he\x{2019}s got the best room by far. Typical man! Actually, it\x{2019}s best that they share as neither wants to share with Nick\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.  I\x{2019}ve done what you suggested, Mum, and painted the kitchen, and that has certainly cheered it up a lot. I also found a nice old armchair in a junk shop for my room.  The only thing is that it\x{2019}s so cold! God knows what it\x{2019}s going to be like in January. The gas fire in the sitting room works on a meter and no one ever wants to fork out for it. Nick always says he\x{2019}s going out, so he won\x{2019}t be using it.  As a result we don\x{2019}t use that room much and everyone goes to her own room to work, which is fair but a bit antisocial.  We have a rota for cooking and a kitty for shopping. Anne\x{2019}s the best cook but Nick complains she spends too much on food (meat especially) so we\x{2019}re going almost completely vegetarian. As Anne says, we can always be carnivorous at lunchtime. We each have a separate shelf in the fridge for our stuff, but even between four of us there never seems to be any milk.  The other problem is keys. It\x{2019}s just a single Yale lock, but Nick\x{2019}s is on semi-permanent loan to Hannah, who\x{2019}s meant to have one cut for herself but never seems to get round to it. So there\x{2019}s often a late-night banging at the door.  As well as a duvet and a rug, I sleep in my ski socks and don\x{2019}t turn the gas off in my room till the very last thing. Then I sprint across the floor and fly into bed.  But I love getting up in the morning. There\x{2019}s a tortoiseshell cat who lives opposite and he\x{2019}s half adopted us. I pull back the curtain and see him on the roof, stretching in the thin early sun. I love the jumble of small slate roofs on the brick terraced cottages. I lie watching for a few minutes while an \x{2018}inane disc jockey\x{2019} (Dad) babbles on the radio. Then I put on socks, slippers, sweater and coat and go down to the kitchen, and, while the kettle\x{2019}s on, open the back door to the cat and call him in. He tumbles off the roof of the shed and comes shyly to the step where (if lucky) he gets a saucer of milk and a stroke.  I make tea and drop a mug off for Anne (not for Molly \x{2013} no lecture till eleven) and go up and do my teeth (more toothpaste always appreciated: v exp). Do you really want to know all this?! Skip ahead if it\x{2019}s boring you, Mum\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.  Find suitable clothes (i.e. woolly, thick ones), make sure I have all the right books and go down for toast, quick Nescaff (if time) and wheel trusty bike out of hall on to street.  It\x{2019}s misty and cold, but bright as well, and the houses are so minute. They\x{2019}re like dolls\x{2019} cottages. I bicycle slowly (beware Girton calves\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.) down the backstreets and many times see the same town people leaving home, walking to the bus stop, taking in milk bottles. I think this is my favourite time of day. Occasionally I see a furtive undergraduate (male) skulking back to his college after a night out. Naughty boy.  It\x{2019}s wonderful to watch the town come awake, the shops opening, the buses pushing down St Andrew\x{2019}s Street from the station. But I prefer the backstreets. I cut down Pembroke Street and Silver Street and over the river and I think of all the people who\x{2019}ve gone before me \x{2013} the men in the Cavendish Labs and the Nobel prize-winners and Milton and Darwin and Wordsworth, of course, but mostly of the generations of young men and women who weren\x{2019}t famous but were so relieved to be here at last and to meet people like themselves, and didn\x{2019}t mind the freezing cold and no money for the meter and the greasy college breakfast. I think of the men in their tweed jackets with the elbow patches and the bluestockinged women in their clunky shoes and I feel glad for them still.  Incidentally (or \x{2018}incidently\x{2019} as Sally would spell it), I am still seeing something of Rob, though I promise you I am not \x{2018}getting serious\x{2019} and no, I haven\x{2019}t forgotten that I have all my life ahead of me, and no I haven\x{2019}t forgotten that at my age \x{2018}friendship is more important than romance\x{2019} (copyright \x{a9} 1968 by R.P. Arkland, MA; copyright renewed each year since\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.)  I get to the Sidgwick Site at <<8.45|9c:1>> and meet up with friends, including Rob, Stewart (if he\x{2019}s not in London or Hollywood\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.) and various girls from college. The faculty has organised the lectures v well for poor third-years facing Finals Armageddon, so all courses over by lunch. Usu three lectures \x{2013} say, nine, ten, twelve. From <<eleven till twelve|10>> I might be in the Faculty Library (provided roof not leaking: thank you, Mr James Stirling) or \x{2018}Advanced Research Centre\x{2019} \x{2013} i.e. tearoom. Best lectures from Dr Bivani (female: 19th century) or Mr Richardson (Mod. Europe); worst from horrid Dr Ditchley who is a monumental drag.  Often go back to coll for salad lunch in Upper Chamber (v good value) and in the afternoon I have volleyball on Tue and Thur, which I am really enjoying a lot. I always thought it was a bit of a joke at school, as you know, but in fact I really like it now. If not volleyball, often go to cinema (Arts or one of the mainstream ones) or coll library or to visit. Have met nice boy in Emmanuel (Charlie) reading English with amazing record collection and v amusing room-mate (Myles) from Leeds.  Early Fen darkness at <<five|9c:1>>, sometimes tea in the Whim (known to Charlie and Myles by rude alternative name, I\x{2019}m sorry to say), maybe go to bookshop or supermarket if I\x{2019}m cooking. It\x{2019}s lovely getting back to the house, being the first in and getting it warmed up and cosy \x{2013} as much as possible, at any rate. Listen to music on big sitting room stereo while kettle boils and make toast. Charlie lent me record by a group called Focus. Dutch, with keyboards, beautiful guitar \x{2013} ah, but you wouldn\x{2019}t appreciate it!  On Monday, after supper, it\x{2019}s Society meeting in Jesus, which means a bit of preparation and homework. Not many people last week, which was disappointing \x{2013} just the hard core, three or four freshers and that guy Mike I told you about(!).  Most evenings I work for a couple of hours, but I do go out a fair bit too. Rob takes me to various college jazz or folk clubs or sometimes just for a drink to one of the town pubs. The Mitre has a great jukebox. There\x{2019}s one called the Baron of Beef next door, which is also good fun. Best of all I like the ones in this part of town, away from the centre. Tiny backstreet rooms by the river with small coal fires. Don\x{2019}t worry, we don\x{2019}t get drunk.  I finally got to see a rough cut of the film we made in Ireland, and I must say I think it\x{2019}s really good. Stewart is a very talented guy. There\x{2019}s one scene I\x{2019}m in which you\x{2019}re not going to like \x{2013} I might as well warn you now. (Though you may never see it. It\x{2019}s not obligatory. It won\x{2019}t be on general release, so you\x{2019}d need to go to a Film Soc special screening. But knowing you, you will. Like that rude book I warned you not to read and you went straight out and bought it.) Hannah is absolutely amazing and makes me look very inadequate. Even when someone else is speaking she seems to fill the screen. Alex is much better than I expected, though a bit eager in places.  There\x{2019}s so much going on and not enough time to do it all. I\x{2019}m doing extra French Lang (to help with document research) with a little old lady off Lensfield Road and when I walk back I see the posters in the cottage windows: University String Ensemble, \x{2019}Tis Pity She\x{2019}s a Whore, Julius Caesar at the ADC, Newnham Madrigal Society, The Good Person of Szechwan at St John\x{2019}s\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I know it\x{2019}s a clich\x{e9}, but there aren\x{2019}t enough hours in the day.  Of course Finals are a worry, but I try not to think about it (them) too much. If I do get a youknowwhat (like the Scottish play, can\x{2019}t mention the word) it could cause more problems than it solves by more or less obliging me to go into what Rob calls \x{2018}research\x{2019}. So might be better off with \x{2018}gentleman\x{2019}s\x{2019} degree, Dad. Qu\x{e9} sera, sera, that\x{2019}s what I say. What an original daughter you have!  I\x{2019}m glad you enjoyed Penny Martin\x{2019}s wedding. If you couldn\x{2019}t get an invite to Princess Anne and Mark Phillips\x{2019}s, I\x{2019}m sure Brian and Gail\x{2019}s was the second best place to be. Did Gail do her special cheesy things? Did Brian make a speech? In which case, is he still going?  It\x{2019}s <<nearly midnight|13>>. Incidently (Sally again), I read in the paper that Grocer Heath is thinking of introducing a three-day week. I told Rob last night and he said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m not doing an extra day\x{2019}s work for anyone.\x{2019} I thought you might like that.  Now I really must stop and go to bed. Before I turn the light off, maybe one final blast, Dad, of \x{2018}deafening popular music\x{2019}\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.  Later: Ah, that\x{2019}s more like it. Long guitar solo by Jan Akkerman, max vol through the headphones. Now I can sleep easy.  Lots of love from your loving, very hard-working, rather poor and exceedingly cold (but happy) daughter,  Jen-Jen xxx  There was one bit in Jennifer\x{2019}s letter I really didn\x{2019}t like, and I expect you can guess what it was.

 Train drivers\x{2019} strike meant had to come back by car. Term starts Tue, but Dad only free at weekend, so three days early. Love being early, can enjoy place with no work to do and time to sort things out, e.g. stock up on food and get boiler working. Had to be Sat as Sunday is Dad\x{2019}s tennis \x{2013} over-forties doubles semi-finals day. Journey took ages as we could not exceed 50 mph speed limit (new E. Heath law to save petrol). But as usual Dad was v nice about it in the end. As we got nearer and nearer he became more and more solicitous. \x{2018}Now, Jen-Jen, have you got all you need? Do you want to stop at Boots?\x{2019} Pretty sure \x{2018}Boots\x{2019} is euphemism for Pill. \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t worry, Dad, everything\x{2019}s fine.\x{2019} I don\x{2019}t know if he thinks am virg. int. Can\x{2019}t bear even to imagine how upset he would be. So do not think about it at all. (Almost.)  But did good stock-up at Sainsbury\x{2019}s, rice, spag, tea, tins, stock cubes, long-term stuff and dear Dad paid all. All seemed much better between him and M, which is a great relief. Tilly tells me she pretty sure he has dumped bitch at work. (T very knowing for 16-yr-old.)  Gail Martin still clearly has hots for D but he treats her with distance bordering on disdain. Clearly excites G even further.  Xmas was great in the end. Robin came down afterwards. We all went skating at Southampton rink. R very polite to M and D, though noticed quiet scrutiny from D. Not sure he really approves, but nothing I can do. Still keen on R and all going well. Don\x{2019}t know what will happen in June, but that still seems a long way off. Jill in Homerton apparently became engaged over Xmas! Will I ever feel that grown up?  Alone in house tonight. Slightly creepy atmosphere. For first time v much wish had TV. Went for drink alone in typical tiny pub with coal fire and jukebox. Had two halves beer and got kebab with mountain of raw onion later on Mill Road. Not v good start diet/healthwise, but bicycled vigorously home to compensate.  Had left gas fire on while out, so bedroom lovely and warm while rest of house arctic. V tempting to sleep late tmw, but lot to do so dutifully set alarm for 8. Hope Catty will drop in.  I am looking forwd to this term. Life v settled \x{2013} viz. house, Robin, work (know what necessary), friends, projects \x{2013} but also enough variables to keep gloss on it. Leaving aside June and End of Era, still so much unpredictable to be had from friends and their lives, and parties and meetings etc. Feel v lucky and not that cold . Goodnight Dad. Thank you for everything. Sleep well back in Lym. x  MONDAY 14 JAN
 Rang phone people to reconnect. First appntmt not for three weeks\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Anne says have to pretend to be pregnant \x{2013} ergo needing emergency line \x{2013} to get anyone to help.  Train strike, coal strike, power strike. V hard to get anything done.  Catty no show at first but looked in later and I gave him milk. He a bit stand-offish. Perhaps punishing me for absence.  As I was crossing St Andrew\x{2019}s Street, saw Charlie from Emma. He invited me for tea. I like him, but he\x{2019}s very nervous. Wonder if gay? What wrong with all these boys that only fancy each other? Mind you, not sure about C. Many heteros wear eyeliner \x{2013} Roxy/Bowie fashion thing. Some look good, though not as good as B. Ferry or B. Eno.  Went to Sidgwick, got full lecture schedule and borrowed books from fac lib. Didn\x{2019}t see anyone. Had cornish pasty and orange-and-lemonade at Mill for lunch. Mike (!) from Tipperary was at the bar. Never discovered what actual college he from, therefore known only as \x{2018}Mike from Tip\x{2019} or \x{2018}Irish Mike\x{2019} as though he not at uni at all but emerged from Emerald Isle. Robin unkindly calls him \x{2018}Prufrock\x{2019}. Managed to finish lunch and slip out without being seen. M looked as though in for long Guinness afternoon. Where does he get his money from? Dope, I suppose, of which he always has a hell of a lot.  Beautiful day. River sparkling in cold winter sun. Wheeled bike through Queens\x{2019} just for pleasure of looking at. Can\x{2019}t wait for everyone to be back. Went and bought food for welcome dinner tonight for Anne, Moll and Nick (I think). Also litre of Sainsbury\x{2019}s Moroccan red.  Had tea with Charlie in Emma Old Court overlooking paddock with ducks. He played some v heavy band on stereo. Offered to lend it to me. Declined. Nice rooms, though, large with two bedrooms. Myles came back from vac in Leeds. V funny about.  Something unstable and vulnerable about Charlie. Donnish joke about his room number involving Auden play title, The Ascent of F6. Sense he not happy at all, though smiles a lot.  What will happen to all these people? Previous generations did great things in politics, diplomacy, medicine, industry, \x{2018}the arts\x{2019} \x{2013} became great and good as though by natural progression, birthright.  All people I know resolute that they will do no such thing. No one will have \x{2018}<<nine to five|10a:1>>\x{2019} job. Can\x{2019}t imagine anyone I know here appearing on television in 20 years\x{2019} time to offer expert view on \x{2013} anything. Just not cut out for it.  I wonder why. Drugs? Partly, but we\x{2019}re not all out of it all the time. A generation thing, I suppose. We are a lost gen. (Rather than lost Jen, ha, ha.) Before us, the hippies; after us, perhaps keen people in suit and tie who will go straight to work in Con Party research and American banks. Poor us, lost souls. Maybe from ashes, one or two prophets or meteors? S. Forres in films? Him apart, wipeout. Hannah maybe, cd be head of Oxfam or something. Doubt she will make it as an actress \x{2013} between you and me, dear D\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.  Here are my resolutions for 1974, a little late:  1. Work six hours each day in organised way.

Jill v pretty. Stop Press has found brilliant non-sexist way of referring to this (and it would be bizarre not to) by referring to her always as \x{2018}Personable Jill Lewis\x{2019}.

Malini Coomaraswamy at her bespectacled sternest asked chief steward why no option available, pointing to single dish of sweaty dumpling and gravy. \x{2018}Of course there\x{2019}s an option, miss. You can either\x{2019}ave it, or not\x{2019}ave it.\x{2019} (Mal does brilliant E. Anglia accent. You had to be there\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.)  Worked in my room till <<four|9f>>, then to volleyball. Was wearing purple Hendrix tee shirt and nice shorts I\x{2019}d borrowed from Emma Mitchell and conveniently forgotten to return. Good practice for Friday match v Newnham. Still don\x{2019}t like way Ursula stands so close in shower. Anne convinced Ursula \x{2018}not as other women\x{2019}. Hid self modestly as far as possible, but she solicitous with soap and shampoo loan. Had to have shower as meeting Rob in Whim for late tea.  Starving after \x{2018}healthy option\x{2019} lunch and v\x{2019}ball so had banana cake as well as toast and lovely fresh Darjeeling tea \x{2013} much to Rob\x{2019}s delight. \x{2018}Mmm, you tuck in, Jen\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. What about a poached egg on that?\x{2019} etc. He looking annoyingly gaunt and handsome as ever.  We went to see a friend of his, Tim, in Queens\x{2019} and sat by the river, talking about Donne\x{2019}s poetry. I found this a bit awkward, as have barely read D, except the famous ones. R and T took very opposite views on D\x{2019}s concept of romantic love, whether based on sex, fear of dying, and general early 17th C darkness (R), or something more spiritual and \x{2018}corollary of the divine\x{2019}(T).  It was a beautiful evening and the talk moved on, via Newton\x{2019}s obsession with alchemy and fear of God. This fear, according to Tim, held Newton back from outlining an ungodly theory of relativity 200+ yrs before Einstein. Then on to Watergate \x{2013} Haldeman and Ehrlichmann (?sp) resignation \x{2013} then to who had or had not been invited to some big party in Trinity on Sat. Not me. (Incidentally, didn\x{2019}t my O level German tell me Ehrlichmann means \x{2018}honest man\x{2019}?)  Rob persuaded me to go and see a film at the Arts about sex psychologist Wilhelm Reich, called W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism. Funny because so earnest and so dull. Came alive only when Nancy Someone made plaster cast of a young man\x{2019}s membrum virile, as Miss Goff of the 5th Form might have called it. Prodigious size. R somewhat crestfallen afterwards. Told him man chosen for that reason only. After all, what other quals needed in castee? R somewhat reassured \x{2013} don\x{2019}t know if he has anything to worry about in that dept!  We had kebab in Rose Crescent then I took him to the Baron of Beef for a drink to cheer him up. Worked wonders. Met Hannah (who had just done a performance of The Three Sisters), Amit, Nick and one or two others. I made an excuse to go and do some work, but they wouldn\x{2019}t hear of it, and <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> found us in Amit\x{2019}s room in King\x{2019}s, listening to Neil Young After the Gold Rush, drinking wine and smoking mild grass.  Can do essay over the weekend as have nothing else on.  Got back OK through night gate just before lock-up at <<one|9c:1>>. Felt a bit wobbly on the way, but bike steered itself, as Dad would say. Crept up to room. Teeth. Bed. Fell asleep at once.  Wonderful day.  I\x{2019}ve always had what Jen might call a \x{2018}prodigious\x{2019} memory, and it\x{2019}s not that difficult to recall her diary because the story provides a continual prompt. I know what happened next, so it\x{2019}s easy to be reminded. Also, she\x{2019}s a rather mannerly narrator, alternating splurge about her feelings with description of outside events and other people. Thus after some stuff about lack of self-esteem, bad haircut: \x{2018}In the forenoon, we did call upon Mrs Thrale\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{2019}",

The cup of tea at <<seven|9c:1>>: strong, hot and fresh because my dormitory was near the kitchen block. If I drank it quickly and timed my call properly, the auxiliary would stop on her way out and refill my cup. The sense of triumph lasted most of the morning. Or the Nescaf\x{e9} at <<nine|9c:1>>. I used to be fussy about espresso and filter and cappuccino and all that. But the single spoon of standard Nescaff from a catering tin dissolved in hot-ish water was something for which I began to salivate from <<eight-thirty|5k:1>> onwards.",

It was uphill work for him, me and the rest of the class, but he was adamant that the transmitter signals from Redruth were giving him the all-clear. In August, he brought me a piece of paper that reported he had scored an A-star. The thrill rather went out of it for me after that.",
