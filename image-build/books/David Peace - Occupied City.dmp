            "We watch as Miss Akuzawa gets up to open the side door for our killer. You say he is forty-two years old. Our killer presents his name-card: Yamaguchi Jir\x{14d} MD; Technical Officer; Ministry of Health and Welfare. You say he is fifty-four. Our killer asks to see the manager. You say he is forty-six years old. Miss Akuzawa asks our killer to come round to the front door. You say he is fifty-eight. Our killer goes back outside. You say he is five feet four inches tall. Our killer opens the front door. You say he is five feet three inches. Miss Akuzawa has a pair of slippers waiting for him. You say he is five feet five inches tall. Our killer takes off his boots in the genkan. You say he is five feet two. We listen as Miss Akuzawa tells our killer that the manager has already left, but that the assistant manager will see him. You say he has a thin build. We watch as our killer nods and thanks Miss Akuzawa, as she leads our killer through the bank. You say he has a medium build. We watch our killer pass us in our rows of desks as we work. You say he has an average build. We listen as Miss Akuzawa introduces our killer to the assistant manager, Mr Yoshida. You agree he is rather thin. Our killer bows. You say he has an oval face. Our assistant manager offers our killer a seat. You say he has a long face. Our killer sits down, his face to the right. You say he has a high nose. Our assistant manager stares at the name-card: Yamaguchi Jir\x{14d} MD; Technical Officer; Ministry of Health and Welfare. You say he has a handsome face. Our killer tells our assistant manager there has been an outbreak of dysentery in the neighbourhood. You say he has a pale complexion. Our assistant manager now presents his own name-card: Yoshida Takejiro; Assistant Manager; Teikoku Bank; Shiinamachi branch, Nagasaki-ch\x{14d}, Toshima Ward, Tokyo. You say he has a jaundiced complexion. Our killer tells Mr Yoshida that the source of the outbreak is the public well in front of the Aida residence in Nagasaki 2-ch\x{14d}me. You say he has two brown spots on his left cheek. Mr Yoshida nods and mentions that the bank\x{2019}s manager, Mr Ushiyama, has in fact left early due to severe stomach ache. On his right cheek. Our killer tells Mr Yoshida that one of Mr Aida\x{2019}s tenants has been diagnosed with dysentery and that this man made a deposit in our branch today. You say he has a bruise on his left cheek. Mr Yoshida is amazed that the Ministry of Health and Welfare has heard of the case so quickly. A scar on his right. Our killer tells Mr Yoshida that the doctor who saw Mr Aida\x{2019}s tenant reported the case promptly. You say he has close-cropped hair. Mr Yoshida nods. You say his hair is grey. Our killer says he has been sent by Lieutenant Parker, who is in charge of the disinfecting team for this area. You say his hair is rather long and grizzled. Mr Yoshida nods again. You say his hair is dark. Our killer has been told to inoculate everyone against dysentery and to disinfect all items that may have been contaminated. You say he wears a brown lounge suit. Mr Yoshida nods for a third time. You say he wears an old winter suit. All members, all rooms, all cash and all money in this branch, says our killer. You say he wears a uniform. Mr Yoshida stares at the name-card again: Yamaguchi Jir\x{14d} MD; Technical Officer; Ministry of Health & Welfare. You are sure it was a uniform. Our killer says that no one will be allowed to leave until his work has been completed. You say he wears a brown overcoat. Mr Yoshida glances at his watch. You say he carries an overcoat. Lieutenant Parker and his team will arrive soon to check the job has been done properly, says our killer. You say he wears one coat but carries another. Mr Yoshida nods. You say he carries a spring coat. Our killer now places his small olive-green bag on Mr Yoshida\x{2019}s desk. You say he wears brown rubber shoes. Mr Yoshida watches our killer open the bag. You say he wears burnt orange rubber boots. Our killer takes out a small metal box and two different-sized bottles marked in English. You say there was mud on his shoes. Mr Yoshida reads the words FIRST DRUG on the smaller 200CC bottle and SECOND DRUG on the 500CC bottle. You say his boots were clean. Our killer tells Mr Yoshida that this is an extremely potent oral antidote which the Americans have recently developed through experiments with palm tree oil. You say he wears a white cloth band on his left arm. Mr Yoshida nods. You say it reads in red \x{2018}Leader of Disinfecting Team\x{2019}. It is so powerful that you will be completely immunized from dysentery, says our killer. You say he wears a Tokyo Metropolitan Office armband. Mr Yoshida nods again. You say it reads in black \x{2018}Disease Preventative Doctor\x{2019}. Our killer warns Mr Yoshida that the administration procedure is complicated and unusual. You say he wears a Toshima Ward armband. Again, Mr Yoshida glances at the name-card on his desk: Yamaguchi Jir\x{14d} MD; Technical Officer; Ministry of Health & Welfare. You say it reads \x{2018}Epidemic Prevention Team\x{2019}. Our killer asks Mr Yoshida to gather his staff. You say he carries a small olive- green shoulder bag over his right shoulder. Even the caretaker, his wife and two children? asks Mr Yoshida. Or was it his left? Our killer nods. You say he carries a doctor\x{2019}s bag. Mr Yoshida rises from his desk. A black doctor\x{2019}s bag. Mr Yoshida calls us over. I am Takeuchi Sutejiro and I am forty-nine years old but here I am no longer Takeuchi Sutejiro and now I am no longer forty-nine years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. We rise from our desks. I am Watanabe Yoshiyasu and I am forty-three years old but here I am no longer Watanabe Yoshiyasu and now I am no longer forty-three years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. We shuffle through the bank. I am Nishimura Hidehiko and I am thirty-eight years old but here I am no longer Nishimura Hidehiko and now I am no longer thirty-eight years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. We gather around Mr Yoshida\x{2019}s desk. I am Shirai Shoichi and I am twenty-nine years old but here I am no longer Shirai Shoichi and now I am no longer twenty-nine years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. We all watch as our killer turns to Miss Akuzawa, as our killer asks her to bring enough teacups for all the members of the branch. I am Akiyama Miyako and I am twenty-three years old but here I am no longer Akiyama Miyako and now I am no longer twenty-three years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. Miss Akuzawa fetches sixteen teacups on a tray. I am Uchida Hideko and I am twenty-three years old but here I am no longer Uchida Hideko and now I am no longer twenty-three years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. Our killer opens the smaller bottle marked FIRST DRUG. I am Sawada Yoshio and I am twenty-two years old but here I am no longer Sawada Yoshio and now I am no longer twenty-two years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. Our killer asks if everybody is here. I am Kato Teruko and I am sixteen years old but here I am no longer Kato Teruko and now I am no longer sixteen years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. Our assistant manager counts our heads and nods, everybody is here. I am Takizawa Tatsuo and I am forty-six years old but here I am no longer Takizawa Tatsuo and now I am no longer forty-six years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. Our killer holds a pipette as though it were a dagger in his hand. I am Takizawa Ryu and I am forty-nine years old but here I am no longer Takizawa Ryu and now I am no longer forty-nine years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. We all watch as our killer drips some clear liquid into each of our cups. I am Takizawa Takako and I am nineteen years old but here I am no longer Takizawa Takako and now I am no longer nineteen years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. We all listen as our killer tells each of us to pick up our own teacup. I am Takizawa Yoshihiro and I am eight years old but here I am no longer Takizawa Yoshihiro and now I am no longer eight years old; now I am always struggling, here I am only weeping. Each of us reaches for our own cup. We who are here now in the grey. Now our killer raises his hand in warning. We who are always, already struggling. We all listen as our killer warns us of the strength of the serum, the damage it can cause to our gums and tooth enamel if we do not watch our killer\x{2019}s demonstration carefully, if we do not follow our killer\x{2019}s instructions precisely. We who are always, already only weeping. We all watch as our killer now takes out a syringe. You define us as the victims. We all watch as our killer dips his syringe into the liquid. You damn us as the victims. We all watch as our killer draws up a measure of the liquid into the syringe. You are happy to remember us in the black and white of our deaths. We all watch as our killer opens his mouth. You are ignorant of us in the colour of our lives. We all watch as our killer places his tongue over his bottom front teeth and then tucks it under his lower lip. We are evidence at a crime scene. We all watch as our killer drips the liquid onto his tongue. We are bodies in a crime book; bodies, never characters. We all watch as our killer tilts his head back. In our lives you did not know us. We all watch as our killer stares at his wristwatch, his right hand in the air. Only by our deaths did you find us. We all watch as our killer\x{2019}s hand falls. At a crime scene. We all listen as our killer tells us that this medicine may damage our gums and our teeth, as our killer tells us we must all swallow quickly. In a crime book. We all nod. Our names, our faces. We all listen as our killer tells us that exactly one minute after we have taken the first medicine, he will administer the second medicine. In print and in photographs. We all stare at the 500CC bottle marked SECOND DRUG. Reduced to a number. We all listen as our killer promises us that after we have taken the second medicine, we will be able to drink water or rinse out our mouths. <<Twelve|9k:0>>, you will always write 12. Now our killer tells each of us to lift up our cups. In this number, this number 12. We all pick up our teacups. In this number, we die again. And now each of us drinks. Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Our killer tells us to drip the liquid onto our tongues. For we are not twelve. And now we all taste the bitter liquid. We are Takeuchi Sutejiro, Watanabe Yoshiyasu, Nishimura Hidehiko, Shirai Shoichi, Akiyama Miyako, Uchida Hideko, Sawada Yoshio, Kato Teruko, Takizawa Tatsuo, Takizawa Ryu, Takizawa Takako and Takizawa Yoshihiro. We all swallow it down. We who are here now in the grey. And we hear our killer tell us he will administer the second drug in exactly sixty seconds. We who are always, already struggling. We see our killer looking at his wristwatch. We who are always, already only weeping. We see him staring at his wristwatch. Weeping and waiting. We all wait for the second drug. Waiting and watching. We all watch as our killer pours the second drug into each of our teacups. Watching and reaching. We all reach for our cups again. Reaching and waiting, again. Again we all wait as our killer checks his wristwatch, and again we all wait for the signal. For the smile. Now we all see our killer gesture for each of us to drink again. With a smile. And we all drink. And you smile as we drink. And we all see our killer waiting. Still smiling. And we all see our killer still watching us. That smile on your face. And now we all feel the second liquid in our mouths, now in our throats, now in our stomachs. But you are smiling. And now we all hear our killer telling us to rinse out our mouths. Still smiling, still smiling, still\x{2026}",

A handsome man; well composed and looking like an intelligent man / Brief account of the case: The victims opened their business as usual at <<0930 hrs|1>>, and after Ushiyama Senji, their manager, went home with stomachache <<about 1400 hrs|1>>, continued at their work till <<1500 hrs|1>>, when they closed the front door and began winding up the remaining affairs for the day / At <<approximately 1530 hrs|1>> the offender made his sudden appearance at the side entrance and, showing his name-card (printed with false title, as described above) to Akuzawa Yoshiko, one of the victims, expressed his wish to see the chief. So the latter showed him into the office-room, and Yoshida Takejiro, the assistant chief, had a talk with him / According to the statement of the offender, there have cropped up a number of dysentery cases among those who drink the water of a public well in front of Aida\x{2019}s, and have been reported to Lieutenant Porton (or something sounding like that) as well as to the Japanese police. So a disinfecting team of the Allied Forces was coming, he said. He himself was dispatched by the lieutenant in advance of the said team to make an investigation, as a result of which he found that an inmate of the house of a dysentery sufferer had visited their office on the day. In accordance, everything in the office, including the books, papers, banknotes, etc., must receive a disinfecting process, for which nothing should be carried out till the arrival of the disinfecting team, he declared / When Yoshida said to him: \x{2018}How can you have got the knowledge so soon, I wonder?\x{2019} the offender said in reply: \x{2018}In truth, the doctor who made an inspection of the sufferer has made a direct report to the Occupation authorities.\x{2019} / \x{2018}The disinfecting team will soon be here,\x{2019} continued the villain, \x{2018}and in the meanwhile you all must take this medicine given us by the Occupation authorities. This is a medicine so powerful and effective as to make you absolutely immune from the dysentery if you take it.\x{2019} So saying, he took some phials, large and small, out of his medicine chest (a metal chest for a medical practitioner, as described above) / All the victims, wholly unsuspicious of the fiendish intention of the offender, whose perfect composure and plausible explanations as well as his armband of Tokyo Metropolitan Office having satisfied them to lay full credit in his words, formed a circle around him \x{2013} a circle of poor victims sixteen in all / Then the devil opened his mouth and said: \x{2018}This medicine will injure the enamel of your teeth, and so I will show you how you must swallow it. Do as I am going to show you. There are two kinds of medicine. Take the second about a minute after you take the first. Be sure to drink it within a minute, or you will get a bad effect.\x{2019} / After such explanations he poured into the victims\x{2019} cups some liquid medicine, transparent and otherwise, out of the small phials with a fountain-pen filler, a filler for each / Then he took a cup of his own in his hand, and, saying, \x{2018}This is how to drink,\x{2019} gulped its contents by dripping them drop by drop on to his tongue, which he had put out in the form of a shovel / So the poor victims, without exception, gulped the fatal water following the devil\x{2019}s example / The liquid in question had a burning taste, and the victims got a feeling as if they had taken some strong whisky / After about a minute, the tricky villain again showed them how to drink the second medicine, and again the poor innocents followed his example, not suspecting in the least that they were actually killing themselves / The devil had the audacity to advise them to rinse out their mouths so as not to injure their teeth, and they went to have some water at the tap several metres off in the passage / Just about this time they felt themselves suddenly overwhelmed with torpor, and fell one by one in the office-room, passage, matted-room etc., sinking into a complete comatose state / As a natural conclusion, nobody knows \x{2013} but the devil and God \x{2013} what the offender did after his victims fell senseless / SOME RULES FOR CI AGENTS TO ACT UPON: (1) Send warnings without delay to banks, post offices, and other places where large sums of money are handled, not to fall easy victims to some similar attempts. Institute at the same time a close investigation as to whether such attempts have been made in the past. (2) Make an immediate inquiry as to where the offender\x{2019}s name-card was printed, carrying your search into every corner of the Metropolis where some printer of name-cards may have printed some such items. (3) Make an immediate inquiry as to whether there lives some suspicious person at all similar to the description given of the fiendish offender, within the area you are assigned to cover. Pay a special attention to bank employees, disinfecting officials and their assistants, health officials and their men, physicians, druggists, and those who have some record of having been employed in the sanitary work of the Occupation authorities. (4) Examine any person, at all suspicious, more strictly than ever, paying a special attention to his name-card, phials, and medicine chest, made of metal. (5) Try and catch some clue concerning those who may have some business or other connections with the bank in question. (6) Ransack your memory and memoranda for some person with criminal records (especially fraud), at all resembling the devilish offender described, either in his features or in his peculiar way of committing crimes. (7) Carry out a secret surveillance over the daily habits and characteristic features of the Metropolitan health officials and such others as are engaged in sanitary works in the Metropolis / Insert: Memorandum from Director of Criminal Department, Metropolitan Police Board, to Chiefs of All Police Stations, Re: Instructions regarding Case of Killing Members of the Teikoku Bank: At <<approximately 15.30|3b>> today, the sixteen members of the Shiinamachi branch of the Teikoku Bank, located within the jurisdiction of the Mejiro Police Station, were asked by a man who called himself a member of the Sanitary Section of the Tokyo Metropolitan Office to swallow a liquid poison he brought which he said was a preventative against dysentery to be taken by them according to an order issued by the Occupation Forces, that ten of the victims were killed on the spot and two at the hospital, and the other four are being given medical aid but their fate is still to be seen.

manager of the Nakai branch of the Mitsubishi Bank / Case occurred at <<approximately 15.20|3:1>> on 19 January this year at the Nakai branch of the Mitsubishi Bank at 4-ch\x{14d}me Shimo-ochiai, Shinjuku-ku / According to the statement by Ogawa, a man arrived at the bank as business was closing and presented the name-card: \x{2018}Dr Yamaguchi Jiro, medical technician attached to the Anti-Epidemic section of the Welfare Ministry\x{2019} / The visitor told Ogawa that he had been sent by a Lieutenant Porter or Parker to disinfect the entire branch because money had been deposited that day by a man named \x{14c}tani from the Kinuhara Industrial Company of 4-ch\x{14d}me Shimo-ochiai / The visitor said that a mass dysentery outbreak had occurred in the employee apartments of the Kinuhara Industrial Company that day (19 January) with ten patients reported so far / Ogawa asked the man if he knew the full name of this \x{14c}tani but the man did not answer clearly / Ogawa investigated the records of the branch and found a deposit by a man named \x{14c}tani of the Kinuhara Industrial Company / However the deposit had been a postal order for \x{a5}65 and not cash / Ogawa presented the postal order to the visitor / The visitor then took out a bottle of transparent, colourless liquid from his briefcase / The man sprinkled a small amount of the liquid over the postal order and the ledger / Ogawa asked the man if he wished to take the postal order away with him but again the man did not answer clearly / Ogawa then asked him if it was possible to be infected with typhoid from simply touching the postal order and again the man was unsure / Ogawa said, \x{2018}Surely we would have had to lick the postal order, or the customer\x{2019}s hand to become infected?\x{2019} / The man agreed and stood up ready to leave / However, the man, looking around the room at the closed vaults, then asked whether or not the bank had already sent the day\x{2019}s cash deposits to the Central Bank / The man used the same technical terms used by the bank employees to talk about cash deposits and banking practices and procedures / However, before Ogawa could answer, the man bowed deeply, thanked the manager and left the branch / Ogawa described the man as being in his fifties, of medium build, round faced with a scar on his left cheek and close-cropped hair / He was wearing a uniform with an armband on which were painted the words: \x{2018}Tokyo Epidemic Prevention Centre\x{2019} / Second case reported to Special Investigation HQ today by a Mr Kawasumi, acting manager of the Ebara branch of the Yasuda Bank / Kawasumi reported that on 14 October 1947, a man entered the Ebara branch of the Yasuda Bank at <<722|3:1>> Hiratsuka-machi 3-ch\x{14d}me, Shinagawa-ku and announced himself as a Dr Matsui Shigeru, an official from the Epidemic Prevention Unit of the Welfare Ministry / The man said, / came here with Lieutenant Parker in a jeep because a new typhus case has happened in the houses near the market located behind your bank and that because some of the residents of these houses are customers of the bank it is necessary for me to immunize the employees of the bank against infection.\x{2019} / However, Kawasumi was suspicious of this Dr Matsui and so he sent an employee to the local Hiratsuka k\x{14d}ban to ask the officer on duty whether there had been an outbreak of typhoid in the neighbourhood / The officer was called Iida Ryuzo / Officer Iida said he hadn\x{2019}t heard of any outbreak but that he would check and then come to the bank / Meanwhile the manager agreed to cooperate with the disinfection / This Dr Matsui said he had to collect his equipment from his jeep and went outside / On his return, the man distributed some kind of medicine to all twenty-three employees of the bank / He told the employees it was a preventative medicine for typhus control and directed them to drink it / The medicine was given in two doses / The first dose was described as being the colour of diluted soy sauce with an acrid aftertaste / The second medicine was tasteless and is believed to have been water / Each of the employees drank the doses down but suffered no ill effects / At this point Officer Iida arrived and spoke directly with this Dr Matsui / Officer Iida told this man Matsui that he had been out to the neighbourhood to check and found there had been no outbreak of typhoid / This Dr Matsui told Officer Iida that he must have checked the wrong neighbourhood and suggested that he should go back out to check the correct area / Officer Iida then left the bank to check the area again / But the man did not wait for the officer to return and left a few minutes later / However, Kawasumi has given Special Investigation HQ the name-card the man left behind / \x{2018}Matsui Shigeru; medical doctor; Gikan; Yob\x{14d} Division; Health & Welfare Ministry\x{2019} / A doctor named Matsui Shigeru has already been located in Sendai / Detective Tomitsuka (Bucho Keiji) of the First Investigative Division, has been sent to Sendai to interview Dr Matsui / Officer Iida has also been interviewed this afternoon by Special Investigation HQ and has provided a detailed description of the man / Iida described the man as being in his late forties to early fifties, about 160 centimetres tall, with a mark on his left cheek / Mr Kawasumi also stated that the man did not speak with the Tokyo dialect but with the accent of another region (which he is unable to name) / Because Officer Iida was unable to verify any reports of an outbreak of dysentery in the vicinity, he reported the case to his superior, Detective Meiga / Detective Meiga contacted the Ministry of Health & Welfare and was told that a Dr Matsui Shigeru was attached to their ministry but was posted in Sendai and did not fit the description of the man who visited the Ebara branch of the Yasuda Bank / Meiga and Iida wrote up a brief memo of the case and filed it along with the name-card / No further action was taken at this point / Iida seconded to Special Investigation HQ / Robbery Room detectives removed from ji-d\x{14d}ri teams to form Name-card Investigation Team under Chief Komatsu / <<19.30|5a:1>>: Emergency meeting ends / Officers told to report for second meeting of their ji-d\x{14d}ri

            "On the 13th of that week in October 1947, I was visited by my friend Mr Yamaguchi. He asked me to paint pictures of white chrysanthemums on twenty pieces of paper as gifts for guests at a wedding party which would be held that week. I agreed to his request and began to work hard on the paintings. The next day I was still hard at work painting the flowers when I was visited by Mr Watanabe. I remember he praised one of my other paintings and I promised to give him the painting in question. During Mr Watanabe\x{2019}s visit, my wife and daughter Hanako were also present. Mr Watanabe left <<around 4 p.m.|5>> and my other daughter, Shizuko, met him on her way home. I remember this now because Mr Watanabe\x{2019}s visit had interrupted my work on the wedding gifts and so I was still painting them the next day on the 15th, when Mr Yamaguchi came to collect them. So despite my confession, I had in fact been at home all day on 14 October 1947, the day of the so-called rehearsal at the Ebara branch of the Yasuda Bank.",

Then, at <<around 3:30 p.m.|2a>> \x{2013} the time of the actual crime \x{2013} I called at Mr Yamaguchi\x{2019}s house and I returned home at <<about 5:00 p.m.|2a>> with the fifty or sixty pieces of charcoal I had bought. I remember that my wife and my daughter were at home when I arrived back with this heavy bag. Also, an American soldier who was friendly with my daughter was also there and we played cards and spoke English well into the evening. That is what I did that day.",
