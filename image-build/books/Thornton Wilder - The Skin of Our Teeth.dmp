I thought I had turned in for the night, but just before I went below to claim the letter I looked out of the window at my now cherished view and saw Everything Covered with Snow. Well, the first snow of the year is one of my f\x{ea}tes, and I had always felt that Quebec, like Litchfield, and Oxford, and, I assume, Prague, mutely waits for snow.
