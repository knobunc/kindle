            'Saul Bellow, Herzog, 1964 One Some hours before dawn Henry Perowne, a neurosurgeon, wakes to find himself already in motion, pushing back the covers from a sitting position, and then rising to his feet. It\'s not clear to him when exactly he became conscious, nor does it seem relevant. He\'s never done such a thing before, but he isn\'t alarmed or even faintly surprised, for the movement is easy, and pleasurable in his limbs, and his back and legs feel unusually strong. He stands there, naked by the bed - he always sleeps naked - feeling his full height, aware of his wife\'s patient breathing and of the wintry bedroom air on his skin. That too is a pleasurable sensation. His bedside clock shows <<three forty|11>>. He has no idea what he\'s doing out of bed: he has no need to relieve himself, nor is he disturbed by a dream or some element of the day before, or even by the state of the world. It\'s as if, standing there in the darkness, he\'s materialised out of nothing, fully formed, unencumbered. He doesn\'t feel tired, despite the hour or his recent labours, nor is his conscience troubled by any recent case. In fact, he\'s alert and empty-headed and inexplicably elated. With no decision made, no motivation at all, he begins to move towards the nearest of the three bedroom windows and experiences such ease and lightness in his tread that he suspects at once he\'s dreaming or sleepwalking. If it is the Ian McEwan',

            'Perowne dictated monotonously, and long after his secretary went home he typed in his overheated box of an office on the hospital\'s third floor. What dragged him back was an unfamiliar lack of fluency. He prides himself on speed and a sleek, wry style. It never needs much forethought - typing and composing are one. Now he was stumbling. And though the professional jargon didn\'t desert him - it\'s second nature - his prose accumulated awkwardly. Individual words brought to mind unwieldy objects - bicycles, deckchairs, coat hangers - strewn across his path. He composed a sentence in his head, then lost it on the page, or typed himself into a grammatical cul-de-sac and had to sweat his way out. Whether this debility was the cause or the consequence of fatigue he didn\'t pause to consider. He was stubborn and he pushed himself to the end. At <<eight in the evening|9a>> he concluded the last in a series of e-mails, and stood up from his desk where he had been hunched since four. On his way out he looked in at his patients in the ICU. There were no problems, and Andrea was doing fine - she was sleeping and all her signs were good. Less than half an hour later he was back home, in his bath, and soon after, he too was asleep.',

It makes no sense at all. There\'s nothing to see. It\'s an entirely selfish impulse. Her alarm is due to go off at <<six thirty|5d>>, and once he\'s told her the story, she\'ll have no hope of going back to sleep. She\'ll hear it all anyway. She has a difficult day ahead. Now that the shutters are closed and he\'s in darkness again, he understands the extent of his turmoil. His thoughts have a reeling, tenuous quality - he can\'t hold an idea long enough to force sense out of it. He feels culpable somehow, but helpless too. These are contradictory terms, but not quite, and it\'s the degree of their overlap, their manner of expressing the same thing from different angles, which he needs to comprehend. Culpable in his helplessness. Helplessly culpable. He loses his way, and thinks again of the phone. By daylight, will it seem negligent not to have called the emergency services? Will it be obvious that there was nothing to be done, that there wasn\'t time? His crime was to stand in the safety of his bedroom, wrapped in a woollen dressing gown, without moving or making a sound, half dreaming as he watched',

Opportunities, health, prospects, accent, table manners these might lie within your power to shape. But what really determines the sort of person who\'s coming to live with you is which sperm finds which egg, how the cards in two packs are chosen, then how they are shuffled, halved and spliced at the moment of recombination. Cheerful or neurotic, kind or greedy, curious or dull, expansive or shy and anywhere in between; it can be quite an affront to parental self-regard, just how much of the work has already been done.

They discussed Iraq of course, America and power, European distrust, Islam - its suffering and self-pity, Israel and Palestine, dictators, democracy - and then the boys\' stuff: weapons of mass destruction, nuclear fuel rods, satellite photography, lasers, nanotechnology. At the kitchen table, this is the early-twenty-first-century menu, the specials of the day. On a recent Sunday evening Theo came up with an aphorism: the bigger you think, the crappier it looks. Asked to explain he said, \'When we go on about the big things, the political situation, global warming, world poverty, it all looks really terrible, with nothing getting better, nothing to look forward to.

A masterpiece of stealth, she also called it. But pace and manner were set by her. Early on, he sensed how easy it would be to scare her away. Her isolation was not confined to the neurology ward. It was always there, a wariness curbing spontaneity, lowering the excitement levels. She kept the lid on her youth. She could be unsettled by a sudden proposal of a picnic in the country, the unannounced arrival of an old friend, some free tickets for the theatre that night. She might end up saying yes to all three, but the first response was always a turning away, a hidden frown. She felt safer in those days with her law books, in the knowable long-closed matter of Donoghue versus Stevenson. Such distrust of life was bound to extend to himself if he made an unusual move. There were two women to consider, and to earn the trust of the daughter he would have to know and like everything about the mother. This ghost would have to be courted too.',

He takes the next three points without trouble, and on the last of these, clinched by a volley drop, he hears Jay swearing at himself as he walks to the back of the court. Now, the magical authority, and all the initiatives are Henry's. He has possession of the centre of the court and is sending his opponent running from front to back. Soon he's ahead at <<seven-six|5b>> and is certain he'll take the next two points. Even as he thinks this, he makes a careless cross-court shot which Strauss pounces on and, with a neat slice, drops into the corner. Perowne manages to resist the lure of self-hatred as he walks to the left-hand court to receive the serve. But as the ball floats off the front wall towards him, unwanted thoughts are shaking at his concentration. He sees the pathetic figure of Baxter in the rearview mirror. This is precisely the moment he should have stepped forwards for a backhand volley - he could reach it at a stretch - but he hesitates. The ball hits the nick - the join between the wall and the floor - and rolls insultingly over his foot. It's a lucky shot, and in his irritation he longs to say so. Seven all.

If she hadn\'t been working today, if there were no weekend crisis on the paper, if her mild-mannered editor wasn\'t such a bruiser when it comes to the small print of press freedom, she and Henry might be here together now. It\'s how they sometimes pass an hour or two on a winter\'s Saturday afternoon. The sexiness of a <<four o\'clock|6>> dusk.',

Just before dinner, he\'ll reheat it, and simmer the clams, monkfish, mussels and prawns in it for ten minutes. They\'ll eat the stew with brown bread, salad and red wine. After New York, there\'s the Kuwait-Iraq border, and military trucks moving in convoy along a desert road, and our lads kipping down by the tracks of their tanks, then eating bangers next morning from their mess-tins. He takes two bags of mache from the bottom of the fridge and empties them into a salad tosser. He runs the cold tap over the leaves. An officer, barely in his twenties, is standing outside his tent pointing with a stick at a map on an easel. Perowne isn\'t tempted to disable the mute - these items from the front have a cheerful, censored air that lowers his spirits. He spins the salad and tips it into a bowl. Oil, lemon, pepper and salt he\'ll throw on later. There\'s cheese and fruit for pudding. Theo and Daisy can set the table.',

            'The Russian pilots are shown walking into the hotel, and that\'s the last he\'ll ever see of them. He fetches a few bottles of tonic from the larder, checks on the ice-cube maker and the gin - three quarters of a litre is surely enough for one man - and turns off the heat under his stock. Upstairs, on the ground floor, he draws the curtains in the L-shaped living room, and turns on the lamps, and lights the gas in the mock-coal fires. These heavy curtains, closed by pulling on a cord weighted with a fat brass knob, have a way of cleanly eliminating the square and the wintry world beyond it. The tall-ceilinged room in creams and browns is silent, soothing, its only bright colour is in the blues and rubies of the rugs and an abstract slash of orange and yellow against green in a Howard Hodgkin on one of the chimney breasts. The three people in the world he, Henry Perowne, most loves, and who most love him, are about to come home. So what\'s wrong with him? Nothing, nothing at all. He\'s fine, everything is fine. He pauses at the foot of the stairs, wondering what it is he was intending to do next. He goes up to his study on the first floor, and remains standing as he looks at his screen to remind himself of the week ahead. There are four names on Monday\'s list, five for Tuesday\'s. The old astronomer, Viola, will be first, at <<eight thirty|5b>>. Jay is right, she may not make it. All the names conjure a history he knows well from the past weeks or months. In each case',

Without turning, he\'s aware of the nurse going towards her. Perowne looks at his watch. <<Three thirty|9j>>. He knows he should be going, that he must not fall asleep in the chair. But now he\'s here, almost by accident, he has to stay a while, and he won\'t doze off because he\'s feeling too many things, he\'s alive to too many contradictory impulses. His thoughts have assumed a sinuous, snaking quality, driven by the same undulating power that\'s making the space in the long room ripple, as well as the floor beneath his chair. Feelings have become in this respect like light itself - wavelike, as they used to say in his physics class. He needs to stay here and, in his usual manner, break them down into their components, the quanta, and find all the distal and proximal causes; only then will he know what to do, what\'s right.

Who knows what spooky uncontrollable emotions were driving him.\' He then describes to her in detail the encounter in University Street, and includes everything he thinks might be relevant - the policeman waving him on, the demonstrators in Gower Street and the funereal drumbeats, his own competitive instincts before the confrontation. While he\'s talking, her hand is resting on his cheek. They could turn on the lights, but it comforts them, this intimate trusting darkness, the sexless, childlike huddling and talking into the night. Daisy and Theo used to do it, on the top floor with their sleepover friends - little voices still murmuring at <<3.00 a.m.|2a>>, faltering against sleep and bravely picking up again. When Henry was ten, a cousin a year younger came to stay for a month while her mother was in hospital. Since he had a double bed in his room and there was nowhere else, his mother put her in with him. Henry and his cousin ignored each other during the day - Mona was plump, with thick',

He lies on his back, patiently waiting, head turned towards the bar of white light on the wall, aware of an inconvenient pressure growing in his bladder. After several minutes he takes one of the dressing gowns from the floor and goes into the bathroom. The marble floor is icy underfoot, the open curtains on the tall north-facing windows show a few stars in a sky of broken, orange-tinted cloud. It\'s <<five fifteen|9j>>, and already there\'s a rustle of traffic on the Euston Road. When he\'s relieved himself, he bends over the washbasin to drink deeply from the cold-water tap. Back in the bedroom he hears a distant rumble of an airplane, the first of the morning rush hour into Heathrow, he supposes and, drawn by the sound, goes to the window he stood at before and opens the shutters. He prefers to stand here a few minutes looking out than to lie still in bed, forcing sleep. Quietly he raises the window. The air is warmer than last time, but still he shivers. The light is softer too, the features of the square, especially the branches of the plane trees in the garden, are not so etched, and seem to merge with each other. What can it be about low temperatures that sharpens the edges of objects?',

He closes the shutters on them, then goes towards the bed and lets the dressing gown fall to his feet as he gets in. Rosalind lies facing away from him with her knees crooked. He closes his eyes. This time there\'ll be no trouble falling towards oblivion, there\'s nothing can stop him now. Sleep\'s no longer a concept, it\'s a material thing, an ancient means of transport, a softly moving belt, conveying him into Sunday. He fits himself around her, her silk pyjamas, her scent, her warmth, her beloved form, and draws closer to her. Blindly, he kisses her nape. There\'s always this, is one of his remaining thoughts. And then: there\'s only this. And at last, faintly, falling: this day\'s over.',
