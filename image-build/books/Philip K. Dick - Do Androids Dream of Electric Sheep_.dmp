A meager colonization program had been underway before the war, but now that the sun had ceased to shine on Earth, the colonization entered an entirely new phase. In connection with this a weapon of war, the Synthetic Freedom Fighter, had been modified; able to function on an alien world, the humanoid robot\x{2014}strictly speaking, the organic android\x{2014}had become the mobile donkey engine of the colonization program.
