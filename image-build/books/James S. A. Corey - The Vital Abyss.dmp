Blood ran down my cheeks and dampened the collar of my jumpsuit. Shouting voices came at me from a great distance that turned out to be about four meters. Alberto and two of Fong\x{2019}s men wrestled Quintana, pushing him back and away from me. Half a dozen other prisoners ran toward us, to help keep the peace or to watch it being broken. Quintana\x{2019}s voice buzzed with rage so badly I couldn\x{2019}t understand what he was calling me or threatening me with. I rose to my knees and looked up.
