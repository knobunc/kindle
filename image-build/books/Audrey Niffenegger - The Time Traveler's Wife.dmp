I have never been in the Newberry Library before, and now that I\x{2019}ve gotten past the dark, foreboding entrance I am excited. I have a sort of Christmas-morning sense of the library as a big box full of beautiful books. The elevator is dimly lit, almost silent. I stop on the third floor and fill out an application for a Reader\x{2019}s Card, then I go upstairs to Special Collections. My boot heels rap the wooden floor. The room is quiet and crowded, full of solid, heavy tables piled with books and surrounded by readers. Chicago autumn morning light shines through the tall windows. I approach the desk and collect a stack of call slips. I\x{2019}m writing a paper for an art history class. My research topic is the Kelmscott Press Chaucer. I look up the book itself and fill out a call slip for it. But I also want to read about papermaking at Kelmscott. The catalog is confusing. I go back to the desk to ask for help. As I explain to the woman what I am trying to find, she glances over my shoulder at someone passing behind me. \x{201c}Perhaps Mr. DeTamble can help you,\x{201d} she says. I turn, prepared to start explaining again, and find myself face to face with Henry.",

            "HENRY: At <<6:00 p.m.|2a>> I race home from work and attempt to make myself attractive. Home these days is a tiny but insanely expensive studio apartment on North Dearborn; I am constantly banging parts of myself on inconvenient walls, countertops and furniture. Step One: unlock seventeen locks on apartment door, fling myself into the living room-which-is-also-my-bedroom and begin stripping off clothing. Step Two: shower and shave. Step Three: stare hopelessly into the depths of my closet, gradually becoming aware that nothing is exactly clean. I discover one white shirt still in its dry cleaning bag. I decide to wear the black suit, wing tips, and pale blue tie. Step Four: don all of this and realize I look like an FBI agent. Step Five: look around and realize that the apartment is a mess. I resolve to avoid bringing Clare to my apartment tonight even if such a thing is possible. Step Six: look in full-length bathroom mirror and behold angular, wild-eyed 6\x{2019}1\x{201d} ten-year-old Egon Schiele look-alike in clean shirt and funeral director suit. I wonder what sorts of outfits this woman has seen me wearing, since I am obviously not arriving from my future into her past wearing clothes of my own. She said she was a little girl? A plethora of unanswerables runs through my head. I stop and breathe for a minute. Okay. I grab my wallet and my keys, and away I go: lock the thirty-seven locks, descend in the cranky little elevator, buy roses for Clare in the shop in the lobby, walk two blocks to the restaurant in record time but still five minutes late. Clare is already seated in a booth and she looks relieved when she sees me. She waves at me like she\x{2019}s in a parade.",

My car is a very cute 1990 white Honda Civic, and I love it, but Henry really hates riding in cars, especially small cars. He\x{2019}s a horrible passenger, holding onto the armrest and braking the whole time we\x{2019}re in transit. He would probably be less afraid if he could be the driver, but for obvious reasons Henry doesn\x{2019}t have a driver\x{2019}s license. So we are sailing along the Indiana Toll Road on this fine winter day; I\x{2019}m calm and looking forward to seeing my family and Henry is a basket case. It doesn\x{2019}t help that he didn\x{2019}t run this morning; I\x{2019}ve noticed that Henry needs an incredible amount of physical activity all the time in order to be happy. It\x{2019}s like hanging out with a greyhound. It\x{2019}s different being with Henry in real time. When I was growing up Henry came and went, and our encounters were concentrated and dramatic and unsettling. Henry had a lot of stuff he wasn\x{2019}t going to tell me, and most of the time he wouldn\x{2019}t let me get anywhere near him, so I always had this intense, unsatisfied feeling. When I finally found him in the present, I thought it would be like that. But in fact it\x{2019}s so much better, in many ways. First and foremost, instead of refusing to touch me at all, Henry is constantly touching me, kissing me, making love to me. I feel as though I have become a different person, one who is bathed in a warm pool of desire. And he tells me things! Anything I ask him about himself, his life, his family\x{2014}he tells me, with names, places, dates. Things that seemed utterly mysterious to me as a child are revealed as perfectly logical. But the best thing of all is that I see him for long stretches of time\x{2014}hours, days. I know where to find him. He goes to work, he comes home. Sometimes I open my address book just to look at the entry: Henry DeTamble, 714 Dearborn, 11e, Chicago, IL 60610, 312-431-8313. A last name, an address, a phone number. I can call him on the phone. It\x{2019}s a miracle. I feel like Dorothy, when her house crash-landed in Oz and the world turned from black and white to color. We\x{2019}re not in Kansas anymore.",

She leaves us standing in the hall and retreats to the kitchen. I turn, take off my coat and hang it in the hall closet. When I turn back to Henry he is waving at someone. I peer around him and see Nell sticking her broad, snub-nosed face out of the dining room door, grinning, and I run down the hall and give her a big sloppy kiss and she chuckles at me and says, \x{201c}Pretty man, monkey girl,\x{201d} and ducks back into the other room before Henry can reach us.",

I pull up in front of the Dew Drop Inn, a tiny, tacky motel on Silver Lake. Henry is asleep. I get out, check in, get the desk guy to help me walk Henry into our room and dump him on the bed. The guy brings in the luggage, eyeballs my wedding dress and Henry\x{2019}s inert state, and smirks at me. I tip him. He leaves. I remove Henry\x{2019}s shoes, loosen his tie. I take off my dress and lay it over the armchair.",

Gomez is showing Sharon how to rumba in the living room. Everyone seems to be having a good time, but Henry is nowhere in sight. I haven\x{2019}t seen him for at least forty-five minutes, and I feel a strong urge to find him, make sure he\x{2019}s okay, make sure he\x{2019}s here. \x{201c}Excuse me,\x{201d} I tell Kendrick, who looks like he wants to continue the conversation. \x{201c}Another time.

HENRY: It has become very warm in the house, and I need to cool off, so I am sitting on the enclosed front porch. I can hear people talking in the living room. The snow is falling thick and fast now, covering all the cars and bushes, softening their hard lines and deadening the sound of traffic. It\x{2019}s a beautiful night. I open the door between the porch and the living room.",

CLARE: Henry isn\x{2019}t in the living room, which is filled with a small but determined group of people trying to dance, in a variety of unlikely ways, to the Squirrel Nut Zippers. Charisse and Matt are doing something that looks like the cha-cha, and Roberto is dancing with considerable flair with Kimy, who moves delicately but steadfastly in a kind of fox trot. Gomez has abandoned Sharon for Catherine, who whoops as he spins her and laughs when he stops dancing to light a cigarette.",
