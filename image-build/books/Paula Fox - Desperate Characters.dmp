She lay there for a moment, thinking of the cat, how surprised she\x{2019}d been, seeing it again, when she and Otto had come home. It had looked so ordinary, just another city stray. What had she expected? That it would have been deranged by its attack on her? That it planned to smash and cuff its way into their house and eat them both up? She got up and went into the bathroom. The swelling, which she had managed to reduce earlier by the long soak in hot water, had returned. She filled the basin and immersed her hand. Then, looking at her face in the mirror over the sink\x{2014}she didn\x{2019}t want to see what she was doing\x{2014}she began to press the fingers of her other hand against the swollen mass of skin.

Then the village people had called in the mosquito-control people. Now there were few birds, and poison ivy and Virginia creeper flourished in the acid earth. The elm blight had destroyed those trees not already harmed by frequent droughts. But in the center of the village, three copper beeches survived, black in the <<noonday|13>> sun, purple in the twilight. Even the villagers prized them, not so rapturously as the summer people, perhaps. One manor house remained unoccupied and unsold. It sat on a small rise, a menacing, ugly house, a barrow, deposited and deserted by some 1920\x{2019}s millionaire and left there to testify to the power of money to create a permanent and quarrelsome unloveliness.",
