            "For having lived in Westminster \x{2014} how many years now? over twenty \x{2014} one feels even in the midst of the traffic, or
waking at night, Clarissa was positive, a particular hush, or solemnity; an indescribable pause; a suspense (but that
might be her heart, affected, they said, by influenza) before Big Ben strikes. There! Out it boomed. First a warning,
musical; then the hour, irrevocable. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. Such fools we are, she thought, crossing
Victoria Street. For Heaven only knows why one loves it so, how one sees it so, making it up, building it <<round one|9f>>,
tumbling it, creating it every moment afresh; but the veriest frumps, the most dejected of miseries sitting on
doorsteps (drink their downfall) do the same; can\x{2019}t be dealt with, she felt positive, by Acts of Parliament for that
very reason: they love life. In people\x{2019}s eyes, in the swing, tramp, and trudge; in the bellow and the uproar; the
carriages, motor cars, omnibuses, vans, sandwich men shuffling and swinging; brass bands; barrel organs; in the triumph
and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved; life; London; this moment of

roses; there were irises. Ah yes \x{2014} so she breathed in the earthy garden sweet smell as she stood talking to Miss Pym
who owed her help, and thought her kind, for kind she had been years ago; very kind, but she looked older, this year,
turning her head from side to side among the irises and roses and nodding tufts of lilac with her eyes half closed,
snuffing in, after the street uproar, the delicious scent, the exquisite coolness. And then, opening her eyes, how
fresh like frilled linen clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses looked; and dark and prim the red
carnations, holding their heads up; and all the sweet peas spreading in their bowls, tinged violet, snow white, pale \x{2014}

to it, dark descends, pours over the outlines of houses and towers; bleak hillsides soften and fall in. But though they
are gone, the night is full of them; robbed of colour, blank of windows, they exist more ponderously, give out what the
frank daylight fails to transmit \x{2014} the trouble and suspense of things conglomerated there in the darkness; huddled
together in the darkness; reft of the relief which dawn brings when, washing the walls white and grey, spotting each
window-pane, lifting the mist from the fields, showing the red-brown cows peacefully grazing, all is once more decked
out to the eye; exists again. I am alone; I am alone! she cried, by the fountain in Regent\x{2019}s Park (staring at the
Indian and his cross), as perhaps at <<midnight|13>>, when all boundaries are lost, the country reverts to its ancient shape,
as the Romans saw it, lying cloudy, when they landed, and the hills had no names and rivers wound they knew not where \x{2014}
such was her darkness; when suddenly, as if a shelf were shot forth and she stood on it, she said how she was his wife,
married years ago in Milan, his wife, and would never, never tell that he was mad! Turning, the shelf fell; down, down
she dropped. For he was gone, she thought \x{2014} gone, as he threatened, to kill himself \x{2014} to throw himself under a cart!

            "Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went upstairs, paused at the window, came to the bathroom.
There was the green linoleum and a tap dripping. There was an emptiness about the heart of life; an attic room. Women
must put off their rich apparel. At <<midday|13>> they must disrobe. She pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow
hat on the bed. The sheets were clean, tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side. Narrower and narrower
would her bed be. The candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in Baron Marbot\x{2019}s Memoirs. She had read late at
night of the retreat from Moscow. For the House sat so long that Richard insisted, after her illness, that she must
sleep undisturbed. And really she preferred to read of the retreat from Moscow. He knew it. So the room was an attic;
the bed narrow; and lying there reading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity preserved through
childbirth which clung to her like a sheet. Lovely in girlhood, suddenly there came a moment \x{2014} for example on the river
beneath the woods at Clieveden \x{2014} when, through some contraction of this cold spirit, she had failed him. And then at
Constantinople, and again and again. She could see what she lacked. It was not beauty; it was not mind. It was
something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and
woman, or of women together. For THAT she could dimly perceive. She resented it, had a scruple picked up Heaven knows
where, or, as she felt, sent by Nature (who is invariably wise); yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the
charm of a woman, not a girl, of a woman confessing, as to her they often did, some scrape, some folly. And whether it
was pity, or their beauty, or that she was older, or some accident \x{2014} like a faint scent, or a violin next door (so
strange is the power of sounds at certain moments), she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt. Only for a moment; but
it was enough. It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one
yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen
with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an
extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match
burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over \x{2014} the
moment. Against such moments (with women too) there contrasted (as she laid her hat down) the bed and Baron Marbot and
the candle half-burnt. Lying awake, the floor creaked; the lit house was suddenly darkened, and if she raised her head
she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by Richard, who slipped upstairs in his
socks and then, as often as not, dropped his hot-water bottle and swore! How she laughed!",

right, her voice, being the voice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality. Some grief for the past
holds it back; some concern for the present. It is <<half-past eleven|10>>, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret\x{2019}s glides
into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound, like something alive which wants to
confide itself, to disperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest \x{2014} like Clarissa herself, thought Peter
Walsh, coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white. It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with a deep
emotion, and an extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling, recollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years
ago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with
honey, laden with the moment. But what room? What moment? And why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was
striking? Then, as the sound of St. Margaret\x{2019}s languished, he thought, She has been ill, and the sound expressed
languor and suffering. It was her heart, he remembered; and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death
that surprised in the midst of life, Clarissa falling where she stood, in her drawing-room. No! No! he cried. She is
not dead! I am not old, he cried, and marched up Whitehall, as if there rolled down to him, vigorous, unending, his

stands preaching; shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and
parliaments; offers help, but desires power; smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows
her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own. This lady too

lit her husband\x{2019}s eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped, squeezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped
through; so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this pressure on the top of
the head (which might well be imputed to the professional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life,

            "Buses swooped, settled, were off \x{2014} garish caravans, glistening with red and yellow varnish. But which should she get
on to? She had no preferences. Of course, she would not push her way. She inclined to be passive. It was expression she
needed, but her eyes were fine, Chinese, oriental, and, as her mother said, with such nice shoulders and holding
herself so straight, she was always charming to look at; and lately, in the evening especially, when she was
interested, for she never seemed excited, she looked almost beautiful, very stately, very serene. What could she be
thinking? Every man fell in love with her, and she was really awfully bored. For it was beginning. Her mother could see
that \x{2014} the compliments were beginning. That she did not care more about it \x{2014} for instance for her clothes \x{2014} sometimes
worried Clarissa, but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies and guinea pigs about having distemper, and it gave
her a charm. And now there was this odd friendship with Miss Kilman. Well, thought Clarissa <<about three o\x{2019}clock in the
morning|6>>, reading Baron Marbot for she could not sleep, it proves she has a heart.",

            "It seemed to her as she drank the sweet stuff that she was opening long windows, stepping out into some garden. But
where? The clock was striking \x{2014} <<one|9k:0>>, <<two|9k:0>>, <<three|9k:0>>: how sensible the sound was; compared with all this thumping and
whispering; like Septimus himself. She was falling asleep. But the clock went on striking, four, five, six and Mrs.
Filmer waving her apron (they wouldn\x{2019}t bring the body in here, would they?) seemed part of that garden; or a flag. She
had once seen a flag slowly rippling out from a mast when she stayed with her aunt at Venice. Men killed in battle were
thus saluted, and Septimus had been through the War. Of her memories, most were happy.",

sent somebody to the post. It was, as people say, very like her. She was upset by his visit. She had felt a great deal;
had for a moment, when she kissed his hand, regretted, envied him even, remembered possibly (for he saw her look it)
something he had said \x{2014} how they would change the world if she married him perhaps; whereas, it was this; it was middle
age; it was mediocrity; then forced herself with her indomitable vitality to put all that aside, there being in her a
thread of life which for toughness, endurance, power to overcome obstacles, and carry her triumphantly through he had
never known the like of. Yes; but there would come a reaction directly he left the room. She would be frightfully sorry
for him; she would think what in the world she could do to give him pleasure (short always of the one thing) and he
could see her with the tears running down her cheeks going to her writing-table and dashing off that one line which he
was to find greeting him. .\x{a0}.\x{a0}. \x{201c}Heavenly to see you!\x{201d} And she meant it.",

remembered, had been among the cauliflowers in the moonlight, the leaves \x{201c}like rough bronze\x{201d} she had said, with her
literary turn; and she had picked a rose. She had marched him up and down that awful night, after the scene by the
