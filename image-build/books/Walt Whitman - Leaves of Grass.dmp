            "Surprisingly, during these same crucial fifteen years, Whitman saw in print only twenty-one of his poems and twenty-two short stories. His first poem, \x{201c}Young Grimes,\x{201d} was published in the Long Island Democrat on January 1, 1840\x{2014}clearly imitative, since it followed the model of a popular poem entitled \x{201c}Old Grimes,\x{201d} by Albert G. Greene. \x{201c}Young Grimes\x{201d} is as conventional as \x{201c}Old Grimes\x{201d} in its rhyme, meter, religious expression, and sentimentality; there seems to be no signs of America\x{2019}s great outlaw poet in its didactic lines. Even as he progressed through the decade, Whitman did not make substantial improvements to the formulaic poetry he contributed to the penny dailies. For example, \x{201c}The Mississippi at <<Midnight|13>>,\x{201d} originally published in the New Orleans Daily Crescent on March 6, 1848, bears much more similarity to Whitman\x{2019}s earliest verse than to the twelve poems of the 1855 Leaves of Grass: Its forced rhyme, predictable meter, and hyper-dramatic tone suggest that Whitman had not yet found his poetic voice.",

            "Whitman\x{2019}s friends and critics also did their share to create a legend of the writer and his explosive first book. In the first biographical study of Whitman, John Burroughs claimed that certain individuals throughout history \x{201c}mark and make new eras, plant the standard again ahead, and in one man personify vast races or sweeping revolutions. I consider Walt Whitman such an individual\x{201d} (Burroughs, \x{201c}Preface\x{201d} to Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person). Others insisted that Leaves of Grass was the product of the \x{201c}cosmic consciousness\x{201d} Whitman had acquired <<around 1850|18:0>> (Bucke, Walt Whitman, p. 178) or a spiritual \x{201c}illumination\x{201d} of the highest order (Binns, A Life of Walt Whitman, pp. 69-70).",

            "Of the three types of New Yorkers, \x{201c}commuters give the city its tidal restlessness; natives give it solidity and continuity; but the settlers give it passion,\x{201d} writes E. B. White in his essay \x{201c}Here Is New York\x{201d} (reprinted in Lopate, Writing New York: A Literary Anthology, pp. 696-697). Whitman belonged to the third category. Though born on a Long Island farm, he discovered at an early age that the city fed his soul. When his parents moved back to the country in 1833, the fourteen-year-old boy decided to stay on alone in Brooklyn and work in the printing industry. An employer helped him acquire a card for a circulating library; on his own, he started attending the theater and participating in a debating society. Looking for work during difficult times, Whitman left New York during his late teens and early twenties to teach school on Long Island. He disliked the job and eagerly returned to the world of city journalism in 1841. Until <<1848|9n:1>> Whitman bounced from one Brooklyn or Manhattan publisher or newspaper to the next; he reported on local news, reviewed concerts and operas, and wrote his own fledgling poems and short stories. When he was fired from his editorship of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle in 1848, Whitman made an impetuous decision to try working in New Orleans. Not surprisingly, the now-confirmed New Yorker was back within three months. Later that year, Whitman secured his position in his beloved Brooklyn by buying a Myrtle Avenue lot and building a home on the site (with a printing office and bookstore on the first floor). Though he sold this property in 1852, he continued to call Brooklyn (and occasionally, Manhattan) home until 186X, when he left to search for his brother George, who was wounded at the battle of Fredericksburg, and settled in Washington, D.C.",

            "\x{201c}An American Bard at last!\x{201d} Whitman proclaimed of himself in a self-review published in 1855. Whitman wrote two such reviews that year to offer explanations of his unusual project and stir up interest in Leaves of Grass. According to Florence Rome Garrett, granddaughter of the printers who helped Whitman produce the First Edition, \x{201c}practically none sold.\x{201d} The public\x{2019}s ambivalence may have been fostered in part by the lack of an author\x{2019}s name-not that placing \x{201c}Walt Whitman\x{201d} on the cover would have done much to encourage sales. At best, fellow Brooklynites might have recognized Whitman as a writer and sometime editor of the city\x{2019}s more liberal newspapers; others might have remembered that he and his father had both worked as carpenters, and that while Whitman Senior\x{2019}s weakness may have been alcohol, Walt\x{2019}s was laziness. The name \x{201c}Walt Whitman\x{201d} had rarely been associated with poetry before <<1855|9c:0>>. The \x{201c}Additional Poems\x{201d} section of this Barnes and Noble Classics edition contains the only poetic efforts Whitman is known to have published before the arrival of Leaves of Grass in 1855. Even the single poem in the 1855 edition that had previously been published\x{2014}\x{201c}Resurgemus,\x{201d} published in the New York Tribune on June 21, 1850\x{2014}underwent radical transformation before becoming the eighth of the twelve poems. The interest in reading through the first edition of Leaves of Grass, then, derives not only from looking at it as a point of departure for later editions, but also from marveling at this remarkable, as-yet mysterious first effort.",

crossing savannas .... trailing in forests,

moccasin print,

Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the

In farmers\x{2019} barns oxen in the stable, their harvest labor done they 
rest standing, they are too tired, 
Afar on arctic ice the she-walrus lying drowsily while her cubs

The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail\x{2018}d, the farthest polar

White drift spooning ahead where the ship in the tempest 
dashes, 
On solid land what is done in cities as the bells strike <<midnight|11>> 
together, 
In primitive woods the sounds there also sounding, the howl of 
the wolf, the scream of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of 
the elk, 
In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead lake, in 
summer visible through the clear waters, the great trout 
swimming, 
In lower latitudes in warmer air in the Carolinas the large black 
buzzard floating slowly high beyond the tree tops, 
Below, the red cedar festoon\x{2019}d with tylandria, the pines and

Rude boats descending the big Pedee, climbing plants, parasites 
with color\x{2019}d flowers and berries enveloping huge trees, 
The waving drapery on the live-oak trailing long and low, 
noiselessly waved by the wind, 
The camp of Georgia wagoners just after dark, the supper-fires 
and the cooking and eating by whites and negroes, 
Thirty or forty great wagons, the mules, cattle, horses, feeding 
from troughs, 
The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore 
trees, the flames with the black smoke from the pitch-pine 
curling and rising; 
Southern fishermen fishing, the sounds and inlets of North 
Carolina\x{2019}s coast, the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery, the 
large sweep-seines, the windlasses on shore work\x{2019}d by horses, 
the clearing, curing, and packing houses; 
Deep in the forest in piney woods turpentine dropping from the 
incisions in the trees, there are the turpentine works, 
There are the negroes at work in good health, the ground in all 
directions is cover\x{2019}d with pine straw; 
In Tennessee and Kentucky slaves busy in the coalings, at the 
forge, by the furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking,

On rivers boatmen safely moor\x{2019}d at nightfall in their boats under 
shelter of high banks, 
Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or 
fiddle, others sit on the gunwale smoking and talking; 
Late in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the American mimic, 
singing in the Great Dismal Swamp, 
There are the greenish waters, the resinous odor, the plenteous 
moss, the cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree; 
Northward, young men of Mannahatta, the target company from 
an excursion returning home at evening, the musket-muzzles 
all bear bunches of flowers presented by women; 
Children at play, or on his father\x{2019}s lap a young boy fallen asleep, 
(how his lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!) 
The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the 
Mississippi, he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around; 
California life, the miner, bearded, dress\x{2019}d in his rude costume, 
the stanch California friendship, the sweet air, the graves one 
in passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path; 
Down in Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving 
mules or oxen before rude carts, cotton bales piled on banks 
and wharves; 
Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul, with 
equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation or Pride; 
In arriere the peace-talk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the 
calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration, and indorsement,

toward the earth, 
The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and 
guttural exclamations, 
The setting out of the war-party, the long and stealthy march,

between each other, ascending high in the air, 
The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects, the fall traveler 
southward but returning northward early in the spring, 
The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows 
and shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the 
roadside, 
The city wharf, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New 
Orleans, San Francisco, 
The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan; 
Evening\x{2014}me in my room\x{2014}the setting sun, 
The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the 
swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre of 
the room, darting athwart, up and down, casting swift shadows 
in specks on the opposite wall where the shine is; 
The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of 
listeners, 
Males, females, immigrants, combinations, the copiousness, the 
individuality of the States, each for itself\x{2014}the money-makers, 
Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever, 
pulley, all certainties, 
The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity, 
In space the sporades, the scatter\x{2019}d islands, the stars\x{2014}on the firm 
earth, the lands, my lands, 
O lands! all so dear to me\x{2014}what you are, (whatever it is,) I 
putting it at random in these songs, become a part of that, 
whatever it is, 
Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, 
with the myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of 
Florida, 
Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio 
Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red 
River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring 
waters laughing and skipping and running, 
Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I 
with parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms 
and aquatic plants, 
Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing 
the crow with its bill, for amusement\x{2014}and I triumphantly 
twittering, 
The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh 
themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels outside 
move around with erect heads watching, and are from time to 
time reliev\x{2019}d by other sentinels\x{2014}and I feeding and taking 
turns with the rest, 
In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner\x{2019}d by 
hunters, rising desperately on his hind feet, and plunging 
with his fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives\x{2014}and I, 
plunging at the hunters, corner\x{2019}d and desperate, 
In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the 
countless workmen working in the shops, 
And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof\x{2014}and no less in 
myself than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself, 
Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands\x{2014}my body no 
more inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a 
thousand diverse contributions one identity, any more than 
my lands are inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY;

Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil\x{2014}
these me, 
These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me 
and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the 
union of them, to afford the like to you?

bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?",

The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the

Some of these pieces (like \x{201c}The Death and Burial of McDonald Clarke\x{201d} and \x{201c}Young Grimes\x{201d}) are directly imitative of popular poems of the time; others (\x{201c}The Mississippi at <<Midnight|13>>\x{201d}) are sensationalistic; still others (\x{201c}Our Future Lot,\x{201d} \x{201c}The Punishment of Pride\x{201d}) are didactic or overtly pious.
