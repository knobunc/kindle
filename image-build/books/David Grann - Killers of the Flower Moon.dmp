            "Though White encouraged efforts at rehabilitation, he had few illusions about many of the men contained in the Hot House. In 1929, Carl Panzram\x{2014}a repeat killer who\x{2019}d confessed to slaying twenty-one people and insisted, \x{201c}I have no conscience\x{201d}\x{2014}beat a member of the prison staff to death. He was sentenced to be hanged inside the penitentiary, and White, though opposed to capital punishment, was given the grim task of overseeing the execution, much as his father had done in Texas. On September 5, 1930, as the sun rose over the prison dome, White went to take Panzram from his cell to the newly built gallows. White made sure that his two boys weren\x{2019}t present when the noose was looped around the neck of Panzram, who shouted at his executioners to hurry up: \x{201c}I could hang a dozen men while you\x{2019}re fooling around.\x{201d} At <<6:03 a.m.|2a>>, the trap opened and Panzram swung to his death. It was the first time that White had helped to end a human life.",

As Grove worked on the book, White asked him, in a letter, if the narrative could be told in the third person. \x{201c}I would like to keep the big \x{2018}I\x{2019} out of it all I can, because I don\x{2019}t want it conveyed that I am the whole story,\x{201d} White explained. \x{201c}If it had not been for the good agents I had on the job we could never have made it.

Barred from returning to Oklahoma, he had initially gone to work on a sheep farm in New Mexico, earning \$75 a month. A reporter noted at the time, \x{201c}It will be a far cry from the days of affluence as the husband of an oil-rich Osage Indian woman.\x{201d} In 1966, hoping to return to Oklahoma, Ernest applied for a pardon. The records no longer exist, but his appeal, which went before a five-member review board in Oklahoma, was based at least partly on his cooperation with the bureau\x{2019}s investigation of the murders. (White had always credited Burkhart\x{2019}s confession as salvaging his case.) Despite intense protests from the Osage, the board ruled, <<three to two|10a:0>>, in favor of a pardon, which the governor then granted.

Her death, at <<twenty-one|9:1>>, was reported by her stepfather to be a suicide, and the case was quickly closed without even an autopsy. In 1992, Bolton\x{2019}s grandson Dennis McAuliffe Jr., an editor at the Washington Post, had investigated her death after discovering numerous contradictions and lies in the official account. As he detailed in a memoir, The Deaths of Sybil Bolton, published in 1994, much of her headright money was stolen, and the evidence suggested that she had been assassinated outdoors, on her lawn, with her sixteen-month-old baby\x{2014}McAuliffe\x{2019}s mother\x{2014}beside her.

            "Though the bureau estimated that there were twenty-four Osage murders, the real number was undoubtedly higher. The bureau closed its investigation after catching Hale and his henchmen. But at least some at the bureau knew that there were many more homicides that had been systematically covered up, evading their efforts of detection. An agent described, in a report, just one of the ways the killers did this: \x{201c}In connection with the mysterious deaths of a large number of Indians, the perpetrators of the crime would get an Indian intoxicated, have a doctor examine him and pronounce him intoxicated, following which a morphine hypodermic would be injected into the Indian, and after the doctor\x{2019}s departure the [killers] would inject an enormous amount of morphine under the armpit of the drunken Indian, which would result in his death. The doctor\x{2019}s certificate would subsequently read \x{2018}death from alcoholic poison.\x{2019}\x{2009}\x{201d} Other observers in Osage County noted that suspicious deaths were routinely, and falsely, attributed to \x{201c}consumption,\x{201d} \x{201c}wasting illness,\x{201d} or \x{201c}causes unknown.\x{201d} Scholars and investigators who have since looked into the murders believe that the Osage death toll was in the scores, if not the hundreds. To get a better sense of the decimation, McAuliffe looked at the Authentic Osage Indian Roll Book, which cites the deaths of many of the original allotted members of the tribe. He writes, \x{201c}Over the sixteen-year period from 1907 to 1923, 605 Osages died, averaging about 38 per year, an annual death rate of about 19 per 1,000. The national death rate now is about 8.5 per 1,000; in the 1920s, when counting methods were not so precise and the statistics were segregated into white and black racial categories, it averaged almost 12 per 1,000 for whites. By all rights, their higher standard of living should have brought the Osages a lower death rate than America\x{2019}s whites. Yet Osages were dying at more than one-and-a-half times the national rate\x{2014}and those numbers do not include Osages born <<after 1907|18:0>> and not listed on the roll.\x{201d}",

            "In one of the courtrooms, I met Marvin Stepson. An Osage man in his seventies with expressive gray eyebrows and a deliberate manner, he served as the chief trial court judge. He was the grandson of William Stepson, the steer-roping champion who had died, of suspected poisoning, in 1922. Authorities never prosecuted anyone for Stepson\x{2019}s murder, but they came to believe that Kelsie Morrison\x{2014}the man who had killed Anna Brown\x{2014}was responsible. By <<1922|9u>>, Morrison had divorced his Osage wife, and after Stepson\x{2019}s death he married Stepson\x{2019}s widow, Tillie, making himself the guardian of her two children. One of Morrison\x{2019}s associates told the bureau that Morrison had admitted to him that he had killed Stepson so that he could marry Tillie and get control of her invaluable estate.",
