But as always this scent eluded him. There might be an explanation, though he was not sure he should insist upon <<one|9c:1>>. Explanations did not, as far as he could tell, appear to be anything dogs either sought or even were entitled to.

It also quickly became evident\x{2014}horribly evident\x{2014}that no one in the city knew how to make coffee, as if there were some sort of stultified consensus, or even city ordinance, about never waking up. Bridge-rails were crowded with people watching the Scioto move sluggishly along. Saloons were full of silent drinkers, who drank very slowly till they collapsed, typically <<around eight in the evening|9h>>, which appeared to be closing time here. Day and night, thousands of petitioners milled at the gates of the Capitol seeking admission to the hanging. Souvenir stands enjoyed a remunerative trade in Blinky poker decks and board games, watch-fobs and cigar cutters, Blinky lockets and charms, commemorative china and wallpaper, Blinky toys including stuffed Blinky dolls which each came suspended by the neck from its own little toy gallows, and a great favorite, Blinky thumb-books, whose pages, showing full-color artist\x{2019}s renderings of the bloody murders in Ravenna, if flipped rapidly with your thumb appeared actually to be in motion. For a while, fascinated, Merle wandered the booths and pitches, setting up his camera and taking plate after plate of these Blinky Morgan keepsakes, displayed by the identical dozens, until somebody asked him why he wasn\x{2019}t trying to get in to photograph the execution. \x{201c}Why, you know,\x{201d} as if coming to his senses, \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t know.\x{201d} There were people at the Plain Dealer he could have wired, he supposed, cashed in a favor maybe.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.

Somehow he convinced himself that Webb possessed, if not exactly this power of instant justice, at least a secret life, in which, when night fell, he could put on, say, a trick hat and duster which would make him invisible, and take to the trails, grim and focused, to do the people\x{2019}s work, if not God\x{2019}s, the two forces according to Reverend Gatlin having the same voice.
