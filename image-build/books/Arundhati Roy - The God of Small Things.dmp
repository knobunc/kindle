With the last of her meager salary she had bought her daughter small presents wrapped in brown paper with colored paper hearts pasted on. A packet of cigarette sweets, a tin Phantom pencil box and Paul Bunyan\x{2014}a Junior Classics Illustrated comic. They were presents for a seven-year-old; Rahel was nearly eleven. It was as though Ammu believed that if she refused to acknowledge the passage of time, if she willed it to stand still in the lives of her twins, it would. As though sheer willpower was enough to suspend her children\x{2019}s childhoods until she could afford to have them living with her. Then they could take up from where they left off. Start again from <<seven|9c:0>>. Ammu told Rahel that she had bought Estha a comic too, but that she\x{2019}d kept it away for him until she got another job and could earn enough to rent a room for the three of them to stay together in. Then she\x{2019}d go to Calcutta and fetch Estha, and he could have his comic. That day was not far off, Ammu said. It could happen any day. Soon rent would be no problem. She said she had applied for a UN job and they would all live in The Hague with a Dutch ayah to look after them. Or on the other hand, Ammu said, she might stay on in India and do what she had been planning to do all along\x{2014}start a school.
