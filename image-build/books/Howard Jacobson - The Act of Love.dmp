On the grass by him lay a copy of Don Quixote, which he\x{2019}d presumably brought out so that he could read an extract from the story of Anselmo and Lothario aloud to me. While he slept I leafed through the novel to see if I could find their names, which proved not to be too difficult as many of the scenes in which they appeared were marked. Their adventure, if it could be so called, appeared to be another version of a plot in a Shakespeare play I\x{2019}d read at school \x{2013} one man inviting another to try the fidelity of the woman he loved, to tragic or near-tragic effect. According to the notes in my Arden Shakespeare, the \x{2018}fidelity test\x{2019} was a recurring motif in medieval Italian novellas, from which Cervantes too must have borrowed. I was too young to know anything for sure, but something told me that a fidelity test was more likely to be a literary device than a strategy much resorted to in real life. But it could only have cropped up frequently in literature if it answered to something that gave real men cause for concern: namely, the character of their wives when subjected to overwhelming temptation, for where, as Anselmo says to Lothario, is the merit in her being virtuous \x{2018}when nobody persuades her to be otherwise? What mighty matter  if she be reserved and cautious, who has no opportunity given her of going astray?\x{2019} A fear which once acted upon, it occurred to me, must surely stimulate a curiosity that is never to be assuaged. Why should Anselmo stop with a Lothario no matter how true this Lothario proves his wife to be? Indeed it would be illogical to do so. For is there not always to be encountered a Lothario more persuasive than the last? Will there not always be an \x{2018}opportunity\x{2019} for disloyalty greater than the one before?",

Opium was the aroma that suited me best. By <<ten|9:1>> I liked to have changed out of my business suit or whatever I was wearing that attached me to any purpose other than Marisa. In the days before she \x{2019}d taken ill in Florida, Marisa had bought me white pyjamas in a shop in Key West that sold only garments Hemingway might have worn. Hemingway\x{2019}s connection to white pyjamas was a mystery to us, but they were certainly more suited to the damp and heat than those I\x{2019}d brought with me. Marisa had laughed, I remember, on discovering I had brought any pyjamas to Florida. Why pack such things to go on honeymoon? \x{2018}So that you can laugh at me,\x{2019} I told her. There was no laughter associated with my white pyjamas now. These were sacrificial garments, the vestiture which signified the abnegation of my virility and independence. I was Marisa\x{2019}s to do with as she willed, and let my icy blood stain the garments I wore in her service until every corner of them was incarnadined.

I had met him a few times, either on the Antiquarian Booksellers Association\x{2019}s equivalent of a works outing, or at occasional recitals his quartet gave at the Wigmore Hall or other local venues which I felt we owed it to Dulcie to attend. I can\x{2019}t say I cared for him. He was at once a little too manly in the basso profundo, real-ale sense, and a little too womanly in the organisational way of things, ringing up unnecessarily to confirm dates and making lists of people \x{2019}s orders at restaurants \x{2013} particularly Chinese restaurants where he liked to order by number \x{2013} so as not to confuse the waiters, though his officiousness invariably confused them more. He had a long, Founding Father\x{2019}s face, marked by a sort of wolfish puritanism which he exaggerated by wearing what couldn\x{2019}t quite be called a beard, more a permanent <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>> shadow which was sculpted into points on his cheeks and below his ears. There was something about the way he moved his mouth I didn\x{2019}t like either, as though it pained his teeth to talk to you. And he couldn\x{2019}t stop touching his hair. Even on stage, when he wasn\x{2019}t playing, his hair appeared to plague him. I\x{2019}d have said it was a wig, except that no one would have paid good money for such a mildewed patch. But you don\x{2019}t have to like a man to feel for his predicament as a husband. He had been happily and conventionally married for too long. Nothing wrong with Dulcie. If you had to be happily and conventionally married for an eternity, Dulcie was probably the ideal person to be happily and conventionally married to. But the strain of keeping to the straight and narrow had begun to tell on him as it tells at last on everybody. It is too cruel, the way our society packages and sells the ideal of blissful conjugal normality. There is not enough room left for people to be peculiar. And by and large it is only by being peculiar that we achieve a measure of happiness. The majority of people who rang Marisa at their wits\x{2019} end were not at their wits\x{2019} end being peculiar. The peculiar are too busy being peculiar to have time to ring the Samaritans. It is not odd sex that drives people to the window ledge, it\x{2019}s no sex. We die of loneliness at the margins, not perversion. Perversion is exhilarating.

Outside the restaurants the chefs and waiters were in the street, smoking their last cigarettes before the night\x{2019}s business began. I exchanged vaguely criminal looks with them as I passed. We were in something underhand together.
