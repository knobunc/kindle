            "<<Around 1955|9e:1>>, the Taiwanese raintree (Koelreuteria elegans) was one of the exotic trees that the Florida parks authorities began planting in parks and along roadsides. The raintree is related to the balloon vine, but has a much smaller and flatter seed capsule. At some point after its arrival, soapberry bugs began eating the seeds of the raintree as well. And, as Scott Carroll of the University of California discovered in the 1990s, as a consequence, the raintree-dwelling bugs evolved, almost to the extent of becoming a separate species. Just forty years after the raintree began to become a common sight along Florida\x{2019}s streets, the bugs living on them lay more, but smaller, eggs, they develop faster, and they are attracted by the scent of raintrees, not balloon vine. But the most eye-catching difference is in their snouts, which, in the bugs on raintrees, are shorter: only about 6.5 to 7 mm long. Shorter than in their balloon vine\x{2013}dwelling ancestors (in fact, too short to be any good on a balloon vine pod), but long enough to reach the seeds inside the much smaller seed capsules of the raintree. What\x{2019}s more, Carroll showed that all these differences between the old and the new version of the soapberry bug are coded in their DNA.",

In Brisbane, another species of soapberry bug, Leptocoris tagalicus, lived mainly on the native woolly rambutan (Alectryon tomentosus), until the American balloon vine was introduced there, eventually becoming a nationwide pest <<around 1960|18:0>>. Roundabout that year, the Australian soapberry bugs, sufficiently provoked by the balloon vine\x{2019}s abundance, hopped onto it. Carroll measured the snout lengths of pinned Leptocoris in Australian natural history museums and discovered that before 1965, they all had short snouts, whereas after that year, longer-snouted individuals began to appear. These pre-1965 longsnouters presumably were the first ones to have colonized and adapted to balloon vine. Today, as Carroll discovered, the Leptocoris tagalicus bugs on balloon vine have snouts a tad longer than those on the woolly rambutan, long enough better to reach into balloon vine seeds.",

            "The Pinocchio-like growing and shrinking of soapberry bugs\x{2019} noses is a textbook example of herbivores evolving after they jump to a new, introduced food plant. Many of these cases come, of course, from agriculture, where such a shift onto a crop usually means the dreaded appearance of a new pest. In the Hudson River Valley of the US, for example, the native hawthorn fly spawned a new species that, over the past few hundred years, adapted to the apple after it was introduced there by settlers from Europe. The apple maggot fly (Rhagoletis pomonella) has by now become so different from the hawthorn fly that many consider it a separate species. And in Europe, Ostrinia scapulalis, a native moth burrowing in the stems of the native plant mugwort, also gave rise to a new species, Ostrinia nubilalis (the European corn borer) when maize was brought to Europe from America <<around 1500|18:0>>. Within that half millenium, the European corn borer has evolved lots of maize-specific adaptations, including one particularly delightful one. In late summer, the caterpillars chewing away inside the plant stalks go into so-called \x{201c}diapause,\x{201d} basically an extended holiday before the hard work of metamorphosis begins. But while Ostrinia scapulalis caterpillars install themselves somewhere in the middle of their plant\x{2019}s stalk, those of Ostrinia nubilalis first burrow down the corn stalk until close to ground level. Why? Think of the decades of natural selection caused by the late summer onslaught of the corn harvesting combine, and you\x{2019}ll probably know the answer!",

Presumably, it was a matter of racing to the front door as soon as the milkman\x{2019}s cart was spotted, not to give the tits a chance to steal any cream. Tits, not be outdone, would be hanging out near people\x{2019}s doorsteps at milk delivery time to still try to get there first. In any case, at some point in the early twentieth century, milk suppliers began closing their bottles with wax-board tops. This only gave momentary respite because in 1921, in Southampton, tits began prizing these off, or stripping away the cardboard layer by layer until the cap was thin enough to be pierced by the bird\x{2019}s sharp beak. Changing the cardboard caps to aluminum ones did not help for long either: by <<1930|9e:1>>, tits in ten different towns all over England had learned how to open the metal-topped bottles. When faced with a metal cap, they would hammer a hole in and then pull away the foil in strips. They might also pull off the entire cap and fly away, holding it in one claw and, in a secluded spot, peck at the cream sticking on the inside of the cap. Under the birds\x{2019} favorite tree, the cleaned and discarded caps would gradually pile up to a respectable refuse heap. But sometimes their greed was their downfall. More than once, say Robert Hinde and James Fisher, two English ornithologists who studied the behavior, blue tits would be found \x{201c}drowned head first in the bottle, presumably because they tried to drink too deep and lost their balance.\x{201d}",

She brought a boom box to her riverside site and, while the rural chiffchaffs were singing, gave them a taste of the noise level that their hard-shoulder brethren had to cope with by playing them loud traffic noise at close range. The results? An individual chiffchaff will immediately raise the pitch of his song if there is a lot of noise around: her rural chiffchaffs also increased their chiffs and chaffs by about 0.25 kilohertz as soon as she flipped the boom box switch.",

With cities growing and a rapidly dwindling availability of flat, low-lying land for nature and agriculture, why not bring these land-uses into the city, and onto those unused roofs? An added advantage of vegetation-clad constructions is that all that humid soil and foliage help a building stay cool. Air-conditioning costs go down and the urban heat island is mitigated as well. Moreover, the plants muffle noise and trap smog. In earthquake regions like Japan, a heavy rooftop park may even act as a counterweight and help to quake-proof the building. No wonder that in 2001, Tokyo passed an ordinance that says that new buildings need to devote 20 to 25 percent of their roof surface to greeneries.

Perhaps plantation-hopping from Malaysia where they had been released half a century earlier to control a caterpillar infestation in coffee groves. Or maybe as stowaways on ships. Either way, the crows fared well, increasing from several hundreds in the 1960s, to hundreds of thousands by the beginning of the twenty-first century.

This is one reason why urban ecosystems contain just a small subset of the species that lived there before. In an article in Nature in 2003, Australian ecologist Barry Brook, with Navjot Sodhi and Peter Ng of Singapore\x{2019}s Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, enumerated precisely what had happened to Singapore\x{2019}s flora and fauna since the start of urbanization in the early nineteenth century.

Indeed, much of its nature is history. As Brook, Sodhi, and Ng found out, over the past two centuries or so, as the erstwhile continuous rainforest was logged, converted, and fragmented, species disappeared from the island one by one. The huge tiger orchid, the largest orchid in the world, was last seen <<around 1900|18:0>>, while tigers themselves left the island for good when the last one was shot in 1930. The Great Slaty Woodpecker disappeared in the second half of the twentieth century.

            "As so often in scientific research, their meticulousness, stamina and utter immunity to boredom paid off in the end. In a two-page article in Current Biology in 2013, they assembled all the data that their thirty years of calipering swallow wings had yielded. In the 1980s, when the birds had just begun nesting on the roadside structures, all birds, dead or alive, had wings that were about the same length: <<around 10|9:0>>.8cm. But as time went on, they found that the living birds\x{2019} wings grew shorter, by about 2mm per decade. Not much, and perhaps not really worth noticing if their measurements on the roadkill had not shown the exact opposite pattern: by the 2010s, the wings of dead birds by the roadside were about half a centimeter longer than those of live birds still happily flapping along. Also, even though the pressure of traffic had remained the same or even increased, the numbers of dead birds declined by almost 90 percent.",

            "On the other side of the Atlantic, in southern France, unforgiving tarmac also drives evolution. Not birds, in this case, but plants. Pierre-Olivier Cheptou, a botanist at the Montpellier\x{2019}s branch of the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), has been studying weeds on the city\x{2019}s pavements. Or rather, in the one-square-yard quadrats of soil around trees planted along those sidewalks. As Cheptou writes in one of his papers, \x{201c}these patches are widely distributed (several thousand in the city), and regularly spaced, from <<5 to 10|10a:0>> m[eters] from each other depending on the street.\x{201d} Indeed, as I descend into Montpellier on spaceship Google Earth, the square snippets of soil become visible on my computer screen all over town. Like tiny bits of Versailles, the geometric pattern along Rue Auguste Broussonet, Avenue Henri Mar\x{e8}s, and Chemin des Barques looks like a city-sized ecological experiment. And that is exactly how Cheptou and his colleagues used it.",

            'So, our world is becoming thoroughly human-dominated. By <<2030|9e:1>>, nearly 10 percent of the landmass of the planet will be urbanized, and much of the rest covered by human-shaped farms, pasture, and plantations. Altogether a set of entirely new habitats, the likes of which nature has not seen before. And yet, when we talk about ecology and evolution, about ecosystems and nature, we are stubbornly factoring out humans, myopically focusing our attention on that diminishing fraction of habitats where human influence is still negligible. Either that, or we are trying to quarantine nature, as much as possible, from the harmful impacts of the human, implicitly non-natural, world.',
