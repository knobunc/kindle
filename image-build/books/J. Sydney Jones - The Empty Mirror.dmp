That final gift was intended for him.

She had, so the French papers reported, sent her entourage by train ahead of her as she had a horror of processions. Thus, only a valet from the hotel, carrying the empress\x{2019}s cloak and traveling case, and the Countess Sztaray were accompanying her as they passed the Brunswick monument on their way to the steamer.

The countess and valet turned just as the man ran away. They thought he was a thief, trying to steal the empress\x{2019}s watch, which she wore as a broach. The countess helped the empress to her feet, and she was apparently unhurt, but somewhat shaken. She told the countess that it was nothing, and that they must hurry or miss the boat. They proceeded to the steamer, where the empress finally collapsed, and where-in the privacy of their stateroom-the countess discovered a wound over the empress\x{2019}s left bosom. It was a small hole emitting a trickle of blood. By this time the steamer had already left shore and there was no doctor aboard to assist them. Appraised of the situation and the importance of the passenger, the captain turned the steamer around and returned to port, where the empress was taken on an improvised stretcher fashioned out of sailcloth and six oars back to her former suite at the Hotel Beau-Rivage. There a Doktor Golay was summoned, but there was nothing he could do. I have seen the autopsy report. The puncture wound penetrated to a depth of eight and a half centimeters, entering just above the fourth rib and breaking it with the violence of the blow. It then passed through the pericardium and struck the left ventricle of the heart. Initially, the blood released internally only, into the pericardium, and slowly enough so that the empress at first thought there was little injury to her person. But by the time she had returned to the hotel, the blood was soaking her dress. She died at <<ten minutes after two|10>>.\x{201d}",
