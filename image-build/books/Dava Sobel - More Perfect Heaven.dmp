            "The cricket is a musical being. At the break of dawn it starts to sing. But much louder and more vociferous, according to its nature, is it heard at the noon hour, because intoxicated by the Sun\x{2019}s rays. As the songster chirps, then, it turns the tree into a platform and the field into a theater, performing a concert for the wayfarers.\x{2014}FROM Letters of Theophylactus Simocatta,
THE FIRST PUBLISHED WORK BY COPERNICUS, 1509Nicolaus Copernicus, the man credited with turning our perception of the cosmos inside out, was born in the city of Torun, part of \x{201c}Old Prussia\x{201d} in the Kingdom of Poland, at <<4:48|2>> on Friday afternoon, the nineteenth of February, 1473. His horoscope for that auspicious moment (preserved in the Bavarian State Library in Munich) shows the Sun at 11\x{b0} of Pisces in the sixth house, while Jupiter and the Moon are \x{201c}conjunct,\x{201d} or practically on top of one another, at 4\x{b0} and 5\x{b0}, respectively, of Sagittarius, in the third house. Whatever clues to character or destiny such data may contain, this particular natal chart is an after-the-fact construct, created at the end of the astronomer\x{2019}s life and not the beginning of it (with the time of birth calculated, as opposed to copied from a birth certificate). At the time his horoscope was cast, Copernicus\x{2019}s contemporaries already knew he had fathered an alternate universe\x{2014}that he had defied common sense and received wisdom to place the Sun at the center of the heavens, then set the Earth in motion around it.Nearing seventy, Copernicus had little cause to recall the exact date of his birth, let alone the hour of it down to the precision of minutes. Nor had he ever expressed the slightest faith in any astrological prognostications. His companion at the time, however, a professed devotee of the \x{201c}juridical art,\x{201d} apparently pressed Copernicus for biographical details to see how his stars aligned.The horoscope\x{2019}s symbols and triangular compartments position the Sun, Moon, and planets above or below the horizon, along the zodiac\x{2014}the ring of constellations through which they appear to wander. The numerical notations describe more precisely where they lie at the moment, with respect to the twelve signs and also twelve so-called houses governing realms of life experience. Although the diagram invites interpretation, no accompanying conjecture has survived alongside it. One modern astrologer, invited to consider Copernicus\x{2019}s case, used computer software to draw a new configuration in the shape of a wheel, and added solar-system bodies unknown in his time. Uranus and Neptune thus crept into the third house beside the Moon and Jupiter, while Pluto, a dark force, manifested itself opposite the Sun, at 16\x{b0} of Virgo in the first house. The Pluto-Sun opposition drew a gasp from the astrologer, who declared it the hallmark of a born revolutionary.The bold plan for astronomical reform that Copernicus conceived and then nurtured over decades in his spare time struck him as the blueprint for the \x{201c}marvelous symmetry of the universe.\x{201d} Even so, he proceeded cautiously, first leaking the idea to a few fellow mathematicians, never trying to proselytize. All the while real and bloody revolutions\x{2014}the Protestant Reformation, the Peasant Rebellion, warfare with the Teutonic Knights and the Ottoman Turks\x{2014}churned around him. He held off publishing his theory for so long that when his great book, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, finally appeared in print, its author breathed his last. He never heard any of the criticism, or acclaim, that attended On the Revolutions. Decades after his death, when the first telescopic discoveries lent credence to his intuitions, the Holy Office of the Inquisition condemned his efforts. In 1616, On the Revolutions was listed on the Index of Prohibited Books, where it remained for more than two hundred years. The philosophical conflict and change in perception that his ideas engendered are sometimes referred to as the Copernican Revolution.",

            "With a wave of his hand, he had made the Earth a planet and set it spinning. In fact he saw it propelled in three ways, on three circular routes. The first spirited the planet around the Sun every year. The second twirled it daily, producing the heavenly fireworks of sunrise, sunset, and what he called the \x{201c}headlong whirl\x{201d} of stars through the night. The third motion slowly wobbled the poles over the course of the year, to account for the direction of tilt for the Earth\x{2019}s axis.\x{201c}Whatever motion appears in the sphere of the fixed stars belongs not to it but to the Earth,\x{201d} he continued. \x{201c}Thus the entire Earth, along with the nearby elements\x{201d}\x{2014}meaning the oceans and the air\x{2014}\x{201c}rotates with a daily motion on its fixed poles, while the sphere of the fixed stars remains immovable and the outermost heaven.\x{201d}Even Ptolemy had once conceded it might be easier in theory to let the Earth spin than to expect the whole firmament to wheel fully about every twenty-four hours\x{2014}except that the idea of the Earth\x{2019}s turning was \x{201c}utterly ridiculous even to think of.\x{201d}As soon as Copernicus called for the Sun and the Earth to swap places, the planets snapped into a logical new order. They arrayed themselves outward from the Sun according to their speed of revolution, so that Mercury, long observed to be the fastest, was also the closest, followed by Venus, then Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and finally Saturn, the slowest. In the Earth-centric view, neither observation nor theory had ever settled the question as to which planet lay just past the Moon\x{2014}whether Venus or Mercury\x{2014}or whether the Sun orbited before, between, or beyond those two. Now he knew. Everything fit. No wonder the beauty of the system prevailed over the absurdity of the Earth\x{2019}s motion. He hoped his own conviction would convince others to see the spheres his way, but offered no proofs at this point. He had decided, he said, \x{201c}for the sake of brevity to leave the mathematical demonstrations out of this treatise, as they are intended for a larger book.\x{201d} Then he proceeded to count and clarify all the individual planetary motions, arriving, in the final paragraph of the Commentariolus, at the grand total: \x{201c}Mercury runs on seven circles in all; Venus on five; the earth on three, and round it the moon on four; finally Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn on five each. Altogether, therefore, thirty-four circles suffice to explain the entire structure of the universe and the entire ballet of the planets.\x{201d}Copernicus surely anticipated ridicule from his contemporaries. If the Earth rotated and revolved at great speed, they could argue, then anything not nailed down would go flying. Clouds and birds would be left behind. Moreover, his fellow astronomers could insist the Earth truly belonged at the center\x{2014}not because humanity\x{2019}s home deserved any special importance in the cosmic scheme, but because heavy, earthy things fell to rest there, and because change and death befell Earth\x{2019}s inhabitants. The Earth represented the pit, not the pinnacle, of Creation. Therefore one dare not shove the Sun\x{2014}\x{201c}the lamp of Heaven,\x{201d} as many called it\x{2014}into the Hell hole at the center of the universe.Several Islamic astronomers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had found fault with Ptolemy for the same reasons Copernicus did. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and Ibn al-Shatir, for example, managed to adjust Ptolemy\x{2019}s circle violations without requiring the Earth to turn or abandon its central place. Copernicus used some of the same mathematical devices in his revision of Ptolemy, but reached his own singular conclusions about the Sun\x{2019}s centrality, the Earth\x{2019}s mobility, and the grandiose inflation of the cosmos required by his design.If the Earth trekked all the way around the Sun, as he maintained, then two neighboring stars should appear now slightly closer together, now farther apart over the course of the year. Yet the stars never displayed any such displacement, or \x{201c}parallax.\x{201d} Copernicus got around the absence of parallax by supposing the stars too far away to reveal it. He increased their distance more than a hundredfold\x{2014}so remote that the Earth-Sun separation shrank by comparison to the point of insignificance. \x{201c}Compared to the great height of the sphere of the fixed stars,\x{201d} he averred, \x{201c}the distance between the Sun and the Earth is imperceptible.\x{201d} The enormous chasm that suddenly yawned open between Saturn and the stars did not trouble Copernicus, as he had a ready explanation for it in the Creator\x{2019}s omnipotence: \x{201c}So vast, without any question, is the divine handiwork of the most excellent Almighty.\x{201d} Beyond the periphery of the stars, God and His Angels hovered in the invisible heavens of the Empyrean.After completing the Commentariolus <<around 1510|18:1>>, Copernicus began the slow work of elaborating his theory. The thirty-four circles of the planetary ballet now required exact design specifications, such as the radius of each one, its rate of rotation, and its spatial relationship to the other thirty-three. He could calculate many of these hundred-plus parameters using time-honored methods and tables. Then he would test the values by making his own observations.The chapter, however, had other expectations of him.In November 1510 Copernicus and fellow canon Fabian Luzjanski, who had studied with him in Bologna, went on an important mission to the chapter\x{2019}s southern provinces. There they accepted the large sum of 238 marks\x{2014}a full year\x{2019}s revenue from the labor of peasants on Church land\x{2014}for safe transport back to Frauenburg. Given that the Teutonic Knights were regularly and ruthlessly robbing the population of Varmia, the two couriers traversed the wooded, hundred-mile route home in constant danger of being waylaid and relieved of their cargo of coins. (Paper money had not yet come into circulation in Europe.) When they reached Frauenburg without incident, they distributed the funds among the canons according to custom.The next November, in 1511, the chapter named Copernicus its chancellor, charged with overseeing the financial accounts and composing all official correspondence. The pace and volume of that correspondence quickened at the sudden death of his uncle the bishop on March 29, 1512. A week after Lukasz Watzenrode\x{2019}s passing, the canons met on April 5 to elect his successor. They voted unanimously for their own Fabian Luzjanski\x{2014}all except Luzjanski himself, who wrote another\x{2019}s name on the ballot. The next day the canons gathered again and chose Tiedemann Giese to conduct the necessary confirmation negotiations with the Vatican. By June 1 the chapter needed two more spokesmen to contend against the king\x{2019}s objections to their designated bishop. King Sigismund found no particular fault with Luzjanski; he simply preferred to install his own candidates in such positions. The Rome-Krakow-Varmia wrangle over the bishopric wore on through the summer and fall. On December 7, under a new agreement, Sigismund at last accepted Luzjanski, in exchange for the right of final approval over all future bishop selections. In addition, he insisted the entire chapter must pledge an oath of allegiance to the Crown, which they did on December 28, confident the king would honor, in return, his promise of royal protection.",

            "\x{201c}Jacob took possession of one parcel,\x{201d} Copernicus\x{2019}s account continues, \x{201c}from which death removed Caspar Casche. The building is in ruins, and the parcel is of little value, and for that reason was abandoned by Caspar\x{2019}s heirs and guardians. When Jacob took possession, I gave him one horse, a quarter of the previously planted millet, and exemption from the next annual payment.\x{201d} Copernicus also named Michael Wayner, brother of the runaway, as \x{201c}his guarantor in perpetuity\x{201d}\x{2014}to guarantee that Jacob would never again run away.\x{201c}Gregor Noske took possession of 1\x{bd} parcels, from which Matz Leze ran away because he was suspected of thievery.\x{201d}Land changed hands among the peasants in every month of the year\x{2014}from \x{201c}the antepenultimate of January\x{201d} and \x{201c}the Sabbath before Palm\x{201d} to \x{201c}the day of Peter and Paul,\x{201d} \x{201c}the feast of Michael,\x{201d} \x{201c}St. Cecilia\x{2019}s,\x{201d} and \x{201c}the day of the 11,000 Virgins.\x{201d}As he alternated between saintly and standard designations for dates in his record keeping, Copernicus kept up his lone struggle to define the true duration of the year. His invited remarks to the Lateran Council about the problematic Julian calendar had probably lamented astronomers\x{2019} ignorance of the year\x{2019}s exact length. With or without calendar reform, Copernicus still needed to ascertain this fundamental parameter. The length of the year defined the Earth\x{2019}s orbit around the Sun\x{2014}or, as other astronomers believed, the Sun\x{2019}s orbit around the Earth\x{2014}and pertained to almost every calculation in the heliocentric or any other planetary theory.\x{201c}Petrus, a herdsman in Thomasdorf, took possession of 2 parcels, which are vacant because Hans ran away.\x{201d}Copernicus fashioned a new yardstick for the year in an open loge on the south face of Allenstein Castle, just outside his private apartment. Laying white stucco over the ruddy bricks, he painted the grid of a sundial onto the smoothed surface. The lines and numbers must have been blue and red when new, though only a hint of color survives in the faded dial fragment still clinging to the castle wall. Underneath, either on a table or the floor, he set a mirror\x{2014}or maybe he used a bowl of red wine\x{2014}to catch the Sun\x{2019}s reflection and throw it up to the dial, where he charted the changing solar altitude through the seasons.\x{201c}Jacob of Jomendorf took possession of 2 parcels, which were sold to him with my permission by Marcus Kycol, who is very old.\x{201d}The Sun reaches its highest point at the summer solstice, which occurs on the longest day of the year, and a year may be gauged by the lapse of time between one summer solstice and the next. Or one could measure the time passing between one year\x{2019}s vernal equinox\x{2014}when the Sun crosses the Equator at the start of spring, dividing the day into equal halves of dark and light\x{2014}and the vernal equinox that follows. The equinox proved easier than the solstice for Copernicus to capture, because the Sun\x{2019}s position changes more dramatically day to day during the run-up to equal day and night than it does near the longest day of the year. Still, determining the exact moment of the equinox challenges even the most diligent observer. In some years, the moment defies observation altogether if it occurs during the night or twilight hours of the given day.Copernicus worked around the natural obstacles by making a series of <<noon|13>> observations over a period of several days before and after the anticipated event, and then interpolating the time. His calculation gave him the year\x{2019}s duration down to minutes and seconds in an age when no clock could shave moments so closely. He repeated the process annually, pooling his figures to improve their accuracy. He also factored in a few results from Ptolemy, to further increase his baseline, and he adopted Ptolemy\x{2019}s technique of reckoning dates by the reigns of ancient rulers. Thus Copernicus recalled observing an autumnal equinox at Frauenburg \x{201c}in the year of Our Lord 1515 on the 18th day before the Kalends of October, but according to the Egyptian calendar it was the 1840th year after the death of Alexander on the 6th day of the month of Phaophi, half an hour after sunrise.\x{201d} Despite its awkward phraseology, the Egyptian calendar appealed to Copernicus\x{2019}s contemporaries because of its consistency: The list of kings stretched all the way back to the eighth century B.C., and every year consisted of twelve identical months, thirty days each, plus an extra five days tacked on at the end\x{2014}with no leap years. A sixteenth-century date converted to Egyptian style allowed easy computation of the time elapsed since any similar observation by Ptolemy.\x{201c}Jacob has 2 parcels and sold them with my permission to Lorenz, the overseer\x{2019}s brother.\x{201d}The coins the peasants put down on their transactions were a mishmash of old and new currencies, both Prussian and Polish. The Teutonic Knights had been minting Prussian marks in the region since the thirteenth century, but at the start of the Thirteen Years\x{2019} War in 1454, King Kazimierz extended minting privileges to the cities of Torun, Elbing, and Danzig. The burghers then turned out their own Prussian coins at an enthusiastic rate, in the familiar denominations: marks, skoters, groats, and pence. In the absence of anything resembling national standards or official exchange rates, however, the intrinsic value of a mark\x{2014}the volume of silver it contained\x{2014}varied from mint to mint. Even the same mint might shift the balance of silver to copper in its specie on a whim. Thanks to a suspiciously diminishing proportion of silver in successive issues, a new mark weighed less than an old one, while pretending to equal the old value. Copernicus proved the weight difference by comparing coins in a balance pan. He knew that canny citizens were taking advantage of the discrepancy by spending the new coins and hoarding the old ones, which they would take to the goldsmith to be melted down for the greater worth of their metal content. Other abuses, such as nipping off bits of coins\x{2019} edges, also contributed to the currency\x{2019}s debasement. Sometimes the pennies the peasants paid toward their rent, despite a full quotient of the proper alloy, had been pinched and handled through such long use as to be worn thin.",

            "Coinage is imprinted gold or silver, by which the prices of things bought and sold are reckoned according to the regulations of any State or its ruler. It is therefore a measure of values. A measure, however, must always preserve a fixed and constant standard. Otherwise, public order is necessarily disturbed, with buyers and sellers being cheated in many ways, just as if the yard, bushel, or pound did not maintain an invariable magnitude.\x{2014}FROM COPERNICUS\x{2019}S REVISED MONEY ESSAY, 1522The canons fled the torched city of Frauenburg for temporary shelter in Danzig, Elbing, and Allenstein. Copernicus perforce returned to the heavily fortified castle he had so recently vacated. The new administrator, Jan Krapitz, welcomed him there, happy to have such an experienced diplomat by his side in a time of war. But each month brought more terrible news to the canons trapped at Allenstein, as Albrecht\x{2019}s armies swarmed over Varmia. Copernicus, resuming the office of chancellor, composed letters to the king to request arms and men for defense. He directed these pleas first to Heilsberg, where Bishop Fabian signed them and sent them on to Sigismund in Krakow. Sometimes the enemy intercepted the desperate correspondence, and sometimes the king received it but could not comply. Even when he responded with reinforcements, the new recruits failed to rout the knights.Confined to the castle, Copernicus continued the planetary observations that clarified his picture of the universe. On February 19, 1520, his forty-seventh birthday, he judged Jupiter, at <<6:00 A.M.|2a>>, to be 4\x{b0}3\x{2019} to the west of \x{201c}the first, brighter star in the forehead of the Scorpion.\x{201d} Sometime in the spring, Jupiter would reach its annual opposition, to appear exactly opposite the Sun in Earth\x{2019}s skies. No one could see both bodies at once when that happened, but an experienced practitioner might fix the time by combining predictions from theory with observations over a period of months. Having thus begun his watch in February, Copernicus marked the moment of opposition at <<11:00 A.M.|2a>> on April 30. Jupiter was then moving in reverse, or \x{201c}retrograde,\x{201d} as though backing away from the Scorpion\x{2019}s sting\x{2014}and also making its closest approach to Earth. While other astronomers viewed the timing of these several events as coincidence, Copernicus linked them inextricably together as the consequence of planetary order: The Earth, being closer to the Sun, overtook the slower Jupiter once per year. In passing, it left the Sun to one side and Jupiter on the other, coming as close to Jupiter as ever it could. Jupiter itself never changed the direction of its movement at such times, but merely appeared to do so to observers on Earth as they sped by. The same logic governed the annual opposition of Saturn, which Copernicus tagged a few months later, at <<noon|13>> on July 13.The movements of Jupiter and Saturn at this juncture raised alarm among astrologers. The two planets were heading toward their \x{201c}Great Conjunction\x{201d}\x{2014}the close heavenly union that they consummated every two decades, always with momentous effects. The popular almanac by Johann Stoeffler and Jacob Pflaum foresaw in the upcoming Great Conjunction of 1524 \x{201c}changes and transformations for the whole world, for all regions, kingdoms, provinces, states, ranks, beasts, marine animals, and everything that is born of the earth\x{2014}changes such as we have hardly heard of for centuries before our time, either from historians, or from our elders. Raise your heads accordingly, Christian men.\x{201d}On October 19, 1520, a detachment of knights surrounded Bishop Fabian\x{2019}s palace at Heilsberg and settled in siege there for weeks. Under these circumstances, the chapter turned Jan Krapitz out of office at the November election, though he had served only one year, and drafted Copernicus to replace him. On the day his second stint as administrator started, November 11, restless knights hovered within a day\x{2019}s ride of Allenstein, where only a hundred of the king\x{2019}s soldiers stood guard at the gates.Copernicus filled some of his most anxious hours cataloguing the chapter\x{2019}s archives, which had been moved to Allenstein over the years for safer keeping inside the castle treasury. The whole embattled history of the diocese lived in these documents, going all the way back to the bull of Pope Innocent IV in 1243, defining the boundaries of Prussia, and the 1264 parchment on which Anselm, the first Bishop of Varmia, envisioned the raising of a great cathedral at Frauenburg. The several hundred items\x{2014}bulls, treaties, grants, deeds, wills, testimonials, petitions\x{2014}filled a chest of many drawers. Even as Copernicus sifted and re-sorted the legal materials with their ornate official seals, he wrote new letters of appeal, begging King Sigismund to bolster the forces protecting Allenstein\x{2019}s repository:\x{201c}Most Gracious Prince and Lord, Sigismund, by the Grace of God King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sovereign and Hereditary Lord of Ruthenia and Prussia, and our Most Gracious Lord,\x{201d} Copernicus addressed His Majesty on November 16. He described the awful details of the previous day\x{2019}s invasion of the nearby city of Gutstadt, now fallen to the knights, and expressed his willingness to die\x{2014}as it seemed likely he would\x{2014}in defense of Allenstein.\x{201c}For we are desirous to do what befits noble and honest persons, who are completely devoted to Your Majesty, even if we had to perish. All our possessions and ourselves we commend and entrust to Your Majesty\x{2019}s care.\x{201d} Meanwhile he continued methodically to list those possessions: \x{201c}Document concerning the transfer of the head of St. George from Heilsberg to Frauenburg Cathedral,\x{201d} \x{201c}Document of the king of France concerning a gift of wood from the Holy Cross.\x{201d}",

            "Copernicus, who had shunned the easy road to the bishopric that his uncle once paved for him, now found himself presiding at Heilsberg Palace. The chapter chose him to watch over all the lands of the diocese, including those appertaining to the bishop\x{2019}s see, until Fabian\x{2019}s successor was installed. Given the rancor that had surrounded the selection process after Bishop Watzenrode\x{2019}s passing, King Sigismund sent his envoys to Heilsberg in February to foil any preemptive election attempts by the chapter. Copernicus received these men with assurances that the canons would not only honor the king\x{2019}s right of nomination and approval, but also swear their allegiance to him anew under the next bishop, whosoever that might be.On April 13, the chapter chose the king\x{2019}s favorite, Maurycy Ferber. Bishop-elect Ferber, a distant relative of Tiedemann Giese, belonged to a politically powerful family from Danzig, where one of his kinsmen currently served as mayor of the city. Pending papal approval of Ferber, Copernicus acted as de facto bishop all through the spring and summer of 1523. He struggled to restore law and order by ridding the region of recalcitrant knights and the rear guard of the Polish military. The very forces who had come to Varmia\x{2019}s defense now illegally occupied several villages and fortresses. They refused to leave until the king intervened. Following Sigismund\x{2019}s orders of July 10, all Polish commanders of troops squatting in the diocese finally relinquished their claims and decamped. The knights, however, remained.In August the Moon turned red\x{2014}not as a metaphor for blood or war, but actually and naturally, as the result of a total lunar eclipse. Copernicus noted the first dip of the full Moon into the cone of the Earth\x{2019}s shadow at \x{201c}2 and 4/<<5 hours past midnight|10>>,\x{201d} or <<2:48 A.M.|2a>> on August 26.Traversing the shadow of the Earth, the Moon dimmed by degrees until fully immersed. Then, instead of disappearing in darkness, the eclipsed Moon daubed itself with the Sun\x{2019}s color: It glowed like an ember throughout the hour of totality, reflecting all the dusk and dawn light that spilled into Earth\x{2019}s shadow from the day before and the day ahead.Copernicus never missed a lunar eclipse. No astronomer let such an opportunity slip, for the Moon in eclipse pinpointed celestial positions as no other phenomenon could. At such times the Earth\x{2019}s shadow became visible on the Moon\x{2019}s surface, and the center of that shadow indicated the location of the Sun\x{2014}180\x{b0} opposite in celestial longitude. With the Moon\x{2019}s current coordinates thus confirmed, one could also measure the distances of stars and planets from either the Sun or the Moon. \x{201c}In this area,\x{201d} Copernicus remarked, \x{201c}Nature\x{2019}s kindliness has been attentive to human desires, inasmuch as the Moon\x{2019}s place is determined more reliably through its eclipses than through the use of instruments, and without any suspicion of error.\x{201d}Even with the help of \x{201c}Nature\x{2019}s kindliness,\x{201d} the tilt of the Moon\x{2019}s orbit relative to the Earth\x{2019}s great circle limited the frequency of lunar eclipses to once or at most twice a year, though some years have none. After August 26, there would not be another total lunar eclipse till the end of December 1525.At the moment of mid-eclipse, which Copernicus recorded on this occasion as <<4:25 A.M.|2a>>, the Moon stood at opposition, yet stayed its course straight ahead. Unlike Jupiter or Saturn, the Moon never shifted into reverse at opposition\x{2014}or ever, at any time\x{2014}because the Moon, alone among all heavenly bodies, truly did orbit the Earth.\x{201c}In expounding on the Moon\x{2019}s motion,\x{201d} Copernicus wrote, with no apparent irony, \x{201c}I do not disagree with the ancients\x{2019} belief that it takes place around the Earth.\x{201d}",

            "Copernicus also became defensive. By his own admission, he did not feel so confident of his own work as to care nothing for others\x{2019} opinions of it. He agreed with Giese that readers ignorant of astronomy might easily attack his ideas by twisting chapter and verse to their purposes. Others might laugh at the absurdity of the basic premise. A joke at his expense held that he mistook the Earth for a side of beef, so he put it on a spit and roasted it in the Sun\x{2019}s fire.The difficulty of the work, coupled with the press of his other duties, may have held Copernicus\x{2019}s anxieties at bay while he was writing his book about the heavenly revolutions. Since he kept no log of his progress, and no one witnessed his isolated toil, it is difficult to say which sections he wrote when, or how long he labored over each. The last observation mentioned in its pages is the one he made on March 12, 1529, when the Moon passed in front of the planet Venus and hid it from view.\x{201c}I saw Venus beginning to be occulted by the Moon\x{2019}s dark side midway between both horns at one hour after sunset\x{2014}the start of the eighth hour <<after noon|13>>,\x{201d} he reported. \x{201c}This occultation lasted until the end of that hour or a little longer, when I observed the planet emerging westward on the other side. Therefore, at or about the middle of this hour, clearly there was a central conjunction of the Moon and Venus, a spectacle that I witnessed at Frauenburg.\x{201d} He used that observation, paired with others from antiquity, to describe the revolutions and mean motions of Venus, in several pages\x{2019} worth of diagrams and geometrical proofs spelled out in his small, neat handwriting.With his book virtually complete by 1535, Copernicus lost courage. He worried that his labored calculations and tables would not yield the perfect match with planetary positions that he had aimed to achieve. He feared the public reaction. He empathized with the ancient sage Pythagoras, who had communicated his most beautiful ideas only to kinsmen and friends, and only by word of mouth, never in writing.Despite the decades of effort invested in the text, Copernicus eschewed publication. If his theory appeared in print, he said, he would be laughed off the stage. No argument from Giese could change his mind.Other supporters also tried to sway him. In the summer of 1533, for example, the distinguished linguist and diplomat Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter, then secretary to Pope Clement VII, delivered a lecture on Copernicus\x{2019}s astronomy in the Vatican gardens. Widmanstetter went on, after Clement\x{2019}s death the following year, to serve Nicholas Sch\x{f6}nberg, the Cardinal of Capua, and to awaken in him a profound desire to see Copernicus\x{2019}s book published.On November 1, 1536, the cardinal wrote from Rome: \x{201c}Some years ago word reached me concerning your proficiency, of which everybody constantly spoke.\x{201d} Cardinal Sch\x{f6}nberg had traveled to Poland in 1518 on a peacekeeping mission. Although Albrecht and the Teutonic Order rebuffed his gestures, Bishop Fabian Luzjanski had entertained him in Varmia. \x{201c}At that time I began to have a very high regard for you, and also to congratulate our contemporaries among whom you enjoyed such great prestige. For I had learned that you had not merely mastered the discoveries of the ancient astronomers uncommonly well, but had also formulated a new cosmology. In it you maintain that the Earth moves; that the Sun occupies the lowest, and thus the central, place in the universe; that the eighth heaven remains perpetually motionless and fixed; and that the Earth, together with the elements included in its sphere, and the Moon, situated between the heavens of Mars and Venus, revolves around the Sun in the period of a year. I have also learned that you have written an exposition of this whole system of astronomy, and have computed the planetary motions and set them down in tables, to the greatest admiration of all. Therefore with the utmost earnestness I entreat you, most learned Sir, unless I inconvenience you, to communicate this discovery of yours to scholars, together with the tables and what ever else you have that is relevant to this subject. Moreover, I have instructed Theodoric of Reden to have everything copied in your quarters at my expense and dispatched to me. If you gratify my desire in this matter, you will see that you are dealing with a man who is zealous for your reputation and eager to do justice to so fine a talent. Farewell.\x{201d}Copernicus received this letter, read it perhaps several times over, and then, without responding, filed it away for future use.",

            "From one sack of either grain, wheat or rye, cleansed of any grass or weeds before grinding in order that the bread may come out cleaner and purer \x{2026} a careful weighing shows that at least 66 pounds of bread are produced, not counting the weight of the baskets.\x{2014}FROM COPERNICUS\x{2019}S Bread Tariff, CA. 1531Having banished the Lutherans from Varmia, Bishop Ferber set about putting his own house in order. How shameful, he complained in February of 1531, that in the entire chapter there was barely one priest entitled to celebrate Mass. A general lack of Holy Orders had long characterized the canons at Frauenburg, but now the bishop, who was himself ordained, implored them all to receive their orders\x{2014}the special grace, imparted by the laying on of hands, that empowered them to administer the sacraments\x{2014}before Easter. He peered into the private corners of the canons\x{2019} lives and did not hesitate to censure the slightest infraction. The fifty miles separating the bishop from his subordinates apparently posed no impediment to his learning of their lapses, as when he found out how Canon Copernicus\x{2019}s former housekeeper, though long since discharged, had recently returned to Frauenburg and spent the night with him.The bishop discreetly took pen in his own hand on this occasion, circumventing his personal secretary. As he recalled\x{2014}or more likely was reminded by an informant\x{2014}the housekeeper had married hurriedly after being let go, as though to cover an inconvenient pregnancy, but later separated from her husband. The bishop understood such things. He, too, had been in love as a youth, until his intended jilted him. He fought hard to defend his claim to her hand, producing articles of her clothing as proof of their intimacy, filing suit against her family in the papal court, and traveling to Rome to plead the case himself. When his beloved ultimately wed another man, Maurycy Ferber entered the priesthood.Now Bishop Ferber called Copernicus to account for his assignation. With the Mother Church under Lutheran attack, no breach of decorum could be borne.\x{201c}My noble lord,\x{201d} Copernicus replied on July 27, 1531, \x{201c}Most Reverend Father in Christ, my gracious and most honorable lord:\x{201c}With due expression of respect and deference, I have received your letter. Again you have deigned to write to me with your own hand, conveying an admonition at the outset. In this regard I most humbly ask your Most Reverend Lordship not to overlook the fact that the woman about whom you write to me was given in marriage through no plan or action of mine. But this is what happened. Considering that she had once been my faithful servant, with all my energy and zeal I endeavored to persuade them to remain with each other as respectable spouses. I would venture to call on God as my witness in this matter, and they would both admit it if they were interrogated. But she complained that her husband was impotent, a condition which he acknowledged in court as well as outside. Hence my efforts were in vain. For they argued the case before his Lordship the Dean, your Very Reverend Lordship\x{2019}s nephew, of blessed memory, and then before the Venerable Lord Custodian [Tiedemann Giese]. Hence I cannot say whether their separation came about through him or her or both by mutual consent.\x{201c}However, with reference to the matter, I will admit to your Lordship that when she was recently passing through here from the K\x{f6}nigsberg fair with the woman from Elbing who employs her, she remained in my house until the next day. But since I realize the bad opinion of me arising therefrom, I shall so order my affairs that nobody will have any proper pretext to suspect evil of me hereafter, especially on account of your Most Reverend Lordship\x{2019}s admonition and exhortation. I want to obey you gladly in all matters, and I should obey you, out of a desire that my services may always be acceptable.\x{201d}Copernicus\x{2019}s official services at this date made him a guardian of the chapter\x{2019}s counting table. He and Giese, the other guardian, worked side by side collecting installment payments from wealthy individuals who had bought land or commercial operations from the diocese. They also managed the chapter\x{2019}s endowment funds and invested its money in various capital ventures, including the construction of a tavern and inn in Frauenburg. The guardians made new purchases\x{2014}of properties and sometimes supplies as well, such as \x{201c}cannon, handguns, lead, and powder for the defense of the Cathedral\x{201d}\x{2014}and they paid the salary for the cathedral\x{2019}s preacher.Probably in the line of his duties as guardian in 1531, Copernicus created his undated Bread Tariff. This handwritten document aimed to fix the price of a peasant\x{2019}s daily loaf at an affordable one penny\x{2014}while simultaneously protecting the interests of the chapter-operated bakery. He advised adjusting the weight of a penny loaf according to the price of grain. Approaching the problem with his typical thoroughness, he calculated a sliding scale to cover a wide range of foreseeable market fluctuations. When harvests were plentiful and grain sold for a pittance, say nine shillings (fifty-four pence) a sack, the peasants would share the bounty, because their penny loaves would weigh in excess of one pound apiece. In lean years, however, should grain prices skyrocket as high as sixty-six shillings per sack, then Copernicus prescribed a loaf of bread had necessarily to shrink to one sixth of a pound. The chapter could recoup its other costs of production\x{2014}baker\x{2019}s wages, yeast\x{2014}from the separate sale of bran and chaff.While guardian, Copernicus made frequent trips to Heilsberg in his capacity as chapter physician, for Bishop Ferber was not a well man. Doctor Copernicus consulted several times with the king\x{2019}s physicians about his treatment. The bishop, partially disabled by an illness years earlier, seemed unable to regain his strength. He perforce sent proxies to meetings where his presence was required. By <<1532|9e:1>>, age sixty-one, he faced his failing health by naming a coadjutor to aid and eventually succeed him. Not surprisingly, he chose Giese. But King Sigismund interceded and gave the post instead to a career diplomat named Johannes von H\x{f6}fens, often called Johannes Flaxbinder because his ancestors worked as rope makers, and who signed his poems and letters Johannes Dantiscus, in homage to Danzig, his birthplace.Dantiscus had spent years angling for a lucrative Varmia canonry. The king first nominated him in 1514, to be Andreas\x{2019}s coadjutor, but the papal court endorsed someone else. The sudden decease of another canon in 1515 again enabled the king to name Dantiscus as a replacement, but this time both the chapter and the pope opposed him. Still the king continued to favor Dantiscus, not forgetting the long love poem he had written three years earlier\x{2014}the epithalamion for the royal wedding of Sigismund and Barbara. (By 1515, the young queen already lay in her grave, only twenty years old when she died giving birth to her second daughter.)Dantiscus made his next attempt at a canonry in 1528, while representing Poland at the Spanish court\x{2014}shortly after he successfully negotiated for Sigismund\x{2019}s new queen, Bona Sforza, the title she desired as Duchess of Bari. Dantiscus\x{2019}s third bid actually won the chapter\x{2019}s support, but failed again in Rome. Finally, on his fourth try, in 1529, Dantiscus got his wish. And then, the very next year, as though to reward his persistence, the king chose Canon Dantiscus to be Bishop of Kulm. The nearby diocese of Kulm was home to the Cistercian convent where Copernicus\x{2019}s sister Barbara had become a nun. Although Kulm could not compare with Varmia in political power or wealth, Dantiscus gladly anticipated putting on the miter. He remained in Spain the next two years, however, to complete his government mission there and also to see to the business of receiving Holy Orders, in order to become a priest prior to ascending to the bishopric.",

His birth, in the very early hours of February 16, 1514, coincided with a conjunction of the Moon and Saturn in the twelfth house. There was no mistaking the ominous import of these conditions: They augured an abnormally short life span. As an adept astrologer, Rheticus knew several ways to rectify a bad chart. In one experiment, he technically escaped his fate by moving his birthday to the previous day, February 15, and changing the time from nine minutes before the second hour of the morning to <<3:26 in the afternoon|2a>>. These alterations divided Saturn from the Moon and moved them into separate houses, granting him a reprieve. But it seems unlikely that such fiddling would have rid Rheticus of the fear of impending doom. A sword, like the one that had severed his father\x{2019}s head, hung menacingly over his own.",

1617\x{2013}21Content with thePrutenic Tables, European astronomers took Copernicus at Osiander\x{2019}s cautious word for the remainder of the sixteenth century\x{2014}with two monumental exceptions. Between them, the flamboyant Tycho Brahe and the studious, passionately reverent Johannes Kepler carried Copernicus\x{2019}s work to completion.The Danish Tycho was literally star-struck in 1559, during his thirteenth summer, when a lunar eclipse illuminated the mathematics he was learning at a Lutheran university in Copenhagen. His noble birth gave him the means to purchase his own astronomy books, which he bought secretly, he said, and also read in secret, since his elders considered such pastimes beneath him. Soon he began logging his own observations of the planets and casting the horoscopes of famous men. At <<twenty-five|9e:1>>, after losing most of his nose in a duel, he looked up one November night to see a nova\x{2019}s explosion blaze suddenly to brilliance in the constellation Cassiopeia. He spoke of that 1572 event ever after as the moment when the heavens chose him to be their interlocutor.\x{201c}In truth, it was the greatest wonder that has ever shown itself in the whole of nature since the beginning of the world,\x{201d} he announced in his hastily written book, De nova stella. Tycho\x{2019}s new star indeed heralded a cataclysm. By its position in the heavens\x{2014}too far from the zodiac to be a planet, too steadfast for a comet, and supralunar to boot\x{2014}it boded the end of immutability in Aristotle\x{2019}s celestial realms. Change could occur on high, Tycho\x{2019}s careful observations showed, in the guise of a new star\x{2019}s light. This claim competed for strangeness with Copernicus\x{2019}s moving Earth\x{2014}and perhaps Tycho winked at Copernicus when he compared the miracle of his Nova stella to Joshua\x{2019}s stopping the Sun by prayer.Tycho took his homeland\x{2019}s far northern latitudes (worse than those bemoaned by Copernicus) as a proud birthright, and dedicated an early work to King Frederick of Denmark. While Tycho did allow that the extreme cold of the climate could disturb an astronomer\x{2019}s serenity, it seems never to have deterred him. Five years after his nova discovery, in the early dark of another November night, Tycho stood fishing at a pond when a comet appeared to him. Its bright bluishwhite head and long ruddy tail\x{2014}like a flame seen through smoke, he said\x{2014}persisted through autumn into winter. That lengthy visitation gave Tycho time to prove that comets, though generally assumed to be quirks of the Earth\x{2019}s atmosphere, actually traced paths among the planets. In contrast to contemporaries who feared the comet augured famine and pestilence, maybe even the death of a leader, Tycho confined its wrath to the heavens themselves. The Great Comet of 1577 condemned the ancient notion that solid celestial spheres carried the planets on their eternal rounds. Tycho saw plainly that no such structures impeded the comet\x{2019}s free travel, and therefore concluded that no such structures existed. When he delivered this thunderbolt, one could almost hear the tinkle of shattering crystal.",

Therefore if any men might claim extreme distinction in intellect above all mankind, Ptolemy and Copernicus were such men, whose gaze was thus raised on high and who philosophized about the constitution of the world.\x{2014}GALILEO GALILEI, Dialogue Concerning the
Two Chief Systems of the World, 1632In an exchange of letters in Latin between Galileo and Kepler in 1597, prompted by the publication of Kepler\x{2019}s Mysterium, the Italian Catholic professor admitted to having long been \x{201c}a secret Copernican\x{201d} who could not openly espouse his belief in a moving Earth for fear of ridicule from colleagues. In reply, the German Lutheran exhorted him to join the pro-Copernican movement: \x{201c}Would it not be better to pull the rolling wagon to its destination with united effort?\x{201d}Galileo answered Kepler with silence. Not until <<1610|9c:0>>, after refining the optical instrument he called a spyglass, and discovering through its lenses heavenly marvels such as the moons of Jupiter, did he outwardly avow his support for Copernicus.Before Galileo\x{2019}s innovations refined the rudimentary spyglass, instruments had aided astronomers in defining only the positions of bodies. Galileo\x{2019}s telescopes enabled observers to glimpse composition as well. The lunar landscape, for example, erupted in rocky mountains and fell into deep valleys, mirroring the surface of the Earth. The Sun exhaled dark spots that gathered and glided across its face like windblown clouds. The telescope further upset the balance of the heavens by exposing unknown bodies\x{2014}not \x{201c}new\x{201d} entities such as Tycho\x{2019}s nova of 1572 (or Kepler\x{2019}s of 1604) that suddenly caught the naked eye, but never-before-seen objects beyond the reach of human vision, including ear-like appendages flanking Saturn and hundreds of faint stars filling in the outlines of the constellations. Also the planet Venus revealed a cycle of phases, from crescent to full, demonstrating beyond doubt that it revolved around the Sun. Venus\x{2019}s phases fit equally well into the Tychonic system or the Copernican, but Ptolemy\x{2019}s universe could not embrace such a phenomenon. Galileo published his findings. The Starry Messenger, a slim volume expounding his \x{201c}message from the stars,\x{201d} sold out within one week of its printing in Padua in March of 1610. After that, he could not build telescopes fast enough to keep pace with the demand.",

            "Galileo confronted Joshua head-on. He considered the miracle first from the Ptolemaic\x{2014}Earth-centric, Earth-static\x{2014}point of view, and then claimed the Copernican universe far better equipped to answer Joshua\x{2019}s prayers.\x{201c}Now let us consider the extent to which it is true that the famous passage in Joshua may be accepted without altering the literal meaning of its words, and under what conditions the day might be greatly lengthened by obedience of the Sun to Joshua\x{2019}s command that it stand still.\x{201c}In the Ptolemaic system, this could never happen at all. For the movement of the Sun through the ecliptic is from west to east, and hence it is opposite to the movement of the primum mobile, which in that system causes day and night. Therefore it is obvious that if the Sun should cease its own proper motion, the day would become shorter, and not longer. The way to lengthen the day would be to speed up the Sun\x{2019}s proper motion; and to cause the Sun to remain above the horizon for some time in one place without declining towards the west, it would be necessary to hasten this motion until it was equal to that of the primum mobile. This would amount to accelerating the customary speed of the Sun about 360 times. Therefore if Joshua had intended his words to be taken in their pure and proper sense, he would have ordered the Sun to accelerate its own motion in such a way that the impulse from the primum mobile would not carry it westward. But since his words were to be heard by people who very likely knew nothing of any celestial motions beyond the great general movement from east to west, he stooped to their capacity and spoke according to their understanding, as he had no intention of teaching them the arrangement of the spheres, but merely of having them perceive the greatness of the miracle.\x{201d}Galileo next considered the possibility that Joshua meant to halt the primum mobile, and all heavenly movement along with it. \x{201c}And indeed Joshua did intend the whole system of celestial spheres to stand still, as may be deduced from his simultaneous command to the Moon, which had nothing to do with lengthening the day. And under his command to the Moon we are to understand the other planets as well, though they are passed over in silence here as elsewhere in the Bible, which was not written to teach us astronomy.\x{201d}Turning to Copernicus, Galileo reminded Madama Cristina of his own discovery of the Sun\x{2019}s monthly rotation, which he propounded in his 1613 Letters on Sunspots.\x{201c}If we consider the nobility of the Sun, and the fact that it is the font of light which (as I shall conclusively prove) illuminates not only the Moon and the Earth but all the other planets, which are inherently dark, then I believe that it will not be entirely unphilosophical to say that the Sun, as the chief minister of Nature and in a certain sense the heart and soul of the universe, infuses by its own rotation not only light but also motion into other bodies which surround it. And just as if the motion of the heart should cease in an animal, all other motions of its members would also cease, so if the rotation of the Sun were to stop, the rotations of all the planets would stop too.\x{201d}Thus, stopping the Sun sufficed to halt \x{201c}the whole system of the world.\x{201d} All the heavenly revolutions ceased as a result, and \x{201c}day was miraculously prolonged.\x{201d} For emphasis, Galileo pointed out how \x{201c}exquisitely\x{201d} his scenario agreed with \x{201c}the literal sense of the sacred text.\x{201d}Continuing with brio, Galileo brought up the matter of the Sun\x{2019}s having stood still \x{201c}in the midst of the heavens,\x{201d} according to Joshua 10:13, and he elaborated on that point.\x{201c}Grave theologians raise a question about this passage, for it seems very likely that when Joshua requested the lengthening of the day, the Sun was near setting and not at the meridian. \x{2026} For if it had been near the meridian, either it would have been needless to request a miracle, or it would have been sufficient merely to have prayed for some retardation.\x{201d} This conundrum had forced several biblical scholars, named here by Galileo, to equivocate in their interpretation of the phrase \x{201c}in the midst of the heavens.\x{201d} But all inconsistencies vanished \x{201c}if, in agreement with the Copernican system, we place the Sun in the \x{2018}midst\x{2019}\x{2014}that is, in the center\x{2014}of the celestial orbs and planetary rotations, as it is most necessary to do. Then take any hour of the day, either <<noon|13>>, or any hour as close to evening as you please, and the day would be lengthened and all the celestial revolutions stopped by the Sun\x{2019}s standing still in the midst of the heavens; that is, in the center, where it resides.\x{201d}In his enthusiasm for the Copernican system, Galileo apparently forgot that Catholic law forbade such exegesis by a layman. Only the Holy Fathers of the Church were empowered to probe the deep meaning of the Bible. The Protestant Kepler could emulate Luther and reach a personal understanding of Holy Writ in his own country with impunity. But Galileo, according to the decrees of the Council of Trent, issued in 1564, dared not interpret Scripture \x{201c}in any way other than in accordance with the unanimous agreement of the Fathers.\x{201d}The Fathers counted saints and martyrs of old among their number, and also the cardinal inquisitors of Galileo\x{2019}s day, including the pope\x{2019}s Jesuit theological adviser, Roberto Bellarmino, who put down Galileo\x{2019}s arguments with his own authoritative declaration:\x{201c}The words \x{2018}the Sun also riseth and the Sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose, etc.\x{2019} were those of Solomon, who not only spoke by divine inspiration but was a man wise above all others and most learned in human sciences and in the knowledge of all created things, and his wisdom was from God. Thus it is not likely that he would affirm something which was contrary to a truth either already demonstrated, or likely to be demonstrated. And if you tell me that Solomon spoke only according to the appearances, and that it seems to us that the Sun goes around when actually it is the Earth which moves, as it seems to one on a ship that the shore moves away from the ship, I shall answer that though it may appear to a voyager as if the shore were receding from the vessel on which he stands, rather than the vessel from the shore, yet he knows this to be an illusion and is able to correct it because he sees clearly that it is the ship and not the shore that is in movement. But as to the Sun and the Earth, a wise man has no need to correct his judgment, for his experience tells him plainly that the Earth is standing still and that his eyes are not deceived when they report that the Sun, Moon, and stars are in motion.\x{201d}On February 23, 1616, a panel of eleven theologians put the Copernican idea to a vote. They deemed \x{201c}the quiescence of the Sun in the center of the world\x{201d} to be \x{201c}formally heretical\x{201d} because it contradicted Scripture. They further found the heliocentric universe philosophically \x{201c}foolish and absurd.\x{201d} Although the Earth\x{2019}s motion seemed to them an equally ridiculous concept, they declared it merely \x{201c}erroneous in faith,\x{201d} since it did not explicitly deny the truth of Holy Writ. These judgments formed the crux of an official edict issued on March 5, denouncing Copernicus\x{2019}s teachings as \x{201c}false and contrary to Holy Scripture.\x{201d}
On the Revolutions would be named in a decree appended to the Index of Prohibited Books. But instead of being banned and destroyed\x{2014}the fate of other forbidden titles\x{2014}On the Revolutions was to be suspended until corrected. In the decades since its publication, the book had proved so useful that the Church could not justify condemning it outright. Indeed, the much-desired calendar reform that engaged Copernicus during his lifetime had since been implemented with the help of his text. On the Revolutions and the Prutenic Tables provided the mean length of the tropical year and synodic month that enabled the Jesuit Father Christoph Clavius of the Roman College to create the so-called Gregorian calendar, which replaced the Julian in 1582, during the pontificate of Gregory XIII.In 1619 another decree regarding the Index banned Kepler\x{2019}s Epitome of Copernican Astronomy, along with \x{201c}all other works by this author.\x{201d} The following year a further decree enumerated ten specific corrections to be made to On the Revolutions. These few changes\x{2014}only ten points in more than four hundred pages\x{2014}conformed Copernicus\x{2019}s text to Osiander\x{2019}s note. They rephrased every testimony to the Earth\x{2019}s motion so as to sound hypothetical. The censors deleted the part of the preface claiming \x{201c}astronomy is written for astronomers,\x{201d} for they had appropriated the subject to themselves. The line appeared in the paragraph that voiced Copernicus\x{2019}s nightmare vision of \x{201c}babblers who claim to be judges of astronomy although completely ignorant of the subject,\x{201d} who might bend \x{201c}some passage of Scripture to their purpose\x{201d} and bludgeon him with it.It was left to each individual owner of On the Revolutions to insert the specified changes where indicated. Galileo made all of them, perhaps in the belief that his copy might be examined by clerical authorities. He had himself been advised personally by Cardinal Bellarmino, in Rome in 1616, to end his teaching and writing about Copernicus, and he had acquiesced. Several years later, however, in 1624, a seemingly broad-minded new pope, Urban VIII, encouraged Galileo to write a definitive comparison of the Ptolemaic system with the Copernican. This book, Galileo\x{2019}s Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World, published in Florence in 1632, led to immediate accusations of heresy. The formal trial of Galileo by the Inquisition took place the following year, and ended with his abjuration. The Dialogue then joined On the Revolutions on the next Index of Prohibited Books. They both remained listed there\x{2014}the one banned, the other suspended until corrected, both the subjects of continuing controversy and commentary\x{2014}through the ensuing two centuries.",
