Occasionally Mr Bhoolabhoy was detailed to share this bed but had not been the previous night when he had slept in his own room (the old Number Two).

It is typical of you to pretend to have found one error and at the same time overlook a real error \x{2013} the fact that it was on June <<six nineteen|5k:1>> forty-four which was the day of the landings in Normandy that Mabel Layton died on the verandah of Rose Cottage when there was no one in the bungalow except Susan because Miss Batchelor was having tea with Mr Maybrick and Susan went into premature labour as a result and after the baby was born she went off her head too and Minnie had to save the baby from being burned to death, which of course they tried to hush up but we all knew because you can never stop Indian servants gossiping. And Mildred never never forgave poor old Miss Batchelor for not being at Rose Cottage on the one day in years when there was some excuse for her being there at all and she told her to vacate and didn\x{2019}t care that Barbie had nowhere to go, all Mildred was interested in was moving into Rose Cottage at last herself with Susan and Sarah, and you\x{2019}re not going to tell me you don\x{2019}t remember, and don\x{2019}t remember Susan being rude to us at the Church and how you said later that her being rude was probably the first real sign that she was off her rocker and hadn\x{2019}t recovered, but of course you were always making excuses for people like them and pretended not to notice what I had to put up with which I only did because it was my duty to do so although it was a very different matter when they\x{2019}d all gone home, you were free with your criticisms then, Tusker.

At other times a group of them would go back with him and Mr Bhoolabhoy to Smith\x{2019}s.

On Monday he went back to Ranpur on the <<midday|13>> train but had been known to delay his departure if a death seemed imminent. It was not so much a case of his having a nose for death but one for saving church funds: the cost of a sudden trip to Pankot to conduct a funeral service either in the church or in the little chapel attached to the crematorium at the General Hospital which the British had built. In the case of sudden death he could be telephoned in Ranpur at any time of the day or night and had been known more than once to hitch a ride in a military truck coming up on army business.

But Susy was still having to hammer out the hymns on the piano and tune it herself; and the congregation had to be content to celebrate Holy Communion when it suited the Reverend Stephen to officiate, which wasn\x{2019}t often because unlike old Tom Narayan he insisted on doing so no later than <<eight o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>, on an empty stomach, which meant that he could usually conduct the service only at those weekends which brought him up to Pankot on Fridays or Saturdays, weekends which seemed difficult not to connect with the weekends when the Inspector-General of Police in Ranpur came up to play golf; arriving in his official car with the identifying flag fluttering and Mr Ambedkar sitting next to him wearing dark glasses and looking forward to some golf too and to a weekend not at the Menektaras but at the old Flagstaff House where they would both be fellow guests of General Krippalani, the senior officer in the Ranpur area.",

Mr Ambedkar always expressed his understanding of this difficulty but you could see he was a little put out if less than half-a-dozen turned up to kneel at the rail. Before beckoning them forward he rather ostentatiously counted them and then consecrated the requisite number of wafers, and the wine.
