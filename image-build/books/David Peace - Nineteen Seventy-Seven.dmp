So we got the first coach in and she could hardly sit still could Clare. Said she was going to wet herself, she was that excited.

And we met her daughters and her Aunty under the Tower and they were such lovely little things, all red hair and new teeth. <<About four|9:1>> and <<two|20a:1>> I think they must have been.

And we went down on to the sands and it was still quiet, the tide just gone, the beach all engraved ridges and ripples and she took them down to the foam, the surf, and they took off their shoes and socks and kicked through the little waves the three of them, and me and the Aunty we just sat on the wall watching them, the Aunty crying and me too. Then we all five of us went to get ice-cream at some back-street place Clare knew and it was lovely stuff, Italian, and Clare had a Cappuccino with bits of chocolate flake on the top and because I liked look of it so much she bought me one as well as my ice-cream, then we went round some of the arcades and put the little ones on the donkeys even though Clare she thought that it was cruel, keeping the donkeys like they do but it was such a laugh because one of them donkeys he had a mind of his own he did and he sets off with the eldest one on board, sets off at a right pace, and she\x{2019}s loving it the little girl is, laughing her head off, but there\x{2019}s the donkey man and the rest of us chasing them up the beach, caught them in the end but it took some doing and I don\x{2019}t think donkey man thought it was so funny but we were in stitches we were.
