But, it\x{2019}s a party for Christ\x{2019}s sake. Every time I put my drink down on the table, he was either throwing the cup in the trash or shooting me dirty looks for not using a coaster. That boy has got to light-en up! Talk about panties in a wad. What he needs is a good screw. Which leads me to your question. (Nice segue, huh?) As far as the online dating thing goes\x{2026}Yes, you are that desperate. ;) I say give it a try. No harm. No foul. Finlay\x{2019}s right. (Don\x{2019}t tell him those words uttered from my lips \x{2013} or in this case from my fingertips! He would never let me live it down!) You never know what might happen. At the very least, you\x{2019}ll have eligible men taking you to swank restaurants. Hmmm. A whole host of hot and horny single men that I can review, chat with, judge and mock \x{2013} all while sitting in my office looking very busy. Maybe I should give it a try myself. Lunch tomorrow?

As for me, I\x{2019}m originally from Nebraska and have been living in LA for two years. I moved out here to try my luck at movies and ended up doing personal training for celebrities. But I got a bit fed up with the egos. So now I work as a counselor for Outward Adventure programs, which take at-risk youth, corporate teams and others on outdoor adventures. It\x{2019}s great to enjoy the sunshine and see how the challenges of nature and teamwork can change someone\x{2019}s life. When I\x{2019}m not working, I\x{2019}m usually working out, playing sports or taking a bike ride. I\x{2019}m looking for someone who is going to be the perfect compliment to me. Check out my profile and see what you think. Will look forward to hearing back from you.

I think it\x{2019}s just the way he carries himself. True to photo, he was cute, but not overly gorgeous. His smile is a little crooked, but he has the most unbelievable, white teeth I\x{2019}ve ever seen. I was so tempted to ask if they were real, but decided that I didn\x{2019}t want to spoil the illusion if they weren\x{2019}t. Anyway, his hair is a lighter sandy blond than in the photo and it made him kind of look like a professional volleyball player and part-time model for sun tan lotion.",

Now granted, they were there for an exhibition and preparing to dazzle people with their extreme sports capabilities. Lord knows that if you really want to impress people, you've got to jump a BMX bike over a bunch of garbage cans. But still. They walked into an empty room and didn't even acknowledge that it wasn't really empty. I was there. However, it was cool to see Marsh 7. They only showed up for about 20 minutes. They were in a different secure location before their performance...ran to the green room after their set but before their encore. They were basically in their own little world except for Jason Kite, the bass player. He was so nice and asked me who I was and what I was doing there, how things were going, etc. He even asked for my card. Weird, huh?

But, more importantly, I highly doubt that he asked you out as some sort of game or quest. Did you ever, for once, consider the fact that he asked you out because you are smart and beautiful? No, that would likely never occur to you, my self confidence-challenged friend. If I have to remind you one more time that you have got to realize how incredible you are, I'm going to...well, I just don't know what I'm going to do. But, it won't be pretty. Trust me.

            "Well, worst career nightmare. (Honestly, I think I\x{2019}ve already lived through the worst dating nightmares possible!) So, I vowed that in my public relations career, I would never don a mascot costume. I never wanted to be the poor schlub roasting away in a hot mess of fur shaking hands with people at a mall or ballgame. And fortunately for me, during the early years of PR agency life in New York, I escaped mascot duty. I figured that as I moved up the corporate ladder, I would subject interns and other junior staff to this form of professional torture. But my worst nightmare has been realized. Our agency has prepared a game show for a client\x{2019}s sales meeting and one of the team members is sick. So, at the last minute, MY boss has dictated that I have to fly to Minneapolis (no, that\x{2019}s not the nightmare part, but it\x{2019}s close!) to play the role of Spamma White, game show hostess. Someone else will be portraying Pat Laidback, game show host. I need to wear an old bridesmaid\x{2019}s dress they found at a resale shop, smile incessantly and hand out Rice \x{2018}a Roni as consolation prizes to people who get the answers wrong.

There's only one restaurant (5 stars!) on the island and no telephones or TVs. There is one highly-rated spa and you're set for a day of pampering. I've also arranged for us to get a boat ride to a small private stretch of beach where we will dine on a picnic lunch and a bottle of wine. Aside from that, we'll lounge, hike, relax, read and other things people typically do on their honeymoons. So?
