The Manty public, on the other hand, started the war terrified of how it might end, only to have its confidence shoot up like a counter-grav shuttle. As far as their man-in-the-street could see, they beat the snot out of us for <<three of four|10>> T-years without even working up a good sweat, and there didn\x{2019}t seem to be very much we could do to stop them.",

That being the case, she\x{2019}d decided to keep the position in the family, as it were, and selected Miranda\x{2019}s cousin Jennifer for the role. Jennifer was more than ten years younger than Miranda. Indeed, at <<twenty-six|9:0>> T-years she\x{2019}d received the original, first-generation prolong treatments, which Miranda had been just too old to physically accept when Grayson joined the Manticoran Alliance, but she shared a great deal of her cousin\x{2019}s quietly determined, competent personality. She looked a lot like Miranda and Andrew, as well, with the same auburn hair, although her eyes were green, not gray, and she was a bit taller than Miranda.",

He had to be careful how he spread those funds around lest too much money in any one spot get questions asked, but it freed up his legitimate contributions enormously. It was too early yet to predict the full impact of the media blitz he and his fellows were planning, but so far their closely coordinating candidates were on a pace to outspend their less organized opponents by a margin of <<almost two to one|10>>.",

The tall (for a Grayson; she was only of middling height by Manticoran standards), attractive, willowy brunette was nineteen T-years old. That meant she\x{2019}d been <<around eight|3b>> when Honor first visited Grayson, and from the taste of the young woman\x{2019}s emotions, it was obvious she\x{2019}d been smitten with a severe case of hero worship for one Commander Harrington. Some of that still lingered, though it had eased with time and she had it under firm enough control that no one who lacked Honor\x{2019}s special advantages would have known it was there. What had not eased with time was the fact that she\x{2019}d been Navy mad from the moment she stood one night on a balcony of Owens House, watching the terrible, pinprick flashes of nuclear warheads glare defiantly in the endless depths of space, and known a single, brutally outmatched heavy cruiser was locked in a death duel with a battlecruiser full of fanatics in defense of her planet and all its people.",

Allowing for the apparent efficiency of the Manties\x{2019} new inertial compensators, that was about right for an SD with pods deployed outside her wedge. So if the Manties were dropping their accel now, that would indicate they were, indeed, deploying their pods. But it also meant none of their light units had full pod loads. They couldn\x{2019}t have, because, unlike superdreadnoughts, they lacked the tractor capacity and room to tow full loads inside their wedges, which meant they couldn\x{2019}t have stayed with the ships of the wall on the approach run. And since Tactical reported that his ships of the wall outnumbered the Manties by <<almost three to one|10>> and his screening elements were towing full pod loads, it looked like things were about to get messy for the Manty CO.",

Groenewold lost five of the wall, with two more damaged badly enough to require yard repairs. Giscard lost another at Treadway, with two more headed for the yard. Tourville didn\x{2019}t lose any outright at Solway, but he still has at least one that\x{2019}s going to have to head for the yard, and from my reading of his initial report, that may go up to four for him, too, once he has a chance for complete damage surveys. That\x{2019}s six completely destroyed, and from <<five to eight|10a:0>> down for repairs, and that makes a minimum total of eleven and possibly as many as fourteen. So even if we take two full squadrons away from Theisman, Twelfth Fleet\x{2019}s order of battle will only be back to where it was before Scylla, and we need more than that if Bagration\x{2019}s going to be a serious offensive.\x{201d}",
