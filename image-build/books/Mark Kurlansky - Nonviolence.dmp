            "Islam, an unusually open faith whose early adherents came from many backgrounds, including Judaism, began to change <<after 622|18:0>>, when Mohammed and his followers moved from Mecca to Yathrib, a town 250 miles to the north, which was renamed al-Medinah\x{2014}the city. One of the most bitter disappointments of Mohammed's life was that the Jews of Medina, apparently more tradition-bound than those he had known before, refused to accept him as a prophet. At this point Jewish prophecy was already several thousand years old and they viewed a man who claimed to get messages from God with the same suspicion that most people today would. Mohammed physically turned the prayer meeting around so that worshipers now faced Mecca rather than Jerusalem.",

It attracted both critics and admirers, and out of it came a circle of like-minded people who became the New York Peace Society, which was formed at the time of the outbreak of the War of 1812. But Dodge and his peace group, respecting the moment of silence in order to avoid the accusation of disloyalty, postponed official formation and publication of his tract against the war, War Inconsistent with the Religion of Jesus Christ, until <<1815|9n:0>>, when the war was over.',

Those who denounced the war could be sentenced to as much as twenty-five years in prison, yet 142 were sentenced for life and 17 were sentenced to death, though the executions were never carried out. Many thousands were so badly beaten and abused in prison in attempts to force them to change their stance, that at the end of the war only 4,000, about a third of the men who had said they would not serve, remained hard-and-fast conscientious objectors. The government allowed gangs to beat and even tar and feather war resisters and force them to kiss the flag. The American press, like that in Britain, belittled war resisters.

The claim often made by German citizens, by the populations of Britain and America including Jews, and by the British and American governments that they didn\'t know what was happening is simply not true. The very efficient code decipherers of British intelligence were reading reports from death camps at least as early as 1943. They may have intercepted messages earlier, but documents confirming this are still not available. But it is known that they listened in on conversations about the unsatisfactorily slow killing rate at Auschwitz. A Polish agent, Tadeusz Chciuk-Celt, parachuted into Poland in 1942 and reported back on the killing. Also in 1942 the Polish underground reported on the mass extermination of Jews. In 1943, the Polish government in exile in London urged the British to bomb Auschwitz, where Polish political prisoners were being killed. In any event, by <<1944|9n:1>> escaped Auschwitz inmates had told the world exactly what was taking place there.',

It is an emotionally moving though legally and morally irrelevant argument that these are small numbers for a people who exterminated six million in death camps. Of course, at the time, that argument was not even being made. In late 1940 the Germans bombed Coventry from <<seven in the evening|5>> until <<past six|9h>> the following morning. Six hundred residents and a fourteenth-century cathedral were destroyed. Now British Bomber Command was given instructions to retaliate on German cities, and the targets would be the center of the city. In 1942 they were specifically told not to aim for military targets, such as aircraft factories and shipyards, but at densely populated areas, since the goal was to destroy the population\'s morale, which had also been Germany\'s goal in Coventry. With demoralization in mind, working-class districts in particular were to be sought out.',
