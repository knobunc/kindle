            'It was <<1951|9d>> and I was eight when I saw the farm and the future in this way. That was the year my father bought his first car, a Buick sedan with prickly gray velvet seats, so rounded and slick that it was easy to slide off the backseat into the footwell when we went over a stiff bump or around a sharp corner. That was also the year my sister Caroline was born, which was undoubtedly the reason my father bought the car. The Ericson children and the Clark children continued to ride in the back of the farm pickup, but the Cook children kicked their toes against a front seat and stared out the back windows, nicely protected from the dust. The car was the exact measure of six hundred forty acres compared to three hundred or five hundred.',

            "On Valentine\x{2019}s Day, my sister Rose had been diagnosed with breast cancer. She was thirty-four. Her mastectomy and ensuing chemotherapy had left her weak and anxious. All through the gloomiest March and April in years, I was cooking for three households\x{2014}for my father, who insisted on living alone in our old farmhouse, for Rose and her husband, Pete, in their house across the road from Daddy, and also for my husband, Tyler, and myself. We lived where the Ericsons once had, actually. I\x{2019}d been able to consolidate dinner, and sometimes supper, depending on how Rose was feeling, but breakfast had to be served in each kitchen. My morning at the stove started before <<five|9c:0>> and didn\x{2019}t end until <<eight-thirty|9f>>.",

The bed had been slept on, rather than in, and my father had gone out in shoes\x{2014}his boots by the back door were the reason I thought he was still in bed. Beside the barn, the truck was cold to the touch, and I was just going over to see if he\x{2019}d dropped in on Rose and Caroline when a big maroon Pontiac pulled into the yard. My father got out of the passenger side, and Marv Carson got out of the driver\x{2019}s side. Marv looked groggy but willing, already decked out in suit and tie. He scurried eagerly in my father\x{2019}s footsteps as they came toward the porch. My father said, \x{201c}Ginny, Marv\x{2019}ll be eating. Marv, go wash up, now.\x{201d} Marv looked around as he stepped through the door, for a sink, I suppose. I said, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sure you\x{2019}re clean enough to eat, Marv.

Her images, partly memories of her, partly memories of photos I had seen of her, yielded no new answers to old mysteries. For a moment I toyed with a magic solution\x{2014}that Rose, in herself, in her reincarnation of our mother, would speak, or act out, the answers. All I had to do was be mindful of the relationship between them (mindful in secret, in a way no one else could be mindful), and gather up the answers, glean the apparently harvested field for overlooked bits. But no. There could be a quest\x{2014}I might go around to people we knew, or who had known her, and ask them about her. I could, maybe, call her brother in Arizona or New Mexico, if he was still alive, if someone dimly remembered the town he used to live in. I could ask my father about her. I could become her biographer, be drawn into her life, and into excuses for her or blame of her, but that seemed like an impractical, laborious, and failing substitute for what I had missed in the last twenty-two years. I was, after all, my father\x{2019}s daughter, and I automatically did believe in the unbroken surface of the unsaid. <<After seven|9:0>> laps, I hauled myself out of the water and sat in the hot wind.

I sterilized the jars in the pressure canner, reflecting that poisoning by botulism was theoretically possible, but probably not with someone as sophisticated about that sort of danger as Rose. These sausages and kraut would be cooked at a temperature above 212 degrees for more than fifteen minutes for sure. The orderly progress of cooking something put me in the usual serene mood. I was finished and cleaned up by two. At <<five-thirty|5b>>, I carried a box of twelve full jars down the road to Rose\x{2019}s. It was hot and dusty. Rose was in the kitchen frying hamburgers.",

Caroline, Ken, and Daddy made their slow way down the aisle toward the door. Daddy was saying, \x{201c}She was the littlest thing. Little knobby knees.

When it came right down to building something on what we had, it scared him to build on death and bad luck and anger and destruction. Listen to this. One night he was late for dinner. It was a complicated squash soup that we\x{2019}d made together, and he didn\x{2019}t get home till <<eight|9f>>, and I was annoyed, but I didn\x{2019}t think that much of it, until he started acting sheepish and guilty. Well, it turned out he\x{2019}d been to see Harold! Those old ladies had made a big deal out of it, and Harold had been nice to him, and after that it was just like watching your lover go back to his wife. Whatever you have, however passionately you want it and he seems to want it, what he wants more and more is to fit in and be a good boy. Then everything he feels for you feels wrong to him. The stronger he feels it, the more wrong it feels, and he starts repudiating stuff. A while later we got this material in the mail about green manures, and he came in and saw it and didn\x{2019}t open it, and I knew that was it, and it was. He packed up ten days later and left without saying exactly where he was going, and it turned out he\x{2019}d gone to stay a week with Harold before going back to Seattle. I\x{2019}m sure Vancouver\x{2019}s the perfect place for him.
