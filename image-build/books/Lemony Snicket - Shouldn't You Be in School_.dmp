            "I slid in and squinted out the window of the roadster. The sun told me that it was <<about noon|13>>. It also told me that it was going to continue to beat down on Stain\x{2019}d-by-the-Sea and make it blazing hot and that there was no point in arguing with it, because it was the sun and I was a boy of about thirteen. The sun was right. There was no point in arguing. The roadster puttered us through Stain\x{2019}d-by-the-Sea, and I didn\x{2019}t say anything more to Theodora. She called herself an intrepid personage and said that was an expression which there meant an excellent investigator, and I didn\x{2019}t correct her. She called me ungrateful and I didn\x{2019}t disagree. I just sat in the heat and wished for an ice cream cone. Nobody brought me one. Maybe Harold Limetta has a freezer full of the stuff, I told myself. Peppermint ice cream in particular would really hit the spot.",

            "The hallways of the Wade Academy were tricky for sneaking, but I\x{2019}d had a very demanding sneaking instructor. Our final exam began early in the morning, with our instructor entering a small cabin in the middle of the woods and sitting blindfolded in a folding chair. The woods were full of crackly dead leaves, and the floor of the cabin was covered in fragile glass figurines. To pass the class we had to sneak up on him by <<midnight|13>>. When he arrived at the cabin that morning, the entire class was waiting for him. I\x{2019}d snuck into his office the night before and shared the location of the cabin with the rest of the students so we could sneak up on him before he even arrived. I received the top grade in the class and a three-month suspension.",
