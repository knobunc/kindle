            "Later generations of mathematicians found flaws in Euclid\x{2019}s presentation (additional unstated assumptions, such as \x{201c}if a line passes through one side of a triangle, then it will meet another side if sufficiently extended\x{201d}). In his Grundlagen der Geometrie  (Foundations of Geometry) of 1899, the German mathematician David Hilbert (1862\x{2013}1943) wrote down a system of axioms (this system was repeatedly revised\x{2014}there were twenty axioms in the seventh edition of 1930) and derived Euclid\x{2019}s geometry from them in full logical rigor. Nonetheless, Euclid did an amazingly good job for 300 B.C. In particular, he saw the need for his infamous Parallel Axiom (axiom 5): \x{201c}If a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side where the angles are less than two right angles.\x{201d} (See Figure 3.) Euclid\x{2019}s Parallel Axiom is logically equivalent to the following one, which is simpler-looking, though still complicated: \x{201c}Given a line, and any point not on that line, there exists one and only one line parallel to the given line and passing through the given point.\x{201d} This reformulation is generally known as Playfair\x{2019}s Axiom, after the English mathematician John Playfair (1748\x{2013}1819), who stated it in 1795, but in fact it was known to Proclus (410\x{2013}485), a Greek commentator on Euclid. For most of the next 2,000 years, many people thought that the Parallel Axiom was superfluous and tried to deduce it from the other four. Only <<around 1830|9w>> did the invention of non-Euclidean geometry prove that no such deduction is possible and that Euclid had done the right thing after all. Non-Euclidean geometry has a long and complex history and prehistory, but the definitive breakthrough stemmed from the work of three mathematicians:",

            "2 This is Abbott the schoolmaster, with an image straight out of the pages (literally) of Euclid. In Victorian times, \x{201c}geometry\x{201d} in school-level education followed closely the simpler parts of Euclid\x{2019}s Elements.  Anyone who had taken geometry lessons at school would instantly be familiar with the flat world of a sheet of paper, populated by geometric figures. The only extra leap of imagination required was to animate those figures and endow them with human characteristics. The archives of the City of London School contain two old geometry texts. One is J. R. Young\x{2019}s Euclid\x{2019}s Elements, Chiefly from the Texts  of Simson and Playfair, with Corrections (Souter, London 1839); the other is Euclidian Geometry by Francis Cuthbertson (Macmillan, London 1874). A note by Terry Heard, former head of mathematics at the City of London School, states that Young\x{2019}s book was used to teach geometry in the school <<around 1840|18:0>>, and the second was written by a former second master of the school. Indeed, Cuthbertson held that post from 1856 until his death in 1889 and was by all accounts a thoroughly normal and decent man, unlike his predecessor, the clever but crazy Edkins. Euclid\x{2019}s Proposition 46: On a given straight line to  describe a square, also appears as Proposition 46 in Young\x{2019}s book (which shows just how closely the textbooks followed Euclid), but it has become Problem K in Cuthbertson\x{2019}s.

            "4 If a triangle (or other connected two-dimensional plane figure) is projected parallel to the containing plane, the result is a line segment. Projection in any other direction preserves the dimension and results in a distorted two-dimensional shape. In fractal geometry, it can be proved that \x{201c}almost all\x{201d} projections preserve the dimension of a figure; that is, projections that do not preserve dimension satisfy a special condition that is rarely valid (such as \x{201c}being parallel to the plane of the figure\x{201d}). On the other hand, projections in different directions are essentially independent of each other. One consequence of this independence is the existence of a \x{201c}digital sundial\x{201d}: a mathematical shape whose shadow on the ground, as the sun moves across the sky, tells the time in digital form.

            "Why do we get ourselves into this kind of muddle? All calendric systems are compromises because the rotational period of the Earth (\x{201c}day\x{201d}) is not some simple fraction of its period of revolution around the sun (\x{201c}year\x{201d}). Moreover, the period of revolution of the moon around the Earth (\x{201c}month\x{201d}) is commensurate with neither. The calendar that is now used worldwide for civil purposes\x{2014}though many nations retain different calendars for religious purposes\x{2014}evolved from the Roman calendar. The Roman calendar was based on the phases of the moon, and it quickly got out of step with the seasons, which depend on the Earth\x{2019}s position relative to the sun. The Roman calendar in effect adopted a year that on average was 3661/4 days long\x{2014}one day too many\x{2014}and by 50 B.C., spring had slipped 8 weeks and was starting in May. Julius Caesar (100? B.C.\x{2013}44 B.C.) asked the Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes (flourished 50 B.C.) for advice, and he suggested switching to the Egyptian year of 3651/4 days. To return the seasons to their rightful places, the year 46 B.C. was accorded 445 days. To deal with that awkward 1/4 day, Sosigenes proposed to have a normal year that lasted 365 days but to add an extra \x{201c}leap\x{201d} day every fourth year (that extra day is now February 29, but originally it fell between February 23 and 24). In 44 B.C. further minor changes to the lengths of the months were made by Augustus Caesar (63 B.C.\x{2013}A.D. 14), but this \x{201c}Julian calendar\x{201d} served humanity well for 1,500 years. However, the tropical year is actually 365.242199 days, not 365.25\x{2014}an error of 11 minutes 14 seconds per year. By <<1545|9:1>> the vernal equinox (the beginning of spring, used to work out the date of Easter) was wrong by 10 days, and the Council of Trent authorized Pope Paul III (1468\x{2013}1549) to put matters right. Various remedies were proposed, but no action was taken until Pope Gregory XIII (1502\x{2013}1585) was elected in 1572. Then the astronomer and Euclidean commentator Christopher Clavius (1537\x{2013} 1612) drafted a papal bull based on ideas of the astronomer Luigi Lilio. The bull, which appeared in 1582, assumed a year of 365.2422 days and adjusted the calendar by omitting leap years in all years that are multiples of 100, except that multiples of 400 remain leap years (as, for example, was the case in A.D. 2000). Ten days were omitted to return the vernal equinox to its correct position. The resulting \x{201c}Gregorian calendar\x{201d} is the one we use today. By the time it was introduced into England, 11 days had to be omitted, giving rise to the famous cries of \x{201c}give us back our eleven days!\x{201d} This complaint made more sense than it seems because payment of taxes depended on the boundaries between months.",

            "It is the third daughter, Alicia (generally known as Alice), who provides the strongest mathematical link to Flatland\x{2014}not by influencing its writing but by developing Hinton\x{2019}s ideas, upon which it seems clear that Flatland was based, into serious mathematics. Alicia possessed remarkable innate mathematical talents (her father died when she was four, so his possible influence as a teacher can be ruled out). At a time when women were actively discouraged from taking up mathematics, Alice studied Euclid. At the age of eighteen she became entranced by C. H. Hinton\x{2019}s tiny wooden cubes. She failed to share his fascination with the mystical aspects of the fourth dimension but found its geometry fascinating. She developed Hinton\x{2019}s methods (series of three-dimensional sections) and introduced the name polytope for a multidimensional solid. By purely geometric reasoning, she discovered that there are exactly six regular four-dimensional poly-topes, formed from <<5|9c:0>>, 16, or 600 tetrahedra, 8 cubes, 24 octahedra, or 120 dodecahedra. She built beautiful cardboard models of their three-dimensional sections but then abandoned mathematics in 1890 to marry Walter Stott. The story might have ended there, but <<around 1900|18:0>> she came across a paper by Peiter Hendrik Schoute (1846\x{2013}1923) of Gronin-gen University, who had obtained exactly the same results by purely analytic methods. Schoute encouraged her to publish her work, which she did in 1900 and 1910, and they collaborated until his death in 1913. In 1930 her nephew G. I. Taylor introduced her to the geometer H(arold) S(cott) M(acdonald) Coxeter (1907\x{2013} ), who rekindled her interest in fourdimensional  polytopes and described her work in his Regular Polytopes (1948, 2nd ed. 1963).",

These numbers show that not all properties of n-dimensional space can be found by simple analogies with space of two and three dimensions. More strongly, they hint at a fact that mathematicians have come to expect: Each dimension of space has its own special features, unlike any other dimension.

            "Speculative societies were especially common in Victorian times, when many of the ideas that shaped today\x{2019}s Western world first emerged. There were philosophical societies, societies devoted to the occult, and\x{2014}especially\x{2014}societies devoted to spiritualism. Spiritualists believe that the dead can communicate with the living, usually via a medium in a state of trance. Their belief system originated in the United States in 1848, in what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859\x{2013}1930) later called the Hydesville Episode. Hydesville was the location of a two-room farmhouse in New York state belonging to the Fox family. Strange raps at night had disturbed previous occupants, and \x{201c}a shower of bumps and raps\x{201d} occurred over several nights\x{2014}always near the Foxes\x{2019} daughters, eleven-year-old Katie (Katherine) and fourteen-year-old Maggie (Margaretta). Mrs. Fox had proved to her own satisfaction that the noises were made by a spirit: If she snapped her fingers once or did so twice, she elicited the same number of raps in reply. The unseen force could even answer questions: one rap for \x{201c}no,\x{201d} two for \x{201c}yes.\x{201d} Mrs. Fox attributed these phenomena to a spirit, and by <<1850|9u>> she and her daughters were demonstrating their skills to the public as mediums. The practice of holding s\x{e9}ances (meetings of small groups that revolved around a medium) to communicate with the spirits of the departed spread rapidly, and it became a popular pastime in Victorian England. Around 1890, Maggie Fox confessed that the whole thing had been a childish prank, a hoax perpetrated on her mother via an apple tied to a string. Later she withdrew the confession, but in any case it had had no effect at all on the spiritualist movement.",

It followed that the question \x{201c}Do higher dimensions exist?\x{201d} was meaningless until one decided what one meant by mathematical existence. And whatever that is (which is still a major debating point), it has nothing to do with physical reality.",

            "Also <<around 1900|18:1>>, Sylvester\x{2019}s predictions were coming true. There was an explosion of mathematical and physical areas in which concepts of multidimensional space were making a serious impact. One was relativity, which is best considered a special kind of four-dimensional space-time geometry. As formulated by Minkowski in 1908, the three spatial coordinates (x, y, z), together with time t , form a four-dimensional space-time with coordinates (x, y, z, t ). Any such \x{201c}point\x{201d} is called an event: It is like a point particle that winks into existence at just one moment in time and then winks out again. Relativity is really about the physics of events. In traditional mechanics, a particle moving through space occupies coordinates (x (t ), y (t ), z (t )) at time t, and this position changes as time passes. From Minkowski\x{2019}s space-time viewpoint, the collection of all such points is a curve in space-time, the world line of the particle. The most important new ingredient in relativity is that the appropriate measure of \x{201c}distance\x{201d} is not",

            "By <<1920|9:0>> this concurrence of physics, mathematics, and mechanics had carried the day, and the use of geometric language for many-variable problems\x{2014} multidimensional geometry\x{2014}had ceased to raise eyebrows, except perhaps among philosophers. By <<1950|9:0>> the mathematicians\x{2019} natural tendency was to formulate everything in n dimensions from the beginning. Limiting your theories to two or three dimensions seemed old-fashioned and ridiculously confining. The language of higher-dimensional space permeated every area of science and even invaded such subjects as economics and genetics. Today\x{2019}s virologists, for instance, think of viruses as \x{201c}points\x{201d} in a space of DNA sequences that could easily have several hundred dimensions. What they mean by this, fundamentally, is that the genomes of these viruses are several hundred DNA bases long, but the geometric image goes beyond mere metaphor. It provides an effective way to think about the problem. Let\x{2019}s see how.",

            "To illustrate the value of geometric imagery, let\x{2019}s see whether we can gain some insight into the enormous variability of viruses. They mutate very frequently, and most viruses occur in a wide variety of different forms. Where does all this variety come from? We\x{2019}ve just seen that a single mutation in a virus\x{2019}s DNA leads to a neighboring sequence in the supercube, so with just one point mutation, a virus can change into any of its potential neighbors. Therefore, each virus\x{2019}s DNA sequence sits at the center of a \x{201c}sphere\x{201d} of unit radius, and everything else inside that sphere corresponds to a neighboring DNA sequence. In order to understand the enormous potential for variability in virus DNA, all we need to observe is that such a sphere is very large, even though its radius is unity. The \x{201c}hyper-volume\x{201d} of a hypersphere grows extremely rapidly as the number of dimensions of the space increases. For example, in a virus with a DNA sequence 200 bases long, which is relatively short, the sphere of neighbors of radius 10, say\x{2014}that is, up to ten point mutations\x{2014}contains <<approximately 1023|18:0>> sequences, which is gigantic.",
