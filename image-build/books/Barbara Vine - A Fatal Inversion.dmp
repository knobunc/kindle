Her exposed skin, of which there was a good deal, was a uniform pale biscuit color and her hair was this color, too, and her eyebrows and her lips. Her eyes themselves were a little darker, the color, he thought, as she approached the cage, of milkless tea. A good tea, Earl Grey perhaps. She looked at him gravely and then she smiled, showing small, very white teeth. Adam thought he had never seen such a small girl with such long legs. There was a slight but attractive disproportion here, so that for a moment Zosie seemed less like a real girl than some artist\x{2019}s impression of an ideal, the legs longer, the neck more fragile and attenuated, the waist extravagantly narrower than could have been in nature.",

            "THE PICTURE, VERY LIKE the one Rufus Fletcher had taken in the summer of 1976, occupied the screen for about fifteen seconds. The whole item was allowed no more than four times that in the BBC\x{2019}s Sunday evening news broadcast at <<6:30|2>>. The other forty-five seconds were taken up by a policeman talking to a reporter about having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest. But Shiva and Lili Manjusri saw the picture and so did Rufus Fletcher. Adam Verne-Smith, unwinding in Puerto de la Cruz, did not, of course, see it. He did not even see an English newspaper. They were expensive to buy and came a day late. He did not want to be reminded of home, and the only paper he even glanced at was the International Herald Tribune, a copy of which Anne found on the beach.",

            "It was a continual source of irritation to Lewis that Adam did not show more respect and deference to Hilbert. The boy was offhand and always trying to be clever. He called his great-uncle by his Christian name with no title and did not jump to his feet when the old man entered the room. Lewis pressed Adam to accompany him on those solicitous weekend visits but Adam nearly always said he was too busy or would be bored. There had in fact been only one occasion during those last years that Lewis could remember, and he was sure Adam had only gone because there had been a promise of some shooting. The visit had been far from successful, for Adam had sulked when offered the <<four-ten|5k:0>>, the so-called \x{201c}lady\x{2019}s gun.\x{201d} Sometimes, since then, Lewis had wondered what would have happened if Adam had obeyed him and been kind and polite to the perverse old man. Would Hilbert have left his property to Bridget perhaps or even to the Law Society?",

Once, in a fit of temper, he had told her she only started doing it after they were married. If he had heard her do that in their single days, he would never have married her. But now, the soft clicks coming with typical irregularity, he listened to them painfully and let his mind slide back ten years to what he must remember, to the truth he must recall if he were going to be able to tell lies. He lay still with his eyes open, staring into the darkness that was only half-darkness because this was London and not Suffolk, where on moonless nights the small hours were black as velvet. Click, pause, click, a long silence. At last it had been cold enough to need a blanket and a quilt, to hold Zosie in his arms without the sweat pouring off them both. For a long time that night, too, he had not slept, had lain thinking, wondering what to do, listening to the delicate sounds like tiny bubbles breaking\x{2014}and then hearing them no more.",

The hands had stopped at <<five to four|10>>. Between the block and the house you could just see the walls of the walled garden, flint-built, crossed and coped with brickwork.

Adam looked back at the house, at the honeysuckle that curtained the back of it in yellow and pink, at the martins, sharp-pinioned, that wheeled in and out from the eaves. He was in a state of tremulous excitement. He seemed only to be able to breathe shallowly. It was curiously sexual, this feeling, exactly the way he had once or twice felt with a girl he was mad to make love to and who he thought would let him but was not quite sure, not absolutely sure. The slightest thing would turn his fortune, snatch it, send him home frustrated, bitter, in a sick rage. He felt like that now. If only he could breathe properly! And here was the finest country air, transparent, sparkling sun, the distant low hills and soft basking meadows half-hidden by the blue haze of <<noon|13>>.',

What they had eventually decided to sell before they went to bed that night (or the following morning really) were Great-Uncle Hilbert\x{2019}s dozen Waterford sherry glasses. As Adam said, none of them drank sherry and he didn\x{2019}t know anyone under fifty who did. Having wandered all over the house, they had ended up in the dining room, where the cabinet full of glass was. In another cupboard they found half a bottle of whiskey and a dribble of brandy in the bottom of a Courvoisier bottle. There had been something extraordinarily delightful and exhilarating about sitting at that big oval mahogany table drinking whiskey at <<two o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>. The moon had come up and laid a greenish iridescence on the surface of the lake. It was so bright it made the stars disappear. They had to close the window because of the insects. Then they turned out the lights, the great brass chandelier with its false candles, and the moon\x{2019}s lemony radiance lay as still as cloths draped over the shining wood. Adam set the twelve sherry glasses that were cut in a Greek key pattern around their rims in the middle of the moonlight and said he would put them in a box tomorrow and try to sell them in Sudbury to the man who had the antique shop in Gainsborough Street that they had passed.",

He had no intention, he said, of being part of a permanent commune, he had his medical degree to get, but he might think of coming there for his holidays.
