            "But it wasn\x{2019}t necessary. Starting in the eighteenth century, at <<nine o\x{2019}clock at night|6>> at the fortifications of La Caba\x{f1}a, a cannon was fired and the gates were closed. You could stay out all night in Havana. Many did. But once the cannon fired, no one could enter or leave the city until morning. Today there is no more wall, no more gates, but the cannon at the harbor entrance is still fired at <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>> every night by a contingent of soldiers in eighteenth-century uniforms, accompanied by a drum roll, to remind people of how insular life in the capital still is.",

            "These are also the first words of one of the most popular Cuban songs ever written, \x{201c}Gu\x{e1}ntanamera.\x{201d} The song\x{2019}s popularity is surprising, given that no one is exactly sure what it is about, though it clearly has nothing to do with Jos\x{e9} Mart\x{ed}. It seems to be about unrequited love for a woman from Guant\x{e1}namo. It was written by a popular songwriter, Jose\x{ed}to Fern\x{e1}ndez Diaz, probably <<around 1929|18:0>>. In the 1940s, he had a radio program called La Gu\x{e1}ntanama, in which he used the song to introduce each segment. He gave various explanations for who the peasant woman from Guant\x{e1}namo was. \x{201c}Guajira Gu\x{e1}ntanamera,\x{201d} the chorus refrain, means a folk song from Guant\x{e1}namo, but Fern\x{e1}ndez never explained what Jos\x{e9} Mart\x{ed} or his poem had to do with this. Many believe that Fern\x{e1}ndez could not explain the lyrics well because he didn\x{2019}t actually write them, that they were written instead by noted Spanish-born Cuban classical composer Jul\x{ed}an Orb\x{f3}n. It was Orb\x{f3}n who gave the song to Pete Seeger in a version that included even more Mart\x{ed} verses, and that is the version Seeger popularized in America in the 1960s.",

And <<after 1959|9e:1>>, when Fidel Castro started trying to change this American-built, not to mention American-controlled, society, they were the ones with the most to lose, and the first to leave. By the mid-1970s there weren\x{2019}t many Americanized Cubans left in Havana.",

            "The Malec\x{f3}n completely changed Havana\x{2019}s perspective. Until its construction, Havana was a city on the bay. Once the Malec\x{f3}n was built, Habaneros turned their heads from the bay to the ocean. Havana became a city on the sea, on the Atlantic, the Straits, facing the Gulf Stream\x{2014}the city to which Hemingway was drawn. The Malec\x{f3}n is still a favorite spot\x{2014}the place to go fishing, the place for lovers to walk along while listening to a rumbling sea or to embrace in the shadows, the place to pick out a tune on a guitar at night, the only place in Havana with Atlantic breezes on a relentlessly broiling day, the place to cool off at nighttime, the place to take refuge behind the endless columns of the buildings along the boulevard, the place to face the sea where the ocean runs a bit wild and whitecaps lap and splash over the edge of the road. It was thrilling to drive past the waves. As Cabrera Infante wrote in his novel Three Trapped Tigers, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m only saying for the benefit of those who have never traveled in a convertible along the Malec\x{f3}n between <<five|90>> and <<seven in the afternoon|5>> or rather evening on August 11, 1958, at sixty or eighty miles an hour: such privilege, such exaltation, such euphoria .\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d}",

I quickly realized that this was not about falling asleep on Fidel, but I never found out what it was about.

            "Jews have a long history in Cuba, and particularly in Havana\x{2014}especially long if it is true, as is believed, that Columbus\x{2019}s crew included Jews escaping Spanish persecution and passing themselves off as Christians. In Havana, Jews are called polacos. Nobody knows why, since the name appears to predate immigration from Poland and the community has always had a large Sephardic component from Brazil and Turkey, among other places. Nobody knows why Americans are called yumas, either. Some Americans suggest it is from the 1957 Van Heflin/Glenn Ford film <<3:10|2>> to Yuma, based on an Elmore Leonard story, but I have never met anyone in Havana who has even heard of this movie. Then, too, why are all Spaniards in Cuba called gallegos, meaning the people who come from Spain\x{2019}s northwest province of Galicia, when gallegos are only one of several Iberian populations on the island? And why are Italians amicis? And why is a blonde woman a negrita, though she is the opposite? All of these have come about for the same reason: Habaneros love nicknames, and they use them without rancor, prejudice, or logic.",

The use of the word \x{201c}son\x{201d} was by then already quite well established.

By <<1933|9:0>> Cuba had sixty-two radio stations, most of them in Havana and backed by Americans; this was more than any country in Latin America had. The Americans who created these stations imagined them playing classical music, which had a following in Cuba, home to world-class musicians and composers. But popular music, especially son, took over the airwaves.',
