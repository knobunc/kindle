            "Discovered in 1739, the island is so isolated that it was accidentally \x{201c}lost\x{201d} for nearly 70 years. No one actually set foot on Bouvet until <<1927|9c:0>>, when a group of Norwegians scrambled up its glacial cliffs. In 1964, an abandoned lifeboat with no national markings was discovered on the island. From the supplies spread about, it was clear someone had been there, yet ships did not normally come within 1,000 miles (1,609 km) of Bouvet, and the lifeboat was equipped only with oars and no mast. Despite a search, no bodies or tracks were found. As of today, fewer than a hundred people have ever set foot on the island\x{2014}not counting whoever was in that lifeboat.",
