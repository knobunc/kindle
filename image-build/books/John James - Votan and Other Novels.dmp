            "That was the end of the Savages, men, women, and, if there were any, children too, though I never heard one of them speak, or even saw them move, except the old man, and he was no loss to us. A meal we got out of it, a snack rather, for the <<noon|13>> halt, for a young ox, half starved, and three little pigs fed no better will hardly give a mouthful between fifty men. And we got out of it some iron, and the hide of the ox would cover a shield for someone, and the pigskin would give a pair of shoes for riding. And there was enough tallow for a night\x{2019}s candles in Mynydog\x{2019}s Hall, and clothes to give away to the farmers we passed on the way back. And best of all, the Savages were gone with the ebb, drowned, or burnt before, and not to come in again till the next high tide. But by then we would be gone, too, dancing around the fires in a farmyard, and flirting with the girls for whose safety we had gone to war. We at least left the beach clear, the ashes buried, the sand swept over all.",

Mail is too heavy to wear without cause, unless you are fighting or on parade. Our helmets we could sling at our saddles. While our horses cropped the grass, we filled the helms with the ripening whinberries: the blackberries were still red.',

They would awake, and without a word would form up as if to advance, and, instead, would march the other way, into the North. Other companies, regiments, turned back at the <<noon|13>> halts, or even in the middle of the morning. Always they took the beasts they had driven so far. What they told the farmers they repassed I cannot think. What they told Mynydog I do not care.",

We might easily have made Eudav\x{2019}s Hall before the evening, but <<a little after noon|13>>, the flank guard on the right sighted a whole herd of deer, and a squadron went off on to the hunt. They cast round up-wind of them, and drove the whole herd down on to our spears. We singled out twenty-six fat bucks, and that was enough for the Household: the rest we let run against next time some Roman felt hungry. It is only a Savage who kills except to eat at once.",

We all rode armed, now, of course; we were ready to fight. Our flank scouts were half a mile to either side of the road we followed, looking for prey, like the booths of shepherds. As I had told Owain, they did not find any. Savages do not keep many sheep, and only for the wool: instead of lads, they have grown men, who follow the flock on foot and keep them in sight of the farm all day. But what was strange was that we caught none of the usual bands of straggling Savages, bound one way or another across the hills to beg and scavenge on the West coast. At this time of the year, we ought to have caught scores of them going back for the wheat harvest. But there were none, as if, for some reason, they had all rushed home already.',

Men ran from the procession towards the lights, towards the horns, to Cynrig fighting in the dark. All that saved us was this, that all the men who had come out in the wedding procession had put on their mail for it. They ran towards Cynrig, ran in one body, and that was their undoing, running into the paddock and across it. For in a moment, the paddock fence that they had put up that evening was broken down in a hundred places, and the whole herd of horses, terrified already by the horns and the shouts, ran away from the soldiers out into the night.
