He did not wish to give her hand in marriage, since her hand was the only warm hand in the castle. Even the hands of his watch and the hands of all the thirteen clocks were frozen. They had all frozen at the same time, on a snowy night, seven years before, and after that it was always <<ten minutes to five|10>> in the castle. Travelers and mariners would look up at the gloomy castle on the lonely hill and say, \x{201c}Time lies frozen there. It\x{2019}s always Then. It\x{2019}s never Now.\x{201d}",

            "The Duke limped because his legs were of different lengths. The right one had outgrown the left because, when he was young, he had spent his mornings place-kicking pups and punting kittens. He would say to a suitor, \x{201c}What is the difference in the length of my legs?\x{201d} and if the youth replied, \x{201c}Why, one is shorter than the other,\x{201d} the Duke would run him through with the sword he carried in his swordcane and feed him to the geese. The suitor was supposed to say, \x{201c}Why, one is longer than the other.\x{201d} Many a prince had been run through for naming the wrong difference. Others had been slain for offenses equally trivial: trampling the Duke\x{2019}s camellias, failing to praise his wines, staring too long at his gloves, gazing too long at his niece. Those who survived his scorn and sword were given incredible labors to perform in order to win his niece\x{2019}s hand, the only warm hand in the castle, where time had frozen to death at <<ten minutes to five|10>> one snowy night. They were told to cut a slice of moon, or change the ocean into wine. They were set to finding things that never were, and building things that could not be. They came and tried and failed and disappeared and never came again. And some, as I have said, were slain, for using names that start with X, or dropping spoons, or wearing rings, or speaking disrespectfully of sin.",

The laughter of the Duke and Hark and Listen followed him out the door and down the stairs and into the darkness.
