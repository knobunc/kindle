"But how could you know, how could you possibly know from that diary that the man was your father? I never knew his name. This Jew who wrote the diary never knew. How did you know?" "My father was killed on October eleventh, <<nineteen forty-four|5k:0>>, in Ostland," said Miller. "For twenty years that was all I knew. Then I read the diary. It was the same day, the same area, the two men had the same rank. Above all, both men wore the Knight\'s Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster, the highest award for bravery in the field. There weren\'t all that many of those awarded, and very few to mere Army captains. It would have been millions to one against two similar officers dying in the same area on the same day." Roschmann knew he was up against a man whom no argument could influence.',

Claim the insurance on your car, get a Volkswagen, go back to Hamburg, marry Sigi, have kids, and stick to reporting. Don\'t tangle with professionals again."
