            "\x{201c}She might,\x{201d} said Inspector Bland slowly. \x{201c}Actually, it\x{2019}s the best thing she could do. You see, if she picks up a tray with cake and a fruit drink and tells everyone she\x{2019}s taking that for the child down there\x{2014}well, then, her presence is accounted for. She goes there and comes back and says the girl was alive at that time. We\x{2019}ve taken her word for it. But if you remember, sir, and look again at the medical evidence, Dr. Cook\x{2019}s time of death is between <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> and <<quarter to five|10>>. We\x{2019}ve only Miss Brewis\x{2019} word for it that Marlene was alive at a <<quarter past four|10>>. And there\x{2019}s one curious point that came up about her testimony. She told me that it was Lady Stubbs who told her to take the cakes and fruit drink to Marlene. But another witness said quite definitely that that wasn\x{2019}t the sort of thing that Lady Stubbs would think about. And I think, you know, that they\x{2019}re right there. It\x{2019}s not like Lady Stubbs. Lady Stubbs was a dumb beauty wrapped up in herself and her own appearance. She never seems to have ordered meals or taken an interest in household management or thought of anybody at all except her own handsome self. The more I think of it, the more it seems most unlikely that she should have told Miss Brewis to take anything to the Girl Guide.\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}No motive for killing the girl,\x{201d} said Bland; \x{201c}but I do think, you know, that she might have a motive for killing Lady Stubbs. According to M. Poirot, whom I told you about, she\x{2019}s head over heels in love with her employer. Supposing she followed Lady Stubbs into the woods and killed her and that Marlene Tucker, bored in the boathouse, came out and happened to see it? Then of course she\x{2019}d have to kill Marlene too. What would she do next? Put the girl\x{2019}s body in the boathouse, come back to the house, fetch the tray and go down to the boathouse again. Then she\x{2019}s covered her own absence from the f\x{ea}te and we\x{2019}ve got her testimony, our only reliable testimony on the face of it, that Marlene Tucker was alive at a <<quarter past four|10>>.\x{201d}",

            "It was physically impossible for Sir George or Jim Warburton to have killed Marlene Tucker. Since it was not physically impossible for Mrs. Oliver to have done so, he added her name after a brief space. He also added the name of Mrs. Masterton since he did not remember of his own knowledge having seen Mrs. Masterton constantly on the lawn between <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> and <<quarter to five|10>>. He added the name of Henden, the butler; more, perhaps, because a sinister butler had figured in Mrs. Oliver\x{2019}s Murder Hunt than because he had really any suspicions of the dark-haired artist with the gong stick. He also put down \x{201c}Boy in turtle shirt\x{201d} with a query mark after it. Then he smiled, shook his head, took a pin from the lapel of his jacket, shut his eyes and stabbed with it. It was as good a way as any other, he thought.",

She got through all the clues and arrived at the boathouse triumphantly, but of course the police were there. So then she heard about the murder, and she was the last person at the whole f\x{ea}te to hear about it, I should imagine.

            "\x{201c}And so the final drama was staged. <<Just before four o\x{2019}clock|10>> Lady Stubbs told Miss Brewis to take a tea tray down to Marlene. That was because she was afraid such an idea might occur to Miss Brewis independently, and it would be fatal if Miss Brewis should inconveniently appear at the wrong moment. Perhaps, too, she had a malicious pleasure in arranging for Miss Brewis to be at the scene of the crime at approximately the time it was committed. Then, choosing her moment, she slipped into the empty fortune-telling tent, out through the back and into the summerhouse in the shrubbery where she kept her hiker\x{2019}s rucksack with its change of costume. She slipped through the woods, called to Marlene to let her in, and strangled the unsuspecting girl then and there. The big coolie hat she threw into the river, then she changed into her hiker dress and makeup, packaged up her cyclamen georgette dress and high-heeled shoes in the rucksack\x{2014}and presently an Italian student from the youth hostel joined her Dutch acquaintance at the shows on the lawn, and left with her by the local bus as planned. Where she is now I do not know. I suspect in Soho where she doubtless has underworld affiliations of her own nationality who can provide her with the necessary papers. In any case, it is not for an Italian girl that the police are looking, it is for Hattie Stubbs, simple, subnormal, exotic.",
