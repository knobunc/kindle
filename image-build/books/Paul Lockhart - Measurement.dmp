If, for instance, the point is at position number 2 when the clock reads <<1|11>>, then that information (position is 2 when time is 1) constitutes an event in the history of the motion, and complete knowledge of all such events is tantamount to the motion itself. Geometrically, we can represent an event like this as a pair of points, one in space and one in time, linked together by the motion of the point itself:',

The horizontal position needs to begin at <<0|9c:0>>, decrease to \x{2212}1, and then move back to 0, up to 1, and back to 0 again. That\x{2019}s exactly what sin t does\x{2014}only negated. So the horizontal coordinate is moving in the \x{2212}sin t pattern; similarly for the vertical, only with cosine. Alternatively, our point is moving in the customary way from the perspective of someone standing on the other side of the plane, looking sideways. This has the effect of reversing the coordinates and negating them\x{2014}more relativity, I suppose. In any case, we have a precise description of the motion of the point from the point of view of the center.",

The amazing power of this system is that it allows us to quickly and easily perform calculations that would otherwise be very time consuming and laborious. To multiply 1876 by <<316|3:0>> we merely have to jiggle a few symbols around (or better yet, let a machine do it).

More precisely, every vertical stick in the first region corresponds to a stick in the second region whose horizontal position is three times as large, while being one-third as tall.
