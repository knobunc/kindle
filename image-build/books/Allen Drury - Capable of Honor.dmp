He knew, if the News and Star did not, that the President would not attend, for the President had called early in the afternoon and told him so.

Turning toward him from his place by the fire was that complex and brilliant personality who was to precede him in Sacramento and then go on to precede Harley Hudson in the White House.

Why shouldn\x{2019}t he?\x{201d} And although Ted protested that Don Carlos had not actually been his great-granddaddy but only his great-grandmother\x{2019}s first husband, the Governor had won agreeing laughter from their attentive audience when he said, \x{201c}Never admit it, Ted!
