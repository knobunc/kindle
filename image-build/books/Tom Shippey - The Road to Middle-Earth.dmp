            "For English people of Tolkien\x{2019}s generation, the words \x{2018}in my time\x{2019} carry a powerful echo. In 1938, returning from the Munich conference where he gave way to Hitler, Neville Chamberlain notoriously and quite wrongly announced that he brought back \x{2018}peace in our time\x{2019}, and the words (themselves taken from the Anglican liturgy) have become irrevocably tainted with appeasement, avoidance of duty, and failure. When Gandalf says \x{2018}all who live to see such times\x{2019}, then, he could be taken as meaning, in unconscious prophecy, Tolkien\x{2019}s contemporaries and countrymen; and when he says \x{2018}them\x{2019}, the pronoun includes Frodo and the Shire-hobbits with everyone in Middle-earth and indeed everyone at any time faced with the need for painful decision. Gandalf then softens the implied criticism slightly by changing his pronoun, including himself, and narrowing the focus: \x{2018}All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us\x{2019} (my emphasis). The echo of Chamberlain, however, might well slip past a twenty-first century audience almost a lifetime removed from <<1938|9c:0>> and Munich. But Jackson gives the words a renewed emphasis by moving them to a different place and moment. In the first of his films, the words are still said by Gandalf to Frodo, but they are said in another notably quiet scene, in the dark, as the two characters talk in the Mines of Moria (JFR 34, \x{2018}A Journey in the Dark\x{2019}). Their force is furthermore established by repetition. Almost at the very end of the movie, as Frodo prepares to leave the Fellowship and set out as he intends for Mordor on his own (JFR 46, \x{2018}The Road Goes Ever On\x{2019}), he seems to hear Gandalf\x{2019}s words repeated, with the face of Gandalf (whom he and the viewers think at that moment to be dead) filling the screen. Only the words have once more had their pronouns changed. This time what Frodo hears is, \x{2018}All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given you.\x{2019} The statement has accordingly become entirely personal, directed precisely at Frodo\x{2019}s own single moment of decision.",

            "By <<1852|9:0>>, indeed, \x{2018}the new philology\x{2019} had many triumphs to look back on, with several yet to come: one might pick out the prize-winning essay of Rasmus Rask in 1814, on Old Icelandic, and on the relationship of Scandinavian languages to Slavic, Celtic, Finnish and Classical ones; the enormous \x{2018}Comparative Grammar\x{2019} or Vergleichende Grammatik of Franz Bopp in 1833\x{2013}49, which covered Sanskrit, Zend, Armenian, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Slavic, Gothic and German; the Deutsche Grammatik (1819) of Jacob Grimm, and all their many successors.11 The point which all these works brandished was the intensely systematic nature of discovery, expressed as time went on increasingly by the word \x{2018}laws\x{2019} (see OED citation above), and on the analogy of physics or chemistry by the association of laws with discoverers: Grimm\x{2019}s Law, Verner\x{2019}s Law, Kuhn\x{2019}s Law, Thomsen\x{2019}s Law, etc. There was and still is something insidiously fascinating about the relationships these laws uncover, in such detail and such profusion. Latin pisces is the same word as Old English fisc, observed Jacob Grimm, or indeed modern English \x{2018}fish\x{2019}; pes is the same as \x{2018}foot\x{2019} and pellis as \x{2018}fell\x{2019} (the old word for \x{2018}skin\x{2019}). What about porcus and \x{2018}pig\x{2019} though, where the p/f alternation breaks down? Well, there is an Old English word fearh which corresponds properly, noted Grimm, its modern descendant being \x{2018}farrow\x{2019}, again an old or dialectal word for a \x{2018}birth\x{2019} of piglets. The mill of comparisons will not work on basic or standard or literary languages alone, but demands ever-increasing grist from older or localised or sub-standard forms. The reward it offers is first an increasing sense that everything can be worked out, given time and material, second an exciting tension between the modern meanings of words \x{2013} words everyone has known all their lives \x{2013} and what appear as the ancient meanings. \x{2018}Daughter\x{2019} in modern Hindustani comes out as beti; yet there is a connection between the two languages in the word dudh, \x{2018}milk\x{2019}. In ancient days, it seems, a word like Sanskrit duhitar meant \x{2018}the little milker\x{2019}; but the job was so often given to daughters that task and relationship became fused. It \x{2018}opens before our eyes a little idyll of the poetical and pastoral life of the early Aryans\x{2019} enthused Max M\x{fc}ller,12 whose lectures on comparative philology bowled over not only (or not even) the learned world in the 1860s and after, but also London\x{2019}s high society. Comparison was the rage: it didn\x{2019}t tell you only about words, it told you about people.",

            "Philology illuminated the Dark Ages. Certainly, when it comes to Gothic chieftains, J. B. Bury\x{2019}s revised edition of Gibbon (in 1896) proceeds with a new caution! But the essential point \x{2013} it is a point which Tolkien\x{2019}s academic predecessors had signally failed to grasp, with consequent ruin for their subject \x{2013} lies in the immense stretch of the philological imagination. At <<one|9t:0>> extreme scholars were drawing conclusions from the very letters of a language: they had little hesitation in ascribing texts to Gothic or Lombardic authors, to West Saxons or Kentishmen or Northumbrians, on the evidence of sound-changes recorded in spelling. At the other extreme they were prepared to pronounce categorically on the existence or otherwise of nations and empires on the basis of poetic tradition or linguistic spread. They found information, and romance, in songs and fragments everywhere. The Lex Burgundionum of King Gundobad opened, as had been known for centuries, with a list of royal ancestors, Gibica, Gundomar, Gislaharius, Gundaharius. It took philology to equate nos. 1, 3 and 4 with the Gifica, G\x{ed}slhere and G\x{fa}thhere of Old English poems, nos. 1 and 4 with the Gibeche and Gunther of the Germans\x{2019} epic, the Nibelungenlied. Simultaneously it became apparent that the epic had a kernel of truth: the Huns had wiped out a Burgundian king and army in the 430s (as Gibbon had vaguely noted), some of the names were authentic, there had been a continuing tradition of poetry from fifth to twelfth centuries, even if it had all vanished and never been written down. Sidonius Apollinaris, bishop of Clermont, indeed mentioned the Burgundians\x{2019} songs with distaste in a sixth-century lyric. \x{2018}The learned and eloquent Sidonius\x{2019}, Gibbon calls him. \x{2018}How gladly would we now give all his verses for ten lines of the songs in which these \x{201c}long-haired seven-foot high, onion-eating barbarians\x{201d} celebrated, it may be, the open-handedness of Gibica, or perhaps told how, in that last terrible battle, their fathers had fallen fighting round Gundahari\x{2019}, wrote R. W. Chambers more sourly.18 The change of viewpoint marks an enormous if temporary shift of poetic and literary interest from Classical to native. It also shows how philology could seem, to some, the \x{2018}noblest of sciences\x{2019}, the key to \x{2018}spiritual life\x{2019}, certainly \x{2018}something much greater than a misfit combination of language plus literature\x{2019}.",

            "Thus journey = death. Niggle the painter further = Tolkien the writer. One can see as much from the accusation of being \x{2018}just idle\x{2019}, softened later to being \x{2018}the sort of painter who can paint leaves better than trees\x{2019}, or to being unable to organise his time; Tolkien was sensitive to accusations of laziness, but it is clear enough that he was a perfectionist, and also easily distracted.12 Niggle\x{2019}s \x{2018}leaf = The Hobbit, his \x{2018}Tree\x{2019} = The Lord of the Rings, the \x{2018}country\x{2019} that opens from it = Middle-earth, and the \x{2018}other pictures \x{2026} tacked on to the edges of his great picture\x{2019} = the poems and other works which Tolkien kept on fitting into his own greater one.13 Meanwhile the garden which Niggle does not keep up looks ominously like Tolkien\x{2019}s professorial duties; the visitors who hinted \x{2018}that he might get a visit from an Inspector\x{2019} remind one of that discourteous colleague of Tolkien\x{2019}s, who even after The Lord of the Rings came out snapped ungraciously \x{2018}He ought to have been teaching!\x{2019}14 One can go on making these equations, and one is supposed to; the essence of an allegory, Tolkien thought, was that it should be \x{2018}just\x{2019}, i.e. that all the bits should fit exactly together, compelling assent (and amusement) by their minuteness. If one realises that, there is a certain bite in the place where Niggle does his painting. He keeps his great canvas \x{2018}in the tall shed that had been built for it out in his garden (on a plot where once he had grown potatoes)\x{2019}. Niggle sacrificed potatoes to paint. What did Tolkien sacrifice to The Lord of the Rings? The real answer is, articles like those on Ancrene Wisse and the Sigelware; <<after 1940|9:0>> (when he was only 48) Tolkien wrote only five more, and two of these were collaborations and two others not entirely academic in style. Still, Tolkien never went over to despising the advancement of learning. It is Niggle\x{2019}s expressed gratitude for Parish\x{2019}s \x{2018}excellent potatoes\x{2019} which persuades the First Voice to let him out of the Workhouse (= Purgatory). One could say that the whole tale expresses both Tolkien\x{2019}s self-accusation and self-justification, and that its solution in Heaven lies in Niggle and Parish, the creative and the practical aspects of Tolkien himself, learning to work together \x{2013} though what they work on, you notice, is very definitely Niggle\x{2019}s Tree and Country, not Parish\x{2019}s potatoes at all.",

In origin this is only the classical story of Orpheus and Eurydice, but the fourteenth-century poet (or maybe some forgotten predecessor) has made two radical changes to it: <<one|9k:0>>, the land of the dead has become elf-land, from which the elf-king comes to seize Dame Heurodis; <<two|9k:0>>, Sir Orfeo, unlike his classical model, is successful in his quest and bears his wife away, overcoming the elf-king by the mingled powers of music and honour. The poem\x{2019}s most famous and original passage is the image of the elves in the wilderness, seen again and again by Orfeo as he wanders mad and naked, looking for his wife, but never certainly identified as hallucinations, phantoms, or real creatures on the other side of some transparent barrier which Orfeo cannot break through.

            "His name, thus, is Baggins, and he lives in Bag End. This latter name had personal and homely associations for Tolkien (see Biography, p. 234). But it is also a literal translation of the phrase one sees often yet stuck up at the end of little English roads: cul-de-sac. Cul-de-sacs are at once funny and infuriating. They belong to no language, since the French call such a thing an impasse and the English a \x{2018}dead-end\x{2019}. The word has its origins in snobbery, the faint residual feeling that English words, ever since the Norman Conquest, have been \x{2018}low\x{2019} and that French ones, or even Frenchified ones, would be better. Cul-de-sac is accordingly a peculiarly ridiculous piece of English class-feeling \x{2013} and Bag End a defiantly English reaction to it. As for Mr Baggins, one thing he is more partial to than another is his tea, which he has at <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>. But over much of the country \x{2018}tea\x{2019}, indeed anything eaten between meals but especially afternoon tea \x{2018}in a substantial form\x{2019} as the OED says, is called \x{2018}baggins\x{2019}. The OED prefers the \x{2018}politer\x{2019} form \x{2018}bagging\x{2019}, but Tolkien knew that people who used words like that were almost certain to drop the terminal -g (another post-Conquest confusion anyway). He would have found the term glossed under b\x{e6}ggin, b\x{e6}gginz in W. E. Haigh\x{2019}s Glossary of the Dialect of the Huddersfield District (London: Oxford University Press), for which he had written an appreciative prologue in 1928. Mr Baggins, then, is at the start of The Hobbit full of nonsense, like modern English society as perceived by Tolkien: he takes pride in being \x{2018}prosy\x{2019}, pooh-poohs anything out of the ordinary, and is almost aggressively middle middle-class in being more respectable than the Tooks though rather \x{2018}well-to-do\x{2019} than \x{2018}rich\x{2019}. If he went much further in this direction he would end up like his cousins the \x{2018}Sackville-Bagginses\x{2019} \x{2013} they, of course, have severed their connection with Bag End by calling it cul-de-sac(k) and tagging on the French suffix -ville! Yet Bilbo\x{2019}s heart is in the right place (also like modern English society as perceived by Tolkien). He likes flowers; he is proud of his ancestor the Bullroarer; if not quite \x{2018}as fierce as a dragon in a pinch\x{2019} he is at any rate no coward; and like his name he is ample, generous, substantial, if undeniably plain and old-fashioned. He has therefore not entirely lost his passport into the ancient world, and can function in it as our representative, without heroic pretensions but also without cynical ironies. He is admittedly a bourgeois. That is why Gandalf turns him into a Burglar. Both words come from the same root (burh = \x{2018}town\x{2019} or \x{2018}stockaded house\x{2019}), and while they are eternal opposites they are opposites on the same level. By the end of The Hobbit, though, Bilbo as burglar has progressed so far as to rub shoulders with heroes, even to be (just) considerable as one himself.*",

Before that, though, Bard has figured as a nameless participant in a crowd scene about the giving and taking of orders. He has the trumpets blown, the warriors armed, the pots filled with water and the bridge to the land thrown down; it is this last precaution which daunts Smaug for a moment as he sweeps in over the cold fire-quenching lake. Then the dragon is faced with \x{2018}a hail of dark arrows\x{2019} from platoons of bowmen, urged on by \x{2018}the grim-voiced man (Bard was his name), who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them to fight to the last arrow\x{2019}. Fighting to the last round is of course the traditional phrase; being a \x{2018}discipline\x{2019} concept it post-dates musketry. But Tolkien has here transferred the ethic of Waterloo or Albuera back to ancient days. He does it again as the dragon shatters the town and the townspeople break for their lifeboats: \x{2018}But there was still a company of archers that held their ground among the burning houses. Their captain was Bard\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{2019} The phrase \x{2018}hold one\x{2019}s ground\x{2019} is not even recorded by the OED till <<1856|9c:0>>, though there is a parallel in the Old English poem Maldon, where the English are exhorted to \x{2018}hold their stead\x{2019} (which they don\x{2019}t). Not that holding their ground does these particular archers any good, or Smaug any harm; he is killed by the last arrow, the one particular arrow shot heroically by Bard.

            "Since The Silmarillion, with its developed nomenclature, was already in existence, it would be wrong to say that Tolkien in the 1930s was not interested in names. It does look, though, as if he was not sure how to bring them into fiction, especially if they were English names. Yet the point had caught his attention. As The Hobbit neared completion he focused on the problem with sudden clarity \x{2013} as one can see from Farmer Giles of Ham, not published till <<1949|9c:0>>, but composed apparently in the period 1935\x{2013}8, i.e. overlapping with the final production of The Hobbit (see Bibliography, pp. 73\x{2013}4). This throws many interesting sidelights on Tolkien\x{2019}s fictional development. For one thing it is the only one of his stories set unmistakably in England, and while its history is that of nursery-rhyme* its geography is remarkably clear. Ham is now Thame, a town in Buckinghamshire twelve miles east of Oxford. Worminghall is four miles away and Oakley, which had its parson eaten, five. The capital of the Middle Kingdom, \x{2018}some twenty leagues distant from Ham\x{2019}, sounds like Tamworth, the historical capital of the Mercian kings, sixty-eight miles from Thame as the crow flies (a league, NB, is three miles). Farthingho in Northamptonshire, where once \x{2018}an outpost against the Middle Kingdom was maintained\x{2019}, is on a direct line between those two places about a third of the way from Thame \x{2013} proof of the \x{2018}Little Kingdom\x{2019}s\x{2019} lack of territorial ambition. Wales, where the giants live, and the (Pennine) mountains where the dragons live are on this parochial scale suitably far off.

            "Tolkien\x{2019}s new equation of fantasy with reality comes over most strongly in his map, account and history of \x{2018}the Shire\x{2019}, an extended \x{2018}Little Kingdom\x{2019}, one might say, transplanted to Middle-earth. The easiest way to describe it is to say that the Shire is \x{2018}calqued\x{2019} on England, \x{2018}calquing\x{2019} being a linguistic term to mean that process in which the elements of a compound word are translated bit by bit to make a new word in another language, as in French haut-parleur from \x{2018}loudspeaker\x{2019} (parler haut = \x{2018}speak loudly\x{2019}), or Irish eachchumhacht from \x{2018}horsepower\x{2019} (each = \x{2018}horse\x{2019}, like eoh, equus above). The point about calques is that the derivative does not sound anything like its original: nevertheless it betrays influence at every point. Thus historically the Shire is like / unlike England, the hobbits like / unlike English people. Hobbits live in the Shire as the English live in England, but like the English they come from somewhere else, indeed from the Angle (in Europe between Flensburg Fjord and the Schlei, in Middle-earth between Hoarwell and Loudwater). Both groups have forgotten this fact. Both emigrated in three tribes, Angles, Saxons and Jutes or Stoors, Harfoots and Fallohides, all since then largely mingled. The English were led by two brothers, Hengest and Horsa, i.e. \x{2018}stallion\x{2019} and \x{2018}horse\x{2019}, the hobbits by Marcho and Blanco, cp. Old English *marh, \x{2018}horse\x{2019}, blanca (only in Beowulf) \x{2018}white horse\x{2019}.5 All four founded realms which evolved into uncharacteristic peace: there was no battle in the Shire between the Greenfields, <<1147|9l>>, and the Battle of Bywater, <<1419|9l>>, an interval of 272 years very like the 270 between publication of The Return of the King and the last battle fought on English soil, Sedgemoor, 1685. Organisationally too the Shire, with its mayors, musters, moots and Shirriffs, is an old-fashioned and idealised England, while the hobbits, in their plainness, greediness, frequent embarrassments, distrust of \x{2018}outsiders\x{2019}* and most of all in their deceptive ability to endure rough handling form an easily recognisable if again old-fashioned self-image of the English. The calquing is most evident, however, on the map.",

They ought to suggest also that he thought more deeply than his critics have ever recognised about just those issues he is commonly alleged to ignore: the processes of temptation, the complex nature of good and evil, the relationship between reality and our fallible perception of it. Nothing can prevent people from saying that the answers he gave were not \x{2018}adult\x{2019} or \x{2018}fundamental\x{2019}, but it should be obvious that such adjectives are as culture-biased as Saruman\x{2019}s \x{2018}real\x{2019}: by themselves they express only the prejudices of the user.

They were not, however, \x{2018}the work of his heart\x{2019}, as I have called it elsewhere (Author, ch. 5). This was the immense complex of stories, repeatedly told and retold in quite different forms, which I call \x{2018}the Silmarillion\x{2019}, but distinguish from The Silmarillion: which is the selection from that immense complex made by Christopher Tolkien and published in 1977, arranged as the latter explains \x{2018}in such a way as seemed to me to produce the most coherent and internally self-consistent narrative\x{2019}. Tolkien worked on his hobbit-cycle for nearly thirty years, if one accepts that he began composing The Hobbit <<about 1929|18:0>> and was still working on the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings in 1955 (see Bibliography, pp. 7, 96).

Once The Lord of the Rings was effectively completed, however, he turned back with renewed energy to \x{2018}the Silmarillion\x{2019}, and in the early 1950s wrote two further sets of annals, \x{2018}The Annals of Aman\x{2019} and \x{2018}The Grey Annals\x{2019}, along with a yet longer epitome, \x{2018}The Later \x{201c}Quenta Silmarillion\x{201d}\x{2019}, all these published along with much else in volumes X and XI of \x{2018}The History of Middle-earth\x{2019}, Morgoth\x{2019}s Ring and The War of the Jewels.

In Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-earth three years later he went on to give significant expansions of some of the \x{2018}Silmarillion\x{2019} material, including the longest and most developed account of the T\x{fa}rin story, \x{2018}The Narn i H\x{ee}n H\x{fa}rin\x{2019} or \x{2018}Tale of the Children of H\x{fa}rin\x{2019}, as well as of the Second Age (that of N\x{fa}menor), and the Third Age, which ran from the first defeat of Sauron by Elendil, Gil-galad and Isildur to the destruction of the Ring and the departure of Frodo over sea.",

But by the time he wrote \x{2018}The Quest of Erebor\x{2019} (perhaps <<around 1950|18:0>>), Tolkien had come to think it undignified. In repeated versions he explains laboriously that Gandalf forced Bilbo on Thorin out of some Valinorean \x{2018}foresight\x{2019}; or because he knew hobbits were stealthy; or because he thought Bilbo had the right \x{2018}mix\x{2019} of Took and Baggins; while as for the word \x{2018}burglar\x{2019}, it was all a dwarvish misunderstanding.

            "The word underlying these last few pages is \x{2018}thrift\x{2019}. All minds possess a drive towards consistency, towards reducing data, events, characters to some smaller set of principles or categories. Much of Tolkien\x{2019}s writing in Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales shows that urge, a strong and honourable one. It is fair to say, though, that against this basic drive all minds also possess a wish to ignore principles and concentrate instead on single entities regardless of their place in larger systems, to appreciate them simply for themselves. For most of his career Tolkien was a most extreme example of a man with this second urge strongly developed: he was fascinated by names, to give only one example, part of whose nature is that they are for one thing and one thing alone, very hard to reduce to system! Hence the supreme lavishness of Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings, with its vast store of plants and races, names and languages and individuals and landscapes. As he turned towards thrift, consistency, classification, Tolkien forfeited much of what he had valued before; he was contracting, not expanding. In a way the very success of The Lord of the Rings, founded on its immense solidity and scope, made life difficult for him afterwards. Not only would The Silmarillion have to achieve the \x{2018}depth\x{2019} it had already been used to create, it would have to do so without contradicting, and while if possible reinforcing, all the millions of details Tolkien had handed over to his readership already. For these two reasons it is hardly any wonder that Tolkien balked, and that the Unfinished Tales in particular show a mind searching in different directions. <<After 1955|9:0>> many ways forward were blocked. The question was, whether the vitality of his original conceptions and compositions of the period before The Lord of the Rings, indeed from the 1910s on, could survive.",

            "But actually Tolkien had no doubt already started finding out, taking the two obvious courses of looking up \x{2018}Earendel\x{2019} in A. S. Cook\x{2019}s 1900 edition of Christ and in the index of Jacob Grimm\x{2019}s Teutonic Mythology. From the latter he would have learnt that Earendel-references appear in several Germanic languages. In the Prose Edda, for instance, Aurvandill is a companion of the god Th\x{f3}rr, who loses a toe to frostbite only to have it thrown into the sky to become a star; as one might have guessed from Christ, \x{2018}Earendel\x{2019} is the old name of a star or planet. Grimm also referred though to the German poem of Orendel, written <<about 1200|18:0>>. In this Orendel is a king\x{2019}s son shipwrecked in the Holy Land, but rescued naked by a fisherman. He retrieves a grey robe from a whale they catch, and in it returns to his own land to convert his heathen countrymen. The grawe roc he wears is the seamless robe Christ wore to the Crucifixion; in the end Orendel becomes der Graurock, \x{2018}Greycloak\x{2019}, is identified with his garment. What this may have suggested to Tolkien is that if the Old English and Old Norse sources agreed that \x{2018}Earendel\x{2019} was a star, the Old English and medieval German ones agreed he was a messenger of hope to the heathens. Perhaps the hope-association was as old as the star one; perhaps \x{2018}Earendel\x{2019} had contained a presentiment of salvation even for the old heroes (like Beowulf) who lived before Christianity was brought to them. The notes in Cook\x{2019}s edition would meanwhile have told Tolkien that the Old English lines were based on a Latin antiphon, \x{2018}O Oriens\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{2019} (\x{2018}O Rising Light, splendour of eternal light and sun of justice: come and shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death\x{2019}).

This is based on the famous voyage by St Brendan (\x{2018}the Navigator\x{2019}) from Ireland to the unknown countries of the West, found in many medieval versions and related to a whole Irish genre of imrama which includes the famous Imram Brain mac Febail or \x{2018}Voyage of Bran son of Febal to the Land of the Living\x{2019}.

He thought that the dreams and the ideas did not come from his own mind but might \x{2013} like the names, after all \x{2013} be the record or memory of something that once might have had an objective existence.

            "I am sure this is the sort of fate Tolkien would have liked for his work: to be subsumed, to be taken into the unpredictabilities of tradition. For that to happen, its context would need to change; and already it is changing. As one looks at the development of Tolkien\x{2019}s work from <<1916|9c:0>> and The Book of Lost Tales to 1967 and Smith of Wootton Major, one fact appears, which would, perhaps, not need saying if his critics had not been so dead sure his writing could not possibly have any relevance to the century he and they lived in. This is, as I suggest above, that The Lord of The Rings in particular is a war-book, also a post-war book, framed by and responding to the crisis of Western civilisation, 1914\x{2013}1945 (and beyond). It is not at all clear why the response of several English and American writers, themselves personally involved in war, and deeply anxious to write about it, should have been to communicate their thoughts and experience via fantasy. Yet that is what they did: as mentioned above, William Golding, the naval officer, in Lord of the Flies, and subsequently in another fable of a non-human race, The Inheritors (1955); T. H. White, the neutralist, in The Once and Future King, written at much the same time as The Lord of the Rings, nationibus diro in bello certantibus, \x{2018}while the nations were striving in fearful war\x{2019}, the whole work appearing in 1958, four years after Tolkien\x{2019}s;18 George Orwell, shot through the neck in Spain, in the fable/allegory Animal Farm (1945), and then in Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949); Kurt Vonnegut, the survivor of the bombing of Dresden, in Slaughterhouse-Five (1966). All these men were writing obviously, or even self-declaredly, about the nature of evil, which they thought had changed in their time, or about which the human race had gained new knowledge. Why did they have to write fantasy, or science fiction, if they had such an evidently realistic, serious, non-escapist, contemporary theme? No answer has been agreed, and the question has not often even been put. Still, one thing one can say is that Tolkien belongs in this group.",
