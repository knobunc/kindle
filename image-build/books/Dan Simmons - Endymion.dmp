Flitting between the branches of these trees and between the trees themselves, Ouster variants are visible\x{2014}humanoid shapes with silver-reflective skin and micron-thin butterfly wings extending hundreds of meters.

He also informs the sergeant that the two dozen Pax engineers who have been swarming over the farcaster portal for three weeks report only that there is no sign that the ancient arch had been activated, despite sightings of a bright flash by several fishermen on the platform that night.

By <<midday|13>> we were moving through a more fertile valley. Irrigation canals ran at right angles from our river, and short yellow palms and magenta bottlebrushes lined the waterways.

Everything normal except the dry details of four small reactor-thruster firings. To attain and hold a perfect geosynchronous orbit, a ship like Raphael will fire dozens of little thruster tweaks such as these. But most such fine-tunings, de Soya knows, involve the large reaction-thruster pods on the stern near the fusion drive, and on the command-pod boom at the bow of the awkwardly configured courier ship. These thruster burps were similar\x{2014}first a double firing to stabilize the ship during a roll so the command pod was facing away from the planet\x{2014}normal during rotisserie mode to spread the solar heating uniformly along the ship\x{2019}s surface without using field coolant\x{2014}but only eight minutes here\x{2014}and here!

Then, <<four hours and eight minutes|14>> later, the entire sequence again.
