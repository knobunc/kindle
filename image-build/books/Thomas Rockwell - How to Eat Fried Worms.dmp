            "Billy was doing push-ups in the deserted horse barn. He wasn\x{2019}t worried about eating the first worm. But people were always daring him to do things, and he\x{2019}d found it was better to look ahead, to try to figure things out, get himself ready. Last winter Alan had dared him to sleep out all night in the igloo they\x{2019}d built in Tom\x{2019}s backyard. Why not? Billy had thought to himself. What could happen? <<About midnight|13>>, huddled shivering under his blankets in the darkness, he\x{2019}d begun to wonder if he should give up and go home. His feet felt like aching stones in his boots; even his tongue, inside his mouth, was cold. But half an hour later, as he was stubbornly dancing about outside in the moonlight to warm himself, Tom\x{2019}s dog Martha had come along with six other dogs, all in a pack, and Billy had coaxed them into the igloo and blocked the door with an orange crate, and after the dogs had stopped wrestling and nipping and barking and sniffing around, they\x{2019}d all gone to sleep in a heap with Billy in the middle, as warm as an onion in a stew.",
