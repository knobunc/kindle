An underslung rail-guided vehicle with slide-doors opening into cubicles glided quietly alongside.

Then meanwhile the hairstyler got a bit cranky and aligned my second lock in front of my shoulder instead of the sine curve I\x{2019}ve been used to, sod it.

One of these days I can tell, this is going to be. I hope you\x{2019}re functioning anyway, sodding tape-set; play you back and see ... Good. And then when I pressed the news button I thought, I bet this\x{2019}ll be black and so it was; this is, as black as they ever leak. As usual, the British news was cushy, only the exter news leaked much. Thousands dead in American riots, some of them fried by the cops and feds. (Ours only rinse, never heard of frying here.) Same thing in Japan and China and Russia, more or less. Between the lines, inter looked bad too: \x{2018}The disorganization in Mersea is under active control. Prospective traffic from other megalopolises is advised to contact the police by prior call, during the next ten days.\x{2019} I\x{2019}ve heard that one before. No motivation to visit in Mersea, luckily. Then the weathercast: why they have to keep the rain off the south and west and let it chuck it down all over Midlandia and the north I don\x{2019}t know. I suppose the agric zones have to have their sun, but why at our expense? Depressing, I call it. All very well for the uppercrust with their ion fountains and their sunlighting.",
