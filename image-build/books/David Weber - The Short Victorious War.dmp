            '"Ma\'am," he spoke softly, as if to a child, "we out-mass those ships <<seven to one|10a:0>>, and they have to close to energy range. They know what that means as well as we do. So they\'ll do the only thing they can. They\'ll open their broadsides to bring every beam they can to bear, and they\'ll go for our forward alpha nodes. If they take out even one, our own foresail will go down, and this deep into a grav wave - "',

            'Admiral Chin sat motionless for long, silent seconds. A minute passed, then two. <<Three|9k:0>>. Her ships\' drives fought desperately to slow their headlong charge toward the Manty superdreadnoughts, but the range fell inexorably and the admiral\'s eyes burned with frustrated rage as the battlecruisers sped away from her. The missile exchange continued, no less ferocious despite the drop in volume as both sides turned their broadsides away from one another, but the Manties\' superior missiles and - especially - defensive EW let them more than hold their own. Worse, they were ignoring everyone else to pound doggedly at Waldensville, whose damaged drive, unable to match her consorts\' decel, lagged further and further astern - closer and closer to the battlecruisers - as Chin\'s ships fled the superdreadnoughts.She stared down at her tactical repeater, then shoved herself out of her chair with a muffled curse and stamped across to the master plot. DeSoto and Klim exchanged unhappy looks as she abandoned the protection of her shock frame and left her helmet racked, but neither dared protest as she glared down into the holo.',

            'And if those were superdreadnoughts, why were the battlecruisers still running? They were accelerating away from her at almost five KPS; combined with her own deceleration, that produced a cumulative vector change of <<9.45|5a:0>> KPS. Of course, no battlecruiser wanted to get any closer to a dreadnought than it had to, but their heading also meant they could reply to her ships\' after chase armament only with their stern chasers. True, their fire was hammering Waldensville with ever mounting damage, but they could have turned to open their broadsides and quadrupled the weight of their fire, and with SDs coming to their assistance, Chin couldn\'t possibly have risked slowing her escape efforts by turning to reply in kind.',

            '"Perceptive as usual." Webster set his cup aside and leaned forward, bracing his forearms on his knees. "The fact is, Lucien Cortez is staying on as Fifth Space Lord, but Caparelli\'s going to want to put his own personnel policies in place, and I\'m here to get your input before I sign a few <<midnight|13>> command assignments." He waved a hand at White Haven\'s raised eyebrow. "Oh, it\'s his prerogative to make his own personnel decisions. I certainly wanted the same thing when I took over. But he\'s going to be feeling his way into things for a couple of months. Given the current situation in the PRH, I want him to have a solid team in the field during the transition."',

She beat the hell out of a Peep battlecruiser that out-massed her damn <<nearly three-to-one|10>> after she\'d been wounded! And I also know a bit about traumatic injuries, thank you." His mouth tightened, then he shook himself. "If she isn\'t back at a hundred percent physically by now, I\'ll eat my beret!"',
