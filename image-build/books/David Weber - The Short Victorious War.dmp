It was a clear bid to avoid action, and it would work... unless the Peeps chose to split their formation and go in pursuit.',

Her ships\' drives fought desperately to slow their headlong charge toward the Manty superdreadnoughts, but the range fell inexorably and the admiral\'s eyes burned with frustrated rage as the battlecruisers sped away from her. The missile exchange continued, no less ferocious despite the drop in volume as both sides turned their broadsides away from one another, but the Manties\' superior missiles and - especially - defensive EW let them more than hold their own. Worse, they were ignoring everyone else to pound doggedly at Waldensville, whose damaged drive, unable to match her consorts\' decel, lagged further and further astern - closer and closer to the battlecruisers - as Chin\'s ships fled the superdreadnoughts.She stared down at her tactical repeater, then shoved herself out of her chair with a muffled curse and stamped across to the master plot.

Of course, no battlecruiser wanted to get any closer to a dreadnought than it had to, but their heading also meant they could reply to her ships\' after chase armament only with their stern chasers. True, their fire was hammering Waldensville with ever mounting damage, but they could have turned to open their broadsides and quadrupled the weight of their fire, and with SDs coming to their assistance, Chin couldn\'t possibly have risked slowing her escape efforts by turning to reply in kind.',
