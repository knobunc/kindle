There is a fascinating dialogue between Alain Connes, the mathematician who featured in Bombieri\x{2019}s email, and the neurobiologist Jean-Pierre Changeux in Conversations on Mind, Matter and Mathematics. The tension in this book is palpable as the mathematician argues for the existence of mathematics outside the mind, and the neurologist is determined to refute any such idea: \x{2018}Why wouldn\x{2019}t we see \x{201c}\x{3c0} = 3.1416\x{201d} written in gold letters in the sky or \x{201c}<<6.02|5a:0>> \x{d7} 10\x{201d} appear in the reflections of a crystal ball?\x{2019} Changeux declares his frustration at Connes\x{2019}s insistence that \x{2018}there exists, independently of the human mind, a raw and immutable mathematical reality\x{2019} and at the heart of that world we find the unchanging list of primes.

Gauss\x{2019}s account of this new sort of arithmetic revolutionised mathematics at the turn of the nineteenth century.

Instead, he resorted to the powerful weapon of mathematical proof.

In contrast, the seventeenth-century prime number test based on 2 was finally thrown out of the mathematical court in 1819.

            "The great collaboration between Hardy and Littlewood was fuelled by the timely arrival from G\x{f6}ttingen of a book by Landau <<about prime|16>> numbers. The publication in 1909 of his two-volume work Handbuch der Lehre von der Verteilung der Primzahlen (\x{2018}Handbook of the Theory of the Distribution of Prime Numbers\x{2019}) proselytised the wonders of the connections between primes and the Riemann zeta function. Before Landau\x{2019}s book, the story of Riemann and the primes was largely unknown in the broader mathematical community. As Hardy acknowledged in his obituary of Landau (jointly written with Hans Heilbronn), \x{2018}The book transformed the subject, hitherto the hunting ground of a few adventurous heroes, into one of the most fruitful fields in the last thirty years.\x{2019} It would be Landau\x{2019}s book that would in 1914 inspire Hardy to prove that infinitely many zeros sat on Riemann\x{2019}s critical line. Fired up by the experiences of wrestling with the zeta function as a student, Littlewood too was encouraged to make the first of his great contributions to the subject.",

He was particularly excited by his discovery of a formula that appeared to count the primes with extraordinary accuracy. At first he had experienced the frustration that most people feel when they try to tame this wild sequence of numbers. But Ramanujan knew how fundamental the primes were to mathematics and did not give up on his belief that there should be some mathematical formula which would explain them. He still innocently believed that all mathematics and its patterns could be expressed precisely by the power of equations and formulas. As Littlewood later explained, \x{2018}How great a mathematician might Ramanujan have been 100 or 150 years ago; what would have happened if he had come into touch with Euler at the right moment? \x{2026} But the great day of formulae seems to be over.\x{2019} Ramanujan, however, had not been subjected to the nineteenth- and twentieth-century shift induced by Riemann. He was out to find a formula that produces the primes. Having spent hours calculating tables of primes, he saw a pattern emerge.

            "It was while exploring some of these related landscapes that Weil discovered a method that would explain why points at sea level in them like to be in a straight line. The landscapes where Weil was successful did not have to do with prime numbers, but held the key to counting how many solutions an equation such as y = x \x{2013} x will have if you are working on one of Gauss\x{2019}s clock calculators. For example, take the above equation and a five-hour calculator. If we put x equal to 2 on the right-hand side of the equation, we get 2 \x{2212} 2 = 8 \x{2212} 2 = 6, which is <<1 o\x{2019}clock|6>> on the five-hour clock calculator. Similarly, taking y equal to 4 on the other side gives us 16, which is also <<1 o\x{2019}clock|6>> on the five-hour clock calculator. This result, which we can write as (x, y) = (2, 4), is called a solution of the equation because both sides of the equation match up when calculated on the five-hour clock calculator. There are in fact seven different choices for the pair of numbers (x, y) which make the equation true:",
