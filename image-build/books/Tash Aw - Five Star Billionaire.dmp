            "From the start of his time in Shanghai, he was invited to the best parties\x{2014}the numerous openings of the flagship stores of Western luxury brands, or discreet private banquets hosted by young local entrepreneurs with excellent connections within the Party. He could always get a table at the famous Western restaurants on the Bund, and because people soon knew and liked him\x{2014}he was easy, unshowy company\x{2014}he was rarely on his own and was increasingly in the public eye. At <<one|9m:0>> party to launch a new line of underwear, held in a warehouse in the northern outskirts of the city, he found himself unconsciously trying to shrink away from the bank of flashbulbs that greeted the guests, so that when the photographs appeared, his head was cocked at an angle, as if he had recently hurt his neck in an accident. There were a dozen hydraulic platforms suspended above the party, each one occupied by a model clad only in underwear, gyrating uncomfortably to the thumping music; every time he looked up at them, they threw confetti down on him, which he then had to pick out of his hair. The event organizer later sent him copies of the photos\x{2014}he was frowning in every one, stray bits of confetti clinging to his suit like bird shit. Shanghai Tatler magazine photographed him at a black-tie charity event a few weeks after he arrived, his hair slickly swept back in a nod to the 1930s, a small white flower in his buttonhole, and a young Western woman in a qipao at his side. The caption read, Justin C. K. Lim and companion; he hadn\x{2019}t even known the woman. He bid on a guided tour of the city by Zhou X., a local starlet just beginning to make a name for herself in New Wave art-house films. It cost him 200,000 yuan, which was donated to orphans of the Sichuan earthquake. The men at the party nudged him and whispered slyly, \x{201c}Maybe you\x{2019}ll get to see the most secret sights of Shanghai, like she showed off in her latest movie.\x{201d} (He\x{2019}d heard of the film, which was set in a small village during the Cultural Revolution and already banned in China; The New York Times review of it called Zhou X. the intellectual man\x{2019}s Orientalist fantasy.)",

He thought of what Yinghui and C.S. were doing at that precise moment: <<quarter to midnight|10>> on a Friday evening. They would be at the caf\x{e9} that Yinghui had just opened, spread out on comfortable sofas, listening to Lou Reed or Cuban music, chatting about films and travel and love. She would be sitting with her legs on his lap, her bare feet moving in the air to the rhythm of the music as she talked; she would not even realize that her feet were moving, or that Justin was watching her, noticing how her second toe was far longer than her big toe, how she had a habit of curling her feet into tight arcs every now and then, particularly when she laughed. Now and then she would get up and make some herbal tea from plants that Justin had never heard of and didn\x{2019}t think were even drinkable, like nettle, or Indian chai, which they served in the caf\x{e9}, inspired by their journeys to the subcontinent.",

The Coke had left a sickly taste in his mouth, like cough medicine, and made him feel like throwing up; his head began to spin from all the alcohol he had drunk throughout the evening, and he wanted to go back to the hotel. He thought of Yinghui and C.S. again, reclining on the sofa at Angie\x{2019}s, facing each other with their ankles lazily interlaced as they leafed through magazines. It was Saturday night\x{2014}they might be listening to the Velvet Underground at that very moment; once it got <<past midnight|13>>, Yinghui would get up and put on \x{201c}Sunday Morning\x{201d} and start to sing along. Yeah, yeah, I\x{2019}m so predictable, she would say, laughing as she returned to the sofa. She knew all the words; just the previous Saturday, Justin had watched her mouthing the words to \x{201c}Pale Blue Eyes,\x{201d} her lips moving gently even though her eyelids were half closed with slumber. When she sang, \x{201c}Sometimes I feel so happy,\x{201d} she really did look completely contented. She and C.S. would never know what it was like to be in Justin\x{2019}s place, here in a karaoke bar in a small town up north\x{2014}and Justin was glad, because he didn\x{2019}t want her to experience all that men were capable of inflicting on others in this world he inhabited.",

The water appeared black and utterly still in the dark, but on the surface there were flecks of dust and froth that glimmered in the night light. There were old men sitting passively with their fishing rods poised over the water, motionless as statues.

Her voice had been calm and matter-of-fact, without any trace of hesitation\x{2014}in fact, it began so smoothly that he had the impression she had rehearsed the entire message before ringing him. She said simply that she had been involved in a large deal to purchase a landmark site that he might have heard of\x{2014}a building called simply 969\x{2014}and that she had taken out considerable loans secured on her existing businesses. It turned out\x{2014}ha-ha\x{2014}that her business partner had siphoned all the money from their business account. She\x{2019}d woken up one day and he had just vanished, along with the money. Well, it was her fault; she hadn\x{2019}t taken the requisite precautions. She had let her guard down, and you know what happens in Shanghai if you let your guard down. Maybe she was never destined to be a good businesswoman after all. She was sure that Justin wouldn\x{2019}t recall, but years ago she and Justin had once said that business, when deconstructed, was philosophically unchallenging\x{2014}remember that? What a joke. (Here, she half-laughed.) The mess she\x{2019}d made of the deal had reminded her of what Justin and everyone else said many years ago, that she\x{2019}d never understand business. He\x{2019}d known her better than she thought; she realized that now. She\x{2019}d spent days thinking about what kind of person she\x{2019}d been back then and what she\x{2019}d become. She wondered what Justin might make of her today\x{2014}compared to before, she meant. (A noise\x{2014}maybe a sniff, a runny nose? Her voice had begun to waver and soften.) Losing the money was painful, but what was worse was that she had been stupid, so stupid. (Here, a short pause, a muffled noise, as if she had cupped her hand over the phone.) Anyway, she didn\x{2019}t mean to bore him with details of her misery. No, in fact she was going to go back to the drawing board, salvage what she could from her businesses and see what happened. She knew she really wasn\x{2019}t that bad at business. Maybe not great, but definitely not terrible. She was going to stick it out in China and rise from the ashes\x{2014}again. (Then came a pause in the message\x{2014}so long that the first time Justin listened to it he wondered if she had hung up.) It would be hard, but that\x{2019}s life. She\x{2019}d experienced worse in the past, as he no doubt remembered. So, if he wanted to meet for a drink sometime, just to catch up on old times, he should give her a call. Or maybe (laugh) it would be better if they didn\x{2019}t catch up on old times and simply chatted about the weather, restaurants, that kind of thing. All the best.",

At thirteen he was running a coffee stand in Seremban, and at fifteen salvaging and redistributing automobile spare parts on a semi-industrial scale, a recycling genius long before the concept was even invented. Small-town Malaya in the 1920s was not a place for dreams. He was eighteen and working as an occasional porter in the Colony Club when he had the good fortune to meet a young assistant district officer from Fife called MacKinnon, only recently arrived in the Malay States. History does not record the precise nature of their relationship (those ugly rumors of blackmail were never proved), and in any event, as we will see later, imagining the whys and wherefores of past events, the what-might-have-beens\x{2014}all that is pointless. The only thing worth considering is what actually happens, and what happened in Lim\x{2019}s case was that he was left with enough money upon MacKinnon\x{2019}s untimely death (in a drowning accident) to start the first local insurance business in Singapore, a small enterprise that would eventually become the Overseas Chinese Assurance Company, for so long a bedrock of the Malaysian and Singaporean commercial landscape until its recent collapse. We can learn much from people like Lim, but his case study would involve a separate book altogether. For now, it is sufficient to ask: What were you doing when you were eight, thirteen, fifteen, and eighteen? The answer is, I suspect: not very much.",
