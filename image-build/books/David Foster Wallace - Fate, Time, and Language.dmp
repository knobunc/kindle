            "Causation. Again, it does no good here to appeal to any particular analyses of causation, or to the fact, if it is <<one|9f>>, that causes only \x{201c}work\x{201d} forwards and not backwards, for our problem has been formulated without any reference to causation. It may be, for all we know, that causal relations have an unalterable direction (which is an unclear claim in itself), but it is very certain that the relations of necessity and sufficiency between events or states of affairs have not, and it is in terms of these that our data have been described.",

            "This is all pretty standard. But Wallace wondered, What do I mean, while sitting, for instance, at my desk in Brooklyn at <<9:59 A.M.|2a>>, when I say, \x{201c}It is impossible for me to touch the Eiffel Tower at <<10 A.M.|5>>\x{201d}? Obviously, I don\x{2019}t mean that the act described is logically impossible (it\x{2019}s perfectly easy to conceive). But I also don\x{2019}t quite mean that the act described violates the laws of nature (touching the Eiffel Tower at <<10 A.M.|5>> is a perfectly ordinary physical act). What I mean is something like: Given the prevailing circumstances now, it is physically impossible for me to touch the Eiffel Tower at <<10 A.M.|5>> Wallace dubbed this kind of modality \x{201c}situational physical modality.\x{201d} Unlike logical modality and plain-old physical modality, situational physical modality, he observed, is not eternal and unchanging but rather highly sensitive to details of time and place (as the Eiffel Tower example illustrates). This was a critical distinction, Wallace contended, for the notions of necessity and possibility with which the Taylor argument is concerned are those of situational physical modality. Whether it was possible for me to have fired my handgun is a question the fatalist considers by taking into account certain specific physical and temporal circumstances (such as whether we are measuring its temperature before or after the matter of the gun\x{2019}s firing).",
