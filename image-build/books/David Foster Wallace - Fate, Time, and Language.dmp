            "Probably the most important and influential twentieth-century work on the problem of future contingents has been done by Jan \x{141}ukasiewicz and Richard Taylor. \x{141}ukasiewicz, according to Susan Haack, regarded the problem as the primary motivation for his pioneering work in the metatheory of many-valued logics.2 His 1930 \x{201c}Many-Valued Systems of Propositional Logic\x{201d} includes this concise characterization of a standard form of the problem and its potential implications for logical theory:I can assume without contradiction that my presence in Warsaw at a certain moment of next year, e.g. at <<noon|13>> on 21 December, is at the present time determined neither positively nor negatively. Hence it is possible, but not necessary, that I shall be present in  Warsaw at the given time. On this assumption the proposition \x{2018}I shall be in Warsaw at <<noon|13>> on 21 December of next year,\x{2019} can at the present time be neither true nor false. For if it were true now, my future presence in Warsaw would have to be necessary, which is contradictory to the assumption. If it were false now, on the other hand, my future presence in Warsaw would be impossible, which is also contradictory to the assumption. Therefore the proposition considered is at the moment neither true nor false and must possess a third value, different from \x{2018}0\x{2019} or falsity and \x{2018}1\x{2019} or truth. This value we can designated by \x{2018}\x{bd}.\x{2019} It represents \x{2018}the possible\x{2019} and joins \x{2018}the true\x{2019} and \x{2018}the false\x{2019} as a third value.3",

            "But there is a further distinction to be drawn, that between two at least potentially different types of physical modality. There seems to be a difference between what is just physically possible in general and what is physically possible for a given agent to do in a given set of circumstances. The former might be termed physical possibility simpliciter. It concerns what is and is not consistent with the laws of nature per se. (It is physically impossible simpliciter to travel faster than the speed of light. It is physically necessary simpliciter that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.) The latter type of modality, on the other hand, might be termed situational physical modality. It concerns the modal character of events, actions, and states of affairs, taking into account not only general and unchanging physical laws, but also the situations and circumstances that can affect what is possible and necessary at certain places at certain times. For instance, exactly three weeks ago it was situationally physically possible for me, at3:50pm, to lay both hands on the front wall of Amherst College\x{2019}s Johnson Chapel. Today it is not now possible for me to lay both hands on the Chapel at <<3:50|2>>, because it is now <<3:49|2>>.30, and I am not even in Massachusetts. It is, of course, physically possible simpliciter for a human being to lay hands on our Chapel, and this fact never changes, so long as there are hands and a Johnson Chapel. Any constraints on the physical possibility of touching the chapel would have to be situational constraints.",

            "Given this, we might first wonder why Taylor has never publicly applied such considerations to his original \x{201c}Fatalism\x{201d}-problem, and then be tempted to say that the Smith problem itself can be solved simply by making explicit the times and situations with respect to which the two contradictory physical-modal statements, \x{201c}Smith can arrive at <<4:00|2>>\x{201d} and \x{201c}Smith cannot arrive at <<4:00|2>>,\x{201d} are to be evaluated. Let\x{2019}s look at the second statement first. Recall that physical possibility is to be understood in terms of physical compatibility among situations-at-times. \x{201c}Smith cannot arrive at <<4:00|2>>\x{201d} is true, then, with respect to what time-and-situation? We look around for some situation-at-a-time that would stand in an appropriate causal relation to Smith\x{2019}s potential flight to the city\x{2014}the only way in the case he  can arrive at <<4:00|2>>\x{2014}with which such a flight, and so such an arrival-at-4: 00, would be incompatible. The relevant modally-limiting situation is easily seen here to be the situation in which Smith did not in fact leave on the plane at <<3:30|2>>. We can assume that there was an interval greater than one moment when Smith could have boarded the plane, but let\x{2019}s suppose that the very first moment when such an option was no longer open to him, the moment when the plane\x{2019}s doors closed and its engines revved, was the moment: <<3:30|2>>:19.97. It appears reasonable to say that, with respect to any temporal point at or after this moment, as T and L cook the case, it is not physically possible that Smith arrives at <<4:00|2>>, so that the proposition: (<<3:30|2>>:19.97 (~\x{25ca}4:00 Smith arrives)) appears to be true.",

            "This claim seems very strange when read alongside Taylor\x{2019}s own position in \x{201c}Fatalism.\x{201d} And under this essay\x{2019}s analysis of physical possibility the claim is in fact not true. Under this essay\x{2019}s analysis, it is quite possible at t1 that any number of things happen at t2, all but one of which will not actually happen at t2. My analysis yields only  the conclusion that, at t2, it is not physically possible for something both to happen-at-t2 and not-happen-at t2. Given the actual situation that obtains at, say, <<3:30|2>>:19.95, it is at this time both physically possible that Smith boards at <<3:30|2>>:19.96 and physically possible that Smith does not board at <<3:30|2>>:19.96, because neither event-at-3:30:19.96 is physically incompatible with the actual situation-at-3:30:19.95. Given, though, that an explicit feature of the actual situation-at -<<3:30|2>>:19.96 is Smith not boarding at <<3:30|2>>:19.96, I hold that there is no compatible situation-at-3:30:19.96 in which he boards.

This fact seems to me completely and obviously true, and it\x{2019}s also captured beautifully by this essay\x{2019}s proposed system for properly understanding terms like \x{201c}can.\x{201d} I thus firmly believe that the system J is able to offer a far more satisfactory solution to T and L\x{2019}s own Smith problem than the authors themselves come up with.",

            "This is all pretty standard.

Obviously, I don\x{2019}t mean that the act described is logically impossible (it\x{2019}s perfectly easy to conceive). But I also don\x{2019}t quite mean that the act described violates the laws of nature (touching the Eiffel Tower at <<10 A.M.|5>> is a perfectly ordinary physical act). What I mean is something like: Given the prevailing circumstances now, it is physically impossible for me to touch the Eiffel Tower at  <<10 A.M.|5>> Wallace dubbed this kind of modality \x{201c}situational physical modality.\x{201d} Unlike logical modality and plain-old physical modality, situational physical modality, he observed, is not eternal and unchanging but rather highly sensitive to details of time and place (as the Eiffel Tower example illustrates). This was a critical distinction, Wallace contended, for the notions of necessity and possibility with which the Taylor argument is concerned are those of situational physical modality. Whether it was possible for me to have fired my handgun is a question the fatalist considers by taking into account certain specific physical and temporal circumstances (such as whether we are measuring its temperature before or after the matter of the gun\x{2019}s firing).",
