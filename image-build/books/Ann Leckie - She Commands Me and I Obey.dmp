            "Back in a dim corner stood Her-Breath-Contains-The-Universe\x{2019}s favorite: a woman, rare but not unheard of. Her-Breath-Contains had entered Blue Lily Monastery at the age of four (he was older now, <<nearly twelve|9:0>>) and even then she had attracted his sympathy. She wasn\x{2019}t particularly pretty. She wore no jewels, only the short trousers of a ball player and an undecorated armguard that covered her from wrist to elbow, her hand curled into a fist to hold it in place. She wasn\x{2019}t jumping or crouching, only standing, her arms at her sides, her head tilted just slightly, as though she were listening to a voice only she could hear. But to Her-Breath-Contains she seemed imbued with personality. The name on the pedestal under her feet was She-Commands-Me-And-I-Obey. She had been a friendly face to a small boy missing his nurse, surrounded by strangers in a cold, unfamiliar place.",

  A monk was standing at the door to the White Lily end of the court. Above, the noise of the crowd following the play, and from the court the thwack of the ball hitting the walls, the occasional grunt of a ballplayer. \x{201c}What do you want, brother?\x{201d} asked the White Lily monk.",

He\x{2019}d known from the beginning that someone would die, that at the end of the game he would watch an actual human being killed on the ballcourt, but it had been so abstract. \x{201c}<<Six|9k:0>>!\x{201d} said the novice next to Her-Breath-Contains, in an anguished voice. Six against four. White Lily only needed four points more to win. \x{201c}If we can score next .\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d} This was another moment when the game could be reset.

The noise from both sides of the court was louder than Her-Breath-Contains-The-Universe had ever imagined any sound could be. Everyone, it seemed, was standing, shouting, screaming. Except for the out-system merchant, who might well be preparing to direct his bribes elsewhere. Except the abbot Shall-I-Alone-Escape-Death. Except Tetrarch Qefahl Brend, and the governor of Harime Station. They sat silent and still in their seats.",
