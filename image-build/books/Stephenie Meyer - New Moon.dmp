I smiled back, and something clicked silently into place, like two corresponding puzzle pieces. I\'d forgotten how much I really liked Jacob Black.
He stopped a few feet away from me, and I stared up at him in surprise, leaning my head back though the rain pelted my face.
"You grew again!" I accused in amazement.
He laughed, his smile widening impossibly. "<<Six five|9j>>," he announced with self-satisfaction. His voice was deeper, but it had the husky tone I remembered.',
