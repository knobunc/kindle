            "ON THE DAY THEY WERE GOING TO KILL him, Santiago Nasar got up at <<five-thirty in the morning|5>> to wait for the boat the bishop was coming on. He'd dreamed he was going through a grove of timber trees where a gentle drizzle was falling, and for an instant he was happy in his dream, but when he awoke he felt completely spattered with bird shit. \"He was always dreaming about trees,\" Pl\x{e1}cida Linero, his mother, told me twenty-seven years later, recalling the details of that distressing Monday. \"The week before, he'd dreamed that he was alone in a tinfoil airplane and flying through the almond trees without bumping into anything,\" she said to me. She had a well-earned reputation as an accurate interpreter of other people's dreams, provided they were told her before eating, but she hadn't noticed any ominous augury in those two dreams of her son's, or in the other dreams of trees he'd described to her on the mornings preceding his death.",

            'Nor did Santiago Nasar recognize the omen. He had slept little and poorly, without getting undressed, and he woke up with a headache and a sediment of copper stirrup on his palate, and he interpreted them as the natural havoc of the wedding revels that had gone on until <<after midnight|13>>. Furthermore: all the many people he ran into after leaving his house at <<five minutes past six|10>> and until he was carved up like a pig an hour later remembered him as being a little sleepy but in a good mood, and he remarked to all of them in a casual way that it was a very beautiful day. No one was certain if he was referring to the state of the weather. Many people coincided in recalling that it was a radiant morning with a sea breeze coming in through the banana groves, as was to be expected in a fine February of that period. But most agreed that the weather was funereal, with a cloudy, low sky and the thick smell of still waters, and that at the moment of the misfortune a thin drizzle was falling like the one Santiago Nasar had seen in his dream grove. I was recovering from the wedding revels in the apostolic lap of Maria Alejandrina Cervantes, and I only awakened with the clamor of the alarm bells, thinking they had turned them loose in honor of the bishop.',

            'Victoria Guzman, for her part, had been categorical with her answer that neither she nor her daughter knew that the men were waiting for Santiago Nasar to kill him. But in the course of her years she admitted that both knew it when he came into the kitchen to have his coffee. They had been told it by a woman who had passed by <<after five o\'clock|6>> to beg a bit of milk, and who in addition had revealed the motives and the place where they were waiting. "I didn\'t warn him because I thought it was drunkards\' talk," she told me. Nevertheless, Divina Flor confessed to me on a later visit, after her mother had died, that the latter hadn\'t said anything to Santiago Nasar because in the depths of her heart she wanted them to kill him. She, on the other hand, didn\'t warn him because she was nothing but a frightened child at the time, incapable of a decision of her own, and she\'d been all the more frightened when he grabbed her by the wrist with a hand that felt frozen and stony, like the hand of a dead man.',

            'In those days the legendary paddle-wheelers that burned wood were on the point of disappearing, and the few that remained in service no longer had player pianos or bridal staterooms and were barely able to navigate against the current. But this one was new, and it had two smokestacks instead of one, with the flag painted on them like armbands, and the wheel made of planks at the stern gave it the drive of a seagoing ship. On the upper deck, beside the captain\'s cabin, was the bishop in his white cassock and with his retinue of Spaniards. "It was Christmas weather," my sister Margot said. What happened, according to her, was that the boat whistle let off a shower of compressed steam as it passed by the docks, and it soaked those who were closest to the edge. It was a fleeting illusion: the bishop began to make the sign of the cross in the air opposite the crowd on the pier, and he kept on doing it mechanically afterwards, without malice or inspiration, until the boat was lost from view and all that remained was the uproar of the roosters. Santiago Nasar had reason to feel cheated. He had contributed several loads of wood to the public solicitudes of Father Carmen Amador, and in addition, he himself had chosen the capons with the most appetizing combs. But it was a passing annoyance. My sister Margot, who was with him on the pier, found him in a good mood and with an urge to go on with the festivities in spite of the fact that the aspirins had given him no relief. "He didn\'t seem to be chilly and was only thinking about what the wedding must have cost," she told me. Cristo Bedoya, who was with them, revealed figures that added to his surprise. He\'d been carousing with Santiago Nasar and me until <<a little before four|9c:1>>; he hadn\'t gone to sleep at his parents\', but stayed chatting at his grandparents\' house. There he obtained the bunch of figures that he needed to calculate what the party had cost. He recounted that they had sacrificed forty turkeys and eleven hogs for the guests, and four calves which the bridegroom had set up to be roasted for the people on the public square. He recounted that 205 cases of contraband alcohol had been consumed and almost two thousand bottles of cane liquor, which had been distributed among the crowd. There wasn\'t a single person, rich or poor, who hadn\'t participated in some way in the wildest party the town had ever seen. Santiago Nasar was dreaming aloud.',

            "Many of those who were on the docks knew that they were going to kill Santiago Nasar. Don L\x{e1}zaro Aponte, a colonel from the academy making use of his good retirement, and town mayor for eleven years, waved to him with his fingers. \"I had my own very real reasons for believing he wasn't in any danger anymore,\" he told me. Father Carmen Amador wasn't worried either. \"When I saw him safe and sound I thought it had all been a fib,\" he told me. No one even wondered whether Santiago Nasar had been warned, because it seemed impossible to all that he hadn't. In reality, my sister Margot was one of the few people who still didn't know that they were going to kill him. \"If I'd known, I would have taken him home with me even if I had to hog-tie him,\" she declared to the investigator. It was strange that she hadn't known, but it was even stranger that my mother didn't know either, because she knew about everything before anyone else in the house, in spite of the fact that she hadn't gone out into the street in years, not even to attend mass. I had become aware of that quality of hers ever since I began to get up early for school. I would find her the way she was in those days, pale and stealthy, sweeping the courtyard with a homemade broom in the ashen glow of dawn, and between sips of coffee she would proceed to tell me what had happened in the world while we'd been asleep. She seemed to have secret threads of communication with the other people in town, especially those her age, and sometimes she would surprise us with news so ahead of its time that she could only have known it through powers of divination. That morning, however, she didn't feel the throb of the tragedy that had been gestating since <<three o'clock|6>>. She'd finished sweeping the courtyard, and when my sister Margot went out to meet the bishop she found her grinding manioc for the fritters. \"Cocks could be heard,\" my mother is accustomed to saying, remembering that day. She never associated the distant uproar with the arrival of the bishop, however, but with the last leftovers from the wedding. Our house was a good distance from the main square, in a mango grove on the river. My sister Margot had gone to the docks by walking along the shore, and the people were too excited with the bishop's visit to worry about any other news. They'd placed the sick people in the archways to receive God's medicine, and women came running out of their yards with turkeys and suckling pigs and all manner of things to eat, and from the opposite shore came canoes bedecked with flowers. But after the bishop passed without setting foot on land, the other repressed news assumed its scandalous dimensions. Then it was that my sister Margot learned about it in a thorough and brutal way: Angela Vicario, the beautiful girl who'd gotten married the day before, had been returned to the house of her parents, because her husband had discovered that she wasn't a virgin. \"I felt that I was the one who was going to die,\" my sister said. \"But no matter how much they tossed the story back and forth, no one could explain to me how poor Santiago Nasar ended up being involved in such a mix-up.\" The only thing they knew for sure was that Angela Vicario's brothers were waiting for him to kill him. My sister returned home gnawing at herself inside to keep from crying. She found my mother in the dining room, wearing a Sunday dress with blue flowers that she had put on in case the bishop came by to pay us a call, and she was singing the fado about invisible love as she set the table. My sister noted that there was one more place than usual.",

            "Angela Vicario was the prettiest of the four, and my mother said that she had been born like the great queens of history, with the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck. But she had a helpless air and a poverty of spirit that augured an uncertain future for her. I would see her again year after year during my Christmas vacations, and every time she seemed more destitute in the window of her house, where she would sit in the afternoon making cloth flowers and singing songs about single women with her neighbors. \"She's all set to be hooked,\" Santiago Nasar would tell me, \"your cousin the ninny is.\" Suddenly, a little before the mourning for her sister, I passed her on the street for the first time dressed as a grown \x{2022}woman and with her hair curled, and I could scarcely believe it was the same person. But it was a momentary vision: her penury of spirit had been aggravated with the years. So much so that when it was discovered that Bayardo San Roman wanted to marry her, many people thought it was an outsider's scheming. The family took it not only seriously but with great excitement. Except Pura Vicario, who laid down the condition that Bayardo San Roman should identify himself properly. Up till then nobody knew who he was. His past didn't go beyond that afternoon when he disembarked in his actor's getup, and he was so reserved about his origins that even the most demented invention could have been true. It came to be said that he had wiped out villages and sown terror in Casanare as troop commander, that he had escaped from Devil's Island, that he'd been seen in Pernambuco trying to make a living with a pair of trained bears, and that he'd salvaged the remains of a Spanish galleon loaded with gold in the Windward Passage. Bayardo San Roman put an end to all those conjectures by a simple recourse: he produced his entire family. There were four of them: the father, the mother, and two provocative sisters. They arrived in a Model T Ford with official plates, whose duck-quack horn aroused the streets at <<eleven o'clock in the morning|6>>. His mother, Alberta Simonds, a big mulatto woman from Curacao, who spoke Spanish with a mixture of Papiamento, in her youth had been proclaimed the most beautiful of the two hundred most beautiful women in the Antilles. The sisters, newly come into bloom, were like two restless fillies. But the main attraction was the father: General Petronio San Roman, hero of the civil wars of the past century, and one of the major glories of the Conservative regime for having put Colonel Aureliano Buend\x{ed}a to flight in the disaster of Tucurinca. My mother was the only one who wouldn't go to greet him when she found out who he was. \"It seems all right to me that they should get married,\" she told me. \"But that's one thing and it's something altogether different to shake hands with the man who gave the orders for Gerineldo M\x{e1}rquez to be shot in the back.\" As soon as he appeared in the window of the automobile waving his white hat, everybody recognized him because of the fame of his pictures. He was wearing a wheat-colored linen suit, high-laced cordovan shoes, and gold-rimmed glasses held by a clasp on the bridge of his nose and connected by a chain to a buttonhole in his vest. He wore the Medal of Valor on his lapel and carried a cane with the national shield carved on the pommel. He was the first to get out of the automobile, completely covered with the burning dust of our bad roads, and all he had to do was appear on the running board for everyone to realize that Bayardo San Roman was going to marry whomever he chose. It was Angela Vicario who didn't want to marry him. \"He seemed too much of a man for me,\" she told me. Besides, Bayardo San Roman hadn't even tried to court her, but had bewitched the family with his charm. Angela Vicario never forgot the horror of the night on which her parents and her older sisters with their husbands, gathered together in the parlor, imposed on her the obligation to marry a man whom she had barely seen. The twins stayed out of it. \"It looked to us like woman problems,\" Pablo Vicario told me. The parents' decisive argument was that a family dignified by modest means had no right to disdain that prize of destiny. Angela Vicario only dared hint at the inconvenience of a lack of love, but her mother demolished it with a single phrase:",

            'Santiago Nasar was a man for parties, and he had his best time on the eve of his death calculating the expense of the wedding. He estimated that they\'d set up floral decorations in the church equal in cost to those for fourteen first-class funerals. That precision would haunt me for many years, because Santiago Nasar had often told me that the smell of closed-in flowers had an immediate relation to death for him, and that day he repeated it to me as we went into the church. "I don\'t want any flowers at my funeral," he told me, hardly thinking that I would see to it that there weren\'t any the next day. En route from the church to the Vicarios\' house he drew up the figures for the colored wreaths that decorated the streets, calculated the cost of the music and the rockets, and even the hail of raw rice with which they received us at the party. In the drowsiness of <<noon|13>>, the newly weds made their rounds in the yard. Bayardo San Roman had become our very good friend, a friend of a few drinks, as they said in those days, and he seemed very much at ease at our table. Angela Vicario, without her veil and bridal bouquet and in her sweat-stained satin dress, had suddenly taken on the face of a married woman. Santiago Nasar calculated, and told Bayardo San Roman, that up to then the wedding was costing some nine thousand pesos. It was obvious that Angela took this as an impertinence. "My mother taught me never to talk about money in front of other people, " she told me. Bayardo San Roman, on the other hand, took it very graciously and even with a certain pride.',

            "I had a very confused memory of the festival before I decided to rescue it piece by piece from the memory of others. For years they went on talking in my house about the fact that my father had gone back to playing his boyhood violin in honor of the newly weds, that my sister the nun had danced a merengue in her doorkeeper's habit, and that Dr. Dionisio Iguar\x{e1}n, who was my mother's cousin, had arranged for them to take him off on the official boat so he wouldn't be here the next day when the bishop arrived. In the course of the investigations for this chronicle I recovered numerous marginal experiences, among them the free recollections of Bayardo San Roman's sisters, whose velvet dresses with great butterfly wings pinned to their backs with gold brooches drew more attention than the plumed hat and row of war medals worn by their father. Many knew that in the confusion of the bash I had proposed marriage to Mercedes Barcha as soon as she finished primary school, just as she herself would remind me fourteen years later when we got married. Really, the most intense image that I have always held of that unwelcome Sunday was that of old Poncio Vicario sitting alone on a stool in the center of the yard. They had placed him there thinking perhaps that it was the seat of honor, and the guests stumbled over him, confused him with someone else, moved him so he wouldn't be in the way, and he nodded his snow-white head in all directions with the erratic expression of someone too recently blind, answering questions that weren't directed at him and responding to fleeting waves of the hand that no one was making to him, happy in his circle of oblivion, his shirt cardboard-stiff with starch and holding the lignum vitae cane they had bought him for the party. The formal activities ended at <<six in the afternoon|5>>, when the guests of honor took their leave. The boat departed with all its lights burning, and with a wake of waltzes from the player piano, and for an instant we were cast adrift over an abyss of uncertainty, until we recognized each other again and plunged into the confusion of the bash. The newlyweds appeared a short time later in the open car, making their way with difficulty through the tumult. Bayardo San Roman shot",

Pura Vicario had fallen into a deep sleep, when there was knocking on the door. "They were three very slow knocks," she told my mother, "but they had that strange touch of bad news about them." She told her that she\'d opened the door without turning on the light so as not to awaken anybody and saw Bayardo San Roman in the glow of the street light, his silk shirt unbuttoned and his fancy pants held up by elastic suspenders.

            "\"Before God and before men,\" Pablo Vicario said. \"It was a matter of honor.\" Furthermore, with the reconstruction of the facts, they had feigned a much more unforgiving bloodthirstiness than really was true, to such an extreme that it was necessary to use public funds to repair the main door of Placida Linero's house, which was all chipped with knife thrusts. In the panopticon of Riohacha, where they spent three years awaiting trial because they couldn't afford bail, the older prisoners remembered them for their good character and sociability, but they never noticed any indication of remorse in them. Still, in reality it seemed that the Vicario brothers had done nothing right with a view to killing Santiago Nasar immediately and without any public spectacle, but had done much more than could be imagined to have someone to stop them from killing him, and they had failed. According to what they told me years later, they had begun by looking for him at Maria Alejandrina Cervantes's place, where they had been with him until <<two o'clock|6>>. That fact, like many others, was not reported in the brief. Actually, Santiago Nasar was no longer there at the time the twins said they went looking for him, because we'd left on a round of serenades, but in any case, it wasn't certain that they'd gone. \"They never would have left here,\" Maria Alejandrina Cervantes told me, and knowing her so well, I never doubted it. On the other hand, they did go to wait for him at Clotilde Armenta's place, where they knew that almost everybody would turn up except Santiago Nasar. \"It was the only place open,\" they declared to the investigator. \"Sooner or later he would have to come out,\" they told me, after they had been absolved. Still, everybody knew that the main door of Pl\x{e1}cida Linero's house was always barred on the inside, even during the daytime, and that Santiago Nasar always carried the keys to the back door with him. That was where he went in when he got home, in fact, while the Vicario twins had been waiting for him for more than an hour on the other side, and if he later left by the door on the square when he went to receive the bishop, it was for such an unforeseen reason that the investigator who drew up the brief never did understand it.",

It seemed impossible to Clotilde Armenta that they didn't know in the house across the way. She didn't think that Santiago Nasar was there, since she hadn't seen the bedroom light go on, and she asked all the people she could to warn him when they saw him. She even sent word to Father Amador through the novice on duty, who came to buy milk for the nuns. <<After four o'clock|6>>, when she saw the lights in the kitchen of Pl\x{e1}cida Linero's house, she sent the last urgent message to Victoria Guzman by the beggar woman who came every day to ask for a little milk in the name of charity. When the bishop's boat bellowed, almost everybody was up to receive him and there were very few of us who didn't know that the Vicario twins were waiting for Santiago Nasar to kill him, and, in addition, the reasons were understood down to the smallest detail.",

            'The Vicario brothers would not see that window light up. Santiago Nasar went into the house at <<four-twenty|5b>>, but he didn\'t have to turn on any light to reach his bedroom because the bulb on the stairway stayed lit through the night. He threw himself onto his bed in the darkness and with his clothes on, since he had only an hour in which to sleep, and that was how Victoria Guzman found him when she came up to wake him so he could receive the bishop. We\'d been together at Maria Alejandrina Cervantes\'s until <<after three|9c:1>>, when she herself sent the musicians away and turned out the lights in the dancing courtyard so that her pleasurable mulatto girls could go to bed by themselves and get some rest. They\'d been working without cease for three days, first taking care of the guests of honor in secret, and then turned loose, the doors wide open for those of us still unsated by the wedding bash. Maria Alejandrina Cervantes, about whom we used to say that she would go to sleep only once and that would be to die, was the most elegant and the most tender woman I have ever known, and the most serviceable in bed, but she was also the strictest. She\'d been born and reared here, and here she lived, in a house with open doors, with several rooms for rent and an enormous courtyard for dancing lit by lantern gourds bought in the Chinese bazaars of Paramaribo. It was she who did away with my generation\'s virginity. She taught us much more than we should have learned, but she taught us above all that there\'s no place in life sadder than an empty bed. Santiago Nasar lost his senses the first time he saw her. I warned him: "\'A falcon who chases a warlike crane can only hope for a life of pain. But he didn\'t listen to me, dazzled by Maria Alejandrina Cervantes\'s illusory calls. She was his mad passion, his mistress of tears at the age of fifteen, until Ibrahim Nasar drove him out of the bed with a whip and shut him up for more than a year on The Divine Face. Ever since then they were still linked by a serious affection, but without the disorder of love, and she had so much respect for him that she never again went to bed with anyone if he was present. During those last vacations she would send us off early with the pretext that she was tired, but she left the door unbarred and with a lamp lighted in the hall so that I could come in secretly. Santiago Nasar had an almost magical talent for disguises, and his favorite sport was to confuse the identities of the mulatto girls. He would rifle the wardrobe of some to disguise the others, so that they all ended up feeling different from themselves and like the ones they weren\'t. On a certain occasion, one of them found herself repeated in another with such exactness that she had an attack of tears. "I felt like I\'d stepped out of the mirror," she said. But that night Maria Alejandrina Cervantes wouldn\'t let Santiago Nasar indulge himself for the last time in his tricks as a transformer, and she prevented it with such flimsy pretexts that the bad taste left by that memory changed his life. So we took the musicians with us for a round of serenades, and we continued the party on our own, while the Vicario twins were waiting for Santiago Nasar to kill him. It was he who got the idea, at <<almost four o\'clock|6>>, to go up the widower Xius\'s hill and sing for the newly weds.',

An instant after he\'d gone to bed, Victoria Guzman got the message from Clotilde Armenta sent via the milk beggar. At <<five-thirty|5b>> she followed his orders to wake him, but she didn\'t send Divina Flor and went up to the bedroom herself with the suit of pure linen, because she never missed a chance to keep her daughter away from the claws of the seigneur.',

            "My brother doesn't remember it. \"But even if I did remember, I wouldn't have believed it,\" he told me many times. \"Who the fuck would ever think that the twins would kill anyone, much less with a pig knife!\" Then they asked him where Santiago Nasar was, because they'd seen the two of them together, and my brother didn't remember his own answer either. But Clotilde Armenta and the Vicario brothers were so startled when they heard it that it was left established in the brief in separate declarations. According to them, my brother said: \"Santiago Nasar is dead.\" Then he delivered an episcopal blessing, stumbled over the threshold, and staggered out. In the middle of the square he crossed paths with Father Amador, who was going to the dock in his vestments, followed by an acolyte ringing the bell and several helpers carrying the altar for the bishop's field mass. The Vicario brothers crossed themselves when they saw them pass. Clotilde Armenta told me that they'd lost their last hopes when the priest passed by her place. \"I thought he hadn't got my message,\" she said. Nonetheless, Father Amador confessed to me many years later, retired from the world in the gloomy Calafell Rest Home, that he had in fact received Clotilde Armenta's message and others more peremptory while he was getting ready to go the docks. \"The truth is I didn't know what to do,\" he told me. \"My first thought was that it wasn't any business of mine but something for the civil authorities, but then I made up my mind to say something in passing to Pl\x{e1}cida Linero.\" Yet when he crossed the square, he'd forgotten completely. \"You have to understand,\" he told me, \"that the bishop was coming on that unfortunate day.\" At the moment of the crime he felt such despair and was so disgusted with himself that the only thing he could think of was to ring the fire alarm. My brother Luis Enrique entered the house through the kitchen door, which my mother left unlocked so my father wouldn't hear us come in. He went to the bathroom before going to bed, but he fell asleep sitting on the toilet, and when my brother Jaime got up to go to school he found him stretched out face down on the tile floor and singing in his sleep. My sister the nun, who wasn't going to wait for the bishop because she had an eighty-proof hangover, couldn't get him to wake up. \"It was striking <<five|11>> when I went to the bathroom,\" she told me. Later, when my sister Margot went in to bathe before going to the docks, she managed with great effort to drag him to his bedroom. From the other side of sleep he heard the first bellows of the bishop's boat without awakening. Then he fell into a deep sleep, worn out by his carousing, until my sister the nun rushed into the bedroom, trying to put her habit on as she ran, and woke him up with her mad cry:",

            'The room was ten feet square, and had a very high skylight with iron bars, a portable latrine, a washstand with its pitcher and basin, and two makeshift beds with straw mats. Colonel Aponte, under whose orders it had been built, said that no hotel existed that was more humane. My brother Luis Enrique agreed, because one night they\'d locked him up after a fight among musicians, and the mayor allowed him the charity of having one of the mulatto girls stay with him. Perhaps the Vicario brothers could have thought the same thing at <<eight o\'clock in the morning|6>>, when they felt themselves safe from the Arabs. At that moment they were comforted by the honor of having done their duty, and the only thing that worried them was the persistence of the smell. They asked for lots of water, laundry soap, and rags, and they washed the blood from their arms and faces, and they also washed their shirts, but they couldn\'t get any rest. Pedro Vicario asked for his laxatives and diuretics and a roll of sterile gauze so he could change his bandage, and he succeeded in having two urinations during the morning. Nevertheless, life was becoming so difficult for him as the day advanced that the smell took second place. At <<two in the afternoon|5>>, when the heaviness of the heat should have melted them, Pedro Vicario couldn\'t stay there lying on the bed, but the same weariness prevented him from standing. The pain in his groin had reached his throat, his urine was shut off, and he suffered the frightful certainty that he wouldn\'t sleep ever again for the rest of his life. "I was awake for eleven months," he told me, and I knew him well enough to know that it was true. He couldn\'t eat any lunch. Pablo Vicario, for his part, ate a little bit of everything they brought him, and fifteen minutes later unloosed a pestilential diarrhea. At <<six in the afternoon|5>>, while they were performing the autopsy on Santiago Nasar\'s corpse, the mayor was summoned urgently because Pedro Vicario was convinced that his brother had been poisoned. "He was turning into water right in front of me," Pedro Vicario told me, "and we couldn\'t get rid of the idea that it was some trick of the Turks." Up till then he\'d overflowed the portable latrine twice and the guard on watch had taken him to the town hall washroom another six times. There Colonel Aponte found him, in the doorless toilet boxed in by the guard, and pouring out water so fluently that it wasn\'t too absurd to think about poison. But they put the idea aside immediately when it was established that he had only drunk the water and eaten the food sent by Pura Vicario. Nonetheless, the mayor was so impressed that he had the prisoners taken to his house under a special guard until the investigating judge came and transferred them to the panoptic prison in Riohacha.',

            "Colonel Aponte, worried by the rumors, visited the Arabs family by family and that time, at least, drew a correct conclusion. He found them perplexed and sad, with signs of mourning on their altars, and some of them sitting on the ground and wailing, but none harbored ideas of vengeance. The reaction that morning had grown out of the heat of the crime, and even the very leaders admitted that in no case would it have gone beyond a beating. Furthermore, it was Susana Abdala, the centenarian matriarch, who recommended the prodigious infusion of passion flowers and absinthe that dried up Pablo Vicario's diarrhea and unleashed at the same time his brother's florid flow. Pedro Vicario then fell into an insomniac drowsiness and his recovered brother earned his first sleep without remorse. That was how Pur\x{ed}sima Vicario found them at <<three o'clock in the morning|6>> on Tuesday when the mayor brought her to say good-bye to them. The whole family left, even the older sisters with their husbands, on Colonel Aponte's initiative. They left without anyone's noticing, sheltered by public exhaustion, while the only survivors of that irreparable day among us who were awake were burying Santiago Nasar. They were leaving until spirits cooled off, according to the mayor's decision, but they never came back. Pura Vicario wrapped the face of the rejected daughter in a cloth so that no one would see the bruises, and she dressed her in bright red so nobody might think she was mourning her secret lover. Before leaving she asked Father Amador to confess her sons in jail, but Pedro Vicario refused, and convinced his brother that they had nothing to repent. They remained alone, and on the day of their transfer to Riohacha they had so far recovered and were so convinced that they were right that they didn't want to be taken out by night, as had happened with the family, but in broad daylight and with their faces showing. Poncio Vicario, the father, died a short time later. \"His moral pain carried him off,\" Angela Vicario told me. When the twins were absolved, they remained in Riohacha, only a day's trip from Manaure, where the family was living. Prudencia Cotes went there to marry Pablo Vicario, who learned to work with precious metals in his father's shop and came to be an elegant goldsmith. Pedro Vicario, without love or a job, re-enlisted in the armed forces three years later, earned his first sergeant's stripes, and one fine morning his patrol went into guerrilla territory singing whorehouse songs and was never heard of again.",

            '"Nobody fucks with me," he said. "Not even my father with his war veteran\'s balls." The mayor informed General Petronio San Roman of the episode, down to the last literal phrase, in an alarming telegram. General San Roman must have followed his son\'s wishes to the letter, because he didn\'t come for him, but sent his wife with their daughters and two other older women who seemed to be her sisters. They came on a cargo boat, locked in mourning up to their necks because of Bayardo San Roman\'s misfortunes, and with their hair hanging loose in grief. Before stepping onto land, they took off their shoes and went barefoot through the streets up to the hilltop in the burning dust of <<noon|13>>, pulling out strands of hair by the roots and wailing loudly with such high-pitched shrieks that they seemed to be shouts of joy. I watched them pass from Magdalena Oliver\'s balcony, and I remember thinking that distress like theirs could only be put on in order to hide other, greater shames.',

She only had to close her eyes to see him, she heard him breathing in the sea, the blaze of his body in bed would awaken her at <<midnight|13>>. Toward the end of that week, unable to get a moment\'s rest, she wrote him the first letter. It was a conventional missive, in which she told him that she\'d seen him come out of the hotel, and that she would have liked it if he had seen her. She waited in vain for a reply. At the end of two months, tired of waiting, she sent him another letter in the same oblique style as the previous one, whose only aim seemed to be to reproach him for his lack of courtesy. Six months later she had written six letters with no reply, but she comforted herself with the certainty that he was getting them. Mis tress of her fate for the first time, Angela Vicario then discovered that hate and love are reciprocal passions. The more letters she sent the more the coals of her fever burned, but the happy rancor she felt for her mother also heated up. "Just seeing her would turn my stomach," she told me, "but I couldn\'t see her without remembering him." Her life as a rejected wife continued on, simple as that of an old maid, still doing machine embroidery with her friends just as before she had made cloth tulips and paper birds, but when her mother went to bed she would stay in the room until dawn writing letters with no future. She became lucid, overbearing, mistress of her own free will, and she became a virgin again just for him, and she recognized no other authority than her own nor any other service than that of her obsession. She wrote a weekly letter for over half a lifetime. "Sometimes I couldn\'t think of what to say," she told me, dying with laughter, "but it was enough for me to know that he was getting them." At first they were a fiancee\'s notes, then they were little messages from a secret lover, perfumed cards from a furtive sweetheart, business papers, love documents, and lastly they were the indignant letters of an abandoned wife who invented cruel illnesses to make him return. One night, in a good mood, she spilled the inkwell over the finished letter and instead of tearing it up she added a postscript:',

She wasn't as sure then as the first time. He asked her about Pl\x{e1}cida Linero, and she answered that just a moment before she'd put her coffee on the night table, but she hadn't awakened her. That's the way it always was: Pl\x{e1}cida Linero would wake up at <<seven|9c:1>>, have her coffee, and come down to give instructions for lunch. Cristo Bedoya looked at the clock: it was six fiftysix. Then he climbed up to the second floor to make sure that Santiago Nasar hadn't come in. The bedroom was locked from the inside, because Santiago Nasar had gone out through his mother's bedroom. Cristo Bedoya not only knew the house as well as his own, but was so much at home with the family that he pushed open the door to Pl\x{e1}cida Linero's bedroom and went from there into the adjoining one. A beam of dusty light was coming in through the skylight, and the beautiful woman asleep on her side in the hammock, her bride's hand on her cheek, had an unreal look. \"It was like an apparition,\" Cristo Bedoya told me. He looked at her for an instant, fascinated by her beauty, and then he crossed the room in silence, passed by the bathroom, and proceeded into Santiago Nasar's bedroom. The bed was still made, and on the chair, well-pressed, were his riding clothes, and on top of the clothes his horseman's hat, and on the floor his boots beside their spurs. On the night table, Santiago Nasar's wristwatch said <<six fifty-eight|5b>>.",

The truth is that they kept the house locked up until very late, like so many others, but they were early-rising and hard-working people. The parents of Santiago Nasar and Flora Miguel had agreed that they should get married. Santiago Nasar accepted the engagement in the bloom of his adolescence, and he was determined to fulfill it, perhaps because he had the same utilitarian concept of matrimony as his father. Flora Miguel, for her part, enjoyed a certain floral quality, but she lacked wit and judgment and had served as bridesmaid for her whole generation, so the agreement was a providential solution for her. They had an easy engagement, without formal visits or restless hearts. The wedding, postponed several times, was finally set for the following Christmas.',
