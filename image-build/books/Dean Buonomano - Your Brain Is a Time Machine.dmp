            "How good is the circadian clock, and how does it compare to man-made clocks? The performance of clocks, whether of the biological or man-made variety, can be measured by both their precision and their accuracy. Precision refers to the average deviation over many cycles of the oscillator, while accuracy refers to how close the average period is to some target or desired period. If the swing of a pendulum should be 1 sec, but its mean period is 0.8 seconds, it is not very accurate (off by 20 percent). But if over tens of thousands of swings the minimal and maximal period remain between 0.79999 and 0.80001 seconds, it is nevertheless very precise. As can be seen from Figure 3.1, the period of the circadian clock is not exactly 24 hours, but naturally cycles with a period closer to <<23.5 hours|1>>. Thus, in relation to the time it takes our planet to complete a single spin, the circadian clock is reasonably accurate\x{2014}a period of <<23.5 hours|1>> is off by 2 percent. Nocturnal animals generally have circadian clocks with a period shorter than 24 hours, while diurnal creatures, such as humans, tend to have circadian clocks with intrinsic periods slightly longer than 24 hours. The precision of the circadian clock is more impressive. We can see this in Figure 3.1 by noting that the shift in activity to earlier and earlier times is more or less the same each day (different rows). Studies show that across days in constant darkness, the standard deviation of when the mouse starts running can be as low as 10 to 20 minutes, a precision of approximately 1 percent of the clock\x{2019}s 23.5 hour period.",

            "One of the early approaches toward answering this question was to ask if changes in the duration of the circadian period produced during free-running isolation experiments altered people\x{2019}s ability to time shorter intervals. In one set of experiments, the volunteers were asked to press a button every time they thought one hour had elapsed. During a 16-hour awake period, one subject estimated an hour to be approximately 2 hours, and during a 44-hour awake period, his estimate of one hour was close to <<3.5 hours|1>>. Overall, there was a correlation between the length of individuals\x{2019} circadian period and their estimate of an hour. From this one might conclude that the circadian clock is used to tell all intervals of time, including shorter intervals like the beat of a song or the duration of a traffic light. This, however, is not the case. When asked to press a button for durations ranging from 10 to 120 seconds, there was no significant relationship with the duration of the individual\x{2019}s sleep-wake cycle. The absence of any relationship between the circadian period and temporal judgments on the scale of seconds to a few minutes is consistent with a large body of work that shows we have distinct circuits devoted to telling time across different scales. For example, experiments in rodents reveal that the mutations that perturb the circadian clock, or lesions to the suprachiasmatic nucleus, do not alter their ability to time events on the scale of seconds.

Typically volunteers will sit at a computer and make judgments about the duration of images or sounds. In a study led by the cognitive neuroscientist Virginie van Wassenhove a reference stimulus was a static circle displayed on the screen for 500 ms (a half second). The same circle was then presented for either a shorter or longer period of time. Subjects were asked to report whether this comparison stimulus was longer or shorter than the reference stimulus by pressing one of two keys. Under such conditions, subjects tend to be fairly accurate\x{2014}that is, when the comparison stimulus lasts 450 ms they tended to correctly report it as shorter than the 500 ms circle, and when it was <<550|3:1>> ms, they generally reported it as longer than the reference. So the perceived duration of the comparison stimulus is fairly accurate. However, if the comparison stimulus becomes a looming circle\x{2014}one growing in size\x{2014}while the reference stimulus remains static, an illusion emerges, a form of chronostasis or time dilation.

            "Before we go on, it should be noted that statements about time slowing down, flying by, dragging, dilating, or speeding up can be very confusing\x{2014}particularly when one makes the mistake of stopping to think about what such statements actually mean. Take the phrase time flew by. Does this imply that a clock on the wall seems to be going faster or slower? If someone reports that time flew by, does this mean he would accomplish less or more in a given window of objective clock time? Statements about time speeding up or flying by are inherently ambiguous. Slower and faster are relative adjectives; thus, much like saying something is to your right or left, you must provide a point of reference. When talking about temporal distortions people generally mean that external time changes in relation to a hypothetical internal clock. Let\x{2019}s assume that this imaginary internal clock governs our prospective judgments of time in the range of milliseconds, seconds, and minutes, and that this clock ticks ten times a second. So if it were to be sped up to twenty ticks per second in response to a threat or drugs, the result is that during a five-second period, one would be left with the impression that ten seconds had elapsed. Such a speeding up of the internal clock would generally be described as \x{201c}time slowing down,\x{201d} \x{201c}dragging,\x{201d} or \x{201c}dilating\x{201d} because we are being self-centered: we are using our internal clock as the reference and noting that external time appears to be slowing down. This account, of course, depends on the chosen clock of reference: one could also claim that time is speeding up because the internal clock is going faster than the external clock. For better or worse, however, the convention is that statements about time speeding up or slowing down refer to the apparent speed of an external clock in relation to a hypothetical internal clock\x{2014}even though it is obviously the internal clock that is actually doing the slowing or speeding. It is not uncommon to see instances in the media and popular and scientific literature in which people mistakenly state that time is slowing down when they mean speeding up. Consider the cartoon in Figure 4.1: if THC, the active component of hashish and marijuana, creates the perception of external time slowing down or dragging (consistent with William James\x{2019}s observation and experimental evidence)\x{2014}equivalent to having the internal clock speed up\x{2014}then shouldn\x{2019}t the cowboy in the figure find the clock to be <<before noon|13>>? More generally, it is important to note that our feeling of how quickly or slowly time is passing is not necessarily equivalent to our explicit estimates of how many seconds or minutes have elapsed (I may estimate that I was in the dentist\x{2019}s chair for five minutes, but report that it felt like an hour).",

            "The best-studied chronopharmacological effect on timing in animals involves manipulating the brain\x{2019}s dopamine system. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter, and a modulator of many different brain processes. Most notably, it is damage to a cluster of dopamine-producing neurons located in the brain stem (the substantia nigra) that produces the characteristic tremors and motor deficits of Parkinson\x{2019}s disease. The Duke University psychologist Warren Meck and his colleagues have proposed that dopamine might alter the speed of the timing circuits within the brain. For example, his experiments have shown that after training rats with a fixed interval of 20 sec, the administration of the stimulant methamphetamine\x{2014}which among other effects increases dopamine levels within the brain\x{2014}can shift the timing of lever pressing from <<approximately 20 to 17|10>> sec; but after days of repeatedly performing the task while on methamphetamines, the rats slowly readjusted their timing back to 20 sec\x{2014}as if they learned to work with a chronically fast internal clock by recalibrating the number of internal ticks that correspond to 20 seconds. Furthermore, when the rats were taken off the drug, they overshot: the peak timing of the lever pressing increased to above 20 sec.",

Infant-directed speech is often characterized by an increase in pitch, longer vowels, and longer pauses between words. For example, studies show that when adults are talking among themselves, the pauses between phrases are <<around 700|18:0>> milliseconds, but when adults are speaking to babies this value increases to over a second. Studies also confirm that like adults attempting to learn a new language, infants are better able to discriminate words when they are spoken in the slowed, overemphasized, prosody of motherese. Slower speech helps babies and adults parse speech: to learn where one word begins and the other ends, to prevent consecutive phonemes from interfering with each other.

One of the first studies to systematically address this question was performed at the University of California, San Francisco, by Beverly Wright, myself, and our colleagues Henry Mahncke and Michael Merzenich. We used a standard interval-discrimination task in which subjects heard two different intervals and were asked to decide whether the first or the second interval was the longer. In this task, each interval was bounded by two brief tones (15 ms each). Thus, the first interval might consist of the two tones separated by a standard interval of 100 ms, while the second, so-called comparison interval, might consist of two tones separated by <<125|3:0>> ms (Figure 5.1). The difference between the standard and comparison interval, in this case 25 ms, is referred to as delta-t (\x{2206}t). If, presented with intervals of 100 and 125 milliseconds, the participant always correctly identifies the longer interval, we can conclude that her internal timer has a resolution of better (less) than 25 milliseconds.",

Note that if we believe the brain has some sort of generic neural stopwatch responsible for timing all intervals between 50 and 500 ms, and that this stopwatch somehow becomes more accurate with practice, we would expect that timing of all intervals would improve, even though the volunteers only practiced on the <<100|3c>> ms. In contrast, if the brain uses specialized timers, then we would predict that the improvements on the <<100|3c>> ms standard interval would not generalize to the other intervals. This was indeed the case. Although ten days of practice on the <<100|3c>> ms intervals dramatically improved people\x{2019}s ability to discriminate intervals <<around 100|18:0>> ms, it did not improve the interval discrimination thresholds for the 50, 200, or 500 ms intervals at all. If learning on the <<100|3c>> ms interval came from improved focus, then subjects would likely improve on all intervals, but we did not observe that. More importantly, this result, which has since been replicated in numerous other studies, suggests that however the brain is telling time in the subsecond range, it does not seem to be via any sort of master stopwatch mechanism that can time any and all intervals.",

            "As in speech and music, there is a temporal hierarchy of elements within a bird\x{2019}s song. Notes are combined to form syllables, and a sequence of syllables forms the phrases within a song. A given syllable can last up to a few hundred milliseconds, the pauses between syllables generally last less than 100 ms, and an entire song can carry on for seconds. The brains of male and female zebra finches are quite different: the males have a number of brain areas that are critical to song learning and production (the females do not sing). One such nucleus is referred to as HVC (which stands for nothing\x{2014}don\x{2019}t ask). This nucleus is at least in part responsible for the timing of a zebra finch\x{2019}s song. Neurons in HVC fire at specific times during the song\x{2014}for example one neuron might fire 100 milliseconds into a phrase, while another may fire <<around 500|18:0>> milliseconds in. We can think of these neurons as forming a neuronal chain in which neuron A activates B which activates C . . . (Figure 5.2). The result is that once neuron A fires we have a domino effect of neuronal activation A\x{2192}B\x{2192}C\x{2192}D\x{2192}E (in reality it is best to think of each link in this chain as a group of neurons rather than a single neuron). This is like using a chain of falling dominos as a timer: if the dominos are arranged in the same position time and time again, and each domino takes 100 milliseconds to fall, then we know that <<approximately 500|18:0>> milliseconds have elapsed when the fifth domino falls, and 1 second has passed when the tenth domino falls, . . . . Similarly, as we will examine in more detail in the next chapter, one theory is that in some cases the brain tells time by determining which neurons in a chain are currently active. Neurons in HVC indeed seem to use such a mechanism to control the timing of the notes of a bird\x{2019}s song. But one of the chronic challenges in neuroscience is to distinguish between correlation and causation\x{2014}just because neurons in HVC seem to be responsible for singing does not mean they actually are. As one approach toward addressing this correlation-versus-causation question, the neuroscientists Michael Long and Michale Fee, both at MIT at the time, reasoned that if HVC neurons were causing the timing of the song, then if the pattern of activity of those neurons was slowed down, the birds should sing in slow motion.",

            "I have proposed that short-term synaptic plasticity and other time-dependent neuronal properties may contribute to the brain\x{2019}s ability to tell time on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. Consider the simplest neural circuit possible: two neurons connected by a single synapse (Figure 6.3). Let\x{2019}s assume that the presynaptic neuron fires at one of three different temporal patterns: two spikes separated by an interval of either 50, 100, or 200 milliseconds. We can think of these intervals as temporal stimuli\x{2014}indeed, some animals communicate with \x{201c}clicks,\x{201d} brief bursts of sounds in which the interval between the clicks conveys information. For each of these three intervals, the voltage change produced by the first spike will be the same\x{2014}and we will assume that the \x{201c}strength\x{201d} of this spike is 1 millivolt. Because of short-term synaptic plasticity the strength of that same synapse will be different at the time of the second spike. Specifically, the change in voltage produced by the second spike of a 50 ms interval may be 1.5 millivolts, while the strength of the second spike of 100 and 200 ms might be <<1.25|5a:0>> and 1.1 millivolts respectively. If we construct the properties of our circuit so that the postsynaptic neuron only fires when it receives an input of at least 1.5 millivolts, then we would have constructed a timer of sorts\x{2014}a neuron that only fires when it receives two inputs 50 milliseconds apart.",

            "Computer models show that neural networks composed of recurrently connected neurons can create a continuously evolving pattern of activity\x{2014}that is, those patterns that are potentially well suited to encode time. The problem is that such patterns are often not reproducible\x{2014}indeed such networks often behave chaotically. Mathematically speaking, the term chaos is used to describe systems that are highly sensitive to noise and initial conditions (the state of the system at the start of a given trial). The classic example is the weather and the so-called butterfly effect: a tiny event at some point in space and some moment of time, such as a butterfly beating its wings in the Amazon at <<12 noon|13>> on February 1, can produce a domino effect that changes the weather in New York City a week later. Chaos is often observed in nonlinear physical systems that feed back onto themselves, including the weather or billiard balls. Networks of neurons epitomize both of these conditions. First, neurons are nonlinear\x{2014}that is, the output of a neuron is not linearly proportional to the input it receives. Second, as mentioned, cortical networks are characterized by a high degree of feedback or recurrency\x{2014}that is, what one neuron does at time t=1 will influence what other neurons do at t=2, which in turn will influence what the first neuron does at t=3.",

            "Throughout the fifties and early sixties, aboveground atomic bomb testing, mostly by the United States and the Soviet Union, almost doubled the amount of the carbon radioisotope 14C in the atmosphere. These levels peaked in 1963, the time of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and began to decline thereafter. These increases in atmospheric 14C were mirrored in all living organisms, because through photosynthesis plants incorporate carbon into their biochemical pathways, and since the carbon in our bodies comes from plants, atomic bomb testing produced detectable increases of 14C in human DNA. The carbon atoms incorporated into DNA when a cell is \x{201c}born\x{201d} (through the division of a precursor cell) can remain in its DNA throughout the life of the cell. So if new neurons are never formed in adults, the neurons of someone born before the atomic bomb testing era should have low levels of 14C today. But if the neurons continue to divide, some of them will have incorporated higher levels, due to the increase in 14C from the late fifties onward. Investigators in Sweden analyzed postmortem brain tissue and found that the great majority of neurons from people born <<before 1955|18:1>> had low levels of 14C in their DNA. That is, most neurons were not formed during adulthood. But as predicted from the animal data, there were higher levels of 14C in a subpopulation of neurons in the hippocampus, proving that some adult neurogenesis can occur in humans. This strange intersection between neuroscience and nuclear proliferation and the use of radioactive carbon as a retroactive clock was instrumental in overturning the accepted dogma that new neurons are never formed in adult humans.",

            'The principle behind radiodating relies on one of the simplest possible ways to tell time: chance. Imagine that there are one thousand people being held captive inside a casino, and that each of them has ten coins. The cruel but statistically inclined captors tell them that their only path to freedom is for a toss of all ten coins to come up with ten heads. If each person were to take an average of one minute for a round of tosses, then based on the number of hostages currently in the room we can estimate how much time has elapsed. Clearly the fewer people in the room, the more time has passed; furthermore, since we can calculate the probability of tossing ten heads, we can estimate the amount of time that has passed. When tossing ten coins, the probability all ten of them will come up heads is 1 in 210 (1/1024). From this number it is possible to calculate that it should take 710 rounds for half the people to gain their freedom: 710 minutes, or <<11 hours and 50 minutes|14>>. So every twelve hours or so the number of people in the room should drop by a half: if we see 250 people in the room, it is likely that they have been locked up for close to a day.',

In one such catastrophic accident, in 1707, the British admiral Sir Clowdisley Shovell sailed his fleet onto the Scilly Isles. Four of his five ships, along with approximately two thousand men, were lost. In part as a consequence of this tragedy, Queen Anne of England established the Longitude Act in 1714, and offered a monetary prize of over a million in today\x{2019}s dollars to anyone who invented a method to accurately calculate longitude at sea.",

            "Others believe that time is merely an abstraction, a very useful concept to help explain how the universe works, but unlike mass or energy, time would not be a fundamental ingredient of physics. To understand this view a bit better, recall that, in practice, clock time is always measured by change. No matter how accurate or inaccurate, clocks are always quantifying change of some physical phenomenon. The consequence of this fact is that it is always possible to express time as some other nontemporal physical measure. For example, quartz clocks and watches often mark the time with dials that revolve around a circular face, and when the minute hand goes from <<12 to 6|10a:1>> we say 30 minutes have passed; but couldn\x{2019}t we just as well say 180 degrees have passed? Or in the case of a pendulum clock with a base frequency of 1 Hz, instead of saying 30 minutes have passed, we could say 1,800 swings have elapsed. Indeed, the standard unit of time (the second) is not actually defined as some pure unit of time, but instead as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation corresponding to the resonant frequency of cesium 133, which is approximately equivalent to how long it takes the earth to spin 1/240 of a degree around its axis. A hundred and twenty-six of these seconds correspond to the amount of time it took downhill skiers to change their position from the top to the bottom of the mountain during the 2014 Winter Olympics. The point is, clock time can be seen as a convention by which we standardize change. Time provides an incredibly useful way to establish equivalent relationships between the rate of change of different physical systems (adherents of this view are sometimes referred to as relationalists). As the physicist Ernst Mach put it in the nineteenth century: \x{201c}It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time. Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction, at which we arrive by means of the changes of things.\x{201d}",

As the tip of your train whizzes by me, you shoot two pistols, the bullets of which also travel at <<100|3:1>> m/s: one bullet is heading towards the window in the front of the train, and the other towards the back window.

There are numerous studies that suggest this is indeed possible. These types of experiments are only feasible as a result of one of the standard treatments of severe epilepsy. Patients who suffer from intractable epilepsy sometimes undergo a surgical procedure aimed at removing the part of the brain responsible for triggering the seizures. To precisely locate the epileptic focus, neurosurgeons implant electrodes in the brain and wait until the patient has a seizure. By recording the neural activity during a seizure, they are able to accurately target the pathological area for surgical removal. In the name of science, patients often agree to participate in experiments while the electrodes are implanted and doctors are awaiting seizure activity. In a study led by the UCLA neurosurgeon Itzhak Fried, electrodes were implanted in an area of the frontal lobe called the supplementary motor area. The patients were asked to perform a very simple task: to exercise their \x{201c}free will\x{201d} by pressing a computer key whenever they wanted too. Many neurons changed their level of activity well before the button was pressed. Indeed, based on the activity of a population of neurons it was possible to predict that a patient was about to move a finger with an accuracy of over 80 percent, a full 900 ms before the key was pressed (and 700 ms before the patients reported being aware of having decided to move). Note that 900 ms is more than enough time for the brain to execute a finger movement; for example, if you were asked to press a computer key as soon as you saw a flash of light, the delay between the flash and the key press would be <<around 300|18:1>> ms. Amazingly, these studies suggest that it was possible for the experimenters to know the person was about to press the key before the volunteer was aware he was going to press the key.",

<<2:00|2>>: THE BEST TIME MACHINE YOU\x{2019}LL EVER OWN
1Apparently there are a few true time-travel antecedents to The Time Machine, including the Spanish author Enrique Gaspard\x{2019}s book El Anacron\x{f3}pete. I should stress that my knowledge of the literature is highly limited, and I certainly did not conduct an exhaustive search of the history of time travel in fiction. So there are likely some exceptions to the statement that true time travel only emerged in the late nineteenth century.",

            '14The first papers to describe spike-timing-dependent plasticity were Debanne et al., 1994; Markram et al., 1997; Bi and Poo, 1998, but previous work in the 1980s had hit upon similar principles (Levy and Steward, 1983). In practice, there are many different versions of the STDP rule. But in general the degree of potentiation or depression at any given interval can vary dramatically, and there is generally an asymmetry, meaning the degree of potentiation and depression at the same absolute interval is different (Abbott and Nelson, 2000; Karmarkar et al., 2002).

<<5:00|2>>: PATTERNS IN TIME
1Speech is highly redundant, meaning that there are generally many different cues that allow us to disambiguate ambiguous phrases. And in natural speech timing is only one of these cues; context and intonation are others. For papers that examine the role of temporal cues in speech see: Lehiste, 1960; Lehiste et al., 1976; Aasland and Baum, 2003; Schwab et al., 2008.',

            "18Many researchers have reported approximately linear increases in firing rate over time during timed motor tasks\x{2014}tasks in which an animal makes a response after a stimulus is presented for a fixed amount of time (Quintana and Fuster, 1992; Leon and Shadlen, 2003; Mita et al., 2009; Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015). But a study led by Michael Shadlen has suggested that these ramping patterns of activity might be best thought of as the preparation for the motor response, rather than the timer per se (although the two are often tightly correlated). For example, at the beginning of a race there may be three commands, READY \x{2013} SET \x{2013} GO. At the SET command, runners might start creating an expectation of when to take off, each passing moment increasing the likelihood that the GO signal will occur. Ramping neurons may encode such time-dependent expectations, which is a bit different from tracking actual time, because if animals are trained to expect a GO signal at <<approximately 0.15|3:1>> or 1.8 seconds, the ramping cell activity goes up and down according to expectation, not according to absolute time (Janssen and Shadlen, 2005).",

Here the point is that given the abstract and mathematical representations of time as a dimension much like space, perhaps we are biased toward eternalism because humans seem to conceptualize time in terms of space.
