Some effort had been made to find out when, exactly, the proofs had been taken from the Library. The person in the far bay had been found, and turned out to have been Miss Burrows, the Librarian. She, however, said that she had not seen Miss Hillyard, who had come in after her and gone to lunch before her. Nor had she seen, or at any rate noticed, the proofs lying on the table. The Library had not been very much used on the Saturday afternoon; but a student who had gone in there at <<about 3 o\x{2019}clock|6>> to consult Ducange\x{2019}s Late Latin Dictionary, in the bay where Miss Hillyard had been working, had said that she had taken the volume down and laid it on the table, and she thought that if the proofs had been there, she would have noticed them. This student was a Miss Waters, a second-year French student and a pupil of Miss Shaw\x{2019}s.",

            "On the evening after her formal introduction to Miss Newland, however, Harriet encountered Mr. Pomfret accidentally. She had been to see an old Shrewsburian who was attached to the Somerville Senior Common Room, and was crossing St. Giles on her way back, <<shortly before midnight|13>>, when she was aware of a group of young men in evening dress, standing about one of the trees which adorn that famous thoroughfare. Being naturally inquisitive, Harriet went to see what was up. The street was practically deserted, except for through traffic of the ordinary kind. The upper branches of the tree were violently agitated, and Harriet, standing on the outskirts of the little group beneath, learned from their remarks that Mr. Somebody-or-the-other had undertaken, in consequence of an after-dinner bet, to climb every tree in St. Giles without interference from the Proctor. As the number of trees was large and the place public, Harriet felt the wager to be rather optimistic. She was just turning away to cross the street in the direction of the Lamb and Flag, when another youth, who had evidently been occupying an observation-post, arrived, breathless, to announce that the Proggins was just coming into view round the corner of Broad Street. The climber came down rather hastily, and the group promptly scattered in all directions\x{2014}some running past her, some making their way down side-streets, and a few bold spirits fleeing towards the small enclosure known as the Fender, within which (since it belongs not to the Town but to St. John\x{2019}s) they could play at tig with the Proctor to their hearts\x{2019} content. One of the young gentlemen darting in this general direction passed Harriet close, stopped with an exclamation, and brought up beside her.",

I\x{2019}d been lunching with some chaps out Iffley way, and we were just pulling over to put one of \x{2019}em down at Magdalen, when I spotted her. She was walking along, muttering to herself, and looking awfully queer. Sort of clutching with her hands and rolling her eyes about. She spotted me, too. Couldn\x{2019}t mistake her. A friend of mine was driving and I tried to catch his attention, but he was pulling round behind a bus and I couldn\x{2019}t make him understand. Anyhow, when we stopped at Magdalen gate, I hopped out and ran back, but I couldn\x{2019}t find her anywhere. Seemed to have faded out. I bet she knew I was on to her and made tracks. I was scared. Thought she looked up to anything. So I rang up your place and found you were out and then I rang up the Mitre and that wasn\x{2019}t any good either, so I\x{2019}ve been sitting here all evening in a devil of a stew. First I thought I\x{2019}d leave a note, and then I thought I\x{2019}d better tell you myself. Rather devoted of me, don\x{2019}t you think? I cut a supper-party so as not to miss you.\x{201d}",

Of course, she had had her afternoon off with Beatie and Carola \x{2026}Curious, thought Harriet, this desire to possess children and dictate their tastes, as though they were escaping fragments of one\x{2019}s self, and not separate individuals. Even if the taste ran to motor-bikes \x{2026}Annie was all right. How about Miss de Vine, traveling down from Town in happy ignorance?\x{2014}With a start, Harriet saw that it was <<nearly a quarter to ten|10>>. The train must be in.

Well, of course, the first thing was that the lights wouldn\x{2019}t go on; and then to her horror she heard you, my dear, snorting on the floor in the dark.

Well, you know what a job it is tracking anybody down in this place, and we hunted and hunted and nobody had seen anything of her.
