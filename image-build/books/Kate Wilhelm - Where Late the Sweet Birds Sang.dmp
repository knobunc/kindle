            '"Okay, Walt, you get in my bed," David said, almost resentfully. "I\'ll go down to the lab, get things rolling there. I\'ll come up for you at <<six thirty|5b>>." Walt didn\'t protest, but fell onto the bed without bothering to take off his shoes. David pulled them off. Walt\'s socks were more holes than not, but probably they kept his ankles warm. David left them on, pulled the blanket over him, and went to the lab.',

            'At <<seven|9m>> the hospital cafeteria was crowded when Walt stood up to make his announcement. First he had Avery Handley run down his log of diminishing shortwave contacts, with the accompanying grim stories of plague, famine, disease, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and sterility. It was the same story worldwide. They listened apathetically; they could not care any longer what was happening to any part of the world that was not their small part. Avery finished and sat down once more.',

Coffee will be served now, and I understand we have cakes and sandwiches." He jumped from the table and left before any of them could catch up with him, and he and David hurried to the cave entrance, locking the massive door behind them.',

Thomas, in front of Molly, was wide-shouldered, his hair the color of straw, and as straight as straw. A slight breeze lifted it and let it fall over and over. His muscles moved fluidly, and perspiration glazed him. Molly thought he would make a fine drawing, a study in musculature. He turned and said something to Harvey, across the boat from him, and they both laughed.',

They pulled the oars hard and the school of fish vanished, but the gloom had lifted. While they rowed, they talked of ways of netting fish for dinner, of drying fish for the return trip, of the excitement in the valley when they learned that fish had survived after all.',

Molly had identified the locations for them: the Senate Office Building was up there; the Post Office Building; the General Services Building . . .',

Also, the air had a chill that persisted until <<midday|13>>, when the sun became too hot for the warm clothing they had put on earlier. By sundown it was too cool for the lighter garments they had changed into at the lunch break. They were always too hot or too cold.',

They put the oars back in the locks. The rain pounded them, and Thomas pumped harder. The water was sloshing about their feet, and when the lines to shore were untied the boat swung sharply into the river. The water inside the boat surged back and forth.
"Log! Coming fast! <<Eight o\'clock|6>>!" Molly yelled.
They turned the boat, and it shot forward and they were flashing down the river, keeping abreast of the log that was off to their left.',

The stump had been ashore when they passed it before. The current became swifter, and they fought to get closer in. "Tree! <<One o\'clock|6>>! Twenty yards!" They veered out again and now the log that was pacing them tumbled and came dangerously close. "Log! <<Nine o\'clock|6>>! Three yards!"',

Suddenly Molly saw the low spot and cried, "Land! <<Two o\'clock|6>>, twenty yards!" They drove in sharply to shore. The boat dragged on something hidden in the muddy water and the front half swung out toward the river. It rocked violently and water sloshed in over the side. Lewis and Ben quickly jumped out and, with the brown water swirling about their chests, waded toward shore, dragging the boat in after them. The boat grated over mud and stones, and now the others jumped into the water and dragged the boat higher until it was beached, tilted, but for the moment safe. Molly lay in the mud panting until Lewis said, "We\'ve got to get it higher. The river\'s rising fast."',

Probably it would be safe now to return to the house, she thought, but she did not stir from her hole in the hill. They returned shortly before dark, and spent more time going over the same ground they had covered before. Now she knew it was safe to go to the house. They never went out after dark, except in groups; they would not expect her to wander about in the dark alone. She stood up, easing the stiffness out of her legs and back. The ground was damp, and this spot was cool, sheltered from the sun.',
