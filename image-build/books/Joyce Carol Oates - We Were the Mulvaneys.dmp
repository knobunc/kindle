            "When I arrived at Alder Creek it wasn\x{2019}t yet <<3 P.M.|5>> and already cars, pickups, even bicycles were parked everywhere in the drive and on the grassy lawn. So many! What was Mom thinking of, calling this a family reunion? Scram, Mom\x{2019}s and Sable\x{2019}s antic beagle, came rushing at me, barking and sniffing excitedly, tail thumping. The first people I ran into were the Plucketts, hauling enormous watermelons up the drive\x{2014}Jimmy Ray and Nanci and their three freckle-faced teenagers so alike in appearance I could never tell them apart\x{2014}but the Plucketts, sunny, good-hearted people, wouldn\x{2019}t have expected me to remember their names, just called out, all smiles, \x{201c}Judd, hello! Happy Fourth of July!\x{201d} The next people I ran into were my gorgeous sister-in-law Vicky, Mrs. Mike Mulvaney Jr. with the caramel-colored hair\x{2014}very pregnant\x{2014}again\x{2014}and her little girl Chrissy, my firstborn niece, for whom my heart always gave a lurch. Vicky cried, \x{201c}Judd, aren\x{2019}t you looking handsome!\x{201d} standing on tiptoe to give me a breathy little kiss, her basketball-belly poking against me, and I lifted Chrissy in my arms with a mock grunt\x{2014}four years old already, what if she\x{2019}d forgotten her Uncle Judd she hadn\x{2019}t seen in a year?\x{2014}but she hadn\x{2019}t. And where was Mike?\x{2014}playing softball, Vicky said, in the goat pasture. And there were damp smeary kiddy-kisses from two-year-old Davy, Mike and Vicky\x{2019}s other child, and there came rushing at me my sister Marianne in STUMP CREEK HILL yellow T-shirt and shorts, baby Molly Ellen in her arms, and three-year-old Willy toddling behind, and we hugged, and kissed, clutching at each other as always as if in the other\x{2019}s absence each of us had imagined catastrophes, and these phantoms to be laughed eagerly away, dispelled like bad dreams in daylight, and we exchanged a minute\x{2019}s quick news, and I saw that Marianne was in the prime of her young womanhood, the color restored to her skin, a fullness to her face, the stress lines eased, the liquidy yearning in the eyes eased, now she was thirty-four years old, and married, and a mother, and a devoted worker at Stump Creek Hill Animal Shelter & Hospital, and her life independent of all Mulvaneys if she should wish it. And what a husband she had!\x{2014}I didn\x{2019}t always get along with bluff opinionated Whit West, but I admired him immensely. I asked, \x{201c}Where\x{2019}s Whit? I don\x{2019}t hear him,\x{201d} and Marianne laughed, poked me reprovingly in the chest, and said, \x{201c}He\x{2019}s on the phone. We haven\x{2019}t been here an hour\x{2014}have we, Willy?\x{2014}and already Whit is checking back. He was up late doing emergency surgery on Smoke\x{2014}remember Smoke?\x{2014}one of our black bears\x{2014}an appendectomy. Oh but Judd,\x{201d} Marianne said, just remembering, \x{201c}\x{2014}he\x{2019}s here, he\x{2019}s actually here. And he has a girl.\x{201d} Marianne pointed toward the pasture where a rowdy game of softball was in progress.",

RISE \x{2019}N\x{2019} SHINE, KIDDOS!\x{201d} And maybe whistled, or banged a pot. Barn chores before breakfast (my God it could take as long as an hour to wash the cows\x{2019} filth-encrusted milk-swollen udders, hook up the milking machine to each cow, drain their heavy milk bags dry, empty the milkers into pails) and barn chores after school (horses, mainly\x{2014}as much work, but at least I loved our horses), <<approximately 4:30 P.M.|2a>> to <<6 P.M.|5>> And then supper\x{2014}in our family, intense. Just to hold my own around our table, for a kid like me, the youngest of the Mulvaneys, used up energy, and staying power, like keeping on your toes through twelve rounds of a featherweight boxing match\x{2014}it might look almost easy to outsiders but it isn\x{2019}t easy, for sure. And after supper an hour or so of homework, also intense (Mom insisted that Patrick or Marianne oversee my efforts: worrying I wasn\x{2019}t the high-nineties student it was her conviction I should be) and more excitement among the family, watching TV for a while if something \x{201c}worthwhile, educational\x{201d} was on: history, science and biography documentaries on public television were favored by our parents. And we\x{2019}d discuss them during, and afterward\x{2014}we Mulvaneys were a family who talked. So when <<around 10 P.M.|5>> I staggered upstairs to bed it was with the gravity of a stone sinking slowly through deep, dark water. Sometimes I fell asleep half in my pajamas, lying sideways on my bed, and Little Boots curled up happily beside me. Sometimes I fell asleep in the bathroom, sitting on the toilet. \x{201c}Oh, Judd! Goodness! Wake up, honey!\x{201d} Mom might cry, having pushed open the door I\x{2019}d neglected to lock.",

Mule went less and less frequently with her and the others to church services now he was older, but still it rubs off on you. You have to know deep in your heart Do unto others as you would they would do unto you is just plain common sense. So he was beginning to get a little scared. Not seriously scared, but a little. Mixing warm Molson with vodka and whiskey didn\x{2019}t help. After the big party at the MacIntyres\x{2019} (this really cool ranch-style house on the golf course) they\x{2019}d piled into cars and driven six miles out to the funky County Line Tavern, where there was the possibility, unwarranted as it turned out, of some after-hours drinking, and some \x{201c}girls.\x{201d} Then word got out that T-T MacIntyre had picked up Della Rae Duncan, the poor bitch was dumb enough and drunk enough to imagine he \x{201c}liked\x{201d} her and wanted to be her \x{201c}steady.\x{201d} They were in Jamie Klinger\x{2019}s van, this gang of guys.

Which was where Frankie Kreigner trailed them. Though not turning into the cemetery but circling the block. Mule Mulvaney was saying, \x{201c}Maybe we should check them out?\x{2014}they might be hurting her, or something.\x{201d} Another time he said, like pleading, \x{201c}Shit, Della Rae, that poor mutt, that\x{2019}s like shooting fish in a barrel.\x{201d} The other guys were divided. Maybe yes, maybe no. There was something exciting about this. Knowing Della Rae was putting out for their buddies, or anyway guessing so. Though they didn\x{2019}t want to investigate, exactly. Della Rae was a pig and she was smashed out of her skull and you didn\x{2019}t want to think about it, Mule felt blood rush into his cock like a faucet turned on: hot.",

When the hand-painted 1850s \x{201c}banjo\x{201d} clock in the front hall was musically striking the hour of <<six|20>>, the 1889 \x{201c}Reformed Gothic\x{201d} grandfather clock on the first-floor landing of the stairs was clearing its throat preparing to strike the quarter hour after one. On the parlor mantel were a Chautauqua Valley \x{201c}steeple\x{201d} pendulum clock of the 1890s and a Dutch-style painted walnut pendulum clock of the 1850s, one about to strike the hour of <<nine|20>> and the other importantly chiming the hour of <<eleven-thirty|20>>. In the family room was a crudely fashioned 1850s eight-day clock with a tarnished brass eagle at its top, that clanged the hour, half hour, and quarter hour with a jazzy beat; in the dining room, a mantel clock of golden pine with a river scene hand-painted (and now badly faded) on its glass case, of the 1870s, and a delicately carved mahogany Chautauqua Valley grandmother clock of the turn of the century, with ethereal chimes. Scattered through the house were numerous other antique clocks of Corinne\x{2019}s, each a treasure, a bargain, a particular triumph. If there wasn\x{2019}t an excess of competing noise from radio, TV, tapes, records, raised voices or barking dogs you could move through the house in a trance of tick-tick-ticking.",

This was not an era in which good girls or even not-so-good girls succumbed to sexual pressure from men but Donna (from Glens Falls: \x{201c}speedcar capital of New York State\x{201d}) was a notable exception.

How could Michael Mulvaney keep sweetly shy Corinne Hausmann in mind, or even, to be frank, remember her name, overwhelmed as he was by Donna? Her supple hips and pelvis, her bold exploring hands, her astonishing mouth that was so ardent, beyond even his lurid ex-Catholic-boy fantasies\x{2014}Michael was prone to fall into an open-eyed stupor in the midst of work (roofs his specialty, from the start: being short-legged, compact, deft and muscular, with a strong tolerance for working in the sun, had its distinct advantages) contemplating Donna, the night-before and the night-to-come.

It helped that he was in peak physical condition (he swam, he dived, loved to show off at the lake) so he could subsist on four or three, occasionally two, one or even no hours of sleep, after a night of drinking and lovemaking with Donna before showering and hurriedly shaving and dressing and beginning the next long, so very long (you had to be at the work site by <<7:30 A.M.|2a>>) workday.",

Zachary said politely he\x{2019}d drive Marianne to the LaPortes\x{2019} where she was spending the night with Trisha (who\x{2019}d already left the party) and Marianne stammered blushing not knowing what to say and there was the sick look in Austin Weidman\x{2019}s face as if he\x{2019}d been kicked in the belly as it began to sink in at last how he wasn\x{2019}t wanted. Chewed-looking lips, black plastic glasses like his father\x{2019}s. If you looked at him head-on you saw he was a nice-looking boy but who wished to look at Austin Weidman head-on? He had dabbed a sort of flesh-colored ointment over a pimple on his chin, and sweating had made it run. His breath too had a medicinal odor, like tooth fillings. He believed himself in love with Marianne Mulvaney, though he hadn\x{2019}t dared tell her, or anyone. Hoping instead to impress her, bragging, as an adult man might brag, about \x{201c}future plans\x{201d}: he intended to be a dentist like his father, here in Mt. Ephraim; their sign would say T. WEIDMAN, D.D.S. &A. WEIDMAN, D.D.S., FAMILY DENTISTRY. At the prom Austin had danced awkwardly with Marianne, perspiring, staring at her in wonderment and holding her loosely, as if he feared stepping on her delicate size-six satin pumps with his size-twelve black leather dress Florsheims\x{2014}but he\x{2019}d stepped on them anyway. Marianne had spent much of the time talking and laughing with her own circle of friends, as Austin looked on smiling, like an elder brother. And of course she\x{2019}d danced with other boys all evening. Lots of other boys.",

At <<12:50 A.M.|2a>>, and Michael not home.
It was late April, after Easter. Corinne was in bed upstairs, propped up with pillows, too anxious to sleep; reading, or trying to read, one of Patrick\x{2019}s science magazines. Though every cell and nerve ending in her brain quivered with wakefulness, she could not concentrate on a passage she\x{2019}d read, reread how many times\x{2026}. No evidence either in the living world of today or of past geological epochs for a continuous transition of species\x{2026}what we actually find are separate and well-distinguished species\x{2026}intermediate stages from one species to another which should be found\x{2026}are not met with. The worlds of organisms, living and extinct, do not represent a continuum but a discontinuum\x{2026}. Certain conditions of stability exist notonly for the individual genes but also for genomes\x{2026}. A \x{201c}species\x{201d} represents a state in which a harmoniously stabilized \x{201c}genetic balance\x{201d} has been established, that is\x{2026} Thinking of Marianne who was so deeply unhappy at school. Yet never spoke of it. Poor Marianne with so few friends now, few telephone calls, and all that visiting the girls had done back and forth at one another\x{2019}s houses\x{2014}suddenly, for Marianne, all that had ceased as if it had never been. She\x{2019}d quit the cheerleading squad, rarely attended club meetings or her Christian Youth meetings. Her grades had dropped to C\x{2019}s but seemed to have levelled off. She was happiest at church, so far as Corinne could judge. Singing hymns in her thin, sweet soprano voice\x{2014}\x{201c}Rock of Ages,\x{201d} Corinne\x{2019}s favorite hymn of all time, was Marianne\x{2019}s, too. It was the only public place she felt comfortable: the First Church of Christ of South Lebanon was a one-room foursquare white-shingled church miles from Mt. Ephraim; the congregation was mostly country people; no one knew the Mulvaneys except as relatively new churchgoers, Corinne Mulvaney and her three children. Corinne drove to church in the mud-splattered rust-speckled Buick station wagon with the bumper sticker 4-H: HEAD HEART HANDS HEALTH and, on a rear window, a frayed decal FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA 1974. No one would have judged her the wife of a prosperous businessman, or, maybe, anyone\x{2019}s wife at all. If there was a Mr. Mulvaney, no one had ever sighted him in South Lebanon, nor would.",

The auditorium had grown warm, people were fanning themselves with their programs. Ventilators were turned up, rattling and vibrating. I saw that Dad\x{2019}s putty-colored face was slick with sweat.

Marianne saw a gigantic bird\x{2014}iridescent <<midnight|13>> blue, exquisitely beautiful, with a quivering feather crown and a long tail dragging in the dust\x{2014}a peacock?\x{2014}ambling across the parking lot, and in its wake a smaller pure-white bird\x{2014}a peahen? Farther along the lane were several deer, a small loose tame herd. Marianne stared\x{2014}at least two of the deer were young bucks, with only three legs.",

            "In a daze then, vaguely smiling, Marianne wandered back through the parking lot, hoping for another glimpse of the peacock and his hen, and the herd of deer. There were chattering guinea hens and a high-stepping bantam rooster running loose, there was a scrawny black tomcat with two half-ears sunning himself on the hood of a battered Chevy pickup. Marianne petted him, daringly\x{2014}you never can tell, with a strange cat\x{2014}but he merely blinked at her, lazy and content. It was a heating-up sort of August morning, the kind that begins damp and almost cool and turns baking by <<noon|13>>. A happy, hopeful day. No ticket seller at the ENTRANCE gate, just an orange plastic container STUMP CREEK HILL ANIMALS NEED ALL YOU CAN GIVE THEM! so Marianne took a five-dollar bill from her wallet (yes, she\x{2019}d saved plenty of money working as Penelope Hagstr\x{f6}m\x{2019}s assistant) and pushed it into the slot. The pungent smell of animals drew her. Manure and hay, that just-slightly-rancid-pleasurable smell. A sharper smell\x{2014}what was it? the antiseptic spray they\x{2019}d used, at the farm, when the cows calved?\x{2014}but this was sweeter somehow. And someone had been mowing deep grass, a wet green pungent smell, laced with wild onion.",
