The Americans from the military bases that plague these islands strut up and down the main streets, many of them with our females draped off their arms, Japanese females clad in nothing but little wraps of cloth. The Okinawan males ape the foreigners. I walked through the department stores, watching the endless chain of wanting and buying. I walked until my feet ached. I sat in shady coffee shops, where shelves sagged under the weight of magazines of mindtrash. I eavesdropped on businessmen, buying and selling what wasn\x{2019}t theirs. I carried on walking. Workaday idiots gaped in the rattling vacuity of pachinko machines, as I had once done in the days before His Serendipity opened my inner eyes. Tourists from the mainland toured the souvenir shops, buying boxes of tat that nobody ever really wants. The usual foreigners selling watches and cheap jewelry on the pavements, without licenses. I walked through the games arcades where the poisoned children congregate after school, gazing at screens where evil cyborgs, phantoms, and zombies do battle. The same shops as anywhere else\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}Burger King, Benetton, Nike\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}High streets are becoming the same all over the world, I suppose. I walked through backstreets, where housewives put out futons to air, living the same year sixty times. I watched a potter with a pocked face, bent over a wheel. A dying man, coughing without removing his cigarette, repaired a child\x{2019}s tricycle on a bottom step. A woman without any teeth put fresh flowers in a vase beneath a family shrine. I went to the old Ryukyu palace one afternoon. There were drinks machines in the courtyard, and a shop called The Holy Swordsman that sold nothing but key rings and camera film. The ancient ramparts were swarming with high school kids from Tokyo. The boys look like girls, with long hair and pierced ears and plucked eyebrows. The girls laugh like spider monkeys into their pocket phones. Hate them and you have to hate the world, Quasar.",

Hello Bronx! Hard to see you\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}this snow! Looking kinda smoky over your way? The lights around the World Trade Center are off, have been since the curfew sirens.\x{2026} There was a big explosion on Roosevelt Island \x{2019}<<round midnight|13>>, nothing but silence now. I am still here, therefore it wasn\x{2019}t no Big One. Power supply looks sporadic in Harlem. The lights go on, then off, like a busted neon tube.\x{2026} and it\x{2019}s kinda quiet, spooky outside the Night Train FM building here in the East Village. Lexington Avenue is deserted, except for the occasional police patrol. People, don\x{2019}t venture out of doors unless you need to. Trust a nocturnal animal.

If you\x{2019}re not busy setting cars ablaze or looting Tiffany\x{2019}s then you\x{2019}re probably wired to the television, watching the greatest drama mankind has ever staged. With Apocalypse Right Now, You Can Feel Your Eyeballs Melt as You Watch the Boom! But hey, remember, phone-in radio invented interactive. Night Train FM rolls on! Even by broadcasting we may be defying last week\x{2019}s Emergency Media Advisory Act\x{2014}cute name, huh? I tried to phone the Night Train lawyer, but there was no answer. He\x{2019}s probably thirty feet down in his private, hermetically-sealed Eden III New England bunker. Cockroaches and lawyers will survive this war and emerge to evolve into the next civilization. Maybe the info police are too busy to kick our door down, or maybe some giant jamming signal is blanketing all frequencies, or maybe some plug has been pulled from some socket somewhere and I\x{2019}m just talking to myself. Christ knows, I had enough practice during my marriage. A happier possibility is that the Emergency Mayor is a Paul Simon fan: the last track was \x{2018}Still Crazy After All These Years,\x{2019} respectfully dedicated to all the governments of the world, preceded by the late, great Freddie Mercury, \x{2018}Who Wants to Live For Ever,\x{2019} dedicated to me.

If there are any members of the American Parents Against English Gay Men with Mustaches who are offended by the inclusion of Freddie Mercurial on my show, you are welcome to lodge your complaints up Lord Rupert\x{2019}s hole. Looking on the positive side for a moment, if a big one gets through SkyWeb and pulps the Big Apple into quarks and gluons, I can ask the great Saint Freddie in person what the bejesus \x{2018}Bohemian Rhapsody\x{2019} is about. The track before was dedicated to my ex-wife: The Smiths\x{2019} \x{2018}Bigmouth Strikes Again.\x{2019} Just gimme a moment while I pour my next scotch\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}gurgle, gurgle, gurgle, y\x{2019}hear that?

If the war gets called off due to poor visibility, Mr. Kilmagoon can feel free to send me an oaken cask of your maturest for\x{2014}hic!\x{2014}my wholehearted product endorsement. Say, sorry the presentation is a little rough around the edges tonight, that\x{2019}s because I\x{2019}m managing the equipment all on my ownyownyown, since the regular Night Train FM crew\x{2014}the engineer, Carlotta my producer, and the boy wonder Kevin\x{2014}all got it into their heads that spending the end of the world with their loved ones actually takes priority over reporting to work!

When I was a young man, and the Russkies were going to blow us all to Kingdom Come, we were told we\x{2019}d have a four-minute warning. I\x{2019}m talking Ford, Carter, Reagan days. Four minutes, I used to wonder\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}What would I do in four minutes? Boil an egg, have sex, telephone my enemies to have the final word, listen to Jim Morrison, hotwire a car, and drive three blocks? Since the breakdown we\x{2019}ve had four days of these patrols and curfews.\x{2026} It\x{2019}s the waiting that pisses me off.\x{2026} This evening\x{2019}s declaration of war, at least it made things\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}clearer. Where were we? The next track\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}I\x{2019}m going to dedicate this song to my daughter, Julia, who\x{2019}ll be eight next Tuesday, if there is a next Tuesday, this is \x{2018}Julia\x{2019} by the Beatles. The chances of you hearing this are zilch, my ocean child, because I last got a call from your mother being rerouted by the evacuation police to Omaha or Moosejaw or the ends of the Earth, but your mother and I named you after this song, in happier times.
