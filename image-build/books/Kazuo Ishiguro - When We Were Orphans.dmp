My father too said he thought it a fine idea, but he would have to be excused on account of the work awaiting him in his study.',

We went into the Public Gardens and for a while, like every other family who went to the gardens on a Sunday afternoon, we strolled around the lawns and flower beds greeting friends and acquaintances, stopping occasionally for a short chat. I would sometimes see boys I knew\x{2014}from school or from my piano lessons at Mrs. Lewis\x{2019}s\x{2014}but they were, like me, walking beside their parents on their best behaviour, and we would acknowledge one another only shyly, if at all.

There I sat down at my homework table and waited, thinking not about my father, but of Akira and how I was already going to be late for him. I wondered if he would have the courage to return the bottle on his own; even if he did, he would still be very angry with me. I felt at that moment such an urgency about Akira\x{2019}s situation, I actually contemplated disobeying my mother and simply going off. Meanwhile the discussion in the drawing room seemed to go on interminably. There was a clock on the library wall and I stared at its hands. At one point, I went out into the hall, hoping to catch my mother\x{2019}s attention and ask her permission to leave, but I found the doors to the drawing room had now been closed. Then, as I was hovering there in the hall, once more thinking about sneaking off, Mei Li appeared and pointed sternly towards the library. Once I had gone back in, she closed the door on me and I could hear her pacing about outside. I seated myself again and went on watching the clock. As the hands passed <<half past three|10>>, I fell into a gloom, full of anger at both my mother and Mei Li.",

The two on the outside are wearing Western suits with stiff collars, and hold bowler hats and canes. The plump man in the centre is in traditional Chinese dress: a dark gown, cap and pigtail. As with most newspaper photographs of the time, there is a stagy, posed feeling to it, and my correspondent\x{2019}s scissors have cut off perhaps an entire quarter of it to the left. Nevertheless, from the moment my glance first fell on it, the picture\x{2014}more precisely, the central figure in the dark gown\x{2014}has been a source of exceptional interest to me.",

There is no denying it has cheered me. There is every reason to believe that she has now come through the dark tunnel of her life and emerged at the other end. What awaits her there remains to be seen, but she is not by nature someone who easily accepts defeat. Indeed, it is more than possible she will go on to fulfil the programme she outlined to me\x{2014}only half-jokingly\x{2014}as we looked out over the valley that morning. And if in a few years\x{2019} time things have indeed gone according to her wishes, then it is not out of the question I will take up her suggestion to go and live with her in the country. Of course, I would not much fancy her shed, but I could always take a cottage not far away. I am grateful for Jennifer. We understand each other\x{2019}s concerns instinctively, and it is exchanges like the <<one that frosty morning|5>> which have proved such a source of consolation for me over the years.",
