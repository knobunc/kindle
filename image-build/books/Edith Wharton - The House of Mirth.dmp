side of the cab. She seemed a stranger to herself, or rather there
were two selves in her, the one she had always known, and a new
abhorrent being to which it found itself chained. She had once
picked up, in a house where she was staying, a translation of the
EUMENIDES, and her imagination had been seized by the high terror
of the scene where Orestes, in the cave of the oracle, finds his
implacable huntresses asleep, and snatches an hour's repose.
Yes, the Furies might sometimes sleep, but they were there, always
there in the dark corners, and now they were awake and the iron
clang of their wings was in her brain\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. She
opened her eyes and saw the streets passing\x{2014}the familiar alien
streets. All she looked on was the same and yet changed. There was
a great gulf fixed between today and yesterday. Everything in the
past seemed simple, natural, full of daylight\x{2014}and she was alone in
a place of darkness and pollution.\x{2014}Alone! It was the loneliness
that frightened her. Her eyes fell on an illuminated clock at a
street corner, and she saw that the hands marked the half hour
after eleven. Only <<half-past eleven|10>>\x{2014}there were hours and hours left
of the night! And she must spend them alone, shuddering sleepless
on her bed. Her soft nature recoiled from this ordeal, which had
none of the stimulus of conflict to goad her through it. Oh, the
slow cold drip of the minutes on her head! She had a vision of
herself lying on the black walnut bed\x{2014}and the darkness would
frighten her, and if she left the light burning the dreary details
of the room would brand themselves forever on her brain. She had
always hated her room at Mrs. Peniston's\x{2014}its ugliness, its
impersonality, the fact that nothing in it was really hers. To a
torn heart uncomforted by human nearness a room may open almost
human arms, and the being to whom no four walls mean more than any
others, is, at such hours, expatriate everywhere.",

His reasoned-out resistances seemed for the moment so much less

wondering at what hour her reply would be sent, with what words it
would begin. As to its import he had no doubt\x{2014}he was as sure of her
surrender as of his own. And so he had leisure to muse on all its

sympathies. He was so desperately in earnest, poor youth, and his
earnestness was of so different a quality from Bertha's, though
hers too was desperate enough. The difference was that Bertha was
in earnest only about herself, while he was in earnest about her.

weight of destitution on Bertha's side, since at least he had
her to suffer for, and she had only herself. At any rate, viewed
less ideally, all the disadvantages of such a situation were for
the woman; and it was to Bertha that Lily's sympathies now went
out. She was not fond of Bertha Dorset, but neither was she without
a sense of obligation, the heavier for having so little personal
liking to sustain it. Bertha had been kind to her, they had lived
together, during the last months, on terms of easy friendship, and
the sense of friction of which Lily had recently become aware
seemed to make it the more urgent that she should work undividedly
in her friend's interest.",

with Mrs. Fisher, but on the two or three occasions when they had
met she was conscious of having distinctly advanced in his favour.
There could be no doubt that he admired her as much as ever, and
she believed it rested with herself to raise his admiration to the
point where it should bear down the lingering counsels of
expediency. The task was not an easy one; but neither was it easy,
in her long sleepless nights, to face the thought of what George
Dorset was so clearly ready to offer. Baseness for baseness, she
hated the other least: there were even moments when a marriage with
Rosedale seemed the only honourable solution of her difficulties.
She did not indeed let her imagination range beyond the day of
plighting: after that everything faded into a haze of material
well-being, in which the personality of her benefactor remained
mercifully vague. She had learned, in her long <<vigils|13>>, that there
were certain things not good to think of, certain <<midnight|13>> images
that must at any cost be exorcised\x{2014}and one of these was the image
of herself as Rosedale's wife.",
