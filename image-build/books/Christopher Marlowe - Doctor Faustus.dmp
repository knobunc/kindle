Faustus is thus doing what at I. iii. 55 he claims to have done: abjuring the Trinity. This dismissive sense of valeat occurs in Cicero\x{2019}s rejection of the gods of Epicurus in De natura deorum, I. 124: \x{201c}Deinde si maxime talis est deus ut nulla gratia, nulla hominum caritate teneatur, valeat \x{2026}\x{201d} (Cicero i. 536: \x{201c}If this is then indeed what God is, a being who feels no love or care for humanity, away with him!\x{201d}).

Orientis princeps Belzebub, inferni ardentis monarcha] Baal-zebub, god of Ekron, is mentioned in 2 Kings 1: 2; the name means \x{201c}Lord of the flies,\x{201d} and appears to be a derisive modification of the name of a Canaanite god, \x{201c}Baal, the Prince,\x{201d} or \x{201c}Baal of the Exalted Abode\x{201d} (Fitzmyer 920).

In Mark 3: <<22-26|5a:0>>, Matthew 12: <<24-28|5a:0>>, and Luke 11: <<15-20|5a:0>> the names of Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons, and of Satan seem interchangeable. Luke 10: 18 (\x{201c}I saw Satan like lightning, fall down from heaven\x{201d}) has traditionally been understood as referring to Isaiah 14: 12 (\x{201c}How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning?\x{201d}).",

He professes to give the Clown Dutch guilders; these coins, minted <<after 1543|18:0>> in silver, circulated internationally. Observing, it would seem, that the coins he has been given have holes punched in them, the Clown affects to mis-hear \x{201c}guilders\x{201d} as \x{201c}gridirons\x{201d}\x{2014}whereupon Wagner re-identifies the coins as French crowns (which were widely counterfeited: in 1587 the government issued a proclamation urging members of the public to strike holes in counterfeit French crowns). The name carries the obscene secondary meaning of heads made bald by venereal disease (see A Midsummer Night\x{2019}s Dream I. ii. 79, All\x{2019}s Well That Ends Well II. ii. 19, and Measure for Measure I. ii. 46). \x{201c}English counters,\x{201d} privately minted out of brass or other cheap metals, were used by sixteenth-century English tradesmen and merchants to assist in arithmetical calculations (cf.

Contemporary magi, however, had connections with the courts both of the Emperor Maximilian (Charles V\x{2019}s grandfather and immediate predecessor) and of Charles V. The Abbot Johannes Trithemius (1462-1516), author of the first account, written in 1507, of the historical Doctor Faustus, and himself suspected of practising demonic magic, was summoned to the court of Maximilian for extended periods in 1506 and 1507 (Brann 42, 95); his Liber octo quaestionum (1508), a work on demonology, is addressed to Maximilian. Several decades later, Martin Luther told of a magician, identified in one report of the conversation as Trithemius, who entertained Maximilian by having demons take on the forms of Alexander the Great and other monarchs (Tischreden no. 4450, WATr iv. 319). Another humanist magus, Henricus Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535), served Maximilian in diplomatic missions from 1510 or 1511 until at least 1515, and in 1529 was engaged by Margaret of Savoy, regent of the Netherlands, as archivist and historiographer to the Emperor Charles V. The historian Andr\x{e9} Thevet felt it necessary to refute the opinion that Charles V\x{2019}s military victories had been won by Agrippa\x{2019}s magic (Thevet ii. fol. 542v-543); the same boast, made on behalf of Doctor Faustus, was refuted by Philipp Melanchthon in a lecture given at Wittenberg in the mid-1550s (Palmer and More 103).",

The Old Man\x{2019}s words in A1 are Calvinist in their implication that the consequence of sin is \x{201c}loathsome filthiness,\x{201d} i.e., that sinful humanity is radically unloveable, and that salvation can come only as a wholly unmerited consequence of an act of divine mercy. Stachniewski cites many instances from the period of Calvinist domination of Anglican orthodoxy (from the 1560s to the mid-seventeenth century) in which Calvinist theology and preaching produced reactions like that of Faustus in line 48 (see Stachniewski <<17-54|5a:0>>). He notes that \x{201c}Many actual suicides resulted from religious despair. Cambridge was notorious for them in the 1580s and 1590s, the period of its greatest domination by puritan preaching\x{201d} (49). In B1, in contrast, the Old Man tells Faustus, in Augustinian terms, that his soul remains loveable unless perverted by the habit or custom of sinfulness, and he speaks in tones not of \x{201c}wrath\x{201d} but of \x{201c}tender love.\x{201d}",

            "You have heard before, that all Faustus\x{2019} mind was set to study the arts of necromancy and conjuration, the which exercise he followed day and night: and taking to him the wings of an eagle, thought to fly over the whole world, and to know the secrets of heaven and earth; for his speculation was so wonderful, being expert in using his vocabula, figures, characters, conjurations, and other ceremonial actions, that in all the haste he put in practice to bring the devil before him. And taking his way to a thick wood near to Wittenberg, called in the German tongue Spisser Waldt [\x{2026}], he came into the same wood towards evening to a cross way, where he made with a wand a circle in the dust, and within that many more circles and characters: and thus he passed away the time, until it was nine or <<ten of the clock in the night|6>>, then began Doctor Faustus to call for Mephostophiles the spirit, and to charge him in the name of Beelzebub to appear there personally without any long stay: then presently the devil began so great a rumor in the wood, as if heaven and earth would have come together with wind, the trees bowing their tops to the ground; then fell the devil to bleat as if the whole wood had been full of lions, and suddenly about the circle ran the devil as if a thousand wagons had been running together on paved stones. After this at the four corners of the wood it thundered horribly, with such lightnings as if the whole world, to his seeming, had been on fire. Faustus all this while half amazed at the devil\x{2019}s so long tarrying, and doubting whether he were best to abide any more such horrible conjurings, thought to leave his circle and depart; whereupon the devil made him music of all sorts, as if the nymphs themselves had been in place: whereat Faustus was revived and stood stoutly in his circle aspecting his purpose, and began again to conjure the spirit Mephostophiles in the name of the prince of devils to appear in his likeness: whereat suddenly over his head hanged hovering in the air a mighty dragon: then calls Faustus again after his devilish manner, at which there was a monstrous cry in the wood, as if hell had been open, and all the tormented souls crying to God for mercy; presently not three fathom above his head fell a flame in manner of a lightning, and changed itself into a globe: yet Faustus feared it not, but did persuade himself that the devil should give him his request before he would leave [\x{2026}]. Faustus, vexed at the spirit\x{2019}s so long tarrying, used his charms with full purpose not to depart before he had his intent, and crying on Mephostophiles the spirit, suddenly the globe opened and sprang up in height of a man: so burning a time, in the end it converted to the shape of a fiery man. This pleasant beast ran about the circle a great while, and appeared in manner of a grey friar, asking Faustus what was his request. Faustus commanded that the next morning at <<twelve of the clock|6>> he should appear to him at his house, but the devil would in no wise grant. Faustus began again to conjure him in the name of Beelzebub, that he should fulfil his request: whereupon the spirit agreed, and so they departed each one his way.",

Demanding either his own leg back or one of the usurer\x{2019}s in its place, he finally accepts a sum equal to the loan in return for his illusory dismemberment.] In like manner he served an horse-courser at a fair called Pheiffring, for Doctor Faustus through his cunning had gotten an excellent fair horse, whereupon he rid to the fair, where he had many chap-men that offered him money: lastly, he sold him for 40 dollars, willing him that bought him that in any wise he should not ride him over any water, but the horse-courser marvelled with himself that Faustus bade him ride him over no water. But (quoth he), I will prove, and forthwith he rid him into the river; presently the horse vanished from under him, and he sat on a bundle of straw, in so much that the man was almost drowned. The horse-courser knew well where he lay that had sold him his horse, wherefore he went angrily to his inn, where he found Doctor Faustus fast asleep, and snorting on a bed, but the horse-courser could no longer forbear him, took him by the leg and began to pull him off the bed; but he pulled him so, that he pulled his leg from his body, in so much that the horse-courser fell down backwards in the place, then began Doctor Faustus to cry with an open throat, He hath murdered me. Hereat the horsecourser was afraid, and gave the flight, thinking none other with himself, but that he had pulled his leg from his body; by this means Doctor Faustus kept his money.

Even as he then hath created trees full of fruits, so also hath he created the souls as reasonable trees full of forms and knowledges; but through the sin of the first parent all things were [concealed], and oblivion the mother of ignorance [entered] in. Set you then now aside, which may, the veil of your understanding, [you] which are wrapped in the darkness of ignorance. Cast out the drink of Lethe, you which have made yourselves drunken with forgetfulness, await for the true light, you which have suffered yourselves to be taken with unreasonable sleep; and forthwith when your face is discovered ye shall pass from the light to the light: for (as John saith) Ye are annointed by the holy Ghost, and have known all things; and again, Ye need not to be taught of any, because his annointing teacheth you all things [\x{2026}].

Baruch 3: 36-38]; that is to say, taking flesh, and with an open mouth teaching those things which under dark questions he hath taught in the Law and Prophets. And to the end that you may not think that these things be referred to divine things only, and not [also] to natural, hear what the wise man witnesseth of himself: It is He that hath given me the true knowledge of those things which are, that I might know the dispositions of the compass of the earth, the virtue of the elements, the beginning, consummation, middle, and revolutions of times, the course of the year, the dispositions of the stars, the natures of living creatures, the anger of beasts, the force of the winds, the thoughts of men, the differences of plants, the virtues of roots, and finally I have learned all the things which be hidden and unknown, for the Artificer of all things hath taught me wisdom [Wisdom of Solomon 7: <<17-21|5a:0>>]\x{2026}.",

            "[Jean Calvin (1509-64), the most influential of the second-generation Protestant reformers and the great systematizer among sixteenth-century theologians, was a powerful presence in Elizabethan England. As A.D. Nuttall has remarked, the nearly one hundred English-language editions of his writings printed by 1640 far outnumber those of any other author (Calvin\x{2019}s close associate Theodore de B\x{e8}ze stands in second place with fifty editions, followed by Luther and Bullinger with thirty-eight each.) Not until the early seventeenth century was Calvin\x{2019}s rate of publications in English overtaken\x{2014}\x{201c}and then it was by William Perkins and Henry Smith, both Calvinists\x{201d} (Nuttall 1980: 21). Calvin\x{2019}s thought formed part of the dominant ideology of Elizabethan England, for although the Church of England retained an episcopal structure, its theology was strongly Calvinistic (Sinfield 1983: <<12-14|5a:0>>). This fact, Alan Sinfield observes, \x{201c}has fascinating consequences for the study of literature of the period. It obliges us to entertain the thought, for instance, that Marlowe\x{2019}s Faustus is not damned because he is wicked, but wicked because he is damned\x{201d} (14).",

For he doth not say that pardon is denied them if they turn to the Lord: but he utterly denieth that they can rise unto repentance, because they are by the just judgment of God stricken with eternal blindness for their unthankfulness. And it maketh nothing to the contrary that afterward he applieth to this purpose the example of Esau, which in vain attempted with howling and weeping to recover his right of the first begotten [Hebrews 12: <<16-17|5a:0>>]. And no more doth that threatening of the Prophet: When they cry, I will not hear [Zechariah 7: 13]. For in such phrases of speech is meant neither the true conversion, nor calling upon God, but that carefulness of the wicked, wherewith being bound, they are compelled in extremity to look unto that which before they carelessly neglected, that there is no good thing for them but in the Lord\x{2019}s help. But this they do not so much call upon, as they mourn that it is taken from them. Therefore the Prophet meaneth nothing else by crying, and the Apostle nothing else by weeping, but that horrible torment which by desperation fretteth and vexeth the wicked. This it is good to mark diligently, for else God should disagree with himself, which crieth by the Prophet that he will be merciful so soon as the sinner turneth [Ezekiel 18: <<21-22|5a:0>>]. And as I have already said, it is certain that the mind of man is not turned to better, but by God\x{2019}s grace preventing [i.e., pre-arranging] it. Also his promise concerning calling upon him will never deceive.

            "In August 1507, the humanist Johannes Trithemius, himself a graduate of Heidelberg, and an occult philosopher and magician as well as a Benedictine abbot, wrote a long letter to his friend Johannes Virdung von Hassfurt, an astrologer at Heidelberg who had an active interest in magic and divination. In this letter Trithemius described the activities over the preceding year of a man who announced himself in what was probably a printed sheet of self-advertisement as \x{201c}Magister Georgius Sabellicus, the younger Faustus, chief of necromancers, astrologer, the second magus, palmist, diviner by earth and fire, second in the art of divination by water\x{201d} (Baron 1978: 96; cf. Tille 2, Palmer and More 84). \x{201c}Sabellicus\x{201d} is probably a humanist cognomen incorporating a learned allusion to Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, whose origins were among the Sabines or Sabellici, and who as the supposed inventor of divination by water could be regarded as a pagan prophet (Baron 1978: 32). \x{201c}Faustus\x{201d} seems also to be a humanist cognomen, chosen for its meaning (\x{201c}auspicious\x{201d}), and as alluding to one or more of the earlier bearers of the name\x{2014}most probably the Manichaean bishop with whom St. Augustine debated, or the Faustus who in a widely-read patristic text, the pseudo-Clementine Recognitions, is briefly a disciple of the Gnostic heresiarch and magician Simon Magus (Wentersdorf; Richardson). \x{201c}The second magus\x{201d} may be a bow in the direction of Zoroaster, whom Renaissance genealogies of wisdom commonly list as the first inventor of magic. But Faustus is not being modest: this admission of secondariness puts him ahead of Hermes or Mercurius Trismegistus, the usual number two in accounts of the magical prisca theologia or \x{201c}ancient theology\x{201d} (see Walker 1975: 23, 93, and Yates 1964: 15, 131). Moreover, \x{201c}magus secundus,\x{201d} in conjunction with claims to astrological competence and primacy in necromancy, might reinforce the suggestion of an affiliation with Simon Magus\x{2014}who in the Recognitions is denounced as a necromancer, and is closely associated with belief in astrology (Recognitions II. <<13-15|5a:0>>, IX. 12 ff., X. 7 ff.).",

            "The man, as Trithemius describes him, was clearly transgressive: a braggart, a blasphemer, and a pederast. He apparently boasted that if the writings and doctrines of Plato and Aristotle were wholly lost and forgotten, he \x{201c}would be able to restore them all with increased beauty,\x{201d} just as the prophet Ezra had restored the lost books of the Law (cf. 2 Esdras 14: <<20-26|5a:0>>). He claimed \x{201c}that the miracles of Christ the Saviour were not so wonderful, that he himself could do all the things that Christ had done, as often and whenever he wished.\x{201d} And when in 1507 Faustus was appointed schoolmaster in Kreuznach, he promptly indulged \x{201c}in the most abominable kind of fornication with the boys,\x{201d} and fled to escape punishment (Baron 1978: 96-97; Tille 1-3; Palmer and More 83-86).",

            "Luther may also have contributed more directly to the launching of the legend through the stories he helped to spread when his former Wittenberg colleague and later radical opponent, Andreas Bodenstein von Karlstadt, died in Basel on Christmas Eve, 1541. In early 1542, Luther and his correspondents in Basel and elsewhere claimed successively that Karlstadt had left behind him a noisome spirit, and that his death had been caused, not by the plague\x{2014}Karlstadt was himself a plague to God\x{2019}s church\x{2014}but by his terror when the devil materialized to carry him off (WABr ix. 621-22, x. <<12-14|5a:0>>, <<24-30|5a:0>>, 49). Johannes Gast, a Protestant clergyman of Basel, appropriated these same motifs of a noisome spirit and of a death at the devil\x{2019}s hands as organizing features of the first clearly legendary account of Doctor Faustus, which he published in his Tomus secundus convivalium sermonum (Basel, 1548). Paolo Giovio had claimed in his Elogia doctorum virorum (1546) that the humanist and occult philosopher Henricus Cornelius Agrippa had a black dog who was actually a devil.8 Not to be outdone, Gast declared that the necromancer Faustus\x{2019}s dog, and his horse as well, were both devils. And Faustus did not simply die in despair: \x{201c}he was strangled by the devil and his body on its bier kept turning face downward even though it was five times turned on its back. God preserve us lest we become slaves of the devil\x{201d} (Palmer and More 98).",

            "Like several of his first-century contemporaries, Simon Magus, the magician and Gnostic heresiarch to whom Melanchthon likened Faustus, professed to be God. Simon makes a cameo appearance in the canonical Acts of the Apostles: acclaimed by his followers as \x{201c}the power of God that is called great\x{201d} (Acts 8: 10), this Samaritan magician is converted by the apostle Philip, and then, after seeking to buy the power of the Holy Spirit, cursed by the apostle Peter (Acts 8: <<15-24|5a:0>>). But he appears to have been a more substantial figure than the polemical narrative in Acts would suggest. The doctrines of Simon and the sect he founded are refuted at length by patristic writers, including Hippolytus and Irenaeus\x{2014}according to whom this apostate, antichrist and agent of the devil gave visible form to his heresies by cohabiting with a woman whom his followers knew variously as Helena, Minerva, or Luna. Appropriating a motif from the apocryphal Wisdom literature, which he conflated with the Greek myth of the birth of Athena, goddess of wisdom, from the head of Zeus, Simon described this woman as his own divine First Thought. The evil archons whom she had absent-mindedly engendered, and who then created the world, imprisoned her within it in a series of human forms, among them that of Helen of Troy; but Simon, the originary God, had now descended to save her and all who believed in him (Irenaeus I. 23).",

            "In the course of the Faustus legend\x{2019}s narrative exfoliation, the anti-Catholic overtones which had been present in its earliest forms became more pronounced, and the legend acquired, in inverse form, many of the features of the popular genre of saints\x{2019} lives\x{2014}a genre which it also helped to displace (Allen <<13-41|5a:0>>). At the same time, the carnivalesque elements evident in Luther\x{2019}s anecdotes about magicians were taken up and amplified.",

            "One may well wonder why the Good Angel neither suggests to Faustus the sort of question that George Herbert asks\x{2014}\x{201c}Art thou all justice, Lord? / Shows not thy word / More attributes?\x{201d}\x{2014}nor tries to prompt him to the request which follows from it: \x{201c}Let not thy wrathfull power / Afflict my houre, / My inch of life \x{2026}\x{201d} (\x{201c}Complaining,\x{201d} lines 11-13, <<16-18|5a:0>>). The answer would seem to be that Faustus is not among those chosen by God\x{2019}s inscrutable will for salvation. If this is so, the function of the Good Angel\x{2019}s exhortation is not to convert Faustus, but rather (in terms which readers of Calvin will find familiar) to render him inexcusable (see Institutes III. iii. <<10-11|5a:0>>).",

It would seem that Anglican theologians of the period, if consulted on the matter at this point in the play, would have responded with a unanimous negative. Faustus, one remembers, abjured the Trinity in his invocation of Mephastophilis in the third scene of the play (see my note to I. iii. <<16-17|5a:0>>), thus denying the very foundation of the Christian faith.

            "10\x{a0} In those parts of Germany where records of the witch-persecutions have received the most detailed study (present-day Baden-W\x{fc}rttemberg and Bavaria), there was a sharp increase of witchcraft trials <<after 1560|18:0>>, peaking in the 1580s, and a further wave of persecutions between 1585 and 1595 (Behringer 11, 13). Monter notes that a \x{201c}rapid intensification of persecution\x{201d} in the territories, both Catholic and Protestant, from Geneva and Savoy north to Alsace and Lorraine began \x{201c}sometime between the 1560\x{2019}s and the 1580\x{2019}s\x{201d} (Monter 35). A similar pattern is evident in south-eastern England, where witchcraft indictments on the Home Circuit Assizes rose from less than 40 in the 1560s to 109 in the 1570s and 166 in the 1580s (Sharpe 108-09). Across Western Europe, the number of witch trials increased greatly \x{201c}after <<about 1550|18:0>>\x{201d} (Klaits 48).",

            "Toward the middle of the twentieth century, however, a contrary opinion gathered strength, as a result of the editorial and textual-critical work of F.S. Boas and Leo Kirschbaum (published in 1932 and 1946 respectively), and more distinctly as a result of W.W. Greg\x{2019}s magisterial parallel-text edition of the play, published in 1950. Greg\x{2019}s exhaustive textual analysis established a new orthodoxy, according to which the 1616 quarto was very close in shape and detail to the original form of the play, while the 1604 quarto was said to be an abbreviated version of that original, cut down for performance in provincial towns at a time in the early 1590s when the London theatres were closed because of plague, and based not on authorial manuscripts but on actors\x{2019} far-from-adequate memories of their performances of the play. The success of Greg\x{2019}s analysis for rather more than a quarter-century is reflected in the fact that <<after 1950|18:0>>, with just one exception, every new edition published until the mid-1980s was based upon the 1616 version of the play.",
