Some business that needs doing because it is impossible to have nothing to do, no sequence of errands, list of tasks. She might wave her hands in the air, or tremble if she can\x{2019}t put her hand to something with another chore just around the bend from the one she is doing. She lights the oven to warm up the kitchen. And while she sprinkles the collar of a white shirt her mind is at the bottom of the bed where the leg, broken clean away from the frame, is too split to nail back. When the customer comes and Violet is sudsing the thin gray hair, murmuring \x{201c}Ha mercy\x{201d} at appropriate breaks in the old lady\x{2019}s stream of confidences, Violet is resituating the cord that holds the stove door to its hinge and rehearsing the month\x{2019}s plea for three more days to the rent collector. She thinks she longs for rest, a carefree afternoon to decide suddenly to go to the pictures, or just to sit with the birdcages and listen to the children play in snow.",

Heard their hallway conversation, and the bathroom laughter penetrating the broom closet like fumes from her bottle of ammonia. She examined their bottles and resituated the flasks tucked under cushions and behind books whose words were printed in two columns. She knew who had a passion for justice as well as ladies\x{2019} undergarments, who loved his wife and who shared one. The one who fought with his son and would not speak to his father.

            "\x{201c}I wasn\x{2019}t looking for the trail. It was looking for me and when it started talking at first I couldn\x{2019}t hear it. I was rambling, just rambling all through the City. I had the gun but it was not the gun\x{2014}it was my hand I wanted to touch you with. Five days rambling. First High Fashion on 131st Street because I thought you had a hair appointment on Tuesday. First Tuesday of every month it was. But you wasn\x{2019}t there. Some women came in with fish dinners from Salem Baptist, and the blind twins were playing guitar in the shop, and it\x{2019}s just like you said\x{2014}only one of them\x{2019}s blind; the other one is just going along with the program. Probably not even brothers, let alone twins. Something their mama cooked up for a little extra change. They were playing something sooty, though; not the gospel like they usually do, and the women selling fish dinners frowned and talked about their mother bad, but they never said a word to the twins and I knew they were having a good time listening because one of the loudest ones could hardly suck her teeth for patting her foot. They didn\x{2019}t pay me no mind. Took me a while to get them to tell me you wasn\x{2019}t on the book for that day. Minnie said you had a touch-up Saturday and how she didn\x{2019}t approve of touch-ups not just because they were fifty cents instead of a dollar and a quarter for the whole do, but because it hurt the hair, heat on dirt she said, hurt the hair worse than anything she knew of. Except, of course, no heat at all. What did you have the touch-up for? That\x{2019}s what I first thought about. Last Saturday? You told me you were going with the choir out to Brooklyn to sing at Shiloh, and you had to leave at <<nine in the morning|5>> and wouldn\x{2019}t be back till night and that\x{2019}s why. And that you\x{2019}d missed the last trip, and your aunt found out about it so you had to go on this one, and that\x{2019}s why. So I didn\x{2019}t wait for Violet to leave and unlock Malvonne\x{2019}s apartment. No need. But how could you have a touch-up the Saturday before and still make it to the station by <<nine o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> when Minnie never opens up <<before noon|13>> on Saturday because she\x{2019}s open till <<midnight|13>> getting everybody readied up for Sunday? And you didn\x{2019}t need to keep the Tuesday regular appointment, did you? I dismissed the evil in my thoughts because I wasn\x{2019}t sure that the sooty music the blind twins were playing wasn\x{2019}t the cause. It can do that to you, a certain kind of guitar playing. Not like the clarinets, but close. If that song had been coming through a clarinet, I\x{2019}d have known right away. But the guitars\x{2014}they confused me, made me doubt myself, and I lost the trail. Went home and didn\x{2019}t pick it up again until the next day when Malvonne looked at me and covered her mouth with her hand. Couldn\x{2019}t cover her eyes, though; the laugh came flying out of there.",

It hurt, though, and the next day I stood freezing on the stoop worrying myself sick about it. Nobody there but Malvonne sprinkling ashes on patches of ice. Across the street, leaning up against the iron railing, I saw three sweetbacks. Thirty degrees, not even <<ten in the morning|5>>, and they shone like patent leather. Smooth. Couldn\x{2019}t be more than twenty, twenty-two. Young. That\x{2019}s the City for you. One wore spats, and one had a handkerchief in his pocket same color as his tie. Had his coat draped across his shoulders. They were just leaning there, laughing and so on, and then they started crooning, leaning in, heads together, snapping fingers. City men, you know what I mean. Closed off to themselves, wise, young roosters. Didn\x{2019}t have to do a thing\x{2014}just wait for the chicks to pass by and find them. Belted jackets and handkerchiefs the color of their ties. You think Malvonne would have covered her mouth in front of them? Or made roosters pay her in advance for the use of her place of a Thursday? Never would have happened because roosters don\x{2019}t need Malvonne. Chickens find the roosters and find the place, too, and if there is tracking to be done, they do it. They look; they figure. Roosters wait because they are the ones waited for. They don\x{2019}t have to trail anybody, look ignorant in a beauty parlor asking for a girl in front of women who couldn\x{2019}t wait for me to leave so they could pat on to the sooty music and talk about what the hell did I want to know about a girl not out of high school yet and wasn\x{2019}t I married to old crazy Violet? Only old cocks like me have to get up from the stoop, cut Malvonne off in the middle of a sentence and try to walk not run all the way to Inwood, where we sat the first time and you crossed your legs at the knees so I could see the green shoes you carried out the house in a paper sack so your aunt wouldn\x{2019}t know you tapped down Lenox and up Eighth in them instead of the oxfords you left the house in. While you flicked your foot, turned your ankles for the admiration of the heels, I looked at your knees but I didn\x{2019}t touch. I told you again that you were the reason Adam ate the apple and its core. That when he left Eden, he left a rich man. Not only did he have Eve, but he had the taste of the first apple in the world in his mouth for the rest of his life. The very first to know what it was like. To bite it, bite it down.

It had, instead, a domestic smell\x{2014}oil, ashes\x{2014}that led him on. Crawling, squirming through a space low enough to graze his hair. Just as he decided to back out of there, the dirt under his hands became stone and light hit him so hard he flinched. He had come through a few body-lengths of darkness and was looking out the south side of the rock face. A natural burrow. Going nowhere. Angling through one curve of the slope to another. Treason River glistening below. Unable to turn around inside, he pulled himself all the way out to reenter head first. Immediately he was in open air the domestic smell intensified. Cooking oil reeked under stabbing sunlight. Then he saw the crevice. He went into it on his behind until a floor stopped his slide.

You would have thought everything had been forgiven the way they played. The clarinets had trouble because the brass was cut so fine, not lowdown the way they love to do it, but high and fine like a young girl singing by the side of a creek, passing the time, her ankles cold in the water. The young men with brass probably never saw such a girl, or such a creek, but they made her up that day. On the rooftops. Some on 254 where there is no protective railing; another at <<131|9c:0>>, the one with the apple-green water tank, and somebody right next to it, <<133|9l:0>>, where lard cans of tomato plants are kept, and a pallet for sleeping at night. To find coolness and a way to avoid mosquitoes unable to fly that high up or unwilling to leave the tender neck meat near the street lamps. So from Lenox to St. Nicholas and across 135th Street, Lexington, from Convent to Eighth I could hear the men playing out their maple-sugar hearts, tapping it from four-hundred-year-old trees and letting it run down the trunk, wasting it because they didn\x{2019}t have a bucket to hold it and didn\x{2019}t want one either.
