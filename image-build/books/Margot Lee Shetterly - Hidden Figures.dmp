            "Mission Control set the candle on fire at <<9:37 a.m.|2a>>, early enough for the East Coast brain busters to take in the big event and get to work, then spend the rest of the day getting the color commentary. If the space shots hadn\x{2019}t exactly become commonplace since Alan Shepard\x{2019}s first foray, they happened often enough for talking heads like CBS\x{2019}s Walter Cronkite to wield the jargon of max Q and apogee and trans-Earth injection with the same nonchalance as the flight operations crew in the trenches of Mission Control. Still, the broadcasters knew\x{2014}everyone in the audience knew\x{2014}that even with twenty-six manned flights under NASA\x{2019}s belt, this was different, and they struggled to come up with superlatives to capture the moment. Cronkite gushed unabashedly, putting the magnitude into the context of the great machines of war and transportation that had transformed the American century: the mighty Saturn V rocket consumed the equivalent of ninety-eight railroad cars\x{2019} worth of fuel; it propelled a craft that weighed as much as a nuclear submarine with the equivalent thrust of 543 fighter jets. The United States would spend \$24 billion on Apollo, in order to plunge the sword into the heart of the Soviet Union\x{2019}s ambitions in space.",

            "The Eagle, the lunar lander, issued forth from the Apollo command module at <<4:00 p.m.|2a>> The touchdown caused a collective shiver. The crew was close, so close. The world waited for the door of the crab-like mechanical contraption to open. It took four hours. Then, finally, at <<10:38 p.m.|2a>>: sighs, applause, exuberance, dumbstruck silence, from all corners of the Earth, as Neil Armstrong planted his foot on luna firma. The actual landing had been the one part of the mission that had been impossible to rehearse prior to the actual moment\x{2014}and the most dangerous. The Apollo 11 astronauts had given the mission only a middling chance of success: though Neil Armstrong handicapped the odds of returning to Earth safely at 90 percent, he thought they had only a 50-50 chance of landing on the Moon on the first go. Katherine Johnson had confidence: she knew her numbers were right, and she assumed that everyone else\x{2014}Marge Hannah and the fellas there in her office, Mary Jackson and Thomas Byrdsong and Jim Williams, everyone from the top of NASA to the bottom\x{2014}had given their all to the mission.",
