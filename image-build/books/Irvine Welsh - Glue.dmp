I want this to be over. You take
too much because you want to feel or see something different, but
only for a short time. I can\'t take this because I\'ve got to the
point that I\'m not learning anything through it. It\'s just another
fuckin struggle. What the fuck is staying awake for days and days
meant to teach me? Like when we were kids in the summer and we would
spin and spin in front of the flats until we had some daft trippy
blackout and then we\'d lie panting, sick and dizzy on the grass. The
grown-ups, sittin out in the sun, would tell us to stop. They knew we
were only fucking ourselves up and that no higher consciousness
awaited. There was a time when I thought that they were trying to
stop us from gaining entry into a secret world, but now I know that
they just couldn\'t be bothered cleaning up after all those sick,
puking little cunts. But I\'m doing it again, lying to myself in the
name of oblivion. I want to see and feel less, rather than more,
that\'s why I\'m off my tits. Bottom line: I\'m fucking up and for no
apparent reason.',
