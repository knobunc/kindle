I want this to be over. You take too much because you want to feel or see something different, but only for a short time. I can\'t take this because I\'ve got to the point that I\'m not learning anything through it. It\'s just another fuckin struggle. What the fuck is staying awake for days and days meant to teach me? Like when we were kids in the summer and we would spin and spin in front of the flats until we had some daft trippy blackout and then we\'d lie panting, sick and dizzy on the grass. The grown-ups, sittin out in the sun, would tell us to stop. They knew we were only fucking ourselves up and that no higher consciousness awaited. There was a time when I thought that they were trying to stop us from gaining entry into a secret world, but now I know that they just couldn\'t be bothered cleaning up after all those sick, puking little cunts. But I\'m doing it again, lying to myself in the name of oblivion. I want to see and feel less, rather than more, that\'s why I\'m off my tits.

Festival punters and office workers merged easily in a smug but probably unfounded complicity, imagining that they were in a place which was at the centre of the world for those three weeks of the year. Billy Birrell was standing at the bar, holding court, drinking a Perrier water. His eyes raised in a surprised but not hostile manner as he caught sight of his brother. A fuckin Hibs away strip. Still, at least it was further proof that he wasn\'t hanging around with aggro-merchants. Then Billy saw Terry and his face visibly dropped. But he was with someone . . . that lassie ... it was Kathryn Joyner! Here, in the Business Bar! She was getting some looks as well, but what was she doing with them?',

            "If the Ingliston gig was a watershed for Kathryn, so was the Gauntlet one for Terry. When they'd headed off, he'd deliberately left his jacket over the back of a chair in the pub. He'd never keep shagging cool young lassies like Lisa dressing like a twat. He resolved to make more of an effort to slim down, kick those H\x{e4}agen-Dazs, white-pudding supper and masturbation sessions into touch. Somewhere along the line, he realised, he'd lost a bit of pride in himself. And it didn't necessarily mean dressing up like a poof, because Ben Sherman was back now. He'd had his first one at <<ten|9c:1>>. Maybe this was the indication of a Juice Terry revival in middle age. Get a haircut as well. It grew so quickly, but a number one or two every other Saturday would be cool, if he could lose the weight. Buy some Ben Shermans, new jeans. Do over a fuckin clathes shop! Maybe a leather bomber jacket like Birrell's. He had to admit that was smart. New Terry, New Clathes.",

In the cab, Rab heard Terry mutter something about Andy Galloway, his brother\'s mate. Rab had known Gally well; he was a nice guy. His suicide had cast a large shadow over them all, especially Terry, Billy and, he supposed, Carl Ewart. Carl was doing okay now though, at least he had been, and he probably never gave any of them a second thought.',
