            "She clicked the pocket watch open and closed and watched the outlines of the crafts bob on the river, the Isle\x{2019}s red glow more marked in the settling dark. She had her eyes on one ship in particular, had been watching, coveting, all day. It was a gorgeous vessel, its hull and masts carved from dark wood and trimmed in silver, its sails shifting from <<midnight|13>> blue to black, depending on the light. A name ran along its hull\x{2014}Saren Noche\x{2014}and she would later learn that it meant Night Spire. For now she only knew that she wanted it. But she couldn\x{2019}t simply storm a fully manned craft and claim it as her own. She was good, but she wasn\x{2019}t that good. And then there was the grim fact that Lila didn\x{2019}t technically know how to sail. So she leaned against a smooth stone wall, her black attire blending into the shadows, and watched, the gentle rocking of the boat and the noise of the Night Market farther up the bank drawing her into a kind of trance.",

Now, with the city fast approaching, the water glowed like a ruby lit from within, the red light visible even at <<midday|13>>. It was like a beacon, leading them into London.',

Tav, Stross, and Vasry wore fine hooded half-cloaks that gathered at the wrists, collar and cuff fastened with polished silver clasps. Alucard himself was dressed in an elegant coat, <<midnight|13>> blue with silver lining, his curls clasped back beneath a hat that dipped and curved like the sea. One hand rested on the hilt of his short sword, the silver feather ring glinting in the low light. Aside from the sapphire still sparkling in his right brow, he didn\x{2019}t look like the casero of the Night Spire. And yet, if he didn\x{2019}t look like a pirate, he didn\x{2019}t look entirely like a princeling, either. He looked polished, but also sharp, like a well-kept knife.",
