"We\'re down and concealed for the moment, and we\'ve got some hardware to work with and enough emergency rations to carry us for up to five months if we\'re careful. But there are only eighteen of us - <<twenty|9k:0>>, if we count Warner and Nimitz - " he nodded to the Peep officer with a wryly apologetic grin " - and the bad guys have a hell of a lot more firepower than we do. Not to mention an established base, at least a dozen armed pinnaces of their own, and those damned satellites to watch their backs. Any way you look at it, Ma\'am, we\'re pretty damned outnumbered!"',

We were incredibly lucky that the Navy didn\'t just stand by and watch the Levelers roll over us. In fact, I remind you that only one ship of the wall - just <<one|9k:0>>, and not even a unit of the Capital Fleet, at that - had the initiative and nerve to intervene. If Rousseau had stayed out of it, you and Oscar and I would all be dead now, and we can\'t count on that sort of support again without demonstrating that we at least know we owe the people who saved our hides a debt. And the only way I can see to do that is to give them a voice at the highest level, make sure the rank and file know we\'ve done it, and actually pay that voice some attention... publicly, at least."',

            'The good news was that \'cat populations grew far more slowly than their multiple-birth reproductive patterns might suggest. Samantha\'s four-kitten litter was of about average size, but most females littered no more than once every <<eight to ten|10a:0>> T-years. Given that they lived about two hundred years and remained fertile for a hundred and fifty, that still meant a single mated pair could produce a staggering number of offspring, but the process took much longer than initial impressions might suggest. And it was inevitable that human and \'cat societies were going to be much more intimately intertwined here on Grayson, which lacked the endless forests that provided Sphinx with virtually unlimited habitat for its native sentients. Here, \'cats would have to share the life-sustaining enclaves of humanity, and Honor wondered just how that would affect their adoption rate.',

CIC is calling this one Alpha One, and range is approximately five-point-nine light-minutes. It\'s on a direct pursuit course with an acceleration of five hundred and ten gravities, but present velocity is barely twelve hundred KPS. The other one, designated Alpha Two, is almost dead ahead - bearing zero-zero-three, zero-one-four, range about fifteen-point-eight light-minutes.

Honor reached out to the arm of his command chair and tapped a function key, throwing one of the evasion patterns she\'d entered at DuChene\'s station onto McKeon\'s repeater plot. "If we alter course about thirty-five degrees to port and go to five hundred gravities for fifteen minutes, then break back for the limit in the same plane," she said, "we\'ll swing away from <<Two|9c:1>>, <<Three|9k:0>>, and Four. Two will still have a chance to overhaul us, but only if she\'s got some accel in reserve. But we\'ll be giving One a chance to cut the angle on us and bring us to action short of the limit. Not by much. I estimate we\'ll be in his engagement envelope for no more than twenty-five minutes. To get the shot, though, he\'ll have to conform to our movements... which should put the convoy\'s translation point outside his range on emergence."',
