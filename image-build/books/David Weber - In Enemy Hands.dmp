"We\'re down and concealed for the moment, and we\'ve got some hardware to work with and enough emergency rations to carry us for up to five months if we\'re careful. But there are only eighteen of us - <<twenty|9k:0>>, if we count Warner and Nimitz - " he nodded to the Peep officer with a wryly apologetic grin " - and the bad guys have a hell of a lot more firepower than we do. Not to mention an established base, at least a dozen armed pinnaces of their own, and those damned satellites to watch their backs. Any way you look at it, Ma\'am, we\'re pretty damned outnumbered!"',

We were incredibly lucky that the Navy didn\'t just stand by and watch the Levelers roll over us. In fact, I remind you that only one ship of the wall - just <<one|9k:0>>, and not even a unit of the Capital Fleet, at that - had the initiative and nerve to intervene. If Rousseau had stayed out of it, you and Oscar and I would all be dead now, and we can\'t count on that sort of support again without demonstrating that we at least know we owe the people who saved our hides a debt. And the only way I can see to do that is to give them a voice at the highest level, make sure the rank and file know we\'ve done it, and actually pay that voice some attention... publicly, at least."',

            'The good news was that \'cat populations grew far more slowly than their multiple-birth reproductive patterns might suggest. Samantha\'s four-kitten litter was of about average size, but most females littered no more than once every <<eight to ten|10a:0>> T-years. Given that they lived about two hundred years and remained fertile for a hundred and fifty, that still meant a single mated pair could produce a staggering number of offspring, but the process took much longer than initial impressions might suggest. And it was inevitable that human and \'cat societies were going to be much more intimately intertwined here on Grayson, which lacked the endless forests that provided Sphinx with virtually unlimited habitat for its native sentients. Here, \'cats would have to share the life-sustaining enclaves of humanity, and Honor wondered just how that would affect their adoption rate.',

Honor could just hear the crisp, quiet murmur of his voice, and she smiled as she recalled the poker-faced, noncommittal, almost desperately detached officer she\'d taken to Basilisk Station with her so many years ago. He\'d changed a lot since then, yet he remained just as poised - and handsome - as ever, and his small stature was no handicap among Grayson\'s generally undersized population. In fact, he probably wished it was a problem. Given the fact that female births outnumbered male by <<three-to-one|10a:1>> on Grayson, women were far more aggressive - in their own fashion - here than back in the Star Kingdom, and according to Honor\'s reports from MacGuiness, Venizelos was finding it necessary to beat off Grayson beauties with a stick.',

            'It was her eyes, he thought again. It was the sparkle in those eyes so like and yet so unlike his Steadholder\'s. Grayson was a planet where female births outnumbered male by <<three to one|10a:0>>, and where the only respectable female career for close to a thousand years had been that of wife and mother. That meant competition for mates had always been fierce, even with the Grayson practice of polygamy, and for all their decorous behavior, women had waged the battle between the sexes (and against their competitors) with a will. That was what worried Howard Clinkscales, for he\'d seen exactly that same sparkle in countless female eyes over the years. Usually those eyes had been very young, looking forward to the glories of conquest with all the energy and passion of youth. But even though Allison Harrington\'s eyes were very young looking, they also held the confident assurance of long experience and a dangerously wicked sense of amusement.',

            'Like Katana, PNS Dirk, the ship responsible for the middle interception zone in Turner\'s sector, was one of the older Sword-class ships. That was why the ops plan relegated her to the inner, less risky station and assigned the bigger Nuada to play the role of beater, closing in from <<three|9c:1>> and a half light-minutes beyond the hyper limit to cut any target\'s retreat. The Mars class were expected to come as a nasty surprise to the Manties: almost as large as some of the PN\'s prewar battlecruisers, they took full advantage of the improved EW systems the Navy had acquired from its contacts in the Solarian League... and by reducing magazine space they\'d also managed to pack in nearly twice the broadside of a Sword-class ship but gave up less than twenty gravities in maximum acceleration to do it.',

Honor reached out to the arm of his command chair and tapped a function key, throwing one of the evasion patterns she\'d entered at DuChene\'s station onto McKeon\'s repeater plot.

Two will still have a chance to overhaul us, but only if she\'s got some accel in reserve. But we\'ll be giving One a chance to cut the angle on us and bring us to action short of the limit. Not by much. I estimate we\'ll be in his engagement envelope for no more than twenty-five minutes. To get the shot, though, he\'ll have to conform to our movements... which should put the convoy\'s translation point outside his range on emergence."',
