This is special correspondent Sunny Choy reporting for CNN International. I\x{2019}m live at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, where the world\x{2019}s top collectors are in a frenzied state of bidding for The Palace of Eighteen Perfections. The price has just hit \$90 million. To put this into perspective, a Qianlong vase sold in London for a record-breaking US\$85.9 million in 2010. But that\x{2019}s London. In Asia, the highest price ever achieved was US\$65.4 million for an ink painting by Qi Baishi in 2011.*3 So this painting has already broken TWO world records. Now, about ten minutes ago, the former actress Kitty Pong\x{2014}who is married to billionaire Bernard Tai\x{2014}brought the auction to a standstill when she made an entrance with two gigantic dogs on diamond leashes and began bidding. Right now, there are four others bidding against her. We\x{2019}re told that one is a representative for the Getty Museum in Los Angeles, another suspected bidder is the heiress Araminta Lee Khoo, and there are unconfirmed reports that the third bidder is a representative for the Liu insurance family. We don\x{2019}t know who the fourth mystery bidder is yet. Back to you, Christiane.",

\x{201c}Hey, Peik Lin, I\x{2019}m trying to get on the <<4:55|2>> flight.\x{201d}
\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t want to alarm you, but the situation has gotten progressively worse. Rachel\x{2019}s still unconscious, and her kidneys have shut down. The doctors are running tests, but so far they have no clue what\x{2019}s happening. Frankly, I\x{2019}m losing confidence and I think Rachel should be medically evacuated to Hong Kong, where she can get the best care in the region.\x{201d} \x{201c}I trust you. Do what you think is best. Should I charter a plane?\x{201d} Nick asked.",

Nick stood at the foot of Rachel\x{2019}s bed, watching helplessly as a team of doctors and nurses hovered over her. Two days ago they had been in their suite at the Peninsula, where she had been excitedly packing for her spa weekend with one of her best friends. Don\x{2019}t you have too much fun in Beijing now! No flirting with any sexy librarians, unless it\x{2019}s Parker Posey, Rachel had teased, before giving him the sweetest goodbye kiss. Now her complexion had turned yellow and there were cables, cords, and tubes in her neck and abdomen. It was just so unreal. What happened to his beautiful wife? Why wasn\x{2019}t she getting any better? He couldn\x{2019}t even begin to imagine losing her. No, no, no, he had to wipe that thought out of his mind. She was so strong, so healthy. She was going to be okay. She had her whole life ahead of her. Their whole life together. Nick left the room and walked toward the waiting room. Passing a handicapped toilet, he let himself in and locked the door. He took a few deep breaths, splashed some water on his face, and looked at himself in the mirror. Then he noticed the mirror itself\x{2014}a round, backlit mirror that looked like it came from some pricey design showroom. He glanced around and saw that the whole space had recently been redecorated. Tears started streaming down his face uncontrollably. If Rachel pulled through\x{2014}no\x{2014}when Rachel pulled through this, he was going to build her the most insanely beautiful bathroom the world had ever seen.",
