            "At <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> the next morning I stood in a strong wind and light drizzle, wrapped in my dad\x{2019}s old coat, near the lighthouse at the Butt of Lewis - trying to think of a good joke about that to tell my brother - and wishing I\x{2019}d brought a brolly. I hadn\x{2019}t been able to decide whether this really was the most north-westerly point of the island - there was a place with the appropriate name of Gallan Head that might have done as well - but in the end I thought maybe it didn\x{2019}t really matter that much, and anyway this headland was easier to get to.",

            "Ashley had been ravenous when she\x{2019}d arrived at the house in Park Terrace <<a little after seven that Sunday evening|9h>>, so she\x{2019}d just dumped her bags and we\x{2019}d gone straight out to the restaurant. When we got back after the meal, I showed her round the place. We opened a bottle of Graves I had in the kitchen - after first agreeing that of course we shouldn\x{2019}t - and then walked from room to room while I did my guided tour bit and pointed out the more interesting or valuable works of art, while we sipped our wine and the statues gleamed and the chandeliers glittered and the paintings glowed and the carpets spread before us like gigantic blow-ups of oddly symmetrical printed circuits.",
