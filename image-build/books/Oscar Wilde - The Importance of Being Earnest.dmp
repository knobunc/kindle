We can\'t both be christened Ernest. It\'s absurd. Besides, I have a perfect right to be christened if I like. There is no evidence at all that I have ever been christened by anybody. I should think it extremely probable I never was, and so does Dr. Chasuble. It is entirely different in your case. You have been christened already.',

You never returned. A few weeks later, through the elaborate investigations of the Metropolitan police, the perambulator was discovered at <<midnight|13>>, standing by itself in a remote corner of Bayswater. It contained the manuscript of a three-volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality. [MISS PRISM starts in involuntary indignation.] But the baby was not there!
