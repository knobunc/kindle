            "Next, a string of dangling hair ribbons paraded before her, pinned like wet hose to a stretch of twine. Sophronia\x{2019}s dress today was a pale-yellow-and-blue ruffled monstrosity her mother insisted would do, even though it had been worn three seasons already, by <<three|9:0>> older sisters. Sophronia\x{2019}s absence from the Temminnick household was combined with an absence from Temminnick expenses. She hadn\x{2019}t had a new gown in ages. One of the ribbons was cream and blue in a similar shade to her outfit, so Sophronia unclipped it. Because her hair was covered\x{2014}as it should be\x{2014}by a respectable bonnet, she tied the ribbon about her neck in the complex knot of a Bunson\x{2019}s boy. Bunson and Lacroix\x{2019}s Boys\x{2019} Polytechnique was an evil genius training academy, sort of a sibling school to Mademoiselle Geraldine\x{2019}s. If one thought of those siblings as hostile and estranged.",

She resolved, once they reached London, to acquire gentleman\x{2019}s dress, upper- and lower-class. Plus a fake mustache. Where does one purchase a mustache in London? Fleet Street?

            '<<Around midnight|3b>> on a fine clear Thursday in mid-March, a lone cloud wafted over west London toward Hyde Park. There it stopped and hovered in a most un-cloud-like manner. It hesitated and then headed purposefully toward the grounds of the Crystal Palace, where the Great Exhibition halls were being torn down. It sunk low enough to touch the top of the center post, where once massive buildings had housed engines of industry.',

Its bottom half was still barge shaped, but all sleek and elegant. Its blimp was sleek as well, an elongated almond with no patches from cannon fire and no extraneous ropes or ladders. The balloon was made of silk and oiled to a dark <<midnight|13>> purple. The ship glided in over a jubilant crowd and sank to land at the center of Hyde Park, some distance away from the embarrassingly emblazoned Mademoiselle Geraldine\x{2019}s.",

This was nothing like Giffard\x{2019}s landing earlier that day. This was a private nighttime affair, and the constabulary were present to ensure it stayed private. These were not any old crushers, either. They wore the silver and wooden weaponry of men who specialized in the supernatural. Not that there would be much activity in Hyde Park so early at night. After supper was a time used to dress. Things weren\x{2019}t actually supposed to happen at <<nine o\x{2019}clock in the evening|6>>. It was a most unfashionable hour to run a test, even covertly.
