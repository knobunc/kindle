There had been sudden approval of certain long-pending international loans, conferences between the Secretary of State and, in some cases, the President himself and certain Ambassadors.

Ignoring the immediate murmur that arose through the chamber as everyone turned to follow his movements, Cullee got up and, looking neither to right nor left, carried the paper down the aisle to the desk of the President Pro Tempore. Again the whisper stopped, and in the silence the old man could be seen, first looking vaguely then gradually focusing, upon the tall young figure before him. \x{201c}What are you\x{2014}what\x{2014}\x{201d} he began again in a baffled whisper, and Cullee whispered back, \x{201c}For you, from the President.\x{201d} \x{201c}Thank you, sir,\x{201d} Seab Cooley whispered slowly. \x{201c}I do thank you, sir.\x{201d} But it was obvious as Cullee bowed and then returned, looking sad and stricken, to his seat beside the Secretary, that the message of the President was not going to be read by its recipient. He made the attempt, continuing to whisper something that even Bob Munson, leaning forward to glimpse Orrin\x{2019}s carefully large printing as it lay on the desk before them, could not understand; but it was obvious that the words did not penetrate. Then with a great, visible effort of will, Seab straightened his shoulders and opened another book and, although he clearly could no longer perceive its contents, whispered doggedly on.",

            'By <<10:30 p.m.|2a>>, all the guests having arrived, both dance bands were performing at the peak of their noise and brilliance, both dance areas were filled with swooping, dashing, laughing occupants. The ball was moving at a high pitch of felicity that pleased the Secretary-General as he finally left the reception line and stood for a moment beside the information desk in the central lobby. Many distinguished persons were present, the Ambassador of Panama, Lord and Lady Maudulayne, Raoul and Celestine Barre, many another famous delegate and his lady, many members of the press, several movie stars and actors from Broadway, many members of the Secretariat, the Governor of New York, the Secretary of State, famous statesmen, famous thinkers, famous people. The affair was going well, the S.-G. could sense it. He felt well pleased. Not even Ghana and Guinea, who had submitted formal written protests to his office this morning because of his intervention in the debate, looked sour tonight. They had greeted him cheerfully and now were dancing with an air as gay and carefree as that of all the rest.',
