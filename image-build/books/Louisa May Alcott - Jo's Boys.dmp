            "\x{201c}I have made up my mind on one point,\x{201d} said Mrs Jo with great firmness. \x{201c}I will not answer this kind of letter. I\x{2019}ve sent at least six to this boy, and he probably sells them. This girl writes from a seminary, and if I send her one all the other girls will at once write for more. All begin by saying they know they intrude, and that I am of course annoyed by these requests; but they venture to ask because I like boys, or they like the books, or it is only <<one|9f>>. Emerson and Whittier put these things in the wastepaper-basket; and though only a literary nursery-maid who provides moral pap for the young, I will follow their illustrious example; for I shall have no time to eat or sleep if I try to satisfy these dear unreasonable children\x{201d} and Mrs Jo swept away the entire batch with a sigh of relief.",

            "\x{201c}So it is; but all the more honour to those who are brave and wise enough to resist public opinion, and the easygoing morals of bad or careless men and women. Think of the persons whom you respect most, and in imitating them you will secure the respect of those who look up to you. I\x{2019}d rather my boys should be laughed at and cold-shouldered by a hundred foolish fellows than lose what, once gone, no power can give them back\x{2014}innocence and self-respect. I don\x{2019}t wonder you find it \x{2018}hard to toe the mark\x{2019}, when books, pictures, ball-rooms, theatres, and streets offer temptations; yet you can resist, if you try. Last winter Mrs Brooke used to worry about John\x{2019}s being out so late reporting; but when she spoke to him about the things he must see and hear on his way to and fro from the office at <<midnight|13>>, he said in his sober way, \x{2018}I know what you mean, mother; but no fellow need to go wrong unless he wants to\x{2019}.\x{201d}",
