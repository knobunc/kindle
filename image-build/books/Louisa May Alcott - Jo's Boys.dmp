I\x{2019}ve sent at least six to this boy, and he probably sells them. This girl writes from a seminary, and if I send her one all the other girls will at once write for more. All begin by saying they know they intrude, and that I am of course annoyed by these requests; but they venture to ask because I like boys, or they like the books, or it is only <<one|9f>>. Emerson and Whittier put these things in the wastepaper-basket; and though only a literary nursery-maid who provides moral pap for the young, I will follow their illustrious example; for I shall have no time to eat or sleep if I try to satisfy these dear unreasonable children\x{201d} and Mrs Jo swept away the entire batch with a sigh of relief.",

            "MRS JO often thought that Dan had Indian blood in him, not only because of his love of a wild, wandering life, but his appearance; for as he grew up, this became more striking. At <<twenty-five|9u:1>> he was very tall, with sinewy limbs, a keen, dark face, and the alert look of one whose senses were all alive; rough in manner, full of energy, quick with word and blow, eyes full of the old fire, always watchful as if used to keep guard, and a general air of vigour and freshness very charming to those who knew the dangers and delights of his adventurous life. He was looking his best as he sat talking with \x{201c}Mother Bhaer\x{201d}, one strong brown hand in hers, and a world of affection in his voice as he said:",

Think of the persons whom you respect most, and in imitating them you will secure the respect of those who look up to you. I\x{2019}d rather my boys should be laughed at and cold-shouldered by a hundred foolish fellows than lose what, once gone, no power can give them back\x{2014}innocence and self-respect. I don\x{2019}t wonder you find it \x{2018}hard to toe the mark\x{2019}, when books, pictures, ball-rooms, theatres, and streets offer temptations; yet you can resist, if you try.
