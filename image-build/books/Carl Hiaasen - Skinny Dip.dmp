            "The detective shrugged. Telling Gallo the truth wouldn\x{2019}t have accomplished anything. He would have scoffed at Rolvaag\x{2019}s field trip as a waste of time, which it most definitely was not. Using Marta\x{2019}s map, Rolvaag had located by automobile a sampling site adjacent to Hammernut Farms. There he had waded barefoot into the cattails and filled three mason jars with water the color of root beer, which he\x{2019}d delivered to a professor friend at Florida Atlantic University. Rolvaag\x{2019}s amateur samples had revealed illegal levels of suspended phosphorus at <<317|9c:0>>, 327 and 344 parts per billion, respectively. The figures contrasted dramatically with Dr. Charles Perrone\x{2019}s suspiciously consistent findings of only 9 ppb in the runoff from the vegetable fields.",
