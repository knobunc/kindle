He came up the steps jauntily enough, considering he was in his seventies, and before he had his hat and gloves off he\x{2019}d challenged Stanley to a game of checkers. The two of them played wordlessly through the afternoon and into the evening, and the next morning at <<eight|3j>> the doctor appeared with two iron posts and a set of horseshoes under his arm.

They typically exchanged a few words, mainly of the hello-how-are-you-fine variety, and went on about their business.

Dear Eddie:Enclosed please find my check in the amount of \$3,500, your share in the proceeds of the sale of our Goleta property. The orange trees never prospered as we\x{2019}d hoped, but I and my partners were able recently to sell the property to a housing contractor, at a small profit.But Eddie, I want to tell you that this is nothing compared to what you can make in stocks and bonds. Don\x{2019}t pay the slightest attention to all these scare stories in the newspapers, men jumping out windows and etc., because the big stocks, the Blue Chips, have never been a better bargain. American Can, Anaconda Copper, Montgomery Ward, United Carbide and Carbon, Westinghouse E. & M., these stocks are sure to rise through the roof on the next buying surge, and believe me, the Great Bull Market isn\x{2019}t dead yet, not by a long shot.Enclosed for your convenience is a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Just put that check inside and send it on back here, and I guarantee you I\x{2019}ll triple that \$500 profit of yours in six months\x{2019} time or my name isn\x{2019}tJim IsringhausenO\x{2018}Kane had to take a minute to catch his breath.

And what Giovannella wouldn\x{2019}t do to get her hands on that check\x{2014}three thousand five hundred dollars, and the five hundred of it pure profit, for doing nothing more than sitting on his hands. And what was Mart\x{2019}s share in that, for the hundred he\x{2019}d invested? Something like what, seventeen dollars? And of course he\x{2019}d give it to him, right out of his own pocket, unless... well, unless he reinvested it for him, and nobody the wiser. No one knew about this check but him and here was the envelope to seal it up and send it right back to make another thousand dollars profit by June. Sure. And hadn\x{2019}t Jim Isringhausen steered him right the first time?",
