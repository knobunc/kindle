            '[19:44] The Pearl - John Steinbeck.epub (OEBPS/html/9780141185125_ThePearl_000.html) - 1944',
            "By <<1944|9n:0>>\x{2013}1945, when he wrote his novella The Pearl, he had pretty much decided that his view of himself was more credible than the versions the media, or the FBI, had created. But these years of personal questioning, and personal quest, had caused Steinbeck to come to terms with what wealth meant, with what an obsession with wealth (and in his case, perhaps, fame) could do to a community, as well as to the identity of the person experiencing that wealth and fame. As he had done before, he drew his personal convictions into the frame of the story he was writing, and when he chose the title for The Pearl, he intended readers to recall the biblical \x{201c}pearl of great price.\x{201d} In that parable, the jewel for which the merchant trades everything he owns becomes the metaphor for Heaven. Everything in a person\x{2019}s earthly existence is worthless when compared with the joys of living with the Eternal Father in His Kingdom, or so the gospel of Matthew states.",
