            "There were times when the Kalahari hosted much higher densities of animal life than it does now. The sheer number of animals still supported by the wetlands in the Okavango Delta provides a sense of how prolific animal life must have been in the northern Kalahari when it was a complex of shallow mega-lakes eleven millennia ago. But even fifty years ago the vast dry plains of the Kalahari supported almost unimaginably large herds of wildebeest, springbok, and hartebeest that migrated along well-established routes to seasonal water sources. !Xo Bushmen in the southern Kalahari and G/wikhoe on the eastern edge of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in Botswana still remember watching herds that would stretch far beyond the horizon and take as long as three or four days to pass. These herds were wiped out in the end by Botswana\x{2019}s love affair with beef, as a result of which a series of veterinary cordon fences were erected <<after 1954|18:0>> to prevent the spread of diseases among their cattle. With their traditional migratory paths to seasonal watering points blocked, migratory wildebeest perished of thirst in the tens of thousands, their carcasses littering the fence line. In 1983 alone it was estimated that up to seventy-two thousand wildebeest died attempting to navigate a fence that blocked their access to Lake Xau just north of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve.",

            "Throughout the military occupation of Nyae Nyae, <<around 150|9u>> Ju/\x{2019}hoansi out of a total adult population of some 1,000 people served in the South African army at any one time. All who joined up pocketed the equivalent of \$600 USD every month in addition to various combat bonuses. This translates into around \$2,000 USD per month by 2015 standards. All of this income was disposable. No Ju/\x{2019}hoansi in Nyae Nyae had regular overheads like rent, school fees, or a utility bill. Additionally, because the military also provided military families in Nyae Nyae with food rations in the form of maize porridge, oil, sugar, and meat, they also didn\x{2019}t have to spend much on food. Despite this, only a few soldiers saved any of their money. Many blew the bulk of their salaries within hours of being issued them by the paymaster general in cash-stuffed brown envelopes. With the bottle shop usually the first stop after the paymaster\x{2019}s truck, many Ju/\x{2019}hoan soldiers recall paydays when they awoke in the night to discover they were penniless, with nothing to show for the preceding month\x{2019}s soldiering.",

            'By <<1700|9:0>> the Cape Colony had not expanded much farther beyond the mountains that curtain Cape Town, isolating it from the African interior. But after nearly half a century of Dutch rule, established settlers developed ambitions for their colony to be more than a mere service depot for passing shipping. The Cape had also revealed itself to be good farmland, and many former Dutch East India Company employees chose to remain there and farm when their formal terms of service expired. The colonial population was further swelled by immigrants like the French Huguenots fleeing religious persecution and who in time would, along with the Dutch, form the core of modern Afrikaner society. With almost all of these immigrants keen to make a living from the soil, the colony expanded rapidly northward and eastward.',

By <<1750|9:1>> the colony had expanded several hundred miles inland. By then most of the fifteen thousand or so indigenous Khoisan living in the southern Cape at the time the Dutch arrived had been driven away or wiped out by disease, most notably a small pox epidemic that struck in 1713.

            "In spring of 1904 the German zoologist, linguist, anatomist, and philosopher Leonard Schultze was having the adventure of a lifetime. He had spent several months traveling to German South-West Africa (now Namibia). In addition to evaluating the fishing potential of Namibian coasted waters on behalf of the German colonial office, he hoped to collect a range of zoological specimens to take back to Germany. But his plans were upset by the outbreak of war that year as the German colonial authorities sought at first to subdue and then exterminate the two most powerful peoples in central Namibia, the Nama and the Herero. The Nama were descendants of indigenous cattle- and sheep-herding populations in the Cape of Good Hope on Africa\x{2019}s southern tip. By <<1904|9u>>, they had adopted Western dress, weapons, and religion. The Herero were a pastoralist people who had dominated much of central Namibia from the eighteenth century onward. Determined not to let what became the most brutal colonial genocide of the twentieth century ruin his trip, Schultze reported cheerfully that instead of collecting zoological specimens while battle raged he would instead \x{201c}make use of the victims of the war to take parts from fresh native corpses\x{201d} for the \x{201c}study of the living body.\x{201d}",
