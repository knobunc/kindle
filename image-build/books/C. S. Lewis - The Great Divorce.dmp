            "CLIVE STAPLES LEWIS (1898\x{2013}1963) was one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century and arguably the most influential Christian writer of his day. He was a Fellow and tutor in English literature at Oxford University until <<1954|18:0>> when he was unanimously elected to the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge University, a position he held until his retirement. He wrote more than thirty books, allowing him to reach a vast audience, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year. His most distinguished and popular accomplishments include The Chronicles of Narnia, Out of the Silent Planet, The Four Loves, The Screwtape Letters, and Mere Christianity. To learn more about C. S.

            "\x{2018}And then, he got the new job. A great step up. But what do you think? Instead of realising that we now had a chance to spread out a bit, all he said was \x{201c}Well now, for God\x{2019}s sake let\x{2019}s have some peace.\x{201d} That nearly finished me. I nearly gave him up altogether: but I knew my duty. I have always done my duty. You can\x{2019}t believe the work I had getting him to agree to a bigger house, and then finding a house. I wouldn\x{2019}t have grudged it one scrap if only he\x{2019}d taken it in the right spirit\x{2014}if only he\x{2019}d seen the fun of it all. If he\x{2019}d been a different sort of man it would have been fun meeting him on the doorstep as he came back from the office and saying, \x{201c}Come along, Bobs, no time for dinner to-night. I\x{2019}ve just heard of a house near Watford and I\x{2019}ve got the keys and we can get there and back by <<one o\x{2019}clock|6>>.\x{201d} But with him! It was perfect misery, Hilda. For by this time your wonderful Robert was turning into the sort of man who cares about nothing but food.",

            "\x{2018}He has forbidden it. That\x{2019}s what I\x{2019}m telling ye.\x{2019} As he said this he looked more Scotch than ever. I was gazing steadfastly on his face. The vision of the chessmen had faded, and once more the quiet woods in the cool light before sunrise were about us. Then, still looking at his face, I saw there something that sent a quiver through my whole body. I stood at that moment with my back to the East and the mountains, and he, facing me, looked towards them. His face flushed with a new light. A fern, thirty yards behind him, turned golden. The eastern side of every tree-trunk grew bright. Shadows deepened. All the time there had been bird noises, trillings, chatterings, and the like; but now suddenly the full chorus was poured from every branch; cocks were crowing, there was music of hounds, and horns; above all this ten thousand tongues of men and woodland angels and the wood itself sang. \x{2018}It comes, it comes!\x{2019} they sang. \x{2018}Sleepers awake! It comes, it comes, it comes.\x{2019} One dreadful glance over my shoulder I essayed\x{2014}not long enough to see (or did I see?) the rim of the sunrise that shoots Time dead with golden arrows and puts to flight all phantasmal shapes. Screaming, I buried my face in the fold of my Teacher\x{2019}s robe. \x{2018}The morning! The morning!\x{2019} I cried, \x{2018}I am caught by the morning and I am a ghost.\x{2019} But it was too late. The light, like solid blocks, intolerable of edge and weight, came thundering upon my head. Next moment the folds of my Teacher\x{2019}s garment were only the folds of the old ink-stained cloth on my study table which I had pulled down with me as I fell from my chair. The blocks of light were only the books which I had pulled off with it, falling about my head. I awoke in a cold room, hunched on the floor beside a black and empty grate, the clock striking <<three|11>>, and the siren howling overhead.",
