         water and have a snack on my journey, but I still arrived weary; perhaps the lack
         of sleep had caught up with me. But then, too, the last three hundred yards to reach
         the lighthouse were tension-filled, as I kept remembering the surveyor\x{2019}s warning.
         I had a gun out, held down by my side, for all the good it would do against a high-powered
         rifle. I kept looking at the little window halfway up its swirled black-and-white
         surface, and then to the large panoramic windows at the top, alert for any movement.",

         to base camp. If I kept up a steady pace, I might make it back by <<midnight|13>>. There
         was some advantage in arriving at an unexpected hour, given how I had left things
         with the surveyor. Something also warned me against staying at the lighthouse overnight.
         Perhaps it was just the unease from seeing the strangeness of the psychologist\x{2019}s wound
         or perhaps I still felt as if a presence inhabited that place, but regardless I set
         out soon after gathering up my knapsack full of supplies and my husband\x{2019}s journal.
         Behind me lay the increasingly solemn silhouette of what was no longer really a lighthouse
         but instead a kind of reliquary. As I stared back, I saw a thin green fountain of
         light gushing up, framed by the curve of the dunes, and felt even more resolve to
         put miles between us. It was the psychologist\x{2019}s wound, from where she lay on the beach,
         glowing more brightly than before. The suggestion of some sped-up form of life burning
         fiercely did not bear close scrutiny. Another phrase I had seen copied in her journal
         came to mind: There shall be a fire that knows your name, and in the presence of the strangling
            fruit, its dark flame shall acquire every part of you.",
