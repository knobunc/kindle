            "Of remembered events, several are crucial and presage the tragedy that will overtake the family: the violent incident in the first April when on the father\x{2019}s birthday Kerrin kills the family\x{2019}s dog; the appearance of a hardly human beggar from town seeking food from farmers; the expulsion of the mother and daughters from church. There are also the meanings of these events that Marget cannot fathom, and her questioning is a counterpoint to the daily life \x{201c}without any more mystery than the <<noon|13>> sun\x{201d} (p. 33). Over and over she asks herself about the burden of debt the family bears, the family\x{2019}s unending toil, its cruel interpersonal blindness, and its frail love. \x{201c}There must be some reason, I thought, why we should go on year after year, with this lump of debt, scrailing earth down to stone, giving so much and with no return. There must be some reason why I was made quiet and homely and slow, and then given this stone of love to mumble\x{201d} (pp. 127\x{2013}28).",

            "Yet, there is evidence here and in Johnson\x{2019}s later work and life that Johnson would place women in a closer relation to nature than men. But consistent with her philosophical stance, neither in these works nor in her short stories or later novels is there evidence that she would judge this separation as anything but a radical and natural separation of the spheres. The male figures are treated with deep sympathy\x{2014}their layer of hardness, their blindness to what lies in the dark a functional adaptation born of circumstance. Given the family responsibility they face, Johnson\x{2019}s men would prefer the clear light at <<noon|13>> to the deep mysteriousness of dark, the conventional, social world with its predictable rules to the strange and terrible beauty of nature. \x{201c}Father,\x{201d} Marget says, \x{201c}couldn\x{2019}t see the masterpiece of a maggot,\x{201d} and \x{201c}we could not see the heaviness of his responsibility\x{201d} (p. 36). There is a sympathy too in Johnson\x{2019}s early work toward men who must live with women, and, at the same time, are separated from them by \x{201c}the thick wall of kind.\x{201d} In Now in November, the narrator describes women as she imagines a man would see them. Marget surmises that her father is irritated at \x{201c}women-voices,\x{201d} the girls\x{2019} \x{201c}cackling and squawking . . . picking and pecking at lives of other people\x{201d} (p. 36) and unsettled by his sense that women \x{201c}moved around and did things . . . a long way off\x{2014}a place from which they might step across [a] gulf to marry a man, but anytime might go back again\x{201d} (p. 63).",

            "We went slow in the hot sun. Merle was quiet, thinking, I guess, of all the chickens whose nests still had to be filled, and of the lame one who broke all her eggs but wanted so steadfastly to hatch that it was pitiful, though Merle hated her stupidness and the egg-stuck, smelly hay. It was <<almost two|9f>>, and it seemed as if doing nothing at all took up time faster and more unknowing of what it swallowed than work had ever done. We walked up the cow-path where the ground was dry and warm, and alongside the thistles coming up. We could see Dad ploughing again already and robins come down in the furrows but keeping a long way off from the plough. There was a blue-smoke smell from burning brush and a warm haze in the air. Merle walked first, round and with a clean skin, and her mouth full of the one left piece of bread, and her hair messed up and woolly in the back; and then I came, not looking comparable to much of anything, with a brown dress on and beggar-lice seeds in my stockings; and then Kerrin straggled along behind, acting as though she might leave us any minute. She had reddish hair cut off in a bang, and her arms like two flat laths hung down loose from her shoulders, but her face was much sharper and more interesting than ours. She was stronger, too, and thought she could plough if Father\x{2019}d let her. But he thought that a girl could never learn how and would only mess the field. \x{201c}You help your mother, girls,\x{201d} he\x{2019}d say. \x{201c}You help your mother.\x{201d} He hired a man to work for a while and Kerrin was angry, felt things pounding in her, impotent and suppressed, and was sullen and lowering as the young bulls are. \x{201c}He thinks I can\x{2019}t do anything!\x{201d} she\x{2019}d shout at Mother. \x{201c}He treats me as if I were still two.

            "THOSE years went slowly for us. Slow because heavy with the weight of things done, and the greater weight of things unfinished and still to be learned. The seasons washed one into another and were never still, but there was no swiftness nor anything but calm and gradual change. Sometimes not even that, but a shifting back and forth of seasons . . . long stretches of rain in the December mud, and a wind like April over winter snow . . . late pea-vines springing up at Thanksgiving, and marsh-violets in the sleet, and at times the orchards would be white in autumn, the trees wasting their strength before the spring. And there was the double life, the two parts not within each other nor even parallel. The one made up of things done day after day with comfort and soberness, hard sometimes but solid\x{2014}things you could lay your hands on and feel that they were there: the saucepans and heavy dishes, the thick cups and the five beds to be made\x{2014}things without any more mystery than the <<noon|13>> sun had. The open life and the one that was greater of the two, calm, prosaic . . . rational. And there was the inner walking on the edge of darkness, the peering into black doorways . . . the unrevealed answer which must be somewhere, and yet might not be even present or hidden in that darkness . . . this under-life which when traced or held to was not there, and yet kept coming back and thrust up like an iron dike through the solid layers of the sane and understood. The moment of self-searching, of standing under the oaks at night and asking\x{2014}What? Who? What am I? . . . and the moment of feeling the self gone, lost or never existent. Where am I, God? . . . the terrible desire to understand . . . the moment of realization that there are some things that are neither bad nor good, nor ever to be classified . . . the strangeness that Kerrin had . . . things that like shards of a meteorite imply the presence of worlds beyond comprehension or understanding. And there was the desire for source\x{2014}the desire to understand cause, which is the heart-root of religion, and led the mind through such devious and dark tunnels, and brought it out nowhere. These years marked by the dark torment of adolescence\x{2014}that time when a fallen nail unlifted or a tuft of sheep\x{2019}s wool is torture at night with fear and accusation. When dreams are portent or promise, and there is meaning and symbol in the crossing of two branches or a shadow\x{2019}s length. . . . But all the time in the back of these things there was the hill-quiet and the stony pastures, and sometimes they made me ashamed of being what I was\x{2014}human and full of a thousand wormy thoughts and selfishness, but more often they were like hands to heal.",

He was slow and fumbled the harness, jerked and thumped at the horses until they pounded the walls.

She used to feed them at <<noon|13>> and toss in corn, kind and yet viciously, damning their eagerness.

The air had been hot and still, storm-quiet and dark; but for a week clouds ominous and storm-surfed had been covering the sky and dissolving into nothing. The sunsets were clear and crystal as after a great rain, but not one drop had fallen. Now we saw the clouds tower up and reach forward like great waves, and there was the bull-mumbling of thunder.

It got darker and a fierce wind whipped our clothes, and Merle was wild with excitement and the cold rushing of air. We saw Kerrin running up from the barn, lashed back and forth like a willow switch, and the sheep poured down along the road in a lumpy flood, baaing and crying toward the barn. I wanted to run and shriek, get wings and flap like the swooping crows. Grant looked ten years younger, shouted and called like a boy.

She\x{2019}s here, I tell you!\x{201d} He ran toward the cellar steps just as the first drops fell, hard-splashing and wide apart. He staggered back up with the wash-tubs, and the drops struck down like a noise of hammers on hollow tin. There was a wonderful brightness on Mother\x{2019}s face, a sort of light shining from it, almost a rapt and mystic look as she stood there with flower-pots dangling from her hand.",

            "It was a long walk up to the school, and I wondered sometimes, plodding those miles of dust and living each moment only for the times when a tree cast its thin dry shade, why there was always such hurry with everyone to spread the news of a death. Why should we have to know so soon? Why was I struggling here through the hot <<noon|13>> sun so that Whit could know, only a few hours sooner, something the knowing of which would help neither him nor anyone else? Always when someone dies, before even their eyes are closed the bitter knowledge of it is rushed to those who will care the most, as though they who witnessed the death grudged even a half-hour\x{2019}s kind oblivion to the rest. Besides, I knew Whit Hutton\x{2019}s uncle, and knew that if a hay-hoist had fallen and smashed his head to a bloody pod it was because he had been too drunk to know where his feet were standing, and that now there was at least one less for Stella to feed and shove out at night. But now there would be a big funeral, and Wallace, who skirted a church all his life and passed it by like a quicksand-bog, would be laid with the other Huttons under a hideous family monument, the shadow of which looked always like a monstrous slop-pail squatting above the graves.",

It was <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> but the sun was still hot as <<noon|13>>, the vines dead on the pillars\x{2014}only strings left with a few dry leaves. When the cows moved near the barn, dust flew up in thick clouds and settled back ankle-deep in the hoof marks.",
