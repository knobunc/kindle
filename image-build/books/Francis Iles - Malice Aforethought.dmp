By a <<quarter to four|10>> the affair was in full progress.
The Torrs, as usual, had been the first to arrive. There were four Torrs\x{2014}the Rev. Hessary and his wife, his daughter, Quarnian, and his son, Benjie. Where Mr. Torr led, Miss Wapsworthy and Miss Peavy were never far behind; they were the next arrivals. But neither played tennis, and the first set could not be arranged until the two young Ridgeways, Harford and his sister Ivy, made their appearance. Mrs. Bickleigh then deftly split the families (it was always Mrs. Bickleigh who arranged the sets at Fairlawn), and Quarnian Torr and Harford Ridgeway were sent to play Ivy Ridgeway and Benjie Torr. This set had been played at least fifty times before in Wyvern\x{2019}s Cross, and all four players knew that the former pair would beat the latter by six games to two. They always did; but the inevitability never made the least difference to Benjie losing his temper about it in the fifth game.",
