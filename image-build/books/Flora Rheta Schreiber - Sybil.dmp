Standing with Sybil in front of Whittier Hall, Teddy noted that the top of the doctor\'s convertible was down, and she fussed about whether Sybil had a scarf to protect her against the elements. When Sybil said that she had, Teddy cautioned that even so it was too cool to drive with the top of the car down. And although both Sybil and the doctor assured her that they would be all right, she remained unconvinced.

            'Waking up at <<4:45 A.m.|2a>> on August 8, Sybil recognized that she had very definite "Peggy feelings." She closed her eyes and drifted for a few seconds to see if she could discover what Peggy wanted. Purple boats with green sails came into Sybil\'s mind\'s eye. She had once done a painting of sagebrush in Professor Klinger\'s class, but she had never had a very high regard for the combination of purple and green. Then Peggy said, "See, there are three pink flags on the ship." Sybil got out of bed. It was <<5:00 A.m.|2a>>, too early to go job hunting. She decided to give Peggy the chalk and paper to make purple and green boats with pink flags. A dreadful mixture, Sybil thought, but why not please Peggy? At <<six|9m:0>> Peggy\'s completed boats were sailing high. Peggy wanted to call the drawing Pink Flags; Sybil preferred Of Ships and Sailing, but in the end Sybil let Peggy have her way.',

He quietly said, "Maybe it\'s not the right time." He put on his coat and walked to the door. "Tomorrow night," he said. "The opera. I\'ll call for you at <<six|9c:1>>. We\'ll have dinner first, some place we haven\'t been before." He kissed her fingertips and was gone.',

He had turned from her in the same way that she had just turned from Ramon. She had turned her back on three children the way a doctor long ago had done to one.',
