In 1952, the Univac was at work processing the 1950 census with a complex program developed by about eight programmers. Other machines were doing chemical dynamics, neutron diffusion calculations, missile performance calculations, etc. Assemblers, relocating linkers and loaders, floating-point interpretive systems, etc. were in routine use. By 1955 people were building 50 to 100 man-year business programs. By 1956 General Electric had in operation a payroll system in its Louisville appliance plant with more than 80,000 words of program. By <<1957|9:0>>, the SAGE ANFSQ/7 air defense computer had been running two years, and a 75,000 instruction communications-based, fail-safe-duplexed real-time system was in operation in 30 sites.
