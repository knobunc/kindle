Occasional gusts set the wind sock fluttering, then all was calm again. The aircraft was a four-engined Lancaster bomber that in the autumn of 1940 had taken part in the Battle of Britain. It had been hit several times by German fighters and forced to make emergency landings, but they had always managed to patch it up and send it back into the fray. Now it was used for transport jobs, taking essential supplies to British troops stationed in defeated and devastated Germany.',

            'The emergency call had reached the Ostersund police station late in the afternoon of October 19. Seven days ago now. Larsson had been on the point of leaving for a haircut when somebody thrust a telephone into his hand. The woman at the other end was shouting. He\'d been forced to hold the receiver away from his ear to grasp what she was saying. Two things were clear from the start: the woman was very upset, and she was sober. He\'d sat at his desk and fumbled for a notepad. After a few minutes he\'d made enough notes to give him a fair picture of what he thought she was trying to make him understand. The woman\'s name was Hanna Tunberg. Twice a month she used to char for a man called Herbert Molin, who lived some miles outside Sveg in a house called Ratmyren. When she arrived that day she\'d found a dog lying dead in its pen, and seen that all the windows in the house were broken. She didn\'t dare stay as she thought the man who lived there must have gone mad. She\'d driven back to Sveg and collected her husband, who had retired on health grounds. They\'d gone back to the house together. It was <<about four in the afternoon|9h>> by then. They\'d considered phoning the police right away, but had decided to wait until they\'d established what had actually happened - a decision they both bitterly regretted. Her husband had entered the house but emerged immediately and shouted to his wife, who\'d stayed in the car, that the place was full of blood. Then he thought he saw something at the edge of the forest. He\'d gone to investigate, taken a step back, then sprinted to the car and started vomiting into the grass. When he\'d recovered sufficiently, they\'d driven straight to Sveg. As her husband had a weak heart, he\'d lain down on the sofa while she phoned the police in Sveg, and they\'d passed the call on to Ostersund. Larsson had noted down the woman\'s name and telephone number. When they\'d finished talking he\'d rung her back in order to check that the number was correct. He also made sure he\'d got the name of the dead man right. Herbert Molin. When he put the receiver down for the second time, he\'d abandoned any thought of having his hair cut.',

It was already dark by then. Larsson could see from the woman\'s eyes that the sight awaiting them would not be a pretty one. They went first to the spot on the edge of the forest that Hanna Tunberg had described to them. They found themselves gasping for breath when they shone their torches on the dead body. Larsson understood the woman\'s horror. He thought he\'d seen everything. He had several times seen suicides who\'d fired a shotgun straight into their faces, but the man on the ground in front of them was worse than anything he\'d been. obliged to look at before. It wasn\'t really a man at all, just a bloody bundle. The face had been scraped away, the feet were no more than; blood-soaked lumps and his back had been so badly beaten that bones were exposed.',

There was quite a wind now. The swishing sound from the forest imposed itself upon the autumn morning. Larsson stood quite still and looked slowly round. The forensic unit had found traces of a car parked exactly where he was standing now: the tracks didn\'t correspond to Molin\'s ancient Volvo. Every time Larsson came to the scene of the murder, he tried to imagine exactly what had happened. Who had clambered out of this unknown car? And when? It must have been during the night. The pathologists still hadn\'t been able to establish the precise time of death. Even so, the writer of the preliminary report had hinted in carefully chosen words that the assault could well have been going on over an extended period of time.

Something Wetterstedt had said, and maybe also Berggren: that in the \'305 and up to <<around 1943|18:1>> or 1944, Nazism had been much more widespread in Sweden than most people nowadays were aware of. There had been various branches of Nazi parties that squabbled between themselves, but behind the men and women in the parades there had been a grey mass of anonymous people who had admired Hitler and would have liked nothing more than a German invasion and the setting up of a Nazi regime in Sweden. He found astonishing information about the government\'s concessions to the Germans, and how exports of iron ore from Sweden had been crucial in enabling the German munitions industry to satisfy Hitler\'s constant demand for more tanks and other war materials. He wondered what had happened to all that history when he was a schoolboy. What he vaguely remembered from his history classes was a very different picture: a Sweden that had succeeded - by means of extremely clever policies and by skilfully walking the tightrope - in staying out of the war. The Swedish government had remained strictly neutral and thus \' saved the country from being crushed by the German military machine. He\'d heard nothing about quantities of home-grown Nazis. What he , was now discovering was an entirely different picture, one which explained Molin\'s actions, his delight at crossing the border into Norway and looking forward to going on to Germany. He could envisage young Mattson-Herzen, his father and mother, and Wetterstedt and the grey mass of people hovering between the lines of the text, or in the blurred background of the photographs of demonstrations by Nazis in Swedish streets.',

An officer had been posted to keep watch over Berggren\'s house. The description they had of the attacker was too imprecise to be sent out and trigger a nationwide alert. On the other hand, reinforcements would arrive from Ostersund the next morning. They\'d mount yet another house to-house operation. Somebody must have seen something, was Larsson\'s conviction. The man must have had a car. There can\'t be all that many English-speaking southern Europeans in Sveg at this time of year. People occasionally came from Madrid or Milan to hunt elk, and the Italians are ardent mushroom pickers, of course. The only thing is, we\'re not in the mushroom-picking or elk-hunting seasons.

            'Somebody had filled up with petrol in Soderkoping, in a red Ford Escort belonging to a man by the name of Herner who had a P.O. box in Portugal. Then somebody had driven the car across much of Sweden and stopped on a country road west of Sveg, and started shooting at a car that was coming from the mountains. They scraped at the dirty receipt but were unable to read the date, although the time was clearly <<20.12|5a:0>>. Larsson thought the forensic people would be able to decipher the date, and they must do that as soon as possible. Somebody sets off from Kalmar for Harjedalen. On the way, in Soderkoping, he stops to fill up with petrol. He continues his journey. He tries to kill the man who most probably was responsible for the murder of Molin. Neither Lindman nor Larsson were the type of police officer who believed in coincidences. Somewhere in the Nazi underworld, inhabited by the likes of Wetterstedt and the Strong Sweden foundation, Lindman\'s visit had stirred up unrest. They couldn\'t be certain that he was the one who\'d broken into the flat. Or could they? Lindman remembered the front door shutting as he left the flat, the feeling that somebody was watching him, the same feeling he\'d had these last few days. "Perhaps two invisible shadows make one visible shadow," he said to Larsson. It could be that the shadow following him in Kalmar was the same as the one in Sveg. The conclusion that Lindman was trying to reach was that their thinking had been closer to the truth than they had dared to believe. It was all to do with the underworld where old Nazis had come across something new that enabled the old madness to join up with the new version. Somebody had broken into this shadow world and killed Molin. A shudder had run through the old Nazis. "The woodlice are starting to crawl out from under stones," as Larsson put it afterwards. Who was the enemy of these Nazis? Was it the man who had killed Molin? Could it mean that Andersson had known about more than just the past of Molin and Berggren, that he\'d known about the whole organisation, and had threatened to expose it and perhaps even something still bigger? They couldn\'t know that. But a Ford Escort had been filled up with petrol and driven to Harjedalen by a man intent on killing somebody. And Berggren had decided to take responsibility for a murder she almost certainly hadn\'t committed. The pattern was becoming clear, and conclusions possible to draw. There was an organisation, to which Lindman\'s own father was continuing to give support long after his death. Molin had been a member, as was Berggren. But not Andersson. Nevertheless, somehow or other he had discovered its existence. On the surface he was a friendly man who played the violin in the Helsingborg Symphony Orchestra, was a paid up member of the Centre Party and also wrote trivial pop songs under the pseudonym of Siv Nilsson. Beneath the surface he was a man with more than one string to his bow. A blackmailer who made threats and demands. And maybe, deep down, was upset at the very thought of living close to an unreformed Nazi.',

            'Lindman put on his jacket and left the Community Centre. The snow felt soft under his feet. It muffled all sounds. Occasional flakes of snow were still drifting down. He kept stopping and turning round, but there was no sign that he was being followed. The whole town was asleep. No light in Veronica Molin\'s window. The funeral was at <<11 a.m.|5>> later that day. They would have plenty of time to get to Sveg if they had decided to stay in Ostersund. He unlocked the front door of the hotel. The two men from yesterday were playing cards again, despite the late hour. They nodded to him as he went past. It was too late to phone Elena now. She\'d be asleep. He undressed, showered and went to bed, thinking about Holmstrom all the time. Discreet, Niklasson had called him. No doubt he could make that impression if he tried, but Lindman had also seen another side of him. Cold as ice and dangerous. He had no doubt at all that it could have been Holmstrom who had tried to kill Hereira. The question was, did he also kill Andersson? What was still unclear was why Berggren had confessed to that murder. It was possible that she was guilty, of course, but Lindman could not believe it. One could take it for granted that Holmstrom would have told her anything that wasn\'t in the newspapers, such as the washing line.',

As they carved their way through the clouds, Stefan experienced a feeling of liberation. For six months he\'d lived with a fear that hardly left him. Now it had gone. It wasn\'t absolutely certain that he was or would ever be fully fit: his doctor had told him he would have to have tests for five years, but to lead a normal life again, not be forever on the look-out for symptoms, not to nourish the fear he had harboured for so long. Now lhat he was in the aeroplane, he felt that at last he\'d really taken that vital step away from the fear, and back to something he\'d long been waiting for.',
