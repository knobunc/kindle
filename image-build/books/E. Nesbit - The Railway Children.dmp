            "The first steam engine was invented by Richard Trevithick. On 21 February 1804 his \x{2018}Penydarren tram road engine\x{2019} pulled ten
               tonnes of iron and seventy men a distance of ten miles along a railway line in south Wales. The engine\x{2019}s top speed was five
               miles per hour, but this was considered a great improvement on the slow progress made by horses hauling wagons.
            

         
             Trevithick\x{2019}s locomotive was considered a novelty and he died a poor man, but his idea was developed and, in 1829, Robert
               and George Stephenson unveiled the Rocket; the first \x{2018}safe\x{2019} passenger train.
            

         
             By <<1845|9n:1>>, in the UK alone, there was a network of 2,440 miles of railway line carrying 30 million passengers per year.
            

         
             Steam trains were superseded by the invention of electric and diesel trains in the 1950s.
            

         
             Work began on the American railroad, which spans the United States, in 1868. Today, the fastest train in America is the electric
               Amtrak train.
            

         
             Until <<2004|9n:1>>, the fastest commercial train in the world was the German InterCity, recorded to have reached a top speed of 243
               miles per hour.
            

         
             Since 2004, the fastest commercial train in the world has been in China \x{2013} the high-speed maglev that connects Pudong airport
               to Shanghai. The train reaches a top speed of 267 miles per hour. Interestingly, a German company manufactured the Shanghai
               Maglev. The idea of an \x{2018}electromagnetic levitation train\x{2019} (first invented by German engineer Hermann Kemper) has been around since 1922, but there
               is still much debate about its efficiency and impact on the environment.
            

         
             Rail enthusiasts, commonly known in the UK as trainspotters and in the US as railfans, are sometimes known by the following
               nicknames: foamers or rail buffs (US), grizzers or gricers (UK), gunzels (Australia). Amongst themselves, they use the term
               ferroequinology (literally, the study of iron horses)!",

         in front of Three Chimneys the daily passage of their six feet began to mark a path across the crisp, short turf. They began
         to know the hours when certain trains passed, and they gave names to them. The <<9.15|5a:1>> up was called the Green Dragon. The 10.7
         down was the Worm of Wantley. The <<midnight|13>> town express, whose shrieking rush they sometimes woke from their dreams to hear,
