            "Eventually, most of the other experts offer congratulations, some of them no doubt grudging. Marlon does. Brian does. Hersom and Geary and Ron Tiekert do. Matt Graham, who finished twenty-fifth at <<18\x{2013}13|9c:1>>, doesn\x{2019}t, but he does demonstrate the self-centered Scrabble behavior he so often mocks: As John Williams is getting ready to hand out the awards, Matt corners him with a rambling request concerning the tournament\x{2019}s so-called brilliancy prize for best strategic move.",

Take away the first and last days, I tell myself and anyone who will listen, and I would have been in the hunt. I went 1\x{2013}9 on those two days and 15\x{2013}6 in between. My pal Eric Chaikin was 0\x{2013}10 and 15\x{2013}6 in the same stretch. Eric the committed logophile and me the full-time Scrabble player. And we lost nineteen out of twenty games! You could line up the twenty highest-rated players in North America, never mind some of the Division 2 meatballs to whom we lost, and we wouldn\x{2019}t go <<1\x{2013}19|5a:0>>. We could blame probability, those awful tiles, Matt\x{2019}s oxygen tank, the woman at the next table humming the Jeopardy! theme song. But we don\x{2019}t.",

Two years, I think, and for what? For <<16\x{2013}15|5a:0>>? For mediocrity? This was my valedictory?
