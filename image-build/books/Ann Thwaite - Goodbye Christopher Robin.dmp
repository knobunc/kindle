            "The play that was Milne\x{2019}s first real success was Mr Pim Passes By, which opened at the New Theatre in London on 5 January 1920. It was a hard audience to woo. The great successes of the 1920s were Chu Chin Chow and Hassan, glamorous and specifically exotic musical shows, which fulfilled to perfection people\x{2019}s need for a good night out. In the straight theatre, the playwright\x{2019}s best hope was to make people laugh. He also had to remember all sorts of practical things. Theatres were less well-disciplined places than they usually are today. \x{2018}If yours is an <<8.15|5a:1>> play, you may be sure that the stalls will not fill up till <<8.30|9f>> and you should therefore let loose the lesser-paid members of the cast in the opening scene.\x{2019} You should be careful not to waste your jokes \x{2018}on the first five pages of dialogue\x{2019}. There would be a crackle of stiff white shirtfronts, a jingle of beaded evening bags, a shuffle of programmes as the audience settled themselves into their seats. And at the end of the evening the playwright had to remember that many people, living for instance in Chislehurst, would be catching last trains and missing the final five minutes of every play they ever saw, together, of course, with countless renderings of the national anthem.",

In an introduction to a later edition of The Red House Mystery Milne comments on his agents\x{2019} lack of enthusiasm for the new project. He was, after all, typecast as a humorist. But it was in Milne\x{2019}s nature, and demonstrated throughout his career, to refuse to be typecast. It was always more interesting to try something new. \x{2018}It has been my good fortune as a writer that what I have wanted to write has for the most part proved to be saleable. It has been my misfortune as a businessman that, when it has proved to be extremely saleable, then I have not wanted to write it any more.\x{2019} This would be true in turn of humorous essays, detective stories and children\x{2019}s books.",

From the very beginning the child dominated the household. Inviting Edward Marsh to lunch to meet him (and \x{2018}that great actress Athene Seyler\x{2019}), Milne names the time as <<one-thirty|5k:1>>. \x{2018}It has to be <<1.30|5a:0>>, because Billy insists on his lunch at <<1|9c:0>>.\x{2019} He was then two months old.

The play was not produced until <<1929|9c:0>> \x{2013} after Milne\x{2019}s own success with his children\x{2019}s books \x{2013} but it was as early as 1921 that Milne responded to his agent\x{2019}s suggestion. Curtis Brown had been trying to get managements interested in it earlier, but had reactions to the idea very much like that of the publishers themselves when the book was first written. When they finally accepted it, Methuen had not even had enough faith in the book to pay a guaranteed advance. But in spite of the famous Times Literary Supplement review (\x{2018}As a contribution to natural history, the work is negligible\x{2019}) and Arthur Ransome\x{2019}s in the Bookman (\x{2018}If we judge the book by its aim, it is a failure, like a speech to Hottentots made in Chinese\x{2019}), it is difficult to believe, from the list of editions that followed, that The Wind in the Willows was as much in need of Milne\x{2019}s one-man crusade to publicise it as he always suggested. Already in 1921, thirteen years after its first publication, it had gone into eleven editions. Milne was always pressing it on his friends. In 1919 he wrote of The Wind in the Willows as \x{2018}a book which should be a classic, but is not\x{2019}.",

            "Some people would come to feel the same way about Winnie-the-Pooh. There is no doubt at all, though the links are subtle, that The Wind in the Willows lies behind Winnie-the-Pooh and that, without it, Milne\x{2019}s book might well not have been written. Milne, like Grahame, remembered his childhood as the great, good time. \x{2018}The queer thing is,\x{2019} said Grahame, \x{2018}I can remember everything I felt then. The part of my brain I used from <<four till seven|10>> can never have altered.\x{2019} Coming back to the Thames Valley wakened every recollection for Grahame. Milne had no such clearly defined childhood playground to return to, but it was all there inside his head. E. H. Shepard would report that one of the first questions Milne asked him was indeed whether he had read The Wind in the Willows. This was long before he illustrated it (not until <<1931|18:0>>) and made the link between Grahame and Milne seem ever closer. \x{2018}I realised even then,\x{2019} Shepard said, \x{2018}what a very great influence it had been on him. It all seemed to come from that, and he was quite frank about it. He was an honest bloke; he had an admiration for the book.\x{2019} No wonder that when Curtis Brown wrote to him with the proposal that he should dramatise it, Milne responded like this on 15 November 1921:",

Brooks Atkinson, which urged Milne not to \x{2018}stoop to pot-boilers and routine pieces of hack-work. Mr Milne\x{2019}s knowledge of human nature and his bubbling sense of humor qualify him for more note-worthy achievement.\x{2019} Certainly, he didn\x{2019}t want to write pot-boilers and he had no need to. He regretted having signed a contract with Curtis Brown on 15 November 1922 for three novels: the first was supposed to be published in 1923, following The Red House Mystery. An American editor had been so impressed by that novel that on his next trip to London he made his own contract with Milne, offering him no less than \x{a3}2,000 for the serial rights of his next mystery story. But there never was another one. And his next novel did not appear until <<1931|9c:0>>. Perhaps it was his admiration for Jane Austen, for Samuel Butler, for Thomas Hardy, that made the novel so difficult for him. He was not sure he could write the sort of novel he would want to read.",

It is interesting that in his memoir of his childhood, Christopher Milne himself disputes what he calls his father\x{2019}s \x{2018}cynical\x{2019} attitude. A. A. Milne was obviously putting it forward so strongly to counteract the general idea of \x{2018}<<Vespers|13>>\x{2019} as a sentimental poem about a good little boy saying his prayers. But his son himself felt much closer to Wordsworth\x{2019}s view of childhood than his father\x{2019}s.

She sent it to Vanity Fair in New York. It appeared in January 1923 and she received \$50. Over the years, \x{2018}<<Vespers|13>>\x{2019} proved the most lavish present Milne had ever given his wife.

He was, in fact, Sir Hari Singh, whose financial dealings and involvement with a Mrs Robinson were making headlines in the papers. A few days later Milne wrote: \x{2018}The bother is that it\x{2019}s no good telling you now who \x{201c}Mr A\x{201d} is, but of course I knew weeks ago . . . God how I see life . . . Mrs Robinson has refused an offer to appear on the films, but will merely write her life for the papers instead.

(Stephen Spender, for instance, whose parents had apparently been keen on keeping him from children who were rough, would later speak of the \x{2018}pure horror\x{2019} of Christopher Robin.) Most people probably thought the dedication wholly appropriate and Milne kept his own feelings about royalty to himself most of the time. But on one occasion he could not help speaking out. He was dining at a private house and one of the other guests was Princess Marie Louise, granddaughter of Queen Victoria. It was she who had organised the Queen\x{2019}s Dolls\x{2019} House not long before and she was graciously interested in A. A. Milne, whose tiny leather-bound \x{2018}<<Vespers|13>>\x{2019} was in that exclusive library. \x{2018}I talked to her for about an hour after dinner, said \x{201c}Ma\x{2019}am\x{201d} as little as possible, put my foot in it once or twice probably, withdrew it with a loud sucking noise and continued cheerfully.\x{2019} The princess was foolish enough to lament to him \x{2018}the objection to work shown by the lower classes\x{2019}. Milne swallowed and murmured that, indeed, \x{2018}every one of my friends would rather win \x{a3}50,000 in a sweepstake than by working for it\x{2019}. It was the best he could do on the spur of the moment. Her Royal Highness could perhaps hardly believe that the man she was talking to, whom, of course, she had supposed to be a gentleman, was identifying himself and his friends with \x{2018}the lower classes\x{2019}. Milne reported to Ken, \x{2018}She didn\x{2019}t say anything, but a faint twinge of pain seemed to pass across her face, as if the first violinist were playing out of tune. Very sad.\x{2019}",

At this stage Milne\x{2019}s son had barely heard the words \x{2018}Christopher Robin\x{2019} and most of the boys in Shepard\x{2019}s illustrations were certainly not him.

One wonders how many copies remain in attics along with Ernest Lush singing \x{2018}O for the Wings of a Dove\x{2019} and Harry Lauder\x{2019}s \x{2018}I Love a Lassie\x{2019}.",

It had been first suggested by Curtis Brown in 1921, but was not finally produced until <<1929|9c:0>>. It continued to be a Christmas treat for children for many years, until in the twenty-first century it was supplanted by Alan Bennett\x{2019}s The Wind in the Willows.",

            "The most important thing for Alan Milne in the 1930s was his relationship with his son. As Christopher himself put it in The Enchanted Places: \x{2018}My father, who had derived such happiness from his childhood, found in me the companion with whom he could return there.\x{2019} Not long after Ken\x{2019}s death, the time had come for Olive Rand, to whom Christopher had been so devoted, to leave. At last she felt free to marry; Milne furnished her cottage, which she called <<Vespers|13>>, as a wedding present. At <<nine|9e>>, Christopher was off to a boarding prep school, but in the holidays there would be no one to come between father and son, as there always had been when the boy\x{2019}s first love was his nanny.",

            "In 1936, Milne reported to a friend that the boy \x{2018}is the most completely modest, unspoilt, enthusiastic happy darling in the world. In short, I adore him.\x{2019} Christopher, who had described his father as \x{2018}buttoned up all through his life\x{2019}, did not of course read this letter until he came across it in my biography. It was at this point that boys in the next study at Stowe were playing the record of \x{2018}<<Vespers|13>>\x{2019} over and over again on their wind-up gramophone and driving the \x{2018}happy darling\x{2019} into despair. He was very vulnerable, but most of the time he could forget the books and the bear and get on with his work. He was an even better mathematician than his father, but his cricket, which might have helped him, did not fulfil his father\x{2019}s hopes; he got no further than the Third Eleven.",
