I put him at the bottom of my sister\x{2019}s garden, in the afternoon, at the moment the day begins to turn. Half five maybe.

He is about to turn around \x{2013} but he doesn\x{2019}t know this yet. He is looking at the view and I am looking at him. The sun is low and lovely.

The au pair did not even see it happen, she just looked around to find the child gone, and the plastic seat of the swing still moving. Aileen arrived home to find Evie unwakeably asleep at half <<six in the evening|5>>. There was a trickle of dried blood coming down from the child\x{2019}s mouth \x{2013} not much \x{2013} where she had bitten the inside of her cheek and her pants had been soiled.",

You could be mad about him, as Fiona was, you could be pretty and perfect, you could have plaits that were sweet, and hairbands that stayed put, you could work on your Irish dancing and your songs from Oklahoma! or you could slob about and glower, like me. I was clever. I mean, Fiona was clever in a let\x{2019}s-all-get-a-B-plus sort of way, but I was clever because if I was clever then I would not have to care.",

In the windows of the Shelbourne, you could see the respectable flotsam tucking into their hotel turkey, or lifting their heads to look out on deserted streets. I walked past the locked gates of Stephen\x{2019}s Green, down the empty maw of Grafton Street, the mannequins in the shop windows frozen as if to say: this is it! this is the day! I thought, if I fell down in the road, there would be no one to find me until morning. By the wall of Trinity, I passed a tall couple who looked like tourists. They turned their faces as I walked by, chiming, Happy Christmas, Happy Christmas, and I felt it keenly; the pure shame of it. I did not exist. I would end up breaking windows, just to show that I was real. I would shout his name: my lover who could not risk \x{2013} he could not risk it! \x{2013} a text or a call.",

None of it was right \x{2013} the perfect drink does exist, but it is never, somehow, the one you have in your hand. I worked on, nonetheless, until I was steady and empty and clean. The next day I was worried I had made a noise sitting there; some keening, lowing, honk of pain, but I am pretty sure I kept silent, and that when the day was over, the season slaughtered, I managed, with some dignity, to rise and turn and walk upstairs to bed.",
