            'And all at once I revenged myself in the simplest way, by a
stroke of genius! A brilliant thought suddenly dawned upon me.
Sometimes on holidays I used to stroll along the sunny side of the
Nevsky <<about four o\'clock in the afternoon|6>>. Though it was hardly a
stroll so much as a series of innumerable miseries, humiliations
and resentments; but no doubt that was just what I wanted. I used
to wriggle along in a most unseemly fashion, like an eel,
continually moving aside to make way for generals, for officers of
the guards and the hussars, or for ladies. At such minutes there
used to be a convulsive twinge at my heart, and I used to feel hot
all down my back at the mere thought of the wretchedness of my
attire, of the wretchedness and abjectness of my little scurrying
figure. This was a regular martyrdom, a continual, intolerable
humiliation at the thought, which passed into an incessant and
direct sensation, that I was a mere fly in the eyes of all this
world, a nasty, disgusting fly--more intelligent, more highly
developed, more refined in feeling than any of them, of course--but
a fly that was continually making way for everyone, insulted and
injured by everyone. Why I inflicted this torture upon myself, why
I went to the Nevsky, I don\'t know. I felt simply drawn there at
every possible opportunity.',

arrive. But it was not a question of being the first to arrive. Not
only were they not there, but I had difficulty in finding our room.
The table was not laid even. What did it mean? After a good many
questions I elicited from the waiters that the dinner had been
ordered not for five, but for <<six o\'clock|6>>. This was confirmed at
the buffet too. I felt really ashamed to go on questioning them. It
was only <<twenty-five minutes past five|10>>. If they changed the dinner
hour they ought at least to have let me know--that is what the post
is for, and not to have put me in an absurd position in my own eyes
and ... and even before the waiters. I sat down; the servant began
laying the table; I felt even more humiliated when he was present.
<<Towards six o\'clock|6>> they brought in candles, though there were
lamps burning in the room. It had not occurred to the waiter,
however, to bring them in at once when I arrived. In the next room
two gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating their dinners in
silence at two different tables. There was a great deal of noise,
even shouting, in a room further away; one could hear the laughter
of a crowd of people, and nasty little shrieks in French: there
were ladies at the dinner. It was sickening, in fact. I rarely
passed more unpleasant moments, so much so that when they did
arrive all together punctually at six I was overjoyed to see them,
as though they were my deliverers, and even forgot that it was
incumbent upon me to show resentment.',

struck <<eight|11>>, at last nine. They moved from the table to the sofa.
Zverkov stretched himself on a lounge and put one foot on a round
table. Wine was brought there. He did, as a fact, order three
bottles on his own account. I, of course, was not invited to join
them. They all sat round him on the sofa. They listened to him,
almost with reverence. It was evident that they were fond of him.
"What for? What for?" I wondered. From time to time they were moved
to drunken enthusiasm and kissed each other. They talked of the
Caucasus, of the nature of true passion, of snug berths in the
service, of the income of an hussar called Podharzhevsky, whom none
of them knew personally, and rejoiced in the largeness of it, of
the extraordinary grace and beauty of a Princess D., whom none of
them had ever seen; then it came to Shakespeare\'s being

the room, opposite the sofa, from the table to the stove and back
again. I tried my very utmost to show them that I could do without
them, and yet I purposely made a noise with my boots, thumping with
my heels. But it was all in vain. They paid no attention. I had the
patience to walk up and down in front of them from <<eight o\'clock|6>>

back again. "I walk up and down to please myself and no one can
prevent me." The waiter who came into the room stopped, from time
to time, to look at me. I was somewhat giddy from turning round so
often; at moments it seemed to me that I was in delirium. During
those three hours I was three times soaked with sweat and dry
again. At times, with an intense, acute pang I was stabbed to the
heart by the thought that ten years, twenty years, forty years
would pass, and that even in forty years I would remember with
loathing and humiliation those filthiest, most ludicrous, and most
awful moments of my life. No one could have gone out of his way to
degrade himself more shamelessly, and I fully realised it, fully,
and yet I went on pacing up and down from the table to the stove.
"Oh, if you only knew what thoughts and feelings I am capable of,
how cultured I am!" I thought at moments, mentally addressing the
sofa on which my enemies were sitting. But my enemies behaved as
though I were not in the room. Once--only once--they turned towards
me, just when Zverkov was talking about Shakespeare, and I suddenly
gave a contemptuous laugh. I laughed in such an affected and
disgusting way that they all at once broke off their conversation,
and silently and gravely for two minutes watched me walking up and
down from the table to the stove, TAKING NO NOTICE OF THEM. But
nothing came of it: they said nothing, and two minutes later they
ceased to notice me again. It struck <<eleven|11>>.',

            '"Oh, hush, Liza! How can you talk about being like a book, when
it makes even me, an outsider, feel sick? Though I don\'t look at it
as an outsider, for, indeed, it touches me to the heart.... Is it
possible, is it possible that you do not feel sick at being here
yourself? Evidently habit does wonders! God knows what habit can do
with anyone. Can you seriously think that you will never grow old,
that you will always be good-looking, and that they will keep you
here for ever and ever? I say nothing of the loathsomeness of the
life here.... Though let me tell you this about it--about your
present life, I mean; here though you are young now, attractive,
nice, with soul and feeling, yet you know as soon as I came to
myself just now I felt at once sick at being here with you! One can
only come here when one is drunk. But if you were anywhere else,
living as good people live, I should perhaps be more than attracted
by you, should fall in love with you, should be glad of a look from
you, let alone a word; I should hang about your door, should go
down on my knees to you, should look upon you as my betrothed and
think it an honour to be allowed to. I should not dare to have an
impure thought about you. But here, you see, I know that I have
only to whistle and you have to come with me whether you like it or
not. I don\'t consult your wishes, but you mine. The lowest labourer
hires himself as a workman, but he doesn\'t make a slave of himself
altogether; besides, he knows that he will be free again presently.
But when are you free? Only think what you are giving up here? What
is it you are making a slave of? It is your soul, together with
your body; you are selling your soul which you have no right to
dispose of! You give your love to be outraged by every drunkard!
Love! But that\'s everything, you know, it\'s a priceless diamond,
it\'s a maiden\'s treasure, love--why, a man would be ready to give
his soul, to face death to gain that love. But how much is your
love worth now? You are sold, all of you, body and soul, and there
is no need to strive for love when you can have everything without
love. And you know there is no greater insult to a girl than that,
do you understand? To be sure, I have heard that they comfort you,
poor fools, they let you have lovers of your own here. But you know
that\'s simply a farce, that\'s simply a sham, it\'s just laughing at
you, and you are taken in by it! Why, do you suppose he really
loves you, that lover of yours? I don\'t believe it. How can he love
you when he knows you may be called away from him any minute? He
would be a low fellow if he did! Will he have a grain of respect
for you? What have you in common with him? He laughs at you and
robs you--that is all his love amounts to! You are lucky if he does
not beat you. Very likely he does beat you, too. Ask him, if you
have got one, whether he will marry you. He will laugh in your
face, if he doesn\'t spit in it or give you a blow--though maybe he
is not worth a bad halfpenny himself. And for what have you ruined
your life, if you come to think of it? For the coffee they give you
to drink and the plentiful meals? But with what object are they
feeding you up? An honest girl couldn\'t swallow the food, for she
would know what she was being fed for. You are in debt here, and,
of course, you will always be in debt, and you will go on in debt
to the end, till the visitors here begin to scorn you. And that
will soon happen, don\'t rely upon your youth--all that flies by
express train here, you know. You will be kicked out. And not
simply kicked out; long before that she\'ll begin nagging at you,
scolding you, abusing you, as though you had not sacrificed your
health for her, had not thrown away your youth and your soul for
her benefit, but as though you had ruined her, beggared her, robbed
her. And don\'t expect anyone to take your part: the others, your
companions, will attack you, too, win her favour, for all are in
slavery here, and have lost all conscience and pity here long ago.
They have become utterly vile, and nothing on earth is viler, more
loathsome, and more insulting than their abuse. And you are laying
down everything here, unconditionally, youth and health and beauty
and hope, and at <<twenty-two|9:1>> you will look like a woman of
five-and-thirty, and you will be lucky if you are not diseased,
pray to God for that! No doubt you are thinking now that you have a
gay time and no work to do! Yet there is no work harder or more
dreadful in the world or ever has been. One would think that the
heart alone would be worn out with tears. And you won\'t dare to say
a word, not half a word when they drive you away from here; you
will go away as though you were to blame. You will change to
another house, then to a third, then somewhere else, till you come
down at last to the Haymarket. There you will be beaten at every
turn; that is good manners there, the visitors don\'t know how to be
friendly without beating you. You don\'t believe that it is so
hateful there? Go and look for yourself some time, you can see with
your own eyes. Once, one New Year\'s Day, I saw a woman at a door.
They had turned her out as a joke, to give her a taste of the frost
because she had been crying so much, and they shut the door behind
her. At <<nine o\'clock in the morning|6>> she was already quite drunk,
dishevelled, half-naked, covered with bruises, her face was
powdered, but she had a black-eye, blood was trickling from her
nose and her teeth; some cabman had just given her a drubbing. She
was sitting on the stone steps, a salt fish of some sort was in her
hand; she was crying, wailing something about her luck and beating
with the fish on the steps, and cabmen and drunken soldiers were
crowding in the doorway taunting her. You don\'t believe that you
will ever be like that? I should be sorry to believe it, too, but
how do you know; maybe ten years, eight years ago that very woman
with the salt fish came here fresh as a cherub, innocent, pure,
knowing no evil, blushing at every word. Perhaps she was like you,
proud, ready to take offence, not like the others; perhaps she
looked like a queen, and knew what happiness was in store for the
man who should love her and whom she should love. Do you see how it
ended? And what if at that very minute when she was beating on the
filthy steps with that fish, drunken and dishevelled--what if at
that very minute she recalled the pure early days in her father\'s
house, when she used to go to school and the neighbour\'s son
watched for her on the way, declaring that he would love her as
long as he lived, that he would devote his life to her, and when
they vowed to love one another for ever and be married as soon as
they were grown up! No, Liza, it would be happy for you if you were
to die soon of consumption in some corner, in some cellar like that
woman just now. In the hospital, do you say? You will be lucky if
they take you, but what if you are still of use to the madam here?
Consumption is a queer disease, it is not like fever. The patient
goes on hoping till the last minute and says he is all right. He
deludes himself And that just suits your madam. Don\'t doubt it,
that\'s how it is; you have sold your soul, and what is more you owe
money, so you daren\'t say a word. But when you are dying, all will
abandon you, all will turn away from you, for then there will be
nothing to get from you. What\'s more, they will reproach you for
cumbering the place, for being so long over dying. However you beg
you won\'t get a drink of water without abuse: \'Whenever are you
going off, you nasty hussy, you won\'t let us sleep with your
moaning, you make the gentlemen sick.\' That\'s true, I have heard
such things said myself. They will thrust you dying into the
filthiest corner in the cellar--in the damp and darkness; what will
your thoughts be, lying there alone? When you die, strange hands
will lay you out, with grumbling and impatience; no one will bless
you, no one will sigh for you, they only want to get rid of you as
soon as may be; they will buy a coffin, take you to the grave as
they did that poor woman today, and celebrate your memory at the
tavern. In the grave, sleet, filth, wet snow--no need to put
themselves out for you--\'Let her down, Vanuha; it\'s just like her
luck--even here, she is head-foremost, the hussy. Shorten the cord,
you rascal.\' \'It\'s all right as it is.\' \'All right, is it? Why,
she\'s on her side! She was a fellow-creature, after all! But, never
mind, throw the earth on her.\' And they won\'t care to waste much
time quarrelling over you. They will scatter the wet blue clay as
quick as they can and go off to the tavern ... and there your
memory on earth will end; other women have children to go to their
graves, fathers, husbands. While for you neither tear, nor sigh,
nor remembrance; no one in the whole world will ever come to you,
your name will vanish from the face of the earth--as though you had
never existed, never been born at all! Nothing but filth and mud,
however you knock at your coffin lid at night, when the dead arise,
however you cry: \'Let me out, kind people, to live in the light of
day! My life was no life at all; my life has been thrown away like
a dish-clout; it was drunk away in the tavern at the Haymarket; let
me out, kind people, to live in the world again.\'"',

gentlemanly, good-humoured, candid tone of my letter. With tact and

ached, and besides I had not the face to. I was particularly
pleased with a certain lightness, almost carelessness (strictly
within the bounds of politeness, however), which was apparent in my
style, and better than any possible arguments, gave them at once to
understand that I took rather an independent view of "all that
unpleasantness last night"; that I was by no means so utterly

looked upon it as a gentleman serenely respecting himself should
