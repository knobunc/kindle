            'WITHOUT either of them saying a word they went westward, or what they hoped and thought was westward, Gilgamesh wishing that Enkidu would be the first to speak, and Enkidu, so it seemed, evidently wanting the same of him. It was a haunted land here of fire and frost, of mountains that had the shape of demons, of demons that had the shape of mountains. The sun was low on the distant horizon, but burning with a strange cold <<midday|13>> intensity, like a worm that was eating a hole in the sky. From time to time Gilgamesh saw some strange creature running before them, and raised his bow, and put it down again without shooting; or Enkidu it was who took aim but could not loose a shaft. It was as though the estrangement between them was not quite ended, and it was robbing them both of the will to hunt.',

Sabart\x{e9}s stood there blinking: his friend of many years, his confidante, his more-or-less secretary, his bulwark against annoyance and intrusion\x{2014}now, maddeningly, himself an intruder. These days he had the appearance of a young man, with plump healthy cheeks and vast quantities of wild black hair, the Sabart\x{e9}s of the giddy old Barcelona days, 1902 or so, when they had first met. But for the eyes, the chin, the long thin nose, it would be impossible to recognize him, so familiar had the Sabart\x{e9}s of later years become. One of the minor perversities of the Afterworld was that people seemed to come back at any age at all. It was not easy to get accustomed to. The man who called himself Ruiz looked perhaps sixty, Sabart\x{e9}s no more than twenty, yet they had known each other for nearly seventy years in life and some years more\x{2014}ten? <<Twenty|9k:0>>? A thousand?\x{2014}in this life after life.",

Gilgamesh stared after him, baffled by the depth of Simon\x{2019}s greed. For what? For mere shining stones? That made even less sense to him than the lust after power for power\x{2019}s sake that had driven so many men, and not a few women, into vast and empty exertions. Here was Simon, an intelligent man, a philosopher, even, quivering and sniveling for pretty baubles with childish eagerness, which was repellent in one who was so very far from being a child. Hovering before Gilgamesh, hinting and maneuvering and finally simply begging for the trinkets he craved.",
