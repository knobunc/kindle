            "It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the city, soon ending in a settled and heavy rain. This change of weather had an odd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at once put into new commotion, and overshadowed by a world of umbrellas. The waver, the jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold degree. For my own part I did not much regard the rain\x{2014}the lurking of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too dangerously pleasant. Tying a handkerchief about my mouth, I kept on. For half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare; and I here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him. Never once turning his head to look back, he did not observe me. By and bye he passed into a cross street, which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted. Here a change in his demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less object than before\x{2014}more hesitatingly. He crossed and re-crossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim; and the press was still so thick that, at every such movement, I was obliged to follow him closely. The street was a narrow and long one, and his course lay within it for nearly an hour, during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at <<noon|13>> in Broadway near the Park\x{2014}so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that of the most frequented American city. A second turn brought us into a square, brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life. The old manner of the stranger re-appeared. His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon those who hemmed him in. He urged his way steadily and perseveringly. I was surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit of the square, that he turned and retraced his steps. Still more was I astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times\x{2014}once nearly detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement.",

It no longer wore, however, the same aspect. It was still brilliant with gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and there were few persons to be seen. The stranger grew pale. He walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh, turned in the direction of the river, and, plunging through a great variety of devious ways, came out, at length, in view of one of the principal theatres. It was about being closed, and the audience were thronging from the doors. I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his countenance had, in some measure, abated. His head again fell upon his breast; he appeared as I had seen him at first. I observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience\x{2014}but, upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions.",

For some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this number one by one dropped off, until <<three|9:1>> only remained together, in a narrow and gloomy lane little frequented. The stranger paused, and, for a moment, seemed lost in thought; then, with every mark of agitation, pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city, amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed. It was the most noisome quarter of London, where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty, and of the most desperate crime. By the dim light of an accidental lamp, tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen tottering to their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce the semblance of a passage was discernible between them. The paving-stones lay at random, displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass. Horrible filth festered in the dammed-up gutters. The whole atmosphere teemed with desolation. Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro. The spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near its death hour. Once more he strode onward with elastic tread. Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our sight, and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of Intemperance\x{2014}one of the palaces of the fiend, Gin.",

            "IN these rapid, restless shadows,
Once I walked at eventide,
When a gentle, silent maiden,
Wal ked in beauty at my side
She alone there walked beside me
All in beauty, like a bride.
Pallidly the moon was shining
On the dewy meadows nigh;
On the silvery, silent rivers,
On the mountains far and high
On the ocean\x{2019}s star-lit waters,
Where the winds a-weary die.
Slowly, silently we wandered
From the open cottage door,
Underneath the elm\x{2019}s long branches
To the pavement bending o\x{2019}er;
Underneath the mossy willow
And the dying sycamore.
With the myriad stars in beauty
All bedight, the heavens were seen,
Radiant hopes were bright around me,
Like the light of stars serene;
Like the mellow <<midnight|13>> splendor
Of the Night\x{2019}s irradiate queen.
Audibly the elm-leaves whispered
Peaceful, pleasant melodies,
Like the distant murmured music
Of unquiet, lovely seas:
While the winds were hushed in slumber
In the fragrant flowers and trees.
Wondrous and unwonted beauty
Still adorning all did seem,
While I told my love in fables
\x{2018}Neath the willows by the stream;
Would the heart have kept unspoken
Love that was its rarest dream!
Instantly away we wandered
In the shadowy twilight tide,
She, the silent, scornful maiden,
Walking calmly at my side,
With a step serene and stately,
All in beauty, all in pride.
Vacantly I walked beside her.
On the earth mine eyes were cast;
Swift and keen there came unto me
Ritter memories of the past
On me, like the rain in Autumn
On the dead leaves, cold and fast.
Underneath the elms we parted,
By the lowly cottage door;
One brief word alone was uttered
Never on our lips before;
And away I walked forlornly,
Broken-hearted evermore.
Slowly, silently I loitered,
Homeward, in the night, alone;
Sudden anguish bound my spirit,
That my youth had never known;
Wild unrest, like that which cometh
When the Night\x{2019}s first dream hath flown.
Now, to me the elm-leaves whisper
Mad, discordant melodies,
And keen melodies like shadows
Haunt the moaning willow trees,
And the sycamores with laughter
Mock me in the nightly breeze.
Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight
Through the sighing foliage streams;
And each morning, <<midnight|13>> shadow,
Shadow of my sorrow seems;
Strive, 0 heart, forget thine idol!
And, 0 soul, forget thy dreams!",

            "Once upon a <<midnight|13>> dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
\x{201c}\x{2018}Tis some visiter,\x{201d} I muttered, \x{201c}tapping at my chamber door\x{2014}
Only this, and nothing more.\x{201d}
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;\x{2014}vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow\x{2014}sorrow for the lost Lenore\x{2014}
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore\x{2014}
Nameless here for evermore.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me\x{2014}filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
\x{201c}\x{2018}Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door\x{2014}
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;\x{2014}
This it is, and nothing more.\x{201d}
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
\x{201c}Sir,\x{201d} said I, \x{201c}or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you \x{201c}\x{2014}here I opened wide the door;\x{2014}\x{2014}
Darkness there and nothing more.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, \x{201c}Lenore!\x{201d}
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, \x{201c}Lenore!\x{201d}\x{2014}
Merely this, and nothing more.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.
\x{201c}Surely,\x{201d} said I, \x{201c}surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore\x{2014}
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;\x{2014}
\x{2018}Tis the wind and nothing more!\x{201d}
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door\x{2014}
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door\x{2014}
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
\x{201c}Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,\x{201d} I said, \x{201c}art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore\x{2014}
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night\x{2019}s Plutonian shore!\x{201d}
Quoth the raven \x{201c}Nevermore.\x{201d}
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning\x{2014}little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door\x{2014}
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as \x{201c}Nevermore.\x{201d}
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing farther then he uttered\x{2014}not a feather then he fluttered\x{2014}
Till I scarcely more than muttered \x{201c}Other friends have flown before\x{2014}
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.\x{201d}
Then the bird said \x{201c}Nevermore.\x{201d}
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
\x{201c}Doubtless,\x{201d} said I, \x{201c}what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore\x{2014}
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
Of \x{201c}Never\x{2014}nevermore.\x{201d}
But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore\x{2014}
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking \x{201c}Nevermore.\x{201d}
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom\x{2019}s core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion\x{2019}s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o\x{2019}er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o\x{2019}er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore!
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
\x{201c}Wretch,\x{201d} I cried, \x{201c}thy God hath lent thee\x{2014}by these angels he hath sent
thee

Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted\x{2014}
On this home by Horror haunted\x{2014}tell me truly, I implore\x{2014}

By that Heaven that bends above us\x{2014}by that God we both adore\x{2014}
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore\x{2014}
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.\x{201d}
Quoth the raven, \x{201c}Nevermore.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!\x{201d} I shrieked, upstarting\x{2014}

Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!\x{2014}quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!\x{201d}
Quoth the raven, \x{201c}Nevermore.\x{201d}
And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon\x{2019}s that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o\x{2019}er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;

            "I saw thee once\x{2014}once only\x{2014}years ago:
I must not say how many\x{2014}but not many.
It was a July <<midnight|13>>; and from out
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe\x{2014}
Fell on the upturn\x{2019}d faces of these roses
That gave out, in return for the love-light,
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death\x{2014}
Fell on the upturn\x{2019}d faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.
Clad all in white, upon a violet bank
I saw thee half reclining; while the moon
Fell on the upturn\x{2019}d faces of the roses,
And on thine own, upturn\x{2019}d\x{2014}alas, in sorrow!
Was it not Fate, that, on this July <<midnight|13>>-
Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)
That bade me pause before that garden-gate,
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
No footstep stirred: the hated world an slept,
Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!\x{2014}oh, God!
How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)
Save only thee and me. I paused\x{2014}I looked-
And in an instant all things disappeared.
(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)
The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
The mossy banks and the meandering paths,
The happy flowers and the repining trees,
Were seen no more: the very roses\x{2019} odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
All\x{2014}all expired save thee\x{2014}save less than thou:
Save only the divine light in thine eyes-
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
I saw but them\x{2014}they were the world to me!
I saw but them\x{2014}saw only them for hours,
Saw only them until the moon went down.
What wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!
How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!
How silently serene a sea of pride!
How daring an ambition; yet how deep-
How fathomless a capacity for love!
But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,
Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained;
They would not go\x{2014}they never yet have gone;
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
They have not left me (as my hopes have) since;
They follow me\x{2014}they lead me through the years.
They are my ministers\x{2014}yet I their slave.
Their office is to illumine and enkindle\x{2014}
My duty, to be saved by their bright light,
And purified in their electric fire,
And sanctified in their elysian fire.
They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),
And are far up in Heaven\x{2014}the stars I kneel to
In the sad, silent watches of my night;
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still\x{2014}two sweetly scintillant
Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!",

I stand beneath the mystic moon.
An opiate vapour, dewy, dim,
Exhales from out her golden rim,
And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
Upon the quiet mountain top.
Steals drowsily and musically
Into the univeral valley.
The rosemary nods upon the grave;
The lily lolls upon the wave;
Wrapping the fog about its breast,
The ruin moulders into rest;
Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
A conscious slumber seems to take,
And would not, for the world, awake.
All Beauty sleeps!\x{2014}and lo! where lies
(Her easement open to the skies)
Irene, with her Destinies!
Oh, lady bright! can it be right\x{2014}
This window open to the night?
The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
Laughingly through the lattice drop\x{2014}
The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
Flit through thy chamber in and out,
And wave the curtain canopy
So fitfully\x{2014}so fearfully\x{2014}
Above the closed and fringed lid
\x{2018}Neath which thy slumb\x{2019}ring sould lies hid,
That o\x{2019}er the floor and down the wall,
Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
Oh, lady dear, hast thous no fear?
Why and what art thou dreaming here?
Sure thou art come p\x{2019}er far-off seas,
A wonder to these garden trees!
Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress!
Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
And this all solemn silentness!
The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
Which is enduring, so be deep!
Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
This chamber changed for one more holy,
This bed for one more melancholy,
I pray to God that she may lie
Forever with unopened eye,
While the dim sheeted ghosts go by!
My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
As it is lasting, so be deep!
Soft may the worms about her creep!
Far in the forest, dim and old,
For her may some tall vault unfold\x{2014}
Some vault that oft hath flung its black
And winged pannels fluttering back,
Triumphant, o\x{2019}er the crested palls,
Of her grand family funerals\x{2014}
Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
Against whose portal she hath thrown,
In childhood, many an idle stone\x{2014}
Some tomb fromout whose sounding door
She ne\x{2019}er shall force an echo more,
Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!

O! NOTHING earthly save the ray
(Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty\x{2019}s eye,
As in those gardens where the day
Springs from the gems of Circassy\x{2014}
O! nothing earthly save the thrill
Of melody in woodland rill\x{2014}
Or (music of the passion-hearted)
Joy\x{2019}s voice so peacefully departed
That like the murmur in the shell,
Its echo dwelleth and will dwell\x{2014}
Oh, nothing of the dross of ours\x{2014}
Yet all the beauty\x{2014}all the flowers
That list our Love, and deck our bowers\x{2014}
Adorn yon world afar, afar\x{2014}
The wandering star.
\x{2018}Twas a sweet time for Nesace\x{2014}for there
Her world lay lolling on the golden air,
<<Near four|9:1>> bright suns\x{2014}a temporary rest\x{2014}
An oasis in desert of the blest.
* A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which appeared
suddenly in the heavens\x{2014}attained, in a few days, a
brilliancy surpassing that of Jupiter\x{2014}then as suddenly
disappeared, and has never been seen since.
Away\x{2014}away\x{2014}\x{2018}mid seas of rays that roll
Empyrean splendor o\x{2019}er th\x{2019} unchained soul\x{2014}
The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
Can struggle to its destin\x{2019}d eminence\x{2014}
To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode,
And late to ours, the favour\x{2019}d one of God\x{2014}
But, now, the ruler of an anchor\x{2019}d realm,
She throws aside the sceptre\x{2014}leaves the helm,
And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.
Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,
Whence sprang the \x{201c}Idea of Beauty\x{201d} into birth,
(Falling in wreaths thro\x{2019} many a startled star,
Like woman\x{2019}s hair \x{2018}mid pearls, until, afar,
It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt)
She look\x{2019}d into Infinity\x{2014}and knelt.
Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled\x{2014}
Fit emblems of the model of her world\x{2014}
Seen but in beauty\x{2014}not impeding sight
Of other beauty glittering thro\x{2019} the light\x{2014}
A wreath that twined each starry form around,
And all the opal\x{2019}d air in color bound.
All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
Of flowers: of lilies such as rear\x{2019}d the head
*On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang
So eagerly around about to hang
Upon the flying footsteps of\x{2014}deep pride\x{2014}
**Of her who lov\x{2019}d a mortal\x{2014}and so died.
The Sephalica, budding with young bees,
Uprear\x{2019}d its purple stem around her knees:
* On Santa Maura\x{2014}olim Deucadia.
**And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam\x{2019}d\x{2014}
Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham\x{2019}d
All other loveliness: its honied dew
(The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
Deliriously sweet, was dropp\x{2019}d from Heaven,
And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
In Trebizond\x{2014}and on a sunny flower
So like its own above that, to this hour,
It still remaineth, torturing the bee
With madness, and unwonted reverie:
In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
And blossom of the fairy plant, in grief
Disconsolate linger\x{2014}grief that hangs her head,
Repenting follies that full long have fled,
Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
Like guilty beauty, chasten\x{2019}d, and more fair:
Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:
**And Clytia pondering between many a sun,
While pettish tears adown her petals run:
***And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth\x{2014}
And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:
* This flower is much noticed by Lewenhoeck and Tournefort.
The bee, feeding upon its blossom, becomes intoxicated.
** Clytia\x{2014}The Chrysanthemum Peruvianum, or, to employ a
better-known term, the turnsol\x{2014}which continually turns
towards the sun, covers itself, like Peru, the country from
which it comes, with dewy clouds which cool and refresh its
flowers during the most violent heat of the day.\x{2014}B. de St.
Pierre.
*** There is cultivated in the king\x{2019}s garden at Paris, a
species of serpentine aloes without prickles, whose large
and beautiful flower exhales a strong odour of the vanilla,
during the time of its expansion, which is very short. It
does not blow till towards the month of July\x{2014}you then
perceive it gradually open its petals\x{2014}expand them\x{2014}fade
and die.\x{2014}St. Pierre.
*And Valisnerian lotus thither flown
From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:
**And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante!
Isola d\x{2019}oro!\x{2014}Fior di Levante!
***And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever
With Indian Cupid down the holy river\x{2014}
Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given
****To bear the Goddess\x{2019} song, in odors, up to Heaven:
\x{201c}Spirit! that dwellest where,
In the deep sky,
The terrible and fair,
In beauty vie!
Beyond the line of blue\x{2014}
The boundary of the star
Which turneth at the view
Of thy barrier and thy bar\x{2014}
Of the barrier overgone
By the comets who were cast
From their pride, and from their throne
To be drudges till the last\x{2014}
To be carriers of fire
(The red fire of their heart)
With speed that may not tire
And with pain that shall not part\x{2014}
* There is found, in the Rhone, a beautiful lily of the
Valisnerian kind. Its stem will stretch to the length of
three or four feet\x{2014}thus preserving its head above water
in the swellings of the river.
** The Hyacinth.
*** It is a fiction of the Indians, that Cupid was first
seen floating in one of these down the river Ganges\x{2014}and
that he still loves the cradle of his childhood.
**** And golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the saints.

The drift of Milton\x{2019}s argument, leads him to employ language
which would appear, at first sight, to verge upon their
doctrine; but it will be seen immediately, that he guards
himself against the charge of having adopted one of the most
ignorant errors of the dark ages of the church.\x{2014}Dr.
Sumner\x{2019}s Notes on Milton\x{2019}s Christian Doctrine.
This opinion, in spite of many testimonies to the contrary,
could never have been very general. Andeus, a Syrian of
Mesopotamia, was condemned for the opinion, as heretical. He
lived in the beginning of the fourth century. His disciples
were called Anthropmorphites.\x{2014}Vide Du Pin.
Among Milton\x{2019}s poems are these lines:\x{2014}
Dicite sacrorum pr\x{e6}sides nemorum De\x{e6}, &c.
Quis ille primus cujus ex imagine
Natura solers finxit humanum genus?
Eternus, incorruptus, \x{e6}qu\x{e6}vus polo,
Unusque et universus exemplar Dei.\x{2014}And afterwards,
Non cui profundum C\x{e6}citas lumen dedit
Dirc\x{e6}us augur vidit hunc alto sinu, &c.

Abash\x{2019}d, amid the lilies there, to seek
A shelter from the fervour of His eye;
For the stars trembled at the Deity.
She stirr\x{2019}d not\x{2014}breath\x{2019}d not\x{2014}for a voice was there
How solemnly pervading the calm air!
A sound of silence on the startled ear
Which dreamy poets name \x{201c}the music of the sphere.\x{201d}
Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call
\x{201c}Silence\x{201d}\x{2014}which is the merest word of all.
All Nature speaks, and ev\x{2019}n ideal things
Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings\x{2014}
But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high
The eternal voice of God is passing by,
And the red winds are withering in the sky!

And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
*Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
Thro\x{2019} the ebon air, besilvering the pall
Of their own dissolution, while they die\x{2014}
Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,
Sat gently on these columns as a crown\x{2014}
A window of one circular diamond, there,
Look\x{2019}d out above into the purple air,
* Some star which, from the ruin\x{2019}d roof Of shak\x{2019}d Olympus,
by mischance, did fall.\x{2014}Milton.
And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
And hallow\x{2019}d all the beauty twice again,
Save when, between th\x{2019} Empyrean and that ring,
Some eager spirit flapp\x{2019}d his dusky wing.
But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
The dimness of this world: that greyish green
That Nature loves the best for Beauty\x{2019}s grave
Lurk\x{2019}d in each cornice, round each architrave\x{2014}
And every sculptur\x{2019}d cherub thereabout
That from his marble dwelling peer\x{e9}d out
Seem\x{2019}d earthly in the shadow of his niche\x{2014}
Achaian statues in a world so rich?
*Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis\x{2014}
From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
**Of beautiful Gomorrah! O, the wave
Is now upon thee\x{2014}but too late to save!
Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
Witness the murmur of the grey twilight
* Voltaire, in speaking of Persepolis, says, \x{201c}Je connois
bien l\x{2019}admiration qu\x{2019}inspirent ces ruines\x{2014}mais un palais

Voltaire.]
** \x{201c}Oh! the wave\x{201d}\x{2014}Ula Degusi is the Turkish appellation;
but, on its own shores, it is called Bahar Loth, or
Almotanah. There were undoubtedly more than two cities
engluphed in the \x{201c}dead sea.\x{201d} In the valley of Siddim were
five\x{2014}Adrah, Zeboin, Zoar, Sodom and Gomorrah. Stephen of
Byzantium mentions eight, and Strabo thirteeen, (engulphed)
\x{2014}but the last is out of all reason.
It is said, (Tacitus, Strabo, Josephus, Daniel of St. Saba, Nau,
Maundrell, Troilo, D\x{2019}Arvieux) that after an excessive drought, the
vestiges of columns, walls, &c. are seen above the surface. At anyseason, such remains may be discovered by looking down into the
transparent lake, and at such distances as would argue the existence of
many settlements in the space now usurped by the \x{2018}Asphaltites.\x{2019}
*That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco,
Of many a wild star-gazer long ago\x{2014}
That stealeth ever on the ear of him
Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim.
And sees the darkness coming as a cloud\x{2014}
***Is not its form\x{2014}its voice\x{2014}most palpable and loud?
But what is this?\x{2014}it cometh\x{2014}and it brings
A music with it\x{2014}\x{2018}tis the rush of wings\x{2014}
A pause\x{2014}and then a sweeping, falling strain
And Nesace is in her halls again.
From the wild energy of wanton haste
Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
And zone that clung around her gentle waist
Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
Within the centre of that hall to breathe
She paus\x{2019}d and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,
The fairy light that kiss\x{2019}d her golden hair
And long\x{2019}d to rest, yet could but sparkle there!
***Young flowers were whispering in melody
To happy flowers that night\x{2014}and tree to tree;
Fountains were gushing music as they fell
In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;
Yet silence came upon material things\x{2014}
Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings\x{2014}
And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:
* Eyraco\x{2014}Chaldea.
** I have often thought I could distinctly hear the sound of
the darkness as it stole over the horizon.
*** Fairies use flowers for their charactery.\x{2014}Merry Wives
of Windsor. [William Shakespeare]
\x{201c}\x{2018}Neath blue-bell or streamer\x{2014}
Or tufted wild spray
That keeps, from the dreamer,
*The moonbeam away\x{2014}
Bright beings! that ponder,
With half closing eyes,
On the stars which your wonder
Hath drawn from the skies,
Till they glance thro\x{2019} the shade, and
Come down to your brow
Like\x{2014}eyes of the maiden
Who calls on you now\x{2014}
Arise! from your dreaming
In violet bowers,
To duty beseeming
These star-litten hours\x{2014}
And shake from your tresses
Encumber\x{2019}d with dew
The breath of those kisses
That cumber them too\x{2014}
(O! how, without you, Love!
Could angels be blest?)
Those kisses of true love
That lull\x{2019}d ye to rest!
Up!\x{2014}shake from your wing
Each hindering thing:
The dew of the night\x{2014}
It would weigh down your flight;
And true love caresses\x{2014}
O! leave them apart!
* In Scripture is this passage\x{2014}\x{201c}The sun shall not harm
thee by day, nor the moon by night.\x{201d} It is perhaps not
generally known that the moon, in Egypt, has the effect of
producing blindness to those who sleep with the face exposed
to its rays, to which circumstance the passage evidently
alludes.
They are light on the tresses,
But lead on the heart.
Ligeia! Ligeia!
My beautiful one!
Whose harshest idea
Will to melody run,
O! is it thy will
On the breezes to toss?
Or, capriciously still,
*Like the lone Albatross,
Incumbent on night
(As she on the air)
To keep watch with delight
On the harmony there?
Ligeia! whatever
Thy image may be,
No magic shall sever
Thy music from thee.
Thou hast bound many eyes
In a dreamy sleep\x{2014}
But the strains still arise
Which thy vigilance keep\x{2014}
The sound of the rain
Which leaps down to the flower,
And dances again
In the rhythm of the shower\x{2014}
**The murmur that springs
From the growing of grass
* The Albatross is said to sleep on the wing.
** I met with this idea in an old English tale, which I am
now unable to obtain and quote from memory:\x{2014}\x{201c}The verie
essence and, as it were, springe-heade, and origine of all
musiche is the verie pleasaunte sounde which the trees of
the forest do make when they growe.\x{201d}
Are the music of things\x{2014}
But are modell\x{2019}d, alas!\x{2014}
Away, then my dearest,
O! hie thee away
To springs that lie clearest
Beneath the moon-ray\x{2014}
To lone lake that smiles,
In its dream of deep rest,
At the many star-isles
That enjewel its breast\x{2014}
Where wild flowers, creeping,
Have mingled their shade,
On its margin is sleeping
Full many a maid\x{2014}
Some have left the cool glade, and
* Have slept with the bee\x{2014}
Arouse them my maiden,
On moorland and lea\x{2014}
Go! breathe on their slumber,
All softly in ear,
The musical number
They slumber\x{2019}d to hear\x{2014}
For what can awaken
An angel so soon
* The wild bee will not sleep in the shade if there be
moonlight. The rhyme in this verse, as in one about sixty
lines before, has an appearance of affectation. It is,
however, imitated from Sir W. Scott, or rather from Claud
Halcro\x{2014}in whose mouth I admired its effect:
O! were there an island,
Tho\x{2019} ever so wild
Where woman might smile, and
No man be beguil\x{2019}d, &c.
Whose sleep hath been taken
Beneath the cold moon,
As the spell which no slumber
Of witchery may test,
The rythmical number
Which lull\x{2019}d him to rest?\x{201d}
Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
A thousand seraphs burst th\x{2019} Empyrean thro\x{2019},
Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight\x{2014}
Seraphs in all but \x{201c}Knowledge,\x{201d} the keen light
That fell, refracted, thro\x{2019} thy bounds, afar
O Death! from eye of God upon that star:
Sweet was that error\x{2014}sweeter still that death\x{2014}
Sweet was that error\x{2014}ev\x{2019}n with us the breath
Of science dims the mirror of our joy\x{2014}
To them \x{2018}twere the Simoom, and would destroy\x{2014}
For what (to them) availeth it to know
That Truth is Falsehood\x{2014}or that Bliss is Woe?
Sweet was their death\x{2014}with them to die was rife
With the last ecstacy of satiate life\x{2014}
Beyond that death no immortality\x{2014}
But sleep that pondereth and is not \x{201c}to be\x{201d}\x{2014}
And there\x{2014}oh! may my weary spirit dwell\x{2014}
*Apart from Heaven\x{2019}s Eternity\x{2014}and yet how far from Hell!
* With the Arabians there is a medium between Heaven and
Hell, where men suffer no punishment, but yet do not attain
that tranquil and even happiness which they suppose to be
characteristic of heavenly enjoyment.

Sorrow is not excluded from \x{201c}Al Aaraaf,\x{201d} but it is that
sorrow which the living love to cherish for the dead, and
which, in some minds, resembles the delirium of opium. The
passionate excitement of Love and the buoyancy of spirit
attendant upon intoxication are its less holy pleasures\x{2014}
the price of which, to those souls who make choice of \x{201c}Al
Aaraaf\x{201d} as their residence after life, is final death and
annihilation.
What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim,
Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts
To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover\x{2014}
O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?
*Unguided Love hath fallen\x{2014}\x{2018}mid \x{201c}tears of perfect moan.\x{201d}
He was a goodly spirit\x{2014}he who fell:
A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well\x{2014}
A gazer on the lights that shine above\x{2014}
A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
What wonder? For each star is eye-like there,
And looks so sweetly down on Beauty\x{2019}s hair\x{2014}
And they, and ev\x{2019}ry mossy spring were holy
To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
The night had found (to him a night of wo)
Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo\x{2014}
Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
Here sate he with his love\x{2014}his dark eye bent
With eagle gaze along the firmament:
Now turn\x{2019}d it upon her\x{2014}but ever then
It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.
\x{201c}Iante, dearest, see! how dim that ray!
How lovely \x{2018}tis to look so far away!
* There be tears of perfect moan
Wept for thee in Helicon.\x{2014}Milton.
She seem\x{2019}d not thus upon that autumn eve
I left her gorgeous halls\x{2014}nor mourn\x{2019}d to leave.
That eve\x{2014}that eve\x{2014}I should remember well\x{2014}
The sun-ray dropp\x{2019}d, in Lemnos, with a spell
On th\x{2019}Arabesque carving of a gilded hall
Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall\x{2014}
And on my eye-lids\x{2014}O the heavy light!
How drowsily it weigh\x{2019}d them into night!
On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
But O that light!\x{2014}I slumber\x{2019}d\x{2014}Death, the while,
Stole o\x{2019}er my senses in that lovely isle
So softly that no single silken hair
Awoke that slept\x{2014}or knew that it was there.
The last spot of Earth\x{2019}s orb I trod upon
*Was a proud temple call\x{2019}d the Parthenon\x{2014}
More beauty clung around her column\x{2019}d wall
**Than ev\x{2019}n thy glowing bosom beats withal,
And when old Time my wing did disenthral
Thence sprang I\x{2014}as the eagle from his tower,
And years I left behind me in an hour.
What time upon her airy bounds I hung
One half the garden of her globe was flung
Unrolling as a chart unto my view\x{2014}
Tenantless cities of the desert too!
Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
And half I wish\x{2019}d to be again of men.\x{201d}
\x{201c}My Angelo! and why of them to be?
A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee\x{2014}
* It was entire in 1687\x{2014}the most elevated spot in Athens.
** Shadowing more beauty in their airy brows
Than have the white breasts of the Queen of Love.\x{2014}Marlowe.
And greener fields than in yon world above,
And women\x{2019}s loveliness\x{2014}and passionate love.\x{201d}
\x{201c}But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft
*Fail\x{2019}d, as my pennon\x{2019}d spirit leapt aloft,
Perhaps my brain grew dizzy\x{2014}but the world
I left so late was into chaos hurl\x{2019}d\x{2014}
Sprang from her station, on the winds apart,
And roll\x{2019}d, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.
Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar
And fell\x{2014}not swiftly as I rose before,
But with a downward, tremulous motion thro\x{2019}
Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!
Nor long the measure of my falling hours,
For nearest of all stars was thine to ours\x{2014}
Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,
A red D\x{e6}dalion on the timid Earth.
\x{201c}We came\x{2014}and to thy Earth\x{2014}but not to us
Be given our lady\x{2019}s bidding to discuss:
We came, my love; around, above, below,
Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
She grants to us, as granted by her God\x{2014}
But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl\x{2019}d
Never his fairy wing o\x{2019}er fairier world!
Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
Alone could see the phantom in the skies,
When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
Headlong thitherward o\x{2019}er the starry sea\x{2014}
But when its glory swell\x{2019}d upon the sky,
As glowing Beauty\x{2019}s bust beneath man\x{2019}s eye,
* Pennon\x{2014}for pinion.\x{2014}Milton.
We paus\x{2019}d before the heritage of men,
And thy star trembled\x{2014}as doth Beauty then!\x{201d}
Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away
The night that waned and waned and brought no day.
They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts
Who hear not for the beating of their hearts.",

            "KIND solace in a dying hour!
Such, father, is not (now) my theme\x{2014}
I will not madly deem that power
Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
Unearthly pride hath revell\x{2019}d in\x{2014}
I have no time to dote or dream:
You call it hope\x{2014}that fire of fire!
It is but agony of desire:
If I can hope\x{2014}Oh God! I can\x{2014}
Its fount is holier\x{2014}more divine\x{2014}
I would not call thee fool, old man,
But such is not a gift of thine.
Know thou the secret of a spirit
Bow\x{2019}d from its wild pride into shame.
O! yearning heart! I did inherit
Thy withering portion with the fame,
The searing glory which hath shone
Amid the jewels of my throne,
Halo of Hell! and with a pain
Not Hell shall make me fear again\x{2014}
O! craving heart, for the lost flowers
And sunshine of my summer hours!
Th\x{2019} undying voice of that dead time,
With its interminable chime,
Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
Upon thy emptiness\x{2014}a knell.
I have not always been as now:
The fever\x{2019}d diadem on my brow
I claim\x{2019}d and won usurpingly\x{2014}
Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
Rome to the Caesar\x{2014}this to me?
The heritage of a kingly mind,
And a proud spirit which hath striven
Triumphantly with human kind.
On mountain soil I first drew life:
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews upon my head,
And, I believe, the winged strife
And tumult of the headlong air
Have nestled in my very hair.
So late from Heaven\x{2014}that dew\x{2014}it fell
(Mid dreams of an unholy night)
Upon me\x{2014}with the touch of Hell,
While the red flashing of the light
From clouds that hung, like banners, o\x{2019}er,
Appeared to my half-closing eye
The pageantry of monarchy,
And the deep trumpet-thunder\x{2019}s roar
Came hurriedly upon me, telling
Of human battle, where my voice,
My own voice, silly child!\x{2014}was swelling
(O! how my spirit would rejoice,
And leap within me at the cry)
The battle-cry of Victory!
The rain came down upon my head
Unshelter\x{2019}d\x{2014}and the heavy wind
Was giantlike\x{2014}so thou, my mind!\x{2014}
It was but man, I thought, who shed
Laurels upon me: and the rush\x{2014}
The torrent of the chilly air
Gurgled within my ear the crush
Of empires\x{2014}with the captive\x{2019}s prayer\x{2014}
The hum of suiters\x{2014}and the tone
Of flattery \x{2018}round a sovereign\x{2019}s throne.
My passions, from that hapless hour,
Usurp\x{2019}d a tyranny which men
Have deem\x{2019}d, since I have reach\x{2019}d to power;
My innate nature\x{2014}be it so:
But, father, there liv\x{2019}d one who, then,
Then\x{2014}in my boyhood\x{2014}when their fire
Burn\x{2019}d with a still intenser glow,
(For passion must, with youth, expire)
E\x{2019}en then who knew this iron heart
In woman\x{2019}s weakness had a part.
I have no words\x{2014}alas!\x{2014}to tell
The loveliness of loving well!
Nor would I now attempt to trace
The more than beauty of a face
Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
Are\x{2014}shadows on th\x{2019} unstable wind:
Thus I remember having dwelt
Some page of early lore upon,
With loitering eye, till I have felt
The letters\x{2014}with their meaning\x{2014}melt
To fantasies\x{2014}with none.
O, she was worthy of all love!
Love\x{2014}as in infancy was mine\x{2014}
\x{2018}Twas such as angel minds above
Might envy; her young heart the shrine
On which my ev\x{2019}ry hope and thought
Were incense\x{2014}then a goodly gift,
For they were childish\x{2014}and upright\x{2014}
Pure\x{2014}as her young example taught:
Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
Trust to the fire within, for light?
We grew in age\x{2014}and love\x{2014}together,
Roaming the forest, and the wild;
My breast her shield in wintry weather\x{2014}
And, when the friendly sunshine smil\x{2019}d,
And she would mark the opening skies,
I saw no Heaven\x{2014}but in her eyes.
Young Love\x{2019}s first lesson is\x{2014}the heart:
For \x{2018}mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
When, from our little cares apart,
And laughing at her girlish wiles,
I\x{2019}d throw me on her throbbing breast,
And pour my spirit out in tears\x{2014}
There was no need to speak the rest\x{2014}
No need to quiet any fears
Of her\x{2014}who ask\x{2019}d no reason why,
But turn\x{2019}d on me her quiet eye!
Yet more than worthy of the love
My spirit struggled with, and strove,
When, on the mountain peak, alone,
Ambition lent it a new tone\x{2014}
I had no being\x{2014}but in thee:
The world, and all it did contain
In the earth\x{2014}the air\x{2014}the sea\x{2014}
Its joy\x{2014}its little lot of pain
That was new pleasure\x{2014}the ideal,
Dim, vanities of dreams by night\x{2014}
And dimmer nothings which were real\x{2014}
(Shadows\x{2014}and a more shadowy light!)
Parted upon their misty wings,
And, so, confusedly, became
Thine image, and\x{2014}a name\x{2014}a name!
Two separate\x{2014}yet most intimate things.
I was ambitious\x{2014}have you known
The passion, father? You have not:
A cottager, I mark\x{2019}d a throne
Of half the world as all my own,
And murmur\x{2019}d at such lowly lot\x{2014}
But, just like any other dream,
Upon the vapour of the dew
My own had past, did not the beam
Of beauty which did while it thro\x{2019}
The minute\x{2014}the hour\x{2014}the day\x{2014}oppress
My mind with double loveliness.
We walk\x{2019}d together on the crown
Of a high mountain which look\x{2019}d down
Afar from its proud natural towers
Of rock and forest, on the hills\x{2014}
The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers
And shouting with a thousand rills.
I spoke to her of power and pride,
But mystically\x{2014}in such guise
That she might deem it nought beside
The moment\x{2019}s converse; in her eyes
I read, perhaps too carelessly\x{2014}
A mingled feeling with my own\x{2014}
The flush on her bright cheek, to me
Seem\x{2019}d to become a queenly throne
Too well that I should let it be
Light in the wilderness alone.
I wrapp\x{2019}d myself in grandeur then,
And donn\x{2019}d a visionary crown\x{2014}
Yet it was not that Fantasy
Had thrown her mantle over me\x{2014}
But that, among the rabble\x{2014}men,
Lion ambition is chain\x{2019}d down\x{2014}
And crouches to a keeper\x{2019}s hand\x{2014}
Not so in deserts where the grand
The wild\x{2014}the terrible conspire
With their own breath to fan his fire.
Look \x{2018}round thee now on Samarcand!\x{2014}
Is not she queen of Earth? her pride
Above all cities? in her hand
Their destinies? in all beside
Of glory which the world hath known
Stands she not nobly and alone?
Falling\x{2014}her veriest stepping-stone
Shall form the pedestal of a throne\x{2014}
And who her sovereign? Timour\x{2014}he
Whom the astonished people saw
Striding o\x{2019}er empires haughtily
A diadem\x{2019}d outlaw\x{2014}
O! human love! thou spirit given,
On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!
Which fall\x{2019}st into the soul like rain
Upon the Siroc wither\x{2019}d plain,
And failing in thy power to bless
But leav\x{2019}st the heart a wilderness!
Idea! which bindest life around
With music of so strange a sound
And beauty of so wild a birth\x{2014}
Farewell! for I have won the Earth!
When Hope, the eagle that tower\x{2019}d, could see
No cliff beyond him in the sky,
His pinions were bent droopingly\x{2014}
And homeward turn\x{2019}d his soften\x{2019}d eye.
\x{2018}Twas sunset: when the sun will part
There comes a sullenness of heart
To him who still would look upon
The glory of the summer sun.
That soul will hate the ev\x{2019}ning mist,
So often lovely, and will list
To the sound of the coming darkness (known
To those whose spirits hearken) as one
Who, in a dream of night, would fly
But cannot from a danger nigh.
What tho\x{2019} the moon\x{2014}the white moon
Shed all the splendour of her <<noon|13>>,
Her smile is chilly\x{2014}and her beam,
In that time of dreariness, will seem
(So like you gather in your breath)
A portrait taken after death.
And boyhood is a summer sun
Whose waning is the dreariest one\x{2014}
For all we live to know is known,
And all we seek to keep hath flown\x{2014}
Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
With the <<noon-day|13>> beauty\x{2014}which is all.
I reach\x{2019}d my home\x{2014}my home no more\x{2014}
For all had flown who made it so\x{2014}
I pass\x{2019}d from out its mossy door,
And, tho\x{2019} my tread was soft and low,
A voice came from the threshold stone
Of one whom I had earlier known\x{2014}
O! I defy thee, Hell, to show
On beds of fire that burn below,
A humbler heart\x{2014}a deeper wo\x{2014}
Father, I firmly do believe\x{2014}
I know\x{2014}for Death, who comes for me
From regions of the blest afar,
Where there is nothing to deceive,
Hath left his iron gate ajar,
And rays of truth you cannot see
Are flashing thro\x{2019} Eternity\x{2014}
I do believe that Eblis hath
A snare in ev\x{2019}ry human path\x{2014}
Else how, when in the holy grove
I wandered of the idol, Love,
Who daily scents his snowy wings
With incense of burnt offerings
From the most unpolluted things,
Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
Above with trelliced rays from Heaven
No mote may shun\x{2014}no tiniest fly
The light\x{2019}ning of his eagle eye\x{2014}
How was it that Ambition crept,
Unseen, amid the revels there,
Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
In the tangles of Love\x{2019}s very hair?",

\x{201c}Whose heart-strings are a lute;\x{201d}
None sing so wildly well
As the angel Israfel,
And the giddy stars (so legends tell)
Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
Of his voice, all mute.
Tottering above
In her highest <<noon|13>>
The enamoured moon
Blushes with love,
While, to listen, the red levin
(With the rapid Pleiads, even,
Which were seven,)
Pauses in Heaven
And they say (the starry choir
And all the listening things)
That Israfeli\x{2019}s fire
Is owing to that lyre
By which he sits and sings\x{2014}
The trembling living wire
Of those unusual strings.
* And the angel Israfel, whose heart-strings are a lut, and
who has the sweetest voice of all God\x{2019}s creatures.\x{2014}KORAN.
But the skies that angel trod,
Where deep thoughts are a duty\x{2014}
Where Love\x{2019}s a grown up God\x{2014}
Where the Houri glances are
Imbued with all the beauty
Which we worship in a star.
Therefore, thou art not wrong,
Israfeli, who despisest
An unimpassion\x{2019}d song:
To thee the laurels belong
Best bard, because the wisest!
Merrily live, and long!
The extacies above
With thy burning measures suit\x{2014}
Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
With the fervor of thy lute\x{2014}
Well may the stars be mute!
Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
Is a world of sweets and sours;
Our flowers are merely\x{2014}flowers,
And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
Is the sunshine of ours.
If I could dwell
Where Israfel
Hath dwelt, and he where I,
He might not sing so wildly well
A mortal melody,
While a bolder note than this might swell
From my lyre within the sky.",

In a labyrinth of light\x{2014}

Is the passion of their sleep.
In the morning they arise,
And their moony covering
Is soaring in the skies,
With the tempests as they toss,

Or a yellow Albatross.
They use that moon no more
For the same end as before\x{2014}
Videlicet a tent\x{2014}
Which I think extravagant:
Its atomies, however,
Into a shower dissever,
Of which those butterflies,
Of Earth, who seek the skies,
And so come down again
(Never-contented things!)
Have brought a specimen
Upon their quivering wings.

Thou bearest in Heaven at night.,

Thy distant fire,
