An America just climbing out of a worldclass Depression was notably uninterested in fantastic legend, still the stuff of children\x{2019}s books. Next, three loosely linked short stories appeared, based on the Breton legend of the submerged city, Ys. Nothing more was heard from Evangeline Walton until <<1945|9c:0>>, when August Derleth started his \x{201c}Library of Arkham House Novels of Fantasy and Terror\x{201d} with her gothic mystery Witch House. Eleven years later, Beuregy published The Cross and the Sword, a re-creation of the violent world of the Norse sagas.",
