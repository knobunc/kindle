There was all sorts of pissing and moaning\x{2014}your pardon, sir\x{2014}about how no decent person would become an initiate now, and the ancient Mysteries would be debased and destroyed. But you know, I think the hierophant knew well enough she was safe. More than half of initiates these days are outsystem, and Radchaai are used to provincials becoming civilized and stepping inside the circle, as it were. I daresay if you look at the genealogies of most of the outsystem Radchaai on this station you\x{2019}d find quite a few of those.

And the\x{2026} the difficulties she\x{2019}s had, that have so recently and dramatically manifested themselves, they weren\x{2019}t caused by what you said.

She was born surrounded by wealth and privilege. She thinks she\x{2019}s learned to question that. But she hasn\x{2019}t learned quite as much as she thinks she has, and having that pointed out to her, well, she doesn\x{2019}t react well to it. You are under no obligation to be patient with this. I think your relationship has been good for her, and good for you, at least in some ways. But I don\x{2019}t think you have any obligation to continue it if it\x{2019}s going to be hurtful to you. And you certainly don\x{2019}t have to apologize for insisting your lover treat you with some basic consideration.\x{201d} As I had spoken, Ekalu\x{2019}s face hadn\x{2019}t changed. Now, as I finished, the muscles around her mouth twitched and tremored, just barely perceptibly.

Fired ten times more, changing my aim just a bit between each shot. It would take those bullets some two hours to reach that Sword.
