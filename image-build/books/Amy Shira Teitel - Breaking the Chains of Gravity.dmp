            "On May 17, 1930, dusk fell <<just before nine o\x{2019}clock|10>> at the end of a warm, clear Saturday in Britz, Berlin, but Max Valier showed no signs of leaving his workbench for an evening of leisure. He remained in his seat, focused on a simple combustion chamber bolted to the table in front of him. It was a simple setup. At the center was a combustion chamber, a simple steel tube with an upward-facing exhaust nozzle. On the other end were a series of small bore holes through which the fuel and oxidizer were introduced. The whole apparatus was set up on a grocery scale. His assistants Arthur Rudolph and Walter Riedel sat some distance away at two tanks, one of kerosene mixed with water and the other of liquid oxygen. The two men manually opened the valves as Valier dictated, sending the fuel and oxidizer into the combustion chamber where they mixed. Once the combustion chamber was adequately pressurized, Valier lit the mixture with a blowtorch. As the jet of flaming gases roared upward from the combustion chamber, directed by the nozzle, the resulting reaction was a downward force onto the scale. While the engine burned, Valier added weights to the other side of the scale until it was properly balanced, giving him a crude measure of the engine\x{2019}s efficiency.",

            "About <<an hour before midnight|10>> on June 1, 1957, Kittinger had passed his final medical exam and was wriggling into his partial pressure suit at the Winzen research plant in Minneapolis. The capsule was also going through its final checks: its liquid oxygen system filled; chemicals added to the air regeneration unit; and the electrical and communications systems given a final check. An hour and a half later, Kittinger was sealed inside the Manhigh capsule, which took on the moniker of Manhigh 1 for this first flight. He left his faceplate open, taking advantage of the capsule\x{2019}s pressurized environment as nitrogen was bled from the cabin and replaced by helium, a gas that would reduce the possibility of Kittinger succumbing to the bends in the event of a sudden decompression, a potentially lethal sickness caused by nitrogen bubbling out of the blood. Kittinger half sat and half crouched in the capsule for hours as technicians ran a second series of checks before loading him onto a truck and driving the twenty miles to the launch site at Fleming Field near South Saint Paul. Still in the predawn hours, Kittinger watched through the small porthole windows as technicians buzzed around the capsule making the final preparations, backlit by the lights illuminating his capsule. As the Sun began creeping up above the horizon, an early morning fog swirled around the launch platform imbuing the scene with an eerie, surreal feeling. The whole team was there, Simons and Stapp included. After working for years with a shoestring budget, the men and women who had devoted their time, and in the Winzens\x{2019} case, their own money, were finally seeing the results of their hard work.",

He wasn\x{2019}t alone in the sky; circling the area were photographic and tracking aircraft. But inside the capsule Kittinger was isolated. Exacerbating his solitude was a communications glitch with the very high-frequency radio. He could hear his ground crew but they couldn\x{2019}t hear him, forcing him to use the backup continuous wave transmission system. Tapping out messages in Morse code, an employee at the Winzen plant would receive the messages then call the ground crews in South Saint Paul to verbally relay the message. This roundabout method meant a delay in transferring critical information, but it wasn\x{2019}t a showstopper for Kittinger. He tapped out a simple message in Morse code: NO SWEAT.

The Soviet delegates in attendance were equally interested in the program and asked to borrow the film to show it in their home country. It would be excellent to have the movie on hand for private demonstrations about spaceflight, they said, though they likely wanted it as much as proof of the emerging American technology that, with the help of German engineers, was close to solving the basic problems associated with manned spaceflight. Not to be outdone by the Americans, the Soviet Union announced at the meeting in Copenhagen its intention to also launch a satellite as part of the IGY.

No, the Soviets couldn\x{2019}t use Sputnik as a launch platform to drop bombs on America. No, Eisenhower assured the nation, Sputnik did not raise his apprehensions about national security, not one iota. The American satellite program, he said, had moved forward since its formal approval in 1955 with additional funding going toward assuring a launch within the International Geophysical Year. It had never been the subject of a race with the Soviet Union.

As a defense of the Vanguard program, Eisenhower reiterated the decision to separate the American satellite effort from the military missile program as a way to solidify the former as a purely scientific endeavor in line with the International Geophysical Year\x{2019}s goals. Months earlier, in May, the president told his nation, the decision had been made to test the satellite launch system in 1957 with the view of launching a fully instrumented vehicle in March of 1958. He stood by this decision and this time line, saying that the satellite program had never been a race and rather had always been a part of American scientific activities.

As part of his counterattack, Hitler ordered that the rocket bombardment begin as soon as possible. Executing this order fell to Kammler, who deployed two firing units. Group North moved northwest from Cleves toward the Hague in Belgium to get a good shot at London, and Group South moved north from Baumholder to Koblenz to hit Paris. On September 6, Group South positioned an A-4 on its mobile firing table, and <<a little after ten-thirty in the morning|5>>, sparks began spewing from its engine. The sparks turned to flame and then a cloud of smoke as the rocket came to life and rose slowly off the launch platform. The rocket sputtered and fell back down with a thunk, luckily resting upright on the launch platform. A second A-4 launched a little over an hour later ended with the same failure. Premature cutoff of the fuel supply had grounded both rockets.',

As the Sun set <<just before seven-thirty|5k:1>> on that cool, crisp Thursday evening, a Hermes II rocket lifted off into twilight skies.

Five minutes after leaving the launchpad, the rocket crashed into a rocky knoll just three and a half miles south of downtown Ju\x{e1}rez, Mexico. Traveling at twelve miles per minute on impact, the force of the crash shook buildings in the small town and in nearby El Paso. The shock wave broke windows and stopped the clock in the sheriff\x{2019}s office at <<seven thirty-two|5b>>. Flames shot into the air, setting the hillside on fire and generating a thick smoke. Startled residents in both towns flooded their local newspaper offices with phone calls asking what had disturbed their quiet evening.

Personnel from White Sands arrived at the crash site <<around eight o\x{2019}clock|6>> and found the modified V-2 had left a crater fifty feet wide and twenty-four feet deep in the hillside.

            "Compressibility was a phenomenon known to scientists well before it became a problem for aviation and was inextricably linked to the speed of sound. In the seventeenth century, artillery tests had been done with an observer standing a known distance from a cannon, measuring the time delay between a flash of light and the sound of the cannonball escaping the barrel. These tests revealed that sound travels at about 1,140 feet per second. But this method was imprecise, and the figure was disputed until <<1943|18:0>> when twenty-seven American leaders in aerodynamics met at the NACA headquarters in Washington, D.C. Among the attendees were Dryden, Theodore von K\x{e1}rm\x{e1}n, and John Stack, an aerodynamicist from the NACA Langley Memorial Laboratory. It was Stack who raised the issue of the speed of sound as something that would soon become a problem for aircraft manufacturers building faster vehicles. Without taking into account all the variables, including the heating properties of air and density at different altitudes, Stack said, available data wasn\x{2019}t complete enough to determine the true speed of sound. Dryden offered a workaround, suggesting they mathematically round up the average measurements for a starting value. The committee ultimately agreed and settled on 1,117 feet per second as the speed of sound at sea level where the atmosphere is thickest.",

But without a fundamental understanding of the physical features of the air flow that was causing this unstable environment, engineers were stumped on how to solve the problem.

Airplanes have control surfaces, ailerons, rudders, and elevators that push against the air to move the vehicle. But at altitudes where the air is too thin for traditional flight controls to push against, a pilot would need some other means of control.
