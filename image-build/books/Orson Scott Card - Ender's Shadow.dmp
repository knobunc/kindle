Yesterday, when he talked to It\x{fa}, his mind had been on other things, with only the most cursory attention to what was going on inside Rabbit barracks. But now he realized that, unlike Dragon Army, the soldiers in Rabbit were all of the regular age. Not one was even close to Bean\x{2019}s height.

As to our first battle together, I can\x{2019}t predict that, but I can promise you this\x{2014}the teachers are not going to give me the traditional three months after my assignment to a new army. Same with all the other new commanders just appointed. They gave Ender Wiggin only a few weeks with Dragon before they went into battle\x{2014}and Dragon was a new army, constructed out of nothing. Rabbit is a good army with a solid record. The only new person here is me. I expect the battles to begin in a matter of days, a week at most, and I expect battles to come frequently. So for the first couple of practices, you\x{2019}ll really be training me in your existing system. I need to see how you work with your toon leaders, how the toons work with each other, how you respond to orders, what commands you use. I\x{2019}ll have a couple of things to say that are more about attitude than tactics, but by and large, I want to see you doing things as you\x{2019}ve always done them under Carn. It would help me, though, if you practiced with intensity, so I can see you at your sharpest. Are there any questions?\x{201d}",
