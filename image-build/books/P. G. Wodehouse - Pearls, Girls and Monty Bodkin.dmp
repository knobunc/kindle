            'As always when the weather was not unusual the Californian sun shone brightly down on the Superba-Llewellyn motion picture studio at Llewellyn City. Silence had gripped the great building except for the footsteps of some supervisor hurrying back to resume his supervising or the occasional howl from the writer\'s ghetto as some author with a headache sought in vain to make sense of the story which had been handed to him for treatment. It was <<two-thirty|5b>> of a summer afternoon, and this busy hive of industry generally tended to slacken off at that hour.',

It was with difficulty that he found speech.',

            'Grayce was not a woman who took her hair lightly and casually. When she employed hairdressers to work on it, she saw to it that they earned their money. The afternoon was well advanced before she was at liberty to leave the premises of Antoine, scalp specialist, whither she had gone after parting from Monty, to join her daughter Mavis for tea. For the last two days Mavis had been down in Sussex, inspecting Mellingham Hall, and they had arranged to meet at <<one|9g>> of those tea shoppes which are such a feature of the west end of London.',

At <<half past eleven|10>> on the night of his arrival at Mellingham Hall he had retired to his room and taken pen in hand.',

There he was interested to learn that a book on his chances of winning through to marriage had been started by his fellow member Oofy Prosser and that the current odds against were now a hundred to eight. Having invested a considerable sum at this figure, he returned to the Senior Conservative Club, and after a short wait Mr. Llewellyn appeared.',

In another minute, if I hadn't appeared, Brother Bodkin would have been imitating the cry of the brown owl or something as a tip-off to his associates that now was the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.
