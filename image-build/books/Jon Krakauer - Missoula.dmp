This survey was primarily concerned with documenting crime rates, however, and relied on a relatively narrow definition of sexual assault.

            "JORDAN JOHNSON WAS excused from the witness stand at <<11:15|2>> Wednesday morning, after testifying for 157 minutes, including his appearance on Monday. His father, Marty Johnson, was called to testify <<a little after 2:00|2>> on Wednesday afternoon. Under gentle questioning from defense counsel Kirsten Pabst, Marty said he was midway through his thirtieth year coaching football and teaching math to high school students in Eugene, Oregon. \x{201c}How close is your family?\x{201d} Pabst asked.",

As the courtroom emptied, Jordan Johnson\x{2019}s father leaned over the gallery railing and embraced his son.",

            "<<Just after 3:30|2>>, an announcement was made that a verdict had been reached, and the people milling around the courthouse hurried back to the courtroom. For a jury to arrive at a verdict in less than two and a half hours after such a long, complex trial was highly unusual, and it took almost everyone by surprise. Because few had anticipated that the jury would finish deliberating so quickly, and most of the spectators had left the courthouse to have lunch, when Judge Townsend called the court back to order, the audience in the gallery was only about a third as large as the audience for the closing arguments. Johnson sat down at the defense counsel\x{2019}s table, between David Paoli and Kirsten Pabst, betraying no emotion. Neither Cecilia Washburn nor any of her family were present to hear the jury\x{2019}s decision.",

            "Between 2008 and 2010, every time the Missoula police referred a case to the MCAO for prosecution, detectives included a form that prosecutors were supposed to fill out if they rejected the case, explaining their reasons for doing so. But prosecutors \x{201c}rarely documented their decision to decline prosecution in a meaningful way,\x{201d} according to the DOJ report. The most common explanation written on the referral forms was simply \x{201c}insufficient evidence\x{201d} or \x{201c}insufficient corroboration.\x{201d} In cases submitted <<after 2010|18:0>>, DOJ investigators discovered that prosecutors didn\x{2019}t bother returning the forms at all. This was extremely frustrating to the police detectives, because they were the ones who had to inform victims that their cases had been closed, but they weren\x{2019}t given any specific information they could offer to these victims about why the MCAO had declined to prosecute.",
