A woman usually comes in at <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>> to do for them. She went upstairs first into her own room (that\x{2019}s this room) then across the landing to her friend\x{2019}s room. Door was locked on the inside. She rattled the handle, knocked and called, but couldn\x{2019}t get any answer. In the end getting alarmed she rang up the police station. That was at <<ten forty-five|5b>>. We came along at once and forced the door open. Mrs.\x{a0}Allen was lying in a heap on the ground shot through the head. There was an automatic in her hand\x{2014}a Webley .25\x{2014}and it looked a clear case of suicide.\x{201d}",
