Eventually, <<after twenty-six|9:0>> rejections, I called my agent and said, \x{201c}Send it back. It\x{2019}s too different. Nobody\x{2019}s going to publish it.\x{201d} He sent it back, but a few days later a friend of my mother\x{2019}s insisted that I meet John Farrar, the publisher. He liked the manuscript, and eventually decided to publish it. My first editor was Hal Vursell.",
