of coarse voices within.  Our luck seemed to have deserted us:
the owner of the purple diamonds was dining at home and dining at

to get at the fellow. Only one sort of pretext would do\x{2014}it must

could go that made me such a bear at lunch.  But I saw my way
before we got up.  If I could only lay hold of a copy of the
picture I might ask leave to go and compare it with the original.
So down I went to Esher to find out if there was a copy in
existence, and was at Broom Hall for <<one hour and a half|14a:1>>
yesterday afternoon.  There was no copy there, but they must
exist, for Sir Bernard himself (there's 'copy' THERE!) has
allowed a couple to be made since the picture has been in his
possession. He hunted up the painters' addresses, and the rest of

perform, at once the most delicate and most difficult was that
which he accomplished between <<one|90>> and <<two o\'clock|6>> on the Tuesday
morning, aboard the North German steamer Uhlan, lying at anchor
in Genoa harbor.',

            "Not a hitch occurred.  Everything had been foreseen; everything
happened as I had been assured everything must.  Nobody was about
below, only the ship's boys on deck, and nobody on the bridge.
It was <<twenty-five minutes past one|10>> when Raffles, without a
stitch of clothing on his body, but with a glass phial, corked
with cotton-wool, between his teeth, and a tiny screw-driver
behind his ear, squirmed feet first through the ventilator over
his berth; and it was <<nineteen minutes to two|10>> when he returned,
head first, with the phial still between his teeth, and the
cotton-wool rammed home to still the rattling of that which lay
like a great gray bean within.  He had taken screws out and put
them in again; he had unfastened von Heumann's ventilator and had
left it fast as he had found it\x{2014}fast as he instantly proceeded
to make his own.  As for von Heumann, it had been enough to place
the drenched wad first on his mustache, and then to hold it
between his gaping lips; thereafter the intruder had climbed both
ways across his shins without eliciting a groan.",

            "On the whole I do not think that anything was discovered or
suspected before we weighed anchor; but I cannot be sure.  It is
difficult to believe that a man could be chloroformed in his
sleep and feel no tell-tale effects, sniff no suspicious odor, in
the morning.  Nevertheless, von Heumann reappeared as though
nothing had happened to him, his German cap over his eyes and his
mustaches brushing the peak.  And by <<ten o'clock|6>> we were quit of
Genoa; the last lean, blue-chinned official had left our decks;
the last fruitseller had been beaten off with bucketsful of water
and left cursing us from his boat; the last passenger had come
aboard at the last moment\x{2014}a fussy graybeard who kept the big
ship waiting while he haggled with his boatman over half a lira.
But at length we were off, the tug was shed, the lighthouse
passed, and Raffles and I leaned together over the rail, watching
our shadows on the pale green, liquid, veined marble that again
washed the vessel's side.",
