Things were done on an ad-hoc basis until <<about 1953|9c:0>>, when Turing came up with his final theorem; since then, we\'ve been putting magic on a systematic basis, on the QT. Most of it boils down to the application of Kaluza-Klein theory in a Linde universe constrained by an information conservation rule, or so they tell me when I ask. When we carry out a computation it has side effects that leak through some kind of channel underlying the structure of the Cosmos. Out there in the multiverse there are listeners; sometimes we can coerce them into opening gates. Small gates we can transfer minds through, or big gates we can move objects through. Even really huge gates, big enough to take something huge and unpleasant--some of the listeners are big. Giants. Sometimes we can invoke local reversals or enhancements of entropy; that\'s what I\'m doing right now with the sound damper field, fuzzing the air around us, which is already pretty random.

The Thule Society were basically mystical whack-jobs, but they had a lot of clout; in particular they were heavily into Masonic symbolism and a load of post-Theosophical guff about how the only true humans were the Aryan race, and the rest--the Mindwertigen, 'inferior beings'--were sapping their strength and purity and precious bodily fluids. All of this wouldn't have mattered much except a bunch of these goons were mixed up in Bavarian street politics, the Freikorps and so on. They sort of cross-fertilised with a small outfit called the NSDAP, whose leader was a former NCO and agent provocateur sent by the Landswehr to keep an eye on far-right movements. He picked up a lot of ideas from the Thule Society and when he got where he wanted he told the head of his personal bodyguard--a guy called Heinrich Himmler, another occult obsessive--to put Walter Darre, one of Alfred Rosenberg's prot\x{c3}\x{a9}g\x{c3}\x{a9}s, in charge of the Ahnenerbe Society. Ahnenerbe was originally independent, but rapidly turned into a branch of the SS <<after 1934|18:0>>; a sort of occult R&D department cum training college. Meanwhile the Gestapo orchestrated a pretty severe crackdown on all nonparty occultists in the Third Reich; Adolf wanted a monopoly on esoteric power, and he got it.\"",

She raises one eyebrow, arms crossed and shoulders set a trifle defensively. Who\'d have thought it? Being interviewed by higher authorities makes the alpha female detective defensive. "It\'s not like I\'ve got all day: I\'m due in a case committee briefing at <<noon|13>> and I\'ve got to pick up my son from school at <<four|9c:1>>."',

She pulls a face, which makes the scar on her forehead wrinkle into visibility. "If you want we can go over the team reports together. I take it that\'s what pulled you in?"',

One second it\'s zero zero twenty-six, the next it\'s zero <<seven fourteen|5k:1>>. Numbers to engrave in your heart.

            '"Code blue called at <<three thirty|5b>> the day before yesterday. I flew out to take a look, found a dead cow that had been zapped by SCORPION STARE--unless there\'s a basilisk loose in Milton Keynes--went down to our friends in Cheltenham for briefing yesterday, stayed overnight, came up here this morning. The cow was bought from a slaughterhouse and transported to the scene in a trailer towed by a stolen car, which was later dumped and transferred to this pound. Inspector Sullivan is our force liaison-external circle two, no need to know. She brought me here and I took a patch test, and right then someone zapped the car--we were lucky to survive. One down out front. We\'ve, uh, trapped a camera up top that I think will prove to have firmware loaded with SCORPION STARE, and I sniffed packets coming in from a compromised host. Police intranet, fire-walled to hell and back, hacked via some vile little dweeb using a primary school web server in South Korea. We were just about to run down the intruder in meat-space and go ask some pointed questions when you arrived." I yawn, and Andy looks at me oddly. Extreme stress sometimes does that to me, makes me tired, and I\'ve been running on my nerves for most of the past few days.',
