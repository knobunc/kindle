            "\x{201c}Now there was a great deal of discussion about the time at which the symptoms first set in. It is suggested by the defence that Philip Boyes may have taken the arsenic himself at some time between leaving Harriet Vane\x{2019}s flat and hailing the taxi in Guilford Street; and they bring forward books which show that in many cases the onset of symptoms takes place in a very short time after taking the arsenic\x{2014}a quarter of an hour, I think, was the shortest time mentioned where the arsenic was taken in liquid form. Now the prisoner\x{2019}s statement\x{2014}and we have no other\x{2014}is that Philip Boyes left her at <<10 o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and at ten minutes past he was in Guilford Street. He was then looking ill. It would not take many minutes to drive to Woburn Square at that hour of night, and by the time he got there, he was already in acute pain and hardly able to stand. Now Guilford Street is a very short way from Doughty Street\x{2014}perhaps three minutes\x{2019} walk\x{2014}and you must ask yourselves, if the prisoner\x{2019}s statement is correct, what he did with those ten minutes. Did he occupy himself in going to some quiet spot and taking a dose of arsenic, which he must in that case have brought with him in anticipation of an unfavourable interview with the prisoner? And I may remind you here, that the defence have brought no evidence to show that Philip Boyes ever bought any arsenic, or had access to any arsenic. That is not to say he could not have obtained it\x{2014}the purchases made by Harriet Vane show that the law about the sale of poisons is not always as effective as one would like it to be\x{2014}but the fact remains that the defence have not been able to show that the deceased ever had arsenic in his possession. And while we are on this subject, I will mention that, curiously enough, the analysts could find no traces of the charcoal, or indigo, with which commercial arsenic is supposed to be mixed. Whether it was bought by the prisoner or by the deceased himself, you would expect to find traces of the colouring matter. But you may think it likely that all such traces would be removed from the body by the vomiting and purging which took place.",

            "MY DEAR LORD PETER, I feel sure you will be anxious to hear, at the earliest possible moment how things are going, and though I have only been here one day, I really think I have not done so badly, all things considered!My train got in quite late on Monday night, after a most dreary journey, with a lugubrious wait at Preston, though thanks to your kindness in insisting that I should travel First-class, I was not really at all tired! Nobody can realise what a great difference these extra comforts make, especially when one is getting on in years, and after the uncomfortable travelling which I had to endure in my days of poverty, I feel that I am living in almost sinful luxury! The carriage was well heated\x{2014}indeed, too much so and I should have liked the window down, but that there was a very fat business man, muffled up to the eyes in coats and woolly waistcoats who strongly objected to fresh air! Men are such HOT-HOUSE PLANTS nowadays, are they not, quite unlike my dear father, who would never permit a fire in the house before November the 1st, or after March 31st even though the thermometer was at freezng-point!.I had no difficulty in getting a comfortable room at the Station Hotel, late as it was. In the old days, an unmarried woman arriving alone at <<midnight|13>> with a suitcase would hardly have been considered respectable\x{2014}what a wonderful difference one finds today! I am grateful to have lived to see such changes, because whatever old-fashioned people may say about the greater decorum and modesty of women in Queen Victoria\x{2019}s time, those who can remember the old conditions know how difficult and humiliating they were!Yesterday morning, of course, my first object was to find a suitable boarding-house, in accordance with your instructions, and I was fortunate enough to hit upon this house at the second attempt. It is very well run and refined, and there are three elderly ladies who are permanent boarders here, and are well up in all the GOSSIP of the town, so that nothing could be more advantageous for our purpose!!As soon as I had engaged my room, I went out for a little voyage of discovery. I found a very helpful policeman in the High Street, and asked him where to find Mrs. Wrayburn\x{2019}s house. He knew it quite well, and told me to take the omnibus and it would be a penny ride to the \x{201c}Fisherman\x{2019}s Arms\x{201d} and then about 5 minutes\x{2019} walk. So I followed his directions, and the \x{2019}bus took me right into the country to a cross-roads with the \x{201c}Fisherman\x{2019}s Arms\x{201d} at the corner. The conductor was most polite and helpful and showed me the way, so I had no difficulty in finding the house.It is a beautiful old place, standing in its own grounds\x{2014}quite a big house built in the eighteenth century, with an Italian porch and a lovely green lawn with a cedar-tree and formal flower-beds, and in summer must be really a garden of Eden. I looked at it from the road for a little time\x{2014}I did not think this would be at all peculiar behaviour, if anybody saw me, because anybody might be interested in such a fine old place. Most of the blinds were down, as though the greater part of the house were uninhabited, and I could not see any gardener or anybody about\x{2014}I suppose there is not very much to be done in the garden this time of the year. One of the chimneys was smoking, however, so there were some signs of life about the place.I took a little walk down the road and then turned back and passed the house again, and this time I saw a servant just passing round the corner of the house, but of course she was too far off for me to speak to. So I took the omnibus back again and had lunch at Hillside View, so as to make acquaintance with my fellow-boarders.Naturally I did not want to seem too eager all at-once, so I said nothing about Mrs. Wrayburn\x{2019}s house at first, but just talked generally about Windle. I had some difficulty in parrying the questions of the good ladies, who wondered very much why a stranger had come to Windle at this time of year, but without telling many actual untruths I think I left them with the impression that I had come into a little fortune (!) and was visiting the Lake District to find a suitable spot in which to settle next summer! I talked about sketching\x{2014}as girls we were all brought up to dabble a little in water-colours, so that I was able to display quite sufficient technical knowledge to satisfy them!That gave me quite a good opportunity to ask about the house!! Such a beautiful old place, I said, and did anybody live there? (Of course I did not blurt this out all at once\x{2014}I waited till they had told me of the many quaint spots in the district that would interest an artist!) Mrs. Pegler, a very stout, PUSSY old lady, with a LONG TONGUE ( ! ) was able to tell me all about it. My dear Lord Peter, what I do not know now about the abandoned wickedness of Mrs. Wrayburn\x{2019}s early life is really NOT WORTH KNOWING!! But what was more to the point is that she told me the name of Mrs. Wrayburn\x{2019}s nurse-companion. She is a MISS BOOTH, a retired nurse, about sixty years old, and she lives all alone in the house with Mrs. Wrayburn, except for the servants, and a housekeeper. When I heard that Mrs. Wrayburn was so old, and paralysed and frail, I said was it not very dangerous that Miss Booth should be the only attendant, but Mrs. Pegler said the housekeeper was a most trustworthy woman who had been with Mrs. Wrayburn for many years, and was quite capable of looking after her any time when Miss Booth was out. So it appears that Miss Booth does go out sometimes! Nobody in this house seems to know her personally, but they say she is often to be seen in the town in nurse\x{2019}s uniform. I managed to extract quite a good description of her, so if I should happen to meet her, I daresay I shall be smart enough to recognise her!That is really all I have been able to discover in one day. I hope you will not be too disappointed, but I was obliged to listen to a terrible amount of local history of one kind and another, and of course I could not FORCE the conversation round to Mrs. Wrayburn in any suspicious way.I will let you know as soon as I get the least bit more information.MOST SINCERELY YOURS, KATHARINE ALEXANDRA CLIMPSON.Miss Climpson finished her letter in the privacy of her bedroom, and secured it carefully in her capacious handbag before going downstairs. A long experience of boarding-house life warned her that to display openly an envelope addressed even to a minor member of the nobility would be to court a quite unnecessary curiosity. True, it would establish her status, but at that moment Miss Climpson hardly wished to move in the limelight. She crept quietly out at the hall door, and turned her steps towards the centre of the town.",
