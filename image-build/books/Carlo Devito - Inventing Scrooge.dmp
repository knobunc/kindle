            "Dickens had a profound concern for the working class, and especially the countless exploited children who had been forced to work in factories at a young age. Charles\x{2019} father, John Dickens, was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors\x{2019} prison in Southwark, London, in 1824. Charles had taken a job just two weeks before his father was sent to Marshalsea. He worked and pawned his mother\x{2019}s jewelry and family furniture in a local shop on Hampstead Road, not far from the Euston train shed, where he became well known until they had run out of things to sell. His mother and the youngest children then joined John Dickens at Marshalsea (a common occurrence in those days). Charles, then twelve years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at <<112|9n:0>> College Place, Camden Town. According to Dickens, she was \x{201c}a reduced [impoverished] old lady, long known to our family.\x{201d} Dickens was forced to work in a boot black factory labeling pots of boot black six days a week, from <<8 a.m.|5>> to <<8 p.m.|5>>, for six shillings a week, and was allowed to visit with his family at Marshalsea on Sundays. Child laborers, as he had once been forced to experience firsthand, suffered immensely from ignorance and want.",

            "\x{201c}The restlessness of a great city, and the way in which it tumbles and tosses before it can get to sleep, formed one of the first entertainments offered to the contemplation of us houseless people. It lasted about two hours. We lost a great deal of companionship when the late public-houses turned their lamps out, and when the potmen thrust the last brawling drunkards into the street; but stray vehicles and stray people were left us, after that. If we were very lucky, a policeman\x{2019}s rattle sprang and a fray turned up; but, in general, surprisingly little of this diversion was provided. Except in the Haymarket, which is the worst kept part of London, and about Kent-street in the Borough, and along a portion of the line of the Old Kent-road, the peace was seldom violently broken,\x{201d} Dickens remarked. \x{201c}After all seemed quiet, if one cab rattled by, half-a-dozen would surely follow; and Houselessness even observed that intoxicated people appeared to be magnetically attracted towards each other; so that we knew when we saw one drunken object staggering against the shutters of a shop, that another drunken object would stagger up before five minutes were out, to fraternise or fight with it. When we made a divergence from the regular species of drunkard, the thin-armed, puff-faced, leaden-lipped gin-drinker, and encountered a rarer specimen of a more decent appearance, <<fifty to one|10a:1>> but that specimen was dressed in soiled mourning.

            "In England and Wales a workhouse, colloquially known as a \x{201c}spike,\x{201d} was a place where those unable to support themselves were offered accommodation and employment. The earliest known use of the term dates from <<1631|9c:0>>. Life in a workhouse was intended to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor, and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to the poor in England living outside workhouses in Victorian times, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities never managed to reconcile. As the nineteenth century wore on, workhouses increasingly became refuges for the elderly, infirm, and sick rather than the able-bodied poor.",
