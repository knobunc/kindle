            "It is <<10:43 A.M.|2a>>, Eastern Daylight Savings Time. The current temperature reading in Central Park is 57\x{b0}. The humidity stands at 28% and the barometer is 30.30 and falling, with the wind northeast at 11 miles per hour. The forecast is for fair skies and sunny weather today, tonight, and tomorrow, with the highs in the low to middle 60\x{2019}s. The chance of precipitation is zero today and 10% tomorrow. Air quality level is rated good. David Selig is 41 and counting. Slightly above medium height, he has the lean figure of a bachelor accustomed to his own meager cooking, and his customary facial expression is a mild, puzzled frown. He blinks a lot. In his faded blue denim jacket, heavy-duty boots, and 1969-vintage striped bells he presents a superficially youthful appearance, at least from the neck down; but in fact he looks like some sort of refugee from an illicit research laboratory where the balding, furrowed heads of anguished middle-aged men are grafted to the reluctant bodies of adolescent boys. How did this happen to him? At what point did his face and scalp begin to grow old? The dangling cables of the elevator hurl shrieks of mocking laughter at him as he descends from his two-room refuge on the twelfth floor. He wonders if those rusty cables might be even older than he is. He is of the 1935 vintage. This housing project, he suspects, might date from 1933 or 1934. The Hon. Fiorello H. LaGuardia, Mayor. Though perhaps it\x{2019}s younger\x{2014}just immediately prewar, say. (Do you remember 1940, Duvid? That was the year we took you to the World\x{2019}s Fair.

            "David was aware of his parents\x{2019} frantic attempts at filling Hittner\x{2019}s prescription. No time to waste; the boy grows older all the time, siblingless, lacking each day the means of learning the best techniques of relating to his peers. And so, night after night, the poor aging bodies of Paul and Martha Selig grapple with the problem. They force themselves sweatily onward to self-defeating prodigies of lustfulness, and each month the bad news comes in a rush of blood: there will be no sibling this time. But at last the seed takes root. They said nothing about that to him, ashamed, perhaps, to admit to an eight-year-old that such things as sexual intercourse occurred in their lives. But he knew. He knew why his mother\x{2019}s belly was beginning to bulge and why they still hesitated to explain it to him. He knew, too, that his mother\x{2019}s mysterious \x{201c}appendicitis\x{201d} attack of July, 1944, was actually a miscarriage. He knew why they both wore tragic faces for months afterward. He knew that Martha\x{2019}s doctor had told her that autumn that it really wasn\x{2019}t wise for her to be having babies at the age of 35, that if they were going to insist on a second child the best course was to adopt one. He knew his father\x{2019}s traumatic response to that suggestion: What, bring into the household a bastard that some shiksa threw away? Poor old Paul lay tossing awake every night for weeks, not even confessing to his wife why he was so upset, but unknowingly spilling the whole thing to his nosy son. The insecurities, the irrational hostilities. Why do I have to raise a stranger\x{2019}s brat, just because this psychiatrist says it\x{2019}ll do David some good? What kind of garbage will I be taking into the house? How can I love this child that isn\x{2019}t mine? How can I tell it that it\x{2019}s a Jew when\x{2014}who knows?\x{2014}it may have been made by some Irish mick, some Italian bootblack, some carpenter? All this the all-perceiving David perceives. Finally the elder Selig voices his misgivings, carefully edited, to his wife, saying, Maybe Hittner\x{2019}s wrong, maybe this is just a phase David\x{2019}s going through and another child isn\x{2019}t the right answer at all. Telling her to consider the expense, the changes they\x{2019}d have to make in their way of life\x{2014}they\x{2019}re not young, they\x{2019}ve grown settled in their ways, a child at this time of their lives, the getting up at <<four in the morning|9a>>, the crying, the diapers. And David silently cheering his father on, because who needs this intruder, this sibling, this enemy of the peace? But Martha tearfully fights back, quoting Hittner\x{2019}s letter, reading key passages out of her extensive library on child psychology, offering damning statistics on the incidence of neurosis, maladjustment, bedwetting, and homosexuality among only children. The old man yields by Christmas. Okay, okay, we\x{2019}ll adopt, but let\x{2019}s not take just anything, hear? It\x{2019}s got to be Jewish. Wintry weeks of touring the adoption agencies, pretending all the while to David that these trips to Manhattan are mere innocuous shopping excursions. He wasn\x{2019}t fooled. How could anyone fool this omniscient child? He had only to look behind their foreheads to know that they were shopping for a sibling. His one comfort was the hope that they would fail to find one. This was still wartime: if you couldn\x{2019}t buy a new car, maybe you couldn\x{2019}t get siblings either. For many weeks that appeared to be the case. Not many babies were available, and those that were seemed to have some grave defect: insufficiently Jewish, or too fragile-looking, or too cranky, or of the wrong sex. Some boys were available but Paul and Martha had decided to get David a little sister. Already that limited things considerably, since people tended not to give girls up for adoption as readily as they did boys, but one snowy night in March David detected an ominous note of satisfaction in the mind of his mother, newly returned from yet another shopping trip, and, looking more closely, he realized that the quest was over. She had found a lovely little girl, four months old. The mother, aged 19, was not only certifiably Jewish but even a college girl, described by the agency as \x{201c}extremely intelligent.\x{201d} Not so intelligent, evidently, as to avoid being fertilized by a handsome, young air force captain, also Jewish, while he was home on leave in February, 1944. Though he felt remorse over his carelessness he was unwilling to marry the victim of his lusts, and was now on active duty in the Pacific, where, so far as the girl\x{2019}s parents were concerned he should only be shot down ten times over. They had forced her to give the child out for adoption. David wondered why Martha hadn\x{2019}t brought the baby home with her that very afternoon, but soon he discovered that several weeks of legal formalities lay ahead, and April was well along before his mother finally announced, \x{201c}Dad and I have a wonderful surprise for you, Duvid.\x{201d}",

Toni seemed a little clutched; I didn\x{2019}t know whether she was bothered about my insisting that she trip without me or just troubled, here at the brink of it, by the whole idea of tripping. There wasn\x{2019}t much conversation. She filled an ashtray with a great dismal mound of half-smoked cigarettes. From time to time she grinned nervously. From time to time I took her hand and smiled encouragingly. During this touching scene various of the tenants with whom we shared the kitchen on this floor of the hotel drifted in and out. First Eloise, the sleek black hooker. Then Miss Theotokis, the grim-faced nurse who worked at St. Luke\x{2019}s. Mr. Wong, the mysterious little roly-poly Chinese who always walked around in his underwear. Aitken, the scholarly fag from Toledo, and his cadaverous mainlining roommate, Donaldson. A couple of them nodded to us but no one actually said anything, not even \x{201c}Good morning.\x{201d} In this place it was proper to behave as though your neighbors were invisible. The fine old New York tradition. <<About half past ten in the morning|10>> Toni said, \x{201c}Get me some orange juice, will you?\x{201d} I poured a glass from the container in the refrigerator that was labeled with my name. Giving me a wink and a broad toothy smile, all false bravado, she wadded up the blotting paper and pushed it into her mouth, bolting it and gulping the orange juice as a chaser.",

            "I stayed with them the rest of the afternoon. They gave me a tranquilizer and brought me gently through the downslope of the trip. The psychedelic images still came to me out of Toni for half an hour or so, as though an inexorable umbilical chain linked us across all the length of the hallway; but then to my relief the sense of contact began to slip and fade, and suddenly, with a kind of audible click at the moment of severance, it was gone altogether. The flamboyant phantoms ceased to vex my soul. Color and dimension and texture returned to their proper states. And at last I was free from that merciless reflected self-image. Once I was fully alone in my own skull again I felt like weeping to celebrate my deliverance, but no tears would come, and I sat passively, sipping a Bromo-Seltzer. Time trickled away. Donaldson and Aitken and I talked in a peaceful, civilized, burned-out way about Bach, medieval art, Richard M. Nixon, pot, and a great many other things. I hardly knew these two, yet they were willing to surrender their time to ease a stranger\x{2019}s pain. Eventually I felt better. <<Shortly before six o\x{2019}clock|6>>, thanking them gravely, I went back to my room. Toni was not there. The place seemed oddly altered. Books were gone from the shelves, prints from the walls; the closet door stood open and half the things in it were missing. In my befuddled, fatigued state it took me a moment or two to grasp what had happened. At first I imagined burglary, abduction, but then I saw the truth. She had moved out.",

Entering, I pick up a somewhat more immediate and vivid version of the generalized persona he constantly projects: the hyped-up black pride, the mistrust of the paleface stranger, the chuckling enjoyment of his own lean long-legged muscular frame. But these are mere residual attitudes, the standard furniture of his mind. I have not yet reached the level of this-minute thought. I have not penetrated to the essential Yahya Lumumba, the unique individual whose style I must assume. I push deeper. As I sink in, I sense a distinct warming of the psychic temperature, an outflow of heat, comparable perhaps to what a miner might experience five miles down, tunneling toward the magmatic fires at the earth\x{2019}s core.

He\x{2019}s slept with everything that walks or crawls, masculine feminine neuter, including of course my accessible sister Judith, whom\x{2014}according to a neatly filed surface memory\x{2014}he last penetrated just five hours ago, in this very room. His semen now curdles within her. He is obscurely restless over the fact that she never has come with him; he takes it as a failure of his flawless technique. The professor is speculating in a civilized way on the possibilities of nailing me before the night is out. No hope, professor. I will not be added to your Selig collection. He asks me pleasantly about my degrees. \x{201c}Just <<one|9k:0>>,\x{201d} I say. \x{201c}A B.A. in \x{2019}56. I thought about doing graduate work in English literature but never got around to it.\x{201d} He teaches Rimbaud, Verlain, Mallarm\x{e9}, Baudelaire, Lautr\x{e9}amont, that whole sick crew, and identifies with them spiritually; his classes are full of adoring Barnard girls whose thighs open gladly for him, although in his Rimbaud facet he is not averse to romping with hearty Columbia men on occasions. As he talks to me he fondles Judith\x{2019}s shoulderblades affectionately, proprietorially. Dr. Silvestri appears not to notice, or else not to care. \x{201c}Your sister,\x{201d} Guermantes murmurs, \x{201c}she is a marvel, she is an original, a splendor\x{2014}a type, M\x{2019}sieu Selig, a type.\x{201d} A compliment, in the froggish sense. I poke his mind again and learn that he is writing a novel about a bitter, voluptuous young divorcee and a French intellectual who is an incarnation of the life-force, and expects to make millions from it. He fascinates me: so blatant, so phony, so manipulative, and yet so attractive despite all his transparent failings. He offers me cocktails, highballs, liqueurs, brandies, pot, hash, cocaine, anything I crave. I feel engulfed and escape from him, in some relief, slipping away to pour a little rum.",

            "\x{201c}Far out,\x{201d} she says, and drops her jeans. No underpants. She will be fat before she\x{2019}s 30. Her thighs are thick, her belly protrudes. Her pubic hair is oddly dense and widespread, less a triangle than a sort of diamond, a black diamond reaching past her loins to her hips, almost. Her buttocks are deeply dimpled. While I inspect her flesh I savagely ransack her mind, sparing her no areas of privacy, enjoying my access while it lasts. I don\x{2019}t need to be polite. I owe her nothing: she forced herself on me. I check, first, to see if she had been lying when she said she\x{2019}d never heard of Kitty. The truth: Kitty is no kin to her. A meaningless coincidence of surnames, is all. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sure you\x{2019}re a poet, Dave,\x{201d} she says as we entwine and drop onto the unmade bed. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s an intuition flash too. Even if you\x{2019}re doing this term paper thing now, poetry is where you\x{2019}re really at, right?\x{201d} I run my hands over her breasts and belly. A sharp odor comes from her skin. She hasn\x{2019}t washed in three or four days, I bet. No matter. Her nipples mysteriously emerge, tiny rigid pink nubs. She wriggles. I continue to loot her mind like a Goth plundering the Forum. She is fully open to me; I delight in this unexpected return of vigor. Her autobiography assembles itself for me. Born in Cambridge. Twenty years old. Father a professor. Mother a professor. One younger brother. Tomboy childhood. Measles, chicken pox, scarlet fever. Puberty at <<eleven|9c:1>>, lost her virginity at <<twelve|9c:1>>. Abortion at sixteen. Several Lesbian adventures. Passionate interest in French decadent poets. Acid, mescaline, psilocybin, cocaine, even a sniff of smack. Guermantes gave her that. Guermantes also took her to bed five or six times. Vivid memories of that. Her mind shows me more of Guermantes than I want to see. He\x{2019}s hung very impressively. Lisa comes through with a tough, aggressive self-image, captain of her soul, master of her fate, etc. Underneath that it\x{2019}s just the opposite, of course; she\x{2019}s scared as hell. Not a bad kid. I feel a little guilty about the casual way I slammed into her head, no regard for her privacy at all. But I have my needs. I continue to prowl her, and meanwhile she goes down on me. I can hardly remember the last time anyone did that. I can hardly remember my last lay, it\x{2019}s been so bad lately. She\x{2019}s an expert fellatrice. I\x{2019}d like to reciprocate but I can\x{2019}t bring myself to do it; sometimes I\x{2019}m fastidious and she\x{2019}s not the douching type. Oh, well, leave that stuff for the Guermanteses of this world. I lie there picking her brain and accepting the gift of her mouth. I feel virile, bouncy, cocksure, and why not, getting my kicks from two inputs at once, head and crotch? Without withdrawing from her mind I withdraw, at last, from her lips, turn around, part her thighs, slide deep into her tight narrow-mouthed harbor. Selig the stallion. Selig the stud. \x{201c}Oooh,\x{201d} she says, flexing her knees. \x{201c}Oooh.\x{201d} And we begin to play the beast with two backs. Covertly I feed on feedback, tapping into her pleasure-responses and thereby doubling my own; each thrust brings me a factored and deliciously exponential delight. But then a funny thing happens. Although she is nowhere close to coming\x{2014}an event that I know will disrupt our mental contact when it occurs\x{2014}the broadcast from her mind is already becoming erratic and indistinct, more noise than signal. The images break up in a pounding of static. What comes through is garbled and distant; I scramble to maintain my hold on her consciousness, but no use, no use, she slips away, moment by moment receding from me, until there is no communion at all. And in that moment of severance my cock suddenly softens and slips out of her. She is jolted by that, caught by surprise. \x{201c}What brought you down?\x{201d} she asks. I find it impossible to tell her. I remember Judith asking me, some weeks back, whether I had ever regarded my loss of mental powers as a kind of metaphor of impotence. Sometimes yes, I told her. And now here, for the first time, metaphor blends with reality; the two failures are integrated. He is impotent here and he is impotent there. Poor David. \x{201c}I guess I got distracted,\x{201d} I tell her. Well, she has her skills; for half an hour she works me over, fingers, lips, tongue, hair, breasts, not getting a rise out of me with anything, in fact turning me off more than ever by her grim purposefulness. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t understand it,\x{201d} she says. \x{201c}You were doing so well. Was there something about me that brought you down?\x{201d} I reassure her. You were great, baby. Stuff like this sometimes just happens, no one knows why. I tell her, \x{201c}Let\x{2019}s just rest and maybe I\x{2019}ll come back to life.\x{201d} We rest. Side by side, stroking her skin in an abstract way, I run a few tentative probing efforts. Not a flicker on the telepathic level. Not a flicker. The silence of the tomb. Is this it, the end, right here and now? Is this where it finally burns out? And I am like all the rest of you now. I am condemned to make do with mere words. \x{201c}I have an idea,\x{201d} she says. \x{201c}Let\x{2019}s take a shower together. That sometimes peps a guy up.\x{201d} To this I make no objection; it might just work, and in any case she\x{2019}ll smell better afterward. We head for the bathroom. Torrents of brisk cool water.",

The impact of what has befallen me hasn\x{2019}t really registered yet. How strange that I can be so accepting. At any moment, I know, it\x{2019}s bound to come rushing in on me, crushing me, shattering me; I\x{2019}ll weep, I\x{2019}ll scream, I\x{2019}ll bang my head against walls. But for now I\x{2019}m surprisingly cool. An oddly posthumous feeling, as of having outlived myself.

The market hadn\x{2019}t opened yet, most of the customers had fled to the Catskills for the summer, and the only people in the office were Martinson, the manager, Nadel, one of the other customer\x{2019}s men, and Selig. Martinson was going over his totals, Nadel was on the phone to somebody downtown trying to work a complicated finagle in American Photocopy, and Selig, idle, was daydreaming of falling in love with somebody\x{2019}s beautiful granddaughter. Then the door opened and somebody\x{2019}s beautiful granddaughter came in. Not exactly beautiful, maybe, but certainly attractive: a girl in her early twenties, slim and well proportioned, perhaps five feet three or four, with fluffy light-brown hair, blue-green eyes, finely outlined features, a graceful slender figure. She seemed shy, intelligent, somehow innocent, a curious mixture of knowledge and naivet\x{e9}. She wore a white silk blouse\x{2014}gold chain lying on the smallish breasts\x{2014}and an ankle-length brown skirt, offering a hint of excellent legs beneath. No, not a beautiful girl, but certainly pretty. Refreshing to look at. What the hell, Selig wondered, does she want in this temple of Mammon at her age? She\x{2019}s here fifty years too early. Curiosity led him to send a probe drilling into her forehead as she walked toward him. Seeking only surface stuff: name, age, marital status, address, telephone number, purpose of visit\x{2014}what else?",

Then he would churn her account every few months, switch Polaroid into Xerox, Texas Instruments into Fairchild Camera, Collins into American Motors, American Motors back into Polaroid, running up fancy commissions for himself and, perhaps, making some money for her, or perhaps losing some. Selig had no stomach for such maneuvers. \x{201c}This is going to sound stodgy,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}but let\x{2019}s play it very safe. I\x{2019}ll recommend some decent things that won\x{2019}t ever make you rich but that you won\x{2019}t get hurt on, either. And then you can just put them away and watch them grow, without having to check the market quotations every day to find out if you ought to sell. Because you don\x{2019}t really want to bother worrying about the short-term fluctuations, do you?\x{201d} This was absolutely not what Martinson had instructed him to tell new clients, but to hell with that. He got her some Jersey Standard, some Telephone, a little IBM, two good electric utilities, and 30 shares of a closed-end fund called Lehman Corporation that a lot of his elderly customers owned. She didn\x{2019}t ask questions, didn\x{2019}t even want to know what a closed-end fund was. \x{201c}There,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Now you have a portfolio. You\x{2019}re a capitalist.\x{201d} She smiled. It was a shy, half-forced smile, but he thought he detected flirtatiousness in her eyes. It was agony for him not to be able to read her, to be compelled to depend on external signals alone in order to know where he stood with her. But he took the chance. \x{201c}What are you doing this evening?\x{201d} he asked. \x{201c}I get out of here at <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>.\x{201d}",

            "That November afternoon I picked up emanations of fear on all sides as I walked fearfully home. Paranoia was general everywhere. People sidled warily, one shoulder in front of the other, ready to bolt. Pale female faces peered between parted curtains in the windows of the towering apartment houses, high above the silent streets. The drivers of cars looked in all directions at intersections, as if expecting the tanks of the storm troopers to come rumbling down Broadway. (At this time of day it was generally believed that the assassination was the first blow in a right-wing putsch.) No one lingered in the open; everyone hurried toward shelter. Anything might happen now. Packs of wolves might burst out of Riverside Drive. Maddened patriots might launch a pogrom. From my apartment\x{2014}door bolted, windows locked\x{2014}I tried to phone you at the computer center, thinking you might somehow not have heard the news, or perhaps I just wanted to hear your voice in this traumatic time. The telephone lines were choked. I gave up the attempt after twenty minutes. Then, wandering aimlessly from bedroom to livingroom and back, clutching my transistor, twisting the dial trying to find the one radio station whose newscaster would tell me that he was still alive after all, I detoured into the kitchen and found your note on the table, telling me that you were leaving, that you couldn\x{2019}t stay with me any more. The note was dated <<10:30 A.M.|2a>>, before the assassination, in another era. I rushed to the bed-room closet and saw what I had not seen before, that your things were gone.
