            "Priceless advice, and that Courage! was like the touch of a friend\x{2019}s hand. I hugged the book against me, feeling less alone than I had all day. It seemed <<near midday|13>>, and the Dragon hadn\x{2019}t eaten at our village, so I set about dinner. I was no great cook, but my mother had kept me at it until I could put together a meal, and I did do all the gathering for my family, so I knew how to tell the fresh from the rotten, and when a piece of fruit would be sweet. I\x{2019}d never had so many stores to work with: there were even drawers of spices that smelled like Midwinter cake, and a whole barrel full of fresh soft grey salt.",

            "One day I tried to keep away entirely. I thought if I left his meal early, he might forget about me for a day. I laid his breakfast as dawn broke, then hurried away and hid in the back of the kitchens. But promptly at <<seven|9c:1>>, one of his wisp-things, the ones I\x{2019}d sometimes seen floating down the Spindle towards the Wood, came gliding down the stairs. Seen close, it was a misshapen soap-bubble thing, rippling and shifting, almost invisible unless the light caught on its iridescent skin. The wisp went bobbing in and out of corners, until at last it reached me and came to hover over my knees insistently. I stared up at it from my huddle and saw my own face looking back in ghostly outline. Slowly I unfolded myself and followed the wisp back up to the library, where he set aside his book and glared at me.",

Danka was overseeing the work; she waved my father over, our horses whuffling uneasily as they drew nearer and smelled the corruption on the wind. \x{201c}All right,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}We\x{2019}ll be ready <<before noon|13>>. We\x{2019}ll heave wood and hay over, in among them, and then light torches with the potion and throw them in.

Old Jaga had died a long time ago, but there weren\x{2019}t very many songs about her, and bards mostly sang them warily, only in summer, at <<midday|13>>. She had been dead and buried five hundred years, but that hadn\x{2019}t stopped her turning up in Rosya only forty years ago, at the baptism of the newborn prince. She\x{2019}d turned six guards who tried to stop her into toads, put two other wizards to sleep, then she\x{2019}d gone over to the baby and peered frowning down at him. Then she\x{2019}d straightened up and announced in irritation, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve fallen out of time,\x{201d} before vanishing in a great cloud of smoke.",
