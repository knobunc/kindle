By <<1930|9n:0>>, we had his general theory of relativity, which makes the revolutionary claim that the geometry of space is not fixed but evolves in time. The wave-particle duality uncovered by Einstein in 1905 had become a fully realized quantum theory, which gave us a 
detailed understanding of atoms, chemistry, matter, and radiation. By <<1930|9n:0>> we also knew that the universe contained huge numbers of galaxies like our own, and we knew they were moving away from one another. The implications were not yet clear, but we knew we lived in an expanding universe.",

Proponents of the aether theory had just adjusted their predictions so as to make it harder and harder to detect Earth\x{2019}s motion. This was easy to do, because when they did calculations they used Maxwell\x{2019}s theory, which, when correctly interpreted, agreed with Einstein\x{2019}s expectations that motion was not detectable.

Unlike his contemporaries, Einstein had taken a route to the unification of gravity with relativity that brought him back to the very foundation of the principle of relativity: the unification of motion and rest discovered by Galileo several centuries earlier. That unification involved only uniform motion\x{2014}that is, motion in a straight line at a constant speed. Beginning 
<<around 1907|18:0>>, Einstein started to ask himself about other types of motion, such as accelerated motion. This is motion whose speed or direction changes. Shouldn\x{2019}t the distinction between accelerating and nonaccelerating motion somehow be erased?",

This theory, invented by the mathematician Herman Weyl, contained a beautiful mathematical idea that was to become the core of the standard model of particle physics. Yet it failed, because in Weyl\x{2019}s original version it had big consequences that disagreed with experiment. One was that the length of an object would depend on the path it took. If you took two meter sticks, separated them, and then brought them back together and compared them, they would in general be different in length. This is more radical then special relativity, which holds that meter sticks can indeed appear to have different lengths, but only when they are moving relative to each other, not when they are compared at rest. It also, of course, disagrees with our experience of nature.",

            "But there was an even more fundamental problem, which had to do with the relationship of the unified theories to the quantum theory. The early attempts at unified-field theories took place before quantum mechanics was completely formulated, in 1926. Indeed, a few of the quantum theory\x{2019}s proponents had interesting speculations about the relationship between the extra dimensions and quantum theory. But <<after 1930|18:0>> or so, there was a split. Most physicists ignored the problem of unification and concentrated instead on applying quantum theory to a vast array of phenomena, from the properties of materials to the processes by which stars produce energy. At the same time, those few who persisted in working on the unified theories increasingly ignored quantum theory. These people (Einstein included) worked as if Planck, Bohr, Heisenberg, and 
Schr\x{f6}dinger had never existed. They were living after the quantum-mechanical revolution but pretending to work in an intellectual universe in which that revolution had never occurred. They seemed to their contemporaries like the quaint communities of Russian \x{e9}migr\x{e9} aristocrats who, in the 1920s and 1930s, carried on their elaborate social rituals in Paris and New York as if they were back in tsarist Saint Petersburg.",

It took only a few years to work this out in detail, but the result was just a theory of photons moving freely; the next step would be to incorporate charged particles, such as electrons or protons, and describe how they interact with photons. The goal was a fully consistent theory of quantum electrodynamics, or QED. This was much more challenging. QED was first solved by the Japanese physicist Sin-Itiro Tomonaga during World War II, but the news did not reach the rest of the world until <<1948|9c:0>> or so. By then, QED had been constructed twice more, independently, by the young Americans Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger.',

            'So many hopes are riding on the LHC because what it finds will also tell us a lot about one of the five key problems mentioned in chapter 1: how to explain the values of the free constants of the standard model. To see why, we need to understand one very striking feature of these values, which is that they are either very large or very small. One example is the wildly differing strengths of the forces. The electrical repulsion between two protons is stronger than their gravitational attraction by a huge factor, <<around 10|9:1>>. There are also huge differences in the masses of the particles. For example, the electron has /1,800 the mass of a proton. And the Higgs boson, if it exists, has a mass of at least 120 times that of the proton.',

General relativity describes the history of the world most fundamentally in terms of events and relationships between them. The principal relationships have to do with causality; one event may be in the chain of causes leading to another event. From this point of view, space is a secondary concept. The concept of space is in fact entirely dependent on the notion of time. Given a clock, we can think of all the events that are simultaneous with the clock striking <<noon|11>>.

But in addition to the reasons I spelled out earlier, M-theory must be background-independent because the five superstring theories, with all their different manifolds and geometries, are supposed to be part of M-theory. This includes all the different ways those geometries could be wrapped up, in all spatial dimensions from <<one to ten|10a:0>>. They all provide backgrounds for strings and branes to move.

            "The main effect of adding such large extra dimensions is that the gravitational force in the four- or five-dimensional world turns out to be much stronger than it appears to be on the three-dimensional brane, so quantum gravitational effects happen at a much larger length scale than otherwise expected. In quantum theory, a larger length scale means a smaller energy. By making the extra dimensions as large as a millimeter, one can bring down the energy scale at which quantum-gravity effects should be seen\x{2014}from the Planck energy, which is <<10|9d:1>> GeV, to only 1,000 GeV. This would resolve one of the most stubborn questions about the parameters of the standard model: that is, Why is the Planck energy so many orders of magnitude bigger than the mass of the proton? But what is really exciting is that it would bring quantum-gravity phenomena within range of being revealed by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), coming online in 2007. Among these effects could be the production of quantum black holes in collisions of elementary particles. This would be a dramatic discovery.",

The second term, the first that could possibly be infinite, can easily be shown to be finite. It took until <<2001|18:0>> for a complete proof of the finiteness of the third term. It was heroic work, carried out over many years by Eric D\x{2019}Hoker at UCLA and his collaborator Duong H. Phong, at Columbia University. They have since then been working on the fourth term. They understand a great deal about this term but have no proof so far that it is finite. Whether or not they succeed in proving all the infinite terms finite remains to be seen. Part of the problem they face is that the algorithm for writing down the theory becomes ambiguous past the second term, so they need to first find the right definition for the theory before they can try proving that it gives finite answers.",

            "Unfortunately the ten-dimensional superstring pretending to be the most successful among existing string models is strictly defined, in general, only at tree and one-loop levels. Starting from the two-loop corrections to the scattering amplitudes all expressions in the perturbative superstring theory are really not defined. The reason for that comes from the well-known problems with supergeometry or integration over the \x{201c}superpartners\x{201d} of the moduli of complex structures. In contrast to the bosonic case where the integration measure is fixed by the Belavin-Knizhnik theorem, the definition of the integration measure over supermoduli (or, more strictly, the odd moduli of super-complex structures) is still an unsolved problem [88, 22]. The moduli 
spaces of the complex structures of Riemann surfaces are non compact, and the integration over such spaces requires special care and additional definitions. In the bosonic case, when the integrals over moduli spaces diverge, the result of integration in (<<3.14|5a:0>>) is defined only up to certain \x{201c}boundary terms\x{201d} (the contributions of degenerate Riemann surfaces or the surfaces of lower genera (with less \x{201c}handles\x{201d}). In the superstring case one runs into more serious problems since the very notion of the \x{201c}boundary of moduli space\x{201d} is not defined. Indeed the integral over the Grassmann odd variables does not \x{201c}know\x{201d} what is the boundary term. This is the fundamental reason why the integration measure in fermionic string is not well-defined and depends on the \x{201c}gauge choice\x{201d} or the particular choice for the \x{201c}zero modes\x{201d} in the action (<<3.23|5a:0>>). For two-loop contributions this problem can be solved \x{201c}empirically\x{201d} (see [88, 22]), but in the general setup the superstring perturbation theory is not mathematically well defined. Moreover, these are not problems of the formalism: the same obstacles arise in less geometrical approach of Green and Schwarz [91].",
