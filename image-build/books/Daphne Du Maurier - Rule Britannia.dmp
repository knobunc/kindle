It didn\x{2019}t matter about the boys, but Mad and Dottie must sleep on. Ben grinned, and scrambling to the far end of the cellar made water onto a pile of logs. This is what we shall all be doing, she thought, if it continues, if the rumbles in the distance never cease, for, although the house no longer shook, somewhere, higher than it had been during the night, aircraft were flying, but in what direction, whether inland or out to sea, it was impossible to tell.",

It is now reported, but this again has not yet been confirmed, that the explosion which destroyed the U.S. vessel some days ago at anchor in Poldrea bay with severe loss of life may also have been caused by torpedo action. In any event, the recent security regulations affecting the local population have now been relaxed, and the marine commandos have relinquished the port and beach of Poldrea for the time being and handed them back to the local authorities, who state that it may be a few days before things return to normal.\x{201d} He looked down at a piece of paper in his hand. \x{201c}A Cabinet meeting will be held in Downing Street this morning.
