            "Heisenberg\x{2019}s insight was prophetic. In the spring of 1925, suffering from severe hay fever, he decamped to Helgoland in the North Sea, a rocky island devoid of pollen. There, between long walks and contemplating Goethe\x{2019}s West-\x{f6}stlicher Divan, he developed the early mathematics that would become the basis for modern quantum theory. Heisenberg recalled later, \x{201c}It was <<almost three o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> before the final result of my computations lay before me\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I could no longer doubt the mathematical consistency and coherence of the kind of quantum mechanics to which my calculations pointed. At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought that I now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature had so generously spread out before me. I was far too excited to sleep, and so, as a new day dawned, I made for the southern tip of the island, where I had been longing to climb a rock jutting out into the sea. I now did so without too much trouble, and waited for the sun to rise.\x{201d}",

            "Even Einstein, <<around 1938|9:1>>, is reported to have said of the assumption Hermann identified: \x{201c}Why should we believe in that?\x{201d} Einstein, of course, was increasingly being thought of as a curmudgeonly old man who was holding on to his precious ideas of realism, locality, and at times even determinism. Though, to be fair to Einstein, the lack of determinism did not overly bother him. The overused quote of his in popular culture, that \x{201c}God does not play dice with the world,\x{201d} misrepresents his stand on the issue. He certainly did, during the early 1920s, express concerns about the indeterminate nature of the quantum world, saying that he found the idea \x{201c}intolerable,\x{201d} and if it were true, he \x{201c}would rather be a cobbler, or even an employee of a gaming house, than a physicist.\x{201d} But as quantum mechanics matured, Einstein backed off from his disavowal of indeterminism. It was an aspect of reality he was willing to accept. Not so with anti-realism and nonlocality. In any case, it was easy for the younger crowd to be dismissive of Einstein\x{2019}s views as he grew older.",

When his contract at Princeton wasn\x{2019}t renewed, Bohm knew his days as an academic in the United States were numbered. He moved to Brazil in October 1951, where a coterie of former Princeton graduates got him an academic appointment at the University of S\x{e3}o Paolo, with recommendations from no less than Einstein and Oppenheimer. Bohm was looking forward to collaborating with physicists in Europe, but those hopes were dashed when the US State Department confiscated his passport. Bohm was now officially in exile in Brazil and he would stay there until <<1955|9c:0>>, when he would leave for Israel.",

            'To mimic the predictions of quantum mechanics, GRW has to ensure two things. One, that such spontaneous collapses are extremely rare for individual particles, so that they can remain in superposition of states for any measurable length of time. Two, that for a large collection of particles, say, those that make up a cat, the collapse of the wavefunction is near certain, so that the cat is always found in some macroscopically identifiable state and not in a superposition. In their earliest versions of the theory, GRW showed how to set up the theory so that it could take almost 100 million years for a single particle to collapse, whereas a macroscopic object with <<about 1020|18:0>> particles would collapse almost instantly (a few tens of nanoseconds or less, but estimates vary).',

            "Arndt continued his postdoc phase with Anton Zeilinger, first in Innsbruck, Austria, and then moved with Zeilinger to the University of Vienna, and now runs his own labs on Boltzmanngasse. Among the many experiments Arndt\x{2019}s group is doing, one with particular relevance to questions about the foundations of quantum mechanics has to do with molecular interferometry: doing advanced variants of the double-slit experiment with large molecules and nanoparticles. Zeilinger, in his early days, had been part of a team that demonstrated a double-slit experiment with single neutrons, the most massive particle to be tested in the 1970s. Soon physicists began showing that atoms could be placed in superposition of states and made to interfere. In 1991, J\x{fc}rgen Mlynek and colleagues in Konstanz, Germany, sent helium atoms through two 1-micrometer-wide slits, <<about 8|9:1>> micrometers apart, and saw the atoms interfere. (The history of atom interferometry is rich. Other prominent names include David Pritchard at MIT, who showed in 1983 that atoms could be diffracted at gratings, and Fujio Shimizu at the University of Tokyo, who reported in 1992 a double-slit experiment done with neon atoms.) Since then, it has become a race of sorts, with the attention shifting to molecules, to see who can bell the biggest Schr\x{f6}dinger\x{2019}s cat.",

            "Arndt is quick to point out that despite his tendency to think in Bohmian terms for matter waves, he\x{2019}s a non-realist when it comes to the dynamics of the internal states of molecules, in that these states don\x{2019}t exist until we measure them. Besides, what he\x{2019}s really after is to discern if there is a quantum-classical boundary that\x{2019}s predicted either by Penrose\x{2019}s gravitational collapse theory or by any of the many flavors of the GRW collapse theory. Neither prediction, unfortunately, is within easy reach. Arndt recalled the early days of the GRW theory, when it was thought that molecular interferometers would see collapse and hence find the boundary between the quantum and the classical, with molecules at <<about 109|9c:0>>, or a billion, atomic mass units. Experimentalists could dream of testing the theory. Subsequently, some theorists revised the target to <<about 1016|18:0>> atomic mass units, making the theory extremely difficult to falsify. \x{201c}Theorists have a simple life,\x{201d} said Arndt. \x{201c}They can change their parameters.\x{201d}",

By <<1955|9u>>, he had identified what he thought of as the key issue with the quantum formalism then in vogue. If the state of a quantum system at any instant is given by the wavefunction psi, \x{3c8}, then Everett pointed out that there are two processes that govern it. First, the wavefunction evolves in time according to Schr\x{f6}dinger\x{2019}s equation, a completely deterministic process. But upon measurement, the wavefunction abruptly changes to a definite state with some probability that can be calculated\x{2014}a so-called probabilistic jump. Everett found this untenable.",
