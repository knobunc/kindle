 insight was prophetic. In the spring of 1925, suffering from severe hay
 fever, he decamped to Helgoland in the North Sea, a rocky island devoid
 of pollen. There, between long walks and contemplating Goethe\x{2019}s West-\x{f6}stlicher Divan, he developed the early mathematics that would become the basis for modern quantum theory. Heisenberg recalled later, \x{201c}It
 was <<almost three o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> before the final result of my 
computations lay before me\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I could no longer doubt the 
mathematical consistency and coherence of the kind of quantum mechanics 
to which my calculations pointed. At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had 
the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking
 at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought
 that I now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature 
had so generously spread out before me. I was far too excited to sleep, 
and so, as a new day dawned, I made for the southern tip of the island, 
where I had been longing to climb a rock jutting out into the sea. I now
 did so without too much trouble, and waited for the sun to rise.\x{201d}",

 before he could do that, his career took a turn for the worse. When his
 contract at Princeton wasn\x{2019}t renewed, Bohm knew his days as an academic
 in the United States were numbered. He moved to Brazil in October 1951,
 where a coterie of former Princeton graduates got him an academic 
appointment at the University of S\x{e3}o Paolo, with recommendations from no
 less than Einstein and Oppenheimer. Bohm was looking forward to 
collaborating with physicists in Europe, but those hopes were dashed

of quantum mechanics, GRW has to ensure two things. One, that such 
spontaneous collapses are extremely rare for individual particles, so 
that they can remain in superposition of states for any measurable 
length of time. Two, that for a large collection of particles, say, 
those that make up a cat, the collapse of the wavefunction is near 
certain, so that the cat is always found in some macroscopically 
identifiable state and not in a superposition. In their earliest 
versions of the theory, GRW showed how to set up the theory so that it 
could take almost 100 million years for a single particle to collapse, 
whereas a macroscopic object with <<about 1020|18:0>> particles would collapse almost instantly (a few tens of nanoseconds or less, but estimates vary).',

            "Arndt continued his postdoc phase with Anton Zeilinger, first in
 Innsbruck, Austria, and then moved with Zeilinger to the University of 
Vienna, and now runs his own labs on Boltzmanngasse. Among the many 
experiments Arndt\x{2019}s group is doing,
 one with particular relevance to questions about the foundations of 
quantum mechanics has to do with molecular interferometry: doing 
advanced variants of the double-slit experiment with large molecules and
 nanoparticles. Zeilinger, in his early days, had been part of a team 
that demonstrated a double-slit experiment with single neutrons, the 
most massive particle to be tested in the 1970s. Soon physicists began 
showing that atoms could be placed in superposition of states and made 
to interfere. In 1991, J\x{fc}rgen 
Mlynek and colleagues in Konstanz, Germany, sent helium atoms through 
two 1-micrometer-wide slits, <<about 8|9:1>> micrometers apart, and saw the 
atoms interfere. (The history of atom interferometry is rich. Other 
prominent names include David Pritchard at MIT, who showed in 1983 that atoms could be diffracted at gratings, and Fujio Shimizu at the University of Tokyo, who reported in 1992 a
 double-slit experiment done with neon atoms.) Since then, it has become
 a race of sorts, with the attention shifting to molecules, to see who 
can bell the biggest Schr\x{f6}dinger\x{2019}s cat.",

            "Arndt
 is quick to point out that despite his tendency to think in Bohmian 
terms for matter waves, he\x{2019}s a non-realist when it comes to the dynamics
 of the internal states of molecules, in that these states don\x{2019}t exist 
until we measure them. Besides, what he\x{2019}s really after is to discern if 
there is a quantum-classical boundary that\x{2019}s predicted either by 
Penrose\x{2019}s gravitational collapse theory or by any of the many flavors of
 the GRW collapse theory. Neither prediction, unfortunately, is within 
easy reach. Arndt recalled the early days of the GRW theory, when it was
 thought that molecular interferometers would see collapse and hence 
find the boundary between the quantum and the classical, with molecules 
at <<about 109|9c:0>>, or a billion, atomic mass units. 
Experimentalists could dream of testing the theory. Subsequently, some 
theorists revised the target to <<about 1016|18:0>> 
atomic mass units, making the theory extremely difficult to falsify.

there are two processes that govern it. First, the wavefunction evolves

 wavefunction abruptly changes to a definite state with some probability
