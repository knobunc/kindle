 insight was prophetic. In the spring of 1925, suffering from severe hay
 fever, he decamped to Helgoland in the North Sea, a rocky island devoid
 of pollen. There, between long walks and contemplating Goethe\x{2019}s West-\x{f6}stlicher Divan, he developed the early mathematics that would become the basis for modern quantum theory. Heisenberg recalled later, \x{201c}It
 was <<almost three o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> before the final result of my 
computations lay before me\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I could no longer doubt the 
mathematical consistency and coherence of the kind of quantum mechanics 
to which my calculations pointed. At first, I was deeply alarmed. I had 
the feeling that, through the surface of atomic phenomena, I was looking
 at a strangely beautiful interior, and felt almost giddy at the thought
 that I now had to probe this wealth of mathematical structures nature 
had so generously spread out before me. I was far too excited to sleep, 
and so, as a new day dawned, I made for the southern tip of the island, 
where I had been longing to climb a rock jutting out into the sea. I now
 did so without too much trouble, and waited for the sun to rise.\x{201d}",

diameter (human hair, for comparison, is <<about 100|18:0>> microns thick). They 
charged the wire by applying a voltage to it, and placed the wire in the
 path of a beam of electrons. The electrons, deflected by the wire\x{2019}s

 a source of single photons aimed at a beam splitter. The photon will go
 toward either detector D1 or D2. But unlike the setup we saw earlier 
when building up to a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the arm lengths in 
this setup are unequal, with D2 being much, much farther away than D1, 
so that it takes, say, 1 second to reach D1 but 5 seconds to reach D2. 
Quantum mechanics says that, until there\x{2019}s a measurement at either D1 or
 D2, the wavefunction of the photon will be in a superposition of having
 taken both paths. If one second later the photon is detected at D1, the
 wavefunction collapses; the photon is now at D1 and not at D2. Now 
consider the case when the photon is detected at D2. The detector will 
click after 5 seconds. But here\x{2019}s the intriguing aspect of this 
experiment: <<after 1|9:0>> second, if D1 hasn\x{2019}t clicked, we know that the photon has gone the other way and is headed to D2. The negative result (the nondetection at D1 after 1 second) is already giving us information that the photon will
 reach D2: the wavefunction has potentially already collapsed, even

 Innsbruck, Austria, and then moved with Zeilinger to the University of 
Vienna, and now runs his own labs on Boltzmanngasse. Among the many 
experiments Arndt\x{2019}s group is doing,
 one with particular relevance to questions about the foundations of 
quantum mechanics has to do with molecular interferometry: doing 
advanced variants of the double-slit experiment with large molecules and
 nanoparticles. Zeilinger, in his early days, had been part of a team 
that demonstrated a double-slit experiment with single neutrons, the 
most massive particle to be tested in the 1970s. Soon physicists began 
showing that atoms could be placed in superposition of states and made 
to interfere. In 1991, J\x{fc}rgen 
Mlynek and colleagues in Konstanz, Germany, sent helium atoms through 
two 1-micrometer-wide slits, <<about 8|9:1>> micrometers apart, and saw the 
atoms interfere. (The history of atom interferometry is rich. Other 
prominent names include David Pritchard at MIT, who showed in 1983 that atoms could be diffracted at gratings, and Fujio Shimizu at the University of Tokyo, who reported in 1992 a
 double-slit experiment done with neon atoms.) Since then, it has become

find the boundary between the quantum and the classical, with molecules 
at <<about 109|9c:0>>, or a billion, atomic mass units. 
Experimentalists could dream of testing the theory. Subsequently, some

about something quite dramatic: we don\x{2019}t know which branch of the 
wavefunction we are on. Let\x{2019}s say you did one run of the experiment,

ensues, and you\x{2019}ll soon enough find yourself in a branch of the universe

 because decoherence is very, very fast, on microscopic time scales,

period of time in which the branching has occurred and there are two 
copies of you, but those two copies are exactly the same, because they

 there are two copies of you, for a very tiny time period, those two 
copies are ignorant about the branching, and it\x{2019}s this ignorance that 
explains the outcomes of experiments in terms of probabilities. Carroll 
and Sebens have shown that in that brief moment, post-decoherence, if 
you were to assign probabilities to D1 clicking or D2 clicking, under 
certain simple assumptions, you\x{2019}d end up with |a|2 and |b|2,
