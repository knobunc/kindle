            "The explanation is simply that Anderson, being of Scandinavian ancestry and well-read in languages like Old Norse, drew upon many of the same sources that Tolkien himself used-such as the Icelandic sagas. As for Durin and Dvalin, Anderson probably got them from the same place Tolkien did, the famous \x{201c}Catalogue of Dwarves\x{201d} in the first book of The Elder Edda (Voluspo, stanzas <<10-15|5a:0>>, et seq.). At any rate, you will find in this novel many of the same imaginative elements that appear in The Lord of the Rings: trolls, dwarves, elves, dragons, and the \x{201c}broken sword\x{201d} itself, an old literary motif Tolkien revived in his handling of Aragorn\x{2019}s great sword, Anduril.",

By <<midnight|13>> they were in mountain country where the moonlight cast thin silver and thick shadows on crags, cliffs, and the far green shimmer of glaciers. The elves rode along a narrow trail, harness chiming, lances high, plumes and capes streaming. Hoofbeats rang on the stones and echoed back through the wilderness night.',

Like the gale itself they went, like flying snow and freezing spindrift white under the moon, waves seething in their wake, a long easy bounding over the noisy waters. Swiftest of all in Faerie, afoot or on horse or in hull, were the elves, and ere <<midnight|13>> Finnmark\x{2019}s cliffs loomed in sight.",

A wolf-toothed wind howled over the breakers that dashed themselves to noisy death on the strand rocks. Soon after darkfall there came for a while the far-off sound of hoofs at gallop through the sky, outrunning the wind, and a baying and yelping. Skafloc himself shivered. The Wild Hunt was out.',
