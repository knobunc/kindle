Tom did not see Bernard at the railway station. He looked on platforms and in the buffet. He then walked back toward the river and the center of town, watching for Bernard, for a man in a limp beige raincoat carrying a duffelbag. <<Around 2 p.m.|5>> Tom took a taxi to the airport, in case Bernard was flying to Frankfurt. No luck there, either.',

Bernard leaned on his forearms, gazing down. His duffelbag was at his feet. Tom had not started across the bridge. He had seen Bernard from quite a distance. Was he thinking about jumping in? Bernard\x{2019}s hair lifted and fell over his forehead with the wind. He was going to kill himself, Tom realized. Maybe not this instant. Maybe he would walk around and come back in an hour, in two hours. Maybe this evening. Two women, walking past Bernard, glanced at him with a brief curiosity. When the women had gone by, Tom walked toward Bernard, neither fast nor slowly. Below, the river foamed quickly over the rocks that bordered its banks. Tom had never seen a boat on the river, that he could recall. The Salzach was perhaps rather shallow. Tom, at a distance of four yards, was ready to say Bernard\x{2019}s name, when Bernard turned his head to the left and saw him.",

Tom caught a bus going up the river on the old side of the town, in the direction of Mariaplain and Bergheim, two towns on the way which he had looked up.
