At its very end the thatched roofs of the Forest House and its outbuildings showed pale against the deep green of the Sacred Grove.',

Despite some recent tutoring in oratory, he felt he must have bored them, but at the end of his speech, they voted him a perfunctory round of applause and - as Licinius had foreseen - confirmed that for the next year a reasonable percentage of the tax money they had collected might be retained in Britain.
