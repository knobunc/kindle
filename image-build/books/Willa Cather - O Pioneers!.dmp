            "ONE JANUARY DAY, THIRTY years ago, the little town of Hanover, anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland, was trying not to be blown away. A mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie, under a gray sky. The dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight, and others as if they were straying off by themselves, headed straight for the open plain. None of them had any appearance of permanence, and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them. The main street was a deeply rutted road, now frozen hard, which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain \x{201c}elevator\x{201d} at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end. On either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings; the general merchandise stores, the two banks, the drug store, the feed store, the saloon, the post-office. The board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow, but at <<two o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>> the shopkeepers, having come back from dinner, were keeping well behind their frosty windows. The children were all in school, and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough-looking countrymen in coarse overcoats, with their long caps pulled down to their noses. Some of them had brought their wives to town, and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another. At the hitch-bars along the street a few heavy work-horses, harnessed to farm wagons, shivered under their blankets. About the station everything was quiet, for there would not be another train in until night.",

            "Although it was only <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>, the winter day was fading. The road led southwest, toward the streak of pale, watery light that glimmered in the leaden sky. The light fell upon the two sad young faces that were turned mutely toward it: upon the eyes of the girl, who seemed to be looking with such anguished perplexity into the future; upon the sombre eyes of the boy, who seemed already to be looking into the past. The little town behind them had vanished as if it had never been, had fallen behind the swell of the prairie, and the stern frozen country received them into its bosom. The homesteads were few and far apart; here and there a windmill gaunt against the sky, a sod house crouching in a hollow. But the great fact was the land itself, which seemed to overwhelm the little beginnings of human society that struggled in its sombre wastes. It was from facing this vast hardness that the boy\x{2019}s mouth had become so bitter; because he felt that men were too weak to make any mark here, that the land wanted to be let alone, to preserve its own fierce strength, its peculiar, savage kind of beauty, its uninterrupted mournfulness.",

He slipped into his empty place at his sister\x{2019}s right. The three pretty young Swedish girls who did Alexandra\x{2019}s housework were cutting pies, refilling coffee-cups, placing platters of bread and meat and potatoes upon the red tablecloth, and continually getting in each other\x{2019}s way between the table and the stove. To be sure they always wasted a good deal of time getting in each other\x{2019}s way and giggling at each other\x{2019}s mistakes. But, as Alexandra had pointedly told her sisters-in-law, it was to hear them giggle that she kept three young things in her kitchen; the work she could do herself, if it were necessary. These girls, with their long letters from home, their finery, and their love-affairs, afforded her a great deal of entertainment, and they were company for her when Emil was away at school.",

Lou now looks the older of the two; his face is thin and shrewd and wrinkled about the eyes, while Oscar\x{2019}s is thick and dull. For all his dullness, however, Oscar makes more money than his brother, which adds to Lou\x{2019}s sharpness and uneasiness and tempts him to make a show. The trouble with Lou is that he is tricky, and his neighbors have found out that, as Ivar says, he has not a fox\x{2019}s face for nothing.

There were days, too, which she and Emil had spent together, upon which she loved to look back. There had been such a day when they were down on the river in the dry year, looking over the land. They had made an early start one morning and had driven a long way before <<noon|13>>. When Emil said he was hungry, they drew back from the road, gave Brigham his oats among the bushes, and climbed up to the top of a grassy bluff to eat their lunch under the shade of some little elm trees. The river was clear there, and shallow, since there had been no rain, and it ran in ripples over the sparkling sand. Under the overhanging willows of the opposite bank there was an inlet where the water was deeper and flowed so slowly that it seemed to sleep in the sun. In this little bay a single wild duck was swimming and diving and preening her feathers, disporting herself very happily in the flickering light and shade. They sat for a long time, watching the solitary bird take its pleasure. No living thing  had ever seemed to Alexandra as beautiful as that wild duck. Emil must have felt about it as she did, for afterward, when they were at home, he used sometimes to say, \x{201c}Sister, you know our duck down there\x{2014}\x{201d} Alexandra remembered that day as one of the happiest in her life. Years afterward she thought of the duck as still there, swimming and diving all by herself in the sunlight, a kind of enchanted bird that did not know age or change.",

The auction was the liveliest part of the entertainment, for the French boys always lost their heads when they began to bid, satisfied that their extravagance was in a good cause. After all the pincushions and sofa pillows and embroidered slippers were sold, Emil precipitated a panic by taking out one of his turquoise shirt studs, which every one had been admiring, and handing it to the auctioneer. All the French girls clamored for it, and their sweethearts bid against each other recklessly.

Then he went through the house again, upstairs and down, with no better result. He sat down on the bottom step of the box stairway and tried to get his wits together. In that unnatural quiet there was no sound but his own heavy breathing. Suddenly an owl began to hoot out in the fields. Frank lifted his head.

The old man wore his buffalo-skin coat, and occasionally stopped to warm his fingers at the lantern. Suddenly a woman burst into the shed, as if she had been blown in, accompanied by a shower of rain-drops. It was Signa, wrapped in a man\x{2019}s overcoat and wearing a pair of boots over her shoes. In time of trouble Signa had come back to stay with her mistress, for she was the only one of the maids from whom Alexandra would accept much personal service. It was three months now since the news of the terrible thing that had happened in Frank Shabata\x{2019}s orchard had first run like a fire over the Divide. Signa and Nelse were staying on with Alexandra until winter.",

            "Movies had scarcely been invented in 1913, when Willa Cather wrote O Pioneers! Certainly on the Divide of the Nebraska wild lands, movies existed only in their most embryonic form: pictures painted on thin sheets of glass and projected by a \x{201c}magic lantern\x{201d} on the wall. And yet the opening scene of O Pioneers!, by far the novel\x{2019}s strongest chapter, is completely cinematic in its execution and intent, exemplary of the novel\x{2019}s gorgeous kind of slowed-down realism. The movie opens with a long shot of the windswept town of Hanover, Nebraska. The camera holds on this \x{201c}cluster of low drab buildings.\x{201d} Snow flies against the grayness of the sky and prairie, as this tiny town \x{201c}anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland\x{201d} holds itself against the elements, \x{201c}trying not to be blown away.\x{201d} And then the camera moves\x{2014}as slowly and deliberately as the book\x{2019}s protagonist, Alexandra Bergson\x{2014}in a tracking shot across the town. We see the frozen, rutted road that is the town\x{2019}s main street; the \x{201c}squat red railway station,\x{201d} the town\x{2019}s few businesses, which cater mostly to the outlying farms: a drugstore, a feed store, two general stores, a bar, and a post office. It\x{2019}s <<2 p.m.|5>>, and all the storekeepers are back from lunch, but except for a few farmers and their wives and horses, shivering under blankets, hardly anyone is around.",
