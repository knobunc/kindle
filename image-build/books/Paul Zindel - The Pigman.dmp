That\x{2019}s where all the famous Mastersons are buried, you know. It\x{2019}s a fantastic place because they have acres and acres all for their own tomb, and it\x{2019}s fenced in with a private road which they only open up when one of the Mastersons dies. But there is a hole in the fence at one place in the woods, and that\x{2019}s where all the kids go through.",
