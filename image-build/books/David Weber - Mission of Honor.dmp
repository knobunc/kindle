"Given the admiral\'s dramatic <<midnight|13>> arrival, I\'m sure whatever she has to say will be important enough for all of us to discuss eventually, but tell them I want to get my own toes wet first."',

And she was also the non-Dresdener who came closest to sharing Helga\'s attitudes where aristocrats and oligarchs were concerned. Not surprisingly, given the fact that she\'d been born on Gryphon and raised by a Gryphon highlander who\'d proceeded to take up with the closest thing to a rabble-rousing anarchist the Manticoran peerage had ever produced when Helen was barely thirteen years old.',

The SLN's going to pound their miserable little star nation into wreckage, and that's going to have enormous consequences where the wormholes are concerned.

            "She drew a deep breath and ran her mind over her own order of battle. Fourteen Nike-class battlecruisers, eight Saganami-C-class heavy cruisers, four Hydra-class CLACs, five Roland-class destroyers, and a handful of obsolescent starships like Denton's Reprise and Victoria Saunders' Hercules. Of course, she also had right on four hundred LACs, but they'd have to go deep into the Sollies' weapons envelope to engage. So what it really came down to was her twenty-seven hyper-capable warships\x{2014}the Hydras had no business at all in ship-to-ship combat\x{2014}against Crandall's hundred and forty. She was outnumbered by better than five-to-one in hulls, and despite the fact that Manticoran ship types were bigger and more powerful on a class-for-class basis, the tonnage differential was <<almost thirteen-to-one|10>>. Of course, if she counted the LACs, she had another twelve million or so tons, but even that only brought it down to <<around ten-to-one|10>>. And as far as anyone in Meyers knew, she had only the ships she'd taken to New Tuscany, without Oversteegen's eight Nikes.",

Even if every one of them was a superdreadnought, Crandall\'s force still outnumbered the enemy by a margin of <<almost seven-to-one|10>>, and even if every single story about Manticoran capabilities proved accurate, those were still crushing odds. And if, as seemed much more likely, they were simply more of those outsized battlecruisers, Bautista\'s confident expectation of a rapid, devastating victory was amply justified.',

It sliced across both shipyards in a searing eyeblink, and if it was less powerful than a Shrike\'s weapon, its power was more than ample for the minor task of cutting an unarmored destroyer, unprotected by impeller wedge or sidewalls, cleanly in half.',
