Chadwick\x{2019}s achievement in reaching this mark as early as <<two in the afternoon|5>> was politely clapped by the handful then present.

The most support came for O\x{2019}Flaherty. His height and red hair made him an easy figure to pick out, and it was believed that he was the only man left capable of offering Chadwick a seri-ous challenge. Waves of chanting and cheering lifted the Irishman to extraordinary efforts. For almost two hours he was \x{2018}mixing\x{2019}\x{2014}alternately walking and trotting\x{2014}making the others\x{2019} efforts seem puny. Williams, the Half-breed, who had kept pace with O\x{2019}Flaherty until <<noon|13>>, was forced by blistering to walk on the sides of his boots, and the odds against him doubled between nine and ten. The curiosity of the event, Mostyn-Smith, betrayed no ill-effects from his lack of any sustained sleep since the start. Those who remembered his unenterprising pace on the first day now declared that he had not slowed in the least since then.
