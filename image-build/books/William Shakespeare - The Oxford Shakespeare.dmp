            "Shakespeare\x{2019}s background was commonplace. His father, John, was a glover and wool-dealer in the small Midlands market-town of Stratford-upon-Avon who had married Mary Arden, daughter of a prosperous farmer, in or <<about 1557|18:0>>. During Shakespeare\x{2019}s childhood his father played a prominent part in local affairs, becoming bailiff (mayor) and justice of the peace in 1568; later his fortunes declined. Of his eight children, four sons and one daughter survived childhood. William, his third child and eldest son, was baptized in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, on 26 April 1564; his birthday is traditionally celebrated on 23 April\x{2014}St. George\x{2019}s Day. The only other member of his family to take up the theatre as a profession was his youngest brother, Edmund, born sixteen years after William. He became an actor and died at the age of twenty-seven: on the last day of 1607 the sexton of St. Saviour\x{2018}s, Southwark, noted \x{2018}Edmund Shakspeare A player Buried in y Church w a forenoone knell of y great bell, xxs.\x{2019} The high cost of the funeral suggests that it may have been paid for by his prosperous brother.",

            "John Shakespeare\x{2019}s position in Stratford-upon-Avon would have brought certain privileges to his family. When young William was four years old he could have had the excitement of seeing his father, dressed in furred scarlet robes and wearing the alderman\x{2019}s official thumb-ring, regularly accompanied by two mace-bearing sergeants in buff, presiding at fairs and markets. A little later, he would have begun to attend a \x{2018}petty school\x{2019} to acquire the rudiments of an education that would be continued at the King\x{2019}s New School, an established grammar school with a well-qualified master, assisted by an usher to help with the younger pupils. We have no lists of the school\x{2019}s pupils in Shakespeare\x{2019}s time, but his father\x{2019}s position would have qualified him to attend, and the school offered the kind of education that lies behind the plays and poems. Its boy pupils, aged from about eight to fifteen, endured an arduous routine. Classes began early in the morning: at <<six|9e>>, normally; hours were long, holidays infrequent. Education was centred on Latin; in the upper forms, the speaking of English was forbidden. A scene (4.1) in The Merry Wives of Windsor showing a schoolmaster taking a boy named William through his Latin grammar draws on the officially approved textbook, William Lily\x{2019}s Short Introduction of Grammar, and, no doubt, on Shakespeare\x{2019}s memories of his youth.",

            "In 1604 Shakespeare was lodging in north London with a Huguenot family called Mountjoy; in 1612 he was to testify in a court case relating to a marriage settlement on the daughter of the house. The records of the case provide our only transcript of words actually spoken by Shakespeare; they are not characterful. In 1605 Shakespeare invested \x{a3}440 in the Stratford tithes, which brought him in \x{a3}60 a year; in June 1607 his elder daughter, Susanna, married a distinguished physician, John Hall, in Stratford, and there his only grandchild, their daughter Elizabeth, was baptized the following February. In 1609 his mother died there, and from <<about 1610|18:0>> his increasing involvement with Stratford along with the reduction in his dramatic output suggests that he was withdrawing from his London responsibilities and spending more time at New Place. Perhaps he was deliberately devoting himself to his family\x{2019}s business interests; he was only forty-six years old: an age at which a healthy man was no more likely to retire then than now. If he was ill, he was not totally disabled, as he was in London in 1612 for the Mountjoy lawsuit. In March 1613 he bought a house in the Blackfriars area of London for \x{a3}140: he is not known to have lived in it. Also in 1613 the last of his three brothers died. In late 1614 and 1615 he was involved in disputes about the enclosure of the land whose tithes he owned. In February 1616 his second daughter, Judith, married Thomas Quiney, causing William to make alterations to the draft of his will, which he signed on 25 March. His widow was entitled by law and local custom to part of his estate; he left most of the remainder to his elder daughter, Susanna, and her husband. He died on 23 April, and was buried two days later in a prominent position in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church. A monument was commissioned, presumably by members of his family, and was in position by 1623.

            "In August 1608 the King\x{2019}s Men took up the lease of the smaller, \x{2018}private\x{2019} indoor theatre, the Blackfriars; again, Shakespeare was one of the syndicate of owners. The company took possession in 1609. The Blackfriars served as a winter home; in better weather, performances continued to be given at the Globe. By now, Shakespeare was at a late stage in his career. Perhaps he realized it; he seems to have been willing to share his responsibilities as the company\x{2019}s resident dramatist with younger writers. Timon of Athens, tentatively dated to early 1606, seems on internal evidence to be partly the work of Thomas Middleton (1580-1627). Another collaborative play, very successful in its time, was Pericles (c. 1607-8), in which Shakespeare probably worked with George Wilkins, an unscrupulous character who gave up his brief career as a writer in favour of a longer one as a tavern (or brothel) keeper. But Shakespeare\x{2019}s most fruitful collaboration was with John Fletcher, his junior by fifteen years. Fletcher was collaborating with Francis Beaumont on plays for the King\x{2019}s Men by <<about 1608|18:0>>. Beaumont stopped writing plays when he married, in <<about 1613|18:0>>, and it is at this time that Fletcher began to collaborate with Shakespeare. A lost play, Cardenio, acted by the King\x{2019}s Men some time before 20May 1613, was plausibly ascribed to Shakespeare and Fletcher in a document of 1653; All is True (Henry VIII), first acted about June 1613, is generally agreed on stylistic evidence to be another fruit of the same partnership; and The Two Noble Kinsmen, also dated 1613, which seems to be the last play in which Shakespeare had a hand, was ascribed to the pair on its publication in 1634. One of Shakespeare\x{2019}s last professional tasks was the minor one of devising an impress\x{2014}which has not survived\x{2014}for the Earl of Rutland to bear at a tournament held on 24 March 1613 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the King\x{2019}s accession. An impresa was a paper or pasteboard shield painted with an emblematic device and motto which would be carried and interpreted for a knight by his squire; such a ceremony is portrayed in Pericles (Sc. 6). Shakespeare received forty-four shillings for his share in the work; Richard Burbage was paid the same sum \x{2018}for painting and making it\x{2019}.",

They were led by the sharers: eight in the Lord Chamberlain\x{2019}s Men at first, <<twelve|5g:0>> by the end of Shakespeare\x{2019}s career. Collectively they owned the joint stock of play scripts, costumes, and properties; they shared both expenses and profits. All were working members of the company. Exceptionally, the sharers of Shakespeare\x{2019}s company owned the Globe theatre itself; more commonly, actors rented theatres from financial speculators such as Philip Henslowe, financier of the Admiral\x{2019}s Men. Subordinate to the sharers were the \x{2018}hired men\x{2019}\x{2014}lesser actors along with prompters (\x{2018}bookholders\x{2019}), stagekeepers, wardrobe keepers (\x{2018}tiremen\x{2019}), musicians, and money-collectors (\x{2018}gatherers\x{2019}). Even those not employed principally as actors might swell a scene at need. The hired men were paid by the week. Companies would need scribes to copy out actors\x{2019} parts and to make fair copies from the playwrights\x{2019} foul papers (working manuscripts), but they seem mainly to have been employed part-time. The other important group of company members were the apprentices. These were boys or youths each serving a formal term of apprenticeship to one of the sharers.

Private playhouses were smaller than the public ones\x{2014}the Blackfriars held <<about 600|18:0>> spectators\x{2014}and admission prices were much higher\x{2014}a minimum of sixpence at the Blackfriars against one penny at the Globe.

            "It seems to have been under the influence of private-theatre practice that, from <<about 1609|18:0>> onwards, performances of plays customarily marked the conventional five-act structure by a pause, graced with music, after each act. The need to trim the candles was a practical reason for introducing act breaks. Previously, though dramatists often showed awareness of five-act structure (as Shakespeare conspicuously does in Henry V, with a Chorus before each act), public performances seem to have been continuous, making the scene the main structural unit. None of the editions of Shakespeare\x{2019}s plays printed in his lifetime (which do not include any written <<after 1609|18:0>>) marks either act or scene divisions. The innovation of act-pauses threw more emphasis on the act as a unit, and made it possible for dramatists to relax their observance of what has come to be known as \x{2018}the law of re-entry\x{2019}, according to which a character who had left the stage at the end of one scene would not normally make an immediate reappearance at the beginning of the next. Thus, if Shakespeare had been writing The Tempest before <<1609|9c:0>>, it is unlikely that Prospero and Ariel, having left the stage at the end of Act 4, would have instantly reappeared at the start of Act 5. We attempt to reflect this feature of Shakespeare\x{2019}s dramaturgy by making no special distinction between scene-breaks and act-breaks except in those later plays in which Shakespeare seems to have observed the new convention (and in Titus Andronicus, Measure for Measure, and Macbeth, since the texts of these plays apparently reflect theatre practice after they were first written, and in The Comedy of Errors, a neo-classically structured play in which the act-divisions appear to be authoritative, and to represent a private performance).",

            "In 1616, the year of Shakespeare\x{2019}s death, Ben Jonson published his own collected plays in a handsome Folio. It was the first time that an English writer for the popular stage had been so honoured (or had so honoured himself), and it established a precedent by which Shakespeare\x{2019}s fellows could commemorate their colleague and friend. Principal responsibility for this ambitious enterprise was undertaken by John Heminges and Henry Condell, both long-established actors with Shakespeare\x{2019}s company; latterly, Heminges had been its business manager. They, along with Richard Burbage, had been the colleagues whom Shakespeare remembered in his will: he left each of them 26s. 8d. to buy a mourning ring. Although the Folio did not appear until <<1623|9c:0>>, they may have started planning it soon after\x{2014}or even before\x{2014}Shakespeare died: big books take a long time to prepare. And they undertook their task with serious care. Most importantly, they printed eighteen plays that had not so far appeared in print, and which might otherwise have vanished. Their decision not to include Edward III suggests at least that they did not believe Shakespeare to have written all of it. They omitted (so far as we can tell) only Pericles, Cardenio (now vanished), The Two Noble Kinsmen\x{2014}perhaps because these three were collaborative\x{2014}and the mysterious Love\x{2019}s Labour\x{2019}s Won (see p. 337). And they went to considerable pains to provide good texts. They had no previous experience as editors; they may have had help from others (including Ben Jonson, who wrote commendatory verses for the Folio): anyhow, although printers find it easier to set from print than from manuscript, they were not content simply to reprint quartos whenever they were available. In fact they seem to have made a conscious effort to identify and to avoid making use of the quartos now recognized as unauthoritative. In their introductory epistle addressed \x{2018}To the Great Variety of Readers\x{2019} they declare that the public has been \x{2018}abused with divers stolen and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of injurious impostors\x{2019}.

            "Shakespeare was writing in the middle of a period of English linguistic history called Early Modern English, which runs from <<around 1500|18:0>> to <<around 1750|18:0>>. It was an age when the language was beginning to settle down after a turbulent few centuries when its structure radically altered from its Anglo-Saxon character. Old English (used until the twelfth century) is so different from Modern English that it has to be approached as we would a foreign language. Middle English (used until the fifteenth century) is very much more familiar to modern eyes and ears, but we still feel that a considerable linguistic distance separates us from those who wrote in it - Chaucer and his contemporaries. During the fifteenth century, a huge amount of change affected English pronunciation, spelling, grammar, and vocabulary, so that Shakespeare would have found Chaucer almost as difficult to read as we do. But between Jacobethan times and today the changes have been very limited. Although we must not underestimate the problems posed by such words as buff jerkin, finical, and thou, we must not exaggerate them either. Most of Early Modern English is the same as Modern English. The evidence lies in the fact that there are many lines of Shakespeare where we feel little or no linguistic distance at all:BRUTUS ... If there be any in this assembly, any dear
 friend of Caesar\x{2019}s, to him I say that Brutus\x{2019} love to
 Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend
 demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my
 answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
 Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living,
 and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to
 live all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for
 him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was
 valiant, I honour him. But as he was ambitious, I

To him \x{2018}twas none\x{2014}the pattern of all wit, 
Art without art unparalleled as yet. 
Next, nature only helped him, for look thorough 
This whole book, thou shalt find he doth not borrow 
One phrase from Greeks, nor Latins imitate, 
Nor once from vulgar languages translate, 
Nor plagiary-like from others glean, 
Nor begs he from each witty friend a scene 
To piece his acts with. All that he doth write 
Is pure his own\x{2014}plot, language exquisite\x{2014}
But O! what praise more powerful can we give 
The dead than that by him the King\x{2019}s men live, 
His players, which should they but have shared the fate, 
All else expired within the short term\x{2019}s date, 
How could the Globe have prospered, since through want 
Of change the plays and poems had grown scant. 
But, happy verse, thou shalt be sung and heard 
When hungry quills shall be such honour barred. 
Then vanish, upstart writers to each stage, 
You needy poetasters of this age; 
Where Shakespeare lived or spake, vermin, forbear; 
Lest with your froth you spot them, come not near. 
But if you needs must write, if poverty 
So pinch that otherwise you starve and die, 
On God\x{2019}s name may the Bull or Cockpit have 
Your lame blank verse, to keep you from the grave, 
Or let new Fortune\x{2019}s younger brethren see 
What they can pick from your lean industry. 
I do not wonder, when you offer at 
Blackfriars, that you suffer; \x{2018}tis the fate 
Of richer veins, prime judgements that have fared 
The worse with this deceased man compared. 
So have I seen, when Caesar would appear, 
And on the stage at half-sword parley were 
Brutus and Cassius; O, how the audience 
Were ravished, with what wonder they went thence, 
When some new day they would not brook a line 
Of tedious though well-laboured Catiline.

Sejanus too was irksome, they prized more 
Honest Iago, or the jealous Moor. 
And though the Fox and subtle Alchemist, 
Long intermitted, could not quite be missed, 
Though these have shamed all the ancients, and might 
raise 
Their author\x{2019}s merit with a crown of bays, 
Yet these, sometimes, even at a friend\x{2019}s desire 
Acted, have scarce defrayed the seacoal fire 
And doorkeepers; when let but Falstaff come, 
Hal, Poins, the rest, you scarce shall have a room, 
All is so pestered. Let but Beatrice 
And Benedick be seen, lo, in a trice 
The Cockpit galleries, boxes, all are full 
To hear Malvolio, that cross-gartered gull. 
Brief, there is nothing in his wit-fraught book 
Whose sound we would not hear, on whose worth look; 
Like old-coined gold, whose lines in every page 
Shall pass true current to succeeding age. 
But why do I dead Shakespeare\x{2019}s praise recite? 
Some second Shakespeare must of Shakespeare write; 
For me \x{2018}tis needless, since an host of men 
Will pay to clap his praise, to free my pen.

            "The plot of The Taming of the Shrew has three main strands. First comes the Induction showing how a drunken tinker, Christopher Sly, is made to believe himself a lord for whose entertainment a play is to be presented. This resembles an episode in The Arabian Nights, in which Caliph Haroun al Raschid plays a similar trick on Abu Hassan. A Latin version of this story was known in Shakespeare\x{2019}s England; it may also have circulated by word of mouth. Second comes the principal plot of the play performed for Sly, in which the shrewish Katherine is wooed, won, and tamed by the fortune-hunting Petruccio. This is a popular narrative theme; Shakespeare may have known a ballad called \x{2018}A merry jest of a shrewd and curst wife lapped in morel\x{2019}s skin for her good behaviour\x{2019}, printed <<around 1550|18:0>>. The third strand of the play involves Lucentio, Gremio, and Hortensio, all of them suitors for the hand of Katherine\x{2019}s sister, Bianca. This is based on the first English prose comedy, George Gascoigne\x{2019}s Supposes, translated from Ludovico Ariosto\x{2019}s I Suppositi (1509), acted in 1566, and published in 1573. In The Taming of the Shrew as printed in the 1623 Folio Christopher Sly fades out after Act 1, Scene 1, in A Shrew he makes other appearances, and rounds off the play. These episodes may derive from a version of Shakespeare\x{2019}s play different from that preserved in the Folio; we print them as Additional Passages.",

The pound of flesh motif was available also in other versions, one of which, in Alexander Silvayn\x{2019}s The Orator (translated 1596), influenced the climactic scene (4.1) in which Shylock attempts to exact the full penalty of his bond.",

            "Some of the characters\x{2014}Sir John Falstaff, Mistress Quickly, Pistol, Nim, Justice Shallow\x{2014}appear also in I and 2 Henry IV and Henry V, but in spite of a reference to \x{2019}the wild Prince and Poins\x{2019} at 3.2.66-7, this is essentially an Elizabethan comedy, the only one that Shakespeare set firmly in England. The play is full of details that would have been familiar to Elizabethan Londoners, and the language is colloquial and up to date. The plot, however, is made up of conventional situations whose ancestry is literary rather than realistic. There are many analogues to Shakespeare\x{2019}s basic plot situations in medieval and other tales, some in books that he probably or certainly knew. The central story, of Sir John\x{2019}s unsuccessful attempts to seduce Mistress Page and Mistress Ford, and of Master Ford\x{2019}s unfounded jealousy, is in the tradition of the Italian novella, and may have been suggested by Ser Giovanni Fiorentino\x{2019}s II Pecorone (1558). Alongside it Shakespeare places the comical but finally romantic love story of Anne Page, wooed by the foolish but rich Abraham Slender and the irascible French Doctor Caius, but won by the young and handsome Fenton. The play contains a higher proportion of prose to verse than any other play by Shakespeare, and the action is often broadly comic; but it ends, after the <<midnight|13>> scene in Windsor Forest during which Sir John is frightened out of his lechery, in forgiveness and love.",

This play, with its contrasts between court and country, its bucolic as well as its aristocratic characters, its inset songs and poems, its predominantly woodland setting, its conscious artifice and its romantic ending, is the one in which Shakespeare makes most use of the conventions of pastoral literature, though he does not wholly endorse them.",

            "SEVERAL references from 1589 onwards witness the existence of a play about Hamlet, but Francis Meres did not attribute a play with this title to Shakespeare in 1598. The first clear reference to Shakespeare\x{2019}s play is its entry in the Stationers\x{2019} Register on 26 July 1602 as The Revenge of Hamlet Prince [of] Denmark, when it was said to have been \x{2018}lately acted by the Lord Chamberlain his servants\x{2019}. It survives in three versions; their relationship is a matter of dispute on which views about when Shakespeare wrote his play, and in what form, depend. In 1603 appeared an inferior text apparently assembled from actors\x{2019} memories; it has only about 2,200 lines. In the following year, as if to put the record straight, James Roberts (to whom the play had been entered in 1602) published it as \x{2018}newly imprinted and enlarged to almost as much again as it was, according to the true and perfect copy\x{2019}. At about 3,800 lines, this is the longest version. The 1623 Folio offers a still different text, some 230 lines shorter than the 1604 version, differing verbally from that at many points, and including about 70 additional lines. It is our belief that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet <<about 1600|18:0>>, and revised it later; that the 1604 edition was printed from his original papers; that the Folio represents the revised version; and that the 1603 edition represents a very imperfect report of an abridged version of the revision. So our text is based on the Folio; passages present in the 1604 quarto but absent from the Folio are printed as Additional Passages because we believe that, however fine they may be in themselves, Shakespeare decided that the play as a whole would be better without them.",

Saxo, through Belleforest, provided the basic story of a Prince of Denmark committed to revenge his father\x{2019}s murder by his own brother (Claudius) who has married the dead man\x{2019}s widow (Gertrude). As in Shakespeare, Hamlet pretends to be mad, kills his uncle\x{2019}s counsellor (Polonius) while he is eavesdropping, rebukes his mother, is sent to England under the escort of two retainers (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) who bear orders that he be put to death on arrival, finds the letter containing the orders and alters it so that it is the retainers who are executed, returns to Denmark, and kills the King.",

This time he dramatized early events, not much subsequent to those he had written about many years previously in The Rape of Lucrece. Plutarch gave him most of his material, but he also drew on other writings, including William Camden\x{2019}s Remains of a Greater Work Concerning Britain, published in 1605, for Menenius\x{2019} fable of the belly (I.I) Though he needed no source other than Plutarch for the insurrections and corn riots of ancient Rome, similar happenings in England during 1607 and 1608 may have stimulated his interest in the story.

            "THE King\x{2019}s Men acted The Tempest before their patron, James I, at Whitehall on I November 1611. (It was also chosen for performance during the festivities for the marriage of James\x{2019}s daughter, Princess Elizabeth, to the Elector Palatine during the winter of 1612- 13.) Shakespeare\x{2019}s play takes place on a desert island somewhere between Tunis and Naples; he derived some details of it from his reading of travel literature, including accounts of an expedition of nine ships taking five hundred colonists from Plymouth to Virginia, which set sail in May 1609. On 29 July the flagship, the Sea-Adventure, was wrecked by a storm on the coast of the Bermudas. She was presumed lost, but on 23 May 1610 those aboard her arrived safely in Jamestown, Virginia, having found shelter on the island of Bermuda, where they were able to build the pinnaces in which they completed their journey. Accounts of the voyage soon reached England; the last-written that Shakespeare seems to have known is a letter by William Strachey, who was on the Sea-Adventure, dated 15 July 1610; though it was not published until <<1625|9c:0>>, it circulated in manuscript. So it seems clear that Shakespeare wrote The Tempest during the later part of 1610or in 1611. It was first printed in the 1623 Folio, where it is the opening play.",

            "No surviving account of the fire says who wrote the play that caused it. In 1850, James Spedding (prompted by Tennyson) suggested that Shakespeare collaborated on it with John Fletcher (1579-1625). We have external evidence that the two dramatists worked together in or <<around 1613|18:0>> on the lost Cardenio and on The Two Noble Kinsmen. For their collaboration in All is True the evidence is wholly internal, stemming from the initial perception of two distinct verse styles within the play; later, more rigorous examination of evidence provided by both the play\x{2019}s language and its dramatic technique has convinced most scholars of Fletcher\x{2019}s hand in it. The passages most confidently attributed to Shakespeare are Act 1, Scenes 1 and 2; Act 2, Scenes 3 and 4; Act 3, Scene 2 to line 204; and Act 5, Scene 1.",
