            "Slightly slower, of course, because the car is accelerating, so on average it is going faster in the second half second from 10 seconds to 11 seconds. But now we take an even smaller snapshot. What about halving the window of time again:
(<<10.25|5a:0>> \x{d7} <<10.25|5a:0>> \x{2013} 10 \x{d7} 10)/0.25 = 20.25 metres per second.
Hopefully the mathematician in you has spotted the pattern. If I take a window of time which is x seconds, the average speed over this time will be 20 + x metres per second. The speed as I take smaller and smaller windows of time is getting closer and closer to 20 metres per second. So, although to calculate the speed at 10 seconds looks like I have to figure out the calculation 0\x{2044}0, the calculus makes sense of what this should mean.",

            "There are several mechanisms for this decay, each depending on one of the fundamental forces. Each mechanism has a characteristic signature which helps physicists to understand which fundamental force is causing the decay. Again it\x{2019}s energy considerations that control which is the most likely force at work in any particle decay. The strong nuclear force is usually the first to have a go at decaying a particle, and this will generally decay the particle within <<10\x{2013}24|5a:0>> of a second. Next in the hierarchy is the electromagnetic force, which might result in the emission of photons. The weak nuclear force is the most costly in energy terms and so takes longer. A particle that decays via the weak nuclear force is likely to take 10\x{2013}11 seconds before it decays. So by observing the time it takes to decay, scientists can get some indication of which force is at work.",

Tiny cogs inside the watch are driven by a tiny electric motor that in turn is driven by 1-second pulses that have their origin in the oscillations of a tiny quartz crystal. The battery that sits inside the watch sets up a voltage across the crystal that makes it vibrate like a bell with a frequency tuned to 32,768 vibrations a second. This number is chosen for its mathematical properties. It is 2 to the power 15. Digital technology likes powers of 2 because computer circuitry can quickly convert this into a mechanical pulse to drive the cogs every second. Importantly, this frequency is not greatly affected by the surrounding temperature, air pressure or altitude (factors which affect a pendulum, for example). And it is this vibrating, the repetition of motion, that is key to marking the passage of time. But is this sufficient to describe the idea of time?",
