            "The triangle is constructed in such a way that each number is the sum of the two numbers immediately above it. The numbers you get are key to dividing the spoils in any interrupted game of points. For example, if Fermat needs 2 points for a win while Pascal needs 4, then you consult the 2 + 4 = 6th row of the triangle and add the first four numbers together and the last two. This is the proportion in which you should divide the spoils. In this case it\x{2019}s a 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 = <<26 to 1|10a:0>> + 5 = 6 division. So Fermat gets 26\x{2044}32 \x{d7} 64 = \x{a3}52 and Pascal gets 6\x{2044}32 \x{d7} 64 = \x{a3}12. In general, a game where Fermat needs n points to Pascal\x{2019}s m points can be decided by consulting the (n + m)th row of Pascal\x{2019}s triangle.",

Suppose that a car starts from a stationary position. When the stopwatch starts, the driver slams his foot on the accelerator. Suppose that we record that after t seconds the driver has covered t \x{d7} t metres. How fast is the car going after 10 seconds? We get an approximation of the speed by looking at how far the car has travelled in the period from <<10 to 11|10a:0>> seconds. The average speed during this second is (11 \x{d7} 11 \x{2013} 10 \x{d7} 10)/1 = 21 metres per second.",

(<<10.25|5a:0>> \x{d7} <<10.25|5a:0>> \x{2013} 10 \x{d7} 10)/0.25 = <<20.25|5a:0>> metres per second.
Hopefully the mathematician in you has spotted the pattern. If I take a window of time which is x seconds, the average speed over this time will be 20 + x metres per second. The speed as I take smaller and smaller windows of time is getting closer and closer to 20 metres per second. So, although to calculate the speed at 10 seconds looks like I have to figure out the calculation 0\x{2044}0, the calculus makes sense of what this should mean.",

The point to note is that although the distance that the ant needs to travel has increased, it has at least still covered 1\x{2044}100,000 of the distance between the star and Earth, because the stretch has also helped push the ant on a little from its starting position.",

The battery that sits inside the watch sets up a voltage across the crystal that makes it vibrate like a bell with a frequency tuned to 32,768 vibrations a second. This number is chosen for its mathematical properties. It is <<2|9d>> to the power 15. Digital technology likes powers of 2 because computer circuitry can quickly convert this into a mechanical pulse to drive the cogs every second. Importantly, this frequency is not greatly affected by the surrounding temperature, air pressure or altitude (factors which affect a pendulum, for example). And it is this vibrating, the repetition of motion, that is key to marking the passage of time. But is this sufficient to describe the idea of time?",
