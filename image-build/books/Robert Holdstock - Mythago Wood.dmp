She held a spear, and the cold metal blade was against my throat. It was sharpened along the edges, and each time I moved her slightest prod caused the skin on my neck to part. It was a painful encounter and I was not prepared for it to be a fatal one. So I lay there, in the hours <<after midnight|13>>, and listened to her breathing. She seemed slightly nervous.
