            "The party came into being at <<half past seven|10>>. Ariadne Oliver had to admit that her friend was right. Arrivals were punctual. Everything went splendidly. It was well-imagined, well-run and ran like clockwork. There were red and blue lights on the stairs and yellow pumpkins in profusion. The girls and boys arrived holding decorated broomsticks for a competition. After greetings, Rowena Drake announced the programme for the evening. \x{201c}First, judging of the broomstick competition,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}three prizes, first, second and third. Then comes cutting the flour cake. That\x{2019}ll be in the small conservatory. Then bobbing for apples\x{2014}there\x{2019}s a list pinned upon the wall over there of the partners for that event\x{2014}then there\x{2019}ll be dancing. Every time the lights go out you change partners. Then girls to the small study where they\x{2019}ll be given their mirrors. After that, supper, Snapdragon and then prize giving.\x{201d}",

Well, I suppose there were five or six women, some mothers, a schoolteacher, a doctor\x{2019}s wife, or sister, I think, a couple of middle-aged married people, the two boys of sixteen to eighteen, a girl of fifteen, <<two or three of eleven|10>> or <<twelve|20a>>\x{2014}well that sort of thing. <<About twenty-five|9:0>> or thirty in all, perhaps.\x{201d}",

I hear what she can tell me. This afternoon my friend Spence is making an appointment for me to talk with the local inspector at a suitable hour. I should also like a talk with the doctor here. And possibly the headmistress at the school. At <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> I drink tea and eat sausages with my friend Spence and his sister again in their house and we discuss.\x{201d}",

            "It was <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> at Pine Crest. Hercule Poirot put a piece of sausage into his mouth and followed it up with a sip of tea. The tea was strong and to Poirot singularly unpalatable. The sausage, on the other hand, was delicious. Cooked to perfection. He looked with appreciation across the table to where Mrs. McKay presided over the large brown teapot.",
