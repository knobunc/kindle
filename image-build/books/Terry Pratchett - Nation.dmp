It was <<four in the morning|9a>> and the place was coming alive and Captain Samson had never seen the dock in such a bustle. The cargo was flying out of the ship, literally; the cranes strained in their efforts to get the bales out as quickly as possible. The ship stank of the disinfectant already, stank of the stuff. Every man who came on board was so drenched in it that it dribbled out of his boots. But that wasn\x{2019}t enough; some of them had squelched aboard with big, heavy spray cans that spat an acid-pink fog over everything.",
