            "\x{201c}One <<noon|13>> recess, I confronted Aoki. I said I wanted to talk to him alone, away from everybody else. I said I\x{2019}d heard this rumor, and what was the meaning of it? But Aoki could only show his contempt. Like, why was I getting all bent out of shape? Like, if by some fluke I happened to get the best score, why was I being so defensive, and what right did I have to act so uppity, anyway? After all, everyone knew what really happened, right? Then he tried to brush me aside, probably thinking that since he was in good shape and taller than me he had to be stronger, too. That\x{2019}s when I hauled off and punched the jerk in the face. It was pure reflex action. I didn\x{2019}t realize I\x{2019}d slugged him square on the left cheek until a second later when Aoki fell back sideways and hit his head on a wall. With a hard conk. Blood was running out of his nose and onto his white shirt. He lay there, dazed, not knowing what had happened.",

            "WHEN THE ELEPHANT disappeared from our town\x{2019}s elephant house, I read about it in the newspaper. My alarm clock woke me that day, as always, at <<6:13|2>>. I went to the kitchen, made coffee and toast, turned on the radio, spread the paper out on the kitchen table, and proceeded to munch and read. I\x{2019}m one of those people who read the paper from beginning to end, in order, so it took me awhile to get to the article about the vanishing elephant. The front page was filled with stories of SDI and the trade friction with America, after which I plowed through the national news, international politics, economics, letters to the editor, book reviews, real-estate ads, sports reports, and finally, the regional news.",

On the ground, still locked, lay the steel shackle that had been fastened to the elephant\x{2019}s hind leg, as though the elephant had slipped out of it. Nor was the elephant the only one missing. Also gone was its keeper, the man who had been in charge of the elephant\x{2019}s care and feeding from the start.",
