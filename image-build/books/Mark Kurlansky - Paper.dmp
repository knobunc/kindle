They found that a certain asphalt compound was light-sensitive, and in the 1820s they produced the first photographs, which they called heliographs. The oldest-known permanent photograph, an image of a man leading a horse, dates from <<1825|9c:0>>. The heliograph was an image fixed on polished pewter coated with a thin layer of bitumen, or asphalt, dissolved in lavender oil. The image had to be exposed in the camera for at least eight hours, the brothers said, but it may have taken days.",

            "And so the resourceful Gilpin decided that he would steal the ideas for the cylinder machine. He could never have done this with a Fourdrinier, which was much more complicated, and he did not think any Philadelphia metalworkers would understand how to build it anyway. But he studied the cylinder machine, watched it work, drew sketches, found knowledgeable people with whom he could discuss the machine\x{2019}s working parts, and studied the considerable amount of information that had been filed with its patent. Gilpin visited Dickinson to get a look at a working machine, but was unable to get close enough. Yet by an incredible coincidence, Gilpin\x{2019}s foreman, Lawrence Greatrake happened to be in London on family business. The son of an English paper-mill owner in Hertfordshire, Greatrake visited Dickinson and the two seemed to enjoy each other\x{2019}s company. Dickinson invited him to stay for several days and observe the machine. He would not let him take measurements, but Greatrake did manage to pace off basic dimensions. Back home at the Brandywine Mill, Greatrake and Gilpin\x{2019}s brother, Thomas, then built and patented their own cylinder machine in 1816; that machine did not turn out satisfactory paper until <<1818|9c:0>>.",

            'The United States did not have nearly enough rags to supply its paper mills, and so it imported rags from Europe. Foreign rag imports to New York, mostly from Italy, rose three and a half times between 1845 and 1859. In Europe, automated textile mills were producing more cloth, but that was not translating into useful rags. Wool had become increasingly fashionable, often replacing cotton and linen. In 1825, the United States imported $79,639 worth of rags. The following year, the figure had risen to $122,624. By <<1832|9n:0>>, it had reached $707,011. These rises reflected both an increase in the amount of rags imported and an increase in price; the scarcity of rags had made prices climb. By the 1850s, rags represented half the cost of making paper.',

There were patents registered in Britain for making paper from wood pulp in the 1840s and 1850s, but the idea was not taken up by paper mills. On the Continent, the wood-pulp industry was inaugurated in 1840 when a German, F. G. Keller, patented a very workable method of making paper from the pulp produced by grinding wood. By <<1850|9n:0>>, paper based on the Keller patent was being commercially manufactured. German techniques for producing ground wood pulp were then readily adopted in North America, a land where forests were plentiful.',

            "The first attempt in the United States to commercially produce wood pulp for paper mills was by a Massachusetts company, Platner & Smith in 1857. The effort failed, however, because the process was too expensive and yielded poor-quality paper. The first commercially successful wood pulp did not appear until 1867, when it was made in Curtisville, Massachusetts, by <<two|9:0>> German brothers, Albrecht and Rudolf Pagenstecher, who had brought over two German Keller-Voelter wood grinders. They sold their pulp to the Smith Paper Company, which used it to produce one of the fastest-growing commercial products of the day, newsprint. Seventeen years later, in 1884, turning wood into paper became truly efficient thanks to Peter Jensen in Maasb\x{fc}ll, Germany. He started producing wood chippers, machines that rapidly cut wood blocks into pieces no more than one inch long and 1/<<8 to 3|10a:0>>/16 of an inch thick.",

The sulphite process gave off horrendous odors, but fortunately many paper mills, no longer needing to be situated near population centers for rags, were now located deep in the countryside, near forests. And though the mills were no longer water-powered, they were still located near a water source. A tremendous amount of water was needed to move and spread the wood fibers thinly on the screens; the solution had to be only 2 to 4 percent wood fibers and 96 to 98 percent water, making the pulp look like slightly cloudy water. All paper mills today are still located by a water source.",

During the Italian War of Independence in 1848, an Austrian officer had developed the idea of using thin paper balloons to drop bombs. He calculated that a balloon could stay aloft for a half hour with a thirty-pound bomb that would then explode with a timed fuse when it landed. These balloon bombs were used in the siege of Venice, but to no real effect, although one did manage to land in the Piazza San Marco and explode. A wind shift also caused a number of the balloons to float back toward the soldiers who had launched them. The attackers lost enthusiasm for their new weapon and the idea lay dormant until <<1933|9c:0>>, when Japanese lieutenant general Reikichi Tada was assigned to a research laboratory to develop new weapons.',
