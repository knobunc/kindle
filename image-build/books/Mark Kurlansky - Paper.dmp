They sold their pulp to the Smith Paper Company, which used it to produce one of the fastest-growing commercial products of the day, newsprint. Seventeen years later, in 1884, turning wood into paper became truly efficient thanks to Peter Jensen in Maasb\x{fc}ll, Germany. He started producing wood chippers, machines that rapidly cut wood blocks into pieces no more than one inch long and 1/<<8 to 3|10a:0>>/16 of an inch thick.",

By <<1920|9:0>>, the United States and Canada, rich in forestland, were producing more than 2 million tons of sulphite pulp annually. The sulphite process gave off horrendous odors, but fortunately many paper mills, no longer needing to be situated near population centers for rags, were now located deep in the countryside, near forests. And though the mills were no longer water-powered, they were still located near a water source. A tremendous amount of water was needed to move and spread the wood fibers thinly on the screens; the solution had to be only 2 to 4 percent wood fibers and 96 to 98 percent water, making the pulp look like slightly cloudy water. All paper mills today are still located by a water source.",

As a young man, he worked as a furniture carver, but he did not start carving wood blocks until <<1906|9c:0>>, when he was almost forty years old. His wood blocks flaunt a crude simplicity. He carved very quickly, welcoming oddly turned lines, and relished aberrations in his printing\x{2014}no two prints of his are the same.

            'The Japanese took two years to develop and test their new weapon, its design based on an eighteenth-century balloon. During the Italian War of Independence in 1848, an Austrian officer had developed the idea of using thin paper balloons to drop bombs. He calculated that a balloon could stay aloft for a half hour with a thirty-pound bomb that would then explode with a timed fuse when it landed. These balloon bombs were used in the siege of Venice, but to no real effect, although one did manage to land in the Piazza San Marco and explode. A wind shift also caused a number of the balloons to float back toward the soldiers who had launched them. The attackers lost enthusiasm for their new weapon and the idea lay dormant until <<1933|9c:0>>, when Japanese lieutenant general Reikichi Tada was assigned to a research laboratory to develop new weapons.',

But between 1920 and 1923, the mill installed two new machines, each producing seven tons an hour, and in 1956, it installed a machine that makes fifteen tons an hour. Yet another machine was added in 1965; it also produces fifteen tons an hour.",
