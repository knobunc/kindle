massed clouds, themselves vast floating asymmetric sea-beasts so large they are
host to whole nations of other species, including, surely, Man? As if they
entirely surfaced from their element, ready to plunge again into depths as
mysterious to those below as oceans are to those above them.\x{201d} His face glowed a
richer red with all this bright recollection, his eyes appeared to focus again
upon those clouds, upon those monumental natural barges, like raised wrecks,
alarmingly complete after millennia, alien beyond imagining, beyond any impulse
of ordinary mortals to follow, which one\x{2019}s very soul yearned to forget, those
obscenely ancient beast-ships grown insubstantial in their sudden element, this
brilliancy of sun and sky, and gradually their outlines dim, turn grey and fade
one into another until only the sun and the sky remain, witnesses of their
unmourned passing. \x{201c}Have they grown invisible or are they gone for ever, even
from our blood\x{2019}s strange memory, that tiny speck of ancestral matter that
informs our race\x{2019}s united soul? Would that be to say they never existed and
never could exist? Many things existed before our ancestors ever lifted one
webbed foot upon a steamy shore\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{201d}",

now the black-and-yellow ship moved through the tugging currents of the reef\x{2014}a
few inches this way, a few that, sometimes touching a rock so lightly there was
the barest whisper of friction, sometimes seeming to squeeze between pillars of
basalt and obsidian, while the wind yelled and the surf crashed and the whole
world seemed once more to be given up to Chaos. It was <<noon|13>> before they had
negotiated the first line of reefs and lay at anchor in the calm waters between
themselves and the second line. Now the navigator gave instructions for the
crew to eat well and to rest. They would not attempt the next line until the

was on the night of the full moon that I saw her take out the folded wolfskin
and drape it around her shoulders, saw her drop to all fours and in a
bewildering instant stand, growling faintly at the children to stay close to
the fire, looking out into the night, an enormous wolf. Yet still she did not
see me, did not scent me. I was invisible to her supernatural senses. She moved
off towards the mountains and was back at <<noon that next day|9a>> with a kill, some nomad boy,
probably a herder, and two lambs, which she had dragged, using the boy\x{2019}s body
as a kind of sledge. The human remains she left for herself, but assumed her
woman form once she had brought the lambs into camp. These she prepared for her
children. Later that evening, as they ate the rich-smelling stew she had cooked,
she returned to her human kill and devoured a good deal of him, almost
certainly in wolf shape. I was too cautious to get closer to her.",
