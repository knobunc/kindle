            'SUBTITLE: THE HELL IT IS


 "Be a job an\' a half," Castle said, mopping up residual spaghetti sauce with a piece of garlic bread. "It\'s not like your Howard Hughes guy, or Hitler\'s notebooks."
 "You\'ve been doing some research." John\'s voice was a little slurred. He\'d bought a half gallon of Portuguese wine, the bottle wrapped in straw like cheap Chianti, the wine not quite that good. If you could get past the first couple of glasses, it was okay. It had been okay to John for some time now.
 "Yeah, down to the library. The guys who did the Hitler notebooks, hell, nobody\'d ever seen a real Hitler notebook; they just studied his handwriting in letters and such, then read up on what he did day after day. Same with the Howard Hughes, but that was even easier, because most of the time nobody knew what the hell Howard Hughes was doing anyhow. Just stayed locked up in that room."
 "The Hughes forgery nearly worked, as I recall," John said. "If Hughes himself hadn\'t broken silence... "
 "Ya gotta know that took balls. \'Scuse me, Lena." She waved a hand and laughed. "Try to get away with that while Hughes was still alive."
 "How did the Hitler people screw up?" she asked.
 "Funny thing about that one was how many people they fooled. Afterwards everybody said it was a really lousy fake. But you can bet that before the newspapers bid millions of dollars on it, they showed it to the best Hitlerologists they could find, and they all said it was real."
 "Because they wanted it to be real," Lena said.
 "Yeah. But one of the pages had some chemical in it that wouldn\'t be in paper before <<1945|9c:0>>. That was kinda dumb."
 "People would want the Hemingway stories to be real," Lena said quietly, to John.
 John\'s gaze stayed fixed on the center of the table, where a few strands of spaghetti lay cold and drying in a plastic bowl. "Wouldn\'t be honest."
 "That\'s for sure," Castle said cheerily. "But it ain\'t exactly armed robbery, either."
 "A gross misuse of intellectual... intellectual... "
 "It\'s past your bedtime, John," Lena said. "We\'ll clean up." John nodded and pushed himself away from the table and walked heavily into the bedroom. Lena didn\'t say anything until she heard the bedsprings creak. "He isn\'t always like this," she said quietly.
 "Yeah. He don\'t act like no alky."
 "It\'s been a hard year for him." She refilled her glass. "Me, too. Money."
 "That\'s bad."
 "Well, we knew it was coming. He tell you about the inheritance?" Castle leaned forward. "Huh uh."
 "He was born pretty well off. Family had textile mills up in New Hampshire. John\'s grandparents died in an auto accident in the forties and the family sold off the mills--good timing, too. They wouldn\'t be worth much today. "Then John\'s father and mother died in the sixties, while he was in college. The executors set up a trust fund that looked like it would keep him in pretty good shape forever. But he wasn\'t interested in money. He even joined the army, to see what it was like."
 "Jesus."
 "Afterwards, he carried a picket sign and marched against the war--you know, Vietnam.
 "Then he finished his Ph. D. and started teaching. The trust fund must have been fifty times as much as his salary, when he started out. It was still ten times as much, a couple of years ago."
 "Boy... howdy." Castle was doing mental arithmetic and algebra with variables like Porsches and fast boats.
 "But he let his sisters take care of it. He let them reinvest the capital."
 "They weren\'t too swift?"
 "They were idiots! They took good solid blue-chip stocks and tax-free municipals, too \'boring\' for them, and threw it all away gambling on commodities." She grimaced. "Pork bellies? I finally had John go to Chicago and come back with what was left of his money. There wasn\'t much."
 "You ain\'t broke, though."
 "Damned near. There\'s enough income to pay for insurance and eventually we\'ll be able to draw on an IRA. But the cash payments stop in two months. We\'ll have to live on John\'s salary. I suppose I\'ll get a job, too."
 "What you ought to get is a typewriter."
 Lena laughed and slouched back in her chair. "That would be something.
 "You think he could do it? I mean if he would, do you think he could?"
 "He\'s a good writer." She looked thoughtful. "He\'s had some stories published, you know, in the literary magazines. The ones that pay four or five free copies."
 "Big deal."',

            'After a few minutes she brought it out and handed it to him. "And how is Dr. Baird today?"
 "Dr. Baird needs a doctor. Or an undertaker." He shook out two aspirin a nd washed them down with the last of the beer. "Like your outfit."
 She was wearing only a towel around her head. She simpered and struck a dancer\'s pose and spun daintily around. "Think it\'ll catch on?"
 "Oh my yes." At thirty-five, she still had the trim model\'s figure that had caught his eye in the classroom, fifteen years before. A safe, light tan was uniform all over her body, thanks to liberal sunblock and the private sunbathing area on top of the house--private except for the helicopter that came low over head every weekday at <<1:15|2>>. She always tried to be there in time to wave at it. The pilot had such white teeth. She wondered how many sunbathers were on his route.
 She undid the towel and rubbed her long blond hair vigorously. "Thought I\'d cool off for a few minutes before I got dressed. Too much wine, eh?"
 "Couldn\'t you tell from my sparkling repartee last night?" He leaned back, eyes closed, and rolled the cool glass back and forth on his forehead.
 "Want another beer?"
 "Yeah. Coffee\'d be smarter, though."
 "It\'s been sitting all night."
 "Pay for my sins." He watched her swivel lightly into the kitchen and, more than ever before, felt the difference in their ages. Seventeen years; he was half again as old as she. A young man would say the hell with the hangover, go grab that luscious thing and carry her back to bed. The organ that responded to this meditation was his stomach, though, and it responded very audibly.
 "Some toast, too. Or do you want something fancier?"
 "Toast would be fine." Why was she being so nice? Usually if he drank too much, he reaped the whirlwind in the morning.
 "Ugh." She saw the scorpions. "Five of them now."
 "I wonder how many it will hold before it comes crashing down. Scorpions everywhere, stunned. Then angry."
 "I\'m sure the bug man knows how to get rid of them."
 "In Africa they claimed that if you light a ring of fire around them with gasoline or lighter fluid, they go crazy, run amok, stinging themselves to death in their frenzies. Maybe the bug man could do that."
 "Castle and I came up with a plan last night. It\'s kinda screwy, but it might just work."
 "Read that in a book called Jungle Ways. I was eight years old and believed every word of it."
 "We figured out a way that it would be legal. Are you listening?"
 "Uh huh. Let me have real sugar and some milk."
 She poured some milk in a cup and put it in the microwave to warm. "Maybe we should talk about it later."
 "Oh no. Hemingway forgery. You figured out a way to make it legal. Go ahead. I\'m all ears."
 "See, you tell the publisher first off what it is, that you wrote it and then had it typed up to look authentic."
 "Sure, be a big market for that."
 "In fact, there could be. You\'d have to generate it, but it could happen." The toast sprang up and she brought it and two cups of coffee into the living room on a tray. "See, the bogus manuscript is only one part of a book."
 "I don\'t get it." He tore the toast into strips, to dunk in the strong Cuban coffee.
 "The rest of the book is in the nature of an exegesis of your own text."
 "If that con man knows what exegesis is, then I can crack a safe."
 "That part\'s my idea. You\'re really writing a book about Hemingway. You use your own text to illustrate various points--\'I wrote it this way instead of that way because--\' "
 "It would be different," he conceded. "Perhaps the second most egotistic al piece of Hemingway scholarship in history. A dubious distinction."
 "You could write it tongue-in-cheek, though. It could be really amusing, as well as scholarly."
 "God, we\'d have to get an unlisted number, publishers calling us night a nd day. Movie producers. Might sell ten copies, if I bought nine."
 "You really aren\'t getting it, John. You don\'t have a particle of larceny in your heart."
 He put a hand on his heart and looked down. "Ventricles, auricles. My undying love for you, a little heartburn. No particles."
 "See, you tell the publisher the truth... but the publisher doesn\'t have to tell the truth. Not until publication day."
 "Okay. I still don\'t get it."
 She took a delicate nibble of toast. "It goes like this. They print the bogus Hemingway up into a few copies of bogus bound galleys. Top secret."
 "My exegesis carefully left off."
 "That\'s the ticket. They send it out to a few selected scholars, along with Xeroxes of a few sample manuscript pages.
 All they say, in effect, is \'Does this seem authentic to you? Please keep it under your hat, for obvious reasons.\' Then they sit back and collect blurbs."
 "I can see the kind of blurbs they\'d get from Scott or Mike or Jack, for instance. Some variation of \'What kind of idiot do you think I am?\' "
 "Those aren\'t the kind of people you send it to, dope! You send it to people who think they\'re experts, but aren\'t. Castle says this is how the Hitler thing almost worked--they knew better than to show it to historians in general. They showed it to a few people and didn\'t quote the ones who thought it was a fake. Surely you can come up with a list of people who would be easy to fool."
 "Any scholar could. Be a different list for each one; I\'d be on some of them."
 "So they bring it out on April Fool\'s Day. You get the front page of the New York Times Book Review. Publishers Weekly does a story. Everybody wants to be in on the joke. Best-seller list, here we come."',

 "Compared to not ending, it\'s bad."
 "That shows how little you know. I and the ones like me can never die. If you want something to occupy your last moment, your last thought, you might pity me." John stared straight into his eyes. "Fuck you."
 The cane dropped. A fireball exploded in his head.


 12. MARRIAGE IS A DANGEROUS CAME


 "We\'ll blackmail him." Castle and Lena were together in the big antique bathtub, in a sea of pink foam, her back against his chest.
 "Sure," she said. " \'If you don\'t let us pass this manuscript off as the real thing, we\'ll tell everybody you faked it.\' Something wrong with that, but I can\'t quite put my finger on it."
 "Here, I\'ll put mine on it."
 She giggled. "Later. What do you mean, blackmail?"
 "Got it all figured out. I\'ve got this friend Pansy, she used to be a call girl. Been out of the game seven, eight years; still looks like a million bucks."
 "Sure. We fix John up with this hooker--"
 "Call girl isn\'t a hooker. We\'re talkin\' class."
 "In the first place, John wouldn\'t pay for sex. He did that in Vietnam and it still bothers him."
 "Not talkin\' about pay. Talkin\' about fallin\' in love. While she meanwhile fucks his eyeballs out."
 "You have such a turn of phrase, Sylvester. Then while his eyeballs are out, you come in with a camera."
 "Yeah, but you\'re about six steps ahead."
 "Okay, step two; how do we get them together? Church social?"
 "She moves in next door." There was another upstairs apartment, unoccupied. "You and me and Julio are conveniently somewhere else when she shows up with all these boxes and that big flight of stairs."
 "Sure, John would help her. But that\'s his nature; he\'d help her if she were an ugly old crone with leprosy. Carry a few boxes, sit down for a cup of coffee, maybe. But not jump into the sack."
 "Okay, you know John." His voice dropped to a husky whisper and he cupped her breasts. "But I know men, and I know Pansy... and Pansy could give a hardon to a corpse."
 "Sure, and then fuck his eyeballs out. They\'d come out easier."
 "What?"
 "Never mind. Go ahead."
 "Well... look. Do you know what a call girl does?"
 "I suppose you call her up and say you\'ve got this eyeball problem."
 "Enough with the eyeballs. What she does, she works for like an escort service. That part of it\'s legal. Guy comes into town, business or maybe on vacation, he calls up the service and they ask what kind of companion he\'d like. If he says, like, give me some broad with a tight ass, can suck the chrome off a bumper hitch--the guy says like \'I\'m sorry, sir, but this is not that kind of a service.\' But mostly the customers are pretty hip to it, they say, oh, a pretty young blonde who likes to go dancing."
 "Meanwhile they\'re thinking about bumper hitches and eyeballs."
 "You got it. So it starts out just like a date, just the guy pays the escort service like twenty bucks for getting them together. Still no law broken.
 "Now about one out of three, four times, that\'s it. The guy knows what\'s going on but he don\'t get up the nerve to ask, or he really doesn\'t know the score, and it\'s like a real dull date. I don\'t think that happened much with Pansy."
 "In the normal course of things, though, the subject of bumper hitches comes up."
 "Uh huh, but not from Pansy. The guy has to pop the question. That way if he\'s a cop it\'s, what, entrapment."
 "Do you know whether Pansy ever got busted?"
 "Naw. Mainly the cops just shake down the hookers, just want a blowjob anyhow. This town, half of \'em want a blow-job from guys.
 "So they pop the question and Pansy blushes and says for you, I guess I could. Then, on the way to the motel or wherever she says, you know, I wouldn\'t ask this if we weren\'t really good friends, but I got to make a car payment by tomorrow, and I need like two hundred bucks before <<noon|13>> tomorrow?"
 "And she takes MasterCard and VISA."
 "No, but she sure as hell knows where every bank machine in town is. She even writes up an I. O. U. " Castle laughed. "Told me a guy from Toledo\'s holdin\' five grand of I. O. U. s from her."
 "All right, but that\'s not John. She could suck the chrome off his eyeballs and he still wouldn\'t be interested in her if she didn\'t know Hemingway from hummingbirds."
 Castle licked behind her ear, a weird gesture that made her shiver. "That\'s the trump card. Pansy reads like a son of a bitch. She\'s got like a thousand books. So this morning I called her up and asked about Hemingway."
 "And?"
 "She\'s read them all."
 She nodded slowly. "Not bad, Sylvester. So we promote this love affair and sooner or later you catch them in the act. Threaten to tell me unless John accedes to a life of crime."
 "Think it could work? He wouldn\'t say hell, go ahead and tell her?"
 "Not if I do my part... starting tomorrow. I\'m the best, sweetest, lovingest wife in this sexy town. Then in a couple of weeks Pansy comes into his life, and there he is, luckiest man alive. Best of both worlds. Until you accidentally catch them in flagrante delicioso."
 "So to keep both of you, he goes along with me."
 "It might just do it. It might just." She slowly levered herself out of the water and smoothed the suds off her various assets.
 "Nice."
 "Bring me that bumper hitch, Sylvester. Hold on to your eyeballs."',

            'The second explanation seemed much more reasonable.
 On the tray underneath the coffee, juice, and Danish was a copy of USA Today, a paper John normally avoided because, although it had its comic aspects, it didn\'t have any funnies. He checked the date, and it was correct. The news stories were plausible--wars and rumors of war--so at least he hadn\'t slipped into a dimension where Martians ruled an enslaved Earth or Barry Manilow was president. He turned to the weather map and stopped dead.
 Yesterday the country was in the middle of a heat wave that had lasted weeks. It apparently had ended overnight. The entry for Boston, yesterday, was "72/58/sh." But it hadn\'t rained and the temperature had been in the nineties.
 He went back to the front page and began checking news stories. He didn\'t normally pay much attention to the news, though, and hadn\'t seen a paper in several days. They\'d canceled their Globe delivery for the six weeks in Key West and he hadn\'t been interested enough to go seek out a newsstand.
 There was no mention of the garbage collectors\' strike in New York; he\'d overheard a conversation about that yesterday. A long obituary for a rock star he was sure had died the year before.
 An ad for DeSoto automobiles. That company had gone out of business when he was a teenager.
 Bundles of universes, different from each other in small ways. Instead of dying, or maybe because of dying, he had slipped into another one. What would be waiting for him in Key West?
 Maybe John Baird.
 He set the tray down and hugged himself, trembling. Who or what was he in this universe? All of his memories, all of his personality, were from the one he had been born in. What happened to the John Baird that was born in this one? Was he an associate professor in American Literature at Boston University? Was he down in Key West wrestling with a paper to give at Nairobi--or working on a forgery? Or was he a Fitzgerald specialist snooping around the literary attics of St. Paul, Minnesota?
 The truth came suddenly. Both John Bairds were in this compartment, in this body. And the body was slightly different.
 He opened the door to the small washroom and looked in the mirror. His hair was a little shorter, less grey, beard better trimmed.
 He was less paunchy and... something felt odd. There was feeling in his thigh. He lowered his pants and there was no scar where the sniper bullet had opened his leg and torn up the nerves there.
 That was the touchstone. As he raised his shirt, the parallel memory flooded in. Puckered round scar on the abdomen; in this universe the sniper had hit a foot higher--and instead of the convalescent center in Cam Ranh Bay, the months of physical therapy and then back into the war, it had been peritonitis raging; surgery in Saigon and Tokyo and Walter Reed, and no more army.
 But slowly they converged again. Amherst and U. Mass. --perversely using the G. I. Bill in spite of his access to millions--the doctorate on The Sun Also Rises and the instructorship at B. U., meeting Lena and virtuously waiting until after the semester to ask her out. Sex on the second date, and the third... but there they verged again. This John Baird hadn\'t gone back into combat to have his midsection sprayed with shrapnel from an American grenade that bounced off a tree; never had dozens of bits of metal cut out of his dick--and in the ensuing twenty-five years had made more use of it. Girlfriends and even one disastrous homosexual encounter with a stranger. As far as he knew, Lena was in the dark about this side of him; thought that he had remained faithful other than one incident seven years after they married. He knew of one affair she had had with a colleague, and suspected more.
 The two Johns\' personalities and histories merged, separate but one, like two vines from a common root, climbing a single support.
 Schizophrenic but not insane.
 John looked into the mirror and tried to address his new or his old self--John A, John B. There were no such people. There was suddenly a man who had existed in two separate universes and, in a way, it was no more profound than having lived in two separate houses.
 The difference being that nobody else knows there is more than one house.
 He moved over to the window and set his coffee in the holder, picked up the absinthe glass and sniffed it, considered pouring it down the drain, but then put it in the other holder, for possible future reference.
 Posit this: is it more likely that there are bundles of parallel universes prevailed over by a Hemingway look-alike with a magic cane, or that John Baird was exposed to a drug that he had never experienced before and it had had an unusually disorienting effect?
 He looked at the paper. He had not hallucinated two weeks of drought. The rock star had been dead for some time. He had not seen a DeSoto in twenty years, and that was a hard car to miss. Tail fins that had to be registered as lethal weapons.
 But maybe if you take a person who remembers every trivial thing, and zap his brain with oil of wormwood, that is exactly the effect: perfectly recalled things that never actually happened.
 The coffee tasted repulsive. John put on a fresh shirt and decided not to shave and headed for the bar car. He bought the last imported beer in the cooler and sat down across from the long-haired white-bearded man who had an earring that had escaped his notice before, or hadn\'t existed in the other universe.
 The man was staring out at the forest greening by. "Morning," John said.
 "How do." The man looked at him with no sign of recognition.
 "Did we talk last night?"
 He leaned forward. "What?"
 "I mean did we sit in this car last night and talk about Hemingway and Vietnam and ghosts?"
 He laughed. "You\'re on somethin\', man. I been on this train since <<two in the mornin\'|5>> and ain\'t said boo to nobody but the bartender."
 "You were in Vietnam?"
 "Yeah, but that\'s over; that\'s shit." He pointed at John\'s bracelet. "What, you got ghosts from over there?"
 "I think maybe I have."
 He was suddenly intense. "Take my advice, man; I been there. You got to go talk to somebody. Some shrink. Those ghosts ain\'t gonna go \'way by themself."
 "It\'s not that bad."
 "It ain\'t the ones you killed." He wasn\'t listening. "Fuckin" dinks, they come back but they don\'t, you know, they just stand around." He looked at John and tears came so hard they actually spurted from his eyes. "It\'s your fuckin\' friends, man, they all died and they come back now--" He took a deep breath and wiped his face. "They used to come back every night. That like you?" John shook his head, helpless, trapped by the man\'s grief. "Every fuckin\' night, my old lad y, finally she said you go to a shrink or go to hell." He fumbled with the button on his shirt pocket and took out a brown plastic prescription bottle and stared at the label. He shook out a capsule. "Take a swig?" John pushed the beer over to him. He washed the pill down without touching the bottle to his lips.
 He sagged back against the window. "I musta not took the pill last night, sometimes I do that. Sorry." He smiled weakly. "One day at a time, you know? You get through the one day. Fuck the rest. Sorry." He leaned forward again suddenly and put his hand on John\'s wrist. "You come outa nowhere and I lay my fuckin\' trip on you. You don\' need it."
 John covered the hand with his own. "Maybe I do need it. And maybe I didn\'t come out of nowhere." He stood up. "I will see somebody about the ghosts. Promise." "You\'ll feel better. It\'s no fuckin\' cure-all, but you\'ll feel better."
 "Want the beer?"
 He shook his head. "Not supposed to."


 "Okay." John took the beer and they waved at each other and he started back.',

            '"No complaints." She raised up on one elbow and traced a figure eight on his chest. "You\'re full of surprises tonight Dr. Baird."
 "Life is full of surprises."
 "You should go away more often--or at least come back more often."
 "It\'s all that Hemingway research. Makes a man out of you."
 "You didn\'t learn this in a book," she said, gently taking his penis and pantomiming a certain motion.
 "I did, though, an anthropology book." In another universe. "It\'s what they do in the Solomon Islands."
 "Wisdom of Solomon," she said, lying back. After a pause: "They have anthropology books at JFK?"
 "Uh, no." He remembered he didn\'t own that book in this universe. "Browsing at Wordsworth\'s."
 "Hope you bought the book."
 "Didn\'t have to." He gave her a long slow caress. "Memorized the good parts."
 On the other side of town, six days later, she was in about the same position on Castle\'s bed, and even more exhausted.
 "Aren\'t you overdoing the loving little wifey bit? It\'s been a week."
 She exhaled audibly. "What a week."
 "Missed you." He nuzzled her and made an unsubtle preparatory gesture.
 "No, you don\'t." She rolled out of bed. "Once is plenty." She went to the mirror and ran a brush through her damp hair. "Besides, it\'s not me you missed. You missed it." She sat at the open window, improving the neighborhood\'s scenery. "It\'s gonna need a Teflon lining installed."
 "Old boy\'s feelin\' his oats?"
 "Not feeling his anything. God, I don\'t know what\'s gotten into him. <<Four|9k:0>>, five times a day; <<six|9k:0>>."
 "Screwed, blewed, and tattooed. You asked for it."
 "As a matter of fact, I didn\'t. I haven\'t had a chance to start my little act. He got off that train with an erection, and he still has it. No woman would be safe around him. Nothing wet and concave would be safe."
 "So does that mean it\'s a good time to bring in Pansy? Or is he so stuck on you he wouldn\'t even notice her?"
 She scowled at the brush, picking hair out of it. "Actually, Castle, I was just about to ask you the same thing. Relying on your well-known expertise in animal behavior."
 "Okay." He sat up. "I say we oughta go for it. If he\'s a walkin\' talkin\' hard-on like you say... Pansy\'d pull him like a magnet. You\'d have to be a fuckin\' monk not to want Pansy."
 "Like Rasputin."
 "Like who?"
 "Never mind." She went back to the brush. "I guess, I guess one problem is that I really am enjoying the attention. I guess I\'m not too anxious to hand him over to this champion sexpot."
 "Aw, Lena--"
 "Really. I do love him in my way, Castle. I don\'t want to lose him over this scheme."
 "You\'re not gonna lose him. Trust me. You catch him dickin\' Pansy, get mad, forgive him. Hell, you\'ll have him wrapped around your finger."
 "I guess. You make the competition sound pretty formidable."
 "Don\'t worry. She\'s outa there the next day."
 "Unless she winds up in love with him. That would be cute."

            '"Oh, I couldn\'t ask you to help. I can manage."
 "It\'s okay. I was just goofing off for the rest of the day." It turned out to be quite a job, even though there was only one load from a small rented truck. Most of the load was uniform and heavy boxes of books, carefully labeled 
 LIT A-B, GEN REF, ENCY <<1-12|5a:1>>, 
 and so forth. Most of her furniture, accordingly, was cinder blocks and boards, the standard student bookshelf arrangement.John found out that despite a couple of dozen boxes marked LIT, Pansy hadn\'t majored in literature, but rather Special Education; during the school year, she taught third grade at a school for the retarded in Key Largo. She didn\'t tell him about the several years she\'d spent as a call girl, but if she had, John might have seen a connection that Castle would never have made--that the driving force behind both of the jobs was the same, charity. The more or less easy forty dollars an hour for going on a date and then having sex was a factor, too, but she really did like making lonely men feel special, and had herself felt more like a social worker than a woman of easy virtue. And the hundreds of men who had fallen for her, for love or money, weren\'t responding only to her cheerleader\'s body. She had a sunny disposition and a natural, artless way of concentrating on a man that made him for a while the only man in the world.',

 The Hemingway waved the beer bottle in a disarmingly mature gesture. "The Omniverse is full of threads of coincidence like that. They have causal meaning in a dimension you can\'t deal with."
 "Try me."
 "In a way, that\'s what I want to propose. You will drop this dangerous project at once, and never resume it. In return, I will take you back in time, back to the Gare de Lyon on December 14, 1921."

As you know, some people have theorized that there never was a thief; never was an overnight bag; that Hadley simply threw the writings away. If that\'s the case, you won\'t see anything dramatic. But the absence of the overnight bag would be powerful indirect proof."
 John looked skeptical "You\'ve never gone to check it out for yourself?"
 "If I had, I wouldn\'t be able to take you back. I can\'t exist twice in the same timespace, of course."
 "How foolish of me. Of course."
 "Is it a deal?"
 John studied the apparition. The couch\'s plaid upholstery showed through its arms and legs. It did appear to become less substantial each time. "I don\'t know. Let me think about it a couple of days."
 The child pulled on the beer bottle and it stretched into a long amber stick. It turned into the black-and-white cane. "We haven\'t tried cancer yet. That might be the one that works." It slipped off the couch and sidled toward John. "It does take longer and it hurts. It hurts awfully."
 John got out of the chair. "You come near me with that and I\'ll drop kick you into next Tuesday."
 The child shimmered and became Hemingway in his mid-forties, a big-gutted barroom brawler. "Sure you will Champ." It held out the cane so that the tip was inches from John\'s chest "See you around." It disappeared with a barely audib le pop, and a slight breeze as air moved to fill its space.
 John thought about that as he went to make a fresh cup of coffee. He wished he knew more about science. The thing obviously takes up space, since its disappearance caused a vacuum, but there was no denying that it was fading away.
 Well, not fading. Just becoming more transparent. That might not affect its abilities. A glass door is as much of a door as an opaque one, if you try to walk through it He sat down on the couch, away from the manuscript so he could think without distraction. On the face of it this offer by the Hemingway was an admission of defeat. An admission, at least that it couldn\'t solve its problem by killing him over and over. That was comforting. He would just as soon not die again, except for the one time.
 But maybe he should. That was a chilling thought. If he made the Hemingway kill him another dozen times, another hundred... what kind of strange creature would he become? A hundred overlapping autobiographies, all perfectly remembered? Surely the brain has a finite capacity for storing information; he\'d "fill up," as Pansy said. Or maybe it wasn\'t finite, at least in his case--but that was logically absurd. There are only so many cells in a brain. Of course he might be "wired" in some way to the John Bairds in all the other universes he had inhabited.
 And what would happen if he died in some natural way, not dispatched by an interdimensional assassin? Would he still slide into another identity? That was a lovely prospect: sooner or later he would be 130 years old, on his deathbed, dying every fraction of a second for the rest of eternity.
 Or maybe the Hemingway wasn\'t lying, this time, and he had only eight lives left. In context, the possibility was reassuring.
 The phone rang; for a change, John was grateful for the interruption. It was Lena, saying her father had come home from the hospital, much better, and she thought she could come on home day after tomorrow. Fine, John said, feeling a little wicked; I\'ll borrow a car and pick you up at the airport. Don\'t bother, Lena said; besides, she didn\'t have a flight number yet.
 John didn\'t press it. If, as he assumed, Lena was in on the plot with Castle, she was probably here in Key West, or somewhere nearby. If she had to buy a ticket to and from Omaha to keep up her end of the ruse, the money would come out of John\'s pocket.
 He hung up and, on impulse, dialed her parents\' number. Her father answered. Putting on his professorial tone, he said he was Maxwell Perkins, Blue Cross claims adjuster, and he needed to know the exact date when Mr. Monaghan entere d the hospital for this recent confinement. He said you must have the wrong guy; I haven\'t been inside a hospital in twenty years, knock on wood. Am I not speaking to John Franklin Monaghan? No, this is John Frederick Monaghan. Terribly sorry, natural mistake. That\'s okay; hope the other guy\'s okay, good-bye, good night, sir.
 So tomorrow was going to be the big day with Pansy. To his knowledge, John hadn\'t been watched during sex for more than twenty years, and never by a disinterested, or at least dispassionate, observer. He hoped that knowing they were being spied upon wouldn\'t affect his performance. Or knowing that it would be the last time.
 A profound helpless sadness settled over him. He knew that the last thing you should do, in a mood like this, was go out and get drunk. It was barely <<noon|13>>, anyhow. He took enough money out of his wallet for five martinis, hid the wallet under a couch cushion, and headed for Duval Street.',

            '"No. And don\'t worry about appearing to be talking to yourself. A lot of that goes on around here."
 "Look. Why can\'t you just take me back to a couple of weeks before we met on the train, back in the first universe? I\'ll just... " The Hemingway was shaking its head slowly. "You can\'t."
 "No. As I explained, you already exist there--"
 "You said that you couldn\'t be in the same place twice. How do you know I can\'t?"
 "How do you know you can\'t swallow that piano? You just can\'t."
 "You thought I couldn\'t talk about you, either, you thought your stick would kill me. I\'m not like normal people."
 "Except in that alcohol does nothing for your judgment."
 John ate a peanut thoughtfully. "Try this on for size. At <<11:46|2>> on June 3, a man named Sylvester Castlemaine sat down in Dos Hermosas and started talking with me about the lost manuscripts. The forgery would never have occurred to me if I hadn\'t talked to him. Why don\'t you go back and keep him from going into that cafe? Or just go back to <<11:30|2>> and kill him."
 The Hemingway smiled maliciously. "You don\'t like him much."
 "It\'s more fear than like or dislike." He rubbed his face hard, remembering. "Funny how things shift around. He was kind of likable the first time I met him. Then you killed me on the train and in the subsequent universe, he became colder, more serious. Then you killed me in Pansy\'s apartment and in this universe, he has turned mean. Dangerously mean, like a couple of men I knew in Vietnam. The ones who really love the killing. Like you, evidently."
 It blew a chain of smoke rings before answering. "I don\'t \'love\' killing, or anything else. I have a complex function and I fulfill it, because that is what I do. That sounds circular because of the limitations of human language.
 "I can\'t go killing people right and left just to see what happens. When a person dies at the wrong time it takes forever to clean things up. Not that it wouldn\'t be worth it in your case. But I can tell you with certainty that killing Castlemaine would not affect the final outcome."
 "How can you say that? He\'s responsible for the whole thing." John finished off most of his beer and the Hemingway touched the mug and it refilled. "Not poison.""Wouldn\'t work," it said morosely. "I\'d gladly kill Castlemaine any way you want--cancer of the penis is a possibility--if there was even a fighting chance that it would clear things up. The reason I know it wouldn\'t is that I am not in the least attracted to that meeting. There\'s no probability nexus associate d with it, the way there was with your buying the Corona or starting the story on the train, or writing it down here. You may think that you would never have come up with the idea for the forgery on your own, but you\'re wrong."',

            '"Nope. There are universes in this bundle where Castle isn\'t involved. You may find that hard to believe, but your beliefs aren\'t important."
 John nodded noncommittally and got his faraway remembering look. "You know... reviewing in my mind all the conversations we\'ve had, all five of them, the only substantive reason you\'ve given me not to write this pastiche, and I quote, is that \'I or someone like me will have to kill you.\' Since that doesn\'t seem to be possible, why don\'t we try some other line of attack?"
 It put out the cigarette by squeezing it between thumb and forefinger. There was a smell of burning flesh. "All right, try this: give it up or I\'ll kill Pansy. Then Lena."
 "I\'ve thought of that, and I\'m gambling that you won\'t, or can\'t. You had a perfect opportunity a few days ago--maximum dramatic effect--and you didn\'t do it. Now you say it\'s an awfully complicated matter."
 "You\'re willing to gamble with the lives of the people you love?"
 "I\'m gambling with a lot. Including them." He leaned forward. "Take me into the future instead of the past. Show me what will happen if I succeed with the Hemingway hoax. If I agree that it\'s terrible, I\'ll give it all up and become a plumber."
 The old, wise Hemingway shook a shaggy head at him. "You\'re asking me to please fix it so you can swallow a piano. I can\'t. Even I can\'t go straight to the future and look around; I\'m pretty much tied to your present and past until this matter is cleared up."
 "One of the first things you said to me was that you were from the future. And the past. And \'other temporalities,\' whatever the hell that means. You were lying then?"
 "Not really." It sighed. "Let me force the analogy. Look at the piano."
 John twisted half around. "Okay."
 "You can\'t eat it--but after a fashion, I can." The piano suddenly transformed itself into a piano-shaped mountain of cold capsules, which immediately collapsed and rolled all over the floor. "Each capsule contains a pinch of sawdust or powdered ivory or metal, the whole piano in about a hundred thousand capsules. If I take one with each meal, I will indeed eat the piano, over the course of the next three hundred-some years. That\'s not a long time for me."
 "That doesn\'t prove anything."
 "It\'s not a proof, it\'s a demonstration." It reached down and picked up a capsule that was rolling by, and popped it into its mouth. "One down, 99,999 to go. So how many ways could I eat this piano?"
 "Ways?"
 "I mean I could have swallowed any of the hundred thousand first. Next I can choose any of the remaining 99,999. How many ways can--"
 "That\'s easy. One hundred thousand factorial. A huge number."
 "Go to the head of the class. It\'s <<ten|9d>> to the godzillionth power. That represents the number of possible paths--the number of futures--leading to this one guaranteed, preordained event: my eating the piano. They are all different, but in terms of whether the piano gets eaten, their differences are trivial.
 "On a larger scale, every possible trivial action that you or anybody else in this universe takes puts us into a slightly different future than would have otherwise existed. An overwhelming majority of actions, even seemingly significant ones, make no difference in the long run. All of the futures bend back to one central, unifying event--except for the ones that you\'re screwing up!"
 "So what is this big event?"
 "It\'s impossible for you to know. It\'s not important, anyhow." Actually, it would take a rather cosmic viewpoint to consider the event unimportant: the end of the world.
 Or at least the end of life on Earth. Right now there were two earnest young politicians, in the United States and Russia, who on 11 August 2006 would be President and Premier of their countries. On that day, one would insult the other beyond forgiveness, and a button would be pushed, and then another button, and by the time the sun set on Moscow, or rose on Washington, there would be nothing left alive on the planet at all--from the bottom of the ocean to the top of the atmosphere--not a cockroach, not a paramecium, not a virus, and all because there are some things a man just doesn\'t have to take, not if he\'s a real man.
 Hemingway wasn\'t the only writer who felt that way, but he was the one with the most influence on this generation. The apparition who wanted John dead or at least not typing didn\'t know exactly what effect his pastiche was going to have on Hemingway\'s influence, but it was going to be decisive and ultimately negative. It would prevent or at least delay the end of the world in a whole bundle of universes, which would put a zillion adjacent realities out of kilter, and there would be hell to pay all up and down the Omniverse. Many more people than six billion would die--and it\'s even possible that all of Reality would unravel, and collapse back to the Primordial Hiccup from whence it came.
 "If it\'s not important, then why are you so hell-bent on keeping me from preventing it? I don\'t believe you."
 "Don\'t believe me, then!" At an imperious gesture, all the capsules rolled back into the corner and reassembled into a piano, with a huge crashing chord . None of the barflies heard it. "I should think you\'d cooperate with me just to prevent the unpleasantness of dying over and over."
 John had the expression of a poker player whose opponent has inadvertently exposed his hole card. "You get used to it," he said. "And it occurs to me that sooner or later I\'ll wind up in a universe that I really like. This one doesn\'t have a hell of a lot to recommend it." His foot tapped twice and then twice again.
 "No," the Hemingway said. "It will get worse each time."
 "You can\'t know that. This has never happened before."
 "True so far, isn\'t it?"
 John considered it for a moment. "Some ways. Some ways not."
 The Hemingway shrugged and stood up. "Well. Think about my offer." The cane appeared. "Happy cancer." It tapped him on the chest and disappeared.
 The first sensation was utter tiredness, immobility. When he strained to move, pain slithered through his muscles and viscera, and stayed. He could hard ly breathe, partly because his lungs weren\'t working and partly because there was something in the way. In the mirror beside the booth he looked down his throat and saw a large white mass, veined, pulsing. He sank back into the cushion and waited. He remembered the young wounded Hemingway writing his parents from the hospital with ghastly cheerfulness: "If I should have died it would have been very easy for me. Quite the easiest thing I ever did." I don\'t know, Ernie; maybe it gets harder with practice. He felt something tear open inside and hot stinging fluid trickled through his abdominal cavity. He wiped his face and a patch of necrotic skin came off with a terrible smell. His clothes tightened as his body swelled. "Hey buddy, you okay?" The bartender came around in front of him and jumped. "Christ, Harry, punch nine-one-one!"
 John gave a slight ineffectual wave. "No rush," he croaked. The bartender cast his eyes to the ceiling. "Always on my shift?"',

            'No. He went into the next car. John Baird ran after him. Maybe that was my mistake. I translated instead of running.
 That\'s when you lost him.
 Both of them. Baird disappeared, too. Then Hadley came running in-- Don\'t confuse me with Hadleys. You checked the adjacent universes.
 All of them, yes. I think they\'re all right.
 Think?
 Well... I can\'t quite get to that moment. When I disappeared. It\'s as if I were still there for several more seconds, so I\'m excluded.
 And John Baird is still there?
 Not by the time I can insert myself. Just Hadley running around-- No Hadleys. No Hadleys. So naturally you went back to 1996.
 Of course. But there is a period of several minutes there from which I\'m excluded as well. When I can finally insert myself, John Baird is dead.
 Ah.
 In every doom line, he and Castlemaine have killed each other. John is lying there with his head blown off, Castle next to him with his heart torn out from a point-blank pistol shot, with two very distraught women screaming while police pile in through the door. And this.
 The overnight bag with the stories.
 I don\'t think anybody noticed it. With Baird dead, I could spot-check the women\'s futures; neither of them mentions the bag. So perhaps the mission is accomplished.
 Well, Reality is still here. So far. But the connection between Baird and this Hemingway entity is disturbing. That Baird is able to return to 1996 without your help is very disturbing. He has obviously taken on some of your characteristics, your abilities, which is why you\'re excluded from the last several minutes of his life.
 I\'ve never heard of that happening before.
 It never has. I think that John Baird is no more human than you and I. 
 Is? I suspect he\'s still around somewhen.


 24. ISLANDS IN THE STREAM 


 And the unending lightless desert of pain becomes suddenly one small bright spark and then everything is dark red and a taste, a bitter taste, Hoppe\'s No. 9 gun oil and the twin barrels of the fine Boss pigeon gun cold and oily on his tongue and biting hard against the roof of his mouth; the dark red is light on the other side of his eyelids, sting of pain before he bumps a tooth and opens his eyes and mouth and lowers the gun and with shaking hands unloads--no, dis-loads--both barrels and walks backwards, shuffling in the slippers, slumping, stopping to stare out into the Idaho morning dark, helpless tears coursing up from the snarled white beard, walking backwards down the stairs with the shotgun heavily cradled in his elbow, backing into the storeroom and replacing it in the rack, then back up the stairs and slowly put the keys there in plain sight on the kitchen windowsill, a bit of mercy from Miss Mary, then sit and stare at the cold bad coffee as it warms back to one acid sip-- A tiny part of the mind saying wait! 
 I am John Baird it is 1996 and back to a spiritless shower, numb to the needle spray, and cramped constipation and a sleep of no ease; an evening with Mary and George Brown tiptoeing around the blackest of black-ass worse and worse each day, only one thing to look forward to got to throw out an anchor faster now, walking through the Ketchum woods like a jerky cartoon in reverse, fucking FBI and IRS behind every tree, because you sent Ezra that money, felt sorry for him because he was crazy, what a fucking joke, should have finished the Cantos and shot himself.


 Effect preceding cause but I can read or hear scraps of thought somehow speeding to a blur now, driving in reverse hundreds of miles per hour back from Ketchum to Minnesota, the Mayo Clinic, holding the madness in while you talk to the shrink, promise not to hurt myself have to go home and write if I\'m going to beat this, figuring what he wants to hear, then the rubber mouthpiece and smell of your own hair and flesh slightly burnt by the electrodes then deep total blackness sharp stabs of thought sometimes stretching hospital days blur by in reverse, cold chrome and starch white, a couple of mouthfuls of claret a day to wash down the pills that seem to make it worse and worse what will happen to me when he\'s born?
 When they came back from Spain was when he agreed to the Mayo Clinic, still all beat-up from the plane crashes six years before in Africa, liver and spleen shot to hell, brain, too, nerves, can\'t write or can\'t stop: all day on one damned sentence for the Kennedy book but a hundred thousand fast words, pure shit, for the bullfight article. Paris book okay but stuck. Great to find the trunks in the Ritz but none of the stuff Hadley lost.
 Here it stops. A frozen tableau: Afternoon light slanting in through the tall cloudy windows of the Cambon bar, where he had liberated, would liberate, the hotel in August 1944. A good large American-style martini gulped too fast in the excitement. The two small trunks unpacked and laid out item by item. Hundreds of pages of notes that would become the Paris book. But nothing before \'23, of course, the manuscripts. The novel and the stories and the poems still gone. One moment nailed down with the juniper sting of the martini and then time crawling rolling flying backwards again-- no control?
 Months blurring by, Madrid Riviera Venice feeling sick and busted up, the plane wrecks like a quick <<one-two|5l:1>> punch brain and body, blurry sick even before them at the Finca Vigia, can\'t get a fucking thing done after the Nobel Prize, journalists day and night, the prize bad luck and bullshit anyhow but need the $35,000 damn, had to shoot Willie, cat since the boat-time before the war, but winged a burglar too, same gun, just after the Pulitzer, now that was all right slowing down again--Havana--the Floridita 
 Even Mary having a good time, and the Basque jai alai players, too, though they don\'t know much English, most of them, interesting couple of civilians, the doctor and the Kraut look-alike, but there\'s something about the boy that makes it hard to take my eyes off him, looks like someone I guess, another round of Papa Dobles, that boy, what is it about him? and then the first round, with lunch, and things speeding up to a blur again. 
 Out on the Gulf a lot, enjoying the triumph of The Old Man and the Sea, the easy good-paying work of providing fishing footage for the movie, and then back into 1951, the worst year of his life that far, weeks of grudging conciliation, uncontrollable anger, and black-ass depression from the poisonous critical slime that followed Across the River, bastards gunning for him, Harold Ross dead, mother Grace dead, son Gregory a dope addict hip-deep into the dianetics horseshit, Charlie Scribner dead but first declaring undying love for that asshole Jones most of the forties an anxious blur, Cuba Italy Cuba France Cuba China found Mary kicked Martha out, thousand pages on the fucking Eden book wouldn\'t come together Bronze Star better than Pulitzer Martha a chrome-plated bitch in Europe but war is swell otherwise, liberating the Ritz, grenades rifles pistols and bomb runs with the RAF, China boring compared to it and the Q-ship runs off Cuba, hell, maybe the bitch was right for once, just kid stuff and booze marrying the bitch was the end of my belle epoch, easy to see from here, the thirties all sunshine 
 Key West Spain Key West Africa Key West, good hard writing with Pauline holding down the store, good woman but sorry I had to sorry I had to divorce stopping Walking Paris streets <<after midnight|13>>: I was never going to throw back at her losing the manuscripts. 
 Told Steffens that would be like blaming a human for the weather, or death. These things happen. Nor say anything about what I did the night after I found out she really had lost them. But this one time we got to shouting and I think I hurt her. Why the hell did she have to bring the carbons what the hell did she think carbons were for - stupid stupid stupid and she crying and she giving me hell about Pauline 
 Jesus any woman who could fuck up Paris for you could fuck up a royal flush it slows down around the manuscripts or me -- golden years the mid-twenties everything clicks Paris Vorarlburg Paris Schruns Paris Pamplona Paris Madrid Paris Lausanne couldn\'t believe she actually most of a novel dozens of poems stories sketches--contes, Kitty called them by God woman you show me your conte and I\'ll show you mine so drunk that night I know better than to drink that much absinthe so drunk I was half crawling going up the stairs to the apartment I saw weird I saw God I saw I saw myself standing there on the fourth landing with Hadley\'s goddamn bag.
 I waited almost an hour, that seemed like no time or all time, and when he, when I, when he came crashing up the stairs he blinked twice, then I walked through me groping, shook my head without looking back and managed to get the door unlocked flying back through the dead winter French countryside, standing in the bar car fighting hopelessness to Hadley crying so hard she can\'t get out what was wrong with Steffens standing gaping like a fish in a bowl twisting again, painlessly inside out, I suppose through various dimensions, seeing the man\'s life as one complex chord of beauty and purpose and ugliness and chaos, my life on one side of the Mobius strip consistent through its fading forty-year span, starting, starting, here: the handsome young man sits on the floor of the apartment holding himself, rocking racked with sobs, one short manuscript crumpled in front of him, the room a mess with drawers pulled out, their contents scattered on the floor, it\'s like losing an arm, a leg (a foot a testicle), it\'s like losing your youth and along with youth with a roar he stands up, eyes closed fists clenched, wipes his face dry and stomps over to the window breathes deeply until he\'s breathing normally strides across the room, kicking a brassiere out of his way stands with his hand on the knob and thinks this: life can break you but you can grow back strong at the broken places and goes out slamming the door behind him, somewhat conscious of having been present at his own birth.
 With no effort I find myself standing earlier that day in the vestibule of a train. Hadley is walking away, tired, looking for a vendor. I turn and confront two aspects of myself.
 "Close your mouth, John. You\'ll catch flies."
 They both stand paralyzed while I slide open the door and pull the overnight bag from under the seat. I walk away and the universe begins to tingle and sparkle.I spend forever in the black void between timespaces. I am growing to enjoy it. I appear in John Baird\'s apartment and set down the bag. I look at the empty chair in front of the old typewriter, the green beer bottle sweating cold next to it, and John Baird appears, looking dazed, and I have business elsewhere, else-when. A train to catch. I\'ll come back for the bag in twelve minutes or a few millennia, after the bloodbath that gives birth to us all.',
