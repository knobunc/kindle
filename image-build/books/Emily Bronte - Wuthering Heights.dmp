            "\x{2018}I\x{2019}ve been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I\x{2019}ve never missed going a day since you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your room. I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening, and to put her back in the stable; you mustn\x{2019}t scold him either, mind. I was at the Heights by <<half-past six|10>>, and generally stayed till <<half-past eight|10>>, and then gallopped home. It was not to amuse myself that I went; I was often wretched all the time. Now and then, I was happy, once in a week perhaps. At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading you to let me keep my word to Linton, for I had engaged to call again next day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed upstairs on the morrow, I escaped that trouble; and while Michael was refastening the lock of the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and couldn\x{2019}t come to the Grange: and how papa would object to my going. And then I negotiated with him about the pony. He is fond of reading, and he thinks of leaving soon to get married, so he offered, if I would lend him books out of the library, to do what I wished; but I preferred giving him my own, and that satisfied him better.",

I went at <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and walked, fancying I might manage to creep into the house, and up to Linton\x{2019}s room, unobserved. However, the dogs gave notice of my approach: Zillah received me, and saying \x{201c}the lad was mending nicely,\x{201d} showed me into a small, tidy, carpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid on a little sofa, reading one of my books. But he would neither speak to me, nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen \x{2013} He has such an unhappy temper \x{2013} and what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth it was to utter the falsehood, that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was not to blame!",
