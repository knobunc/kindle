During his minority, the government was in the hands of Cardinal Mazarin, whose unpopularity was one cause of the rebellions known as the Fronde (1648\x{2013}1653). During this tumultuous period, the Thirty Years\x{2019} War came to a close(1648), and by the peace of Westphalia, in which Mazarin played an important role, France gained the German province of Alsace. On the death of Mazarin(1661), Louis engaged Colbert as minister of finances but otherwise assumed the full burden of government. His policy was to increase the prestige and prosperity of the country by concentrating all power in himself. From 1667 almost to the end of his reign, Louis involved France in wars of territorial expansion that embroiled most of the countries of Europe and finally exhausted his state. He was a munificent patron of science, commerce, the arts, and literature, but displayed a zealous intolerance toward religious nonconformers. His revocation, in 1685, of the Edict of Nantes (a declaration of religious toleration) resulted in the mass emigration of Huguenots (French Protestants). Despite numerous military losses and failures of internal administration, Louis XIV, \"the Sun King,\" is generally acknowledged to have been the greatest monarch in French history.",

In 1523, he was appointed legate to Rome, but when he failed to win papal consent to Henry\x{2019}s divorce from Catherine of Aragon he fell from the king\x{2019}s favor.

Designated \"Defender of the Faith\"(1521) by Pope Leo X for his writings against Martin Luther and the Protestant movement, Henry nevertheless fell afoul of the Catholic church when he sought, with Wolsey\x{2019}s help, to annul his marriage to Catherine, who failed to give him a male heir. He was secretly married to Anne Boleyn in 1533, and his consequent excommunication by the church led to passage of the Act of Supremacy, creation of the Church of England, and the very lucrative state confiscation of monastic property. By sponsoring the English reformation and by ruthlessly defending his position at the head of the English church, Henry accelerated the centralization of governmental power in the crown. He was succeeded by his son, Edward VI.",

Venice,in later times, figured more than once in wars of ambition\x{2026}: A coastal city in northeastern Italy, Venice was founded by refugees from the Lombard invasions in the fifth century AD. With a favorable position on the Adriatic, Venice came to dominate the sea routes to the Holy Land and thereby gained enormous power and wealth from the Crusades. The chief executive of the city, known as the Doge, derived his authority from the people, but until the twelfth century suffrage was severely limited. By <<1160|9:0>>, in response to the burdens created by increasing territory and a growing economy, the city had adopted a republican form of government. This consisted of a Great Council of Forty-five (handling all political and administrative matters), a Doge (acting as a servant of the state rather than as a monarch), a Minor Council of Six (acting alongside the Doge), and various individual magistrates (to deal with judicial and administrative matters). <<Around 1300|9u>>, Venice restricted participation in government to families that had previously performed the duties of magistrates. Fears of the resulting concentration of power led soon afterwards to the formation of the Council of Ten(1310), which was intended to defend the existing regime. By the sixteenth century, Venice had become a virtual oligarchy, and political stagnation combined with the expansion of the Ottoman Empire and the discovery of the New World brought about a steady decline in Venetian status. After brief periods under French and then Austrian rule, Venice became part of modern Italy in 1866.",

In 1512, with the help now of Swiss and Spanish troops, he succeeded in ridding Italy of the French, but immediately faced the peril of conciliating these new friends.

The diet was summoned by the emperor (later, only with consent of the electors) to hear an imperial proposition.

The United Netherlandsare a confederacy of republics, or rather of aristocracies\x{2026}: \"The United Provinces of the Netherlands\" is the formal designation of a state in northwestern Europe that endured for about two centuries. Also known as the Dutch Republic, the United Provinces were sometimes misleadingly referred to as Holland, the name of the largest member of the union. The republic enjoyed spectacular success in the seventeenth century when it was a maritime power of the first order, traded throughout Europe and East Asia, and fostered significant artistic and intellectual achievement. For all of its success, however, the Dutch Republic rested on a precarious system of government. Its foundation was the Union of Utrecht (1579), an alliance intended originally only to strengthen resistance against Spanish rule among the seven northern provinces of the Netherlands. The rebellion of the Netherlands began in 1566, when some two hundred Protestant and Catholic nobles of the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands petitioned their Hapsburg ruler, Philip II of Spain, not to employ the Spanish Inquisition in their lands. He demurred, riots erupted in the provinces, and Philip dispatched the Duke of Alva, Spanish troops, and the Inquisition in order to restore order. William of Orange, Philip\x{2019}s stadtholder or deputy in the province of Holland, soon became the leader of the revolt. By 1576, the Netherlands was engaged in all-out war to drive the Spanish out. Due to diplomatic efforts by the Duke of Parma, whom Philip appointed governor-general of the Netherlands in 1578, however, the ten southern provinces were reconciled to a milder form of Spanish rule in 1579. The seven northern provinces, decidedly more Calvinist, responded by forming the Union of Utrecht that same year. In 1581, they formally declared their independence from Spain, calling themselves the United Provinces of the Netherlands (the southern states became the Spanish Netherlands). The fighting continued until <<1609|9c:0>>, when a Twelve Years\x{2019} Truce was concluded. Under the Union, each province remained sovereign in matters of internal concern. Yet with respect to matters of foreign policy and taxation, and assuming unanimous consent in the States-General, the provinces acted as one.",

Originally, the stadtholders were appointed by the central government (the dukes of Burgundy and, later, the kings of Spain), but when the northern Netherlands revolted, the office became elective. At first, the States-General elected the stadtholder; later, elections took place in the provincial States. The office soon became associated with the house of Orange-Nassau. <<After 1747|9:0>>, the stadtholdership became hereditary in the house of Orange-Nassau. Besides settling differences between provinces, the stadtholder commanded the military forces of the confederacy. In practice the provinces often resorted to the stadtholder when the confederacy proved incapable of concerted action.

This language, at the present day, would appear as wild as a great part of what we now hear from the same quarter will be thought, when we shall have received further lessons from that best oracle of wisdom, experience. It at all times betrayed an ignorance of the true springs by which human conduct is actuated, and belied the original inducements to the establishment of civil power. Why has government been instituted at all? Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint. Has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals? The contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind; and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons. Regard to reputation has a less active influence when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon <<one|9c:1>>.

            "I SHALL here, perhaps, be reminded of a current observation \"that where annual elections end, tyranny begins.\" If it be true, as has often been remarked, that sayings which become proverbial are generally founded in reason, it is not less true that when once established they are often applied to cases to which the reason of them does not extend. I need not look for a proof beyond the case before us. What is the reason on which this proverbial observation is founded? No man will subject himself to the ridicule of pretending that any natural connection subsists between the sun or the seasons, and the period within which human virtue can bear the temptations of power. Happily for mankind, liberty is not, in this respect, confined to any single point of time, but lies within extremes, which afford sufficient latitude for all the variations which may be required by the various situations and circumstances of civil society. The election of magistrates might be, if it were found expedient, as in some instances it actually has been, daily, weekly, or monthly, as well as annual; and if circumstances may require a deviation from the rule on one side, why not also on the other side? Turning our attention to the periods established among ourselves, for the election of the most numerous branches of the State legislatures, we find them by no means coinciding any more in this instance than in the elections of other civil magistrates. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, the periods are half-yearly. In the other States, South Carolina excepted, they are annual. In South Carolina they are biennial\x{2014}as is proposed in the federal government. Here is a difference, as <<four to one|10a:0>>, between the longest and shortest periods; and yet it would be not easy to show, that Connecticut or Rhode Island is better governed, or enjoys a greater share of rational liberty, than South Carolina; or that either the one or the other of these States is distinguished in these respects, and by these causes, from the States whose elections are different from both.",

            'If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy only would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several State constitutions, they would find little less room for disquietude and alarm from the latitude which most of them allow in respect to elections than from the latitude which is proposed to be allowed to the national government in the same respect. A review of their situation, in this particular, would tend greatly to remove any ill impressions which may remain in regard to this matter. But as that view would lead into long and tedious details, I shall content myself with the single example of the State in which I write. The constitution of New York makes no other provision for locality of elections than that the members of the Assembly shall be elected in the counties; those of the Senate, in the great districts into which the State is or may be divided: these at present are four in number and comprehend each from <<two to six|10a:0>> counties. It may readily be perceived that it would not be more difficult to the legislature of New York to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of New York by confining elections to particular places than for the legislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of the Union by the like expedient. Suppose, for instance, the city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of election for the county and district of which it is a part, would not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors of the members both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and district? Can we imagine that the electors who reside in the remote subdivisions of the counties of Albany, Saratoga, Cambridge, etc., or in any part of the county of Montgomery, would take the trouble to come to the city of Albany to give their votes for members of the Assembly or Senate sooner than they would repair to the city of New York to participate in the choice of the members of the federal House of Representatives? The alarming indifference discoverable in the exercise of so invaluable a privilege under the existing laws, which afford every facility to it, furnishes a ready answer to this question. And, abstracted from any experience on the subject, we can be at no loss to determine that when the place of election is at an inconvenient distance from the elector, the effect upon his conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles or twenty thousand miles. Hence it must appear that objections to the particular modification of the federal power of regulating elections will, in substance, apply with equal force to the modification of the like power in the constitution of this State; and for this reason it will be impossible to acquit the one and to condemn the other. A similar comparison would lead to the same conclusion in respect to the constitutions of most of the other States.',
