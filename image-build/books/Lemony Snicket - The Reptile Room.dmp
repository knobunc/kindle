His face seemed even brighter than usual, and he was holding a small bunch of folded papers in one hand. \"Stephano has only worked here one day, and he's already in the Reptile Room. In fact, he was up before I was\x{2014}I ran into him on my way down the stairs. He's an eager beaver. But you three\x{2014}you're moving like the Hungarian Sloth Snake, whose top speed is half an inch per hour! We have lots to do today, and I'd like to catch the <<six o'clock|6>> showing of Zombies in the Snow tonight, so let's try to hurry, hurry, hurry.\"",

He raised one hand and waved the folded papers in the air. "As you know," he said, "tomorrow we are leaving for Peru. These are our tickets for the <<five o\'clock|6>> voyage on the Prospero, a fine ship that will take us across the sea to South America. There\'s a ticket for me, one for Violet, one for Klaus, one for Stephano, but not one for Sunny because we\'re going to hide her in a suitcase to save money."',

But they\'ll be long gone. Speaking of which, it\'s time to leave. The Prospero sails at <<five o\'clock|6>> from Hazy Harbor and I\'d like to be the first passenger aboard.

"When I turn eighteen, as we all know," Violet continued, ignoring Stephano entirely, "I inherit the Baudelaire fortune, and Stephano intended to get that fortune for himself. It would be easier to do so if we were in a location that was more difficult to trace, such as Peru." Violet held up the small bunch of folded papers.
