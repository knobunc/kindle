There was the decision to tar some of the dirt roads in the 1920s, which helped. There was the coming of the telephone in the 1930s, which only a few could initially afford. Otherwise, very little. The railroad long since passed Sandisfield by. The stagecoach was infrequent. The local inns had fallen into disrepair. The store was moribund. There was little attempt ever made to bring the townspeople together\x{2014}until <<2010|9c:0>>, when the newspaper arrived. Then, almost overnight, an untapped vein of mutual feeling and goodwill was tapped. The town changed, its people becoming suddenly welded into one, turned to a single purpose with a new, united identity.",
