            'The manuscript (now known as MS Cotton Nero A, Art. 3) contains three other poems, all in the same fine, precise, slightly ornate script. Scholars believe that the writing dates from <<around 1400|9c:0>>. It is the hand of someone used to writing, which suggests a cleric or someone resident in a monastery, or at least trained by priests. The other three poems in the same manuscript, Purity, Patience, and Pearl, use their stories as vehicles of Christian exhortation and piety. We do not know that the person who copied out the four poems had actually composed any of them, or that they had all been written by the same poet, but from stylistic and temperamental affinities in them, most scholars have concluded that the same gifted person was the author of all of them.',

            'If it was <<around 1400|18:0>> that they were written out into one manuscript, either by the author or by a copyist, they must have been in existence for some time before that, through the later years of the fourteenth century, a hundred years before Columbus\'s fateful voyage. So they may have been written during Chaucer\'s lifetime, but scholars agree that Chaucer probably never knew any of them. The language of the poems is highly sophisticated, and they display a telling mastery of poetic and narrative form; yet they seem more archaic, more remote from modern English, than anything in Chaucer.',

            'From the scholars\' opinion that the same poet wrote all the poems I derive an image of him in later life making a fair copy of what he had written in earlier years. The intimate, grisly knowledge of the hunt and the familiarity with late-thirteenth-century castle architecture and armor suggest that the author was a man, though the lais of Marie de France, written in the late twelfth century, should save us from assuming that too readily. In the late nineteenth century there was disagreement among some scholars as to the chronological order in which the poems probably had been composed. They hoped to be able to derive from that progression some understanding of the poet\'s life. By <<1918|9:0>>, when Hartley Bateson published his edition of Patience, they were coming to rely on considerations of meter in the different poems to suggest the most plausible order of their composition. They concluded that Purity and Patience, written in the stressed alliterative line that was a descendant of Anglo-Saxon poetry, were the ones that had been written first.',

Both are of Celtic origin: Welsh, Irish, or both. There are several earlier forms of the challenge story. One occurs in a Middle Irish narrative, Bricriu's Feast, that dates from <<around 1100|9c:0>>. Jessie L. Weston, in The Legend of Sir Perceval, tells of a French source of the challenge in a romance originally composed by a Welsh poet named Bleddri, who was famous in his day for his knowledge of the \x{201c}tales of the British kings and nobles.\x{201d} Another French source, with a Welsh antecedent, may have been Le Livre de Cardoc, part of the unfinished twelfth-century Perceval of Chr\x{e9}tien de Troyes.",
