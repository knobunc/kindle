I spent the night in the cold cab on the hard seat, with one break along <<near midnight|9h>> for supper at a little inn high in the hills. Karhide is no country for comfort.

They were practicing the Handdara discipline of Presence, which is a kind of trance\x{2014}the Handdarata, given to negatives, call it an untrance\x{2014}involving self-loss (self-augmentation?) through extreme sensual receptiveness and awareness.

In the evenings there might be a gathering in the hearth-room of one or another of the low, tree-surrounded houses; there was conversation, and beer, and there might be music, the vigorous music of Karhide, melodically simple but rhythmically complex, always played extempore. One night two Indwellers danced, men so old that their hair had whitened, and their limbs were skinny, and the downward folds at the outer eye-corners half hid their dark eyes. Their dancing was slow, precise, controlled; it fascinated eye and mind. They began dancing during Third Hour after dinner. Musicians joined in and dropped out at will, all but the drummer who never stopped his subtle changing beat. The two old dancers were still dancing at Sixth Hour, <<midnight|13>>, after five Terran hours.
