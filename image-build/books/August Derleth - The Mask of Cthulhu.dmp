For a moment there was no sound whatever; then it came again, irregularly, broken\x{2014}a step, a pause, two steps in fairly quick succession, an odd sucking noise. Disturbed, I got up and went to the open window. The night was warm, and the still air almost sultry; far to the northeast a beacon cut an arc upon the sky, and from the distant north came the faint drone of a night plane. It was already <<past midnight|13>>; low in the east shone red Aldebaran and the Pleiades, but I did not at that time, as I did later, connect the disturbances I heard to the appearance of the Hyades above the horizon.",

A police guard had been established, but I was permitted to examine the premises as soon as my identity had been disclosed. The newspaper account, I found, had been shockingly inadequate, for the ruin of the Tuttle vault was virtually complete, its coffins exposed to the sun\x{2019}s warmth, some of them broken open, revealing long-dead bones. While it was true that Amos Tuttle\x{2019}s coffin had disappeared in the night, it had been found at <<midday|13>> in an open field about two miles east of Arkham, too far from the road to have been carried there; and the mystery of its being there was, if anything, deeper now than at the time the coffin had been found; for an investigation had disclosed certain deep indentations set at wide intervals in the earth, some of them as much as forty feet in diameter! It was as if some monstrous creature had walked there, though I confess that this thought occurred only within my own mind; the impressions in the earth remained a mystery upon which no light was thrown even by the wildest surmises as to their source. This may have been partly due to the more startling fact that had emerged immediately upon the finding of the coffin: the body of Amos Tuttle had vanished, and a search of the surrounding terrain had failed to disclose it. So much I learned from the custodian of the cemetery before I set out along the Aylesbury Road, refusing to think further about this incredible information until I had spoken with Paul Tuttle.",

Since everyone else to whom he had talked mentioned having heard the whippoorwills, he was not surprised. He volunteered the information that Jethro Corey had awakened in the night and had heard the cows bellowing, but before he could get dressed to go down they had stopped; so he had assumed they had been disturbed by some animal passing through the pasture\x{2014}the hills abounded in fox and raccoon\x{2014}and had gone back to bed.

Or was his pursuit merely the quest of a man steeped in idleness? My uncle\x{2019}s library consisted of many books, ranging through the world\x{2019}s literature; yet one considerable section of his shelving was given over completely to books on occult subjects, books of strange beliefs and even stranger facts, inexplicable to science, books on little-known religious cults; and these were supplemented by huge scrapbooks of clippings from newspapers and magazines, reading which filled me at <<one|9c:1>> and the same time with a sense of premonitory dread and a flame of compulsive joy. For in these prosaically reported facts there lay oddly convincing evidence to augment belief in the myth-pattern to which my uncle had patently subscribed.",

            "After Ada Marsh left that day, I turned once more to my uncle\x{2019}s papers. I did not leave them until long <<past midnight|13>>, but by that time I had gone through most of them cursorily, and some of them with the closest attention. I found it difficult to believe what I read, yet clearly my Uncle Sylvan had not only believed it, but seemed actually to have taken some part in it himself. He had dedicated himself early in life to the search for the sunken kingdom, he professed openly a devotion to Cthulhu, and, most suggestive of all, his writings contained many times chilling hints of enounters\x{2014} sometimes in the ocean\x{2019}s depths, sometimes in the streets of legend-haunted Arkham, an ancient, gambrel-roofed town which lay inland from Innsmouth, not far from the coast along the Miskatonic River, or in nearby Dunwich, or even Innsmouth\x{2014}with men\x{2014}or beings which were not men\x{2014}I could hardly tell which\x{2014}who believed as he did and were bound in the same dark bondage to this resurgent myth from the distant past.",

            "But my uncle\x{2019}s papers were on the one hand too diffuse to make a coherent statement, and on the other too plain to enlist immediate belief. What disturbed me immediately most of all were the repeated hints that his home, this home, was a \x{201c}haven,\x{201d} a \x{201c}point\x{201d} of contact, an \x{201c}opening to that which lies below\x{201d}; and the speculations about the \x{201c}breathing\x{201d} of the house and the rocky bluff which were so often to be found in the early pages of his notes, and to which no reference whatsoever was made later on. What he had set down was baffling and challenging, fearsome and wonderful; it filled me with awe and at <<one|9c:0>> and the same time an angry disbelief and a wild wish to believe, to know.",
