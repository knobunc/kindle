The geography of this footprint of Madison was virtually the same as West 5, of course. Here was the Capitol mound, and a short walk away, no doubt, they would find the lake. But there was no sophisticated development here, just tracks cutting through the prairie towards the lake shore. It seemed odd that such a nearby world should be so empty. But even after the great exodus of people that had followed the Yellowstone eruption and the evacuation of the Datum, just the first dozen or so worlds to East or West had soaked up almost all the fleeing population. Each world, after all, was a whole Earth the size of the original, each stepwise America a continental wilderness to match the homeland.',

They drove between diamond cliffs, their very surfaces complex textures of facets and panels. The material was mostly clear, it really was like quartz or diamond, and the captured sunlight, multiply reflected, emerged as a cool-blue glow. Joshua had crossed Earths trapped in Ice Ages; very old ice could look like this, he knew, shining like walls of blue light. Yet he glimpsed structure in there producing light of its own, winking stars like trapped constellations. Every so often they drove over structures crossing the road, like speed bumps but with more texture \x{2013} fallen glassy pillars.
