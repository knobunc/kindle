            'Ali wondered if they\'d run this problem past Jellico, but he glanced at the triple chrono he\'d set up. Three time measures flashed: <<one|9k:0>>, the North Star\'s orbital pattern, displaying when the ship was in communication range and when it wasn\'t, and how long in and out of each cycle remained. The second display was Terran biological time, the twenty-four-hour cycle on which their bodies\' internal clocks centered in permanent obedience to the rhythms of distant Earth. The third was Hesprid IV\'s time-the nineteen-hour day divided up into twenty-four "hours" of about forty-five Standard Minutes each.',
