A floating sailor could dispatch a curious shark by hitting it or churning the water with his legs. (Baldridge observed that even a kick to a shark\x{2019}s nose from the rear leg of a swimming rat was enough to cause a \x{201c}startled response and rapid departure from the vicinity.\x{201d}) \x{201c}The sharks were going after dead men,\x{201d} said a survivor quoted in a popular book about the 1945 sinking of the USS Indianapolis, an event that often comes up in discussions of military shark attacks. \x{201c}Honestly, in the entire <<110 hours|1>> I was in the water,\x{201d} recalls Navy Captain Lewis L. Haynes, in an oral history conducted by the US Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, \x{201c}I did not see a man attacked by a shark. . . .\x{201d} They seemed to have been, he said, \x{201c}satisfied with the dead.\x{201d} Haynes says fifty-six mutilated bodies were recovered, but there\x{2019}s nothing to suggest that any more than a few of them were bitten into while alive.",

As anyone who has slept on an airplane knows, it\x{2019}s possible to maintain muscle tone while sleeping\x{2014}that is, until you slip into REM sleep, during which muscles relax.

What\x{2019}s unusual about this ham supper is that it took place in a cave 119 feet underground. Kleitman, with a graduate student assisting, spent thirty-two days in Kentucky\x{2019}s Mammoth Cave investigating the cycles of human sleep and wakefulness. He wished to find out: to what extent are these rhythms tied to external cues and routines? If you took away the cues\x{2014}sunlight, established mealtimes, regular business hours\x{2014}could people slip easily into an altered routine? Going underground seemed like the easiest\x{a7} path to an answer.",

Lieutenant Kate Couturier, a circadian rhythm researcher at NSMRL, outfitted a planeload of Navy SEALs with blue light\x{2013}emitting goggles on a series of flights from Guam to the East Coast of the United States, to see if it were possible to make them unattractive to females, oops, I mean, to keep them on Guam time.

            "It is probably fair to say that circadian dysrhythmia affects alertness and performance as much as or more than the amount of sleep a person has been getting. In the late 1990s, a team of sleep researchers and statisticians from Stanford University analyzed twenty-five seasons of Monday Night Football scores. Because the games were played at <<9:00 p.m.|2a>> eastern standard time, West Coast players were essentially competing at <<6:00 p.m.|2a>>\x{2014}a time chronobiologically closer to the body\x{2019}s late afternoon peak for physical performance.\x{b6} As the researchers predicted, West Coast teams were shown to have won more often and by more points per game.
