Says he was walking in the Marylebone Road, but the first thing he can prove is having a drink in a pub at <<five past one|10>>.

            "\x{201c}It must have been getting on for <<half past twelve|10>>, sir. And just as I was thinking: There now, it\x{2019}s Frank Carter, and Miss Nevill\x{2019}s away for the day and won\x{2019}t he be disappointed, and I was wondering if I ought to run down and tell him because it looked as though that lump of an Alfred had forgot, otherwise I thought he wouldn\x{2019}t have been waiting for her. And just as I was hesitating, Mr. Carter, he seemed to make up his mind, and he slipped down the stairs very quick and went along the passage towards the master\x{2019}s surgery, and I thought to myself, the master won\x{2019}t like that, and I wondered if there was going to be a row, but just then Emma called me, said whatever was I up to? and I went up again and then, afterwards, I heard the master had shot himself and, of course, it was so awful it just drove everything out of my head. But later, when that Police Inspector had gone I said to Emma, I said, I didn\x{2019}t say anything about Mr. Carter having been up with the master this morning, and she said was he? and I told her, and she said well, perhaps I ought to tell, but anyway I said I\x{2019}d better wait a bit, and she agreed, because neither of us didn\x{2019}t want to get Frank Carter into trouble if we could help. And then, when it came to the inquest and it come out that the master had made that mistake in a drug and really had got the wind up and shot himself, quite natural-like\x{2014}well, then, of course, there was no call to say anything. But reading that piece in the paper two days ago\x{2014}Oh! it did give me a turn! And I said to myself, \x{2018}If he\x{2019}s one of those loonies that thinks they\x{2019}re persecuted and goes round shooting people, well, then maybe he did shoot the master after all!\x{2019}\x{201d}",
