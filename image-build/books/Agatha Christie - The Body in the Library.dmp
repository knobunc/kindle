            "\x{201c}Smart old Pussy, she\x{2019}s on to it! Good job we\x{2019}ve got that hearthrug. That and finding out from the car-park man at the studio that he left that party at eleven instead of <<midnight|13>>. Don\x{2019}t think those friends of his meant to commit perjury. They were bottled and Blake told \x{2019}em firmly the next day it was <<twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>> when he left and they believed him. Well, his goose is cooked good and proper! Mental, I expect! Broadmoor, not hanging. First the Reeves kid, probably strangled her, drove her out to the quarry, walked back into Danemouth, picked up his own car in some side lane, drove to this party, then back to Danemouth, brought Ruby Keene out here, strangled her, put her in old Bantry\x{2019}s library, then probably got the wind up about the car in the quarry, drove there, set it on fire, and got back here. Mad\x{2014}sex and blood lust\x{2014}lucky this girl\x{2019}s escaped. What they call recurring mania, I expect.\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}After dinner Mark Gaskell went out in his car\x{2014}to the seafront, he said. That is when he took Pamela\x{2019}s body to the cottage dressed in one of Ruby\x{2019}s old dresses and arranged it on the hearthrug. She was still unconscious, but not dead, when he strangled her with the belt of the frock \x{2026} Not nice, no\x{2014}but I hope and pray she knew nothing about it. Really, I feel quite pleased to think of him being hanged \x{2026} That must have been <<just after ten o\x{2019}clock|10>>. Then he drove back at top speed and found the others in the lounge where Ruby Keene, still alive, was dancing her exhibition dance with Raymond.",

She probably finished the girl off then\x{2014}with an injection, perhaps, or a blow on the back of the head.
