            "Born in Hassocks, Sussex in 1904, Patrick Hamilton was the youngest of three children. At the age of seventeen he began to train as an actor before realising that his talents lay in literature. In 1925, at the age of nineteen, he published his first novel Monday Morning, two more followed in quick succession, and he began to be admired and widely read. His first theatrical success was Rope (1929) on which Alfred Hitchcock\x{2019}s film of the same name was based. His play Gaslight was also adapted for the big screen starring Ingrid Bergman. His novels include The <<Midnight|13>> Bell, The Siege of Pleasure, The Plains of Cement (a trilogy later published together under the title Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky), Hangover Square and The Slaves of Solitude.",

            "The <<Midnight|13>> Bell, a pub on the Euston Road, is the pulse of this brilliant and compassionate trilogy. It is here where the barman, Bob, falls in love with Jenny, a West End prostitute who comes in off the streets for a gin and pep. Around his obsessions, and Ella the barmaid\x{2019}s secret love for him, swirls the sleazy life of London in the 1930s. This is a world where people emerge from cheap lodgings in Pimlico to pour out their passions, hopes and despair in pubs and bars \x{2013} a world of twenty thousand streets full of cruelty and kindness, comedy and pathos, wasted dreams and lost desires.",

            "PATRICK HAMILTON WROTE this London trilogy when in his middle and late twenties. The <<Midnight|13>> Bell, The Siege of Pleasure and The Plains of Cement are each self-contained and were first published separately before being collected in 1935 under the title Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky. The <<Midnight|13>> Bell, which appeared in 1929 when the author was still twenty-four, is by far the most autobiographical of the three books. The tension of the narrative rises and in the last pages breaks through the structure of the novel, involving us in the emotional wreckage of Patrick Hamilton\x{2019}s life.",

We are spared none of its detailed tortures or griefs, betrayals and deceits, in this anatomy of humiliation that brings us to the frontiers of Patrick Hamilton\x{2019}s famous psychological thrillers for the stage, Rope and Gaslight, and his classic murder novel Hangover Square. \x{2018}Her perfect cruelty and egotism appalled him . . . He would kill her.\x{2019} But there are to be no murders in this trilogy, for it is the endurance of ordinary life that we are being shown. What The <<Midnight|13>> Bell loses in detachment, it gains in intensity. The appalling monster-bores of this pub are excruciatingly observed and intimately known. As we follow the intricately plotted inanities of their tales, which divert us by driving the other characters to distraction, we do not overhear them from a distance, but are brought into their very presence.",

            "The Siege of Pleasure (1932) is the story of Jenny Maple\x{2019}s first step down from respectable servant girl towards prostitution. \x{2018}Jever hear of Bernard Shaw? . . . He wrote a book called Mrs Warren\x{2019}s Profession \x{2013} an\x{2019} showed it was all economics,\x{2019} Bob, the waiter of \x{2018}The <<Midnight|13>> Bell\x{2019}, tells her \x{2013} to which she replies: \x{2018}I guess he was just about right.\x{2019} The economic point is well made in The Siege of Pleasure, which portrays the meagre and pleasureless conditions of her servant life as a form of socially acceptable, class-regimented prostitution. By describing as the place of her employment his own suburban home in Chiswick, and giving portraits of his nerveless mother and eccentric aunt as her employers, together with a fearful silhouette of his father (pathetically fallen away after a stroke and the unwelcome double success of Rope and The <<Midnight|13>> Bell), he aligns his own escape with Jenny\x{2019}s to make it all the more comprehensible.",

            "Between the writing of The <<Midnight|13>> Bell and The Siege of Pleasure, Patrick Hamilton managed to free himself from his debilitating passion for Lily. He was helped in bringing his life under control by a sensible, if passionless, marriage in 1930 to a woman who was also in retreat from an unsatisfactory romance. Having reduced his drinking, he was in good spirits when, in January 1932, walking along Earl\x{2019}s Court Road with his wife and sister, he was knocked down and critically injured by a car. For a time his life was in danger, but after some months he made the best recovery possible, though he was left with a withered arm and, despite plastic surgery, marks and scars on his face, particularly his nose, which had been almost torn off. He added the accident to his final draft of The Siege of Pleasure, equating those who had done him emotional damage with those who had damaged him physically.",

            "For almost two years following the completion of The Siege of Pleasure, he was unable to write anything new. Then, in a sudden concentration of creative energy, he completed the trilogy with a wonderfully balanced and accomplished novel developing a subsidiary plot from The <<Midnight|13>> Bell. Also centred in the pub, The Plains of Cement (1934) is Ella the barmaid\x{2019}s story, which complements Bob\x{2019}s story and brings a deeper perspective to the themes of Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky. Although apparently disinherited from the privileges of romance by her plain looks and financially disadvantaged by her background of lower-class poverty, this sensible girl is not without her dreams of a better emotional and economic life. But, unlike Bob and Jenny, she struggles to keep these tempting fantasies under control. She is secretly in love with Bob but endeavours to keep this a secret even from herself. She has it in her to feel for him what he feels for Jenny, for although \x{2018}a placid and efficient girl, she also worshipped at the shrine of pure beauty and romance\x{2019}. Knowing nothing of Jenny, she believes that \x{2018}any girl with eyes in her head would be after\x{2019} Bob, but schools herself to accept that she can never hope to attract his attention. \x{2018}She was, she found, incapable of inspiring his tenderness.\x{2019}",

            "The fact that all this should not depress the reader is a tribute to the power of Patrick Hamilton\x{2019}s storytelling and the exhilaration of his humour. In the earlier pages there are signs of immaturity \x{2013} some passages of overdeliberation, moments of facetiousness, and an anxious reliance on what J. B. Priestley called Komic Kapitals. But as the book progresses, wonderfully comic scenes proliferate. Mr. Eccles, in particular, is a character of Dickensian proportions \x{2013} Mr. Eccles who lives so intensely through his new hat that \x{2018}it cost him sharp torture even to put it on his head, where he could not see it\x{2019}, who when looking for his visiting card is \x{2018}not unlike a parrot diving into its feathers\x{2019}, who creates a \x{2018}private cloakroom for his innumerable accessories whenever he sits down\x{2019}, who polishes his dignity on a lurching bus \x{2018}by peering and looking back in a critical way out of the window, rather as though London was being partially managed by him, and he had to see that the buildings were in their right places\x{2019}. But though Mr. Eccles hardly ever fails to utter the most subtle drivel, he is no one-dimensional character. Touchy, crippled by shyness, desperately lonely and absurd, he too has his dreams of redemption. We feel compassion for anyone who meets him, but are also made to feel compassion for the man himself. He is used to give retrospective detachment to The <<Midnight|13>> Bell, for his wooing of Ella is another version of Bob\x{2019}s pursuit of Jenny, and it provokes a similar reaction: \x{2018}We all have to take these risks.\x{2019}",

The coast, implicitly and strangely, was that of Spain. He was leaning over the side and peacefully savouring the phase of the journey \x{2013} a phase which he knew well. It was that curiously dreamlike and uninspiring phase in which the familiarity and proximity of the coast yet steals all venturesomeness from the undertaking, and in which the climax of departure is dying down, to the level tune of winds and waves and motion, into the throbbing humdrum of voyage. That throbbing would continue for weeks and weeks. . . . A strong wind was blowing, buffeting his ears, roaring over the green waves, and rendering utterly silent and unreal the land he had just left. He was extraordinarily cold, and a trifle sick. But he did not want to move \x{2013} indeed he could not move.

Around each table were three or four white wicker armchairs, and on each table there lay a large stone ash-tray supplied by a Whisky firm.

Bob was never quite sure as to whether he was allowed to accept drinks from customers in this way, but it was always being done. He was very popular.

This was his tragedy, and he was famous for it in \x{2018}The <<Midnight|13>> Bell.\x{2019} He was now about thirty-two, and wore old grey flannel trousers, a sports coat, rather dirty shirts, and knitted ties. He had sandy hair, rather closely cropped (as though he had acquired the habit in prison and rather fancied the style) and grey eyes. He had enormous ears, and a long nose with a rather bashed-in appearance \x{2013} an illegal nose, in fact \x{2013} and a full mouth and a large chin. Every now and again he tried to commit suicide, but could never manage to bring it off. Despite all these things, he really wouldn\x{2019}t have hurt a fly and was quite a good fellow if you didn\x{2019}t rub him up the wrong way. He lived in Fitzroy Square.",

And certainly blindness or stupidity, in the ordinary sense of the terms, were the last features to be ascribed to Ella. Indeed, the funny thing about Ella was that although she perceived and apprehended practically nothing, she unaccountably perceived and apprehended practically everything. A liar, or a braggart (and drunkards, whom Ella coped with as part of her daily task, are most often both) had only to meet her grey and friendly gaze to be irritatingly aware of this contradiction. Without knowing it herself she summed up a person or sensed a situation in a second. Nor was she by any means inarticulate. The banality of the expressions she employed in voicing her thoughts was no criterion of those thoughts\x{2019} real shrewdness or aptness. Infinitely stale and hackneyed idioms she certainly used, but this was merely because, having access to the wisdom of the ages, she used the expressions sanctified by the ages. Ella always meant what she said. She breathed life into old forms. Hence, when Ella remarked, say, that \x{2018}the longest way round is the shortest way home\x{2019} she was not echoing a proverb as a parrot would. On the contrary, after the continually recurring experience in her everyday life, of the fact that short, hasty, or violent methods on behalf of any end generally involve the frustration of the whole endeavour, she had long sought in her thoughtful mind for some law to cover the detached instances of this phenomenon, and had at last alighted, with joy, upon the ready-made aphorism. Similarly Ella, having observed in some of her friends or customers, the human but indefensible practice of accusing others of the very faults from which they themselves most glaringly suffered, would be heard suggesting, with delightful vividness, that \x{2018}people in glass houses should not throw stones\x{2019} or that \x{2018}the pot was calling the kettle black.\x{2019} A poet could have done no better. The sheer force of her sincerity made these stale maxims her own original pronouncements. And she took continuous pleasure in the exercise of this gift, though a superficial observer \x{2013} learning from her lips that still waters run deep, or that you cannot burn the candle at both ends, or that the proof of the pudding is in the eating, or that it is no use crying over spilt milk, or that enough is as good as a feast, or that pride goes before a fall, and innumerable other essences of wisdom \x{2013} might easily mistake for dullness her genuine love of artistic self-expression.",

It was the way in which it was said, and the grin with which it was accompanied. Moreover the \x{2018}yet\x{2019} scared her. \x{2018}You don\x{2019}t know my name yet.\x{2019} What did that infer? What else, but that there was some obligation on her part to know his name in the end, that she had by suggestion admitted some compact with him wherein the knowing of his name was a necessary, an immanent step leading to involvements beyond? She felt entrapped in the meshes of that \x{2018}yet,\x{2019} and her spirit strove to escape. How had he established the right to make this claim on her? He had only been coming in here for the last three or four weeks, and she had only spoken to him a dozen times at the most. Had she \x{2018}encouraged\x{2019} him? No. She had been polite; she had been kind. She was polite and kind to all her customers. It had been he who had singled her out, who, from little casual greetings and remarks on the weather, from little desultory chats about nothing when there were not enough people in the bar to occupy her fully, had step by step led on to the present state of affairs, in which he seemed to have made her his subtle yet consistent objective on entering the bar, and had taken more and more to coming in early, when she was not busy, and conversation might be sustained. And she had respected and returned his growing friendliness. To that extent of course she had \x{2018}encouraged\x{2019} him. She had \x{2018}liked\x{2019} him. Who, in her place, could have dreamed of being landed with this \x{2018}yet\x{2019}? He was an old man. It was true that he was wonderfully \x{2018}young,\x{2019} but he was an old man. That being so, if the smallest suspicion had ever crossed her mind, she had been justified in dismissing it from her mind as ridiculous introspection. And if it came to that, was all this ridiculous introspection on her part? Could not his \x{2018}yet\x{2019} be interpreted as deriving from a mere desire to establish his adoption of \x{2018}The <<Midnight|13>> Bell\x{2019} as his particular public-house in the future? She wished she could believe so. That, at any rate, was what she must assume in front of him for the time being.",

            "In appearance Bob was a formidably yet casually attractive young man looking anything between twenty and thirty (he was actually twenty-six). He was tall, with dark well-kept hair, dark brown eyes, set rather far back, and firm efficient clean-shaven features which bespoke his partially American origin. He had been at sea a great part of his early life, he was motherless and fatherless, and he had long adopted England as his country, speaking with a definite London accent and with London idiom. He had a resolute and independent air which, to one who understood him, did nothing to mitigate his real transparency. Ella, who understood him, loved him. She loved him largely because after due consideration she had decided that he was divinely good-looking, and largely because after due consideration she had decided that he was divinely transparent. Though she did not realize it, her whole daily life centred around Bob \x{2013} his comings, his goings, his moods, his reticences, his absurdities. That he did not return her love in the smallest measure caused no resentment in her whatever. The superb mechanism of her healthy character enabled her to tie up any package of what was not to be, and to shelve it for good. Not that she could always resist casting wistful eyes upon it on the shelf. When she was unhappy, or run down, or in a nervous state, she found Bob\x{2019}s continual proximity a little painful and disquieting. But no mechanism can function perfectly all the time. In addition to all this Bob dominated her existence purely by virtue of his companionship. Since she was so seldom away from \x{2018}The <<Midnight|13>> Bell,\x{2019} and had so few friends whom she cared to meet, or who were accessible, she relied more and more upon Bob. She realized now that when he came to \x{2018}The <<Midnight|13>> Bell\x{2019} four or five months ago, something had definitely entered her life. On the score of reciprocation of companionship alone she had nothing to complain of in Bob. He clearly liked and respected her, and they had reached a wonderful intimacy. That this for the greater part took the form of playful rallying and semi-flirtatious non-commitment did not detract from its stability and charm. They often talked seriously. In her heart Ella (the incurably serious-minded) liked best of all to talk seriously, and her serious talks with Bob were a great, and glowing, pleasure. Also, she had her work in common with Bob, and stood with Bob in close conspiracy and muttered rebellion against certain injustices and disorders descending almost daily upon them from a higher quarter in \x{2018}The <<Midnight|13>> Bell.\x{2019} In fact she often thought she could not do without Bob now.",

Ella had at first been a little disappointed that he should have brought her to the Corner House; for she had been here before of an evening, and after the terrific splash he had made at the theatre, and what with Army people and one thing and another, she had somehow got it into her head that when he spoke of Dinner he had in mind somewhere a little more intimate, original and exciting \x{2013} one of those little restaurants in Soho, say, which she had so often wondered about. But she at once reproved herself for greed in pleasure, and was in a way relieved to be on her own ground, where she knew how to behave and where she was suitably dressed. Besides, she was intensely fond of Lyons\x{2019} Corner House \x{2013} with the fondness of all healthy-minded beings for palaces \x{2013} and Mr. Eccles took a broad-minded view of the menu which made her gasp. He ordered two cocktails at once, and burst into the dizziest soups and lobster extravagances without turning a hair. He also ordered wine for himself, and persuaded Ella, much against her will, to take a little. Ella reckoned that what with the theatre and all the rest he had spent little less than thirty shillings on this jaunt already; and as one who seldom spent more than thirty pence on an outing altogether, she had a peculiar sense of being wasteful, and wanted to stop him. At the same time she had a peculiar sense of enjoying herself, of merely physically revelling, for the first time in her life, in the brilliant sunshine of his financial plane, and she wanted to do anything but stop him.",
