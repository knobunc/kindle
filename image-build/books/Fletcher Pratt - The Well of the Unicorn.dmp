He wandered among shops, was beset to avoid slops, took his <<noon|13>> meal in a cook-stall where he left his pack in care, and found the temptation to buy strong till the very moment of entering the shop to chaffer. Then he would reflect that he bore his only home on his back, like a turtle; therefore ended by purchasing not even what he might in another mood have wished, like a beautiful little grimoire to fit the pocket, in the Street of the Booksellers. He went near neither the street where his father's brother kept house and artisanship in the name of Fabrizius, nor the dock where the latter had told him the cog Unicorn would lie\x{2014}no, death's resort, both\x{2014}though from the street of the piers he could see tall masts rising and catch the pungent whiff of spices from Uravedu and the South Isles; and it was of regret that the chance to sail thither had come in such a form.",

He stood up with an air of decision when the meal was over. "That nag of yours," said he, "is something less than a racer, but you must push her. We have a long journey to the nearest inn and it\'s well to remember how sea-demons beset this road by night."',

The end of that converse might have been foretold\x{2014} out came the story of Meliboe the enchanter's doubledealing which Airar himself had hardly realized till he began to talk on it, with the foul things the magician had put aboard the vessels. Now Airar found himself pressed into promising that he would lay protections on all the skonar-ships of the fleet as he had on Rudr's own iulia. The prospect was little pleasing; nor were matters helped any by the arrival during the afternoon of a woman with a lined severe countenance and a tongue that seemed to wag double, who said that her house was overrun with a plague of rats and would have Airar give her a spell to drive them out. The more he tried to put her off, the longer she talked; and louder to keep her quiet he finally inscribed a bit of parchment with certain names of ill omen, as An gat, Huard,
Utesitorion, with a picture of the unhappy bergamot flower, telling her to soak it at <<midnight|13>> in the fat of a hog and leave it in a fall-trap.",

The High Hills of Froy were now all round, a country little peopled save by charcoal burners and such shy folk, so it was not to be expected that many would be met; yet it was somewhat grating to have no further word from Rogai. The night camp was by the earliest of those lakes which fill all the bowls of the hills, the more particularly westward toward rainy Shalland. Guards were set well toward the rear, and next morning, as being somewhat short of victual, the more part kept camp while the rest went out to see what could be had among the trees. Airar\'s own bow brought in a wild pig, and there were other small items, but it was <<long before noon|3b>> when all let themselves be engaged by Evimenes to take the trail again.

The tower burned in three stages; men leaped from it screaming to fall by spear or arrow or merely amid rocks; quarter-boats were putting out from Mikalegon\'s fleet to aid the attack; and there were those who threw down shield, holding arms aloft in surrender.',
