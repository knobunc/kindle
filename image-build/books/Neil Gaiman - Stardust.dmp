            "In the morning\x{2019}s bright light the young lady
seemed more human and less ethereal. She had said nothing since Tristran had woken.He took his knife
and cut a fallen treebranch into a Y-shaped crutch while she sat beneath a sycamore tree and glared
at him and glowered at him and scowled at him from her place on the ground. He peeled the bark from
a green branch and wound it around the upper fork of the Y.They had had no breakfast yet, and
Tristran was ravenous; his stomach rumbled as he worked. The star had said nothing about being
hungry. Then again, she had done nothing at all but look at him, first reproachfully, and then with
undisguised hatred.He pulled the bark tight, then looped it under itself and tugged on it once more.
\x{201c}This is honestly nothing personal,\x{201d} he said, to the woman and to the grove .With the
full sunlight shining down she scarcely glittered at all, save for where the darkest shadows touched
her.The star ran one pale forefinger up and down the silver chain that went between them, tracing
the line of it about her slim wrist, and made no reply.\x{201c}I did it for love,\x{201d} he
continued. \x{201c}And you really are my only hope. Her name \x{2014} that is, the name of my love
\x{2014} is Victoria. Victoria Forester. And she is the prettiest, wisest, sweetest girl in the whole
wide world.\x{201d} The girl broke her silence with a snort of derision. \x{201c}And this wise, sweet
creature sent you here to torture me?\x{201d} she said.\x{201c}Well, not exactly. You see, she
promised me anything I desired \x{2014} be it her hand in marriage or her lips to kiss \x{2014} were I
to bring her the star that we saw fall the night before last. I had thought,\x{201d} he confessed,
\x{201c}that a fallen star would probably look like a diamond or a rock. I certainly wasn\x{2019}t
expecting a lady.\x{201d} \x{201c}So, having found a lady, could you not have come to her aid, or left
her alone? Why drag her into your foolishness?\x{201d} \x{201c}Love,\x{201d} he explained.She looked at
him with eyes the blue of the sky. \x{201c}I hope you choke on it,\x{201d} she said, flatly.\x{201c}I
won\x{2019}t,\x{201d} said Tristran, with more confidence and good cheer than he actually felt.
\x{201c}Here. Try this.\x{201d} He passed her the crutch and, reaching down, tried to help her to her
feet. His hands tingled, not unpleasantly, where his skin touched hers. She sat on the ground like a
tree stump, making no effort to get up.\x{201c}I told you,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}that I would do
everything in my power to frustrate your plans and devices.\x{201d} She looked around the grove.
\x{201c}How very bland this world does look by day. And how dull.\x{201d} \x{201c}Just put your weight
on me, and the rest on the crutch,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}You\x{2019}ll have to move sometime.\x{201d}
He tugged on the chain and, reluctantly, the star began to get to her feet, leaning first against
Tristran, and then, as if proximity to him disgusted her, on the crutch.She gasped, then, in a hard
intake of breath, and tumbled to the grass, where she lay with her face contorted, making small
noises of pain. Tristran knelt down beside her. \x{201c}What\x{2019}s wrong?\x{201d} he asked.Her blue
eyes flashed, but they were swimming with tears. \x{201c}My leg. I can\x{2019}t stand on it. It must
really be broken.\x{201d} Her skin had gone as white as a cloud, and she was
shivering.\x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry,\x{201d} said Tristran, uselessly. \x{201c}I can make you a splint.
I\x{2019}ve done it for sheep. It\x{2019}ll be all right.\x{201d} He squeezed her hand, and then he
went to the brook and dipped his handkerchief in it and gave it to the star to wipe her forehead.He
split more fallen wood with his knife. Then he removed his jerkin, and took off his shirt, which he
proceeded to tear into strips which he used to bind the sticks, as firmly as he could, about her
injured leg. The star made no sounds while he did this, although, when he pulled the last knot
tight, he thought he heard her whimper to herself.\x{201c}Really,\x{201d} he told her, \x{201c}we ought
to get you to a proper doctor. I\x{2019}m not a surgeon or anything.\x{201d} \x{201c}No?\x{201d} she
said dryly. \x{201c}You astonish me.\x{201d}He let her rest for a little, in the sun. And then he
said, \x{201c}Better try again, I suppose,\x{201d} and he raised her to her feet.They left the glade
at a hobble, the star leaning heavily on her crutch and on Tristran\x{2019}s arm, wincing at every
step. And every time she winced or flinched Tristran felt guilty and awkward, but he calmed himself
by thinking of Victoria Forester\x{2019}s grey eyes. They followed a deer path through the
hazel-wood, while Tristran \x{2014} who had decided that the right thing to do was to make
conversation with the star \x{2014} asked how long she had been a star, whether it was enjoyable to
be a star and whether all stars were women, and informed her that he had always supposed stars to
be, as Mrs. Cherry had taught them, flaming balls of burning gas many hundreds of miles across, just
like the sun only further away.To all of these questions and statements she made no answer.\x{201c}So
why did you fall?\x{201d} he asked. \x{201c}Did you trip over something?\x{201d}She stopped moving, and
turned, and stared at him, as if she were examining something quite unpleasant a very long way
away.\x{201c}I did not trip,\x{201d} she said at length. \x{201c}I was hit. By
this.\x{201d} She reached into her dress and pulled out a large yellowish stone, which dangled
from two lengths of silver chain. \x{201c}There\x{2019}s a bruise on my side where it hit me and
knocked me from the sky. And now I am obligated to carry it about with me.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Why?\x{201d}She seemed as if she were about to answer, and then she shook her head, and her
lips closed, and she said nothing at all. A stream rilled and splashed to their right, keeping pace
with them. The <<noonday|13>> sun was overhead, and Tristran found himself getting increasingly hungry. He
took the heel of the dry loaf from his bag, moistened it in the stream, and shared it out, half and
half.The star inspected the wet bread with disdain and did not put it in her
mouth.\x{201c}You\x{2019}ll starve,\x{201d} warned Tristran.She said nothing, just raised her chin a
little higher. They continued through the woodland, making slow progress. They were laboring up a
deer path on the side of a hill, which led them over fallen trees, and which had now become so steep
it threatened to tumble the stumbling star and her captor down to the bottom. \x{201c}Is there not an
easier path?\x{201d} asked the star, at length. \x{201c}Some kind of road, or a level
clearing?\x{201d}And once the question was asked, Tristran knew the answer. \x{201c}There is a road
half a mile that way,\x{201d} he told her, pointing, \x{201c}and a clearing over there, beyond that
thicket,\x{201d} he said, turning to motion in another direction.\x{201c}You knew
that?\x{201d}\x{201c}Yes. No. Well, I only knew it once you asked me.\x{201d} \x{201c}Let us make for
the clearing,\x{201d} she said, and they pushed through the thicket as best they could. It still took
them the better part of an hour to reach the clearing, but the ground, when they got there, was as
level and flat as a playing field. The space seemed to have been cleared with a purpose, but what
that purpose was Tristran could not imagine.In the center of the glade, on the grass some distance
from them, was an ornate golden crown, which glittered in the afternoon sunlight. It was studded
with red and blue stones: rubies and sapphires, thought Tristran. He was about to walk over
to the crown when the star touched his arm and said, \x{201c}Wait. Do you hear drums?\x{201d}He
realized that he did: a low, throbbing beat, coming from all around them, near at hand and far away,
which echoed through the hills. And then there came a loud crashing noise from the trees at the far
side of the clearing, and a high, wordless screaming. Into the glade came a huge white horse, its
flanks gashed and bloody. It charged into the middle of the clearing, and then it turned, and
lowered its head, and faced its pursuer \x{2014} which bounded into the clearing with a growl that
made Tristran\x{2019}s flesh prickle. It was a lion, but it looked little enough like the lion
Tristran had seen at a fair in the next village, which had been a mangy, toothless, rheumy thing.
This lion was huge, the color of sand in the late afternoon. It entered the clearing at a run, and
then it stopped and snarled at the white horse.The horse looked terrified. Its mane was matted with
sweat and blood, and its eyes were wild. Also, Tristran realized, it had a long, ivory horn jutting
from the center of its forehead. It reared up on its hind legs, whinnying and snorting, and one
sharp, unshod hoof connected with the lion\x{2019}s shoulder, causing the lion to howl like a huge,
scalded cat, and to spring backwards. Then, keeping its distance, the lion circled the wary unicorn,
its golden eyes at all times fixed upon the sharp horn that was always turned toward it.\x{201c}Stop
them,\x{201d} whispered the star. \x{201c}They will kill each other.\x{201d}The lion growled at the
unicorn. It began as a soft growl, like distant thunder, and finished as a roar that shook the trees
and the rocks of the valley and the sky. Then the lion sprang and the unicorn plunged, and the glade
was filled with gold and silver and red, for the lion was on the unicorn\x{2019}s back, claws gashing
deeply into its flanks, mouth at its neck, and the unicorn was wailing and bucking and throwing
itself onto its back in an effort to dislodge the great cat, flailing uselessly with its hooves and
its horn in an effort to reach its tormentor.\x{201c}Please, do something.The lion will kill
him,\x{201d} pleaded the girl, urgently.Tristran would have explained to her that all he could
possibly hope for if he approached the raging beasts was to be skewered, and kicked, and clawed, and
eaten; and he would further have explained that, should he somehow survive approaching them, there
was still nothing that he could do, having with him not even the pail of water which had been the
traditional method of breaking up animal fights in Wall. But by the time all these thoughts had gone
through his head, Tristran was already standing in the center of the clearing, an arm\x{2019}s length
from the beasts. The scent of the lion was deep, animal, terrifying, and Tristran was close enough
to see the beseeching expression in the unicorn\x{2019}s black eyesThe Lion and the Unicorn were
fighting for the crown, thought Tristran to himself, remembering the old nursery
rhyme.\x{a0}The Lion beat the Unicorn all about the town.",

            "Tristran was woken a little
after sunrise by a large badger walking upon its hind legs and wearing a threadbare heliotrope silk
dressing-gown, who snuffled into his ear until Tristran sleepily opened his eyes, and then said,
self-importantly, \x{201c}Party name of Thorn? Tristran of that set?\x{201d} \x{201c}Mm?\x{201d} said
Tristran. There was a foul taste in his mouth, which felt dry and furred. He could have slept for
another several hours.\x{201c}They\x{2019}ve been asking about you,\x{201d} said the badger.
\x{201c}Down by the gap. Seems there\x{2019}s a young lady wants to have a word with
you.\x{201d}Tristran sat up and grinned widely. He touched the sleeping star on her shoulder. She
opened her sleepy blue eyes and said, \x{201c}What?\x{201d} \x{201c}Good news,\x{201d} he told her.
\x{201c}Do you remember Victoria Forester? I might have mentioned her name once or twice on our
travels.\x{201d} \x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}You might have.\x{201d} \x{201c}Well,\x{201d} he
said, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m off to see her. She\x{2019}s down by the gap.\x{201d} He paused. \x{201c}Look.
Well. Probably best if you stay here. I wouldn\x{2019}t want to confuse her or anything.\x{201d}The
star rolled over and covered her head with her arm and said nothing else. Tristran decided that she
must have gone back to sleep. He pulled on his boots, washed his face and rinsed out his mouth in
the meadow stream, and then ran pell-mell through the meadow, toward the village.The guards on the
wall this morning were the Reverend Myles, the vicar of Wall, and Mr. Bromios, the innkeeper.
Standing between them was a young lady with her back to the meadow. \x{201c}Victoria!\x{201d}
called Tristran in delight; but then the young lady turned, and he saw that it was
notVictoria Forester (who, he remembered suddenly, and with delight in the knowing, had
grey eyes. That was what they were: grey. How could he ever have allowed himself to forget?).
But who this young lady could have been in her fine bonnet and shawl, Tristran could not say,
although her eyes flooded with tears at the sight of him.\x{201c}Tristran!\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}It
is you! They said it was! Oh Tristran! How could you? Oh, how could you?\x{201d} and he
realized who the young lady reproaching him must be.\x{201c}Louisa?\x{201d} he said to his sister. And
then, \x{201c}You have certainly grown while I was away, from a chit of a girl into a fine young
lady.\x{201d}She sniffed and blew her nose into a lace-edged linen handkerchief, which she pulled
from her sleeve. \x{201c}And you,\x{201d} she told him, dabbing at her cheeks with the handkerchief,
\x{201c}have turned into a mop-haired raggle-taggle gypsy on your journeyings. But I suppose you look
well, and that is a good thing. Come on, now,\x{201d} and she motioned, impatiently, for him to walk
through the gap in the wall, and come to her.\x{201c}But the wall \x{2014}\x{201d} he said, eyeing the
innkeeper and the vicar a little nervously.\x{201c}Oh, as to that, when Wystan and Mister Brown
finished their shift last night they repaired to the saloon bar at the Seventh Pie, where
Wystan happened to mention their meeting with a ragamuffin who claimed to be you, and how they
blocked his way. Your way. When news of this reached Father\x{2019}s ears, he marched right up to the
Pie and gave the both of them such a tongue-lashing and a telling-of-what-for that I could
scarcely believe it was him.\x{201d} \x{201c}Some of us were for letting you come back this
morning,\x{201d} said the vicar, \x{201c}and some were for keeping you there <<until midday|9b>>.\x{201d}
\x{201c}But none of the ones who were for making you wait are on Wall duty this morning,\x{201d} said
Mr. Bromios. \x{201c}Which took a certain amount of jiggery-pokery to organize \x{2014} and on a day
when I should have been seeing to the refreshment stand, I could point out. Still, it\x{2019}s good
to see you back. Come on through.\x{201d} And with that he stuck out his hand, and Tristran shook it
with enthusiasm. Then Tristran shook the vicar\x{2019}s hand.\x{201c}Tristran,\x{201d} said the vicar,
\x{201c}I suppose that you must have seen many strange sights upon your travels.\x{201d}Tristran
reflected for a moment. \x{201c}I suppose I must have,\x{201d} he said.\x{201c}You must come to the
Vicarage, then, next week,\x{201d} said the vicar. \x{201c}We shall have tea, and you must tell me all
about it. Once you\x{2019}re settled back in. Eh?\x{201d} And Tristran, who had always held the vicar
in some awe, could do nothing but nod.Louisa sighed, a little theatrically, and began to walk,
briskly, in the direction of the Seventh Magpie. Tristran ran along the cobbles to catch her
up, and then he was walking beside her.\x{201c}It does my heart good to see you again, my
sister,\x{201d} he said.\x{201c}As if we were not all worried sick about you,\x{201d} she said,
crossly, \x{201c}what with all your gallivantings. And you did not even wake me to say good-bye.
Father has been quite distracted with concern for you, and at Christmas, when you were not there,
after we had eaten the goose and the pudding, Father took out the port and he toasted absent
friends, and Mother sobbed like a babe, so of course I cried too, and then Father began to blow his
nose into his best handkerchief and Grandmother and Grandfather Hempstock insisted upon pulling the
Christmas crackers and reading the jolly mottoes and somehow that only made matters worse, and, to
put it bluntly,Tristran, you quite spoiled our Christmas.\x{201d} \x{201c}Sorry,\x{201d} said Tristran.
\x{201c}What are we doing now? Where are we going?\x{201d} \x{201c}We are going into the Seventh
Pie,\x{201d} said Louisa. \x{201c}I should have thought that was obvious. Mister Bromios said that
you could use his sitting room. There\x{2019}s somebody there who needs to talk to you.\x{201d} And
she said nothing more as they went into the pub.There were a number of faces Tristran recognized,
and the people nodded at him, or smiled, or did not smile, as he walked through the crowds and made
his way up the narrow stairs behind the bar to the landing with Louisa by his side.The wooden boards
creaked beneath their feet.Louisa glared at Tristran. And then her lip trembled, and, to
Tristran\x{2019}s surprise, she threw her arms about him and hugged him so tightly that he could not
breathe. Then, with not another word, she fled back down the wooden stairs.He knocked at the door to
the sitting room and went in. The room was decorated with a number of unusual objects, of small
items of antique statuary and clay pots. Upon the wall hung a stick, wound about with ivy leaves, or
rather, with a dark metal cunningly beaten to resemble ivy. Apart from the decorations the room
could have been the sitting room of any busy bachelor with little time for sitting. It was furnished
with a small chaise longue, a low table upon which was a well-thumbed leather-bound copy of the
sermons of Laurence Sterne, a pianoforte, and several leather armchairs, and it was in one of these
armchairs that Victoria Forester was sitting.Tristran walked over to her slowly and steadily, and
then he went down upon one knee in front of her, as once he had gone down on his knees before her in
the mud of a country lane.\x{201c}Oh, please don\x{2019}t,\x{201d} said Victoria Forester,
uncomfortably. \x{201c}Please get up. Why don\x{2019}t you sit down over there. In that chair? Yes.
That\x{2019}s better.\x{201d} The morning light shone through the high lace curtains and caught her
chestnut hair from behind, framing her face in gold. \x{201c}Look at you,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}You
became a man. And your hand.What happened to your hand?\x{201d} \x{201c}I burnt it,\x{201d} he said.
\x{201c}In a fire.\x{201d}She said nothing in response, at first. She just looked at him. Then she sat
back in the armchair and looked ahead of her, at the stick on the wall, or one of Mr.
Bromios\x{2019}s quaint old statues perhaps, and she said, \x{201c}There are a number of things I must
tell you, Tristran, and none of them will be easy. I would appreciate it if you said nothing until I
have had a chance to say my piece. So: firstly, and perhaps most importantly, I must apologize to
you. It was my foolishness, my idiocy, that sent you off on your journeyings. I thought you were
joking\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. no, not joking. I thought that you were too much the coward, too much of
a boy, ever to follow up on any of your fine, silly words. It was only when you had gone, and the
days passed, and you did not return, that I realized that you had been in earnest, and by then it
was much too late.\x{201c}I have had to live\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. each day\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. with
the possibility that I had sent you to your death.\x{201d}She stared ahead of herself as she spoke,
and Tristran had the feeling, which became a certainty, that she had conducted this conversation in
her head a hundred times in his absence. It was why he could not be permitted to say anything; this
was hard enough on Victoria Forester, and she would not be able to manage it if he caused her to
depart from her script.\x{201c}And I did not play you fair, my poor shop-boy\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. but
you are no longer a shop-boy, are you?\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. since I thought that your quest was just
foolishness, in every way\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d} She paused, and her hands gripped the wooden
arms of the chair, grasping them so tightly her knuckles first reddened, then went white. \x{201c}Ask
me why I would not kiss you that night, Tristran Thorn.\x{201d} \x{201c}It was your right not to kiss
me,\x{201d} said Tristran. \x{201c}I did not come here to make you sad, Vicky. I did not find you your
star to make you miserable.\x{201d}Her head tipped to one side. \x{201c}So you did find the
star we saw that night?\x{201d} \x{201c}Oh yes,\x{201d} said Tristran. \x{201c}The star is back in the
meadow, though, right now. But I did what you asked me to do.\x{201d} \x{201c}Then do something else
for me now. Ask me why I would not kiss you that night. I had kissed you before, when we were
younger, after all.\x{201d} \x{201c}Very well, Vicky. Why would you not kiss me, that night?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Because,\x{201d} she said, and there was relief in her voice as she said it, enormous relief,
as if it were escaping from her, \x{201c}the day before we saw the shooting star, Robert had asked me
to marry him. That evening, when I saw you, I had gone to the shop hoping to see him, and to talk to
him, and to tell him that I accepted, and he should ask my father for my
hand.\x{201d}\x{201c}Robert?\x{201d} asked Tristran, his head all in a whirl.\x{201c}Robert Monday. You
worked in his shop.\x{201d}\x{201c}Mister Monday?\x{201d} echoed Tristran. \x{201c}You and Mister
Monday?\x{201d} \x{201c}Exactly.\x{201d} She was looking at him now. \x{201c}And then you had to take me
seriously and run off to bring me back a star, and not a day would go by when I did not feel as if I
had done something foolish and bad. For I promised you my hand, if you returned with the star. And
there were some days, Tristran, when I honestly do not know which I thought worse, that you would be
killed in the Lands Beyond, all for the love of me, or that you would succeed in your madness, and
return with the star, to claim me as your bride. Now, of course, some folks hereabouts told me not
to take on so, and that it was inevitable that you would have gone off to the Lands Beyond, of
course, it being your nature, and you being from there in the first place, but, somehow, in my
heart, I knew I was at fault, and that, one day, you would return to claim me.\x{201d}",

as the afternoon dragged on.\x{201c}I do not know,\x{201d} said the star.
\x{201c}Perhaps.\x{201d}\x{201c}A young man, if I do not mistake my guess, a lovely thing like
you.\x{201d}The star nodded. \x{201c}In a way,\x{201d} she said.\x{201c}I\x{2019}m Victoria,\x{201d} said
the young woman. \x{201c}Victoria Forester.\x{201d} \x{201c}I am called Yvaine,\x{201d} said the star.
She looked Victoria Forester up and down and up again. \x{201c}So,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}you are
Victoria Forester. Your fame precedes you.\x{201d} \x{201c}The wedding, you mean?\x{201d} said
Victoria, and her eyes shone with pride and delight.\x{201c}A wedding, is it?\x{201d} asked Yvaine.
One hand crept to her waist and felt the topaz upon its silver chain. Then she stared at the gap in
the wall and bit her lip.\x{201c}Oh you poor thing! What a beast he must be, to keep you waiting
so!\x{201d} said Victoria Forester. \x{201c}Why do you not go through, and look for him?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Because\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d} said the star, and then she stopped. \x{201c}Aye,\x{201d}
she said. \x{201c}Perhaps I shall.\x{201d} The sky above them was striped with grey and white bands of
cloud, through which patches of blue could be seen. \x{201c}I wish my mother were out,\x{201d} said
the star. \x{201c}I would say good-bye to her, first.\x{201d} And, awkwardly, she got to her feet.But
Victoria was not willing to let her new friend go that easily, and she was prattling on about banns,
and marriage licenses, and special licenses which could only be issued by archbishops, and how lucky
she was that Robert knew the archbishop. The wedding, it seemed, was set for six days\x{2019} time,
at <<midday|13>>.Then Victoria called over a respectable gentleman, greying at the temples, who was smoking
a black cheroot and who grinned as if he had the toothache. \x{201c}And this is Robert,\x{201d} she
said. \x{201c}Robert, this is Yvaine. She\x{2019}s waiting for her young man. Yvaine, this is Robert
Monday. And on Friday next, at <<midday|13>>, I shall be Victoria Monday. Perhaps you could make something
of that, my dear, in your speech at the wedding breakfast \x{2014} that on Friday there will be two
Mondays together!\x{201d}And Mr. Monday puffed on his cheroot, and told his bride-to-be that he would
certainly consider it.\x{201c}Then,\x{201d} asked Yvaine, picking her words with care, \x{201c}you are
not marrying Tristran Thorn?\x{201d} \x{201c}No,\x{201d} said Victoria.\x{201c}Oh,\x{201d} said
the star. \x{201c}Good.\x{201d} And she sat down again.",

            "\x{201c}Indeed, I am sure that he would not,\x{201d} said Daisy\x{2019}s mama on
this evening, as she said on every such evening, and she removed her own bonnet and her gloves and
led her daughters to the drawing room, in which a very tall gentleman with a very long black beard
was sitting, sorting through his pack. Daisy, and her mama, and her sister, bobbed curtseys to the
gentleman (who spoke little English, and had arrived a few days before). The temporary lodger, in
his turn, stood and bowed to them, then returned to his pack of wooden oddments, sorting, arranging
and polishing.\x{a0}It was chilly that
April, with the awkward changeability of English spring.The visitors came up the narrow road through
the forest from the south; they filled the spare-rooms, they bunked out in cow byres and barns. Some
of them raised colored tents, some of them arrived in their own caravans drawn by huge grey horses
or by small, shaggy ponies.In the forest there was a carpet of bluebells.On the morning of April the
29th Dunstan Thorn drew guard duty on the gap in the wall, with Tommy Forester.They stood on each
side of the gap in the wall, and they waited.Dunstan had done guard duty many times before, but
hitherto his task had consisted of simply standing, and, on occasion, shooing away children.Today he
felt important: he held a wooden cudgel, and as each stranger to the village came up to the break in
the wall, Dunstan or Tommy would say \x{201c}Tomorrow, tomorrow. No one\x{2019}s coming through today,
good sirs.\x{201d}And the strangers would retreat a little way, and stare through the break in the
wall at the unassuming meadow beyond it, at the unexceptional trees that dotted the meadow, at the
rather dull forest behind it. Some of them attempted to strike up conversations with Dunstan or
Tommy, but the young men, proud of their status as guards, declined to converse, contenting
themselves by raising their heads, tightening their lips, and generally looking important.At
lunchtime, Daisy Hempstock brought by a small pot of shepherd\x{2019}s pie for them both, and Bridget
Comfrey brought them each a mug of spiced ale.And, at twilight, another two able-bodied young men of
the village arrived to relieve them, carrying a lantern each, and Tommy and Dunstan walked down to
the inn where Mr. Bromios gave each of them a mug of his best ale \x{2014} and his best ale was very
fine indeed \x{2014} as their reward for doing guard duty.There was a buzz of excitement in the inn,
now crowded beyond believing. It was filled with visitors to the village from every nation in the
world, or so it seemed to Dunstan who had no sense of distance beyond the woods that surrounded the
village of Wall, so he regarded the tall gentleman in the black top hat at the table beside him, all
the way up from London, with as much awe as he regarded the taller ebony-colored gentleman in the
white one-piece robe with whom he was dining.Dunstan knew that it was rude to stare, and that, as a
villager of Wall, he had every right to feel superior to all of the \x{201c}furriners.\x{201d} But he
could smell unfamilar spices on the air, and hear men and women speaking to each other in a hundred
tongues, and he gawked and gazed unashamedly.The man in the black silk top hat noticed that Dunstan
was staring at him, and motioned the lad over to him. \x{201c}D\x{2019}you like treacle
pudden\x{2019}?\x{201d} he asked abruptly, by way of introduction. \x{201c}Mutanabbi was called away,
and there\x{2019}s more pudden\x{2019} here than a man can manage on his own.\x{201d}Dunstan nodded.The
treacle pudding was steaming invitingly on its plate.\x{201c}Well then,\x{201d} said his new friend,
\x{201c}help yourself.\x{201d} He passed Dunstan a clean china bowl and a spoon. Dunstan needed no
further encouragement, and he began to demolish the pudding.\x{201c}Now, young \x{2019}un,\x{201d} said
the tall gentleman in the black silk top hat to Dunstan, once their bowls and the pudding-plate were
quite empty, \x{201c}it\x{2019}d seem the inn has no more rooms; also that every room in the village
has already been let.\x{201d}\x{201c}Is that so?\x{201d} said Dunstan, unsurprised.\x{201c}That it
is,\x{201d} said the gentleman in the top hat. \x{201c}And what I was wondering was, would you know of
a house that might have a room?\x{201d}Dunstan shrugged. \x{201c}All the rooms have gone by
now,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I remember that when I was a boy of nine, my mother and my father sent
me to sleep out in the rafters of the cow byre for a week, and let my room to a lady from the
Orient, and her family and servants. She left me a kite, as a thank you, and I flew it from the
meadow until one day it snapped its string and flew away into the sky.\x{201d} \x{201c}Where do you
live now?\x{201d} asked the gentleman in the top hat.\x{201c}I have a cottage on the edge of my
father\x{2019}s land,\x{201d} Dunstan replied. \x{201c}It was our shepherd\x{2019}s cottage, until he
died, two years ago last lammas-tide, and my parents gave it to me.\x{201d} \x{201c}Take me to
it,\x{201d} said the gentleman in the hat, and it did not occur to Dunstan to refuse him.The spring
moon was high and bright, and the night was clear.They walked down from the village to the forest
beneath it, and they walked the whole way past the Thorn family farm (where the gentleman in the top
hat was startled by a cow, sleeping in the meadow, which snorted as it dreamed) until they reached
Dunstan\x{2019}s cottage.It had one room and a fireplace. The stranger nodded. \x{201c}I like this
well enough,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Come, Dunstan Thorn, I\x{2019}ll rent it from you for the next
three days.\x{201d} \x{201c}What\x{2019}ll you give me for it?\x{201d} \x{201c}A golden sovereign, a
silver sixpence, a copper penny, and a fresh shiny farthing,\x{201d} said the man.Now a golden
sovereign for two nights was more than a fair rent, in the days when a farmworker might hope to make
fifteen pounds in a good year. Still, Dunstan hesitated. \x{201c}If you\x{2019}re here for the
market,\x{201d} he told the tall man, \x{201c}then it\x{2019}s miracles and wonders you\x{2019}ll be
trading.\x{201d}The tall man nodded. \x{201c}So, it would be miracles and wonders that you would be
after, is it?\x{201d} He looked around Dunstan\x{2019}s one-room cottage again. It began to rain then,
a gentle pattering on the thatch above them.\x{201c}Oh, very well,\x{201d} said the tall gentleman, a
trifle testily, \x{201c}a miracle, a wonder. Tomorrow, you shall attain your Heart\x{2019}s Desire.
Now, here is your money,\x{201d} and he took it from Dun-stan\x{2019}s ear, with one easy gesture.
Dunstan touched it to the iron nail on the cottage door, checking for faerie gold, then he bowed low
to the gentleman and walked off into the rain. He tied the money up in his handkerchief.Dunstan
walked to the cow byre in the pelting rain. He climbed into the hayloft and was soon asleep.He was
aware, in the night, of thunder and of lightning, although he did not wake; and then in the small
hours of the morning he was woken by someone treading, awkwardly, on his feet.\x{201c}Sorry,\x{201d}
said a voice. \x{201c}That is to say, \x{2019}scuse me.\x{201d}\x{201c}Who\x{2019}s that? Who\x{2019}s
there?\x{201d} said Dunstan.\x{201c}Just me,\x{201d} said the voice. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m here for the
market. I was sleeping in a hollow tree for the night, but the lightnin\x{2019} toppled it, cracked
it like an egg it did and smashed it like a twig, and the rain got down my neck, and it threatened
to get into my baggage, and there\x{2019}s things in there must be kept dry as dust, and I\x{2019}d
kept it safe as houses on all my travelings here, though it was wet as\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Water?\x{201d} suggested Dunstan.\x{201c}Ever-so,\x{201d} continued the voice in the darkness.
\x{201c}So I was wonderin\x{2019},\x{201d} it continued, \x{201c}if you\x{2019}d mind me stayin\x{2019}
here under your roof as I\x{2019}m not very big, and I\x{2019}d not disturb you or nothing.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Just don\x{2019}t tread on me,\x{201d} sighed Dunstan.It was then that a flash of lightning
illuminated the byre, and in the light, Dunstan saw something small and hairy in the corner, wearing
a large floppy hat. And then, darkness.\x{201c}I hope I\x{2019}m not disturbin\x{2019} you,\x{201d} said
the voice, which certainly sounded rather hairy, now Dunstan thought about it.\x{201c}You
aren\x{2019}t,\x{201d} said Dunstan, who was very tired.\x{201c}That\x{2019}s good,\x{201d} said the
hairy voice, \x{201c}because I wouldn\x{2019}t want to disturb you.\x{201d} \x{201c}Please,\x{201d}
begged Dunstan, \x{201c}let me sleep. Please.\x{201d}There was a snuffling noise, which was
replaced by a gentle snoring.Dunstan rolled over in the hay. The person, whoever, whatever it was,
farted, scratched itself, and began to snore once more.Dunstan listened to the rain on the byre
roof, and thought about Daisy Hempstock, and in his thoughts they were walking together, and six
steps behind them walked a tall man with a top hat and a small, furry creature whose face Dunstan
could not see.They were off to see his Heart\x{2019}s Desire....\x{a0}There was bright sunlight on his face, and the cow byre was empty.
He washed his face, and walked up to the farmhouse.He put on his very best jacket, and his very best
shirt, and his very best britches. He scraped the mud from his boots with his pocketknife. Then he
walked into the farm kitchen, and kissed his mother on the cheek, and helped himself to a cottage
loaf and a large pat of fresh-churned butter.And then, with his money tied up in his fine Sunday
cambric handkerchief, he walked up to the village of Wall and bade good morning to the guards on the
gate.Through the gap in the wall he could see colored tents being raised, stalls being erected,
colored flags, and people walking back and forth.\x{201c}We\x{2019}re not to let anyone through until
<<midday|13>>,\x{201d} said the guard.Dunstan shrugged, and went to the pub, where he pondered what he would
buy with his savings (the shiny half-crown he had saved, and the lucky sixpence, with a hole drilled
through it, on a leather thong around his neck) and with the additional pocket handkerchief filled
with coins. He had, for the moment, quite forgotten there had been anything else promised the night
before. At the stroke of <<midday|12>> Dunstan strode up to the wall and, nervously, as if he were breaking
the greatest of taboos, he walked through beside, as he realized, the gentleman in the black silk
top hat, who nodded to him.\x{201c}Ah. My landlord. And how are you today, sir?\x{201d}\x{201c}Very
well,\x{201d} said Dunstan.\x{201c}Walk with me,\x{201d} said the tall man. \x{201c}Let us walk
together.\x{201d}They walked across the meadow, toward the tents. \x{201c}Have you been here
before?\x{201d} asked the tall man.\x{201c}I went to the last market, nine years ago. I was only a
boy,\x{201d} admitted Dunstan.\x{201c}Well,\x{201d} said his tenant, \x{201c}remember to be polite, and
take no gifts. Remember that you\x{2019}re a guest. And now, I shall give you the last part of the
rent that I owe you. For I swore an oath. And my gifts last a long time. You and your firstborn
child and his or her firstborn child	It\x{2019}s a gift that will last as long as I live.\x{201d}
\x{201c}And what would that be, sir?\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}Dunstan? He has not\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d} Mrs. Thorn raised one hand to her
mouth.\x{201c}Oh, no,\x{201d} said Mrs. Hempstock, hastily shaking her head and pursing her lips,
\x{201c}nothing like that. He has ignored her. She has not seen him for days and days. She has taken
it into her head that he no longer cares for her, and all she does is hold the snowdrop he gave her,
and she sobs.\x{201d}Mrs. Thorn measured out more tea from the jar into the pot, added hot water.
\x{201c}Truth to tell,\x{201d} she admitted, \x{201c}we\x{2019}re a little concerned about Dunstan,
Thorney and me. He\x{2019}s been mooning. That\x{2019}s the only word for it. His work
isn\x{2019}t getting done. Thorney was saying that he needs some settling down, that boy. If
he\x{2019}d but settle down, why Thorney was saying he\x{2019}d settle all the Westward Meadows on the
lad.\x{201d}Mrs. Hempstock nodded slowly. \x{201c}Hempstock would certainly not be averse to seeing
our Daisy happy. Certain he\x{2019}d settle a flock of our sheep on the girl.\x{201d} The
Hempstocks\x{2019} sheep were notoriously the finest for miles around: shaggy-coated and intelligent
(for sheep), with curling horns and sharp hooves. Mrs. Hempstock and Mrs. Thorn sipped their tea.
And so it was settled.Dunstan Thorn was married in June to Daisy Hempstock. And if the groom seemed
a little distracted, well, the bride was as glowing and lovely as ever any bride has been.Behind
them, their fathers discussed the plans for the farmhouse they would build for the newlyweds in the
western meadow. Their mothers agreed how lovely Daisy looked, and what a pity it was that Dunstan
had stopped Daisy from wearing the snowdrop he had bought for her at the market at the end of April,
in her wedding dress.And it is there we will leave them, in a falling flurry of rose petals, scarlet
and yellow and pink and white.Or almost.They lived in Dunstan\x{2019}s cottage, while their little
farmhouse was erected, and they were certainly happy enough; and the day-to-day business of raising
sheep, and herding sheep, and shearing them, and nursing them, slowly took the faraway look from
Dunstan\x{2019}s eyes.First autumn came, then winter. It was at the end of February, in lambing
season, when the world was cold, and a bitter wind howled down the moors and through the leafless
forest, when icy rains fell from the leaden skies in continual drizzling showers, at <<six in the
evening|9a>>, after the sun had set and the sky was dark, that a wicker basket was pushed through the
space in the wall. The guards, on each side of the gap, at first did not notice the basket. They
were facing the wrong way, after all, and it was dark and wet, and they were busy stamping the
ground and staring gloomily and longingly at the lights of the village.And then a high, keening wail
began.It was then that they looked down, and saw the basket at their feet. There was a bundle in the
basket: a bundle of oiled silk and woolen blankets, from the top of which protruded a red, bawling
face, with screwed-up little eyes, a mouth, open and vocal, and hungry.And there was, attached to
the baby\x{2019}s blanket with a silver pin, a scrap of parchment, upon which was written in an
elegant, if slightly archaic, handwriting the following words:",

            "Tristran read it to himself, looking for something about which he could begin to talk: a
conversational gambit of some kind \x{2014} any kind.He heard his voice saying, \x{201c}You\x{2019}ll
be having rice pudding, then, I would imagine, Miss Forester.\x{201d} As soon as he said it, he knew
it had been the wrong thing to say. Victoria pursed her perfect lips, and blinked her grey eyes, and
said, \x{201c}Yes, Tristran. We shall be having rice pudding.\x{201d}And then she smiled at him, and
said, \x{201c}Mother says that rice pudding in sufficient quantity will help to stave off chills and
colds and other autumnal ailments.\x{201d} \x{201c}My mother,\x{201d} Tristran confessed, \x{201c}has
always sworn by tapioca pudding.\x{201d}He put the list on a spike. \x{201c}We can deliver most of the
provisions tomorrow morning, and the rest of it will come back with Mister Monday, early next
week.\x{201d}There was a gust of wind, then, so strong that it rattled the windows of the village,
and whirled and spun the weathercocks until they could not tell north from west or south from
east.The fire that was burning in the grate of Monday and Brown\x{2019}s belched and twisted in a
flurry of greens and scarlets, topped with a fizz of silver twinkles, of the kind one can make for
oneself at the parlor fire with a handful of tossed iron filings.The wind blew from Faerie and the
East, and Tristran Thorn suddenly found inside himself a certain amount of courage he had not
suspected that he had possessed. \x{201c}You know, Miss Forester, I get off in a few minutes,\x{201d}
he said. \x{201c}Perhaps I could walk you a little way home. It\x{2019}s not much out of my
way.\x{201d} And he waited, his heart in his mouth, while Victoria Forester\x{2019}s grey eyes stared
at him, amused. After what seemed like a hundred years she said, \x{201c}Certainly.\x{201d}Tristran
hurried into the parlor and informed Mr. Brown that he would be off now. And Mr. Brown grunted in a
not entirely ill-natured way and told Tristran that when he was younger he\x{2019}d not only
had to stay late each night and shut up the shop, but that he had also had to sleep on the floor
beneath the counter with only his coat for a pillow.Tristran agreed that he was indeed a lucky young
man, and he wished Mr. Brown a good night, then he took his coat from the coat-stand and his new
bowler hat from the hat-stand, and stepped out onto the cobblestones, where Victoria Forester waited
for him.The autumn twilight turned into deep and early night as they walked. Tristran could smell
the distant winter on the air \x{2014} a mixture of night-mist and crisp darkness and the tang of
fallen leaves.They took a winding lane up toward the Forester farm, and the crescent moon hung white
in the sky and the stars burned in the darkness above them.\x{201c}Victoria,\x{201d} said Tristran,
after a while.\x{201c}Yes, Tristran,\x{201d} said Victoria, who had been preoccupied for much of the
walk.\x{201c}Would you think it forward of me to kiss you?\x{201d} asked Tristran.\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d}
said Victoria bluntly and coldly. \x{201c}Very forward.\x{201d}\x{201c}Ah,\x{201d} said Tristran.They
walked up Dyties Hill, not speaking; at the top of the hill they turned and saw beneath them the
village of Wall, all gleaming candles and lamps glimmering through windows, warm yellow lights that
beckoned and invited; and above them the lights of the myriad stars, which glittered and twinkled
and blazed, chilly and distant and more numerous than the mind could encompass.Tristran reached down
his hand and took Victoria\x{2019}s small hand in his. She did not pull away.\x{201c}Did you see
that?\x{201d} asked Victoria, who was gazing out over the landscape.\x{201c}I saw nothing,\x{201d} said
Tristran. \x{201c}I was looking at you.\x{201d}Victoria smiled in the moonlight.\x{201c}You are the
most lovely woman in all the world,\x{201d} said Tristran, from the bottom of his heart.\x{201c}Get
along with you,\x{201d} said Victoria, but she said it gently.\x{201c}What did you see?\x{201d} asked
Tristran.\x{201c}A falling star,\x{201d} said Victoria. \x{201c}I believe they are not at all uncommon
at this time of year.\x{201d} \x{201c}Vicky,\x{201d} said Tristran. \x{201c}Will you kiss me?\x{201d}
\x{201c}No,\x{201d} she said.\x{201c}You kissed me when we were younger. You kissed me beneath the
pledge-Oak, on your fifteenth birthday. And you kissed me last May Day, behind your father\x{2019}s
cowshed.\x{201d} \x{201c}I was another person then,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}And I shall not kiss you,
Tristran Thorn.\x{201d} \x{201c}If you will not kiss me,\x{201d} asked Tristran, \x{201c}will you marry
me?\x{201d}There was silence on the hill. Only the rustle of the October wind. Then a tinkling sound:
it was the sound of the most beautiful girl in the whole of the British Isles laughing with delight
and amusement.\x{201c}Marry you?\x{201d} she repeated, incredulously. \x{201c}And why ever should I
marry you, Tristran Thorn? What could you give me?\x{201d} \x{201c}Give you?\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I
would go to India for you,Victoria Forester, and bring you the tusks of elephants, and pearls as big
as your thumb, and rubies the size of wren\x{2019}s eggs.\x{201c}I would go to Africa, and bring you
diamonds the size of cricket balls. I would find the source of the Nile and name it after
you.\x{201c}I would go to America \x{2014} all the way to San Francisco, to the gold-fields, and I
would not come back until I had your weight in gold. Then I would carry it back here, and lay it at
your feet.\x{201c}I would travel to the distant northlands did you but say the word, and slay the
mighty polar bears, and bring you back their hides.\x{201d} \x{201c}I think you were doing quite
well,\x{201d} said Victoria Forester, \x{201c}until you got to the bit about slaying polar bears. Be
that as it may, little shop-boy and farm-boy, I shall not kiss you; neither shall I marry
you.\x{201d}Tristran\x{2019}s eyes blazed in the moonlight. \x{201c}I would travel to far Cathay for
you and bring you a huge junk I would capture from the king of the pirates, laden with jade and silk
and opium.\x{201c}I would go to Australia, at the bottom of the world,\x{201d} said Tristran,
\x{201c}and bring you. Um.\x{201d} He ransacked the penny dreadfuls in his head, trying to remember if
any of their heroes had visited Australia. \x{201c}A kangaroo,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}And
opals,\x{201d} he added. He was fairly sure about the opals.Victoria Forester squeezed his hand.
\x{201c}And whatever would I do with a kangaroo?\x{201d} she asked. \x{201c}Now, we should be getting
along, or my father and mother will be wondering what has kept me, and they will leap to some
entirely unjustified conclusions. For I have not kissed you, Tristran Thorn.\x{201d} \x{201c}Kiss
me,\x{201d} he pleaded. \x{201c}There is nothing I would not do for your kiss, no mountain I would not
scale, no river I would not ford, no desert I would not cross.\x{201d}He gestured widely, indicating
the village of Wall below them, the night sky above them. In the constellation of Orion, low on the
Eastern horizon, a star flashed and glittered and fell.\x{201c}For a kiss, and the pledge of your
hand,\x{201d} said Tristran, grandiloquently, \x{201c}I would bring you that fallen star.\x{201d} He
shivered. His coat was thin, and it was obvious he would not get his kiss, which he found puzzling.
The manly heroes of the penny dreadfuls and shilling novels never had these problems getting
kissed.\x{201c}Go on, then,\x{201d} said Victoria. \x{201c}And if you do, I
will.\x{201d}\x{201c}What?\x{201d} said Tristran.\x{201c}If you bring me that star,\x{201d} said
Victoria, \x{201c}the one that just fell, not another star, then I\x{2019}ll kiss you. Who knows what
else I might do. There: now you need not go to Australia, nor to Africa, nor to far Cathay.\x{201d}
\x{201c}What?\x{201d} said Tristran.And Victoria laughed at him, then, and took back her hand, and
began to walk down the hill toward her father\x{2019}s farm.Tristran ran to catch her up. \x{201c}Do
you mean it?\x{201d} he asked her.\x{201c}I mean it as much as you mean all your fancy words of rubies
and gold and opium,\x{201d} she replied. \x{201c}What is an opium?\x{201d} \x{201c}Something in
cough mixture,\x{201d} said Tristran. \x{201c}Like eucalyptus.\x{201d} \x{201c}It does not sound
particularly romantic,\x{201d} said Victoria Forester. \x{201c}Anyway, should you not be running off
to retrieve my fallen star? It fell to the East, over there.\x{201d} And she laughed again.
\x{201c}Silly shop-boy. It is all you can do to ensure that we have the ingredients for rice
pudding.\x{201d} \x{201c}And if I brought you the fallen star?\x{201d} asked Tristran lightly.
\x{201c}What would you give me? A kiss? Your hand in marriage?\x{201d} \x{201c}Anything you
desire,\x{201d} said Victoria, amused.\x{201c}You swear it?\x{201d} asked Tristran.They were walking
the last hundred yards now, up to the Foresters\x{2019} farmhouse. The windows burned with lamplight,
yellow and orange.\x{201c}Of course,\x{201d} said Victoria, smiling.The track to the Foresters\x{2019}
farm was bare mud, trodden into mire by the feet of horses and cows and sheep and dogs. Tristran
Thorn went down on his knees in the mud, heedless of his coat or his woolen trousers. \x{201c}Very
well,\x{201d} he said.The wind blew from the east, then.\x{201c}I shall leave you here, my
lady,\x{201d} said Tristran Thorn. \x{201c}For I have urgent business, to the East.\x{201d} He stood
up, unmindful of the mud and mire clinging to his knees and coat, and he bowed to her, and then he
doffed his bowler hat.Victoria Forester laughed at the skinny shop-boy, laughed long and loud and
delightfully, and her tinkling laughter followed him back down the hill, and away.\x{a0}Tristran Thorn ran all the way home. Brambles
snagged at his clothes as he ran and a branch knocked his hat from his head.He stumbled, breathless
and torn, into the kitchen of the house on Westward Meadows.\x{201c}Look at the state of you!\x{201d}
said his mother. \x{201c}Indeed! I never did!\x{201d}Tristran merely smiled at
her.\x{201c}Tristran?\x{201d} asked his father, who at <<five|9c:1>> and thirty was still middling tall and
still freckled, although there were more than a few silvering hairs in his nut-brown curls.
\x{201c}Your mother spoke to you. Did you not hear her?\x{201d} \x{201c}I beg your pardon, Father,
Mother,\x{201d} said Tristran, \x{201c}but I shall be leaving the village tonight. I may be gone for
some time.\x{201d}\x{201c}Foolishness and silliness!\x{201d} said Daisy Thorn. \x{201c}I never heard
such nonsense.\x{201d}But Dunstan Thorn saw the look in his son\x{2019}s eyes. \x{201c}Let me talk to
him,\x{201d} he said to his wife. She looked at him sharply, then she nodded. \x{201c}Very
well,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}But who\x{2019}s going to sew up the boy\x{2019}s coat? That\x{2019}s
what I would like to know.\x{201d} She bustled out of the kitchen.The kitchen fire fizzed in silver
and glimmered green and violet. \x{201c}Where are you going?\x{201d} asked Dunstan.\x{201c}East,\x{201d}
said his son.East. His father nodded.There were two easts \x{2014} east to the next county,
through the forest, and East, the other side of the wall. Dunstan Thorn knew without asking to which
his son was referring.\x{201c}And will you be coming back?\x{201d} asked his father.Tristran grinned
widely. \x{201c}Of course,\x{201d} he said.\x{201c}Well,\x{201d} said his father. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s
all right, then.\x{201d} He scratched his nose. \x{201c}Have you given any thought to getting through
the wall?\x{201d}Tristran shook his head. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sure I can find a way,\x{201d} he said.
\x{201c}If necessary, I\x{2019}ll fight my way past the guards.\x{201d}His father sniffed.
\x{201c}You\x{2019}ll do no such thing,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}How would you like it if it was you was
on duty, or me? I\x{2019}ll not see anyone hurt.\x{201d} He scratched the side of his nose once more.
\x{201c}Go and pack a bag, and kiss your mother good-bye, and I\x{2019}ll walk you down to the
village.\x{201d}Tristran packed a bag, and his mother brought him six red, ripe apples and a cottage
loaf and a round of white farmhouse cheese, which he placed inside his bag. Mrs. Thorn would not
look at Tristran. He kissed her cheek and bade her farewell.Then he walked into the village with his
father.Tristran had stood his first watch on the wall when he was sixteen years old. He had only
been given one instruction: That it was the task of the guards to prevent anyone from coming through
the gap in the wall from the village, by any means possible. If it was not possible to prevent them,
then the guards must raise the village for help.He wondered as they walked what his father had in
mind. Perhaps the two of them together would overpower the guards. Perhaps his father would create
some kind of distraction and allow him to slip through\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.
perhaps\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.By the time they walked through the village and arrived at the gap in
the wall, Tristran had imagined every possibility, except the one which occurred.On wall duty that
evening were Harold Crutchbeck and Mr. Bromios. Harold Crutchbeck was a husky young man several
years older than Tristran, the miller\x{2019}s son. Mr. Bromios\x{2019}s hair was black, and curled,
and his eyes were green, and his smile was white, and he smelled of grapes and of grape juice, of
barley and of hops.Dunstan Thorn walked up to Mr. Bromios and stood in front of him. He stamped his
feet against the evening chill.\x{201c}Evening, Mister Bromios. Evening, Harold,\x{201d} said
Dunstan.\x{201c}Evening, Mister Thorn,\x{201d} said Harold Crutchbeck.\x{201c}Good evening,
Dunstan,\x{201d} said Mr. Bromios. \x{201c}I trust you are well.\x{201d}Dunstan allowed as that he was;
and they spoke of the weather and agreed that it would be bad for the farmers and that, from the
quantity of holly berries and yew berries already apparent, it would be a cold, hard winter.As he
listened to them talking,Tristran was ready to burst with irritation and frustration, but he bit his
tongue and said nothing.Finally, his father said, \x{201c}Mister Bromios, Harold, I believe you both
know my son Tristran?\x{201d} Tristran raised his bowler hat to them, nervously.And then his father
said something he did not understand.\x{201c}I suppose you both know about where he came from,\x{201d}
said Dunstan Thorn.Mr. Bromios nodded, without speaking.Harold Crutchbeck said he had heard tales,
although you never should mind the half of what you hear.\x{201c}Well, it\x{2019}s true,\x{201d} said
Dunstan. \x{201c}And now it\x{2019}s time for him to go back.\x{201d} \x{201c}There\x{2019}s a
star\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d} Tristran began to explain, but his father hushed him to silence.Mr.
Bromios rubbed his chin and ran a hand through his thatch of black curls. \x{201c}Very well,\x{201d}
he said. He turned and spoke to Harold in a low voice, saying things Tristran could not hear.His
father pressed something cold into his hand.\x{201c}Go on with you, boy. Go, and bring back your
star, and may God and all His angels go with you.\x{201d}And Mr. Bromios and Harold Crutchbeck, the
guards on the gate, stood aside to let him pass.Tristran walked through the gap, with the stone wall
on each side of him, into the meadow on the other side of the wall.Turning, he looked back at the
three men, framed in the gap, and wondered why they had allowed him through.Then, his bag swinging
in one hand, the object his father had pushed into his hand in the other, Tristran Thorn set off up
the gentle hill, toward the woods.",

            "The Stormhold had been carved out
of the peak of Mount Huon by the first lord of Stormhold, who reigned at the end of the First Age
and into the beginning of the Second. It had been expanded, improved upon, excavated and tunneled
into by successive Masters of Stormhold, until the original mountain peak now raked the sky like the
ornately carved tusk of some great, grey, granite beast. The Stormhold itself was perched high in
the sky, where the thunder clouds gathered before they went down to the lower air, spilling rain and
lightning and devastation upon the place beneath.The eighty-first Lord of Stormhold lay dying in his
chamber, which was carved from the highest peak like a hole in a rotten tooth.There is still death
in the lands beyond the fields we know.He summoned his children to his bedside and they came, the
living and the dead of them, and they shivered in the cold granite halls.They gathered about his bed
and waited respectfully, the living to his right side, the dead on his left.Four of his sons were
dead: Secundus, Quintus, Quartus and Sextus, and they stood unmoving, grey figures, insubstantial
and silent.Three of his sons remained alive: Primus, Tertius and Septimus. They stood, solidly,
uncomfortably, on the right of the chamber, shifting from foot to foot, scratching their cheeks and
noses, as if they were shamed by the silent repose of their dead brothers. They did not glance
across the room toward their dead brothers, acting \x{2014} as best they could \x{2014} as if they and
their father were the only ones in that cold room, where the windows were huge holes in the granite
through which the cold winds blew. And whether this is because they could not see their dead
brothers, or because, having murdered them (one apiece, save Septimus, who had killed both Quintus
and Sextus, poisoning the former with a dish of spiced eels, and, rejecting artifice for efficiency
and gravity, simply pushing Sextus off a precipice one night as they were admiring a lightning storm
far below), they chose to ignore them, scared of guilt, or revelation, or ghosts, their father did
not know.Privately, the eighty-first lord had hoped that by the time his end came upon him, six of
the seven young lords at Stormhold would be dead, and but one still alive. That one would be the
eighty-second Lord of Stormhold and Master of the High Crags; it was, after all, how he had attained
his own title several hundred years before.But the youth of today were a pasty lot, with none of the
get-up-and-go, none of the vigor and vim that he remembered from the days when he was young Somebody
was saying something. He forced himself to concentrate.\x{201c}Father,\x{201d} repeated Primus in his
deep boom of a voice. \x{201c}We are all here.What would you do with us?\x{201d}The old man stared at
him. With a ghastly wheezing he pulled a breath of the thin, chill air into his lungs, and then
said, in high, cold tones, like the granite itself, \x{201c}I am dying. Soon my time will be done,
and you will take my remains deep into the mountain, to the Hall of Ancestors, and you will place
them \x{2014} me \x{2014} in the one-and-eightieth hollow you come to, which is to say, the first that
is not occupied, and there you shall leave me. If you do not do this thing, you will each be cursed,
and the tower of Stormhold shall tumble and fall.\x{201d}His three living sons said nothing. A murmur
ran through the four dead sons, though: regret, perhaps, that their remains had been gobbled up by
eagles, or carried away by the fast rivers, tumbled down waterfalls and off to the sea, never to
rest in the Hall of Ancestors.\x{201c}Now. The matter of succession.\x{201d} The lord\x{2019}s voice
wheezed out of him, like the wind being squeezed from a pair of rotten bellows. His living sons
raised their heads: Primus, the oldest, with white hairs in his thick brown beard, his nose
aquiline, his eyes grey, looked expectant; Tertius, his beard red-and-golden, his eyes a tawny
brown, looked wary; Septimus, his black beard still coming in, tall and crowlike, looked blank, as
he always looked blank.\x{201c}Primus. Go to the window.\x{201d}Primus strode over to the opening in
the rock wall and looked out.\x{201c}What do you see?\x{201d}\x{201c}Nothing, sire. I see the evening
sky above us, and clouds below us.\x{201d}The old man shivered beneath the mountain-bear skin that
covered him.\x{201c}Tertius. Go to the window.What do you see?\x{201d}\x{201c}Nothing, Father. It is as
Primus told you. The evening sky hangs above us, the color of a bruise, and clouds carpet the world
beneath us, all grey and writhing.\x{201d}The old man\x{2019}s eyes twisted in his face like the mad
eyes of a bird of prey. \x{201c}Septimus. You. Window.\x{201d}Septimus strolled to the window and
stood beside, although not too close to, his two elder brothers.\x{201c}And you? What do you
see?\x{201d}He looked out of the opening. The wind was bitter on his face, and it made his eyes sting
and tear. One star glimmered, faintly, in the indigo heavens.\x{201c}I see a star,
Father.\x{201d}\x{201c}Ahh,\x{201d} wheezed the eighty-first lord. \x{201c}Bring me to the
window.\x{201d} His four dead sons looked at him sadly as his three living sons carried him to the
window.The old man stood, or almost stood, leaning heavily on the broad shoulders of his children,
staring into the leaden sky.His fingers, swollen-knuckled and twiglike, fumbled with the topaz that
hung on a heavy silver chain about his neck.The chain parted like a cobweb in the old man\x{2019}s
grip. He held the topaz out in his fist, the broken ends of silver chain dangling.The dead lords of
Stormhold whispered amongst themselves in the voices of the dead, which sound like snow falling: the
topaz was the Power of Stormhold.Who wore it would be Stormhold\x{2019}s master, as long as he was of
the blood of Stormhold. To which of the surviving sons would the eighty-first lord give the
stone?The living sons said nothing, but looked, respectively, expectant, wary, and blank (but it was
a deceptive blankness, the blankness of a rock face that one only realizes cannot be climbed when
one is halfway up, and there is no longer any way down).The old man pulled free of his sons, and
stood straight and tall, then. He was, for a heartbeat, the lord of Stormhold who had defeated the
Northern Goblins at the battle of Cragland\x{2019}s Head; who had fathered eight children \x{2014}
seven of them boys \x{2014} on three wives; who had killed each of his four brothers in combat,
before he was twenty years old, although his oldest brother had been almost five times his age and a
mighty warrior of great renown. It was this man who held up the topaz and said <<four|11b:0>> words in a
long-dead tongue, words which hung on the air like the strokes of a huge bronze gong.Then he threw
the stone into the air. The living brothers caught their breath, as the stone arced up over the
clouds. It reached what they were certain must be the zenith of its curve, and then, defying all
reason, it continued to rise into the air.Other stars glittered in the night sky, now.\x{201c}To he
who retrieves the stone, which is the Power of Stormhold, I leave my blessing, and the Mastership of
Stormhold and all its dominions,\x{201d} said the eighty-first lord, his voice losing power as he
spoke, until once again it was the creak of an old, old man, like the wind blowing through an
abandoned house.The brothers, living and dead, stared at the stone. It fell upwards into the sky
until it was lost to sight.\x{201c}And should we capture eagles, and harness them, to drag us into
the heavens?\x{201d} asked Tertius, puzzled and annoyed.His father said nothing.The last of the
daylight faded, and the stars hung above them, uncountable in their glory.One star fell.Tertius
thought, although he was not certain, that it was the first star of the evening, the one that his
brother Septimus had remarked upon.The star tumbled, a streak of light, through the night sky, and
it tumbled down somewhere to the south and west of them.\x{201c}There,\x{201d} whispered the
eighty-first lord, and he fell to the stone floor of his chamber, and he breathed no more.Primus
scratched his beard, and looked down at the crumpled thing. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve half a mind,\x{201d} he
said, \x{201c}to push the old bastard\x{2019}s corpse out of the window. What was all that idiocy
about?\x{201d} \x{201c}Better not,\x{201d} said Tertius. \x{201c}We don\x{2019}t want to see Stormhold
tumble and fall. Nor do we want a curse on our heads, for that matter. Better just place him in the
Hall of Ancestors.\x{201d}Primus picked his father\x{2019}s body up, and carried him back to the furs
of his bed. \x{201c}We will tell the people he is dead,\x{201d} he said.The four dead brothers
clustered with Septimus at the window.\x{201c}What do you think he\x{2019}s thinking?\x{201d} asked
Quintus of Sextus.\x{201c}He\x{2019}s wondering where the stone fell, and how to reach it
first,\x{201d} said Sextus, remembering his fall down the rocks and into eternity.\x{201c}I damned
well hope so,\x{201d} said the late eighty-first master of Stormhold to his four dead sons. But his
three sons who were not yet dead heard nothing at all.",

            "\x{201c}Is there any more?\x{201d} asked Tristran, realizing just
how hungry he was: sometimes a little food can do that to you.\x{201c}Ah now, that\x{2019}s manners
for you,\x{201d} said the little figure, who wore a large, floppy hat and a large, flappy overcoat.
\x{201c}Is there more? he says, as if it were poached quail\x{2019}s eggs and smoked gazelle
and truffles, not just a mushrump, what tastes more or less like something what\x{2019}s been dead
for a week and a cat wouldn\x{2019}t touch. Manners.\x{201d} \x{201c}I really, truly would like
another mushroom,\x{201d} said Tristran, \x{201c}if it\x{2019}s not too much trouble.\x{201d}The little
man \x{2014} if man he was, which Tristran found rather unlikely \x{2014} sighed mournfully and
reached into the pan sizzling on the fire, with his knife, and flicked two large mushrooms into
Tristran\x{2019}s tin bowl.Tristran blew on them, then ate them with his fingers.\x{201c}Look at
you,\x{201d} said the little hairy person, his voice a mixture of pride and gloom,
\x{201c}eatin\x{2019} those mushrumps as if you liked them, as if they wasn\x{2019}t sawdust and
wormwood and rue in your mouth.\x{201d} Tristran licked his fingers and assured his benefactor that
they had been the very finest mushrooms he had ever had the privilege of eating.\x{201c}You says that
now,\x{201d} said his host with gloomy relish, \x{201c}but you\x{2019}ll not be sayin\x{2019} that in an
hour\x{2019}s time.They\x{2019}ll undoubtedly disagree with you, like the fishwife who disagreed with
her young man over a mermaid. And that could be heard from Garamond to Stormhold. Such language! It
fair turned my ears blue, it did.\x{201d} The little hairy personage sighed deeply.
\x{201c}Talkin\x{2019} about your guts,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m going to attend to mine
behind that tree over there.Would you do me the signal honor of keepin\x{2019} an eye on that there
pack of mine? I\x{2019}d be obliged.\x{201d}\x{201c}Of course,\x{201d} said Tristran, politely.The
little hairy man vanished behind an oak tree;Tristran heard a few grunts, and then his new friend
reappeared, saying, \x{201c}There. I knowed a man in Paphlagonia who\x{2019}d swallow a live snake
every morning, when he got up. He used to say, he was certain of one thing, that nothing worse would
happen to him all day. \x{2019}Course they made him eat a bowlful of hairy centipedes before they
hung him, so maybe that claim was a bit presumptive.\x{201d}Tristran excused himself. He urinated
against the side of the oak tree, next to which was a small mound of droppings, certainly not
produced by any human being. They looked like deer pellets, or rabbit-droppings.\x{201c}My name is
Tristran Thorn,\x{201d} said Tristran, when he returned. His breakfast companion had packed up the
morning\x{2019}s breakfast \x{2014} fire, pans and all \x{2014} and made it vanish into his pack.He
removed his hat, pressed it to his chest, and looked up at Tristran. \x{201c}Charmed,\x{201d} he said.
He tapped the side of his pack: on it was written: CHARMED, ENCHANTED, ENSORCELLED AND
CONFUSTICATED. \x{201c}I used to be confusticated,\x{201d} he confided, \x{201c}but you know how these
things go.\x{201d}And with that he set off along the path. Tristran walked behind him. \x{201c}Hey! I
say!\x{201d} called Tristran. \x{201c}Slow down, can\x{2019}t you?\x{201d} For despite the huge pack
(which put Tristran in mind of Christian\x{2019}s burden in Pilgrim\x{2019}s Progress, a book
from which Mrs. Cherry had read to them every Monday morning, telling them that, although it was
written by a tinker, it was a fine book for all of that) the little man \x{2014} Charmed? Was that
his name? \x{2014} was moving away from him as fast as a squirrel up a tree.The little creature
hurried back down the path. \x{201c}Somethin\x{2019} wrong?\x{201d} he asked.\x{201c}I cannot keep
up,\x{201d} confessed Tristran. \x{201c}You walk so confoundedly fast.\x{201d}The little hairy man
slowed his pace. \x{201c}Beg your puddin\x{2019},\x{201d} he said, as Tristran stumbled after him.
\x{201c}Bein\x{2019} on me own so much, I gets used to settin\x{2019} me own pace.\x{201d}They walked
side by side, in the golden-green light of the sun through the newly opened leaves. It was a quality
of light Tristran had observed, unique to springtime. He wondered if they had left summer as far
behind as October. From time to time Tristran would remark on a flash of color in a tree or bush,
and the little hairy man would say something like, \x{201c}Kingfisher. Mr. Halcyon they used to call
him. Pretty bird,\x{201d} or \x{201c}Purple hummingbird. Drinks nectar from flowers. Hovers,\x{201d} or
\x{201c}Redcap.They\x{2019}ll keep their distance, but don\x{2019}t you go scrutinizin\x{2019} \x{2019}em
or looking for trouble, \x{2019}cos you\x{2019}ll find it with those buggers.\x{201d}They sat beside a
brook to eat their lunch. Tristran produced the cottage loaf, the ripe, red apples, and round of
cheese \x{2014} hard, tart and crumbly \x{2014} that his mother had given him. And although the little
man eyed them both suspiciously, he wolfed them down and licked the crumbs of bread and cheese from
his fingers, and munched noisily on the apple. Then he filled a kettle from the brook and boiled it
up for tea.\x{201c}Suppose you tell me what you\x{2019}re about?\x{201d} said the little hairy man as
they sat on the ground and drank their tea.Tristran thought for some moments, and then he said,
\x{201c}I come from the village of Wall, where there lives a young lady named Victoria Forester, who
is without peer among women, and it is to her, and to her alone, that I have given my heart. Her
face is \x{2014}\x{201d} \x{201c}Usual complement of bits?\x{201d} asked the little creature.
\x{201c}Eyes? Nose? Teeth? All the usual?\x{201d} \x{201c}Of course.\x{201d} \x{201c}Well then, you can
skip that stuff,\x{201d} said the little hairy man. \x{201c}We\x{2019}ll take it all as said. So what
damn-fool silly thing has this young lady got you a-doin\x{2019} of?\x{201d}Tristran put down his
wooden cup of tea, and stood up, offended.\x{201c}What,\x{201d} he asked, in what he was certain were
lofty and scornful tones, \x{201c}would possibly make you imagine that my lady-love would have sent
me on some foolish errand?\x{201d}The little man stared up at him with eyes like beads of jet.
\x{201c}Because that\x{2019}s the only reason a lad like you would be stupid enough to cross the
border into Faerie. The only ones who ever come here from your lands are the minstrels, and the
lovers, and the mad. And you don\x{2019}t look like much of a minstrel, and you\x{2019}re \x{2014}
pardon me saying so, lad, but it\x{2019}s true \x{2014} ordinary as cheese-crumbs. So it\x{2019}s love,
if you ask me.\x{201d} \x{201c}Because,\x{201d} announced Tristran, \x{201c}every lover is in his heart
a madman, and in his head a minstrel.\x{201d} \x{201c}Really?\x{201d} said the little man, doubtfully.
\x{201c}I\x{2019}d never noticed. So there\x{2019}s some young lady. Has she sent you here to seek your
fortune? That used to be very popular. You\x{2019}d get young fellers wanderin\x{2019} all over,
looking for the hoard of gold that some poor wyrm or ogre had taken absolute centuries to
accumulate.\x{201d} \x{201c}No. Not my fortune. It was more of a promise I made to this lady I
mentioned. I\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. we were talking, and I was promising her things, and we saw this
falling star, and I promised to bring it to her. And it fell\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d} he waved an
arm toward a mountain range somewhere in the general direction of the sunrise \x{201c}. . . over
there.\x{201d}The little hairy man scratched his chin. Or his muzzle; it might well have been his
muzzle. \x{201c}You know what I would do?\x{201d} \x{201c}No,\x{201d} said Tristran, hope rising within
him, \x{201c}what?\x{201d}The little man wiped his nose. \x{201c}I\x{2019}d tell her to go shove her
face in the pig pen, and go out and find another one who\x{2019}ll kiss you without askin\x{2019} for
the earth.You\x{2019}re bound to find one. You can hardly throw half a brick back in the lands you
come from without hittin\x{2019} one.\x{201d} \x{201c}There are no other girls,\x{201d} said
Tristran confidently.The little man sniffed, and they packed up their things and walked on
together.\x{201c}Did you mean it?\x{201d} said the little man. \x{201c}About the fallen star?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} said Tristran.\x{201c}Well, I\x{2019}d not mention it about if I were you,\x{201d}
said the little man. \x{201c}There\x{2019}s those as would be unhealthily interested in such
information. Better keep mum. But never lie.\x{201d} \x{201c}So what should I
say?\x{201d}\x{201c}Well,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}f\x{2019}r example, if they ask where you\x{2019}ve
come from, you could say \x{2018}Behind me,\x{2019} and if they asked where you\x{2019}re going,
you\x{2019}d say \x{2018}In front of me.\x{2019} \x{201d} \x{201c}I see,\x{201d} said Tristran.The path
they were walking became harder to discern. A cold breeze ruffled Tristran\x{2019}s hair, and he
shivered. The path led them into a grey wood of thin, pale birch trees.\x{201c}Do you think it will
be far?\x{201d} asked Tristran. \x{201c}To the star?\x{201d} \x{201c}How many miles to Babylon?\x{201d}
said the little man rhetorically. \x{201c}This wood wasn\x{2019}t here, last time I was by this
way,\x{201d} he added.\x{201c}How Many Miles to Babylon,\x{201d} recited Tristran, to himself,
as they walked through the grey wood.\x{201c}Three score miles and ten.Can I get there by
candlelight? Yes, and back again.Yes, if your feet are nimble and light,You can
get there by candlelight.\x{201d}\x{201c}That\x{2019}s the one,\x{201d} said the little hairy man,
his head questing from side to side as if he were preoccupied, or a little nervous.\x{201c}It\x{2019}s
only a nursery rhyme,\x{201d} said Tristran.\x{201c}Only a nursery . . . ? Bless me,
there\x{2019}s some on this side of the wall would give seven years\x{2019} hard toil for that little
cantrip. And back where you come from you mutter \x{2019}em to babes alongside of a
\x{2018}Rock-a-Bye-Baby\x{2019} or a \x{2018}Rub-a-Dub-Dub,\x{2019} without a second thought	Are you
chilled, lad?\x{201d} \x{201c}Now that you mention it, I am a bit cold, yes.\x{201d} \x{201c}Look around
you. Can you see a path?\x{201d} Tristran blinked. The grey wood soaked up light and color and
distance. He had thought they were following a path, but now that he tried to see the path, it
shimmered, and vanished, like an optical illusion. He had taken that tree, and that
tree, and that rock as markers of the path\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. but there was no path,
only the mirk, and the twilight, and the pale trees. \x{201c}Now we\x{2019}re for it,\x{201d} said the
hairy man, in a small voice.\x{201c}Should we run?\x{201d} Tristran removed his bowler hat, and held
it in front of him.The little man shook his head. \x{201c}Not much point,\x{201d} he said.
\x{201c}We\x{2019}ve walked into the trap, and we\x{2019}ll still be in it even if we runs.\x{201d}He
walked over to the nearest tree, a tall, pale, birchlike tree trunk, and kicked it, hard. Some dry
leaves fell, and then something white tumbled from the branches to the earth with a dry, whispering
sound.Tristran walked over to it and looked down; it was the skeleton of a bird, clean and white and
dry.The little man shivered. \x{201c}I could castle,\x{201d} he told Tristran, \x{201c}but
there\x{2019}s no one I could castle with\x{2019}d be any better off here than we are....
There\x{2019}s no escape by flying, not judgin\x{2019} by that thing.\x{201d} He nudged the
skeleton with one pawlike foot. \x{201c}And your sort of people never could learn to burrow \x{2014}
not that that\x{2019}d do us much good....\x{201d} \x{201c}Perhaps we could arm ourselves,\x{201d} said
Tristran.\x{201c}Arm ourselves?\x{201d}\x{201c}Before they come.\x{201d}\x{201c}Before they come?
Why \x{2014} they\x{2019}re here, you puddenhead. It\x{2019}s the trees
themselves.We\x{2019}re in a serewood.\x{201d} \x{201c}Serewood?\x{201d}\x{201c}It\x{2019}s me own fault
\x{2014} I should\x{2019}ve been paying more attention to where we was goin\x{2019}. Now you\x{2019}ll
never get your star, and I\x{2019}ll never get my merchandise. One day some other poor bugger lost in
the wood\x{2019}ll find our skellingtons picked clean as whistles and that\x{2019}ll be
that.\x{201d}Tristran stared about him. In the gloom it seemed that the trees were crowding about
more thickly, although he had seen nothing actually move. He wondered if the little man were being
foolish, or imagining things.Something stung his left hand. He slapped at it, expecting to see an
insect. He looked down to see a pale yellow leaf. It fell to the ground with a rustle. On the back
of his hand, a veining of red, wet blood welled up. The wood whispered about them.\x{201c}Is there
anything we can do?\x{201d}Tristran asked.\x{201c}Nothing I can think of. If only we knew where the
true path was\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. even a serewood couldn\x{2019}t destroy the true path. Just hide
it from us, lure us off of it....\x{201d} The little man shrugged, and sighed.Tristran reached his
hand up and rubbed his forehead.\x{201c}I\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I do know where the path
is,\x{201d} he said. He pointed. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s down that way.\x{201d}The little man\x{2019}s
bead-black eyes glittered. \x{201c}Are you sure?\x{201d} \x{201c}Yes, sir. Through that copse and up a
little way to the right. That\x{2019}s where the path is.\x{201d} \x{201c}How do you know?\x{201d} asked
the man.\x{201c}I know,\x{201d} replied Tristran.\x{201c}Right. Come on!\x{201d} And the little
man took his burden and ran, slowly enough that Tristran, his leather bag swinging and banging
against his legs, his heart pounding, his breath coming in gasps, was able to keep up.\x{201c}No! Not
that way. Over to the left!\x{201d} shouted Tristran. Branches and thorns ripped and tore at his
clothes. They ran on in silence.The trees seemed to have arranged themselves into a wall. Leaves
fell around them in flurries, stinging and smarting when they touched Tristran\x{2019}s skin, cutting
and slicing at his clothes. He clambered up the hill, swiping at the leaves with his free hand,
swatting at the twigs and branches with his bag.The silence was broken by something wailing. It was
the little hairy man. He had stopped dead where he stood, and, his head thrown back, had begun to
howl at the sky.\x{201c}Buck up,\x{201d} said Tristran. \x{201c}We\x{2019}re nearly there.\x{201d} He
grasped the little hairy man\x{2019}s free hand in his own larger hand and pulled him forward.And
then they were standing on the true path: a swath of green sward running through the grey wood.
\x{201c}Are we safe here?\x{201d} asked Tristran, panting, and looking about
apprehensively.\x{201c}We\x{2019}re safe, as long as we stay on the path,\x{201d} said the little hairy
man, and he put down his burden, sat down on the grass of the path and stared at the trees about
them.The pale trees shook, although no wind blew, and it seemed to Tristran that they shook in
anger.His companion had begun to shudder, his hairy fingers raking and stroking the green grass.
Then he looked up at Tristran. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t suppose you have such a thing as a bottle of
something spirituous upon you? Or perchance a pot of hot, sweet tea?\x{201d} \x{201c}No,\x{201d} said
Tristran, \x{201c} \x{2019}fraid not.\x{201d}The little man sniffed and fumbled at the lock of his huge
package. \x{201c}Turn round,\x{201d} he said to Tristran. \x{201c}No peekin\x{2019}.\x{201d}Tristran
turned away.There was a rummaging, scuffling noise. Then the sound of a lock clicking shut, and
then, \x{201c}You can turn around, if you like.\x{201d} The little man was holding an enamel bottle.
He was tugging, vainly, at the stopper.\x{201c}Um. Would you like me to help you with that?\x{201d}
Tristran hoped the little hairy man would not be offended by his request. He should not have
worried; his companion thrust the bottle into his hands.\x{201c}Here go,\x{201d} he said.
\x{201c}You\x{2019}ve got the fingers for it.\x{201d}Tristran tugged and pulled out the stopper of the
bottle.He could smell something intoxicating, like honey mixed with wood smoke and cloves. He passed
the bottle back to the little man.\x{201c}It\x{2019}s a crime to drink something as rare and good as
this out of the bottle,\x{201d} said the little hairy man. He untied the little wooden cup from his
belt and, trembling, poured a small amount of an amber-colored liquid into it. He sniffed it, then
sipped it, then he smiled, with small, sharp teeth.\x{201c}Aaaahhhh.That\x{2019}s better.\x{201d}He
passed the cup to Tristran.\x{201c}Sip it slowly,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s worth a
king\x{2019}s ransom, this bottle. It cost me two large blue-white diamonds, a mechanical bluebird
which sang, and a dragon\x{2019}s scale.\x{201d}Tristran sipped the drink. It warmed him down to his
toes and made him feel like his head was filled with tiny bubbles.\x{201c}Good, eh?\x{201d}Tristran
nodded.\x{201c}Too good for the likes of you and me, I\x{2019}m afraid. Still. It hits the spot in
times of trouble, of which this is certainly one. Let\x{2019}s get out of this wood,\x{201d} said the
little hairy man. \x{201c}Which way, though....?\x{201d} \x{201c}That way,\x{201d} said Tristran,
pointing to their left.The little man stoppered and pocketed the little bottle, shouldered his pack,
and the two of them walked together down the green path through the grey wood.After several hours,
the white trees began to thin, and then they were through the serewood and walking between two low
rough-stone walls, along a high bank. When Tristran looked back the way they had come there was no
sign of any wood at all; the way behind them was purple-headed, heathery hills.\x{201c}We can stop
here,\x{201d} said his companion. \x{201c}There\x{2019}s stuff we needs to talk about. Sit
down.\x{201d}He put down his enormous bag and climbed on top of it, so he was looking down at
Tristran, who sat on a rock beside the road. \x{201c}There\x{2019}s something here I\x{2019}m not
properly gettin\x{2019}. Now, tell me.Where are you from?\x{201d} \x{201c}Wall,\x{201d} said Tristran.
\x{201c}I told you.\x{201d} \x{201c}Who\x{2019}s your father and mother?\x{201d}\x{201c}My
father\x{2019}s name is Dunstan Thorn. My mother is Daisy Thorn.\x{201d} \x{201c}Mmm. Dunstan
Thorn\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Mm. I met your father once. He put me up for the night. Not a bad chap,
although he doesn\x{2019}t half go on a bit while a fellow\x{2019}s trying to get a little kip.\x{201d}
He scratched his muzzle. \x{201c}Still doesn\x{2019}t explain\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. there isn\x{2019}t
anythin\x{2019} unusual in your family, is there?\x{201d} \x{201c}My sister, Louisa, can wiggle
her ears.\x{201d} The little hairy man wiggled his own large, hairy ears, dismissively. \x{201c}No,
that\x{2019}s not it,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I was thinkin\x{2019} more of a grandmother who was a
famous enchantress, or an uncle who was a prominent warlock, or a brace of fairies somewhere in the
family tree.\x{201d} \x{201c}None that I know of,\x{201d} admitted Tristran.The little man changed his
tack. \x{201c}Where\x{2019}s the village of Wall?\x{201d} he asked. Tristran pointed. \x{201c}Where are
the Debatable Hills?\x{201d} Tristran pointed once more, without hesitation. \x{201c}Where\x{2019}s the
Catavarian Isles?\x{201d}Tristran pointed to the southwest. He had not known there were
Debatable Hills, or Catavarian Isles until the little man had mentioned them, but he was as
certain in himself of their location as he was of the whereabouts of his own left foot or the nose
on his face.\x{201c}Hmm. Now thens. Do you know where His Vastness the Freemartin Muskish
is?\x{201d}Tristran shook his head.\x{201c}D\x{2019}you know where His Vastness the Freemartin
Muskish\x{2019}s Transluminary Citadel is?\x{201d}Tristran pointed, with certainty.\x{201c}And what of
Paris? The one in France?\x{201d}Tristran thought for a moment. \x{201c}Well, if Wall\x{2019}s over
there, I suppose that Paris must be sort of in the same sort of direction, mustn\x{2019}t it.\x{201d}
\x{201c}Let\x{2019}s see,\x{201d} said the little hairy man, talking to himself as much as to Tristran.
\x{201c}You can find places in Faerie, but not in your world, save for Wall, and that\x{2019}s a
boundary.You can\x{2019}t find people\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. but\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. tell me, lad, can
you find this star you\x{2019}re lookin\x{2019} for?\x{201d} Tristran pointed, immediately.
\x{201c}It\x{2019}s that way,\x{201d} he said.\x{201c}Hmm. That\x{2019}s good. But it still doesn\x{2019}t
explain nuffink. You hungry?\x{201d} \x{201c}A bit. And I\x{2019}m tattered and torn,\x{201d} said
Tristran, fingering the huge holes in his trousers, and in his coat, where the branches and the
thorns had seized at him, and the leaves had cut at him as he ran. \x{201c}And look at my
boots\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d} \x{201c}What\x{2019}s in your bag?\x{201d}Tristran opened his
Gladstone bag. \x{201c}Apples. Cheese. Half a cottage loaf. And a pot of fishpaste. My penknife.
I\x{2019}ve got a change of underwear, and a couple of pairs of woolen socks. I suppose I should have
brought more clothes....\x{201d} \x{201c}Keep the fishpaste,\x{201d} said his traveling companion, and
he rapidly divided the remaining food into two equal piles.\x{201c}You done me a good turn,\x{201d} he
said, munching a crisp apple, \x{201c}and I doesn\x{2019}t forget something like that. First
we\x{2019}ll get your clothes took care of, and then we\x{2019}ll send you off after your
star.Yus?\x{201d} \x{201c}That\x{2019}s extremely kind of you,\x{201d} said Tristran, nervously, slicing
his cheese onto his crust of bread.\x{201c}Right,\x{201d} said the little hairy man.
\x{201c}Let\x{2019}s find you a blanket.\x{201d}\x{a0}At dawn three lords of Stormhold rode down the craggy mountain road
in a coach pulled by six black horses.The horses wore bobbing black plumes, the coach was fresh
painted in black, and each of the lords of Stormhold was dressed in mourning.In the case of Primus,
this took the shape of a long, black, monkish robe; Tertius was dressed in the sober costume of a
merchant in mourning, while Septimus wore a black doublet and hose, a black hat with a black feather
in it, and looked for all the world like a foppish assassin from a minor Elizabethan historical
play.The lords of Stormhold eyed each other, one cautious, one wary, one blank. They said nothing:
had alliances been possible, Tertius might have sided with Primus against Septimus. But there were
no alliances that could be made.The carriage clattered and shook.Once, it stopped, for each of the
three lords to relieve himself. Then it clattered on down the hilly road. Together, the three lords
of Stormhold had placed their father\x{2019}s remains in the Hall of Ancestors. Their dead brothers
had watched them from the doors of the hall, but had said nothing.Toward evening, the coachman
called out, \x{201c}Nottaway!\x{201d} and he reined his team outside a tumbledown inn, built against
what resembled the ruins of a giant\x{2019}s cottage.The three lords of Stormhold got out of the
coach and stretched their cramped legs. Faces peered at them through the bottle-glass windows of the
inn.The innkeeper, who was a choleric gnome of poor disposition, looked out of the door.
\x{201c}We\x{2019}ll need beds aired and a pot of mutton stew on the fire,\x{201d} he called.\x{201c}How
many beds to be aired?\x{201d} asked Letitia the chambermaid, from the stairwell.\x{201c}<<Three|9k:0>>,\x{201d}
said the gnome. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll wager they\x{2019}ll have their coachman sleep with the
horses.\x{201d} \x{201c}Three indeed,\x{201d} whispered Tilly, the pot-girl, to Lacey, the ostler,
\x{201c}when anyone could see a full seven of those fine gentlemen standing in the road.\x{201d}But
when the lords of Stormhold entered there were but three of them, and they announced that their
coachman would sleep in the stables.Dinner was mutton stew, and bread loaves so hot and fresh they
exhaled steam as they were cracked open, and each of the lords took an unopened bottle of the finest
Baragundian wine (for none of the lords would share a bottle with his fellows, nor even permit the
wine to be poured from the bottle into a goblet).This scandalized the gnome, who was of the opinion
\x{2014} not, however, uttered in the hearing of his guests \x{2014} that the wine should be
permitted to breathe.Their coachman ate his bowl of stew, and drank two pots of ale, and went to
sleep in the stables. The three brothers went to their respective rooms and barred the doors.Tertius
had slipped a silver coin to Letitia the chambermaid when she had brought him the warming-pan for
his bed, so he was not surprised at all when, <<shortly before midnight|13>>, there came a tap-tapping on
his door.She wore a one-piece white chemise, and curtsied to him as he opened the door, and smiled,
shyly. She held a bottle of wine in her hand.He locked the door behind him and led her to the bed,
where, having first made her remove her chemise, and having examined her face and body by
candlelight, and having kissed her on the forehead, lips, nipples, navel and toes, and having
extinguished the candle, he made love to her, without speaking, in the pale moonlight.After some
time, he grunted, and was still.\x{201c}There, lovey, was that good, now?\x{201d} asked
Letitia.\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} said Tertius, warily, as if her words guarded some trap. \x{201c}It
was.\x{201d} \x{201c}Would you be wanting another turn, before I leave?\x{201d}In reply, Tertius
pointed between his legs. Letitia giggled. \x{201c}We can have him upstanding again in a
twinkling,\x{201d} she said. And she pulled out the cork from the bottle of wine she had carried in,
and had placed beside the bed, and passed it to Tertius.He grinned at her, and gulped down some
wine, then pulled her to him.\x{201c}I bet that feels good,\x{201d} she said to him. \x{201c}Now,
lovey, this time let me show you how I like it\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. why, whatever is
the matter?\x{201d} For Lord Tertius of Stormhold was writhing back and forth on the bed, his eyes
wide, his breathing labored.\x{201c}That wine?\x{201d} he gasped. \x{201c}Where did you get it?\x{201d}
\x{201c}Your brother,\x{201d} said Letty. \x{201c}I met him on the stairs. He told me it was a fine
restorative and stiffener, and it would provide us with a night we should never forget.\x{201d}
\x{201c}And so it has,\x{201d} breathed Tertius, and he twitched, once, twice, three times, and then
was stiff. And very still.Tertius heard Letitia begin to scream, as if from a very long way away. He
was conscious of four familiar presences standing with him in the shadows beside the wall.\x{201c}She
was very beautiful,\x{201d} whispered Secundus, and Letitia thought she heard the curtains
rustle.\x{201c}Septimus is most crafty,\x{201d} said Quintus. \x{201c}That was the self-same
preparation of baneberries he slipped into my dish of eels,\x{201d} and Letitia thought she heard the
wind howling down from the mountain crags.She opened the door to the household, woken by her
screams, and a search ensued. Lord Septimus, however, was nowhere to be found, and one of the black
stallions was gone from the stable (in which the coachman slept and snored and could not be
wakened).Lord Primus was in a foul mood when he arose the next morning.He declined to have Letitia
put to death, stating she was as much a victim of Septimus\x{2019}s craft as Tertius had been, but
ordered that she accompany Tertius\x{2019}s body back to the castle of Stormhold.He left her one
black horse to carry the body, and a pouch of silver coins. It was enough to pay a villager of
Nottaway to travel with her \x{2014} to ensure no wolves made off with the horse or his
brother\x{2019}s remains \x{2014} and to pay off the coachman when finally he awoke.And then, alone in
the coach, pulled by a team of four coal-black stallions, Lord Primus left the village of Nottaway,
in significantly worse temper than he had arrived there.\x{a0}Brevis arrived at the crossroads tugging at a rope. The rope was
attached to a bearded, horned, evil-eyed billy goat which Brevis was taking to market to sell.That
morning, Brevis\x{2019}s mother had placed a single radish upon the table in front of him and had
said, \x{201c}Brevis, son.This radish was all I was able to pull from the ground today. All our crops
have failed, and all our food has gone.We\x{2019}ve nothing to sell but the billy goat. So I want you
to halter the goat, and take him to the market, and sell him to a farmer. And with the coins you get
for the goat \x{2014} and you\x{2019}ll take nothing less than a florin, mark you \x{2014} buy a hen,
and buy corn, and turnips; and perhaps we shall not starve.\x{201d}So Brevis had chewed his radish,
which was woody, and peppery to the tongue, and spent the rest of the morning chasing the goat about
its pen, sustaining a bruise to the rib and a bite to the thigh in the process, and, eventually, and
with the help of a passing tinker, he had subdued the goat enough to have it haltered, and, leaving
his mother to bandage the tinker\x{2019}s goat-inflicted injuries, he dragged the billy goat toward
the market.Sometimes the goat would take it into his head to charge on ahead, and Brevis would be
dragged behind him, the heels of his boots grinding into the dried mud of the roadway, until the
goat would decide \x{2014} suddenly and without warning, for no reason Brevis was able to discern
\x{2014} to stop. Then Brevis would pick himself up and return to dragging the beast.He reached the
crossroads on the edge of the wood, sweaty and hungry and bruised, pulling an uncooperative goat.
There was a tall woman standing at the crossroads. A circlet of silver sat in the crimson headpiece
that surrounded her dark hair, and her dress was as scarlet as her lips.\x{201c}What do they call
you, boy?\x{201d} she asked, in a voice like musky brown honey.\x{201c}They call me Brevis,
ma\x{2019}am,\x{201d} said Brevis, observing something strange behind the woman. It was a small cart,
but there was nothing harnessed between the shafts. He wondered how it had ever got
there.\x{201c}Brevis,\x{201d} she purred. \x{201c}Such a nice name. Would you like to sell me your
goat, Brevis-boy?\x{201d}Brevis hesitated. \x{201c}My mother told me I was to take the goat to the
market,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}and to sell him for a hen, and some corn, and some turnips, and to
bring her home the change.\x{201d} \x{201c}How much did your mother tell you to take for the
goat?\x{201d} asked the woman in the scarlet kirtle.\x{201c}Nothing less than a florin,\x{201d} he
said.She smiled and held up one hand. Something glinted yellow. \x{201c}Why, I will give you this
golden guinea,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}enough to buy a coopful of hens and a hundred bushels of
turnips.\x{201d} The boy\x{2019}s mouth hung open.\x{201c}Do we have a deal?\x{201d}The boy nodded and
thrust out the hand which held the billy goat\x{2019}s rope halter. \x{201c}Here,\x{201d} was all he
could say, visions of limitless wealth and turnips beyond counting tumbling through his head.The
lady took the rope.Then she touched one finger to the goat\x{2019}s forehead, between its yellow
eyes, and let go of the rope.Brevis expected the billy goat to bolt for the woods or down one of the
roads, but it stayed where it was, as if frozen into position. Brevis held out his hand for the
golden guinea.The woman looked at him then, examining him from the soles of his muddy feet to his
sweaty, cropped hair, and once more she smiled.\x{201c}You know,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}I think that
a matched pair would be so much more impressive than just one. Don\x{2019}t you?\x{201d}Brevis did not
know what she was talking about and opened his mouth to tell her so. But just then she reached out
one long finger, and touched the bridge of his nose, between his eyes, and he found he could not say
anything at all.She snapped her fingers, and Brevis and the billy goat hastened to stand between the
shafts of her cart; and Brevis was surprised to notice that he was walking on four legs, and he
seemed to be no taller than the animal beside him.The witch-woman cracked her whip, and her cart
jolted off down the muddy road, drawn by a matched pair of horned white billy goats.\x{a0}The little hairy man had taken
Tristran\x{2019}s ripped coat and trousers and waistcoat and, leaving him covered by a blanket, had
walked into the village which nestled in the valley between three heather-covered hills.Tristran sat
under the blanket, in the warm evening, and waited.Lights flickered in the hawthorn bush behind him.
He thought they were glow-worms or fireflies, but, on closer inspection, he perceived they were tiny
people, flickering and flitting from branch to branch.He coughed, politely. A score of tiny eyes
stared down at him. Several of the little creatures vanished. Others retreated high into the
hawthorn bush, while a handful, braver than the others, flitted toward him.They began to laugh, in
high, bell-tinkling tones, pointing at Tristran, in his broken boots and blanket, and underclothes,
and bowler hat. Tristran blushed red and pulled the blanket about himself.One of the little folk
sang:\x{a0}Hankety pankety",
