            "In almost every generation, nevertheless, there happened to be some one descendant of the family gifted with a portion of the hard, keen sense, and practical energy, that had so remarkably distinguished the original founder. His character, indeed, might be traced all the way down, as distinctly as if the Colonel himself, a little diluted, had been gifted with a sort of intermittent immortality on earth. At <<two|9m>> or <<three|20a>> epochs, when the fortunes of the family were low, this representative of hereditary qualities had made his appearance, and caused the traditionary gossips of the town to whisper among themselves, \x{201c}Here is the old Pyncheon come again! Now the Seven Gables will be new-shingled!\x{201d} From father to son, they clung to the ancestral house with singular tenacity of home attachment. For various reasons, however, and from impressions often too vaguely founded to be put on paper, the writer cherishes the belief that many, if not most, of the successive proprietors of this estate were troubled with doubts as to their moral right to hold it. Of their legal tenure there could be no question; but old Matthew Maule, it is to be feared, trode downward from his own age to a far later one, planting a heavy footstep, all the way, on the conscience of a Pyncheon. If so, we are left to dispose of the awful query, whether each inheritor of the property\x{2014}conscious of wrong, and failing to rectify it\x{2014}did not commit anew the great guilt of his ancestor, and incur all its original responsibilities. And supposing such to be the case, would it not be a far truer mode of expression to say of the Pyncheon family that they inherited a great misfortune, than the reverse?",

            "So long as any of the race were to be found, they had been marked out from other men\x{2014}not strikingly, nor as with a sharp line, but with an effect that was felt rather than spoken of\x{2014}by an hereditary character of reserve. Their companions, or those who endeavored to become such, grew conscious of a circle round about the Maules, within  the sanctity or the spell of which, in spite of an exterior of sufficient frankness and good-fellowship, it was impossible for any man to step. It was this indefinable peculiarity, perhaps, that, by insulating them from human aid, kept them always so unfortunate in life. It certainly operated to prolong in their case, and to confirm to them as their only inheritance, those feelings of repugnance and superstitious terror with which the people of the town, even after awakening from their frenzy, continued to regard the memory of the reputed witches. The mantle, or rather the ragged cloak, of old Matthew Maule had fallen upon his children. They were half believed to inherit mysterious attributes; the family eye was said to possess strange power. Among other good-for-nothing properties and privileges, one was especially assigned them\x{2014}that of exercising an influence over people\x{2019}s dreams. The Pyncheons, if all stories were true, haughtily as they bore themselves in the <<noonday|13>> streets of their native town, were no better than bond servants to these plebeian Maules, on entering the topsy-turvy commonwealth of sleep. Modern psychology, it may be, will endeavor to reduce these alleged necromancies within a system, instead of rejecting them as altogether fabulous.",

            "<<TOWARDS noon|13>>, Hepzibah saw an elderly gentleman, large and portly, and of remarkably dignified demeanor, passing slowly along on the opposite side of the white and dusty street. On coming within the shadow of the Pyncheon Elm, he stopped, and (taking off his hat, meanwhile, to wipe the perspiration from his brow) seemed to scrutinize, with especial interest, the dilapidated and rusty-visaged House of the Seven Gables. He himself, in a very different style, was as well worth looking at as the house. No better model need be sought, nor could have been found, of a very high order of respectability, which, by some indescribable magic, not merely expressed itself in his looks and gestures, but even governed the fashion of his garments, and rendered them all proper and essential to the man. Without appearing to differ, in any tangible way, from other people\x{2019}s clothes, there was yet a wide and rich gravity about them that must have been a characteristic of the wearer, since it could not be defined as pertaining either to the cut or material. His gold-headed cane, too\x{2014}a serviceable staff, of dark polished wood\x{2014}had similar traits, and, had it chosen to take a walk by itself, would have been recognized anywhere as a tolerably adequate representative of its master. This character\x{2014}which showed itself so strikingly in everything about him, and the effect of which we seek to convey to the reader\x{2014}went no deeper than his station, habits of life, and external circumstances. One perceived him to be  a personage of marked influence and authority; and, especially, you could feel just as certain that he was opulent as if he had exhibited his bank account, or as if you had seen him touching the twigs of the Pyncheon Elm, and Midas-like, transmuting them to gold.",

Otherwise, it is impossible to explain how the people of the neighborhood so soon became aware of the girl\x{2019}s presence. There was a great run of custom, setting steadily in, from <<about ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> until <<towards noon|13>>; relaxing, somewhat, at dinnertime, but recommencing in the afternoon, and, finally, dying away a half an hour or so before the long day\x{2019}s sunset.

            "For example: tradition affirmed that the Puritan had been greedy of wealth; the Judge, too, with all the show of liberal expenditure, was said to be as close-fisted as if his gripe were of iron. The ancestor had clothed himself in a grim assumption of kindliness, a rough heartiness of word and manner, which most people took to be the genuine warmth of nature, making its way through the thick and inflexible hide of a manly character. His descendant, in compliance with the requirements of a nicer age, had  etherealized this rude benevolence into that broad benignity of smile wherewith he shone like a <<noonday|13>> sun along the streets, or glowed like a household fire in the drawing rooms of his private acquaintance. The Puritan\x{2014}if not be-lied by some singular stories, murmured, even at this day, under the narrator\x{2019}s breath\x{2014}had fallen into certain transgressions to which men of his great animal development, whatever their faith or principles, must continue liable, until they put off impurity, along with the gross earthly substance that involves it. We must not stain our page with any contemporary scandal, to a similar purport, that may have been whispered against the Judge. The Puritan, again, an autocrat in his own household, had worn out three wives, and, merely by the remorseless weight and hardness of his character in the conjugal relation, had sent them, one after another, brokenhearted, to their graves. Here the parallel, in some sort, fails. The Judge had wedded but a single wife, and lost her in the third or fourth year of their marriage. There was a fable, however\x{2014}for such we choose to consider it, though not impossibly typical of Judge Pyncheon\x{2019}s marital deportment\x{2014}that the lady got her death blow in the honeymoon, and never smiled again, because her husband compelled her to serve him with coffee every morning at his bedside, in token of fealty to her liege lord and master.",

In the morning, very shortly after breakfast, it was Clifford\x{2019}s custom to fall asleep in his chair; nor, unless accidentally disturbed, would he emerge from a dense cloud of slumber or the thinner mists that flitted to and fro, until well <<towards noonday|13>>. These hours of drowsihead were the season of the old gentlewoman\x{2019}s attendance on her brother, while Phoebe took charge of the shop; an arrangement which the public speedily understood, and evinced their decided preference of the younger shopwoman by the multiplicity of their calls during her administration of affairs. Dinner over, Hepzibah took her knitting work\x{2014}a long stocking of gray yarn, for her brother\x{2019}s winter wear\x{2014}and with a sigh, and a scowl of affectionate farewell to Clifford, and a gesture enjoining watchfulness on Phoebe, went to take her seat behind the counter.

            "He was the grandson of a former Matthew Maule, one of the early settlers of the town, and who had been a famous and terrible wizard in his day. This old reprobate was one of the sufferers when Cotton Mather, and his brother ministers, and the learned judges, and other wise men, and Sir William Phipps, the sagacious governor, made such laudable efforts to weaken the great enemy of souls, by sending a multitude of his adherents up the rocky pathway of Gallows Hill. Since those days, no doubt, it had grown to be suspected that, in consequence of an unfortunate overdoing of a work praiseworthy in itself, the proceedings against the witches had proved far less acceptable to the Beneficent Father than to that very Archenemy whom they were intended to distress and utterly overwhelm. It is not the less certain, however, that awe and terror brooded over the memories of those who died for this horrible crime of witchcraft. Their graves, in the crevices of the rocks, were supposed to be incapable of retaining the occupants who had been so hastily thrust into them. Old Matthew Maule, especially, was known to have as little hesitation or difficulty in rising out of his grave as an ordinary man in getting out of bed, and was as often seen at <<midnight|13>> as living people at <<noonday|13>>. This pestilent wizard (in whom his just  punishment seemed to have wrought no manner of amendment) had an inveterate habit of haunting a certain mansion, styled the House of the Seven Gables, against the owner of which he pretended to hold an unsettled claim for ground rent. The ghost, it appears\x{2014}with the pertinacity which was one of his distinguishing characteristics while alive\x{2014}insisted that he was the rightful proprietor of the site upon which the house stood. His terms were that either the aforesaid ground rent, from the day when the cellar began to be dug, should be paid down, or the mansion itself given up; else he, the ghostly creditor, would have his finger in all the affairs of the Pyncheons, and make everything go wrong with them, though it should be a thousand years after his death. It was a wild story, perhaps, but seemed not altogether so incredible to those who could remember what an inflexibly obstinate old fellow this wizard Maule had been.",

            "Impossible as he at first thought it to comply with Maule\x{2019}s conditions, still, on a second glance, Mr. Pyncheon was of opinion that they might at least be made matter of discussion. He himself had no personal attachment for the house, nor any pleasant associations connected with his childish residence in it. On the contrary, <<after seven|9:0>> and thirty years, the presence of his dead grandfather seemed still to pervade it, as on that morning when the affrighted boy had beheld him, with so ghastly an aspect, stiffening in his chair. His long abode in foreign parts, moreover, and familiarity with many of the castles and ancestral halls of England, and the marble palaces of Italy, had caused him to look contemptuously at the House of the Seven Gables, whether in point of splendor or convenience. It was a mansion exceedingly inadequate to the style of living which it would be incumbent on Mr. Pyncheon to support, after realizing his territorial rights. His steward might deign to occupy it, but never, certainly, the great landed proprietor himself. In the event of success, indeed, it was his purpose to return to England; nor, to say the truth, would he recently have quitted that more congenial home, had not his own fortune, as well as his deceased wife\x{2019}s, begun to give symptoms of exhaustion. The Eastern claim once fairly settled, and put upon the firm basis of actual possession, Mr. Pyncheon\x{2019}s property\x{2014}to be measured by miles, not acres\x{2014}would be worth an earldom, and would reasonably entitle him to solicit, or enable him to purchase, that elevated  dignity from the British monarch.

These silvery beams were already powerful enough to change the character of the lingering daylight. They softened and embellished the aspect of the old house; although the shadows fell deeper into the angles of its many gables, and lay brooding under the projecting story, and within the half-open door. With the lapse of every moment, the garden grew more picturesque; the fruit trees, shrubbery, and flower bushes had a dark obscurity among them. The commonplace characteristics\x{2014}which, at <<noontide|13>>, it seemed to have taken a century of sordid life to accumulate\x{2014}were now transfigured by a charm of romance. A hundred mysterious years were whispering among the leaves, whenever the slight sea breeze found its way thither and stirred them.

The Pyncheon of tonight, who sits in yonder armchair, believes in no such nonsense. Such, at least, was his creed, some few hours since.

            "Indulging our fancy in this freak, we have partly lost the power of restraint and guidance. We distinguish an unlooked-for figure in our visionary scene. Among those ancestral people there is a young man, dressed in the very fashion of today: he wears a dark frock coat, almost destitute of skirts, gray pantaloons, gaiter boots of patent leather, and has a finely wrought gold chain across his breast, and a little silver-headed whalebone stick in his hand. Were we to meet this figure at <<noonday|13>>, we should greet him as young Jaffrey Pyncheon, the Judge\x{2019}s only surviving child, who has been spending the last two years in foreign travel. If still in life, how comes his shadow hither? If dead, what a misfortune! The old Pyncheon property, together with the great estate acquired by the young man\x{2019}s father, would devolve on whom? On poor, foolish Clifford, gaunt Hepzibah, and rustic little Phoebe! But another and a greater marvel greets us! Can we believe our eyes? A stout, elderly gentleman has made his appearance; he has an aspect of eminent respectability, wears a black coat and pantaloons, of roomy width, and might be pronounced scrupulously neat in his attire, but for a broad crimson stain across his snowy neck-cloth and down his shirt bosom. Is it the Judge, or no? How can it be Judge Pyncheon? We discern his figure, as plainly as the flickering moonbeams can show us anything, still seated in the oaken chair! Be the apparition whose it may, it advances to the picture, seems to seize the frame, tries to peep behind it, and turns away, with a frown as black as the ancestral one.",

            "Thank heaven, the night is well-nigh past! The moonbeams have no longer so silvery a gleam, nor contrast so strongly with the blackness of the shadows among which they fall. They are paler now; the shadows look gray, not black. The boisterous wind is hushed. What is the hour? Ah! The watch has at last ceased to tick; for the Judge\x{2019}s forgetful fingers neglected to wind it up, as usual, at <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>>, being half an hour or so before his ordinary bedtime, and it has run down, for the first time in five years. But the great world clock of Time still keeps its beat. The dreary night\x{2014}for, oh, how dreary seems its haunted waste, behind us!\x{2014}gives place to a fresh, transparent, cloudless morn. Blessed, blessed radiance! The day beam\x{2014}even what little of it finds its way into this always dusky parlor\x{2014}seems part of the universal benediction, annulling evil, and rendering all goodness possible, and happiness attainable. Will Judge Pyncheon now rise up from his chair? Will he go forth, and receive the early sunbeams on his brow? Will he begin this new day\x{2014}which God has smiled upon, and blessed, and given to mankind\x{2014}will he begin it with better purposes than the many that have been spent amiss? Or are all the deep-laid schemes of yesterday as stubborn in his heart, and as busy in his brain, as ever?",

If little Phoebe was about the house, I should not mind knocking; but Miss Hepzibah, likely as not, would scowl down at me out of the window, and look cross, even if she felt pleasantly.

            "But, as the little personage could not be induced to approach near enough to explain himself, Phoebe concluded that he had been frightened, on some of his visits to the shop, by her cousin Hepzibah; for the good lady\x{2019}s manifestations, in truth, ran about an equal chance of scaring children out of their wits, or compelling them to unseemly laughter. Still, she felt the more, for this incident, how unaccountably silent and impenetrable the house had become. As her next resort, Phoebe made her way into the garden, where on so warm and bright a day as the present, she had little doubt of finding Clifford, and perhaps Hepzibah also, idling away the <<noontide|13>> in the shadow of the arbor. Immediately on her entering the garden gate, the family of hens half ran, half flew, to meet her; while a strange grimalkin, which was prowling under the parlor window, took to his heels, clambered hastily over the fence, and vanished. The arbor was vacant and its floor, table, and circular bench were still damp, and bestrewn with twigs and the disarray of the past storm. The growth of the garden seemed to have got quite out of bounds; the weeds had taken advantage of Phoebe\x{2019}s absence, and the long-continued rain, to run rampant over the flowers and kitchen vegetables. Maule\x{2019}s well had overflowed its stone border, and made a pool of formidable breadth in that corner of the garden.",

            "Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem, Massachusetts, in a little Georgian house then located on Union Street, in 1804. He lived in Salem for much of his adult life, attended college at Bowdoin, married Sophia Pea-body in 1842 (after a long and public flirtation with her sister, Elizabeth), and eventually gained a position in the Salem customs house in 1846. He had attained some local interest for his story collections Twice-Told Tales  (1837) and Mosses from an Old Manse (1846), written during the three years that he and Sophia lived in the Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts. However, real literary success had eluded him, and as he labored away at his dull political appointment in Salem, he expressed intense frustration at his inability to write. He lost his position with the changing of the political climate in 1848, and left Salem amid a storm of vituperation, made worse by the scathing 1850 introduction to The Scarlet Letter, called \x{201c}The Custom-House,\x{201d} which did not hesitate to vent his professional and personal frustrations with his native city. The Scarlet Letter went on to become a bestseller, and finally brought Hawthorne the recognition that he craved, though echoes of his years of aggravation appear in his infamous complaint, in a letter to his publisher from <<1855|9c:0>>, that \x{201c}America is now wholly given over to a d\x{2014}d mob of scribbling women, and I should have no chance of success while the public taste is occupied with their trash\x{2014}and should be ashamed of myself if I did succeed.\x{201d} Hawthorne would spend the rest of his life moving between the Berkshires, Concord, and Europe, but his mind never fully left Salem behind.",

            "Of course, there was one problem: The Turner-Ingersoll house didn\x{2019}t much resemble the untouched seventeenth-century dwelling of Hawthorne\x{2019}s narrative. It had grown and changed over the generations, and by <<1908|9n:0>> was a hodgepodge of styles ranging from Federal to Victorian, with a bit of everything in between. Emmerton enlisted the aid of architect Joseph Everett Chandler, an expert in the Colonial revival, to return the mansion to its idealized proper form.",

            "In the end, the many onion layers involved in paying a real visit to a real house redone so it better resembles a fictional house that is itself inspired\x{2014}supposedly\x{2014}by a real house, and done to supply funds for the \x{201c}real\x{201d}-ization of would-be (i.e., fictional) Americans who are now real is itself a story about the contested relationship we have with history. Throughout the narrative, Hawthorne, coy to the last, conjures images of generations of long-dead Pyncheons all trapped within the House of the Seven Gables, gathering at <<midnight|13>> in the room where the colonel died in his great chair, worrying over their legacy. Worrying, that is, until the final freeing moment of escape. \x{201c}The past,\x{201d} Hawthorne gives Clifford to remark while riding in flight on his very first train, \x{201c}is but a coarse and sensual prophecy of the present and the future.\x{201d}",
