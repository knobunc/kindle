            "It looked like an ordinary pot: squat and light brown, with a small amount of blue
  glaze as trim. Stephanie was not an expert potter. This pot was one of the first she
  threw, at least outside of her ceramics class in high school. Naturally, one of her
  first pots would go to Fat. She and he had a close relationship. When he\x{2019}d get upset,
  Stephanie would quiet him down by supercharging him with her hashpipe. The pot was
  unusual in one way, however. In it slumbered God. He slumbered in the pot for a long
  time, for almost too long. There is a theory among some religions that God intervenes
  at the eleventh hour. Maybe that is so; I couldn\x{2019}t say. In Horselover Fat\x{2019}s case God
  waited until <<three minutes before twelve|10>>, and even then what he did was barely enough:
  barely enough and virtually too late. You can\x{2019}t hold Stephanie responsible for that;
  she threw the pot, glazed it and fired it as soon as she had the kickwheel. She did
  her best to help her friend Fat, who, like Gloria before him, was beginning to die.
  She helped her friend the way Fat had tried to help his friend, only Stephanie did
  a better job. But that was the difference between her and Fat. In a crisis she knew
  what to do. Fat did not. Therefore Fat is alive today and Gloria is not. Fat had a
  better friend than Gloria had had. Perhaps he would have wanted it the other way around
  but the option was not his. We do not serve up people to ourselves; the universe does.
  The universe makes certain decisions and on the basis of these decisions some people
  live and some people die. This is a harsh law. But every creature yields to it out
  of necessity. Fat got God, and Gloria Knudson got death. It is unfair and Fat would
  be the first person to say so. Give him credit for that.",

  of mere semantics\x{2014}had fired precious information at Horselover Fat\x{2019}s head by which
  their son Christopher\x{2019}s life had been saved. Some people God cures and some he slays.
  Fat denies that God slays anyone. Fat says, God never harms anyone. Illness, pain
  and undeserved suffering arise not from God but from elsewhere, to which I say, How
  did this elsewhere arise? Are there two gods? Or is part of the universe out from
  under God\x{2019}s control? Fat used to quote Plato. In Plato\x{2019}s cosmology, no\x{f6}s or Mind is persuading ananke or blind necessity\x{2014}or blind chance, according to some experts\x{2014}into submission. No\x{f6}s happened to come along and to its surprise discovered blind chance: chaos, in other
  words, onto which no\x{f6}s imposes order (although how this \x{201c}persuading\x{201d} is done Plato nowhere says). According
  to Fat, my friend\x{2019}s cancer consisted of disorder not yet persuaded into sentient shape.
  No\x{f6}s or God had not yet gotten around to her, to which I said, \x{201c}Well, when he did get
  around to her it was too late.\x{201d} Fat had no answer for that, at least in terms of oral
  rebuttal. Probably he sneaked off and wrote about it in his journal. He stayed up

  trial. It was a subject he found endlessly fascinating. Certain Bible Belt bishops
  were out to get him because he had said in several published articles and in his sermons
  preached at Grace Cathedral that no one had seen hide nor hair of the Holy Ghost since
  apostolic times. This had caused Tim to conclude that the doctrine of the Trinity
  was incorrect. If the Holy Ghost was, in fact, a form of God equal to Yahweh and Christ,
  surely he would still be with us. Speaking in tongues did not impress him. He had
  seen a lot of it in his years in the Episcopal Church and it struck him as autosuggestion
  and dementia. Further, a scrupulous reading of Acts disclosed that at Pentecost when
  the Holy Ghost descended on the disciples, giving them \x{201c}the gift of speech,\x{201d} they
  had spoken in foreign languages which people nearby had understood. This is not glossolalia
  as the term is now used; this is xenoglossy. The bishop, as we ate, chortled over
  Peter\x{2019}s deft response to the charge that the Eleven were drunk; Peter had said in
  a loud voice to the scoffing crowd that it was not likely that the Eleven were drunk
