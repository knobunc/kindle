            "As evidenced by the words of Ibn Shaprut that stand as one of this story\x{2019}s epigraphs, the mysterious Jewish Kingdom of the Khazars has always enchanted and even haunted Jews living in the Diaspora. Even today we know little about the Khazars, a people of Turkic origin who settled in, and for a while came to dominate, the Caucasus\x{2013}Black Sea region. It appears that large numbers of them converted to Judaism sometime before <<900|3:0>> c.e. or so, but no one is completely sure to what extent the conversion took place, or for what reasons. No one is very sure of anything about the Khazars, who left few written records. But they seem to have been a dominant force in the region for several hundred years, during which time they were visited by some of the great Arab travelers, whose accounts are our primary sources of information about Khazaria. To write Gentlemen of the Road I read everything about the Khazars that I could get my hands on, including the Travels of Ibn Battuta. Unfortunately, the extensive research undertaken by Russian archaeologists and scholars lay beyond my abilities. My chief source of information was the excellent The Jews of Khazaria, second edition, by Kevin Alan Brook. I also derived a certain sense of atmosphere, and of the historical meaning of the Khazars, from the perhaps unreliable The Thirteenth Tribe by Arthur Koestler. For arms and armor, I made happy use of five volumes of the wonderful Osprey Men-At-Arms series (numbers 85, 89, 105, 320, and 333). Readers interested in looking further into the world and time of the Khazars might also consult the relevant entries in the Encyclopedia Judaica, as well as the following websites:",
