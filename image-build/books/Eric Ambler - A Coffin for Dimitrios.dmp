To Latimer it seemed almost tangible; a dark grey fluid that oozed from the corners of the room. He began to hear the watch ticking on his wrist. He waited for what seemed an eternity before looking at it. When he did look it was <<ten minutes to nine|10>>. Another eternity. He tried to think of something to say to Mr Peters to pass the time. He tried counting the complete parallelograms in the pattern of the wallpaper between the wardrobe and the window. Now he thought he could hear Mr Peters\x{2019} watch ticking. The muffled sound of someone moving a chair and walking about in the room overhead seemed to intensify the silence. <<Four minutes to nine|10>>.",
