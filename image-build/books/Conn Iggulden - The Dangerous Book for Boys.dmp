It is no hardship to \x{2018}walk through a dark valley\x{2019}. On the other hand, \x{2018}the valley of the shadow of death\x{2019} is a different matter. Frankly, the rhythm and poetry are part of the effect and not to be lightly cast aside. We can find no better example of this than the Ten Commandments themselves.
