            "The pitch. Length: 100\x{2013}130 yds (90 m\x{2013}120 m). Width: 50\x{2013}100 yds (45 m\x{2013}90 m). The two long lines are called touchlines, the two short lines are called goal lines. The pitch is divided by a halfway line, with a centre point where the \x{2018}kick-off\x{2019} occurs to begin the match. At each goal, there is a 6-yard box (5.5 m) known as the goal area. Outside that, there is an 18-yard box (16.5 m) known as the penalty area. A penalty spot is drawn 12 yards (11 m) in front of the goalposts. The goalposts are 8 yards (<<7.32|5a:1>> m) apart and 8ft (<<2.44|5a:1>> m) high.
The ball. Circumference: between 27 and 28 inches (68\x{2013}70 cm). Weight: between 14 and 16 oz (410\x{2013}450 g).
The teams. No more than eleven players can be fielded by each team, including the goalkeeper. Depending on the competition, between three and seven substitutes can be used. In addition, any player can change places with the goalkeeper provided that the referee is told and the change occurs while play has stopped.
Clothing. Players wear football shirts, shorts, shinguards under long socks and football boots. Goalkeepers wear different-coloured kits.
The referee. All decisions by the referee are final. Powers include the ability to give a verbal warning, a more serious yellow card warning, or a red card, which results in immediate sending off. A second yellow card is equivalent to a red. The referee also acts as timekeeper for the match and controls any restarts after stopped play.
Assistant referees (linesmen). These indicate with a raised flag when a ball has crossed the lines and gone out of play, and let the referee know which side is to take the corner, goal kick, or throw-in. They also raise their flags to indicate when a player may be penalised for being in an offside position.
Duration. Two halves of forty-five minutes, with a half-time interval of no more than fifteen minutes.
Starting. Whichever team wins a coin-toss kicks off and begins play. The ball returns to the centre spot after a goal and at the start of the second half. All opposing players must be in their own half at kick-off \x{2013} at least ten yards (<<9.15|5a:1>> m) from the ball.
In and out. The ball is out of play when it crosses any of the touchlines or goal lines, or if play has been stopped by the referee. It is in play at all other times.
Scoring. The whole ball has to pass over the goal line. If a member of the defending team knocks it in by accident, it is an \x{2018}own goal\x{2019} and still valid. Whoever scores the most goals wins.
Offside. The offside rule is designed to stop players hanging around the goal of their opponents, waiting for a long ball to come to them. A player is given offside if the ball is passed to him while he is nearer to the goal than the ball and the second-last defender. Note that players are allowed to sit on the goal line if they want, but the ball cannot come to them without offside being called by the referee. An \x{2018}offside trap\x{2019} is when defenders deliberately move up the field to leave a forward player in a position where he cannot take the ball without being called offside. It is not an offside offence if the ball comes to a player from a throw-in, a goal kick or a corner kick.
Fouls. Direct and indirect free kicks can be given to the opposing team if the referee judges a foul has been committed. The kick is taken from where the foul occurred, so if it is close to the opponent\x{2019}s goal, the game can easily hinge on the outcome. Fouls can range from touching the ball with the hands to kicking an opponent. In addition, the player can be cautioned or sent off depending on the offence.
Free kicks. Direct free kicks can be a shot at goal if the spot is close enough, so are given for more serious fouls. The ball is stationary when kicked. Opposing players are not allowed closer than ten yards (<<9.15|5a:1>> m), which has come to mean in practice that the opposing team put a wall of players ten yards from the spot to obscure the kicker\x{2019}s vision. Indirect free kicks cannot be directly at goal, but must first be passed to another player.
Penalties. These are awarded for the same offences as direct free kicks \x{2013} if the offence happens inside the penalty area of the opposing team. This is to prevent what are known as \x{2018}professional fouls\x{2019}, where an attacker is brought down deliberately to stop him scoring. The goalkeeper must remain on his goal line between the posts until the ball has been kicked. Other players must be outside the penalty area and at least ten yards from the penalty spot \x{2013} that\x{2019}s why there\x{2019}s an arc on the penalty area. The penalty must be a single strike at the goal. As long as it goes in, it can hit the posts and/or goalkeeper as well. In the normal run of play, a penalty kick that rebounds off the keeper is back in play and can be struck again. In a penalty shootout, this does not apply and there is only one chance to score.
Throw-ins. A player must face inwards to the field and have both feet on the ground, on or behind the touchline. Both hands must be used and the ball must be delivered from behind the head. The thrower must pass the ball to another player before he can touch it again.
Goal kicks. These are given when the opposing team kick the ball over the opposing goal line, after a missed shot at goal, for example. The goal kick is taken from anywhere within the goal area and the ball must pass out of the penalty area before another player can touch it.
Corner kicks. These are given when a member of the defending team knocks the ball over his own goal line. The goalkeeper may do this in the process of saving a goal, for example, or a defender may do it quite deliberately to prevent a shot reaching goal. Many goals are scored from corner kicks, so the tension is always high when one is given.

Defending players must remain at least ten yards (<<9.15|5a:1>> m) from the ball until it is kicked. In practice, they group themselves around the goalmouth. Defenders work hard to prevent attackers finding a free space. Attackers work to drop their marking defender, get the ball as it comes in and either head or kick it into the goal. A goalkeeper is hard-pressed during corners. Visibility is reduced due to the number of people involved and the ball can come from almost anywhere with very little time to react.",

Yet two of the veteran divisions made it to the crest through fierce hand-to-hand fighting. This was a crucial point in the battle, but it was saved by the Household Brigade and Union Brigade cavalry under the Earl of Uxbridge, who smashed the French attackers with a charge over the ridge.",

MOON FACTS

Distance from earth: because of an elliptical orbit, this varies, but on average is 240,000 miles (386,000 km).
Gravity: <<about 1|9:0>>/6 of earth.
Day length: 27.3 earth days.
Time to orbit earth in relation to a fixed star (sidereal month): 27.3 earth days.
Time in relation to the sun (new moon to new moon/synodic month): 29.5 days.
Because it takes 27.3 days to orbit earth and turn on its own axis, we always see the same face. (See Questions About the World \x{2013} Part Two.) However, there is no dark side in the sense of lacking light. Like earth, there is a night and day side, but both receive light during the cycle. The \x{2018}dark side\x{2019} of the moon just doesn\x{2019}t exist!
The moon has no atmosphere, which means no wind, so Neil Armstrong\x{2019}s original footprint will still be there exactly as it was in 1969 \x{2013} unless Buzz Aldrin or one of the others scuffed it over.
Daytime temperatures can reach up to 273 \x{b0}F (134 \x{b0}C). That is almost three times as hot as the Sahara Desert on earth. Night-time temperatures can be as low as \x{2013}243 \x{b0}F (\x{2013}152 \x{b0}C). Needless to say, human beings cannot survive such an extreme range without a great deal of protection.
The American flag planted by the Apollo 11 astronauts had to be made out of metal. Without an atmosphere, a cloth flag would have hung straight down.
The moon is silent. Without air or some other medium, sound waves cannot travel.
We owe many of the beautifully named parts of the moon to Galileo. It was he who thought he saw oceans on the moon in 1609, giving us Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquillity), Mare Nectaris (Sea of Nectar), Mare Imbrium (Sea of Showers), Mare Serenitatis (Sea of Serenity) and many more. Sadly, they are dry depressions and not the great oceans of his imagination.

AND THE NUMBERS\x{a0}\x{2026}
There are only seven kinds of Roman numerals. These are: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. (1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000.) From just those seven, all other numbers can be made. The only difficulty comes in recognising that some numbers, like four and nine, are made by IV and IX \x{2013} one less than five, one less than ten. This pattern is used all through Roman numerals, so nine hundred and ninety-nine will be IM. That\x{2019}s it. Spend ten minutes on this page and then go and read any gravestone you wish.",

It has 11 rings and more than 20 confirmed moons, though as with Saturn and Jupiter, there are probably many more we haven\x{2019}t spotted yet. It is 67 times bigger than Earth, but has a mass only 14.5 times that of Earth, qualifying it for gas giant status, though on a smaller scale to Saturn and Jupiter.
The space probe Voyager 2 reached Uranus in 1986, our only source of knowledge at the time of writing, apart from Earth observation.
Rotation around Sun: 84 Earth years, though it spins on its own axis even faster than Earth \x{2013} <<17.25 hours|1>>.
Uranus has an atmosphere of 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane. The planet core is nothing more than rock and ice. It has a huge tilt on its polar axis, so that one pole then the other points at the Sun. This means each pole receives sunlight for 42 Earth years. Average temperature: \x{2013}197 \x{b0}C (\x{2013}323 \x{b0}F) to \x{2013}220 \x{b0}C (\x{2013}364 \x{b0}F).
Moons: 27. All named after Shakespeare characters, with names like: Cordelia (closest), Ophelia, Bianca, Puck, Rosalind, Desdemona, and so on.
In mythology, Uranus was the father of Saturn, grandfather to Zeus/Jupiter.
