            'Unless he was a consummate actor, a fraud simulating an astonishment he did not feel, this was an utterly convincing demonstration that he was still in the past. His words, his feelings, his innocent wonder, his struggle to make sense of what he saw, were precisely those of an intelligent young man in the forties faced with the future, with what had not yet happened, and what was scarcely imaginable. \'This more than anything else,\' I wrote in my notes, \'persuades me that his cut-off <<around 1945|18:0>> is genuine . . . What I showed him, and told him, produced the authentic amazement which it would have done in an intelligent young man of the pre-Sputnik era.\'',

            '( A very similar situation happened with muscular dystrophy, which was never seen until Duchenne described it in the 1850s. By <<1860|9n:0>>, after his original description, many hundreds of cases had been recognised and described, so much so that Charcot said: \'How come that a disease so common, so widespread, and so recognisable at a glance- a disease which has doubtless always existed-how come that it is only recognised now? Why did we need M. Duchenne to open our eyes?\'',

            '*Indeed such a novel has been written. Shortly after \'The Lost Mariner\' (Chapter Two) was published, a young writer named David Gilman sent me the manuscript of his book Croppy Boy, the story of an amnesiac like Mr Thompson, who enjoys the wild and unbridled license of creating identities, new selves, as he whims, and as he must-an astonishing imagination of an amnesiac genius, told with positively Joycean richness and gusto. 1 do not know whether it has been published; <<1 am|5>> very sure it should be. I could not help wondering whether Mr Gilman had actually met (and studied) a \'Thompson\'-as I have often wondered whether Borges\' \'Funes\', so uncannily similar to Luria\'s Mnemonist, may have been based on a personal encounter with such a mnemonist.',

            'If I encountered \'reminiscence\' occasionally in the context of epilepsy or migraine, I encountered it commonly in my post-ence-phalitic patients excited by L-Dopa-so much so that I found myself calling L-Dopa \'a sort of strange and personal time-machine\'. It was so dramatic in one patient that I made her the subject of a Letter to the Editor, published in the Lancet in June 1970, and reprinted below. Here, I found myself thinking of \'reminiscence\' in its strict, Jacksonian sense, as a convulsive upsurge of memories from the remote past. Later, when I came to write the history of this patient (Rose R.) in Awakenings, I thought less in terms of \'reminiscence\' and more in terms of \'stoppage\' (\'Has she never moved on from <<1926|9c:0>>?\' I wrote)-and these are the terms in which Harold Pinter portrays \'Deborah\' in A Kind of Alaska.',

            'Jose had drawn the watch with remarkable fidelity, putting in every feature (at least every essential feature-he did not put in \'Westclox, shock resistant, made in USA), not just \'the time\' (though this was faithfully registered as <<11:31|2>>), but every second as well, and the inset seconds dial, and, not least, the knurled winder and trapezoid clip of the watch, used to attach it to a chain. The clip was strikingly amplified, though everything else remained in due proportion. And the figures, now that I came to look at them, were of different sizes, different shapes, different styles-some thick, some thin; some aligned, some inset; some plain and some elaborated, even a bit \'gothic\'. And the inset second hand, rather inconspicuous in the original, had been given a striking prominence, like the small inner dials of star clocks, or astrolabes.',
