Gulf Oil Corporation, ITT (International Telephone and Telegraph), American Airlines, and other huge American corporations had made illegal contributions, running into millions of dollars, to the Nixon campaign.
In September of 1971, shortly after the New York Times printed Daniel Ellsberg\x{2019}s copies of the top-secret Pentagon Papers, the administration planned and carried out\x{2014}Howard Hunt and Gordon Liddy themselves doing it\x{2014}the burglary of the office of Ellsberg\x{2019}s psychiatrist, looking for Ellsberg\x{2019}s records.
After the Watergate burglars were caught, Nixon secretly pledged to give them executive clemency if they were imprisoned, and suggested that up to a million dollars be given them to keep them quiet. In fact, \$450,000 was given to them, on Erlichman\x{2019}s orders.
Nixon\x{2019}s nominee for head of the FBI (J. Edgar Hoover had recently died), L. Patrick Gray, revealed that he had turned over the FBI records on its investigation of the Watergate burglary to Nixon\x{2019}s legal assistant, John Dean, and that Attorney General Richard Kleindienst (Mitchell had just resigned, saying he wanted to pursue his private life) had ordered him not to discuss Watergate with the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Two former members of Nixon\x{2019}s cabinet\x{2014}John Mitchell and Maurice Stans\x{2014}were charged with taking \$250,000 from a financier named Robert Vesco in return for their help with a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of Vesco\x{2019}s activities.
It turned out that certain material had disappeared from FBI files\x{2014}material from a series of illegal wiretaps ordered by Henry Kissinger, placed on the telephones of four journalists and thirteen government officials\x{2014}and was in the White House safe of Nixon\x{2019}s adviser John Erlichman.
One of the Watergate burglars, Bernard Barker, told the Senate committee that he had also been involved in a plan to physically attack Daniel Ellsberg while Ellsberg spoke at an antiwar rally in Washington.
A deputy director of the CIA testified that Haldeman and Ehrlichman told him it was Nixon\x{2019}s wish that the CIA tell the FBI not to pursue its investigation beyond the Watergate burglary.
Almost by accident, a witness told the Senate committee that President Nixon had tapes of all personal conversations and phone conversations at the White House. Nixon at first refused to turn over the tapes, and when he finally did, they had been tampered with: <<eighteen and a half minutes of one|10>> tape had been erased.
In the midst of all this, Nixon\x{2019}s Vice-President, Spiro Agnew, was indicted in Maryland for receiving bribes from Maryland contractors in return for political favors, and resigned from the vice-presidency in October 1973. Nixon appointed Congressman Gerald Ford to take Agnew\x{2019}s place.
Over \$10 million in government money had been used by Nixon on his private homes in San Clemente and Key Biscayne on grounds of \x{201c}security,\x{201d} and he had illegally taken\x{2014}with the aid of a bit of forgery\x{2014}a \$576,000 tax deduction for some of his papers.
It was disclosed that for over a year in 1969\x{2013}1970 the U.S. had engaged in a secret, massive bombing of Cambodia, which it kept from the American public and even from Congress.

It was a swift and sudden fall. In the November 1972 presidential election, Nixon and Agnew had won 60 percent of the popular vote and carried every state except Massachusetts, defeating an antiwar candidate, Senator George McGovern. By June of 1973 a Gallup poll showed 67 percent of those polled thought Nixon was involved in the Watergate break-in or lied to cover up.",
