The first settlement seems to have been Pithecusae, on the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples; it was not a city but a trading station and is dated by archaeological evidence not later than 775 B.C. By <<700|3:1>> there were Greek cities in Italy: Cumae, on the mainland opposite Ischia; Rhegium (Reggio Calabria), on the toe of the Italian boot; and the proverbially wealthy city of Sybaris, on the instep, as well as Taras (Taranto) in the same area. On the neighboring island of Sicily, Syracuse and Zancle (Messina) were founded around 725. Still later were to come settlements on the southern coast of France: Massilia (Marseilles), Antipas (Antibes) and Nicaea (Nice), as well as Cyrene on the coast of what is now Libya.',

Achilles has been told by his mother, Thetis, that his death will come soon after Hector\x{2019}s, but he will not renounce his passionate resolve to avenge Patroclus\x{2019} death.

In the Odyssey the hero\x{2019}s death is foretold by Tiresias in the underworld. After he has killed the suitors, Tiresias tells him, he must make his peace with the god Poseidon by traveling inland, carrying an oar on his shoulder, until he reaches a people utterly ignorant of the sea and ships. When one of them asks him why he is carrying a winnowing fan on his shoulder, he is to fix the oar in the ground and make an extraordinary sacrifice\x{a0}\x{2014}a bull, a ram and a boar\x{a0}\x{2014}to Poseidon. Once returned home, he is to sacrifice to all the Olympian gods in turn. \x{201c}And at last your own death,\x{201d} says Tiresias,",
