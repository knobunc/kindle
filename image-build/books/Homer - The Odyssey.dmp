            "Yet with longer repetitions in the Odyssey I like to repeat my English version closely, especially if the context shifts the function of the passage, and the opportunities for irony may be ample. For instance, the rituals prior to dining\x{a0}\x{2014}rinsing the hands, serving the appetizers and the bread, and drawing a table toward a guest\x{a0}\x{2014}recur, hospitably, in Ithaca and Sparta and Phaeacia, but in Circe\x{2019}s house they are part of her seductions, all of which Odysseus resists until the witch, who turned his shipmates into pigs, turns them back again to men. With one of the longest recurrent passages in the poem, Penelope\x{2019}s deception of her suitors, the translation, like Homer\x{2019}s original, repeats almost verbatim the weaving and unweaving of her web. First Antinous describes it in Book 2.101\x{2013}22, indicting Penelope before the Ithacan assembly while, as the Introduction observes, paying \x{201c}reluctant tribute to the subtlety of her delaying tactics.\x{201d} Then when she describes her weaving in Book 19.153\x{2013}75\x{a0}\x{2014} adding her own words of indignation in 173\x{2013}74\x{a0}\x{2014}she defends herself, her fidelity and her finesse before the nameless stranger, though some suggest she is also secretly appealing to the man she senses is Odysseus. And finally in Book 24.139\x{2013}61, a leading suitor, Amphimedon\x{a0}\x{2014}killed by Odysseus and new to the world of the dead\x{a0}\x{2014}cries out against Penelope\x{2019}s duplicity to the ghost of Agamemnon, who had been murdered by Clytemnestra, his duplicitous wife. The suitor may trust that the warlord will be outraged when he hears of another wife\x{2019}s deceptions, but of course the wife of Odysseus, deliberately or not, sped the work of her avenging husband. That\x{2019}s what impresses Agamemnon, and so he calls for \x{201c}a glorious song in praise of self-possessed Penelope\x{201d} (24.218, see note <<1.34|5a:0>>\x{2013}55)\x{a0}\x{2014}the song that Homer has provided in the Odyssey. All in all, then, I have tried for repetition with a difference when variation seems of use, yet for virtual repetition in the longer passages, particularly when the weave of right and wrong, the Homeric moral fabric, is at issue.",

Princeton University gave me generous leaves of absence in the spring of 1992 and, adding a McCosh Faculty Fellowship for good measure, throughout the spring and fall semesters three years later.

Aegisthus, / the man Agamemnon\x{2019}s son, renowned Orestes, killed: Throughout the Odyssey, the events in the House of Atreus will provide a continuous background to Homer\x{2019}s narrative. Taken in sequence, these events begin with the successful vengeance of Orestes\x{a0}\x{2014}which is chosen by Zeus as an example of justice (ref)\x{a0}\x{2014}then are used by Athena to rouse the courage of Telemachus (ref), and then by Nestor (ref) not only to encourage the prince but also to caution him with the additional stories of Clytemnestra\x{2019}s infidelity and the wanderings of Menelaus, absent from Argos when Agamemnon was assassinated. Next Menelaus tells Telemachus how Proteus informed him of Agamemnon\x{2019}s murder by Aegisthus (ref); and the crime is dramatized when, in the underworld, Odysseus learns from the ghost of Agamemnon how both he and Cassandra were murdered by his wife together with her lover (ref). However optimistic the climax of Orestes\x{2019} vengeance, in other words, each version of Agamemnon\x{2019}s death presents a greater darkness, and so a starker foil for the luminous reunion of Odysseus and Penelope; until at the end of the Odyssey (ref) Agamemnon\x{2019}s ghost calls for a song to immortalize the virtue of Penelope and another to condemn the perfidy of Clytemnestra. As W. B. Stanford observes (his note 24.196\x{2013}98), Homer has provided the first, and Aeschylus, in the Oresteia, the second. See note ref.",

young champions rose for competition: The translation attempts to gloss the Homeric names of the Phaeacian competitors in terms of their root meanings in Greek, all of them fittingly nautical for a seafaring people.
