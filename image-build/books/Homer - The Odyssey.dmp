The first settlement seems to have been Pithecusae, on the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples; it was not a city but a trading station and is dated by archaeological evidence not later than 775 B.C. By <<700|3:1>> there were Greek cities in Italy: Cumae, on the mainland opposite Ischia; Rhegium (Reggio Calabria), on the toe of the Italian boot; and the proverbially wealthy city of Sybaris, on the instep, as well as Taras (Taranto) in the same area. On the neighboring island of Sicily, Syracuse and Zancle (Messina) were founded around 725. Still later were to come settlements on the southern coast of France: Massilia (Marseilles), Antipas (Antibes) and Nicaea (Nice), as well as Cyrene on the coast of what is now Libya.',

Achilles has been told by his mother, Thetis, that his death will come soon after Hector\x{2019}s, but he will not renounce his passionate resolve to avenge Patroclus\x{2019} death.

In the Odyssey the hero\x{2019}s death is foretold by Tiresias in the underworld. After he has killed the suitors, Tiresias tells him, he must make his peace with the god Poseidon by traveling inland, carrying an oar on his shoulder, until he reaches a people utterly ignorant of the sea and ships. When one of them asks him why he is carrying a winnowing fan on his shoulder, he is to fix the oar in the ground and make an extraordinary sacrifice\x{a0}\x{2014}a bull, a ram and a boar\x{a0}\x{2014}to Poseidon. Once returned home, he is to sacrifice to all the Olympian gods in turn. \x{201c}And at last your own death,\x{201d} says Tiresias,",

Aegisthus, / the man Agamemnon\x{2019}s son, renowned Orestes, killed: Throughout the Odyssey, the events in the House of Atreus will provide a continuous background to Homer\x{2019}s narrative. Taken in sequence, these events begin with the successful vengeance of Orestes\x{a0}\x{2014}which is chosen by Zeus as an example of justice (ref)\x{a0}\x{2014}then are used by Athena to rouse the courage of Telemachus (ref), and then by Nestor (ref) not only to encourage the prince but also to caution him with the additional stories of Clytemnestra\x{2019}s infidelity and the wanderings of Menelaus, absent from Argos when Agamemnon was assassinated. Next Menelaus tells Telemachus how Proteus informed him of Agamemnon\x{2019}s murder by Aegisthus (ref); and the crime is dramatized when, in the underworld, Odysseus learns from the ghost of Agamemnon how both he and Cassandra were murdered by his wife together with her lover (ref). However optimistic the climax of Orestes\x{2019} vengeance, in other words, each version of Agamemnon\x{2019}s death presents a greater darkness, and so a starker foil for the luminous reunion of Odysseus and Penelope; until at the end of the Odyssey (ref) Agamemnon\x{2019}s ghost calls for a song to immortalize the virtue of Penelope and another to condemn the perfidy of Clytemnestra. As W. B. Stanford observes (his note 24.196\x{2013}98), Homer has provided the first, and Aeschylus, in the Oresteia, the second. See note ref.",
