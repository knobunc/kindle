            "Basically the Tractatus is the first real attempt at exploring the now-trendy relation between language and the \x{201c}reality\x{201d} it is language\x{2019}s putative function to capture, map, & represent. The Tractatus\x{2019}s project is Kantian: what must the world be like if language is even to be possible? The early Wittgenstein, much under the spell of Russell and the Principia Mathematica that revolutionized modern logic, saw language, like math, as logic-based, and viewed the paradigmatic function of language as mirroring or \x{201c}picturing\x{201d} the world. From this latter belief everything in the Tractatus follows, just as Kate\x{2019}s own fetish for paintings, mirrors, & the status of mental representations like memories & associations & perceptions forms the gessoed canvas on which her memoir must be sketched. The Wittgenstein of the Tractatus chose as the paradigm of language the truth-functional logic of Russell & Whitehead\x{2019}s Principia. His choice made practical sense, project-wise: if you\x{2019}re going to try to construe the world from human language, you\x{2019}ll be best off choosing the most perspicuous, precise type of language available\x{2014}one faithful to Wittgenstein\x{2019}s belief that the business of language is to state facts\x{2014}as well as selecting the most direct & uncontroversial relation between a language and its world of referents. The latter, Iiterate & stress, is simply the relation of mirror to mirrored; and the criterion by which to judge the perspicuity of a statement is entirely & only its fidelity to that feature of the world it denotes: q.v. W\x{2019}s \x{201c}The statement is a picture of the fact.\x{201d} Now, technically, the Russellian logic that comprises language\x{2019}s Big Picture consists all & only of 3 things: simple logical connectives like \x{201c}and,\x{201d} \x{201c}or,\x{201d} & \x{201c}not\x{201d}; propositions or \x{201c}statements\x{201d}; & a view of these statements as \x{201c}atomic,\x{201d} meaning that the truth or falsity of a complex statement like \x{201c}Ludwig is affable and Bertrand is well-dressed\x{201d} depends entirely on the truth value of its constituent atomic propositions\x{2014}the prenominate molecular proposition is true if & only if it is true that Ludwig is friendly and it is true that Bertrand is dapper. The atomic propositions that are language\x{2019}s building blocks are, for both Russell and Wittgenstein, \x{201c}logically independent\x{201d} of one another: they do not affect one another\x{2019}s truth values, only the values of those logical molecules in which they\x{2019}re conjoined\x{2014}e.g., \x{201c}L is cheerful or B is well-heeled,\x{201d} \x{201c}It is not the case that if B is wealthy then L is cheerful,\x{201d} etc. Except here\x{2019}s the kicker: since language is & must be the world\x{2019}s mirror, the world is metaphysically composed only & entirely of those \x{201c}facts\x{201d} that statements stand for. In other words\x{2014}the words of the Tractatus\x{2019}s first & foremost line\x{2014}the world is everything that is the case; the world is nothing but a huge \x{201d} but a mass of data, of logically discrete facts that have no intrinsic connection to one another. C.f. the Tractatus 1.2: \x{201c}The world falls apart into facts\x{2026}\x{201d} <<1.21|5a:0>>: \x{201c}Any one [fact] can either be the case, or not be the case, and everything else remains the same.\x{201d}",

            "RIGHT NOW IT\x{2019}S <<1530H|1>>. on 3 September, the Sunday of Labor Day Weekend, the holiday that\x{2019}s come to represent the American summer\x{2019}s right bracket. But L.D.W. always falls in the middle of the U.S. Open; it\x{2019}s the time of the third and fourth rounds, the tournament\x{2019}s meat, the time of trench warfare and polysyllabic names. Right now, in the National Tennis Center\x{2019}s special Stadium\x{2014}a towering hexagon whose N, S, E, and W sides have exterior banners saying \x{201c}WELCOME TO THE 1995 U.S. OPEN\x{2014}A U.S.T.A. EVENT\x{201d}\x{2014}right now a whole inland sea of sunglasses and hats in the Stadium is rising to applaud as Pete Sampras and the Australian Mark Philippoussis are coming out on court, as scheduled, to labor. The two come out with their big bright athletic bags and their grim-looking Security escorts. The applause-acoustics are deafening. From down here near the court, looking up, the Stadium looks to be shaped like a huge wedding cake, and once past the gentler foothills of the box seats the aluminum stands seem to rise away on all sides almost vertically, so vertiginously steep that a misstep on any of the upper stairs looks like it would be certain and hideous death. The umpire sits in what looks like a lifeguard chair with little metal stirrups out front for his shoes, wearing a headset-mike and Ray-Bans and holding what\x{2019}s either a clipboard or or a laptop. The DecoTurf court is a rectangle of off-green marked out by the well-known configuration of very white lines inside a bigger rectangle of off-green; and as the players cross the whole thing E-W to their canvas chairs, photographers and cameramen converge and cluster on them like flies clustering on what flies like\x{2014}the players ignore them in the way that only people who are very used to cameras can ignore cameras. The crowd is still up and applauding, a pastel mass of 20,000+. A woman in a floppy straw hat three seats over from me is talking on a cellular phone; the man next to her is trying to applaud while holding a box of popcorn and is losing a lot of popcorn over the box\x{2019}s starboard side. The scoreboards up over the Stadium\x{2019}s N and S rims are flashing pointillist-neon ads for EVIAN. Sampras, poor-postured and chestless, smiling shyly at the ground, his powder-blue shorts swimming down around his knees, looks a little like a kid wearing his father\x{2019}s clothes. Philippoussis, who chronologically really is a kid, looks hulking and steroidic walking next to Sampras. Philippoussis is 6'4\" and 200+ and is crossing the court with the pigeon-toed gait of a large man who\x{2019}s trying not to lumber, wearing the red-and-white candy-stripe Fila shirt so many of the younger Australians favor. The PM sun is overhead to the W-SW in a sky with air so clear you can almost hear the sun combusting, and the tiny heads of the spectators way up at the top of the W bleachers are close enough to the sun\x{2019}s round bottom to look to be just about on fire. The players dump their long bags and begin to root through them. Their rackets are in plastic they have to unwrap. They sit in their little chairs hitting racket-faces together and cocking their heads to listen for pitch. The cameramen around them disperse at the umpire\x{2019}s command, some trailing snakes of cord. Ballboys take crumpled bits of racket plastic from under the players\x{2019} chairs.",

Sampras is hitting with the casual economy that all the really top pros seem to warm up with, the serene nonchalance of a creature at the very top of the food chain. The Wimbledon champion\x{2019}s presence aside, this third-rounder has particular romance about it because it features two Greeks neither of whom are in fact from Greece, a kind of postmodern Peloponnesian War. Philippoussis, just eighteen, Patrick Rafter\x{2019}s doubles partner, ranked in the top 100 in this his first year on tour, potential superstar and actual heartthrob, resembles Sampras, somewhat\x{2014}same one-handed backhand and slight loop on the forehand\x{2019}s backswing, same caf\x{e9}-au-lait coloring and Groucho eyebrows and very black hair that get glossy with sweat\x{2014}but the Australian is slower afoot, and in contrast to Sampras\x{2019}s weird boneless grace he looks almost awkward, perilously large, his shoulders square the way heavy guys with bad backs\x{2019} shoulders are square. Plus he seems to have aggression-issues that need resolving: he\x{2019}s hitting the ball as hard as he can even in warm-up. He seems brutish, Philippoussis does, Spartan, a big slow mechanical power-baseliner with chilly malice in his eyes; and against him, Sampras, who is not exactly a moonballer, seems almost frail, cerebral, a poet, both wise and sad, tired the way only democracies get tired, his expression freighted with the same odd post-Wimbledon melancholy that\x{2019}s dogged him all summer through Montreal, Cincinnati, etc. Thomas Enqvist\x{2019}s epic 2-6 6-2 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-5) first-rounder against Marcelo Rios and Agassi\x{2019}s second-round squeaker against Corretja notwithstanding, it\x{2019}s tempting to see this upcoming match as the climax of the Open so far: two ethnically agnate and archetypally distinct foes, an opposition not just of styles of play but of fundamental orientations toward life, imagination, the uses of power\x{2026} plus of course economic interests.",

            "Besides the Stadium/Grandstand, there are three other N.T.C. \x{201c}Show Courts,\x{201d} i.e., courts with serious bleachers. At <<1640h|1>>., Court 16 is running men\x{2019}s doubles with Eltingh-Haarhuis, the world\x{2019}s #1 team, and its little wedge of aluminum stands isn\x{2019}t even full. American tennis crowds seem decisively singles-oriented. Court 17 has Korda and Kulti against the Mad Bahamian Mark Knowles and his 1995 partner Daniel Nestor, the Canadian who\x{2019}s fun to watch because he looks so much like an anorectic Mick Jagger. Court 18 has women\x{2019}s doubles with four players whose names I don\x{2019}t recognize and exactly thirty-one people in the stands. (All four of the females on 18 have bigger forearms than I do.) Natasha Zvereva, looking incomplete without Gigi, is warming up against Amy Frazier in the Grandstand. In the Stadium, Philippoussis and Sampras have split the first two sets, 6 and 5. What a big match sounds like outside the Stadium is brief strut-rattling explosions of applause and whistles and then the odd flat amplification of the umpire speaking into the abrupt silence his speaking has created. Daniel Nestor\x{2019}s last name, while also Hellenistic, is Homerian, thus allusive to a wartime way before Athens v. Sparta. The fact that Sampras has won so many Grand Slam titles may have a lot to do with the fact that Slams\x{2019} males\x{2019} matches are the best of five sets. Best-of-fives require not just physical endurance but a special kind of emotional flexibility: in best-of-fives you can\x{2019}t play with full-bore intensity the whole time; you have to know when to kind of turn it on and when to lay back and conserve your psychic resources. Philippoussis won the tie-break of a first set in which you got the impression that Sampras was sort of adjusting the idle on his game, trying to find the exact level he needed to reach to win. The suspense of the match isn\x{2019}t so much whether Sampras will win but how hard he\x{2019}ll have to play and how long it\x{2019}ll take him to find this out. Philippoussis hits very hard but has no imagination and even less flexibility. He\x{2019}s like a machine with just one gear: unless forced out of his rhythm by a wide-angle shot, he moves exclusively in forward-backward vectors. Sampras, on the other hand, seems to float like dander all over the court. Philippoussis is like a great and terrible land army; Sampras is more naval, more of the drift-and-encircle school. Philippoussis is oligarchic: he has a will and seeks to impose it. Sampras is more democratic, i.e., more chaotic but also more human: his real job seems to be figuring out what his will exactly is. Not a lot of people remember that Athens actually lost the Peloponnesian War\x{2014}it took thirty years, but Sparta finally ground them down. Nor do most people know that Athens actually started the whole bloody thing in the first place by picking on maritime allies of Sparta who were cutting into Athens\x{2019}s sea trade. Athens\x{2019}s clean-cut nice-guy image is a bit overdone\x{2014}the whole exhausting affair was about commerce right from the beginning.",

Since the 1995 U.S. Open is primarily\x{2014}unabashedly\x{2014}about commerce, and since commerce is by its nature uncontainable, it shouldn\x{2019}t be at all surprising that the most vigorous crepuscular commerce is taking place out here, outside the tournament\x{2019}s fence and Gate, in markets of all shade and hue. I have, e.g., in the last twenty minutes received three separate solicitations to buy pot (all wildly overpriced). The sweet burnt-pine smell of reefer is in the air all over out here, and one young guy in oversized fatigue pants is smoking a bone on a bench right next to a very neat and dapper old gentleman who\x{2019}s sitting with his hands folded primly and not giving any indication he smells anything untoward. Scalpers have upped the pressure of their pitches in the lengthening shadows and are practically applying half-nelsons to anybody on the promenade who seems even possibly to be looking for something, even if that something is just a quiet isolated place to eat a kraut-dog. As mentioned supra, I\x{2019}m the proud possessor of a U.S. Open \x{2019}95 Media Pass\x{2014}which consists of a necklace of nylon cord from which hangs a large plastic card w/a direly unflattering little photo of me that hangs against my chest at about the level of a sommelier\x{2019}s tasting cup\x{2014}and twice this evening outside the Main Gate I\x{2019}ve been approached by somebody wanting to borrow the Media Pass and then slip it back to me through the black fence once they\x{2019}ve strolled inside. One offer was a straight-out bribe, but the other involved a distinguished and corporate-looking gray-haired guy in green golfer\x{2019}s slacks who had a complex tale of woe about a tubercular niece or something who\x{2019}d paid a surprise long-distance visit to NYC and whose fondest wish was to get into the U.S. Open and that tickets were sold out, etc. I observed at least one turnstile\x{2019}s ticket-taker (not the flinty-eyed Throgs Neck ticket-taker) receive some sort of subtle ma\x{ee}tre-d\x{2019}ish payment for allowing somebody to bring in something spectators were by no stretch of the imagination allowed to bring into the N.T.C. If you don\x{2019}t have a Stadium ticket but have the NYC savvy and financial resources, certain Stadium ushers are said (by two separate reliable sources) to be willing to place you in a vacant seat\x{2014}sometimes a really up-close and desirable seat\x{2014}for a sub-rosa fee, and a percentage of this fee is then apparently kicked back to a certain enterprising person or persons in the National Tennis Center who know of seats that for one reason or another aren\x{2019}t going to be occupied during a certain interval and relay this information to ushers (for a price). Part of the beauty of the tennis here is the way the artistry and energy are bounded by specific lines on court, but the beauty of the commerce is the way it\x{2019}s un- and never bounded. It\x{2019}s all sort of hypnotic at night. The plunging Infiniti\x{2019}s leather interior gets somehow mysteriously illuminated when the sun goes down, so that from a distance the car seems like a beacon. Trash-can fires appear in F.M.C. Park\x{2019}s distance, and the #7 train\x{2019}s interior\x{2019}s also alit as it pulls into the overground Shea stop to the north. At <<about 2015h|1>>. there\x{2019}s a fracas near the I.F. Village involving some unscrupulous/enterprising employee of whatever company actually makes the \x{201c} \x{2019}95 Open\x{201d}\x{2013}emblazoned T-shirts and hats and c. for the souvenir booths, who\x{2019}s apparently diverted boxes and boxes of the shirts and stuff and is going around the grounds selling them on the sly at prices way below the booths\x{2019} prices, and N.T.C. Security\x{2019}s involved, as well as\x{2014}incongruously\x{2014}what look like two Fire Department guys in slickers and fireman hats. It\x{2019}s on the whole kind of a younger and rowdier and more potentially sinister crowd that\x{2019}s coming in for the evening session. Their faces are stonier; eye contact seems hazardous the way eye contact on subways can be hazardous. The women tend to be dressed in ways that let you know just what they\x{2019}d look like without any clothes on.",

In one of the big communitarian fountainless circles that the promenade opens into as it leads to the Main Gate\x{2014}the circle closest to the Gate, this one is\x{2014}one of the circle\x{2019}s green benches is controlled by gypsy-cab and -limo drivers waiting for anybody exiting who needs a gypsy-type ride back to Rye or Rockaway or wherever. Half a dozen of these guys sit on this bench in their cabbies\x{2019} berets, waiting around, smoking cigars, talking shit, etc. I\x{2019}m on the next bench trying to organize my notes. This is at <<about 2100h|1>>., late. From this circle you can see the rear flaps of some of the tented high-volume kitchens. Through one of these flaps now emerges a stocky young guy in the unmistakable tall hat and whites of a kitchen worker (though on his feet are \$200 Air Jordans so new they glow in the N.T.C.\x{2019}s ambient light, so he looks like he\x{2019}s floating). The kitchen worker\x{2019}s carrying a broad low cardboard box through the employee- and Media Pass-entrance in the Gate and down the promenade and across the circle, making for the bench with the cabbies. The cabbies are making gestures like: Finally, Thank God. One of the cabbies rises and moves out and meets the kitchen worker; something subtle occurs between their hands that indicates a transfer of funds; and now the cabbie bears the box back to the bench, where the rest of the drivers circle and grab and reveal that the box is full of supper\x{2014}burgers, chicken legs, wieners, etc. Vague contented noises from the cabbies on the bench as they dig in.",

The elaborate set-up and frames notwithstanding, it is Petros Papachristos\x{2019}s obsessive and tormented career that drives the novel and comprises its heart.",

            "17 In the \x{2019}06 final\x{2019}s third set, at <<three|9:0>> games all and 30-15, Nadal kicks his second serve high to Federer\x{2019}s backhand. Nadal\x{2019}s clearly been coached to go high and heavy to Federer\x{2019}s backhand, and that\x{2019}s what he does, point after point. Federer slices the return back to Nadal\x{2019}s center and two feet short\x{2014}not short enough to let the Spaniard hit a winner, but short enough to draw him slightly into the court, whence Nadal winds up and puts all his forehand\x{2019}s strength into a hard heavy shot to (again) Federer\x{2019}s backhand. The pace he\x{2019}s put on the ball means that Nadal is still backpedaling to his baseline as Federer leaves his feet and cranks a very hard topspin backhand down the line to Nadal\x{2019}s deuce side, which Nadal\x{2014}out of position but world-class fast\x{2014}reaches and manages to one-hand back deep to (again) Federer\x{2019}s backhand side, but this ball\x{2019}s floaty and slow, and Federer has time to step around and hit an inside-out forehand, a forehand as hard as anyone\x{2019}s hit all tournament, with just enough topspin to bring it down in Nadal\x{2019}s ad corner, and the Spaniard gets there but can\x{2019}t return it. Big ovation. Again, what looks like an overwhelming baseline winner was actually set up by that first clever semi-short slice and Nadal\x{2019}s own predictability about where and how hard he\x{2019}ll hit every ball. Federer surely whaled that last forehand, though. People are looking at each other and applauding. The thing with Federer is that he\x{2019}s Mozart and Metallica at the same time, and the harmony\x{2019}s somehow exquisite.",
