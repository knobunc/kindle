            "However, this is no reactionary celebration of aristocratic derring-do. Rumata is really Anton, an emissary from a future Earth where Communism has triumphed, creating a rational, benevolent society that can only look on the filth and cruelty of this backward world with disgust. Rumata/ Anton is an operative working on behalf of Earth historians, studying the feudal mores of the planet with a view to assisting them to \x{201c}progress\x{201d} along the straight and narrow path of history. Unlike their Yankee contemporaries (who always seem to be planting moonbases and generally making themselves at home on alien planets), the enlightened peoples of the <<Noon|13>> Universe don\x{2019}t intervene as imperialists. Anton isn\x{2019}t the probe-head of some future project of settlement or colonization. Instead he\x{2019}s a kind of human webcam, feeding video back to his home planet, even as he\x{2019}s embroiled in Arkanar\x{2019}s vicious court politics. Like his fellow operatives, he rails against the strict injunction not to intervene overtly in the planet\x{2019}s affairs. Faced with the brutality and excesses of the worthless, decadent aristocracy, he is sorely tempted to right some wrongs\x{2014}and break some skulls. He is a god who must hide his divinity.",

            "It\x{2019}s a common observation that all science fiction novels say as much about the time of their composition as they do about the future. As they wrote Hard to Be a God, the Strugatsky brothers were working under considerable political pressure. Following Khrushchev\x{2019}s infamous visit to an exhibition of abstract art in 1962 (\x{201c}dog shit\x{201d} was one of his more printable responses) a wave of panicked ideological house-cleaning swept through the Soviet Union\x{2019}s artistic establishment. For SF writers, as Boris Strugatsky remembers, this resulted in a reminder that the only truly orthodox subject was \x{201c}the collision of two worlds.\x{201d} At the time the brothers still harbored hopes that Communism could produce the kind of enlightened civilization that forms the backdrop of their <<Noon|13>> novels. But perhaps inevitably, their initial plans for a Dumas-influenced swashbuckling tale about an earth-man\x{2019}s adventures in a feudal world became a much darker story about the fate of the intelligentsia under totalitarianism. The spymaster villain Don Reba was originally called Rebia, a none-too-subtle anagram of Beria, the infamous head of Stalin\x{2019}s secret police, the NKVD. Reba\x{2019}s systematic destruction of the values of science and intellectual inquiry are thus both a reminder of the purges of the 1930s and a coded plea to Khrushchev not to follow in his predecessor\x{2019}s footsteps. The resulting novel, part Boy\x{2019}s Own adventure and part dystopian political satire, is a sort of metafantasy, neither Dumas nor Tolkien but a wry commentary on the medievalism of the genre. In Russia, it has been wildly popular for almost half a century. It\x{2019}s sure to find new fans in English.",

They climbed up the cliff. When he got to the top, Pashka turned around. He saw the blue lake with the yellowish bald patches of the sandbars, the boat lying on the sand, and large ripples spreading in the calm, oily water by the shore\x{2014}probably a splash from that same pike. And Pashka was filled with the vague elation he always felt when he and Anton had run away from boarding school and a day of total independence lay ahead\x{2014}full of undiscovered places, wild strawberries, hot deserted meadows, gray lizards, and ice-cold water from unexpected springs. And as always, he wanted to whoop and leap up high in the air, and he immediately did so, and Anton looked at him, laughing, and Pashka saw that Anton\x{2019}s eyes expressed complete understanding.

Clusters of storm troopers with torches in their hands were standing around at the intersections, clanking their weapons. They were quiet, as if waiting for something. A number of them approached Rumata, took a good look at him, and after recognizing him, just as silently let him pass.

Rumata stopped, clanked his scabbards against each other, and the characters fell back, but he immediately heard the sound of a crossbow being loaded in the dark.
