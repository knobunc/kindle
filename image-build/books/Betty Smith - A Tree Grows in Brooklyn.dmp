They had told her how she might possibly win fifty strips and have a grand day on the excursion. Francie was a poor marble player and quickly lost her tickets. Neeley, on the other hand, had three strips. He had been lucky. Francie asked Mama could she have one of Neeley\x{2019}s tickets. Mama seized the opportunity to give her a lecture on gambling.",

It was queer to see Papa\x{2019}s hands so quiet when she remembered them as always trembling. Francie noticed how narrow and sensitive-looking they were with the long and tapering fingers. She stared steadily at his hands and thought she saw them move. Panic churned up in her and she wanted to run away. But the room was full of people watching her. They would say she was running away because\x{2026}He had been a good father. He had! He had! She put her hand on his hair and put the lock back in place.
