hand in his portfolio and resign office, and you will lose the finest butler in

that he inflamed the man and so was directly responsible for what happened, and
one can see the County looking very askance at him, pursing their lips, raising
their eyebrows, possibly even cutting him at the next Agricultural Show.

yours of giving Bill Bailey the old heave-ho. I will leave the castle on the
