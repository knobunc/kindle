A voice from the next bed: \x{201c}Here it is, my dear, and just be more careful in future, please.\x{201d} <<Half an hour after midnight|10>>. I\x{2019}ve slept about four hours. Of course I\x{2019}m still on English time so it would be now <<about seven in the evening|9h>>. I\x{2019}m wide awake and sit up in bed. I\x{2019}m in the women\x{2019}s dormitory of the S.M. (Society of Missionaries) hostel. There are seven string beds, four one side three the other. They\x{2019}re all occupied and everyone appears to be asleep. But outside the city is still awake and restless. There is even music somewhere. The street lamps light up the curtainless windows of the dormitory from outside, filling the room with a ghostly reflection in which the sleepers on their beds look like washed-up bodies.",

Something had happened again though he did not say what. Olivia sat waiting on the verandah. She had been waiting all day \x{2013} not for Douglas but for a message from the Palace. None came. She did not know what had happened: they were supposed to have left for Mussourie, but she could not believe that they would do so without seeing or communicating with her in some way first. She made up her mind that, if they had left, she would go too. She would tell Douglas that she could not stand the heat and must leave for the mountains immediately. Sitting there, alone and waiting in vain, she realised that it would not be possible for her to stay.",
