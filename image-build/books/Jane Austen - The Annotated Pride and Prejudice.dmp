PAGE


Dec. <<17-19|5a:0>>
Miss Bingley's second letter to Jane The most likely dates, based on the letter being mentioned after Mr. Collins's arrival on the 16th, Jane being described as waiting a day or two to tellElizabeth (p. 248), and Mr. Collins's departure being mentioned after that.

270, 272


Wed., Jan. 8
Charlotte says goodbye to Elizabeth The day is identified in the text; the date is not certain, but is probable. Mr. Collins is described as arriving at the Lucases \x{201c}soon after\x{201d} the Gardiners and Jane left, with the marriage \x{201c}fast approaching.\x{201d} An interval of nine days from the Gardiners' departure, rather than one of either two or sixteen days, seems logical.
268


Thurs., Jan. 9
Marriage of Mr. Collins and Charlotte
270


Early Feb.
Miss Bingley returns visit to Jane Described as an interval of four weeks.

308


Early to Mid-April
Darcy and Col. Fitzwilliam arrive at Rosings This happens two weeks, and possibly a few days, after Elizabeth's arrival in the area. It may occur on a Monday, since on Sunday Darcy is said to have been there \x{201c}almost a week\x{201d} (p. 316).
310

326


Mid to LateApril
Darcy frequently sees Elizabeth This is over a ten day period: he has been in the area for approximately a week when he starts seeing her (on a Monday); he proposes on Thursday and leaves two days later; since his visit lasts \x{201c}nearly three weeks\x{201d} (p. 430), this interval would be a week and a half long.
332, 336


Late April
Elizabeth walks with Col. Fitzwilliam
336


(Thursday)
Darcy proposes in the evening Col. Fitzwilliam says he and Darcy plan to leave on Saturday. Since they leave two days later, and nothing indicates they have changed their plans, this day should be Thursday.

Kitty begins to recover her spirits
440


Mid to Late June
Elizabeth learns her trip must be delayed This is four weeks before it does begin.
440


Mid to Late July
Elizabeth and the Gardiners leave on their trip The most likely date is around July 20. The trip is supposed to last three weeks. On Aug. 5-7 (see below) Elizabeth and the Gardiners are forced to leave for home. Until then, while clearly near the end of their trip, they seemed not to be planning to leave immediately. That, plus the two full days that travel back home at a normal pace would take, suggests the trip was supposed to end around August 10, and this provides the basis for the most likely departure date.
442


Late July
Elizabeth and the Gardiners on tour
442


Early Aug.
They arrive within five miles of Lambton See below for reasons for date.

702


The issue of Pride and Prejudice's chronology has sparked differing interpretations, for the dates provided in the novel are not all compatible. The novel mentions three specific dates along with their days: Monday, Nov. 18, Tuesday, Nov. 26, and Monday, Aug. 2 (of the following year). The first two days are compatible; furthermore, since 1811 would have contained both days, and Jane Austen composed the final version of the novel in 1811 and 1812, many have supposed that she followed the calendars for those years when preparing the manuscript. Unfortunately, 1812 did not contain a Monday, August 2, nor would any year that succeeded a year containing a Monday, November 18 and Tuesday, November 26. This has left anyone wishing to date the novel with a dilemma.",

As they drove to Mr. Gardiner\'s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin\'s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.',

Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before <<three|9c:1>> and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a lady, \x{2014}only think what fun! Nota soul knew of it, but Col. and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster.1 thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\x{201d}",

Afternoon had traditionally been applied to the period from dinner (which had long been at <<mid-day|13>>) until evening. During the eighteenth century dinner, especially for the wealthy, gradually shifted to a later hour; as it did, the commencement of afternoon was steadily pushed back, while morning came to cover more and more of the day. It was not until later decades, after further adjustments of meal times, that afternoon reverted to its original meaning of <<mid-day|13>> until evening.",

An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham!\x{2014}Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides!\x{2014}But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at <<eight|9c:1>>. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but 1 hardly know what 1 have written.",

The distance, on roads existing then, would be approximately 140 to 150 miles, and they traveled from sometime in the middle of the previous day to around four or <<five o'clock|6>> on this day. Thus, assuming their stop for the night was relatively short, they would have averaged 7-8 miles per hour, which was close to the best speed of the time. Jane Austen always takes great pains to ensure that details of this sort are correct. In a letter commenting on a niece's novel, she declares that certain characters \x{201c}must be two days going from Dawlish to Bath; they are nearly 100 miles apart\x{201d} (Aug. 17, 1814).",

Some people did denounce duels. Jane Austen's favorite novel, Samuel Richardson's Sir Charles Grandison, gives prominent place to its hero's renunciation of dueling; but the same novel indicates an awareness of the unusual and unpopular nature of such a renunciation. Moreover, while dueling was against the law\x{2014}in fact, in a well-publicized case from <<1808|9c:0>>, just before this novel appeared, a major in the British army was executed for killing another officer in a duel\x{2014}the authorities usually turned a blind eye to the practice. In 1809, two of the leading political figures in Britain, the Secretaries of War and of Foreign Affairs, fought a duel over intense differences about war policy. Dueling's general social acceptability is also indicated by the existence of books at the time that detailed the elaborate rules supposed to govern duels. One principle of the rules was that insults or injuries to ladies could be considered an especially grave offense, which would make the duel at issue here more acceptable than most.",
