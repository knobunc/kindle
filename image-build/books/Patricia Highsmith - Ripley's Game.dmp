In Jonathan\x{2019}s opinion, Simone was supercharged with sex appeal, though of the kind that might not be apparent to the average man, and it annoyed Jonathan especially that the cruising swine Brezard must have become aware of Simone\x{2019}s very different kind of attractiveness, and that he wanted some of it for himself. Not that Simone talked much about Brezard. Only once had she mentioned that he tried it on with his women employees who were two besides Simone. For an instant that morning, as Jonathan presented a framed watercolour to a client, he imagined Simone, after a discreet interval, succumbing to the odious Brezard, who after all was a bachelor and financially better off than Jonathan.

He\x{2019}d begun to feel strangely weak and had romantically thought that it might be due to falling in love. But a little extra rest hadn\x{2019}t shaken the weakness, he had fainted once in a street of Nemours, so he had gone to a doctor \x{2013} Dr Perrier in Fontainebleau, who had suspected a blood condition and sent him to a Dr Moussu in Paris. The specialist Moussu, after two days of tests, had confirmed myeloid leukemia, and said that he might have from <<six to eight|10a:0>>, with luck twelve years to live. There would be an enlargement of the spleen, which in fact Jonathan already had without having noticed it. Thus Jonathan\x{2019}s proposal to Simone had been a declaration of love and death in the same awkward speech. It would have been enough to put most young women off, or to have made them say they needed time to think about it. Simone had said yes, she loved him too. \x{2018}It is the love that is important, not the time,\x{2019} Simone had said. None of the calculations that Jonathan had associated with the French, and with Latins in general. Simone said she had already spoken to her family. And this after they had known each other only two weeks. Jonathan felt himself suddenly in a world more secure than any he had ever known. Love, in a real and not a merely romantic sense, love that he had no control over, had miraculously rescued him. In a way, he felt that it had rescued him from death, but he realized that he meant that love had taken the terror out of death. And here was death six years later, as Dr Moussu in Paris had predicted. Perhaps. Jonathan didn\x{2019}t know what to believe.",

            "Jonathan got to his shop at <<9.15 a.m.|2a>>, drew the green shade of his door, and locked the door again, leaving the ferme sign in it. He pottered about, thinking still about Hamburg. The opinion of a German specialist might be a good thing. Two years ago Jonathan had consulted a specialist in London. His report had been the same as the French, which had satisfied Jonathan that the diagnoses were true. Mightn\x{2019}t the Germans be a little more thorough or up to date? Suppose he accepted Wister\x{2019}s offer of a round trip? (Jonathan was copying an address on to a postcard.) But then he\x{2019}d be beholden to Wister. Jonathan realized he was toying with the idea of killing someone for Wister \x{2013} not for Wister, but for the money. A Mafia member. They were all criminals themselves, weren\x{2019}t they? Of course, Jonathan reminded himself, he could always pay Wister back, if he accepted his round-trip fare. The point was, Jonathan couldn\x{2019}t pull the money out of the bank funds just now, there wasn\x{2019}t enough. If he really wanted to make sure of his condition, Germany (or Switzerland for that matter) could tell him. They still had the best doctors in the world, hadn\x{2019}t they? Jonathan was now putting the card of the paper supplier of Melun beside his telephone to remind him to ring tomorrow, because the paper place wasn\x{2019}t open today either. And who knew, mightn\x{2019}t Stephen Wister\x{2019}s proposal be feasible? For an instant, Jonathan saw himself blown to bits by the crossfire of German police officers: they\x{2019}d caught him just after he fired on the Italian. But even if he were dead, Simone and Georges would get the forty thousand quid. Jonathan came back to reality. He wasn\x{2019}t going to kill anybody, no. But Hamburg, going to Hamburg seemed a lark, a break, even if he learned some awful news there. He\x{2019}d learn facts, anyway. And if Wister paid now, Jonathan could pay him back in a matter of three months, if he scrimped, didn\x{2019}t buy any clothes, not even a beer in a caf\x{e9}. Jonathan rather dreaded telling Simone, though she\x{2019}d agree, of course, since it had to do with seeing another doctor, presumably an excellent doctor. The scrimping would come out of Jonathan\x{2019}s own pocket.",

I bought bread and went to the butcher\x{2019}s today \x{2013} on foot, taking my time \x{2013} just to see. And <<around seven-thirty p.m.|5>> Howard Glegg arrived, one of my neighbours, bringing me a big plastic sack of horse manure from one of his farmer friends where he buys a rabbit now and then.\x{2019} Tom puffed on his cigar and relaxed with a laugh. \x{2018}It was Howard who stopped his car outside Saturday night, remember? He thought we had guests, Heloise and I, and that it mightn\x{2019}t be die time to deliver horse manure.\x{2019} Tom rambled on, trying to fill in the time, while Jonathan, he hoped, lost a little of his tension. \x{2018}I told him Heloise was away for a few days, and I said I\x{2019}d been entertaining some friends from Paris, hence the Paris car outside. I think that went down very well.\x{2019}
The clock on the mantel struck <<nine|11>>, with pure little pings.
\x{2018}However, back to Reeves,\x{2019} Tom said. \x{2018}I thought of writing him, saying I had some grounds for thinking the situation had improved, but two things stopped me. Reeves might leave Ascona at any hour now, and second, things haven\x{2019}t improved for him, if the wogs still want to get him. He\x{2019}s using the name Ralph Piatt now, but they know his real name and what he looks like. There\x{2019}s nothing for Reeves but Brazil, if the Mafia still wants to get him. And even Brazil \x{2014}\x{2019} Tom smiled, but not happily now.",
