Because, of course, we are all on the lookout nowadays for Fifth Columnists, aren\x{2019}t we? A sharp lookout, that is what they say, and I always try to do so, and so, as I say, I noticed this woman. A nurse, I thought, or a maid\x{2014}a lot of spies came over here in that capacity, and this woman was most unusual looking and walking up the road and on to the downs\x{2014}with a little girl\x{2014}and the little girl seemed tired and rather lagging, and <<half-past seven|10>>, well, most children go to bed then, so I looked at the woman pretty sharply. I think it flustered her. She hurried up the road, pulling the child after her, and finally picked her up and went on up the path out on to the cliff, which I thought strange, you know, because there are no houses there at all\x{2014}nothing\x{2014}not until you get to Whitehaven\x{2014}about five miles over the downs\x{2014}a favourite walk for hikers.
