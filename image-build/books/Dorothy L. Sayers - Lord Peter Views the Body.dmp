            "\x{2018}Supposing I wanted, for some reason, to scare the neighbourhood with the apparition of a coach and headless horses, I should choose a dark, rainy night. Good! It was that kind of night. Now, if I took black horses and painted their bodies white \x{2013} poor devils! what a state they\x{2019}d be in. No. How do they do these Maskelyne-and-Devant stunts where they cut off people\x{2019}s heads? White horses, of course \x{2013} and black felt clothing over their heads. Right! And luminous paint on the harness, with a touch here and there on their bodies, to make good contrast and ensure that the whole show wasn\x{2019}t invisible. No difficulty about that. But they must go silently. Well, why not? Four stout black cloth bags filled with bran, drawn well up and tied round the fetlocks would make any horse go quietly enough, especially if there was a bit of a wind going. Rags round the bridle-rings to prevent clinking, and round the ends of the traces to keep \x{2019}em from squeaking. Give \x{2019}em a coachman in a white coat and black mask, hitch \x{2019}em to a rubber-tyred fly, picked out with phosphorus and well-oiled at the joints \x{2013} and I swear I\x{2019}d make something quite ghostly enough to startle a rather well-irrigated gentleman on a lonely road at <<half-past two in the morning|10>>.\x{2019}",

They waited till Mrs and Miss Hancock had taken their places, and then made a row to attract their attention. When the ladies courageously advanced to find out what was up, they popped out and bundled \x{2019}em into the vestry.\x{2019}",

            "\x{2018}That was when the death-coach affair was timed to drive up to the south door. It came round the Back Lane, I fancy, though I can\x{2019}t be sure. Then Mortimer and the other two took the embalmed body out of the coffin and filled its place up with bags of sawdust. I know it was sawdust, because I found the remains of it on the Lady-chapel floor in the morning. They put the body in the fly, and Mortimer drove off with it. They passed me on the Herriotting road at <<half-past two|10>>, so they can\x{2019}t have wasted much time over the job. Mortimer may have been alone, or possibly he had someone with him to see to the body while he himself did the headless coachman business in a black mask. I\x{2019}m not certain about that. They drove through the last gate before you come to the fork at Frimpton, and went across the fields to Mortimer\x{2019}s barn. They left the fly there \x{2013} I know that, because I saw it, and I saw the bran they used to muffle the horses\x{2019} hoofs, too. I expect they took it on from there in a car, and fetched the horses up next day \x{2013} but that\x{2019}s a detail. I don\x{2019}t know, either, where they took the body to, but I expect, if you went and asked Mortimer about it, he would be able to assure you that it was still above ground.\x{2019}",
