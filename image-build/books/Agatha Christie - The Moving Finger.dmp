The old-fashioned Victorian monster, devouring her young. Yes, that\x{2019}s what it amounted to. She was monumental, you know, must have weighed seventeen stone, and all the five daughters revolved round her. \x{2018}The girls\x{2019}! That\x{2019}s how she always spoke of them. The girls! And the eldest was well over sixty then. \x{2018}Those stupid girls!\x{2019} she used to call them sometimes. Black slaves, that\x{2019}s all they were, fetching and carrying and agreeing with her. <<Ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> they had to go to bed and they weren\x{2019}t allowed a fire in their bedroom, and as for asking their own friends to the house, that would have been unheard of. She despised them, you know, for not getting married, and yet so arranged their lives that it was practically impossible for them to meet anybody. I believe Emily, or perhaps it was Agnes, did have some kind of affair with a curate. But his family wasn\x{2019}t good enough and Mamma soon put a stop to that!\x{201d}",
