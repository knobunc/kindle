<<MIDNIGHT|13>> DEMON.
\x{201c}Thank you for coming, Mr. Snicket,\x{201d} said the old woman who answered the door. I need hardly describe her. I had been summoned, in a handwritten note on frilly stationery, to come to a rocking chair store, the only one in Stain\x{2019}d-by-the-Sea. The place was called Cozy\x{2019}s, and in the window were three cozy rocking chairs gathered together in a cozy circle along with a cozy, furry dog asleep in a cozy basket, and the old woman who ran the place looked exactly like the sort of old woman who would ask you in a handwritten note on frilly stationery to come to her rocking chair store called Cozy\x{2019}s because she had something on her mind that worried her very much. If you\x{2019}re still having trouble picturing her, it might help to know that her name was Thomasina Cozy.",

But that\x{2019}s not the point, Mr. Snicket. I tell you my daughter sleeps soundly. I know the Baron would never marry a sleepless woman, so I check each night before I go to sleep at <<nine fifteen|5b>>, to make sure she is safe in bed. Yet somehow the Baron sees her roaming the pier at <<midnight|13>>. Something is taking the form of my daughter, to cancel the wedding and ruin my life. A demon is the only reasonable explanation.\x{201d}",
