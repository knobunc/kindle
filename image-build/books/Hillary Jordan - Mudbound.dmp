Off base, in the towns where we took our liberty, we walked real careful. In Killeen they put up a big sign for us at the end of Main Street: NIGGERS HAVE TO LEAVE THIS TOWN BY <<9 PM|5>>. The paint was blood red in case we missed the point. Killeen didn\x{2019}t have a colored section, only about half of them little towns did. The one in Alexandria near Camp Claiborne was typical\x{2014}nothing to it but a falling-down movie theater and two shabby juke joints. Wasn\x{2019}t no place to buy anything or set and eat a meal. The rest of the town was off limits to us. If the MPs or the local law caught you in the white part of town they\x{2019}d beat the shit out of you.",

Henry and Orris both looked like they wanted to object, but neither of them did.

Wretched as I was, I couldn\x{2019}t bring myself to begrudge her happiness. We\x{2019}d been chatting for a few minutes when a Negro soldier came in the back door.
