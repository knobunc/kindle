By the 500s CE, paper in China had become so routine that people were wiping their bums with it (thanks, toilet paper), but it would still take more than half a millennium before Europeans would learn of its invention, let alone rub it on their dirty, dirty poo bums. It wasn\x{2019}t <<until 1857|18:0>> CE that toilet paper was first produced commercially in the United States (before, any old paper could be used, and tearing pages from books was not uncommon), and it was only in 1890 CE that toilet paper was sold in rolls instead of in stacks. To make going to the bathroom more comfortable for members of your civilization\x{2014}and to prevent them from resorting to cleaning themselves with wool, rags, leaves, seaweed, animal furs, grass, moss, snow, sand, seashells, corncobs, their own hands, or a communal sponge on a stick*\x{2014}you\x{2019}ll want to consider inventing toilet paper ahead of schedule.",

To avoid these problems, you may want to skip ahead a few tens of thousands of years to woodblock printing, first invented in China <<around 200|18:0>> CE.

You know how many spikes are on your wheel (since you can count them), and you know that each full rotation of your wheel induces precisely that many vibrations in your card. That means if you have a wheel with forty-four equally spaced spikes, rotating that wheel once per second gets a 44Hz noise, and rotating it ten times per second gets you 440Hz. To get your wheel spinning at a controlled ten revolutions per second, try attaching your smaller spiked wheel to a larger wheel via a drive belt (see Section 10.8.4).

Humans are one of the few animals that can\x{2019}t produce vitamin C on our own, but we\x{2019}re very good at taking it from the foods we eat and storing it in our bodies, and can rely on those stores for about four weeks before scurvy symptoms start to develop. The catch is that vitamin C is easily destroyed by heat (i.e., cooking) and exposure to air, so processed or stored foods won\x{2019}t have any. In the 1400s CE the fact that citrus prevented scurvy was known to Italian sailors, and some Portuguese sailors went so far as to plant orange trees on convenient islands along their way, but this knowledge was later lost. Rediscoveries were then ignored, as they went against the prevailing knowledge that scurvy was a disease \x{201c}caused by internal putrefaction brought on through faulty digestion.\x{201d} Lemons as a cure did briefly take hold in the British fleet <<around 1800|18:0>> CE but was lost in 1867 CE when the fleet switched from lemons to the juice of Key limes. That juice has less vitamin C, and when it was exposed to air, light, and the copper pipes on ships, it was reduced to practically none. However, as faster steam engines had come into use over the foregoing half century, the time most sailors were at sea was reduced, which when combined with better nutrition on land led to fewer instances of scurvy and obscured the (non)effect the new lime juice was having. When sailors on longer expeditions again began developing scurvy, and with the old citrus cure apparently ineffectual, new theories took hold: perhaps scurvy was caused by food poisoning in poorly tinned meat, or even by poor hygiene and morale. It was only when experiments were done on guinea pigs in 1907 CE\x{2014}a lucky choice of animal, since it\x{2019}s one of the few nonhuman animals that can even get scurvy\x{2014}that Europeans (again) discovered that fresh foods and citrus were a cure, and this time, it stuck.
