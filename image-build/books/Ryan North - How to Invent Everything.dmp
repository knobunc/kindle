            "* If you can use coppicing rather than clear-cutting to maintain wood a supply that meets demand (see Section <<7.27|5a:0>>), you can also avoid human-induced climate change, simply by avoiding the need for fossil fuels. While it\x{2019}s true that both coal and charcoal are carbon-based and release carbon dioxide when burned, coal releases carbon into the air that had been stored in the ground for millions of years\x{2014}thereby altering the composition of the modern atmosphere\x{2014}while charcoal and wood are only releasing carbon that\x{2019}s been stored for a few decades at most. While your civilization will reach a point when charcoal does not meet your energy needs, by then you may be able to leapfrog over fossil fuels to using fuels with fewer dangerous, ecology-destroying, icecap-melting, sea-level-raising, island-drowning, and largely irreversible climate-changing downsides\x{2014}such as biodiesel, vegetable oil, hydrogen, or temporal flux anti-causality inducer arrays.",

            "* Silk doesn\x{2019}t need to be combed, since it\x{2019}s already in thread form! If you\x{2019}re got spinning wheels, silkworms, and white mulberry trees (see Section <<7.26|5a:0>>), you\x{2019}ve got all you need to produce silk on an industrial scale. First, grow white mulberry trees, and harvest leaves from trees five years or older. Spread them on a bed of straw, and allow silkworm caterpillars to go to town on the leaves for the next thirty-five days. When the caterpillars have spun cocoons for themselves, harvest the cocoons, then dip them in boiling water to kill the silkworm. The cocoons can now be unraveled: each is made from a single piece of silk thread up to 1,300m long. These threads can now be spun together on your spinning wheel. It takes <<about 630|18:0>> cocoons to produce enough silk for a single blouse, so this will never be a cheap way to not be naked, but it is a nice one! Before the secret of silk production leaks from China around 200 BCE, the information contained in this footnote alone is worth billions of dollars.",

            "* If you\x{2019}re near rubber plants (Section <<7.19|5a:0>>), you can at least have condoms a bit sooner. The pill works by introducing (synthetic) pregnancy hormones into the female body, making it behave like it\x{2019}s already pregnant, and thereby preventing the release of an egg. The hormones you need are estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen can actually be farmed from the urine of pregnant horses\x{2014}and is also useful for treating the symptoms of menopause\x{2014}but progesterone is much more difficult to synthesize. But just in case you get there, the chemical formula you\x{2019}re aiming to produce is C21H30O2. Even knowing something like the fact women have eggs puts you ahead of the game throughout most of history: in Greece around 350 BCE, Aristotle believed that men provided the \x{201c}seed\x{201d} and women only the \x{201c}nourishment.\x{201d} In Europe around 1200 CE, these ideas were still being debated, with the opposing side at least giving women a little more credit: they believed that male seeds and \x{201c}weaker\x{201d} female seeds combined somehow to produce new people. It was only in 1827 CE (!) that the fact that human women carry eggs inside them was confirmed.",
