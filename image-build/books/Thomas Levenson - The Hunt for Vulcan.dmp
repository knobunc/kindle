He has just missed its first appearance at the edge of the sun. Working backward from its apparent rate of motion, he estimates the time it crossed the solar limb at almost exactly <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> or, to be precise, at 3h 59m 46s P.M., plus or minus five seconds. He writes that down, using a piece of charcoal to scratch on a board. Another patient arrives and, likely with unrecorded frustration, he pulls his eye from his telescope. A few minutes later, he returns. The spot is still there, moving across the face of the sun. He tracks it continuously now, noting its nearest approach to the center of the solar circle, and then the instant and place it disappears over the solar limb. He records the time again: 5h 16m 55s. Total transit duration: <<one hour, seventeen minutes|14>> and nine seconds.

It came under a seemingly bland title, \x{201c}On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\x{201d}\x{2014}which masked the radical, almost subversive idea it contained, what we know as the special theory of relativity. It took him about six weeks to produce it, but once he was done, he was able to express his ideas in astonishingly simple, clear language, almost a story, in which he asks his readers to question what almost no one had ever paused to consider. What does it mean, he asked, to say that an event happens at a certain time? \x{201c}If,\x{201d} he wrote, \x{201c}I say that \x{2018}the train arrives here at <<7|9c:1>>\x{2019}o\x{2019}clock\x{2019} that means, more or less, \x{2018}the pointing of the small hand of my clock to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous.\x{2019}\x{2009}\x{201d} In other words\x{2014}to describe any event in nature you need a rigorous concept of time: how it is to be measured and how any two people can come to agree on when anything may be said to have happened.",

While he remained at the patent office for several more years, the inevitable move from a bureaucrat\x{2019}s job to an intellectual\x{2019}s got a hesitant start in 1907, when he became a part-time adjunct at the university in Bern. It took until <<1909|18:0>> to land his first full-time academic job, at the University of Zurich. It was a stopgap appointment, an untenured post that left Einstein at the bottom of the totem pole. But in a little over a year he received an offer of a full professorship, with all the status and security that implied. The difficulty was that the invitation came from the German University in Prague in early 1911\x{2014}in effect the far frontier of German-speaking Europe. In a common academic\x{2019}s story, he made the leap anyway: the post trumped geography.",
