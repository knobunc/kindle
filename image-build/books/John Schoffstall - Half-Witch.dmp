Squeaks filled the air and echoed off the buildings, along with the shouts and curses of hundreds of human mouse hunters. Official sorts of men dashed hither and thither: vergers, prebendaries, rectors, prelates, and sextons from the cathedral, marshals-of-the-peace from the Provost\x{2019}s office, pudding-faced inquisitors from the fearful chambers of the Morals Proctor, black-hooded torturers and scrofulous gaolers from the Houses of Correction. All had been pressed into service in the campaign against the mice.",

Short fat men in frock coats toddled about, bossing the secretaries. At the office\x{2019}s other end stood a great mahogany door guarded by a munifex with a musket.
