Then he stopped. <<One|9k:0>>! he counted in his mind. He placed his left hand ahead alongside his right. <<Two|9k:0>>! He crossed his right hand over his left. <<Three|9k:0>>! He brought his left hand around to his right. <<Four|9k:0>>! Each time he spread out his fingers to make his hand as broad as Signor Achmet\x{2019}s.",

He heard the cry as if from a thousand throats, \x{201c}They\x{2019}re away!\x{201d} Then the quickening music of hoofbeats. A few brief seconds, and they began fading, growing fainter and fainter until they were gone.",
