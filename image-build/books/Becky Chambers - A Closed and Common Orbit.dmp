            "They\x{2019}d been at the Shimmerquick celebration for <<two hours and three minutes|14>>, but Sidra had decided forty-six minutes prior that she liked alcohol. It had no cognitive effect on her, but there was such an incredible variety of concoctions to choose from, and they all triggered separate images. As her companions and their friends got ever louder and happier, she enjoyed someone else\x{2019}s memories of boats, fireworks, rainbows. She wasn\x{2019}t sure how much she enjoyed alcohol\x{2019}s effect on other sapients, though. Most of their behaviour was cute, even endearing. Blue had told her how glad he was that she had come to them, which was very gratifying to hear (though it lost some of its impact by the third or fourth time). Pepper was loud, but not as loud as her friend Gidge, who had crossed over from smart to sloppy. The sapients milling near their table were all various shades of inebriated as well. Relieved as Sidra had been to get a corner seat, she had reached a point where the desire for different input outweighed the comfort gained by staying put. She excused herself and walked along the edge of the party, holding half a glass of Sohep Sunset between both the kit\x{2019}s hands, staying as close to the outer wall as she could. She would\x{2019}ve liked to put her back to it and shuffle along sideways, like a crab, but that wasn\x{2019}t how Humans moved. There was a good chance that if she had walked that way, she\x{2019}d just be assumed to be drunk or high or both, but no, avoiding attention was the smarter call.",

Whatever framework rested below them had been sculpted to create leafy seats, living benches, private hollows to share secrets in, flat clearings to stretch out on. A few small trees were in there as well, creating subtle curtains and canopies. The curved walls surrounding everything were covered with projections of unending fields stretching outward, bright and clear as <<noon|13>>. It was realistic imagery, but the illusion had no effect on Sidra. She could tell that it wasn\x{2019}t the real thing, which made it easy for her to know where to stop looking. For an organic sapient, though, she imagined the effect would\x{2019}ve been quite convincing, and indeed, the people present seemed awfully content.

I\x{2019}m not saying this sim is solely responsible for Exodans and Solans not hating each other any more, but Big Bug was definitely a contributing factor in helping us start moving past all that old Earth bullshit.
