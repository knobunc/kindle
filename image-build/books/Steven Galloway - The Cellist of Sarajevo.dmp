Twenty-two people were killed and at least seventy were wounded. For the next twenty-two days Vedran Smailovi\x{107}, a renowned local cellist, played Albinoni\x{2019}s Adagio in G Minor at the site in honour of the dead. His actions inspired this novel, but I have not based the character of the cellist on the real Smailovi\x{107}, who was able to leave Sarajevo in December of 1993 and now lives in Northern Ireland.",
