The smallest infant to survive at birth, he says, weighed ten ounces and had a volume of three-tenths of a quart. (I do not know the formula for calculating the volume of a premature baby; perhaps he hired H. LaV. Twining to throw one into a graduated cylinder and note how much water it displaced.) The volume of the baby\x{2019}s Mac would be identical to its birth volume because, quoting Carpenter, \x{201c}if the volume of its\x{2026}Mac had been bigger than that, it would have stuck out of the child\x{2019}s body.\x{201d} Once again, Jesus is the exception.
