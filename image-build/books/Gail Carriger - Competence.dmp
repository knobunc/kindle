            "Just before sunset, Primrose took up position next to Bork, who was manning the Gatling gun. She\x{2019}d changed into evening attire for the negotiations, as was right and proper. Her dress was a <<midnight|13>>-blue velvet affair trimmed in delicate black lace and a tasteful sprinkling of crystal. She chose it because on a dark evening like this one, it was good camouflage. Plus it matched the night sky, the crystals like tiny stars scattered across the bodice. Primrose liked things to match. It also had gargantuan puffed sleeves, so big she needed her shoulder crinolines to support them. As the saying went: the bigger one\x{2019}s sleeves, the more angelic one\x{2019}s appearance. Primrose rather thought that massive sleeves would make her look intimidating to an enemy unfamiliar with current fashions.",
