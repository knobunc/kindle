            "It is important to understand some crucial facts about his life that have previously been overlooked: for example, although he was a devout Episcopalian late in life, he was only a nominal Methodist (his father\x{2019}s church) at the time he wrote \x{201c}Scanners Live in Vain.\x{201d} He originally joined the Episcopal Church as a compromise with his second wife, who was raised as a Catholic. Only <<about 1960|9n:0>> did he become a believer in any deep sense, and only then did the religious imagery and Christian message become strong in his SF works. The change in spiritual orientation that marks his later work is thus a genuine change, not merely a change of emphasis. There are also all kinds of details about the life of Paul M. A. Linebarger, his family and friends, that bear on his work\x{2014}as we shall see when Elms\x{2019} researches bear fruit.",
