            "We walked north on Fifth Avenue past the incredible buildings of glass and steel, glass and enameled metal, glass and marble, and the older ones of more stone than glass. It\x{2019}s a stunning street and unbelievable; I never get used to it, and I wonder if anyone really does. Is there any other place where an entire cloud bank can be completely reflected in the windows of one wall of only one building, and with room to spare? Today I especially enjoyed being out on Fifth, the temperature in the high 50\x{2019}s, a nice late-fall coolness in the air. It was <<nearly noon|13>>, and beautiful girls came dancing out of every office building we passed, and I thought of how regrettable it was that I\x{2019}d never know or even speak to most of them. The little bald man beside me said, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll tell you what I\x{2019}ve come to say to you; then I\x{2019}ll listen to questions. Maybe I\x{2019}ll even answer some. But everything I can really tell you I will have said before we reach Fifty-sixth Street. I\x{2019}ve done this thirty-odd times now, and never figured out a good way to say it or even sound very sane while trying, so here goes.",

            "Rossoff stood up, walked to his desk, and picked up a yellow wooden pencil. He sat down again, hitching his chair closer to mine till we sat only a yard apart, facing each other. Holding the pencil vertically before me, by the point, he said, \x{201c}We\x{2019}ll use an object. This or most anything else will do; it doesn\x{2019}t have to be shiny. Just stare at it, if you will, please, not particularly intently; and if you want to blink or glance away do so. The only important thing here is that if you tense up and resist, I won\x{2019}t be able to do it. I need your okay in more than words; you have to agree mentally. Within yourself. And completely. All the way. Don\x{2019}t fight it at all. Don\x{2019}t resist. Are you perfectly comfortable? Just nod, if you are.\x{201d} I nodded. \x{201c}Fine. If you sense any resistance in your mind, let it thaw. Just sit and watch it melt, then let it drain away. Relax your muscles, incidentally; I want you really quite comfortable. Relax even your jaw; let your mouth hang open a little, and let your eyes unfocus. I think you\x{2019}re feeling it a little now; you\x{2019}re intelligent and perceptive, and I believe you\x{2019}re accepting this very well. Really very well, and it\x{2019}s rather pleasant, isn\x{2019}t it? And nothing to be concerned about. Occasionally I practice auto-hypnosis, which can be done very easily, and which you will learn, too. Just four or five minutes of self-hypnosis, which actually means nothing more than opening your mind to suggestion, your own suggestion, can be wonderfully refreshing. I can cure a tension headache with it; I never use aspirin. I think you\x{2019}re feeling how relaxing this can be. Isn\x{2019}t it a nice way to rest? Better than a drink, better than a cocktail.\x{201d} He lowered the pencil, saying, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll tell you how wonderfully relaxed you are, in fact. Look at your right arm lying there on the arm of your chair. It\x{2019}s so completely relaxed, more than ever before in your life, even when you\x{2019}ve been asleep, that you can\x{2019}t lift it. The muscles are too relaxed, they refuse to move. When I count to three you\x{2019}ll see for yourself. Try to lift your arm when I say \x{2018}<<three|9k:0>>.\x{2019} You won\x{2019}t be able to. <<One|9k:0>>. <<Two|9k:0>>. <<Three|9k:0>>.\x{201d}",

At the sound of our feet on the gravel as we stepped out onto the roof, they turned and spoke, and Danziger smiled and flicked his hand in a wave. The rooftop was immense; a city-block square of tar and gravel, ordinary enough except for scores of new skylights set into it, and a forest of stacks and vents.

Generally there\x{2019}d be more offices or a barbershop or restaurant or something in the basement section, half below street level, the stairway down to it protected by black iron guard railings with a row of points along the street-level railing to keep loafers from sitting on them. The buildings were constructed from every possible material; there was plenty of brick and wood; there were some whose entire fronts were of cast iron, often as high as three or four stories; there were marble and granite, brownstone, wood, and even stucco. And they were of mixed periods; between newer four- and five-story stone office buildings I passed a lot of small, modest houses of an obviously earlier time, with old-fashioned dormer windows in the upper stories, but the lower stories turned into shops with plate-glass display windows. At <<one|9m:1>> such display window eight or ten men were standing, and I joined them. A girl, looking very prim and a little embarrassed, and never glancing at us, sat demonstrating a typewriter.

It was all free with a five-cent stein of beer, which I ordered, and which tasted different from today\x{2019}s beer. There was much more taste to it, of malt or hops, I think, I\x{2019}m not sure which. Sipping the beer, I stood eating all the lunch I could manage, and I read a big oak-framed sign over the back bar: gilt letters against a black background on a shiny mirrorlike glass surface.
