            "Finally, she decided that if she couldn\x{2019}t buy the most haunted house in the world, she would build it herself. First she chose the most haunted spot she could think of upon which to build it: the top of a hill that had been the site of a mass burial during the last outbreak of plague. Then she collected the most haunted building materials she could find: wood salvaged from a shipwreck with no survivors, bricks from a crematorium, stone columns from a poorhouse that had burned with hundreds of people inside, and windows from the palace of a mad prince who had poisoned his whole family. Hildy decorated the house with furniture, carpets, and objets d\x{2019}art bought from other haunted houses, including that of the man in Portugal, who sent her a bureau from which emanated, at precisely <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>> every morning, the sound of a crying baby. Just for good measure, she let bereaved families hold wakes in her parlor for an entire month, and then, just after the stroke of <<midnight|12>> in the middle of a howling rainstorm, she moved in.",

The few ghosts that remained were friendly to her, though she didn\x{2019}t need ghost friends anymore because now she had Jo\x{e3}o. Before long they had a daughter and a son, too, and Hildy\x{2019}s life was fuller than she\x{2019}d ever dreamed it could be. And as if that weren\x{2019}t enough, one fine <<midnight|13>> there was a knock on the front door, and who should Hildy find floating there on the porch but the ghosts of her sister and her parents.",

            "All day long people came to the door seeking Lavinia\x{2019}s help: a mother tormented by dreams of a lost child; small kids brought by anxious parents; an old man who each night relived scenes from a bloody war he\x{2019}d fought half a century ago. She drew out dozens of nightmares and added them to the ball. After three days the ball was as large as a watermelon. <<After six|9:0>> it was nearly the size of their dog, Cheeky, who bared his teeth and growled whenever he saw it. (When the ball growled back, Cheeky dove out an open window and didn\x{2019}t come back.)",

When the clock struck <<midnight|11>>, they snuck out and went all over town giving nightmares to people on the list\x{2014}the worst to those at the top, itty-bitty ones to those further down. Lavinia pulled strands from Baxter and sent them wriggling up drainpipes and through open windows toward their intended targets. By the night\x{2019}s end they had visited dozens of houses and Baxter had shrunk to the size of an apple\x{2014}small enough to fit in Lavinia\x{2019}s pocket.
