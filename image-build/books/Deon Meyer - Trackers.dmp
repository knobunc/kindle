But in Africa, carrion is always guaranteed to attract the scavengers. Enter Mr Sayyid Khalid bin Alawi Macki, a businessman and mining magnate from Oman, with all the technical expertise needed for the job. Within a week, they had created a joint venture between Osleg, the business wing of the Zimbabwean armed forces, the Zim government, and Macki. And our Mr Macki, apparently, is the one with ties to al-Qaeda. Through his many companies, he not only launders money for the terrorists, but also directly supplies, funds, arms, and equips them. So now you will understand how difficult it has become for Chitepo to get rid of the diamonds. Everybody has been watching, including the CIA. All the usual channels are blocked, all the border posts are being monitored. According to the bush telegraph, Chitepo is getting more and more desperate to sell the diamonds, and time is running out. For him, for Mugabe, for Zimbabwe. I mean, who knows where this new coalition government will lead? It\'s every man for himself now, and even they are watching each other like hawks ... Anyway, that night, during the Big Barbecue, Johnson Chitepo was spending a lot of time with Cornel. As a matter of fact, when I left <<just before midnight|10>>, they were sitting, just the two of them, heads together, very deep in discussion. And I think I know what they were talking about. I mean, she would have been perfect - a South African, white, no obvious ties to smuggling. And using the rhinos ... Well, that\'s very, very clever.\'',
