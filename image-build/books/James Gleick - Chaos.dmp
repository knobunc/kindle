When you look at early stuff of Van Gogh there are zillions of details that are put into it, there\x{2019}s always an immense amount of information in his paintings. It obviously occurred to him, what is the irreducible amount of this stuff that you have to put in. Or you can study the horizons in Dutch ink drawings from <<around 1600|9c:0>>, with tiny trees and cows that look very real.

            "Now, in spite of himself, Hubbard began using a computer to do what the orthodox techniques had not done. The computer would prove nothing. But at least it might unveil the truth so that a mathematician could know what it was he should try to prove. So Hubbard began to experiment. He treated Newton\x{2019}s method not as a way of solving problems but as a problem in itself. Hubbard considered the simplest example of a degree-three polynomial, the equation x\x{2013} 1 =0. That is, find the cube root of 1. In real numbers, of course, there is just the trivial solution: 1. But the polynomial also has two complex solutions: \x{2013}\x{bd} + i\x{221a}3/2, and \x{2013}\x{bd} \x{2013} i\x{221a}3/2.

Given any complex number as a starting point, the question was to see which of the three solutions Newton\x{2019}s method would lead to. It was as if Newton\x{2019}s method were a dynamical system and the three solutions were three attractors. Or it was as if the complex plane were a smooth surface sloping down toward three deep valleys. A marble starting from anywhere on the plane should roll into one of the valleys\x{2014}but which?",

            "Beyond its technical aptness to the beginning of the computer era, Shannon information theory gained a modest philosophical stature, and a surprising part of the theory\x{2019}s appeal to people beyond Shannon\x{2019}s field could be attributed to the choice of a single word: entropy. As Warren Weaver put it in a classic exposition of information theory, \x{201c}When one meets the concept of entropy in communication theory, he has a right to be rather excited\x{2014}a right to suspect that one has hold of something that may turn out to be basic and important.\x{201d} The concept of entropy comes from thermodynamics, where it serves as an adjunct of the Second Law, the inexorable tendency of the universe, and any isolated system in it, to slide toward a state of increasing disorder. Divide a swimming pool in half with some barrier; fill one half with water and one with ink; wait for all to be still; lift the barrier; simply through the random motion of molecules, eventually the ink and water will mix. The mixing never reverses itself, even if you wait till the end of the universe, which is why the Second Law is so often said to be the part of physics that makes time a one-way street. Entropy is the name for the quality of systems that increases under the Second Law\x{2014}mixing, disorder, randomness. The concept is easier to grasp intuitively than to measure in any real-life situation. What would be a reliable test for the level of mixing of two substances? One could imagine counting the molecules of each in some sample. But what if they were arranged yes-no\x{2013}yes-no\x{2013}yes-no\x{2013}yes-no? Entropy could hardly be described as high. One could count just the even molecules, but what if the arrangement were yes-no\x{2013}no-yes\x{2013}yes-no\x{2013}no-yes? Order intrudes in ways that defy any straightforward counting algorithm. And in information theory, issues of meaning and representation present extra complications. A sequence like 01 <<0100|18:0>> <<0100|18:0>> <<0010|18:0>> 111 010 11 00 000 0010 111 010 11 <<0100|18:0>> 0 000 000\x{2026}might seem orderly only to an observer familiar with Morse code and Shakespeare.
