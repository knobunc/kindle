            'For drawing to my attention theories that human consciousness is an electromagnetic phenomenon, I thank Norm Nason. Two such theories, similar in most particulars, have recently and independently been developed by Johnjoe McFadden, Ph.D., School of Biomedical and Life Science, University of Surrey, and Susan Pockett, Ph.D., Department of Physics, University of Auckland. For those interested in reading more about them, McFadden presents a general account of his version in the closing chapter of his book Quantum Evolution: The New Science of Life (HarperCollins UK, <<2000|9l>>; W. W. Norton USA, 2001), and Pockett devotes her entire book The Nature of Consciousness: A Hypothesis (Writers Club Press, 2000) to her version of this theory.',
