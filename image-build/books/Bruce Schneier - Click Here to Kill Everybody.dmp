Microsoft spent the decade <<after 2002|18:0>> improving its software development process to minimize the number of security vulnerabilities in shipped software. Its products are by no means perfect\x{2014}that\x{2019}s beyond the capabilities of the technologies right now\x{2014}but they\x{2019}re a lot better than average. Apple is known for its quality software. So is Google. Some very small and critical pieces of software are high quality. Aircraft avionics software is written to a much more rigorous quality standard than just about everything else. And NASA had a famous quality control process for its space shuttle software.",

Throughout those centuries, a printing press was only ever a printing press. No matter how hard its operator tried, it couldn\x{2019}t be made to perform calculus or play music or weigh fish. Your old thermostat was an electromechanical device that sensed the temperature, and turned a circuit on and off in response. That circuit was connected to your furnace, which gave the thermostat the ability to turn your heat on and off. That\x{2019}s all it could do. And your old camera could only take pictures.",

Hackers linked to China compromised the legitimate download site for a popular Windows tool called CCleaner, resulting in millions of users unsuspectingly downloading a malware-infected version of the software. Unknown hackers corrupted the legitimate software update mechanism for a piece of Ukrainian accounting software to spread NotPetya malware throughout the country. Another group used fake antivirus updates to spread malware. Researchers demonstrated how to hack an iPhone by infecting a third-party replacement screen. And there are enough similar attacks that some people are warning not to buy any used IoT devices from sites like eBay.',
