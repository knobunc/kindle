Initially, some members of the committee expressed reservations about Crookall\x{2019}s proposal, but it was eventually endorsed. The committee agreed that the \x{2018}Isle of Man Treasure Hunt Scheme\x{2019} should take place at the start of the holiday season and run at the same time as the International Tourist Trophy motorcycle races, then in their 24th year, and alongside other annual events such as the \x{2018}crowning of the Rose Queen\x{2019} and the <<midnight|13>> yacht race.",
