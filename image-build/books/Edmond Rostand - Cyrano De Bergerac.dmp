            "A great deal of lore surrounds the premiere of Cyrano de Bergerac at the Theatre de la Porte-Saint-Martin in Paris on December 28, 1897. That just before the curtain went up, Rostand fell at the feet of leading actor Constant Coquelin and exclaimed: \x{201c}Forgive me! Oh, forgive me, my friend, for having dragged you into this disastrous adventure!\x{201d} That he then donned a costume and slipped onstage during the first act, causing surprise and confusion among the actors. That the first act was greeted with bravos, the following ones with standing ovations, and the final scene with forty-two curtain calls, so many that at <<two o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> the exhausted stage manager simply left the curtain open and went home to bed.",

            "Much of this lore comes from an interview given by Rostand himself, as well as from an account of opening night by his wife, Rosemonde G\x{e9}rard. Theater people, especially when they are also interested parties, can be relied upon to dramatize a little; it is indeed their prerogative. Still, by any account, Cyrano de Bergerac was an immense, indeed a phenomenal, success. At <<twenty-nine|9:0>>\x{2014}the English critic Sir Max Beerbohm referred to him as \x{201c}the talented boy-playwright\x{201d}\x{2014}Rostand became what we now know as an overnight sensation: Only Victor Hugo, and then only after a long career as a writer and statesman, had known the kind of fame and glory that Rostand achieved in a single night. Paris was in a collective swoon. The most caustic of theater critics\x{2014}men who were paid to be nasty\x{2014}hailed Cyrano as \x{201c}the most beautiful dramatic poem to appear for half a century\x{201d} (Emile Faguet in Le Journal des d\x{e9}bats) and spoke of December 2 8 as \x{201c}a date that will live in the annals of the theater\x{201d} (Francisque Sarcey of Le Temps). The 29th started out pretty well, too: On that day the French Minister of Education nominated Rostand for the Legion d\x{2018}Honneur, France\x{2019}s highest honor. Two days later, just in time for the New Year\x{2019}s honors list, the decree officially naming him a chevalier de la Legion d\x{2019}Honneur had found its way onto the desk of Felix Faure, president of the Republic, who, having signed it, booked a loge at the Theatre de la Porte-Saint-Martin for himself and his family. More laurels were to follow. Elected to the Acad\x{e9}mie des sciences morales et politiques in 1898, Rostand would surely have been elected also to the Acad\x{e9}mie fran\x{e7}aise were its membership not fixed at seventy (someone has to die before a new member can be elected; Rostand had to wait until <<1901|18:0>>). Cyrano was soon being performed in New York (at the Garden Theater in 1898), in Berlin (at the Deutsches Theater in 1898), in London (in French at the Lyceum in 1898 , in English at Wyndham\x{2019}s Theatre in 1900). The play was translated into the major European languages: in 1898 into English (two versions), German, Dutch, Italian, Hungarian, and Polish (two versions); in 1899 into Spanish, Czech, and, once again, into Polish.",
