            "Joseph would catch glimpses of the Running Man from time to time as he ghosted past Arthur Street and disappeared down Ashgrove Avenue, yet he usually had no idea where the Running Man came from or where he was headed. Besides these random sightings on the street, the only other time Joseph saw the Running Man was in St Jude\x{2019}s Church at <<one|3b>> of the Sunday services. He also remembered Mrs Mossop once remarking in disgust that the Running Man quite often turned up at funerals, \x{2018}uninvited and unwashed\x{2019}. In church, the Running Man never sat anywhere else but in the last row. There he perched on the edge of the pew with his body hunched up like a man sheltering in a blizzard, while his eyes darted erratically without appearing to look at anything in particular. His body, meanwhile, rocked ever so slightly but insistently. No matter how full the church might otherwise have been, there were always spaces around the Running Man.",

He was about to lie back down when a movement in the neighbours\x{2019} yard caught his eye. Someone was behind the big mulberry tree that arched over the old incinerator by the side fence. Joseph waited. The figure moved slowly to the front of the tree. Although the moonlight yielded only a vague outline, Joseph knew he was looking at Tom Leyton.",
