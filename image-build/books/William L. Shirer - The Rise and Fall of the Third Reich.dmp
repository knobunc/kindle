From a window in the Kaiserhof, Goebbels, Roehm and other Nazi chiefs kept an anxious watch on the door of the Chancellery, where the Fuehrer would shortly be coming out. \x{201c}We would see from his face whether he had succeeded or not,\x{201d} Goebbels noted.

            "That evening from dusk until far <<past midnight|13>> the delirious Nazi storm troopers marched in a massive torchlight parade to celebrate the victory. By the tens of thousands, they emerged in disciplined columns from the depths of the Tiergarten, passed under the triumphal arch of the Brandenburg Gate and down the Wilhelmstrasse, their bands blaring the old martial airs to the thunderous beating of the drums, their voices bawling the new Horst Wessel song and other tunes that were as old as Germany, their jack boots beating a mighty rhythm on the pavement, their torches held high and forming a ribbon of flame that illuminated the night and kindled the hurrahs of the onlookers massed on the sidewalks. From a window in the palace Hindenburg looked down upon the marching throng, beating time to the military marches with his cane, apparently pleased that at last he had picked a Chancellor who could arouse the people in a traditionally German way. Whether the old man, in his dotage, had any inkling of what he had unleashed that day is doubtful. A story, probably apocryphal, soon spread over Berlin that in the midst of the parade he had turned to an old general and said, \x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t know we had taken so many Russian prisoners.\x{201d}",

By <<1932|9:0>> this economic wizard, whose responsibility for the coming of the Third Reich and for its early successes proved to be so immeasurably great, was writing Hitler: \x{201c}I have no doubt that the present development of things can only lead to your becoming Chancellor \x{2026} Your movement is carried internally by so strong a truth and necessity that victory cannot elude you long \x{2026} No matter where my work may take me in the near future, even if someday you should see me imprisoned in a fortress, you can always count on me as your loyal supporter.\x{201d} One of the two letters from which these words are taken was signed: \x{201c}With a vigorous \x{2018}Heil.\x{2019}\x{201d}",

The minutes of the session, which turned up at Nuremberg among the hundreds of tons of captured secret documents, reveal how quickly and adroitly Hitler, aided by the crafty Goering, began to take his conservative colleagues for a ride. Hindenburg had named Hitler to head not a presidential cabinet but one based on a majority in the Reichstag. However, the Nazis and the Nationalists, the only two parties represented in the government, had only 247 seats out of 583 in Parliament and thus lacked a majority. To attain it they needed the backing of the Center Party with its 70 seats. In the very first hours of the new government Hitler had dispatched Goering to talk with the Centrist leaders, and now he reported to the cabinet that the Center was demanding \x{201c}certain concessions.\x{201d} Goering therefore proposed that the Reichstag be dissolved and new elections held, and Hitler agreed. Hugenberg, a man of wooden mind for all his success in business, objected to taking the Center into the government but on the other hand opposed new elections, well knowing that the Nazis, with the resources of the State behind them, might win an absolute majority at the polls and thus be in a position to dispense with his own services and those of his conservative friends. He proposed simply suppressing the Communist Party; with its 100 seats eliminated, the Nazis and the Nationalists would have a majority. But Hitler would not go so far at the moment, and it was finally agreed that the Chancellor himself would confer with the Center Party leaders on the following morning and that if the talks were fruitless the cabinet would then ask for new elections.",

The Army Command itself was demanding his resignation; as Jodl\x{2019}s diary of two days later reveals, the Chief of the General Staff, General Beck, had informed Keitel that \x{201c}one cannot tolerate the highest-ranking soldier marrying a whore.\x{201d} On January 25, Jodl learned through Keitel that Hitler had dismissed his Field Marshal.

As Field Marshal von Blomberg testified at Nuremberg, \x{201c}<<Before 1938|9:0>>\x{2013}39 German generals did not oppose Hitler. There was no reason to oppose him, since he produced the results they desired.\x{201d} There was some contact between Goerdeler and General von Hammerstein, but the former Commander in Chief of the German Army had been in retirement since 1934 and had little influence among the active generals. Early in the regime Schlabrendorff had got in touch with Colonel Hans Oster, chief assistant to Admiral Canaris in the Abwehr, the Intelligence Bureau of OKW, and found him to be not only a staunch anti-Nazi but willing to try to bridge the gulf between the military and civilians. However, it was not until the winter of 1937\x{2013}38, when the generals were subjected to the successive shocks engendered by Hitler\x{2019}s decision to go to war, his shake-up of the military command, which he himself took over, and his shabby treatment of General von Fritsch, that some of them became aware of the danger to Germany of the Nazi dictator. The resignation of General Beck toward the end of August 1938, as the Czech crisis grew more menacing, provided a further awakening, and though none of his fellow officers followed him into retirement as he had hoped, it immediately became evident that the fallen Chief of the General Staff was the one person around whom both the recalcitrant generals and the civilian resistance leaders could rally. Both groups respected and trusted him.",

In fact the only difficulty, he reported, was a distinctly minor one concerning the division of spoils. The Russians, he said, were demanding that Germany recognize the small ports of Libau and Windau in Latvia \x{201c}as being in their sphere of interest.\x{201d} Since all of Latvia was to be placed on the Soviet side of the line dividing the interests of the two powers, this demand presented no problem and Hitler quickly agreed. Ribbentrop also advised the Fuehrer after the first conference that \x{201c}the signing of a secret protocol on the delimitation of mutual spheres of interest in the whole Eastern area is contemplated.\x{201d}",

            "The British government soon learned of this. On August 17 Sumner Welles, the U.S. Undersecretary of State, informed the British ambassador in Washington of Molotov\x{2019}s suggestions to Schulenburg. The American ambassador in Moscow had wired them to Washington the day before and they were deadly accurate. Ambassador Steinhardt had seen Molotov on August 16.
It was signed in Berlin at <<2 A.M.|5>> on Sunday, August 20.
No official minutes of Hitler\x{2019}s harangue have been found, but several records of it, two of them made by high-ranking officers from notes jotted down during the meeting, have come to light. One by Admiral Hermann Boehm, Chief of the High Seas Fleet, was submitted at Nuremberg in Admiral Raeder\x{2019}s defense and is published in the original German in TMWC, XLI, pp. 16\x{2013}25. General Halder made voluminous notes in his unique Gabelsberger shorthand, and an English translation of them from his diary entry of August 22 is published in DGFP, VII, pp. 557\x{2013}59. The chief document of the session used by the prosecution as evidence in the Nuremberg trial was an unsigned memorandum in two parts from the OKW files which were captured by American troops at Saalfelden in the Austrian Tyrol. It is printed in English translation in NC A, III, pp. 581\x{2013}86 (Nuremberg Document 798-PS), 665\x{2013}66 (N.D. 1014-PS). and also in DGFP, VII, pp. 200\x{2013}6. The original German text of the two-part memorandum is, of course, in the TMWC volumes. It makes Hitler\x{2019}s language somewhat more lively than do Admiral Boehm and General Halder. But all three versions are similar in content and there can be no doubt of their authenticity. At Nuremberg there was some doubt about a fourth account of Hitler\x{2019}s speech, listed as N.D. C-3 (NCA, VII, pp. 752\x{2013}54), and though it was referred to in the proceedings the prosecution did not submit it in evidence. While it undoubtedly rings true, it may have been embellished a little by persons who were not present at the meeting at the Berghof. In piecing together Hitler\x{2019}s remarks I have used the records of Boehm and Halder and the unsigned memorandum submitted at Nuremberg as evidence.",

Then he calmed down, assured his visitor that the Fuehrer was already at work drawing up a \x{201c}magnanimous\x{201d} (\x{201c}grosszuegig\x{201d}) offer to Poland in which the only clear-cut demand would be the return of Danzig and generously leaving the future of the Corridor to be decided by a plebiscite \x{201c}under international control.\x{201d} Dahlerus mildly inquired about the size of the plebiscite area, whereupon Goering tore a page out of an old atlas and with colored pencils shaded off the \x{201c}Polish\x{201d} and \x{201c}German\x{201d} parts, including in the latter not only prewar Prussian Poland but the industrial city of L\x{f3}d\x{17a}, which was sixty miles east of the 1914 frontier. The Swedish interloper could not help but notice the \x{201c}rapidity and the recklessness\x{201d} with which such important decisions were made in the Third Reich. However, he agreed to Goering\x{2019}s request that he fly immediately back to London, emphasize to the British government that Hitler still wanted peace and hint that as proof of it the Fuehrer was already drawing up a most generous offer to Poland.",

He reached Goering\x{2019}s headquarters at <<half past midnight|10>> to find the Luftwaffe chief once more in an expansive mood. The Fuehrer, said Goering, had just handed Henderson through Ribbentrop a \x{201c}democratic, fair and workable offer\x{201d} to Poland. Dahlerus, who seems to have been sobered by his meeting in Downing Street, called up Forbes at the British Embassy to check and learned that Ribbentrop had \x{201c}gabbled\x{201d} the terms so fast that Henderson had not been able to fully grasp them and that the ambassador had been refused a copy of the text. Dahlerus says he told Goering that this was no way \x{201c}to treat the ambassador of an empire like Great Britain\x{201d} and suggested that the Field Marshal, who had a copy of the sixteen points, permit him to telephone the text to the British Embassy.

Henderson was still trying to persuade the Polish ambassador to establish the \x{201c}desired contact\x{201d} with the Germans. At <<8 A.M.|5>> he had once more urged this on Lipski, this time over the telephone, warning him that unless Poland acted by <<noon|13>> there would be war. Shortly after Dahlerus had arrived with the text of the German proposals, Henderson dispatched him, along with Forbes, to the Polish Embassy. Lipski, who had never heard of Dahlerus, was somewhat confused at meeting the Swede\x{2014}he was by this time, like most of the key diplomats in Berlin, strained and dead tired\x{2014}and became irritated when Dahlerus urged him to go immediately to Goering and accept the Fuehrer\x{2019}s offer. Requesting the Swede to dictate the sixteen points to a secretary in an adjoining room, he expressed his annoyance to Forbes for bringing in a \x{201c}stranger\x{201d} at this late date on so serious a matter. The harassed Polish ambassador must have been depressed too at the pressure which Henderson was bringing on him and his government to negotiate immediately on the basis of an offer which he had just received quite unofficially and surreptitiously, but which the British envoy, as he had told Lipski the night before, thought was not \x{201c}on the whole too unreasonable.\x{201d} He did not know that Henderson\x{2019}s view was not endorsed by Downing Street.

At Narvik, the port and railhead of the iron ore line from Sweden, Colonel Konrad Sundlo, in command of the local garrison, who, as we have seen, was a fanatical follower of Quisling,* surrendered to the Germans without firing a shot. The naval commander was of a different caliber. With the approach of ten German destroyers at the mouth of the long fjord, the Eidsvold, one of two ancient ironclads in the harbor, fired a warning shot and signaled to the destroyers to identify themselves. Rear Admiral Fritz Bonte, commanding the German destroyer flotilla, answered by sending an officer in a launch to the Norwegian vessel to demand surrender. There now followed a bit of German treachery, though German naval officers later defended it with the argument that in war necessity knows no law. When the officer in the launch signaled the German Admiral that the Norwegians had said they would resist, Bonte waited only until his launch got out of the way and then quickly blew up the Eidsvold with torpedoes. The second Norwegian ironclad, the Norge, then opened fire but was quickly dispatched. Three hundred Norwegian sailors\x{2014}almost the entire crews of the two vessels\x{2014}perished. By <<8 A.M.|5>> Narvik was in the hands of the Germans, taken by ten destroyers which had slipped through a formidable British fleet, and occupied by a mere two battalions of Nazi troops under the command of Brigadier General Eduard Dietl, an old Bavarian crony of Hitler since the days of the Beer Hall Putsch, who was to prove himself a resourceful and courageous commander when the going at Narvik got rough, as it did beginning the next day.",

            "That the battered Belgian troops were in desperate straits by May 27 there is no dispute. Valiantly they had agreed to extend their front in order to free the British and French to fight their way south. And that extended front was fast collapsing though the Belgians fought doggedly. Also Leopold was not told that on May 26 Lord Gort had received orders from London to withdraw to Dunkirk and save what he could of the B.E.F. That is one side of the argument, but there is another. The Belgian Army was under the over-all Allied Command and Leopold made a separate peace without consulting it. In his defense it has been pointed out that on May 27 at <<12:30 P.M.|2a>> he telegraphed Gort that he soon would \x{201c}be forced to capitulate to avoid a collapse.\x{201d} But the British commander, who was extremely busy and constantly on the move, did not receive it. He later testified that he first heard of the surrender only <<shortly after 11 P.M.|5>> on May 27 and found himself \x{201c}suddenly faced with an open gap of twenty miles between Ypres and the sea through which enemy armored forces might reach the beaches.\x{201d} To General Weygand, who was the King s superior military commander, the news arrived by telegram from French liaison at Belgian headquarters <<a little after 6 P.M.|5>> and it hit him, he later said, \x{201c}like a bolt out of the blue.

The Fuehrer visited the General\x{2019}s Army Group A headquarters at Charleville on the morning of May 24. Rundstedt proposed that the panzer divisions on the canal line before Dunkirk be halted until more infantry could be brought up. * Hitler agreed, observing that the armor should be conserved for later operations against the French south of the Somme. Moreover, he declared that if the pocket in which the Allies were entrapped became too small it would hamper the activities of the Luftwaffe. Probably Rundstedt, with the approval of the Fuehrer, issued the stop order at once, for Churchill notes that the B.E.F. intercepted a German radio message giving orders to that effect at <<11:42 that morning|2a>>.

That night the German armor resumed its attack on the port from the west and south, but now the panzers found it hard going. Lord Gort had had time to deploy against them three infantry divisions with heavy artillery support. The tanks made little progress. In the meantime the evacuation began. An armada of 850 vessels of all sizes, shapes and methods of propulsion, from cruisers and destroyers to small sailboats and Dutch skoots, many of them manned by civilian volunteers from the English coastal towns, converged on Dunkirk. The first day, May 27, they took off 7,669 troops; the next day, 17,804; the following day, 47,310; and on May 30, 53,823, for a total of 126,606 during the first four days.

It was to be on the same spot where the German Empire had capitulated to France and her allies on November 11, 1918: in the little clearing in the woods at Compi\x{e8}gne. There the Nazi warlord would get his revenge, and the place itself would add to the sweetness of it for him. On May 20, a bare ten days after the great offensive in the West had started and on the day the German tanks reached Abbeville, the idea had come to him.

They alighted from their automobiles some two hundred yards away, in front of the Alsace-Lorraine statue, which was draped with German war flags so that the Fuehrer could not see (though I remembered from previous visits in happier days) the large sword, the sword of the victorious Allies of 1918, sticking through a limp eagle representing the German Empire of the Hohenzollerns.

            "December 6 came. Zhukov that very day launched his counteroffensive in front of Moscow and the German armies reeled back in the snow and bitter cold. There was all the more reason for Hitler to demand his quid pro quo. On this question there was great uneasiness in the Foreign Office in Tokyo. The naval task force was now within flying distance of Pearl Harbor for its carrier planes. So far\x{2014}miraculously\x{2014}it had not been discovered by American ships or aircraft. But it might be any moment. A long message was being radioed from Tokyo to Nomura and Kurusu in Washington instructing them to call on Secretary Hull at precisely <<1 P.M.|5>> the next day, Sunday, December 7, to present Japan\x{2019}s rejection of the latest American proposals, and stressing that the negotiations were \x{201c}de facto ruptured.\x{201d} In desperation Tokyo turned to Berlin for a written guarantee of German support. The Japanese warlords still did not trust the Germans enough to inform them of the blow against the United States which would fall the next day. But they were more worried than ever that Hitler would refrain from giving his guarantee unless Japan agreed to take on not only the United States and Great Britain but the Soviet Union as well. In this predicament Togo got off a long message to Ambassador Oshima in Berlin urging him to somehow stall the Germans on the Russian matter and not to give in unless it became absolutely necessary. Deluded though they were about their ability to deal with the Americans and the British, the Japanese generals and admirals retained enough sense to realize that they could not fight the Russians at the same time\x{2014}even with German help. Togo\x{2019}s instructions to Oshima on that fateful Saturday, December 6, which are among the intercepted messages decoded by Secretary Hull\x{2019}s expert decipherers, give an interesting insight into the diplomacy practiced by the Nipponese with the Third Reich at the eleventh hour.",

Though the chief conspirators had known that Stauffenberg had left for Rastenburg that morning \x{201c}heavily laden,\x{201d} as General Hoepner was informed, to attend the <<1 P.M.|5>> Fuehrer conference, only a few of them, and these mostly junior officers, began to drift leisurely into the headquarters of the Replacement Army\x{2014}and of the plot\x{2014}in the Bendlerstrasse <<toward noon|13>>. On Stauffenberg\x{2019}s last previous attempt to get Hitler, on July 15, it will be recalled, General Olbricht had ordered the troops of the Berlin garrison to start marching two hours before the bomb was timed to go off. But on July 20, perhaps mindful of the risk he had run, he did not issue similar orders. Unit commanders in Berlin and in the training centers in nearby Doeberitz, Jueterbog, Krampnitz and Wuensdorf had been tipped the night before that they would most probably be receiving the Valkyrie orders on the twentieth. But Olbricht decided to wait until definite word had come from Fellgiebel at Rastenburg before again setting his troops in motion. General Hoepner, with the uniform which Hitler had forbade him to wear in his suitcase, arrived at the Bendlerstrasse at <<thirty minutes past noon|10>>\x{2014}at the very moment Stauffenberg was breaking the capsule of his bomb\x{2014}and he and Olbricht went out for lunch, where they toasted the success of their enterprise with a half bottle of wine.",
