            "And now the Rolex said <<three o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>>. I needed  some time to think, to consider the situation, figure out my next move. I fingered the buttons on my cell phone, flipped through my list of contacts, but I already knew I wouldn\x{2019}t call anyone. Maybe Jen and I could still fix this thing, and if we did, we wouldn\x{2019}t want anyone looking at us funny. I knew irrevocable damage had been done, innocence had been lost, trust slaughtered, but still, it was the age-old conundrum: If a wife sleeps with a boss, but no one finds out about it, did it actually happen? There was no one to call, no friends who weren\x{2019}t also connected to Jen. I thought about calling my mother, but my father was in a coma and she had enough to deal with. My life was in a free fall, and there was nowhere to turn. A cold sense of desolation lodged itself somewhere in the base of my throat, and suddenly I was no longer enraged or devastated, but terrified of the immense, throbbing loneliness that was only now closing like a vise on my internal organs.",

Ray and I got drunk and he confided in me that he\x{2019}d give anything to have sex with someone who looked like Jen. We joked about swapping for the night.
