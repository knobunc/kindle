I fingered the buttons on my cell phone, flipped through my list of contacts, but I already knew I wouldn\x{2019}t call anyone. Maybe Jen and I could still fix this thing, and if we did, we wouldn\x{2019}t want anyone looking at us funny. I knew irrevocable damage had been done, innocence had been lost, trust slaughtered, but still, it was the age-old conundrum: If a wife sleeps with a boss, but no one finds out about it, did it actually happen? There was no one to call, no friends who weren\x{2019}t also connected to Jen. I thought about calling my mother, but my father was in a coma and she had enough to deal with. My life was in a free fall, and there was nowhere to turn. A cold sense of desolation lodged itself somewhere in the base of my throat, and suddenly I was no longer enraged or devastated, but terrified of the immense, throbbing loneliness that was only now closing like a vise on my internal organs.",

The gravedigger looks like Santa Claus, and I don\x{2019}t believe for a minute he doesn\x{2019}t know it. With his long white beard and stout build, he has to know the effect of wearing a red and white anorak and how inappropriate the whole getup looks in the Mount Zion Cemetery. When you spend your days putting corpses into the ground, I guess you have to find the fun where you can. But this morning, as we bury my father in a teeming downpour, Saint Nick is all business, even as his ridiculous raincoat makes him stand out like a bloodstain against a sky the color of a dead tooth. He quietly directs the pallbearers in the placement of the coffin onto the hydraulic frame rigged over the freshly dug grave. Paul and I are at the head of the coffin, and Wendy\x{2019}s husband, Barry, is in the middle, across from the empty spot where Phillip would have been if he\x{2019}d shown up. My uncle Mickey and his son Julius, fresh off the plane from Miami, carry the foot of the coffin. We haven\x{2019}t seen Mickey in decades\x{2014}he and Dad had a falling-out over some money Dad lent him\x{2014}and Julius is all but a stranger to us.

The house, a large white colonial, stands at the center of the dead end, where the blacktop blossoms into a wide circle, ideal for street hockey and bike riding. West Covington is a major thoroughfare through Elmsbrook, winding its way past strip malls and corporate parks before finally veering off into the residential area, where at the last rotary, it becomes Knob\x{2019}s End.

Boner comes by with three volunteers from the Hebrew Burial Society to deliver the mourning supplies. They rearrange furniture and set things up with a hushed military precision, after which Boner gathers the four Foxman siblings in the living room. Five low folding chairs with thick wooden frames and faded vinyl upholstery are lined up in front of the fireplace. The mirror above the mantel has been clouded over with some kind of soapy white spray. The furniture has all been pushed to the perimeter of the room, and thirty or so white plastic catering chairs have been unfolded and placed in three rows facing the five low chairs. There are two silver collection plates placed on the piano. People paying their respects to the family can make dollar contributions to the burial society or to a local children\x{2019}s cancer society. A few lonely bills have been placed on each plate like tips. In the front hall, a thick candle formed in a tall glass is lit and placed on the table, next to Wendy\x{2019}s baby monitor. This is the shiva candle, and there is enough wax in the glass for the candle to burn for seven days.",

            "The one tattered remnant of Jewish observance that my parents had maintained was having the family stay over for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Every year, as summer bled into fall, the call would come, more a summons than an invitation, and we would all descend upon Knob\x{2019}s End, to argue over sleeping arrangements, grudgingly attend services at Temple Israel, and share an overwrought holiday meal during which, tradition had it, at least one person would theatrically storm out of the house in a huff. Usually, it would be Alice or Wendy, although a few years ago it was memorably Jen, after my father, already well into his peach schnapps, told her, apropos of nothing in particular, that our dead son wouldn\x{2019}t have been technically Jewish since she was a gentile. This was just a few months after she\x{2019}d delivered our dead baby, and so no one blamed her for hurling her plate at him as she stormed out. \x{201c}What got into her?\x{201d} he said. On the plus side, she insisted we go home immediately, which got me out of having to attend the interminable services at Temple Israel the following morning, where Cantor Rothman\x{2019}s slow, operatic tenor makes you want to prostrate yourself on the spot and accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.

We should have a handout at the door to speed things along, a brief summary of Dad\x{2019}s illness and all that transpired in the final days, maybe even a photocopy of his charts and a four-color printout of his last CAT scan, because that seems to be what all of his and Mom\x{2019}s peers want to talk about.

There was always something of a little girl about Penny Moore, with her pale skin and wide eyes, and that hasn\x{2019}t changed in the years since I last saw her. When she sees me, her face lights up, and she leaps athletically over the counter to hug me. She\x{2019}s dressed in jeans and a button-down oxford, her long dark hair tied loosely behind her head. From twenty feet away, she could pass for a college student. Only as she draws closer do you see the slightly looser flesh beneath her eyes, the soft commas at the corners of her mouth.",

I am having sex with Jen. She bucks and writhes under me, her hips rising up hard against mine. Her nails slice my back; her fingers grab my ass and then slide down my thigh to where my leg ends at midcalf in a hard, creased stump. But it\x{2019}s not me, it\x{2019}s Wade lying on top of Jen, and I\x{2019}m sitting on the reading chair by the window, watching them go at it while I pull at the worn straps of my prosthesis, trying to strap it on so that I can get the hell out of there. And now it\x{2019}s me again, lying in the smooth delta of Jen\x{2019}s opened thighs, but it\x{2019}s no longer Jen, it\x{2019}s Penny Moore, and I\x{2019}ve got both of my legs again, and Penny\x{2019}s got her legs wrapped around me, and she\x{2019}s biting down on my earlobe as she moans, and it\x{2019}s actually feeling pretty good. Then, from behind me, a low guttural growl, and when I turn, I see the rottweiler, with the tattered threads of Paul\x{2019}s red T-shirt still hanging from his teeth, alongside a thick chain of white drool. And when I turn back to Penny, she\x{2019}s Chelsea, Phillip\x{2019}s old girlfriend, and I\x{2019}ve got one leg again, and the dog is crouching, getting ready to attack, and no matter how much I try to pull out of Chelsea, she just keeps rocking her hips and licking her lips. And then the rottweiler is upon us, and I can smell his feral scent and feel the crush of his jaws on the back of my neck, and I\x{2019}m sandwiched between Phillip\x{2019}s old girlfriend and a vicious rottweiler and I\x{2019}ve got one and a half legs and this is not any way to die.

The pastries and bagels continue to arrive every day, courtesy of my parents\x{2019} friends and set out by Linda, who quietly lets herself in every morning to see to things. Horry\x{2019}s here too this morning, sipping thoughtfully at his coffee, sneaking glances at Wendy over the rim of his mug. His T-shirt says, YOU\x{2019}RE UGLY, BUT YOU INTRIGUE ME.

            "You can see your older sister, barefoot in boxer shorts and a T-shirt, walking hurriedly up the block from the direction of the Callens\x{2019}, tying her long, mussed hair back as she goes, and wonder what she might be doing coming from there at this hour. And then, just minutes after she\x{2019}s let herself in below, you can observe Linda Callen leaving your childhood home to quietly make her way down the block back to her house. It would probably help to see Linda\x{2019}s expression, but her back is to you, so you can only guess at it. You can ponder these two women, who miss each other by a matter of minutes, walking exactly opposite routes as quietly as the dew now dropping in a mist on the grass and on your face, and you can hazard any number of guesses as to what business they might be tending to in the soft focus of these hushed morning hours when the day is taking its first tentative breaths. You can sit up here, feeling above it all while knowing you\x{2019}re not, coming to the lonely conclusion that the only thing you can ever really know about anyone is that you don\x{2019}t know anything about them at all.

I STEP OUT of the shower into pitch darkness. By now this has become routine. Wrapped in my towel, I walk across the basement to the circuit breaker. But this time, when I flip the switch, there is a crackle of electricity, a flash of blue light, and I am blown out of my towel and backward across the room, where I land flat on my back, poised on the precipice of unconsciousness. My body tingles with electricity, and I can feel every molecule in me, thrumming in harmony. I close my eyes and . . .",

WENDY AND BARRY are standing on the front walk, having an argument. Wendy gesticulates wildly while Barry stands there absorbing it, swatting away gnats as he waits her out. I wonder, as I often do, why they stay together, what it is they offer each other that keeps them locked in this bloodless stalemate.

SERENA STOPS CRYING the instant I pick her up. Her head is bald like an old man\x{2019}s, with just a ring of dark hair around the perimeter. She feels almost weightless against my chest in her little pink pajamas. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s okay,\x{201d} I say softly, and make other idiotic sounds like you do when you\x{2019}re holding a baby. Her tiny fingers find my chin and she latches on with a surprisingly strong grip, like my chin will save her life, like my chin is exactly what she was crying out for. I sit down on the bed, cradling her little head against my shoulder, inhaling her sweet baby scent. Someday she\x{2019}ll get older, and the world will start having its way with her. She\x{2019}ll throw temper tantrums, she\x{2019}ll need speech therapy, she\x{2019}ll grow breasts and have pimples, she\x{2019}ll fight with her parents, she\x{2019}ll worry about her weight, she\x{2019}ll put out, she\x{2019}ll have her heart broken, she\x{2019}ll be happy, she\x{2019}ll be lonely, she\x{2019}ll be complicated, she\x{2019}ll be confused, she\x{2019}ll be depressed, she\x{2019}ll fall in love and get married, and she\x{2019}ll have a baby of her own.

I lie back on the bed as she sleeps on my chest, listening to her tiny little snores, admiring the soft nub of her unformed nose, the sucking blister on her upturned lip. After a few minutes, when her breathing becomes almost imperceptible, I gently lay her down in the crib and head back downstairs. I crawl under my covers and drift off to sleep, still feeling the warm spot where she lay on my chest.",

Dad is bent over me, fixing my wooden leg with a socket wrench. I\x{2019}m on a chair and he\x{2019}s on his knees in front of me, turning the wrench and humming Simon and Garfunkel. I\x{2019}d rather be a hammer than a nail. Yes I would. I can see through his curly, gray hair to where it\x{2019}s thinning at his pink scalp, can smell the grease on him, can smell the detergent coming off his favorite blue work shirt. The socket wrench clicks noisily as it spins, and I can see the long muscles in his forearms flex and move as he turns it. He has spent his life working with tools, and they fit naturally into his hands. I\x{2019}m staring down at him, knowing that I can\x{2019}t tell him that he\x{2019}s dead, that if I do he\x{2019}ll disappear. I want him to look up at me, want to see his face, but he is focused on the leg and he doesn\x{2019}t look up. \x{201c}Almost there,\x{201d} he says. Then he puts down the socket wrench and grabs on to my knee with both hands. \x{201c}Here we go,\x{201d} he says. He pulls on the prosthesis, which slides off my knee and splits down the middle, and his hands come away with one half of it in each, and there is my real leg again, hairless and pink, but whole and unharmed. Then he looks up at me and smiles widely, like he might have smiled at me when I was a little boy, like he never did once I was older, a warm and loving smile, uncomplicated by my own encroaching manhood, and the love surging between us is electric and palpable. When I wake up I squeeze my eyes shut, trying to escape the dim silence of the basement to find him again, but there\x{2019}s only darkness and the sad, steady whisper of the central air handler behind the wall, telling its mechanical secrets in the dark.",

In high school, if you can find a girl who will kiss you and maybe let you touch her breasts and a guy who likes the same movies as you, your world is pretty much complete. Now Greg is fat and married and his eyes bulge in their sockets, threatening to pop out and shoot across the room. Triplets, he tells me. A goiter. He is unshaven and tired and he heard an old friend was sitting shiva in the neighborhood and made it his business to come.

PHILLIP RETURNS WITH eight shot glasses jammed between every finger of both hands, another of his worthless skills. Somehow we do them all. The night takes on a kind of kaleidoscopic translucence, and I lose my sense of time and, occasionally, balance. When I come back from a trip to the bathroom, we\x{2019}ve been joined by Phillip\x{2019}s old girlfriend, Chelsea. \x{201c}Look who I bumped into,\x{201d} Phillip says. Chelsea is dressed for the hunt in a short denim skirt and a tank top that grants a generous view of her lightly freckled cleavage as she leans forward to kiss my cheek. \x{201c}Fancy running into you guys here,\x{201d} she says, in case I haven\x{2019}t properly registered the complete randomness of this encounter from Phillip\x{2019}s remark. Chelsea\x{2019}s fingers dance up Phillip\x{2019}s arms like he\x{2019}s an instrument she\x{2019}s playing. I try to catch his eye, but he looks away every time. I want to tell him that he can\x{2019}t behave like this on my watch, but the shots have warmed my blood and toasted my veins, and someone has turned up the music, and to be heard I\x{2019}d have to put my mouth close to his ear, like Chelsea is doing right now.",

Blow jobs are administered in throbbing cars in the darkest corners of abandoned parking lots.

I look like a corpse pulled from the river a week after the suicide. It\x{2019}s time for a gut check. I mean that literally. I pull off my shirt, which is caked with just enough blood and vomit to represent a much wilder night than the one I\x{2019}ve had, and step back to study my torso.

He flashes a toothless grin and tells me he can see my balls. Over the bowed heads of faceless visitors I see Penny, in the back, looking strangely at me, and it makes me feel sad and embarrassed. And then Jen arrives, looking nine months pregnant, full-faced and radiant. I cannot let her see me like this. People greet her warmly, remark on her belly, touch it with casual reverence. She moves across the back of the room and then, just in front of her, I see him. He\x{2019}s seated in the back row, cradling a baby in the crook of his arm. He looks like he did when I was much younger, large and broad, with thick forearms and a barrel chest. Our eyes meet and he winks at me, then gets up to leave. Wait! Dad! But he can\x{2019}t hear me. He\x{2019}s heading to the door, the baby pressed to his shoulder, chewing on the seam of his shirt. I jump up to follow him, my nakedness forgotten, but only once I try to walk do I realize that I\x{2019}ve only got one leg, and I\x{2019}m not wearing my prosthesis.

Boner comes over to officially end the shiva. His left temple is still fairly swollen where Paul\x{2019}s pitch hit him, and he doesn\x{2019}t look terribly happy to be seeing any of us again. In the week we\x{2019}ve been here, we\x{2019}ve trashed his temple, resurrected his embarrassing nickname, and inflicted bodily harm. He asks all of the immediate mourners to sit down in our low chairs one last time. Once he has us all seated, he sits down on one of the folding chairs and speaks as if he\x{2019}s reading from a script.",

            "As far as rapprochements go, it\x{2019}s awkward and vague, but the advantage to being as emotionally inarticulate as we are is that it will do the trick. So we walk on, lighter than when we left, the staccato click of Mom\x{2019}s stiletto heels beating out a Morse code on the pavement as she leads us back home.

MOM CRIES WHEN she kisses Wendy good-bye. She can be so over the top as a matter of routine that when normal emotions come into play, it almost feels unreal. But we are her children, and we\x{2019}re all leaving her again. I kiss my two nephews good-bye and strap them into their car seats. \x{201c}You guys have fun on the plane. Be good.\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}You\x{2019}re a wuss, Judd. But I love you. I\x{2019}ll come in when you have the baby.\x{201d} She kisses me brusquely and then moves on to Phillip, then Paul and Alice, and then hoists up Serena, sleeping in her little car seat, and climbs into the back of the van. As the van drives down Knob\x{2019}s End, I see Horry standing on his porch, raising one still hand in farewell. The van lurches to a stop in front of his house, and Horry comes down the stairs. The windows are tinted and don\x{2019}t open. Horry puts his hand on the glass, peering intently in. I can\x{2019}t see inside the van, but I imagine Wendy placing her hand on the glass, lining her fingers up with his for a long moment, before leaning back and telling the van driver to floor it, because she has a flight to catch.

IN THE TOP drawer of my father\x{2019}s ancient mahogany dresser is a clutter of mementos. An expired passport; his high school ring; a monogrammed Swiss Army knife; a worn-out wallet; some loose cuff links; the old Tag Heuer watch he always meant to get fixed; a stack of our creased report cards wrapped in rubber bands; assorted souvenir key chains; an expensive-looking fountain pen; a gold butane lighter\x{2014}also monogrammed; an assortment of loose screws, bolts, and plastic wire connectors; a wire stripper; and, in a small silver frame, a black-and-white nude portrait of my mother in all her young glory, before kids and breast implants would change the topography of her body. She is slim and fresh-faced and there\x{2019}s something awkward in her pose, like she hasn\x{2019}t fully grown into herself yet. I can tell from her smile that it was my father behind the camera. The frame gleams without a hint of tarnish. Dad took care of this picture.",

            "I\x{2019}ll leave the Swiss Army knife for Paul and the lighter for Phillip. I slip my Rolex off of my wrist and into my pocket, and I pick up Dad\x{2019}s old Tag Heuer. When I was a kid I would hold on to his wrist and turn the diving bezel, enjoying the way it clicked around the face of the watch. I give the bezel a few turns. The clicks feel different without his wrist anchoring the watch. I flip it over and see that the back of the case is engraved. YOU FOUND ME. My mother\x{2019}s words, her naked love cut into steel. It\x{2019}s hard to imagine her ever having felt lost, but it\x{2019}s impossible to know the people your parents were before they were your parents. They really did have something, though, my parents. I don\x{2019}t think I ever fully appreciated that until right now. At first the steel is cold against my wrist, but it warms quickly against my skin, like a living thing. I slide the drawer closed and sit on his side of the bed for a minute, looking down at the watch. My wrist isn\x{2019}t nearly as thick as his was, and I\x{2019}ll have to have some links removed from the band when I get the watch fixed. For now the hands are motionless on the white face\x{2014}the watch stopped working years ago\x{2014}but I don\x{2019}t have much of a schedule to keep to these days.

MOM, PHILLIP, PAUL, Alice, and Horry are at the table, eating a lavish brunch comprised of shiva leftovers. Phillip is telling a story that has them alternately gasping and laughing. He has many stories that can do that, and some of them might even be true. I watch them for a moment, unseen from the hallway, and then step quietly down the hall to the front door. For reasons I don\x{2019}t fully understand, being at the center of another tangle of good-bye hugs and well-wishes is more than I can handle right now. Alice will be weird, Paul awkward, Phillip exuberant, and Mom will cry, which will make me cry, and I have cried enough.",

            "Outside, the sun lights up the red leaves of the dogwoods, casting the yard in soft amber hues. Across the street, two gardeners with noisy leaf blowers send up a twister of multicolored leaves swirling off the lawn, blowing them in a slow, graceful procession to the curb. A cat suns itself in a picture window. A woman jogs by pushing a baby in a running stroller. It\x{2019}s amazing how harmless the world can sometimes seem.

I SIT IDLING in a gas station just before the interstate junction, drawing maps in my head. I can be at the skating rink in ten minutes. I can be back in Kingston in ninety. According to the GPS, I can be in Maine in <<seven hours and seven minutes|14>>. My car doesn\x{2019}t have GPS, but Phillip\x{2019}s Porsche does, and that\x{2019}s what I\x{2019}m driving. I left him a note with the keys to my car. This morning, on a hunch, I counted the money in my bag and found it light two grand, not one, so I figure a little collateral is in order.",
