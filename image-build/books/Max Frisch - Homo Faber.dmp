Since it was night, I immediately prepared to go to sleep. We spent another forty minutes waiting on the runway with snow in front of the searchlights, powdery snow whirling over the runway, and what made me tense and anxious, so that I couldn\x{2019}t get off to sleep straight away, was not the newspaper brought around by our air hostess, FIRST PICTURES OF WORLD\x{2019}S GREATEST AIR CRASH IN NEVADA, a piece of news I had already seen at <<midday|13>>, but simply and solely the vibration in this stationary plane with its engines running \x{2013} and also the young German next to me, who immediately caught my attention, I don\x{2019}t know why, he caught my attention the moment he took off his overcoat, when he sat down and pulled at his trouser creases, when he did nothing at all, but simply waited for the take-off like the rest of us, merely sat in his seat, a fair-haired fellow with pink skin who at once introduced himself, before we had even fastened our safety belts.

I\x{2019}m not cynical. I\x{2019}m merely realistic, which is something women can\x{2019}t stand. I\x{2019}m not a monster, as Ivy said, and I have nothing against marriage in principle; as a rule the women themselves considered I wasn\x{2019}t suited to it. I can\x{2019}t have feelings all the time. Being alone is the only possible condition for me, since I don\x{2019}t want to make a woman unhappy, and women have a tendency to become unhappy. Being alone isn\x{2019}t always fun, you can\x{2019}t always be in form.

As to my fluctuating spirits, I pay no attention to them. Sometimes you feel low, but you pick up again. Fatigue phenomena! As in steel. Feelings, I have observed, are fatigue phenomena, that\x{2019}s all, at any rate in my case. You get run down. Then writing letters doesn\x{2019}t help you to feel less lonely either. It doesn\x{2019}t make any difference; afterwards you still hear your own footsteps in the empty flat. The radio announcers boosting dog food, baking powder or what have you, and then suddenly falling silent after wishing you good-bye \x{2018}till tomorrow morning at <<6 o\x{2019}clock|6>>\x{2019}.

Then gin, although I don\x{2019}t like gin on its own, in the background voices from the street, cars hooting or the rumble of the underground trains, every now and then the roar of an aeroplane, sounds like that. Sometimes I just fall asleep, the newspaper on my lap and my cigarette on the carpet. I pull myself together. What for? Somewhere there is a late broadcast with symphonies, which I switch off. What else? Then I just stand there with gin, which I don\x{2019}t like, in my glass, drinking; I stand still so as not to hear steps in my flat, steps that are after all only my own.

I spoke to her, as people do speak to one another on a ship like that; I didn\x{2019}t run after the girl. I didn\x{2019}t delude her in any way, on the contrary, I spoke to her more openly than I normally do, about my bachelorhood for example. I made her an offer of marriage without being in love, and we knew at once it was stupid and we said good-bye. Why did I look for her in Paris? We went together to the Op\x{e9}ra and afterwards we had an ice, then, without keeping her any longer, I drove her to her cheap hotel in Saint-Germain, I offered to let her hitchhike with me, since I had William\x{2019}s Citro\x{eb}n, and at Avignon, where we spent our first night, we naturally stayed at the same hotel (anything else would have suggested an intention which I didn\x{2019}t have at all), but not even on the same floor; I never thought for a moment it would come to that. I remember exactly what happened. It was the night (May 13th) of the eclipse of the moon that took us by surprise; I hadn\x{2019}t read a newspaper, and we weren\x{2019}t ready for it. I said: \x{2018}What\x{2019}s wrong with the moon?\x{2019} We were sitting outdoors and it was <<about ten o\x{2019}clock|6>>, time to turn in, because we planned to leave early next morning. The mere fact that three heavenly bodies, the sun, the earth and the moon, occasionally lie in a straight line, which necessarily produces an eclipse of the moon, upset my equilibrium, as though I didn\x{2019}t know exactly what a lunar eclipse was. As soon as I saw the round shadow of the earth on the full moon I paid for our coffee, and we walked arm in arm up to the terrace above the Rh\x{f4}ne, where we spent a whole hour, still arm in arm, standing in the night watching this perfectly intelligible phenomenon. I explained to the girl how it was that the moon, although totally covered by the earth\x{2019}s shadow, nevertheless emitted so much light that we could clearly see it, unlike the new moon, more clearly than usual in fact \x{2013} not as the usual luminous disc, but definitely as a sphere, a ball, a body, an orb, an enormous mass in the empty cosmos, orange in colour. I can\x{2019}t remember all the things I said during that hour. But I do remember that the girl felt for the first time that I took us both seriously and kissed me as never before. And yet to look at it was rather oppressive, an enormous mass drifting, or hurtling, through space, which brought to mind the objectively quite correct idea that we on earth were also drifting, or hurtling, through the darkness. I spoke about death and life, I believe, in quite general terms, and we were both excited because we had never seen such a clear eclipse of the moon before, even I hadn\x{2019}t, and for the first time I had the bewildering impression that the girl, whom I had hitherto taken for a child, was in love with me. Anyhow it was the girl who that night, after we stood outside until we were shivering, came into my room\x{2026}",

She was bleeding only slightly. Of course I immediately sucked out the wound, as prescribed, and I knew that a ligature should be applied between the wound and the heart. But how? The bite was above the left breast. I knew that the wound should be immediately excised or cauterized. I shouted for help, but I was already out of breath before I reached the road with the victim in my arms, after trudging through the sand; I was seized with despair when I saw the Ford drive past; I shouted as loud as I could; but the Ford drove past.

It was a rickety cart with crooked, wobbly wheels, a mile was an eternity; I sat facing the way we had come. But there was no sign of a car. I couldn\x{2019}t understand what the Greek was saying, nor why he stopped by a well; he tied the donkey up and signed to me to wait. I begged him to go on and not lose time; I didn\x{2019}t know what he had in mind when he left me alone in the gravel cart, alone with the victim, who needed serum. I sucked the wound out again. He had obviously gone to the huts to fetch help. I didn\x{2019}t know what help he imagined he could get, herbs or superstition or something. He whistled, then he walked on, because there was no reply from the huts. I waited a few minutes, then, without stopping to think, I ran on with the victim in my arms, until I was out of breath again and exhausted, I laid her down on the verge of the road, because there was just no sense in walking any farther; I couldn\x{2019}t carry her to Athens. Either a motor vehicle would come and pick us up, or it wouldn\x{2019}t come. When I sucked out the little wound on her breast again, I saw that Sabeth was slowly regaining consciousness: her eyes were wide open, but sightless, she only complained of thirst, her pulse was very slow, then she vomited with an outbreak of sweating. Now I could see the bluish-red swelling round her wound. I ran for water. All around there was nothing but gorse, thistles, olives on waterless land, not a single human being, only a few goats in the shade. I shouted and yelled in vain \x{2013} it was <<midday|13>>, a deathly silence; I kneeled down beside Sabeth; she wasn\x{2019}t unconscious, only very drowsy, as though paralysed. Fortunately I caught sight of the lorry in time to run out into the road; it pulled up \x{2013} a lorry with a bundle of long iron pipes. Its destination was not Athens, but Megara, nevertheless it was going in the right direction. I sat beside the driver, the victim in my arms. The long pipes kept clattering and the pace was murderous \x{2013} less than twenty miles an hour on the straight! I had left my jacket by the sea and my money in my jacket. When he stopped in Megara I gave the driver, who also only spoke Greek, my Omega watch to drive straight on without unloading his pipes. We lost another quarter of an hour at Eleusis, where he had to stop for petrol. I shall never forget this run. I don\x{2019}t know whether he was afraid I should demand my Omega watch back if I transferred to a faster vehicle or what; but twice he prevented me from switching over. Once it was a bus, a Pullman, once a limousine, which pulled up when I signalled; my driver spoke to them in Greek, and they drove on. He insisted on being the one to save us, yet he was a wretched driver. On the hill leading to Daphni he almost came to a standstill. Sabeth was asleep, and I didn\x{2019}t know whether she would ever open her eyes again. At last we reached the suburbs of Athens, but we were moving more and more slowly; there were traffic lights and the usual traffic jams, and our lorry with the long pipes projecting at the back was less manoeuvrable than the rest, who didn\x{2019}t need serum; it was a horrible town, a chaos of tramcars and donkey carts, and of course our driver didn\x{2019}t know where to find a hospital, he had to ask, and I began to think he would never get to it; I closed my eyes or looked at Sabeth, who was breathing very slowly. (All the hospitals were situated at the other end of Athens.) Our driver, who came from the country, didn\x{2019}t even know the names of the streets people told him, all I could catch was \x{2018}Leofores, Leofores\x{2019}; I tried to help, but I couldn\x{2019}t even read. We should never have found it if it hadn\x{2019}t been for the little lad who jumped on our running-board and showed us the way.",

            "Twenty-four hours ago (it seemed to me like a memory from my youth!) Sabeth and I were still sitting at Acro-Corinthus waiting for the sunrise. I shall never forget it. We had come from Patras and got out at Corinth to see the seven pillars of a temple, then we had supper at a nearby guest house. Apart from this, Corinth is little more than a hamlet. By the time we discovered there were no rooms free it was already getting dark; Sabeth thought it a wonderful idea of mine just to wander on into the night and sleep under a fig tree. Actually I had only meant it as a joke, but since Sabeth thought it a wonderful idea we really set off across country in search of a fig tree. Then we heard the barking of sheep dogs, uproar all around us, the flocks in the night; there must have been quite a number of the beasts, to judge by their yapping, and in the heights to which they drove us there were no fig trees, but only thistles and wind. Sleep was out of the question. I never thought night in Greece would be so cold, a night in June, downright wet. And on top of that we had no idea where it would take us, a bridle path leading upwards between rocks, stony, dusty, and hence as white as gypsum in the moonlight. Sabeth thought it like snow. We both agreed it was like yogurt! And above us the black rocks. Like coal, I thought. But again Sabeth compared them to something else; and so we chatted as we followed the path that led higher and higher. We heard the whinny of a donkey in the night. Like someone learning to play the \x{2019}cello, thought Sabeth. It reminded me of unoiled brakes. Apart from this there was a deathly hush; the dogs had fallen silent at last, now that they could no longer hear our footsteps. We saw the white huts of Corinth \x{2013} as though somebody had emptied a bowl of lump sugar. I thought of something else, just to go on with the game. Then we came to a black cypress. Like an exclamation mark, thought Sabeth. I contradicted: exclamation marks have the pointed end at the bottom, not at the top. We roamed all night long. Without meeting a single human being. Once we were frightened by the tinkling of a goat, then silence returned to the slopes that smelt of peppermint, a silence accompanied by beating hearts and thirst, nothing but wind in the dry grass \x{2013} like tearing silk, thought Sabeth. I had to think hard, and very often nothing occurred to me, than it was a point for Sabeth, according to the rules of the game. Sabeth almost always thought of something. The towers and crenellations of a medieval bastion \x{2013} like the scenery at the Op\x{e9}ra! We passed through doorway after doorway, nowhere any sound of water, we heard our footsteps echoing against the Turkish walls, otherwise silence the moment we stood still. Our shadows cast by the moon \x{2013} like paper cutouts, thought Sabeth. We always played to twenty-one points, as in ping-pong, then we began a new game, until suddenly, while it was still the middle of the night, we were standing on the mountain top. Our comet was no longer visible. In the distance lay the sea \x{2013} like a sheet of aluminium, I said; Sabeth said it was cold, but nevertheless a wonderful idea not to spend the night in a hotel for a change. It was her first night out of doors. As we waited for the sunrise, Sabeth trembled in my arms. It is coldest just before sunrise. Then we smoked our last cigarette together; we didn\x{2019}t say a word about the coming day, which for Sabeth meant the return home. The first light of dawn appeared <<around five o\x{2019}clock|6>> \x{2013} like porcelain. It grew brighter every minute, the sea and the sky, not the earth; we could see where Athens must lie, the black islands in the light bays, water and land were parted, a few small morning clouds hung overhead \x{2013} like tassels sprinkled with pink powder, thought Sabeth; I couldn\x{2019}t think of anything and lost another point. <<Nineteen to nine|10a:1>> in Sabeth\x{2019}s favour! The air at this time of the morning \x{2013} like autumn crocuses. I thought, like cellophane with nothing behind it. Then we found we could make out the surf on the seashore. like beer froth. Sabeth thought, like a ruche! I took back my beer froth and said, like fibreglass. But Sabeth didn\x{2019}t know what fibreglass was. Then came the first rays of the sun over the sea: like a sheaf, like spears, like cracks in a glass, like a monstrance, like photos of electron bombardment. But there was only one point for each round; it was no use producing half a dozen similes. Soon after this the sun rose, dazzling. Like metal spurting out of a furnace, I thought: Sabeth said nothing and lost a point\x{2026}. I shall never forget how she sat on that rock, her eyes closed, silent, letting the sun shine down on her. She was happy, she said, and I shall never forget the way the sea grew visibly darker, the Gulf of Corinth, and the other sea, the Gulf of Aigina, the red colour of the ploughed fields, the olives, like verdigris, their long morning shadows on the red earth, the first warmth and Sabeth, who embraced me, as though I had given her all this, the sea and the sun and everything, and I shall never forget how Sabeth sang!",

You had to wade out at least thirty yards before you could swim, and at the moment when I heard her shriek I was at least fifty yards from the shore. I could see that Sabeth had jumped to her feet. I shouted: \x{2018}What\x{2019}s the matter?\x{2019} She ran. After our sleepless night on Acro-Corinthus we had been sleeping in the sand, then I felt the desire to go into the water for a time in order to be alone while she slept. Before leaving I covered her shoulders with her underclothes, without waking her; for fear of sunburn. There was very little shadow here, an isolated pine tree; we made our bed in a hollow. Then, as was to be expected, the shadow, or rather the sun, moved, and I think that is what woke me up \x{2013} I was in a sweat and all around lay the <<noonday|13>> silence, I woke with a start, perhaps I had had some sort of dream or imagined I heard footsteps. But we were utterly alone. Perhaps I had heard the gravel cart, the shovelling of gravel; but I couldn\x{2019}t see anything. Sabeth was asleep and there was no cause for alarm, it was ordinary <<midday|13>>, hardly any surf, just the low swish of waves seeping away into the shingle, occasionally the faint rolling of shingle, almost like the tinkling of a bell, apart from this there was silence broken by an occasional bee. I wondered whether it was sensible to go swimming when I had palpitations. For a time I stood irresolute; Sabeth noticed there was no one lying beside her and stretched, without waking up. I sprinkled sand over the back of her neck, but she was asleep. Finally I went for a swim \x{2013} at the moment when Sabeth cried out I was at least fifty yards from the shore.",

Arrangements in case of death; all written evidence such as reports, letters, loose-leaf notebooks, are to be destroyed, none of it is true. To be alive: to be in the light. Driving donkeys around somewhere (like that old man in Corinth) \x{2013} that\x{2019}s all our job amounts to! The main thing is to stand up to the light, to joy (like our child) in the knowledge that I shall be extinguished in the light over gorse, asphalt and sea, to stand up to time, or rather to eternity in the instant. To be eternal means to have existed.",

Hanna too no longer has a home, she only told me today (yesterday!). She is now living in a boarding house. My cable from Caracas didn\x{2019}t even reach her. It must have been around this time that Hanna embarked on a ship. Her first idea was to spend a year on the islands, where she has Greek acquaintances from the time of the excavations (Delos); living is supposed to be very cheap in the islands. In Mykonos you can buy a house for two hundred dollars, thinks Hanna, in Amorgos for one hundred dollars. She is not working at the Institute any more, as I have been thinking all the time. Hanna tried to let her flat with the contents, but was unable to do so quickly enough; so she sold everything and gave away many of her books. She simply couldn\x{2019}t stand it in Athens any longer, she said. When she went aboard ship she thought of Paris, perhaps also of London; the future was altogether uncertain, for it\x{2019}s not so easy, thinks Hanna, to find a new job at her age, as a secretary, for instance, Hanna never thought for a moment of asking me for help; that\x{2019}s why she didn\x{2019}t write to me. Fundamentally, Hanna had only one aim: to get away from Greece. She left the city without saying good-bye to her friends here, apart from the director of the Institute, whom she greatly esteems. She spent the last hours before her departure out by the grave; she had to be on board by <<2 P.M.|5>> sailing at <<3 P.M.|5>>, but for some reason sailing was delayed almost an hour. All of a sudden (says Hanna) it struck her as senseless and she left the ship with her hand luggage. For the three big trunks in the hold, it was too late; the trunks sailed on to Naples and are expected back shortly. At first she lived in the Hotel Estia Emborron, but this was too expensive for her in the long run; she called back at the Institute, where her former assistant had meanwhile taken over her job with a three-year contract; this could not be altered now, because her successor had waited long enough and had no intention of voluntarily returning to his old job. The director was apparently very nice about it all, but the Institute hadn\x{2019}t the money to employ two people for one job. All they could give her was the prospect of occasional freelance work and recommendations abroad. But Hanna wasn\x{2019}t to stay in Athens. I don\x{2019}t know whether Hanna expected me here or whether she wanted to leave Athens so as not to see me again. It was pure chance that she received my cable from Rome in time; when it arrived, she just happened to have come to the empty flat to give the key to the caretaker. Hanna\x{2019}s present job consists in conducting visitors round the museum in the morning, the Acropolis in the afternoon and Sounion in the evening. In particular she conducts parties that do everything in one day, organized by Mediterranean travel agencies.",

I don\x{2019}t know why Joachim hanged himself; Hanna keeps asking me. How should I know? She keeps coming back to it, although I know less about Joachim than Hanna does. She says: \x{2018}When the child was there, she never reminded me of you, she was my child, mine alone.\x{2019} With reference to Joachim: \x{2018}I loved him just because he was not the father of my child, and during the first few years everything was so simple.\x{2019} Hanna thinks our child would never have been born if we hadn\x{2019}t parted when we did. Hanna is convinced of this. Hanna made up her mind before I even reached Baghdad, apparently; she wanted a child, the whole thing took her by surprise, and only when I had disappeared did she discover that she wanted a child (says Hanna) without a father, not our child, but her child. She was alone and happy to be pregnant, and when she went to Joachim to let herself be talked round, Hanna had already made up her mind to have the child; she didn\x{2019}t mind Joachim thinking he had led her to reach a crucial decision in her life, nor his falling in love with her, which soon afterwards led to marriage. My unfortunate remark in her flat earlier on, \x{2018}You\x{2019}re behaving like a hen,\x{2019} made a considerable impression on Hanna, because, as she confessed, Joachim once used exactly the same words, Joachim provided for the child without interfering in its upbringing; it wasn\x{2019}t his child, nor mine either, it was a fatherless child, hers and hers alone, a child that did not concern any man, which suited Joachim all right, at least during the earliest years, as long as it was a baby, which in any case belongs to the mother, and Joachim welcomed it because it made Hanna happy. My name was never mentioned, says Hanna. Joachim had no reason to feel jealous, and he wasn\x{2019}t jealous so far as I was concerned; he saw that I wasn\x{2019}t the father in the eyes of the world, which didn\x{2019}t know anything about it, and most certainly not in the eyes of Hanna, who simply forgot me (as Hanna repeatedly assures me) without any reproach. Things became more difficult between Joachim and Hanna when questions of upbringing arose more frequently: less because of differences of opinion, which were few, than because Joachim simply couldn\x{2019}t bear the way Hanna considered herself, in everything related to children, the one and only authority. Hanna admitted that Joachim was easy to get on with, allergic only in this one respect.",
