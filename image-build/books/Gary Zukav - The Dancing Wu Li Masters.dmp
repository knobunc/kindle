            "Between Planck\x{2019}s discovery of the quantum (1900) and Bohr\x{2019}s analysis of the hydrogen spectrum (1913), a brilliant physicist burst upon the scene with a force seldom exerted by an individual. His name was Albert Einstein. In one year (1905), at <<twenty-six|9:0>>, Einstein published five significant papers. Three of them were pivotal in the development of physics, and, to a large extent, in the development of the West. The first of these three papers described the quantum nature of light. It won him a Nobel Prize in 1921. The second paper described molecular motion. The third paper set forth the special theory of relativity, which we will study later.*",

If we try to designate \x{201c}now\x{201d} by the occurrence of two simultaneous events (like my arrival at the doctor\x{2019}s office and my watch indicating <<3 o\x{2019}clock|6>>), we find that an observer in another frame of reference sees one of our events happening before the other.

            'At velocities above 99 percent of the speed of light particle masses increase dramatically. When the former electron accelerator at Cambridge, Massachusetts, was in operation, it received electrons from a small feeder accelerator. The electrons from the feeder accelerator were fed into the main accelerator at .99986 the velocity of light. The main accelerator then increased the velocity of these electrons to .999999996 the speed of light. This increase in velocity may look significant, but actually it is negligible. The difference between the initial velocity of the accelerated electrons and the final velocity of the accelerated electrons is the same as the difference in velocity between one automobile that can make a given trip in two hours and a faster automobile that can make the same trip in <<one hour fifty-nine minutes|14>> and fifty-nine seconds.7',

If our hypothetical top wants to spin slower than 100 revolutions per minute, it must jump all the way down to the next slower speed of 90 revolutions per minute. This is analogous to the situation with subatomic particles except that (1) particular types of particles forever spin at the same speed, and (2) the spin of subatomic articles is calculated in terms of angular momentum.',

This situation is, of course, a violation of the conservation law of mass-energy. The conservation law of mass-energy says, in effect, that we cannot get something for nothing. According to quantum field theory, however, we do get something for nothing, but only for about one thousand trillionth (<<10-15|5a:0>>) of a second. \x{2020} The reason that this can happen, according to the theory, is the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle.",

            'However, if we push the free proton to within about one ten-trillionth (<<10-13|5a:0>>) of a centimeter of the nucleus, it suddenly is sucked into the nucleus with a force one hundred times more powerful than the repulsive electromagnetic force. One ten-trillionth of a centimeter is about the size of the proton itself. In other words, the proton is relatively unaffected by the strong force, even at a distance only slightly greater than its own magnitude. Closer than that, however, and it is completely overpowered by the strong force.',

            'The weak force is the least known of the four forces. Its existence was inferred from the times required by certain subatomic interactions. The strong force is so short-range and powerful that strong-force interactions happen very, very fast, in about .00000000000000000000001 (<<10-23|5a:0>>) seconds. However, physicists discovered that a certain other type of particle interaction which they knew involved neither the electromagnetic nor the gravitational forces, required a much longer time, about .0000000001 (<<10-10|5a:0>>) seconds. They therefore deduced from this strange phenomenon that there must exist a fourth type of force. Since this new fourth force was known to be weaker than the electromagnetic force, it was called the weak force.',

            "The range of the strong force, relative to the electromagnetic force, is limited because mesons, relative to photons, have so much mass. Remember that the policeman who enforces the conservation law of mass-energy is willing to turn his back if the violation is quick enough, but the more flagrant the violation, the more quickly it must happen. The momentary creation of a meson out of nothing is a much more flagrant violation of the conservation law of mass-energy than the momentary creation of a photon out of nothing. Therefore, the creation and re-absorption of a meson must happen more quickly to stay within the protection, so to speak, of the uncertainty relation between time and energy. Because the life span of a virtual meson is limited, its range also is limited. The rule of thumb governing this phenomenon is this: The stronger the force, the more massive is the mediating particle, and the shorter is its range. The range of the strong force is only about one ten-trillionth (<<10-13|5a:0>>) of a centimeter. Accordingly, the range of the electromagnetic force is much greater than the range of the strong force. In fact, the range of the electromagnetic force is infinite. This is because photons don\x{2019}t have any rest mass!",

The problem of black-body radiation led to Planck\x{2019}s discovery of the quantum of action.

The Michelson-Morley experiment foreshadowed Einstein\x{2019}s famous theories of relativity. By <<1927|9n:0>>, the foundations of the new physics, quantum mechanics and relativity, were in place.",
