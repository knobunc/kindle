If our hypothetical top wants to spin slower than 100 revolutions per minute, it must jump all the way down to the next slower speed of 90 revolutions per minute. This is analogous to the situation with subatomic particles except that (1) particular types of particles forever spin at the same speed, and (2) the spin of subatomic articles is calculated in terms of angular momentum.',

This situation is, of course, a violation of the conservation law of mass-energy. The conservation law of mass-energy says, in effect, that we cannot get something for nothing. According to quantum field theory, however, we do get something for nothing, but only for about one thousand trillionth (<<10-15|5a:0>>) of a second. \x{2020} The reason that this can happen, according to the theory, is the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle.",

One ten-trillionth of a centimeter is about the size of the proton itself. In other words, the proton is relatively unaffected by the strong force, even at a distance only slightly greater than its own magnitude. Closer than that, however, and it is completely overpowered by the strong force.',

            'The weak force is the least known of the four forces. Its existence was inferred from the times required by certain subatomic interactions. The strong force is so short-range and powerful that strong-force interactions happen very, very fast, in about .00000000000000000000001 (<<10-23|5a:0>>) seconds. However, physicists discovered that a certain other type of particle interaction which they knew involved neither the electromagnetic nor the gravitational forces, required a much longer time, about .0000000001 (<<10-10|5a:0>>) seconds. They therefore deduced from this strange phenomenon that there must exist a fourth type of force. Since this new fourth force was known to be weaker than the electromagnetic force, it was called the weak force.',

            "The range of the strong force, relative to the electromagnetic force, is limited because mesons, relative to photons, have so much mass. Remember that the policeman who enforces the conservation law of mass-energy is willing to turn his back if the violation is quick enough, but the more flagrant the violation, the more quickly it must happen. The momentary creation of a meson out of nothing is a much more flagrant violation of the conservation law of mass-energy than the momentary creation of a photon out of nothing. Therefore, the creation and re-absorption of a meson must happen more quickly to stay within the protection, so to speak, of the uncertainty relation between time and energy. Because the life span of a virtual meson is limited, its range also is limited. The rule of thumb governing this phenomenon is this: The stronger the force, the more massive is the mediating particle, and the shorter is its range. The range of the strong force is only about one ten-trillionth (<<10-13|5a:0>>) of a centimeter. Accordingly, the range of the electromagnetic force is much greater than the range of the strong force. In fact, the range of the electromagnetic force is infinite.
