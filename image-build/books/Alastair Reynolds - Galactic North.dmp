Even if the engines kept working as they were now, we\x{2019}d take far too long to reach relativistic speed, where time dilation  became appreciable. At <<twenty-five|9:0>> per cent of the speed of light, what would have been a twenty-year hop before became an eighty-year crawl now . . . and that was an eighty-year crawl in which almost all that time would be experienced aboard ship. Across that stretch of time, reefersleep was a lottery. Our caskets were designed to keep people frozen for five to ten years, not four-fifths of a century.",
