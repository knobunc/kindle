He was known usually as Dimitrios.\x{2019} He turned to the dossier again. \x{2018}Dimitrios Makropoulos. Born eighteen eighty-nine in Larissa, Greece. Found abandoned. Parents unknown. Mother believed Roumanian. Registered as Greek subject and adopted by Greek family. Criminal record with Greek authorities. Details unobtainable.\x{2019} He looked up at Latimer. That was before he came to our notice. We first heard of him at Izmir [Smyrna] in <<nineteen twenty-two|5k:0>>, a few days after our troops occupied the town. A deunme2 [Jew turned Moslem] named Sholem was found in his room with his throat cut. He was a moneylender and kept his money under the floorboards. These were ripped up and the money had been taken. There was much violence in Izmir at that time and little notice would have been taken by the military authorities. The thing might have been done by one of our soldiers. Then, another Jew, a relation of Sholem\x{2019}s, drew the attention of the military to a Negro named Dhris Mohammed, who had been spending money in the cafes and boasting that a Jew had lent him the money without interest. Inquiries were made and Dhris was arrested. His replies to the court-martial were unsatisfactory and he was condemned to death. Then he made a confession. He was a fig-packer, and he said that one of his fellow workmen, whom he called Dimitrios, had told him of Sholem\x{2019}s wealth hidden under the floorboards of his room. They had planned the robbery together and entered Sholem\x{2019}s room by night. It had been Dimitrios, he said, who had killed the Jew. He thought that Dimitrios, being registered as a Greek, had escaped and bought a passage on one of the refugee ships that waited at secret places along the coast.\x{2019}",

            "\x{2018}I will tell you. The first problem was to identify Dimitrios of Izmir with Dimitrios of Edirne [Adrianople]. Accordingly we revived the affair of Sholem, issued a warrant for the arrest of a Greek fig-packer named Dimitrios on a charge of murder and, with that excuse, asked foreign police authorities for assistance. We did not learn much, but what we did learn was sufficient. Dimitrios had been concerned with the attempted assassination of Stambulisky in Bulgaria which had preceded the Macedonian officers\x{2019} putsch in <<nineteen twenty-three|5k:0>>. The Sofia police knew very little but that he was known there to be a Greek from Izmir. A woman with whom he had associated in Sofia was questioned. She stated that she had a letter from him a short time before. He had given no address, but as she had had very urgent reasons for wishing to get in touch with him she had looked at the postmark. It was from Edirne. The Sofia police obtained a rough description of him that agreed with that given by the Negro in Izmir. The Greek police stated that he had had a criminal record prior to <<nineteen twenty-two|5k:0>> and gave those particulars of his origin. The warrant is probably still in existence; but we did not find Dimitrios with it.",

            "Colonel Haki began to look bored. \x{2018}Oh, yes. Dimitrios made a lot of money once I should think. Another unfinished story. About three years after the Belgrade affair, we heard of him again. Nothing to do with us, but the available information was added to the dossier as a routine matter.\x{2019} He referred to the dossier. \x{2018}In <<nineteen twenty-nine|5k:0>>, the League of Nations Advisory Committee on the illicit drug traffic received a report from the French Government concerning the seizure of a large quantity of heroin at the Swiss frontier. It was concealed in a mattress in a sleeping-car coming from Sofia. One of the car attendants was found to be responsible for the smuggling, but all he could or would tell the police was that the drug was to have been collected in Paris by a man who worked at the rail terminus. He did not know the man\x{2019}s name and had never spoken to him; but he described him. The man in question was later arrested. Questioned, he admitted the charge, but claimed he knew nothing of the destination of the drug. He received one consignment a month which was collected by a third man. The police set a trap for this third man and caught him, only to find that there was a fourth intermediary. They arrested six men in connection with that affair and only obtained one real clue. It was that the man at the head of this peddling organisation was a man known as Dimitrios. Through the medium of the Committee, the Bulgarian Government then revealed that they had found a clandestine heroin laboratory at Radomir and had seized two hundred and thirty kilos of heroin ready for delivery. The consignee\x{2019}s name was Dimitrios. During the next year the French succeeded in discovering one or two other large heroin consignments bound for Dimitrios. But they did not get very much nearer to Dimitrios himself. There were difficulties. The stuff never seemed to come in the same way twice and by the end of the year <<nineteen thirty|5k:0>>, all they had to show in the way of arrests were a number of smugglers and some insignificant peddlars. Judging by the amounts of heroin they did find, Dimitrios must have been making huge sums for himself. Then, quite suddenly, about a year after that, Dimitrios went out of the drug business. The first news the police had of this was an anonymous letter which gave the names of all the principal members of the gang, their life histories and details of how evidence against every one of them might be obtained. The French police had a theory at the time. They said that Dimitrios himself had become a heroin addict. Whether that is true or not, the fact is that by December, the gang was rounded up. One of them, a woman, was already wanted for fraud. Some of them threatened to kill Dimitrios when they were released from prison, but the most any of them could tell the police about him was that his surname was Makropoulos and that he had a flat in the seventeenth arrondissement. They never found the flat and they never found Dimitrios.\x{2019}",

By the following morning, the Greek army had broken and was in a headlong retreat towards Smyrna and the sea. In the days that followed, the retreat became a rout. Unable to destroy the Turkish army, the Greeks turned with frantic savagery to the business of destroying the Turkish population in the path of their flight. From Alashehr to Smyrna they burnt and slaughtered. Not a village was left standing. Amid the smouldering ruins the pursuing Turks found the bodies of the villagers. Assisted by the few half-crazed Anatolian peasants who had survived, they took their revenge on the Greeks they were able to overtake. To the bodies of the Turkish women and children were added the mutilated carcases of Greek stragglers. But the main Greek army had escaped by sea. Their lust for infidel blood still unsatisfied, the Turks swept on. On the ninth of September, they occupied Smyrna.',

He probably remembered the Hispano and the luxury of the house of Madame la Comtesse. She would perhaps be worried to hear that her friend made his money by selling heroin and Dimitrios might be ready to pay good money to save her that worry. But it was easier to think about Dimitrios and his money than it was to find him. For several months, after he was released from prison in <<nineteen thirty-two|5k:0>>, Visser looked for Dimitrios. The apartment in the Avenue de Wagram was no longer occupied. The house of Madame la Comtesse was shut up and the concierge said that she was in Biarritz. Visser went to Biarritz and found that she was staying with friends. Dimitrios was not with her. Visser returned to Paris. Then he had what I think was quite a good idea. He himself was pleased with it. Unfortunately for him, it came a little too late. He remembered one day that Dimitrios had been a drug-addict, and it occurred to him that Dimitrios might have done what many other wealthy addicts do when their addiction reaches an advanced stage. He might have entered a clinic to be cured.",

I began to investigate them one after the other; but when, at the fifth hotel, they refused, for some reason, to let me see the bills for <<nineteen thirty-two|5k:0>>, I abandoned the attempt. Instead, I went to an Italian friend of mine in one of the Ministries. He was able to use his influence on my behalf and, after a lot of chi-chi and expense, I was permitted to inspect the Ministry of Interior archives for <<nineteen thirty-two|5k:0>>. I found out the name Dimitrios was using, and I also found out what Visser had not found out - that Dimitrios had taken the course, which I myself took in <<nineteen thirty-two|5k:0>>, or purchasing the citizenship of a certain South American republic which is sympathetic in such matters if one\x{2019}s wallet is fat enough.
