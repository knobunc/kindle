            "Dan is going to a wedding. His nephew and niece are helping him to get ready. His niece puts his top hat on the chair. Crunch! goes the hat as Dan sits on it. He goes to buy a new hat, but they are all FAR TOO SMALL. This is the biggest in the shop, the assistant tells him. Dan tries it on. It\x{2019}s almost big enough he says, but when he tries to pull it down a bit, he rips the brim off and it comes down over his face. OH, NO! he says, looking over the brim. Outside the shop he has an idea, and points to something not shown in the picture. Ah! That\x{2019}s the very thing! he says, but first he has to clear the City Square so that no one will see what he is going to do. Round the corner, he bends over a water hydrant and blows. Water explodes out of the fountain in the square, drenching everybody, and they all have to go home, leaving the square deserted. Good, now I can get what I want, Dan says. In the next picture, Dan is trying on a big grey topper. He looks pleased and says, That\x{2019}s it! And it fits a treat. He attends the wedding, and at the Reception Hall he hands his hat to the cloakroom attendant. The attendant can\x{2019}t hold it and the hat goes Crunch! on his foot. Ooyah! goes the attendant. He tries to pick it up, saying, Help! What a hat! It\x{2019}s made of solid stone! The last picture shows where the hat came from: from the head of the statue in the City Square: WILLIAM SMITH, MAYOR OF CACTUSVILLE 1865\x{2013}86. SHOT AT <<HIGH NOON|13>> BY BLACK JAKE.",

For most of the game most of the boys had been as fixed as buttons on a pinball machine, sparking into life only when the nucleus of footballers amongs them had occasionally shuttled the ball into their defined areas: mere props to the play. Now they were all playing. Both teams playing as units, and positions were taken seriously. In possession they moved and called for the ball from spaces. Out of possession they marked and tackled hard to win it back. A move provoked a counter move, which in turn determined moves made by players in other segments of the pitch. The ball was a magnet, exerting the strongest pull on the players nearest to it, and still strong enough to activate the players farthest away.',
