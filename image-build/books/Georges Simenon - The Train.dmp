            "GEORGES SIMENON (1903\x{2013}1989) was born in Li\x{e8}ge, Belgium, the son of an accountant. His father\x{2019}s ill health forced him to quit school at <<16|9c:0>>, and he became a newspaperman, assigned to the crime beat. He published his first book, Au Point des arches, a year later, under his reporter\x{2019}s pen-name, G. Sim. In 1922 he moved to Paris and began to write novels at a furious pace, using at least a dozen pen-names, although he created his most famous character, Commissaire Maigret of the Paris Police, under his own name. Maigret would eventually star in 75 novels. His non-Maigret novels\x{2014}referred to as his roman durs (literally, \x{201c}hard novels\x{201d})\x{2014}were even more critically acclaimed, leading to speculation he would eventually win the Nobel. In the early thirties Simenon took up travel, living on a houseboat cruising the Belgian canal system, touring Africa and the Soviet Union, and living throughout the US and Canada. During the war years he moved to the French countryside, but was harassed by the Nazis who suspected his last name was Jewish. Nonetheless, after the war he was banned from publishing for five years for having sold film rights to German filmmakers. Married and divorced twice, Simenon was the father of four children, one of whom, his daughter Mari-Jo, committed suicide at age 25. (She would be the subject of his novel, The Disappearance of Odile.) It would darken Simenon\x{2019}s later years, but he never stopped writing. Estimates are that he wrote as many as 500 books by the time of his death of natural causes at age 86.",
