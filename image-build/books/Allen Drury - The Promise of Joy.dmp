In this process both actors and director must maintain the correct pace and the correct pitch, so that emotions in the scene that will come early in the finished picture will rise gradually into the emotions in a scene that will come later. All of this requires a constant control by the director, a carefully phased expenditure of effort and emphasis by the actors. It is one of the things that makes of each scene a fascinating study in technique, so that in two months there is never a day but has its own special challenge, its own excitement that carries the company forward through many long and grueling hours of dramatic episodes\x{2014}and what is perhaps even more wearing, the \x{201c}hurry up and wait\x{201d} aspects of it, as the technicians take anywhere from <<one hour to four|10>> to get a scene properly arranged and lighted.",
