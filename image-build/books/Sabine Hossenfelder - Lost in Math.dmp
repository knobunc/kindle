Extrapolated to higher energies, the strengths of the forces meet at <<three|9g>> different points (see Figure 8, top). If one adds supersymmetry, however, they meet at one point (up to uncertainty from the measurement of the low-energy values), which is called \x{201c}gauge-coupling unification\x{201d} (Figure 8, bottom). If there is fundamentally only one gauge symmetry, there is fundamentally also only one coupling constant, and hence the three different couplings eventually must converge.

At the same time, the share of part-time faculty increased from 24 percent to more than 40 percent. Surveys by the American Association of University Professors reveal that the lack of continuous support discourages long-term commitment and risk-taking when choosing research topics.21 The situation in Germany is similar.
