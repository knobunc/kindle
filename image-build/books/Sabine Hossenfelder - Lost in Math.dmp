            "To better see why this criterion is circular, think of a probability distribution on the interval from <<0|20b>> to <<1|20a>> that is peaked around some value with a width of, say, 10\x{2212}10. \x{201c}There,\x{201d} you exclaim, \x{201c}you have introduced a small number!

Extrapolated to higher energies, the strengths of the forces meet at <<three|9g>> different points (see Figure 8, top). If one adds supersymmetry, however, they meet at one point (up to uncertainty from the measurement of the low-energy values), which is called \x{201c}gauge-coupling unification\x{201d} (Figure 8, bottom). If there is fundamentally only one gauge symmetry, there is fundamentally also only one coupling constant, and hence the three different couplings eventually must converge. That susy makes the constants match at high energies has been one of the strongest motivations to pursue the theory. Is gauge coupling unification necessary? No. Is it pretty? It certainly is.",

With this duality, whatever happens during black hole formation and evaporation can alternatively be described by a gauge theory. In the gauge theory, however, we know that the process is reversible, and so the black hole evaporation must be reversible as well. This doesn\x{2019}t explain just how the information comes out of the black hole, but it demonstrates that in string theory the problem is absent. Better still, using this method, string theorists can count how many ways there are to make a black hole\x{2014}the black hole \x{201c}microstates\x{201d}\x{2014}and the result fits perfectly with Hawking\x{2019}s calculation of the temperature.",
