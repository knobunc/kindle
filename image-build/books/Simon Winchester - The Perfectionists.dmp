The boy had developed an infatuation with clocks, a topic which in the Japan of the day was a matter of exceptional complexity. For Japanese timekeeping was unique. Clockmakers had learned the basics of mechanical horology from visiting Jesuits, but these clerics threw their hands up in puzzlement at the fugitive nature of the local version of timekeeping. Hours in Old Japan were of varying lengths. Clocks\x{2019} bell strikes were, by Western standards, strangely disarranged: six peals at sunset, nine at <<midnight|13>>, eight and then seven in the moments before dawn. There were different periods of time, too, that depended on the seasons and that required at least two balance mechanisms within each clock, and several faces. Even more faces (as many as six) were needed once Western time began to infiltrate the systems of old, in the days when reformists wanted to be able to tell their hour at the same moment as old-timers required to know theirs. The young Hattori, an apprentice to a Ginza clockmaker from 1873 on, was thus pitched into a ferment of variant accuracies and clashing systems that would serve him in later life far better than, at the time, he could have imagined.",

Whitworth then incised 250 divisions on the turning wheel\x{2019}s circumference, which meant that the operator of the machine, by turning the wheel by just one division, could advance or retard the screw and its attached plane plate by 1/250 of 1/4,000 of an inch. In other words, by <<1|9:0>>/1,000,000 of an inch. And provided the ends of the item being measured are as plane as the plates on the micrometer, opening the gap by that 1/1,000,000 of an inch would make the difference between the item being held firmly, or falling, under the influence of gravity.

Then he stood on the brakes and began to spool up the engine. When it was whining satisfactorily and the plane was bouncing against the brakes, he took his feet off the pedals. The craft bounded forward and began to accelerate toward the watery sun. It was <<7:40 p.m.|2a>> Dusk was falling. Whittle watched, clenching his fists with anxiety.',

            "Inevitably, it was commerce that provided the spur for all this work\x{2014}although the jet engine makers who worked secretly for \x{201c}the dark side,\x{201d} creating technologies for bombers and stealth fighters and their like, made as-yet-unacknowledged contributions, too, and about which plane makers still cannot talk. The start of work on turbine blade efficiency began in the 1950s, just as soon as piston-engined aircraft began to be eased out of the world\x{2019}s main skyways, and as soon as jet engines, initially developed for military use, were being redesigned in ways that made economic sense for hauling passengers and freight over long distances at high speed. Aircraft such as the Viscount, the Comet, the Tupolev Tu-104, the Convair 880, the Caravelle, the Douglas DC-8, and, from <<1958|9c:0>>, the best known of all narrow-bodied jets, the Boeing 707, began to sweep the field. The engines with which they were equipped (the De Havilland Ghost; Pratt and Whitney\x{2019}s JT3C and JT3D; Rolls-Royce\x{2019}s Avon, Spey, and Conway; and for the two hundred Tupolev Tu-104s that Moscow built, the little-known Mikulin AM-3 turbojet) were all of their time state-of-the-art high-precision machines.",

Four further servicing missions have been up to it, as were scheduled long ago, each one tasked with breathing new life into what has become a beloved old silver workhorse, the greatest of NASA\x{2019}s great observatories. The longevity of the now almost venerable, if still no prettier, bird is greater than ever anticipated, and it is now expected to continue flying at least until <<2030|9c:0>>, maybe for a decade longer. It is by all accounts the most successful scientific experiment of modern times, maybe even of all times. And the images it has sent back, tens of thousands of them, have captivated all who see them. The eight-foot mirror, imperfect though it may be, has captured a vision of wonder and rapture to scientists and the lay alike, bringing the universe vividly to life.",

Not, of course, that this will inhibit the computer industry from creating some entirely new technology to take its place, as is clearly occurring right now.

The observers there may have been weary, but this being part of a vast network of participants in what is known as the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, others around the world more bright-eyed and bushy-tailed noticed it, too, at more propitious hours. Back in Hanford, Washington, it would have been <<03:51|2>>, the dead of night; but in Leibnitz, it was <<12:51|2>>; in Delhi, <<17:21|2>>; in Tokyo, <<20:51|2>>; and at Monash University, in Melbourne, <<22:51 in the late evening|2>>.',

            "* Once out of sight of land, ships\x{2019} crews have no means of knowing accurately their exact position. To determine their latitude, the distance north or south of the equator, is easy, requiring only the measurement of the altitude of the sun at <<midday|13>> or (in the Northern Hemisphere) the pole star at night. But determining longitude, the distance east or west around the world from the ship\x{2019}s home port, is much more difficult. Longitude meridians mark the time difference between places, as the planet turns through 360 degrees every twenty-four hours, so each hour is equivalent to a drawn meridian of 15 degrees of longitude. But the time difference, and thus the longitude, can be worked out only if the time back at the home port is known by the ship at sea (its own local time being comparatively easy to determine from the sun and the stars). And for any timekeeper (on board a ship rolling violently in storms, passing through areas of fierce heat and deep cold, and with the clock never once being allowed to stop) to maintain an accurate record of this time was, to early eighteenth-century navigators, deemed well-nigh impossible.",
