            'Those instruments had just produced some rather interesting results. At <<19 hours 35 minutes|14>> 47 seconds GMT, there had been a major quake in the general area of Rainbow Bay. That was a little surprising, for the area was an unusually stable one, even for the tranquil Moon. Father Ferraro set his computers to work pinpointing the focus of the disturbance, and also instructed them to search for any other anomalous instrument readings. He left them at this task while he went to lunch, and it was here that his colleagues told him about the missing Selene.',

The surface dust would not reach its maximum temperature until <<noon|13>>, still seven days away.
