me.  It was then <<nearly one o'clock|6>>.  All I could discern
distinctly by the moonlight was a colourless, youthful face,
meagre and sharp to look at about the cheeks and chin; large,
grave, wistfully attentive eyes; nervous, uncertain lips; and
light hair of a pale, brownish-yellow hue.  There was nothing
wild, nothing immodest in her manner: it was quiet and self-
controlled, a little melancholy and a little touched by suspicion;
not exactly the manner of a lady, and, at the same time, not the
manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life.  The voice, little
as I had yet heard of it, had something curiously still and
mechanical in its tones, and the utterance was remarkably rapid.
She held a small bag in her hand: and her dress\x{2014}bonnet, shawl,
and gown all of white\x{2014}was, so far as I could guess, certainly not
composed of very delicate or very expensive materials.  Her figure
was slight, and rather above the average height\x{2014}her gait and
actions free from the slightest approach to extravagance.  This
was all that I could observe of her in the dim light and under the
perplexingly strange circumstances of our meeting.  What sort of a
woman she was, and how she came to be out alone in the high-road,
an hour <<after midnight|13>>, I altogether failed to guess.  The one
thing of which I felt certain was, that the grossest of mankind
could not have misconstrued her motive in speaking, even at that
suspiciously late hour and in that suspiciously lonely place.",

pretentious nonsense, and always worrying the unfortunate men with
every small exaction which a vain and foolish woman can impose on
long-suffering male humanity.  As Madame Fosco (aged three-and-
forty), she sits for hours together without saying a word, frozen
up in the strangest manner in herself.  The hideously ridiculous
love-locks which used to hang on either side of her face are now
replaced by stiff little rows of very short curls, of the sort one
sees in old-fashioned wigs.  A plain, matronly cap covers her
head, and makes her look, for the first time in her life since I
remember her, like a decent woman.  Nobody (putting her husband
out of the question, of course) now sees in her, what everybody
once saw\x{2014}I mean the structure of the female skeleton, in the
upper regions of the collar-bones and the shoulder-blades.  Clad
in quiet black or grey gowns, made high round the throat\x{2014}dresses
that she would have laughed at, or screamed at, as the whim of the
moment inclined her, in her maiden days\x{2014}she sits speechless in
corners; her dry white hands (so dry that the pores of her skin
look chalky) incessantly engaged, either in monotonous embroidery
work or in rolling up endless cigarettes for the Count's own
particular smoking.  On the few occasions when her cold blue eyes
are off her work, they are generally turned on her husband, with
the look of mute submissive inquiry which we are all familiar with
in the eyes of a faithful dog.  The only approach to an inward
thaw which I have yet detected under her outer covering of icy
constraint, has betrayed itself, once or twice, in the form of a
suppressed tigerish jealousy of any woman in the house (the maids
included) to whom the Count speaks, or on whom he looks with
anything approaching to special interest or attention.  Except in
this one particular, she is always, morning, <<noon|13>>, and night,
indoors and out, fair weather or foul, as cold as a statue, and as
impenetrable as the stone out of which it is cut.  For the common
purposes of society the extraordinary change thus produced in her
is, beyond all doubt, a change for the better, seeing that it has
transformed her into a civil, silent, unobtrusive woman, who is
never in the way.  How far she is really reformed or deteriorated
in her secret self, is another question.  I have once or twice
seen sudden changes of expression on her pinched lips, and heard
sudden inflexions of tone in her calm voice, which have led me to
suspect that her present state of suppression may have sealed up
something dangerous in her nature, which used to evaporate
harmlessly in the freedom of her former life.  It is quite
possible that I may be altogether wrong in this idea.  My own
impression, however, is, that I am right.  Time will show.",

the fire-engine in the town.  \"Have you got your pick-axes handy?\"
Yes, they had.  \"And a hatchet, and a saw, and a bit of rope?\"
Yes! yes! yes! I ran down among the villagers, with the lantern in

them! Two of you for the pickaxes and the tools! The rest after me
to find the beam!\" They cheered\x{2014}with shrill starveling voices

side.  We rushed in a body down the churchyard path to the first

old clerk standing on the flat tombstone sobbing and wailing over
the church.  The servant was still at my heels\x{2014}his white,
helpless, panic-stricken face was close over my shoulder as we
pushed into the cottage.  There were rafters from the torn-down
floor above, lying loose on the ground\x{2014}but they were too light.
A beam ran across over our heads, but not out of reach of our arms
and our pickaxes\x{2014}a beam fast at each end in the ruined wall, with
ceiling and flooring all ripped away, and a great gap in the roof
above, open to the sky.  We attacked the beam at both ends at
once.  God! how it held\x{2014}how the brick and mortar of the wall
resisted us! We struck, and tugged, and tore.  The beam gave at
one end\x{2014}it came down with a lump of brickwork after it.  There
was a scream from the women all huddled in the doorway to look at
us\x{2014}a shout from the men\x{2014}two of them down but not hurt.  Another
tug all together\x{2014}and the beam was loose at both ends.  We raised
it, and gave the word to clear the doorway.  Now for the work! now
for the rush at the door! There is the fire streaming into the
sky, streaming brighter than ever to light us! Steady along the
churchyard path\x{2014}steady with the beam for a rush at the door.
<<One|9k:0>>, <<two|9k:0>>, three\x{2014}and off.  Out rings the cheering again,
irrepressibly.  We have shaken it already, the hinges must give if
the lock won't.  Another run with the beam! <<One|9k:0>>, <<two|9k:0>>, three\x{2014}and
off.  It's loose! the stealthy fire darts at us through the
crevice all round it.  Another, and a last rush! The door falls in
with a crash.  A great hush of awe, a stillness of breathless
expectation, possesses every living soul of us.  We look for the
