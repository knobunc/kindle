The number of readers on the Read-O-Meter was stuck firmly at zero, with thirty-two copies of my novels listed \x{201c}bookmarked and pending.\x{201d} Of these, eighteen were active/ resting between reads. The rest were probably lying under a stack of other unfinished books. I checked the RealWorld clock. It was <<0842|9c:1>>. Years ago I was read on the train, but that hadn\x{2019}t happened for a while. Unreadfulness was a double-edged sword. More leisure time, but a distinct loss of purpose. I turned to Mrs. Malaprop.",
