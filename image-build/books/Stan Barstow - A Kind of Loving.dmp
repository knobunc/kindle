By the time I do manage to get in there I\x{2019}m feeling a bit sour at having all these people barging about the place, and thinking about a couple of thousand more that live in the town and have to be transported to the church. Being in a bit of a flap I forget to shoot the bolt behind me and it doesn\x{2019}t improve my temper when the door flies open and young Dorothy and Angela catch me without pants. This amuses them no end and I wonder if I can\x{2019}t arrange to fall downstairs and break a leg and give them a real laugh. A couple of proper horrors, Dorothy and Angela, twins, belonging to Auntie Agnes, one of my mother\x{2019}s sisters. I know the Old Lady can\x{2019}t abide them and she only had Chris ask them to be bridesmaids because she didn\x{2019}t want to get across with Auntie Agnes who\x{2019}s one of them sensitive types who go through life looking for any offence left lying about for the taking. I\x{2019}ve only had one glimpse of Chris as she nipped across the landing and from the tight little smile she gives me when I make a crack that\x{2019}s supposed to be cheerful I guess she won\x{2019}t be sorry when it\x{2019}s all over and she\x{2019}s with David on the <<3.45|3c>> to the Great Metropolis. It\x{2019}s even affected the Old Man. I\x{2019}m just about to go downstairs to get started when he calls me into the bedroom and I find him standing in his undervest and trousers in front of the wardrobe mirror.",

It seems to me I\x{2019}m spending altogether too much time these days either looking in mirrors at home or catching sight of myself in mirrors outside.

Things are a bit slack this morning and by <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> we\x{2019}ve had a woman in for a record catalogue, another woman with an electric iron for repair, and a bod who\x{2019}s wandered round looking at TV sets and radiograms and wouldn\x{2019}t let me tell him anything about them. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m just looking,\x{2019} he says.

Her skin\x{2019}s a nice soft creamy pinkish colour and she has a black beauty spot on her left cheek. I don\x{2019}t know what colour she\x{2019}d be at <<half past seven in the morning|10>> with no heat in the bedroom and the curtains stiff with frost but I like it well enough now. The colour spreads from her neck on to her chest, which is nicely covered and promises well for lower down. I sit there with half a pint of bitter in front of me and watch her. I\x{2019}ve always had a fancy for bints like this; real tough bints, hard as nails, know all the answers, ready to put blokes like me in their place in two ticks, but as sexy and willing as you could wish for with the right kind of chap. She comes and reaches down for something under the bar right in front of where I\x{2019}m sitting and I see further into the top of her frock than\x{2019}s good for me in my frame of mind. Now, I think, if I\x{2019}d had plenty of cash I could have picked up with a bint like this and I\x{2019}d have been landed. Sex without complications, and love could wait till the right girl came along. Instead of that it all gets mixed up and complicated and before you know where you are you\x{2019}re miles and miles up the creek with not a paddle in sight. And then I get the old dragging feeling inside me, because I\x{2019}m married, hooked, and even if I turn my head this very minute and see the right girl standing behind me with Welcome, Vic, written all over her face there\x{2019}s not a damn thing I can do about it.
