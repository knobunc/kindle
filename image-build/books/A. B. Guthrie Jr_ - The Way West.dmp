            'THE DAY dawned clear, but it had rained the night before, the sudden squally rain of middle March. Taking a look out the kitchen door, seeing the path lead down to the muddy barnyard and the tracks of his shoepacks splashed in it, Lije Evans was just as well satisfied that things were wet. It gave him an excuse not to work, even if he could be mending harness or fixing tools. Not that he minded work; it was just that he didn\'t feel like working today.

     "Likely I\'ll go to town, Rebecca," he said, closing the door.

     "To talk about Oregon," she said, not quite as if she blamed him.

     "Why, now," he answered, smiling at her while he lounged over to a stool, "I hadn\'t give a thought to what I\'ll talk about. I\'ll talk about whatever comes up." He knew she saw through him, and he didn\'t care. She always had seen through him.

     "I don\'t know why everyone\'s gone crazy all of a sudden," she said while she wiped the last of the dishes and hung the towel on its peg. "Everyone talking about Oregon, and it so far away you can\'t think where."

     "Not everybody. Not as many as will be."

     "It\'ll blow over. You wait and see." She got the broom out of the corner. "I declare, that dog does track things up."

     Evans looked down at Rock, who had let himself fall in the middle of the floor after leaving the marks of his big pads on the worn wood. "Rock\'s a good dog."

     At the mention of his name, the dog lifted his head and got up slow and came over and put his chin in Evans\' lap. He was getting old, Evans told himself, seeing the muzzle graying and his eyes beginning to shine dim with years. Rock was half hound and half no-one-knew-what, but he was a handsome dog, white and blue mixed, and a good one, too. "Reckon it\'s too much to ask him to wipe his feet before he comes in," Evans said.

     Rebecca grunted to that while she swept.

     "You can\'t go, boy," Evans said while he stroked Rock\'s head. "You chew up them town dogs too much. You\'ll get me in trouble one of these days, that\'s what you\'ll do."

     "I ain\'t sure but what I\'d say no. Of course you ain\'t goin\', though. It\'s just talk."

     "How\'s that, Becky?"

     "No to Oregon."

     "Now, Becky," he said, "don\'t be makin\' up your mind independent. What if I should take it into my head to light out with the rest?"

     She grunted again, and Evans knew it was because the thought of their splitting up was so outlandish. Another man, now, might not think she was much, heavy like she was and extra full-breasted, but she suited him, maybe as much for the way her mind worked as for anything else, maybe because she knew him up and down and inside out and still thought he was all right. A man got so he didn\'t see what other eyes saw; he got so that what he saw on the outside was what he knew lay underneath.

      "Reckon Brownie wants to trail along with me?" he asked. "You heard him say he was goin\' fishin\'. He\'s diggin\' worms now."

     "Good thing to do."

     "There\'s a heap of you in him," she said, looking at him. "You used to like fishin\' and such."

     "And I hate work."

     "I didn\'t say that, Lije. It ain\'t so."

     Evans had to smile inside. Every time he made little of himself, she said it wasn\'t so. "Oregon," he said, letting his thoughts drift, "it would be a good thing to a man, knowin\' he had helped settle the country and so joined it to America." In his mind he went back over his words; they didn\'t tell what it was he felt.

     Becky didn\'t answer.

     "The huntin\' and fishin\' ought to be good in Oregon. Brownie would like that. A man wouldn\'t mess with rabbits and coons and possum there. Brownie wants to go."

     "Last time you talked, it was the soil was so good."

     "Soil, too. Everything."

     "How you know?"

     "It\'s what they say."

     "Dick Summers don\'t think Oregon\'s so much, not for farmin\'."

     "Dick don\'t look on it that way, is all. He thinks about Injuns and furs and such. Farmin\' don\'t come natural to him."

     "He does all right."

     "It still don\'t come natural. You can keep a varmint in a cage, but it don\'t come natural to him. Not that Dick\'s like a varmint."

     "You ought to call round on him, Lije. Mattie looks awful poorly."

     "Maybe I ought to."

     She stepped over toward him. "Lije, we got Brownie to think of and all. Wouldn\'t do to act sudden about Oregon."

     "No. But it wouldn\'t be so sudden."

    "Well?" She strung the word out as she put the broom away.

     Evans turned as the door opened and saw Brownie coming in and asked, "Want to go to town?"

     The boy answered, "Don\'t guess so, Pa. It\'s a fishin\' day today."

     "It don\'t matter," Evans answered, still stroking the dog. \'\'Just thought maybe you was wore out with yourself." He let his eyes travel over Brownie. "I swear, boy, if ever you get meat on them bones, you\'ll be a sure-God man." Brownie was, Evans thought, close to a man already, long-boned and hard-muscled, with young whiskers on his face when he let them grow. A good hoy, he was, a shy and backward boy, just coming on to the time when things were hardest, when a man wanted women worse than ever in his life and didn\'t know how to hold himself in or let himself go, being awkward and afraid. "I hope you catch fish. I got a hunger for fish after all the salt pork and beans I\'ve et." Evans got up. "I\'ll be goin\'."

     Rebecca came to the door as he let himself out. "Remember, Lije."

    He nodded.

     "You ain\'t as young as you were."

     "Nobody is. But I ain\'t so old, neither. Thirty-five. A man\'s prime at thirty-five. Stay back, Rock."

     She didn\'t say anything but closed the door slowly.

     He went to the barn and saddled a mule. It was six miles to Independence. He would get there this side of midmorning if he moved right along, and some later if he let the mule laze. He let him laze.

     He didn\'t guess he would join up for Oregon, for all that he would be proud to have a hand in it, to build up Uncle Sam and stop the British. Missouri was a good-enough country. A man could live, even if not fat, if he had a mind to work. He could live and fight fever and trade at the store and hope maybe someday to buy himself a nigger and so have more time for doing what he wanted to do. It wasn\'t that he wanted a passel of niggers and a big house and fancy horses, like some had in the cotton country in the south of the state. Maybe he didn\'t want even one nigger. He was a slave man himself, but still, come right down to the quick of it, he didn\'t know as one man had a right to own another, black or white. It was just that he wanted something more out of life than he had found.

     It was likely a foolish business, this going to Oregon, but it was good to think about, like thinking about getting out of old ways and free of old places. Like his pa had said once, telling about coming down the Ohio in a flatboat, there wasn\'t any place as pretty as the one that lay ahead.

     It was a time to think of moving, a time when the fields and trees, for all their raw and naked look, showed they knew spring was coming. The blood flowed quick in the body, and ideas came to a man. Once when his pa\'s house burned, catching fire in the stick-and-mud chimney, he had felt a little the same way, as if all the things he had been doing as a boy didn\'t need to be done any more, and he could strike out fresh and build his life as he wanted it. People sure would think he was crazy, knowing what was in his head.

     The day would be warm, he thought, as the trail led out of a hunch of trees into a piece of prairie. He could feel the sun where his pants lay flat against his thigh. A woodchuck ambled in the grass and looked at him, and Evans figured he could shoot his eye out if he had his rifle with him. Mostly, now, he left the rifle at home, for it was heavy and he figured the country safe enough even if some others didn\'t.

     The mule clomped along in the mud. A dull critter, a mule, not knowing the seasons or taking note of redbirds and thrashers fixing for nesting, or hardly knowing whether it was fair or stormy. Or maybe a mule thought about more than a man would guess and went along slow and sad under the load of ideas.

     The town showed up by and by, the first cabins squatting on the wet ground, their round or squared logs dark with the night\'s rain, dogs sniffing at corners and running out to bark, a couple of tents shining white in the sun and three men sitting on a log near by, their rifles close to hand, probably talking about Oregon while they waited for the start. The stores were busy, with customers stepping in and out and blacks unloading goods that teams had hauled from the landing. Three Mexicans with broad peaked hats walked in front of the Noland House, looking like robbers, as the hired hands of the Santa Fe traders usually did.

     Two men were standing in front of Hitchcock\'s store, talking ernest. One was Tadlock, the Illinois man who had come to Independence early to talk Oregon and didn\'t want to join any company already being formed but to set up his own. Tadlock was full of business all the time, or anyway he had been full of business, just as he was now, at the one time Evans had seen him before.

     The other man was spindly-looking and had a crop of whiskers that seemed to have molted some. He just kept bobbing his lead to Tadlock, as if to say yes to everything.

     Evans said, "How-de-do, Mr. Tadlock."

     Tadlock turned and squinted to remember and answered, "Good morning, Evans."

     Evans pulled the mule over to a post and got off, feeling a little stiff in the knees, and tied up. He walked over to the two men.

     "This is Henry McBee," Tadlock said. "Lije Evans." They shook hands.

     "McBee\'s going to Oregon," Tadlock went on. "How is it with you now? Made up your mind?"

     "I wouldn\'t say I had and I wouldn\'t say I hadn\'t. My mind kind of makes itself up if I give it some rope."

     Tadlock didn\'t think that was funny. "Better push it along. There\'ll be things to do."

     "Where you from, McBee?" Evans asked.

     "Southern Ohio. Cincinnati, you might say."

     "He\'s a man who knows his mind," Tadlock put in.

     "Yes, sir," the man said. "All of a sudden, I sold out and put my woman and young\'uns on a boat and hauled my own tail aboard, and here we come, hurrah for Oregon. Things ain\'t so good in Ohio nohow."

     Evans nodded. "Nor here, neither. Let\'s have a drink."

     "\'Y God it\'s a strong thought," McBee said, and looked at Tadlock and kind of drew in, for Tadlock was shaking his head.

     Tadlock said, "I\'m not a drinking man." He seemed to think twice and added as if he hardly meant it, "You two go on." He started to move off. "Got a couple of other men I want you to meet. I\'ll bring them around."

     Evans and McBee went into the store. Hitchcock had his hands on the counter, waiting for trade. His red-veined, popped eyes swam to them. You could tell Hitchcock was a good drammer from the looks of him.

     There was the smell of leather in the place, and cheese, and clothes just out of a box, and whisky that had spilled on the counter. The smells mixed with the stink of a pile of furs that lay in the back.

  Evans said, "You damned old robber, how about a drink?"

     "First sensible thing I heard you say since God knows when." Hitchcock drew two glasses, and thought it over and drew <<one|11>> for himself.

     "Yes, sir," McBee said, scuffing his beard with his knuckles before he drank, "I said to myself, \'Oregon, now, there\'s a spot for a man.\' " His Adam\'s apple bobbed to the whisky. "No sense in workin\' your guts out -and for nothin\'."

     Hitchcock leaned on the counter. "It\'s like the hydrophoby. You get bit and you\'re gone. Or it\'s like a dog with two bones. Can\'t handle but one but won\'t let another dog have the other. Let the British have Oregon. We got bone enough."

     "You don\'t hold with movin\' to Oregon?" McBee asked.

     "Not as long as he\'s got a counter to lean on and whisky to drink," Evans answered.

     Hitchcock let his big eyes slide to Evans. "What\'s wrong with Missouri? Same kind of people here, and more hog meat to eat, and you can sleep dainty in a sure-enough bed."

     McBee said, "I guess you don\'t understand. Fill \'em up, will you?" When it came time to pay, he fumbled in his breeches and finally turned to Evans and said, "I\'m damned if I ain\'t left my money at the wagon."

     Evans paid. "You ain\'t the pioneer kind, Hitch. Let \'em settle, "And you come after, with your bar\'ls and calico and ideas of gettin\' rich. Storekeepin\' ain\'t what you\'d call venturesome."

     "A hell of a lot you know about it, Lije. A store man\'s got to he quick on the trigger." He straightened his big bulk, as if to show he was ready for whatever. "And where\'d you be without a store?"

     " \'Y God, out of debt," McBee put in.

     Hitchcock stared at him. "I reckon you know," he said, "that no wagon train\'s takin\' a debt-skipper."

     "I was just makin\' fun."

     "Take away the stores," Evans said, "and a man could lay by some money."

     "I get rich, I do," Hitchcock answered him, "tradin\' for runty eggs and bad mushrat and whatever ain\'t good enough for you to keep. Man come in the other day and wanted to trade a goddam rock. Said it was a madstone and never known to fail and when I said why didn\'t he keep it then, he said he figured he was too lively to get bit and it was slow-movin\' men like me needed pertection."

     "And did you trade?" Evans asked.

     Hitchcock nodded. "I always trade, if a man\'s reasonable. I  give \'im some wooden nutmegs that a damn Yankee passed on me oncet, \'fore I was old enough to have my eyes open. I traded him all right, and the rock was so hard and slick it wouldn\'t pick up honey, let alone pizen, and then I threw the rock away and figured I got the best of the deal."

     "How so?"

     "Tradin\' nothin\' for nothin\', I got shet of the nutmegs. It always hurt my pride, lookin\' at \'em."

  Evans heard the door squeaking open and turned around and saw Tadlock coming in, and with him two other men, one looking to be not much more than a boy.

     Hitchcock\'s slow gaze went to Tadlock. "I know it ain\'t whisky you\'re wantin\'," he said, as if a man that didn\'t drink was queer beyond knowing, maybe remembering when everybody drank and even a preacher would take a swig or two so as to be able to talk some extra fire into hell.

     "Right," said Tadlock. "Evans, shake hands with Curtis Mack. And Charles Fairman. And this is Henry McBee."

     They shook hands all around. Charles Fairman was the young-looking man. He had a good face, with dark eyes and a high forehead and a seriousness about him that meant he had seen more years or trouble than a man might think at first.

     Curtis Mack was older, and different. Evans guessed him to be maybe thirty-five. He was the kind of man who seemed not to give all his attention to what was going on; part of him was somewhere else, looking backward or forward, fretting, maybe, over what he had to do.

     "Mack and Fairman have joined my company," Tadlock said. "Hurrah for Oregon!" It was McBee speaking up.

     "With my men from Illinois," Tadlock said as if he owned them, "we have close to the makings of a train. We don\'t want too big a company. We want to travel light and fast."

     "How many of ye?" McBee asked Fairman.

     The young man answered, "My wife and boy."

     "Married, eh?"

     Fairman nodded.

     "I was just thinkin\'. Got a girl comin\' seventeen myself, her and my old woman and five besides."

     Evans wanted another drink, now that he had had a couple. Becky might scold him a little -but still he didn\'t drink very often or very much. He asked, "How about a drink?"

     Before anybody else could answer, McBee said, "I do believe I will."

     The others said they would, too, all except Tadlock.

     Fairman raised his glass and said, "Here\'s to a place where there\'s no fever."

     "\'Y God, yes," answered McBee. "And to soil rich as anything. Plant a nail and it\'ll come up a spike. I heerd you don\'t never have to put up hay, the grass is that good, winter and all. And lambs come twice a year. Just set by and let the grass grow and the critters birth and get fat. That\'s my idee of farmin\'."

     "Seems to me," said Evans, "that you all are ahead of yourselves. Be a month and more before you can start."

     The man, Mack, nodded. "First come, best served. Best land, best damsites, best business locations." He fell silent and stood looking off, his forehead wrinkled, as if he saw Oregon and the land and the sites and the locations he had spoken of. The thumb of the hand at his side kept playing along the fingers.

     "We\'ve got plenty of work to do before we can start," Tadlock said.

     The young Fairman bobbed his head. "The more I think of it, the more I think I\'m doing right. No fever. New land. New chances."

     "A new way of things," Evans said, reading what was in Fairman\'s mind and putting it all together, and Fairman gave him a little smile and nodded again.

     "Of course you\'re doing right," Tadlock spoke up. "You ought to join, Evans, right now."

     "What\'s the matter with Missouri?" It was Hitchcock asking, as he wiped the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand. The red eyeballs went from one to another of them for an answer.

  Then his gaze slid over to the door, and Evans, following it, .aw the door opening and a girl coming in. She stepped in and held the door half shut behind her and stood uncertain, like a bird about to fly, and it grew on Evans that she was such a girl as a man wouldn\'t see every day. The curves of her gave shape to the shapeless linsey-woolsey she wore. The face above the dress was so quick and aware it almost hurt to look. The face was pale, and the planes of the cheeks long and smooth, and the mouth full as a knowing man wanted a mouth to be. The eyes were big and dark and darkly shining, except that shining wasn\'t exactly the word for them. Glowing, maybe, was more like it.

     "Pa," she said, standing there in bare feet, the lines of her young breasts showing through her sack of a dress. McBee looked up then. "Well?"

     "Ma wants you should come to the wagon."

     McBee\'s mouth worked in the scrubby beard. "You tell your ma I\'m busy."

     "She said, please, to come."

     One small foot came tip and slid down the instep of the other, and Evans guessed her ma had said not to come back without her pa.

     "You tell her I\'ll come when I can, and not before. Hear?"

     Evans brought. his gaze away from her and looked at McBee and then at the rest and caught Mack unguarded, his eyes busy, his face marked with what might be hunger, as if for a minute, and maybe for no more than that, he had let his thoughts run away with him. The others made out not to notice anything much, maybe feeling small and out of place as Evans did himself.

     "You git on!" McBee said.

     The girl turned then, slowly, and went through the door and closed it and was lost to sight.

     "The damn women!" McBee said. "Always wantin\' you for something. That\'s my girl, Mercy." He reached in his pocket for a twist of tobacco.

     They drank quietly for a minute, and then Tadlock changed the subject that was in their minds. "We haven\'t decided on a pilot. We have to find a good pilot."

     "There are some who say they are," Mack said, taking his eyes from the door. "Adams for one. Or Meek."

     McBee tongued his chew to one side. "Goddam it, I bet they couldn\'t follow a turnpike."

     Tadlock spoke again. "Adams hasn\'t been beyond Fort Laramie. Any fool can get to Laramie. It\'s the country beyond that counts."

     "What about Meek?" Mack asked.

     "I understand he\'s already dickering, he and Adams both."

     Tadlock turned to Evans. "You know a good pilot?"

     "I don\'t guess so."

     "You talk as if you might."

     "I was just thinkin\'."

     Tadlock waited.

     "I reckon I do know one. Gettin\' him is the question."

     "Who is it?"

     "I don\'t know as I ought to say before I can talk to him myself. Maybe he wouldn\'t appreciate my sayin\'."

     "Why would he object?"

     Mack ordered drinks again, motioning to Hitchcock.

     "I don\'t know. Maybe he wouldn\'t."

     "How could it hurt to tell? It doesn\'t commit him -and we\'ve got to know if we\'re going to put the proposition. There ought to be a nice piece of money in it for him. Not as much as with a big company, but the worry and work would be less."

     "Well," Evans said, taking the refilled glass, "I reckon you\'re right. He sure-God can say no for himself. It\'s old Dick Summers. He\'s been everywhere, trappin\' beaver and fightin\' Indians and all. He could guide us blindfolded."

     "Where does he live?"

     "Neighbor to me."

     "Is there a chance we could get him?"

     "Hard tellin\'. His woman\'s poorly."

     "But you\'re sure he\'d do?" Tadlock went on. "We can\'t have some worn-out grandpa who\'ll show up with a Harpers Ferry musket and a jug of whisky."

     "I \'xpect," said Evans slowly, looking Tadlock in the face, that Dick Summers is just about the best man I ever met up with."

     "Would you go with us to see him?"

     "Sometime. Tomorry or next day."

     "Good. Fine. Meantime we\'ll figure on the pay." Tadlock figured on it in his head right then, without saying what it might add up to. When he spoke it was to ask Evans: "Now has that mind of yours made itself up?"

     "I ain\'t sure."

     "We\'ll have a full party before long."

     Mack asked, "Why would you want to stay here when you can go to Oregon? As I said, first come, best served."

     Evans didn\'t have an answer.

     "I hope you can go," young Fairman said as if he meant it.

     "Look here," said Tadlock, counting off on his fingers as he made his points. "You know the Willamette valley is fertile, pretty, too, beyond anything we know here."

     "That\'s what they tell me."

     "It\'s rich. It is easy to get to by water, by river and ocean."

     Evans agreed.

     "That Iowa committee -two years ago, wasn\'t it?- it knew what it was talking about."

     "How\'s that?"

     "Take climate, it said, or water power or health or timber or soil or convenience to markets, Oregon beat them all."

     "That was before they got there."

     "You haven\'t heard a different story since?"

     "Don\'t know as I have."

     "Look," Tadlock said, using his hands like a man who stood for office. "There\'s a better reason yet, to my mind." He paused to let the words sink in. "Is it our country or England\'s? You want it to be British?"

     "Hitchcock does, but not me."

     "Well, what\'s going to decide it? People, that\'s what. People like you and me. if we\'ve got gumption enough to settle there."

     The blood had climbed to Tadlock\'s face. In his temple Evans could see a vein stand out. His words had a ring to them. In spite of himself, Evans was moved.

     "They say fifty-four forty or fight," Tadlock went on. "By God, we won\'t have to fight if enough of us are on the ground!" He let his voice fall. "It would be a proud thing, Evans, for you and your children and their young ones, too, saying Pa or Grandpa helped win the country. Or do you want to sit in a chair and let others make history?"

     Tadlock pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his forehead. "That\'s all -except to say again we want you."

     "What do you think?" Mack asked.

     Evans read in Fairman\'s face the hope he would say yes.

     "You\'re bunchin\' up on me." Evans looked from face to face, and saw them all solemn and waiting, even McBee\'s. Almost before he knew it, he said, "Tell you what. If Dick Summers goes, I will."

     "Good enough."

     McBee said, " \'Y God, shake hands."

     They had another drink -all except Tadlock and Fairman­ and then Evans went and untied his mule. Riding home, he told himself he had let the whisky talk, but still he wondered what he would do and still didn\'t wonder, either. It was as if the course had been set all along, and he had been playing that it wasn\'t, acting like he could say yes or no. He would go if Dick wwent, and, maybe, by hell, he would anyway. Free men, brave men in a great, new nation. A new way of things. Soil good. Hunting good. Climate good. No fever. Hurrah for Oregon! He wouldn\'t figure too much why it was he went. The head got tired, figuring. He would just go because he wanted to, for all sorts of reasons. He would go if he felt the same as now after the fire died in him.

     He unsaddled the mule and turned it loose and made for the cabin, remembering of a sudden that he hadn\'t eaten and was hungry. The sun was sliding down the western sky, showing through the tail of a cloud. Likely it would be fair tomorrow and he would have to dig and grub and split and bend and lift and jolt as if his life depended on it, which it did. A man didn\'t make history, staying close to home.

     Old Rock welcomed him, as if asking what was up, and he opened the door and saw Rebecca stooping at the fireplace. "Get your breeches on, Becky," he called out. "We\'re goin\' to Oregon',

            '"Tadlock\'s a good-enough man," Evans said. "Got more learning than most. Spills over with feelin\' for America. He sure-God wants to be captain of the company."

     "Where\'d you say he\'s from?"

     "Illinois. Illinois-river country, but I don\'t figure him for a farmer. Officeholder, more likely. I seen him in town this morning. Told him not to come out, but it could be he will. He\'s a mule-headed man."

     Summers didn\'t let himself answer, not being sure what to make of Tadlock. Right off, though, he didn\'t take to him.

     After a silence Evans asked, "You want to take a look?" He bent his head toward the cabin. "The women want you should have a look."

     Summers said, "Sure enough," but he didn\'t get up. He didn\'t want to get up just yet.

     He felt sad and, in a way, at home with sadness. It was only the young who took on over death and disappointment, maybe because they expected more than God Almighty would ever give. In time a man took losses as they came, a man going on to fifty did, anyway, remembering old goodbyes.

     That was how he was saying goodbye to his woman. She hadn\'t been a well woman, not ever since he\'d known her, but yellow and drawn out by fever and sick to death once before, when she\'d slipped the young one he had planted in her. But for all that, she had been a good woman, not smart-looking or playful or gentle on the outside, but hard-working and wishful of good things for him. Was she alive now, she would follow the cow out in the morning to find where the young wild greens were growing, and so boil him a kettle of them along with a piece of fat meat. It wasn\'t exactly the fever that killed her; it was just as if her strength had run out. She had taken to bed and died in two days, knowing all the time she had to die and looking at him with fever-shiny eyes and neither of them able to say anything to each other but little, piddling things like never seen a nicer spring or wonder if Lije Evans sold his place yet so\'s to go to Oregon. He had seen old horses die like that. He had seen them go and lie down and give up and look at you with slow eyes while life leaked away.

     A plain-looking, goodhearted woman. He thought maybe he ought to feel worse at losing her, as if the way he felt wasn\'t fitting to her. He oughtn\'t to be thinking of young squaws and old days in the mountains. But he had always thought about them some, even while she was alive. Her being dead didn\'t make the thinking worse.

     Like everything else, feelings got mixed up, so that you could be sad and know you ought to be sad, and still be kind of light-spirited, too, as he was himself. Down in him, if he didn\'t watch against it, he felt free again. It was as if the world had opened up. He felt free, and it was spring, and the mountains stood sharp in his mind, and he could pilot a wagon train to Oregon as well as anybody. He took himself for an old fool, but maybe it didn\'t hurt to think he could begin fresh, or get back what had made the young years good. He was sad, sure rnough, but set up, too. Already he could feel the west wind in his face and see the cactus flowering. He was glad he didn\'t have to explain to anyone -to God, for instance- the way it was with him.

     It had grown so dark he couldn\'t see the people at the cabin, except when a head moved across the lighted window. He could hear their voices, though, the throaty talk of men holding themselves in while they sat around outside the cabin with a bottle and the higher voices of women coming from inside. Down toward the barn the hogs were uneasy, making a noise like growling, which some folks would say was a sign of storm.

     "\'Nother thing," Evans said. "There\'s a preacher takin\' the night at the Tuckers\'. Tucker wanted I should ask you do you want him to preach the funeral."

     "I left it all to him."

     "But he didn\'t know about this preacher. The preacher just drifted in. A Methodist, Tucker said he was."

     "One\'s as good as another, I reckon. She would want a preacher."

     "Funeral in the morning," Evans said, not asking a question but telling what he knew. Summers nodded.

     "Be best."

     Summers kept on nodding.

     "Preacher might want a piece of money, Dick. \'Course, we could sing a song and Harry Barlow could read Scripture and say a prayer, and we could let it go at that?"

    "Let the preacher come, Lije. I figured Tucker would get one out of Independence, a Campbellite if he could, for that\'s the way his mind runs."

     "I\'ll tell Tucker. This here preacher\'s bound for Oregon, or so I hear."

     "That so?" Summers got off the stump. "I better see how the women done." He walked with Evans to the cabin.

     The men fell silent as he passed through the sitting circle, and the women hushed and stepped aside when he entered. They looked flushed and livelier than usual. He thought, without faulting them, that there was nothing like a death to bring women to life. They spoke low or just nodded to him -all except Mrs. Evans- and he knew they were uneasy with him around, remembering maybe how full of chatter they had been or wondering what he would say. There was a joint of meat on the kitchen table, and greens, and a white-flour pie and a pan of corn bread and a pile of other stuff. Through the door to the bedroom he could make out the body in the box Lije Evans had built. The box rested on two trestles that Summers had used in his carpenter work.

     "After you take a look, you come and eat," Mrs. Evans said in her strong voice. "Everybody\'s et, and you got to eat, regardless." She walked into the bedroom with him, a hefty, big­bosomed woman who stepped light for all her weight. In one hand she carried a slut. The weak light of it made moving shadows in the room. She held it close to the box so that he could see.

     They had scrubbed Mattie and combed her hair and laid her out with her arms crossed on her chest, and she looked like death-by-fever, as Summers had known she would. For a long minute he looked down at her, hearing Mrs. Evans breathe by his side and feeling the women waiting for his words. He saw the new dress they\'d bought and saw the hands worn and ingrained with dirt in spite of scrubbing and the color of old fever on the brow and cheeks. The hair, now that he came to look at it, was whiter than he remembered. He wouldn\'t see her any more, dyeing homespun with bark or copperas or indigo, or sewing, or making candles, or mashing flint corn for starch, or looking at the sun mark on the kitchen floor to tell what time it was. All that was left was the still, shrunk body, and come morning it would be gone, too, and it would be like Mattie never lived except as he remembered her.

     She had been his woman. She had shared his bed and kept his house and done her full share and more of the work and been a good if not exciting wife in all ways, and he ought not to be wanting to get away from what was left of her, from the yellowed skin and sunken eyes and the sober-sided look she always wore.

    He waited another minute, not touching her and not wanting to, and then he turned around, nodding slow. "I\'m obliged, a heap obliged," he said to the women as he stepped back into the kitchen. "Don\'t see how anyone could do it nicer."

     "She does look natural, don\'t she?" Mrs. Evans said. "We been saying how natural she looks. You come and eat now."

     Lije Evans poked his head inside. "That there preacher dropped by, Dick, and Tadlock, too. You want to talk to the preacher?"

     "No need for talk, I reckon," Summers said, but while he was saying it the preacher stepped in. He was tall and old and lean-looking, and hollow at the temples, and his face showed weather and worry over sinning. He had slicked himself up and put on a black coat that didn\'t go with the faded jeans cloth of his breeches. He held his hand out. His voice was old, too, and cracked -cracked maybe, Summers thought, from calling on sinners to come to Jesus.

     "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away."

     Summers took the hand without speaking.

     "My name is Weatherby, Joseph Weatherby, Brother Summers. I come from Indiany."

     "That\'s all right."

     The cracked voice said, "I feel that the Lord has guided me here, to this house of grief."

     The words rolled out of his mouth, full-shaped and extra-ripe, as if being offered to the Lord. "Do not grieve. God works in mysterious ways."

     At another time, Summers would have had to smile to himself. Preachers and medicine men -they were cut from the same cloth. They made out to know what nobody could. Companyeros to the Great Spirit. But he didn\'t smile now. He just looked into the faded blue eyes and the old face, and knew it for a fact that Weatherby believed what he said.

     "Brother Tucker tells me you would like for me to conduct the service."

     "That\'s neighborly."

     "Do you have a favorite psalm or text? Or did she?"

     "Not as I remember."

     "I will read from Ephesians then."

     "You pick it out."

     The bony head bobbed, then lifted to say, "They tell me you may pilot a party to Oregon?"

     "Might be."

     "I want to go. I feel the Lord is calling me to the new land, perhaps to bring His blessings to the heathen."

     "It\'s a long piece, for them as ain\'t young or used to it."

     "I put my faith in Him."

     "You won\'t have any trouble findin\' a company. There\'s plenty aim to go, from Independence and St. Joe."

     "What about yours?"

     "It ain\'t mine, even if I go. Companies make their own rules. I reckon they\'d be glad to have you."

     Mrs. Evans tugged at Summers\' arm. "Come and eat."

     "Maybe I better see Tadlock," he answered. "I\'ll be back in a shake."

     Tadlock was standing just outside the door. "We\'d like to talk to you a minute, if you\'ll forgive us for coming at this time."

     "Who is it?" Summers asked, as if he didn\'t know. "Several of us, representing the society."

     Mrs. Evans\' voice floated out the door. "I declare! You ought to give a man time to eat."

     Tadlock led the way over to the big oak that shaded the cabin at <<noon|13>>, or that would shade it when it got its leaves out. There were four other men there, counting Lije Evans, who spoke up to say, "This ain\'t my idea, Dick."

     Tadlock said, "Someone has to take responsibility." He stood solid on his feet. His face turned from Evans to Summers. "This isn\'t pleasant, let me tell you. But it was a month ago, almost, that we asked you, and you didn\'t quite say yes or no, and now, as we see it, you have no particular reason to stay on here. Time is running short. We have to have an answer. We want to be first on the way. Are you going to pilot us or not? If not, we must find another man."

     "Maybe you better be lookin\' around."

     "As I said, we want to be first out, so we don\'t have to eat the dirt of trains ahead of us, so that we\'ll have grazing for our stock."

     "Good idea," Summers said.

     Evans put in, "We\'d rather have you, Dick."

     "It\'s just that we can\'t fool around," Tadlock said. There was something about him, about his stand and his talk, that put Summers a little in mind of a man daring you to spit in his face.

     "Do what you please," Summers answered.

     He turned and made for the cabin, thinking over what he had said, thinking it wouldn\'t have made any difference if he had told them now. It was just that Tadlock graveled him -and perhaps for no good reason at all except his outside manner. A man didn\'t like to be pushed.

     Summers already knew well enough what his answer was. He wished the funeral was over. He would sell out, except for the land itself, which he might have to come back to, and except for the critters he would need. He would saw open the big log where he had cached his beaver, banks being what they were. He would saw open the log that he had bored into and put his money in and sealed with a peg sawed flush. It wouldn\'t take him long to get ready.

     The breeze that fanned his face might have swept down out of the far mountains, across the long roll of the plains, from places realer to him still than the ground he walked on.',

            'LIJE EVANS had been to some powerful stump speakings and to revivals where people got the shakes and hollered in the unknown tongue. He was reminded of them now, here at what was called rendezvous, where officers would be elected and outfits inspected and things made ready for the march. The racket of it filled the ear, women clacking, men yelling at mules and oxen and talking in little groups, young ones shouting, dogs barking, and every once in a while a mule braying or a cow bawling. The eye couldn\'t rest. People were taking down tents and driving cattle out to pasture and reloading wagons, having found, driving from Independence or Westport, that their plunder wasn\'t arranged right. Children ran among the white-topped wagons and tripped over tent pegs and sprawled in the dusty grass, and now and then a new wagon, splash-marked by the Missouri Blue, would jolt up from town, and women and young ones would blossom out of it, and the men would get busy unyoking the critters.

     Off a piece Brother Weatherby was moving among the people, stopping when he could get someone to listen, his shoulders stooped in their tow-linen shirt, his old face solemn with the weight of what he knew. Evans caught echoes of the rusty voice, which was likely setting things up for a preaching tonight, for Weatherby\'s Methodist argument on "One Lord, onefaith, one baptism."  Brother Weatherby loved to exhort, as he called it. A mule slowing the train while it stopped to lift its tail was almost enough to make him cut loose. After exhorting, he would get the hat passed. "Remember, the Lord loveth a cheerful giver." Evans imagined that was one of the reasons he preached so often; he didn\'t have anything. But if you put it up to him that he preached for money, just like a man farmed or traded or kept store, probably he would say he needed the money to do the work of the Lord. Maybe he did. You couldn\'t listen to him and doubt he believed God had singled him out to spread the Word.

     Evans stood with his foot on the wagon tongue and watched and listened. A bitch in heat went by, trailed by all the dogs in camp, including old Rock, and they all lifted their legs, one by one, at a little hazel bush and trotted on, each hoping, even the littlest, that the Lord had singled him out, too.

  Like Brother Weaterby, Tadlock, the politician, was making the rounds, though no one stood for election against him. He was an important talker and he carried an Oregon guide­book with him to show he knew more than anybody, except maybe Dick Summers, about the way to get west.

     Somewhere off where Evans couldn\'t see, a man was cussing a mule or an ox. Evans saw Weatherby hold up and listen and knew he was thinking about the wickedness of swearing.

     While the sun sailed quiet in the sky and the little winds ran in whispers in the grass, thc voices of the camp rose harsh, like the voices of excited geese. Though they were only twenty miles or so west of Independence and hadn\'t seen an Indian except for some Shawnees and some scabby Kaws that a Missouri man might see any day, already a few people were afraid, as if they had cut loose from all safety and faced enemies the like of which no one of them had ever known. There was Mrs. Turley, who was all holler and no heart, who kept talking and looking around as if she expected the biggest Indian ever born to show up swinging a hatchet; and Mrs. McBee, a sharp-tongued snipe of a woman who wanted to go back to Ohio; and McBee himself, talking big to hide his littleness. And there were others ­Evans wouldn\'t know how many- with worry on their faces and fear in their stomachs while they thought ahead to the Platte and the Pawnees and the Black Hills and the Sioux.

     Rebecca sat in the shade of the wagon, fanning herself with a pie plate for lack of something better, for though April wasn\'t gone, the sun was hot. Brownie was out watching the cattle, along with the man, Hig that Fairman had hired, and a bunch of others, mostly young men without families. You couldn\'t tell when a Kaw would take it into his head to make off with a horse or a cow, though they were a chicken-gutted lot and not knee-high in any way, so Dick Summers said, to tribes like the Pawnees and Snakes and Blackfeet. Still, you didn\'t want them stealing your stock.

  Evans watched Rebecca, and by and by, just to make conversation, he said, "I don\'t hardly feel like we\'ve started yet. Way most of \'em act, you\'d think we was bushed in the mountains some place." Rebecca kept on fanning herself. "I could light out now afoot and be to the old place almost in time to do the chores."

     It seemed strange to him, come to think of it, that he called the farm the old place. He had just left it, just shook the hand of the man who had paid him four hundred dollars cash money for his quarter section. He had just driven away, seeing the patch of flax greening and the leaves of the young tobacco fleshing out in their bed. He had taken a last look at the cornfield, where the first frail spears would soon push up, and at the cabin where he and Rebecca had come really to know each other and where Brownie was born. And now in his mind it was the old place, and he felt a little sad at leaving it, as if a part of him and Rebecca and Brownie had been left forever behind. Give him a little time, though, get him across the Kaw and up the Little Blue to the Platte, and he would be all right. Already, seeing the hills and woods opening, he could imagine how it would be along the great, free desert of the Platte. Oregon and the new way of things. Oregon for America, you damn bet! He and others would take Oregon by occupation, and what could the British do then? He felt almost like an old-time Oregon man himself.

     "Feelin\' better, Becky?" he asked. "About goin\'?"

     She let him have a little smile. Her face looked hot but not fearful now. She had cried for a minute when they left the old place, and then had set her face west and not looked back. Evans had an uneasy feeling that he couldn\'t realize, ever, what it was for a woman to give up her home. They were finer drawn than men, women were, mixed more in their thinking, so that you couldn\'t tell what went on in their heads. A woman might hate moving because of leaving her marigolds. Yet he understood Rebecca, too, in ways; she would make the trip, and no complaining, either, and her talk cheerful and her clever hands doing what was to be done.

     "I\'m all right, Lije," she answered. "Hot, is all. Why you ask? Changed your mind?"

     "Not me. Anyone at all gets to Oregon, it\'ll be you and me."

     Her voice was soft. "You\'re the biggest fool, Lije."

     He knew what she meant. She meant it still struck her queer that he should bow his neck for Oregon and feel better all the time for doing it. Well, it was queer. An old plug didn\'t often

  prance.

     She said, "Hello, there, Dick," and Evans saw that Dick Summers was strolling up. In the old buckskin breeches and red­checked shirt he had put on, Dick was something. Tall, silver­haired, strong-looking in arm and leg and body, he was a man to catch the eye, different from anyone Evans knew, different from those who traveled the Santa Fe trail, from the Mexicans who dressed to show off. There wasn\'t any show-off in Dick. He was just himself.

     "I\'d think you\'d melt to a grease spot," Rebecca said, looking at the buckskins.

     "I reckon I got ahead of myself, sure enough."

     She said, "It\'s the sun got ahead of itself, Dick."

     "Hell of a mess," Evans put in, making a wide sweep of his hand, to the wagons, tents, people, talk, horses, oxen, everything. "Some\'ll be turnin\' back."

     Summers put tobacco in his pipe. "It\'ll straighten out, likely."

     "Tadlock\'s the big toad," Evans said.

     "Looks so. Got such a start nobody else\'ll stand."

     "Maybe he\'ll make a good-enough captain?"

     Summers nodded as if he didn\'t quite agree. "Have to keep a tight line on him." He pulled on his pipe while his keen gray eyes went over the layout.

     "Wants to kill all the dogs, down to my old Rock." Summers went on smoking.

     "That\'s what I hear on the quiet, anyhow. He won\'t come out for it open, I don\'t guess. Might cost him votes." Evans put his words so as to be questions. "They say dogs can\'t make it anyhow? Say they\'d give us away to the Injuns?"

     Summers looked at Rebecca, the faint tracks of a smile on his face. "They make good meat if food runs out."

    "Ah-h!"

     "The Sioux eat pup, and I\'ve chewed a few. Taste like hog meat."

     "Sure enough, Dick," Evans asked, "you think we ought to kill the dogs?"

     "Be hell to pay."

     "I know, but you think we ought?"

     "Dog can go where a cow can."

     "I hadn\'t thought of that."

     "And they won\'t give us away any more\'n they\'ll put us on guard." Summers was silent for a minute. "Mighty hard thing to sneak into an Injun camp, on account of the dogs."

     "Tadlock wouldn\'t know about that. We got to ejicate him." Evans got out his own pipe. He was filling it when the horn sounded high and strong above the clatter, calling the men to the election.

  Evans and Summers walked toward the center of the camp, where the men were gathering. On the way, Evans saw the file of dogs again. A little boy, cotton-topped and thin, was following them. Evans heard a voice call, "Toddie! Come here, Tod." The voice belonged to Mrs. Fairman, a long-legged, well-turned girl with light hair and eyes as pale as pond water. She walked out and got the boy by the hand.

     Nearly everybody in camp collected for the election, the men standing in front, chewing and spitting, and the women behind and the young ones open-eared on the fringes. Because he had been chosen temporary captain -or commandant captain, he called it- Tadlock brought the meeting to order. He stepped up on a wooden bucket and beat a spoon against a tin plate to gett silence. When the talk had toned down some, he pitched into his speech, standing square on the bucket. Everything about him was square, Evans thought -square face, square body, square way of standing. Evans wondered if he was square inside, too, while he admitted to himself that Tadlock made a figure, the teeth showing white, the face tanned on the cheek­bones and blue-black at the jaw with the roots of beard, the eyes bold, the arms moving easy. He might be an all-right man. It bothered Evans to think maybe he wasn\'t. He didn\'t like to think bad of folks.

     Tadlock was saying, "Our company, I have reason to believe, will be the first out anywhere. The St. Joe trains, we hear, won\'t roll for several days. So it appears we\'ll be the trail blazers -and also escape the dust of the desert, find grass for our animals, and arrive first at the Willamette."

     Some of the men yelled at his words, and he closed his mouth, giving them time for their hurrahs. When they were finished, someone kept shouting, "Chairman! Mr. Chairman!"

     It was Brother Weatherby, crowding through toward the bucket. The old preacher had put on his rusty coat, though he must have been hot in it. The cracked voice rose: "We had no prayer. We didn\'t open with prayer."

     Back of Weatherby someone said, "Sit down! Christ sake!" and another voice answered, "I kin remember my pap braggin\' Sunday\'d never cross the Mississippi." Other men were muttering or just grinning, but the women, Evans noticed when he looked around, mostly were nodding their heads, thinking Weatherby was right.

     Tadlock wasn\'t fazed at all. He said, "I\'m sorry, Brother Weatherby. It was an oversight. Will you lead us in prayer?" He bent his head.

     Weatherby bent his head, too, and by and by raised his arms. He asked God to be merciful to poor sinners. He said they knew the way was long and dangerous, but they put their trust in Him. . . . We pray Thee to protect us against the elements and against the heathen and the wild beasts, and against sickness and accidents, and to give us strength for the journey and to make our hearts stout, whatever may come to pass. ... And make us grateful, too, 0 Lord, for all Thy blessings and lead us to know Thy glory and make the sinner to repent and the swearer to see his wickedness and the man and woman in adultery to understand their sin and do it no more. ... We pray Thee to breathe the influence of Thy spirit on us and make us all Christians. . . . God bless the little children whom Jesus said let come unto Him. . . . And may the storm hold back its fury as the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb, and may the earth give up its abundance. . . . Make us to fear Thee and to sing Thy eternal praise. . . . Amen. Amen.

     What with one thing and another, Weatherby took a long time talking to God, time enough for an ant to crawl from the toe of Dick Summers\' moccasin a distance of two ax handles, not counting the backings up and the side trips along spears of grass. Evans sneaked a look at Summers while the preaching was going on and saw his head hardly bowed and his eyes empty with distance. He wondered whether Summers believed in God at all. Not that it made any difference. Any God worth praying to would know Dick Summers for a good man, even if he didn\'t bow and scrape and make little of himself and beg for blessings regardless. Evans didn\'t guess Summers ever would beg for anything, not even from God.

     When Weatherby was through, Tadlock said, "We have rules to adopt and a permanent organization to set up."

     Another voice was yelling at him. Tadlock tried to drown it out and then to hush it with his hand, but it kept piping up. Finally Tadlock asked, "What is it, Turley?"

     Evans moved around so as to see Turley. Turley had joined the company late, from the hill and pine country of the Meramec. The words came high-pitched from his thin mouth. "\'Pears to me the first thing is to think again, do we want to go on or wait for some that ain\'t quite ready? This here\'s a small train. Ain\'t enough growed men in it, to my way o\' thinkin\'. Where we be, meetin\' the Pawnees or Sioux? There\'s a passel of people comin\', like we all know, hunderds of \'em. Doc Welch of Indiany said we could j\'in him. Told me so hisself. I say let\'s wait. Be a hunderd wagons along directly."

     Hoots and hollers arose all around, more hoots than hollers.

     "Quiet! Orderl" Tadlock roared, beating on the plate. His voice sharpened as the noise died. "This has all been thrashed out. Anyone who joined this company knew we planned to start early to get there first. Our company\'s big enough. Twenty­two wagons, nearly thirty armed men." His arm came out, pointing. "Ask Dick Summers there. He knows. He\'ll tell you a company can be too big, so big that it\'s slow and hard to manage." He looked at Turley. "Anyone who\'s afraid can wait. We\'re going on. That\'s settled."

     Turley shuffled while more voices sounded out. Evans imagined it was Mrs. Turley who had egged him on. Tadlock was all business. "Is the committee ready to report?" he asked as if he didn\'t know.

     Mack answered, "It is," and stepped forward with the wrinkles of thinking on his face and said, "Your committee recommends that Irvine Tadlock be elected captain and Charles Fairman lieutenant, and Henry Shields captain of the livestock guard, each to serve to the end of the trail."

     An Illinois German named Brewer made a motion to accept the report, and Hank McBee, speaking loud out of his mangy beard, seconded the motion.

     Tadlock made as if to step down from the bucket, saying, "Will someone preside? It isn\'t right for me to," but the voices went up in yells of "Yes" and "Keep the stump" and "Whoa, there," and Tadlock put his foot back on the bucket and asked, "Well, if it\'s unanimous?" He got more yells for an answer.

     "Thank you. Thank you all. I\'ll do my very best. Is there a further report then?"

     There was. Mack read it off. Evans, listening with just half his mind, heard it in snatches. . . . Recommend the train be called the On-to-Oregon Outfit. . . . Recommend a governing council of six be elected.... Recommend tax to pay expenses, including two hundred dollars for the pilot. . . . Recommend no ardent spirits be taken, except for medical purposes. ... Require wagons be capable of carrying a quarter more than their load, teams of drawing a quarter more. . . . Death for murder. . . . Thirty-nine lashes for three days for rape. ... Thirty-nine lashes on the bare back for adultery and fornication (big-sounding words for something simple). . . . Council to fix penalty for indecent language. . . . Recommend train start at <<seven|9g>> o\'clock every morning and travel from ten to fifteen miles every day. . . .

  A long list, that made Summers snort once. Evans\' attention strayed off, to Mack, to Fairman, to McBee, to Brewer, and off to one side, beyond the men, to the girl, Mercy McBee, who wore a red poke bonnet and stood, her eyes fluid above the pale planes of her cheeks, like a young doe that had heard a noise. Sadness in the face, or maybe only emptiness. A look to squeeze a man inside. In animals you knew what you\'d get, crossing scrubs. Question was, did the scrubs cross or a good stud get in the pasture? More likely she was scrub, too, underneath. Thirty­nine lashes for fornication. That was a warning, aimed mostly by the married men at the single ones who\'d been engaged to help out on the trip.

     Brother Weatherby was wanting to add to the list, asking that the company go "on the moral code written by God in the breast of every man."

     A little smile was on Tadlock\'s face. He knew better than to laugh, but he knew to smile, too, letting on it was best, if a little overdone, to give the preacher man some rope.

     The man back of Evans muttered, "Make the old fool shut up. Wants to make the rules, and him without a pot to piss in."

     Mack read some more. . . . Require provisions in the following amounts . . . two hundred pounds of flour per person, except for infants . . . seventy-five pounds of meal ... fifty pounds of bacon. . . . Name three inspectors, to look over wagons and supplies. ... Move report be adopted.... Aye....

     The voice at Evans\' back said, "That\'ll fix the preacher."

     It occurred to Evans that the rules didn\'t go far enough yet. Nothing had been said about cattle and how many head to a driver. Some men, like Tadlock himself, had a big bunch of those cattle and some had no more than their teams and a milk cow or two. It wasn\'t fair, expecting each man to take turn about when some had more than others. He had a notion to speak up, when Tadlock said, "Many things will have to be worked out as we go along. If we have trouble, the council can settle it. The thing now is immediate organization, so that we can make a start."

     The words were fair, and Evans found himself feeling a little guilty. There wasn\'t any cause to doubt Tadlock, once you got used to his way. He was a man who liked to take things inhand -and there wasn\'t anything wrong with that. Like Tadlock had told Summers the night before the funeral, someone had to take responsibility. Tadlock was all right, except for his fool idea about dogs. Nobody had said anything about dogs yet.

     "Any more business?"

     It came then. McBee moved that the dogs be left behind or killed. Hearing him, seeing the words shaped by a mouth bushed around like a terrier\'s, Evans knew McBee had been put up to it. And he knew, too, of a sudden, that McBee always would side with the top dog. Let Tadlock be upset, and you\'d find McBee honey-fuggling the upsetters.

     Was there a second?

     Again it was Brewer, the Illinois man, the German, who spoke. Dogs couldn\'t travel all dey vay to Oregon. Dogs vould be signal to Indians, yah. Second da motion.

     Tongues all around were wagging. Yes. No. No. Yes. By God, I\'d like to see anyone kill my dog! Reckon the fool German never heard of a watchdog. Who in hell wants a dog?

     Tadlock beat on the pan. "Let\'s thrash this out."

     A half dozen people spoke, one after another, trying to lift their voices above the arguments that were going on all around -McBee, Fairman, Brewer again, a Yankee named Patch, Evans himself. McBee said, \'y God yes, shoot the dogs. They weren\'t no real good to nobody. Just made more mess to step in. Fairman said let each man do as he pleased, it wasn\'t a thing for company action.

     Evans shouted, "Ask Dick Summers! Ask Dick!He knows more\'n anyone."

     More beating on the pan. "All right, Summers. Speak up!"

     Summers seemed a little uneasy, talking to a crowd. He hitched his leather breeches. "It don\'t make a heap of difference. Some dogs\'ll get through; some maybe won\'t. Anyhow, a dead dog\'s no loss but to the man that owns him."

     By grab, that was so, Evans thought. People argued a dog couldn\'t make the trip and everyone took that as a good reason, like they took other talk, until a man like Dick showed it didn\'t

  hold water.

     Summers went on, "Dogs\'ll tell the camp about Injuns just as quick, and maybe quicker, than they\'ll give us away. Me, I don\'t look for Injun trouble anyhow, except for beggin\' and a little stealin\'. Injuns ain\'t likely to light into a party as big as this one, not the Injuns we\'ll come up against."

     Tadlock ran his hand along his jaw while the talk broke out again. After a little while he tapped on the plate. "I\'m thinking more just of the bother of dogs," he said. "They\'re a nuisance. They\'ll slow up the train. They\'ll be underfoot in the mornings, and they\'ll get hurt and lost and cause delay, I\'m afraid. At any rate, let\'s vote."

     You couldn\'t be sure, by voices, which side had won, but after Tadlock had called for a show of hands and counted them careful, he said the motion had carried. He didn\'t push it further, though. He didn\'t say who was to do the killing and when. Evans figured he would have some business with the man who came to shoot Rock. The prospect troubled him. He liked things peaceful.

     While he was thinking about it, Tadlock went on with the clection of a council and the naming of inspectors. It was a little to Evans\' surprise that he found himself on both lists. The crowd elected him to the council, and Tadlock named him an inspector. When he had had time to reckon, though, it was natural enough. What Tadlock aimed at was to work everyone over to his side. By one thing and another, he figured to get the most of them in the same bed with him.

     Well, anyhow, the business was about done. Evans looked it ound and saw that Brownie had ridden up on his mule, and then he glanced back to the stretch of prairie where the animals grazed and saw the mules and horses hobbled or pinned out and the oxen resting safe, and he knew, as he knew all along, that Brownie could be depended on.

     His gaze came back to Brownie. The boy was sitting his mule quiet, his eyes fixed, on his young face an unhidden, troubled, hankering look, as if he stood alone and saw now and for the first time all it was a man might hope for. Before he turned his head, Evans knew what Brownie saw. It was the girl, Mercy McBee, with her sad, watching face and her red poke bonnet and the two little hills of her breasts showing against her linsey­woolsey.

     For a long minute Evans stared at her, and then back at his boy. They were about of an age, the only two, as luck would have it, who looked like seventeen. The look on Brownie\'s face was like the look on the man Mack\'s, when first he\'d seen the girl. It was like it, and still far different, being gentle and young and unknowing, not thinking of bed alone and maybe not at all, but of tenderness and beauty and happiness, so much of it the heart flowed over.

     Evans turned away. Damned if he wasn\'t building things in his mind, out of nothing, you might say, out of his own feelings of long ago. But good God! Scrub stock. Marry into scrub stock, and it was all right! Call Hank McBee pappy and Mrs. McBee ma and have \'em on your hands all your life and everything was fine. But they whipped you for fornication. Thirty-nine lashes.',

            'Curtis Mack didn\'t talk to Amanda, not as man to wife, or encourage her to talk to him. Not these days. Not, he hoped, ever again. They said what had to be said. And sometimes she tried the idle things, weather or mud or dust, and he answered shortly and saw the hurt in her face and was glad of it, and that was all.

     It would be all, he told himself as the train rolled on toward the Little Blue and the tension built up in him. He wouldn\'t bemean himself again. Let her save it, and to hell with it! He wouldn\'t beg as he had begged that night after they had crossed the Kaw.

     Spring had been in the air, and a night bird cried outside the tent, and a breeze played along the canvas, and he wanted her, as so many times before.

     "No, Curt," she said. "Please!"

     "It\'s been a long time."

    She pushed his seeking hand away. "Please."

     "Why not?"

     "I\'m afraid."

     "Afraid?"

     "Yes."

     "Of what?"

     "You know."

     "You\'ve never been that way yet."

     "I could be -and then having no doctor or anything."

     "You\'re just using that as an excuse." She didn\'t answer.

     "You never have really wanted to."

     "I know you think that."

     "You think it isn\'t ladylike, I guess. A lady isn\'t interested."

     "Curt!"

     "Back home you never wanted to. It\'s always been a case of rape."

     "That isn\'t true."

     "It\'s close enough." He was silent for a long minute and then, with the urgency mounting in him, he let himself plead. "Please, Amanda. I\'m sorry. Now please."

     "I can\'t."

     "I\'ve been patient, but I can\'t go on forever. Please."

     "I can\'t. I\'m afraid."

     The edge came back into his voice. "You mean not ever, while we\'re traveling?"

     "I don\'t know."

     "My Godl You\'re going to quit being the half a wife which was the best you ever were. Is that it?"

     Her voice was small. "I can\'t help it, Curt."

     "You mean you won\'t."

     She was crying, crying softly, the sobs shaking her. Now, more than ever, he wanted her, wanted the hot, wet cheek against his, and the wounded mouth, and the body yielding and being comforted -except that it wouldn\'t be.

     Another man would have forced her to him. He would have taken her, yes or no. A wife without desire still had a duty. But he wouldn\'t do it, not Curtis Mack, late of Buffalo, New York, who was built of soft stuff, who had to recognize, beyond his fury, that something stood in her way that he couldn\'t understand. The recognizing made him madder. Why would God put beauty in a woman\'s face and give her full breasts and fine thighs and then withhold warmth?

     "If you had been a real wife," he said, "we\'d have stayed in Buffalo."

     She didn\'t try to answer.

     "Why do you think I quit business and started west?" She kept silent.

     "To quit stewing, that\'s why. To get things off my mind."

     "You exaggerate so."

     "That was at the bottom of it."

     Her answer was more crying.

     "What you want for a husband is a damn monk."

     She cried out, "Why do you say those things? We love each other. We have so much to live for."

     "I\'ll never ask you again," he said, and hated himself, not for the lie he had spoken but for the weakness in him that made it a lie. He had said the same thing before, and then she had come to him, and he had forgotten resentment and lost his fury and, relaxed in the warm and rumpled bed, had spoken his love for her. He had asked forgiveness and laid the blame on himself for times like tonight\'s. Soft stuff, Curtis Mack, weak, unstable and -all right- sensual. Was anything wrong with sensuality? What was wrong was her tyranny over him. What was wrong was that he couldn\'t help himself and was light-spirited or surly, depending on the grant or refusal of so small a favor.

     He said, "You drive me to other women."

     "I don\'t mean to, Curt."

     "I can\'t help looking at them and thinking. I\'ll find another woman, too."

     "If that\'s what you want."

     "What do you care? You don\'t want me."

     "If that\'s what you want."

     "Want, hell!" He lurched over in bed. "You ought to have married a steer."

     Lying there, hearing her soft weeping, feeling with a fierce pleasure the spasms of her body, he told himself he would find another woman. He wanted to be faithful, and she made it impossible, and so he would throw his restraints aside. He would get out of the mold he\'d been cast in. People like his parents, lecturing him about sin! People like preachers, like old Brother Weatherby, preaching against evil! People like these emigrants, fixing lashes as punishment for fornication and adultery! All the men lustful and all fearful, one of another, wanting to save what they had for themselves but maybe to sneak a little on the side. But suppose a man had nothing, or next to nothing?

     He would find himself a woman, he would wrench loose from the morality that had been ground into him. He swore it to himself, resisting, while he swore, the doubt that he could, pushing aside the forethought of a conscience so guilty it might unman him.

     The night bird still called outside, and the breeze still played along the tent. He heard the sneeze of a horse and the distant mooing of a cow. And steady to his ears came the sweep and mutter of the Kaw.

     They had crossed the river that day and moved upstream to a piece of open prairie that lay along the bank. He made the scenes pass in his mind, like a gloss over his fury. They had decided against the ferry because so many of the train were poor, and had had Dick Summers lead them to a crossing. He saw Dick Summers now, riding boldly into the river, exploring it for the best passage. He saw the wagons rolling into it, the oxen blowing water, and the tight wagons like his own riding easy. Summers and a crew snaked up logs for some of the others, like McBee\'s, and lashed them to the boxes, making houseboats of a kind. A band of Kaw Indians, curious and intrusive as goats, ran on the bank and splashed in the water, their blankets and feathers and odds and ends of calico shirts showing vivid against the new green of the land. Others paddled back and forth in rough dugouts, ferrying women and children across and the supplies that had been unloaded to lighten the wagons. \' Their pay was tobacco and beads and pieces of old clothing and,   it developed later, whatever they could get their hands on and make away with.

     Now, as then, Mack let himself look at the women and speculate about them -at Judith Fairman, a pale, tall, pretty girl, long-legged and graceful but a little flat in the bosom; at the little New Englander, Mrs. Patch, who might hide something behind that matter-of-factness; at Mrs. Tadlock, who was quiet and, in a quiet way, comely; at Rebecca Evans, a sociable and good-humored woman with a front like a butt of hay; at Mrs. Brewer, who had borne ten children and looked it. He saved the best until last. Then he let Mercy McBee come to his sight. Dark hair and white skin. Young breasts. Mouth young. Eyes eloquent of something, of sadness like hunger, or hunger like sadness. She wouldn\'t know about things, but she could be taught.

     He couldn\'t look at Amanda as another man might. He could describe her. He could say she was fair and medium tall, that she had a good form, that her face was oval and her eyes wide apart and more green than brown when you looked close -but he couldn\'t see her as another man might. Would another man see her differently if he knew she was cold?

     Were the others cold? Did the other men have their troubles and go to sleep hungry and sore? Were women like Mrs. Brewer just more obliging or really more ardent? Thou shalt not covet -but he let himself play with the idea of having one of them, of having one who yielded eagerly and tenderly in a secret bed or along a green bank in a screen of willows. Tenderly. That was the word. Maybe what a man wanted, more than anything else, was just tenderness. Amanda couldn\'t be tender, not out­wardly. It wasn\'t in her. You knew she loved you because of things unsaid, of gestures half completed, of feelings indirectly shown, of favors given with restraint. And, damn it, it wasn\'t enough.

     He wrenched the thought of her out of his mind and went back to the river to watch the crossing. The women and wagons and supplies had gone over, and the cattle and loose work stock were footing down the bank, led by Dick Summers and pushed and kept in line by horsemen white and red. The leaders took to the water and the others followed, and now they were swimming, making a long, eyed line in the sweeping current.

     It was an easy crossing. Not an animal lost, or a barrel or a box or a sack, except for small things that the Kaws sneaked away. It was a crossing to make a man jubilant, to make him playful, to make him want his wife.

     Mack reared up in bed, pulling the cover from Amanda. "No use to snivel," he said, and got up and pulled on his pants. He couldn\'t sleep tonight.

     He walked around the tents that ringed the corral made by the wagons. He could feel rather than see the horses hobbled or picketed inside the corral. The camp was quiet, except now and then for a mutter, or the hard breath of a man lying on his back, or the sudden, frightened cry of a dreaming child. The fires had died down. Overhead the stars seemed few but big. In their light the wagon tops swam against the dark. A wolf howled somewhere. Or it might have been an Indian. He had heard that Indians imitated wolves sometimes, or wore the hides of elk, while they stole in to make away with stock. He brought his rifle into the crook of his arm.

     Someone said, "Hello, hoss," and he knew it was Summers. He made him out by the ghost-white of his buckskins and saw he was seated in the clear, where he could watch.

     "Don\'t you ever sleep?"

     "Slept enough, farmin\', to last me the rest of my life. I reckon."

     "I thought farmers were up early and late."

     "Nothin\' like followin\' a mule to rest the mind."

     Mack imagined Summers wasn\'t resting much tonight. While he talked, he still kept listening, still kept looking, as if conversation didn\'t any more than touch his surface.

     "Expecting trouble?" Mack asked.

     "Maybe not. Those pore Kaws, though, they get hungry and cold. And stealin\'s fun to an Injun."

     Mack said, "Damn nuisances," and felt a little surprise when Summers answered, "They got their ways, like we got ours. I reckon we\'re a heap big nuisance to them."

     "I can\'t see it," Mack answered, though he did. He put an edge in his tone. "They\'ll have to learn."

     He waited, but Summers answered only, "Reckon so."

     "I\'m going to have a look at the cattle."

     The grass was new and soft underfoot, so that, even in factory shoes, he could walk as quietly as an Indian himself. The cattle would be to the north, away from the river. He took his bearings and confirmed them, idly, by lining up the side of the Dipper with the North Star. After a while he saw movement ahead and called out and walked on up and found the movement to be the boy, Brownie Evans, whom he had hired to help with the cattle.

     "All quiet?"

     "Critters are kind of scary."

     Mack narrowed his eyes and saw the cattle, a darker patch against the dark slope. "Wonder why?"

     "Injun smell, I figger."

     "Any sign of Indians?"

     "Not unless it\'s them wolves."

     "Nearly time for the next watch, isn\'t it?"

     "Be a spell yet."

     "Who\'s out, besides you?"

     "Holdridge and McBee and Patch, with the cattle. Summers wanted a strong guard tonight."

     "Right."

     "Summers says sometimes thievin\' Injuns make out to be wolves."

     "You\'ll have to watch out."

     "Says he\'s seen \'em do it, but maybe the Kaws won\'t. Not much grit in their gizzards."

     "You watch, just the same."

     "Sure. Dick says any time you get over the Kaw you better look out. This here\'s Delaware country."

     "Delaware?"

     "But it\'s the Pawnees you have to keep your eyes skinned for."

     "Does Summers know everything?"

     "Why," the boy said, "I s\'pose not, but he knows a store of things."

     Mack liked Summers and he liked Brownie, but still he was prompted to say, "You\'d think from the talk that no one had any sense but Summers."

     Brownie didn\'t answer. With a boy\'s deference to his elders he kept quiet, but Mack knew he was resentful, as he wanted him to be.

     A star streamed down the western sky, and, as if glad for its excuse, Brownie asked, "You reckon that star hit in Oregon, Mr. Mack?"

     Before Mack could answer, a rifle cracked at the far side of the herd. The sound of it died into a sharp, thinking silence.

     Brownie jerked his rifle up. "Injuns! Injuns!"

     "Listen!"

     What Mack heard was the camp shouting, shouting out across the darkness. He heard the clank of ox chains and the sound of running.

     Off beyond the dark blob of the cattle another rifle spurted fire and boomed above the shouting. The cattle were climbing to their feet. Mack could see the close ones struggling up. They stood dark in the night, the breath loud in their nostrils. Farther on, the edges of the blob began to flux.

     Lije Evans\' voice was bellowing, "Brownie? Where you, Brownie?"

     "Here. Here, Pa."

     Evans came pounding up, and behind him a straggle of men.

     A rifle cracked again.

     Mack heard the gun, and then the sound of hoofs. The dark patch was flowing into a string, and the head of the string was running, drawing the rest after it.

     Someone yelled, "Goddam! There they go."

     "Horses! Get horses!"

     "No. Can\'t head \'em." Mack knew Summers\' voice.

     "Get horses, I told you."

     The head of the string was lost to the eye. "No! Wait!"

     Summers stood before Mack. "Injuns? You see Injuns?"

     Mack said, "No."

     "Critters was uneasy," Brownie put in.

     Mack couldn\'t see the cattle now. The sound of their hoofs was a far drumming. Above it he heard the sudden voices of the other sentinels.

     Summers asked them, "Injuns?"

     " \'Y God, yes," McBee answered.

     "Sure?"

     "No," Patch said.

     "I seen one. <<One|9k:0>>, or a wolf," Holdridge added. Tadlock shouldered ahead. "Get horses, damn it."

     "Hold up!"

     "What\'s wrong with you, Summers? You want to hold a meeting?"

     Summers didn\'t answer, but Lije Evans spoke out, "Leave it to Dick."

     "Summers isn\'t captain. Get your horses!"

     Summers spoke then, spoke with something in his voice that Mack liked but still resisted. "Don\'t forgit yourself, hoss."

     "I\'m not forgetting those cattle."

     Patch\'s tone was mild. "Most of them are yours."

     "Goddam it! What\'s that got to do with it? You want to lose yours?"

     The men had crowded into a close bunch. A half dozen of them were trying to talk. Summers\' words rose above the rest. "Rules say it\'s up to me to call a war party."

     Tadlock faced up to him. "Call it then!"

     Mack spoke without thinking, spoke, he knew later, out of temper and hunger for a fight. "Rules be damned, I say, if they don\'t work."

     Summers stepped up to him. "Mack," he said quietly, so quietly that everybody listened, "these here could be Pawnees, and, besides, I don\'t aim to send green men out at night, even against Kaws." He paused as if to let his words sink in. "You\'ll get more cattle back, come daylight, than you can now."

     Summers faced around to address the others. "I\'ll be the war party. You all watch the wagons." He didn\'t say any more. He faded out like a shadow. One minute Mack saw him, ghost-like in his buckskins, and then he caught the glimmer of him moving off, and then he was lost, lost in darkness, lost in the sudden pressing emptiness, lost on the brooding land.

     After a minute the talk picked up, but Mack didn\'t wait to hear it. He would be a war party himself, a one-man, green-man war party, riding with his anger, riding like a fool to dull the edge of it, and maybe meeting Indians and fighting them and so spending himself in another way than with a woman. A man got so he found his pleasure in being crazy and perverse -but he never could explain to Amanda how it was. If he could, it wouldn\'t make any difference, not with Amanda.

     Some of the women ran out to meet him, a squall of alarm, of questions, of entreaties. They pulled at his sleeves and ran around to face him again after he had passed them. "Everything\'s all right. I said everything\'s all right." Others waited at the corral, wanting to know, too, and he said, "It\'s all right," and went on, hardly looking at them, hating them, all of them, because they were women. Mrs. Turley was crying, "I knowed we shouldn\'t\'ve come. I knowed it." He stepped over a wagon tongue and got away.

     The fires outside the corral had been replenished, and the flames licked in the big eyes of the horses, which were standing high-headed, uneasy with the general uneasiness. He caught his saddle horse and led it over and tied it to the wheel of his wagon and threw a saddle on it. Then he loosened the ox chains between his two wagons and pulled the tongue aside and led the horse out, putting the tongue and chains back afterwards.

     When he turned around, he saw Amanda. "What are you going to do, Curt?"

     "Hunt Indians."

     Her face looked pale and drawn in the firelight, and shadowed with sorrow. "Alone?"

     When he didn\'t answer, she said, "You don\'t know Indians, Curt."

     He put his foot in the stirrup. "Know one when I see one."

     "I wouldn\'t go."

     "Wouldn\'t, eh?"

     "Please!"

       Please. Please hell! For her please she would get what he got for his.

     He turned his horse and heard her "Please be careful," and realized that it was partly, maybe mainly, to distress her that he went out on this crazy business. He didn\'t care about that, either. And he couldn\'t help it. The horse stumbled as he kicked him into the darkness.

     Unguided, the horse rounded the corral and made for the river and lowered his head and drank and raised it, savoring the water, and let the breath rattle in his nostrils.

     It was darker here in the growth. Mack felt the trees shouldering him. Even the river ran dark, dark to the black band of the far shore. A bright star shone on its moving bosom. Looking up, he saw the same star in the sky. The words of Scripture went through his head: "When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy." He could remember reading them as a child and being moved by them, back in the church that had left its scars on him.

     He reined his horse out from the water and walked him clear of the trees and struck west, riding hard in the direction he remembered the cattle had taken.

     Nothing happened. The Great Dipper wheeled in the sky and a star dropped and wolves howled and the horse stumbled and got his head jerked back for it,, and nothing happened, except that the horse began to wheeze. Let him wheeze! Let him labor! Let him run his heart out and his lungs! Getup! Amanda would have protested; she believed in kindness to dumb animals. Getup!

     He was far out when, faint as something imagined, he heard rifle fire downstream, from the direction of camp. He pulled his horse up, alarm leaping in him, thinking, before he had time to regulate his thoughts, of Indians and the camp and Amanda without him to protect her; and then it occurred to him that it must be <<four o\'clock|6>> and the sentinels would be firing to rouse the camp for the day\'s journey. He kicked his horse into a lope.

     Nothing happened. He rode on another mile and turned and began crisscrossing back toward camp, and a flush came into the sky, and light, and he saw he was on a low bald ridge above the river. The camp was lost somewhere down the stream. He started for it.

     He was close enough to hear the echo of voices, sounding thin in the chill of morning, when he saw the Indian in the tree. At first he took him for a big coon, or maybe a bear, and then, coming closer, he made out the shaved head with its comb of hair and the blanket gathered around the shoulders. From his vantage point above the lower growth the Indian was watching the camp. He was holding to his perch and watching.

     Mack stopped his horse. The Indian had no gun and no bow that Mack could see. He would.have a bow though, if not a musket, hidden by his body or the folds of his blanket.

     Mack dismounted and tied his horse and walked ahead, stepping soft. He began to feel the blood beating in him, and the breath light and quick in his throat.

     At this range he couldn\'t miss. He had only to raise his rifle and line up the sights and squeeze the trigger. He couldn\'t miss, not if he chose to shoot.

     He looked around for other Indians and saw none, and listened and heard, far off from pulse and breath, the voices of women cooking breakfast and the deeper tones of men catching tip their teams.

  Even with the blood thumping in him and his lungs working, he couldn\'t miss, not if he fired. There was the barrel lifting and the sights lining up and the finger waiting on the trigger.

     The Indian turned, his sharp face composed but watchful, and his eyes ran over the back country. Mack saw them nearing, saw them widen and fix in the shocked instant of finding him. They cried out. The eyes, the wordless mouth, the whole face cried, "Please! Please!"

     The Indian dropped as the rifle cracked. He didn\'t shout or thug out. He hung for a bare instant, the please fading from his face, and then he dropped.

     Mack ran up. The Indian was dead all right, dead as a damn doornail. He lay crumpled in the bushes with his old blanket and his proud wisp of hair, face turned up, mouth loose -a runty, thin man with scars on him and the marks of hunger, a Kaw who had asked please and got his answer, and now wouldn\'t have to ask any more or go without, either.

     Mack stood for a long minute, hearing the camp hushed and then noisy with the alarm his shot had raised. A louse worked in the tuft of hair, and a small breeze fanned it. Watching, Mack felt fatigue dragging at him, felt loneliness and regret creeping on him and bearing him down. Now, unaccountably, he wanted to talk to Amanda.',

            'TIME WE GET to the Platte, we can figure we\'ve made a start," Dick Summers said.

     Lije Evans answered, "Uh-huh," thinking that in Dick\'s eyes already was the look of the Platte, the look of distance, the look of far-off things brought close in memory.

     Evans squinted ahead, searching for the hills that people spoke of as the coasts of Nebraska. "It\'s the on\'y trip I ever made that it took the best part of a month to get started on," he said.

     He knew what Dick meant, though. He meant that once they reached the Platte they\'d be sure enough in a different country, sure enough on the real start to the mountains and to Oregon. He felt that way himself even though he never had been on the trail before and never seen the Platte except as his mind saw it from what people said. It would be a shallow, spreadout, sandy river with flat banks and no trees except on the islands, and it would run muddy from the feet of more buffalo than any wan could count.

     Patch rode along with him and Dick, Patch and Daugherty and Martin. Together they were scouting for Indians and picking out the way for the wagons that followed after. Dick carried a big rag with him and sometimes tore pieces from it and posted little flags across breaks and washes to show the lead teamster where to head. Now Patch said to Evans, "This would seem like more than a start if you had started from Massachusetts."

     "A man wouldn\'t think Oregon fever would carry so far," Evans answered.

     A little questioning smile came on Patch\'s face. "Ever hear of Hall Kelley or Captain Wyeth?"

     "Can\'t say as I did."

     Summers was nodding. "I knowed Wyeth. Creek back there a ways is named for him." Evans expected Dick to say more, but all Dick added was, "Good man." Looking at him, seeing the face marked by thought, Evans imagined his mind was far back, remembering Wyeth and the days that had gone before.

     Patch said, "Kelley and Wyeth puffed Oregon as much as anybody, especially Kelley. We had a touch of Oregon fever before others even knew about it." Patch, too, fell silent, his thin and sharp-nosed face wearing its usual look of quiet wide­awakeness. It was a Yankee face he had, Evans thought, but not a bad face even so.

     Evans turned in his saddle. Old Rock had just finished a scout into the bushes after some varmint or other and now trotted at the heels of the horses. A steady, quiet old dog, Rock was, who carried himself wise and dignified. Farther back of them, maybe a mile down the gradual slope they had climbed, he could see the wagon train winding, the gray-white train squirming in its haze of dust. The time was coming on <<toward noon|13>> and the train had straggled out. Behind the wagons came the loose horses and behind the horses the cattle, with riders back of them and to the sides, keeping them in line and pushing them along. Out from the wagon, to the windward side so as to be out of the dust, women and children were walking, walking and probably laughing and chattering and looking for wild flowers tough enough to grow on this dry ridge between the Little Blue and the Platte. It was cactus they\'d find, and thistle and low sage standing silverish in the sun. The only flowers they were likely to see were the little yellow-hearted daisies that could sprout from a stone -daisies and now and then one of the wild roses that were just beginning to bloom.

     In the high sun the colors made flashes through the dust -the white of the wagon covers, the red and white and black of the critters, the blue of a dress a woman had on. Evans saw a man walking along the line. It probably was Tadlock, trying to get the train to bunch up. He was a great one for order, a great one for orders, as far as that went, though he wasn\'t much horseman and so didn\'t ride ahead as often as a captain might. Evans wondered if he ever thought about the dogs he had wanted killed. A dog trailed him now, and a half dozen others paced along with the women and children and now and then made dashes to the side. Dogs traveled more miles than any horse or ox, but still they kept on.

     Evans could see his own two wagons, he thought, and a figure by one of them that he took for Rebecca. Brownie must be inside the second wagon, riding. He knew, with a little welling of secret pride, that Rebecca would be searching ahead for him, wanting him to be all right, just as he was searching back for her.

     This was one day, he thought, when Brownie wouldn\'t have to breathe so much dust. Mack had talked Shields into helping him once in a while, and today Shields was back with the cows. Evans never thought of Mack but he thought of the night of the stampede and the Indian Mack had shot. The shooting seemed like a cruel and useless thing from what he could make out of it, though some of the men laughed and said the Indian had got a case of falling sickness. You would think from listening to them that an Indian was no different from a varmint. Still, Mack seemed like a pretty good man, if a strange one.

     Evans turned back in the saddle. "Tadlock don\'t think we\'re doing so good," he said.

     "Tadlock eats too many beans," Patch said. He spoke as if he had turned things over in his mind and come to an answer no one could outtalk.

     Martin had come with Tadlock from Illinois. He said, "Tadlock\'s all right," and looked at Patch out of his dull eyes. He had a face that looked as if it knew it hadn\'t got any special favors when faces were divvied out. He walked and rode hunched over like a man on a cold day.

     Patch wasn\'t one to start a fight, though Evans imagined he could take care of himself if he had to. He didn\'t answer Martin.

     Evans said, "Maybe it ain\'t such a bad thing to have someone like him pushin\'."

     "That\'s what I say," Martin put in.

     "Like he says, someone has to take charge."

     The grin took the bite out of Dick\'s words. "He don\'t have to take it like God hisself had give it to him. Eh, Daugherty?"

     Daugherty didn\'t join in the talk. He never did talk much, though Irish was written plain on his face. He went along silent, a blue-eyed, fair-complected man whose cheeks burned under the sun and wind and then peeled off like a snake skin and then burned again. He wore an old red hunting shirt and carried a flintlock his daddy must have hunted with as a boy in western Virginia.

     "Long time ago," Dick said, "I pulled loose from the notion that what galled me or puked me was good for me, body or soul."

     "Best not let Brother Weatherby hear you," Evans told him.

     "What cured me," Dick said, just making talk, "was Injun physic."

     Patch asked, "Injun physic?"

     "It was brewed from a root, and it would gag a hog. My ma would grab me by the nose, and when I opened my mouth to breathe, she would pour it down, a tin cup to a dose. She figured it must be good because it tasted so bad."

     "And was it?" Patch asked.

     "Like doctors," Dick went on. "They figure the less life in you the less disease, never stoppin\' to think the less life you got the less misery you can stand."

     "You\'re talking about bleeders?"

     "Bleeders and physickers and all. Trouble with gettin\' sick is can you live through the cure."

     Patch smiled as if he didn\'t think Dick believed what he was saying. "Did the Indian physic help?"

     "It done what it was aimed to do. It overdone it. Take a dose of it, and there better be a bush close."

     "So maybe it was good."

     "Not to my way of thinkin\'. Oncet I swallowed a piece of money, and money was skeerce with us, so Ma dug her up a root and b\'iled it and got the tea inside me, and don\'t you know that money came out so sick it wouldn\'t spend!"

     Patch asked, "Well?"

     "The store man said it was counterfeit. Said it rang hollow. I knowed it would. That Injun physic would take the insides out of anything."

     Daugherty laughed for once, and Patch grinned while he sized up Dick, as if he\'d never come across the likes of Dick hefore. After a while he said, "So you mean Tadlock\'s like Indian physic?"

     "The talk just put me in mind of the physic was all."

     "Take away Tadlock," Evans said, "and we\'d have nary a thing to chew on."

     He hadn\'t meant to stop the conversation, but it stopped, nobody bothering to say they could still talk about Indians or about turning back or about waiting up until another train joined theirs. In camp there were always people wanting to do this or that, wanting to do anything except to go on in the way they had decided in the first place.

     The five of them rode along quiet, and the only sounds under all the bright sky were the little sounds of the horses walking and the saddles squeaking.

     Dick picked out the nooning place. It would be a dry camp, here on the dividing ridge, and what water was used would have to come from the kegs they had filled that morning. There wasn\'t supposed to be any water all the way from the head of the Little Blue to the Platte, but Dick had known where a trickle of it was, a couple of miles off the trail, and had taken them to it for a camping place last night. It occurred to Evans again how lucky they were to have Dick. Without him they would have had to travel dry for the whole twenty-five miles.

     The wagons rolled in by and by, pulling up in columns four abreast as they did at <<noon|13>>, and the oxen were unloosened but not unyoked, and the women got busy with the victuals.

     Rebecca looked tired, and Evans asked while she cleared up after the meal, "Why\'n\'t you rest this evenin\'? I\'ll drive."

     "You go ahead, Lije. You want to see the Platte soon\'s you can, and Brownie don\'t have to trail them cows today."

     He smiled at her, not answering but wondering again how it was she knew what was in him. He hadn\'t let on to her he was anxious to get a look at the Platte.

     Everybody ate fast, and what talk there was was mostly about the river, and then the bugle sounded and the train began to roll, and no one seemed to be sleepy with food and heat as they usually were <<after noon|13>>, but all a little excited.

     Before the wagons started, Evans had climbed his horse, going to join with Dick and Patch and the other outriders. Rock had got up, slow but dutiful, and followed him. On the way Evans saw Brother Weatherby, talking earnest to a couple of women. Even the Platte couldn\'t get Weatherby off the road to salvation. Tadlock stood by his wagon, his bull whip in his hand, as if ready to rouse up anyone who lazed.

     The way lay level and long ahead of them, with nothing on it to catch the eye except now and then for an antelope that stood with its head high while it watched. It would turn and run, showing its white rump, and then wheel around to watch some more. Patch wanted to shoot one, but Dick told him they\'d find plenty along the river bottom; no need to pack one all that piece.

     They rode without talking much. Daugherty had stayed back with the train, and so there were just the four of them, and Martin\'s slow horse dropped back after a while, taking him out of earshot except when he pounded it to a run and so caught up for a minute.

     Dick\'s eyes were never quiet. They ran to right and left and looked ahead and back, and what they missed, Evans imagined, wasn\'t much. When they crossed a trail that ran north and south, Dick gave it just a glance, but Evans had a notion that Dick knew from the one quick look just about when it had been traveled last.

     "Pawnee road. To the Arkansas," Dick said.

     "We ain\'t seen a Pawnee."

     "Not likely to, yet. They\'ll be west with the buffler."

     The sun swung over and by and by got under Evans\' hat brim and struck his cheek. Some of the heat had gone out of it so that it lay restful on the skin. It made Evans drowsy. He slumped down in the saddle, letting Dick do the watching while his mind fooled with one thing and then another, none of them important.

     Dick brought him to, Dick standing in his stirrups and say­ing, "There\'s the coast, I\'m thinking."

  What Evans saw looked like a range of high and broken hills. standing sharp and blue against the northwest sky. "Mountains!" Patch said.

     "Sand hills, and not as high as you\'d think from here."

     It turned out Dick was right. As they drew closer, weaving among a long set of badger holes, the hills shrank, until at last they were just piles of sand forty to sixty feet high, blown up by the wind and held together by cactus and thistle and, Evans saw as he rode into them, by fine grasses that his horse kept tugging for. A powderlike salt patched the ground with white.

     Evans had heard about the Platte. He had pictured it in his mind. He thought he knew what he was going to see, but now that his horse stood on the summit, he couldn\'t believe. He couldn\'t believe that flat could be so flat or that distance ran so far or that the sky lifted so dizzy-deep or that the world stood so empty. He saw old Rock chase a badger into a hole, saw a bunch of antelope drifting, saw the river sluiced and the woods rising on its islands and the sand in a great gray waste, but it was something he couldn\'t put a name to that held him. He thought he never had seen the world before. He never had known distance until now. He had lived shut off by trees and hills and had thought the world was a doll\'s world and distance just three hollers away and the sky no higher than a rifle shot.

     He said, "By God, Dick! By God!" and Dick nodded, knowing how it was with him, and silence stronger than any sound closed in on the words as if he had broken the rules by speaking.

     He held his horse up, Dick on one side of him, Patch on the other, and Martin riding up from the rear. Feeling rose in him, a shudder of feeling that left the skin cold and grained. "I never knew it would be like this," he said aloud but still to himself. He was humbled and set up at the same time and proud how with a fierce, unworded pride that he had put out for Oregon. It wouldn\'t be easy. It wouldn\'t be what people called it in. Great was the name for it, the only name he could find in his mind.

     He felt greatness coming into himself, greatness coming from greatness, and he renounced it, thinking of Tadlock and his self-importance, but still he felt greatness.

     Dick clucked to his horse, and together the four of them rode down the rough slope, and Dick set a flag at a swale, and they crossed the level plain and came to the river.',

            'HIGGINS had to smile to himself. People tickled him, especially maybe men when it came to women. Like now when the wagon train had been corralled. Like here on the Platte bank where the men had drawn off so\'s to be able to take up the subject of what Byrd kept calling manure. Manure, that was it, or buffalo chips or dung. To most of them, even to some of them that used the word regular, it wouldn\'t be fittin\' to give it the name it was known by best, since women, although absent, figured in the argument. In something like the same way people talked nice in the presence of a corpse.

     The question was, with wood getting scarce was it right and proper for the women to cook over fires made of buffalo chips? A tomfool like himself might think the women ought to have some say in the answer. But no. The husbands would decide and go back to their wives, serious and wise, and tell them what was right. How would they say it? Higgins wondered. How would Mr. Byrd inform his lady? "Ma\'am, for want of wood we\'ll have to use the waste of buffaloes"?

     This wasn\'t a called meeting. It just came on by itself. The men were standing mostly. A little to one side Dick Summers leaned on his rifle and listened and looked, looked at them and away from them to the sun sinking across a million miles of prairie. Higgins tried to guess what was in his mind. Maybe he thought there were rules out there, too, rules of making out with what there was to make out with, of cooking over buffalo chips if no wood was handy.

     Byrd was speaking, saying, "I for one don\'t like it."

     Byrd was a man Higgins hadn\'t come to know, except as he had seen him, plump and fair, and crack-lipped now from the wind, sitting proper at his fire or urging his team along in the way of a man not used to animals. He was an in-between-sized man, from the East somewhere, who carried himself straight and had solemn manners with the ladies and said amen to Brother Weatherby\'s prayers. It was natural, Higgins thought, that on this subject, if not on any others, he should have ideas.

     "None of us like it," Tadlock said, speaking, as always, as if what he said left nothing over. He said to Summers, "Are you sure?"

     Summers just nodded. He was still looking across the million miles of plain. Higgins guessed he was a little put out and a little amused by what must seem silly talk to him.

  Higgins followed Tadlock\'s gaze down to the river. There was a little flanking of bushes there and some ragged stumps and three dead trees, and Botter and Brownie Evans and some others were working with axes, trying to get enough fuel for fires. Tadlock\'s eyes traveled upstream where the Platte, except for one wooded island, ran bare in its great wrinkles of sand.

     "No wood," Tadlock said, not as a question, while he looked for it upriver. "No wood at all."

     "Not enough," Summers answered.

     "How about buffalo chips?"

     "Plenty. We\'re comin\' into buffler country."

     "Mightn\'t they be scarce, too? Mightn\'t they have been used up?"

     "They grow fast."

     It was a keen answer, Higgins thought, but Tadlock didn\'t smile. "I can\'t understand it. Why are there trees on the islands?"

     Fairman -who was a nice boy and good to work for- stooped and picked up a pinch of soil and rubbed it between his thumb and fingers. "This stuff won\'t grow anything except grass and cactus. It\'s straight sand."

     Tadlock spoke slowly, as if coming to a deep answer. "It must be that the island soil is richer."

  The men thought it over, nodding thoughtfully, until Summers said, "Injuns fire the prairies. Fire don\'t reach to the islands."

     Tadlock looked as if he didn\'t care much for the answer. "At any rate," he said, "that isn\'t the question. Could we pick up enough fuel while traveling -bushes and drift and such?"

     As if to touch him up Summers answered, "It would slow us."

     A cloud came on Tadlock\'s face. "We have to make time."

     "If there\'s nothing else for it, there\'s nothing else for it," Lije Evans put in. He stood close to Tadlock. Measuring the two of them, Higgins figured there wasn\'t much difference in the size. Evans was taller, Tadlock thicker through the chest.

     "I think we ought to give the question due consideration," Byrd said, solemn as a barn owl. "It\'s not something to be decided offhand. What do you say, Brother Weatherby?"

     Weatherby stood gaunt and stooped in a piece of blue shirt and a pair of knee-sprung pants with a tear in them. He didn\'t answer right away but turned his eyes up and beyond them, as if drawing off to talk to God.

     "I don\'t want to do all the talking here," Byrd said, licking his sore lip, "but it seems to me not appropriate. We shouldn\'t ask the ladies to do it if we can avoid it. It\'s not a ladylike thing."

     Evans said, "Shoo!" and Byrd started a little, studying Evans as if surprised that anyone could feel different from himself. "My woman\'ll use it and think no more to it."

     "Still," Byrd said, sounding less sure of himself, "the idea is offensive."

     Higgins eased himself down on the ground. It struck him that Byrd and some of the others, for all that they knew better, stuck to queer ideas of women, not liking to think of them as flesh and blood and stomach and guts but as something different, something a cut above earthy things, so that no one should let on to them that critters had hind ends. Higgins didn\'t set himself up as a judge of women, though a pewter tinker like he used to be did learn some things, but still he bet they\'d think all this palaver funny. Women had harder heads than men liked to believe. Even Mrs. Byrd did, probably.

     McBee had been quiet, which was unusual for him. He spit now and spoke the awful word. "A little shit ain\'t going to hurt anyone. Dried out, it ain\'t. Let \'em cook over buffalo shit."

    Patch sided with Byrd then. He spoke quietly out of his sharp face. "It is precisely language like that and sentiments like that that make the thing objectionable."

     McBee glanced at Tadlock and, getting no sign from him, let himself bristle like a feist. "I guess your woman knows enough not to step in it."

     "No doubt, though gentlewomen wouldn\'t know it by that name."

     McBee started to answer, but Tadlock turned on him and said, "Shut up!" and McBee just grinned through his whiskers and spit again and after a little pause answered, "That was all I had to allow."

     Tadlock spoke both as if to warn McBee and give comfort to the others. "At any rate we can call it chips."

     Higgins might not have put his oar in if he hadn\'t seen Byrd nodding. He asked, "Why don\'t you call it puddin\', or cake?"

     "How\'s that?"

     "If a name makes it different from what it is, a sweet name ought to make it sure-enough tasty."

     Tadlock thought about that, while Summers and Evans exchanged grins. Then he said, "This isn\'t a time for foolishness." He stared down at Higgins as if, by sitting, Higgins didn\'t show the case the right respect. "You don\'t seem much concerned."

     "When I work I work hard, but when I set I set loose," Higgins answered.

     "And you don\'t have to think about the protection of a wife."

     "Last wife I had, I was the one needed pertection."

     Brother Weatherby had pulled away from heaven long enough to give McBee a look. It wasn\'t his hardest look, though, and Higgins guessed it was the goddams and holy jesuses that really got his dander up.

     "What do you say, Mack?" Tadlock asked.

     "Nothing," Mack answered. He was looking down toward the river, where the women were doing around.

     "Well," Tadlock said as if explaining to children, "let\'s examine the possibilities." He counted the points off on his fingers. "<<One|9k:0>>, we can try to scrape up enough wood as we go along. <<Two|9k:0>>, maybe enough food can be cooked tonight to en­able us to get along without fires for a few days. Three-"

     "Or us men can cook," Evans put in. "I don\'t see the use of talk."

     "We want the general sentiment."

     "I don\'t want to cook," Evans answered.

     Mack had left the group, left it without speaking, like a man tired of talk. He wasn\'t, though. Higgins saw him down by the corral talking to the girl, Mercy McBee, and smiling while he talked.

     It was Evans who kept the men pointed to the question. "You want to do your own cooking?" he asked them all.

     Byrd and Patch didn\'t like to face up to the choice, Byrd especially. They looked at the ground and scuffed it and shook their heads slow, like a drammer being told he would have to quit or die. Higgins figured Patch had a heap more head on him than Byrd, though they were on the same side now. Patch had his proper Yankee ways but he had thought in his face, too, while all Byrd had along with his politeness was helplessness with animals, a big family, and a cracked lip.

     Brother Weatherby came back to earth. "What the Lord wills, the Lord wills," he said.

     "Meaning what?" asked Tadlock.

     "If He has left us nothing to cook with except buffalo dung, He means us to cook with buffalo dung."

     "Us?"

     "Those who cook regularly."

     "Suits me," McBee said, forgetting Tadlock had silenced him. "What is not offensive in His sight should not be so in ours." The men were nodding again, even Byrd, feeling better since God had taken sides.

     Holdridge spoke for the first time then. He had been at the edge of the crowd, listening and watching out of a face made black as a kettle by beard and weather. Higgins took him for a shy man, though he didn\'t look it. "Who\'s goin\' to pick the cow chips?" he asked.

     "The younger ones can bring them in," Tadlock told him.

     Sure, Higgins thought, the little ones and the boys not quite grown up would pick the chips and the women would cook over them and the men would make out not to notice. All but the pups could keep their put-on. All this palaver was just a bow to manners. From the first they knew they\'d have to vote for chips.

     Returning to the wagons, Higgins heard Evans say to Summers, "Well?"

     "Heap of doin\'s over a cow dab," Summers answered.',

            'HIS NAME was Brownie Evans, and he was seventeen and the dust rose under the slow feet of the cattle and powdered a man\'s skin and filled his nose, and the sun bore through it, hot as a near fire, though summer was just coming on, until his neck and cheeks and hands turned dark as the saddle he rode on. The dust phlegmed the throat and gritted between the teeth. It settled in the ears, feeling like meal under the finger that tried to clear it out. Keep footin\' it, critters. Stay with the bunch, you. Git along! Far off, on sky lines clear as water, heat waves ran.

     His name was Brownie Evans and he was seventeen and bound for Oregon, and this hand that held the reins was his, this fixing of bone and joint and broken nails, made to answer his orders; and the feet in the peg boots were his, and the arms in the shirt and the legs in the homespun pants; and he lived inside himself, under the ribs or beneath the skull, thinking thoughts and feeling feelings like maybe hadn\'t been thought or felt before, they were so kind of crazy . . . or it would rain, out of a sky gray as ashes, and a wind would rise, pushing the clouds along, and the skin inside the clothes would bunch up against the cold, as the herd itself bunched up, looking sad and scraggly. Giddup, and damn the loose horses! A horse wanted to eat his head off.

     The day would drag by, the long day would drag by -getting­up time, nooning time, camping time, while the mind ran loose and the eye looked right and left, for Indians and buffalo and varmints like the prairie dogs the wagon train had come on to lately and the owls that sat by the holes, or like the thing called a porcupine that one of the men had shot. Dick Summers said it was a prickly beaver, and the children had plucked it clean of quills.

     Ahead the eye would see the train winding, the men walking by their teams and the women and children tagging alongside if the day was fair, and the arched covers of the wagons, more gray than white now, swaying to the road. Farther on, some­times, the outriders would come into view -Summers and Pa and Mr. Patch or Mr. Fairman and Mr. Tadlock or others, depending, and one of the rifle barrels would catch the sun and flash it back, across the long flat, over the wagons, through the dust, to where a man poked the loose stock along. Come on to <<noon|13>>, the riders ahead would get off their horses and begin digging holes along the shore of the river so as to get water that didn\'t run so thick with mud. Hig said the trouble with the Platte was it flowed bottom side up.

  Hig\'s name was Higgins and Martin\'s was Martin and Botter\'s was Botter and Mr. McBee\'s was Henry McBee, and they rode often at the tail of the cow line, along with others who changed day by day. Hig talked to himself, out of a mouth that barely had room between nose and chin, or reined over when he thought of something good and told you about it and grinned afterwards, his mouth looking like a knife cut in his withered face. Martin rode stoop-shouldered and chewed tobacco and hardly ever smiled or talked, acting as if life was sorry and no help for it. People called Botter a steady man. When he spoke it was about horses or mules or cattle.

     Those were their names, the names they were known by, but to know a name wasn\'t to know a man. The man lay deep, inside his name, underneath his talk and acts, as he did himself who went by the name of Brownie Evans and spoke and moved like everybody else but still lived secret and alone. People would say he was skinny and big-jointed and had too much of him turned under for feet, or they might say he was friendly and good-turned but bashful, but they wouldn\'t know him. He couldn\'t let them know him, for it would be the same as standing naked and maybe not looking like other folks but looking outlandish and shameful. What a person wondered was, were other people like him underneath or, more likely, solider and properer and not moved by crazy notions?

     He wouldn\'t want to tell about how it was with him, not even about the way his chest filled sometimes when he came to a rise and looked over the country or how his heart turned just at the smell of camp smoke or the lonely voices of the wild geese that had nested along the river. He would know then that good things awaited him, great things that he couldn\'t put a word to or set out in thought. He could trail cattle in the hot sun or in the winds that sprang up fierce. Or he could trail them in the rain, while storm clouds trailed over him and the feet of the stock sucked and slipped in the mud. With him would be the knowing -while he ran the work stock in and helped yoke up or went for water or poked a team or greased the axles from the tar bucket that swung underneath the wagon. It was his secret, this knowing that good things lay ahead, and probably people would smile, but sometimes at night he would wake up to the crying of wolves or the rustle of the breeze, and the goodness would lie with him like something he could squeeze to himself.

    Just tomorrow they might meet Indians -Pawnees with roached hair, or Cheyennes or Arapahoes or Sioux, war-party Indians painted red and black. They came streaming on to the prairie and held up and looked while the wagons jolted into a circle and women cried and the men examined their rifles. They came on then, the Indians did, their head feathers bent to the wind of the charge, their war whoops breaking hoarse on the ear.

     "Steady," Dick Summers said. He lay underneath a wagon, his rifle resting on a spoke of the wheel, and Brownie lay with him. Around the circle other men had posted themselves, and inside it the women and children peeked, white-faced, from behind the boxes and gear they had yanked from the wagons.

     "They can\'t come it," Dick said, his cool gray eyes looking along the barrel. "They\'ll circle."

     "Course not," Brownie said, and Dick switched his gaze over and gave him a half-smile, seeing Brownie\'s eye cool, too, and his hands easy on his rifle.

     The Indians were all shining shields and yelling mouths and pounding hoofs, and then the two steady guns spoke and knocked two Indians from their horses, and the others broke then, flaring out like a covey of birds. They ran a bigger circle around the circle of wagons, just the tops of their heads showing or an arm or a leg, or a bow bent sharp and then the arrow streaking.

     "Rifle!" Brownie pitched his empty gun back of him. His voice sounded keen as a shot.

     "Here." Someone shoved a loaded piece into his reached-back hand. "Here." He let himself take one quick look behind him, and saw it was Mercy McBee, already charging the rifle he had emptied.

     "Down! Down, Mercy!" But she just went on loading while the arrows pattered around her like hail.

     "<<Two|9k:0>>," Dick counted.

     "Two for me, too. Rifle!"

     "<<Three|9k:0>>."

     "<<Three|9k:0>>. Rifle!"

  It was too much for the Indians. It wasn\'t likely they had seen shooting like that before. They drew off, howling, and began fading into distance, and Dick Summers was saying, "Hang me, hoss, but you\'re a smart shot."

     So it came to be that he was more like Dick Summers all the time. He had the same easy slouch in the saddle, the same seeing eye, the half-sad smile that showed just a little of what he might be thinking. He came to be like Dick Summers, except younger, and men and women looked at him as he rode by and listened to him while he leaned on his rifle, thinking how much he was and him just a boy, too, and they said to one another, "That Brownie Evans takes after Dick Summers like one pea to another."

     Or a herd of buffalo might show up. They made a great, brown, rolling shadow on the slope north of the river, and men\'s eyes kindled while they counted balls and measured powder, but Dick Summers said, "Best leave this to me\'n Brownie Evans. You all\'ll get a heap of shootin\' later. Right now we\'re froze for meat." He turned, "Git your bow and arrers, Brownie."

     "Bow and arrows." It was Mr. Tadlock, who didn\'t know beans about buffalo hunting.

     "Sure."

     "Bow and arrows!"

     "Bow loads faster\'n an iron."

     "One rifle shot," Brownie said to Mr. Tadlock, "and you\'re done. Time you load up, them critters\'ll be four days gone."

     They rode away, leaving Mr. Tadlock mouthing, "Bow and arrows?" They splashed across the Platte and came upwind toward the herd, riding slow. There was a mist of dust over the buffalo, raised by the stepping feet and the pawings of bulls. Underneath the mist the humps ran like waves as far as a man could see, and now on the near edge the waves heaved around, and hot eyes showed and low-held horns.

     Dick said, "Ready?"

     The horses sprang to full speed, the hunters silent yet, and the waves washed one way and another, and came to be parts of one great wave that flowed away as if a dam had broken.

  The old bulls were the last to get going. They watched out of their dull and angry eyes and turned and broke into a clumsy gallop and turned again as if they had a mind to charge.

    A yell broke out of Dick\'s throat, wild and strange as any war whoop, and Brownie matched it and drummed the ribs of his horse with his heels and came among the bulls and saw an opening and raced through it while the bulls hooked at him, too late. The horns clattered like a canebrake in a wind. The ground rolled up in a thick dust, hiding Dick, hiding the herd except for the bobbing rumps of the cows right ahead. The hoofs made a thunder in the head.

     Brownie dropped his looped reins and took the arrow that he had popped into his teeth and notched it to his bow. His arm pulled it back to the head and let it go, and it sank out of sight in a fat cow. The cow slowed and stumbled and was lost behind.

    Five cows he killed, five fat cows while the herd fanned out. He pulled up, his horse in a lather of sweat, and squinted through the dust for Dick.

     He saw him at last, saw him hard after a cow that ran with two others and a bull and a calf, and then he saw the horse stumble and pitch over and Dick slammed hard on the ground.

     Dick lay there, not moving, and the bull stopped and glared and pawed the ground and started for him.

     There wasn\'t time to think. Brownie kicked his horse and felt him lunge and reached for an arrow while he stuck to the saddle like a bur. It was close, close as a crack, the bull right on Dick and the arrow drawn its full length, aimed dead at the heart. The bowstring hummed like a string on Hig\'s fiddle.

     The bull fell a foot from Dick, the blood foaming from his mouth. Dick looked up. He wasn\'t hurt bad from the fall but only weak and winded. He said, "Half of stayin\' alive is pickin\' your pardner."

     They rode into camp, while the men and women looked at them wide-eyed. One of the pair of eyes belonged to Mercy McBee, who stood a little to one side. They had been dancing, that was it. Mercy and the Patches and the Byrds and Mr. Mack and Botter and some of the rest had been dancing while Hig sawed on his fiddle and the music of it rose thin but brave in the empty land. Now they all stopped and looked, and one of the lookers was Mercy McBee, who dropped Mr. Mack\'s hand while the hunters rode by. A little smile touched her mouth, of wonderment and pride. He didn\'t smile back. He rode sober­faced, which was fitting to a man in such a case. All the same he guessed she knew how it was beginning to be with him.',

            '"We\'ll need buffalo chips, Brownie, and if you could milk it would help your ma."

     "Don\'t be askin\' him to milk," Ma said, shaking her head at Pa.

     "I don\'t aim for you to take it so hard."

     "Milkin\'s nothing. It\'s the jolts and all."

     Brownie said, "All right," and pulled the saddle from old Nellie and laid it by the wagon. Rock came over and took a sniff of the damp horse blanket and looked up as if asking what was doing next.

     The wagons had drawn their night circle, and most of the oxen had been unyoked and driven out to graze. Around the wagons men and women were working, pulling out boxes and fixing to set up tents and to make fires.

     Pa came over to where Brownie stood. "I wouldn\'t get mortified. It\'s the same fix with everybody."

     "I milked before."

     "It ain\'t milkin\'. I\'m talkin\' about the chips."

     "I said all right, Pa."

     "It\'s just that it\'s new that bothers you. Do it awhile and you\'ll think nothing to it." Pa put his big hand on Brownie\'s shoulder. It felt warm and solid. The smile on his face was inquiring, as if trying to see through to the Brownie that lived inside.

     "It don\'t trouble me," Brownie said, but he didn\'t look at Pa. He looked at Ma, who was digging kettles out of a box.

     "If you mind, I\'ll do it, and you can set up the tent."

     Brownie shook his head. There wasn\'t any way out of it but to gather up buffalo chips. It shamed him to do it, but it would shame him more to show his shame to Pa. He had a lead rope on Nellie. He would take her over to where the herd was grazing and pick up some chips on the way back and maybe not be seen but by a few.

     It was troublesome, to be ashamed of shame but to be ashamed just the same, and not just about buffalo chips, either. Here on the naked Platte there wasn\'t a bush to stand or squat behind. People couldn\'t build a brush arbor as they did at camp meetings. And, for fear of Indians, they couldn\'t walk out of sight. They did the best they could. Some of the women had chamber pots inside the wagons. Some hadn\'t and sometimes were caught sudden along the way. Or a rider would get off his horse and stand on the off side and make out to be idling or sizing up the country, but the cant of his head and the slope of his shoulders would give him away.

     They thought up a system, the women did, and morning, <<noon|13>>, and night a bunch of them would trail off a piece, and the up-standing ones would make a shield for the others while the menfolks around the wagons made out to be so busy they didn\'t know what was going on.

     Brownie took the rope and set off with Nellie. Maybe there wasn\'t anyone, he thought, as mortified as he was, and not just when it came to himself and his business, either. It struck him as ugly -the women making their shield, the men standing behind horses, the young ones squatting almost anywhere. When he thought about it, the feeling of goodness in him drew off.

     He untied the rope from Nellie and turned her with the rest and wound the rope around his waist and knotted the ends, so\'s to have his arms free for gathering.

     The chips ripped up, pulling loose from the whitened grass beneath. There were bugs under the chips, little scuttlers of gray and black that ran seeking among the stems when the roof was lifted from over their heads. He would have watched them, except that he would be seen watching. He cuffed old Rock, who made a show of himself by coming close and looking, curious as a chicken, whenever a chip was raised.

     Other people were working, too, young ones, like the straw­haired Brewer girl and her two brothers, and Joe Turley and Jeff Byrd and John Shields and Harry Gorham and two or three of the Daughertys. Some of the men didn\'t have a family and so had to do for themselves, like old Brother Weatherby, who said people shouldn\'t complain but praise God that, anyhow, there were chips to make fires with. Brother Weatherby gathered up the chips slow and sober, maybe saying a prayer to himself while he did it.

     The land lay quiet. The only sound Brownie could hear, except for the ring of distance and the little commotions of camp, was the tearing sound of chips being pulled from the grass. The sun was half sunk, as if just letting itself peek at what was going on. Then the children got to playing, throwing chunks of manure at one another and yelling shrill until the old folks called from the wagons and told them to get busy.

     Brownie picked up one chip and another and another. They were thick here. Buffalo chips meant buffalo -and not so far away now, Dick Summers said. For two days the train had kept crossing trails from the bluffs down to the river, trails as wide as the span of two hands and worn deep as a fist and as smooth as a spade could cut. Bones lay around, too, skulls and leg bones and ribs, some of them set in circles or half-moons and splashed with paint, by the Pawnees, Dick said.

  He picked up more chips, looking at nobody, and after a while had an armful and stood straight, and there was Mercy McBee not five steps away, and she hadn\'t seen him, either, and so stood surprised, holding half an armful. Underneath the pile, Brownie could see the small fingers bent around.

     She didn\'t speak, or turn her eyes down, either, but the blood climbed slow in her cheeks.

     He couldn\'t think of anything to say. He felt heat in his own face and knew it was red, too, but still he looked at her, seeing the dark eyes and the face framed with hair that the wind had blown wild. He had a sudden, crazy wanting to reach out and touch her as a person might touch a small, scared thing, making up to it with the gentle hand. It was as if at the touch the two of them would melt into understanding that wiped away shame, into tenderness that went without words.

     He said, "I reckon I got a load."

     She looked down and bent a little and a crumb of the dried manure fell from under her hand and caught on her faded dress and stuck there.

     The words he had said beat back on him, the empty, clumsy words, and he saw himself as if he stood outside, saw himself gawky, big-handed and big-footed, with the pale fine sprouts of new whiskers on his face, saw himself unproved and likely cowardly, lost in fool dreams.

     He took two steps and wrenched around and said, "I could do it for you."

     Her glance came up in a quick, liquid look that he couldn\'t understand.

     "I\'d be pleasured to."

     "I can do it all right." She turned without thanking him. She walked away and stopped and stooped, somehow pitiful and somehow dignified, and fingered for a cow dab.

     Of a sudden, while he dared to watch, he understood something about her, seeing in his mind\'s eye old Hank McBee and his dirty whiskers and the thin oxen, hitched along with an old roan horse, that pulled the McBee wagon, and with the wagon Mrs. McBee and her loud brood and a coop of messy chickens.

     He could imagine now that a snake had been by her, a rattlesnake that someway didn\'t rattle, and he had seen the ugly head rise from the grass, unseen by her, and the dirty coil of it close by her ankle, and, without thought for himself, he had leaped forward and smashed the head under his heel.

  He jumped and came to himself and found he was on the way to the wagon, the heel of one big foot ground into the dirt and old Rock looking queerly at him, but still he talked to her saying, "Mercy! Mercy!"

     In his dream she came to him, came tenderly, with the shimmer of tears in her eyes, and put her mouth on his and rested soft in his arms -and he felt the animal rising in him, eager and pushful, and was ashamed of his coarseness.',

            '[ap 04:00] The Way West - A. B. Guthrie Jr_.epub (OEBPS/Text/The Way West - A B Guthrie Jr.html) - four-o\'clock',
            'TADLOCK STOOD at the side of his second wagon. "Martin," he said sharply, looking underneath. "You, Martin!"

     He straightened, waiting for an answer, suspecting already that something was wrong. Not once, in more than a month on the road, had Martin lain abed after the sentinels had fired their <<four-o\'clock|6>> volley.

     "Martin!"

     Dawn was firing the east, far down the shallow valley of the Platte, and here and there the waters of the river glowed to it, like puddles under the moon, but here the night lay dusky, licked by the little fires people had commenced to make. The smell of camp smoke, of dung or wood igniting to punk and powder struck by flint and steel, came sharp to his nostrils.

     "Martin!" He couldn\'t make out the man, but only the gray hump of him under the piece of wagon sheet that Martin used for cover or tent, depending on whether the night looked fair or stormy.

     Tadlock stooped and caught the corner of the sheet and pulled it, calling out again. "What\'s wrong here?"

     The hump moved then. It lurched and settled back and a voice came out of it. "I\'m sick. Jesus!"

     "Get out from there, then. We\'ll have to make you a bed in one of the wagons."

     Tadlock got no answer to that. He imagined Martin thinking it over, asking himself weakly, in the manner of an indisposed woman, whether he was strong enough for the day. In sharp annoyance he said, "You were all right last night. You stood your turn at guard."

     He flicked the ground with the whip he carried. Damn the luck! Here they were at Brady\'s Island, within striking distance of the forks of the Platte, and the road was good and buffalo were plenty and the weather fair enough, and now a man had to get sick. The suspicion came to him again, while the dawn drew on and the itch to get going grew in him, that Martin was pretending to be sicker than he was. Some people would exaggerate a mere indisposition, especially if they wanted to turn back, especially if they had listened too long to weak talk about Indians and hardships. The train never camped but that someone, like Turley or his wife or one of the Byrds, began crying about dangers.

     Dangers! They\'d hardly met a one. They had had a stampede, and Mack, like the fool Tadlock told him that he was, had .shot a scrawny Indian. Later a delegation from the Kaws had called about the killing, but he as captain had handled them all right. He had outfaced the bunch and sent them packing, without so much as one twist of tobacco to soothe their scurvy feelings. For the rest, they hadn\'t seen a Pawnee, a Cheyenne, or a Sioux. They\'d made all the crossings safely. And, until now, no one had been sick, barring a mild flux or a stomachache.

     "We\'ll get a bed fixed. You crawl out of there." Tadlock turned and walked part way round the circle, raising his whip when people spoke to him. His own wagons were so laden that he couldn\'t spread a decent bed without transferring part of the contents. He would consult Mack about that. He came first, though, to the Evans fire and on impulse stopped there, nodding to Evans and his wife and Dick Summers. The Evans boy, Tadlock guessed, had gone out to help gather up the stock.

     \'\'Little nippy this morning," Evans said, hitching his shoulders.

     "We\'ve got a sick man."

     "Who?"

     \'\'Martin."

     "What ails him?" Tadlock shrugged.

     "How sick?" Evans asked.

     Tadlock shrugged again. "I\'m going to rig a bed."

     Summers took the pipe from his mouth and held it in front of him and blew a cloud of smoke around it. The action irritated Tadlock. It was typical of the man, as if the train had all of time to consider one case of sickness. He searched for words to describe Summers. Undisciplined. Unsystematic. Accustomed to living without purpose, like a savage. "We\'ll roll out on time," he told Summers pointedly. "We can\'t hold up for one man."

     Mrs. Evans was scraping out the pans they\'d eaten from. "Lije," she said, "you better have a look."

     Summers\' gray eyes, appearing almost white against the back­drop of dawn, slid to her in an expression of approval and regard.

     "Well, you can see for yourselves," Tadlock said.

     "Uh-huh," Evans answered mildly. He stood up, looming big, a close, solid shadow among the shadows that were lifting to the west. Tadlock felt for him the impatience that he might have felt for a child. A slow-going, slow-witted man, Evans was, competent but without force. Tadlock found himself wondering whether the man ever lost his temper, ever came to a decision without guidance from his wife or Summers. "Come on then."

     Summers knocked the heel from his pipe and got up, too.

     "Don\'t you reckon you\'d best take some medicine, Lije?" Mrs. Evans asked, and Evans nodded and went to the tail of his wagon and, after what seemed a long time to Tadlock, came back with a box.

     Martin lay as before, except that now he could be seen, the hair untidy on his head, the whiskers gray and stubbled on his lank face.

     The three of them bent over, like three hens, Tadlock thought, at the sight of a strange bug.

     "What\'s the matter, hoss?" Summers asked.

     "Come on out, Martin!" Tadlock ordered. "We can\'t doctor you there, or get you in a wagon bed, either." He tugged at the wagon cover.

     Martin opened his eyes and lay staring up at the underside of the wagon. He licked his mouth and said, "Jesus!"

     "Come on!" Tadlock saw that Martin\'s face was flushed and his eyes feverish, but still it was in him to say, "You can\'t be that sick, man."

     Summers said, "Reckon he knows better\'n you."

     "I\'ll handle this." While Tadlock spoke Martin moved. He got himself over on his belly and raised to all fours and came crawling out, stumbling on the wagon sheet that trailed with him. When he was out, he let himself go flat again.

     "Acts bad off," Evans said.

     "He won\'t feel any worse in a wagon," Tadlock told him.

     Summers knelt and helped Martin over on his back and felt his forehead. "Easy, hoss," he said, and then, to Tadlock and Evans, "Could be camp fever."

     "What\'s that?"

     "Camp fever. No other name to it."

     Martin said, "Jesus!" and closed his eyes, and Summers looked up and shook his head. Some of the others of the camp had started to come up, attracted by the sight of the three of them standing and the man on the ground. "What\'s wrong?"

     Tadlock felt them behind him, but he didn\'t turn or answer. He wished they would clear out. They would all have ideas. Some might want to go on, but some would want to wait and some wouldn\'t know what to do. And some would want to physic the man and some to bleed and some to blister him. The result would be an endless dillydallying, when the part of good sense was to load Martin in a wagon and start rolling.

     It was like Evans to answer the question. "Camp fever," he said.

     A woman\'s voice asked, "Is it catchin\'?"

     Tadlock snapped back, "No!"

     Martin opened his eyes and rolled them up from face to face as if hoping to find in one of them the answer to his trouble. Tadlock swung around. "Go and get ready. We\'ll move in a few minutes. Evans, if you\'ll take just a little of my load, I can make a bed. We\'ll doctor him and roll."

     "I do\' know, Tadlock," Evans said. "Don\'t know what?"

     "Do\' know as we ought to."

     "I\'m the captain. I\'ll assume the responsibility."

     Behind Tadlock a dry voice spoke up that he recognized as Patch\'s. "We\'re all together, you know, Tadlock, including your hired hand."

     "Who said we weren\'t? We\'ll still be all together when he\'s in a wagon."

     "That ain\'t what Patch means," Evans put in.

     Tadlock bit back the words that came to his lips. The fools! The damn fools, acting as if this were a time and place for leisurely solicitude! He looked at them one by one -Evans, Summers, Patch- trying to stare them down. In their eyes he read a stupid stubbornness.

     It came to him, slowly, that the thing had come to be an issue. A position taken, a sensible position taken, a few words said ­and then the lines drawn! Now, here, authority was at stake, prestige, the leadership that forced the train along. To give in to them would be to acknowledge his defeat.

     He felt movement at his side and turned and saw Mrs. McBee, a small, ragged witch of a woman. "We got some Jew David\'s Plaster," she said. "It\'s good for most anything."

     He waved her away. "All right, Evans. Doctor him!"

     "What I want to do," Evans said -and Tadlock felt a pulse of astonishment at his tone- "is to see everybody\'s took care of proper. We got to tend to Martin. I ain\'t for joltin\' him along in a wagon."

     "You want to bring up the rear, I guess!"

     "I want to see Martin\'s took care of, or anybody else that gets sick."

     Tadlock held on to himself. "Grass is already short because of the buffalo. It\'ll be a damn sight shorter if we let other companies get ahead."

     "We ain\'t first anyhow," Summers answered. "There\'s some beyond."

     "A handful if any. Light outfits with little stock. But because they\'re ahead you think we can let everybody pass!"

     Summers was gnawing on his pipestem. He spoke almost idly. "Camp fever makes the bones ache bad."

     Patch said, "I\'m in favor of staying here until we know Martin\'s better."

     Tadlock heard a mutter of approval from the crowd that had grown while they stood arguing. Their eyes were all fixed on him, it seemed, fixed accusingly when all he had sought was the welfare of the company. System was the thing, a time to get up, a time to travel, a time to bed down, a set distance to make daily, each man performing his appointed duties, each answering to the call of authority. That way, they\'d get to Oregon, get there safely, speedily, ahead of the rest. But these men didn\'t appreciate system, organization, discipline. They didn\'t deserve the leadership he had given them.

     His temper flared up at the thought. "We\'ll roll. Hear? I say we\'ll roll."

     They didn\'t move. They stood quiet, regarding him with that stupid stubbornness, until Evans said, "Do\' know as we will, Tadlock. Seems to me this is a thing for the council."

     "Council!"

     "Let the council decide, seein\' as we don\'t agree."

     "Good God!"

     "Meantime, I ain\'t movin\'."

     Patch added, "I, either," and again there came the mutter of approval.

     Tadlock would have cursed them except that it occurred to him that he could handle the council. Brewer was on it, and Mack and Fairman. They would stand by him. The train would lose the time the meeting took, which was to be regretted, but hereafter these muttonheads might not be so ready to dispute his orders. "Stay then!" he said and laughed at them. "We\'ll talk our way to Oregon."

     Evans stooped at the sick man\'s side.

     "Take your time," Tadlock told him. "No hurry. We\'re only going as far as Oregon City." He added, "The council will meet in an hour."

     For a time he watched the self-appointed doctors while they got Martin in a good bed under a tent and talked themselves into believing calomel was the proper medicine. Not that, alone, he wouldn\'t have cared for Martin and done it just as well. It was just that there were too many wanting to take a hand, too many holding out for Sarsaparilla Blood Pills and Balsam of Life and emetics and calomel and bloodletting.

     Leaving, he debated the question of talking to Mack and Fairman before the council met. He decided not to. On this open plain a private conference was impossible. Seeing them, Patch or someone would suspect a conspiracy. He would ask McBee to serve notice of the meeting.

     Having asked him, he strode about the camp, confident but still sore, now and then flicking his whip at a grass stem and feeling something gratified when the popper snapped off a blade. The women, he saw with approval, were making the most of this idle time. Five or six of them were at the river\'s edge, washing clothes in the sandy water. A couple had washboards. The others scuffed the washing between their hands and slapped the heavier things on rocks dug out of the sand from God knew where. For the most part the men not tending to Martin just stood around talking while children ran squealing among them. They were talking, Tadlock had no doubt, about him and about Martin and what was the thing to do. Well, he could tell them.

     Later, at the upper end of the camp, away from the tents and the talk, Tadlock saw Summers by himself, standing still as some old bull while he looked to the West that had molded him. Tadlock walked up to him. "I can\'t understand you, Summers," he began.

     Summers half turned, his two hands clasped on his rifle, the butt of which rested on the ground. "Countin\' buffler, is all."

     "I don\'t mean that," Tadlock answered, knowing Summers knew that he didn\'t. "We ought to be traveling."

     Summers looked at the sun, now well above the eastern horizon. "Could\'ve made three or four miles, I reckon," he said, his face grave. In his eyes, though, Tadlock caught a gleam that exasperated him.

     "Goddam it! This isn\'t a thing for fun."

     "Not sayin\' it is," Summers answered, the gleam in his eyes fading, "nor for thinkin\' miles instead of Martin."

     "One man isn\'t a train."

     "I didn\'t figure you knew that."

     "What do you mean?"

     "Ain\'t you the whole shebang?"

     "You\'re the pilot, Summers. That\'s all." Tadlock spoke deliberately, wanting to irritate the man, wanting almost to bait him to a fight that would relieve the feelings in himself. He waited, the butt of his whip held tight in his hand.

     Summers turned and looked across at the river and the island that stood wooded in it. "That there\'s Brady\'s Island," he said so casually that Tadlock was unprepared for the rest. "A man tamed Brady got himself rubbed out. That was back in \'thirty­three."

     Summers\' gaze came back to rest on Tadlock. In it, Tadlock thought, was the cool, the deadly expression of an animal waiting for a kill. Not until then had he known how dangerous the guide could be. He wasn\'t afraid but still he felt relief when Summers lifted his rifle and moved off. Tadlock watched him go. Summers\' gait was the soft and easy gait of an Indian. His hair was beginning to hang long in back, Indian-fashion, too.

     Well, to hell with him, Tadlock thought, and to hell with his parting look of contempt or hostility or whatever it was! Looks didn\'t hurt. A man could afford to ignore a half-savage pilot.

     The restlessness in him made. him want to move. He stepped on westward, letting his gaze roam over the sunlit country while his mind worked. Ahead of him were wagon tracks, the tracks of the emigrants of 1844 and before. They would have had their troubles, too. No doubt there were fools aplenty in those trains, men who couldn\'t lead but balked at being led and, by the balking, showed the need of the very thing that they resisted.

     Across the river he saw buffalo and tried to guess how far they were. Here in the fine air of the Platte one underestimated. A bluff or a turn of the river that looked but an hour might be a day or more. A crow a half mile off appeared within good rifle range. Details stood out -the swags and rises and sand hills, the bars of the river and the water frothy in an eddy, the beards of the distant buffalo, even the very blades of grass. This clear air, he thought, made the world at once smaller and bigger, smaller because the eye saw, bigger because it saw so far. Sound mixed one\'s impressions, too. By night every noise was intimate and distinct; by day the report of a rifle was a faint pop in a silence that rang the head like quinine. It was a strange and awesome world. It required decision and management.

     He had shown the qualities it took. He had kept the train in motion. He\'d managed. They owed a debt to him -and paid in criticism! Take the day Mack shot the Indian, the day that followed the stampede. When daylight came, Summers had led a mere handful of riders out to hunt the scattered cattle. With him away -and with him his precious right to name and organize war parties- Tadlock had appointed other riders, until nearly every last manjack was gone. But still the train went on, the ox teams poked by women and the bigger children.

     A storm came up that morning -a wretched, all-day rain that greased the ground and later soaked it, so that the rearward wagons floundered half-stuck in the mire. The rain was cold, slanted by a chilly breeze. The drivers climbed up in the wagons to escape it and got colder yet for want of exercise and climbed back down and stumped along, their feet heavy and misshapen with the clinging mud. But they went on. That was the point. Women driving, children driving, they went on.

  Tadlock had shown the way, since Summers was scouting with the men, but often he turned back to give his people help and heart. One thing he could do, he\'d have to say for himself, was to get an ox to pull. Give him his whip and he could lift a piece of hide. More than once that day he\'d taught a team a thing or two.

     He taught the Indians something, also, taught the six-man delegation that caught up with the train two hours or so after it had started out. Byrd, who rode so poorly that Tadlock hadn\'t sent him with the men, had seen them first and managed to get himself aboard an extra horse and bounced ahead to give the news to Tadlock.

     The train wasn\'t in position to corral. It had spread out in the mud. The going was too heavy for a quick maneuver. A hill rose to the right. Trees grew to left.

     All these considerations came to Tadlock while Bvrd panted out his message. On the instant he saw them clear and knew what he would have to do.

     "Get the women armed!" he barked. "You and Willie Brewer and the preacher come to the rear, with rifles." He jammed a I resh cap on his own. "How many Indians?"

     "I just caught a glimpse."

     "How far away?"

     "Close."

     "Do what I tell you!" Tadlock dug his heels into his horse and galloped toward the line, leaving Byrd to follow. He held up his hand for a halt. He couldn\'t see the Indians yet. They were lost in a strip of woods, lost in the mist.

     Charging by the wagons, Tadlock saw the white faces of the women, the suddenly frightened faces of children, the face of his wife written over with anxiety. He hoped that, beholding him, they were finding courage.

  A hundred yards below the tail-end wagon he spied the Indians riding from a brake. He slowed his horse and walked it toward them. Six Indians. That was all he saw. Six Kaws, he guessed they were, with roached hair mussed by rain, with odds and tatters of attire glued wet against their skins. The leader had a soggy blanket draped around him. Tadlock caught the black-wet shimmer of gun steel, the tight arch of a bow. A mangy set but maybe mean, he thought, and rode straight at them until they pulled their horses up.

     He stared at them, making his face as tight and blank as theirs. It stirred his pride to think, as he went from gaze to tiaze, that he felt, not fear, but challenge, the heady, hard conflict of wills. He asked, "What you want?"

     They were a long time answering. Never, he imagined, had they been received like this. They expected the pipe, the oratory, the soft courtesies that were the custom.

     The Kaw with the blanket spoke. "Kill Injun." He pointed hack, toward where Mack had dropped the Indian from the irce.

     "Kill Injun, yes," Tadlock answered. "Injun steal, so kill Indian."

     "Injun no steal."

     "Injun steal. Heap dead."

     "Injun love presents."

     "No presents."

     Tadlock saw thought working in their eyes. He saw what he supposed was disappointment rising from his refusal to make amends with gifts. Now was the time, he knew. Now was the danger. But still he felt no fear. Looking at this ill-fed, scrap­clothed crew, he felt power surging in him, power to bend them, power to treat them as he chose. It was as if, with one sweep of the hand, he could wipe them from the earth.

     He caught the leader\'s gaze and stared it down. In the flush of certitude he said, "Get!" and hitched his rifle closer. He said, "Now get!" and touched his horse a step ahead.

     He was the master of them. One by one they turned. The eyes sliding off from his had a look of craven injury. They filed hack as they had come. He sat straight and still, by his power and presence willing them away, until the last of them was gone from sight.

     He had reassured the women afterwards, had got the train to moving, had met the riders coming in and told them no, it wasn\'t time to camp. Rain, mud, Indians, scattered cattle and still the train had rolled a decent distance. Eight miles, maybe ten, he estimated. Which showed what management could do. Which showed what a little spunk could do. He didn\'t exaggerate his deed, though he heard the women talking of it to their men. It was no more than the duty of a captain to his company. He\'d do the same again in spite of Summers, who said, "It worked this time, but don\'t never try it on a Pawnee or a Sioux."

     That night he let it be known the cattle guards would have to show some sense. The idea, firing at imaginary Indians and so causing a stampede! Of course the Indians were imaginary. Hadn\'t the riders found all the animals but one? Had they spied a single thief? He didn\'t hide his sentiments about Mack and his behavior, either. Not that one Indian mattered much. It was the consequences possible. The men took it well enough then. They knew they had it coming.

     But now, because he said a sick man didn\'t justify delay, because he said Martin would be as well off in a wagon, they acted tip! Tadlock popped another blade of grass.

     He reminded himself it was about time for the council to meet, but for a minute longer he stood where he was, pecking at the ground with his whip. He saw, again with approval, that other women had joined the group at the river\'s edge. One of the men had built a fire for them, and water was heating in a tub and a couple of buckets, sending up wisps of steam into air still a little chill from the night. To the south the animals grazed, herded loosely. Three horsemen were splashing across the river, hurrying to keep from miring in the quicksand that formed the bed. He identified them one by one -Summers and Gorham and the boy, Brownie Evans. He supposed they were going to hunt the buffalo that grazed northward.

     It irritated him that they should set out, for buffalo grazing at a distance, away from where the road led. It was as if they assumed already, prior to the action of the council, that the train wouldn\'t move. Under good discipline the act would have been recognized as an act of impudence, if these people understood that word.

     He blamed Summers most of all -and not for this small offense alone. He had the feeling that Summers contaminated the company with his casual independence, his backwoodsman\'s uncertain respect for authority. Summers knew the trail. He was a good guide, an expert hunter, a watchful scout, a never­sleeping sentinel. He was all of these, Tadlock had to admit to himself, but he was also a man hard to manage or impress, a titan admired for his Indian graces and rude skills and so imitated in attitudes.

     Walking to the council meeting, Tadlock found himself wishing resentfully that he had Summers\' frontier lore to go along with his own impulse for order. It was Summers who suggested, along the Little Blue, that horses be tied to the branches, not the trunks, of trees. That way, he said, they wouldn\'t break the bridle reins. Summers could lure buffalo cows to him by imitating the call of a calf. He could put an arrow or a ball into a cow and leave life enough in her to drive her close to camp, thus eliminating the chore of packing in the meat. And who but Summers would think of tying his horse to the horns of a killed buffalo while he butchered? Summers could handle oxen, mules, horses. He could, it seemed, smell game and water and Indians. He was deadly with rifle and bow. He struck the quickest fire. The manner in which he rounded the wagons into a corral at night was simple and effective, though it did lack military style. For himself, Tadlock would have preferred a method he had been told about, by which the train divided into equal sections, with an officer for each, and made smart right-angle turns and formed a square. Still, he had to admit, Summers\' way was good. Damn the man, anyhow! He was competent -though outwardly modest if somehow insolent­ and independent as a hog on ice! Why couldn\'t a man of wider view, of greater education, possess that wilderness wisdom? Small a qualification as it was, it still would promote the recognition of leadership.

     The other councilmen, out fifty yards or so from the wagons, were waiting. Tadlock checked them off -Evans, Fairman, Mack, Brewer, Daugherty. He sat down by them. "How\'s Martin?"

     "No good," Brewer answered in his thick German. "He vill die, you bet."

     "He\'s tough."

     Evans said, "My woman\'s watchin\' him, along with Brother Weatherby and some others."

     Tadlock nodded, thinking not so much about Martin as about the council, as about an issue that had grown beyond its true importance because it was a challenge to authority. He wished, almost, that he had proposed the delay. Still, it was all right. Brewer he could count on, and Mack and Fairman. They and he would compose a majority. "Still could make ten miles or so," he said, squinting at the sun. "Every mile counts."

     They didn\'t answer. Only Brewer, sitting cross-legged, his paunch spilling over into his lap, so much as nodded.

     "Martin\'s out of his head," Daugherty said in what might have been reproach.

     Tadlock sized him up, wondering now as he had wondered before why this hillside Irishman opposed him. Could he have overheard some incautious criticism of popishness?

     "Just yells Jesus," Evans added. "Yells Jesus and follers with \'To Thee I pray.\' "

     "That doesn\'t show he\'s out of his head."

     "He was never a great one for prayin\'," Daugherty said.

     Tadlock had the feeling that in their faces was the look of something withheld. He studied them, then let his gaze stray off to the camp where the wagons stood idle and the new-done wash stirred on lines the women had run from wagon to wagon. He saw the tent that had been put up to shelter Martin and Weatherby standing by it, his rusty coat donned out of respect to sickness. Women and children moved among the wagons and the fires that were being allowed to die. Women always managed to improve the movement, Tadlock reflected while his eyes went from them to four men who lay by Patch\'s wagon. One of them was stabbing idly at the ground with a knife. He thought he could hear Martin\'s voice, maybe crying to Jesus.

     "Well," he said, "we have a decision to make."

     They didn\'t answer him. They sat waiting, their lids narrowed against the sun. It would be warm today and dazzlingly bright, the sun striking back from the sand and the saltlike patches that lay on it.

     He caught Evans\' eye. "You\'re willing to abide by the decision of the council?"

     "Are you?"

     "Naturally." Tadlock gave his attention to the others. "We need to remember that the trick is to keep moving. It will be late fall before we reach Oregon in any case."

     Evans brought his hand to his face and rubbed his broad cheek as if rubbing helped him to think. "I ain\'t denyin\' what you say, Tadlock, but we been makin\' good time. It ain\'t as if we couldn\'t spare a day or two."

     "We\'ll meet other delays, you know."

     "Maybe so."

     "Delays we can\'t avoid."

     Evans changed his position on the ground. When he spoke he looked at the others. "It don\'t seem to me we have to be so hellbent to beat everybody. Way I figure, we\'ll pass and be passed before this jig is over."

     Mack said, "You\'re half racehorse, Irvine. You\'re bred to run in front."

     "Ya. Better to keep ahead, you bet," Brewer said.

     In his astonishment at Mack, in his rising vexation, Tadlock spoke sharply. "If someone didn\'t push, the whole company would sit on its tail."

     "If one of us was sick, I think we\'d want the train to wait." Fairman put in.

     So they were all against him, Tadlock thought incredulously, all but the thickheaded German. He had led them, he had worked, organized, directed, pushed -and they were all against him. Or were they? When it came finally to decision, wouldn\'t Mack and Fairman side with him? "Let\'s vote," he said. "Mack, Fairman, I assume you\'ll support my recommendation."

     Mack answered, "No." The smile was gone from his face. Fairman was shaking his head.

     "No!"

     "No," Mack said again. Fairman kept shaking his head.

     Evans tossed a piece of buffalo dung at his old gray-whiskered dog, which was digging in a hole near by. "Reckon you\'ll have to wait, Tadlock," he said.

     Tadlock felt the blood hot in his face. "All I have to say is that it\'s a goddam-fool decision."

     Mack spoke quietly. "I have to tell you something else."

     "What?"

     "There\'s a meeting tonight."

     "Meeting?"

     "Whole company."

     "For what?"

     "Can\'t you guess?"

     "This is a guessing game, is it?"

     "They\'re going to unseat you, Irvine."

     "You\'re a goddam liar!"

     "I\'ll wait for your apology."

     The meaning of Mack\'s words, the full import, came to Tadlock slowly. He clenched words back while he considered it. They meant to kick him out. They meant to elect a new captain. He could see how the thing had come about. Patch, the little, stiff-necked New Englander, Daugherty, Gorham, Carpenter -these men, he had known, opposed him, and now they had politicked around, trading on the unpopularity of leadership, making big this little issue of the sick man. "We\'ll see about that," he said to Mack. "I\'ll stand on my position about Martin."

     "Can\'t you see it\'s not just that?" Mack asked.

     "I see. I called you a fool, and that\'s what you were."

     "The world is all a fool to you," the Irishman put in.

     "I was a fool all right," Mack said, the color climbing in his face, "but it\'s not that either, Irvine. It\'s the airs you have. It\'s overbearance."

     "And it is your animals and not enough men for them that slow the train -and you forever cryin\' for speed," Daugherty added. "And it is you and your pushiness that sour us, and that\'s the God\'s truth."

     "You say you\'re not sore," Tadlock said to Mack. "Then where do you stand?"

     "I\'ve got to vote for harmony."

     "What about you, Fairman?"

     Fairman said, "Same here."

     "You can\'t get away with it."

     "You tell him, Brewer," Daugherty said.

     "I be for you," the German explained. "McBee, too. But ve not be enough."

     So it was true. So they had conspired against him. So he had to resign or suffer the humiliation of being voted out. Brewer wouldn\'t lie to him. "That\'s the thanks a man gets. I\'ve worked, figured, risked my neck."

     Evans said -and Mack nodded to the words- "That\'s what makes it hard, Tadlock."

     "I can split this train in two. I have a few friends."

     "You\'re losin\' \'em by the minute," Evans said with what for him was heat.

  Tadlock lurched to his feet. "To hell with all of youl" Not until he had taken a half a dozen steps away could he bring himself to throw back, "I resign."

     Tadlock walked to his lead wagon. "I just quit," he told his wife.

     She was seated on a box, mending a pair of trousers that he had ripped in loading the wagon. She gazed at him without speaking.

     "It was resign or get kicked out," he went on, getting a kind of perverse satisfaction out of the admission.

    Still she didn\'t speak. In ten years of married life, he thought with a stir of pleasure, she had learned better than to inquire into his business. What he wanted her to know, he would tell her. He waited, almost hoping she would put a question so that he could spend his outrage on her.

     When he didn\'t go on, she said, "Martin\'s worse."

     "I guess that\'s my fault!"

     "I didn\'t mean it was anybody\'s fault."

     "If we\'d been traveling, everyone would have said it was mine. They\'d have been glad to say that."

     "I\'m glad you resigned."

     "So you\'re glad, are you!"

     "You take it so hard."

     He grunted, disarmed. She was one, anyhow, who knew how much he gave.

     She stitched quietly for a minute as if thinking about him and his resignation, but when she spoke it was to say, "Martin depended on you. I think you were the only friend he had."

    "I don\'t know anything to do for him."

     "I know, but-"

     He walked around to Martin\'s tent. Brother Weatherby was outside, holding an old Bible.

     Tadlock asked, "Well?"

     "I have been praying. The Lord\'s will be done." "Out of his head?"

     "Now. Yes."

     Tadlock stuck his head inside the tent. Martin lay on his back, his mouth open and his eyeballs showing white through lids not quite closed. Listening, Tadlock heard the light, fast breath of fever. He stepped back, repelled by the sight and sound and smell of sickness. There was nothing he could do, he told himself. What did they think he was? A doctor?

     Weatherby said, "I think he saw the light."

     "Calomel work?"

     Weatherby nodded, and Tadlock went back to his wagon.

     He spent a bitter, fiddley day. He kept going over what had happened and experienced each time a renewed injury and anger. He examined and repaired wagons and equipment and went back twice to Martin\'s tent. On his second trip he found Martin alone and soiled and senseless. Here was something he could do. Here was something, by God, he would do. No one could say he was indifferent or neglectful or heedless of the discipline he asked of others. Washing Martin off, he wondered fiercely who would do as much. As he finished, Byrd came in. Byrd had a lancet and thought, like others, that bleeding would be good for Martin. Tadlock helped bleed him.

     The meeting of the men at night was what might have been expected -a common hurly-burly made more orderless by the women and children who were allowed to press around. Thinking about it afterwards, Tadlock was still surprised that Evans and not Patch was elected to succeed him. He would have sworn that Patch was agitating in the interests of himself. Evans himself had acted honestly astonished when Mack put his name in nomination. He had turned and looked at his wife and then stumbled ahead. "Nope, Mr. Chairman. I ain\'t cut out for it."

     Seated at a little distance where he could hear and see enough but still not dignify the meeting with his presence, Tadlock had caught the look on Mrs. Evans\' face. It was an expression he couldn\'t describe, of motherliness, concern, pride, assurance, Ambition -he didn\'t know what. But for an instant, before he thrust it aside, he had the feeling it would be good to be looked at that way. His second thought was that only big, dull, forceless men ever could be so regarded.

     Another thing stuck in his memory as he sat by his wagon in the gathering dark after the meeting had adjourned. It was the parliamentary disorder that was allowed to prevail, the promise of the general disorder to come. While Evans\' name was still in nomination, Turley piped up, irrelevant to the subject, and Patch let him proceed. "We\'re a-turnin\' back." Turley\'s voice was a high whine. "Me and my woman and young­\'uns, we\'re a-turnin\' back, by Moses!"

     Mrs. Turley shouted from among the women, "Amen! Amen!" Tadlock heard her crying hysterically afterwards, as he had heard overwrought women cry at revivals.

     "We\'re headin\' backwards for the Meramec," Turley went on, "seein\'s this company won\'t wait for others and seein\'s everybody is at outs besides. Who wants to turn back with us, welcome."

     Patch asked, "What about it, Summers?"

     Summers stood off to Patch\'s right. He said one word: "Dangerous."

     A little silence followed -except for Mrs. Turley\'s crying­ that Patch broke by asking, "Anyone else want to turn back?" He waited. "Byrd?"

     That, Tadlock had thought through his bitterness, was good management, was one accidental stroke of good management. Let Byrd say yes or no. Get him committed and hold him to it.

     Byrd said he\'d stick.

     Patch went on, "If anyone plans to split off from the train, we\'d like to know it now." He didn\'t look toward Tadlock but others turned to do so. Tadlock stared back, silent and unmoving. Split off? How could he split off? It was an impulsive threat he\'d made. Who would go with him? Brewer and McBee and Martin, maybe, if he lived. A sorry lot, without oxen enough and some of those already sore of foot. He sat stiff and wordless, but he wanted to jump up and cry out, calling them the ingrates that they were. He felt like rising with his whip and lashing them one and all until they saw the truth of things. Cattle? Drivers? The charge was just a cheap excuse. Hadn\'t he brought Martin along and scoured Independence for a man and finally made a deal with Hank McBee to help out with the hundred and ten head of stock he had? Hadn\'t he done the best he could -and not because they forced him to it, either?

     For a long time after the session was over Tadlock sat still, seeing but still not seeing the people who passed gingerly, knowing his wife had gone somewhere and wondering how she could mix with those who had mistreated him.

     The camp quieted to low, good-night tones and by and by they quieted, too, and of human voices there was just a murmur from Martin\'s tent, which had been pitched at the other side of the corral where water was close. One by one the fires winked out. The stars came on, cold-bright as faraway suns. Southward Tadlock could see the horizon rolling against the sky. A child cried in one of the tents, cried a frail cry that silence closed around.

     Tadlock, he thought, trying to see the name apart from himself. Irvine Tadlock, who\'d left a paying business in Peoria to try his talents in a bigger field and had been undone by ragtag emigrants. Tadlock, who liked discipline and method and knew how to organize, who, but for the stories this crowd would take along, might in time have been the territorial governor, the governor of the eventual state.

     What now? he asked. What, since these chuckleheads could blight him? Texas? Could he get to Texas? Just this past spring it had been asked into the Union. It would need leaders -a governor, senators, representatives. California? Some said California was a better place than Oregon. It would offer opportunities. It would stand in need of able men.

     He felt his wife\'s hand on his shoulder. "You\'d better come to bed, Irvine."

     "I know when it\'s bedtime. You don\'t need to tell me when to go to bed."

     "It\'s late, Irvine."

     "What of it? I\'ve got to look at Martin yet."

     "I\'ve been there. There\'s nothing more you can do. They\'re trying mustard."

     "You go on to bed."

     He waited a few minutes, just to assert himself, and then got up and went into the tent and took off his coat and hat and shoes. Texas? California? They needed men all right. They needed leaders.

  He stepped outside in his bare feet and picked up the whip that he had forgotten on the ground and put it in his wagon and went back into the tent and lay down by his wife.

     He was just getting to sleep, after what seemed a lifetime of sleeplessness, when Weatherby came by to tell him Martin had died.',

            '[ap 06:40] The Way West - A. B. Guthrie Jr_.epub (OEBPS/Text/The Way West - A B Guthrie Jr.html) - Six-forty',
            'EVANS LAID the yoke on one of his oxen and pinned the bow and spoke to the teammate, holding the yoke up while the second animal stepped into place, its ankles creaking. It was a satisfaction to a man to have well-trained stock, he told himself while he worked. Saved time and trouble.

     When he had his teams yoked and ready to hitch, he looked at the watch Mack had lent him. <<Six-forty|9j>>. He would be ready in good time, as befitted the captain. Not all the tents were struck yet, nor the wagons loaded. Inside the corral where he stood some of the other men were beginning to get busy with oxen just driven in, and outside it others were pulling tent pegs and lowering poles and folding the tents afterwards and then lifting their plunder into the wagons. They worked fast, grunting to their chores as men did with sleep still in them and the muscles stiff from the night. The women had scraped and scoured the breakfast things and stood inside the wagons, helping arrange the loads. Or they had wandered off, some with their young ones in tow, to empty themselves and so be ready for the morning drive.

     Morning, Evans thought, was a time of fret, before the circle broke and the train got strung out on the trail. When the men quit their grunting it was to speak sharp, and to be answered sharp by women who were tired, too, and felt the load of the day too heavy. The young ones cried or yelled, being cranky or frisky, one. The boxes made a clatter as they were pitched into wagon beds. Now and then one of the oxen driven in for yoking would line out neck and head and let out a long bawl. Underneath the louder noises was the steady hum of mosquitoes that made a little cloud around every head.

     Evans stooped and gave Rock a pat on the head and straightened and stretched, pulling in a deep breath through his mouth.

     The air had a taste to it here, a taste light and sharp as high­spirit drink. For all the fret he felt good.

     "Be a nice day, Becky," he said, looking between the wagons to where she worked outside. She had just closed and latched with its leather hasp the box that held pots and kettles and tools to eat with.

     "I almost wish it would blow and clear out the mosquitoes," she said.

     "They won\'t be so bad oncet we roll. Ain\'t hardly a stir of air."

     It was cool enough, but the sun was beginning to work. In the direction of it he saw Courthouse Rock, looming big yet, its near side purple with shadow. Off to his right apiece Chimney Rock rose slim and rusty. In a land that was all pretty much the same a man wouldn\'t think to see so much color-purple and rust, the gray of the sandbars, the sun slanted yellow as butter on the long flats, the sky so blue it hurt the eye. In all the sky there wasn\'t a cloud.

     He said, "I never feel so sure as on a good morning."

     "Sure?"

     "About everything." He stepped across and lifted the cook­box and put it in the wagon and brought the cover snug with its drawstring. "Nothing left but to hitch."

     He stepped back into the corral and angled through the oxen, looking to see if anyone needed help, and came to where Hig and Fairman were wrestling with an ornery steer. They had a rope over its horns that Hig was trying to hold while Fairman lifted the yoke. They held up when they saw him.

     Hig gave Evans his thin smile while he bent back with the rope. "I\'d as lief yoke a buffalo as this damn ox."

     "Whyn\'t you take a hitch on a spoke?"

     "Comin\' to that," Hig answered. "On\'y I hate to. I got a bet up with this critter, by God, that I\'ll hold him or bust." Keeping the rope tight with one hand, he took the loose end of it with the other and looped it over a wheel spoke and drew it up. "I\'m busted."

     Evans clapped the ox on the rump. It stepped ahead balkily while Hig snubbed it.

     "I\'m shy of good work stock," Fairman said, his forehead wrinkled with the thought of it. He rubbed the mosquitoes off the back of one hand. "Sore feet. The sand wears the hoofs down to nothing."

     "Same with all of us. By and by the hoofs\'ll get tougher, they tell me. I been cleanin\' \'em off and puttin\' hot tar in the cracks."

     Evans walked on. Dick Summers was throwing packs on a couple of horses, packs that held his little plunder and that of Brother Weatherby. Weatherby stood by, as always, looking as if he\'d like to help if only he knew how. Evans spoke to them and got Dick\'s quiet grin and a solemn nod from Weatherby.

     "Ready," Dick said, tying one horse to the pack saddle of the other. He took the lead rope. "Reckon they\'d foller all right, but maybe I better tie on to your wagon again. Might scour off."

     "I\'ll be along."

     It seemed everybody was about ready, even the McBees, who couldn\'t ever seem to be on time. Until lately they couldn\'t, that was. "Mornin\'." His idea was working all right, Evans thought, feeling again part proud and part guilty that it was. He hadn\'t been captain long until he called the men together one night, to find what was on their minds and to hear any grumbles and especially to cure the fault of late and ragged starting. He had told Mack his idea, and Mack had helped him, asking the men how about it: if a man was late he lost his place in line and had to bring up the rear? They had thought it was Mack\'s plan and had voted yes and now no one was late; but ,till Evans felt a little guilty. It struck him as somehow sneaky, this trick of rigging a meeting. It was better, though, than laying down the law on his own, better than cracking an ox whip.

     McBee said, "How be you?" and Mrs. McBee stuck her head f rom the tail of the wagon and gave him a pleasant good morning. Three McBee boys were chasing each other. They circled around and stopped, looking at Evans from under hair that didn\'t know a comb. Evans didn\'t see Mercy around.

     "What we waitin\' fer?" McBee asked, set up over being ready. His whiskers moved to a smile.

     Evans consulted his watch. "\'Bout time." Looking between the wagons, he saw the horse herd, out for its quick morning graze, and the loose cattle that Brownie and the other drivers had brought close.

     "Been meanin\' to talk to you," McBee told him as if he had something important on his mind.

     "About what?"

     "I\'ll be seein\' you. It\'s personal-like."

     So it was personal. Evans didn\'t like the thought. "Any time."

     He went over to his own wagons and hitched the teams and saw Rebecca to her perch and took out his watch again. It was time, lacking a minute or so. Summers sat a horse at the wagon that would break the circle. It was already pulled out a little, ready for the start. Mounted near Summers were Shields and Carpenter and Brewer, who would ride ahead today. Evans could see Tadlock standing alongside Summers, holding his silver trumpet. Evans had asked Tadlock if he wouldn\'t keep on sounding the horn, just as he did while captain. Out of a kind of sympathy he\'d asked him, thinking maybe Tadlock prized the task. Besides, the trumpet was Tadlock\'s. Evans had to grin at himself, wondering which was the real reason. Anyhow, Tadlock had agreed, in that new and hard-eyed way of his.

    Tadlock looked across at him, and Evans raised his arm, and the trumpet sounded. Teamsters spoke. Whips popped. Oxen pushed into the yokes. Axles whined. Dust puffed up. With commands and pops, with whines and dust the circle unwound. The On-to-Oregon train was rolling. Evans\' place was near the tail of the line. Walking out a little from his team, he could see Summers and the horsemen and the wagons lurching along behind them, the distance from wagon to wagon growing as the train settled to the drive. They would be farther spread before the morning was over. It was a thing he must watch, he reminded himself. They could be too far spread for safety against Indians. Back of him the loose stock was ambling into line.

     Indians could raise the devil if they wanted to, though he didn\'t look for them to do it, not since a bunch of mounted soldiers had passed by. Dragoons, they called themselves, the First Dragoons, led by a Colonel Kearny, who said their purpose was to awe the Indians and to warn them they\'d better leave the emigrants alone. Three hundred men or thereabouts were in the bunch, not to mention wagons drawn by mules and two wheeled cannons and butcher beef and sheep that came along behind. They were in a hurry, bound for Laramie and onward to the Southern Pass, where they\'d turn back. Watching them press on, their blues and golds proud in the rising dust, Evans had felt easier in his captaincy.

     Other things were right enough. People were in good spirit and in good health except for the diarrhea that Platte water or too much fresh meat brought on. They had got across the South Platte, double-yoking every wagon on the advice of Summers and stringing ropes between some and splashing through the quicksand fast. For a while they had followed along the north shore and then angled across and come to Ash Hollow and the North Fork. It was a good place to remember, Ash Hollow was. "There was shade there and cool-water springs and good grass, and the wagons had got down the hills that ringed it with no more damage than one tip-over.

     So, in time, they had reached Courthouse Rock and the tower that stood close by and had camped on a creek there, and people had felt like celebrating, as if, coming to a known name, they could be sure they were on the right track. Or more as if they were nearing home and had caught sight of a thing to mark it by. The celebration was quiet, though. Weatherby had field services, and nobody had made light of him, thinking of Martin and the Turleys.

     For a long time the Turleys had been in sight after the train pulled out. They had squatted there with their old wagon and their few head of stock, refusing to go with the company but still not starting the other way, as if quitting the bunch had taken all their get-up and now they would just wait for whatever. They had squatted, Turley and Mrs. Turley and their two thin children, watching out of stubborn eyes, saying thanks and no more for the sweetening and flour and bacon that Rebecca and Mrs. Mack and Mrs. Tadlock had left with them against the time that buffalo and antelope ran out. To watch them, to hear their noisy mouths now held to a bare word or two, a man would think that the company was treating them wrong. It wasn\'t so, but still no one felt quite easy. Like the others, Evans kept turning his head as the train went on, realizing as the distance grew how small the Turleys were a man and his woman and his young ones and a ram­shackle outfit pressed on all sides by the great emptiness, or not pressed but loose and lost on the long flats, among the bald sand hills.

     After what seemed a long time the Turleys had got moving, pulling a little tail of dust and shrinking with distance until at last distance swallowed them. Trying to spot them, Evans couldn\'t be sure but what he saw was just a fleck in the eye. He wasn\'t extra religious, but he felt better because Weatherby had prayed for them, begging God to keep the Indians off, and the storms and the accidents, and please, God, guard Thy sheep.

     Just before, Weatherby had given Martin into God\'s keeping. Evans and Summers and Tadlock himself had dug the grave, dug it in silence while each man thought his own thoughts, and when it was ready they laid Martin by it, and Weatherby came and read out of the Book, taking Ephesians again. Not having a coffin or wood for one, they wrapped Martin in the blanket he laid on and lowered him and shoveled the sand in. Then Dick burned gunpowder over the grave and had them trail the stock across. That way, he said, wolves or Indians weren\'t likely to find the body. Neither, Evans figured, was anyone else, or anything. It was a lost grave as soon as left, and Martin\'s bones would lie in it till kingdom come, and buffalo would gallop over the spot and wolves trot across and wagon trains track it, and none would know that here lay what was left of a man -a dull-eyed man with bowed shoulders but with hankerings and troubles and rights of his own, who had set out for Oregon and got sick and cried out to Jesus and died.

     Evans thought with a little turn about shaving Martin. Rebecca said he ought to do that. A man should go to his grave looking decent, she said. And so he had scraped off the wiry whiskers, and they had dressed Martin up in the best clothes he had, which weren\'t much, though Martin made a nice-enough looking corpse, considering.

     The train had got under way then, Evans feeling low in his timid and small in his new place as captain, as if he couldn\'t come it, and Dick had ridden up and unforked his horse and walked along with him.

     He was glad for Dick\'s friendship. He leaned on Dick. He was stronger inside because of him. Maybe that showed he wasn\'t fit for captain. Maybe a captain ought to be stout enough to stand alone, wanting no help from anyone except the help hat would be expected of any pilot, like advice on crossings and routes and watch-outs for Indians. Well, that wasn\'t how he was cut. Never, anywhere, had he wanted to be boss. So he would lean on Dick, and when hard questions came up he would call the council together. They would have solid ideas. But there would still be times, he realized uncomfortably, when he would have to act. A captain had to be more than a leaner and a caller of meetings. He had to give confidence to people, and encouragement. He had to see, one way or another, that the train kept together and kept going. He had to lead, no matter if he didn\'t want to, else the train would fail. He wished he had just his own family to watch out for.

     Evans blew the dust out of his nose and brought a hand up and wiped his eyes. The valley was deeper here and narrower, and a traveler saw new kinds of plants, like the spiny clumps that Summers called Spanish bayonet and Weatherby said was Adam\'s needle. Flowers he didn\'t have a name for waved along the way, some coned and some daisied, colored purple and white and yellow. The women and children were forever picking posies if the day was fair. Here they would have to be careful. Rattlesnakes were getting thick. It would be just luck if someone didn\'t get bit. The thought troubled him. It added itself to his feeling of burden.

     In a way it was as if all hands had entrusted their future to him, expecting him to have the sense and force to see them through. And some of them he hardly knew, except to pass a good morning! There was Fairman\'s man, Botter, and Mack\'s tiand, Moss, and Shields and Carpenter and Insko and Davisworth. They had voted for him, he reckoned, or anyhow not against him. He made a note to himself to get better acquainted. Because they were not forward men or easy met, he had let himself stand off. A captain ought to know his company down to the last pup.

     He looked back and saw that Rebecca had climbed from the wagon and was walking alongside. He winked at her. She had thinned some on the road, but she didn\'t seem so worn as before or to get so tired and sore. He didn\'t know when he had seen more life in her face.

     He cleaned his nose again, holding one nostril closed with his finger and then the other. He figured he would arrive in Oregon with some of the Platte sand on him. Sandy water didn\'t wash off sand.

  Anyhow the wind wasn\'t pushing at them today. The dust puffed straight up and powdered him and settled back slow, so that, turning again, he saw the hanging trail of it far beyond the cattle. The sun rode friendly, just warm enough for comfort. A few white clouds had come into the sky. The mosquitoes had thinned out, likely resting for the night siege.

     The Tadlock wagons rolled ahead of him, Tadlock walking by the side, still wearing the many-pocketed coat he had put on in the chill of early morning. He walked straight and square, with his head up. Tadlock had taken his upset fairly well, Evans said to himself, feeling easier at the thought. He had stuck mostly to himself, not marching around with his eye out for fault, but he stood his turn at guard and spoke civil enough, though spare-worded and unsmiling; and he had made a deal with Brewer, now that Martin was dead, for Brewer\'s twelve-year-old to help with the stock and spell Mrs. Tadlock at his second wagon.

     Evans hawed his team, following the swing-out of the line. The wagons creaked and jolted and in some places ground in the sand. Now and then he could hear the rattle of a loose tire that Hig, the handyman, would have to fix. He had a system better than driving wedges between tire and felloe. He took the tire off and shaved a thin hoop and tacked it to the felloe and heated the tire and put it back on. Made something extra doing it, too, though he would rather play his fiddle for a reel.

     At Laramie there would be a bellows and other tools, probably, and they could cut and weld the tires and fit them snug. But til then Hig\'s system was all right. They would buy supplies at Laramie, too, if they could, stuff like flour and smoked buffalo tongues. And some were talking about buying oxen or trading their sore-footed ones. How far to Laramie? How far did Dick say from Chimney Rock? Sixty miles or so? With good going they would be there in four days, five anyhow. Ahead and to the left the hills were beginning to run high and ragged, leading, Evans supposed, to Scott\'s Bluffs. Closer at hand he saw A half dozen wild horses gazing down from the ridge, their heads held high. While Evans watched, McBee came riding up from the cow column, his whiskers gray with dust. He spit and smiled. "Critters are gettin\' along all right. I\'ll keep my eye back."

     It was the report, Evans understood, of a man to his captain, the report unasked and needless, said to show the sayer knew the due of leadership. He didn\'t like it or the manner of its saying.

     McBee got off his horse and walked along with Evans. "\'Y God, she\'s a fair day."

     "Good enough for anyone." Without thinking why until afterwards, Evans turned and saw old Rock following at his heels. He wondered then if the only reason he didn\'t take to McBee was that McBee had wanted to kill his dog. No, he decided. He wouldn\'t go for McBee regardless. He was dirty and shiftless, and there was nothing to him anyhow. Not to him or his wife, either -and how they got a pretty thing like Mercy beat him. He had to admit she was not only pretty but seemed to be a good-enough girl. She couldn\'t be much underneath, though, not with that breeding. Give her a few years and a few young ones and she\'d be just like Ma and Pa, he guessed, and then brought himself up. He reckoned the Lord had the right to visit the sins of the father -but not Lije Evans. He owed her a chance, just as a man owed anyone a chance, but still he was relieved that Brownie wasn\'t following after her.

     "I said to my woman today, \'y God, we\'re a-goin\' to make it. Fer a time I didn\'t know, fer a fact."

  Evans tried to imagine what McBee\'s face was like under the mat of whiskers. Slack-jawed, probably, and loose-lipped. Weak. And yet there was something tough about him, as there was often about ornery people, something that kept him going, something tougher than the stuff of Turleys.

     "Yes, sir, we\'re a-goin\' to make it." McBee grinned, showing teeth broken and dirty beyond believing, and bobbed his head.

     Watching him, hearing him, Evans knew. This was it, plain in the words, the smiles, the bobs of the head. McBee meant them to be admiring. McBee was courting the captain. He was honey-fuggling, wanting the importance of the shadow of importance. He would have something especial to say; he would have something to bring up-but this was it.

     "We always were going to make it," Evans said.

     "That is as may be. Anyhow, we are now."

     Evans didn\'t give him an answer. He knew what he ought to do. He ought to tell McBee to go to hell; but it was a hard thing. Somehow a man balked at slapping the compliment out of another\'s mouth. Not that it was the compliment, either. Compliments didn\'t fool him. He just hated to speak blunt to friendliness, even if the friendliness was only a show.

     McBee said, "I been meanin\' to tell you, I don\'t hold no hard feelin\'s. About the dog and all. Nary one."

     "All right. None here, either. Over that."

     "Like my woman was sayin\' today, you was bound to work up to captain."

     "I didn\'t work for it."

     "Course not."

     Evans turned on him then and spoke with more than the needed stress because he disliked what he had to say. "McBee, you better stick with Tadlock."

     McBee\'s loose mouth closed. Deep in his puddled brown eyes Evans saw the sudden, skulky glint of hatred. "Oh, sure. I aim to do that." He walked along in silence for a while, leading his horse, and then said, "Reckon I better be gettin\' back." He climbed the horse and rode away.

     Evans watched him and then shortened his gaze, seeing Rebecca smiling the twisted smile of knowing and old Rock padding between them.

     Now, more than ever, he told himself, he would have to watch the man, not for any open act but for some sly and miserable trick. He would ask Brownie to keep close watch on their stock, as he would himself. It was hard to believe anyone was underhanded, though, until the proof came out.',

            '[ap 04:00] The Way West - A. B. Guthrie Jr_.epub (OEBPS/Text/The Way West - A B Guthrie Jr.html) - four o\'clock',
            'THE HIGH SWEETWATER, flowered along its banks. The Southern Pass. The buttes now named for Oregon. The Sandys, Big and Little. The Green that trappers knew as the Prairie Hen or Seeds-kee-dee and, before that, as the Spanish River, winding wooded in the tableland of sage. High country, chill by night with the snow that patched the Winds, lonesome and good as when Dick Summers first had seen it but with the scar of wear on it, the scar of wheels that later wheels would deepen. The Winds rising, naked and bright in the sun, broody in the dusk, hiding the high valleys where he had set his traps, hiding the shame of no beaver where beaver once were plenty.

     If he sniffed, he smelled the smoke of quaking asp, and, looking, saw the little fire and him and Jim Deakins and Boone Caudill seated around it while meat cooked on roasting sticks. If he listened, he heard the old voices raised at rendezvous, the hearty, young, old voices that laughed at age and change, the voices rich with strength and whisky, shouting over horse races or the Indian game of hand, the full and easy voices good­tempered by the squaws. Smoke of campfires lifting slow, hi-ya, Bill, and hi-ya, Buck, tepees white against the green, horse herds frisky in the mornings, coyotes singing in the nights, bright blankets on soft shoulders, held around young breasts, and young country all about, high valleys, beavered streams, good hunting, youth on the land, youth in the loins, and youth and youth and youth to youth, and who\'d have thought then it would pass?

     Deakins was dead and Caudill disappeared, and of the mountain men who had hunted and spreed and squawed with him, was there a handful left? He didn\'t want much to see them, with years in their faces and aches in their bones and the past in their heads so that all they could talk about, while whisky stirred dead fires, was this and that of long ago. Like with Joe Walker, a mountain man if ever one lived, whom the train had met on the pass, and he so changed that Summers hardly knew him, strong yet and able but with a half-sore sadness because his world was gone. Like with Tom Fitzpatrick, whom they\'d met still earlier, guiding Colonel Kearny\'s Dragoons back from the divide. Tom wasn\'t one to hang his feelings out, but in his face were old rememberings. It would be the same with Jim Bridger and Old Vaskiss at their fort down on the fork.

     He had given the fort the go-by, taking a short cut, hard as it was, to the Green and on toward the Bear, for the train had food enough and the oxen were harder-footed than before and the wagons mostly in fair shape, though shrunk and shaken some by the long, dry, sandy miles between Pacific Springs and the Little Sandy.

     Still, he had been uneasy, for the desert of the Green was rough going even for hard-case hunters and horses lightly packed. Could wagons and oxen make it, and farmers and town­livers and women and their young? He had dragged the short cut back to memory, had hoofed again the forty-odd dry miles of it, over thirsty sagebrush and rifted gravel and down the harsh fall to the Green, the wind fierce in his face, the day sun­stroke-hot or snow-cold, for desert weather seemed always one or other. But it was water that mattered most, or the want of it. Not any place was there a drink for man or brute.

     "I do\' know," he said to the council that Evans had called together. "I\'m thinkin\' we can come it, but it\'s hard and chancey."

     Mack asked, "And if we do?"

     "Save two days, at the least."

     "And if we don\'t?"

     "No don\'t to it. There can\'t be any don\'t."

     "It\'s worse, I reckon, than anything before?" Evans said.

     "A heap."

     "Worse\'n what we\'re bound to meet?"

     "There\'s a lot of hell ahead, Lije, beyond Fort Hall."

     "\'Bout time we were gettin\' a taste of hell then."

     Tadlock agreed to that, saying, "We\'re not traveling for pleasure. Maybe we can cut ahead of that company that passed us."

     "If\'n it\'s hot, we\'ll have to roll by night."

     "We ain\'t scared of the dark, Dick," Evans said.

     And so they had decided on the short cut, partly maybe because it was a dare, partly, Summers thought a little uneasily, because they didn\'t know how fierce the trip could be.

     They had cut right at the Little Sandy and headed across the divide and rolled down to the Big and filled buckets there and kegs and barrels eaten empty and had waited until the day cooled, for the sun was hot as a blister. At <<four o\'clock|6>> by the watch that Evans carried, Summers had led them out.

  They traveled all night, bumping over the sagebrush, grinding by the beds of old lakes, crunching in the rifts of gravel, dusting through the sand, while the moon came up and watched and tired of watching and went to bed, leaving the land so black Summers wondered if his sense of direction would guide him right.

     As the desert lightened with the coming of the sun, they stopped and doled out water for the critters and turned them loose for what little bait that grew and breakfasted on dried meat and bread baked day before and yoked up again and went on, the venturesomeness of the night worn off, strain in the faces now, droop in the bodies, lag in the legs that pushed feet through the sand. And this was just the easier part of it! Behind them the sun fired up, making distance dance ahead. There never was such a day in his remembering, Summers thought as <<noon|13>> scorched close, none so hot or breathless, none that made a reach of miles appear so far. He rode ahead and back and back and ahead, hunting in old memories for the way, seeing could he help with team or teamster when the course was set. There never was such a day. None in which a trust had weighed so heavy on him.

     Roll! he urged from inside. Roll, goddam it, roll! Roll, you graybacks! Roll or die, while heat smothers you and your hearts pound in your headsl Roll for the Green! Roll coughing in the dust! Poke the goddam oxen! Rol!

     Think, Summers! Think hard! Left or right or straight ahead? How was it long ago? You can\'t be wrong. How was it now? Left, it\'s left it was, left by the bulge of hill. Point the party left!

     The McBee girl looking sick, sweating pale beside the wagon. Up, young\'un, and ride. You want to catch a stroke? Sand and heard cobwebbed on the face of Hank McBee. Sand rivered on the sweating other faces. The beat of blood in the cheeks. Emptiness in the women\'s eyes, the look of seeking for a piece of shade. One ox down, and it unanswering to goad or whip, its eyes big and sad. Kill it! Kill it out of kindness while the ravens wait and bring up another and go on. One ox don\'t count, Brewer. Not in this fix. Roll for the Green!

     Fairman done in and laid out in his wagon and his woman crying, and the sick heat-flush in the fair-skinned faces of Daugherty and Byrd, and what\'s a cracked lip now? Go it, you hosses! Poke up the oxen that walk low-headed, bawling hoarse for water. Come on, you women with your crosspatch pups! You wanted Oregon, didn\'t you? Pray, Weatherby, pray but plod, and no knucklin\' under to the will of God!

     By Jesus, Summers thought, these folks were strong, strong in purpose even when weak in body. Rebecca Evans walking stout, mettled like a good mare; Lije helping those he could, encouraging all, his broad cheeks grayed by sand; Patch, Mack, Brewer, Shields, and Tadlock -damn him!- and their women, and the herders clouded by the dust. Judith Fairman driving while a tear washed down her face, Mack\'s woman stepping squinch-eyed, her chin hard to the west, and Daugherty un­heeding the thumping sickness in him.

     Strong folks, and strong for what? For Oregon and fish and farms, for wheat and sheep and nation. And now it came to him, while his own skull tapped to the heat, that that was what had ailed the mountain man -he didn\'t hanker after things; he had all that he wanted.

     It was push now, pull and push and strain at spokes, for some teams couldn\'t climb a rise alone. Push or double-team. Push to the whistle of breath and the shower of sweat and the hammer in the skull. Push, Lije! You\'re a bull for work, I\'m thinkin\'. Push, Mack and Tadlock, Brewer and Patch and Shields! Stout hosses, you all. Push! It ain\'t so far now. Less\'n I thought. Lead team needs some pushin\', Lije. By God, there she is!

     There it was, the Green and shade and rest for all and pasture for the ganted stock. It was still half a dozen miles away, down a long pitch too steep to drive and then across a humpy bottom, but the sight of it was like a double drink of whisky, and flushed faces broke into smiles and grainy voices joked, saying, "What was it you said, Summers? Chancey? The word ain\'t knee-high to it. We made it, though, good as ary mountain man." Women and children came from the line of wagons and stood chattering, the strain gone and the fret.

     The men unyoked the teams and let the wagons down with ropes, made serious again by work under the punishing sun, grunting to the pull of lines against arm sockets while the sweat ran out of them.

     When they were down and the teams brought up and hitched, Summers said to Evans, "Lije, these critters\'ll be a handful when they smell water. Run away, that\'s what they\'ll do, and dive in, wagons an\' all."

     "What you tellin\' me, Dick?"

     "I\'m thinkin\' we best drive on a piece and turn \'em loose and herd \'em forwards till they smell it. Plenty of time to get the wagons later."

     "Thanks, Dick. Wasn\'t for you, I\'d be a prize captain now, wouldn\'t I?"

     "I don\'t see no flies on you."

     "Cold water on hot stummicks ain\'t so good."

     "No helpin\' it."

     "I\'ll get the oxen and horses and loose cattle scattered out some, so\'s they don\'t run over each other. What about Injuns?"

     "No need to worry much."

     It came out as Summers knew it would. Once they winded water, the critters wouldn\'t be held. They galloped crazy for it and plunged in. One ox he saw had just his snoot above the surface. Afterwards, with some of the sizzle gone out of the day, the men with strength left in them brought the wagons up. The cutoff hadn\'t been too bad but only close to bad. One ox dead of  thirst and one of water and quite a few thrown off their feed. No wagons lost. No people dead. Of the sick ones all recovered quick, even Charlie Fairman.',

            'LIJE EVANS kicked his horse out ahead of the train, which was readying to roll. The wagons were supplied and repaired. The gab was gabbed. The marriage was done. So come on! Get started! Time to move. Can\'t spend the livelong day on a wedding and a lost dog. Snow\'ll be flying in Oregon before you know it. Follow along, Mr. and Mrs. George Brown Evans!

     He set himself in the saddle and kicked Nellie again. The day was gray, and the wind blew cold, and it might rain before ri ight, the driving, small-dropped rain that was different from a shower. Good day for a wedding. Good day for one wedding, anyhow. Good day to hook up with a McBee.

  But there wasn\'t any point in stewing, or any point in thinking more. The milk was spilt. He would think about the trail and about the life ahead and the house he would build or about California and the folks who\'d stayed behind to follow Greenwood -Tadlock and Brewer and Davisworth, and here was McBee in his thoughts again, in-law Hank McBee and his in­law brood. There was one thing, anyhow: he wouldn\'t have to put up but with one McBee. The picture wasn\'t all black. There was a little lining on the cloud, like on the blown rain cloud ahead.

     He had cut McBee off when, just before the wedding, McBee had shown he might change his mind about going to California. "Never can tell what\'ll happen," McBee had said. There was a flicker in his muddy eye that Evans took for an invitation to be asked to trail along. "Pret\' near wisht I hadn\'t quit the train."

    "Prob\'ly you\'ll like it in California."

     "Oh, sure, sure. That\'s a good girl your boy\'s gettin\'. Like I was sayin"\' -the eye flickered again, this time, Evans thought, with a return of the old dislike- "you never can tell what\'ll happen."

     "Can\'t tell." Evans moved away and figured he\'d done right. It wasn\'t that he shied off from the help that McBee would Always need; he wasn\'t a chinchy man, he hoped. It was just that McBee was McBee and his woman his woman, and no worth to either of them. Fine thing to have them around! Meet my in-law, Hank McBee. There\'s a face, I reckon, behind them whiskers, and what passes for a man inside them clothes.

     Evans looked back of him and saw the train lining out at last and Dick Summers riding by the lead team, understanding, Evans knew, that sometimes a man wanted to be alone and wear himself in to a hurtful fact.

     He didn\'t guess the McBees felt hurt. Like as not they welcomed the sudden news about Brownie and the girl, for it meant one less mouth to feed, though he had to say that Mercy carned her keep. She helped with the meals and managed the younger ones and often drove the team and never grumbled that he had heard about. Likely her ma and pa were tickled, though, to join up with a family that kept their noses wiped.

     Evans yanked his hat tight and cocked a shoulder against the wind, telling himself that what he couldn\'t help he couldn\'t help. So forget it. And forget Brownie and last night and his own arguments that came to nothing. Spent wind, that\'s all they were.

     "Marry!" he had said, unbelieving.

     Brownie had been waiting in the darkness at the gate, after the talk with Greenwood, and had drawn him off to tell him.

     "That\'s what I aim to do, Pa."

     "Marry! When?"

     "Mornin\'."

     "To who?"

     "You know. To Mercy."

     "Well, now, wait -look, boy- it ain\'t a thing to be decided all at once."

     "It\'s decided."

     Brownie never had talked to him like this, never had taken a stand and stated it so thin and stubborn- voiced as if no words could budge him. Evans found himself wishing for light, so he could see the boy\'s face and the boy could see his. In the dark they were just two voices. He grabbed at what came to mind. "Them McBees -old Hank, now-"

     "It ain\'t him I\'m marryin\'."

     "That\'s what you think!"

     "It don\'t matter, anyhow."

     "You talked to him?"

     "Not yit."

     "Or the girl?"

     "She\'s waitin\'."

     "She know her ma and pa\'s goin\' to California?"

     "That don\'t matter, either. But I won\'t be marryin\' ol\' Hank then, like you said I would."

     "You ain\'t but a long seventeen."

     "I\'m older\'n you was, and it worked out good."

     "Can\'t get a license here. Can\'t do it proper."

     "We kin sign a paper, I reckon, and there\'s Brother Weatherby."

     Everything he said, it seemed to Evans, was made to turn against him. He tried to fight down the anger that grew out of his helplessness. "Just wait\'ll we git to Oregon, and if you feel the same then, we\'ll do it up right."

     "Unless I marry her, she won\'t be goin\' to Oregon, for you said her fambly wasn\'t. Anyhow, I ain\'t willin\' to wait. Neither of us."

     "You been talkin\' to Dick. I seen you go out with him."

     "Don\'t hold it agin him, Pa. It was bound to come."

     "How you know this girl is what you want? Don\'t hardly know her but to pass the time of day."

     "Don\'t say nothin\' bad about her, please, Pa. I just know. She\'s all right, an\' more\'n that. It\'s just you can\'t see her fo her fambly."

     "Cats breeds cats."

     "Please, Pa!"

     "That\'s the way it is."

     "Don\'t say nothin\' to come between me and you!"

     Evans asked what he wouldn\'t have asked if he had had time to think. "You mean it\'s her over me? And over your ma?"

     The answer was a long time coming, but it came solid. "If I got to choose."

     Evans made himself hold silent. Out of the thoughts that ran inside his head, he tried to catch a good one, one good enough to make the boy consider. While he tried, anger died in him, leaving just its ashes. "You owe it to your ma to talk to her, Brownie."

     "I got to see Mercy."

     "Not meanin\' you won\'t talk to Ma?"

     "Not about if I do or don\'t -but I\'ll talk to her."

     "There\'s no changin\' you, I reckon?"

     "I\'m sorry, Pa, and sorrier it riles you."

     "It\'s you I\'m tryin\' to think of."

     "Then don\'t be upset. I\'m doin\' what I want."

     "I can\'t feel you\'re sure of that."

     "I\'m sure."

     "You fixed things up with Weatherby?"

     "Not yet."

     "And got no tent or anything?"

     "We kin sleep out, or under a wagon."

     "Just married and sleep under a wagon!"

     "Well-"

     Evans found himself hurrying to say, "Never mind," knowing by the boy\'s voice that he was mortified and being somehow mortified himself.

     "We\'ll make out somehow."

     "If nothin\'ll hold you, I\'ll trade for a tent."

     "Pa!"

     "You\'re a man now, I reckon, and I ain\'t got the eye to see it, rememberin\' baby days. An\' I\'ll see Weatherby if you\'re still sett come mornin\'."

     Evans turned away, feeling heavy-footed. "Where\'s Rock?"

     "He went off somewheres."

     Thinking back, Evans couldn\'t make up better words than those he\'d said. There wasn\'t a word that would have stopped the wedding, no word or way or reason, unless it was the outright no he couldn\'t bring himself to use. The boy wouldn\'t be drawn back from where his will had taken him. He wouldn\'t corne to call any more than Rock would. Where in tarnation was the dog?

     Evans glanced behind him, half expecting to see Rock loping up, but all he saw between him and the train was the grass running patterns before the wind. He wasn\'t anxious, though, not very, for Rock would show up in course of time. Probably he had come on a bitch in heat, which was about the only thing that would keep him gone so long, from night before to going on to <<noon|13>>.

     Maybe, Evans thought, he should have hunted more, but the morning already was halfway gone, thanks to the wedding, and the company had to roll out miles. And he hated to own up to it, but he had felt a little foolish and exposed, whistling around the fort and by the outside of Indian lodges while Tadlock looked on, smiling wise, as if to say I told you, way back at the start, that dogs would hold you up. It wasn\'t Tadlock that forced him on, though. It was time and time a-passing and last night\'s talk of snow, and he already sore inside at what his boy had done. The dog would turn up. That\'s what he had told Brownie, who wasn\'t so carried off by marriage as to forget about old Rock, and that was what he looked to happen. Rock would just turn up, his mouth open in what went for a grin, his eyes remembering from the night. Meantime the train must move. You couldn\'t ask the folks to keep on waiting just for a misplaced dog, no matter if the dog was Rock.

     Evans slid over in the saddle and cocked the other shoulder to the wind. Except for the weather coming at him, a man wouldn\'t think that hard miles lay ahead. The road looked pretty open, as if swift crossings and rough mountains were just dreamed up in Greenwood\'s head. Three hundred miles to Boise, or something close to that. More by way of Walla Walla, which way they wouldn\'t go since Summers said it wasn\'t needful. Eight hundred miles to the home they hadn\'t seen. Eight hundred to the new life. Giddap, horse.

     Take away the gray sky, take away the wind, and things looked gentle-cattle grazing, horses grazing, a bunch of Indians bound for Hall, their horses dragging poles on which their goods were loaded, green grass growing, tall grass growing, trees fringed along the Snake. But the gray sky was here, and the wind, and they put a man in mind of winter. Winter would be along soon. The smell of it was in the air, like the smell of a thing out of sight, beyond the bend. It made a man feel half like saying enough, half like staying the season out in the grassy Fort Hall bottoms and maybe staying longer. Cattle could be grown here, and horses, and probably crops, though not a spade of earth had been turned; and the Indians would get over being meddlesome and pecky. Just what pushed people on? Evans asked, and didn\'t bother thinking why, for reasons seemed no good today. It was enough to answer that Oregon had put a spell on them.

     It had put a spell on all of them except for Tadlock and Davisworth and Brewer and McBee except for one McBee, and he would try to act like real kinfolks to that one McBee like Rebecca told him to. Rebecca had taken the news quiet, as if she\'d seen it coming, and hadn\'t argued that he knew of, or scolded, or asked Brownie to wait. She had talked with him a long time, while Evans kept himself away, not trusting himself to speak more about it. He had gone to bed finally and had heard their voices a piece off from the tent just as a murmur. Rebecca didn\'t speak when she first came back but undressed quietly and came to bed and by and by put her hand on his shoulder, knowing somehow that he didn\'t sleep. "Maybe it ain\'t the way I might hope, Lije," she whispered so that Brownie wouldn\'t hear.

     "It ain\'t the way I\'d hoped."

     "But still it might turn out to be. You hold yourself in, Lije."

     "I told him if he was sot, all right."

     "I recollect when you was young. Think on it, Lije."

     "I got me a real woman."

     "Might be he has. She\'s a good young\'un. Don\'t judge too quick."

     "Seems like you think it\'s just fine."

     Her hand patted him. "We got to take what comes and make the best of it and not the worst. You be nice to her."

     What chafed him was he knew that she was right. He said, "I\'d just as leave not talk tonight. I\'m tired, and cranky too, I reckon."

     But in the morning -it was just this morning, come to think of it- what worried her was what the girl would wear. Women were queer sometimes, even Becky. It turned out the girl was dressed all right. Had shoes on and a dress with a frilly collar. And she had twisted her hair up in a way that made her face look frail. And pretty. Prettier than ever. There was no denying the girl was pretty.

     Weatherby had done the trick quick, knowing the train must move, but still the knot was likely tight enough -too tight, it might turn out. Weatherby had been pleased at a marrying, maybe because it was the opposite of the funerals he had had to preach, promising life instead of marking the end of it. How did it go? What God hath joined together, let no man put asunder?

     The picture of the wedding stood in Evans\' mind as he hunched into the wind that got inside his clothes and felt around his ribs -the men and women gathered in the Fort Hall yard, so\'s to be in shelter, and a few favorite Indians with them, wondering at the white man\'s medicine, and Brownie standing stiff and the girl indrawn and pale, and Weatherby asking in his preacher\'s voice if one took the other, come hell or heaven, and Ma McBee crying and her eyes red and her nose sharp­standing between, and McBee acting important, as if, \'y God, except for him there wouldn\'t be any such big doings as now.

     It was a friendly train, except for one or two, and good-wishing for the man and wife. Just wait\'ll we get to Oregon, they had promised, and we\'ll have a housewarmin\' as is a housewarmin\'. Mack had even tried to give a yoke of oxen as a wedding present, and Brownie had refused it, acting not polite enough, as if the gift would show he couldn\'t come it by himself.

     So it was done, and there was winter in the air, or the foretaste of it. By the time it came, God willing, he would be in Oregon and have a cabin building. He could imagine himself in it. He was sitting in it, and a fire was burning in the new fireplace, and outside the rain pattered or the snow flurried or the wind whined, and he was safe and snug, planning what to do when the storm let up. There he was, and Becky with him, and Brownie. And Mrs. George Brown Evans, who had been Mercy McBee. You remember the McBees? Hanks of home­spun hung from the walls, and gourds sat on a shelf, holding seeds for the spring planting. There was the smell of roasting meat in the cabin, making Rock look hungry, and the sweetness of cookies, or was it bread a-baking. Right smart house we built, eh, boy? It\'ll do to keep the weather out. \'Member that wind leavin\' Fort Hall? \'Member how chill we was? Makes this time real cozy, eh?

     He sat in the cabin while he rode his horse, and he saw a thing far off, toward the touch of land and sky. A dead buffalo, he thought it was from the size of it, or more likely an elk or a cow or ox, and maybe not dead but only sick or resting. He studied it while his mind sat rocking in the new house on the Willamette. There were some skins on the wall, a bear that Brownie had brought down and a deer hide with the red of the fall woods in it. Come decent weather and we\'ll build you a Cabin, Brownie, and put a floor in this one. Can\'t hardly wait on weather to start all the work that nudges to be done.

     The thing wouldn\'t be as big as a cow, he saw now. Even on a gray day you couldn\'t trust your sight in country where a lark loomed hefty as a hen. Lying on the open flat where the wind would tear at it, the thing seemed lonesome. It made the world seem lonesome.

     The could-be of it pinched him suddenly, and he pulled his horse up, not ready to believe, while his eyes said no and yes. I hey found the legs, the trunk, the head, the white-sprigged hair and put them all together. "Rock!" he said into the wind. Hey, you, Rock!" He heeled his horse into a walk.

  He sat still in the saddle when he had come to him, seeing, and numbed by seeing, the big head knocked in and one eye pushing from its socket and the old muzzle stained by blood. A bug crawled on the mouth, fighting the wind.

     He took the sights in, one by one, but what he saw was Rock, the sprawly pup, Rock back at home and Brownie just a pup himself and the two growing up together, making the place cheerful with barks and cries and playful fracases. What he saw was Rock with age coming on him and wisdom in him and the graying muzzle resting on his knee.

     He climbed down from the saddle and stooped and lifted a paw and knew by the stiffness of the lift that this was not a fresh-done thing.

     Feeling ran far off from him, as if at something old in memory, while his mind worked at the how and why and who. He remembered Tadlock and his smile and looked back toward the fort and saw the ox train winding slow, a mile or so away. But it wasn\'t Tadlock. For all his faults Tadlock was too much a man for this.

     Who, then? He didn\'t need to ask again. He knew as well as a man could know. "Never can tell what\'ll happen." The flicker in the muddy eye. They were McBee\'s way of letting him know, of making sure he wouldn\'t miss the knowing. They were the last laugh. They were the getting even for all the wounds to little pride. And he had taken them for something else, disre­membering that he had warned himself to look out for sneaky tricks.

     He brushed the bug off the mouth, feeling the blood hard and crusted against his knuckles. He closed the fist afterwards and studied it, recalling what it did to Tadlock, and he looked back again and saw the train still winding. He couldn\'t see the fort from so low on the ground, but it would be there, it and Hank McBee. In-law Hank McBee.

     But anger wasn\'t in him yet, but just the far-off sorrow, and he waited for a what-to-do while his mind worked on to put the case together. McBee had thought it safe to do the deed, since he was parting from the train. Maybe he had walked from the fort last night, his mind made up for California, and seen the old dog dozing by his wagon, waiting for Mercy to come back from somewhere, and the scheme had broken on him like a sudden light, and he had used a hammer or an ax heel or a club and had put the dead dog on a horse and packed him out and dumped him down where any eye would see. And then he had ridden back, smiling in his whiskers, thinking likely Evans wouldn\'t turn around, once started with the train, to push a point there at the fort that he had no proof about.

     "Never can tell what\'ll happen"? What did that add up to? McBee was too sly to catch himself on words. It could even be, Evans thought without believing, that McBee was trying to excuse himself this morning, trying to say he\'d\'ve acted different if he\'d known about the marriage at the time.

  So what to do? Go back and fight? Beat the last laugh from the bushy mouth? Revenge old Rock, who\'d been done in through no offense of his? Fight, and let the thing be known? Then what about Brownie and his new-wed wife and the damage possible to them? Brownie wouldn\'t blame her for a deed done by her pa, but still they\'d know the shadow of it, both of them, and feel poor-mated, maybe, if their fathers fought.

     Evans straightened up. The train had crawled closer, and there was just one thing to do. A poor thing but the best. Brownie mustn\'t ever know, or Mercy or even Becky or any­one but him and Hank.

     He brought the horse around between him and the train and picked up Rock\'s stiff body and placed it across the saddle and got on behind, shielding it from any gaze that was sharp enough to see.

     Down toward the river there was a thick patch of woods. He rode to the far side of it and got off and carried the body deep inside and laid it down. "I reckon you understand, Rock?" he said out loud, not caring if the words were foolish. He looked back afterwards and saw Rock didn\'t look quite comfortable and turned around and straightened out a leg.

  Outside the woods the wind was blowing rain.',

            '[ap 01:00] The Way West - A. B. Guthrie Jr_.epub (OEBPS/Text/The Way West - A B Guthrie Jr.html) - one',
            'IT SEEMED to Evans now that one day was like another and that all were bad. They were all work and worry and weariness, and dust and sun and wind and night and sun again and work again. He tried to whistle up the old, bold hope, but it had disappeared. It had ground out under the grind of wheels. It had lost itself in crazy heights and depths. It had thinned away in distance. Trying for it, the eye misted. Listening, the ear filled with the dry complainings of wheels and wagon boxes. Eight miles, fifteen, eight, twenty-three. It didn\'t matter. This sorry land was endless.

     Day on day, dust on dust, pitch and climb and circle while the sand rasped under the worn tires and the rocks clattered and the wounded sage oozed out its smell. Where\'s grass? Where\'s water? Critters gant and hard to keep together over­night. Faces lank and eyes empty, or pointed suddenly, thinking forward to the ford across the Snake. Women cross, and young ones too, and men sharp-worded through their dusted lips, quick with whip and goad on teams too tired to care.

  Violent country. Land of fracture and of fire, boiled up and broken when God first made the world. Range of rattlesnake and jackass rabbit and cactus hot as any hornet. Homeland of the poor and poisonous, and did Oregon really lie beyond? Mountains near and others far, sliding in and out of sight, plaguing people for their brashness. The great gorge of the Snake, the very gut of earth, the churning gut so steep below a horseman couldn\'t ride to it, so far a walker wore out climbing down and back. Eight miles, twenty, twelve. And still it didn\'t matter.

     Evans knew this time would pass. He was right to try for Oregon. He had been all along. It was just that the country overpowered the mind. It was just that a man spent his hope in sweat. It was just that he couldn\'t think ahead for watching out against the here. It was partly that old Rock was dead and the place empty where he would have trotted. And partly it was Brownie\'s marriage, though not so much as once, and the manner of the man and wife, as if they had to take their state dead serious. Why, Evans thought, when he had first hooked on to Becky he was all laugh and prank and couldn\'t always keep his hands off her no matter if they weren\'t alone. No cause to take the thing so solemn even though the dog was gone. This was a time for frolic. For frolic, but for work for all.

     He couldn\'t believe, back there at the fort, that the road would be so hard. For two days afterwards he couldn\'t believe it yet, while the train rolled to the Portneuf crossing and on to American Falls. There were springs above the falls and a river island that gave good grazing to the stock. But already, he remembered, the grassy bottoms of the fort had grown to sandy, sagy plains, and the Snake was scouring deep. The next day and the days that followed showed him what his mind\'s eye couldn\'t see.

     No one day tired the outfit out, and no one thing. Day on day did it, and sand on rock on sage on drought. The sense of getting nowhere did it, the feeling that the train stood still in spite of straining wheels. The stingy treats of green and water, although welcome, served to make the gray miles worse. A man\'s mind turned back to them afterwards, as Evans\' mind had turned back to the Raft. Here the California trail veered left, up a shallow valley toward a ragged peak a million miles away. Here Greenwood and Tadlock and their men would start the journey south. But it wasn\'t the thought of them that kept coming to him later, while grasshoppers clattered off on Justy wings. It was the thought of water and of grass. It was the remembered munching of the stock. It was the fresh wetness on the tongue.

     He put the Raft with the marsh they\'d bedded by one night, when he had heard the tear of grass to hungry mouths, far into dreams. He put it with a campsite that the Snake made, rising from its cut. He put it with Rock Creek and with Salmon Falls. They put a cheerless hunger in him while the sunken­sided teams dragged on to the crossing of the Snake.

     A river out of hell, the Snake, or a river still in hell! A river making hell for burning souls who couldn\'t get down to it. Summers had called him off one day, and they had teetered on the great lip of its gorge and peered below and seen it like a frothy ribbon, so lessened by its depth away that Evans had to tell himself that here was such tormented water as he had never seen. A fair-sized falls and fair-sized water running white, sending up a fair-sized rumble -and what it was was sweep and plunge and thunder like nothing that he quite could believe.

     He had pulled back, dizzy, and the question inside him must have shown, for Dick had said, "We\'ll ford her just the same."

     Evans had asked, "We could go round the loop, like some one said at Hall, and so dodge both the crossings?"

     "Could," Dick said while his eyes answered no. "Just as well drown as starve, though, I\'m thinkin\'. You want to lose your last damn head of stock?" He smiled. "The river calms down some. We\'ll make it, hoss."

     It was hard to think so, though, remembering how they\'d had to bed above. Once they\'d pushed the stock away from camp a mile or more and found a way down to the river more fit for goats than cattle. But here was water and a little grass, and they\'d left the livestock there, just lightly guarded, and had packed back water for the camp. And once, late starting after hunting wandered cows, they had camped entirely dry and found the stock more scattered in the morning.

     That was a thing that bothered a man- the thirst and growing weakness and most of all the hunger of cattle and horses and teams. Driving, a teamster saw the sagging pockets beyond the hipbones of his oxen and the chained knuckles of their backs. When he unyoked, they looked at him softly, their eyes reproachful, as if to ask how he could treat them so. And sometimes under yoke they just lay down, and no goad or whip or fork could get them up again, and a man trying felt more brutish than his brutes. They left them where they lay, with what life remained in them, thinking they had earned the slim chance of a miracle, and sometimes put plunder from the wagons with them-a chest or favorite chair or grinding stone -for every pound now counted. Leaving such, Daugherty had scratched a sign and posted it close by for travelers coming later. It said, "Help yourself." It also said weariness and the sour humor growing out of it. It said help yourself, only you can\'t, you poor devil like me, and so the joke\'s on you.

     Coming on to good campsites, on to grass and easy water, men and women always tried to believe the hardest miles were rolled. For a little while -until they pulled again into the waste of sand and stone- their spirits lifted and their voices rang out full. That was the way of them at Salmon Falls Creek, where everything was plenty, and at Salmon Falls. Though grass and fuel were scanty at the falls, the Indians had fresh salmon and cakes of pounded berries to trade for clothing, powder, knives and fishhooks. Most of all for fishhooks, which Dick had thought to bring aplenty of. Fresh meat tasted good, even salmon, after days of chewing on dried stuff, eaten stiff or mushed up in a pot, though Evans came to feel he\'d just as soon not see a fish again if he could have red meat. And the berry cakes were better yet.

     Seeing the Salmon Falls Indians, Evans knew why Summers spoke so low of the fish-eating tribes. They were friendly and talkative and sometimes funny, but childish-minded and dirty and naked except maybe for a lousy rabbit skin, and they ate anything -lizards and grasshoppers and pursy crickets that would gag a man. They lived in huts of grass and willow that were just half-circles, open to the south. The huts reminded him of swallows\' nests, niched around the way they were, except that birds were better builders.

     The camp had been a good camp anyhow, or not so bad as some, no matter if grass and wood were scarce and the Indians pretty sorry. A change of victuals helped the train, as did the proof that human life of sorts could live in such a country. And the great springs that burst out of the solid north wall of the Snake gave the people something new to talk about. Spring After spring, there was, like sunken rivers pouring out, which Summers called the Chutes.

     More sand came afterwards, more sage, more rocks, more no­grass, more no-water, more worn-out stock, more of the hell of the Snake though they had borne out from it to cut across a bend it made.

     Now when they were about to come to it again, to lower down the bluff and try the ford, Evans told himself that if any train could get to Oregon, this one could. It had the best pilot that he knew of, best man and pilot both. Its stock was poor but no poorer than would come behind. Its wagons were as good as others would be by the time they reached the ford. But it was the men he counted on, the men and women and spirit of the company. They had their faults, he knew. They had their differences and sometimes spoke severe, what with sand in their teeth and worries in their heads, but they wished well for one another and they hung together. Here where sometimes he\'d heard the trains split up, old On-to-Oregon stayed one. Looking down the line from head to tail after the long drop to the Snake came into sight, he felt a kind of wrathy pride. Damn the Snake and all its sorry kin of sage and sand! Damn the crossing! They\'d make it -he and Summers and Patch and Mack and Daugherty and Shields and Gorham and all the rest, clear down to Byrd. They\'d make it or go down trying and still damn the Snake to do its damnedest.

     Once he\'d wondered if they\'d keep him captain. That was when he\'d outfought Tadlock and dared the other men to try to hang the Indian, but nothing came of it except they showed in little ways they didn\'t hold a grievance, maybe knowing without saying that they had been wrong. Only Daugherty had spoken open, saying, "I\'m hopin\' you\'ll forgit it, Captain. It was the divil in us, temptin\' us to mortal sin." He had grinned and added, as if to give warning that he was his own man yet, "An\' let us hope them Injuns quit their thievin\' ways, or else to hell I\'ll maybe travel still."

     They were for him, Evans told himself while he watched Dick coming into sight from below the brow of the bluff. They were for him and he was for them and each was for each other, and they\'d get across the Snake and pull up safe in Oregon.

     Summers rode alongside to say, "We can make it, I\'m think in\', without hold-back ropes or anything. Steep but not to bad."

  "Hold up!" Evans called to Patch, whose two wagons were in the lead ahead of him. He lifted his hand for a stop behind. The rearward wagons closed up slow and came to rest, the oxen dragging to a halt without command and sagging afterwards as if from the little weight of yoke. He said to Summers, "Maybe we better hitch a rope to the first wagon and some of us walk along, just in case."

     Summers gave a nod.

     Evans faced down the line and yelled through his hands, "All out!" though nearly everybody was. The call was relayed to the rear by other voices. He waited, watching, until the last of them was down. The last was Mrs. Byrd, moving heavy with the child in her, and it occurred to Evans, seeing her, that he might as well have let the people sit until their turns came up. He stepped down the line, motioning to the nearest men. "Mack! Fairman! Carpenter!" Brother Weatherby came up with them, gray as a desert grasshopper from marching in the dust to save his horse. "Summers thinks we can drive down all right, but let\'s the bunch of us walk down with the lead wagon and see how it goes. We can stop her if she wants to run."

     They followed him back to the head of the column, where Patch stood with his lead team and Summers waited to show the way. One of them had tied a rope to the rear axle. Mrs. Patch stood back with the second team, quiet as always and as always somehow noticeable. Evans thought while he spoke that you couldn\'t throw off on these two Yankees. They were cool and heady customers. He said, "All right, Dick. You ne\'en to help, Brother Weatherby."

     Weatherby said, "Why not?" as if there wasn\'t any answer, not even his sixty-four years.

  Patch popped his whip and the oxen leaned into the yoke and the wheels turned and the front ones headed down.

     The way was long and steep, but not so steep by Dick\'s meandering that two or three men, depending on the load and team, couldn\'t manage trouble if it came. Patch\'s outfit reached the bottom without real need of help. Still, it seemed wise to send men with each wagon.

     The plan took time and wind but worked out safe. The loose stock came behind, footing careful down the pitch and breaking to a heavy, stumbling run for water. Evans saw, before he went to look across the ford, that grass was scant here too. It added to his maybe-foolish load of worry to think that poor teams would make a poor out at getting through the Snake.

     The crossing didn\'t look so risky, though, being broken by two islands that sat like low rafts in the stream.

     "It\'s far across and swift," he said to Summers and the other men who\'d lined up along the bank, "but it don\'t look so deep."

     "Deeper\'n you\'d think," Summers answered. "Water\'s so clear it makes the bed look close."

     "How deep?" Evans glanced up at Summers, sitting thoughtful on his horse.

  Summers shrugged. "Not too deep. Way to look at it is, it ain\'t easy, but it ain\'t beyond doin\', either. We\'ll make it." Evans tilted his head and saw the white sun veering down.

     "Dick," he said, "there\'s grass aplenty on them islands."

     "Plenty."

     Evans spoke to the others as well as to Summers. "Let\'s push the livestock to \'em and let \'em get their bellies full and then line out in the morning. They\'ll be rested and fed both."

     It was Byrd who answered first, saying, "Amen to that." In his fair, ungrown-up face Evans caught the shadow of alarm, and he wondered, as before, how the man had raised the spunk to start out in the first place. He belonged in town.

     Summers was saying, "Good idee," and the rest were nodding.

    "Let\'s circle up, though maybe there\'s no need of it, and git the work stock over."

     While he and Brownie freed their teams, Evans thought again of Byrd, thought of him with a little of embarrassment, as if Byrd\'s weaknesses rested on him. Like some other unmanly men he\'d known, Byrd must be a clever man in bed, judging by the flock he\'d fathered. It was vexatious to feel responsible for him, and yet he did and more so maybe than with most, remembering the words that Mack had overheard and told him. Back there at Fort Hall Tadlock was working on Byrd, arguing for California. Byrd had answered, "I\'ll stay with Evans and Summers. If any can, those two will see the train through."

     To Evans there was a kind of womanish faith in that answer that, right or wrong, seemed to put an extra burden on him.

     He laid the yoke down and let the team step out and saw his in-law daughter looking at him. "Wore out?" he asked, making himself smile.

     She gave him just the ghost of an answering smile. "I\'m all right."

     Evans was up early. The dark still hung here in the bottom though overhead the sky was lightening. He stopped outside his tent and looked off to the water, seeing it as just a fluid dullness, without the shine of sun or moon or stars. The voice of it came to him, the whishing mutter of its strength. All night he\'d heard it, even through his dreams.

     He shook himself against the chill, against the inward funkiness of early morning, wishing with a sudden impatience that all the camp was up, ready for a try that weighed heavier with waiting. Right now, with the blood flowing weak in him after sleep and the dark cast of dawn lying on his spirit, damn if he wasn\'t as bad as Byrd, empty-chested before a danger built up in the mind. They\'d get across, down to the last setting hen and chick. It was his being head rooster that put the foolish fidgets in him.

     He walked down toward the water, flushing up a ground bird that rustled out of sight. Close up, the river still ran black. lie couldn\'t see the bottom of it. Out in the stream the islands floated like clouds made out at night. The shapeless movement that he saw might be the livestock, getting up to graze.

     They\'d got the stock out there all right and afterwards, after food and coffee, had made light of the crossing, saying shoo, it wasn\'t anything. Critters now and then had had to swim and the current sure enough was swift, but still it wasn\'t anything. And, with grass and rest, the teams would be still stronger.

     They\'d soon see how it was, Evans thought, while there slipped into his mind the way the river reared against the horse he\'d used to drive the loose stock over. The eastward sky was showing red. An hour or so, and they would see. There was just breakfast to get and eat and clean up after, and tents to strike and loads to load and the stock to push back and hitch. Then they\'d see.

  Except for being unloaded, the wagons were ready, or as ready as the place allowed. By Dick\'s advice the men had gone wood hunting yesterday and had found a little, mostly smallish­sized. Evans had thought it next to nothing, not much more than good enough for fires, and had said to Summers, "Them poles wouldn\'t float a cart."

     "Don\'t aim to float the wagons, Lije. Not here."

     "Don\'t?"

     "Tide\'s too stiff. A floatin\' wagon might draw the teams along with it."

     "So what?"

  "What we want is for the wheels to set solid on the bottom. We\'ll lay the wood on top the wagon boxes -that\'ll give us extry weight- and h\'ist the flour and such on top of it, so\'s to keep it dry."

  There wasn\'t wood enough to help out much. Here and there the men had found a small and lonesome tree and here and there a piece of punky drift. They laid their pickings over the wagon beds and, to piece them out and get the spoilables above the waterline, used plows and pack saddles and boxes emptied into others.

     Evans turned away from the river, hearing sounds in camp, and saw Summers riding up. Behind him the arches of the wagons had divided from the dark.

     "Got \'er figgered out, Lije?" Summers asked.

     "Sure. All we have to do is cross and then think about the second crossing."

     "Second ain\'t so bad. Close to Boise, too, where there\'s help if need be." Summers smiled while his eyes studied Evans\' face. "You sleep any?"

     "Sure."

     "Ain\'t no sartain-sure way against accidents, Lije. If\'n one happens, no one\'ll fault you \'less you do yourself."

     "I know that."

    "Know it but can\'t feel it," Summers answered, gazing off beyond the river. "That\'s what makes you a good captain, I reckon, but it\'s hard on the gizzard." His eyes came back to Evans. "I swear, Lije, back in Missouri I never thought to see you playin\' mother hen."

     "Me neither."

     "Best put four yoke, anyhow, to a wagon, an\' up to six to some."

     "That\'ll mean usin\' some teams twicet."

     Summers bobbed his head. "With a long string of critters, enough will have footin\' if others has to swim."

     "I see."

     "An\', Lije, I\'m thinkin\' we need a rider at each side, up­stream and down. Up man could have a hold-rope on the lead ox nearest him."

     "Down man would have a poke, I reckon. Which side is dangerest?"

     "Down, I figger. Yonder there\'s a ripple it would be bad to sag below. Let swimmers do the ridin\', Lije."

     "That\'s a job for me then."

     "You\'re a fish," Summers answered, nodding. "Hig\'s hard to beat, I seen down on the Bear."

     "I\'ll ask him."

     Summers clucked to his horse. "Thought I\'d scout acrost and find out how to go."

     Evans watched the horse take to the river. He saw it splash in, unwilling but helpless under Dick\'s strong hand, and brace against the sweep and feel ahead for footholds while the water Mse. At <<one|9m:1>> place it had to swim, and Dick lifted himself to keep from getting any wetter than he had to. They came out, streaming, on the nearer island.

     Evans faced around and made for camp. There was other work to do while Dick did his.

     The sun was above the hills by the time the train was ready. Evans had put his own wagons first in line, six yoke to the big one, four to the small, thinking it his duty to try the danger first. The other wagons curled behind his, some prepared to go, some waiting for ox teams to come back. People stood by them or perched inside or watched from on the bank, their talk littled by the thought of things to come.

     Sitting his horse by the lead yoke, Evans squirmed around. His eyes met those of Brownie, who sat in the big wagon with Mercy by his side. He rode back toward them and pulled up and said, "I still don\'t like it. Let\'s have a try at her, with me up there, before you young\'uns launch."

     "We argued that out once, Pa," Brownie answered. "Lemme take the first team over. Me and Mercy ain\'t afraid. We got to go over sometime."

     "Later\'s better, after we see."

     "If all was to wait, you\'d have to bring the wagons back to carry \'em across. Three crossings, that\'ud make."

     Evans flicked the end of the bridle reins against his opened palm, weighing one thing against another though he knew the choice was made. Young ones were hard to scare, believing they would live forever. Danger was a tonic to them. Why, right now, this minute ahead of risk, there was a looking­forward in their faces, a keen excitement more fit for new­joined man and wife than the sober manner that he\'d wondered at. His gaze traveled back to the second wagon, where Becky sat, anxious but contained, as if she told herself here was a thing they had to meet.

     "Never won an argument in my life," he said to the couple while he grinned at them. "Keep on Dick\'s tail now."

     He remembered then he had put aside his goad. He rode to the second wagon and picked it from the wheel it slanted against. "Goin\' to make it, Becky," he said. "Goin\' to get to Oregon."

     Her eyes were solemn. "You be careful, Lije. I\'m as scared for you as anybody."

     He raised the goad, saying with it that he would, and reined around.

     They were waiting for him, Hig mounted yon side of the string, the rope from the near leader\'s horns dangling in his hand, and Dick ready to lead away.

     "Reckon we\'re set," he said to Dick and saw that Dick\'s gaze was fixed behind. Turning, he saw Byrd hurrying up. "Evans," Byrd said, "I\'m nervous -about the children."

     "They\'ll be all right."

     "I know, but do you suppose you could take them?"

     "First trip?"

     "Your wagons are better and your teams stronger."

     "You kin use my oxen."

     "I just have the one wagon, too."

     "Makes a big load all right," Evans answered, remembering how Byrd\'s light and flimsy second wagon had gone to pieces on the Green.

     "And I\'m not much of a teamster." Byrd spoke as if he\'d like to think there were other things he was pretty much of. "Don\'t take a teamster. Just takes a setter."

     "Still-"

     "Whyn\'t you wait until we try her out?"

     "I\'d like for the children to go in your wagons," Byrd said simply.

     There it was again, Evans thought, the womanish faith in him, the clinging confidence that made him feel half sheepish but somehow answerable. "Bring \'em up if you\'re bound to," he said.

     There were nine Byrd children, not counting the one un­born. Byrd herded them up. The oldest in the bunch was Jeff, who was maybe twelve and fair and open-faced like his father. He climbed into Brownie\'s wagon and took the toddler that Byrd lifted up. Three others climbed in after him. The rest would wait for Becky\'s wagon.

     "Ready," Evans said.

     "Here we go, hoss," Summers said to Brownie. He kicked his horse and reined around. Brownie hollered at the team.

     The oxen took to the water slowly, staring out across it as if to calculate their chances. Already the current was bucking against Dick\'s horse.

     Here was the deepest part, from shore to nearer island, the deepest but not the swiftest or the riskiest. The water climbed List, up the legs of the leaders, to their bellies, up their bellies, streaming around the little dams that their bodies made. Evans wrenched his horse close, so as to be able to use the poke.

     The lead yoke sank into a hole and lined out, swimming, giving to the current, their chins flattened on the surface. Evans punched at them, shouting, "Gee! Gee!" above the washing of the water. He felt the cold climb up his legs and felt his horse change gait, from jolt to fluid action, and knew that it was swimming. He held it short-reined, angled against the stream, while he worked the goad. Across the swimming backs he saw Hig\'s rope tighten like a fiddle string.

     The leaders caught a foothold and staggered on and drew the next yoke over, and Evans looked behind him and saw the wagon lurching and Brownie grinning wide and Mercy holding the Byrd baby like the mother of it.

     The island neared. In the wide and busy water it was as if the island swam to them. The oxen pulled up on it and drew the wagon after.

     "How\'s that?" Evans yelled to Brownie while the team held up to blow.

     The answer had the tone of spirit in it. "Ought to be hitched to a duck."

     "Watch them wheelers do their part."

     Summers led them across the island and angled upstream, and the water bore on them again and the oxen leaned into it, pitching on the tricky bottom, fighting upward step by step while the wagon balked behind. The second island was close at hand before Dick made a leftward turn and led them out where wheel tracks scarred the banks.

     They stopped again to let the oxen catch their wind. Summers said to Hig and Evans, "Next one\'s hardest, you kin see." He raised his voice to reach to Brownie. "We head well up for two rod or so and then quarter a little down for six or eight and then turn up again for fifteen or twenty. Then point for where the tracks come out. Heavy water, but not so deep as some we\'ve crossed. Watch out for that there ripple. We got to keep above her." The lined face grinned at Brownie. "What skeers me is your pa will git hisself washed off. Can\'t swim no better\'n a salmon."

     Fighting the current, seeing the lunge and sway of the wagon and the oxen half falling in the holes, Evans thought that only mountain men would have called this place a crossing. Only they would have found it and, finding, thought it possible to get a wagon through. This wasn\'t a ford, this wild, deep, uneven-bottomed water. It was an invitation to drown. Let a team be pulled over the muscled ripple to his left, let even a saddle horse pass over! Go it, critters! Again it was as if the solid land swam to them while the current banked against teams and wheels and wagon boxes and boiled off white at front and back. It swam to them, and the oxen lifted to it, and wheels ground in the gravel of the shore.

     "We done it!" Evans yelled across at Hig as the leaders found the bank. "By godalmighty, yes!"

  Hig didn\'t answer. He didn\'t need to. His thin grin answered for him.

     "Dick, we done it!"

     "\'Lowed we would."

     "Fun," Brownie put in from the wagon seat. "Man, it was fun."

     "Take the outfit up a ways, Brownie, and you and Mercy mind the young\'uns. Don\'t want \'em underfoot."

     "Want to take the team back?" Brownie asked.

     "Unhitch and leave \'em rest awhile. We\'ll git some more across, I reckon, before usin\' \'em again."

     Later, with Becky across, and Mack and Shields and Carpenter, Evans told himself the talk last night was right: there wasn\'t anything to it. The crossing had the looks of danger; it sure enough was danger, close-sweeping in the stout and angry tide; but with Dick to lead and him and Hig to ride, there wasn\'t anything to it, not if a man took care. They\'d be across, the whole set of them, by <<noon|13>> or maybe sooner.

     Back on the southern shore Evans changed his blown horse, taking Nellie in its stead. "You ready, Byrd?"

     "Ready."

     "Ain\'t much to do except set, you and your missus."

     "I\'m grateful to you. I felt the children would be safest with you."

       "Wasn\'t nothin\'. Say you\'re ready?"

     Byrd nodded, sober and watchful as a cornered coon. His woman was the same. Summers had said once she put him in mind of a pigeon, but, looking at her now, Evans figured she\'d swelled out to a duck.

     Behind them were more wagons. The Patches weren\'t over yet, or the Daughertys. After the last of them had made the crossing, Insko and Gorham and Holdridge and Botter would push the loose stock over. The herd wasn\'t so big now that Tadlock had quit the train.

  Evans rode to the head of the line. "Good for another trip?" he joked at Hig, who sat like a bent stick on his horse. A knobby skeleton of a man, Hig was, with a face like an old white potato, but he could ride a horse or swim a stream or mend a rifle, and, what was more, he had a think-piece behind that withered skin.

     "Good as gravy," Hig answered.

     "Lead away, Dick."

     They had hitched six yokes to Byrd\'s wagon, for it was medium heavy and the oxen either partly spent or smallish for so hard a chore.

     They took the first stretch fine, barely swimming here and there, for, after all the trips across, the best course had been learnt. Glancing back as the leaders pulled up the bank of the first island, Evans thought Byrd looked like a churchman facing sin, a proper banker-churchman for the first time meeting evil in the flesh.

     The next stretch went fine, too, the critters slanting up the stream and bending left and coming out like other teams before them.

     While the oxen caught their wind, Evans made his horse step back. "Just one more hitch," he said to Byrd. "I honestly believe it looks worse than it is."

     "It ain\'t so bad. Scare you, Mrs. Byrd?"

     She said it didn\'t.

     "Just hang on."

     Evans walked his horse back and nodded at Dick, and Dick led off again.

     It happened suddenly, close to shore. It happened all at once, without warning or good reason, like something bursting into an easy dream. The team was going all right, the wagon rolling safe above the muscled ripple, and then a leader slipped and thrashed for footing, and the hungry current took it and wrenched its mate along.

  They descended on Evans, their legs scrambling the water into spray, the weight of them dragging the second yoke out of line. "Gee!" he hollered out of habit and poked with his stick and beyond the tangle of them saw Hig and the hold-rope taut and Hig\'s horse floundering with the pull on it. "Gee."

  Nellie wouldn\'t hold. She broke before the thrashing push of them, frightened now and unsteady in the tear of water. The line clear back to the wheel yoke skewed to the pull, slanting the wagon below the come-out trail, slanting toward the ripple, slanting off to wicked depths.

  The wagon began to skid, half sailing, half grinding over gravel. It was swinging like the tail of crack-the-whip, dragging the wheelers with it, bending the yokes into an arc that it yanked to a straight line, angled up into the tide. The swing squeezed Nellie toward the lower shore, into swimming water she couldn\'t swim against.

     Too late the leaders found their feet. Every yoke was off the course, some trying to swim, some trying to set themselves, and all of them wild and all being beaten back. The landing place was drawing off.

     Evans heard Hig shouting and Byrd crying out, in words that lost shape in the rush of water. His eye glimpsed people on the shore and Dick moving with his horse. And then the swinging wagon caught on an unseen boulder and the current tore at it and the upstream wheels lifted. Wrenched between the rock and wash, the wagon flopped over on its side.

     For a flash, it seemed to Evans, things happened slow and sharp to see -Byrd grabbing for his woman and missing and she pitching out and he climbing like a squirrel up the side and she floating feathery as a hen tossed into a pond.

     It wasn\'t a pond, this water. It was power and muscle to shame the power and muscle of a man. It was fury. It was the cold fury of the offended land. It rushed at arms and legs and tried to wrench the body over -and ahead of him was just the opened mouth of Mrs. Byrd, the hen\'s beak opened for a final squawk above the dragging feathers.

     The beak went down, but underneath his hand, underneath the rippled water, he saw the blinking blue of cloth. He struck for it and caught a hold and squared around and tried for shore. It wasn\'t far away. It was a hop, skip and jump without an anvil in one hand. It was the stroke of an oar on peaceful water. It was here. It was streaming here, almost where he could reach it, and he never could. He hadn\'t strength enough, or wind. He hadn\'t legs and arms enough to take him over. Beyond, above the waves that lapped his face, he saw the people huddled, watching, and the wagon washed close to the bank and the oxen struggling and one yoke safe on land and Nellie standing near.

     He lost them as a wave washed up. There was the water around him and the near-far shore and the sunshine dazzling to wet eyes and heaviness in arms and legs and strangles in the throat. There was the water and the power of water and the voice of it and over it another voice, over it, "Lije! Lije!"

     The voice of Summers and the person of him, busy with his horse, and his arm swinging and a rope looping out, and his own arm catching for it and missing and catching it lower down.

     Summers pulled him in, easy so as not to break his holds, and slid from his horse and drew Mrs. Byrd farther up the bank. The folks came running, Byrd in the lead, crying, "Ruth! Ruth!"

     "She can\'t be dead," Evans panted at him. "Ain\'t had long enough to drown."

     "Ruth!"

     Dick said, "Easy," and turned Mrs. Byrd over on her stomach and lifted her at the middle to get the water out.

     "You all right, Lije?" It was Becky, scolding him with her eyes for he didn\'t know what.

     "Winded, is all."

     They stood by, mostly quiet, while Summers worked on Mrs. Byrd. "She\'s comin\' round," he said. "I kin feel the life in her." He turned her over, and she opened her eyes, and Byrd leaned down and pulled her dress so it wouldn\'t show her leg.

     "Are you all right, Ruth?"

     She didn\'t answer right away. Her eyes looked big and washed-out, and they traveled from face to face as if to ask what she was doing on the ground with people looking down on her. Of a sudden her eyes filled and her face twisted, and Evans switched his gaze.

     She was all right, though, except for the crying. Directly she got up, helped by Byrd and Weatherby, and let them lead her toward the wagons.

     "She\'d best lay down awhile," Becky said, and followed them to spread a blanket. The women trailed off with her.

     "Poor way you picked to git to Oregon," Summers said to Evans then. His smile said something different.

     "What\'s the loss?"

     "Ain\'t had time to count."

     Hig shook his head, as if still unbelieving. "I don\'t think there\'s a thing except a cracked tongue and some plunder wet."

     "Not a critter?"

     "Don\'t seem reasonable, but that wagon kind of coasted into shore. I hung to the rope and the team done the best it could, and she kind of coasted."

     "What did Byrd do?"

     "Just rode \'er out."

     "I swear! What\'s holdin\' the wagon now?"

     "Team\'s still hitched." Byrd was coming back from the wagons.

     "Anything wrong?" Evans asked as he came into hearing. "No. I think she\'s all right. I forgot to thank you. I just came to thank you."

     "Fergit it! Just happens I can swim."

     "I can\'t forget it, ever. I want you to know that." When Evans couldn\'t think of more to say, Byrd faced around and walked away.

     "Funny nigger," Summers said, watching him. "But still I reckon you got thanks comin\', Lije."

     "Owe some myself." He turned away from the faces fastened on him. Across the river the other wagons waited. "We\'ll camp here. There\'s more outfits to bring across and Byrd\'s wagon to haul out and fix, and the wood we put in the boxes\'ll give us fires. You all think that\'s best?"

     Their heads said they did.

     "And it\'ll give the stock another fill of grass," Summers added. "There\'s more hard goin\' ahead."',

            '[< 12:00] The Way West - A. B. Guthrie Jr_.epub (OEBPS/Text/The Way West - A B Guthrie Jr.html) - toward noon',
            'HERE, from Boise to the Dalles, was the windup of the trail, the finish of the test, the yes or no to Oregon. Here by slow wheel tracks at last was being written the answer to a question raised years ago last spring, raised so long ago a man lost its beginning across the plain-peak, sage-tree, sand­rock field of time. He lost it along with places, people and doings remembered from before, so that none of them came real to him and he asked himself if sure enough there was an Independence, a Missouri and a spot he once called home, or were they vapors in his mind.

     Asking, he would ask if there was a Dalles, an Oregon, a Columbia that, unseeing, he still had seen, streaming richly to the sea. Was anything behind him or before, anything but rolls of land, anything in all his life but distance to be covered so more distance could be covered? All he could swear to was this walking by his team.

     And yet the days of hardest doubt were gone. The days of any doubt were gone. Evans didn\'t need to tell himself that it was so. The truth of it was big in him. It filled his head and toned his muscles and gave cheer to his words. Not since boyhood had he felt this way, not since his home town of St. Charles had set itself for an illumination. He could hardly wait then, seeing in advance the great fires in the street, answering already to the pitch of celebration.

     He had to hold himself in. He had to keep from pushing, from asking of the teams and people more than they could give. He had to keep in mind that he was born with strength that others didn\'t have. Soon enough, if not soon enough for him, they\'d reach the rimming hills and see the broad Columbia below. While he drove and double-yoked and watched the weak ones over, he saw it in imagination, rolling with the sun, and a shout swelled in his throat, to be choked down to easy, easy. Easy to the promised land.

     He counted each day\'s going against the miles ahead. The Malheur. Birch Creek. The leaving of the Snake, and no one sorry that it lay behind. Burnt River. The Powder. The rough ridge road he followed now to get to the Grande Ronde.

     Burnt River. There was a place. Burnt River -the Brule, as Summers called it- so shouldered in by mountains, so thick with brush and briers, that no one would have dared it, maybe, except for knowing someone had.

     Two days of it. Two days of such hard travel that man and brute arrived at camp with no wish but to rest. Unyoked, the oxen dragged off, waiting on the strength to feed. Men worked slow-motioned, tiredness pulling at their muscles as they pitched their tents and struck their fires and did the little chores while they waited for the food that droopy women fixed. The children quarreled, worn down to orneriness. Their whiny voices filled the air.

     But still the days of doubt were gone. Still Evans felt the climb of celebration. They\'d whipped the trail. They\'d whipped it all but for a few mean miles, whipped the Platte and Green and Snake, whipped the deserts and the mountains, and they would whip the rest.

     Sometimes he thought of cost, of Martin dead and Tod Fairman buried with his poisoned leg and Mrs. Byrd delivered of the too-soon child and old Rock rotting who used to trot at heel. He thought of other costs, of his fight with Tadlock, of oxen down and left to die, of losses from the Indians, of strength spent and juices sweated and courage whittled to a nub. Each reach of trail had taken toll -Platte, Sweetwater, Green, Bear, Snake. And yet -and yet- the thing was worth the cost. No prize came easy. Free land still had its price. A chance at better living had somehow to be earned. A nation couldn\'t grow unless somebody dared. The price was high, but who would say it was too high -except for those who\'d paid so dear?

     Byrd might think it, though without much right. None could mourn deep at a stillborn child, seen but for a moment and as a stranger then, with no life in it to leave a memory. But Byrd might think it, being beaten down. Byrd, born timid and out of luck to boot.

     It would have to be his wagon, Evans thought, that wrecked along the Brule, his one-remaining wagon that broke a wheel the second day.

     The first day had been bad enough, on a narrow, crooked, stony trail that crossed the river only to cross back, that pushed through stubborn thickets, that crept sidelong on ridges shooting into mountains. They\'d made twelve miles or more that day and pitched their camp and fallen into bed, each hoping that the worst was past.

     It wasn\'t, though. The worst was still ahead. Evans, in the lead, had stopped his team where the trail wormed through a tangle of cottonwood, alder, brush and briers. Beyond, the mountains squeezed the stream. He wiped his forehead with his sleeve. "I swear, Dick!"

     "Don\'t look possible," Summers said from his horse, meaning that it was.

     "Ain\'t room, hardly, for a pony cart to go through here. Bush looks liable to wipe off the wagon tops."

     Summers nodded. "Others has been through."

     "A teamster\'s got to get aboard, for there\'s no room for him by the side. Wisht whoever cut the trail had cut a road and not a mole run long as they were doin\' it."

     Summers was silent, looking beyond to the high, straight­rising mountains.

     "And when we get through, we got them tarnal hills. Be more broke wagon tongues today, or I\'m a nigger."

     "Want to turn back?" Summers\' mouth had twisted to a grin.

     "Not yet a while, I reckon."

     Behind Evans the other wagons were beginning to pull up. "This ain\'t makin\' hay," he said to Summers and climbed up to his seat and spoke to his team while Summers led off.

     It was, Evans thought, like pushing a hole through the growth. Branches laced over the team and parted to the bulge of the wagon and ripped along the covered bows while the wheels jolted on the stumps. All he could see was the oxen stumbling and the thin trail and the brush coming at him and squeezing to the sides like water to the bow of a boat. The sound of it along the wagon top was like hard-driven rain.

     Beyond, the trail led down a wash and up the other side and lifted from the river bottom to teeter along the shoulder of a mountain.

     Up from the wash Evans stopped again. They called this slanted scar ahead a trail! The wagon wasn\'t built that wouldn\'t lose its balance on it and fall over on its side. While he looked at it, Summers turned his horse around. "What you thinkin\', hoss?"

     "I ain\'t thinkin\'. I\'m just seein\' wagons keel over."

     "She\'s sidelong, sure enough."

     "Wisht I had a wagon high-wheeled on the down side."

     "An\' sidehill critters, too, built to stand even on a slant."

     "I\'ll pull forward a ways to where she starts so\'s to give the other wagons room behind, and then we\'ll take \'em over one or two at a time, with two-three men standin\' on the up side. Reckon that\'ll work?"

     Summers said, "Sure. Must\'ve worked afore or the trail wouldn\'t be there."

     Evans poked his team and stopped again and waited for the others to come out of the brush. He walked down the line then, telling how they\'d try the slant. "Best all get out when your time comes. Don\'t want a woman or a young\'un in a wagon that tips over. We\'ll try mine first, and if it works then we\'ll take two or maybe three at once. All right? Carpenter? Gorham? You feel like helpin\'?"

  They stepped up, their faces lined already from the morning\'s drive, their eyes narrowed on the trail against the hard glint of the sun.

     Evans said, "Whyn\'t you whack the team, Carpenter? I\'m heftier\'n you. Watch you stay ahead of the wagon. Don\'t want no one mashed."

     They got it over. They roosted on the side and got it over, though the up wheels tried to lift once and barely skimmed the ground.

     "Good enough," Evans said. "We\'ll know better how to go next time. You take the team on a ways, Carpenter, and tie it up somewheres, and we\'ll go back for more." Already he saw another wagon starting, with Patch walking by the side.

     It was slow and sweaty work, made the worse because ahead, where Evans had hoped to see the bottom widen, it still ran pinched. It was just a stream-cut through the mountains, a stream-cut choked by brush. Beyond the little resting place they brought the wagons to, the trail squirmed out of sight.

     Tramping back with Dick and Gorham to bring more outfits over, Evans wished that hard times, if they had to come, came early in the morning when men and teams were lively. Along <<toward noon|13>> the spirits started down and so made heavy travel heavier. Not that he felt whipped. Not that. Leave it to him and they\'d roll longer than they ever thought. The Columbia was just beyond the Blues, or leastwise not so far.

     The air stirred lazily, and he took off his hat to get the good of it. "How much more of this kind of goin\' would you say, Dick?"

     "Ought to be over the worst of it by night, barrin\' trouble."

     "Hope so," Gorham said. He tilted his head upward. "Ain\'t it time to eat?"

     Some of the women and children were following behind a wagon that Daugherty drove, making a ragged line against the mountain slope. Evans and the two with him stepped out of the trail to let Daugherty go by. Daugherty had covered the worst of the slant. He spit over the wheel of his wagon. "And \'tis said the road to hell is steep!"

     Rebecca was among the women, along with Judith Fairman and Mercy and Mrs. Gorham. "We\'ll <<noon|13>> up when we get \'em over," Evans told them. The thought came to him and slid away that Becky was the natural leader of the women. It was as if she had strength enough for all, a quiet, long-enduring strength. Without it, he didn\'t know what Judith Fairman would have done. "Tuckered?" he asked, just to be saying something to her.

     Two of the young ones -Jeff Byrd and George Carpenter, it was- had stopped to tug a rock on edge. "Look out!" they shouted and gave it a turn. It started slow, as if half minded to lie down, and picked up speed and flew thudding down the mountainside and tore into the brush, flushing a flock of ducks off the hidden river.

     "Don\'t you wish you had time to roll a rock, Lije?" Summers asked as the three of them started on. "I knowed you when you did."

     "Reckon I do."

     The little smile went from Summers\' face, leaving just the mark of thought. "No time to roll a rock," he said as if speaking to himself.

     Evans wasn\'t of a mind then to pry into what Dick meant. "Not till we git the rest across," he said.

  Byrd was waiting for them. He stood faced up to the trail. It occurred to Evans that age had come on him, age without age\'s gumption, giving him the appearance of an old boy. "It ain\'t nothing\'," Evans said to Mrs. Byrd, who had sat down to catch the shade a scrubby cedar made. She looked well enough, sitting there quiet with two of her children by her. She looked as she had at first, a milk-mild pigeon to the eye that hadn\'t seen beneath. "We\'ll put enough men on her so she can\'t tip over. How about it, Dick? You and Gorham and me?" They climbed up. "Push \'em across, Byrd."

  Things would have gone well enough if the outfit had been sound. The team eased onto the sidelong trail, pulling slow but steady, and the wagon canted to the slope and the three of them held it down. They were maybe halfway across when the downhill front wheel hit a rock. From his place on the wagon Evans couldn\'t see it, but he felt the jolt and heard the splinter of overweighted spokes. The wagon dropped like a cow on one knee and hung for an instant and lifted and crashed over.

  Perched on the upper side, holding to the wagon box underneath its cover. Evans couldn\'t think to jump until too late. He circled over with the wagon and cracked against a bow and skidded off and hit the ground sprawled out. He scrambled up. "Dick?"

     Gorham had gone over, too. He got his knees under him and stood up. "Goddam it!" he said.

  "You hurt?"

     "No, goddam itl"

     Dick was coming around the wagon. "All right? Whyn\'t you hosses jump?"

     Evans said, "Sure."

     "Christ, what a mix-up!" It was Gorham, looking over the wagon.

     Evans hadn\'t thought of Byrd till then. Byrd stood silent by his halted team as if, of all the words, there wasn\'t one to say. He stood with a look of raw defeat that sharpened Evans\' irritation. "Looks like trouble can\'t leave you alone, Byrd. Poor wagons you bought."

     "I\'m sorry."

     The man was sorry. The unfit, pitiful damn man was sorry. Standing there with his wrecked wagon, with the wheel collapsed and the bows caved in and things messed up inside, what he was was sorry.

     Of a sudden Evans was, too. "Never mind," he said. "We\'ll get it fixed up."

     Mrs. Byrd was hurrying along the sidehill, carrying her youngest one. "Are you all right, Clarence? You\'re not hurt?"

     From the other side people were coming up, children running first and then the men and then Becky and Mrs. Gorham. They gathered round.

     Mrs. Byrd put the child down. Now that she\'d asked if Byrd was all right, it was as if she didn\'t know words, either.

     To all of them Evans said, "Let\'s git the pots a-b\'ilin\'. Time to <<noon|13>>." He bobbed his head to Becky\'s silent question about himself. "Let\'s git goin\'. You, too, Mrs. Byrd. Would one of you unhitch Byrd\'s team, and some help unload the wagon?"

     When they had it unloaded, he sent them on, staying himself to talk to Byrd a minute. "Didn\'t mean to sound like scoldin\' you," he said. "I was just put out."

     "You don\'t need to say anything."

     "We\'ll git a saw."

     "Saw?"

     "To make a cart with. We\'ll saw your wagon in two."

     "Oh."

     "Other wagons has got room if you need some. Room for part of your plunder and your young\'uns."

     Byrd didn\'t answer. His eyes turned from the wagon to the brush of the creek below, to the loose stock that were beginning to foot it across the sidehill, to the mountains rising, to the far curve of sky.

     "So you ain\'t in such bad case. Hig\'ll know how to make a first-rate cart."

     Byrd\'s gaze was still lost in distance. "It\'s a long way back."

     "Sure is. We got time to do some sawin\' before we eat."',

            '[12:00] The Way West - A. B. Guthrie Jr_.epub (OEBPS/Text/The Way West - A B Guthrie Jr.html) - noon',
            'Mountains walled on either side, mountains hanging over, mountains bare and mountains treed, their rims high-dizzy in the blue of sky. The broad-beamed river, salted from the touch of ocean, barely flowing in between. Waterfalls along the southern wall like frills of snowy ribbon. Moisture in the air, the damp outbreath of sea.

     Time running slowly with the slow-borne boats. Shadowed morning, glinty <<noon|13>>, shadowed afternoon. Nights broody with the feel of mountains, broody with the sense of loss, the campfire sparking small against the greatness of the dark. Rice. Bread. More fish. Sleep. The lap of water on the narrow shore.

     And wind. Wind out of the west, sea wind, fighting oar and current. Wind that guarded Oregon. The Cape Horn wind that drove the boats to shore. Wind that changed its mind, that eased or turned and bellied out the sails and streamed the lines of bank behind.

     A fort bateau, up-bound to the falls for passengers. Hello and goodbye, and we\'re all right and how far yet to go? Emptiness afterwards, a greater loneliness, the loneliness of water, wind and mountains, of all the might of earth against three flimsy boats.

     The touch of lostness, the touch of sorrow, the inward asking if gentler shores would come, the thought of Dick, called backward by some whisper in his mind.

  But, under all, the waiting flush, the singing of the blood when hills would roll away, and real and fair to sight would come the hard-held dream. This time was short. These wind and mountain troubles were the last. Around the turn! Beyond the quiet stretch!

     Hardships, sorrows, partings? But the heart still ready to beat high? Without troubles, Evans thought, rejoicing would be a puny thing, with no roots in the soil of life. How much would he prize Brownie if he hadn\'t lost another child? How much would he like Oregon except for sweat and grief along the way? Grief bowed the heart but made it richer, so that joy was rich. Some night on the banks of the Willamette he\'d hear Rock\'s throaty growl and would like Oregon the more. Some night he\'d see Tod Fairman and his swollen leg. Sometime he\'d bend again and find in pigeon eyes the kinship to himself. In some remembering silence he\'d hear Dick Summers say, "Take it easy, hoss!"

  He held tight as the mountains fell away. He said not yet, not yet, while in his gaze a softer country swam. Not yet, not yet, and then ahead, beyond a grass-green prairie, mellow in the sun, the lines of Fort Vancouver with a great ship standing by! Across from it, unseen in the wooded flow of land, the waters of Willamette!

     Once, long ago, he had come to the Platte and felt greatness. He had reached the Columbia and shuddered to the flowering hope. And now he looked on home. A tide rose in him, so fierce, so bursting in the breast, so close to women\'s tears, that he feared to meet the others\' eyes. Yonder it was, yonder was home, yonder the rich soil waiting for the plow, waiting for the work of hands, for the happy cries of children. They\'d made it. They had rolled the miles. And back of them came others. Crossers of plains. Grinders through the dust. Climbers of mountains. Forders of rivers. Meeters of dangers. Sailors at last of the big waters. Nation makers. Builders of the country.

  He let himself look around and saw the Byrds\' and Fairmans\' boats lapping close behind and, on his own, Brownie idle with his sweep and Becky with the home-gleam in her eye and Mercy sitting by her. Mercy who, Rebecca said, was going to have a child. Sweet Mercy who would bring a baby to the house. Blood of his blood, Evans thought. Blood of his blood once removed.

     He winked at his woman and spoke loud above the tremble in his throat. "Becky," he said, "hurrah for Oregon!"',
