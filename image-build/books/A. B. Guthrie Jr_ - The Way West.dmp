A steady, quiet old dog, Rock was, who carried himself wise and dignified. Farther back of them, maybe a mile down the gradual slope they had climbed, he could see the wagon train winding, the gray-white train squirming in its haze of dust. The time was coming on <<toward noon|13>> and the train had straggled out. Behind the wagons came the loose horses and behind the horses the cattle, with riders back of them and to the sides, keeping them in line and pushing them along. Out from the wagon, to the windward side so as to be out of the dust, women and children were walking, walking and probably laughing and chattering and looking for wild flowers tough enough to grow on this dry ridge between the Little Blue and the Platte. It was cactus they\'d find, and thistle and low sage standing silverish in the sun. The only flowers they were likely to see were the little yellow-hearted daisies that could sprout from a stone -daisies and now and then one of the wild roses that were just beginning to bloom.',

Inside the corral where he stood some of the other men were beginning to get busy with oxen just driven in, and outside it others were pulling tent pegs and lowering poles and folding the tents afterwards and then lifting their plunder into the wagons. They worked fast, grunting to their chores as men did with sleep still in them and the muscles stiff from the night. The women had scraped and scoured the breakfast things and stood inside the wagons, helping arrange the loads. Or they had wandered off, some with their young ones in tow, to empty themselves and so be ready for the morning drive.',

And this was just the easier part of it! Behind them the sun fired up, making distance dance ahead. There never was such a day in his remembering, Summers thought as <<noon|13>> scorched close, none so hot or breathless, none that made a reach of miles appear so far.
