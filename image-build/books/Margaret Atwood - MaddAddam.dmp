It was mid-July, did I say that? Sun hardly sets at all then, up there. Just sort of dips below the horizon, makes a pretty red rim. Then in a few hours up it comes again. That place isn\x{2019}t above the Arctic Circle, but it\x{2019}s up so high it\x{2019}s tundra: two-hundred-year-old willows like horizontal vines, and the wildflowers all bloom at once because the summer\x{2019}s only a couple of weeks long.

They were waiting for something to begin eating him so they could pitch in and grab a snack: not so deft at making the first incisions, ravens, they always hunted with hunters. He ate a Joltbar, he came to a stream with a washed-out bridge, he had to choose: wet boots or crippled bare feet? He chose the boots, removing his socks first.
