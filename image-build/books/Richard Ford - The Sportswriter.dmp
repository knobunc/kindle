            "I didn\x{2019}t exactly know I\x{2019}d stopped writing. For a good while I\x{2019}d gone to my office every day at <<eight|9c:1>>, come downstairs at lunch and lounged around the house reading research books about Morocco, \x{201c}doping out a few structural problems,\x{201d} making graphs and plot-flow outlines and character histories. But the fact was, I was washed up. Sometimes I would go upstairs, sit down, and not have any idea of what I was there for, or what it was I meant to write about, and had simply forgotten everything. My mind would wander to sailing on Lake Superior (something I had never done), and after that I would go back downstairs and take a nap. And as if I needed proof I was washed up, when the managing editor at the magazine I now work for called me and asked if I had any interest in going to work writing sports full-time\x{2014}his magazine, he said, had a nose for good writing of the type he\x{2019}d seen in my article about the Texas millionaire-convict-Samaritan\x{2014}I was more than interested. He said he\x{2019}d seen something complex yet hard-nosed in that piece of writing, in particular the way I didn\x{2019}t try to make the old center fielder either a villain or a hero to the world, and he had a suspicion I might have just the right temperament and eye for detail to do their kind of work, though he said I might just as well think the entire call was a joke. I took the train up the very next morning and had a long talk with the man who had called me, a fat, blue-eyed Chicagoan named Art Fox, and his young assistants, in the old oak-chaired offices the magazine then occupied on Madison and 45th. Art Fox told me that if you\x{2019}re a man in this country you probably already know enough to be a good sportswriter. More than anything, he said, what you needed was a willingness to watch something very similar over and over again, then be able to write about it in two days\x{2019} time, plus an appreciation of the fact that you\x{2019}re always writing about people who wanted to be doing what they\x{2019}re doing or they wouldn\x{2019}t be doing it, which was the only urgency sportswriting could summon, but also the key to overcoming the irrelevancy of sports itself. After lunch, he took me out into the big room full of old-fashioned cubicles which still had typewriters and wooden desks, and introduced me around. I shook everyone\x{2019}s hand and heard them out about what was on their minds (no one mentioned anything about my book of stories), and at <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>> I went home in brimming spirits. That night I took X out to a high-priced dinner with champagne at the Golden Pheasant, hauled her off on a romantic moonlight walk up the towpath in a direction we\x{2019}d never gone, told her all about what I had in mind, what I thought we could practically hope to get from this kind of commitment (I thought plenty), and she simply said she thought it all sounded just fine.

There\x{2019}s nothing for me here. My only hope would be to make trouble, extenuate circumstances for everybody, do some shouting and break a lamp.

            "Of course, I have no earthly idea where I\x{2019}m bound or what to do once I get there. Fast getaways from sinister forces are sometimes essential, though what follows can mean puzzlement. I haven\x{2019}t ridden the night train to New York, I\x{2019}m sure, since X and I rode up to see Porgy and Bess one winter night when it snowed. How long ago\x{2014}five years? <<Eight|9k:0>>? The specific past has a way of blending, an occurrence I don\x{2019}t particularly mind. And tonight the prospect of detraining in Gotham seems less spooky than usual. It seems a more local-feeling place with a sweet air of the illicit, like a woman you barely know and barely want, but who lets you anyway. Things change. We have that to look forward to. In fact, climbing down tonight onto the streets of any of these little crypto-homey Jersey burgs could heave me into a panic worse than New York ever has.",

I had to give up or make a big decision. I finally won matches at the higher weight, but I was never as good. I never was prideful again either.

            "I head toward my own cubicle, but stop and stick my head in the crowded conference room. Inside, sits a long Formica table littered with yellow hamburger bags and ashtrays and paper coffee cups, thick green ring-bound notebooks, a green computer screen showing a list of names drawn up. A white grease-pencil board is leaned against the wall. The entire football staff with a few of the younger boys on the low end of the masthead are staring in eagle-eyed attention through a layer of smoke at a big video machine showing a football play on a wide imitation-grass field. This is the skull session where our experts decide the first forty college players to be picked by the pros and in what order. After the World Series Roundup it is the most important issue of the year. As a young staffer, I sat in on these very sessions, chewed a cold cigar, shouted my favorites the way these boys are going at it (there\x{2019}s one female at the back I\x{2019}m vaguely familiar with) and it became a damned valuable experience. Younger writers, researchers and interns out of Yale and Bowdoin get to see how these old heads do their stuff, how things really go on. The older writers would normally just settle this kind of thing over drinks at a sushi place around the corner. But for the Preview\x{2014}and to their credit\x{2014}they bring all the machinery out in the open and run the show as though it were really democratic. Later they\x{2019}ll all wind up strolling into the early morning streets, feeling good about themselves and football and the world in general, laughing and swearing, and having a round or two at some spudbuster bar over on Third Avenue. Sometimes they\x{2019}ll all stay out till dawn, and by <<nine|9w>> can be seen around the coffee machine, or floating back to their desks with bushed-but-satisfied looks, ready to put the whole business into print.",

I could call Vicki at her parents\x{2019}. I could call my mother-in-law in Mission Viejo, where it\x{2019}s only a <<quarter till eight|10>>, with the sun barely behind Catalina on an Easter ocean. I could call Clarice Wallagher, since it\x{2019}s possible she\x{2019}s up late most nights, wondering what\x{2019}s happened to her life. All of these people would talk to me, I know for a fact.
