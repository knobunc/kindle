            "13 June 1964. At <<13:35|2>>, a man who identified himself as Mr. Edmond Jouvet came to the office to offer \x{201c}assistance\x{201d} in the matter and was referred to PC Miller, who requested my attendance as well. Mr. Jouvet, a solicitor at Withins, Wessing, & Overton, was in a state of considerable agitation. His breath smelled strongly of whiskey (noted by PC Miller as well as myself). He insisted he knew why George Skinner had been killed and proceeded to impart a bizarre and disconnected story of exchanged children during the Occupation years and resentments arising therefrom.",

Add to that his heavy, world-weary face and his <<five-o\x{2019}clock|6>> shadow (which was there in the morning an hour after he\x{2019}d finished shaving), and he did, indeed, look like a cynical, seen-it-all cop. Bayley, on the other hand, had to shave only every other day and was dressed in a light, trim-fitting linen suit and pale-blue shirt that was buttoned up to the top to accommodate his neatly knotted, perfectly dimpled <<midnight|13>>-blue tie.",

Efforts were made to calm him, to little avail, and at one point Mrs. Carlisle physically prevented Mrs. Skinner from wresting him from her. When Roddy, who was sitting on the floor in a corner, playing with a toy construction set, began to taunt George, Howard Carlisle suddenly stood up and said, and I quote him exactly: \x{201c}This isn\x{2019}t going to work, is it?\x{201d}",
