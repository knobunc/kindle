            "Aside from the water damage, the most nettlesome problem was dating the manuscript. Internal evidence makes it quite clear that The West End Horror begins March 1, 1895. Ascertaining the date of its composition, however, is another matter. It was evident (to me, anyhow) that it was composed a lot later than 1895. Not only does Watson refer to intervals of years between efforts on his part to get Holmes\x{2019}s permission for the project, he also points out that among considerations pro permission were the deaths of many of the principals concerned with the case. Inasmuch as these names are not changed (impossible to disguise really, as Holmes points out), the dates are fairly easily determined. They hint at a relatively late date of composition, certainly <<after 1905|18:0>>. The fact, however, that the manuscript is in Watson\x{2019}s own hand, indicates with equal clarity that he was not yet crippled by arthritis. Beyond that, it is difficult to say. My own hunch\x{2014}and it is only a hunch\x{2014}is that The West End Horror was set down sometime after the First World War and before Holmes\x{2019}s death, in 1929. One of the things that makes me pick so late a period is that Watson\x{2014}as in The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (but not so much)\x{2014}continues to describe things that obviously aren\x{2019}t there any more. That Watson never sought to recover the manuscript after Holmes\x{2019}s death suggests to me that his own ailments had begun to overtake him (possibly the onslaught of crippling arthritis, which plagued his last decade)\x{2014}another argument for the latish dating.",
