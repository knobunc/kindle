Poor Bessie was forgotten: she could hardly get to the piano: Lucy and Pierre were always there, as she worked to catch the notes between notes he found so significant he could make them include the whole universe. Edwin was on the last chapter of a novel: a time he found particularly tense. There was to be piano-playing only between <<two|90>> and <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> of an afternoon. He said so with some force. The house trembled. People wept.",

In the mornings, thus freed from practice, Lucy and Pierre had walked in the woods, and talked about music, and presently love, and then more than talked, and Pierre had explained to Lucy how unhappy she was, and how her way of life stifled her, and how he could not be a great artist without her, and Bessie had seen them in the woods and Lucy had forged one of Edwin\x{2019}s cheques and paid both their passages over; and left Edwin a note and was gone; taking her jewellery because Pierre said she must, and the way not to think about any of it was to be in bed with Pierre. They had scarcely left the cabin on the way over: they had been the talk of the ship and she hadn\x{2019}t cared. To fly in the face of all things respectable intensified the pleasure she had with Pierre: what was forbidden was sweet: she hoped they would never reach Paris, where everyone felt as she and Pierre did, but of course that was silly of her: what was forbidden could not be kept up for long and in any case had to be sandwiched between the permitted in order to count\x{2014}why had there been no one to stop her? If you were a child wasn\x{2019}t that what happened? That someone stopped you? She\x{2019}d relied on Edwin for that all her grown life, but since she couldn\x{2019}t tell him about Pierre how could he have helped her? But she blamed him because he hadn\x{2019}t, because he\x{2019}d been so busy with his book he hadn\x{2019}t even noticed the time she was spending with Pierre: it was Edwin\x{2019}s fault she had left.",
