St. Stephen\x{2019}s, in Montpelier Place, looked convenient; indeed, Miss Lyle, his landlady, had recommended it. But was it a fashionable church? She had not been very clear on that point. St. Peter\x{2019}s, the parish church, at the top of the Grand Parade, was better known, she thought, and St. Bartholomew\x{2019}s in Ann Street was certainly the biggest, even if the building was not to everyone\x{2019}s taste, but both of those were a long way to walk, and most of it uphill. St. Stephen\x{2019}s, after all, was just round the corner.",

Orders were issued for AN EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH FOR A SHARP-BLADED INSTRUMENT among the stalls and barrows which comprise the market.

Unless you\x{2019}ve decided to make a confession. But, as I said, I didn\x{2019}t bring a man with me, or the handcuffs, and it\x{2019}s devilish hard to hear anything anyone says on those confounded trains.

            "Instead he took a rapid turn round the perimeter, learned from notices that the sun\x{2019}s rays would be concentrated on the touch-hole of the pier cannon at <<noon|13>> and that the Diver would descend at <<3.30 p.m.|2a>>, and then started back along the east side, from which he had come. The deck was divided by a wood and glass weather-screen, admirable protection against unexpected gusts, but a barrier to movement between the sides. The prospect of Hove and Cliftonville from the pier-head interested him less than Brighton and Kemp Town, so it was logical to return by the same side.",

There were none of the obstructions one encountered from other viewpoints. The stone groynes hid nothing from this height and the bathing-machines were like rows of match-boxes. The sunshine and the approach of <<noon|13>> had brought numbers of visitors on to the beach. The pebbles, as brown as the Gobi when you saw them en masse, were studded with the brilliant colours of shawls and parasols. There must have been four or five hundred people within view. He flushed with exhilaration.',

            'A murmur of pleasure escaped him at the quality of image the Zeiss produced. Every detail of a distant excursion-yacht was defined with diamond sharpness. Unhappily, though, the water nearer the shore where the waves were breaking was hidden from view by the steep bank of shingle. The bathers were invisible unless they ventured beyond the shallows. He put down the glasses and trusted natural vision to give him the first sighting of whoever came to claim the towel. On the beach, scores of small groups basked in the <<noon|13>> sun, read novels or studied the horizon, oblivious of the vigil being kept from behind.',

Then there was no difficulty in identifying the bather as a youth of fourteen or fifteen. He put down the glasses. He was not looking for a boy. No connection was conceivable between a lad of that age and a married  woman of thirty. His eyes travelled back across the stones to the line that divided land and water.',
