            "I was awakened early by one of the guildsmen I had met the previous day. His name was Future Denton. He waited while I dressed myself in my new apprentice\x{2019}s uniform, and then led me out of the cr\x{e8}che. We did not take the same route as that along which Bruch had led me the day before, but climbed a series of stairs. The city was quiet. Passing a clock I saw that the time was still very early indeed, <<just after three-thirty in the morning|5>>. The corridors were empty of people, and most of the ceiling lights were dimmed.",

            'Suddenly, the doors began to close of their own accord, and I hurried inside. Before I could find any way of controlling the elevator, it began to move upwards. I saw a row of keyed buttons placed on the wall near the door, numbered from <<one|20b>> to <<seven|20a>>. I jabbed my key into number four, hoping that this was the right one. The elevator-car seemed to be moving for a long time, but then it halted abruptly. The doors opened and I stepped forward. As I came out into the passageway, three more guildsmen stepped into the car.',

            "There was no segregation of the sexes in the cr\x{e8}che, and in each room I peered into I searched for a sight of Victoria; she did not appear to be there. When I had checked all the classrooms I went down to the general area: the dining-hall (here there was background noise of the <<midday|13>> meal being prepared), the gymnasium (empty), and the tiny open space, which gave access only to the blue sky above. I went to the common-room, that one place in the whole extent of the cr\x{e8}che which could be used for general recreation. Here there were several boys, some of whom I had been working with only a few days before. They were talking idly\x{2014}as was usual when left alone for the purposes of private study\x{2014}but as soon as they noticed me I became the centre of attention. It was the situation I had just now resisted.",

            "First, all the contents were moved out, and placed in a large pile to one side. Then the buildings themselves were dismantled; not as difficult a task as I\x{2019}d imagined, as they had evidently been designed to be taken down and put up again easily. Each of the walls was joined to the next by a series of bolts. The floors broke down into a series of flat wooden slats, and the roofs were similarly bolted into place. Fittings such as doors and windows were part of the frames in which they sat. It took only an hour to demolish each cabin, and by <<midday|13>> everything was done. Well before then Malchuskin had gone off by himself, returning half an hour later in a battery-powered truck. We took a short break and ate a meal, then loaded the truck with as much of the material as it would hold and set off towards the ridge, Malchuskin driving. Rafael and a few of the workers clung to the sides of the truck.",

We were made a formal apology about what had happened the previous evening, and told that in spite of much discussion it had been decided that the Militia guard would be strengthened for the time being. Malchuskin protested, but the Barter guildsman could only agree: the decision had been taken against his own opinion.',
