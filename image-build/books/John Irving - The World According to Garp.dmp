            "T.S. GARP wrote a short story every month he was at Steering, from the end of his freshman year until his graduation, but it wasn't until his junior year that he showed anything he wrote to Helen. After her first year as a spectator at Steering, Helen was sent to Talbot Academy for girls, and Garp saw her only on occasional weekends. She would sometimes attend the home wrestling meets. It was <<after one|9w>> such match that Garp saw her and asked her to wait for him until he'd showered; he had something in his locker he wanted to give her.
\"Oh boy,\" Helen said. \"Your old elbow pads?\"
She didn't come to the wrestling room anymore, even if she was home from Talbot on a long vacation. She wore dark green knee socks and a gray flannel skirt, with pleats; often her sweater, always a dark and solid color, matched her knee socks, and always her long dark hair was up, twirled in a braid on top of her head, or complexly pinned. She had a wide mouth with very thin lips and she never wore lipstick. Garp knew that she always smelled nice, but he never touched her. He did not imagine that anyone did; she was as slender and nearly as tall as a young tree\x{2014}she was taller than Garp by two inches or more\x{2014}and she had sharp, almost painful-looking bones in her face, although her eyes behind her glasses were always soft and large, and a rich honey-brown.
\"Your old wrestling shoes?\" Helen asked him, inquiring of the large-sized, lumpy envelope that was sealed.
\"It's something to read,\" Garp said.
\"I've got plenty to read,\" Helen said.
\"It's something I wrote,\" Garp told her.
\"Oh boy,\" Helen said.
\"You don't have to read it now,\" Garp told her. \"You can take it back to school and write me a letter.\"
\"I've got plenty to write,\" Helen said. \"I've got papers due all the time.\"
\"Then we can talk about it, later,\" Garp said. \"Are you going to be here for Easter?\"
\"Yes, but I have a date,\" Helen said.
\"Oh boy,\" said Garp. But when be reached to take back his story, the knuckles of her long hand were very white and she would not let go of the package.
In the 133-pound class, his junior year, Garp finished the season with a won-lost record of 12-1, losing only in the finals of the New England championships. In his senior year, he would win everything\x{2014}captain the team, be voted Most Valuable Wrestler, and take the New England title. His team would represent the beginning of an almost twenty-year dominance of New England wrestling by Ernie Holm's Steering teams. In this part of the country, Ernie had what he called an Iowa advantage. When Ernie was gone, Steering wrestling would go downhill. And perhaps because Garp was the first of many Steering stars, he was always special to Ernie Holm.
Helen couldn't have cared less. She was glad when her father's wrestlers won, because that made her father happy. But in Garp's senior year, when he captained the Steering team, Helen never attended a single match. She did return his story, though\x{2014}in the mail from Talbot, with this letter.
Dear Garp,
This story shows promise, although I do think, at this point, you are more of a wrestler than a writer. There is a care taken with the language, and a feeling for people, but the situation seems rather contrived and the ending of this story is pretty juvenile. I do appreciate you showing it to me, though.
Yours,
Helen
There would be other rejection letters in Garp's writing career, of course, but none would mean as much to him as this one. Helen had actually been kind. The story Garp gave her was about two young lovers who are murdered in a cemetery by the girl's father, who thinks they are grave robbers. After this unfortunate error, the lovers are buried side by side; for some completely unknown reason, their graves are promptly robbed. It is not certain what becomes of the father\x{2014}not to mention the grave robber.
Jenny told Garp that his first efforts at writing were rather unreal, but Garp was encouraged by his English teacher\x{2014}the closest thing Steering had to a writer-in-residence, a frail man with a stutter whose name was Tinch. He had very bad breath, remindful to Garp of the dog breath of Bonkers\x{2014}a closed room of dead geraniums. But what Tinch said, though odorous, was kind. He applauded Garp's imagination, and he taught Garp, once and for all, good old grammar and a love of exact language. Tinch was called Stench by the Steering boys of Garp's day, and messages were constantly left for him about his halitosis. Mouthwash deposited on his desk. Toothbrushes in the campus mail.
It was <<after one|9w>> such message\x{2014}a package of spearmint breath fresheners taped to the map of Literary England\x{2014}that Tinch asked his composition class if they thought he had bad breath. The class sat as still as moss, but Tinch singled out young Garp, his favorite, his most trusted, and he asked him directly, \"Would you say, Garp, that my b-b-breath was bad?\"
Truth moved in and out of the open windows on this spring day of Garp's senior year. Garp was known for his humorless honesty, his wrestling, his English composition. His other grades were indifferent to poor. From an early age, Garp later claimed, he sought perfection and did not spread himself thin. His test scores, for general aptitude, showed that he wasn't very apt at anything; he was no natural. This came as no surprise to Garp, who shared with his mother a belief that nothing came naturally. But when a reviewer, after Garp's second novel, called Garp \"a born writer,\" Garp had a fit of mischief. He sent a copy of the review to the testing people in Princeton, New Jersey, with a note suggesting that they double-check their previous ratings. Then he sent a copy of his test scores to the reviewer, with a note that said: \"Thank you very much, but I wasn't \"born\" anything.\" In Garp's opinion, he was no more a \"born\" writer than he was a born nurse or a born ball turret gunner.
\"G-G-Garp?\" stuttered Mr. Tinch, bending close to the boy\x{2014}who smelled the terrible truth in Senior Honors English Composition. Garp knew he would win the annual creative writing prize. The sole judge was always Tinch. And if he could just pass third-year math, which he was taking for the second time, he would respectably graduate and make his mother very happy. \"Do I have b-b-bad breath, Garp?\" Tinch asked.
\"\"Good\" and \"bad\" are matters of opinion, sir,\" Garp said.
\"In your opinion, G-G-Garp?\" Tinch said.
\"In my opinion,\" Garp said, without batting an eye, \"you've got the best breath of any teacher at this school.\" And he looked hard across the classroom at Benny Potter from New York\x{2014}a born wise-ass, even Garp would agree\x{2014}and he stared Benny's grin off Benny's face because Garp's eyes said to Benny that Garp would break Benny's neck if he made a peep.
And Tinch said, \"Thank you, Garp,\" who won the writing prize, despite the note submitted with his last paper.
Mr. Tinch: I lied in class because I didn't want those other assholes to laugh at you. You should know, however, that your breath is really pretty bad. Sorry.
T. S. Garp
\"You know w-w-what?\" Tinch asked Garp when they were alone together, talking about Garp's last story.
\"What?\" Garp said.
\"There's nothing I can d-d-do about my breath,\" Tinch said. \"I think it's because I'm d-d-dying,\" he said, with a twinkle. \"I'm r-r-rotting from the inside out!\" But Garp was not amused and he watched for news of Tinch for years after his graduation, relieved that the old gentleman did not appear to have anything terminal.
Tinch would die in the Steering quadrangle one winter night of causes wholly unrelated to his bad breath. He was coming home from a faculty party, where it was admitted that he'd possibly had too much to drink, and he slipped on the ice and knocked himself unconscious on the frozen footpath. The night watchman did not find the body until almost dawn, by which time Tinch had frozen to death.
It is unfortunate that wise-ass Benny Potter was the first to tell Garp the news. Garp ran into Potter in New York, where Potter worked for a magazine. Garp's low opinion of Potter was enhanced by Garp's low opinion of magazines, and by Garp's belief that Potter always envied Garp for Garp's more significant output as a writer. \"Potter is one of those wretches who has a dozen novels hidden in his drawers,\" Garp wrote, \"but he wouldn't dare show them to anybody.\"
In Garp's Steering years, however, Garp was also not outgoing at showing his work around. Only Jenny and Tinch got to see his progress\x{2014}and there was the one story he gave Helen Holm. Garp decided he wouldn't give Helen another story until he wrote one that was so good she wouldn't be able to say anything bad about it.
\"Did you hear?\" Benny Potter asked Garp in New York. \"What?\" Garp said.
\"Old Stench kicked off,\" Benny said. \"He f-f-froze to death.\"
\"What did you say?\" Garp said.
\"Old Stench,\" Potter said. Garp had never liked that nickname. \"He got drunk and went wobbling home through the quad\x{2014}fell down and cracked his noggin, and never woke up in the morning.\"
\"You asshole,\" Garp said.
\"It's the truth, Garp,\" Benny said. \"It was fucking fifteen-below. Although,\" he added, dangerously, \"I'd have thought that old furnace of a mouth of his would have kept him w-w-warm.\"
They were in the bar of a nice hotel, somewhere in the Fifties, somewhere between Park Avenue and Third; Garp never knew where he was when he was in New York. He was meeting someone else for lunch and had run into Potter, who had brought him here. Garp picked Potter up by his armpits and sat him on the bar.
\"You little gnat, Potter,\" Garp said.
\"You never liked me,\" Benny said.
Garp tipped Benny Potter backward on the bar so that the pockets of Potter's open suit jacket were dipped into the bar sink. \"Leave me alone!\" Benny said. \"You were always old Stench's favorite ass-wipe!\"
Garp shoved Benny so that Benny's rump slouched into the bar sink; the sink was full of soaking glasses, and the water sloshed up on the bar.
\"Please don't sit on the bar, sir,\" the bartender said to Benny. \"Jesus Christ, I'm being assaulted, you moron!\" Benny said. Garp was already leaving and the bartender had to pull Benny Potter out of the sink and set him down, off the bar. \"That son of a bitch, my ass is all wet!\" Benny cried.
\"Would you please watch your language here, sir?\" the bartender said. \"My fucking wallet is soaked!\" Benny said, wringing out the seat of his pants and holding up his sodden wallet to the bartender. \"Garp!\" Benny hollered, but Garp was gone. \"You always had a lousy sense of humor, Garp!\"
It is fair to say, especially in Garp's Steering days, that he was at least rather humorless about his wrestling and his writing\x{2014}his favorite pastime and his would-be career.",

            "\"How do you know you're going to be a writer,\" Cushie Percy asked him once.
It was Garp's senior year and they were walking out of town along the Steering River to a place Cushie said she knew. She was home for the weekend from Dibbs. The Dibbs School was the fifth prep school for girls that Cushie Percy had attended; she'd started out at Talbot, in Helen's class, but Cushie had disciplinary problems and she'd been asked to leave. The disciplinary problems had repeated themselves at three other schools. Among the boys at Steering, the Dibbs School was famous\x{2014}and popular\x{2014}for its girls with disciplinary problems.
It was high tide on the Steering River and Garp watched an eight-oared shell glide out on the water; a sea gull followed it. Cushie Percy took Garp's hand. Cushie had many complicated ways of testing a boy's affection for her. Many of the Steering boys were willing to handle Cushie when they were alone with her, but most of them did not like to be seen demonstrating any affection for her. Garp, Cushie noticed, didn't care. He held her hand firmly; of course, they had grown up together, but she did not think they were very good or close friends. At least, Cushie thought, if Garp wanted what the others wanted, he was not embarrassed to be seen pursuing it. Cushie liked him for this.
\"I thought you were going to be a wrestler,\" Cushie said to Garp.
\"I am a wrestler,\" Garp said. \"I'm going to be a writer.\"
\"And you're going to marry Helen Holm,\" Cushie teased him.
\"Maybe,\" Garp said; his hand went a little limp in hers. Cushie knew this was another humorless topic with him\x{2014}Helen Holm\x{2014}and she should be careful.
A group of Steering boys came up the river path toward them; they passed, and one of them called back, \"What are you getting into, Garp?\"
Cushie squeezed his hand. \"Don't let them bother you,\" she said.
\"They don't bother me,\" Garp said.
\"What are you going to write about?\" Cushie asked him.
\"I don't know,\" Garp said.
He didn't even know if he was going to college. Some schools in the Midwest had been interested in his wrestling, and Ernie Holm had written some letters. Two places had asked to see him and Garp had visited them. In their wrestling rooms, he had not felt so much outclassed as he had felt outwanted. The college wrestlers seemed to want to beat him more than he wanted to beat them. But one school had made him a cautious offer\x{2014}a little money, and no promises beyond the first year. Fair enough, considering he was from New England. But Ernie had told him this already. \"It's a different sport out there, kid. I mean, you've got the ability\x{2014}and if I do say so myself, you've had the coaching. What you haven't had is the competition. And you've got to be hungry for it, Garp. You've got to really be interested, you know.\"
And when he asked Tinch about where he should go to school, for his writing, Tinch had appeared at a typical loss. \"Some g-g-good school, I guess,\" he said. \"But if you're going to w-w-write,\" Tinch said, \"won't you d-d-do it anywhere?\"
\"You have a nice body,\" Cushie Percy whispered to Garp, and he squeezed her hand back.
\"So do you,\" he told her, honestly. She had, in fact, an absurd body. Small but wholly bloomed, a compact blossom. Her name, Garp thought, should not have been Cushman but Cushion\x{2014}and since their childhood together, he had sometimes called her that. \"Hey, Cushion, want to take a walk?\" She said she knew a place.
\"Where are you taking me?\" Garp asked her.
\"Ha!\" she said. \"You're taking me. I'm just showing you the way. And the place,\" she said.
They went off the path by the part of the Steering River that long ago was called The Gut. A ship had been mired there once, but there was no visible evidence. Only the shore betrayed a history. It was at this narrow bend that Everett Steering had imagined obliterating the British\x{2014}and here were Everett's cannons, three huge iron tubes, rusting into the concrete mountings. Once they had swiveled, of course, but the later-day town fathers had fixed them forever in place. Beside them was a permanent cluster of cannon balls, grown together in cement. The balls were greenish and red with rust, as if they belonged to a vessel long undersea, and the concrete platform where the cannons were mounted was now littered with youthful trash\x{2014}beer cans and broken glass. The grassy slope leading down to the still and almost empty river was trampled, as if nibbled by sheep\x{2014}but Garp knew it was merely pounded by countless Steering schoolboys and their dates. Cushie's choice of a place to go was not very original, though it was like her, Garp thought.
Garp liked Cushie, and William Percy had always treated Garp well. Garp had been too young to know Stewie Two, and Dopey was Dopey. Young Pooh was a strange, scary child, Garp thought, but Cushie's touching brainlessness was straight from her mother, Midge Steering Percy. Garp felt dishonest with Cushie for not mentioning what he took to be the utter assholery of her father, Fat Stew.
\"Haven't you ever been here before?\" Cushie asked Garp.
\"Maybe with my mother,\" Garp said, \"but it's been a while.\" Of course he knew what \"the cannons\" were. The pet phrase at Steering was \"getting banged at the cannons\"\x{2014}as in \"I got banged at the cannons last weekend,\" or \"You should have seen old Fenley blasting away at the cannons.\" Even the cannons themselves bore these informal inscriptions: \"Paul banged Betty, '58,\" and \"M. Overton, '59, shot his wad here.\"
Across the languid river Garp watched the golfers from the Steering Country Club. Even far away, their ridiculous clothing looked unnatural against the green fairway and beyond the marsh grass that grew down to the mudflats. Their madras prints and plaids among the green-brown, gray-brown shoreline made them look like cautious and out-of-place land animals following their hopping white dots across a lake. \"Jesus, golf is silly,\" Garp said. His thesis of games with balls and clubs, again; Cushie had heard it before and wasn't interested. She settled down in a soft place\x{2014}the river below them, bushes around them, and over their shoulders the yawning mouths of the great cannons. Garp looked up into the mouth of the nearest cannon and was startled to see the head of a smashed doll, one glassy eye on him.
Cushie unbuttoned his shirt and lightly bit his nipples.
\"I like you,\" she said.
\"I like you, Cushion,\" he said.
\"Does it spoil it?\" Cushie asked him. \"Us being old friends?\"
\"Oh no,\" he said. He hoped they would hurry ahead to \"it\" because it had never happened to Garp before, and he was counting on Cushie for her experience. They kissed wetly in the well-pounded grass; Cushie was an open-mouthed kisser, artfully jamming her hard little teeth into his.
Honest, even at this age, Garp tried to mumble to her that he thought her father was an idiot.
\"Of course he is,\" Cushie agreed. \"Your mother's a little strange, too, don't you think?\"
Well, yes, Garp supposed she was. \"But I like her anyway,\" he said, most faithful of sons. Even then.
\"Oh, I like her, too,\" Cushie said. Thus having said what was necessary, Cushie undressed. Garp undressed, but she asked him, suddenly, \"Come on, where is it?\"
Garp panicked. Where was what? He'd thought she was holding it.
\"Where's your thing?\" Cushie demanded, tugging what Garp thought was his thing.
\"What?\" Garp said.
\"Oh wow, didn't you bring any?\" Cushie asked him. Garp wondered what he was supposed to have brought.
\"What?\" he said.
\"Oh, Garp,\" Cushie said. \"Don't you have any rubbers?\"
He looked apologetically at her. He was only a boy who'd lived his whole life with his mother, and the only rubber he'd seen had been slipped over the doorknob of their apartment in the infirmary annex, probably by a fiendish boy named Meckler\x{2014}long since graduated and gone on to destroy himself.
Still, he should have known: Garp had heard much conversation of rubbers, of course.
\"Come here,\" Cushie said. She led him to the cannons. \"You've never done this, have you?\" she asked him. He shook his head, honest to his sheepish core. \"Oh, Garp,\" she said. \"If you weren't such an old friend.\" She smiled at him, but he knew she wouldn't let him do it, now. She pointed into the mouth of the middle cannon. \"Look,\" she said. He looked. A jewel-like sparkle of ground glass, like pebbles he imagined might make up a tropical beach; and something else, not so pleasant. \"Rubbers,\" Cushle told him.
The cannon was crammed with old condoms. Hundreds of prophylactics! A display of arrested reproduction. Like dogs urinating around the borders of their territory, the boys of the Steering School had left their messes in the mouth of the mammoth cannon guarding the Steering River. The modern world had left its stain upon another historical landmark.
Cushie was getting dressed. \"You don't know anything,\" she teased him, \"so what are you going to write about?\" He had suspected this would pose a problem for a few years\x{2014}a kink in his career plans.
He was about to get dressed but she made him lie down so that she could look at him. \"You are beautiful,\" she said. \"And it's all right.\" She kissed him.
\"I can go get some rubbers,\" he said. \"It wouldn't take long, would it? And we could come back.\"
\"My train leaves at <<five|9c:1>>,\" Cushie said, but she smiled sympathetically.
\"I didn't think you had to be back at any special time,\" Garp said.
\"Well, even Dibbs has some rules, you know,\" Cushie said; she sounded hurt by her school's lax reputation. \"And besides,\" she said, \"you see Helen. I know you do, don't you?\"
\"Not like this,\" he admitted.
\"Garp, you shouldn't tell anybody everything,\" Cushie said.
It was a problem with his writing, too; Mr. Tinch had told him.
\"You're too serious, all the time,\" Cushie said, because for once she was in a position where she could lecture him.
On the river below them an eight-oared shell sleeked through the narrow channel of water remaining in The Gut and rowed toward the Steering boathouse before the tide went out and left them without enough water to get home on.
Then Garp and Cushie saw the golfer. He had come down through the marsh grass on the other side of the river; with his violet madras slacks rolled up above his knees, he waded into the mud flats where the tide had already receded. Ahead of him, on the wetter mud flats, lay his golf ball, perhaps six feet from the edge of the remaining water. Gingerly, the golfer stepped forward, but the mud now rose above his calf; using his golf club for balance, he dipped the shiny head into the muck and swore.
\"Harry, come back!\" someone called to him. It was his golfing partner, a man dressed with equal vividness, knee-length shorts of a green that no grass ever was and yellow knee socks. The golfer called Harry grimly stepped closer to his ball. He looked like a rare aquatic bird pursuing its egg in an oil slick.
\"Harry, you're going to sink in that shit!\" his friend warned him. It was then that Garp recognized Harry's partner: the man in green and yellow was Cushie's father, Fat Stew.
\"It's a new ball!\" Harry yelled; then his left leg disappeared, up to the hip; trying to turn back, Harry lost his balance and sat down. Quickly, he was mired to his waist, his frantic face very red above his powder-blue shirt\x{2014}bluer than any sky. He waved his club but it slipped out of his hand and sailed into the mud, inches from his ball, impossibly white and forever out of Harry's reach.
\"Help!\" Harry screamed. But on all fours he was able to move a few feet toward Fat Stew and the safety of shore. \"It feels like eels!\" he cried. He moved forward on the trunk of his body, using his arms the way a seal on land will use its flippers. An awful slorping noise pursued him through the mud flats, as if beneath the mud some mouth was gasping to suck him in.
Garp and Cushie stifled their laughter in the bushes. Harry made his last lunge for shore. Stewart Percy, trying to help, stepped on the mud flats with just one foot and promptly lost a golf shoe and a yellow sock to the suction.
\"Ssshhh! And lie still,\" Cushie demanded. They both noticed Garp was erect. \"Oh, that's too bad,\" Cushie whispered, looking sadly at his erection, but when he tried to tug her down in the grass with him, she said, \"I don't want babies, Garp. Not even yours. And yours might be a Jap baby, you know,\" Cushie said. \"And I surely don't want one of those.\"
\"What?\" Garp said. It was one thing not to know about rubbers, but what's this about Jap babies? he wondered.
\"Ssshhh,\" Cushie whispered. \"I'm going to give you something to write about.\"
The furious golfers were already slashing their way through the marsh grass, back to the immaculate fairway, when Cushie's mouth nipped the edge of Garp's tight belly button. Garp was never sure if his actual memory was jolted by that word Jap, and if at that moment he truly recalled bleeding in the Percys' house\x{2014}little Cushie telling her parents that \"Bonkie bit Garp\" (and the scrutiny the child Garp had undergone in front of the naked Fat Stew). It may have been then that Garp remembered Fat Stew saying he had Jap eyes, and a view of his personal history clicked into perspective; regardless, at this moment Garp resolved to ask his mother for more details than she had offered him up to now. He felt the need to know more than that his father had been a soldier, and so forth. But he also felt Cushie Percy's soft lips on his belly, and when she took him suddenly into her warm mouth, he was very surprised and his sense of resolve was as quickly blown as the rest of him. There under the triple barrels of the Steering family cannons, T. S. Garp was first treated to sex in this relatively safe and nonreproductive manner. Of course, from Cushie's point of view, it was nonreciprocal, too.
They walked back along the Steering River holding hands.
\"I want to see you next weekend,\" Garp told her. He resolved he would not forget the rubbers.
\"I know you really love Helen,\" Cushie said. She probably hated Helen Holm, if she really knew her at all. Helen was such a snob about her brains.
\"I still want to see you,\" Garp said.
\"You're nice,\" Cushie told him, squeezing his hand. \"And you're my oldest friend.\" But they both must have known that you can know someone all your life and never quite be friends.
\"Who told you my father was Japanese?\" Garp asked her.
\"I don't know,\" Cushie said. \"I don't know if he really is, either.\"
\"I don't either,\" Garp admitted.
\"I don't know why you don't ask your mother,\" Cushie said. But of course he had asked, and Jenny was absolutely unwavering from her first and only version.",

            "Garp had a foolish ego that went out of its way to remember insults to and rejections of his work. It is fortunate for Helen that she had a ferocious ego of her own, for if she hadn't highly esteemed herself, she would have ended up hating him. As it was, they were lucky. Many couples live together and discover they're not in love; some couples never discover it. Others marry, and the news comes to them at awkward moments in their lives. In the case of Garp and Helen, they hardly knew each other but they had their hunches\x{2014}and in their stubborn, deliberate ways they fell in love with each other sometime after they had married.
Perhaps because they were so busy pursuing their singular careers they did not overscrutinize their relationship. Helen would graduate from college two years after she began; she would have a Ph.D. in English literature when she was only twenty-three, and her first job\x{2014}an assistant professor at a women's college\x{2014}when she was twenty-four. It would take Garp five years to finish his first novel, but it would be a good novel and it would earn him a respectable reputation for a young writer\x{2014}even if it wouldn't make him any money. By then, Helen would be making money for them. All the time that Helen went to school, and Garp was writing, Jenny took care of the money.
Jenny's book was more of a shock to Helen, when she first read it, than it was to Garp\x{2014}who, after all, had lived with his mother and was unsurprised by her eccentricity; it had become commonplace to him. Garp, however, was shocked by the book's success. He had not counted on becoming a public figure\x{2014}a leading character in someone else's book before he'd even written a book of his own.
The editor, John Wolf, would never forget the first morning at his office where he met Jenny Fields.
\"There's a nurse to see you,\" his secretary said, rolling her eyes\x{2014}as if this might be a paternity suit that her boss had on his hands. John Wolf and his secretary could not have known that a manuscript of 1,158 typed pages was what made Jenny's suitcase so heavy.
\"It's about me,\" she told John Wolf, opening her suitcase and hefting the monster manuscript to the top of his desk. \"When can you read it?\" It looked to John Wolf as if the woman intended to stay in his office while he read it. He glanced at the first sentence (\"In this dirty-minded world...\"), and he thought: Oh boy, how do I get rid of this one?
Later, of course, he was panic-stricken when he could not find a phone number for her; when he wanted to tell her that yes!\x{2014}they would certainly publish this!\x{2014}he could not have known that Jenny Fields was the proper guest of Ernie Holm at Steering, where Jenny and Ernie talked into the night, every night (the usual parental concern when parents discover that their nineteen-year-old children plan to get married).
\"Where can they go every night?\" Jenny asked. \"They don't come back here until <<two|9b>> or <<three|20a>>, and last night it rained. It rained all night, and they don't even have a car.\"
They went to the wrestling room. Helen, of course, had a key. And a wrestling mat was as comfortable and familiar to them as any bed. And much bigger.
\"They say they want children,\" Ernie complained. \"Helen should finish her education.\"
\"Garp will never finish a book, with children,\" Jenny said. After all, she was thinking that she'd had to wait eighteen years to begin her book.
\"They're both hard workers,\" Ernie said, to reassure himself and Jenny.
\"They'll have to be,\" Jenny said.
\"I don't know why they can't just live together,\" Ernie said. \"And if it works out, then let them get married\x{2014}then let them have a baby.\"
\"I don't know why anyone wants to live with anyone else,\" said Jenny Fields. Ernie looked a little hurt.
\"Well, you like Garp living with you,\" he reminded her, \"and I like Helen living with me. I really miss her when she's away at school.\"
\"It's lust,\" Jenny said, ominously. \"The world is sick with lust.\"
Ernie felt worried about her; he didn't know she was about to become rich and famous forever. \"Do you want a beer?\" he asked Jenny.
\"No, thank you,\" Jenny said.
\"They're good kids,\" Ernie reminded her.
\"But lust gets them all, in the end,\" said Jenny Fields, morosely, and Ernie Holm walked delicately to his kitchen and opened another beer for himself.
It was the \"lust\" chapter of A Sexual Suspect that especially embarrassed Garp. It was one thing to be a famous child born out of wedlock, quite another to be a famous case history of adolescent need\x{2014}his private randiness become a popular story. Helen thought it was very funny, though she confessed to not understanding his attraction to whores.
\"Lust makes the best men behave out of character,\" wrote Jenny Fields\x{2014}a line that particularly infuriated Garp.
\"What the hell does she know about it?\" he screamed. \"She never felt it, not once. Some authority she is! It's like listening to a plant describe the motives of a mammal!\"
But other reviewers were kinder to Jenny; though the more serious journals occasionally chided her for her actual writing, the media, in general, felt warmly toward the book. \"The first truly feminist autobiography that is as full of celebrating one kind of life as it is full of putting down another,\" somebody wrote. \"This brave book makes the important assertion that a woman can have a whole life without a sexual attachment of any kind,\" wrote somebody else.
\"These days,\" John Wolf had forewarned Jenny, \"you're either going to be taken as the right voice at the right time, or you're going to be put down as all wrong.\" She was taken as the right voice at the right time, but Jenny Fields, sitting whitely in her nurse's uniform\x{2014}in the restaurant where John Wolf took only his favorite writers\x{2014}felt discomfort at the word feminism. She was not sure what it meant, but the word reminded her of feminine hygiene and the Valentine treatment. After all, her formal training had been nursing. She said shyly that she'd only thought she made the right choice about how to live her life, and since it had not been a popular choice, she'd felt goaded into saying something to defend it. Ironically, a rash of young women at Florida State University in Tallahassee found Jenny's choice very popular; they generated a small controversy by plotting their own pregnancies. For a while, in New York, this syndrome among singular-minded women was called \"doing a Jenny Fields.\" But Garp always called it \"doing a Grillparzer.\" As for Jenny, she felt only that women\x{2014}just like men\x{2014}should at least be able to make conscious decisions about the course of their lives; if that made her a feminist, she said, then she guessed she was one.
John Wolf liked Jenny Fields very much, and he did what he could to warn her that she might not understand either the attacks or the praise her book would receive. But Jenny never wholly understood how \"political\" a book it was\x{2014}or how it would be used as such a book.
\"I was trained to be a nurse,\" she said later, in one of her disarming interviews. \"Nursing was the first thing I took to, and the first thing I ever wanted to do. It simply seemed very practical, to me, for someone who was healthy\x{2014}and I have always been bealthy\x{2014}to help people who weren't healthy or who couldn't help themselves. I think it was simply in that spirit that I wanted to write a book, too.\"
In Garp's opinion, his mother never stopped being a nurse. She had nursed him through the Steering School; she had been a plodding midwife to her own strange life story; finally, she became a kind of nurse to women with problems. She became a figure of famous strength; women sought her advice. With the sudden success of A Sexual Suspect, Jenny Fields uncovered a nation of women who faced making choices about how to live; these women felt encouraged by Jenny's own example of making unpopular decisions.
She could have started an advice column for any newspaper, but Jenny Fields felt through with writing, now\x{2014}just as she'd decided, once before, that she was through with education; just as she'd decided she was through with Europe. In a way, she was never through with nursing. Her father, the shocked shoe king, died of a heart attack shortly after the publication of A Sexual Suspect; although Jenny's mother never blamed Jenny's book for the tragedy\x{2014}and Jenny never blamed herself\x{2014}Jenny knew that her mother could not live alone. Unlike Jenny Fields, Jenny's mother had developed a habit of living with someone else; she was old now, and Jenny thought of her as rattling about in the great rooms at Dog's Head Harbor, purposeless and wholly without her few remaining wits in the absence of her mate.
Jenny went to care for her, and it was at the Dog's Head Harbor Mansion that Jenny first began her role as counselor to the women who sought some comfort from her no-nonsense ability to make decisions.
\"Even weird decisions!\" Garp wailed, but he was happy, and taken care of. He and Helen had their first child, almost immediately. It was a boy named Duncan. Garp often joked that the reason his first novel was written with so many short chapters was because of Duncan. Garp wrote between feedings and naps and changes of diapers. \"It was a novel of short takes,\" he claimed, later, \"and the credit is wholly Duncan's.\" Helen was at school every day; she had agreed to have a child only if Garp would agree to take care of it. Garp loved the idea of never having to go out. He wrote and took care of Duncan; he cooked and wrote and took care of Duncan some more. When Helen came home, she came home to a reasonably happy homemaker; as long as Garp's novel progressed, no routine, however mindless, could upset him. In fact, the more mindless, the better. He left Duncan for two hours every day with the woman in the downstairs apartment; he went to the gym. He later became an oddity at the women's college where Helen taught\x{2014}running endless laps around the field hockey field, or jumping rope for half an hour in a corner of the gymnasium reserved for gymnastics. He missed wrestling and complained to Helen that she should have gotten a job somewhere where there was a wrestling team; Helen complained that the English Department was too small, and she disliked having no male students in her classes, but it was a good job and she would keep it until something better came along.
Everything in New England is at least near everything else. They got to visit Jenny at the shore and Ernie at Steering. Garp would take Duncan to the Steering wrestling room and roll him around like a ball. \"This is where your daddy wrestled,\" he told him.
\"It's where your daddy did everything,\" Helen told Duncan, referring\x{2014}of course\x{2014}to Duncan's own conception, and to her first rainy night with Garp in the locked and empty Seabrook Gymnasium, on the warm crimson mats stretching wall to wall.
\"Well, you finally got me,\" Helen had whispered to him, tearfully, but Garp had sprawled there, on his back on the wrestling mat, wondering who had gotten whom.",

            "Garp joked that he called his first novel Procrastination because it had taken him so long to write it, but he had worked on it steadily and carefully; Garp was rarely a procrastinator.
The novel was called \"historical.\" It is set in the Vienna of the war years, 1938-45, and through the period of the Russian occupation. The main character is a young anarchist who has to lie low, after the Anschluss, waiting for just the right blow he can strike against the Nazis. He waits too long. The point being, he should better have struck before the Nazi takeover; but there is nothing he can be sure of, then, and he is too young to recognize what is happening. Also, his mother\x{2014}a widow\x{2014}cherishes her private life; unconcerned with politics, she hoards her dead husband's money.
Through the war years, the young anarchist works as a zookeeper at Sch\x{446}nbrunn. When the population of Vienna begins seriously starving, and <<midnight|13>> raids on the zoo are a common source of stolen food, the anarchist decides to liberate the remaining animals\x{2014}who are, of course, innocent of his country's own procrastination and its acquiescence to Nazi Germany. But by then the animals themselves are starving; when the anarchist frees them, they eat him. \"That was only natural,\" Garp wrote. The animals, in turn, are slaughtered easily by a starving mob now roaming Vienna for food\x{2014}just ahead of the Russian forces. That, too, was \"only natural.\"
The anarchist's mother survives the war and lives in the Russian zone of occupation (Garp gave her the same apartment he and his mother shared on the Schwindgasse); the miserly widow's tolerance is finally wearied by the repeated atrocities she now sees committed by the Soviets\x{2014}rape, chief among them. She watches the city restored to moderation and complacency, and she remembers her own inertia during the Nazi rise to power with great regret. Finally, the Russians leave; it is <<1956|9l>>, and Vienna retreats into itself again. But the woman mourns her son and her damaged country; she strolls the partially rebuilt and once again healthy zoo at Sch\x{446}nbrunn every weekend, recalling her secretive visits to her son there, during the war. It is the Hungarian Revolution that prompts the old lady's final action. Hundreds of thousands of new refugees come into Vienna.
In an effort to awaken the complacent city\x{2014}that it must not sit back and watch things develop again\x{2014}the mother tries to do what her son did: she releases the animals in the Sch\x{446}nbrunn Zoo. But the animals are well fed and content now; only a few of them can even be goaded into leaving their cages, and those who do wander out are easily confined in the Sch\x{446}nbrunn paths and gardens; eventually they're returned to their cages, unharmed. One elderly bear suffers a bout of violent diarrhea. The old woman's gesture of liberation is well intended but it is completely meaningless and totally unrealized. The old woman is arrested and an examining police doctor discovers that she has cancer; she is a terminal case.
Finally, and ironically, her hoarded money is of some use to her. She dies in luxury\x{2014}in Vienna's only private hospital, the Rudolfinerhaus. In her death dream she imagines that some animals escape from the zoo: a couple of young Asiatic Black Bears. She imagines them surviving and multiplying so successfully that they become famous as a new animal species in the valley of the Danube.
But this is only her imagination. The novel ends\x{2014}after the old woman's death\x{2014}with the death of the diarrhetic bear in the Sch\x{446}nbrunn Zoo. \"So much for revolution in modern times,\" wrote one reviewer, who called Procrastination \"an anti-Marxist novel.\"
The novel was praised for the accuracy of its historical research\x{2014}a point of no particular interest to Garp. It was also cited for originality and for having unusual scope for a first novel by such a young author. John Wolf had been Garp's publisher, and although he had agreed with Garp not to mention on the jacket flap that this was the first novel by the son of the feminist heroine Jenny Fields, there were few reviewers who failed to sound that chime.
\"It is amazing that the now-famous son of Jenny Fields,\" wrote one, \"has actually grown up to be what he said he wanted to be when be grew up.\" This, and other irrelevant cuteness concerning Garp's relationship to Jenny., made Garp very angry that his book couldn't be read and discussed for its own faults and/or merits, but John Wolf explained to him the hard fact that most readers were probably more interested in who he was than in what he'd actually written.
\"Young Mr. Garp is still writing about bears,\" chided one wit, who'd been energetic enough to uncover the Grillparzer story from its obscure publication. \"Perhaps, when he grows up, he'll write something about people.\"
But altogether, it was a literary debut more astonishing than most and more noticed. It was, of course, never a popular book, and it hardly made T. S. Garp into a brand name; it would not make him \"the household product\"\x{2014}as he called her\x{2014}that his mother had become. But it was not that kind of book; he was not that kind of writer, and never would be, John Wolf told him.
\"What do you expect?\" John Wolf wrote him. \"If you want to be rich and famous, get in another line. If you're serious about it, don't bitch. You wrote a serious book, it was published seriously. If you want to make a living off it, you're talking about another world. And remember: you're twenty-four years old. I think you'll write a lot more books.\"
John Wolf was an honorable and intelligent man, but Garp wasn't sure\x{2014}and he wasn't content. He had made a little money, and now Helen had a salary; now that he didn't need Jenny's money, Garp felt all right about accepting some when she simply gave it out. And he felt he'd at least earned another reward to himself: he asked Helen to have another baby. Duncan was four; he was old enough to appreciate a brother or a sister. Helen agreed, knowing how easy Garp had made it for her to have Duncan. If he wanted to change diapers between the chapters of his next book, that was up to him.
But it was actually more than merely wanting a second child that prompted Garp to reproduce again. He knew he was an overwatchful, worrisome father and he felt he might relieve Duncan of some of the pressure of fatherly fears if there was another child to absorb some of Garp's excess anxiety.
\"I'm very happy,\" Helen told him. \"If you want another baby, we'll make one. I just wish you'd relax, I wish you'd be happier. You wrote a good book, now you'll write another one. Isn't it just what you always wanted?\"
But he bitched about the reviews of Procrastination, and he moaned about the sales. He carped at his mother, and roared about her \"sycophantic friends.\" Finally Helen said to him, \"You want too much. Too much unqualified praise, or love\x{2014}or something that's unqualified, anyway. You want the world to say, \"I love your writing, I love you,\" and that's too much to want. That's really sick, in fact.\"
\"That's what you said,\" he reminded her, \"I love your writing, I love you.\" That's exactly what you said.\"
\"But there can only be one of me,\" Helen reminded him.
Indeed, there would only be one of her, and he loved her very much. He would always call her \"the wisest of my life's decisions.\" He made some unwise decisions, he would admit; but in the first five years of his marriage to Helen, he was unfaithful to her only once\x{2014}and it was brief.
It was a baby-sitter from the college where Helen taught, a freshman girl from Helen's Freshman English class; she was nice with Duncan, though Helen said that the girl was not a very special student. Her name was Cindy; she had read Garp's Procrastination, and she'd been properly awed. When he drove her home, she would ask him one question after another about his writing: How did you think of THAT? and what made you do it THIS way? She was a tiny thing, all flutters and twitches and coos\x{2014}as trusting, as constant, and as stupid as a Steering pigeon. \"Little Squab Bones,\" Helen called her, but Garp was attracted; he called her nothing. The Percy family had given him a permanent dislike of nicknames. And he liked Cindy's questions.
Cindy was dropping out of school because she felt a women's college was not right for her; she needed to live with grownups, and with men, she said, and although the college allowed her to move off-campus\x{2014}into her own apartment, in the second semester of her freshman year\x{2014}still she felt the college was too \"restricted\" and she wanted to live in a \"more real environment.\" She imagined that Garp's Vienna had been a \"more real environment,\" though Garp struggled to assure her that it had not been. Little Squab Bones, Garp thought, was puppy-brained, and as soft and as easily influenced as a banana. But he wanted her, he realized, and he saw her as simply available\x{2014}like the whores on the K\x{434}rntnerstrasse, she would be there when he asked her. And she would cost him only lies.
Helen read him a review from a famous news magazine; the review called Procrastination \"a complex and moving novel with sharp historic resonances...the drama encompasses the longings and agonies of youth.\"
\"Oh fuck \"the longings and agonies of youth,\"\" Garp said. One of those youthful longings was embarrassing him now.
As for the \"drama\": in the first five years of his marriage to Helen, T. S. Garp experienced only one real-life drama, and it did not have that much to do with him.",

            "Garp was unable to write for months because of it, but the article impressed all the locals who knew Garp only from the super-market, the gymnasium, the drugstore. In the meantime, Procrastination had been published\x{2014}but almost no one seemed to know. For weeks, clerks and salespeople would introduce him to other customers: \"Here's Mr. Garp, the one who nabbed that molester in the park.\"
\"What molester?\"
\"That one in city park. The Mustache Kid. He went after little girls.\"
\"Children?\"
\"Well, Mr. Garp here is the one who got him.\"
\"Well, actually,\" Garp would say, \"it was the policeman on his horse.\"
\"Knocked all his teeth down his throat, too!\" they would crow with delight\x{2014}the druggist and the clerk and the salespeople here and there.
\"Well, that was actually the horse,\" Garp admitted, modestly.
And sometimes someone would ask, \"And what is it you do, Mister Garp?\"
The following silence would pain Garp, as he stood thinking that it was probably best to say that he ran\x{2014}for a living. He cruised the parks, a molester-nabber by profession. He hung around phone booths, like that man in the cape\x{2014}waiting for disasters. Any of this would make more sense to them than what he really did.
\"I write,\" Garp would finally admit. Disappointment\x{2014}even suspicion\x{2014}all over their once-admiring faces.
In the drugstore\x{2014}to make matters worse\x{2014}Garp dropped the package of three prophylactics.
\"A-ha!\" the old man cried. \"Look there! What's he up to with those?\"
Garp wondered what options there were for what he could be up to with those.
\"A pervert on the loose,\" the old man assured the druggist. \"Looking for innocence to violate and defile!\"
The old geezer's self-righteousness was irritating to the point that Garp had no desire to settle the misunderstanding; in fact, he rather enjoyed the \"memory of unpantsing the old bird in the park and he was not in the least sorry for the accident.
It was some time later when Garp realized that the old gentleman had no monopoly on self-righteousness. Garp took Duncan to a high school basketball game and was appalled that the ticket-taker was none other than the Mustache Kid\x{2014}the real molester, the attacker of that helpless child in the city park.
\"You're out,\" Garp said, amazed. The pervert smiled openly at Duncan.
\"One adult, one kiddy,\" he said, tearing off tickets.
\"How'd you ever get free?\" Garp asked; he felt himself tremble with violence.
\"Nobody proved nothing,\" the kid said, haughtily. \"That dumb girl wouldn't even talk.\" Garp thought again of Ellen James with her tongue cut off at <<eleven|9c:1>>.
He felt a sudden sympathy for the madness of the old man he had so unpleasantly unpantsed. He felt such a terrible sense of injustice that he could even imagine some very unhappy woman despairing enough to cut off her own tongue. He knew that he wanted to hurt the Mustache Kid, on the spot\x{2014}in front of Duncan. He wished he could arrange a maiming as a kind of moral lesson.
But there was a crowd wanting basketball tickets; Garp was holding things up.
\"Move along, hair pie,\" the kid said to Garp. In the kid's expression, Garp thought he recognized the leer of the world. On the kid's upper lip was the insipid evidence that he was growing another mustache...
It was years later when he saw the child, a girl grown up; it was only because she recognized him that he recognized her. He was coming out of a movie theater in another town; she was in the line waiting to come in. Some of her friends were with her.
\"Hello, how are you?\" Garp asked. He was glad to see she had friends. That meant, to Garp, that she was normal.
\"Is it a good movie?\" the girl asked.
\"You've certainly grown!\" Garp said; the girl blushed and Garp realized what a stupid thing he'd said. \"Well, I mean it's been a long time\x{2014}and it was a time well worth forgetting!\" he added, heartily. Her friends were moving inside the movie theater and the girl gave a quick look after them to make sure she was really alone with Garp.
\"Yes, I'm graduating this month,\" she said.
\"High school?\" Garp wondered aloud. Could it have been that long ago?
\"Oh no, junior high,\" the girl said, laughing nervously.
\"Wonderful!\" Garp said. And without knowing why, he said, \"I'll try to come.\"
But the girl looked suddenly stricken. \"No, please,\" she said. \"Please don't come.\"
\"Okay, I won't,\" Garp agreed quickly.
He saw her several times after this meeting, but she never recognized him again because he shaved off his beard. \"Why don't you grow another beard?\" Helen occasionally asked him. \"Or at least a mustache.\" But whenever Garp encountered the molested girl, and escaped unrecognized, he was convinced he should remain clean-shaven.",

            "LATE-NIGHT phone calls\x{2014}those burglar alarms in the heart\x{2014}would frighten Garp all his life. Who is it that I love? Garp's heart would cry, at the first ring\x{2014}who's been blasted by a truck, who's drowned in the beer or lies side-swiped by an elephant in the terrible darkness?
Garp feared the receiving of such after-midnight calls, but he once made one\x{2014}unknowingly\x{2014}himself. It had been one evening when Jenny was visiting them; his mother had let it slip how Cushie Percy had ruptured in childbirth. Garp had not heard of it, and although he occasionally joked with Helen about his old passion for Cushie\x{2014}and Helen teased him about her\x{2014}the news of Cushie dead was nearly crippling to Garp. Cushman Percy had been so active\x{2014}there had been such a hot juiciness about her\x{2014}it seemed impossible. News of an accident to Alice Fletcher could not have upset him more; he felt more prepared for something happening to her. Sadly, he knew, things would always be happening to Quiet Alice.
Garp wandered into the kitchen and without really noticing the time, or remembering when he opened another beer, he discovered that he had dialed the Percys' number; the phone was ringing. Slowly, Garp could imagine the long way back from sleep that Fat Stew had to travel before he could answer the phone.
\"God, who are you calling?\" Helen asked, coming into the kitchen. \"It's <<quarter of two|10>>!\"
Before Garp could hang up, Stewart Percy answered the phone.
\"Yes?\" Fat Stew asked, worriedly, and Garp could imagine frail and brainless Midge sitting up in bed beside him, as nervous as a cornered hen.
\"I'm sorry I woke you,\" Garp said. \"I didn't realize it was so late.\" Helen shook her head and walked abruptly out of the kitchen. Jenny appeared in the kitchen doorway; on her face was the kind of critical look only a mother can give a son. That is a look with more disappointment in it than the usual anger.
\"Who the hell is this?\" Stewart Percy said.
\"This is Garp, sir,\" Garp said, a little boy again, apologizing for his genes.
\"Holy shit,\" said Fat Stew. \"What do you want?\"
Jenny had neglected to tell Garp that Cushie Percy had died months ago; Garp thought he was offering condolences on a fresh disaster. Thus he faltered.
\"I'm sorry, very sorry,\" Garp said.
\"You said so, you said so,\" Stewart said.
\"I just heard about it,\" Garp said, \"and I wanted to tell you and Mrs. Percy how truly sorry I was. I may not have demonstrated it, to you, sir, but I was really very fond of\x{2014}\"
\"You little swine!\" said Stewart Percy. \"You mother humper, you Jap ball of shit!\" He hung up the phone.
Even Garp was unprepared for this much loathing. But he misunderstood the situation. It would be years before he realized the circumstances of his phone call. Poor Pooh Percy, batty Bainbridge, would one day explain it to Jenny. When Garp called, Cushie had been dead for so long that Stewart did not realize Garp was commiserating with him on Cushie's loss. When Garp called, it was the <<midnight|13>> of the dark day when the black beast, Bonkers, had finally expired. Stewart Percy thought that Garp's call was a cruel joke\x{2014}false condolences for the dog Garp had always hated.
And now, when Garp's phone rang, Garp was conscious of Helen's grip emerging instinctively from her sleep. When he picked up the phone, Helen had his leg clamped fast between her knees\x{2014}as if she were holding tight to the life and safety that his body was to her. Garp's mind ran through the odds. Walt was home asleep. And so was Duncan; he was not at Ralph's.
Helen thought: It is my father; it's his heart. Sometimes she thought: They've finally found and identified my mother. In a morgue.
And Garp thought: They have murdered Mom. Or they are holding her for ransom\x{2014}men who will accept nothing less than the public rape of forty virgins before releasing the famous feminist, unharmed. And they'll also demand the lives of my children, and so forth.
It was Roberta Muldoon on the phone, and that only convinced Garp that the victim was Jenny Fields. But the victim was Roberta.
\"He's left me,\" Roberta said, her huge voice swollen with tears. \"He's thrown me over. Me! Can you believe it?\"
\"Jesus, Roberta,\" Garp said.
\"Oh, I never knew what shits men were until I became a woman,\" Roberta said.
\"It's Roberta,\" Garp whispered to Helen, so that she could relax. \"Her lover's flown the coop.\" Helen sighed, released Garp's leg, rolled over.
\"You don't even care, do you?\" Roberta asked Garp, testily. \"Please, Roberta,\" Garp said.
\"I'm sorry,\" Roberta said. \"But I thought it was too late to call your mother.\" Garp found this logic astonishing, since he knew that Jenny stayed up later than he did; but he also liked Roberta, very much, and she had certainly had a hard time.
\"He said I wasn't enough of a woman, that I confused him, sexually\x{2014}that I was confused sexually!\" Roberta cried. \"Oh, God, that prick. All he wanted was the novelty of it. He was just showing off for his friends.\"
\"I'll bet you could have taken him, Roberta,\" Garp said. \"Why didn't you beat the shit out of him?\"
\"You don't understand,\" Roberta said. \"I don't feel like beating the shit out of anyone, anymore. I'm a woman!\"...
\"Don't women ever feel like beating the shit out of someone?\" Garp asked. Helen reached over to him and pulled his cock.
\"I don't know what women feel like,\" Roberta wailed. \"I don't know what they're supposed to feel like, anyway. I just know what I feel like.\"
\"What's that?\" Garp asked, knowing she wanted to tell him.
\"I feel like beating the shit out of him now,\" Roberta confessed, \"but when he was dumping all over me, I just sat there and took it. I even cried. I've been crying all day!\" she cried, \"and he even called me up and told me that if I was still crying I was faking myself.\"
\"The hell with him,\" Garp said.
\"All he wanted was a great big lay,\" Roberta said. \"Why are men like that?\"
\"Well,\" Garp said.
\"Oh, I know you're not,\" Roberta said. \"I'm not even attractive to you, probably.\"
\"Of course you're attractive, Roberta,\" Garp said.
\"But not to you,\" Roberta said. \"Don't lie. I'm not sexually attractive, am I?\"
\"Not really to me,\" Garp confessed, \"but to lots of other men, yes. Of course you are.\"
\"Well, you're a good friend, that's more important,\" Roberta said. \"You're not really sexually attractive to me, either.\"
\"That's perfectly all right,\" Garp said.
\"You're too short,\" Roberta said. \"I like longer-looking people\x{2014}I mean, sexually. Don't be hurt.\"
\"I'm not hurt,\" Garp said. \"Don't you be, either.\"
\"Of course not,\" Roberta said.
\"Why not call me in the morning,\" Garp suggested. \"You'll feel better.\"
\"I won't,\" Roberta said, sulkily. \"I'll feel worse. And I'll feel ashamed that I called you.\"
\"Why not talk to your doctor?\" Garp said. \"The urologist? The fellow who did your operation\x{2014}he's your friend, isn't he?\"
\"I think he wants to fuck me,\" Roberta said, seriously. \"I think that's all he ever wanted to do to me. I think he recommended this whole operation just because he wanted to seduce me, but he wanted to make me a woman first. They're notorious for that\x{2014}a friend was telling me.\"
\"A crazy friend, Roberta,\" Garp said. \"Who's notorious for that?\"
\"Urologists,\" Roberta said. \"Oh, I don't know\x{2014}isn't urology a little creepy to you?\" It was, but Garp didn't want to upset Roberta any further.
\"Call Mom,\" he heard himself say. \"She'll cheer you up, she'll think of something.\"
\"Oh, she is wonderful,\" Roberta sobbed. \"She always does think of something, but I feel I've used her for so much.\"
\"She loves to help, Roberta,\" Garp said, and knew it was, at least, the truth. Jenny Fields was full of sympathy and patience, and Garp only wanted to sleep. \"A good game of squash might help, Roberta,\" Garp suggested, weakly. \"Why not come over for a few days and we'll really hit the ball around.\" Helen rolled into him, frowned at him, and bit his nipple; Helen liked Roberta, but in the early phase of her sex reassignment Roberta could talk only about herself.
\"I just feel so drained,\" Roberta said. \"No energy, no nothing. I don't even know if I could play.\"
\"Well, you should try, Roberta,\" Garp said. \"You should make yourself do something.\" Helen, exasperated with him, rolled away from him.
But Helen was affectionate with Garp when he answered these late-night calls; she said they frightened her and she didn't want to be the one to find out what the calls were about. It was strange, therefore, that when Roberta Muldoon called a second time, a few weeks later, Helen was the one who answered the phone. It surprised Garp because the phone was on his side of the bed and Helen had to reach over him to pick it up; in fact, this time, she lunged across him and whispered quickly to the phone, \"Yes, what is it?\" When she heard it was Roberta, she passed the phone quickly to Garp; it was not as if she'd been trying to let him sleep.
And when Roberta called a third time, Garp felt an absence when he picked up the phone. Something was missing. \"Oh, hello, Roberta,\" Garp said. It was Helen's usual grip on his leg: it wasn't there. Helen wasn't there, he noticed. He talked reassuringly to Roberta, felt the cold side of his unshared bed, and noted the time was <<2 A.M.|5>>\x{2014}Roberta's favorite hour. When Roberta finally hung up, Garp went downstairs to look for Helen, finding her all alone on the living-room couch, sitting up with a glass of wine and a manuscript in her lap.
\"Couldn't sleep,\" she said, but there was a look on her face\x{2014}it was a look Garp couldn't immediately place. Although he thought he recognized that look, he also thought he had never seen that look on Helen.
\"Reading papers?\" he asked; she nodded, but there was only one manuscript in front of her. Garp picked it up.
\"It's just student work,\" she said, reaching for it.
The student's name was Michael Milton. Garp read a paragraph of the paper. \"It sounds like a story,\" Garp said. \"I didn't know you assigned fiction writing to your students.\"
\"I don't,\" Helen said, \"but they sometimes show me what they do, anyway.\"
Garp read another paragraph. He thought that the writer's style was self-conscious and forced, but there were no errors on the page; it was, at least, competent writing.
\"He's one of my graduate students,\" Helen said. \"He's very bright, but...\" She shrugged, but her gesture had the sudden mock casualness of an embarrassed child.
\"But what?\" Garp said. He laughed\x{2014}that Helen could look so girlish at this late hour.
But Helen took her glasses off and showed him that other look again, that look he had first seen and couldn't place. Anxiously, she said, \"Oh, I don't know. Young, maybe. He's just young, you know. Very bright, but young.\"
Garp flipped a page, read half of another paragraph, gave the manuscript back to her. He shrugged. \"It's all shit to me,\" he said.
\"No, it's not shit,\" Helen said, seriously. Oh, Helen the judicious teacher, Garp thought, and announced he was going back to bed. \"I'll be up in a little while,\" Helen told him.
Then Garp saw himself in the mirror in the upstairs bathroom. That was where he finally identified that look he'd seen, strangely out of place, on Helen's face. It was a look Garp recognized because he'd seen it before\x{2014}on his own face, from time to time, but never on Helen's. The look Garp recognized was guilty, and it puzzled him. He lay awake a long time but Helen did not come up to bed. In the morning Garp was surprised that although he'd only glanced at the graduate student's manuscript, the name of Michael Milton was the first thing to come to his mind. He looked cautiously at Helen, now lying awake beside him.
\"Michael Milton,\" Garp said quietly, not to her, but loud enough for her to hear. He watched her unresponding face. Either she was daydreaming, and far away, or she simply had not heard him. Or, he thought, the name of Michael Milton was already on her mind, so that when Garp uttered it, it was the name that she was already saying\x{2014}to herself\x{2014}and she had not noticed that Garp had spoken it.",

            "Running my five miles a day, I frequently encounter some smart-mouthed motorist who will pull alongside me and ask (from the safety of the driver's seat), \"What are you in training for?\"
Deep and regular breathing is the secret; I am rarely out of breath; I never pant or gasp when I respond. \"I am staying in shape to chase cars,\" I say.
At this point the responses of the motorists vary; there are degrees of stupidity as there are degrees of everything else. Of course, they never realize that I don't mean them\x{2014}I'm not staying in shape to chose their cars; not out on the open road, at least. I let them go out there, though I sometimes believe that I could catch them. And I do not run on the open road, as some motorists believe, to attract attention.
In my neighborhood there is no place to run. One must leave the suburbs to be even a middle-distance runner. Where I live there are four-way stop signs at every intersection; the blocks are short, and those tight-angle corners are hard on the balls of the feet. Also, the sidewalks are threatened by dogs, festooned with the playthings of children, intermittently splashed with lawn sprinklers. And just when there's some running room, there's an elderly person taking up the whole sidewalk, precarious on crutches or armed with quacking cones. With good conscience one does not yell \"Track!\" to such a person. Even passing the aged at a safe distance, but with my usual speed, seems to alarm them; and it's not my intention to cause heart attacks.
So it's the open road for training, but it's the suburbs I'm in training for. In my condition I am more than a match for a car caught speeding in my neighborhood. Provided they make an even half-hearted halt at the stop signs, they cannot hit over fifty before they have to brake for the next intersection. I always catch up to them. I can travel across lawns, over porches, through swing sets and the children's wading pools; I can burst through hedges, or hurdle them. And since my engine is quiet\x{2014}and steady, and always in tune\x{2014}I can hear if other cars are coming; I don't have to stop at the stop signs.
In the end I run them down, I wave them over; they always stop. Although I am clearly in impressive car-chasing condition, that is not what intimidates the speeders. No, they are almost always intimidated by my parenthood, because they are almost always young. Yes, my parenthood is what sobers them, almost every time. I begin simply. \"Did you see my children back there?\" I ask them, loudly and anxiously. Veteran speeders, upon being asked such a question, are immediately frightened that they have run over my children. They are instantly defensive.
\"I have two young children,\" I tell them. The drama is deliberate in my voice\x{2014}which, with this sentence, I allow to tremble a little. It is as if I am holding back tears, or unspeakable rage, or both. Perhaps they think I am hunting a kidnapper, or that I suspect them of being child molesters.
\"What happened?\" they invariably ask.
\"You didn't see my children, did you?\" I repeat. \"A little boy pulling a little girl in a red wagon?\" This is, of course, a fiction. I have two boys, and they're not so little; they have no wagon. They may have been watching television at the time, or riding their bikes in the park\x{2014}where it's safe, where there are no cars.
\"No,\" the bewildered speeder says. \"I saw children, some children. But I don't think I saw those children. Why?\"
\"Because you almost killed them,\" I say.
\"But I didn't see them!\" the speeder protests.
\"You were driving too fast to see them!\" I, say. This is sprung on them as if it were proof of their guilt; I always pronounce this sentence as if it were hard evidence. And they're never sure. I've rehearsed this part so well. The sweat from my hard sprint, by now, drips off my mustache and the point of my chin, streaking the driver's-side door. They know only a father who genuinely fears for his children would run so hard, would stare like such a maniac, would wear such a cruel mustache.
\"I'm sorry,\" they usually say.
\"This is a neighborhood full of children,\" I always tell them. \"You have other places you can drive fast, don't you? Please, for the children's sake, don't speed here anymore.\" My voice, now, is never nasty; it is always beseeching. But they see that a restrained fanatic resides behind my honest, watering eyes.
Usually it's just a young kid. Those kids have a need to dribble a little oil; they want to race the frantic pace of the music on their radios. And I don't expect to change their ways. I only hope they'll do it somewhere else. I concede that the open road is theirs; when I train there, I keep my place. I run in the stuff of the soft shoulder, in the hot sand and gravel, in the beer-bottle glass\x{2014}among the mangled cats, the maimed birds, the mashed condoms. But in my neighborhood, the car is not king; not yet.
Usually they learn.
After my five-mile run I do fifty-five push-ups, then five hundred-yard dashes, followed by fifty-five situps, followed by fifty-five neck bridges. It's not that I care so much for the number five; it's simply that strenuous and mindless exertion is easier if one doesn't have to keep track of too many different numbers. After my shower (<<about five o'clock|6>>), through the late afternoon, and in the course of the evening, I allow myself five beers.
I do not chase cars at night. Children should not be playing outside at night\x{2014}in my neighborhood, or in any other neighborhood. At night, I believe, the car is king of the whole modern world. Even the suburbs.
At night, in fact, I rarely leave my house, or allow the members of my family to venture out. But once I went to investigate an obvious accident\x{2014}the darkness suddenly streaked with headlights pointing straight up and exploding; the silence pierced with a metal screaming and the shriek of ground glass. Only half a block away, in the dark and perfect middle of my street, a Land Rover lay upsidedown and bleeding its oil and gas in a puddle so deep and still I could see the moon in it. The only sound: the ping of heat in the hot pipes and the dead engine. The Land Rover looked like a tank tumbled by a land mine. Great juts and tears in the pavement revealed that the auto had rolled over and over before coming to rest here.
The driver's-side door could be opened only slightly, but enough to miraculously turn on the door light. There in the lit cab, still behind the steering wheel\x{2014}still upside-down and still alive\x{2014}was a fat man. He looked unharmed. The top of his head rested gingerly on the ceiling of the cab, which of course was now the floor, but the man seemed only dimly sensitive to this change in his perspective. He looked puzzled, chiefly, by the presence of a large brown bowling ball that sat alongside his head, like another head; he was, in fact, cheek to cheek with this bowling ball, which he perhaps felt touching him as he might have felt the presence of a lover's severed head\x{2014}formerly resting on his shoulder.
\"is that you, Roger?\" the man asked. I couldn't tell whether he was addressing me or the bowling ball.
\"It is not Roger,\" I said, answering for us both.
\"That Roger is a moron,\" the man explained. \"We crossed our balls.\"
That the fat man was referring to a bizarre sexual experience seemed unlikely. I assumed that the fat man referred to bowling.
\"This is Roger's ball,\" he explained, indicating the brown globe against his cheek. \"I should have known it wasn't my ball because it wouldn't fit in my bag. My ball will fit in anyone's bag, but Roger's ball is really strange. I was trying to fit it in my bag when the Land Rover went off the bridge.\"
Although I knew there was no bridge in my entire neighborhood, I tried to visualize the occurrence. But I was distracted by the gurgle of spilling gasoline, like beer down a thirsty man's throat.
\"You should get out,\" I told the upside-down bowler.
\"I'll wait for Roger,\" he replied. \"Roger will be right along.\"
And sure enough, along come another Land Rover, as if they were a separated twosome from a column of an army on the move. Roger's Land Rover come along with its headlights out and did not stop in time; it plowed into the fat bowler's Land Rover and together, like coupled boxcars, they jarred each other another tough ten yards down the street.
It appeared that Roger was a moron, but I merely asked him the expected question: \"Is that you, Roger?\"
\"Yup,\" said the man, whose throbbing Land Rover was dark and creaking; little fragments of its windshield and headlights and grille dropped to the street like noisy confetti.
\"That could only be Roger!\" groaned the fat bowler, still upside-down\x{2014}and still alive\x{2014}in his lit cab. I saw that his nose bled slightly; it appeared that the bowling ball had bashed him.
\"You moron, Roger!\" he called out. \"You've got my ball!\"
\"Well, someone's got my ball, then,\" Roger replied.
\"I've got your ball, you moron,\" the fat bowler declared.
\"Well, that's not the answer to everything,\" Roger said. \"You've got my Land Rover.\" Roger lit a cigarette in the blackened cab; he did not appear interested in climbing out of the wreck.
\"You should set up flares,\" I suggested to him, \"and that fat man should get out of your Land Rover. There's gasoline everywhere. I don't think you should smoke.\" But Roger only continued smoking and ignoring me in the cavelike silence of the second Land Rover, and the fat bowler again cried out\x{2014}as if he were having a dream that was starting over, at the beginning\x{2014}\"Is that you, Roger?\"
I went back to my house and called the police. In the daytime, in my neighborhood, I would never have tolerated such mayhem, but people who go bowling in each other's Land Rovers are not the usual suburban speeders, and I decided they were legitimately lost.
\"Hello, Police?\" I said.
I have learned what you can and what you can't expect of the police. I know that they do not really support the notion of citizen arrest; when I have reported speeders to them, the results have been disappointing. They don't seem interested in learning the details. I am told there are people whom the police are interested in apprehending, but I believe the police are basically sympathetic to speeders; and they do not appreciate citizens who make arrests for them.
I reported the whereabouts of the bowlers' accident, and when the police asked, as they always ask, who was calling, I told them, \"Roger.\"
That, I knew\x{2014}knowing the police\x{2014}would be interesting. The police are always more interested in bothering the person who reports the crime than they are interested in bothering the criminals. And sure enough, when they arrived, they went straight after Roger. I could see them all arguing under the streetlamps, but I could catch only snatches of their conversation.
\"He's Roger,\" the fat bowler kept saying. \"He's Roger through and through.\"
\"I'm not the Roger who called you fuckers,\" Roger told the police.
\"That's true,\" the fat bowler declared. \"This Roger wouldn't call the police for anything.\"
And after a while they began to call out into our dark suburb for another Roger. \"Is there another Roger here?\" one policeman called.
\"Roger!\" screamed the fat bowler, but my dark house and the dark houses of my neighbors were appropriately silent. In daylight, I knew, they would all be gone. Only their oil slicks and their broken glass would remain.
Relieved\x{2014}and, as always, pleased with the destruction of automotive vehicles\x{2014}I watched until almost dawn, when the hulking, coupled Land Rovers were finally separated and towed away. They were like two exhausted rhinos caught fornicating in the suburbs. Roger and the fat bowler stood arguing, and swinging their bowling balls, until the streetlamps in our block were extinguished; then, as if on signal, the bowlers shook hands and departed in different directions\x{2014}on foot, and as if they knew where they were going.
The police came interrogating in the morning, still concerned with the possibility of another Roger. But they learned nothing from me\x{2014}just as they learn nothing, apparently, whenever I report a speeder to them. \"Well, if it happens again,\" they tell me, \"be sure to let us know.\"
Fortunately, I have rarely needed the police; I am usually effective with first offenders. Only once have I had to stop the same driver\x{2014}and him, only twice. He was an arrogant young man in a blood-red plumber's truck. Lurid-yellow lettering advertised on the cab that the plumber handled Roto-Rootering needs and all plumbing services:",

            "With two-time offenders I come more quickly to the point.
\"I'm calling the cops,\" I told the young man. \"And I'm calling your boss, old O. Fecteau; I should have called him the lost time.\"
\"I'm my own boss,\" the young man said. \"It's my plumbing business. Fuck off.\"
And I realized I was facing O. Fecteau himself\x{2014}a runty but successful youth, unimpressed with standard authority.
\"There are children in this neighborhood,\" I said. \"Two of them are mine.\"
\"Yeah, you already told me,\" the plumber said; he revved his engine as if he were clearing his throat. There was a hint of menace in his expression, like the trace of pubic beard he was growing on his young chin. I rested my hands on the door\x{2014}one on the handle, one on the rolled-down window.
\"Please don't speed here,\" I said.
\"Yeah, I'll try,\" said O. Fecteau. I might have let it go at that, but the plumber lit a cigarette and smiled at me. I thought I saw on his punk's face the leer of the world.
\"If I catch you driving like that again,\" I said, \"I'll stick your Roto-Rooter up your ass.\"
We stared at each other, O. Fecteau and I. Then the plumber gunned his engine and popped his clutch; I had to leap back to the curb. In the gutter I saw a little metal dump truck, a child's toy; the front wheels were missing. I snatched it up and ran after O. Fecteau. Five blocks later I was close enough to throw the dump truck, which struck the plumber's cab; it made a good noise but it bounced off harmlessly. Even so, O. Fecteau slammed on his brakes; <<about five|9:1>> long pipes were flipped out of the pickup part of the truck, and one of those metal drawers sprang open, disgorging a screwdriver and several spools of heavy wire. The plumber jumped down from his cab, banging the door after himself; he had a Stillson wrench in his hand. You could tell he was sensitive about collecting dents on his blood-red truck. I grabbed one of the fallen pipes: It was about five feet long and I quickly smashed the truck's left taillight with it. For some time now, things have just been coming naturally to me in fives. For example, the circumference, in inches, of my chest (expanded): fiftyfive.
\"Your taillight's broken,\" I pointed out to the plumber. \"You shouldn't be driving around that way.\"
\"I'm going to call the cops on you, you crazy bastard!\" said O. Fecteau.
\"This is a citizen arrest,\" I said. \"You broke the speed limit, you're endangering the lives of my children. We'll go see the cops together.\" And I poked the long pipe under the truck's rear license plate and folded the plate like a letter.
\"You touch my truck again,\" the plumber said, \"and you're in trouble.\" But the pipe felt as light in my hands as a badminton rocket; I swung it easily and shattered the other taillight.
\"You're already in trouble,\" I pointed out to O. Fecteau. \"You ever drive in this neighborhood again, you better stay in first gear and use your flasher.\" First, I knew (swinging the pipe), he would need to repair his flasher.
There was an elderly woman, just then, who came out of her house to observe the commotion. She recognized me immediately. I catch up to a lot of people at her corner. \"Oh, good for you!\" she called. I smiled to her and she tattered toward me, stopping and peering into her well-groomed lawn where the toy dump truck arrested her attention. She seized it, with obvious distaste, and carried it over to me. I put the toy and the pieces of broken glass and plastic from the taillights and the flasher into the back of the pickup. It is a clean neighborhood; I despise litter. On the open road, in training, I see nothing but litter. I put the other pipes in back, too, and with the long pipe I still held (like a warrior's javelin) I nudged the screwdriver and the spools of wire that had fallen by the curb. O. Fecteau gathered them up and returned them to the metal drawer. He is probably a better plumber than a driver, I thought; the Stillson wrench looked very comfortable in his hand.
\"You should be ashamed of yourself,\" the old woman told O. Fecteau. The plumber glared at her.
\"He's one of the worst ones,\" I told her.
\"Imagine that,\" the old lady said. \"And you're a big boy,\" she told the plumber. \"You should know better.\"
O. Fecteau edged back to the cab, looking as if he would hurl his wrench at me, then leap into his truck and back over the old biddy.
\"Drive carefully,\" I told him. When he was safely in the cab, I slid the long pipe into the pickup. Then I took the old woman's arm and helped her along the sidewalk.
When the truck tore away from the curb, with that stink of scorched rubber and a noise as raw as bones leaving their sockets, I felt the old lady tremble through the frail point of her elbow; something of her fear passed into me, and I realized how risky it was to make anyone as angry as I had made O. Fecteau. I could hear him, maybe five blocks away, driving furiously fast, and I prayed for all the dogs and cats and children who might be near the street. Surely, I thought, modern life is about five times as difficult as life used to be.
I should stop this crusade against speeders, I thought. I go too far with them, but they make me so angry\x{2014}with their carelessness, their dangerous, sloppy way of life, which I view as so directly threatening to my own life and the lives of my children. I have always hated cars, and hated people who drove them stupidly. I feel such anger toward people who take such risks with other people's lives. Let them race their cars\x{2014}but in the desert! We would not allow an outdoor rifle range in the suburbs! Let them jump out of airplanes, if they want\x{2014}but over the ocean! Not where my children live.
\"What would this neighborhood be like without you?\" the old woman wondered aloud. I can never remember her name. Without me, I thought, this neighborhood would probably be peaceful. Perhaps deadlier, but peaceful. \"They all drive so fast,\" the old lady said. \"If it weren't for you, I sometimes think they'd be having their smashups right in my living room.\" But I felt embarrassed that I shared such anxiety with eighty-year-olds\x{2014}that my fears are more like their nervous, senile worries than they are the normal anxieties of people my own young middle age.
What an incredibly dull life I have! I thought, aiming the old woman toward her front door, steering her over the cracks in the sidewalk.
Then the plumber came back. I thought the old woman was going to die in my arms.
The plumber drove over the curb and hurtled past us, over the old woman's lawn, flattening a whiplike young tree and nearly rolling over when he wheeled the truck into a U-turn that uprooted a sizable hedge and tore divots from the ground the size of fivepound steaks. Then down to the sidewalk the truck fled\x{2014}an explosion of tools flying free of the pickup as the rear wheels jounced over the curb. O. Fecteau was off up the street, once more terrorizing my neighborhood; I saw the violent plumber jump the curb again at the corner of Dodge and Furlong\x{2014}where he grazed the back of a parked car, springing open the car's trunk on impact and leaving it flapping.
Helping the shaken old lady inside, I called the police\x{2014}and my wife, to tell her to keep the children indoors. The plumber was berserk. This is how I help the neighborhood, I thought: I drive mad men madder.
The old woman sat in a paisley chair in her cluttered living room, as carefully as a plant. When O. Fecteau returned\x{2014}this time driving within inches of the living room bay window, and through the gravel beds for the baby trees, his horn blaring\x{2014}the old woman never moved. I stood at the door, awaiting the ultimate assault, but I thought it wiser not to show myself. I knew that if O. Fecteau saw me, he would attempt to drive in the house.
By the time the police arrived, the plumber had rolled his truck in an attempt to avoid a station wagon at the intersection of Cold Hill and North Lane. He had broken his collarbone and was sitting upright in the cab, though the truck lay on its side; he wasn't able to climb out the door above his head, or he hadn't tried. O. Fecteau appeared calm; he was listening to his radio.
Since that time, I have tried to provoke the offending drivers less; if I sense them taking offense at my stopping them and presuming to criticize their vile habits, I simply tell them I am informing the police and quickly leave.
That O. Fecteau turned out to have a long history of violent over-reactions to social situations did not allow me to forgive myself. \"Look, it's all the better you got that plumber off the road,\" my wife told me\x{2014}and she usually criticizes my meddlesomeness in the behavior of others. But I could only think that I had driven a workingman off his rocker, and that during his outburst, if O. Fecteau had killed a child, whose fault would it have been? Partly mine, I think.
In modern times, in my opinion, either everything is a moral question or there are no more moral questions. Nowadays, there are no compromises or there are only compromises. Never influenced, I keep my vigil. There is no letting up.",

            "HOPE STANDISH was at home with her son, Nicky, when Oren Rath walked into the kitchen. She was drying the dishes and she saw immediately the long, thin-bladed fisherman's knife with the slick cutting edge and the special, saw-toothed edge that they call a disgorger-scaler. Nicky was not yet three; he still ate in a high chair, and he was eating his breakfast when Oren Rath stepped up behind him and nudged the ripper teeth of his fisherman's knife against the child's throat.
\"Set them dishes aside,\" he told Hope. Mrs. Standish did as she was told. Nicky gurgled at the stranger; the knife was just a tickle under his chin.
\"What do you want?\" Hope asked. \"I'll give you anything you want.\"
\"You sure will,\" said Oren Rath. \"What's your name?\"
\"Hope.\"
\"Mine's Oren.\"
\"That's a nice name,\" Hope told him.
Nicky couldn't turn in the high chair to see the stronger who was tickling his throat. He had wet cereal on his fingers, and when he reached for Oren Rath's hand, Rath stepped up beside the high chair and touched the fine, slicing edge of his fisherman's blade to the fleshy pouch of the boy's cheek. He made a quick cut there, as if he were briefly outlining the child's cheekbone. Then he stepped back to observe Nicky's surprised face, his simple cry; a thread thin line of blood appeared, like the stitching for a pocket, on the boy's cheek. It was as if the child had suddenly developed a gill.
\"I mean business,\" said Oren Rath. Hope started toward Nicky but Rath waved her back. \"He don't need you. He just don't care for his cereal. He wants a cookie.\" Nicky bowled.
\"He'll choke on it, when he's crying,\" Hope said.
\"You want to argue with me?\" said Oren Rath. \"You want to talk about choking? I'll cut his pecker off and stuff it down his throat\x{2014}if you want to talk about choking.\"
Hope gave Nicky a zwieback and he stopped crying.
\"You see?\" said Oren Rath. He picked up the high chair with Nicky in it and hugged it to his chest. \"We're going to the bedroom now,\" he said; he nodded to Hope. \"You first.\"
They went down the hall together. The Standish family lived in a ranch house then; with a new baby, they had agreed ranch houses were safer in the case of a fire. Hope went into the bedroom and Oren Rath put down the high chair with Nicky in it, just outside the bedroom door. Nicky had almost stopped bleeding; there was just a little blood on his cheek; Oren Rath wiped this off with his hand, then wiped his hand on his pants. Then he stepped into the bedroom after Hope. When he closed the door, Nicky started to cry.
\"Please,\" Hope said. \"He really might choke, and he knows how to get out of that high chair\x{2014}or it might tip over. He doesn't like to be alone.\"
Oren Rath went to the night table and slashed through the phone cord with his fisherman's knife as easily as a man halving a very ripe pear. \"You don't want to argue with me,\" he said.
Hope sat down on the bed. Nicky was crying, but not hysterically; it sounded as if he might stop. Hope started crying, too.
\"Just take off your clothes,\" Oren said. He helped her undress. He was tall and reddish-blond, his hair as lank and as close to his head as high grass beaten down by a flood. He smelled like silage and Hope remembered the turquoise pickup she'd noticed in the driveway, just before he appeared in her kitchen. \"You've even got a rug in the bedroom,\" he said to her. He was thin but muscular; his hands were large and clumsy, like the feet of a puppy who's going to be a big dog. His body seemed almost hairless, but he was so pale, so very blond, that his hair was hard to see against his skin.
\"Do you know my husband?\" Hope asked him.
\"I know when he's home and when he ain't,\" Rath said. \"Listen,\" he said suddenly; Hope held her breath. \"You hear? Your kid don't even mind it.\" Nicky was murmuring vowel sounds outside the bedroom door, talking wetly to his zwieback. Hope began crying harder. When Oren Rath touched her, awkward and fast, she thought she was so dry that she wouldn't even get big enough for his horrible finger.
\"Please wait,\" she said.
\"No arguing with me.\"
\"No, I mean I can help you,\" she said. She wanted him in and out of her as fast as possible; she was thinking of Nicky in the high chair in the hall. \"I can make it nicer, I mean,\" she said, unconvincingly; she did not know how to say what she was saying. Oren Rath grabbed one of her breasts in such a way that Hope knew he had never touched a breast before; his hand was so cold, she flinched. In his awkwardness, he butted her in the mouth with the top of his head.
\"No arguing,\" he grunted.
\"Hope!\" someone called. They both heard it and froze. Oren Rath gaped at the cut phone cord.
\"Hope?\"
It was Margot, a neighbor and a friend. Oren Rath touched the cool, flat blade of his knife to Hope's nipple.
\"She's going to walk right in here,\" Hope whispered. \"She's a good friend.\"
\"My God, Nicky,\" they could hear Margot say, \"I see you're eating all over the house. Is your mother getting dressed?\"
\"I'll have to fuck you both and kill everybody,\" whispered Oren Rath. Hope scissored his waist with her good legs and hugged him, knife and all, to her breasts. \"Margot!\" she screamed. \"Grab Nicky and run! Please!\" she shrieked. \"There's a crazy man who's going to kill us all! Take Nicky, take Nicky!\"
Oren Rath lay stiffly against her as if it were the first time he'd ever been hugged. He did not struggle, he did not use his knife. They both lay rigid and listened to Margot dragging Nicky down the hall and out the kitchen door. One leg of the high chair was snapped off against the refrigerator, but Margot didn't stop to remove Nicky from the chair until she was half a block down the street and kicking open her own door. \"Don't kill me,\" Hope whispered. \"Just go, quickly, and you'll get away. She's calling the police, right now.\"
\"Get dressed,\" said Oren Rath. \"I ain't had you yet, and I'm going to.\" Where he'd butted her with the oval crown of his head, he had split her lip against her teeth and made her bleed. \"I mean business,\" he repeated, but uncertainly. He was as rough-boned and graceless as a young steer. He made her put her dress on without any underwear, he shoved her barefoot down the hall, carrying his boots under his arm. Hope didn't realize until she was beside him in the pickup that he had put on one of her husband's flannel shirts.
\"Margot has probably written down the license number of this truck,\" she told him. She turned the rear-view mirror so that she could see herself; she dabbed at her split lip with the broad, floppy collar of her dress. Oren Rath stiff-armed her in the ear, rapping the far side of her head off the passenger door of the cab.
\"I need that mirror to see,\" he said. \"Don't mess around or I'll really hurt you.\" He'd taken her bra with him and he used it to tie her wrists to the thick, rusty hinges of the glove-compartment door, which gaped open at her.
He drove as if he were in no special hurry to get out of town. He did not seem impatient when he got stuck at the long traffic light near the university. He watched all the pedestrians crossing the street; he shook his head and clucked his tongue when he saw how some of the students were dressed. Hope could see her husband's office window from where she sat in the truck's cab, but she didn't know if he would be in his office or actually, at that moment, teaching a class.
In fact, he was in his office\x{2014}four floors up. Dorsey Standish looked out his window and saw the lights change; the traffic was allowed to flow, the hordes of marching students were temporarily restrained at the gates to the crosswalks. Dorsey Standish liked watching traffic. There are many foreign and flashy cars in a university town, but here these cars were contrasted with the vehicles of the natives: farmers' trucks, slat-sided conveyors of pigs and cattle, strange harvesting machinery, everything muddy from the farms and county roads. Standish knew nothing about farms, but he was fascinated by the animals and the machines\x{2014}especially the dangerous, baffling vehicles. There went one, now, with a chute\x{2014}for what?\x{2014}and a latticework of cables that pulled or suspended something heavy. Standish liked to try to visualize how everything worked.
Below him a lurid turquoise pickup moved ahead with the traffic; its fenders were pockmarked, its grille bashed in and black with mashed flies and\x{2014}Standish imagined\x{2014}the heads of imbedded birds. In the cab beside the driver Dorsey Standish thought he saw a pretty woman\x{2014}some thing about her hair and profile reminded him of Hope, and a flash of the woman's dress struck him as a color his wife liked to wear. But he was four floors up; the truck was past him, and the cab's rear window was so thickly caked with mud that he couldn't glimpse more of her. Besides, it was time for his <<nine-thirty|5k:1>> class. Dorsey Standish decided it was unlikely that a woman riding in such an ugly truck would be at all pretty.
\"I bet your husband is screwing his students all the time,\" said Oren Rath. His big hand, with the knife, lay in Hope's lap.
\"No, I don't think so,\" Hope said.
\"Shit, you don't know nothing,\" he said. \"I'm going to fuck you so good you won't even want it to stop.\"
\"I don't care what you do,\" Hope told him. \"You can't hurt my baby now.\"
\"I can do things to you,\" said Oren Rath. \"Lots of things.\"
\"Yes. You mean business,\" Hope said, mockingly.
They were driving into the farm country. Rath didn't say anything for a while. Then he said, \"I'm not as crazy as you think.\"
\"I don't think you're crazy at all,\" Hope lied. \"I think you're just a dumb, horny kid who's never been laid.\"
Oren Rath must have felt at this moment that his advantage of terror was slipping away from him, fast. Hope was seeking any advantage she might find, but she didn't know if Oren Rath was sane enough to be humiliated.
They turned off the county road, up a long dirt driveway toward a farmhouse whose windows were blurred with plastic insulation; the scruffy lawn was strewn with tractor parts and other metal trash. The mailbox said: R, R, W, E and O RATH.
These Raths were not related to the famous sausage Raths, but it appeared that they were pig farmers. Hope saw a series of outbuildings, gray and slanted with rusted roofs. On the ramp by the brown barn a full-grown sow lay on her side, breathing with difficulty; beside the pig were two men who looked to Hope like mutants of the same mutation that had produced Oren Rath.
\"I want the black truck, now,\" Oren said to them. \"People are out looking for this one.\" He used his knife matter-of-factly to slice through the bra that bound Hope's wrists to the glove compartment.
\"Shit,\" one of the men said.
The other man shrugged; he had a red blotch on his face\x{2014}a kind of birthmark, which was the color and nubbled surface of a raspberry. In fact, that is what his family called him: Raspberry Roth. Fortunately, Hope didn't know this.
They had not looked at Oren or at Hope. The hard-breathing sow shattered the barnyard calm with a rippling fart. \"Shit, there she goes again,\" the man without the birthmark said; except for his eyes, his face was more or less normal. His name was Weldon.
Raspberry Rath read the label on a brown bottle he held out toward the pig like a drink: \"\"May produce excessive gas and flatulence\", it says.\"
\"Don't say anything about producing a pig like this,\" Weldon said.
\"I need the black truck,\" Oren said.
\"Well, the key's in it, Oren,\" said Weldon Rath. \"If you think you can manage by yourself.\"
Oren Rath shoved Hope toward the black pickup. Raspberry was holding the bottle of pig medicine and staring at Hope when she said to him, \"He's kidnapping me. He's going to rape me. The police ate already looking for him.\"
Raspberry kept staring at Hope, but Weldon turned to Oren. \"I hope you ain't doing nothing too stupid,\" he said.
\"I ain't,\" Oren said. The two men now turned their total attention to the pig.
\"I'd wait another hour and then give her another squirt,\" Raspberry said. \"Ain't we seen enough of the vet this week?\" He scratched the mud-smeared neck of the sow with the toe of his boot; the sow farted.
Oren led Hope behind the barn where the corn spilled out of the silo. Some piglets, barely bigger than kittens, were playing in it. They scattered when Oren started the black pickup. Hope started to cry.
\"Are you going to let me go?\" she asked Oren.
\"I ain't had you yet,\" he said.
Hope's bare feet were cold and black with the spring muck. \"My feet hurt,\" she said. \"Where are we going?\"
She'd seen an old blanket in the back of the pickup, matted and flecked with straw. That's where she imagined she was going: into the cornfields, then spread on the spongy spring ground\x{2014}and when it was over and her throat was slit, and she'd been disemboweled with the fisherman's knife, he'd wrap her up in the blanket that was lumped stiffly on the floor of the pickup as if it covered some stillborn livestock.
\"I got to find a good place to have you,\" said Oren Rath. \"I would of kept you at home, but I'd of had to share you.\"
Hope Standish was trying to figure out the foreign machinery of Oren Rath. He did not work like the human beings she was accustomed to. \"What you're doing is wrong,\" she said.
\"No, it isn't,\" he said. \"It ain't.\"
\"You're going to rape me,\" Hope said. \"That's wrong.\"
\"I just want to have you,\" he said. He hadn't bothered to tie her to the glove compartment this time. There was nowhere she could go. They were driving only on those mile-long plots of county roads, driving slowly west in little squares, the way a knight advances on a chessboard: one square ahead, two sideways, one sideways, two ahead. It seemed purposeless to Hope, but then she wondered if he didn't know the roads so very well that he knew how to cover a considerable distance without ever passing through a town. They saw only the signposts for towns, and although they couldn't have moved more than thirty miles from the university, she didn't recognize any of the names: Coldwater, Hills, Fields, Plainview. Maybe they aren't towns, she thought, but only crude labels for the natives who lived here\x{2014}identifying the land for them, as if they didn't know the simple words for the things they saw every day.
\"You don't have any right to do this to me,\" Hope said.
\"Shit,\" he said. He pumped his brakes hard, throwing her forward against the truck's solid dashboard. Her forehead bounced off the windshield, the back of her hand was mashed against her nose. She felt something like a small muscle or a very light bone give way in her chest. Then he tromped on the accelerator and tossed her back into the seat. \"I hate arguing,\" he said.
Her nose bled; she sat with her head forward, in her hands, and the blood dripped on her thighs. She sniffed a little; the blood dripped over her lip and filmed her teeth. She tipped her head back so that she could taste it. For some reason, it calmed her\x{2014}it helped her to think. She knew there was a rapidly blueing knot on her forehead, swelling under her smooth skin. When she ran her hand up to her face and touched the lump, Oren Rath looked at her and laughed. She spit at him\x{2014}a thin phlegm laced pink with blood. It caught his cheek and ran down to the collar of her husband's flannel shirt. His hand, as flat and broad as the sole of a boot, reached for her hair. She grabbed his forearm with both her hands, she jerked his wrist to her mouth and bit into the soft part where the hairs don't always grow and the blue tubes carry the blood.
She meant to kill him in this impossible way but she barely had time to break the skin. His arm was so strong that he snapped her body upright and across his lap. He pushed the back of her neck against the steering wheel\x{2014}the horn blew through her head\x{2014}and he broke her nose with the heel of his left hand. Then he returned that hand to the wheel. He cradled her head with his right hand, holding her face against his stomach; when he felt that she wasn't struggling, he let her head rest on his thigh. His hand lightly cupped her ear, as if to hold the sound of the horn inside her. She kept her eyes shut against the pain in her nose.
He made several left turns, more right turns. Each turn, she knew, meant they had driven one mile. His hand now cupped the back of her neck. She could hear again, and she felt his fingers working their way into her hair. The front of her face felt numb.
\"I don't want to kill you,\" he said.
\"Don't, then,\" Hope said.
\"Got to,\" Oren Rath told her. \"After we do it, I'll have to.\"
This affected her like the taste of her own blood. She knew he didn't care for arguing. She saw that she had lost a step: her rape. He was going to do it to her. She had to consider that it was done. What mattered now was living; she knew that meant outliving him. She knew that meant getting him caught, or getting him killed, or killing him.
Against her cheek, she felt the change in his pocket; his blue jeans were soft and sticky with farm dust and machine grease. His belt buckle dug into her forehead; her lips touched the oily leather of his belt. The fisherman's knife was kept in a sheath, she knew. But where was the sheath? She couldn't see it; she didn't dare to hunt for it with her hands. Suddenly, against her eye, she felt his penis stiffening. She felt then\x{2014}for really the first time\x{2014}almost paralyzed, panicked beyond helping herself, no longer able to sort out the priorities. Once again, it was Oren Rath who helped her.
\"Look at it this way,\" he said. \"Your kid got away. I was going to kill the kid, too, you know.\"
The logic of Oren Rath's peculiar version of sanity made everything sharpen for Hope; she heard the other cars. There were not many, but every few minutes or so there was a car passing. She wished she could see, but she knew they were not as isolated as they had been. Now, she thought, before he gets to where we're going\x{2014}if he even knows where we're going. She thought he did. At least, before he gets off this road\x{2014}before I'm somewhere, again, where there aren't any people.
Oren Rath shifted in his seat. His erection was making him uncomfortable. Hope's warm face in his lap, his hand in her hair, was reaching him. Now, Hope thought. She moved her cheek against his thigh, just slightly; he did not stop her. She moved her face in his lap as if she were making herself more comfortable, against a pillow\x{2014}against his prick, she knew. She moved until the bulge under his rank pants rose untouched by her face. But she could reach it with her breath; it stuck up out of his lap near her mouth, and she began to breathe on it. It hurt too much to breathe out of her nose. She drew her lips into an O-shaped kiss, she focused her breathing, and, very softly, she blew.
Oh, Nicky, she thought. And Dorsey, her husband. She would see them again, she hoped. To Oren Rath she gave her warm, careful breath. On him she focused her one, cold thought: I'm going to get you, you son of a bitch.",

            "In the helicopter, shuddering above the black truck, Arden Bensenhaver barked into the megaphone. He was sure that Mrs. Standish was dead. He could not tell the sex of the feet he saw protruding from the open door of the cab, but the feet hadn't moved during the helicopter's descent, and they seemed so naked and drained of any color in the sunlight that Bensenhaver was sure that they were dead feet. That Oren Rath could be the one who was dead had not crossed the deputy's or Bensenhaver's mind.
But they couldn't understand why Rath would have abandoned the truck, after performing his foul acts, and so Bensenhaver had told the pilot to hold the helicopter just above the pickup. \"if he's still in there with her,\" Bensenhaver told the deputy, \"maybe we can scare the bastard to death.\"
When Hope Standish brushed between those stiff feet and huddled alongside the cab, trying to shield her eyes from the flying sand, Arden Bensenhaver felt his finger go limp against the trigger of the megaphone. Hope tried to wrap her face in her flapping dress but it snapped around her like a torn sail; she felt her way along the truck toward the tailgate, cringing against the stinging gravel that clung to the places on her body where the blood hadn't quite dried.
\"It's the woman,\" the deputy said.
\"Back off!\" Bensenhaver told the pilot.
\"Jesus, what happened to her?\" the deputy asked, frightened. Bensenhaver roughly handed him the megaphone.
\"Move away\" he said to the pilot. \"Set this thing down across the road.\" Hope felt the wind shift, and the clamor in the tornado's funnel seemed to pass over her. She kneeled at the side of the road. Her wild dress quieted in her hands. She held it to her mouth because the dust was choking her.
A car come along, but Hope was unaware of it. The driver passed in the proper lane\x{2014}the black pickup off the road to his right, the helicopter settling down off the road to his left. The bloody, praying woman, naked and caked with grit, took no notice of him driving past her. The driver had a vision of an angel on a trip back from hell. The driver's reaction was so delayed that he was a hundred yards beyond everything he'd seen before he surprisingly attempted a U-turn in the road. Without slowing down. His front wheels caught the soft shoulder and slithered him across the road ditch and into the soft spring earth of a plowed bean field, where his car sank up to his bumpers and he could not open his door. He rolled down his window and peered across the mire to the road\x{2014}like a man who'd been sitting peacefully on a dock when the dock broke free from the shore, and he was drifting out to sea.
\"Help!\" he cried. The vision of the woman had so terrified him that he feared there might be more like her around, or that whoever had made her look that way might be in search of another victim.
\"Jesus Christ,\" said Arden Bensenhaver to the pilot, \"you'll have to go see if that fool is all right. Why do they let everyone drive a car?\" Bensenhaver and the deputy dropped out of the helicopter and into the same lush muck that had trapped the driver. \"Goddamnit,\" Bensenhaver said.
\"Mother,\" said the deputy.
Across the road, Hope Standish looked up at them for the first time. Two swearing men were wallowing toward her out of a muddy field. The blades of the helicopter were slowing down. There was also a man peeping witlessly out the window of his car, but that seemed far away. Hope stepped into her dress. One armhole, where a sleeve had been, was torn open and Hope had to pin a flap of material to her side with her elbow, or else leave her breast exposed. It was then that she noticed how sore her shoulders and her neck were.
Arden Bensenhaver, out of breath and soaked with mud from his knees down, was in front of her suddenly. The mud made his trousers hug his legs so that, to Hope, he looked like an old man wearing knickers. \"Mrs. Standish?\" he asked. She turned her back to him and hid her face, nodding. \"So much blood,\" he said, helplessly. \"I'm sorry we took so long. Are you hurt?\"
She turned and stared at him. He saw the swelling around both eyes and her broken nose\x{2014}and the blue bulge on her forehead. \"It's mostly his blood,\" she said. \"But I was raped. He did it,\" she told Bensenhaver.
Bensenhaver had his handkerchief out; he seemed about to dab at her face with it, as he might wipe the mouth of a child, but then he despaired at what a job it would be to clean her up and he put his handkerchief away. \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I'm so sorry. We got here as fast as we could. We saw your baby and he's fine,\" Bensenhaver said.
\"I had to put him in my mouth,\" Hope said to him. Bensenhaver shut his eyes. \"And then he fucked me and fucked me,\" she said. \"He was going to kill me, later\x{2014}he told me he would. I had to kill him. And I'm not sorry.\"
\"Of course you're not,\" Bensenhaver said. \"And you shouldn't be, Mrs. Standish. I'm sure you did the very best thing.\" She nodded her head to him, then stared down at her feet. She put one hand out toward Bensenhaver's shoulder and he let her lean against him, though she was slightly taller than Bensenhaver and in order to rest her head against him, she had to scrunch down.
Bensenhaver was aware of the deputy then; he had been to the cab to look at Oren Rath and had vomited all over the truck's front fender and in full view of the pilot who was walking the shocked driver of the stuck car across the road. The deputy, with his face the bloodless color of Oren Rath's sunlit feet, was imploring Bensenhaver to come see. But Bensenhaver wanted Mrs. Standish to feel every possible reassurance.
\"So you killed him after he raped you, when he was relaxed, not paying attention?\" he asked her.
\"No, during,\" she whispered against his neck. The awful reek of her almost got to Bensenhaver, but he kept his face very close to her, where he could hear her.
\"You mean, while he was raping you, Mrs. Standish?\"
\"Yes,\" she whispered. \"He was still inside me when I got his knife. It was in his pants, on the floor, and he was going to use it on me when he was finished, so I had to,\" she said.
\"Of course you did,\" Bensenhaver said. \"It doesn't matter.\" He meant that she should have killed him anyway\x{2014}even if he hadn't been planning to kill her. To Arden Bensenhaver there was no crime, as serious as rape\x{2014}not even murder, except perhaps the murder of a child. But he knew less about that; he had no children of his own.
He had been married seven months when his pregnant wife had been raped in a Laundromat while he waited outside for her in the car. Three kids had done it. They had opened one of the big spring-doored dryers and sat her ass on the open door, pushed her head into the warm dryer where she could only scream into the hot, muffling sheets and pillowcases and hear her own voice boom and bounce around the great metal drum. Her arms were in the dryer with her head, so she was helpless. Her feet couldn't even reach the floor. The spring door made her jounce up and down under all three of them, although she probably tried not to move. The boys had no idea, of course, that they were raping the police superintendent's wife. And all the bright lighting possible for downtown Toledo on a Saturday night would not have saved her.
They were an early-morning couple, the Bensenhavers. They were young still, and they took their laundry to the Laundromat together, Monday morning before breakfast; they read the newspapers during the wash cycle. Then they put their laundry in the dryer and went home and had breakfast. Mrs. Bensenhaver picked it up on her way downtown to the police station with Bensenhaver. He would wait in the car while she went inside to get it; sometimes, someone would have taken it out of the dryer while they were having breakfast and Mrs. Bensenhaver would have to run it for another few minutes. Bensenhaver then waited. But they liked the early morning because there was rarely anyone else in the Laundromat. Only when Bensenhaver saw the three kids leaving did he start to worry about how long his wife had been collecting the dry laundry. But it does not take very long to rape someone, even three times. Bensenhaver went into the Laundromat where he saw his wife's legs sticking out of the dryer; her shoes had fallen off. Those were not the first dead feet Bensenhaver had seen, but they were very important feet to him. She had suffocated in her own clean wash\x{2014}or she had vomited, and choked\x{2014}but they had not meant to kill her. That part had been an accident, and at the trial a great deal had been made of the unplanned nature of Mrs. Bensenhaver's death. Their attorney had said that the boys had planned \"to just rape her\x{2014}not kill her, too.\" And the phrase \"just rape\"\x{2014}as in \"She was just raped, lucky thing, a wonder she wasn't killed!\"\x{2014}appalled Arden Bensenhaver.
\"It's good that you killed him,\" Bensenhaver whispered to Hope Standish. \"We couldn't have done nearly enough to him,\" he confided to her. \"Nothing like he deserved. Good for you,\" he whispered. \"Good for you.\"
Hope had expected another sort of police experience, a more critical investigation\x{2014}at least, a more suspicious cop, and certainly a man very different from Arden Bensenhaver. She was so grateful, for one thing, that Bensenhaverwas an old man, clearly in his sixties\x{2014}like an uncle to her, or even more sexually remote: a grandfather. She said she felt better, that she was all right; when she straightened up and stood away from him, she saw she had smeared his shirt collar and his cheek with blood, but Bensenhaver hadn't noticed or didn't care.
\"Okay, show me,\" Bensenhaver said to the deputy, but again he smiled gently at Hope. The deputy led him to the open cab.
\"Oh, my God,\" the driver of the stuck car was saying. \"Dear Jesus, look at this, and what's that? Christ, look, I think that's his liver. Isn't that what a liver looks like?\" The pilot gawked in mute wonder and Bensenhaver caught both men by their coat shoulders and steered them roughly away. They started toward the rear of the truck, where Hope was composing herself, but Bensenhaver hissed at them, \"Stay away from Mrs. Standish. Stay away from the truck. Go radio our position,\" he told the pilot. \"They'll need an ambulance or something here. We'll take Mrs. Standish with us.\"
\"They'll need a plastic bag for him,\" said the deputy, pointing to Oren Rath. \"He's all over the place.\"
\"I can see with my own eyes,\" said Arden Bensenhaver. He looked inside the cab and whistled admiringly.
The deputy started to ask, \"Was he doing it when...\"
\"That's right,\" said Bensenhaver. He put his hand into a horrible mess by the accelerator pedal, but he didn't seem to mind. He was reaching for the knife on the floor of the passenger's side. He picked it up in his handkerchief; he looked it over carefully, wrapped it in the handkerchief, and put it in his pocket.
\"Look,\" the deputy whispered, conspiratorially. \"Did you ever hear of a rapist wearing a rubber?\"
\"It's not common,\" Bensenhaver said. \"But it's not unknown.\"
\"It's weird to me,\" said the deputy. He looked amazed as Bensenhaver pinched the prophylactic tight, just below its bulge; Bensenhaver snapped the rubber off and held it, without spilling a drop, up to the light. The sack was as large as a tennis ball, it hadn't leaked. It was full of blood.
Bensenhaver looked satisfied; he tied a knot in the condom, the way you'd knot a balloon, and he flung it so far into the bean field that it was out of sight.
\"I don't want someone suggesting that it might not have been a rape,\" Bensenhayer said softly to the deputy. \"Got it?\"
He didn't wait for the deputy to answer; Bensenhaver went to the back of the truck to be with Mrs. Standish.
\"How old was he\x{2014}that boy?\" Hope asked Bensenhaver.
\"Old enough,\" Bensenhaver told her. \"<<About twenty-five|9:1>> or twenty-six,\" he added. He did not want anything to diminish her survival\x{2014}particularly, in her own eyes. He waved to the pilot, who was to help Mrs. Standish aboard. Then he went to clear things with the deputy. \"You stay here with the body and the bad driver,\" he told him.
\"I'm not a bad driver,\" the driver whined. \"Christ, if you'd seen that lady there-in the road...\"
\"And keep anyone away from the truck,\" Bensenhaver said.
On the road was the shirt belonging to Mrs. Standish's husband; Bensenhaver picked it up and trotted to the helicopter in his funny, overweight way of running. The two men watched Bensenhaver climb aboard the helicopter and rise away from them. The weak spring sun seemed to leave with the copter and they were suddenly cold and didn't know where to go. Not in the truck, certainly, and sitting in the driver's car meant crossing that field of muck. They went to the pickup, lowered the tailgate, and sat on it.
\"Will he call a tow truck for my car?\" the driver asked.
\"He'll probably forget,\" the deputy said. He was thinking about Bensenhaver; he admired him, but he feared him, and he also thought that Bensenhaver was not to be totally trusted. There were questions of orthodoxy, if that's what it was, which the deputy had never considered. Mainly, the deputy just had too many things to think about at one time.
The driver paced back and forth in the pickup, which irritated the deputy because it jounced him on the tailgate. The driver avoided the foul, bunched blanket crammed in the corner next to the cab; he cleared a see-through spot on the dusted and caked rear window so that he could, occasionally, squint inside the cab at the rigid and disemboweled body of Oren Rath. All the blood was dry now, and through the mottled rear window the body looked to the driver to be similar, in color and in gloss, to an eggplant. He went and sat down on the tailgate beside the deputy, who got up, walked back in the truck, and peered in the window at the gashed corpse.
\"You know what?\" the driver said. \"Even though she was all messed up, you could tell what a really good-looking woman she was.\"
\"Yes, you could,\" the deputy agreed. The driver now paced around in the back of the truck with him, so the deputy went to the tailgate and sat down.
\"Don't get sore,\" the driver said.
\"I'm not sore,\" the deputy said.
\"I don't mean that I can sympathize with anyone who'd want to rape her, you know,\" the driver said.
\"I know what you don't mean,\" said the deputy.
The deputy knew he was over his head in these matters, but the simple-mindedness of the driver forced the deputy to adopt what he imagined was Bensenhayer's attitude of contempt for him.
\"You see a lot of this, huh?\" the driver asked. \"You know: rape and murder.\"
\"Enough,\" the deputy said with self-conscious solemnity. He had never seen a rape or murder before, and he realized that even now he had not actually seen it through his own eyes as much as he'd been treated to the experience through the eyes of Arden Bensenhaver. He had seen rape and murder according to Bensenhaver, he thought. The deputy felt very confused; he sought some point of view all his own.
\"Well\", said the driver, peering in the rear window again, \"I seen some stuff in the service, but nothing like this.\"
The deputy couldn't respond.
The World According to Bensenhaver
\"This is like war, I guess,\" the driver said. \"This is like a bad hospital.\"
The deputy wondered if he should let the fool look at Rath's body, if it mattered or not, and to whom? Certainly it couldn't matter to Rath. But to his unreal family? To the deputy?\x{2014}he didn't know. And would Bensenhaver object?
\"Hey, don't mind my asking you a personal question,\" the driver said. \"Don't get sore, okay?\"
\"Okay,\" said the deputy.
\"Well,\" the driver said. \"What happened to the rubber?\"
\"What rubber?\" asked the deputy; he might have had some questions concerning Bensenhaver's sanity, but the deputy had no doubt that, in this case, Bensenhaver had been right. In the world according to Bensenhaver, no trivial detail should make less of rape's outrage.",

            "There was a Fields line of nursing shoe, and Mr. Fields gave his daughter a free pair whenever she came home; Jenny must have had a dozen pairs. Mrs. Fields, who insisted on equating her daughter's leaving Wellesley with a sordid future, also gave Jenny a present every time she came home. Mrs. Fields gave her daughter a hot-water bottle, or so she said\x{2014}and so Jenny assumed; she never opened the packages. Her mother would say, \"Dear, do you still have that hot-water bottle I gave you?\" And Jenny would think a minute, believing she had left it on the train or thrown it away, and she'd say, \"I may have lost it, Mother, but I'm sure I don't need another one.\" And Mrs. Fields, bringing the package out from hiding, would press it on her daughter: it was still concealed in the drugstore paper. Mrs. Fields would say, \"Please, Jennifer, be more careful. And use it, please!\"
As a nurse, Jenny saw little use for the hot-water bottle; she assumed it to be a touching, odd device of old-fashioned and largely psychological comfort. But some of the packages made it back to her small room near Boston Mercy Hospital. She kept them in a closet, which was nearly full of boxes of nursing shoes\x{2014}also unopened.
She felt detached from her family, and thought it strange how they had lavished so much attention on her, as a child, and then at some appointed, prearranged time they seemed to stop the flow of affection and begin the expectations\x{2014}as if, for a brief phase, you were expected to absorb love (and get enough) and then, for a much longer and more serious phase you were expected to fulfill certain obligations. When Jenny had broken the chain, had left Wellesley for something as common as nursing, she had dropped her family\x{2014}and they, as if they couldn't help themselves, were in the process of dropping her. In the Fields family, for example, it would have been more appropriate if Jenny had become a doctor, or if she'd stayed in college until she married one. Each time she saw her brothers, her mother, and her father, they were more uncomfortable in one another's presence. They were involved in that awkward procedure of getting to unknow each other.
That must be how families are, thought Jenny Fields. She felt if she ever had children she would love them no less when they were twenty than when they were two; they might need you more at twenty, she thought. What do you really need when you're two? In the hospital, the babies were the easiest patients. The older they got, the more they needed; and the less anyone wanted or loved them.
Jenny felt she had grown up on a large ship without having seen, much less understood, the engine room. She liked how the hospital reduced everything to what one ate, if it helped one to have eaten it, and where it went. As a child she had never seen the dirty dishes; in fact, when the maids cleared the table, Jenny was sure they were throwing the dishes away (it was some time before she was even allowed in the kitchen). And when the milk truck brought the bottles every morning, for a while Jenny thought that the truck brought the day's dishes too\x{2014}the sound, that glassy clatter and bang, being so like the sound of the maids in the closed kitchen, doing whatever they did to the dishes.
Jenny Fields was five before she saw her father's bathroom. She tracked it down one morning by following the scent of her father's cologne. She found a steamy shower stall\x{2014}quite modern for 1925\x{2014}a private toilet, a row of bottles so unlike her mother's bottles that Jenny thought she had discovered the lair of a secret man living undetected in their house for years. In fact, she had.
In the hospital, Jenny knew where everything went and she was learning the unmagical answers to where almost everything came from. At Dog's Head Harbor, when Jenny had been a girl, the family members had their own baths, their own rooms, their own doors with their own mirrors on the backs. In the hospital, privacy was not sacred: nothing was a secret; if you wanted a mirror, you had to ask a nurse.
The most mysterious thing she had been allowed to investigate on her own, when Jenny was a child, had been the cellar and the great pottery crock which every Monday was filled with clams. Jenny's mother sprinkled cornmeal on the clams at night and every morning they were rinsed in fresh sea water from a long pipe that ran into the basement from the sea itself. By the weekend the clams were fat and free of sand, they were growing too big for their shells, and their great, obscene necks lolled on the salt water. Jenny would help the cook sort through them on Fridays; the dead ones did not retract their necks when touched.
Jenny asked for a book about clams. She read all about them: how they ate, how they bred, how they grew. It was the first live thing she understood completely\x{2014}its life, its sex, its death. At Dog's Head Harbor, human beings were not that accessible. In the hospital, Jenny Fields felt she was making up for lost time; she was discovering that people weren't much more mysterious, or much more attractive, than clams.
\"My mother,\" Garp wrote, \"was not one for making fine distinctions.\"
One striking difference she might have seen between clams and people was that most people had some sense of humor, but Jenny was not inclined toward humor. There was a popular joke among the nurses in Boston at that time, but it was not funny to Jenny Fields. The joke involved the other hospitals in Boston. The hospital Jenny worked in was Boston Mercy Hospital, which was called Boston Mercy; there was also Massachusetts General Hospital, which was called Mass General. And another hospital was the Peter Bent Brigham, which was called the Peter Bent.
One day, the joke goes, a Boston cab driver had his taxi hailed by a man who staggered off the curb toward him, almost dropping to his knees in the street. The man was purple in the face with pain; he was either strangling or holding his breath, so that talking was difficult for him, and the cabby opened the door and helped him inside, where the man lay face down on the floor alongside the back seat, tucking his knees up to his chest.
\"Hospital! Hospital!\" he cried.
\"The Peter Bent?\" the cabby asked. That was the closest hospital.
\"It's worse than bent,\" the man moaned. \"I think Molly bit it off!\"
Few jokes were funny to Jenny Fields, and certainly not this one; no peter jokes for Jenny, who was staying clear of the issue. She had seen the trouble peters could get into; babies were not the worst of it. Of course she saw people who didn't want to have babies, and they were sad that they were pregnant; they shouldn't have to have babies, Jenny thought\x{2014}though she mainly felt sorry for the babies who were born. She saw people who wanted to have babies, too, and they made her want to have one. One day, Jenny Fields though, she would like to have a baby\x{2014}just one. But the trouble was that she wanted as little to do with a peter as possible, and nothing whatsoever to do with a man.
Most peter treatment Jenny saw was done to soldiers. The U.S. Army would not begin to benefit from the discovery of penicillin until <<1943|9c:0>>, and there were many soldiers who didn't get penicillin until <<1945|9c:0>>. At Boston Mercy, in the early days of 1942, peters were usually treated with sulfa and arsenic. Sulfathiazole was for the clap\x{2014}with lots of water recommended. For syphilis, in the days before penicillin, they used neoarsphenamine; Jenny Fields thought that this was the epitome of all that sex could lead to\x{2014}to introduce arsenic into the human chemistry, to try to clean the chemistry up.
The other peter treatment was local and also required a lot of fluid. Jenny frequently assisted with this method of disinfecting, because the patient required lots of attention at the time; sometimes, in fact, he needed to be held. It was a simple procedure that could force as much as one hundred cc's of fluid up the penis and through the surprised urethra before it all came back, but the procedure left everyone feeling a bit raw. The man who invented a device for this method of treatment was named Valentine, and his device was called the Valentine irrigator. Long after Dr. Valentine's irrigator was improved, or replaced with another irrigation device, the nurses at Boston Mercy still referred to the procedure as the Valentine treatment\x{2014}an appropriate punishment for a lover, thought Jenny Fields.

            "\"Garp?\" Jenny whispered.
She unbuttoned the blouse of her dress and brought forth the breasts she had always considered too large. \"Garp?\" she whispered in his ear; his eyelids fluttered, his lips reached. Around them was a white shroud, a curtain on runners, which enclosed them in the ward. On one side of Garp was an External\x{2014}a flame-thrower victim, slippery with salve, swaddled in gauze. He had no eyelids, so it appeared he was always watching, but he was blind. Jenny took off her sturdy nurse's shoes, unfastened her white stockings, stepped out of her dress. She touched her finger to Garp's lips.
On the other side of Garp's white-shrouded bed was a Vital Organ patient on his way to becoming an Absentee. He had lost most of his lower intestine and his rectum; now a kidney was giving him trouble and his liver was driving him crazy. He had terrible nightmares that he was being forced to urinate and defecate, though this was ancient history for him. He was actually quite unaware when he did those things, and he did them through tubes into rubber bags. He groaned frequently and, unlike Garp, he groaned in whole words.
\"Shit,\" he groaned.
\"Garp?\" Jenny whispered. She stepped out of her slip and her panties; she took off her bra and pulled back the sheet.
\"Christ,\" said the External, softly; his lips were blistered with burns.
\"Goddamn shit!\" cried the Vital Organ man.
\"Garp,\" said Jenny Fields. She took hold of his erection and straddled him.
\"Aaa,\" said Garp. Even the r was gone. He was reduced to a vowel sound to express his joy or his sadness. \"Aaa,\" he said, as Jenny drew him inside her and sat on him with all her weight.
\"Garp?\" she asked. \"Okay? Is that good, Garp?\"
\"Good,\" he agreed, distinctly. But it was only a word from his wrecked memory, thrown clear for a moment when he came inside her. It was the first and last true word that Jenny Fields heard him speak: good. As he shrank and his vital stuff seeped from her, he was once again reduced to Aaa's; he closed his eyes and slept. When Jenny offered him her breast, he wasn't hungry.
\"God!\" called the External, being very gentle with the d; his tongue had been burned, too.
\"Piss!\" snarled the Vital Organ man.
Jenny Fields washed Garp and herself with warm water and soap in a white enamel hospital bowl. She wasn't going to douche, of course, and she had no doubt that the magic had worked. She felt more receptive than prepared soil\x{2014}the nourished earth\x{2014}and she had felt Garp shoot up inside her as generously as a hose in summer (as if he could water a lawn).
She never did it with him again. There was no reason. She didn't enjoy it. From time to time she helped him with her hand, and when he cried for it, she gave him her breast, but in a few weeks he had no more erections. When they took the bandages off his hands, they noticed that even the healing process seemed to be working in reverse; they wrapped him back up again. He lost all interest in nursing. His dreams struck Jenny as the dreams a fish might have. He was back in the womb, Jenny knew; he resumed a fetal position, tucked up small in the center of the bed. He made no sound at all. One morning Jenny watched him kick with his small, weak feet; she imagined she felt a kick inside. Though it was too soon for the real thing, she knew the real thing was on its way.
Soon Garp stopped kicking. He still got his oxygen by breathing air with his lungs, but Jenny knew this was simply an example of human adaptability. He wouldn't eat; they had to feed him intravenously, so once again he was attached to a kind of umbilical cord. Jenny anticipated his last phase with some anxiousness. Would there be a struggle at the end, like the sperm's frantic struggle? Would the sperm shield be lifted and the naked egg wait, expectantly, for death? In little Garp's return trip, how would his soul at last divide? But the phase passed without Jenny's observation. One day, when she was off duty, Technical Sergeant Garp died.
\"When else could he have died?\" Garp has written. \"With my mother off duty was the only way he could escape.\"
\"Of course I felt something when he died,\" Jenny Fields wrote in her famous autobiography. \"But the best of him was inside me. That was the best thing for both of us, the only way he could go on living, the only way I wanted to have a child. That the rest of the world finds this an immoral act only shows me that the rest of the world doesn't respect the rights of an individual.\"
It was <<1943|9c:0>>. When Jenny's pregnancy was apparent, she lost her job. Of course, it was all that her parents and brothers had expected; they weren't surprised. Jenny had long ago stopped trying to convince them of her purity. She moved through the big corridors in the parental estate at Dog's Head Harbor like a satisfied ghost. Her composure alarmed her family, and they left her alone. Secretly, Jenny was quite happy, but with all the musing she must have done about this expected child, it's a wonder she never gave a thought to names.
Because, when Jenny Fields gave birth to a nine-pound baby boy, she had no name in mind. Jenny's mother asked her what she wanted to name him, but Jenny had just delivered and had just received her sedative; she was not cooperative.
\"Garp,\" she said.
Her father, the footwear king, thought she had burped, but her mother whispered to him, \"The name is Garp.\"
\"Garp?\" he said. They knew they might find out who this baby's father was, this way. Jenny, of course, had not admitted a thing.
\"Find out if that's the son of a bitch's first name or last name,\" Jenny's father whispered to Jenny's mother.
\"Is that a first name or a last name, dear?\" Jenny's mother asked her.
Jenny was very sleepy. \"It's Garp,\" she said. \"Just Garp. That's the whole thing.\"
\"I think it's a last name,\" Jenny's mother told Jenny's father.
\"What's his first name?\" Jenny's father asked crossly.
\"I never knew,\" Jenny mumbled. This is true; she never did.
\"She never knew his first name!\" her father roared.
\"Please, dear,\" her mother said. \"He must have a first name.\"
\"Technical Sergeant Garp,\" said Jenny Fields.
\"A goddamn soldier, I knew it!\" her father said.
\"Technical Sergeant?\" Jenny's mother asked her.
\"T. S.,\" Jenny Fields said. \"T. S. Garp. That's my baby's name.\" She fell asleep.
Her father was furious. \"T. S. Garp!\" he hollered. \"What kind of a name for a baby is that?\"
\"All his own,\" Jenny told him, later. \"It's his own goddamn name, all his own.\"
\"It was great fun going to school with a name like that,\" Garp has written. \"The teachers would ask you what the initials stood for. First I used to say that they were just initials, but they never believed me. So I'd have to say, \"Call my mom. She'll tell you.\" And they would. And old Jenny would give them a piece of her mind.\"
Thus was the world given T. S. Garp: born from a good nurse with a will of her own, and the seed of a ball turret gunner\x{2014}his last shot.",

            "T.S. GARP always suspected he would die young. \"Like my father,\" Garp wrote, \"I believe I have a knack for brevity. I'm a one-shot man.\"
Garp narrowly escaped growing up on the grounds of an all-girls' school, where his mother was offered the position of school nurse. But Jenny Fields saw the possibly harrowing future that would have been involved in this decision: her little Garp surrounded by women (Jenny and Garp were offered an apartment in one of the dorms). She imagined her son's first sexual experience: a fantasy inspired by the sight and feel of the all-girls' laundry room, where, as a game, the girls would bury the child in soft mountains of young women's underwear. Jenny would have liked the job, but it was for Garp's sake that she turned down the offer. She was hired instead by the vast and famous Steering School, where she would be simply one more school nurse among many, and where the apartment offered her and Garp was in the cold, prison-windowed wing of the school's infirmary annex.
\"Never mind,\" her father told her. He was irritated with her that she chose to work at all; there was money enough, and he'd have been happier if she'd gone into hiding at the family estate in Dog's Head Harbor until her bastard son had grown up and moved away. \"If the child has any native intelligence,\" Jenny's father told her, \"he should eventually attend Steering, but in the meantime, I suppose, there's no better atmosphere for a boy to be raised in.\"
\"Native intelligence\" was one of the ways her father had of referring to Garp's dubious genetic background. The Steering School, where Jenny's father and brothers had gone, was at that time an all-boys' school. Jenny believed that if she could endure her confinement there\x{2014}through young Garp's prep school years\x{2014}she would be doing her best for her son. \"To make up for denying him a father,\" as her father put it to her.
\"It's odd,\" Garp wrote, \"that my mother, who perceived herself well enough to know that she wanted nothing to do with living with a man, ended up living with eight hundred boys.\"
So young Garp grew up with his mother in the infirmary annex of the Steering School. He was not exactly treated as a \"faculty brat\"\x{2014}the students' term for all the underage children of the faculty and staff. A school nurse was not considered in quite the same class or category as a faculty member. Moreover, Jenny made no attempt to invent a mythology for Garp's father\x{2014}to make up a marriage story for herself, to legitimize her son. She was a Fields, she made a point of telling you her name. Her son was a Garp. She made a point of telling you his name. \"It's his own name,\" she said.
Everyone got the picture. Not only were certain kinds of arrogance tolerated by the society of the Steering School, certain kinds were encouraged; but acceptable arrogance was a matter of taste and style. What you were arrogant about had to appear worthy\x{2014}of higher purpose\x{2014}and the manner in which you were arrogant was supposed to be charming. Wit did not come naturally to Jenny Fields. Garp wrote that his mother \"never chose to be arrogant but was only arrogant under duress.\" Pride was well loved in the community of the Steering School, but Jenny Fields appeared to be proud of an illegitimate child. Nothing to hang her head about, perhaps; however, she might show a little humility.
But Jenny was not only proud of Garp, she was especially pleased with the manner in which she had gotten him. The world did not know that manner, yet; Jenny had not brought out her autobiography\x{2014}she hadn't begun to write it, in fact. She was waiting for Garp to be old enough to appreciate the story.
The story Garp knew was all that Jenny would tell anyone who was bold enough to ask. Jenny's story was a sober three sentences long.
1. The father of Garp was a soldier.
2. The war killed him.
3. Who took the time for weddings when there was a war?
Both the precision and mystery of this story might have been interpreted romantically. After all, given the mere facts, the father might have been a war hero. A doomed love affair could be imagined. Nurse Fields might have been a field nurse. She might have fallen in love \"at the front.\" And the father of Garp might have felt he owed one last mission \"to the men.\" But Jenny Fields did not inspire the imagination of such a melodrama. For one thing, she seemed too pleased with her aloneness; she didn't appear in the least misty about the past. She was never distracted, she was simply all for little Garp\x{2014}and for being a good nurse.
Of course, the Fields name was known at the Steering School. The famous footwear king of New England was a generous alumnus, and whether or not it was suspected at the time, he would even become a trustee. His was not the oldest but not the newest of New England money, and his wife, Jenny's mother\x{2014}a former Boston Weeks\x{2014}was perhaps still better known at Steering. Among the older faculty there were those who could remember years and years, without interruption, when there had always been a graduating Weeks. Yet, to the Steering School, Jenny Fields didn't seem to have inherited all the credentials. She was handsome, they would admit, but she was plain; she wore her nurse's uniform when she could have dressed in something smarter. In fact, this whole business of being a nurse\x{2014}of which she also appeared too proud\x{2014}was curious. Considering her family. Nursing was not enough of a profession for a Fields or a Weeks.
Socially, Jenny had that kind of graceless seriousness which makes more frivolous people uncomfortable. She read a lot and was a great ransacker of the Steering library; the book someone wanted was always discovered to be checked out to Nurse Fields. Phone calls were politely answered; Jenny frequently offered to deliver the book directly to the party who wanted it, as soon as she finished it. She finished such books promptly, but she had nothing to say about them. In a school community, someone who reads a book for some secretive purpose, other than discussing it, is strange. What was she reading for?
That she attended classes in her off-duty hours was stranger still. It was written in the constitution of the Steering School that faculty and staff and/or their spouses could attend, free of charge, any course offered at Steering, simply by securing the permission of the instructor. Who would turn away a nurse?\x{2014}from the Elizabethans, from the Victorian Novel, from the History of Russia until <<1917|9c:0>>, from an Introduction to Genetics, from Western Civilization I and II. Over the years Jenny Fields would march from Caesar to Eisenhower\x{2014}past Luther and Lenin, Erasmus and mitosis, osmosis and Freud, Rembrandt and chromosomes and van Gogh\x{2014}from the Styx to the names, from Homer to Virginia Woolf. From Athens to Auschwitz, she never said a word. She was the only woman in the classes. In her white uniform she listened so quietly that the boys and finally the teacher forgot her and relaxed: they went on with the learning process while she sat keenly white and still among them, a witness to everything\x{2014}maybe determining nothing, possibly judging it all.
Jenny Fields was getting the education she had waited for; now the time seemed ripe. But her motives were not wholly selfish; she was screening the Steering School for her son. When Garp was old enough to attend, she'd be able to give him lots of advice\x{2014}she'd know the deadweights in every department, those courses that meandered and those that sang.
Her books spilled out of the tiny wing apartment in the infirmary annex. She spent ten years at the Steering School before discovering that the bookstore offered a 10 percent discount to the faculty and staff (which the bookstore had never offered her). This made her angry. She was generous with her books, too\x{2014}eventually shelving them in every room of the bleak infirmary annex. But they outgrew the shelf space and slid into the main infirmary, into the waiting room, and into X-ray, first covering and then replacing the newspapers and the magazines. Slowly, the sick of the Steering School learned what a serious place Steering was\x{2014}not your ordinary hospital, crammed with light reading and the media trash. While you waited to see the doctor, you could browse through The Waning of the Middle Ages; waiting for your lab results, you could ask the nurse to bring you that invaluable genetics manual, The Fruit Fly Handbook. If you were seriously ill, or might be visiting the infirmary for a long time, there was sure to be a copy of The Magic Mountain. For the boy with the broken leg, and all the athletically wounded, there were the good heroes and their meaty adventures\x{2014}there were Conrad and Melville instead of Sports Illustrated; instead of Time and Newsweek, there were Dickens and Hemingway and Twain. What a wet dream for the lovers of literature, to lie sick at Steering! At last, a hospital with something good to read.
When Jenny Fields had spent twelve years at Steering, it was a habit among the school librarians, upon recognizing that they didn't have a book which someone sought, to say, \"Perhaps the infirmary has it.\"
And at the bookstore, when something was out of stock or out of print, they might recommend that you \"find Nurse Fields over at the infirmary; she might have it.\"
And Jenny would frown upon hearing the request, and say, \"I believe that's in twenty-six, at the annex, but McCarty is reading it. He has the flu. Perhaps when he's through, he'll be glad to let you have it.\" Or she might respond, \"I last saw that one down at the whirlpool bath. It might be a little wet, in the beginning.\"
It is impossible to judge Jenny's influence on the quality of education at Steering, but she never got over her anger at being cheated out of the 10 percent discount for ten years. \"My mother supported that bookstore,\" Garp wrote. \"By comparison, nobody else at Steering ever read anything.\"",

            "Although Jenny Fields sat every day at her typewriter, she did not know how to write. Although she was\x{2014}physically\x{2014}writing, she did not enjoy reading over what she'd written. Before long, she tried to remember the good things she'd read and what made them different from her own first-draft attempt. She'd simply begun at the beginning. \"I was born,\" and so forth. \"My parents wanted me to stay at Wellesley: however...\" And, of course: \"I decided I wanted a child of my own and eventually got one in the following manner...\" But Jenny had read enough good stories to know that hers didn't sound like the good stories in her memory. She wondered what could be wrong, and she frequently sent Garp on errands to the few bookstores that sold books in English. She wanted to look more closely at how books began: she had quickly produced over three hundred typed pages, yet she felt that her book never really started.
But Jenny suffered her writing problems silently; she was cheerful with Garp, even if she was rarely very attentive. Jenny Fields felt all her life that things began and came to an end. Like Garp's education\x{2014}like her own. Like Sergeant Garp. She had not lost any affection for her son, but she felt that a phase of her mothering him was over; she felt she had brought Garp along this far, and now she should let him find something to do by himself. She could not go through their lives signing him up for wrestling, or for something else. Jenny liked living with her son; in fact, it didn't occur to her that they would ever live apart. But Jenny expected Garp to entertain himself every day in Vienna, and so Garp did.
He had gotten no further with his story about a close, interesting family except that he had found something interesting for them to do. The father of the family was some sort of inspector and his family went with him when he did his job. The job involved scrutinizing all the restaurants and hotels and pensions in Austria\x{2014}evaluating them and giving them a rating according to A, B, C. It was a job Garp imagined that he'd like to have. In a country like Austria, so dependent on tourism, the classification and reclassification of the places the tourists ate in and slept in should have a kind of desperate importance, but Garp couldn't imagine what could be important about it\x{2014}or for whom. So far all he had was this family: they had a funny job. They exposed flaws; they gave out the grades. So what? It was easier to write to Helen.
That late summer and early fall, Garp walked and rode the trolleys all over Vienna, meeting no one. He wrote Helen that \"a part of adolescence is feeling that there's no one else around who's enough like yourself to understand you\". Garp wrote that he believed Vienna enhanced that feeling in him \"because in Vienna there really isn't anyone like myself around.\"
His perception was at least numerically correct. There were very few people in Vienna who were even the same age as Garp. Not many Viennese were born in 1943, for that matter, not many Viennese were born from the start of the Nazi occupation in 1938 through the end of the war in 1945. And although there were a surprising number of babies born out of rapes, not many Viennese wanted babies until after 1955\x{2014}the end of the Russian occupation. Vienna was a city occupied by foreigners for seventeen years. To most Viennese, it is understandable, those seventeen years did not seem like a good and wise time to have children. It was Garp's experience to live in a city that made him feel peculiar to be eighteen years old. This must have made him grow older faster, and this must have contributed to his increasing sense that Vienna was more of \"a museum housing a dead city\"\x{2014}as he wrote Helen\x{2014}than it was a city that was still alive.
Garp's observation was not offered as criticism. Garp liked wandering around in a museum. \"A more real city might not have suited me so well,\" he later wrote. \"But Vienna was in its death phase, it lay still and let me look at it, and think about it, and look again. In a living city, I could never have noticed so much. Living cities don't hold still.\"
Thus T. S. Garp spent the warm months noticing Vienna, writing letters to Helen Holm, and managing the domestic life of his mother who had added the isolation of writing to her chosen life of solitude. \"My mother, the writer,\" Garp referred to her, facetiously, in countless letters to Helen. But he envied Jenny, that she was writing at all. He felt stuck with his story. He realized he could go on giving his made-up family one adventure after another, but where were they going? To one more B restaurant with such a weakness in their desserts that an A rating was a lifetime out of reach; to one more B hotel, sliding to C as surely as the mildew smell in the lobby would never go away. Perhaps someone in the inspector's family could be poisoned, in a class A restaurant, but what would it mean? And there could be crazy people, or even criminals, hiding out in one of the pensions, but what would they have to do with the scheme of things?
Garp knew that he did not have a scheme of things.
He saw a four-member circus unload from Hungary, or Yugoslavia, at a railroad station. He tried to imagine them in his story. There had been a bear who rode a motorcycle, around and around a parking lot. A small crowd gathered and a man who walked on his hands collected money for the bear's performance in a pot balanced on the soles of his feet; he fell, occasionally, but so did the bear.
Finally, the motorcycle wouldn't start anymore. It never became clear what the two other members of this circus did; just as they were meant to take over for the bear and the man who walked on his hands, the police came and asked them to fill out a lot of forms. That had not been interesting to watch and the crowd\x{2014}what there was of one\x{2014}had gone away. Garp had stayed the longest, not because he was interested in further performances by this decrepit circus but because he was interested in getting them into his story. He couldn't imagine how. As Garp was leaving the railroad station, he could hear the bear throwing up.
For weeks Garp's only progress with his story was a title: \"The Austrian Tourist Bureau.\" He didn't like it. He went back to being a tourist instead of a writer.
But when the weather grew colder, Garp tired of tourism; he took to carping at Helen for not writing him back enough\x{2014}a sign he was writing to her too much. She was much busier than he was; she was in college, where she'd been accepted with sophomore standing, and she was carrying more than double the average load of courses. If Helen and Garp were similar, in these early years, it was that they both behaved as if they were going somewhere in a hurry. \"Leave poor Helen alone,\" Jenny advised him. \"I thought you were going to write something beside letters.\" But Garp did not like to think of competing in the same apartment with his mother. Her typewriter never paused for thought; Garp knew that its steady pounding would probably end his career as a writer before he could properly begin. \"My mother never knew about the silence of revision,\" Garp once remarked.
By November Jenny had six hundred manuscript pages, but still she had the feeling that she had not really begun. Garp had no subject that could spill out of him in this fashion. Imagination, he realized, came harder than memory.
His \"breakthrough,\" as he would call it when he wrote Helen, occurred one cold and snowy day in the Museum of the History of the City of Vienna. It was a museum within easy walking distance of the Schwindgasse; somehow he had skipped seeing it, knowing he could walk there any day. Jenny told him about it. It was one of the two or three places she had actually visited herself, only because it was right across the Karlsplatz and well within what she called her neighborhood.
She mentioned there was a writer's room in the museum; she forgot whose. She'd thought having a writer's room in a museum was an interesting idea.
\"A writer's room, Mom?\" Garp asked.
\"Yes, it's a whole room,\" Jenny said. \"They took all the writer's furniture, and maybe the walls and floor, too. I don't know how they did it.\"
\"I don't know why they did it,\" Garp said. \"The whole room is in the museum?\"
\"Yes, I think it was a bedroom,\" Jenny said, \"but it was also where the writer actually wrote.\"
Garp rolled his eyes. It sounded obscene to him. Would the writer's toothbrush be there? And the chamber pot?
It was a perfectly ordinary room, but the bed looked too small\x{2014}like a child's bed. The writing table looked small, too. Not the bed or the table of an expansive writer, Garp thought. The wood was dark; everything looked easily breakable; Garp thought his mother had a better room to write in. The writer whose room was enshrined in the Museum of the History of the City of Vienna was named Franz Grillparzer; Garp had never heard of him.
Franz Grillparzer died in 1872; he was an Austrian poet and dramatist, whom very few people outside Austria have ever heard of. He is one of those nineteenth-century writers who did not survive the nineteenth century with any enduring popularity, and Garp would later argue that Grillparzer did not deserve to survive the nineteenth century. Garp was not interested in plays and poems, but he went to the library and read what is considered to be Grillparzer's outstanding prose work: the long short story \"The Poor Fiddler.\" Perhaps, Garp thought, his three years of Steering German were not enough to allow him to appreciate the story; in German, he hated it. He then found an English translation of the story, in a secondhand bookstore on Habsburgergasse: he still hated it.
Garp thought that Grillparzer's famous story was a ludicrous melodrama: he also thought it was ineptly told and baldly sentimental. It was only vaguely remindful to him of nineteenth-century Russian stories, where often the character is an indecisive procrastinator and a failure in every aspect of practical life: but Dostoevsky, in Garp's opinion, could compel you to be interested in such a wretch; Grillparzer bored you with tearful trivia.
In the same secondhand bookstore Garp bought an English translation of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius; he had been made to read Marcus Aurelius in a Latin class at Steering but he had never read him in English before. He bought the book because the bookstore owner told Garp that Marcus Aurelius had died in Vienna.
\"In the life of a man,\" Marcus Aurelius wrote, \"his time is but a moment, his being an incessant flux, his sense a dim rushlight, his body a prey of worms, his soul an unquiet eddy, his fortune dark, his fame doubtful. In short, all that is body is as coursing waters, all that is of the soul as dreams and vapors.\" Garp somehow thought that Marcus Aurelius must have lived in Vienna when he wrote that.
The subject of Marcus Aurelius's dreary observations was certainly the subject of most serious writing, Garp thought; between Grillparzer and Dostoevsky the difference was not subject matter. The difference, Garp concluded, was intelligence and grace; the difference was art. Somehow this obvious discovery pleased him. Years later, Garp read in a critical introduction to Grillparzer's work that Grillparzer was \"sensitive, tortured, fitfully paranoid, often depressed, cranky, and choked with melancholy; in short, a complex and modern man.\"
\"Maybe so,\" Garp wrote. \"But he was also an extremely bad writer.\"
Garp's conviction that Franz Grillparzer was a \"bad\" writer seemed to provide the young man with his first real confidence as an artist\x{2014}even before he had written anything. Perhaps in every writer's life there needs to be that moment when some other writer is attacked as unworthy of the job. Garp's killer instinct in regard to poor Grillparzer was almost a wrestling secret; it was as if Garp had observed an opponent in a match with another wrestler; spotting the weaknesses, Garp knew he could do better. He even forced Jenny to read \"The Poor Fiddler.\" It was one of the few times he would seek her literary judgment.
\"Trash,\" Jenny pronounced it. \"Simplistic. Maudlin. Cream puff.\"
They were both delighted.
\"I didn't like his room, really,\" Jenny told Garp. \"It was just not a writer's room.\"
\"Well, I don't think that matters, Mom,\" Garp said.
\"But it was a very cramped room,\" Jenny complained. \"It was too dark, and it looked very fussy.\"
Garp peered into his mother's room. Over her bed and dresser, and taped to her wall mirror\x{2014}nearly obscuring his mother's own image\x{2014}were the scattered pages of her incredibly long and messy manuscript. Garp didn't think his mother's room looked very much like a writer's room, either, but he didn't say so.
He wrote Helen a long, cocky letter, quoting Marcus Aurelius and slamming Franz Grillparzer. In Garp's opinion, \"Franz Grillparzer died forever in 1872 and like a cheap local wine does not travel very far from Vienna without spoiling.\" The letter was a kind of muscle-flexing; perhaps Helen knew that. The letter was calisthenics; Garp made a carbon copy of it and decided he liked it so well that he kept the original and sent Helen the carbon. \"I feel a little like a library,\" Helen wrote him. \"It's as if you intend to use me as your file drawer.\"
Was Helen really complaining? Garp was not sensitive enough to Helen's own life to bother to ask her. He merely wrote back that he was \"getting ready to write.\" He was confident she would like the results. Helen may have felt warned away from him, but she didn't indicate any anxiety. At college she was gobbling courses at nearly triple the average rate. Approaching the end of her first semester, she was about to become a second-semester junior. The self-absorption and ego of a young writer did not frighten Helen Holm, she was moving at her own remarkable pace and she appreciated someone who was determined. Also she liked Garp's writing to her: she had an ego, too, and his letters, she kept telling him, were awfully well written.
In Vienna Jenny and Garp went on a spree of Grillparzer jokes. They began to uncover little signs of the dead Grillparzer all over the city. There was a Grillparzergasse, there was a Kaffeehaus des Grillparzers; and one day in a pastry shop they were amazed to find a sort of layer cake named after him: Grillparzertorte! It was much too sweet. Thus, when Garp cooked for his mother, he asked her if she wanted her egg soft-boiled or Grillparzered. And one day, at the Sch\x{446}nbrunn Zoo, they observed a particularly gangling antelope, its flanks spindly and beshitted; the antelope stood sadly in its narrow and foul winter quarters. Garp identified it: der Gnu des Grillparzers.
Of her own writing, Jenny one day remarked to Garp that she was guilty of \"doing a Grillparzer.\" She explained that this meant she had introduced a scene or a character \"like an alarm going off.\" The scene she had in mind was the scene in the movie house in Boston when the soldier had approached her. \"At the movie,\" wrote Jenny Fields, \"a soldier consumed with lust approached me.\"
\"That's awful, Mom,\" Garp admitted. The phrase \"consumed with lust\" was what Jenny meant by \"doing a Grillparzer.\"
\"But that's what it was,\" Jenny said. \"It was lust, all right.\"
\"It's better to say he was thick with lust,\" Garp suggested.
\"Yuck,\" Jenny said. Another Grillparzer. It was the lust she didn't care for, in general. They discussed lust, as best they could. Garp confessed his lust for Cushie Percy and rendered a suitably tame version of the consummation scene. Jenny did not like it. \"And Helen?\" Jenny asked. \"Do you feel that for Helen?\"
Garp admitted he did.
\"How terrible,\" Jenny said. She did not understand the feeling and did not see how Garp could ever associate it with pleasure, much less with affection.
\"\"All that is body is as coursing waters,\"\" Garp said lamely, quoting Marcus Aurelius; his mother just shook her head. They ate dinner in a very red restaurant in the vicinity of Blutgasse. \"Blood Street,\" Garp translated for her, happily.
\"Stop translating everything,\" Jenny told him. \"I don't want to know everything.\" She thought the decor of the restaurant was too red and the food was too expensive. The service was slow and they started for home too late. It was very cold and the gay lights of the K\x{434}rntnerstrasse did little to warm them.
\"Let's get a taxi,\" Jenny said. But Garp insisted that in another five blocks they could take a streetcar just as easily. \"You and your damn Strassenbahns,\" Jenny said.
It was clear that the subject of \"lust\" had spoiled their evening.
The first district glittered with Christmas gaudiness; between the towering spires of Saint Stephen's and the massive bulk of the opera house lay seven blocks of shops and bars and hotels; in those seven blocks, they could have been anywhere in the world at wintertime. \"Some night we've got to go to the opera, Mom,\" Garp suggested. They had been in Vienna for six months without going to the opera, but Jenny did not like to stay up late at night.
\"Go by yourself,\" Jenny said. She saw, ahead of them, three women standing in long fur coats: one of them had a matching fur muff and she held the muff in front of her face and breathed into it to warm her hands. She was quite elegant to look at, although there was something of the tinsel of Christmas about the other two women with her. Jenny envied the woman her muff. \"That's what I want,\" Jenny announced. \"Where can I get one of those?\" She pointed to the women ahead of them but Garp didn't know what she meant.
The women, he knew, were whores.
When the whores saw Jenny coming up the street with Garp, they were puzzled at the relationship. They saw a handsome boy with a plain but handsome woman who was old enough to be his mother, but Jenny hooked Garp's arm rather formally when she walked with him, and there was something like tension and confusion in the conversation Garp and Jenny were having\x{2014}which made the whores think Jenny could not have been Garp's mother. Then Jenny pointed at them and they were angry\x{2014}they thought Jenny was another whore who was working their territory and had snagged a boy who looked well-off and not sinister\x{2014}a pretty boy who might have paid them.
In Vienna, prostitution is legal and complexly controlled. There is something like a union; there are medical certificates, periodical checkups, identification cards. Only the best-looking prostitutes are allowed to work the posh streets in the first district. In the outlying districts the prostitutes are uglier or older, or both; they are also cheaper, of course. District by district, their prices are supposed to be fixed. When the whores saw Jenny they stepped out on the sidewalk to block Jenny's and Garp's way. They had quickly decided that Jenny was not quite up to the standard of a first-district prostitute, and that she was probably working independently\x{2014}which is illegal\x{2014}or had stepped out of her assigned district to try to pull a little more money; that would get her in a lot of trouble with the other prostitutes.
In truth, Jenny would not have been mistaken for a prostitute by most neople, but it is hard to say exactly what she looked like. She had dressed as a nurse for so many years that she did not really know how to dress in Vienna; she tended to overdress when she went out with Garp, perhaps in compensation for the old bathrobe in which she wrote. She had no experience in buying clothes for herself, and in a foreign city all the clothes looked slightly different to her. With no particular taste in mind, she simply bought the more expensive things: after all, she did have money and she did not have the patience or the interest for any comparative shopping. As a consequence, she looked new and shiny in her clothes, and beside Garp she did not look as if she came from the same family. Garp's constant dress, at Steering, had been a jacket and tie and comfortable pants\x{2014}a kind of sloppy city standard uniform that made him anonymous almost anywhere.
\"Would you ask that woman where she got that muff?\" Jenny said to Garp. To her surprise, the women blocked the sidewalk to meet them.
\"They're whores, Mom,\" Garp whispered to her.
Jenny Fields froze. The woman with the muff spoke sharply to her. Jenny didn't understand a word, of course, she stared at Garp for a translation. The woman spoke a stream of things to Jenny, who never took her eyes off her son.
\"My mother wanted to ask you where you got your pretty muff.\" Garp said in his slow German.
\"Oh, they're foreigners,\" said one.
\"God, it's his mother,\" said another.
The woman with the muff stared at Jenny, who now stared at the woman's muff. One of the whores was a young girl with her hair piled very high and sprinkled with little gold and silver stars; she also had a green star tattoo on one cheek and a scar, which pulled her upper lip only slightly out of line\x{2014}so that, for a moment, you didn't know what was wrong with her face, only that something was wrong. There was nothing at all wrong with her body, though: she was tall and lean and very hard to look at, though Jenny now found herself staring at her.
\"Ask her how old she is,\" Jenny said to Garp.
\"Ich bin eighteen,\" the girl said. \"I know good English.\"
\"That's how old my son is,\" Jenny said, nudging Garp. She did not understand that the they had mistaken her for one of them; when Garp told her, later, she was furious\x{2014}but only at herself. \"It's my clothes!\" she cried. \"I don't know how to dress!\" And from that moment on, Jenny Fields would never dress as anything but a nurse: she put her uniform back on and wore it everywhere\x{2014}as if she were forever on duty, though she would never be a nurse again.
\"May I see your muff?\" Jenny asked the woman who had one. Jenny had assumed that they all spoke English, but only the young girl knew the language. Garp translated and the woman reluctantly removed her muff\x{2014}a scent of perfume emerging from the warm nest where her long hands, sparkling with rings, had been clutched together.
The third whore had a pockmark on her forehead, like an impression made with a peach pit. Aside from this flaw, and a small fat mouth like the mouth of an overweight child, she was standardly ripe\x{2014}in her twenties, Garp guessed; she probably had an enormous bosom, but under her black fur coat it was hard to be sure.
The woman with the muff, Garp thought, was beautiful. She had a long, potentially sad face. Her body, Garp imagined, was serene. Her mouth was very calm. Only her eyes and her bare hands in the cold night let Garp see that she was his mother's age, at least. Maybe she was older. \"It was a gift,\" she said to Garp, about the muff. \"It came with the coat.\" They were a silver-blond fur, very sleek.
\"It is the real thing,\" said the young whore who spoke English; she obviously admired everything about the older prostitute.
\"Of course, you can buy something, not quite so expensive almost anywhere,\" the pockmarked woman told Garp. \"Go to Stef's,\" she said, in a queer slang that Garp barely understood, and she pointed up the K\x{434}rntnerstrasse. But Jenny didn't look and Garp only nodded and continued to gaze at the older woman's long bare fingers twinkling with rings.
\"My hands are cold,\" she said softly to Garp, and Garp took the muff from Jenny and gave it back to the whore. Jenny seemed in a daze.
\"Let's talk to her,\" Jenny told Garp. \"I want to ask her about it.\"
\"About what, Mom?\" Garp said. \"Jesus Christ.\"
\"What we were talking about,\" Jenny said. \"I want to ask her about lust.\"
The two older whores looked at the one who knew English but her English was not fast enough to catch any of this.
\"It's cold, Mom,\" Garp complained. \"And it's late. Let's just go home.\"
\"Tell her we want to go to some place warm, just to sit and talk,\" Jenny said. \"She'll let us pay her for that, won't she?\"
\"I suppose so,\" Garp groaned. \"Mom, she doesn't know anything about lust. They probably don't feel anything very much like that.\"
\"I want to know about male lust,\" Jenny said. \"About your lust. She must know something about that.\"
\"For God's sake, Mom!\" Garp said.
\"Was macht's?\" the lovely prostitute asked him. \"What's the matter?\" she asked. \"What's going on here? Does she want to buy the muff?\"
\"No, no,\" Garp said. \"She wants to buy you.\"
The older whore looked stunned; the whore with the pockmark laughed.
\"No, no,\" Garp explained. \"Just to talk. My mother just wants to ask you some questions.\"
\"It's cold,\" the whore told him, suspiciously.
\"Some place inside?\" Garp suggested. \"Any place you like.\"
\"Ask her what she charges,\" Jenny said.
\"Wie viel kostet?\" mumbled Garp.
\"It costs five hundred schillings,\" the whore said, \"usually.\" Garp had to explain to Jenny that this was about twenty dollars. Jenny Fields would live for more than a year in Austria and never learn the numbers, in German, or the money system.
\"Twenty dollars, just to talk?\" Jenny said.
\"No, no, Mom,\" Garp said, \"that's for the usual.\" Jenny thought. Was twenty dollars a lot for the usual? She didn't know.
\"Tell her we'll give her ten,\" Jenny said, but the whore looked doubtful\x{2014}as if talk, for her, might be more difficult than the \"usual.\" Her indecision was influenced by more than price, however; she didn't trust Garp and Jenny. She asked the young whore who spoke English if they were British or American. Americans, she was told\x{2014}this seemed to relieve her, slightly.
\"The British are often perverse,\" she told Garp, simply. \"Americans are usually ordinary.\"
\"We just want to talk with you,\" Garp insisted, but he could see that the prostitute firmly imagined some mother-and-son act of monstrous oddity.
\"Two hundred and fifty schillings,\" the lady with the mink muff finally agreed. \"And you buy my coffee.\"
So they went to the place all the whores went to get warm, a tiny bar with miniature tables; the phone rang all the time but only a few men lurked sullenly by the coat rack, looking the women over. There was some rule that the women could not be approached when they were in this bar; the bar was a kind of home base, a time-out zone.
\"Ask her how old she is,\" Jenny said to Garp; but when he asked her, the woman softly shut her eyes and shook her head. \"Okay,\" said Jenny, \"ask her why she thinks men like her.\" Garp rolled his eyes. \"Well, you do like her?\" Jenny asked him. Garp said he did. \"Well, what is it about her that you want?\" Jenny asked him. \"I don't mean just her sex parts, I mean is there something else that's satisfying? Something to imagine, something to think about, some kind of aura?\" Jenny asked.
\"Why don't you pay me two hundred and fifty schillings and not ask her any questions, Mom,\" Garp said tiredly.
\"Don't be fresh,\" Jenny said. \"I want to know if it degrades her to feel wanted in that way\x{2014}and then to be had in that way, I suppose\x{2014}or whether she thinks it only degrades the men?\" Garp struggled to translate this. The woman appeared to think very seriously about it; or else she didn't understand the question, or Garp's German.
\"I don't know,\" she finally said.
\"I have other questions,\" Jenny said.
For an hour, it continued. When the whore said she had to get back to work, Jenny seemed neither satisfied nor disappointed by the interview's lack of concrete results; she just seemed insatiably curious. Garp had never wanted anyone as much as he wanted the woman.
\"Do you want her?\" Jenny asked him, so suddenly that he couldn't lie. \"I mean, after all this\x{2014}and looking at her, and talking with her\x{2014}do you really want to have sex with her, too?\"
\"Of course, Mom,\" Garp said, miserably. Jenny looked no closer to understanding lust than she was before dinner. She looked puzzled and surprised at her son.
\"All right,\" she said. She handed him the 250 schillings that they owed the woman, and another 500 schillings. \"You do what you want to do,\" she told him, \"or what you have to do, I guess. But please take me home first.\"
The whore had watched the money change hands; she had an eye for recognizing the correct amount. \"Look,\" she said to Garp, and touched his hand with her fingers, as cold as her rings. \"It's all right with me if your mother wants to buy me for you, but she can't come along with us. I will not have her watch us, absolutely not. I'm still a Catholic, believe it or not,\" she said, \"and if you want anything funny like that, you'll have to ask Tina.\"
Garp wondered who Tina was; he gave a shudder at the thought that nothing must be too \"funny\" for her. \"I'm going to take my mother home,\" Garp told the beautiful woman. \"And I won't be back to see you.\" But she smiled at him and he thought his erection would burst through his pocket of loose schillings and worthless groschen. Just one of her perfect teeth\x{2014}but it was a big front upper tooth\x{2014}was all gold.
In the taxi (that Garp agreed to take home) Garp explained to his mother the Viennese system of prostitution. Jenny was not surprised to hear that prostitution was legal: she was surprised to learn that it was illegal in so many other places. \"Why shouldn't it be legal?\" she asked. \"Why can't a woman use her body the way she wants to? If someone wants to pay for it, it's just one more crummy deal. Is twenty dollars a lot of money for it?\"
\"No, that's pretty good,\" Garp said. \"At least, it's a very low price for the good-looking ones.\"
Jenny slapped him. \"You know all about it!\" she said. Then she said she was sorry\x{2014}she had never struck him before, she just didn't understand this fucking lust, lust, lust! at all.
At the Schwindgasse apartment, Garp made a point of not going out: in fact, he was in his own bed and asleep before Jenny, who paced through her manuscript pages in her wild room. A sentence boiled in her, but she could not yet see it clearly.
Garp dreamed of other prostitutes; he had visited two or three of them in Vienna\x{2014}but he had never paid the first-district prices. The next evening, after an early supper at the Schwindgasse, Garp went to see the woman with the mink muff streaked with light.
Her working name was Charlotte. She was not surprised to see him. Charlotte was old enough to know when she'd successfully hooked someone, although she never did tell Garp exactly how old she was. She had taken very fine care of herself, and only when she was completely undressed was her age apparent anywhere except in the veins on her long hands. There were stretch marks on her belly and her breasts, but she told Garp that the child had died a long time ago. She did not mind if Garp touched the Cesarean scar.
After he had seen Charlotte four times at the fixed first-district rate, he happened to run into her at the Naschmarkt on a Saturday morning. She was buying fruit. Her hair was probably a little dirty; she'd covered it with a scarf and wore it like a young girl's\x{2014}with bangs and two short braids. The bangs were slightly greasy against her forehead which seemed paler in the daylight. She had no makeup on and wore a pair of American jeans and tennis sneakers and a long coatstyle sweater with a high roll collar. Garp would not have recognized her if he hadn't seen her hands clutching the fruit; she had all her rings on.
At first she wouldn't answer him when he spoke to her but he had already told her that he did all the shopping and the cooking for himself and his mother, and she found this amusing. After her irritation at meeting a customer in her off-duty hours, she seemed good-humored. It did not become clear to Garp, for a while, that he was the same age as Charlotte's child would have been. Charlotte took some vicarious interest in the way Garp was living with his mother.
\"How's your mother's writing coming?\" Charlotte would ask him.
\"She's still pounding away,\" Garp would say. \"I don't think she's solved the lust problem yet.\"
But only to a point did Charlotte allow Garp to joke about his mother.
Garp was insecure enough about himself with Charlotte that he never told her he was trying to write, too; he knew she would think he was too young. Sometimes, he thought so, too. And his story wasn't ready to tell someone about. The most he had done was change the title. He now called it \"The Pension Grillparzer,\" and that title was the first thing about it that solidly pleased him. It helped him to focus. Now he had a place in mind, just one place where almost everything that was important was going to happen. This helped him to think in a more focused way about his characters, too. About the family of classifiers, about the other residents of one small, sad pension somewhere (it would have to be small and sad, and in Vienna, to be named after Franz Grillparzer). Those \"other residents\" would include a kind of circus; not a very good kind, either, he imagined, but a circus with no other place to stay. No other place would have them.
In the world of ratings, the whole thing would be a kind of C experience. This kind of imagining got Garp started, slowly, in what he thought was a real direction; he was right about that, but it was too new to write it down\x{2014}or even to write about it. Anyway, the more he wrote to Helen the less he wrote in other, important ways: and he couldn't discuss this with his mother: imagination was not her greatest strength. Of course, he'd have felt foolish discussing any of this with Charlotte.
Garp often met Charlotte at the Naschmarkt on Saturdays. They shopped and sometimes they ate lunch together in a Serbian place not far from the Stadtpark. On these occasions Charlotte paid for herself. At <<one|9t:1>> such lunch Garp confessed to her that the first-district rate was hard for him to pay regularly without admitting to his mother where this steady flow of money was going. Charlotte was angry at him for bringing up business when she wasn't working. She would have been angrier if he'd admitted that he was seeing less of her, professionally, because the sixth-district prices of someone whom he met at the corner of Karl Schweighofergasse and Mariahilfer were much easier to conceal from Jenny.
Charlotte had a low opinion of her colleagues who operated out of the first district. She'd once told Garp she was planning to retire at the first sign that her first-district appeal was slipping. She would never do business in the outer districts. She had a lot of money saved, she told him, and she was going to move to Munich (where nobody knew she was a whore) and marry a young doctor who could take care of her, in every way, until she died: it was unnecessary for her to explain to Garp that she had always appealed to younger men, but Garp thoroughly resented her assumption that doctors were\x{2014}in the long run\x{2014}desirable. It may be this early exposure to the desirability of doctors that caused Garp, in his literary career, often to people his novels and stories with such unlikely characters from the medical profession. If so, it didn't occur to him until later. There is no doctor in \"The Pension Grillparzer.\" In this beginning there is very little about death, either, although that is the subject the story would come to. In the beginning Garp had only a dream of death, but it was a whale of a dream and he gave it to the oldest person alive in his story: a grandmother. Garp guessed this meant that she would be the first to die.",

            '[ap 01:00] The World According to Garp - John Irving.epub (OEBPS/Text/Section0009.xhtml) - one',
            "IT was a boy; their second son. Duncan's brother was called Walt\x{2014}it was never Walter, and never the German Valt; he was simply a t at the end of a wall. Walt: like a beaver's tail smacking water, like a well-hit squash ball. He dropped into their lives and they had two boys.
Garp tried to write a second novel. Helen took her second job; she became an associate professor of English at the state university, in the town next-door to the women's college. Garp and his boys had a boys' gym to play in, and Helen had an occasional bright graduate student to relieve her of the monotony of younger people; she also had more, and more interesting, colleagues.
One of them was Harrison Fletcher; his field was the Victorian Novel, but Helen liked him for other reasons\x{2014}among them: he was also married to a writer. Her name was Alice; she was also working on her second novel, although she'd never finished her first. When the Garps met her, they thought she could easily be mistaken for an Ellen Jamesian\x{2014}she simply didn't talk. Harrison, whom Garp called Harry, had never been called Harry before\x{2014}but he liked Garp and he appeared to enjoy his new name as if it were a present Garp had given him. Helen would continue to call him Harrison, but to Garp he was Harry Fletcher. He was Garp's first friend, though Garp and Harrison both sensed that Harrison preferred Helen's company.
Neither Helen nor Garp knew what to make of Quiet Alice, as they called her. \"She must be writing one hell of a book,\" Garp often said. \"It's taken all her words away.\"
The Fletchers had one child, a daughter whose age put her awkwardly between Duncan and Walt: it was implied that they wanted another. But the book, Alice's second novel, came first; when it was over, they would have a second child, they said.
The couples had dinner together occasionally, but the Fletchers were strictly cook-out people\x{2014}which is to say, neither of them cooked\x{2014}and Garp was in a period where he baked his own bread, he had a stockpot always simmering on the stove. Mostly, Helen and Harrison discussed books, teaching, and their colleagues, they ate lunch together at the university union, they conversed\x{2014}at length\x{2014}in the evening, on the phone. And Garp and Harry went to the football games, the basketball games, and the wrestling meets; three times a week they played squash, which was Harry's game\x{2014}his only sport\x{2014}but Garp could play even with him simply because Garp was a better athlete, in better shape from all his running. For the pleasure of these games, Garp suppressed his dislike of balls.
In the second year of this friendship, Harry told Garp that Alice liked to go to movies. \"I don't,\" Harry admitted, \"but if you do\x{2014}and Helen said that you did\x{2014}why not take Alice?\"
Alice Fletcher giggled at movies, especially serious movies, she shook her head in disbelief at almost every thing she saw. It took months for Garp to realize that Alice had something of an impediment or a nervous defect in her speech; perhaps it was psychological. At first Garp thought it was the popcorn.
\"You have a speech problem, I think, Alice,\" he said, driving her home one night.
\"Yeth,\" she said, nodding her head. Often it was a simple lisp; sometimes it was completely different. Occasionally, it wasn't there. Excitement seemed to aggravate it.
\"How's the book coming?\" he asked her.
\"Good,\" she said. At <<one|9t:1>> movie she had blurted out that she'd liked Procrastination.
\"Do you want me to read any of your work?\" Garp asked her.
\"Yeth,\" she said, her small head bobbing. She sat with her short, strong fingers crushing her skirt in her lap, the way Garp had seen her daughter crinkle her clothes\x{2014}the child would sometimes roll her skirt, like a window shade, right up above her panties (though Alice stopped short of this).
\"Was it an accident?\" Garp asked her. \"Your speech problem. Or were you born with it?\"
\"Born with,\" Alice said. The car stopped at the Fletchers' house and Alice tugged Garp's arm. She opened her mouth and pointed inside, as if this would explain everything. Garp saw the rows of small, perfect teeth and a tongue that was fat and fresh-looking like the tongue of a child. He could see nothing peculiar, but it was dark in the car, and he wouldn't have known what was peculiar if he'd seen it. When Alice closed her mouth, he saw she was crying\x{2014}and also smiling, as if this act of self-exposure had required enormous trust. Garp nodded his head as if he understood everything.
\"I see,\" he mumbled. She wiped her tears with the back of one hand, squeezed his hand with her other.
\"Harrithon is having an affair,\" she said.
Garp knew that Harry wasn't having an affair with Helen, but he didn't know what poor Alice thought.
\"Not with Helen,\" Garp said.
\"Na, na,\" Alice said, shaking her head. \"Thumone elth.\"
\"Who?\" Garp asked.
\"A thtudent!\" Alice wailed. \"A thtupid little twat!\"
It had been a couple of years since Garp had molested Little Squab Bones, but in that time he had indulged himself in one other baby-sitter; to his shame, he had even forgotten her name. He felt, honestly, that baby-sitters were an appetite he was forever through with. Yet he sympathized with Harry\x{2014}Harry was his friend, and he was an important friend to Helen. He also sympathized with Alice. Alice was alertly lovable; a kind of terminal vulnerability was clearly a part of her, and she wore it as visibly as a too-tight sweater on her compact body.
\"I'm sorry,\" Garp said. \"Can I do anything?\"
\"Tell him to thtop,\" Alice said.
It had never been hard for Garp to stop, but he had never been a teacher\x{2014}with \"thtudents\" on his mind, or on his hands. Perhaps what Harry was involved with was something else. The only thing Garp could think of\x{2014}that would perhaps make Alice feel better\x{2014}was to confess his own mistakes.
\"It happens, Alice,\" he said.
\"Not to you,\" Alice said.
\"Twice to me,\" Garp said. She looked at him, shocked.
\"Tell the truth,\" she insisted.
\"The truth,\" he said, \"is that it happened twice. A baby-sitter, both times.\"
\"Jesuth Chritht,\" said Alice.
\"But they weren't important,\" Garp said. \"I love Helen.\"
\"Thith is important,\" Alice said. \"He hurth me. And I can't white.\"
Garp knew about writers who couldn't white; this made Garp love Alice, on the spot.
\"Fucking Harry is having an affair,\" Garp told Helen.
\"I know,\" Helen said. \"I've told him to stop, but he keeps going back for more. She's not even a very good student.\"
\"What can we do?\" Garp asked her.
\"Fucking lust,\" Helen said. \"Your mother was right. It is a man's problem. You talk to him.\"
\"Alice told me about your baby-sitters,\" Harry told Garp. \"It's not the same. This is a special girl.\"
\"A student, Harry,\" Garp said. \"Jesus Christ.\"
\"A special student,\" Harry said. \"I'm not like you. I've been honest, I've told Alice from the first. She's just got to accommodate it. I've told her she's free to do this, too.\"
\"She doesn't know any students,\" Garp said.
\"She knows you,\" Harry told him. \"And she's in love with you.\"
\"What can we do?\" Garp asked Helen. \"He's trying to set me up with Alice so he'll feel better about what he's doing.\"
\"At least he's been honest with her,\" Helen told Garp. There was one of those silences wherein a family can identify its separate, breathing parts in the night. Open doors off an upstairs hall: Duncan breathing lazily, an almost-eight-year-old with lots of time to live; Walt breathing those tentative two-year-old breaths, short and excited; Helen, even and cool. Garp held his breath. He knew she knew about the baby-sitters.
\"Harry told you?\" he asked.
\"You might have told me before you told Alice,\" Helen said. \"Who was the second one?\"
\"I forget her name,\" Garp admitted.
\"I think it's shabby,\" Helen said. \"It's really beneath me; it's beneath you. I hope you've outgrown it.\"
\"Yes, I have,\" Garp said. He meant he had outgrown baby-sitters. But lust itself? Ah, well. Jenny Fields had fingered a problem at the heart of her son's heart.
\"We've got to help the Fletchers,\" Helen said. \"We're too fond of them to do nothing about this.\"
Helen, Garp marveled, moved through their life together as if it were an essay she was structuring\x{2014}with an introduction, a presentation of basic priorities, then the thesis.
\"Harry thinks the student is special,\" Garp pointed out.
\"Fucking men,\" Helen said. \"You look after Alice. I'll show Harrison what's special.\"
So one night, after Garp had cooked an elegant Paprika Chicken and sp\x{434}tzle, Helen said to Garp, \"Harrison and I will do the dishes. You take Alice home.\"
\"Take her home?\" Garp said. \"Now?\"
\"Show him your novel,\" Helen said to Alice. \"Show him everything you want. I'm going to show your husband what an asshole he is.\"
\"Hey, come on,\" Harry said. \"We're all friends, we all want to stay friends, right?\"
\"You simple son of a bitch,\" Helen told him. \"You fuck a student and call her special\x{2014}you insult your wife, you insult me. I'll show you what's special.\"
\"Go easy, Helen,\" Garp said.
\"Go with Alice,\" Helen said. \"And let Alice drive her own baby-sitter home.\"
\"Hey, come on!\" Harrison Fletcher said.
\"Shuth up, Harrithon!\" Alice said. She grabbed Garp's hand and stood up from the table.
\"Fucking men,\" said Helen. Garp, as speechless as an Ellen Jamesian, took Alice home.
\"I can take the baby-sitter home, Alice,\" he said. \"Jutht get back fatht,\" Alice said.
\"Very fast, Alice,\" Garp said.
She made him read the first chapter of her novel aloud to her. \"I want to hear it,\" she told him, \"and I can't thay it mythelf.\" So Garp said it to her; it read, he was relieved to hear, beautifully. Alice wrote with such fluency and care that Garp could have sung her sentences, unselfconsciously, and they would have sounded fine.
\"You have a lovely voice, Alice,\" he told her, and she cried. And they made love, of course, and despite what everyone knows about such things, it was special.
\"Wasn't it?\" asked Alice.
\"Yes, it was,\" Garp admitted.
Now, he thought, here is trouble.
\"What can we do?\" Helen asked Garp. She had made Harrison Fletcher forget his \"special\" student; Harrison now thought that Helen was the most special thing in his life.
\"You started it,\" Garp said to her. \"If it's going to stop, you've got to stop it, I think.\"
\"That's easy to say,\" Helen said. \"I like Harrison; he's my best friend, and I don't want to lose that. I'm just not very interested in sleeping with him.\"
\"He's interested,\" Garp said.
\"God, I know,\" Helen said.
\"He thinks you're the best he's had,\" Garp told her. \"Oh, great,\" Helen said. \"That must be lovely for Alice.\"
\"Alice isn't thinking about it,\" Garp said. Alice was thinking about Garp, Garp knew; and Garp was afraid the whole thing would stop. There were times when Garp thought that Alice was the best he'd ever had. \"And what about you?\" Helen asked him. (\"Nothing is equal,\" Garp would write, one day.)
\"I'm fine,\" Garp said. \"I like Alice, I like you, I like Harry.\"
\"And Alice?\" Helen asked.
\"Alice likes me,\" Garp said.
\"Oh boy,\" Helen said. \"So we all like each other, except that I don't care that much for sleeping with Harrison.\"
\"So it's over,\" Garp said, trying to hide the gloom in his voice. Alice had cried to him that it could never be over. (\"Could it? Could it?\" she had cried. \"I can't jutht thtop!\")
\"Well, isn't it still better than it was?\" Helen asked Garp.
\"You made your point,\" Garp said. \"You got Harry off his damn student. Now you've just got to let him down easy.\"
\"And what about you and Alice?\" Helen asked.
\"If it's over for one of us, it's over for all of us,\" Garp said. \"That's only fair.\"
\"I know what's fair,\" Helen said. \"I also know what's human.\"
The good-byes that Garp imagined conducting with Alice were violent scenarios, fraught with Alice's incoherent speech and always ending in desperate lovemaking\x{2014}another failed resolution, wet with sweat and sweet with the lush stickum of sex, oh yeth.
\"I think Alice is a little loony,\" Helen said.
\"Alice is a pretty good writer,\" Garp said. \"She's the real thing.\"
\"Fucking writers,\" Helen mumbled.
\"Harry doesn't appreciate how talented Alice is,\" Garp heard himself say.
\"Oh boy,\" Helen murmured. \"This is the last time I try to save anyone's marriage except my own.\"
It took six months for Helen to let Harry down easy, and in that time Garp saw as much of Alice as he could, while still trying to forewarn her that their foursome was going to be short-lived. He also tried to forewarn himself, because he dreaded the knowledge that he would have to give Alice up.
\"It's not the same, for all four of us,\" he told Alice. \"It will have to stop, and pretty soon.\"
\"Tho what?\" Alice said. \"It hasn't thtopped yet, has it?\"
\"Not yet,\" Garp admitted. He read all her written words aloud to her, and they made love so much he stung in the shower and couldn't stand to wear a jock when he ran.
\"We've got to do and do it,\" Alice said, fervently. \"Do it while we can.\"
\"You know, this can't last,\" Garp tried to warn Harry, while they were playing squash.
\"I know, I know,\" Harry said, \"but it's great while it lasts, isn't it?\"
\"Isn't it?\" Alice demanded. Did Garp love Alice? Oh yeth.
\"Yes, yes,\" Garp said, shaking his head. He thought he did.
But Helen, enjoying it the least of them, suffered it the most; when she finally called an end to it, she couldn't help but show her euphoria. The other three couldn't help but show their resentment: that she should appear so uplifted while they were cast into such gloom. Without formal imposition there existed a six-month moratorium on the couples' seeing each other, except by chance. Naturally, Helen and Harry ran into each other at the English Department. Garp encountered Alice in the supermarket. Once she deliberately crashed her shopping cart into his; little Walt was jarred among the produce and the juice cans, and Alice's daughter looked equally alarmed at the collision.
\"I felt the need of thum contact,\" Alice said. And she called the Garps one night, very late, after Garp and Helen had gone to bed. Helen answered the phone.
\"Is Harrithon there?\" she asked Helen.
\"No, Alice,\" Helen said. \"Is something wrong?\"
\"He's not here,\" Alice said. \"I haven't theen Harrithon all night!\"
\"Let me come over and sit with you,\" Helen suggested. \"Garp can go look for Harrison.\"
\"Can't Garp come over and thit with me?\" Alice asked. \"You look for Harrithon.\"
\"No, I'll come over and sit with you,\" Helen said. \"I think that's better. Garp can go look for Harrison.\"
\"I want Garp,\" Alice said.
\"I'm sorry that you can't have him,\" Helen said.
\"I'm thorry, Helen,\" Alice said. She cried into the phone and said a stream of things that Helen couldn't understand. Helen gave the phone to Garp.
Garp talked to Alice, and listened to her, for about an hour. Nobody looked for \"Harrithon.\" Helen felt she had done a good job of holding herself together for the six months she'd allowed it all to continue; she expected them all to at least control themselves adequately, now that it was over.
\"If Harrison is out screwing students, I'm really going to cross him off,\" Helen said. \"That asshole! And if Alice calls herself a writer, why isn't she writing? If she's got so much to thay, why waste saying it on the phone?\"
Time, Garp knew, would ease everything. Time would also prove him wrong about Alice's writing. She may have had a pretty voice but she couldn't complete anything; she never finished her second novel, not in all the years that the Garps would know the Fletchers\x{2014}or in all the years after. She could say everything beautifully, but\x{2014}as Garp remarked to Helen, when he was finally exasperated with Alice\x{2014}she couldn't get to the end of anything. She couldn't thtop.
Harry, too, would not play his cards wisely or well. The university would deny him tenure\x{2014}a bitter loss for Helen, because she truly loved having Harrison for a friend. But the student Harry had thrown over for Helen had not been let down so easy; she bitched about her seduction to the English Department\x{2014}although, of course, it was her jilting that really made her bitch. This raised eyebrows among Harry's colleagues. And, of course, Helen's support of Harrison Fletcher's case for tenure was quietly not taken seriously\x{2014}her relationship with Harry having also been made clear by the jilted student.
Even Garp's mother, Jenny Fields\x{2014}with all she stood up for, for women\x{2014}agreed with Garp that Helen's own tenure at the university, so easily granted her when she was younger than poor Harry, had been a token gesture on the part of the English Department. Someone had probably told them that they needed a woman on the department at the associate professor level, and Helen had come along. Although Helen did not doubt her own qualifications, she knew it hadn't been her quality that had gotten her tenure.
But Helen had not slept with any students; not yet. Harrison Fletcher had, unforgivably, allowed his sex life to be more special to him than his job. He got another job, anyway. And perhaps what remained of the friendship between the Garps and the Fletchers was actually saved by the Fletchers' having to move away. This way, the couples saw each other about twice a year; distance diffused what might have been hard feelings. Alice could speak her flawless prose to Garp in letters. The temptation to touch each other, even to bash their shopping carts together, was removed from them, and they all settled into being the kind of friends many old friends become: that is, they were friends when they heard from each other\x{2014}or when, occasionally, they got together. And when they were not in touch, they did not think of one another.
Garp threw away his second novel and began a second second novel. Unlike Alice, Garp was a real writer\x{2014}not because he wrote more beautifully than she wrote but because he knew what every artist should know: as Garp put it. \"You only grow by coming to the end of something and by beginning something else.\" Even if these so-called endings and beginnings are illusions. Garp did not write faster than anyone else, or more: he simply always worked with the idea of completion in mind.
His second book was swollen, he knew, with the energy he had left over from Alice.",

After Garp and Helen made love, and Helen fell asleep\x{2014}after the dreams\x{2014}Garp got dressed. When he sat on his bed to tie his track shoes, he sat on Helen's leg and woke her up. She reached out her hand to touch him, then felt his running shorts.

\"To check on Duncan,\" he said. Helen stretched up on her elbows, she looked at her watch. It was <<after one in the morning|9h>> and she knew Duncan was at Ralph's house.

            '[03:30] The World According to Garp - John Irving.epub (OEBPS/Text/Section0011.xhtml) - 3:30 A.M.',
            "Like a gunman hunting his victim, like the child molester the parent dreads, Garp stalks the sleeping spring suburbs, green and dark; the people snore and wish and dream, their lawn mowers at rest; it is too cool for their air conditioners to be running. A few windows are open, a few refrigerators are humming. There is the faint, trapped warble from some televisions tuned in to The Late Show, and the blue-gray glow from the picture tubes throbs from a few of the houses. To Garp this glow looks like cancer, insidious and numbing, putting the world to sleep. Maybe television causes cancer, Garp thinks; but his real irritation is a writer's irritation: he knows that wherever the TV glows, there sits someone who isn't reading.
Garp moves lightly along the street; he wants to meet no one. His running shoes are loosely laced, his track shorts flap; he hasn't worn a jock because he hasn't planned to run. Though the spring air is cool, he wears no shirt. In the blackened houses an occasional dog snorfles as Garp passes by. Fresh from lovemaking, Garp imagines that his scent is as keen as a cut strawberry. He knows the dogs can smell him.
These are well-policed suburbs and for a moment Garp is apprehensive that he might be caught\x{2014}in violation of some unwritten dress code, at least guilty of carrying no identification. He hurries, convinced he's coming to Duncan's aid, rescuing his son from the randy Mrs. Ralph.
A young woman on an unlighted bicycle almost collides with him, her hair floating behind her, her knees bare and shiny, her breath striking Garp as a startling mixture of a fresh-cut lawn and cigarettes. Garp crouches\x{2014}she cries out and wobbles her bike around him; she stands up on her pedals and pumps fast away from him, not looking back. Perhaps she thinks he is a would-be exhibitionist\x{2014}there with his torso and legs bare, ready to drop his shorts. Garp thinks she is coming from some place she shouldn't have been; she is headed for trouble, he imagines. But, thinking of Duncan and Mrs. Ralph, Garp has trouble on his mind at this hour.
When Garp first sees Ralph's house, he believes it should be given the Light of the Block award; every window is glaring, the front door is open, the cancerous television is violently loud. Garp suspects Mrs. Ralph is having a party, but as he creeps closer\x{2014}her lawn festooned with dog messes and mangled sports equipment\x{2014}he feels the house is deserted. The television's lethal rays pulsate through the living room, clogged with piles of shoes and clothes; and crammed against the sagging couch are the casual bodies of Duncan and Ralph, half in their sleeping bags, asleep (of course), but looking as if the television has murdered them. In the sickly TV light their faces look drained of blood.
But where is Mrs. Ralph? Out for the evening? Gone to bed with all the lights on and the door open, leaving the boys to be bathed by the television? Garp wonders if she's remembered to shut the oven off. The living room is pockmarked with ashtrays, Garp fears for cigarettes still smoldering. He stays behind the hedges and slinks to the kitchen window, sniffing for gas.
There is a litter of dishes in the sink, a bottle of gin on the kitchen table, the sour smell of slashed limes. The cord to the overhead light, at one time too short, has been substantially lengthened by one sheer leg and hip of a woman's pair of panty hose\x{2014}severed up the middle, the whereabouts of the other half unclear. The nylon foot, spotted with translucent stains of grease, dangles in the breeze above the gin. There is nothing burning that Garp can smell, unless there's a slow fire under the cat, who lies neatly on top of the stove, artfully spread between burners, its chin resting on the handle of a heavy skillet, its furry belly warmed by the pilot lights. Garp and the cat stare at each other. The cat blinks.
But Garp believes that Mrs. Ralph hasn't the necessary\x{2014}concentration to turn herself into a cat. Her home\x{2014}her life\x{2014}in utter disarray, the woman appears to have abandoned ship, or perhaps passed out upstairs. Is she in bed? Or in the bathtub, drowned? And where is the beast whose dangerous droppings have made a mine field out of the lawn?
Just then there is a thunderous approach down the back staircase of a heavy, falling body that bashes open the stairway entrance door to the kitchen, startling the cat into flight, skidding the greasy iron skillet to the floor. Mrs. Ralph sits bare-assed and wincing on the linoleum, a kimono-style robe wide open and roughly tugged above her thick waist, a miraculously unspilled drink in her hand. She looks at the drink, surprised, and sips it; her large, down-pointing breasts shine\x{2014}they slouch across her freckled chest as she leans back on her elbows and burps. The cat, in a corner of the kitchen, yowls at her, complaining.
\"Oh, shut up, Titsy,\" Mrs. Ralph says to the cat. But when she tries to get up, she groans and lies down flat on her back. Her pubic hair is wet and glistens at Garp; her belly, furrowed with stretch marks, looks as white and parboiled as if Mrs. Ralph has been underwater for a long time. \"I'll get you out of here if it's the last thing I do,\" Mrs. Ralph tells the kitchen ceiling, though Garp assumes she's speaking to the cat. Perhaps she's broken an ankle and is too drunk to feel it, Garp thinks; perhaps she's broken her back.
Garp glides alongside the house to the open front door. He calls inside. \"Anybody home?\" he shouts. The cat bolts between his legs and is gone outside. Garp waits. He hears grunts from the kitchen\x{2014}the strange sounds of flesh slipping.
\"Well, as I live and breathe,\" says Mrs. Ralph, veering into the doorway, her robe of faded flowers more or less drawn together; somewhere, she's ditched her drink.
\"I saw all the lights on and thought there might be trouble,\" Garp mumbles.
\"You're too late,\" Mrs. Ralph tells him. \"Both boys are dead. I should never have let them play with that bomb.\" She probes Garp's unchanging face for any signs of a sense of humor there, but she finds him rather humorless on this subject, \"Okay, you want to see the bodies?\" she asks. She pulls him toward her by the elastic waistband of his running shorts. Garp, aware he's not wearing a jock, stumbles quickly after his pants, bumping into Mrs. Ralph, who lets him go with a snap and wanders into the living room. Her odor confuses him\x{2014}like vanilla spilled in the bottom of a deep, damp paper bag.
Mrs. Ralph seizes Duncan under his arms and with astonishing strength lifts him in his sleeping bag to the mountainous, lumpy couch; Garp helps her lift Ralph, who's heavier. They arrange the boys, foot to foot on the couch, tucking their sleeping bags around them and setting pillows under their heads. Garp turns off the TV and Mrs. Ralph stumbles through the room, killing lights, gathering ashtrays. They are like a married couple, cleaning up after a party. \"Nighty night!\" Mrs. Ralph whispers to the suddenly dark living room, as Garp trips over a hassock, groping his way toward the kitchen lights. \"You can't go yet,\" Mrs. Ralph hisses to him. \"You've got to help me get someone out of here.\" She takes his arm, drops an ashtray; her kimono opens wide. Garp, bending to pick up the ashtray, brushes one of her breasts with his hair. \"I've got this lummox up in my bedroom,\" she tells Garp, \"and he won't go. I can't make him leave.\"
\"A lummox?\" Garp says.
\"He's a real oaf,\" says Mrs. Ralph, \"a fucking wingding.\"
\"A wingding?\" Garp says.
\"Yes, please make him go,\" she asks Garp. She pulls out the elastic waistband of his shorts again, and this time she takes an unconcealed look. \"God, you don't wear too much, do you?\" she asks him. \"Aren't you cold?\" She lays her hand flat on his bare stomach. \"No, you're not,\" she says, shrugging.
Garp edges away from her. \"Who is he?\" Garp asks, fearing he might get involved in evicting Mrs. Ralph's former husband from the house.
\"Come on, I'll show you,\" she whispers. She draws him up the back staircase through a narrow channel that passes between the piled laundry and enormous sacks of pet food. No wonder she fell down here, he thinks.
In Mrs. Ralph's bedroom Garp looks immediately at the sprawled black Labrador retriever on Mrs. Ralph's undulating water bed. The dog rolls listlessly on his side and thumps his tail. Mrs. Ralph mates with her dog, Garp thinks, and she can't get him out of her bed. \"Come on, boy,\" Garp says. \"Get out of here.\" The dog thumps his tail harder and pees a little.
\"Not him,\" Mrs. Ralph says, giving Garp a terrific shove; he catches his balance on the bed, which sloshes. The great dog licks his face. Mrs. Ralph is pointing to an easy chair at the foot of the bed, but Garp first sees the young man reflected in Mrs. Ralph's dressing-table mirror. Sitting naked in the chair, he is combing out the blond end of his thin ponytail, which he holds over his shoulder and sprays with one of Mrs. Ralph's aerosol cans. His belly and thighs have the same slick buttered look that Garp saw on the flesh and fur of Mrs. Ralph, and his young cock is as lean and arched as the backbone of a whippet.
\"Hey, how you doing?\" the kid says to Garp.
\"Fine, thank you,\" Garp says.
\"Get rid of him,\" says Mrs. Ralph.
\"I've been trying to get her to just relax, you know?\" the kid asks Garp. \"I'm trying to get her to just sort of go with it, you know?\"
\"Don't let him talk to you,\" Mrs. Ralph says. \"He'll bore the shit out of you.\"
\"Everyone's so tense,\" the kid tells Garp; he turns in the chair, leans back, and puts his feet on the water bed; the dog licks his long toes. Mrs. Ralph kicks his legs off the bed. \"You see what I mean?\" the kid asks Garp.
\"She wants you to leave,\" Garp says.
\"You her husband?\" the kid asks.
\"That's right,\" says Mrs. Ralph, \"and he'll pull your scrawny little prick off if you don't get out of here.\"
\"You better go,\" Garp tells him. \"I'll help you find your clothes.\"
The kid shuts his eyes, appears to meditate. \"He's really great at that shit,\" Mrs. Ralph tells Garp. \"All this kid's good for is shutting his damn eyes.\"
\"Where are your clothes?\" Garp asks the boy. Perhaps he's seventeen or eighteen, Garp thinks. Maybe he's old enough for college, or a war. The boy dreams on and Garp gently shakes him by the shoulder.
\"Don't touch me, man,\" the boy says, eyes still closed. There is something foolishly threatening in his voice that makes Garp draw back and look at Mrs. Ralph. She shrugs.
\"That's what he said to me, too,\" she says. Like her smiles, Garp notices, Mrs. Ralph's shrugs are instinctual and sincere. Garp grabs the boy's ponytail and tugs it across his throat and around to the back of his neck; he snaps the boy's head into the cradle of his arm and holds him tightly there. The kid's eyes open.
\"Get your clothes, okay?\" Garp tells him.
\"Don't touch me,\" the boy repeats.
\"I am touching you,\" Garp says.
\"Okay, okay,\" says the boy. Garp lets him get up. The boy is several inches taller than Garp, but easily ten pounds lighter. He looks for his clothes but Mrs. Ralph has already found the long purple caftan, absurdly heavy with brocade. The boy climbs into it like armor.
\"It was nice balling you,\" he tells Mrs. Ralph, \"but you should learn to relax more.\" Mrs. Ralph laughs so harshly that the dog stops wagging his tail.
\"You should go back to day one,\" she tells the kid, \"and learn everything all over again, from the beginning.\" She stretches out on the water bed beside the Labrador, who lolls his head across her stomach. \"Oh, cut it out, Bill!\" she tells the dog crossly.
\"She's very unrelaxed,\" the kid informs Garp.
\"You don't know shit about how to relax anybody,\" Mrs. Ralph says. Garp steers the young man out of the room and down the treacherous back staircase, through the kitchen to the open front door.
\"You know, she asked me in,\" the boy explains. \"It was her idea.\"
\"She asked you to leave, too,\" Garp says.
\"You know, you're as unrelaxed as she is,\" the boy tells him.
\"Did the children know what was up?\" Garp asks him. \"Were they asleep when you two went upstairs?\"
\"Don't worry about the kids,\" the boy says. \"Kids are beautiful, man. And they know much more than grownups think they know. Kids are just perfect people until grownups get their hands on them. The kids were just fine. Kids are always just fine.\"
\"You have kids?\" Garp can't help but mutter; until now Garp has felt great patience toward the young man, but Garp isn't patient on the subject of children. He accepts no other authority there. \"Good-bye.\" Garp tells the boy. \"And don't come back.\" He shoves him, but lightly, out the open door.
\"Don't push me!\" the kid shouts, but Garp ducks under the punch and comes up with his arms locked around the kid's waist; to Garp it feels that the kid weighs seventy-five, maybe eighty pounds, though of course he's heavier than that. He bear-hugs the boy and pins his arms behind his back; then he carries him out to the sidewalk. When the kid stops struggling, Garp puts him down.
\"You know where to go?\" Garp asks him. \"Do you need any directions?\" The kid breathes deeply, feels his ribs. \"And don't tell your friends where they can come sniffing around after it,\" Garp says. \"Don't even use the phone.\"
\"I don't even know her name, man,\" the kid whines.
\"And don't call me \"man\",\" says Garp.
\"Okay, man,\" the kid says. Garp feels a pleasant dryness in his throat, which he recognizes as his readiness to touch someone, but he lets the feeling pass.
\"Please walk away from here,\" Garp says.
A block away, the boy calls, \"Good-bye, man!\" Garp knows how quickly he could run him down; anticipation of such a comedy appeals to him, but it would be disappointing if the boy weren't scared and Garp feels no pressing need to hurt him. Garp waves good-bye. The boy raises his middle finger and walks away, his silly robe dragging\x{2014}an early Christian lost in the suburbs.
Look out for the lions, kid, Garp thinks, sending a blessing of protection after the boy. In a few years, he knows, Duncan will be that age; Garp can only hope that he'll find it easier to communicate with Duncan.
Back inside, Mrs. Ralph is crying. Garp hears her talking to the dog. \"Oh, Bill,\" she sobs. \"I'm sorry I abuse you, Bill. You're so nice.\"
\"Good-bye!\" Garp calls up the stairs. \"Your friend's gone, and I'm going too.\"
\"Chickenshit!\" yells Mrs. Ralph. \"How can you leave me like this?\" Her wailing grows louder; soon, Garp thinks, the dog will start to bay.
\"What can I do?\" Garp calls up the stairs.
\"You could at least stay and talk to me!\" Mrs. Ralph shouts. \"You goody-goody chickenshit wingding!\"
What's a wingding? Garp wonders, navigating the stairs.
\"You probably think this happens to me all the time,\" says Mrs. Ralph, in utter rumplement upon the water bed. She sits with her legs crossed, her kimono tight around her, Bill's large head in her lap.
Garp, in fact, does think so, but he shakes his head.
\"I don't get my rocks off by humiliating myself, you know,\" Mrs. Ralph says. \"For God's sake, sit down.\" She pulls Garp to the rocking bed. \"There's not enough water in the damn thing,\" Mrs. Ralph explains. \"My husband used to fill it all the time, because it leaks.\"
\"I'm sorry,\" Garp says. The marriage-counsel man.
\"I hope you never walk out on your wife,\" Mrs. Ralph tells Garp. She takes his hand and holds it in her lap; the dog licks his fingers. \"It's the shittiest thing a man can do,\" says Mrs. Ralph. \"He just told me he'd been faking his interest in me, \"for years\"! he said. And then he said that almost any other woman, young or old, looked better to him than I did. That's not very nice, is it?\" Mrs. Ralph asks Garp.
\"No, it isn't,\" Garp agrees.
\"Please believe me, I never messed around with anyone until he left me,\" Mrs. Ralph tells him.
\"I believe you,\" Garp says.
\"It's very hard on a woman's confidence,\" Mrs. Ralph says. \"Why shouldn't I try to have some fun?\"
\"You should,\" Garp says.
\"But I'm so bad at it!\" Mrs. Ralph confesses, holding her hands to her eyes, rocking on the bed. The dog tries to lick her face but Garp pushes him away; the dog thinks Garp is playing with him and lunges across Mrs. Ralph's lap. Garp whacks the dog's nose\x{2014}too hard\x{2014}and the poor beast whines and slinks away. \"Don't you hurt Bill!\" Mrs. Ralph shouts.
\"I was just trying to help you,\" Garp says.
\"You don't help me by hurting Bill,\" Mrs. Ralph says. \"Jesus, is everyone bananas?\"
Garp slumps back on the water bed, eyes shut tight; the bed rolls like a small sea, and Garp groans. \"I don't know how to help you,\" he confesses. \"I'm very sorry about your troubles, but there's really nothing I can do, is there? If you want to tell me anything, go ahead,\" he says, his eyes still shut tight, \"but nobody can help the way you feel.\"
\"That's a cheerful thing to say to someone,\" Mrs. Ralph says. Bill is breathing in Garp's hair. There is a tentative lick at his ear. Garp, wonders: Is it Bill or Mrs. Ralph? Then he feels her hand grab him under his track shorts, and he thinks, coldly: If I didn't really want her to do that, why did I lie down on my back?
\"Please don't do that,\" he says. She can certainly feel he's not interested, and she lets him go. She lies down beside him, then rolls away, putting her back to him. The bed sloshes violently as Bill tries to wriggle between them, but Mrs. Ralph elbows him so hard in his thick rib cage that the dog coughs and abandons the bed for the floor.
\"Poor Bill. I'm sorry,\" Mrs. Ralph says, crying softly. Bill's hard tail thumps the floor. Mrs. Ralph, as if to complete her self-humiliation, farts. Her sobbing is steady, like the kind of rain Garp knows can last all day. Garp, the marriage counselor, wonders what could give the woman a little confidence.
\"Mrs. Ralph?\" Garp says\x{2014}then tries to bite back what he's said.
\"What?\" she says. \"What'd you say?\" She struggles up to her elbows and turns her head to glare at him. She heard him, he knows. \"Did you say \"Mrs. Ralph\"?\" she asks him. \"Jesus, \"Mrs. Ralph\"!\" she cries. \"You don't even know my name!\"
Garp sits up on the edge of the bed; he feels like joining Bill on the floor. \"I find you very attractive,\" he mumbles to Mrs. Ralph, but he's facing Bill. \"Really!\"
\"Prove it,\" Mrs. Ralph says. \"You goddamn liar. Show me.\"
\"I can't show you,\" Garp says, \"but it's not because I don't find you attractive.\"
\"I don't even give you an erection!\" Mrs. Ralph shouts. \"Here I am half-naked, and when you're beside me\x{2014}on my goddamn bed\x{2014}you don't even have a respectable hard-on.\"
\"I was trying to conceal it from you,\" Garp says.
\"You succeeded,\" Mrs. Ralph says. \"What's my name?\"
Garp feels he has never been so aware of one of his terrible weaknesses: how he needs to have people like him, how he wants to be appreciated. With every word, he knows, he is deeper in trouble, and deeper into an obvious lie. Now he knows what a wingding is.
\"Your husband must be crazy,\" Garp says. \"You look better to me than most women.\"
\"Oh, please stop it,\" says Mrs. Ralph. \"You must be sick.\"
I must be, Garp agrees, but he says, \"You should have confidence in your sexuality, believe me. And more important, you should develop confidence in yourself in other ways.\"
\"There never were any other ways,\" Mrs. Ralph admits. \"I was never so hot at anything but sex, and now I'm not so hot at sex either.\"
\"But you're going to school,\" Garp, says, groping.
\"I'm sure I don't know why,\" Mrs. Ralph says. \"Or is that what you mean by developing confidence in other ways?\" Garp squints hard, wishes for unconsciousness; when he hears the water bed sound like surf, he senses danger and opens his eyes. Mrs. Ralph has undressed, has spread herself out on the bed naked. The little waves are still lapping under her rough-tough body, which confronts Garp like a sturdy rowboat moored on choppy water. \"Show me you've got a hard-on and you can go,\" she says. \"Show me your hard-on and I'll believe you like me.\"
Garp tries to think of an erection; in order to do this, he shuts his eyes and thinks of someone else.
\"You bastard,\" says Mrs. Ralph, but Garp discovers he is already hard; it was not nearly so difficult as he imagined. Opening his eyes, he's forced to recognize that Mrs. Ralph is not without allure. He pulls down his track shorts and shows himself to her. The gesture itself makes him harder; he finds himself liking her damp, curly hair. But Mrs. Ralph seems neither disappointed nor impressed with the demonstration; she is resigned to being let down. She shrugs. She rolls over and turns her great round rump to Garp.
\"Okay, so you can actually get it up,\" she tells him. \"Thank you. You can go home now.\"
Garp feels like touching her. Sickened with embarrassment, Garp feels he could come by just looking at her. He blunders out the door, down the wretched staircase. Is the woman's self-abuse all over for this night? he wonders. Is Duncan safe?
He contemplates extending his vigil until the comforting light of dawn. Stepping on the fallen skillet and clanging it against the stove, he hears not even a sigh from Mrs. Ralph and only a moan from Bill. If the boys were to wake up and need anything, he fears Mrs. Ralph wouldn't hear them.
It's <<3:30 A.M.|2a>> in Mrs. Ralph's finally quiet house when Garp decides to clean the kitchen, to kill the time until dawn. Familiar with a housewife's tasks, Garp fills the sink and starts to wash the dishes.",

            '[04:00] The World According to Garp - John Irving.epub (OEBPS/Text/Section0011.xhtml) - four o\'clock in the morning',
            "When the phone rang, Garp knew it was Helen. It suddenly occurred to him\x{2014}all the terrible things she could have on her mind.
\"Hello,\" Garp said.
\"Would you tell me what's going on, please?\" Helen asked. Garp knew she had been awake a long time. It was <<four o'clock in the morning|6>>.
\"Nothing's going on, Helen,\" Garp said. \"There was a little trouble here, and I didn't want to leave Duncan.\"
\"Where is that woman?\" Helen asked.
\"In bed,\" Garp admitted. \"She passed out.\"
\"From what?\" Helen asked.
\"She'd been drinking,\" Garp said. \"There was a young man here, with her, and she wanted me to get him to leave.\"
\"So then you were alone with her?\" Helen asked.
\"Not for long,\" Garp said. \"She fell asleep.\"
\"I don't imagine it would take very long,\" Helen said, \"with her.\"
Garp let there be silence. He had not experienced Helen's jealousy for a while, but he had no trouble remembering its surprising sharpness.
\"Nothing's going on, Helen,\" Garp said.
\"Tell me what you're doing, exactly, at this moment,\" Helen said.
\"I'm washing the dishes,\" Garp told her. He heard her take a long, controlled breath.
\"I wonder why you're still there,\" Helen said.
\"I didn't want to leave Duncan,\" Garp told her.
\"I think you should bring Duncan home,\" Helen said. \"Right now.\"
\"Helen,\" Garp said. \"I've been good.\" It sounded defensive, even to Garp; also, he knew he hadn't been quite good enough. \"Nothing has happened,\" he added, feeling a little more sure of the truth of that.
\"I won't ask you why you're washing her filthy dishes,\" Helen said.
\"To pass the time,\" Garp said.
But in truth he had not examined what he was doing, until now, and it seemed pointless to him\x{2014}waiting for dawn, as if accidents only happened when it was dark. \"I'm waiting for Duncan to wake up,\" he said, but as soon as he spoke he felt there was no sense to that either.
\"Why not just wake him up?\" Helen asked.
\"I'm good at washing dishes,\" Garp said, trying to introduce some levity.
\"I know all the things you're good at,\" Helen told him, a little too bitterly to pass as a joke.
\"You'll make yourself sick, thinking like this,\" Garp said. \"Helen, really, please stop it. I haven't done anything wrong.\" But Garp had a puritan's niggling memory of the hard-on Mrs. Ralph had given him.
\"I've already made myself sick,\" Helen said, but her voice softened. \"Please come home now,\" she told him.
\"And leave Duncan?\"
\"For Christ's sake, wake him up!\" she said. \"Or carry him.\"
\"I'll be right home,\" Garp told her. \"Please don't worry, don't think what you're thinking. I'll tell you everything that happened. You'll probably love this story.\" But he knew he would have trouble telling her all this story, and that he would have to think very carefully about the parts to leave out.
\"I feel better,\" Helen said. \"I'll see you, soon. Please don't wash another dish.\" Then she hung up and Garp reviewed the kitchen. He thought that his half hour of work hadn't made enough of a difference for Mrs. Ralph to notice that any effort to approach the debris had even been begun.
Garp sought Duncan's clothes among the many, forbidding clots of clothing flung about the living room. He knew Duncan's clothes but he couldn't spot them anywhere; then he remembered that Duncan, like a hamster, stored things in the bottom of his sleeping bag and crawled into the nest with them. Duncan weighed about eighty pounds, plus the bag, plus his junk, but Garp believed he could carry the child home; Duncan could retrieve his bicycle another day. At least, Garp decided, he would not wake Duncan up inside Ralph's house. There might be a scene; Duncan would be fussy about leaving. Mrs. Ralph might even wake up.
Then Garp thought of Mrs. Ralph. Furious at himself, he knew he wanted one last look; his sudden, recurring erection reminded him that he wanted to see her thick, crude body again. He moved quickly to the back staircase. He could have found her fetid room with his nose.
He looked straight at her crotch, her strangely twisted navel, her rather small nipples (for such big breasts). He should have looked first at her eyes; then he might have realized she was wide-awake and staring back at him.
\"Dishes all done?\" asked Mrs. Ralph. \"Come to say good-bye?\"
\"I wanted to see if you were all right,\" he told her.
\"Bullshit,\" she said. \"You wanted another look.\"
\"Yes,\" he confessed; he looked away. \"I'm sorry.\"
\"Don't be,\" she said. \"It's made my day.\" Garp tried to smile.
\"You're too \"sorry\" all the time,\" Mrs. Ralph said. \"What a sorry man you are. Except to your wife,\" Mrs. Ralph said. \"You never once said you were sorry to her.\"
There was a phone beside the water bed. Garp felt he had never so badly misread a person's condition as he had misread Mrs. Ralph's. She was suddenly no drunker than Bill; or she had become miraculously undrunk, or she was enjoying that half hour of clarity between stupor and hangover\x{2014}a half hour Garp had read about, but had always believed was a myth. Another illusion.
\"I'm taking Duncan home,\" Garp told her. She nodded.
\"If I were you,\" she said, \"I'd take him home, too.\"
Garp fought back another \"I'm sorry,\" suppressing it after a short but serious struggle.
\"Do me one favor?\" said Mrs. Ralph. Garp looked at her; she didn't mind. \"Don't tell your wife everything about me, okay? Don't make me out to be such a pig. Maybe you could draw a picture of me with a little sympathy.\"
\"I have pretty good sympathy,\" Garp mumbled.
\"You have a pretty good rod on, too,\" said Mrs. Ralph, staring at Garp's elevated track shorts. \"You better not bring that home.\" Garp said nothing. Garp the puritan felt he deserved to take a few punches. \"Your wife really looks after you, doesn't she?\" said Mrs. Ralph. \"I guess you haven't always been a good boy. You know what my husband would have called you?\" she asked. \"My husband would have called you \"pussy-whipped.\"\"
\"Your husband must have been some asshole,\" Garp said. It felt good to get a punch in, even a weak punch, but Garp felt foolish that he had mistaken this woman for a slob.
Mrs. Ralph got off the bed and stood in front of Garp. Her tits touched his chest. Garp was anxious that his hard-on might poke her. \"You'll be back,\" Mrs. Ralph said. \"Want to bet on it?\" Garp left her without a word.
He wasn't farther than two blocks from Mrs. Ralph's house\x{2014}Duncan crammed down in the sleeping bag, wriggling over Garp's shoulder\x{2014}when the squad car pulled to the curb and its police-blue light flickered over him where he stood caught. A furtive, half-naked kidnapper sneaking away with his bright bundle of stolen goods and stolen looks\x{2014}and a stolen child.
\"What you got there, fella?\" a policeman asked him. There were two of them in the squad car, and a third person who was hard to see in the back seat.
\"My son,\" Garp said. Both policemen got out of the car.
\"Where are you going with him?\" one of the cops asked Garp. \"Is he all right?\" He shined a flashlight in Duncan's face. Duncan was still trying to sleep; he squinted away from the light.
\"He was spending the night at a friend's house,\" Garp said. \"But it didn't work out. I'm carrying him home.\" The policeman shined his light over Garp\x{2014}in his running costume. Shorts, shoes with racing stripes, no shirt.
\"You got identification?\" the policeman asked. Garp set Duncan and the sleeping bag, gently, on someone's lawn.
\"Of course not,\" Garp said. \"If you give me a ride home, I'll show you something.\" The policemen looked at each other. They had been called into the neighborbood, hours ago, when a young woman had reported that she was approached by an exhibitionist\x{2014}at least, by a streaker. Possibly it was a matter of attempted rape. She had escaped him on a bicycle, she said.
\"You been out here a long time?\" one of the policemen asked Garp.
The third person, in the back seat of the police car, looked out the window at what was going on. When he saw Garp, he said, \"Hey, man, how you doing?\" Duncan started to wake up.
\"Ralph?\" Duncan said.
One policeman knelt beside the boy and pointed the flashlight up at Garp. \"Is this your father?\" the cop asked Duncan. The boy was rather wild-eyed; he darted his eyes from his father to the cops to the blue light flashing on the squad car.
The other policeman went over to the person in the back seat of the car. It was the boy in the purple caftan. The police had picked him up while they were cruising the neighborhood for the exhibitionist. The boy hadn't been able to tell them where he lived\x{2014}because he didn't really live anywhere. \"Do you know that man with the child there?\" the policeman asked the boy.
\"Yeah, he's a real tough guy,\" the kid said.
\"It's all right, Duncan,\" Garp said. \"Don't be scared. I'm just taking you home.\"
\"Son?\" the policeman asked Duncan. \"Is this your father?\"
\"You're scaring him,\" Garp told the cop.
\"I'm not scared,\" Duncan said. \"Why are you taking me home?\" he asked his father. It seemed that everyone wanted to hear this.
\"Ralph's mother was upset,\" Garp said; he hoped that would be enough, but the rejected lover in the police car started to laugh. The policeman with the flashlight shone his light on the lover boy and asked Garp if he knew him. Garp thought: There is no end to this in sight.
\"My name is Garp,\" Garp said, irritably. \"T. S. Garp. I am married. I have two children. One of them\x{2014}this one, named Duncan, the older\x{2014}was spending the night with a friend. I was convinced that this friend's mother was unfit to look after my son. I went to the house and took my son home. Or, I'm still trying to get home.
\"That boy,\" Garp said, pointing to the police car, \"was visiting the mother of the friend of my son when I arrived. The mother wanted the boy to leave\x{2014}that boy,\" Garp said, again pointing at the kid in the police car, \"and he left.\"
\"What is this mother's name?\" a policeman asked; he was trying to write everything down in a giant pad. After a polite silence, the policeman looked up at Garp.
\"Duncan?\" Garp asked his son. \"What is Ralph's name?\"
\"Well, it's being changed,\" Duncan said. \"He used to have his father's name, but his mother's trying to get it changed.\"
\"Yes, but what is his father's name?\" Garp asked. \"Ralph,\" Duncan said. Garp shut his eyes.
\"Ralph Ralph?\" the policeman with the pad said.
\"No, Duncan, please think,\" Garp said. \"Ralph's last name is what?\"
\"Well, I think that's the name being changed,\" Duncan said.
\"Duncan, what is it being changed from?\" Garp asked.
\"You could ask Ralph,\" Duncan suggested. Garp wanted to scream.
\"Did you say your name was Garp?\" one of the policemen asked.
\"Yes,\" Garp admitted.
\"And the initials are T. S.?\" the policeman asked. Garp knew what would happen next; he felt very tired.
\"Yes, T. S.,\" he said. \"Just T. S.\"
\"Hey, Tough Shit!\" howled the kid in the car, falling back in the seat, swooning with laughter.
\"What does the first initial stand for, Mr. Garp?\" the policeman asked. \"Nothing,\" Garp said.
\"Nothing?\" the policeman said.
\"They're just initials,\" Garp said. \"They're all my mother gave me.\"
\"Your first name is T?\" the policeman asked.
\"People call me Garp,\" Garp said.
\"What a story, man!\" cried the boy in the caftan, but the policeman nearest the squad car rapped on the roof at him.
\"You put your dirty feet on that seat again, sonny,\" he said, \"and I'll have you licking the crud off.\"
\"Garp?\" said the policeman interviewing Garp. \"I know who you are!\" he cried suddenly. Garp felt very anxious. \"You're the one who got that molester in that park!\"
\"Yes!\" said Garp. \"That was me. But it wasn't here, and it was years ago.\"
\"I remember it as if it were yesterday,\" the policeman said.
\"What's this?\" the other policeman asked.
\"You're too young,\" the cop told him. \"This is man named Garp who grabbed that molester in that park\x{2014}where was it? That child molester, that's who it was. And what was it you did?\" he asked Garp, curiously. \"I mean, there was something funny, wasn't there?\"
\"Funny?\" said Garp.
\"For a living,\" the policeman said. \"What did you do for a living?\"
\"I'm a writer,\" Garp said.
\"Oh, yeah,\" the policeman remembered. \"Are you still a writer?\"
\"Yes,\" Garp confessed. He knew, at least, that he wasn't a marriage counselor.
\"Well, I'll be,\" the policeman said, but something was still bothering him; Garp could tell something was wrong.
\"I had a beard then,\" Garp offered.
\"That's it!\" the policeman cried. \"And you've shaved it or\"
\"Right,\" said Garp.
The policemen had a conference in the red glow of the taillights of the squad car. They decided to give Garp and Duncan a ride home, but they said Garp would still have to show them some information regarding his identity.
\"I just don't recognize you\x{2014}from the pictures\x{2014}without the beard,\" the older policeman said.
\"Well, it was years ago,\" Garp said, sadly, \"and in another town.\"
Garp felt uneasy that the young man in the caftan would get to see the house the Garps lived in. Garp imagined the young man would show up one day, asking for something.
\"You remember me?\" the kid asked Duncan.
\"I don't think so,\" Duncan said, politely.
\"Well, you were almost asleep,\" the boy admitted. To Garp he said, \"You're too uptight about children, man. Children make it just fine. This your only child?\"
\"No, I have another one,\" Garp said.
\"Man, you ought to have a dozen other ones,\" the boy said. \"Then maybe you wouldn't get so uptight about just one, you know?\" This sounded to Garp like what his mother called the Percy Theory of Children.
\"Take your next left,\" Garp told the policeman who was driving, \"then a right, and it's on the corner.\" The other policeman handed Duncan a lollipop.
\"Thank you,\" Duncan said.
\"What about me?\" the kid in the caftan asked. \"I like lollipops.\" The policeman glared; when he turned his back, Duncan gave the kid his lollipop. Duncan was no fan of lollipops, he never had been.
\"Thank you,\" the boy whispered. \"You see, man?\" he said to Garp. \"Kids are just beautiful.\"
So is Helen, Garp tbought\x{2014}in the doorway with the light behind her. Her blue, floor-length robe had a high, roll-up collar; Helen had the collar turned up as if she were cold. She also had her glasses on, so that Garp knew she'd been watching for them.
\"Man,\" whispered the kid in the caftan, elbowing Garp as he got out of the car. \"What's that lovely lady like when she gets her glasses off?\"
\"Mom! We got arrested,\" Duncan called to Helen. The squad car waited at the curb for Garp to get his identification.
\"We did not get arrested,\" Garp said. \"We got a ride, Duncan. Everything's fine,\" he said angrily, to Helen. He ran upstairs to find his wallet among his clothes.
\"Is that how you went out?\" Helen called after him. \"Dressed like that?\"
\"The police thought he was kidnapping me,\" Duncan said.
\"Did they come to the house?\" Helen asked him.
\"No, Dad was carrying me home,\" Duncan said. \"Boy, is Dad weird.\"
Garp thundered down the stairs and ran out the door. \"A case of mistaken identity,\" Garp muttered to Helen. \"They must have been looking for someone else. For God's sake, don't get upset.\"
\"I'm not upset,\" Helen said, sharply.
Garp showed the police his identification.
\"Well, I'll be,\" the older policeman said. \"It is just T. S., isn't it? I suppose it's easier that way.\"
\"Sometimes it isn't,\" Garp said.
As the police car was leaving, the kid called out to Garp. \"You're not a bad guy, man, if you'd just learn to relax!\"
Garp's impression of Helen's body, lean and tense and shivering in the blue robe, did not relax him. Duncan was wide-awake and jabbering: he was hungry, too. So was Garp. In the pre-dawn kitchen, Helen coolly watched them eat. Duncan told the plot of a long TV movie: Garp suspected that it was actually two movies, and Duncan had fallen asleep before one was over and woken up after the other one had begun. He tried to imagine where and when Mrs. Ralph's activities fitted into Duncan's movies.
Helen didn't ask any questions. In part, Garp knew, this was because there was nothing she could say in front of Duncan. But in part, like Garp, she was severely editing what she wanted to say. They were both grateful for Duncan's presence; by the time they got to speak freely to each other, the long wait might make them kinder, and more careful.
At dawn they couldn't wait any longer and they began to talk to each other through Duncan.
\"Tell Mommy what the kitchen looked like,\" Garp said. \"And tell her about the dog.\"
\"Bill?\"
\"Right,\" Garp said. \"Tell her about old Bill.\"
\"What was Ralph's mother wearing while you were there?\" Helen asked Duncan. She smiled at Garp. \"I hope she wore more clothes than Daddy.\"
\"What did you have for supper?\" Garp asked Duncan.
\"Are the bedrooms upstairs or downstairs?\" Helen asked. \"Or both?\" Garp tried to give her a look that said: Please don't get started. He could feel her edging the old, worn weapons into easy reach. She had a baby-sitter or two she could recall for him, and he felt her moving the baby-sitters into place. If she brought up one of the old, wounding names, Garp had no names ready for retaliation. Helen had no baby-sitters against her; not yet. In Garp's mind, Harrison Fletcher didn't count.
\"How many telephones are there?\" Helen asked Duncan. \"Is there a phone in the kitchen and one in the bedroom? Or is the only phone in the bedroom?\"
When Duncan finally went to his room, Helen and Garp were left with less than half an hour before Walt would wake up. But Helen had the names of her enemies ready. There is plenty of time to do damage when you know where the war wounds are.
\"I love you so much, and I know you so well,\" Helen began.",

            "WHEN Walt caught colds, Garp slept badly. It was as if he were trying to breathe for the boy, and for himself. Garp would get up in the night to kiss and nuzzle the child; anyone seeing Garp would have thought that he could make Walt's cold go away by catching it himself.
\"Oh, God,\" Helen said. \"It's just a cold. Duncan had colds all winter when he was five.\" Nearing eleven, Duncan seemed to have outgrown colds; but Walt, at <<five|9:1>>, was fully in the throes of cold after cold\x{2014}or it was one long cold that went away and came back. By the March mud season, Walt's resistance struck Garp as altogether gone; the child hacked himself and Garp awake each night with a wet, wrenching cough. Garp sometimes fell asleep listening to Walt's chest, and he would wake up, frightened, when he could no longer hear the thump of the boy's heart; but the child had merely pushed his father's heavy head off his chest so that he could roll over and sleep more comfortably.
Both the doctor and Helen told Garp, \"It's just a cough.\"
But the imperfection in Walt's nightly breathing scared Garp right out of his sleep. He was usually awake, therefore, when Roberta called; the late-night anguish of the large and powerful Ms. Muldoon was no longer frightening to Garp\x{2014}he had come to expect it\x{2014}but Garp's own fretful sleeplessness made Helen short-tempered.
\"If you were back at work, on a book, you'd be too tired to lie awake half the night,\" she said. It was his imagination that was keeping him up, Helen told him; one sign that he hadn't been writing enough, Garp knew, was when he had too much imagination left over for other things. For example, the onslaught of dreams: Garp now dreamed only of horrors happening to his children.
In a dream, there was one horror that took place while Garp was reading a pornographic magazine. He was just looking at the same picture, over and over again; the picture was very pornographic. The wrestlers on the university team, with whom Garp occasionally worked out, had a peculiar vocabulary for such pictures. This vocabulary, Garp noted, had not changed since his days at Steering, when the wrestlers on Garp's team spoke of such pictures in the same fashion. What had changed was the increased availability of the pictures, but the names were the same.
The picture Garp looked at in the dream was considered among the highest in the rankings of pornographic pictures. Among pictures of naked women, there were names for how much you could see. If you could see the pubic hair, but not the sex parts, that was called a bush shot\x{2014}or just a bush. If you could see the sex parts, which were sometimes partially hidden by the hair, that was a beaver; a beaver was better than just a bush; a beaver was the whole thing: the hair and the parts. If the parts were open, that was called a split beaver. And if the whole thing glistened, that was the best of all, in the world of pornography: that was a wet, split beaver. The wetness implied that the woman was not only naked and exposed and open, but she was also ready.
In his dream, Garp was looking at what the wrestlers called a wet, split beaver when he heard children crying. He did not know whose children they were, but Helen and his mother, Jenny Fields, were with them; they all came down the stairs and filed past him, where he struggled to hide from them what he'd been looking at. They had been upstairs and something terrible had awakened them; they were on their way farther downstairs\x{2014}going to the basement as if the basement were a bomb shelter. And with that thought, Garp heard the dull crump of bombing\x{2014}he noted the crumbling plaster, he saw the flickering lights\x{2014}and he grasped the terror of what was approaching them. The children, two by two, marched whimpering after Helen and Jenny, who led them to the bomb shelter as soberly as nurses. If they looked at Garp at all, they regarded him with vague sadness and with scorn, as if he had let them all down and was powerless to help them now.
Perhaps he had been looking at the wet, split beaver instead of watching for enemy planes? This, true to the nature of dreams, was forever unclear: precisely why he felt so guilty, and why they looked at him as if they'd been so abused.
At the end of the line of children were Walt and Duncan, holding hands; the so-called buddy system, as it is employed at summer camps, appeared in Garp's dream to be the natural reaction to a disaster among children. Little Walt was crying, the way Garp had heard him cry when he was caught in the grip of a nightmare, unable to wake up. \"I'm having a bad dream,\" he sniveled. He looked at his father and almost shouted to him, \"I'm having a bad dream!\"
But in Garp's dream, Garp could not wake the child from this one. Duncan looked stoically over his shoulder at his father, a silent and bravely doomed expression on his beautiful young face. Duncan was appearing very grown-up lately. Duncan's look was a secret between Duncan and Garp: that they both knew it was not a dream, and that Walt could not be helped.
\"Wake me up!\" Walt cried, but the long file of children was disappearing into the bomb shelter. Twisting in Duncan's grip (Walt came to about the height of Duncan's elbow), Walt looked back at his father. \"I'm having a dream!\" Walt screamed, as if to convince himself. Garp could do nothing; he said nothing; he made no attempt to follow them\x{2014}down these last stairs. And the dropping plaster coated everything white. The bombs kept falling.
\"You're having a dream!\" Garp screamed after little Walt. \"It's just a bad dream!\" he cried, though he knew he was lying.
Then Helen would kick him and he'd wake up.
Perhaps Helen feared that Garp's run-amuck imagination would turn away from Walt and turn on her. Because if Garp had given half the worry to Helen that he seemed compelled to give to Walt, Garp might have realized that something was going on.
Helen thought she was in control of what was going on; she at least had controlled how it began (opening her office door, as usual, to the slouching Michael Milton, and bidding him enter her room). Once inside, she closed the door behind him and kissed him quickly on the mouth, holding his slim neck so that he couldn't even escape for breath, and grinding her knee between his legs; he kicked over the wastebasket and dropped his notebook.
\"There's nothing more to discuss,\" Helen said, taking a breath. She raced her tongue across his upper lip; Helen was trying to decide if she liked his mustache. She decided she liked it; or, at least, she liked it for now. \"We'll go to your apartment. Nowhere else,\" she told him.
\"It's across the river,\" he said.
\"I know where it is,\" she said. \"Is it clean?\"
\"Of course,\" he said. \"And it's got a great view of the river.\"
\"I don't care about the view,\" Helen said. \"I want it clean.\"
\"It's pretty clean,\" he said. \"I can clean it better.\"
\"We can only use your car,\" she said.
\"I don't have a car,\" he said.
\"I know you don't,\" Helen said. \"You'll have to get one.\"
He was smiling now; he'd been surprised, but now he was feeling sure of himself again. \"Well, I don't have to get one now, do I?\" he asked, nuzzling his mustache against her neck; he touched her breasts. Helen unattached herself from his embrace.
\"Get one whenever you want,\" she said. \"We'll never use mine, and I won't be seen walking with you all over town, or riding on the buses. If anyone knows about this, it's over. Do you understand?\" She sat down at her desk, and he did not feel invited to walk around her desk to touch her; he sat in the chair her students usually sat in.
\"Sure, I understand,\" he said.
\"I love my husband and will never hurt him,\" Helen told him. Michael Milton knew better than to smile.
\"I'll get a car, right away,\" he said.
\"And clean your apartment, or have it cleaned,\" she said.
\"Absolutely,\" he said. Now he dared to smile, a little. \"What kind of car do you want me to get?\" he asked her.
\"I don't care about that,\" she told him. \"Just get one that runs; get one that isn't in the garage all the time. And don't get one with bucket seats. Get one with a long seat in front.\" He looked more surprised and puzzled than ever, so she explained to him: \"I want to be able to lie down, comfortably, across the front seat,\" she said. \"I'll put my head in your lap so that no one will see me sitting up beside you. Do you understand?\"
\"Don't worry,\" he said, smiling again.
\"It's a small town,\" Helen said. \"No one must know.\"
\"It's not that small a town,\" Michael Milton said, confidently.
\"Every town is a small town,\" Helen said, \"and this one is smaller than you think. Do you want me to tell you?\"
\"Tell me what?\" he asked her.
\"You're sleeping with Margie Tallworth,\" Helen said. \"She's in my Comp. Lit. 205; she's a junior,\" Helen said. \"And you see another very young undergraduate\x{2014}she's in Dirkson's English 150; I think she's a freshman, but I don't know if you've slept with her. Not for lack of trying, if you haven't,\" Helen added. \"To my knowledge you've not touched any of your fellow graduate students; not yet,\" Helen said. \"But there's surely someone I've missed, or there has been.\"
Michael Milton was both sheepish and proud at the same time, and the usual command he held over his expressions escaped him so completely that Helen didn't like the expression she saw on his face and she looked away.
\"That's how small this town, and every town, is,\" Helen said. \"If you have me,\" she told him, \"you can't have any of those others. I know what young girls notice, and I know how much they're inclined to say.\"
\"Yes,\" Michael Milton said; he appeared ready to take notes.
Helen suddenly thought of something, and she looked momentarily startled. \"You do have a driver's license?\" she asked.
\"Oh yes!\" Michael Milton said. They both laughed, and Helen relaxed again; but when he came around her desk to kiss her, she shook her head and waved him back.
\"And you won't ever touch me here,\" she said. \"There will be nothing intimate in this office. I don't lock my door. I don't even like to have it shut. Please open it, now,\" she asked him, and he did as he was told.
He got a car, a huge Buick Roadmaster, the old kind of station wagon\x{2014}with real wooden slats on the side. It was a 1951 Buick Dynaflow, heavy and shiny with pre-Korea chrome and real oak. It weighed 5,550 pounds, or almost three tons. It held seven quarts of oil and nineteen gallons of gasoline. Its original price was \$2,850 but Michael Milton picked it up for less than six hundred dollars.
\"It's a straight-eight cylinder, three-twenty cubic, power steering, with a single-throat Carter carb,\" the salesman told Michael. \"It's not too badly rusted.\"
In fact, it was the dull, inconspicuous color of clotted blood, more than six feet wide and seventeen feet long. The front seat was so long and deep that Helen could lie across it, almost without having to bend her knees\x{2014}or without having to put her head in Michael Milton's lap, though she did this anyway.
She did not put her head in his lap because she had to; she liked her view of the dashboard, and being close to the old smell of the maroon leather of the big, slick seat. She put her head in his lap because she liked feeling Michael's leg stiffen and relax, his thigh shifting just slightly between the brake and the accelerator. It was a quiet lap to put your head in because the car had no clutch; the driver needed to move just one leg, and just occasionally. Michael Milton thoughtfully carried his loose change in his left front pocket, so there were only the soft wales of his corduroy slacks, which made a faint impression on the skin of Helen's cheek\x{2014}and sometimes his rising erection would touch her ear, or reach up into the hair on the back of her neck.
Sometimes she imagined taking him into her mouth while they drove across town in the big car with the gaping chrome grille like the mouth of a feeding fish\x{2014}Buick Eight in script across the teeth. But that, Helen knew, would not be safe.
The first indication that the whole thing might not be safe was when Margie Tallworth dropped Helen's Comp. Lit. 205, without so much as a note of explanation concerning what she might not have liked about the course. Helen feared it was not the course that Margie hadn't liked, and she called the young Miss Tallworth into her office to ask her for an explanation.
Margie Tallworth, a junior, knew enough about school to know that no explanation was required; up to a certain point in any semester, a student was free to drop any course without the instructor's permission. \"Do I have to have a reason?\" the girl asked Helen, sullenly.
\"No, you don't,\" Helen said. \"But if you had a reason, I just wanted to hear it.\"
\"I don't have to have a reason,\" Margie Tallworth said. She held Helen's gaze longer than most students could hold it; then she got up to leave. She was pretty and small and rather well dressed for a student, Helen thought. If there was any consistency to Michael Milton's former girl friend and his present taste, it appeared only that he liked women to wear nice clothes.
\"Well, I'm sorry it didn't work out,\" Helen said, truthfully, as Margie was leaving; she was still fishing for what the girl might actually know.
She knew, Helen thought, and quickly accused Michael.
\"You've blown it already,\" she told him coldly, because she could speak coldly to him\x{2014}over the phone. \"Just how did you drop Margie Tallworth?\"
\"Very gently,\" Michael Milton said, smugly. \"But a drop is a drop, no matter how different the ways of doing it are.\" Helen did not appreciate it when he attempted to instruct her\x{2014}except sexually; she indulged the boy that, and he seemed to need to be dominant there. That was different for her, and she didn't really mind. He was sometimes rough, but not ever dangerous, she thought; and if she firmly resisted something, he stopped. Once she had had to tell him, \"No! I don't like that, I won't do that.\" But she had added, \"Please,\" because she wasn't that sure of him. He had stopped; he had been forceful with her, but in another way\x{2014}in a way that was all right with her. It was exciting that she couldn't trust him completely. But not trusting him to be silent was another matter; if she knew he had talked about her, that would be that.
\"I didn't tell her anything,\" Michael insisted. \"I said, \"Margie, it's all over,\" or something like that. I didn't even tell her there was another woman, and I certainly said nothing about you.\"
\"But she's probably heard you talk about me, before,\" Helen said. \"Before this started, I mean.\"
\"She never liked your course, anyway,\" Michael said. \"We did talk about that once.\"
\"She never liked the course?\" Helen said. This truly surprised her.
\"Well, she's not very bright,\" Michael said, impatiently.
\"She'd better not know,\" Helen said. \"I mean it: you better find out.\"
But he found out nothing. Margie Tallworth refused to speak to him. He tried to tell her, on the phone, that it was all because an old girl friend had come back to him\x{2014}she had arrived from out of town; she'd had no place to stay; one thing had led to another. But Margie Tallworth had hung up on him before he could polish the story.
Helen smoked a little more. She watched Garp anxiously for a few days\x{2014}and once she felt actual guilt, when she made love to Garp; she felt guilty that she had made love to him not because she wanted to but because she wanted to reassure him, if he had been thinking that anything was wrong.
He hadn't been thinking, not much. Or: he had thought, but only once, about the bruises on the small, tight backs of Helen's thighs; though he was strong, Garp was a very gentle man with his children and his wife. He also knew what fingermark bruises looked like because he was a wrestler. It was a day or so later that he noticed the same small fingermark bruises on the backs of Duncan's arms\x{2014}just where Garp held him when Garp wrestled with the boy\x{2014}and Garp concluded that he gripped the people he loved harder than he meant to. He concluded that the fingermarks on Helen were also his.
He was too vain a man to be easily jealous. And the name he had woken with\x{2014}on his lips, one morning\x{2014}had eluded him. There were no more papers by Michael Milton around the house, keeping Helen up at night. In fact, she was going to bed earlier and earlier; she needed her rest.
As for Helen, she developed a fondness for the bare, sharp shaft of the Volvo's stick shift; its bite at the end of the day, driving home from her office, felt good against the heel of her hand, and she often pressed against it until she felt it was only a hair away from the pressure necessary to break her skin. She could bring tears to her eyes, this way, and it made her feel clean again, when she arrived home\x{2014}when the boys would wave and shout at her, from the window where the TV was; and when Garp would announce what dinner he had prepared for them all, when Helen walked into the kitchen.
Margie Tallworth's possible knowledge had frightened Helen, because although Helen had said to Michael\x{2014}and to herself\x{2014}that it would be over the instant anyone knew, Helen now knew that it would be more difficult to end than she had first imagined. She hugged Garp in his kitchen and hoped for Margie Tallworth's ignorance.
Margie Tallworth was ignorant, but she was not ignorant of Michael Milton's relationship with Helen. She was ignorant of many things but she knew about that. She was ignorant in that she thought her own shallow infatuation with Michael Milton had \"surpassed,\" as she would say, \"the sexual\"; whereas, she assumed, Helen was merely amusing herself with Michael. In truth, Margie Tallworth had absolutely wallowed in, as she would say, \"the sexual\"; it is difficult, in fact, to know what else her relationship with Michael Milton had been about. But she was not altogether wrong in assuming that this was what Helen's relationship with Michael Milton was also about. Margie Tallworth was ignorant in that she assumed too much, too much of the time; but in this case she had assumed correctly.
Back when Michael Milton and Helen were actually talking about Michael's \"work,\" Margie assumed\x{2014}even then\x{2014}that they were fucking. Margie Tallworth did not believe there was another kind of relationship that one could have with Michael Milton. In this one way, she was not ignorant. She may have known the kind of relationship Helen had with Michael before Helen knew it herself.
And through the one-way glass of the fourth-floor ladies' room, in the English and Literature Building, it was possible for Margie Tallworth to look through the tinted windshield of the three-ton Buick, gliding like the coffin of a king out of the parking lot. Margie could see Mrs. Garp's slender legs stretched along the long front seat. It was a peculiar way to ride in a car with other than the best of friends.
Margie knew their habits better than she understood her own; she took long walks, to try to forget Michael Milton, and to familiarize herself with the whereabouts of Helen's house. She was soon familiar with the habits of Helen's husband, too, because Garp's habits were much more constant than anyone's: he padded back and forth, from room to room, in the mornings; perhaps he was out of a job. That fitted Margie Tallworth's assumptions of the likely cuckold: a man who was out of work. At <<midday|13>> he burst out the door in track clothes and ran away; miles later, he returned and read his mail, which nearly always came when he was gone. Then he padded back and forth in the house again; he undressed, in pieces, on the way to the shower, and he was slow to dress when he was out of the shower. One thing did not fit her image of the cuckold: Garp had a good body. And why did he spend so much time in the kitchen? Margie Tallworth wondered if perhaps he was an unemployed cook.
Then his children came home and they broke Margie Tallworth's soft little heart. He looked quite nice when he played with his children, which also fitted Margie's assumptions of what a cuckold was like: someone who had witless good fun with his children while his wife was out getting planked. \"Planked\" was also a word that the wrestlers Garp knew used, and they had used it back at those blood-and-blue days at Steering, too. Someone was always bragging about planking a wet, split beaver.
So one day, when Garp burst out the door in his track clothes, Margie Tallworth waited only as long as it took him to run away; then she went up on the Garps' porch with a perfumed note, which she intended to drop in his mail. She had thought very carefully that he would have time to read the note and (hopefully) recover himself before his children came home. This was how she assumed such news was absorbed: suddenly! Then there was a reasonable period of recovery and one got ready to face the children. Here was another case of something Margie Tallworth was ignorant of.
The note itself had given her trouble because she was not good with words. And it was perfumed not by intention but simply because every piece of paper Margie Tallworth owned was perfumed; if she had thought about it, she would have realized perfume was inappropriate to this note, but that was another of the things she was ignorant of. Even her schoolwork was perfumed; when Helen had read Margie Tallworth's first essay for Comp. Lit. 205, she had cringed at its scent.
What Margie's note to Garp said was:",

            "The next thing you know, Garp thought, they'll be organized like the religious morons who bring those righteous pamphlets about Jesus to one's very door. It sickened him, for example, that the Ellen Jamesians were now reaching girls as young as this one; she was too young to know, he thought, whether she wanted a tongue in her life or not. He shook his head and waved the note away.
\"Yes, yes, I know, I know,\" Garp said. \"So what?\" Poor Margie Tallworth was unprepared for this. She had come like an avenging angel\x{2014}her terrible duty, and what a burden it was to her!\x{2014}to bring the bad news that somehow must be made known. But he knew already! And he didn't even care.
She clutched her note in both hands, so tightly to her pretty, trembling breasts that more of the perfume was expressed from it\x{2014}or from her\x{2014}and a wave of her young-girl smell passed over Garp, who stood glaring at her.
\"I said, \"So what?\" Garp said. \"Do you actually expect me to have respect for someone who cuts her own tongue off?\"
Margie forced a word out. \"What?\" she said; she was frightened now. Now she guessed why the poor man padded around his house all day, out of work: he was insane.
Garp had distinctly heard the word; it was not a gagged \"Aaahhh\" or even a little \"Aaa\"\x{2014}it was not the word of an amputated tongue. It was a whole word.
\"What?\" he said.
\"What?\" she said, again.
He stared at the note she held against herself. \"You can talk?\" he said.
\"Of course,\" she croaked.
\"What's that?\" he asked, and pointed to her note. But now she was afraid of him\x{2014}an insane cuckold. God knows what he might do. Murder the children, or murder her; he looked strong enough to murder Michael Milton with one arm. And every man looked evil when he was questioning you. She backed away from him, off the porch.
\"Wait!\" Garp cried. \"Is that a note for me? What is that? Is it something for Helen? Who are you?\"
Margie Tallworth shook her head. \"It's a mistake,\" she whispered, and when she turned to flee, she collided with the wet mailman, spilling his bag and knocking herself back into Garp. Garp had a vision of Duna, the senile bear, bowling a mailman down a Viennese staircase\x{2014}outlawed forever. But all that happened to Margie Tallworth was that she fell to the floor of the porch; her stockings tore and she skinned one knee.
The mailman, who assumed he'd arrived at an awkward moment, fumbled for Garp's mail among his strewn letters, but Garp was now only interested in what message the crying girl had for him. \"What is it?\" he asked her, gently; he tried to help her to her feet, but she wanted to sit where she was. She kept sobbing.
\"I'm sorry,\" Margie Tallworth said. She had lost her nerve; she had spent a minute too long around Garp, and now that she thought she rather liked him, it was hard for her to imagine giving him this news.
\"Your knee's not too bad,\" Garp said, \"but let me get something to clean you up.\" He went inside for antiseptic for her cut, and bandages, but she took this opportunity to limp away. She could not face him with this news, but she could not withhold it from him, either. She left her note for him. The mailman watched her hobble down the side street toward the corner where the buses stopped; he wondered briefly what the Garps were up to. They seemed to get more mail than other families, too.
It was all those letters Garp wrote, which poor John Wolf, his editor, struggled to answer. And there were copies of books to review; Garp gave them to Helen, who at least read them. There were Helen's magazines; it seemed to Garp there were a great many. There were Garp's two magazines, his only subscriptions: Gourmet and Amateur Wrestling News. There were, of course, bills. And a letter rather frequently from Jenny; it was all she wrote these days. And a letter now and then, short and sweet, from Ernie Holm.
Sometimes Harry Fletcher wrote them both, and Alice still wrote with exquisite fluency, about nothing at all, to Garp.
And now among the usual was a note, reeking of perfume and wet with tears. Garp put down the bottle of antiseptic and the bandages; he did not bother to look for the girl. He held the crumpled note and thought he knew, more or less, what it would be about.
He wondered why he hadn't thought of it before, because there were so many things that pointed to it; now that he thought of it, he supposed he had thought of it before, only not quite this consciously. The slow unwrapping of the note\x{2014}so it wouldn't tear\x{2014}made sounds as crisp as autumn, though all around Garp it was a cold March, the hurt ground thawing to mud. The little note snapped like bones as he opened it. With the escaping perfume, Garp imagined he could still hear the girl's sharp little yelp: \"What?\"
He knew \"what\"; what he didn't know was \"with whom\"\x{2014}that name, which had kicked around in his mind, one morning, but then was gone. The note, of course, would provide him with the name: Michael Milton. It sounded to Garp like a special kind of new ice cream at that shop he took the boys to. There was Strawberry Swirl, Chock-full of Chocolate, Mocha Madness, and Michael Milton. It was a disgusting name\x{2014}a flavor Garp could taste\x{2014}and Garp tramped to the storm sewer and wadded the vile-smelling note into pieces and stuffed them through the grate. Then he went inside the house and read the name in a phone book, over and over again.
It seemed to him now that Helen had been \"involved with\" someone for a long time; it seemed that he had known it for some time, too. But the name! Michael Milton! Garp had classified him\x{2014}to Helen\x{2014}at a party where Garp had been introduced to him. Garp had told Helen that Michael Milton was a \"wimp\"; they had discussed his mustache. Michael Milton! Garp read the name so many times, he was still peering into the phone book when Duncan got home from school and assumed that his father was once more searching a directory for his make-believe people.
\"Didn't you get Walt yet?\" Duncan asked.
Garp had forgotten. And Walt has a cold, too, Garp thought. The boy shouldn't have to wait for me, with a cold.
\"Let's go get him together,\" Garp said to Duncan. To Duncan's surprise, Garp threw the phone book into the trash barrel. Then they walked to the bus stop.
Garp was still in his track clothes, and it was still raining; Duncan found this odd, too, but he didn't say anything about it. He said, \"I got two goals today.\" For some reason, all they played at Duncan's school was soccer\x{2014}fall, winter, and spring, they played only soccer. It was a small school, but there was another reason for all the soccer; Garp forgot what it was. He had never liked the reason, anyway. \"Two goals,\" Duncan repeated.
\"That's great,\" Garp said.
\"One was a header,\" Duncan said.
\"With your head?\" Garp said. \"That's wonderful.\"
\"Ralph gave me a perfect pass,\" Duncan said.
\"That's still wonderful,\" Garp said. \"And good for Ralph.\" He put his arm around Duncan, but he knew Duncan would be embarrassed if he tried to kiss him; it is Walt who lets me kiss him, Garp thought. Then he thought of kissing Helen and almost stepped in front of the bus.
\"Dad!\" Duncan said. And in the bus he asked his father, \"Are you okay?\"
\"Sure,\" Garp said.
\"I thought you'd be up at the wrestling room,\" Duncan said. \"It is raining.\"
From Walt's day care you could look across the river and Garp tried to place the exact location, there, of Michael Milton's address, which he had memorized from the phone book.
\"Where were you?\" Walt complained. He coughed; his nose dripped; he felt hot. He expected to go wrestling whenever it rained.
\"Why don't we all go to the wrestling room, as long as we're downtown?\" Duncan said. He was increasingly logical, but Garp said no, he didn't want to wrestle today. \"Why not?\" Duncan wanted to know.
\"Because he's got his running stuff on, dummy,\" Walt said.
\"Oh, shut up, Walt,\" Duncan said. They more or less fought on the bus, until Garp told them they couldn't. Walt was sick, Garp reasoned, and fighting was bad for his cold.
\"I'm not sick,\" Walt said.
\"Yes, you are,\" Garp said.
\"Yes, you are,\" Duncan teased.
\"Shut up, Duncan,\" Garp said.
\"Boy, you're in a great mood,\" Duncan said, and Garp wanted to kiss him; Garp wished to assure Duncan that he wasn't really in a bad mood, but kissing embarrassed Duncan, so Garp kissed Walt instead.
\"Dad!\" Walt complained. \"You're all wet and sweaty.\"
\"Because he's got his running stuff on, dummy,\" Duncan said.
\"He called me a dummy,\" Walt told Garp.
\"I heard him,\" Garp said.
\"I'm not a dummy,\" Walt said.
\"Yes, you are,\" Duncan said.
\"Shut up, both of you,\" Garp said.
\"Dad's in a great mood, isn't he, Walt?\" Duncan asked his brother.
\"Sure is,\" Walt said, and they decided to tease their father, instead of fight among themselves, until the bus deposited them\x{2014}a few blocks from the house in the increasing rain. They were a soggy threesome when they were still a block from home, and a car that had been going too fast slowed suddenly beside them; the window was rolled down, after a struggle, and in the steamy interior Garp saw the frazzled, glistening face of Mrs. Ralph. She grinned at them.
\"You seen Ralph?\" she asked Duncan.
\"Nope,\" Duncan said.
\"The moron doesn't know enough to come out of the rain,\" she said. \"I guess you don't, either,\" she said sweetly, to Garp; she was still grinning and Garp tried to smile back at her, but he couldn't think of anything to say. He must have had poor control of his expression, he suspected, because Mrs. Ralph wouldn't usually pass up the opportunity to go on teasing him in the rain. Yet, instead, she looked suddenly shocked by Garp's ghastly smile; she rolled her window back up.
\"See ya,\" she called, and drove off. Slowly.
\"See ya,\" Garp mumbled after her; he admired the woman but he was thinking that maybe even this horror would eventually come to pass: that he would see Mrs. Ralph.
In the house he gave Walt a hot bath, slipping into the tub with him\x{2014}an excuse, which he often took, to wrestle with that little body. Duncan was too big for Garp to fit in the tub with him anymore.
\"What's for supper?\" Duncan called upstairs.
Garp realized he had forgotten supper.
\"I forgot supper,\" Garp called.
\"You forgot?\" Walt asked him, but Garp dunked Walt in the tub, and tickled him, and Walt fought back and forgot about the issue.
\"You forgot supper?\" Duncan hollered from downstairs.
Garp decided he was not going to get out of the tub. He kept adding more hot water; the steam was good for Walt's lungs, he believed. He would try to keep the child in the tub with him as long as Walt was content to play.
They were still in the bath together when Helen got home.
\"Dad forgot supper,\" Duncan told her immediately.
\"He forgot supper?\" Helen said.
\"He forgot all about it,\" Duncan said.
\"Where is he?\" Helen asked.
\"He's taking a bath with Walt,\" Duncan said. \"They've been taking a bath for hours.\"
\"Heavens,\" said Helen. \"Maybe they've drowned.\"
\"Wouldn't you love that?\" Garp hollered from his bath, upstairs. Duncan laughed.
\"He's in a great mood,\" Duncan told his mother.
\"I can see that he is,\" Helen said. She put her hand softly on Duncan's shoulder, being careful not to let him know that she was actually leaning on him for support. She felt suddenly unsure of her balance. Poised at the bottom of the stairs, she called up to Garp, \"Had a bad day?\"
But Garp slipped underwater; it was a gesture of control, because he felt such hatred for her and he didn't want Walt to see it or hear it.
There was no answer and Helen tightened her grip on Duncan's shoulder. Please, not in front of the children, she thought. It was a new situation for her\x{2014}that she should find herself in the defensive position in a matter of some contention with Garp\x{2014}and she felt frightened.
\"Shall I come up?\" she called.
There was still no answer; Garp could hold his breath a long time.
Walt shouted back downstairs to her, \"Dad's underwater!\"
\"Dad is so weird,\" Duncan said.
Garp came up for air just as Walt yelled again, \"He's holding his breath!\"
I hope so, Helen thought. She didn't know what to do, she couldn't move.
In a minute or so, Garp whispered to Walt, \"Tell her I'm still underwater, Walt. Okay?\"
Walt appeared to think this was a fiendishly clever trick and he yelled downstairs to Helen, \"Dad's still underwater!\"
\"Wow,\" Duncan said. \"We should time him. It must be a record.\"
But now Helen felt panicked. Duncan moved out from under her hand\x{2014}he was starting up the stairs to see this breath-holding feat\x{2014}and Helen felt that her legs were lead.
\"He's still underwater!\" Walt shrieked, though Garp was drying Walt with a towel and had already started to drain the tub; they stood naked on the bathmat by the big mirror together. When Duncan came into the bathroom, Garp silenced him by putting a finger to his lips.
\"Now, say it together,\" Garp whispered. \"On the count of three, \"He's still under!\" One, two, three.\"
\"He's still under!\" Duncan and Walt howled together, and Helen felt her own lungs burst. She felt a scream escape her but no sound emerged, and she ran up the stairs thinking that only her husband could have conceived of such a plot to pay her back: drowning himself in front of their children and leaving her to explain to them why he did it.
She ran crying into the bathroom, so surprising Duncan and Walt that she had to recover almost immediately\x{2014}in order not to frighten them. Garp was naked at the mirror, slowly drying between his toes and watching her in a way she remembered that Ernie Holm had taught his wrestlers how to look for openings.
\"You're too late,\" he told her. \"I already died. But it's touching, and a little surprising, to see that you care.\"
\"We'll talk about this later?\" she asked him, hopefully\x{2014}and smiling, as if it had been a good joke.
\"We fooled you!\" Walt said, poking Helen on that sharp bone above her hip.
\"Boy, if we'd pulled that on you,\" Duncan said to his father, \"you'd have really been pissed at us.\"
\"The children haven't eaten,\" Helen said.
\"Nobody's eaten,\" Garp said. \"Unless you have.\"
\"I can wait,\" she told him.
\"So can I,\" Garp told her.
\"I'll get the kids something,\" Helen offered, pushing Walt out of the bathroom. \"There must be eggs, and cereal.\"
\"For supper?\" Duncan said. \"That sounds like a great supper,\" he said. \"I just forgot, Duncan,\" Garp said.
\"I want toast,\" Walt said.
\"You can have toast, too,\" Helen said.
\"Are you sure you can handle this?\" Garp asked Helen.
She just smiled at him.
\"God, even I can handle toast,\" Duncan said. \"I think even Walt can fix cereal.\"
\"The eggs are tricky,\" Helen said; she tried to laugh.
Garp went on drying between his toes. When the kids were out of the bathroom, Helen poked her head back in. \"I'm sorry, and I love you,\" Helen said, but he wouldn't look up from his deliberate procedure with the towel. \"I never wanted to hurt you,\" she went on. \"How did you find out? I have never once stopped thinking of you. Was it that girl?\" Helen whispered, but Garp gave all his attention to his toes.
When she had set out food for the children (as if they were pets! she would think to herself, later), she went back upstairs to him. He was still in front of the mirror, sitting naked on the edge of the tub.
\"He means nothing; he never took anything away from you,\" she told him. \"It's all over now, really it is.\"
\"Since when?\" he asked her.
\"As of now,\" she said to Garp. \"I just have to tell him.\"
\"Don't tell him,\" Garp said. \"Let him guess.\"
\"I can't do that,\" Helen said.
\"There's shell in my egg!\" Walt hollered from downstairs.
\"My toast is burnt!\" Duncan said. They were plotting together to distract their parents from each other\x{2014}whether they knew it or not. Children, Garp thought, have some instinct for separating their parents when their parents ought to be separated.
\"Just eat it!\" Helen called to them. \"It's not so bad.\"
She tried to touch Garp but he slipped past her, out of the bathroom; he started to dress.
\"Eat up and I'll take you to a movie!\" he called to the kids.
\"What are you doing that for?\" Helen asked him. \"I'm not staying here with you,\" he said. \"We're going out. You call that wimpish asshole and say good-bye.\"
\"He'll want to see me,\" Helen said, dully\x{2014}the reality of having it over, now that Garp knew about it, was working on her like Novocain. If she had been sensitive to how much she'd hurt Garp, at first, now her feelings for him were deadening slightly and she was feeling for herself again.
\"Tell him to eat his heart out,\" Garp said. \"You won't see him. No last fucks for the road, Helen. Just tell him good-bye. On the phone.\"
\"Nobody said anything about \"last fucks\",\" Helen said.
\"Use the phone,\" Garp said. \"I'll take the kids out. We'll see a movie. Please have it over with before we come back. You won't see him again.\"
\"I won't, I promise,\" Helen said. \"But I should see him, just once\x{2014}to tell him.\"
\"I suppose you feel you've handled this very decently,\" Garp said.
Helen, to a point, did feel so; she didn't say anything. She felt she had never lost sight of Garp and the children during this indulgence; she felt justified in handling it her way, now.
\"We should talk about this later,\" she said to him. \"Some perspective will be possible, later.\"
He would have struck her if the children hadn't burst into the room.
\"<<One|9k:0>>, <<two|9k:0>>, <<three|9k:0>>,\" Duncan chanted to Walt.
\"The cereal is stale!\" Duncan and Walt hollered together.
\"Please, boys,\" Helen said. \"Your father and I are having a little fight. Go downstairs.\"
They stared at her.
\"Please,\" Garp said to them. He turned away from them so they wouldn't see him crying, but Duncan probably knew, and surely Helen knew. Walt probably didn't catch it.
\"A fight?\" Walt said.
\"Come on,\" Duncan said to him; he took Walt's hand. Duncan pulled Walt out of the bedroom. \"Come on, Walt,\" Duncan said, \"or we won't get to see the movie.\"
\"Yeah, the movie!\" Walt cried.
To his horror, Garp recognized the attitude of their leaving\x{2014}Duncan leading Walt away, and down the stairs; the smaller boy turning and looking back. Walt waved, but Duncan pulled him on. Down and gone, into the bomb shelter. Garp hid his face in his clothes and cried.
When Helen touched him, he said, \"Don't touch me,\" and went on crying. Helen shut the bedroom door.
\"Oh, don't,\" she pleaded. \"He isn't worth this; he wasn't anything. I just enjoyed him,\" she tried to explain, but Garp shook his head violently and threw his pants at her. He was still only half dressed\x{2014}an attitude that was perhaps, Helen realized, the most compromising for men: when they were not one thing and also not another. A woman half dressed seemed to have some power, but a man was simply not as handsome as when he was naked, and not as secure as when he was clothed. \"Please get dressed,\" she whispered to him, and handed him back his pants. He took them, he pulled them on; and went on crying.
\"I'll do just what you want,\" she said.
\"You won't see him again?\" he said to her.
\"No, not once,\" she said. \"Not ever again.\"
\"Walt has a cold,\" Garp said. \"He shouldn't even be going out, but it's not too bad for him at a movie. And we won't be late,\" he added to her. \"Go see if he's dressed warmly enough.\" She did.
He opened her top drawer, where her lingerie was, and pulled the drawer from the dresser; he pushed his face into the wonderful silkiness and scent of her clothes\x{2014}like a bear holding a great trough of food in his forepaws, and then losing himself in it. When Helen came back into the room and caught him at this, it was almost as if she'd caught him masturbating. Embarrassed, he brought the drawer down across his knee and cracked it; her underwear flew about. He raised the cracked drawer over his head and smacked it down against the edge of the dresser, snapping what felt like the spine of an animal about the size of the drawer. Helen ran from the room and he finished dressing.
He saw Duncan's fairly well finished supper on Duncan's plate; he saw Walt's uneaten supper on Walt's plate, and on various parts of the table and floor. \"If you don't eat, Walt,\" Garp said, \"you'll grow up to be a wimp.\"
\"I'm not going to grow up,\" Walt said.
That gave Garp such a shiver that he turned on Walt and startled the child. \"Don't ever say that,\" Garp said.
\"I don't want to grow up,\" Walt said.
\"Oh, I see,\" Garp said, softening. \"You mean, you like being a kid?\"
\"Yup,\" Walt said.
\"Walt is so weird,\" Duncan said.
\"I am not!\" Walt cried.
\"You are so,\" Duncan said.
\"Go get in the car,\" Garp said. \"And stop fighting.\"
\"You were fighting,\" Duncan said, cautiously; no one reacted and Duncan tugged Walt out of the kitchen. \"Come on,\" he said.
\"Yeah, the movie!\" Walt said. They went out.
Garp said to Helen, \"He's not to come here, under any circumstances. If you let him in this house, he won't get out alive. And you're not to go out,\" he said. \"Under any circumstances. Please,\" he added, and he had to turn away from her.
\"Oh, darling,\" Helen said.
\"He's such an asshole!\" Garp moaned.
\"It could never be anyone like you, don't you see?\" Helen said. \"It could only be someone who wasn't at all like you.\"
He thought of the baby-sitters and Alice Fletcher, and his inexplicable attraction to Mrs. Ralph, and of course he knew what she meant; he walked out the kitchen door. It was raining outside, and already dark; perhaps the rain would freeze. The mud in the driveway was wet but firm. He turned the car around; then, by habit, he edged the car to the top of the driveway and cut the engine and the lights. Down the Volvo rolled, but he knew the driveway's dark curve by heart. The kids were thrilled by the sound of the gravel and the slick mud in the growing blackness, and when he popped the clutch at the bottom of the driveway, and flicked on the lights, both Walt and Duncan cheered.
\"What movie are we going to see?\" Duncan asked.
\"Anything you want,\" Garp said. They drove downtown to have a look at the posters.
It was cold and damp in the car and Walt coughed; the windshield kept fogging over, which made it hard to see what was playing at the movie houses. Walt and Duncan continued to fight about who got to stand in the gap between the bucket seats; for some reason, this had always been the prime spot in the back seat for them, and they had always fought over who got to stand or kneel there\x{2014}crowding each other and bumping Garp's elbow when he used the stick shift.
\"Get out of there, both of you,\" Garp said:
\"It's the only place you can see,\" Duncan said.
\"I'm the only one who has to see,\" Garp said. \"And this defroster is such junk,\" he added, \"that no one can see out the windshield anyway.\"
\"Why don't you write the Volvo people?\" Duncan suggested.
Garp tried to imagine a letter to Sweden about the inadequacies of the defrost system, but he couldn't sustain the idea for very long. On the floor, in back, Duncan kneeled on Walt's foot and pushed him out of the gap between the bucket seats; now Walt cried and coughed.
\"I was here first,\" Duncan said.
Garp downshifted, hard, and the uncovered tip of the stick-shift shaft bit into his hand.
\"You see this, Duncan?\" Garp asked, angrily. \"You see this gearshift? It's like a spear. You want to fall on that if I have to stop hard?\"
\"Why don't you get it fixed?\" Duncan asked.
\"Get out of the goddamn gap between the seats, Duncan!\" Garp said.
\"The stick shift has been like that for months,\" Duncan said.
\"For weeks, maybe,\" Garp said.
\"If it's dangerous, you should get it fixed,\" Duncan said.
\"That's your mother's job,\" Garp said.
\"She says it's your job, Dad,\" Walt said.
\"How's your cough, Walt?\" Garp asked.
Walt coughed. The wet rattle in his small chest seemed oversized for the child.
\"Jesus,\" Duncan said.
\"That's great, Walt,\" Garp said.
\"It's not my fault,\" Walt complained.
\"Of course it isn't,\" Garp said.
\"Yes, it is,\" Duncan said. \"Walt spends half his life in puddles.\"
\"I do not!\" Walt said.
\"Look for a movie that looks interesting, Duncan,\" Garp said.
\"I can't see unless I kneel between the seats,\" Duncan said.
They drove around. The movie houses were all on the same block but they had to drive past them a few times to decide upon which movie, and then they had to drive by them a few more times before they found a place to park.
The children chose to see the only film that had a line waiting to see it, extending out from under the cinema marquee along the sidewalk, streaked now with a freezing rain. Garp put his own jacket over Walt's head, so that very quickly Walt resembled some ill-clothed street beggar\x{2014}a damp dwarf seeking sympathy in bad weather. He promptly stepped in a puddle and soaked his feet; Garp then picked him up and listened to his chest. It was almost as if Garp thought the water in Walt's wet shoes dripped immediately into his little lungs.
\"You're so weird, Dad,\" Duncan said.
Walt saw a strange car and pointed it out. The car moved quickly down the soaked street; splashing through the garish puddles, it threw the reflected neon upon itself\x{2014}a big dark car, the color of clotted blood; it had wooden slats on its sides, and the blond wood glowed in the streetlights. The slats looked like the ribs of the long, lit skeleton of a great fish gliding through moonlight. \"Look at that car!\" Walt cried.
\"Wow, it's a hearse,\" Duncan said.
\"No, Duncan,\" Garp said. \"It's an old Buick. Before your time.\"
The Buick that Duncan mistook for a hearse was on its way to Garp's house, although Helen had done all she could to discourage Michael Milton from coming.
\"I can't see you,\" Helen told him when she called. \"It's as simple as that. It's over, just the way I said it would be if he ever found out. I won't hurt him any more than I already have.\"
\"What about me?\" Michael Milton said.
\"I'm sorry,\" Helen told him. \"But you knew. We both knew.\"
\"I want to see you,\" he said. \"Maybe tomorrow?\"
But she told him that Garp had taken the kids to a movie for the sole purpose that she finish it tonight.
\"I'm coming over,\" he told her.
\"Not here, no,\" she said.
\"We'll go for a drive,\" he told her.
\"I can't go out, either,\" she said.
\"I'm coming,\" Michael Milton said, and he hung up. Helen checked the time. It would be all right, she supposed, if she could get him to leave quickly. Movies were at least an hour and a half long. She decided she wouldn't let him in the house\x{2014}not under any circumstances. She watched for the headlights to come up the driveway, and when the Buick stopped\x{2014}just in front of the garage, like a big ship docking at a dark pier\x{2014}she ran out of the house and pushed herself against the driver's-side door before Michael Milton could open it.
The rain was turning to a semisoft slush at her feet, and the icy drops were hardening as they fell\x{2014}they had some sting as they struck her bare neck, when she bent over to speak to him through the rolled-down window.
He immediately kissed her. She tried to lightly peck his cheek but he turned her face and forced his tongue into her mouth. All over again she saw the corny bedroom of his apartment: the poster-sized print above his bed\x{2014}Paul Klee's Sinbad the Sailor. She supposed this was how he saw himself: a colorful adventurer, but sensitive to the beauty of Europe.
Helen pulled back from him and felt the cold rain soak her blouse.
\"We can't just stop,\" he said, miserably. Helen couldn't tell if it was the rain through the open window or tears that streaked his face. To her surprise, he had shaved his mustache off, and his upper lip looked slightly like the puckered, undeveloped lip of a child\x{2014}like Walt's little lip, which looked lovely on Walt, Helen thought; but it wasn't her idea of the lip for a lover.
\"What did you do to your mustache?\" she asked him.
\"I thought you didn't like it,\" he said. \"I did it for you.\"
\"But I liked it,\" she said, and shivered in the freezing rain.
\"Please, get in with me,\" he said.
She shook her head; her blouse clung to her cold skin and her long corduroy skirt felt as heavy as chain mail; her tall boots slipped in the stiffening slush.
\"I won't take you anywhere,\" he promised. \"We'll just sit here, in the car. We can't just stop,\" he repeated.
\"We knew we'd have to,\" Helen said. \"We knew it was just for a little while.\"
Michael Milton let his head sink against the glinting ring of the horn; but there was no sound, the big Buick was shut off. The rain began to stick to the windows\x{2014}the car was slowly being encased in ice.
\"Please get in,\" Michael Milton moaned. \"I'm not leaving here,\" he added, sharply. \"I'm not afraid of him. I don't have to do what he says.\"
\"It's what I say, too,\" Helen said. \"You have to go.\"
\"I'm not going,\" Michael Milton said. \"I know about your husband. I know everything about him.\"
They had never talked about Garp; Helen had forbidden it. She didn't know what Michael Milton meant.
\"He's a minor writer,\" Michael said, boldly. Helen looked surprised; to her knowledge, Michael Milton had never read Garp. He'd told her once that he never read living writers; he claimed to value the perspective he said one could gain only when a writer had been dead for a while. It is fortunate that Garp didn't know this about him\x{2014}it would certainly have added to Garp's contempt for the young man. It added somewhat to Helen's disappointment with poor Michael, now.
\"My husband is a very good writer,\" she said softly, and a shiver made her twitch so hard that her folded arms sprang open and she had to fold them closed at her breasts again.
\"He's not a major writer,\" Michael declared. \"Higgins said so. You certainly must be aware of how your husband is regarded in the department.\"
Higgins, Helen was aware, was a singularly eccentric and troublesome colleague, who managed at the same time to be dull and cloddish to the point of sleep. Helen hardly felt Higgins was representative of the department\x{2014}except that like many of her more insecure colleagues, Higgins habitually gossiped to the graduate students about his fellow department members; in this desperate way, perhaps, Higgins felt he gained the students\" trust.
\"I was not aware that Garp was regarded by the department, one way or another,\" Helen said coolly. \"Most of them don't read anything very contemporary.\"
\"Those who do say he's minor,\" Michael Milton said. This competitive and pathetic stand did not warm Helen's heart to the boy and she turned to go back inside the house.
\"I won't go!\" Michael Milton screamed. \"I'll confront him about us! Right now. He can't tell us what to do.\"
\"I'm telling you, Michael,\" Helen said.
He slumped against the horn and began to cry. She went over and touched his shoulder through the window.
\"I'll sit with you a minute,\" Helen told him. \"But you must promise me that you'll leave. I won't have him or my children see this.\"
He promised.
\"Give me the keys,\" Helen said. His look of baleful hurt\x{2014}that she didn't trust him not to drive off with her\x{2014}touched Helen all over again. She put the keys in the deep flap pocket of her long skirt and walked around to the passenger side and let herself in. He rolled up his window, and they sat, not touching, the windows fogging around them, the car creaking under a coat of ice.
Then he completely broke down and told her that she had meant more to him than all of France\x{2014}and she knew what France had meant to him, of course. She held him, then, and wildly feared how much time had passed, or was passing there in the frozen car. Even if it was not a long movie, they must still have a good half hour, or forty-five minutes; yet Michael Milton was nowhere near ready to leave. She kissed him, strongly, hoping this would help, but he only began to fondle her wet, cold breasts. She felt all over as frozen to him as she had felt outside in the hardening sleet. But she let him touch her.
\"Dear Michael,\" she said, thinking all the while.
\"How can we stop?\" was all he said.
But Helen had already stopped; she was only thinking about how to stop him. She shoved him up straight in the driver's position and stretched across the long seat, pulling her skirt back down to cover her knees, and putting her head in his lap.
\"Please remember,\" she said. \"Please try. This was the nicest part for me\x{2014}just letting you drive me in the car, when I knew where we were going. Can't you be happy\x{2014}can't you just remember that, and let it go?\"
He sat rigid behind the steering wheel, both hands struggling to stay gripped to the wheel, both thighs tensed under her head, his erection pressing against her ear.
\"Please try to just let it go at that, Michael,\" she said softly. And they stayed this way a moment, imagining that the old Buick was carrying them to Michael's apartment again. But Michael Milton could not sustain himself on imagination. He let one hand stray to the back of Helen's neck, which he gripped very tightly; his other hand opened his fly.
\"Michael!\" she said, sharply.
\"You said you always wanted to,\" he reminded her.
\"It's over, Michael.\"
\"Not yet, it isn't,\" lie said. His penis grazed her forehead, bent her eyelashes, and she recognized that this was the old Michael\x{2014}the Michael of the apartment, the Michael who occasionally liked to treat her with some force. She did not appreciate it now. But if I resist, she thought, there will be a scene. She had only to imagine Garp as part of the scene to convince herself that she should avoid any scene, at any cost.
\"Don't be a bastard, don't be a prick, Michael,\" she said. \"Don't spoil it.\"
\"You always said you wanted to,\" he said. \"But it wasn't safe, you said. Well, now it's safe. The car isn't even moving. There can't be any accidents now,\" he said.
Oddly, she realized, he had suddenly made it easier for her. She did not feel concerned anymore with letting him down gently; she felt grateful to him that he had helped her to sort her priorities so forcefully. Her priorities, she felt enormously relieved to know, were Garp and her children. Walt shouldn't be out in this weather, she thought, shivering. And Garp was more major to her, she knew, than all her minor colleagues and graduate students together.
Michael Milton had allowed her to see himself with what struck Helen as a necessary vulgarity. Suck him off, she thought bluntly, putting him into her mouth, and then he'll leave. She thought bitterly that men, once they had ejaculated, were rather quick to abandon their demands. And from her brief experience in Michael Milton's apartment, Helen knew that this would not take long.
Time was also a factor in her decision; there was at least twenty minutes remaining in even the shortest movie they could have gone to see. She set her mind to it as she might have done if it were the last task remaining to a messy business, which might have ended better but could also have turned out worse; she felt slightly proud that she had at least proved to herself that her family was her first priority. Even Garp might appreciate this, she thought; but one day, not right away.
She was so determined that she hardly noticed Michael Milton's grip loosen on her neck; he returned both hands to the steering wheel, as if he were actually piloting this experience. Let him think what he wants to think, she thought. She was thinking of her family, and she did not notice that the sleet was now nearly as hard as hail; it rattled off the big Buick like the tapping of countless hammers, driving little nails. And she did not sense the old car groaning and snapping under its thickening tomb of ice.
And she did not hear the telephone, ringing in her warm house. There was too much weather, and other interference, between her house and where she lay.",

            '[~ 02:00] The World According to Garp - John Irving.epub (OEBPS/Text/Section0014.xhtml) - about two in the morning',
            "The telephone, that old cry of alarm\x{2014}a warrior stabbed on guard duty, screaming his shock\x{2014}startled the pension where they lived and brought the trembling landlady like a ghost to their rooms.
\"Bitte, bitte,\" she came pleading. She conveyed, with little shakes of excitement, that the call was from the United States.
It was <<about two in the morning|9h>>, the heat was off, and Garp shivered after the old woman, down the corridor of the pension. \"The hall rug was thin,\" he recalled, \"the color of a shadow.\" He had written that, years ago. And he looked for the rest of his cast: the Hungarian singer, the man who could only walk on his hands, the doomed bear, and all the members of the sad circus of death he had imagined.
But they were gone; only the old woman's lean, erect body guided him\x{2014}her erectness unnaturally formal, as if she were overcorrecting a stoop. There were no photographs of speed-skating teams on the walls, there was no unicycle parked by the door to the W.C. Down a staircase and into a room with a harsh overhead light, like a hasty operating room set up in a city under siege, Garp felt he followed the Angel of Death\x{2014}midwife to the Under Toad whose swampy smell he sniffed at the mouthpiece of the phone.
\"Yes?\" he whispered.
And for a moment was relieved to hear Roberta Muldoon\x{2014}another sexual rejection; perhaps that was all. Or perhaps an update on the New Hampshire gubernatorial race. Garp looked up at the old, inquiring face of the landlady and realized that she had not taken the time to put in her teeth; her cheeks were sucked into her mouth, the loose flesh drooped below her jawline\x{2014}her whole face was as slack as a skeleton's. The room reeked of toad.
\"I didn't want you to see it on the news,\" Roberta was saying. \"If it would be on TV over there\x{2014}I couldn't know for sure. Or even the newspapers. I just didn't want you to find out that way.\"
\"Who won?\" Garp asked, lightly, though he knew that this call had little to do with the new or old governor of New Hampshire.
\"She's been shot\x{2014}your mother,\" Roberta said. \"They've killed her, Garp. A bastard shot her with a deer rifle.\"
\"Who?\" Garp whispered.
\"A man!\" Roberta wailed. It was the worst word she could use: a man. \"A man who hated women,\" Roberta said. \"He was a hunter,\" Roberta sobbed. \"It was hunting season, or it was almost hunting season, and no one thought there was anything wrong about a man with a rifle. He shot her.\"
\"Dead?\" Garp said.
\"I caught her before she fell,\" Roberta cried. \"She never struck the ground, Garp. She never said a word. She never knew what happened, Garp. I'm sure.\"
\"Did they get the man?\" Garp asked.
\"Someone shot him, or he shot himself,\" Roberta said.
\"Dead?\" Garp asked.
\"Yes, the bastard,\" Roberta said. \"He's dead, too.\"
\"Are you alone, Roberta?\" Garp asked her.
\"No,\" Roberta wept. \"There are a lot of us here. We're at your place.\" And Garp could imagine them all, the wailing women at Dog's Head Harbor\x{2014}their leader murdered.
\"She wanted her body to go to a med school,\" Garp said. \"Roberta?\"
\"I hear you,\" Roberta said. \"That's just so awful.\"
\"That's what she wanted,\" Garp said.
\"I know,\" Roberta said. \"You've got to come home.\"
\"Right away,\" Garp said.
\"We don't know what to do,\" Roberta said.
\"What is there to do?\" Garp asked. \"There's nothing to do.\"
\"There should be something,\" Roberta said, \"but she said she never wanted a funeral.\"
\"Certainly not,\" Garp said. \"She wanted her body to go to a med school. You get that accomplished, Roberta: that's what Mom would have wanted.\"
\"But there ought to be something,\" Roberta protested. \"Maybe not a religious service, but something.\"
\"Don't you get involved in anything until I get there,\" Garp told her.
\"There's a lot of talk,\" Roberta said. \"People want a rally, or something.\"
\"I'm her only family, Roberta,\" Garp said. \"You tell them that.\"
\"She meant a lot to a lot of us, you know,\" Roberta said, sharply.
Yes, and it got her killed! Garp thought, but he said nothing.
\"I tried to look after her!\" Roberta cried. \"I told her not to go in that parking lot!\"
\"Nobody's to blame, Roberta,\" Garp said, softly.
\"You think somebody's to blame, Garp,\" Roberta said. \"You always do.\"
\"Please, Roberta,\" Garp said. \"You're my best friend.\"
\"I'll tell you who's to blame,\" Roberta said. \"It's men, Garp. It's your filthy murderous sex! If you can't fuck us the way you want to, you kill us in a hundred ways!\"
\"Not me, Roberta, please,\" Garp said.
\"Yes, you too,\" Roberta whispered. \"No man is a woman's friend.\"
\"I'm your friend, Roberta,\" Garp said, and Roberta cried for a while\x{2014}a sound as acceptable to Garp as rain falling on a deep lake.
\"I'm so sorry,\" Roberta whispered. \"If I'd seen the man with the gun\x{2014}just a second sooner\x{2014}I could have blocked the shot. I would have, you know.\"
\"I know you would have, Roberta,\" Garp said; he wondered if he would have. He felt love for his mother, of course; and now an aching loss. But did he ever feel such devotion to Jenny Fields as the followers among her own sex?
He apologized to the landlady for the lateness of the phone call. When he told her that his mother was dead, the old woman crossed herself\x{2014}her sunken cheeks and her empty gums were mute but clear indications of the family deaths she had herself outlived.
Helen cried for the longest time; she would not let Jenny's namesake, little Jenny Garp, out of her arms. Duncan and Garp searched the newspapers, but the news would be a day getting to Austria\x{2014}except for the marvel of television.
Garp watched his mother's murder on his landlady's TV.
There was some election nonsense at a shopping plaza in New Hampshire. The landscape had a vaguely seacoast appearance, and Garp recognized the place as being a few miles from Dog's Head Harbor.
The incumbent governor was in favor of all the same, swinish, stupid things. The woman running against him seemed educated and idealistic and kind; she also seemed to barely restrain her anger at the same, swinish, stupid things the governor represented.
The parking lot at the shopping plaza was circled by pickup trucks. The pickups were full of men in hunting coats and caps; apparently they represented local New Hampshire interests\x{2014}as opposed to the interest in New Hampshire taken by the New York divorcees.
The nice woman running against the governor was also a kind of New York divorcee. That she had lived fifteen years in New Hampshire, and her children had gone to school there, was a fact more or less ignored by the incumbent governor, and by his supporters who circled the parking lot in their pickup trucks.
There were lots of signs; there was a steady jeering.
There was also a high school football team, in uniform\x{2014}their cleats clacking on the cement of the parking lot. One of the woman candidate's children was on the team and he had assembled the football players in the parking lot in hopes of demonstrating to New Hampshire that it was perfectly manly to vote for his mother.
The hunters in their pickup trucks were of the opinion that to vote for this woman was to vote for faggotry\x{2014}and lesbianism, and socialism, and alimony, and New York. And so forth. Garp had the feeling, watching the telecast, that those things were not tolerated in New Hampshire.
Garp and Helen and Duncan, and baby Jenny, sat in the Viennese pension about to watch the murder of Jenny Fields. Their bewildered old landlady served them coffee and little cakes; only Duncan ate anything.
Then Jenny Fields had her turn to speak to the assembled people in the parking lot. She spoke from the back of a pickup truck; Roberta Muldoon lifted her up to the tailgate and adjusted the microphone for her. Garp's mother looked very small in the pickup truck, especially beside Roberta, but Jenny's uniform was so white that she stood out, bright and clear.
\"I am Jenny Fields,\" she said\x{2014}to some cheers and some whistles and some hoots. There was a blaring of horns from the pickup trucks circling the parking lot. The police were telling the pickup trucks to move on; they moved on, and came back, and moved on again. \"Most of you know who I am,\" Jenny Fields said. There were more hoots, more cheers, more blowing of horns\x{2014}and a single sharp gunshot as conclusive as a wave breaking on the beach.
No one saw where it came from. Roberta Muldoon held Garp's mother under her arms. Jenny's white uniform seemed struck by a small dark splash. Then Roberta dropped down from the tailgate with Jenny in her arms and knifed through the breaking crowd like an old tight end carrying the ball for a hard first down. The crowd parted; Jenny's white uniform was almost concealed in Roberta's arms. There was a police car moving to intercept Roberta; when they neared each other, Roberta held out the body of Jenny Fields toward the squad car. For a moment Garp saw his mother's unmoving white uniform lifted above the crowd and into the arms of a policeman, who helped her and Roberta into the car.
The car, as they say, sped away. The camera was distracted by an apparent shoot-out taking place among the circling pickup trucks and several more police cars. Later, there was the still body of a man in a hunting coat lying in a dark puddle of what looked like oil. Later still, there was a closeup of what the newsmen would only identify as \"a deer rifle.\"
It was pointed out that the deer season had not officially opened.
Except for the fact that there had been no nudity in the telecast, the event was an X-rated soap opera from start to finish.
Garp thanked the landlady for allowing them to watch the news. Within two hours they were in Frankfurt, where they changed planes for New York. The Under Toad was not on the plane with them\x{2014}not even for Helen, who was so afraid of planes. For a while, they knew, the Under Toad was elsewhere.
All Garp could think, somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean, was that his mother had delivered some adequate \"last words.\" Jenny Fields had ended her life saying, \"Most of you know who I am.\" On the airplane, Garp tried out the line.
\"Most of you know who I am,\" he whispered. Duncan was asleep, but Helen overheard him; she reached across the aisle and held Garp's hand.
Thousands of feet above sea level, T. S. Garp cried in the airplane that was bringing him home to be famous in his violent country.",

            "EVER since Walt died,\" wrote T. S. Garp, \"my life has felt like an epilogue.\"
When Jenny Fields died, Garp must have felt his bewilderment increase\x{2014}that sense of time passing with a plan. But what was the plan?
Garp sat in John Wolf's New York office, trying to comprehend the plethora of plans surrounding his mother's death.
\"I didn't authorize a funeral,\" Garp said. \"How can there be a funeral? Where is the body, Roberta?\"
Roberta Muldoon said patiently that the body was where Jenny wanted her body to go. It was not her body that mattered, Roberta said. There was simply going to be a kind of memorial service; it was better not to think of it as a \"funeral.\"
The newspapers had said it was to be the first feminist funeral in New York.
The police had said that violence was expected.
\"The first feminist funeral?\" Garp said.
\"She meant so much to so many women,\" Roberta said. \"Don't be angry. You didn't own her, you know.\"
John Wolf rolled his eyes.
Duncan Garp looked out the window of John Wolf's office, forty floors above Manhattan. It probably felt to Duncan a little like being on the plane he had just got off.
Helen was making a phone call in another office. She was trying to reach her father in the good old town of Steering; she wanted Ernie to meet their plane out of New York when it landed in Boston.
\"All right,\" Garp said, slowly; he held the baby, little Jenny Garp, on his knee. \"All right. You know I don't approve of this, Roberta, but I'll go.\"
\"You'll go?\" John Wolf said.
\"No!\" Roberta said. \"I mean, you don't have to,\" she said.
\"I know,\" Garp said. \"But yo're right. She probably would have liked such a thing, so I'll go. What's going to happen at it?\"
\"There's going to be a lot of speeches,\" Roberta said. \"You don't want to go.\"
\"And they're going to read from her book,\" John Wolf said. \"We've donated some copies.\"
\"But you don't want to go, Garp,\" Roberta said, nervously. \"Please don't go.\"
\"I want to go,\" Garp said. \"I promise you I won't hiss or boo\x{2014}no matter what the assholes say about her. I have something of hers I might read myself, if anyone's interested,\" he said. \"Did you ever see that thing she wrote about being called a feminist?\" Roberta and John Wolf looked at each other; they looked stricken and gray. \"She said, \"I hate being called <<one|9f>>, because it's a label I didn't choose to describe my feelings about men or the way I write.\"\"
\"I don't want to argue with you, Garp,\" Roberta said. \"Not now. You know perfectly well she said other things, too. She was a feminist, whether she liked the label or not. She was simply one for pointing out all the injustices to women; she was simply for allowing women to live their own lives and make their own choices.\"
\"Oh?\" said Garp. \"And did she believe that everything that happened to women happened to them because they were women?\"
\"You have to be stupid to believe that, Garp,\" Roberta said. \"You make us all sound like Ellen Jamesians.\"
\"Please stop it, both of you,\" John Wolf said.
Jenny Garp squawked briefly and slapped Garp's knee; he looked at her, surprised\x{2014}as if he'd forgotten she was a live thing there in his lap.
\"What is it?\" he asked her. But the baby was quiet again, watching some pattern in the landscape of John Wolf's office that was invisible to the rest of them.
\"What time is this wingding?\" Garp asked Roberta.
\"<<Five o'clock in the afternoon|6>>,\" Roberta said.
\"I believe it was chosen,\" John Wolf said, \"so that half the secretaries in New York could walk off their jobs an hour early.\"
\"Not all the working women in New York are secretaries,\" Roberta said.
\"The secretaries,\" said John Wolf, \"are the only ones who'll be missed between four and five.\"
\"Oh boy,\" Garp said.
Helen came in and announced that she could not reach her father on the phone.
\"He's at wrestling practice,\" Garp said.
\"The wrestling season hasn't begun yet,\" Helen said. Garp looked at the calendar on his watch, which was several hours out of sync with the United States; he had last set it in Vienna. But Garp knew that wrestling at Steering did not officially begin until after Thanksgiving. Helen was right.
\"When I called his office at the gym, they said he was at home,\" Helen told Garp. \"And when I called home, there was no answer.\"
\"We'll rent a car at the airport,\" Garp said. \"And anyway, we can't leave until tonight. I have to go to this damn funeral.\"
\"No, you don't have to,\" Roberta insisted.
\"In fact,\" Helen said, \"you can't.\"
Roberta and John Wolf again looked stricken and gray; Garp simply looked uninformed.
\"What do you mean, I can't?\" he asked.
\"It's a feminist funeral,\" Helen said. \"Did you read the paper, or did you stop at the headlines?\"
Garp looked accusingly at Roberta Muldoon, but she looked at Duncan looking out the window. Duncan had his telescope out, spying on Manhattan.
\"You can't go, Garp,\" Roberta admitted. \"It's true. I didn't tell you because I thought it would really piss you off. I didn't think you'd want to go, anyway.\"
\"I'm not allowed?\" Garp said.
\"It's a funeral for women,\" Roberta said. \"Women loved her, women will mourn her. That's how we wanted it.\"
Garp glared at Roberta Muldoon. \"I loved her,\" he said. \"I'm her only child. Do you mean I can't go to this wingding because I'm a man?\"
\"I wish you wouldn't call it a wingding,\" Roberta said.
\"What's a wingding?\" Duncan asked.
Jenny Garp squawked again, but Garp didn't listen to her. Helen took her from him.
\"Do you mean no men are allowed at my mother's funeral?\" Garp asked Roberta.
\"It's not exactly a funeral, as I told you,\" Roberta said. \"It's more like a rally\x{2014}it's a kind of reverent demonstration.\"
\"I'm going, Roberta,\" Garp said. \"I don't care what you call it.\"
\"Oh boy,\" Helen said. She walked out of the office with baby Jenny. \"I'm going to try to get my father again,\" she said.
\"I see a man with one arm,\" Duncan said.
\"Please don't go, Garp,\" Roberta said softly.
\"She's right,\" John Wolf said. \"I wanted to go, too. I was her editor, after all. But let them have it their way, Garp. I think Jenny would have liked the idea.\"
\"I don't care what she would have liked,\" Garp said.
\"That's probably true,\" Roberta said. \"That's another reason you shouldn't be there.\"
\"You don't know, Garp, how some of the women's movement people have reacted to your book,\" John Wolf advised him.
Roberta Muldoon rolled her eyes. The accusation that Garp was cashing in on his mother's reputation, and the women's movement, had been made before. Roberta had seen the advertisement for The World According to Bensenhaver, which John Wolf had instantly authorized upon Jenny's assassination. Garp's book appeared to cash in on that tragedy, too\x{2014}the ad conveyed a sick sense of a poor author who's lost a son \"and now a mother, too.\"
It is fortunate Garp never saw that ad; even John Wolf regretted it.
The World According to Bensenhaver sold and sold and sold. For years it would be controversial; it would be taught in colleges. Fortunately, Garp's other books would be taught in colleges, sporadically, too. One course taught Jenny's autobiography together with Garp's three novels and Stewart Percy's A History of Everett Steering's Academy. The purpose of that course, apparently, was to figure out everything about Garp's life by hunting through the books for those things that appeared to be true.
It is fortunate Garp never knew anything about that course, either.
\"I see a man with one leg,\" announced Duncan Garp, searching the streets and windows of Manhattan for all the crippled and misarranged\x{2014}a task that could take years.
\"Please stop it, Duncan,\" Garp said to him.
\"If you really want to go, Garp,\" Roberta Muldoon whispered to him, \"you'll have to go in drag.\"
\"If it's all that tough for a man to get in,\" Garp snapped at Roberta, \"you better hope they don't have a chromosome check at the door.\" He felt instantly sorry he'd said that; he saw Roberta wince as if he'd slapped her and he took both her big hands in his and held them until he felt her squeeze him back. \"Sorry,\" he whispered. \"If I've got to go in drag, it's a good thing you're here to help me dress up. I mean, you're an old hand at that, right?\"
\"Right,\" Roberta said.
\"This is ridiculous,\" John Wolf said.
\"If some of those women recognize you,\" Roberta told Garp, \"they'll tear you limb from limb. At the very least, they won't let you in the door.\"
Helen came back in the office, with Jenny Garp squawking on her hip.
\"I've called Dean Bodger,\" she told Garp. \"I asked him to try to reach Daddy. It's just not like him, to be nowhere.\"
Garp shook his head.
\"We should just go to the airport now,\" Helen told him. \"Rent a car in Boston, drive to Steering. Let the children rest,\" she said. \"Then if you want to run back to New York on some crusade, you can do it.\"
\"You go,\" Garp said. \"I'll take a plane and rent my own car later.\"
\"That's silly,\" Helen said.
\"And needlessly expensive,\" Roberta said.
\"I have a lot of money now,\" Garp said; his wry smile to John Wolf was not returned.
John Wolf volunteered to take Helen and the kids to the airport.
\"One man with one arm, one man with one leg, two people who limped,\" said Duncan, \"and someone without any nose.\"
\"You should wait awhile and get a look at your father,\" Roberta Muldoon said.
Garp thought of himself: a grieving ex-wrestler, in drag for his mother's memorial service. He kissed Helen and the children, and even John Wolf. \"Don't worry about your dad,\" Garp told Helen.
\"And don't worry about Garp,\" Roberta told Helen. \"I'm going to disguise him so that everyone will leave him alone.\"
\"I wish you'd try to leave everyone alone,\" Helen told Garp.
There was suddenly another woman in John Wolf's crowded office; no one had noticed her, but she had been trying to get John Wolf's attention. When she spoke, she spoke out in a single, clear moment of silence and everyone looked at her.
\"Mr. Wolf?\" the woman said. She was old and brown-black-gray, and her feet appeared to be killing her; she wore an electrical extension cord, wrapped twice around her thick waist.
\"Yes, Jillsy?\" John Wolf said, and Garp stared at the woman. It was Jillsy Sloper, of course; John Wolf should have known that writers remember names.
\"I was wonderin',\" Jillsy said, \"if I could get off early this afternoon\x{2014}if you'd say a word for me, because I want to go to that funeral.\" She spoke with her chin down, a stiff mutter of bitten words\x{2014}as few as possible. She did not like to open her mouth around strangers; also, she recognized Garp and she didn't want to be introduced to him\x{2014}not ever.
\"Yes, of course you can,\" John Wolf said, quickly. He didn't want to introduce Jillsy Sloper to Garp any more than she wanted it.
\"Just a minute,\" Garp said. Jillsy Sloper and John Wolf froze. \"Are you Jillsy Sloper?\" Garp asked her.
\"No!\" John Wolf blurted. Garp glared at him.
\"How do you do?\" Jillsy said to Garp; she would not look at him.
\"How do you do?\" Garp said. He could see at a glance that this sorrowful woman had not, as John Wolf said, \"loved\" his book.
\"I'm sorry about your mom,\" Jillsy said.
\"Thank you very much,\" Garp said, but he could see\x{2014}they all could see\x{2014}that Jillsy Sloper was seething about something.
\"She was worth two or three of you!\" Jillsy suddenly cried to Garp. There were tears in her muddy-yellow eyes. \"She was worth four or five of your terrible books!\" she crooned. \"Lawd,\" she muttered, leaving them all in John Wolf's office. \"Lawd, Lawd!\"
Another person with a limp, thought Duncan Garp, but he could see that his father did not want to hear about his body count.",

            "HE loved epilogues, as he showed us in \"The Pension Grillparzer.\"
\"An epilogue,\" Garp wrote, \"is more than a body count. An epilogue, in the disguise of wrapping up the past, is really a way of warning us about the future.\"
That February day, Helen heard him telling jokes to Ellen James and Duncan at breakfast; he certainly sounded as if he felt good about the future. Helen gave little Jenny Garp a bath, and powdered her and oiled her scalp and clipped her tiny fingernails and zipped her into a yellow playsuit that Walt once wore. Helen could smell the coffee Garp had made, and she could hear Garp hurrying Duncan off to school.
\"Not that hat, Duncan, for Christ's sake,\" Garp said. \"That hat couldn't keep a bird warm. It's twelve below.\"
\"It's twelve above, Dad,\" Duncan said.
\"That's academic,\" Garp said. \"It's very cold, that's what it is.\" Ellen James must have come in through the garage door then, and written out a note, because Helen heard Garp say that he'd help her in a minute; obviously, Ellen couldn't start the car.
Then it was quiet in the great house for a while; as if from far away, Helen heard only the squeak of boots in the snow and the slow cranking of the car's cold engine. \"Have a good day!\" she heard Garp call to Duncan, who must have been walking down the long driveway\x{2014}off to school.
\"Yup!\" Duncan called. \"You, too!\"
The car started; Ellen James would be driving off to the university. \"Drive carefully!\" Garp called after her.
Helen had her coffee alone. Occasionally, the inarticulateness with which baby Jenny talked to herself reminded Helen of the Ellen Jamesians\x{2014}or of Ellen, when she was upset\x{2014}but not this morning. The baby was playing quietly with some plastic things. Helen could hear Garp's typewriter\x{2014}that was all.
He wrote for three hours. The typewriter would burst for three or four pages, then be silent for such a long time that Helen imagined Garp had stopped breathing; then, when she had forgotten about it and was lost in her reading, or in some task with Jenny, the typewriter would burst out again.
At <<eleven-thirty in the morning|5>> Helen heard him call Roberta Muldoon. Garp wanted a squash game before wrestling practice, if Roberta could get away from her \"girls,\" as Garp called the Fields Foundation fellows.
\"How are the girls today, Roberta?\" Garp said.
But Roberta couldn't play. Helen heard the disappointment in Garp's voice.
Later, poor Roberta would repeat and repeat how she should have played; if only she had played, she went on saying, maybe\x{2014}she would have spotted it coming\x{2014}maybe she would have been around, alert and edgy, recognizing the spoor of the real world, the paw prints Garp had always overlooked or ignored. But Roberta Muldoon could not play squash.
Garp wrote for another half hour. Helen knew he was writing a letter; somehow she could tell the difference in the sound of the typing. He wrote to John Wolf about My Father's Illusions; he was pleased with how the book was coming along. He complained that Roberta took her job too seriously and was letting herself get out of shape; no administrative job was worth as much time as Roberta gave to the Fields Foundation. Garp said that the low sales figures on The Pension Grillparzer were about what he expected; the main thing was that it was \"a lovely book\"\x{2014}he liked looking at it, and giving it to people, and its rebirth had been a rebirth for him. He said he expected a better wrestling season than last year, although he had lost his starting heavyweight to a knee operation and his one New England champion had graduated. He said that living with someone who read as much as Helen was both irritating and inspiring; he wanted to give her something to read that would make her close her other books.
At <<noon|13>> he came and kissed Helen, and fondled her breasts, and kissed baby Jenny, over and over again, while he dressed her in a snowsuit that had also been worn by Walt\x{2014}and before Walt, even Duncan had gotten some wear out of it. Garp drove Jenny to the day-care center as soon as Ellen James came back with the car. Then Garp showed up at Buster's Snack and Grill for his customwy cup of tea with honey, his one tangerine, and his one banana. That was all the lunch he ran or wrestled on; he explained why to a new teacher in the English Department\x{2014}a young man fresh out of graduate school who adored Garp's work. His name was Donald Whitcomb, and his nervous stutter reminded Garp, affectionately, of the departed Mr. Tinch and the race in his pulse he still felt for Alice Fletcher.
This particular day, Garp was eager to talk about writing to anyone, and young Whitcomb was eager to listen. Don Whitcomb would remember that Garp told him what the act of starting a novel felt like. \"It's like trying to make the dead come alive,\" he said. \"No, no, that's not right\x{2014}it's more like trying to keep everyone alive, forever. Even the ones who must die in the end. They're the most important to keep alive.\" Finally, Garp said it in a way that seemed to please him. \"A novelist is a doctor who sees only terminal cases,\" Garp said. Young Whitcomb was so awed that he wrote this down.
It would be Whitcomb's biography, years later, that the would-be biographers of Garp would all envy and despise. Whitcomb reflected that this Bloom Period in Garp's writing (as Whitcomb called it) was really due to Garp's sense of mortality. The attempt on Garp's life by the Ellen Jamesian in the dirty-white Saab, Whitcomb claimed, had given Garp the urgency necessary to make him write again. Helen would endorse that thesis.
It was not a bad idea, although Garp would surely have laughed at it. He really had forgotten the Ellen Jamesians, and he was not on the lookout for more of them. But unconsciously, perhaps, he might have been feeling that urgency young Whitcomb expressed.
In Buster's Snack and Grill, Garp held Whitcomb enthralled until it was time for wrestling practice. On his way out (leaving Whitcomb to pay, the young man later recalled, good-naturedly), Garp ran into Dean Bodger, who had just spent three days hospitalized with some heart complaint.
\"They found nothing wrong,\" Bodger complained.
\"But did they find your heart?\" Garp asked him.
The dean, young Whitcomb, and Garp all laughed. Bodger said he'd brought only The Pension Grillparzer with him to the hospital, and since it was so short a book, he'd been able to read it completely three times. It was a gloomy story to read in a hospital, Bodger said, though he was glad to report that he had not yet had the grandmother's dream; thus he knew he would live awhile longer. Bodger said he had loved the story.
Whitcomb would remember that Garp then grew embarrassed, though he was obviously pleased by Bodger's praise. Whitcomb and Bodger waved good-bye to him. Garp forgot his skier's knit hat, but Bodger told Whitcomb he would bring it to Garp\x{2014}at the gym. Dean Bodger said to Whitcomb that he liked dropping in on Garp in the wrestling room, occasionally. \"He is so in his element there,\" Bodger said.
Donald Whitcomb was no wrestling fan but he talked enthusiastically about Garp's writing. The young and the old man agreed: Garp was a man with remarkable energy.
Whitcomb recalled that he returned to his small apartment in one of the dormitories and tried to write down everything that had impressed him about Garp; he had to stop, unfinished, in time for supper. When Whitcomb went to the dining hall, he was one of the few people at the Steering School who'd heard nothing about what had happened. It was Dean Bodger\x{2014}his eyes red-rimmed, his face suddenly years older\x{2014}who stopped young Whitcomb going into the dining hall. The dean, who had left his gloves at the gym, clutched Garp's ski hat in his cold hands. When Whitcomb saw that the dean still had Garp's hat, he knew\x{2014}even before looking in Bodger's eyes\x{2014}that something was wrong.",

            "DEAN BODGER, who wept almost as much as Helen at Garp's death, remained as loyal as a pit bull, and as tenacious. Long after his retirement, he still stormed the Steering campus by night, unable to sleep, fitfully capturing lurkers and lovers who slunk along the footpaths and hugged each other to the spongy ground\x{2014}under the soft bushes, alongside the beautiful old buildings, and so forth.
Bodger remained active at Steering for as long as it took Duncan Garp to graduate. \"I saw your father through, boy,\" the dean told Duncan. \"I'll see you through, too. And if they let me, I'll stay to see your sister through.\" But they finally forced his retirement; they cited to themselves, among other problems, his habit of talking to himself during chapel, and his bizarre arrests, at <<midnight|13>>, of the boys and girls caught out after hours. They also mentioned the dean's recurring fantasy: that it had been the young Garp he caught in his arms\x{2014}one night, years ago\x{2014}and not a pigeon. Bodger refused to move from the campus, even when he was retired, and despite\x{2014}or, perhaps, because of\x{2014}his obstinacy, he became Steering's most honored emeritus. They would drag him out for all the school's ceremonies; they would totter him up to the stage, introduce him to people who didn't know who he was, and then they would lead him away. Perhaps because they could display him on these dignified occasions, they tolerated his odd behavior; long through his seventies, for example, Bodger would be convinced\x{2014}sometimes for weeks at a time\x{2014}that he was still the dean.
\"You are the dean, really,\" Helen liked to tease him.
\"Of course I am!\" Bodger roared.
They saw each other often, and as Bodger grew deafer, and deafer, he was more frequently seen on the arm of that nice Ellen James, who had her ways of talking to people who couldn't hear.
Dean Bodger remained loyal even to the Steering wrestling team, whose glory years soon faded from the memories of most. The wrestlers were never again to have a coach the equal of Ernie Holm, or even the equal of Garp. They became a losing team, yet Bodger always supported them, hollering through the last bout to the poor Steering boy flopping on his back, about to be pinned.
It was at a wrestling match that Bodger died. In the unlimited class an unusually close match\x{2014}the Steering heavyweight lay floundering with his equally exhausted and out-of-shape opponent; like beached baby whales, they groveled for the upper hand and the winning points as the clock ran down. \"Fifteen seconds!\" the announcer boomed. The big boys struggled. Bodger rose to his feet, stamping and urging. \"Gott!\" he squawked, his German emerging at the end.
When the bout ended and the stands emptied, there was the retired dean\x{2014}dead in his seat. It took much comforting from Helen for the sensitive young Whitcomb to gain control of his grief at Bodger's loss.",
