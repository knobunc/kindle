Most uranium-235 has therefore already decayed into its daughter elements, by emitting neutrons. If one of these neutrons hits a nearby uranium-235 nucleus, however, the effect is to split the nucleus into one or more additional neutrons, plus large fragments of roughly equal mass, with a liberation of energy equal to the total loss of <<3|3j>> The red colour of the continental red-beds shows that the iron was completely oxidized, as would be expected for deposits of eroded debris that had been exposed to the air for an indeterminate, but probably lengthy, period.

            "ferent species. Luckily, a few simple tricks can be applied, allowing a more robust guess to be made. Two of the most essential factors are calibration of the molecular clock using reliably dated fossils and the use of an average rate of genetic drift obtained by determining the changes in a large number of different genes in a wide variety of species. The evolutionary biologist Richard Fortey provides a nice analogy in his delightful book Trilobite! He compares molecular clocks with an old-fashioned horologist\x{2019}s shop, in which hundreds of clocks beat to their own music of time. Some have stopped completely, others tell wildly different times, but the majority indicate that the time is <<around two-thirty in the afternoon|5>>. While the onlooker may doubt the exact time, he will probably be satisfied that it is mid-afternoon. Similarly, the results of molecular clock calculations sometimes vary by hundreds of millions of years, according to the genes and species studied, but all indicate a substantial fuse of animal evolution during the Precambrian. The overall weight of evidence implies that the fuse lasted at least 100 million years, and possibly as much as 500 or 600 million. If this is true, the earliest animals must have been too small to leave visible fossils, so the search is on for tiny impressions measuring less than a millimetre [1/16 in] across.",

If the samples were recharged with fresh nutrient following the initial burst of oxygen, however, no more oxygen was released, implying that the reactions had come to an end. Although these results did not strictly rule out life, the reactions were much better explained by chemistry than by biology. But if this was the case, the chemistry of the soil must have been potent, as even the simple expedient of adding water made it fizz. After some puzzlement, the Viking team eventually concluded that the soil samples must have contained superoxides and peroxides, generated by ultraviolet rays acting on the atmosphere or on the soil itself.

            'According to Robert Blankenship of Arizona State University and Hyman Hartman, of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Biology at Berkeley, California, tiny changes in the structure of bacterial chlorophylls can lead to large shifts in their absorption properties. Two small changes to the structure of bacteriochlorophyll a (which absorbs at 870 nm) are all that it takes to generate chlorophyll d, which absorbs at <<716|3:0>> nanometres. In 1996, an article in Nature by Hideaki Miyashita and colleagues of the Marine Biotechnology Institute in Kamaishi, Japan, reported that chlorophyll d is the main photosynthetic pigment in a bacterium called Acaryochloris marina, which splits water to generate oxygen. Thus, an intermediate between bacteriochlorophyll and plant chlorophyll is not only plausible: it actually exists. From chlorophyll d another trifling change is all that is required to produce chlorophyll a, the principal pigment in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, which absorbs light at 680 nanometres.',

            "It\x{2019}s worth dwelling on this point for a moment. Consider the following. The atmospheric pressure of dry air at sea level is about 760 mm of mercury (mmHg). Of this overall pressure, 78 per cent is contributed by nitrogen and 21 per cent by oxygen. The oxygen in the air therefore exerts a barometric pressure of about 160 mmHg. Within the lungs, oxygen is taken up by haemoglobin, which is packed tightly in the red blood cells circulating through the capillaries. In these capillaries, haemoglobin is usually 95 per cent saturated with oxygen. The pressure exerted by oxygen is about 100 mmHg. As the blood is transported around the body, haemoglobin gives up its oxygen and so the oxygen pressure begins to fall. As blood leaves the heart, the oxygen pressure has already fallen to about 85 mmHg; in the arterioles it falls further to about 70 mmHg; and in the capillary networks in our organs to about 50 mmHg. Here the saturation of haemoglobin is about 60 to 70 per cent. Oxygen dissociates from haemoglobin and diffuses into the individual cells from the capillaries down a concentration gradient. This gradient is maintained by the continuous removal of oxygen by respiration. In most cells, the oxygen pressure is <<approximately 1\x{2013}10|5a:0>> mmHg. In the final stage, oxygen is sucked into the mitochondria, where active respiration lowers levels even further. The oxygen pressure inside the mitochondria is typically less than 0.5 mmHg.

Apparently the injections not only increased his physical strength and intellectual energy, but also relieved his constipation and lengthened the arc of his urine. Later, a number of surgeons tried implanting whole or sliced testicles into the scrotums of recipients. Leo L. Stanley was resident physician in San Quentin prison in California. He began transplanting testicles (removed from recently executed prisoners) into inmates in 1918. Some of the recipients reported full recovery of their sexual potency.
