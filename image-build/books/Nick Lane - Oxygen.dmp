In other words, if we add up the total amount of carbon in plants, animals, fungi and bacteria, and buried as coal, oil and gas, and present in the air as carbon dioxide, and dissolved in the oceans and swamps as carbonates, and petrified as carbonate rocks (such as limestone), then we will find that the overall ratio of stable carbon isotopes is 99.89 to <<1.11|5a:0>>.',

            "ferent species. Luckily, a few simple tricks can be applied, allowing a more robust guess to be made. Two of the most essential factors are calibration of the molecular clock using reliably dated fossils and the use of an average rate of genetic drift obtained by determining the changes in a large number of different genes in a wide variety of species. The evolutionary biologist Richard Fortey provides a nice analogy in his delightful book  Trilobite!  He compares molecular clocks with an old-fashioned horologist\x{2019}s shop, in which hundreds of clocks beat to their own music of time. Some have stopped completely, others tell wildly different times, but the majority indicate that the time is <<around two-thirty in the afternoon|5>>. While the onlooker may doubt the exact time, he will probably be satisfied that it is mid-afternoon. Similarly, the results of molecular clock calculations sometimes vary by hundreds of millions of years, according to the genes and species studied, but all indicate a substantial fuse of animal evolution during the Precambrian. The overall weight of evidence implies that the fuse lasted at least 100 million years, and possibly as much as 500 or 600 million. If this is true, the earliest animals must have been too small to leave visible fossils, so the search is on for tiny impressions measuring less than a millimetre [1/16 in] across.",

They focused on a single group, known as amphipods, which are cold-blooded, shrimp-like creatures, ranging in length from a couple of millimetres [1/25 inch] to about 9 centimetres [3\x{bd} inches].

If the samples were recharged with fresh nutrient following the initial burst of oxygen, however, no more oxygen was released, implying that the reactions had come to an end. Although these results did not strictly rule out life, the reactions were much better explained by chemistry than by biology. But if this was the case, the chemistry of the soil must have been potent, as even the simple expedient of adding water made it fizz. After some puzzlement, the Viking team eventually concluded that the soil samples must have contained superoxides and peroxides, generated by ultraviolet rays acting on the atmosphere or on the soil itself. This conjecture has been confirmed by other analyses of the chemical composition of the rocks.",

            'According to Robert Blankenship of Arizona State University and Hyman Hartman, of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Biology at Berkeley, California, tiny changes in the structure of bacterial chlorophylls can lead to large shifts in their absorption properties. Two small changes to the structure of bacteriochlorophyll  a (which absorbs at 870 nm) are all that it takes to generate chlorophyll  d, which absorbs at <<716|3:0>> nanometres. In 1996, an article in  Nature  by Hideaki Miyashita and colleagues of the Marine Biotechnology Institute in Kamaishi, Japan, reported that chlorophyll  d  is the main photosynthetic pigment in a bacterium called  Acaryochloris marina, which splits water to generate oxygen. Thus, an intermediate between bacteriochlorophyll and plant chlorophyll is not only plausible: it actually exists. From chlorophyll  d  another trifling change is all that is required to produce chlorophyll  a, the principal pigment in plants, algae and cyanobacteria, which absorbs light at 680 nanometres.',

In 1889, Charles Edouard Brown-Sequard, a prominent French physiologist, announced to the Soci\x{e9}t\x{e9} de Biologie in Paris that he had rejuvenated his mind and body by injecting himself with a liquid extracted from the testicles of dogs and guinea-pigs. Apparently the injections not only increased his physical strength and intellectual energy, but also relieved his constipation and lengthened the arc of his urine. Later, a number of surgeons tried implanting whole or sliced testicles into the scrotums of recipients. Leo L. Stanley was resident physician in San Quentin prison in California. He began transplanting testicles (removed from recently executed prisoners) into inmates in 1918. Some of the recipients reported full recovery of their sexual potency. By <<1920|9n:0>>, the scarcity of human gonads induced Stanley to substitute ram, goat, deer and boar testes, which he said worked equally well.

The concept of sin is a foundation of Christianity, yet must have been alien to the ancient Greeks \x{2014} how can Oedipus be said to have sinned, he who was condemned by an oracle before his own birth? For Christians, sin is a choice, and we are judged on the choices we make. The difference is clear in tragedy. The Greek sense of tragedy is quite unlike Shakespeare\x{2019}s. Hamlet is faced with choices throughout the play, notably the ultimate question, \x{201c}To be or not to be?\x{201d} The terrible final scene is the outcome of a series of contingencies. The tragedy of Hamlet lies in the fact that it could all have been averted. One can imagine a satirical reworking, in which a peace-broker brings the two sides together to mediate a solution. The mediator would have failed with Oedipus. Indeed, there was a mediator, Jocasta, and she did fail. What a tragic breed we are!

This question is rarely addressed in medicine, which must try to cure people who are already riddled with specific ailments, but has been answered by the evolutionary biologists. As we get older, our risk of accidental death accumulates, so there is less evolutionary pressure to maintain physiological function in an older person than in a younger person.
