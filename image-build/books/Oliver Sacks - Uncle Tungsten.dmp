Their light was feeble, and the streets were dark and dangerous, so one could hardly go out at night without a lantern or a full moon. There was a tremendous need for an efficient form of lighting that could be used safely and easily in the home and in streetlamps.',

By <<1905|9n:0>> it became possible to purify the metal enough to draw it into wires, and with tantalum filaments, incandescent bulbs could be mass-produced cheaply and compete with carbon bulbs in a way never possible with osmium bulbs. But to get the requisite resistance, one had to use a great length of spidery-thin wire, zigzagging it inside the bulb to make a complex cagelike filament. Though tantalum softened a little when heated, these filaments were nonetheless highly successful, and finally challenged the hegemony of the gas mantle. \x{2018}Suddenly,\x{2019} Uncle said, \x{2018}tantalum bulbs were all the rage.\x{2019}",
