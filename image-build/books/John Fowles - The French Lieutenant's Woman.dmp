            'The basement kitchen of Mrs.
Poulteney\'s large Regency house, which stood, an elegantly clear simile
of her social status, in a commanding position on one of the steep hills
behind Lyme Regis, would no doubt seem today almost intolerable for its
functional inadequacies. Though the occupants in 1867 would have been quite
clear as to who was the tyrant in their lives, the more real monster, to
an age like ours, would beyond doubt have been the enormous kitchen range
that occupied all the inner wall of the large and ill-lit room. It had
three fires, all of which had to be stoked twice a day, and riddled twice
a day; and since the smooth domestic running of the house depended on it,
it could never be allowed to go out. Never mind how much a summer\'s day
sweltered, never mind that every time there was a southwesterly gale the
monster blew black clouds of choking fumes--the remorseless furnaces had
to be fed. And then the color of those walls! They cried out for some light
shade, for white. Instead they were a bilious leaden green--one that was,
unknown to the occupants (and to be fair, to the tyrant upstairs), rich
in arsenic. Perhaps it was fortunate that the room was damp and that the
monster disseminated so much smoke and grease. At least the deadly dust
was laid.
The sergeant major of this
Stygian domain was a Mrs. Fairley, a thin, small person who always wore
black, but less for her widowhood than by temperament. Perhaps her sharp
melancholy had been induced by the sight of the endless torrent of lesser
mortals who cascaded through her kitchen. Butlers, footmen, gardeners,
grooms, upstairs maids, downstairs maids--they took just so much of Mrs.
Poulteney\'s standards and ways and then they fled. This was very disgraceful
and cowardly of them. But when you are expected to rise at <<six|9c:1>>, to work
from <<half past six|10>> to eleven, to work again from half past eleven to <<half
past four|10>>, and then again from <<five to ten|10a:1>>, and every day, thus a hundred-hour
week, your reserves of grace and courage may not be very large. A legendary
summation of servant feelings had been delivered to Mrs. Poulteney by the
last butler but four: "Madam, I should rather spend the rest of my life
in the poorhouse than live another week under this roof." Some gravely
doubted whether anyone could actually have dared to say these words to
the awesome lady. But the sentiment behind them was understood when the
man came down with his bags

            'The second, more expectable
item on Mrs. Poulteney\'s hypothetical list would have been: "Her voice."
If the mistress was defective in more mundane matters where her staff was
concerned, she took exceedingly good care of their spiritual welfare. There
was the mandatory double visit to church on Sundays; and there was also
a daily morning service--a hymn, a lesson, and prayers--over which the
old lady pompously presided. Now it had always vexed her that not even
her most terrible stares could reduce her servants to that state of utter
meekness and repentance which she considered their God (let alone hers)
must require. Their normal face was a mixture of fear at Mrs. Poulteney
and dumb incomprehension--like abashed sheep rather than converted sinners.
But Sarah changed all that. Hers was certainly a very beautiful voice,
controlled and clear, though always shaded with sorrow and often intense
in feeling; but above all, it was a sincere voice. For the first time in
her ungrateful little world Mrs. Poulteney saw her servants with genuinely
attentive and sometimes positively religious faces. That was good; but
there was a second bout of worship to be got through. The servants were
permitted to hold <<evening prayer|13>> in the kitchen, under Mrs. Fairley\'s indifferent
eye and briskly wooden voice. Upstairs, Mrs. Poulteney had to be read to
alone; and it was in these more intimate ceremonies that Sarah\'s voice
was heard at its best and most effective. Once or twice she had done the
incredible, by drawing from those pouched, invincible eyes a tear. Such
an effect was in no way intended, but sprang from a profound difference
between the two women. Mrs. Poulteney believed in a God that had never
existed; and Sarah knew a God that did.',

Poulteney a more than generous acknowledgment of her superior status vis-a-vis
the maids\' and only then condoned by the need to disseminate tracts; but
the vicar had advised it. All seemed well for two months. Then one morning
Miss Sarah did not appear at the Marlborough House <<matins|13>>; and when the
maid was sent to look for her, it was discovered that she had not risen.
Mrs. Poulteney went to see her. Again Sarah was in tears, but on this occasion
Mrs. Poulteney felt only irritation. However, she sent for the doctor.
He remained closeted with Sarah a long time. When he came down to the impatient
Mrs. Poulteney, he gave her a brief lecture on melancholia--he was an advanced

he was, in terms of our own time, not unlike someone who had been a Communist
in the 1930s--accepted now, but still with the devil\'s singe on him. It

agreement. He had touched exactly that same sore spot with his uncle, a
man of a very different political complexion. Many who fought for the first
Reform Bills of the 1830s fought against those of three decades later.
They felt an opportunism, a twofacedness had cancered the century, and
given birth to a menacing spirit of envy and rebellion. Perhaps the doctor,
born in 1801, was really a fragment of Augustan humanity; his sense of
progress depended too closely on an ordered society--order being whatever
allowed him to be exactly as he always had been, which made him really
much closer to the crypto-Liberal Burke than the crypto-Fascist Bentham.
But his generation were not altogether wrong in their suspicions of the
New Britain and its statesmen that rose in the long economic boom <<after
1850|18:0>>. Many younger men, obscure ones like Charles, celebrated ones like
Matthew Arnold, agreed with them. Was not the supposedly converted Disraeli
later heard, on his deathbed, to mutter the prayers for the dead in Hebrew?
And was not Gladstone, under the cloak of noble oratory, the greatest master
of the ambiguous statement, the brave declaration qualified into cowardice,
in modern political history? Where the highest are indecipherable, the
worst ... but clearly the time had come to change the subject. Charles

was the father of modern geology. Already Buffon, in the famous
Epoques

Ussher in the seventeenth century andrecorded solemnly in countless editions
of the official English Bible, that the world had been created at <<nine
o\'clock|6>> on October 26th, 4004 B.C. But even the great French naturalist
had not dared to push the origin of the world back further than some 75,000
years. Lyell\'s Principles of Geology, published between 1830 and 1833--and
so coinciding very nicely with reform elsewhere-- had burled it back millions.
His is a largely unremembered, but an essential name; he gave the age,
and countless scientists in other fields, the most meaningful space. His
discoveries blew like a great wind, freezing to the timid,but invigorating
to the bold, through the century\'s stale metaphysical corridors. But you
must remember that at the time of which I write few had even heard of Lyell\'s
masterwork, fewer believed its theories, and fewer still accepted all their
implications. Genesis is a great lie; but it is also a great poem; and
a six-thousand-year-old womb is much warmer than one that stretches for
two thousand million. Charles was therefore interested--both his future
father-in-law and his uncle had taught him to step very delicately in this
direction--to see whether Dr. Grogan would confirm or dismiss his solicitude
for the theologians. But the doctor was unforthcoming. He stared into his

<<just before ten that night|10>>. The lights were still on in Aunt Tranter\'s
house; a curtain moved as they passed. Charles performed a quick toilet
and leaving Sam to unpack, strode manfully up the hill. Mary was overjoyed
to see him; Aunt Tranter, just behind her, was pinkly wreathed in welcoming
smiles. She had had strict orders to remove herself as soon as she had
greeted the traveler: there was to be no duenna nonsense that evening.
Ernestina, with her customary estimation of her own dignity, had remained
in the back sitting room.
She did not rise when Charles
entered, but gave him a long reproachful look from under her eyelashes.',

            'They had arrived in Lyme <<just
before two|10>>. For a few minutes Charles took possession of the room he had
reserved. Again he paced up and down, but now in a nervous agony, steeling
himself for the interview ahead. The existentialist terror invaded him
again; perhaps he had known it would and so burned his boats by sending
that letter to Sarah. He rehearsed again the thousand phrases he had invented
on the journey from Exeter; but they fled through his mind like October
leaves. He took a deep breath, then his hat, and went out.
Mary, with a broad grin as
soon as she saw him, opened the door. He practiced his gravity on her.
"Good afternoon. Is Miss Ernestina at home?" But before she could answer
Ernestina herself appeared at the end of the hall. She had a little smile.',

            'In fairness to Charles it must
be said that he sent to find Sam before he left the White Lion. But the
servant was not in the taproom or the stables. Charles guessed indeed where
he was. He could not send there; and thus he left Lyme without seeing him
again. He got into his four-wheeler in the yard, and promptly drew down
the blinds. Two hearse-like miles passed before he opened them again, and
let the slanting evening sunlight, for it was now <<five o\'clock|6>>, brighten
the dingy paintwork and upholstery of the carriage.
It did not immediately brighten
Charles\'s spirits. Yet gradually, as he continued to draw away from Lyme,
he felt as if a burden had been lifted off his shoulders; a defeat suffered,
and yet he had survived it. Grogan\'s solemn warning--that the rest of his
life must be lived in proof of the justice of what he had done--he accepted.
But among the rich green fields and May hedgerows of the Devon countryside
it was difficult not to see the future as fertile--a new life lay ahead
of him, great challenges, but he would rise to them. His guilt seemed almost
beneficial: its expiation gave his life its hitherto lacking purpose. An
image from ancient Egypt entered his mind--a sculpture in the British Museum,
showing a pharaoh standing beside his wife, who had her arm round his waist,
with her other hand on his forearm. It had always seemed to Charles a perfect
emblem of conjugal harmony, not least since the figures were carved from
the same block of stone. He and Sarah were not yet carved into that harmony;
but they were of the same stone.',
