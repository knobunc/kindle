            'Looking down into the valley, the boy could see the silver-gray terraces of olive trees splashed with burgeoning thickets of oleander. He remembered that in the brown, mud-roofed town every clump of earth, every cranny in a stone wall, would have burst into springtime flower. Remembering, he scowled up against the hot <<noonday|13>> sun.',

            'UNDER THE <<MIDDAY|13>> SUN the rock would blister one\'s fingers. The air over the smelting oven quivered. When Daniel bent over it to poke at the doughy mass of red-hot ore, the fumes scorched his nostrils. He glanced at Samson, who for a full half-day had been kneading the bellows without ceasing. Perhaps Samson, wherever he had lived, had learned early to endure the heat of the sun. Daniel had had enough for this day. The small lump of iron could be left now till it had cooled enough to be broken into pieces.',

He walked swiftly, his feet sure on the rocky trail. <<Toward midnight|13>> he came to the foot of the steep ascent that led to the cave. His heart began to beat strongly and joyfully. As he started up the last climb a dark shape moved out from the boulders above, loomed for an instant against the sky, and then came soundlessly down toward him. In the dim light he could see the white gleaming arc that split the shadowy face.',

He had an idea that to the Romans every Jew would look alike too. He was sure they seldom bent their stiff necks to take a good look at <<one|9c:0>>. There was little likelihood that the soldier on horseback would remember the boy at the well. At any rate, it was worth the chance. He got to his feet and set out for Capernaum.',

With every bite Daniel remembered the fine white cloth, the damask couches, the wine in alabaster cups. But Thacia seemed to have forgotten. What was there about her? he wondered. A sort of naturalness that made her seem without the slightest effort to belong, no matter where she happened to be\x{2014}on the mountain, in the luxury of her own home, among the fishing boats? Her gaiety touched with a special grace everything around her.",

This waiting was not the same as the times he had crouched behind a rock eager for Rosh\'s signal. It was no flimsily-guarded caravan they awaited. And behind him was no tight-knit band that would move with precision and cunning, only a cluster of untried boys. Even now, as he glanced up, the flutter of a coatsleeve betrayed one of them. Still, he could count on them. He knew that every boy in the band was prepared to give his life. It was up to him, the one they had chosen leader, to see that none of them had to.',
