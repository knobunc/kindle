She said it was the same with dogs. When they became very fat and overfed, you had to see that they didn\'t hurry upstairs, as it made them puff and pant, and that was bad for their hearts. She asked your aunt if she remembered the late spaniel, Ambrose; and your aunt said, \'Poor old Ambrose, you couldn\'t keep him away from the garbage pail\'; and Angela said, \'Exactly, so do please be careful, Mr. Glossop.\' And you tell me she loves me still!"',

Not that he\'ll have any hair in a year or two, because he\'s pretty thin on the top already, and before he knows where he is he\'ll be as bald as an egg, and he\'s the last man who can afford to go bald. And I think it\'s simply disgusting, the way he gorges all the time. Do you know, I found him in the larder at <<one o\'clock this morning|6>>, absolutely wallowing in a steak-and-kidney pie? There was hardly any of it left. And you remember what an enormous dinner he had. Quite disgusting, I call it.
