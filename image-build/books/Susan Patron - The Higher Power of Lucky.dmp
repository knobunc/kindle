Since there was no market or restaurant or even a gas station in Hard Pan, people liked to stand around getting the latest news in town while they waited for the Captain to distribute the mail into each P.O. box. So Brigitte would be gone for at least half an hour, enough time for Lucky to get a good start on her display.",

Ms. Baum-Izzart smiled at Ms. McBeam and at the fifth graders. She put her two hands on her shirt, holding the sides of her stomach. Lucky noticed that there were slightly darker marks where Ms. Baum-Izzart put her hands, like the dark stains on the sides of Miles\x{2019}s pants where he wiped his hands. She figured Ms. Baum-Izzart spent a lot of time feeling the interesting huge round ball of her stomach.",
