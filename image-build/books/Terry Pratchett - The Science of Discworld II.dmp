Scientifically, this is a very bizarre form of causality: the future is affecting the past. That doesn\x{2019}t normally occur in physics (except in very esoteric Quantum things, but let\x{2019}s not get distracted). In this case, science has an explanation. What causes you to get up at <<7.15|3:1>> is not actually your future arrival at work. If in fact you fall under a bus and never make it to work, you still got up at <<7.15|9c:1>>. Instead of backwards causality, you have a mental model, in your brain, which is your best attempt to predict the day ahead. In that model, realised as buzzing electrons, you think that you ought to be at work by nine. That model, and its expectation of the future, exists now, or more accurately, a short time in the past. It is that expectation that causes you to get up instead of lying in and having a well-deserved snooze. And the causality is entirely normal: from past to future by way of actions taking place in the present.",

It is unreasonable to suppose that each individual inherited different versions of each variable gene from their parents: some will have carried only one version, the same from both parents, and no one can have carried more than two. The humans that came out of Africa have <<about 500|18:0>> immune variants, at least, in common with, chimpanzees, out of about 750 possibilities. The humans who stayed in Africa have more: they weren\x{2019}t subject to the bottleneck. There are many other genes where several ancient versions (ancient because they\x{2019}re common to us, chimpanzees, perhaps gorillas, maybe other species) have come through; 100,000 people is a reasonable minimum to carry all those. If you want to be critical and get that number down a bit, you could argue that a.few variants from African populations may have been mixed in later, for example via slavery to the US, or to Mediterranean peoples and then via Phoenician sailors to the rest of us. Still, the evidence does not point to an Adam and an Eve, unless they came with a lot of servants, slaves or concubines.",
