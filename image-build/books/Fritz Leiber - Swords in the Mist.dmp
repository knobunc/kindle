            'He remembered now that the last person he had been drinking with was the Mouser. By the same token -- in this matter Fafhrd\'s maggoty mind worked very fast indeed -- the Mouser must be the person who had made away with his quart or more of <<midnight|13>> medicine. A great righteous anger flamed in him and he took a very deep breath.',

            'But when it became known (due to some incautious babblings of Bwadres) that Pulg was not only conducting under the guise of extortion a holy war on all other gods in Lankhmar, with the ultimate aim of driving them from the city and if possible from the world, but that he even entertained murky designs of overthrowing the gods _of_ Lankhmar or at least forcing them to recognize Issek\'s overlordship ... when all this became apparent, the doom of Issekianity was sealed. On the third anniversary of Issek\'s Second Coming, the night descended ominous and thickly foggy, the sort of night when all wise Lankhmarians hug their indoor fires. <<About midnight|13>> awful screams and piteous howlings were heard throughout the city, along with the rending of thick doors and the breaking of heavy masonry -- preceded and followed, some tremulously maintained, by the clicking tread of bones on the march. One youth who peered out through an attic window lived long enough before he expired in gibbering madness to report that he had seen striding through the streets a multitude of black-togaed figures, sooty of hand, foot and feature and skeletally lean.',

At last they admitted to each other that they couldn\'t fetch Ool Hrusp on this reach, and they contented themselves with sailing to intercept the Claws -- the narrow but mountainously rocky end of the Eastern Continent\'s great western-thrusting northern peninsula, comprised of the Land of the Eight Cities, the Cold Waste, and numerous grim and great mountain ranges.

            'After Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser escaped from the sea-king\'s wrath, they set a course for chilly No-Ombrulsk, but by <<midnight|13>> the favoring west wind had shifted around into a blustering northeaster. It was Fafhrd\'s judgment, at which the Mouser sneered, that this thwarting was the beginning of the sea-king\'s revenge on them. They perforce turned tail (or stern, as finicky sailormen would have us say) and ran south under jib alone, always keeping the grim mountainous coast in view to larboard, so they would not be driven into the trackless Outer Sea, which they had crossed only once in their lives before, and then in dire circumstance, much farther south.',

            '"Aphrodite!") and the sow\'s uncorsetable bulk had split the tight Cretan waist. The stars of <<midnight|13>> were peeping through the skylight above the tank, and the wine cups had been many times refilled, before her anger was dissipated. Then, just as Fafhrd was impressing a reintroductory kiss upon her melting lips, he felt them once again become slobbering and tusky. This time she picked herself up from between two wine casks and, ignoring the shrieks, excited comments, and befuddled stares as merely part of a rude mystification that had been carried much too far, she walked with Amazonian dignity from the room. She paused only once, on the dark and deep-worn threshold, and then but to hurl at Fafhrd a small dagger, which he absentmindedly deflected upward with his copper goblet, so that it struck full in the mouth a wooden satyr on the wall, giving that deity the appearance of introspectively picking his teeth.',
