At that time, Lord Chikitada was married and had already sired a son. It was a pity that he had to die. Obata Hiro was his friend as well as vassal, seventeen then, but someone had poisoned young Obata\x{2019}s mind, saying that Chikitada had planned to kill his father treacherously. Of course it was all lies but that didn\x{2019}t bring Chikitada back to lead us. Young Obata knelt in front of the body and bowed three times. He said that he had done the deed out of filial respect for his father and now wished to atone for his insult to us and our clan by committing seppuku. He was given permission. First he washed Chikitada\x{2019}s head with his own hands and set it in a place of reverence. Then he cut himself open and died manfully, with great ceremony, one of our men acting as his second and removing his head with a single stroke. Later his father came to collect his son\x{2019}s head and the Murasama sword. Things became bad for us. Lord Chikitada\x{2019}s only son was taken hostage somewhere and our part of the clan fell on evil times. That was\x{2014}\x{201d}",

We are still running before the wind along a course of 270 degrees, veering to North North West, making way briskly, <<about two|9:1>> leagues, each of three miles this hour.
