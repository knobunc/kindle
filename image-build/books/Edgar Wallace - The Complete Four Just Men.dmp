Usually there are two girls on duty, one a senior; but Miss Leah went home early. We call ourselves an all-night agency, but really we close down <<about one o\x{2019}clock|6>>. Most of our work is theatrical. Often, after a first-night performance, certain changes have to be made in a script \x{2013} and sometimes new contracts are arranged over supper, and we prepare the rough drafts. At other times it is just letter-work. I know all the big managers, and I\x{2019}ve often gone to their offices quite late to do work for them. We never, of course, go to strange people and at the offices we have a porter who is also a messenger, to see that we are not annoyed. At <<twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>> I had a phone message from Mr Grasleigh, of the Orpheum, asking me if I would do two letters for him. He sent his car for me, and I went to his flat in Curzon Street. We\x{2019}re not allowed to go to the private houses of our clients, but I knew Mr Grasleigh was a client, though I had never met him before.\x{2019}",

There is the risk of losing large sums of money invested for the purpose of securing even larger sums. The criminal who puts money in his business runs the least risk of detection.
