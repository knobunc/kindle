There should be twenty-four of these star-spangled meridians, or one for each hour of the day.

The sailor could observe the row of stars above his head at local <<midnight|13>>. If it were the fourth, for argument\x{2019}s sake, and his tables told him the first row should be over the Canaries just then, assuming he had some knowledge of the time, he could figure his longitude as three hours\x{2014}or forty-five degrees\x{2014}west of those islands.
