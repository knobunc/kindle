As he started to eat, Lyssel entered the room, wearing a fetching white skirt and a dark blue pullover.

            "The local time was <<about noon|13>>, to judge by the altitude of Yellow Rose. It shone without dazzle, producing a serene light which played odd tricks with perspective. The streets were quiet. The townsfolk moved sedately about their affairs, slippers gliding silently across the pavement. Some walked with heads bent, arms clasped behind their backs, as if engrossed in abstract calculation; others paused to rest on benches where they contemplated their plans for the day. They showed themselves as neither gregarious nor voluble. Persons passing on the street gave each other suspicious side-glances under hooded eyelids. When friends or business associates met and communication was necessary, they first looked right and left over their shoulders, then spoke in guarded undertones, as if imparting matters of secret import. On this basis, Loorie seemed a veritable hive of intrigue. A flight of three long-billed birds, pink with black crests rising along their necks, glided overhead. Their wings, narrow and of remarkable span from tip to tip, flapped almost negligently. As they flew, they issued a succession of discordant calls\x{2014}the loudest sounds to be heard across Loorie.",

            '<<Shortly after noon|13>> the train approached a tall dark forest, which Bariano identified as the Blandy Deep, marking the limits of the Tangtsang Steppe. An hour later the train halted beside the Skein River, near a dock at which a massive barge lay at moorings. The barge was constructed of a dense glossy black wood, to standards of craftsmanship Maihac thought remarkably rich and exact. From a bluff bow the hull swelled to an almost voluptuous mid-section, then faired with the grace of a resolving chord to the hill transom, which was broken by six mullioned windows. The forepeak, deckhouse and sterncastle, in the same manner, were conceived and crafted to standards of baroque elegance; at bow and stern, stanchions supported heavy lanterns formed of black iron and colored glass.',
