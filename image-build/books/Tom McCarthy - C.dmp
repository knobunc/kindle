The bedside maid holds Mrs. Carrefax\'s shoulders, Mrs. Carrefax grips the bearing-down sheet and the baby\'s head appears between her legs--or rather, half-appears behind a glistening film of plasma, a skin-membrane. Learmont has heard of this phenomenon but never witnessed it before: the baby has a caul. The amniotic bag envelops the entire head, a silky hood. As soon as the baby\'s fully out, Learmont pinches this away from its skin and peels it upwards from the neck, removing it. He washes off the green-and-red mess covering the rest of the body, ties and cuts the cord, wraps the baby in a sheet and hands it to the mother.',

On rainy days they go to play the estate-wide version of The Realtor\'s Game at its window, shunting their imaginary doubles from park to garden, avenue to path to lawn. While doing this, they fiddle with their father\'s archive. He has stacks of old recordings: lamp-blackened glass phonautograph plates and rolls of paper bearing scratch marks laid down by voices moaning from deaf bodies before either of them was born; zinc master discs that, cut in the final years of the last century and the first few of this, appear to Serge like coins of some exotic currency gone out of circulation--miniature, round islands of arrested time. The surfaces of the zinc discs give off a faint smell of beeswax--beeswax overlaid with some sharp chemical. ("Chromic acid," Sophie tells him when she sees him wrinkling his nose at <<one|9c:1>>. "I\'ve got a whole phial of it in my lab.") The cylinders they find beside these are formed entirely of wax: solid brown columns of the stuff whose smooth, moulded surfaces have been defaced by networks of engravings--strange, meshed graffiti. Sophie and Serge can play these back, thanks to an old Edison phonograph they find gathering dust among them. Selecting recordings at random (some are in labeled cardboard tubes, others are loose and unmarked), they slide the cylinder onto its mandrel and wait for the sound to trickle out. Most of the cylinders contain sequences of letters, spoken out aloud, repeatedly:',

Further out, the lightship Tongue\'s reporting a derelict\'s position: the coordinates click their way in to the Seaforth station, then flash out again, to be acknowledged by Marconi operators of commercial liners, one after the other. The ships\' names reel off in litany: Falaba, British Sun, Scania, Morea, Carmania, each name appendaged by its church: Cunard Line, Allen, Aberdeen Direct, Canadian Pacific Railway, Holland-America. The clicks peter out, and Serge glances at the clock: it\'s half <<a minute before one|10>>. A few seconds later, Paris\'s call-sign comes on: FL for Eiffel. Serge taps his finger on the desktop to the rhythm of the huge tower\'s stand-by clicks, then holds it still and erect for the silent lull that always comes just before the time-code.

            'One night, at <<about half past two|10>>, Serge looks out of his bedroom window and sees a white figure gliding over the Mulberry Lawn, skirting the Orchard\'s border as it heads towards the Crypt Park\'s gates. It looks like Sophie; he leans out further but the figure disappears from view before he can identify it. The experience startles him--not least because it plays out in the real and close-up space around the house an aspect of some scenes that he occasionally intuits but never quite pins down when riding the dial\'s highest reaches: vague impressions of bodies hovering just beyond the threshold of the visible, and corresponding signals not quite separable from the noise around them--important ones, their recalcitrance all the more frustrating for that reason. He sees these things, and hears, or half-hears, them as well, quite frequently--usually as he\'s straddling the wavelength-border between consciousness and sleep. This white figure tonight\'s no somnolent vision, though: it\'s a real person, of the size and shape of Sophie, and dressed the way she dresses when she goes to bed each night, to boot. The next day, he visits her in her lab and asks if she was wandering about in night-skirts last night.',

It\'s empty, and now smells of stale sandwiches, old lemonade and flower- and insect-secretions overlaid with the odour of the chemicals stored on the shelves\' jars. Serge half-recognises this last odour from the days when he and Sophie would mix compounds in this very room--but only half: these chemicals are more sophisticated, real ones, loaned from cupboards at Imperial, cases guarded by white-coated men who commune with Sophie in a language too complex for him to follow. They\'d understand her chart, Serge thinks, looking at the wall whose web of lines and vectors has grown still larger and more complex since this afternoon: they\'d look at it and know immediately what the letters meant, the links, all the associations ...',

On its front page is a grainy image showing some kind of spectacle taking place, with girls on a stage holding up cut-out suns. That\'s what Serge assumes the objects are: they\'re sun-shaped but, due to the saturation in the printed photograph, much darker than the girls who hold them. Is that what the Dutch woman was talking about? Do they do Pageants here, just like at Versoie? There\'s a text beneath the image, but Serge doesn\'t understand it. He looks up from the paper.

Free and easily liberated, the brochure said; too many all at once will kill you, Dr. Filip warned. Behind him the generating station\'s turbines clank and moan. Beyond it, just before the path gives over to fields, there\'s a small substation: an urn-like building from which wires emerge and lead to poles, then wind round rubber spindles fixed to horizontal arms on these and split out into smaller wires, like organzine combining, only backwards, each separated strand then disappearing inside a metal casket that\'s half-buried in the ground. Between the substation and the main one, vines emerge from the same ground--three rows of them, attached by strings to nursery posts that they\'ve outgrown. Serge walks up to the knitted fence around the substation and, resting his fingers in its weave, looks at the vines more closely. They have fruit on them: dark-red grapes bursting with ripeness.
