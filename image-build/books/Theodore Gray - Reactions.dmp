This product, on the other hand, is the collected distillate straight from the condensing coil, as pure and colorless as a properly run distillation operation can make it. (Truly straight from the still it would be about 95 percent ethyl alcohol, but that\x{2019}s not legal to sell for human consumption, so this is diluted with water down to the legal limit.)",

It shows the water deluge system on launch pad 39A dumping, at its peak, about 7,000 pounds of water per second onto the launch pad to protect it from the heat of the roughly 10,000 pounds per second of fuel being burned by the five F-1 rocket engines, all of which are pointing straight at the pad. Most of this water is almost instantly boiling into steam, which you can\x{2019}t see because steam is an invisible gas. It\x{2019}s only after the rocket leaves that you can see how much water really is entering the area.",
