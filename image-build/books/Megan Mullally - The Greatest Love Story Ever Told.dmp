And once it became clear that I had been born in a top hat and tap shoes, she was extremely supportive of me as well. I started ballet at <<six|9c:0>>, and anything creative I wanted to pursue, she would encourage. I think she had a slight touch of the stage mother, but not nearly as bad as some mothers have it. I was in a ballet company from eighth through twelfth grades, so I saw a lot of stage mothers. I would say she was in the thirtieth percentile.',
