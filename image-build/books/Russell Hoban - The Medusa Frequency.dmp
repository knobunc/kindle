The goneness is what we\x{2019}re left with, maybe some of us more than others. It\x{2019}s very hard to have anything, isn\x{2019}t it? Like our blue-black shining rainy night, when I call it to mind it\x{2019}s the going-awayness of it, the goneness of it that I taste. I\x{2019}ve always been a sort of phoney percy, you see - Persephone more than Eurydice, with my own little dark realm. Or I\x{2019}m like Rilke\x{2019}s Eurydike, so full of my large death that I understand nothing. I suppose that\x{2019}s why I need, how shall I put it, more of a red-pyjama type than you are. I lied to you about General Sphincter\x{2019}s mistress, I was with Sol that weekend and I was with him the other night when you rang up at <<three o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> to tell him you wouldn\x{2019}t do the Orpheus thing for Classique. So at least you don\x{2019}t have to feel guilty about me, I did it to you before you did it to me. Goodbye, Herman. We\x{2019}ll undoubtedly see each other here and there in the normal course of things and I don\x{2019}t expect it\x{2019}ll be awkward.
