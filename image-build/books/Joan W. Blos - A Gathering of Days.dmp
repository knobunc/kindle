It was nearly mid-night when the coach reached the bridge where, her arrival being expected, Mr. Shipman met her and fetched her belongings home.

He remembers well it had snowed nine inches just the night before my birth, and ten the day preceding. Most of the previous snow had melted and they\x{2019}d had flooding on River Street down in Holderness. The sun\x{2019}s first rays came in to the room as I came in to the world. They\x{2019}d wrapped me well and there, with my mother, I lay in the room which they\x{2019}d planned for the purpose and called the borning room.",

            "Wagons and chaises surrounded the green whereon at <<9 o\x{2019}clock|6>> promptly the militia paraded. Presently all the marchers stopped, and stood most steadily in their places, while fife and fiddle & drummers performed, the last of their tunes being Yankee Doodle, which was the most applauded. Next was read, in ringing tones, the Declaration of Independence; this being followed by a prayer given by the militia captain. A soldier\x{2019}s prayer is even more forceful than one by a minister. (Perhaps \x{2019}tis the unexpectedness of some-time strength so sweetly gentled? I am reminded of that day when Father insisted that he alone would attend the cooking.)",

The scene before us was constantly changing and, at <<11 o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>, the oration was given. A Judge J Wax came down from Plymouth especially for the event. At the end he espied two fellows with thin white hair & pipe stem legs, wearing what seemed the well-worn remains of that well-loved uniform\x{2014}the buff coloured trousers & deep blue coats of General Washington\x{2019}s soldiers. The speaker\x{2019}s eager imagination placed them both at Valley Forge, and lauded them as patriots by whose example we might be inspired, and called on them to reply.",
