In 1844, it charged twenty-five cents to carry a letter four hundred miles, and if the letter had two sheets, the postage doubled (envelopes counted as another sheet).

Woolf was a core member of the Bloomsbury Group, a collection of London artists and intellectuals that included E. M. Forster, the economist John Maynard Keynes, and the painter and art critic Roger Fry, whose infamous 1910 Post-Impressionist exhibition gave the group sudden prominence. Woolf\x{2019}s Bloomsbury affiliation was, at the time, more influential than her fiction, which was just beginning to appear, but she had been writing reviews for the Times Literary Supplement for over a decade, and by <<1918|9:0>> her bold pronouncements on novelists old and new were appearing nearly every week.

Lydia Douce (with her bronze hair) and Mina Kennedy (with her golden hair) are barmaids at the Ormond Hotel, and Joyce imagined them as Sirens singing out to Ulysses as his ship passes their island. The chapter itself was a song: it was modeled after the eight-part structure of a fugue, and in those first pages Joyce adds an overture, an introduction to the musical sounds and phrases that would be repeated, contextualized and vested with meaning over the course of the chapter. In the opening of \x{201c}Sirens,\x{201d} the pure sound of the words is what matters. As the episode unfolds, those sounds find their locations in a narrative: the ringing steel of the horse\x{2019}s hoofs carrying the viceroy past the hotel, the \x{201c}long in dying\x{201d} resonance of the blind man\x{2019}s tuning fork, the jingle of coins in Blazes Boylan\x{2019}s pocket as he leaves to see Molly Bloom in her bedroom at <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>\x{2014}a meeting Bloom knows about.

He didn\x{2019}t speak French, though his new wife, Hadley, gave him lessons on the steamship across the Atlantic, and he kept a rabbit\x{2019}s foot in his right pocket. He told everyone in Chicago that he was going to be a writer, and Paris was the best place to do it. Hemingway churned out articles for the Toronto Star and saved his best material for his fiction. He added up the prices in Paris. Their hotel room cost about a dollar a day (their rent would cost half that much). He knew a restaurant that served a steak and potatoes meal for <<2.40|5a:0>> francs (about 20 cents), and he could find a bottle of wine for 60 centimes\x{2014}a nickel. He calculated that one thousand dollars could sustain a person in Paris for a full year. For Hemingway, though, the bargain hunts were more of a sport than a necessity. The newspaper paid him decently, and Hadley had a trust fund of about three thousand dollars a year. The maid who cooked them dinner and their ski vacations in the Swiss Alps were not exactly bohemian, but Hemingway believed that hardship made him a better artist. He thought he understood C\x{e9}zanne on an empty stomach and that abstaining from sex improved his writing.",

But it wasn\x{2019}t just the number of college students. It was the way they read. When Cerf was at Columbia, the Great Books movement was incubating in the university\x{2019}s English department. Professors like John Erskine envisioned a two-year survey of the Western canon that, when it was instituted in 1920, the university described as a \x{201c}Reading of Masterpieces of literature in poetry, history, philosophy and science.\x{201d} The reading list included works from Homer, Plato, Dante and Shakespeare.

The fight against charges of obscenity (which is still a crime) was about more than the right to publish sexually explicit material. It was a dimension of the larger struggle between state power and individual freedom that intensified in the early twentieth century, when more people began to challenge governmental control over whatever speech the state considered harmful. State control and moral control reinforced each other. Comstock\x{2019}s era of moral surveillance contributed to the rise of the federal government (the Post Office was its cornerstone), and the government\x{2019}s crackdown on subversive speech during and after World War I in turn helped the NYSSV expand its campaign against obscenity in the 1920s. Joyce, whether he liked it or not, was affiliated with anarchists, highbrows and the Irish\x{2014}all suspect populations <<after 1917|18:0>>.",

On January 1, 1801, the aristocrats and power brokers departed, followed by the professionals and the shops and the masquerades. Dublin\x{2019}s Georgian grandeur evaporated from all but a few streets lining the squares, and even there the remaining wealthy families seemed more like stubborn survivors with roots too deep to be removed. The larger properties became hotels, offices and almshouses, and the rest were divided up into tenements that were left to molder and decay.

Then the famine struck, and the refugees who escaped mass starvation in the countryside found themselves crammed in a squalid city and still hungry. Slaughterhouses were scattered among tenements sheltering dozens of people in airless rooms that bred dysentery, typhoid and cholera. The sewers, where they existed, emptied directly into the River Liffey, and the tides washed the waste back through the city so that the stench blended with the rich smells from brewery chimneys, streetside manure and waste heaped in tiny backyards. In some neighborhoods, children were more likely to die than see their fifth birthday, and still-rotting bodies were dug up from graveyards to make more room for the dead. Ireland\x{2019}s industries\x{2014}shipbuilding, ironworks and textiles\x{2014}were channeled northward to Anglo-Irish Belfast while Catholic Dublin remained stagnant longer than anyone could remember.

After knocking on the door, members and their friends lowered themselves through an opening resembling a manhole and descended a flight of wooden stairs into a large cellar with exposed beams latticing the ceiling. The walls were covered with goblinesque figures in orange and purple performing grotesque gymnastic feats. Golden Calf patrons watched Spanish gypsy dances, shadow plays and poetry readings. Cabaret singers and ragtime bands took their turns on the small stage, and half-drunk couples danced the Turkey Trot and the Bunny Hug, their chests pressed together until dawn.

Marsden pressed him on his philosophy before she would work with him, and Pound\x{2019}s response was uncharacteristically tentative. \x{201c}I suppose I\x{2019}m individualist,\x{201d} he wrote to Marsden. \x{201c}I suppose I believe in the arts as the most effective propaganda for a sort of individual liberty.\x{201d} Marsden\x{2019}s sharp questions stayed with him, and a couple of months later he wrote a defense of poetry that followed Marsden\x{2019}s lead. In \x{201c}The Serious Artist,\x{201d} Pound claimed that the artist \x{201c}presents the image of his desire, of his hate, of his indifference as precisely that,\x{201d} and only a report on individual desires could illuminate human nature.
