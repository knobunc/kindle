He was taking more care with his grooming, now, at least, and as far as McBryde could tell, he was actually getting more sleep. But the bouts of depression were still there. They seemed to be less frequent, yet, according to his therapist they were even deeper and darker than they had been, and McBryde himself had noticed over the last several weeks that Simoes\' occasional bursts of furious temper - which had never been a part of his amiable, easy-going personality before his daughter\'s death - had grown increasingly violent.',

When the time came, though, all hell was going to be out for <<noon|13>> as the carefully sequenced messages - and computer-controlled acts of sabotage - raced outward. They\'d start right here in the Center, invading computer memories, reducing critical molecular circuitry to slag, and then moving on to invade the Long-Range Planning Board\'s systems. He doubted they\'d get very deep, but he could be wrong. He and Simoes had combined the hyper-physicist\'s expertise and McBryde\'s knowledge of the security systems when they\'d set up the attacks, so there was at least a significant chance they\'d manage to do some real damage before their electronic minions were defeated. In the meantime, the master execution programs would be bootstrapping themselves about from one high security system to another and generally wreaking all the havoc they could. Coming from so deep inside, they were almost certain to cause far more chaos and confusion - not to mention damage - than any of the cyber-security types\' worst nightmares had ever envisioned.And while all that was going on, his own frantic messages would be being dumped to the system, feverishly seeking to alert his superiors to Simoes\' berserk efforts to punish the Alignment for everything it had done to his daughter and to him. They\'d been very carefully crafted to create the impression that McBryde was in personal pursuit of Simoes... and that the two of them were headed directly for Mendel, where Simoes intended a suicide run on the capital itself.',

It was late evening, by shipboard time (which, by ancient tradition, was kept set to Greenwich Mean Time aboard all units of the Solarian League Navy), but one of its multiple displays was set to Torch planetary time, and his mind did the math automatically. If the bogeys had made their alpha translation at <<7:43|2>>, local, then they\'d been in normal-space for almost four minutes now. They\'d still be a minute or so short of the hyper limit - no one wanted to hit a hyper limit too closely, especially when that limit lay inside a gravity wave, like the Torch System\'s, which made things even more complicated than usual for an astrogator.',
