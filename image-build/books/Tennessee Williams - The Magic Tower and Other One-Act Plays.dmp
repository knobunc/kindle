When I wake up I call her or she calls me, and if we\x{2019}re not working, or get off work at <<five|9c:1>>, we make a date to meet somewhere and just, just\x{2014}kill time together.

He was looking through movie magazines on the magazine rack in that Walgreen\x{2019}s. We struck up a conversation. He looked like a kid, my girlfriend Georgia said I was robbing the cradle. Well, I have this maternal chord in me and he touched it. It was my birthday. I don\x{2019}t suppose it would have happened except on my birthday. My birthday reminded me how long I\x{2019}d been just wand\x{2019}ring around on the loose, each day like the other and no change in the future except time passing me by. I was scared.

            "It is the three plays belonging to the 1940s, and one from <<1939|9c:1>>, that present the Williams we are most familiar with. Besides the Menagerie pencil-sketch of The Pretty Trap, we can see a very preliminary, very successful character study for Serafina in The Rose Tattoo as Mrs. Pocciotti in The Dark Room (1939). The playwright is clearly in love with his fractured-English-speaking immigrant. She leaps off the page as swiftly and completely as she will in her full-length incarnation eleven years later. Williams enjoyed writing with famous actresses in mind. The Case of the Crushed Petunias (1941) is \x{201c}respectfully dedicated to the talent and charm of Miss Helen Hayes,\x{201d} and Miss Dorothy Simple is a part a charming and talented actress could have a triumph with. One wonders if Miss Hayes ever read it. In this play, the nameless Young Man is the harbinger of life. Twenty years later the Young Man in The Milk Train Doesn\x{2019}t Stop Here Anymore (1963) will become the Angel of Death.",

            "It was in 1939 that \x{201c}the first three sketches in the series AMERICAN BLUES\x{201d} won Williams \x{201c}a special prize\x{201d} of \$100.00 from the prestigious Group Theatre. Though it has never been established exactly which short plays Williams submitted, it can be plausibly inferred from references in his letters, journals, and the typed lists (discussed below), that he had submitted four: Moony\x{2019}s Kid Don\x{2019}t Cry, The Dark Room, Hello From Bertha, and The Long Goodbye. To meet the contest requirement of being twenty-five or younger, Williams \x{201c}changed\x{201d} his birth year from <<1911|9c:0>> and wrote it as 1914 on the entry form. Just for good measure, he went ahead and used his nickname as his first name and submitted his plays as \x{201c}Tennessee Williams.\x{201d} This was done in December 1938, just before he left on his first trip to New Orleans.",

Other examples include Fugitive Kind, Not About Nightingales, Honor the Living, The Palooka, In Our Profession, Every Twenty Minutes, The Pink Bedroom, The Magic Tower, and The Big Game. According to the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), Hollywood released nearly fifty gangster films in 1935 alone, and over a dozen of those with plots involving a \x{201c}squealer.\x{201d} Williams dropped mob crime as subject matter from <<about 1940|18:1>> until the 1970s when it appeared again in I Never Get Dressed Till After Dark on Sundays, Vieux Carr\x{e9}, and Something Cloudy, Something Clear.",

Williams\x{2019}s second attempt, Hot Milk at <<Three in the Morning|9a>>, written in 1932 for the same annual contest, bears a strong connection to Eugene O\x{2019}Neill\x{2019}s one-act Before Breakfast.
