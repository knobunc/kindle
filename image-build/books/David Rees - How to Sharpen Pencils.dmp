            "Remember: A pencil point enjoyed by the writer may not be suited for the draftsman; the ideal point for the standardized-test taker laboring in an over-lit classroom may not please the louche poet idling on a windswept peak. No point can serve all needs. The unsharpened pencil is, in contrast, an idealized form. Putting a point on a pencil\x{2014}making it functional\x{2014}is to lead it out of Plato\x{2019}s cave and into the <<noonday|13>> sun of utility. Of course, life outside a cave runs the risk of imperfection and frustration. But we must learn to live with these risks if we want enough oxygen to survive.",

(Readers are invited to join me in referring to this point as \x{201c}the Lamborghini Countach,\x{201d} in honor of the legendary Italian sports car whose image occupied my every waking moment from ages twelve to fourteen.) This example is remarkable for the low ratio of graphite to exposed cedar: <<approximately 1|9:0>>:5. This ensures a point that can withstand greater than normal pressure in application, as most of its graphite core remains buttressed by wood. The flattened tip further suggests its use for intense, heavy mark-making\x{2014}it is easy to imagine this pencil in the calloused hands of the contractor, the butcher, or the shack-dwelling megalomaniac with ideas to share.",
