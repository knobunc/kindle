            "Remember: A pencil point enjoyed by the writer may not be suited for the draftsman; the ideal point for the standardized-test taker laboring in an over-lit classroom may not please the louche poet idling on a windswept peak. No point can serve all needs. The unsharpened pencil is, in contrast, an idealized form. Putting a point on a pencil\x{2014}making it functional\x{2014}is to lead it out of Plato\x{2019}s cave and into the <<noonday|13>> sun of utility. Of course, life outside a cave runs the risk of imperfection and frustration. But we must learn to live with these risks if we want enough oxygen to survive.",

            "One of the most difficult things about playing a guitar behind one\x{2019}s head is that it\x{2019}s impossible to see the strings, frets and buttons of the instrument while doing so. The guitar teacher who begins his first lesson with \x{201c}Put this Les Paul behind your head,\x{201d} is not to be trusted, as the technique requires a long-established comfort and familiarity with the instrument. The same is true for sharpening a pencil behind one\x{2019}s back\x{2014}and is why I don\x{2019}t recommend this novelty technique for anyone with fewer than <<200 hours|1>> of sharpening experience under his or her belt.",
