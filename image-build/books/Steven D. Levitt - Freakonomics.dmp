(Fifth graders taking the test in the eighth month of the year needed to score 5.8, seventh graders 7.8, and so on.) The students in classroom A averaged 5.8 on their sixth-grade tests, which is a full grade level below where they should be. So plainly these are poor students.

Instead of improving by one full point between fifth and sixth grade, as would be expected, they improved by 1.7 points, <<nearly two|9:0>> grades\x{2019} worth.

Thus the name they chose, \x{201c}kuklux,\x{201d} a slight mangling of kuklos, the Greek word for \x{201c}circle.\x{201d} In the beginning, their activities were said to be harmless <<midnight|13>> pranks\x{2014}for instance, riding horses through the countryside while draped in white sheets and pillowcase hoods. But soon the Klan evolved into a multistate terrorist organization designed to frighten and kill emancipated slaves. Among its regional leaders were five former Confederate generals; its staunchest supporters were the plantation owners for whom Reconstruction posed an economic and political nightmare. In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant spelled out for the House of Representatives the true aims of the Ku Klux Klan: \x{201c}By force and terror, to prevent all political action not in accord with the views of the members, to deprive colored citizens of the right to bear arms and of the right of a free ballot, to suppress the schools in which colored children were taught, and to reduce the colored people to a condition closely allied to that of slavery.\x{201d}",

Now for the names that signify the highest level of parental education. These names don\x{2019}t have much in common, phonetically or aesthetically, with the low-education names. The girls\x{2019} names are in most regards diverse, though with a fair share of literary and otherwise artful touches. A caution to prospective parents who are shopping for a \x{201c}smart\x{201d} name: remember that such a name won\x{2019}t make your child smart; it will, however, give her the same name as other smart kids\x{2014}at least for a while.
