            "We consider female baboons with bright red hindquarters bizarre. In fact, we humans are the ones whose scarcely detectable ovulations make us members of a small minority in the animal world. Men have no reliable means of detecting when their partners can be fertilized, nor did women in traditional societies. I grant that many women experience headaches or other sensations around the midpoint of a menstrual cycle. However, they wouldn\x{2019}t know that these are signs of ovulation if they hadn\x{2019}t been told so by scientists\x{2014}and even scientists didn\x{2019}t figure that out until <<around 1930|9c:0>>. Similarly, women can be taught to detect ovulation by monitoring their body temperature or mucus, but that\x{2019}s very different from the instinctive knowledge possessed by female animals. If we too had such instinctive knowledge, manufacturers of ovulation test kits and contraceptives wouldn\x{2019}t be doing such a booming business.",

            "That old person\x{2019}s accumulated experience is important for the whole tribe\x{2019}s survival. For instance, in 1976 I visited Rennell Island in the Solomon Archipelago, lying in the Southwest Pacific\x{2019}s cyclone belt. When I asked about consumption of fruits and seeds by birds, my Rennellese informants gave Rennell-language names for dozens of plant species, listed for each plant species all the bird and bat species that eat its fruit, and stated whether the fruit is edible for people. Those assessments of edibility were ranked in three categories: fruits that people never eat; fruits that people regularly eat; and fruits that people eat only in famine times, such as after\x{2014}and here I kept hearing a Rennell term initially unfamiliar to me\x{2014}after the hungi kengi. Those words proved to be the Rennell name for the most destructive cyclone to have hit the island in living memory\x{2014}apparently <<around 1910|18:0>>, based on people\x{2019}s references to datable events of the European colonial administration. The hungi kengi blew down most of Rennell\x{2019}s forest, destroyed gardens, and drove people to the brink of starvation. Islanders survived by eating the fruits of wild plant species that normally were not eaten, but doing so required detailed knowledge about which plants were poisonous, which were not poisonous, and whether and how the poison could be removed by some technique of food preparation.",

            "When I began pestering my middle-aged Rennellese informants with my questions about fruit edibility, I was brought into a hut. There, in the back of the hut, once my eyes had become accustomed to the dim light, was the inevitable, frail, very old woman, unable to walk without support. She was the last living person with direct experience of the plants found safe and nutritious to eat after the hungi kengi, until people\x{2019}s gardens began producing again. The old woman explained to me that she had been a child not quite of marriageable age at the time of the hungi kengi. Since my visit to Rennell was in 1976, and since the cyclone had struck sixty-six years before, <<around 1910|9:1>>, the woman was probably in her early eighties. Her survival after the 1910 cyclone had depended on information remembered by aged survivors of the last big cyclone before the hungi kengi. Now, the ability of her people to survive another cyclone would depend on her own memories, which fortunately were very detailed.",

            "While these signals that I have just mentioned can be rapidly turned on and off, other signals are wired either permanently or for extended times into an animal\x{2019}s anatomy to convey various types of messages. An animal\x{2019}s sex is indicated by the male/female differences in plumage of many bird species or by the differences in head shape between male and female gorillas or orangutans. As discussed in chapter 4, females of many primate species advertise their time of ovulation by swollen, brightly colored skin on the buttocks or around the vagina. Sexually immature juveniles of most bird species differ in plumage from adults; sexually mature male gorillas acquire a saddle of silvery hairs on the back. Age is signaled more finely in Herring Gulls, which have distinct plumages as juveniles and at <<one|9c:1>>, two, three, and four or more years of age.",
