It was not tethered, though an elaborate fringed pair of reins hung from a headstall chased with silver and arabesques.

    THEY SET OUT in the morning, Holger and Hugi on Papillon. Alianora flew overhead as a swan, curving and soaring and vanishing behind the trees to reappear in an upward swoop. The man\x{2019}s spirits rose with the sun. If nothing else, he was bound somewhere, and seemed to be in good company. By <<noon|13>> their eastward course brought them high in the hills, a rough windy land of scarred boulders, waterfalls and ravines, long harsh grass and gnarled copses.

He bestrode a tall horse, snowy white, with flowing mane and proudly arched neck; yet the beast was subtly wrong to look at, too long of leg, too small of head. The rider was in full plate armor, his visor down so that he showed no face; white plumes nodded on the helmet, his shield was blank and black, all else shimmered <<midnight|13>> blue. He halted and let Holger approach him.',

This world seemed full of extraordinary lookers. She was human, taller and more full-bodied than the Faerie ladies, long <<midnight|13>> hair coiled under a golden coronet, her white satin dress sweeping the floor.
