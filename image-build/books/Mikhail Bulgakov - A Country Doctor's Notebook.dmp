            "To cut a long story short, my driver and I spent exactly twenty-four hours covering the thirty-two miles which separate the district town of Grachyovka from Muryovo hospital. Indeed so nearly exactly twenty-four hours that it was uncanny: at <<2 p.m.|5>> on 16 September 1916 we were at the last corn-chandler\x{2019}s store on the outskirts of the remarkable town of Grachyovka, and at <<five past two|10>> on 17 September of that same unforgettable year 1916, I was in the Muryovo hospital yard, standing on trampled, withered grass, flattened by the September rain. My legs were ossified with cold, so much so that as I stood there bemused, I mentally leafed through the textbook pages in an inane attempt to remember whether there was such a complaint as ossification of the muscles or whether it was an illness I had dreamed up while asleep the night before in the village of Grabilovka. What the devil was it in Latin? Every single muscle ached unbearably, like toothache. There is nothing I can say about my toes\x{2014}they lay immobile in my boots, as rigid as wooden stumps. I confess that in a burst of cowardice I pronounced a whispered curse on the medical profession and on the application form I had handed in five years earlier to the rector of the university. All the time a fine rain was drizzling down as through a sieve. My coat had swelled like a sponge. I vainly tried to grasp my suitcase with the fingers of my right hand, but in the end spat on the wet grass in disgust. My fingers were incapable of gripping anything. It was then, stuffed as I was with all sorts of knowledge from fascinating medical books, that I suddenly remembered the name of the illness\x{2014}palsy. \x{2018}Paralysis\x{2019}, I said to myself in despair, God knows why.",

I certainly shan\x{2019}t be going to Grachyovka for a month yet. Just think\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}I actually had to put up for the night en route! When we had only driven fifteen miles and it was as black as the tomb\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}it was night\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}we had to stop in Grabilovka, a school teacher put us up.

One wheel got stuck in a ditch, the other swung up into the air, my case fell on to my feet with a crash, we slithered from side to side, lurching forward one moment, backward the next. And all the time a fine rain drizzling down and my bones turning to ice. Who\x{2019}d believe you can freeze as easily in the middle of a grey, miserable September as in the depth of winter? Ah well, it seems you can. And as you die a slow death there\x{2019}s nothing to look at except the same endless monotony. On the right the bare, undulating fields and on the left a stunted copse, flanked by five or six grey, dilapidated shacks. Not a living soul in them, it seems, and not a sound to be heard.\x{2019}",

It is a long time since I last wrote anything in my diary. A pity, because in fact this is not a diary but a pathological history. Not only do I have a natural professional interest in it, but it is my only friend in the world (if one doesn\x{2019}t count my sad and often tearful mistress Anna). So if I am to record the progress of my disease, here it is: I inject myself with morphine twice every twenty-four hours\x{2014}at <<five o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>> (after supper) and at <<midnight|13>> before going to bed. Two syringes of a 3% solution; my dose is thus 50 milligrammes. A fair amount!",

Three syringes of a 3% solution. That will last me until <<midnight|13>>.
Nonsense. That last entry was nonsense. It\x{2019}s not as bad as that. Sooner or later I\x{2019}ll give it up\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}but now I need sleep, sleep.",

            'By <<1916|9n:0>>, despite heavy losses from two years of fighting, the Russian army was only capable of absorbing a marginal increase in manpower. This factor, together with the strain placed on civilian medical resources by mobilisation, meant that Bulgakov and many of his fellow graduates of that year were not conscripted as army doctors. Without doing the normal hospital internship on qualifying, they were instead drafted to local government clinics and country hospitals all over Russia. It is perhaps not generally realised that pre-revolutionary Russia possessed a very creditable rural medical service, financed and managed by the provincial government authorities or Zemstvos. These were elective bodies, of which the nearest British equivalents are perhaps the County Councils, and they were responsible for such matters as education, roads and public health.',
