            'In 1912 Crofts married Mary Bellas Canning, the daughter of a bank manager. In 1919, after suffering a severe illness, he spent the endless hours of his long convalescence writing a story to amuse himself. He found this occupation enjoyable and later sent the story, The Cask (1920), to a London firm that secured publication. It was acclaimed as a classic, was translated into many languages, and within two decades had sold more than one hundred thousand copies. Crofts immediately started work on a successor and continued to turn out about a book a year until <<1929|9c:0>>, when he was forced to stop working for a while because of poor health.',

            "An abrupt departure from his previous work, The <<12.30|5a:0>> from Croyden (1934) is an inverted tale about Charles Swinburn\x{2019}s plan to kill his rich uncle on a plane. We follow Swinburn as he conceives his perfect crime, executes it, tries to evade the penalty of the law, and hears the jury\x{2019}s verdict. The narrative then switches to the voice of Inspector French, who wraps everything up in the last two chapters by telling how he was able to solve the case. Most of Crofts\x{2019}s previous work had stressed plot and was the product of a mind trained in mathematics and engineering, but in this work he delved deeply into character to produce a masterpiece of the inverted form. Crofts never repeated this performance in a novel-length work, confining his subsequent use of the inverted form to short stories, as in Anything to Declare? (1957) and the collections Many a Slip (1955), and The Mystery of the Sleeping Car Express and Other Stories (1956).",
