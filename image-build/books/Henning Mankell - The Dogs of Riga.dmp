Wallander had to help Baiba, who was so exhausted she was barely conscious. It was still dark when they set off. While she was asleep on the floor beside him, he had lain awake and thought about what they should do. He knew he was obliged to have a plan ready. Baiba would hardly be able to help him any more: she had burnt her bridges, and was now as much of an outlaw as he was. From now on he was also her saviour, and it seemed to him as he lay there in the darkness that he was no longer capable of making any plans, he\'d run out of ideas.',

Mikelis was waiting behind a desk, and Wallander wondered how on earth he had explained away his presence there. In a loud, shrill voice he protested in English about having been mugged in the street. The bastards had not only taken his money, but they\'d also stolen his holy of holies, his passport.',

            'The first rendezvous that he had agreed with Baiba was at <<12.30 p.m.|2a>> Wallander stood in the shadows by the old church in Esplanade Park that had been turned into a planetarium. All around him were tall, bare, motionless lime trees. There was no sign of her. The pain in his hand was now almost unbearable. When it reached <<1.15 p.m.|2a>>, he was forced to accept that something must have happened. She wasn\'t going to come. He was extremely worried. Inese\'s blood-covered face hovered in his mind\'s eye, and he tried to work out what might have gone wrong. Had the dogs and their handlers realised that Wallander had managed to slip out of the university building unseen, despite their best efforts? In which case, what would they have done with Baiba? He did not dare to even think about that. He left the park, not knowing where to go next. What made him keep walking along the dark, deserted streets was really the pain in his hand. A military jeep with sirens blaring forced him to leap headfirst into a dark entrance, and not long afterwards a police car came racing down the street he was walking along, forcing him once more to withdraw into the shadows. He had put the file containing the major\'s testimony down the front of his shirt, and the edges were scratching against his ribs. He wondered where he was going to spend the night. The temperature had dropped, and he was trembling with cold. The alternative rendezvous he and Baiba had agreed on was the fourth floor of the central department store, but that wasn\'t until <<10 a.m.|5>> the next morning, so he had nine hours to fill and couldn\'t possibly spend them walking the streets. He was convinced he had broken his hand, and knew he should go to a doctor, he daren\'t go to a casualty department. Not now that he had the testimony with him. He wondered whether he ought to try and find shelter for the night at the Swedish Embassy, assuming there was one, but he didn\'t like that option either. What if the law said that a Swedish police officer who had entered the country illegally should be sent home immediately under guard? He daren\'t take the risk.',

It contained about 50 typewritten pages, plus some blurred photocopies, but no photographs, which was what he had hoped for. The major\'s text was in Latvian, and Wallander couldn\'t understand a word. He noted that from page nine onwards the names Murniers and Putnis kept recurring at regular intervals: sometimes they were together in the same sentence. He couldn\'t work out what that meant, whether both colonels were being accused or whether the major\'s accusing finger had been pointed at just one of them. He gave up the attempt to decipher the secret document, put the file down on the floor, refilled the hand basin with water, and leaned his head back against the edge of the table. It was <<4 a.m.|5>>, and he dozed off. When he woke up with a start, he found he\'d been asleep for 10 minutes. His hand had started hurting again, and the cold water was no longer easing the pain. He finished off what was left in the vodka bottle, wrapped a damp towel round his hand, and lay down on the bed.',
