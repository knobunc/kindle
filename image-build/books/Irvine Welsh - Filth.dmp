They aw came back Bruce. Aw the corpses, aw the abused bairns\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. aw the twisted and broken people\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. and ah kept thinkin why? It shouldnae be like that\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. it shouldnae\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. why?  He grabs my wrist and glowers at me, but I\x{2019}m looking right past him at the nurse. She\x{2019}s wearing these stockings which are probably tights but I choose to think of them as stockings and they have the seams which run right up the back of her legs defining those excellent calves and thighs and phoa\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. but I can\x{2019}t say anything to Clelland, who\x{2019}s still whispering \x{2018}Why?\x{2019} intently at me. I feel like just telling him why. In two simple words: natural selection mate, natural selection. The twisted, broken people go to the wall and you are one of them my friend. Same rules. Clell was always a weak, sensitive, commie poof under that jokey exterior. Lacked the big-match temperament. Didn\x{2019}t have the bottle. The Inglis factor is well at play here. Personally, I\x{2019}d rather wade through a stack of bodies than a stack of forms any day of the week.  It dawns on me that I don\x{2019}t know what I\x{2019}m doing here. I feel like that Rolf Harris fucker, or whoever it is, that goes to visit the bairns in hospital on Christmas Day. Only it\x{2019}s the big bairns who are unfit to do a man\x{2019}s job that I\x{2019}m visiting.  \x{2013} Must go Clell, I say, forcibly freeing my wrist, \x{2013} Carole\x{2019}s pulled out aw the stops wi the turkey dinner this time roond. Call ays a traditionalist if ye like, but there\x{2019}s something aboot that faimly Christmas dinner.  \x{2013} Jackie never came in\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. she phoned but\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. he says.  \x{2013} They tell ays that they fair dae the business on Christmas Day in these places. Yir in the right hands Clell, I tell him. I clock that wee nurse again. \x{2013} Especially wi her there! Ah\x{2019}d git a bedbath fae her\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. never mind a bedbath, ah\x{2019}d git a fuckin enema off her! And return the fuckin compliment! Phoa! Anyhow, see ye Clell! Merry Christmas! Keep the pecker up, I wink departing, \x{2013} Mine would be up anywey, in a place like this! Too right!  As I leave the gibbering oaf I see the nurses start to serve up the Christmas nosh for some other enfeebled lunatics on the ward. They\x{2019}re mostly stupid young cunts; anorexic, junkies and what have you, inadequates who can\x{2019}t cope with life. They should sling the fuckin load of them oot intae the snaw instead of wasting the taxpayer\x{2019}s dough pampering them wi turkey and trimmings served up by rides in seamed stockings. It\x{2019}s a fuckin disgrace. We\x{2019}d aw like that!  I consider trying to take one of the dishes, but there\x{2019}s too many staff around.  Instead I go back hame and re-stoke the fire, Toal\x{2019}s manuscript now reduced to a pile of ashes. I heat up some more beans which I spice up with curry powder and do some toast. I listen to that daft, smelly, rich auld cunt talk her usual shite at <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>>. I\x{2019}m a mason awright, and I swear allegiance to the crown as an institution, but as people the Royal Family are the saddest shower of spastics that ever walked the third planet of the solar system.  Thankfully, for Christmas night there\x{2019}s a do up in the club at Shrubhill. No many people in though, it being Christmas and that. Brother Blades is present though, and we both get three sheets. He has to hold me up for \x{2018}God Save the Queen\x{2019}. He\x{2019}s droning on about Bunty, something about an argument and his mother but I can\x{2019}t make out a word of it. I lose him and stagger out into the cold. The chill revives me a bit and I get a taxi from a guy in the Lodge and head back home. I get in and I snort back some more charlie and I\x{2019}m tanning another bottle of Grouse. I stick on Van Halen\x{2019}s Women and Children First as loud as it will go and play air guitar, specialising in the Jimmy Page chicken dance. Inbetween tracks I hear a loud knock at the door.  Stronach and his wife are on my doorstep. He\x{2019}s playing tomorrow, against Motherwell, I think. Boxing Day fixture. I can\x{2019}t hear anything, because the next track\x{2019}s started up and it\x{2019}s really loud. I can just see the two mouths opening like fish. They\x{2019}re both in their tracksuits. I raise my hand to silence them then I go through and turn the music down before coming back out.  \x{2013} Merry Christmas Tom! Julie! I shout.  \x{2013} God Bruce! Cool yir jets man! We\x{2019}re tryin tae git some sleep! Stronach whines, his stupid belligerent face scanning for signs of me registering his plight.  \x{2013} Don\x{2019}t fuckin trespass on my property Stronach! If you\x{2019}ve a complaint to make about the noise level, call the fuckin polis! It\x{2019}s Christmas fuckin Day!  I push him in the chest and he jerks backwards off the doorstep. I slam the door shut in his daft face.  That cunt\x{2019}s got all fuckin year tae sleep. I work aw fuckin year.  I try to watch some telly through one eye. There\x{2019}s a Channel Four film on, where you get a brief flash of some wee French slag\x{2019}s fanny, arse and tits. I think about that wee nurse again and I resolve to keep up these visits to my mate Clell, on a regular basis. It\x{2019}s impossible to read the Teletext to see what\x{2019}s due on, and just as hard to read the fuckin Radio Times.  I\x{2019}m cunted.",
