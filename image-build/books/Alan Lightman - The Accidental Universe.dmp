            "We can categorize religious beliefs according to the degree to which God acts in the world. At <<one|9m>> extreme is atheism: God does not exist, period. Next comes deism. A prominent belief in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and partly motivated to incorporate the new science with theological thinking, deism holds that God created the universe but has not acted thereafter. Voltaire considered himself a deist. Moving in the direction of a more vigorous God, next comes immanentism: God created the universe and the physical laws and continues to act but only through repeated application of those fixed laws. (See, for example, God\x{2019}s Activity in the World: The Contemporary Problem, edited by Owen Thomas.) While immanentism differs philosophically from deism, it is functionally equivalent because God does not perform miracles in the world, and the central doctrine of science is upheld. One can argue that Einstein believed in an immanentist God. Finally comes what some theologians call interventionism (see, for example, Charles Hodge in Systematic Theology): From time to time, God can and does act to violate the laws.",

            "The first large object ever accurately measured was the Earth, accomplished in the third century BC by Eratosthenes, a geographer who administered the great library in Alexandria. From travelers, Eratosthenes had heard the intriguing report that at <<noon|13>> on June 21, in the town of Syene, due south of Alexandria, the sun cast no shadow at the bottom of a deep well. Evidently, the sun is directly overhead at that time and that place. (Before the invention of clocks, \x{201c}<<noon|13>>\x{201d} could be defined at each place as the moment when the sun was highest in the sky, whether that was exactly vertical or not.) Eratosthenes knew that the sun was not overhead at <<noon|13>> in Alexandria. In fact, it was tipped 7.2 degrees from the vertical, or about one-fiftieth of a circle\x{2014}something he could determine by measuring the length of the shadow cast by a stick in the ground. That the sun could be overhead in one place and not at another was due to the curve of the Earth. Eratosthenes then reasoned that if he knew the distance from Alexandria to Syene, the full circumference of the Earth must be about fifty times that distance. Traders passing through Alexandria told him that camels could make the trip to Syene in about fifty days, and it was known that a camel could cover one hundred stadia (approximately 11.3 miles) in a day. So the ancient geographer estimated that Syene and Alexandria were about 570 miles apart. Consequently, the complete circumference of the Earth he figured to be about 50 \x{d7} 570 miles, or 28,500 miles. This number was within 15 percent of the modern measurement, an amazing feat considering the imprecision of using camels as odometers.",

            'As another example, which you can test for yourself, drop a weight to the floor from a height of 4 feet and time the duration of its fall. You should get about 0.5 seconds. From a height of 8 feet, you should get about 0.7 seconds. From a height of 16 feet, <<about 1|9:0>> second. Repeat from several more heights and you will discover the rule that the time exactly doubles with every quadrupling of the height, a rule found by Galileo in the seventeenth century. With this rule, you can now predict the time to fall from any height. You have witnessed, firsthand, the lawfulness of nature.',

            "Then there is the contrary in us. In their excellent book Wonders and the Order of Nature, historians of science Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park detail humankind\x{2019}s fascination with wonders and oddities. Things that don\x{2019}t fit. Surprises and peculiarities. Marco Polo enthuses over finding completely black lions in the Indian kingdom of Quilon. James of Vitry reports on the strange \x{201c}<<midnight|13>> sun\x{201d} of Iceland, men with tails in Britain, women with huge goiters in the Burgundian Alps. Other travelers excitedly record gourds with little lamblike animals inside, beasts with the faces of humans and the tails of scorpions, unicorns, men with heads as hairy as dogs, petrifying lakes, colored mountains, plants that produce hallucinations, waters that cure disease, the powers of planets in juxtaposition, people who vomit worms, virgin births, powders that sexually arouse. And on and on. In his essay \x{201c}Of Miracles\x{201d} (1748), the Scottish philosopher David Hume writes that \x{201c}the passion of surprise and wonder, arising from miracles, being an agreeable emotion, gives a sensible tendency towards the belief of those events from which it is derived.\x{201d} More recently, the French philosopher Michel Foucault has written, \x{201c}Curiosity pleases me. It evokes\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}a readiness to find strange and singular what surrounds us; a certain relentlessness to break up our familiarities.\x{201d} Daston and Park make the case that the attraction to marvels and miracles is more prevalent in the ignorant and has diminished over the centuries. I suggest that if we enlarge the category of miracles to include surprises and observations that do not fit within conventional thinking or known explanations, such unruly attractions still exist today, and in quite a few educated and civilized people. Consider Professor Spiropulu of Caltech. Or poet Wallace Stevens, who wrote: \x{201c}It is the mundo of the imagination in which the imaginative man delights and not the gaunt world of reason.\x{201d} Or the recent Pew survey showing that two-thirds of Americans believe in supernatural events.",
