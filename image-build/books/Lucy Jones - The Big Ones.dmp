Aceh Province, at the north end of the island of Sumatra, was at the southern end of the earthquake rupture, and its proximity to the fault meant it suffered some of the worst effects. Many buildings in the province of Aceh and its capital, Banda Aceh, were badly damaged from the shaking. Tsunami waves arrived soon after the mainshock ended, even as aftershocks continued. Along the western coast of Aceh, wave height was fifty to one hundred feet. The number of dead is uncertain, because many people were washed out to sea, their bodies never recovered. We know that the total number of dead or missing in Indonesia was more than two hundred thousand, three times as many as in any other country, and most were from Aceh Province. The first floors of most buildings in Banda Aceh, a city with almost three hundred thousand residents, were flooded, and 10 percent of the population perished.
