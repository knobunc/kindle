            "ONE NIGHT some twenty years ago, during a siege of mumps in our enormous family, my youngest sister, Franny, was moved, crib and all, into the ostensibly germ-free room I shared with my eldest brother, Seymour. I was fifteen, Seymour was seventeen. Along <<about two in the morning|9h>>, the new roommate\x{2019}s crying wakened me. I lay in a still, neutral position for a few minutes, listening to the racket, till I heard, or felt, Seymour stir in the bed next to mine. In those days, we kept a flashlight on the night table between us, for emergencies that, as far as I remember, never arose. Seymour turned it on and got out of bed. \x{201c}The bottle\x{2019}s on the stove, Mother said,\x{201d} I told him. \x{201c}I gave it to her a little while ago,\x{201d} Seymour said. \x{201c}She isn\x{2019}t hungry.\x{201d} He went over in the dark to the bookcase and beamed the flashlight slowly back and forth along the stacks. I sat up in bed. \x{201c}What are you going to do?\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}I thought maybe I\x{2019}d read something to her,\x{201d} Seymour said, and took down a book. \x{201c}She\x{2019}s ten months old, for God\x{2019}s sake,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}I know,\x{201d} Seymour said. \x{201c}They have ears. They can hear.\x{201d}",

            "I\x{2019}m in a terrible rush to pack, so this will be short but penetrating. Admiral Behind-pincher has decided that he must fly to parts unknown for the war effort and has also decided to take his secretary with him if I behave myself. I\x{2019}m just sick about it. Seymour aside, it means Quonset huts in freezing air bases and boyish passes from our fighting men and those horrible paper things to get sick in on the plane. The point is, Seymour is getting married\x{2014}yes, married, so please pay attention. I can\x{2019}t be there. I may be gone for anywhere from six weeks to two months on this trip. I\x{2019}ve met the girl. She\x{2019}s a zero in my opinion but terrific-looking. I don\x{2019}t actually know that she\x{2019}s a zero. I mean she hardly said two words the night I met her. Just sat and smiled and smoked, so it isn\x{2019}t fair to say. I don\x{2019}t know anything about the romance itself at all, except that they apparently met when Seymour was stationed at Monmouth last winter. The mother is the end\x{2014}a finger in all the arts, and sees a good Jungian man twice a week (she asked me twice, the night I met her, if I\x{2019}d ever been analyzed). She told me she just wishes Seymour would relate to more people. In the same breath, said she just loves him, though, etc., etc., and that she used to listen to him religiously all the years he was on the air. That\x{2019}s all I know except that you\x{2019}ve got to get to the wedding. I\x{2019}ll never forgive you if you don\x{2019}t. I mean it. Mother and Daddy can\x{2019}t get here from the Coast. Franny has the measles, for one thing. Incidentally, did you hear her last week? She went on at beautiful length about how she used to fly all around the apartment when she was four and no one was home. The new announcer is worse than Grant\x{2014}if possible, even worse than Sullivan in the old days. He said she surely just dreamt that she was able to fly. The baby stood her ground like an angel. She said she knew she was able to fly because when she came down she always had dust on her fingers from touching the light bulbs. I long to see her. You, too. Anyhow, you\x{2019}ve got to get to the wedding. Go A.W.O.L. if you have to, but please go. It\x{2019}s at <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>>, June 4th. Very non-sectarian and Emancipated, at her grandmother\x{2019}s house on 63rd. Some judge is marrying them. I don\x{2019}t know the number of the house, but it\x{2019}s exactly two doors down from where Carl and Amy used to live in luxury. I\x{2019}m going to wire Walt, but I think he\x{2019}s been shipped out already. Please get there, Buddy. He weighs about as much as a cat and he has that ecstatic look on his face that you can\x{2019}t talk to. Maybe it\x{2019}s going to be perfectly all right, but I hate 1942. I think I\x{2019}ll hate 1942 till I die, just on general principles. All my love and see you when I get back.",

            "All sit-up coaches on trains in 1942 were only nominally ventilated, as I remember, abounded with M.P.s, and smelled of orange juice, milk, and rye whiskey. I spent the night coughing and reading a copy of Ace Comics that someone was kind enough to lend me. When the train pulled into New York\x{2014}at <<ten after two|10>> on the afternoon of the wedding\x{2014}I was coughed out, generally exhausted, perspiring, unpressed, and my adhesive tape was itching hellishly. New York itself was indescribably hot. I had no time to go to my apartment first, so I left my luggage, which consisted of a rather oppressive-looking little canvas zipper bag, in one of those steel boxes at Penn Station. To make things still more provocative, as I was wandering around in the garment district trying to find an empty cab, a second lieutenant in the Signal Corps, whom I\x{2019}d apparently overlooked saluting, crossing Seventh Avenue, suddenly took out a fountain pen and wrote down my name, serial number, and address while a number of civilians looked interestedly on.",

As soon as we arrived in that block, however, it was very simple. One just followed the crowd. There was even a canvas canopy. A moment later, I entered an enormous old brownstone and was met by a very handsome, lavender-haired woman, who asked me whether I was a friend of the bride or the groom. I said the groom. \x{201c}Oh,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}well, we\x{2019}re just bunching everybody up together.\x{201d} She laughed rather immoderately, and showed me to what seemed to be the last vacant folding chair in a very crowded outsize room. I have a thirteen-year-old blackout in my mind with regard to the overall physical details of the room. Beyond the fact that it was jam-packed and stifling hot, I can remember only two things: that there was an organ playing almost directly behind me, and that the woman in the seat directly at my right turned to me and enthusiastically stage-whispered, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m Helen Silsburn!\x{201d} From the location of our seats, I gathered that she was not the bride\x{2019}s mother, but, to play it safe, I smiled and nodded gregariously, and was about to say who I was, but she put a decorous finger to her lips, and we both faced front. It was then, roughly, <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>>. I closed my eyes and waited, a trifle guardedly, for the organist to quit the incidental music and plunge into \x{201c}Lohengrin.\x{201d}",

She was then deposited\x{2014}almost hand over hand, it seemed\x{2014}into the first of the sleek black hired cars that were waiting, double-parked, at the curb. It was an excessively graphic moment\x{2014}a tabloid moment\x{2014}and, as tabloid moments go, it had its full complement of eyewitnesses, for the wedding guests (myself among them) had already begun to pour out of the building, however decorously, in alert, not to say goggle-eyed, droves. If there was any even faintly lenitive aspect to the spectacle, the weather itself was responsible for it. The June sun was so hot and so glaring, of such multi-flashbulb-like mediacy, that the image of the bride, as she made her almost invalided way down the stone steps, tended to blur where blurring mattered most.",

            "\x{201c}We got passes till <<midnight|13>>, after the parade. I met Muriel at the Biltmore at <<seven|9c:1>>. Two drinks, two drugstore tuna-fish sandwiches, then a movie she wanted to see, something with Greer Garson in it. I looked at her several times in the dark when Greer Garson\x{2019}s son\x{2019}s plane was missing in action. Her mouth was open. Absorbed, worried. The identification with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer tragedy complete. I felt awe and happiness. How I love and need her undiscriminating heart. She looked over at me when the children in the picture brought in the kitten to show to their mother. M. loved the kitten and wanted me to love it. Even in the dark, I could sense that she felt the usual estrangement from me when I don\x{2019}t automatically love what she loves. Later, when we were having a drink at the station, she asked me if I didn\x{2019}t think that kitten was \x{2018}rather nice.\x{2019} She doesn\x{2019}t use the word \x{2018}cute\x{2019} any more. When did I ever frighten her out of her normal vocabulary? Bore that I am, I mentioned R. H. Blyth\x{2019}s definition of sentimentality: that we are being sentimental when we give to a thing more tenderness than God gives to it. I said (sententiously?) that God undoubtedly loves kittens, but not, in all probability, with Technicolor bootees on their paws. He leaves that creative touch to script writers. M. thought this over, seemed to agree with me, but the \x{2018}knowledge\x{2019} wasn\x{2019}t too very welcome. She sat stirring her drink and feeling unclose to me. She worries over the way her love for me comes and goes, appears and disappears. She doubts its reality simply because it isn\x{2019}t as steadily pleasurable as a kitten. God knows it is sad.

            "\x{201c}We didn\x{2019}t get our passes directly after retreat this evening, because someone dropped his rifle while the visiting British general was making his inspection. I missed the <<5:52|2>> and was an hour late meeting Muriel. Dinner at Lun Far\x{2019}s on 58th. M. irritable and tearful throughout dinner, genuinely upset and scared. Her mother thinks I\x{2019}m a schizoid personality. Apparently she\x{2019}s spoken to her psychoanalyst about me, and he agrees with her. Mrs. Fedder has asked Muriel to find out discreetly if there\x{2019}s any insanity in the family. I gather that Muriel was na\x{ef}ve enough to tell her where I got the scars on my wrists, poor sweet baby. From what M. says, however, this doesn\x{2019}t bother her mother nearly so much as a couple of other things. Three other things. <<One|9k:0>>, I withdraw from and fail to relate to people. <<Two|9k:0>>, apparently there is something \x{2018}wrong\x{2019} with me because I haven\x{2019}t seduced Muriel. <<Three|9k:0>>, evidently Mrs. Fedder has been haunted for days by my remark at dinner one night that I\x{2019}d like to be a dead cat. She asked me at dinner last week what I intended to do after I got out of the Army. Did I intend to resume teaching at the same college? Would I go back to teaching at all? Would I consider going back on the radio, possibly as a \x{2018}commentator\x{2019} of some kind? I answered that it seemed to me that the war might go on forever, and that I was only certain that if peace ever came again I would like to be a dead cat. Mrs. Fedder thought I was cracking a joke of some kind. A sophisticated joke. She thinks I\x{2019}m very sophisticated, according to Muriel. She thought my deadly-serious comment was the sort of joke one ought to acknowledge with a light, musical laugh. When she laughed, I suppose it distracted me a little, and I forgot to explain to her. I told Muriel tonight that in Zen Buddhism a master was once asked what was the most valuable thing in the world, and the master answered that a dead cat was, because no one could put a price on it. M. was relieved, but I could see she could hardly wait to get home to assure her mother of the harmlessness of my remark. She rode to the station with me in the cab. How sweet she was, and in so much better humor. She was trying to teach me to smile, spreading the muscles around my mouth with her fingers. How beautiful it is to see her laugh. Oh, God, I\x{2019}m so happy with her. If only she could be happier with me. I amuse her at times, and she seems to like my face and hands and the back of my head, and she gets a vast satisfaction out of telling her friends that she\x{2019}s engaged to the Billy Black who was on \x{2018}It\x{2019}s a Wise Child\x{2019} for years. And I think she feels a mixed maternal and sexual drive in my general direction. But on the whole I don\x{2019}t make her really happy. Oh, God, help me. My one terrible consolation is that my beloved has an undying, basically undeviating love for the institution of marriage itself. She has a primal urge to play house permanently. Her marital goals are so absurd and touching. She wants to get a very dark sun tan and go up to the desk clerk in some very posh hotel and ask if her Husband has picked up the mail yet. She wants to shop for curtains. She wants to shop for maternity clothes. She wants to get out of her mother\x{2019}s house, whether she knows it or not, and despite her attachment to her. She wants children\x{2014}good-looking children, with her features, not mine. I have a feeling, too, that she wants her own Christmas-tree ornaments to unbox annually, not her mother\x{2019}s.",

Mrs. Fedder\x{2019}s analyst was there for dinner and grilled me, off and on, till <<about eleven-thirty|9f>>. Occasionally with great skill, intelligence. Once or twice, I found myself pulling for him. Apparently he\x{2019}s an old fan of Buddy\x{2019}s and mine. He seemed personally as well as professionally interested in why I\x{2019}d been bounced off the show at sixteen. He\x{2019}d actually heard the Lincoln broadcast, but he had the impression that I\x{2019}d said over the air that the Gettysburg Address was \x{2018}bad for children.\x{2019} Not true. I told him I\x{2019}d said I thought it was a bad speech for children to have to memorize in school. He also had the impression I\x{2019}d said it was a dishonest speech. I told him I\x{2019}d said that 51,112 men were casualties at Gettysburg, and that if someone had to speak at the anniversary of the event, he should simply have come forward and shaken his fist at his audience and then walked off\x{2014}that is, if the speaker was an absolutely honest man. He didn\x{2019}t disagree with me, but he seemed to feel that I have a perfection complex of some kind. Much talk from him, and quite intelligent, on the virtues of living the imperfect life, of accepting one\x{2019}s own and others\x{2019} weaknesses. I agree with him, but only in theory. I\x{2019}ll champion indiscrimination till doomsday, on the ground that it leads to health and a kind of very real, enviable happiness. Followed purely, it\x{2019}s the way of the Tao, and undoubtedly the highest way. But for a discriminating man to achieve this, it would mean that he would have to dispossess himself of poetry, go beyond poetry. That is, he couldn\x{2019}t possibly learn or drive himself to like bad poetry in the abstract, let alone equate it with good poetry. He would have to drop poetry altogether. I said it would be no easy thing to do. Dr. Sims said I was putting it too stringently\x{2014}putting it, he said, as only a perfectionist would. Can I deny that?",

            "I\x{2019}d like to start out with some rather unstinting words about those two opening quotations. \x{201c}The actors by their presence . . . \x{201d} is from Kafka. The second one\x{2014}\x{201c}It is (to describe it figuratively) as if an author were to make a slip of the pen . . .\x{201d}\x{2014}is from Kierkegaard (and it\x{2019}s all I can do to keep from unattractively rubbing my hands together at the thought that this particular Kierkegaard passage may catch a few Existentialists and somewhat overpublished French mandarins with their\x{2014}well, by some little surprise). I don\x{2019}t really deeply feel that anyone needs an airtight reason for quoting from the works of writers he loves, but it\x{2019}s always nice, I\x{2019}ll grant you, if he has one. In this case, it seems to me that those two passages, especially in contiguity, are wonderfully representative of the best, in a sense, not only of Kafka and Kierkegaard but of all the four dead men, the four variously notorious Sick Men or underadjusted bachelors (probably only van Gogh, of the four, will be excused from making a guest appearance in these pages), whom I most often run to\x{2014}occasionally in real distress\x{2014}when I want any perfectly credible information about modern artistic processes. By and large, I\x{2019}ve reproduced the two passages to try to suggest very plainly how I think I stand in regard to the overall mass of data I hope to assemble here\x{2014}a thing that in some quarters, I don\x{2019}t a bit mind saying, an author can\x{2019}t be too explicit about, or any too early. In part, though, it would be rewarding for me to think, to dream, that those two short quotations may quite conceivably serve as a sort of spot convenience to the comparatively new breed of literary critics\x{2014}the many workers (soldiers, I suppose you could say) who put in long hours, often with waning hopes of distinction, in our busy neo-Freudian Arts and Letters clinics. Especially, perhaps, those still very young students and greener clinicians, themselves implicitly bursting with good mental health, themselves (undeniably, I think) free of any inherent morbid attrait to beauty, who one day intend to specialize in aesthetic pathology. (Admittedly, this is a subject I\x{2019}ve felt flinty about since I was eleven years old and watched the artist and Sick Man I\x{2019}ve loved most in this world, then still in knee pants, being examined by a reputable group of professional Freudians for <<six hours and forty-five minutes|14>>. In my not altogether reliable opinion, they stopped just short of taking a brain smear from him, and I\x{2019}ve had an idea for years that only the latish hour\x{2014}<<2 A.M.|5>>\x{2014}dissuaded them from doing exactly that. Flinty, then, I do indeed mean to sound here. Churlish, no. I can perceive, though, that it\x{2019}s a very thin line, or plank, but I\x{2019}d like to try to walk it for a minute more; ready or not, I\x{2019}ve waited a good many years to collect these sentiments and get them off.) A great variety of rumors, of course, run high and wide about the extraordinarily, the sensationally creative artist\x{2014}and I\x{2019}m alluding exclusively, here, to painters and poets and full Dichter. One of these rumors\x{2014}and by far, to me, the most exhilarating of the lot\x{2014}is that he has never, even in the pre-psychoanalytical dark ages, deeply venerated his professional critics, and has, in fact, usually lumped them, in his generally unsound views of society, with the echt publishers and art dealers and the other, perhaps enviably prosperous camp followers of the arts, who, he\x{2019}s just scarcely said to concede, would prefer different, possibly cleaner work if they could get it. But what, at least in modern times, I think one most recurrently hears about the curiously-productive-though-ailing poet or painter is that he is invariably a kind of super-size but unmistakably \x{201c}classical\x{201d} neurotic, an aberrant who only occasionally, and never deeply, wishes to surrender his aberration; or, in English, a Sick Man who not at all seldom, though he\x{2019}s reported to childishly deny it, gives out terrible cries of pain, as if he would wholeheartedly let go both his art and his soul to experience what passes in other people for wellness, and yet (the rumor continues) when his unsalutary-looking little room is broken into and someone\x{2014}not infrequently, at that, someone who actually loves him\x{2014}passionately asks him where the pain is, he either declines or seems unable to discuss it at any constructive clinical length, and in the morning, when even great poets and painters presumably feel a bit more chipper than usual, he looks more perversely determined than ever to see his sickness run its course, as though by the light of another, presumably working day he had remembered that all men, the healthy ones included, eventually die, and usually with a certain amount of bad grace, but that he, lucky man, is at least being done in by the most stimulating companion, disease or no, he has ever known. On the whole, treacherous as it may sound, coming from me, with just such a dead artist in the immediate family as I\x{2019}ve been alluding to throughout this near-polemic, I don\x{2019}t see how one can rationally deduce that this last general rumor (and mouthful) isn\x{2019}t based on a fairish amount of substantial fact. While my distinguished relative lived, I watched him\x{2014}almost literally, I sometimes think\x{2014}like a hawk. By every logical definition, he was an unhealthy specimen, he did on his worst nights and late afternoons give out not only cries of pain but cries for help, and when nominal help arrived, he did decline to say in perfectly intelligible language where it hurt. Even so, I do openly cavil with the declared experts in these matters\x{2014}the scholars, the biographers, and especially the current ruling intellectual aristocracy educated in one or another of the big public psychoanalytical schools\x{2014}and I cavil with them most acrimoniously over this: they don\x{2019}t listen properly to cries of pain when they come. They can\x{2019}t, of course. They\x{2019}re a peerage of tin ears. With such faulty equipment, with those ears, how can anyone possibly trace the pain, by sound and quality alone, back to its source? With such wretched hearing equipment, the best, I think, that can be detected, and perhaps verified, is a few stray, thin overtones\x{2014}hardly even counterpoint\x{2014}coming from a troubled childhood or a disordered libido. But where does by far the bulk, the whole ambulance load, of pain really come from? Where must it come from? Isn\x{2019}t the true poet or painter a seer? Isn\x{2019}t he, actually, the only seer we have on earth? Most apparently not the scientist, most emphatically not the psychiatrist. (Surely the one and only great poet the psychoanalysts have had was Freud himself; he had a little ear trouble of his own, no doubt, but who in his right mind could deny that an epic poet was at work?) Forgive me; I\x{2019}m nearly finished with this. In a seer, what part of the human anatomy would necessarily be required to take the most abuse? The eyes, certainly. Please, dear general reader, as a last indulgence (if you\x{2019}re still here), re-read those two short passages from Kafka and Kierkegaard I started out with. Isn\x{2019}t it clear? Don\x{2019}t those cries come straight from the eyes? However contradictory the coroner\x{2019}s report\x{2014}whether he pronounces Consumption or Loneliness or Suicide to be the cause of death\x{2014}isn\x{2019}t it plain how the true artist-seer actually dies? I say (and everything that follows in these pages all too possibly stands or falls on my being at least nearly right)\x{2014}I say that the true artist-seer, the heavenly fool who can and does produce beauty, is mainly dazzled to death by his own scruples, the blinding shapes and colors of his own sacred human conscience.",

            "First, there is the matter of family pressure. It\x{2019}s doubtless a very common thing, if not much more common than I\x{2019}d care to hear about, but I have four living, lettered, rather incontinently articulate younger brothers and sisters, of part Jewish, part-Irish, and conceivably part-Minotaur extraction\x{2014}two boys, one, Waker, an ex-roving Carthusian monk-reporter, now impounded, and the other, Zooey, a no less vigorously called and chosen nonsectarian actor, aged, respectively, thirty-six and twenty-nine; and two girls, one a budding young actress, Franny, and the other, Boo Boo, a bouncy, solvent Westchester matron, aged, respectively, twenty-five and thirty-eight. Off and on since 1949, from seminary and boarding school, from the obstetrical floor of Woman\x{2019}s Hospital and the exchange-students\x{2019} writing room below the waterline on the Queen Elizabeth, between, as it were, exams and dress rehearsals and <<matins|13>> and <<two-o\x{2019}clock|6>> feedings, all four of these dignitaries have been laying down, through the mail, a series of unspecified but discernibly black ultimatums of what will happen to me unless I do something, soon, about Seymour\x{2019}s Poems. It should be noted, perhaps immediately, that besides being a writing man, I\x{2019}m a part-time English Department member at a girls\x{2019} college in upper New York, not far from the Canadian border. I live alone (but catless, I\x{2019}d like everybody to know) in a totally modest, not to say cringing, little house, set deep in the woods and on the more inaccessible side of a mountain. Not counting students, faculty, and middle-aged waitresses, I see very few people during the working week, or year. I belong, in short, to a species of literary shut-in that, I don\x{2019}t doubt, can be coerced or bullied pretty successfully by mail. Everybody, anyhow, has a saturation point, and I can no longer open my post-office box without excessive trepidation at the prospect of finding, nestled among the farm-equipment circulars and the bank statements, a long, chatty, threatening postcard from one of my brothers or sisters, two of whom, it seems peculiarly worth adding, use ball-point pens. My second main reason for deciding to let go of the poems, get them published, is, in a way, much less emotional, really, than physical. (And it leads, I\x{2019}m proud as a peacock to say, straight to the swamps of rhetoric.) The effects of radioactive particles on the human body, so topical in 1959, are nothing new to old poetry-lovers. Used with moderation, a first-class verse is an excellent and usually fast-working form of heat therapy. Once, in the Army, when I had what might be termed ambulatory pleurisy for something over three months, my first real relief carne only when I had placed a perfectly innocent-looking Blake lyric in my shirt pocket and worn it like a poultice for a day or so. Extremes, though, are always risky and ordinarily downright baneful, and the dangers of prolonged contact with any poetry that seems to exceed what we most familiarly know of the first-class are formidable. In any case, I\x{2019}d be relieved to see my brother\x{2019}s poems moved out of this general small area, at least for a while. I feel mildly but extensively burned. And on what seems to me the soundest basis: During much of his adolescence, and all his adult life, Seymour was drawn, first, to Chinese poetry, and then, as deeply, to Japanese poetry, and to both in ways that he was drawn to no other poetry in the world. I have no quick way of knowing, of course, how familiar or unfamiliar my dear, if victimized, general reader is with Chinese or Japanese poetry. Considering, however, that even a short discussion of it may possibly shed a good deal of light on my brother\x{2019}s nature, I don\x{2019}t think this is the time for me to go all reticent and forbearing. At their most effective, I believe, Chinese and Japanese classical verses are intelligible utterances that please or enlighten or enlarge the invited eavesdropper to within an inch of his life. They may be, and often are, fine for the ear particularly, but for the most part I\x{2019}d say that unless a Chinese or Japanese poet\x{2019}s real forte is knowing a good persimmon or a good crab or a good mosquito bite on a good arm when he sees one, then no matter how long or unusual or fascinating his semantic or intellectual intestines may be, or how beguiling they sound when twanged, no one in the Mysterious East speaks seriously of him as a poet, if at all. My inner, incessant elation, which I think I\x{2019}ve rightly, if repeatedly, called happiness, is threatening, I\x{2019}m aware, to turn this whole composition into a fool\x{2019}s soliloquy. I think, though, that even I haven\x{2019}t the gall to try to say what makes the Chinese or Japanese poet the marvel and the joy he is. Something, however (wouldn\x{2019}t you know?), does happen to come to mind. (I don\x{2019}t imagine it\x{2019}s precisely the thing I\x{2019}m looking for, but I can\x{2019}t simply throw it out.) Once, a terrible number of years ago, when Seymour and I were eight and six, our parents gave a party for nearly sixty people in our three and a half rooms at the old Hotel Alamac, in New York. They were officially retiring from vaudeville, and it was an affecting as well as a celebrative occasion. We two were allowed to get out of bed around eleven or so, and come in and have a look. We had more than a look. By request, and with no objections whatever on our part, we danced, we sang, first singly, then together, as children of our station often do. But mostly we just stayed up and watched. <<Toward two in the morning|9h>>, when the leavetakings began, Seymour begged Bessie\x{2014}our mother\x{2014}to let him bring the leavers their coats, which were hung, draped, tossed, piled all over the small apartment, even on the foot of our sleeping younger sister\x{2019}s bed. He and I knew about a dozen of the guests intimately, ten or so more by sight or reputation, and the rest not at all or hardly. We had been in bed, I should add, when everyone arrived. But from watching the guests for some three hours, from grinning at them, from, I think, loving them, Seymour\x{2014}without asking any questions first\x{2014}brought very nearly all the guests, one or two at a time, and without any mistakes, their own true coats, and all the men involved their hats. (The women\x{2019}s hats he had some trouble with.) Now, I don\x{2019}t necessarily suggest that this kind of feat is typical of the Chinese or Japanese poet, and certainly I don\x{2019}t mean to imply that it makes him what he is. But I do think, that if a Chinese or Japanese verse composer doesn\x{2019}t know whose coat is whose, on sight, his poetry stands a remarkably slim chance of ever ripening. And eight, I\x{2019}d guess, is very nearly the outside age limit for mastering this small feat.",

            "(How can I record what I\x{2019}ve just recorded and still be happy? But I am. Unjolly, unmerry, to the marrow, but my afflatus seems to be punctureproof. Recollective of only one other person I\x{2019}ve known in my life.) You can\x{2019}t imagine what big, hand-rubbing plans I had for this immediate space. They appear to have been designed, though, to look exquisite on the bottom of my wastebasket. I\x{2019}d intended right here to relieve those last two <<midnight|13>> paragraphs with a couple of sunshiny witticisms, a matched pair of the sort of thigh-slappers that so often, I imagine, turn my fellow-raconteurs green with envy or nausea. It was my intention, right here, to tell the reader that when, or if, young people should stop by to see me about Seymour\x{2019}s life or death, a curious personal affliction of my own, alas, would make such an audience utterly unfeasible. I planned to mention\x{2014}just in passing, because this will be developed at, I hope, interminable length someday\x{2014}that Seymour and I, as children, together spent close to seven years answering questions on a network-radio quiz program, and that ever since we formally went off the air, I\x{2019}ve felt pretty much about people who as little as ask me the time of day almost precisely the way Betsey Trotwood felt about donkeys. Next, I intended to divulge that after some twelve years as a college instructor I\x{2019}m now, in 1959, subject to frequent attacks of what my faculty colleagues have been flattering enough to think of, I believe, as Glass\x{2019}s disease\x{2014}in lay language, a pathological spasm of the lumbar and lower ventral regions that causes an off-duty classroom lecturer to double up and hurriedly cross streets or crawl under large pieces of furniture when he sees anyone under forty approaching. Neither of the two sallies will work for me here, though. There\x{2019}s a certain amount of perverse truth to both, but not nearly enough. For the terrible and undiscountable fact has just reached me, between paragraphs, that I yearn to talk, to be queried, to be interrogated, about this particular dead man. It\x{2019}s just got through to me, that apart from my many other\x{2014}and, I hope to God, less ignoble\x{2014}motives, I\x{2019}m stuck with the usual survivor\x{2019}s conceit that he\x{2019}s the only soul alive who knew the deceased intimately. O let them come\x{2014}the callow and the enthusiastic, the academic, the curious, the long and the short and the all-knowing! Let them arrive in busloads, let them parachute in, wearing Leicas.

            "Considering that this matter may not come up in any desirable, or massive, detail later on, I think the reader should know right now, and preferably bear in mind to the very end, that all the children in our family were, are, descended from an astonishingly long and motley double-file of professional entertainers. For the most part, genetically speaking, or muttering, we sing, dance, and (can you doubt it?) tell Funny Jokes. But I think it peculiarly important to keep in mind\x{2014}and so did Seymour, even as a child\x{2014}that there is also among us a wide miscellany of performing circus people and performing, so to say, circus-fringe people. One of my great-grandfathers (and Seymour\x{2019}s), for an admittedly juicy example, was a quite famous Polish-Jewish carnival clown named Zozo, who had a penchant\x{2014}up to the very end, one necessarily gathers\x{2014}for diving from immense heights into small containers of water. Another of Seymour\x{2019}s and my great-grandfathers, an Irishman MacMahon (whom my mother, to her everlasting credit, has never been tempted to refer to as a \x{201c}darlin\x{2019} man\x{201d}), was a self-employed type who used to set out a couple of octaves of empty whiskey bottles in a meadow and then, when a paying crowd had closed in, dance, we\x{2019}re told, rather musically on the sides of the bottles. (So, surely you\x{2019}ll take my word, we have, among other things, a few nuts on the family tree.) Our parents themselves, Les and Bessie Glass, had a fairly conventional but (we believe) remarkably good song-and-dance-and-patter act in vaudeville and music halls, reaching perhaps most nearly top billing in Australia (where Seymour and I spent about two years, in total bookings, of our very early childhood) but later, too, achieving much more than just passing notability on the old Pantages and Orpheum circuits, here in America. In the opinion of not a few people, they might have gone on as a vaudeville team for quite a bit longer than they did. Bessie had ideas of her own, though. Not only has she always had something of an aptitude for reading handwriting on walls\x{2014}two-a-day vaudeville already in 1925 was almost finished, and Bessie had, both as a mother and as a dancer, the very strongest convictions against doing four-a-day shows for the big, new, ever-multiplying movie-cum-vaudeville palaces\x{2014}but, more important than that, ever since she was a child in Dublin and her twin sister succumbed, backstage, of galloping undernutrition, Security, in any form, has had a fatal attraction for Bessie. At any rate, in the spring of 1925, at the end of a so-so run at the Albee, in Brooklyn, with five children bedded down with German measles in three and a half unstately rooms at the old Hotel Alamac, in Manhattan, and a notion that she was pregnant again (mistaken, it turned out; the babies of the family, Zooey and Franny, were not born till <<1930|9c:0>> and 1935, respectively), Bessie suddenly appealed to an honest-to-God \x{201c}influential\x{201d} admirer, and my father took a job in what he invariably referred to, for years and years, with no real fear of being contradicted around the house, as the ministrative end of commercial radio, and Gallagher & Glass\x{2019}s extended tour was officially over. What I\x{2019}m mainly trying to do here, though, is to find the firmest way of suggesting that this curious footlight-and-three-ring heritage has been an almost ubiquitous and entirely significant reality in the lives of all seven of the children in our family. The two youngest, as I\x{2019}ve already mentioned, are, in fact, professional actors. But no heavy line can be drawn quite there. The elder of my two sisters, to most outward appearances, is a fully landed suburbanite, mother of three children, co-owner of a two-car, filled garage, but at all supremely joyful moments she will, all but literally, dance for her life; I\x{2019}ve seen her, to my horror, break into a very passable soft shoe routine (a sort of Ned Wayburn out of Pat and Marion Rooney) with a five-day-old niece of mine in her arms. My late younger brother Walt, who was killed in a postwar accident in Japan (and of whom I plan to say as little as possible in this series of sittings, if I\x{2019}m to get through them), was a dancer, too, in a perhaps less spontaneous but far more professional sense than my sister Boo Boo. His twin\x{2014}our brother Waker, our monk, our impounded Carthusian\x{2014}as a boy, privately canonized W. C. Fields and in that inspired and obstreperous but rather holy man\x{2019}s image used to practice juggling with cigar boxes, among a great many other things, by the hour, till he became spectacularly proficient at it. (Family rumor has it that he was originally cloistered off\x{2014}that is relieved of his duties as a secular priest in Astoria\x{2014}to free him of a persistent temptation to administer the sacramental wafer to his parishioners\x{2019} lips by standing back two or three feet and trajecting it in a lovely arc over his left shoulder.) As for myself\x{2014}I\x{2019}d prefer to take Seymour last\x{2014}I\x{2019}m quite sure it goes without saying that I dance a little bit, too. On request, of course. Apart from that, I might mention that I often feel I\x{2019}m watched over, if somewhat erratically, by Great-Grandfather Zozo; I feel he mysteriously provides that I don\x{2019}t trip over my invisible baggy clown-pants when I stroll in the woods or walk into classrooms, and perhaps also sees to it that my putty nose occasionally points east when I sit down at the typewriter.",

And I\x{2019}m ecstatically happy at this moment, I\x{2019}m happy to say. Which is not to deny (and I\x{2019}ve come now, I\x{2019}m afraid, to the real reason I\x{2019}ve constructed this showcase for my poor old liver)\x{2014}which is not to deny, I repeat, that my ailment left me with a single, terrible deficiency.

It was most exceedingly pullable-looking hair, and pulled it surely got; the babies in the family always automatically reached for it, even before the nose, which, God wot, was also Outstanding.

Often, at children\x{2019}s parties, someone\x{2019}s rather showily broad-minded mother would suggest a game of Spin the Bottle or Post Office, and I can freely attest that throughout childhood the two eldest Glass boys were veteran recipients of bag after bag of unmailed letters (illogically but satisfactorily put, I think), unless, of course, the Postman was a little girl called Charlotte the Harlot, who was a trifle mad anyway. Did this bother us? Did it cause pain? Think carefully, now, writer. My very slow, very considered answer: Almost never. In my own case, for three reasons that I can easily think of. First, except for one or two shaky intervals, I believed straight through my childhood\x{2014}thanks largely to Seymour\x{2019}s insistence, but by no means entirely\x{2014}that I was an egregiously charming, able fellow, and it was at once a marked and a curiously unimportant reflection on anyone\x{2019}s taste if he thought otherwise. Second (if you can stand this one, and I don\x{2019}t see how you can), I had a rosy, full conviction before I was five that I was going to be a superlative writer when I grew up. And, third, with very few deviations, and none whatever within the heart, I was always secretly pleased and proud to bear any physical resemblance to Seymour. With Seymour himself, the case, as usual, was different. He cared alternately much and not at all about his funny-lookingness. When he cared much, he cared for the sake of other people, and I find myself thinking especially, at this moment, of our sister Boo Boo. Seymour was wild about her. Which isn\x{2019}t saying a great deal, since he was wild about everybody in the family and most people outside it. But, like all young girls I\x{2019}ve ever known, Boo Boo went through a stage\x{2014}admirably short, in her case, I must say\x{2014}when she \x{201c}died\x{201d} at least twice daily of the gaffes, the faux pas, of adults in general. At the height of this period, a favorite history teacher who came into class after lunch with a dot of charlotte russe on her cheek was quite sufficient cause for Boo Boo to wither and die at her desk. Quite frequently, however, she came home dead from somewhat less trivial causes, and these were the times that bothered and worried Seymour. He worried rather particularly, for her sake, about adults who came over to us (him and me) at parties or such to tell us how handsome we were looking tonight. If not that precisely, that sort of thing happened not seldom, and Boo Boo always seemed to be within earshot when it did, positively waiting to die.",

            "Let\x{2019}s go. As older boys, both S. and I were terrible dressers, each in his own way. It\x{2019}s a little odd (not really very) that we were such awful dressers, because as small boys we were quite satisfactorily and unremarkably turned out, I think. In the early part of our career as hired radio performers, Bessie used to take us down to De Pinna\x{2019}s, on Fifth Avenue, for our clothes. How she discovered that sedate and worthy establishment in the first place is almost anybody\x{2019}s guess. My brother Walt, who was a very elegant young man while he lived, used to feel that Bessie had simply gone up and asked a policeman. A not unreasonable conjecture, since our Bessie, when we were children, habitually took her knottiest problems to the nearest thing we had in New York to a Druidic oracle\x{2014}the Irish traffic cop. In a way, I can suppose the reputed luck of the Irish did have something to do with Bessie\x{2019}s discovery of De Pinna\x{2019}s. But surely not everything, by a long shot. For instance (this is extraneous, but nice), my mother has never in any known latitude of the expression been a book-reader. Yet I\x{2019}ve seen her go into one of the gaudy book palaces on Fifth Avenue to buy one of my nephews a birthday present and come out, emerge, with the Kay Nielsen-illustrated edition of \x{201c}East of the Sun and West of the Moon,\x{201d} and if you knew her, you\x{2019}d be certain that she\x{2019}d been Ladylike but aloof to cruising helpful salesmen. But let\x{2019}s go back to the way we looked as Youths. We started to buy our own clothes, independent of Bessie and of each other, when we were in our earliest teens. Being the older, Seymour was the first to branch out, as it were, but I made up for lost time when my chance came. I remember dropping Fifth Avenue like a cold potato when I had just turned fourteen, and making straight for Broadway\x{2014}specifically, to a shop in the Fifties where the sales force, I thought, were more than faintly hostile but at least knew a born snappy dresser when they saw one coming. In the last year S. and I were on the air together\x{2014}1933\x{2014}I showed up every broadcast night wearing a pale-gray double-breasted suit with heavily wadded shoulders, a <<midnight|13>>-blue shirt with a Hollywood \x{201c}roll\x{201d} collar, and the cleaner of two identical crocus-yellow cotton neckties I kept for formal occasions in general. I\x{2019}ve never felt as good in anything since, frankly. (I don\x{2019}t suppose a writing man ever really gets rid of his old crocus-yellow neckties. Sooner or later, I think, they show up in his prose, and there isn\x{2019}t a hell of a lot he can do about it.) Seymour, on the other hand, picked out marvellously orderly clothes for himself. The main hitch there was that nothing he bought\x{2014}suits, overcoats particularly\x{2014}ever fitted him properly. He must have bolted, possibly half dressed, and certainly unchalked, whenever anyone from the alteration department approached him. His jackets all hiked either up or down on him. His sleeves usually either extended to the middle joints of his thumbs or stopped at the wrist-bones. The seats of his trousers were always close to the worst. They were sometimes rather awe-inspiring, as if a 36-Regular behind had been dropped like a pea in a basket into a 42-Long pair of trousers. But there are other and more formidable aspects to be considered here. Once an article of clothing was actually on his body, he lost all earthly consciousness of it\x{2014}barring, perhaps, a certain vague technical awareness that he was no longer stark naked. And this wasn\x{2019}t simply a sign of an instinctive, or even a well-educated, antipathy to being what was known in our circles as a Good Dresser. I did go along with him once or twice when he was Buying, and I think, looking back, that he bought his clothes with a mild but, to me, gratifying degree of pride\x{2014}like a young brahmacharya, or Hindu-religious novice, picking out his first loincloth. Oh, it was a very odd business. Something always went wrong, too, with Seymour\x{2019}s clothes at the exact instant he was actually putting them on. He could stand for a good, normal three or four minutes in front of an open closet door surveying his side of our necktie rack, but you knew (if you were damned fool enough to sit around watching him) that once he\x{2019}d actually made his selection the tie was doomed. Either its knot-to-be was fated to balk at fitting snugly into the V of his shirt collar\x{2014}it most often came to rest about a quarter of an inch short of the throat button\x{2014}or if the potential knot was to be slid safely into its proper place, then a little band of foulard was definitely fated to stick out from under the collar fold at the back of his neck, looking rather like a tourist\x{2019}s binoculars strap. But I\x{2019}d prefer to leave this large and difficult subject. His clothes, in short, often wore the whole family to something akin to despair. I\x{2019}ve given only a very passing description, really. The thing came in any number of variations. I might just add, and then drop it quickly, that it can be a deeply disturbing experience to be standing, say, beside one of the potted palms at the Biltmore, at cocktail rush hour, on a summer day, and have your liege lord come bounding up the public stairs obviously pleased as punch to see you but not entirely battened down, fastened.",

            "I\x{2019}d love to pursue this stairs-bounding business for a minute\x{2014}that is, pursue it blind, without giving a great damn where it lands me. He bounded up all flights of stairs. He rushed them. I rarely saw him take a flight of stairs any other way. Which delivers me up\x{2014}penitently, I\x{2019}m going to assume\x{2014}to the subject of vim, vigor, and vitality. I can\x{2019}t imagine anyone, these days (I can\x{2019}t easily imagine anyone these days)\x{2014}with the possible exception of unusually insecure longshoremen, a few retired general officers of the Army and Navy, and a great many small boys who worry about the size of their biceps\x{2014}taking much stock in the old popular aspersions of Unrobustness laid to poets. Nonetheless, I\x{2019}m prepared to suggest (particularly since so many military and outdoorsy thoroughgoing he-men number me among their favorite yarn spinners) that a very considerable amount of sheer physical stamina, and not merely nervous energy or a cast-iron ego, is required to get through the final draft of a first-class poem. Only too often, sadly, a good poet turns into a damned poor keeper of his body, but I believe he is usually issued a highly serviceable one to start out with. My brother was the most nearly tireless person I\x{2019}ve known. (I\x{2019}m suddenly time-conscious. It\x{2019}s not yet <<midnight|13>>, and I\x{2019}m playing with the idea of sliding to the floor and writing this from a supine position.) It\x{2019}s just struck me that I never saw Seymour yawn. He must have, of course, but I never saw him. Surely not for any reasons of etiquette, either; yawns weren\x{2019}t fastidiously suppressed at home. I yawned regularly, I know\x{2014}and I got more sleep than he did. Emphatically, though, we were both short sleepers, even as small boys. During, especially, our middle years on radio\x{2014}the years, that is, when we each carried at least three library cards around with us in our hip pockets, like manhandled old passports\x{2014}there were very few nights, school nights, when our bedroom lights went out before two or <<three in the morning|5>>, except during the crucial little post-Taps interval when First Sergeant Bessie was making her general rounds. When Seymour was hot on something, investigating something, he could and frequently did, from the age of about twelve, go two and three nights in a row without going to bed at all, and without distinctly looking or sounding the worse for it. Much loss of sleep apparently affected just his circulation; his hands and feet got cold. Along about the third wakeful night in a row, he\x{2019}d look up at least once from whatever he was doing and ask me if I felt a terrible draft. (No one in our family, not even Seymour, felt drafts. Only terrible drafts.) Or he\x{2019}d get up from the chair or the floor\x{2014}wherever he was reading or writing or contemplating\x{2014}and check to see if someone had left the bathroom window open. Besides me, Bessie was the only one in the apartment who could tell when Seymour was ignoring sleep. She judged by how many pairs of socks he was wearing. In the years after he\x{2019}d graduated from knickers to long trousers, Bessie was forever lifting up the cuffs of his trousers to see if he was wearing two pairs of draftproof socks.",

            "It\x{2019}s a <<quarter to one in the morning|10>>, and I\x{2019}ve been sitting here since ten, trying, while the physical Seymour is on the page, to find a way to introduce him as Athlete and Gamesman without excessively irritating anybody who hates sports and games. I\x{2019}m dismayed and disgusted, really, to find I can\x{2019}t get into it unless I start with an apology. For one reason, I happen to belong to an English Department of which at least two members are well on their way to becoming established repertory modern poets and a third member is a literature critic of enormous chic here on the academic Eastern Seaboard, a rather towering figure among Melville specialists. All three of these men (they have great soft spots for me, too, as you might imagine) make what I tend to regard as a somewhat too public rush at the height of the professional-baseball season for a television set and a bottle of cold beer. Unfortunately, this small, ivy-covered stone is a little less devastating for the circumstance that I throw it from a solid-glass house. I\x{2019}ve been a baseball fan myself all my life, and I don\x{2019}t doubt that there\x{2019}s an area inside my skull that must look like a bird-cage bottom of old shredded Sports Sections. In fact (and I consider this the last word in intimate writer-reader relations), probably one of the reasons I stayed on the air for well over six consecutive years as a child was that I could tell the Folks in Radioland what the Waner boys had been up to all week or, still more impressive, how many times Cobb had stolen third in 1921, when I was two. Am I still a trifle touchy about it? Have I still not made my peace with the afternoons of youth when I fled Reality, via the Third Avenue \x{201c}L,\x{201d} to get to my little womb off third base at the Polo Grounds? I can\x{2019}t believe it. Maybe it\x{2019}s partly because I\x{2019}m forty and I think it\x{2019}s high time all the elderly boy writers were asked to move along from the ballparks and the bull rings. No. I know\x{2014}my God, I know\x{2014}why I\x{2019}m so hesitant to present the Aesthete as Athlete. I haven\x{2019}t thought of this in years and years, but this is the answer: There used to be an exceptionally intelligent and likeable boy on the radio with S. and me\x{2014}one Curtis Caulfield, who was eventually killed during one of the landings in the Pacific. He trotted off with Seymour and me to Central park one afternoon, where I discovered he threw a ball as if he had two left hands\x{2014}like most girls, in short\x{2014}and I can still see the look on Seymour\x{2019}s face at the sound of my critical horse-laugh, stallion-laugh. (How can I explain away this deep-type analysis? Have I gone over to the Other Side? Should I hang out my shingle?)",

            "It\x{2019}s an Anecdote, sink me, but I\x{2019}ll let it rip: At <<about nine|9c:1>>, I had the very pleasant notion that I was the Fastest Boy Runner in the World. It\x{2019}s the kind of queer, basically extracurricular conceit, I\x{2019}m inclined to add, that dies hard, and even today, at a super-sedentary forty, I can picture myself, in street clothes, whisking past a series of distinguished but hard-breathing Olympic milers and waving to them, amiably, without a trace of condescension. Anyway, one beautiful spring evening when we were still living over on Riverside Drive, Bessie sent me to the drugstore for a couple of quarts of ice cream. I came out of the building at that very same magical quarter hour described just a few paragraphs back. Equally fatal to the construction of this anecdote, I had sneakers on\x{2014}sneakers surely being to anyone who happens to be the Fastest Boy Runner in the World almost exactly what red shoes were to Hans Christian Andersen\x{2019}s little girl. Once I was clear of the building, I was Mercury himself, and broke into a \x{201c}terrific\x{201d} sprint up the long block to Broadway. I took the corner at Broadway on one wheel and kept going, doing the impossible: increasing speed. The drugstore that sold Louis Sherry ice cream, which was Bessie\x{2019}s adamant choice, was three blocks north, at 113th. About halfway there, I tore past the stationery store where we usually bought our newspapers and magazines, but blindly, without noticing any acquaintances or relatives in the vicinity. Then, about a block further on, I picked up the sound of pursuit at my rear, plainly conducted on foot. My first, perhaps typically New Yorkese thought was that the cops were after me\x{2014}the charge, conceivably, Breaking Speed Records on a Non-School-Zone Street. I strained to get a little more speed out of my body, but it was no use. I felt a hand clutch out at me and grab hold of my sweater just where the winning-team numerals should have been, and, good and scared, I broke my speed with the awkwardness of a gooney bird coming to a stop. My pursuer was, of course, Seymour, and he was looking pretty damned scared himself. \x{201c}What\x{2019}s the matter? What happened?\x{201d} he asked me frantically. He was still holding on to my sweater. I yanked myself loose from his hand and informed him, in the rather scatological idiom of the neighborhood, which I won\x{2019}t record here verbatim, that nothing had happened, nothing was the matter, that I was just running, for cryin\x{2019} out loud. His relief was prodigious. \x{201c}Boy, did you scare me!\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Wow, were you moving! I could hardly catch up with you!\x{201d} We then went along, at a walk, to the drugstore together. Perhaps strangely, perhaps not strangely at all, the morale of the now Second-Fastest Boy Runner in the World had not been very perceptibly lowered. For one thing, I had been outrun by him. Besides, I was extremely busy noticing that he was panting a lot. It was oddly diverting to see him pant.",

How many stories have I torn up since I was a boy simply because they had what that old Chekhov-baiting noise Somerset Maugham calls a Beginning, a Middle, and an End? Thirty-five? Fifty? One of the thousand reasons I quit going to the theater when I was about twenty was that I resented like hell filing out of the theater just because some playwright was forever slamming down his silly curtain. (What ever became of that stalwart bore Fortinbras? Who eventually fixed his wagon?) Nonetheless, I\x{2019}m done here.

This is too grand to be said (so I\x{2019}m just the man to say it), but I can\x{2019}t be my brother\x{2019}s brother for nothing, and I know\x{2014}not always, but I know\x{2014}there is no single thing I do that is more important than going into that awful Room 307. There isn\x{2019}t one girl in there, including the Terrible Miss Zabel, who is not as much my sister as Boo Boo or Franny. They may shine with the misinformation of the ages, but they shine.
