            "On the afternoon that Miss Chestnut arrived for her visit, I was in my bedroom, rocking. Unlike the obsessive counting and touching, rocking was not a mandatory duty but a voluntary and highly pleasurable exercise. It was my hobby, and there was nothing else I would rather do. The point was not to rock oneself to sleep: This was not a step toward some greater goal. It was the goal itself. The perpetual movement freed my mind, allowing me to mull things over and construct elaborately detailed fantasies. Toss in a radio, and I was content to rock until three or <<four o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>, listening to the hit parade and discovering that each and every song was about me. I might have to listen two or three hundred times to the same song, but sooner or later its private message would reveal itself. Because it was pleasant and relaxing, my rocking was bound to be tripped up, most often by my brain, which refused to allow me more than ten consecutive minutes of happiness. At the opening chords of my current favorite song, a voice would whisper, Shouldn\x{2019}t you be upstairs making sure there are really one hundred and fourteen peppercorns left in that small ceramic jar? And, hey, while you\x{2019}re up there, you might want to check the iron and make sure it\x{2019}s not setting fire to the baby\x{2019}s bedroom. The list of demands would grow by the moment. What about that television antenna? Is it still set into that perfect V, or has one of your sisters destroyed its integrity. You know, I was just wondering how tightly the lid is screwed onto that mayonnaise jar. Let\x{2019}s have a look, shall we?",

            "I awoke this morning to a fog so thick, I couldn\x{2019}t see the picnic table in my front yard. From the sky to the ground, everything was the exact same shade of gray. It wasn\x{2019}t until early evening that the weather finally cleared. At <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> I looked out my window to see a naked couple strutting across the grounds with a pair of tennis rackets in their hands. The man wore his hair long in the back and carried himself as though he were dressed in a fine suit, his stride confident and purposeful, while the woman trotted along behind him wearing a sun visor, kneesocks, and sneakers. These were the first active, out-of-door nudists I had seen, and I threw on my clothes and followed them to the pavilion, where I pulled a book from my pocket and pretended to read. The man had an ample stomach and a broad, dimpled ass that jiggled and swayed as he leaped about the court, attempting to return his partner\x{2019}s serves. They played for no more than five minutes before he placed his hands on his knees, released a mouthful of bile onto the grass, and called it quits. They left the court and I followed them into the clubhouse, where the man stepped into the bathroom, returning ten minutes later with a bright red ring around his ass. Here, I thought, was a real nudist. There was a tuft of toilet paper, just slight, clinging to his bottom, and when the woman pointed it out to him, he ran his hand along his crack and casually shrugged, as though it were no more significant than a dab of mayonnaise on his lip.",

He was someone who had come in just for the day and seemed determined to get his twenty dollars\x{2019} worth. Beside him sat the couple I\x{2019}d seen on the tennis court, and next to them a wiry gray-haired woman leafed through a copy of Sports Illustrated. The <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>> p\x{e9}tanque game had started, and I could hear the faint click of metal balls along with the familiar cry, \x{201c}Great shot. High five, high five.\x{201d} The young man was on his fifth rotation, and I admired his ass, which was plump and unblemished, high and firm enough to support the first-prize trophy I\x{2019}d mentally awarded him for Outstanding Physical Achievement.",

I saw then that she had shaved all her pubic hair except for a brief, Hitler-style mustache.

Is it done to expedite the search for ticks, or are these men and women shaving away the gray in the hope that they might appear younger?",
