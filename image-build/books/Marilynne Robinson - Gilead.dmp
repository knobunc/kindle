            "In those days, as I have said, I might spend most of a night reading. Then, if I woke up still in my armchair, and if the clock said <<four|11>> or <<five|20a>>, I\x{2019}d think how pleasant it was to walk through the streets in the dark and let myself into the church and watch dawn come in the sanctuary. I loved the sound of the latch lifting. The building has settled into itself so that when you walk down the aisle, you can hear it yielding to the burden of your weight. It\x{2019}s a pleasanter sound than an echo would be, an obliging, accommodating sound. You have to be there alone to hear it. Maybe it can\x{2019}t feel the weight of a child. But if it is still standing when you read this, and if you are not half a world away, sometime you might go there alone, just to see what I mean. After a while I did begin to wonder if I liked the church better with no people in it.",

            "People are always up in the night, with their colicky babies and their sick children, or fighting or worrying or full of guilt. And, of course, the milkmen and all the people on early shifts and late shifts. Sometimes when I walked past the house of one of my own families and saw lights on, I\x{2019}d think maybe I should stop and see if there was a problem I could help with, but then I\x{2019}d decide it might be an intrusion and I\x{2019}d go on. Past the Boughtons\x{2019} house, too. It was years before I really knew what was troubling them, close as we had always been. It was on the nights I didn\x{2019}t sleep at all and I didn\x{2019}t feel like reading that I\x{2019}d walk through town at <<one|90>> or <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>>. In the old days I could walk down every single street, past every house, in about an hour. I\x{2019}d try to remember the people who lived in each one, and whatever I knew about them, which was often quite a lot, since many of the ones who weren\x{2019}t mine were Boughton\x{2019}s. And I\x{2019}d pray for them. And I\x{2019}d imagine peace they didn\x{2019}t expect and couldn\x{2019}t account for descending on their illness or their quarreling or their dreams. Then I\x{2019}d go into the church and pray some more and wait for daylight. I\x{2019}ve often been sorry to see a night end, even while I have loved seeing the dawn come.",

            "The neighbor women dosed his mother with tea of red clover blossoms, which probably didn\x{2019}t do her any harm, my father said. They also cut off her hair, because they thought it was draining away her strength. She cried when they showed it to her, and she said it was the one thing in her life she was ever proud of. My father said she was weary with the pain and she wasn\x{2019}t herself, but those words lingered with him, and with his sisters, too. In those days, and even when I was a child, women kept their hair long because they felt the Bible said they should (I Corinthians <<11:15|2>>). But it would be cut off if they were sickly, and that was always a sad thing, a kind of shame for them, along with everything else they had to go through. So it hit her very hard. When my father spoke to his father about how low her spirits were, his father said, \x{201c}You came back and I came back and we both have our health and the use of our limbs.\x{201d} My father took this to mean that since her grief was not in excess of the average in that region, he could not take any special time for it.",

            "The pulpit was left intact, standing there in the rain, but the pews were mostly kindling. There was a lot of praising the Lord that it happened at <<midnight|3b>> on a Tuesday. It was a warm day, a warm rain, and there was no real shelter, so everybody ignored it, more or less. All kinds of people came to help. It was like a camp meeting and a picnic. They unhitched the horses, and we younger children lay on an old quilt under the wagon out of the way and talked and played marbles, and watched the older boys and the men clamber over the ruins, searching out Bibles and hymnals. They would sing, we would all sing, \x{201c}Blessed Jesus\x{201d} and \x{201c}The Old Rugged Cross,\x{201d} and the wind would blow the rain in gusts and the spray would reach us where we were. It was cooler than the rain was. The rain falling on the wagon bed sounded the way it does in an attic eave. It never rains, but I remember that day. And when they had gathered up all the books that were ruined, they made two graves for them, and put the Bibles in one and the hymnals in the other, and then the minister whose church it was\x{2014}a Baptist, as I recall\x{2014}said a prayer over them. I was always amazed, watching grownups, at the way they seemed to know what was to be done in any situation, to know what was the decent thing.",

            "I fell asleep in my chair and woke up feeling so much better. I missed eight and a half innings, and nothing happened in the bottom of the ninth (<<4 to 2|10a:1>>, Yankees), but the reception was good and I look forward to watching the rest of the season, if God wills. Your mother was asleep, too, kneeling on the floor with her head against my knees. I had to sit very still for a long time, watching a movie about Englishmen in trench coats who were up to something morose involving Frenchmen and trains. I didn\x{2019}t really follow it. When she woke up, she was so glad to see me, as if I had been gone a long time. Then she went and fetched you and we ate our supper in the parlor\x{2014}it turns out that whoever brought the trays brought one for each of us. Since supper was three kinds of casserole with two kinds of fruit salad, with cake and pie for dessert, I gathered that my flock, who lambaste life\x{2019}s problems with food items of just this kind, had heard an alarm. There was even a bean salad, which to me looked distinctly Presbyterian, so anxiety had overspilled its denominational vessel. You\x{2019}d have thought I\x{2019}d died. We saved it for lunch.",

There was a note on it. Show Ames. But it ended up at the bottom of a stack of things, I guess, because it\x{2019}s from <<1948|9c:0>>. The article is called \x{201c}God and the American People,\x{201d} and it says 95 percent of us say we believe in God. But our religion doesn\x{2019}t meet the writer\x{2019}s standards, not at all. To his mind, all those people in all those churches are the scribes and the Pharisees. He seems to me to be a bit of a scribe himself, scorning and rebuking the way he does. How do you tell a scribe from a prophet, which is what he clearly takes himself to be? The prophets love the people they chastise, a thing this writer does not appear to me to do.",
