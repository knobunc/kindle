            "AT <<ALMOST ONE O\x{2019}CLOCK|6>> I entered the lobby of the building where I worked and turned toward the escalators, carrying a black Penguin paperback and a small white CVS bag, its receipt stapled over the top. The escalators rose toward the mezzanine, where my office was. They were the freestanding kind: a pair of integral signs swooping upward between the two floors they served without struts or piers to bear any intermediate weight. On sunny days like this one, a temporary, steeper escalator of daylight, formed by intersections of the lobby\x{2019}s towering volumes of marble and glass, met the real escalators just above their middle point, spreading into a needly area of shine where it fell against their brushed-steel side-panels, and adding long glossy highlights to each of the black rubber handrails which wavered slightly as the handrails slid on their tracks, like the radians of black luster that ride the undulating outer edge of an LP.1",

I stapled a copy of a memo someone had cc:\x{2019}d me on to a copy of an earlier memo I had written on the same subject, and wrote at the top to my manager, in my best casual scrawl, \x{201c}Abe\x{2014}should I keep hammering on these people or drop it?\x{201d} I put the stapled papers in one of my Eldon trays, not sure whether I would forward them to Abelardo or not. Then I slipped my shoe back on by flipping it on its side, hooking it with my foot, and shaking it into place. I accomplished all this by foot-feel; and when I crouched forward, over the papers on my desk, to reach the untied shoelace, I experienced a faint surge of pride in being able to tie a shoe without looking at it. At that moment, Dave, Sue, and Steve, on their way to lunch, waved as they passed by my office. Right in the middle of tying a shoe as I was, I couldn\x{2019}t wave nonchalantly back, so I called out a startled, overhearty \x{201c}Have a good one, guys!\x{201d} They disappeared; I pulled the left shoelace tight, and bingo, it broke.",

Under the impetus of a big-necked man and a rushed woman behind him, the revolving door from the lobby had been circulating a little too fast; when my turn came, I took advantage of the existing momentum by milling through my slice of its pie chart without contributing any additional force, rolling up a sleeve. Outside, it was <<noontime|13>>, <<noontime|13>>!

Sidewalk vendors poked in the ranked compartments of their carts, flipping metal doors back and forth. The rear of a truck with quilted metal sides was packed with sandwiches, spigots, Drake\x{2019}s Cakes, and cans in ice, its owner making change from the monetary calliope on his belt, filling three cups at a time without flipping on and off the coffee spigot, pointing at the next customer, all in looping, circling two-armed gestures, as I imagine master telephone operators working the old plug and -socket switchboards must have made\x{2014}he was selling to the crew that was tearing down everything but the I beams and the front fa\x{e7}ade of a building across the street.

            "There were lines at all the cash registers. I studied the technique of the cashiers and chose the smartest-looking one, an Indian or Pakistani woman in a blue sweater, even though her line was two people longer than any of the others, because I had come to the conclusion that the differential in checkout speeds between a fast, smart ringer-upper and a slow, dumb one was three transactions to one, such was the variation in human abilities and native intelligence\x{2014}even <<four to one|10a:0>> if there were sophisticated transactions like returns, or the appearance of something whose price had to be looked up in the alphabetical printout because it wasn\x{2019}t price-gunned on the package. This Indian woman was a true professional: she put the items in the bag as she rang them up, eliminating the need to handle everything twice, and she did not wait to see whether the customer had the exact change: she had learned that when the guy said, \x{201c}Wait, I think I have it!\x{201d} there was a good chance that after all his fishing and palm-counting, the combination of coins would prove to be inadequate, and he would say, \x{201c}Sorry, I don\x{2019}t,\x{201d} and hand her a twenty-dollar bill. She closed the register drawer with her hips and tore the receipt off at almost precisely the same moment, and her use of the chrome handgrip-style stapler that was chained to the counter was everything you want to see in bag stapling. Her only difficulty came when, making change for the woman in front of me (tweezers, Vaseline Intensive Care, Trident gum, nude-colored stockings, and a package of Marlboro Light 100s), she ran out of loose dimes. The coin roll was made of thick shrink-wrapped plastic. It took her ten seconds of unvexed, expressionless bending and prying to work four dimes out into the coin trough.1 Even with this setback, however, I reached her with my shoelaces faster than I would have reached any of the other cashiers. (To be truthful, I had watched her before, when I was at the store to buy earplugs, and thus I already knew that she was the fastest.) I broke a ten. She laid the bills on my palm and released the loose coins into the curve the bills formed\x{2014}the riskiest, most skillful way, which left me with a hand free to take hold of the bag, and which avoided that sometimes embarrassing touch of a stranger\x{2019}s warm hand.

            "1 Although earplugs are essential for getting to sleep, they are useless later on, when you are awakened with night anxieties, and your brain is steeping in a bad fluorescent juice. I slept beautifully through college, but the new job brought regular insomnia, and with it a long period of trial and error, until I hit on the images that most consistently lured me back to sleep. I began with Monday Night at the Movies title sequences: a noun like \x{201c}MEMORANDUM\x{201d} or \x{201c}CALAMARI\x{201d} in huge three-dimensional curving letters, outlined with chrome edgework of lines and blinking stars, rotating on two axes. I meant myself to be asleep by the time I passed through the expanding O, or the dormer window of the A. This did not work for long. In the belief that images with more substance to them, and less abstract pattern, would encourage the dreaming state, I pictured myself driving in a low fast car, taking off from an aircraft carrier in a low fast plane, or twisting water from a towel in a flooded basement. The plane worked best, but it didn\x{2019}t work well. And then, surprised that I had taken so long to think of it, I remembered the convention of counting sheep. In Disney cartoons a little scene of sheep springing lightly over a stile or a picket fence appears in a thought-cloud above the man in the bed, while on the soundtrack violins accompany a soft voice out of 78 records saying, \x{201c}<<One|9k:0>>, <<two|9k:0>>, <<three|9k:0>>, four . . .\x{201d} I thought of story conferences in Disney studios back in the golden days of cartoons: the look of benign concentration on the crouching animator\x{2019}s face as he carefully colored in the outline of a suspended stylized sheep one frame farther along in its arc, warm light from his clamp-on drafting-table lamp shining over the pushpins and masking tape and the special acetate pencil in his hand\x{2014}I was soon successfully asleep. But though this Disney version achieved its purpose, it felt unsatisfactory: I was imagining sheep, true, but the convention, which I wanted to uphold, called for counting them. Yet I didn\x{2019}t feel that there was any point to counting what was obviously the same set of animated frames recycled over and over. I needed to pierce through the cartoon, and create a procession of truly differentiable sheep for myself. So I homed in on each one in its approach to the hurdle and looked for individuating features\x{2014}some thistle prominently caught, or a bit of dried mud on a shank. Some times I strapped a number on the next one to jump and gave him a Kentucky Derby name: Brunch Commander, Nosferatu, I Before E, Wee Willie Winkie. And I made him take the jump very slowly, so that I could study every phase of it\x{2014}the crumbs of airborne dirt floating slowly toward the lens, the soft-lipped grimace, the ripple moving through the wool on landing. If I wasn\x{2019}t off by then, I backed up and reconstructed the sheep\x{2019}s entire day; for I found that it was the approach to the jump, rather than the jump itself, that was sleep-inducing. Some sheep had probably reported for work <<around noon|13>> several towns over, tousled and fractious. <<Around two in the afternoon|9h>>, while at my office, expecting a rough night, I had (I imagined) placed a call to one of the shepherd-dispatchers: Could she send out some random number of sheep not larger than thirty to arrive outside my apartment by <<3:30 A.M.|2a>>, for counting? The practiced crook of the sheep dispatcher travels over her herd, pointing: \x{201c}You, you, you\x{201d}; she repeats my address again and again to her nodding subjects; and my personal flock departs fifteen minutes later, with a voucher to be signed on arrival. All that afternoon they cross village greens, wade brooks, and trot along the median valleys of highways. While I am eating dinner with L., they are still miles away, but by bedtime, <<11:30 P.M.|2a>>, I can spot them with my binoculars coming over a rise: tiny bobbing shapes next to a foreshortened Red Roof Inn sign, still in the next county. And at <<3:30 A.M.|2a>>, when I need them badly, they bustle up, exhilarated from their journey: I put aside the unwritten thank-you letter I have been writhing over, log the sheep in and pay them off, and the first few begin lofting themselves over the planks and milk crates I have assembled out front, their small pink tongues visible with the effort, the whites of their sheep eyes showing; <<one|9k:0>>, <<two|9k:0>>, three . . . and then I have become a very successful director of fabric-softener commercials\x{2014}the agency needs lush shots of jumping sheep; their fleece has to read as golden in the failing sunlight, and the greens of the countryside have to be inconceivably full-throated. I shampoo each sheep myself; I comfort the weepers; I read to the assembled flock from Cardinal Newman\x{2019}s Idea of a University to heighten their sense of purpose and grace, and I demonstrate to them how I need them to send their plump torsos airborne, hike up their rear legs for an added boost, throw their heads back for drama, and always, always lead in their landing with the left forehoof. I give them their cue through a rolled-up script: \x{201c}Okay, number four. Lighter footfalls. Now thrust. Up. And the rear legs! More teeth! Show strain! Now some nostril! And over!\x{201d} Lately I have found that the last thing in my mind before resumed unconsciousness is often the dwindling sight of one lone sheep, who, having cleared my hurdle and been checked off, full of relief and the glow of accomplishment, is hurrying over farther hills to his next assignment, which is to leap an herbal border in slow motion for L., awake with worries of her own beside me.",
