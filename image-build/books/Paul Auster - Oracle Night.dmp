            "On the morning in question \x{2013} September 18, 1982 \x{2013} I left the apartment somewhere between <<nine-thirty|5k:1>> and <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>>. My wife and I lived in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn, midway between Brooklyn Heights and Carroll Gardens. I usually went north on my walks, but that morning I headed south, turning right when I came to Court Street and continuing on for six or seven blocks. The sky was the color of cement: gray clouds, gray air, gray drizzle borne along by gray gusts of wind. I have always had a weakness for that kind of weather, and I felt content in the gloom, not the least bit sorry that the dog days were behind us. About ten minutes after starting out, in the middle of the block between Carroll and President, I spotted a stationery store on the other side of the street. It was wedged in between a shoe-repair shop and a twenty-four-hour bodega, the only bright fa\x{e7}ade in a row of shabby, undistinguished buildings. I gathered that it hadn\x{2019}t been there long, but in spite of its newness, and in spite of the clever display in the window (towers of ballpoints, pencils, and rulers arranged to suggest the New York skyline), the Paper Palace looked too small to contain much of interest. If I decided to cross the street and go in, it must have been because I secretly wanted to start working again \x{2013} without knowing it, without being aware of the urge that had been gathering inside me. I hadn\x{2019}t written anything since coming home from the hospital in May \x{2013} not a sentence, not a word \x{2013} and hadn\x{2019}t felt the slightest inclination to do so. Now, after four months of apathy and silence, I suddenly got it into my head to stock up on a fresh set of supplies: new pens and pencils, new notebook, new ink cartridges and erasers, new pads and folders, new everything.",

Since my return from the hospital, the three of us had made a point of getting together every other Saturday night, alternating meals at our place in Brooklyn (where we cooked for John) with elaborate culinary blowouts at Chez Pierre, an expensive new restaurant in the West Village (where John always insisted on picking up the tab). The original program for that night had been to meet at the bar of Chez Pierre at <<seven-thirty|5b>>, but John had called earlier in the week to say that something was wrong with his leg and that he would have to cancel. It turned out to be an attack of phlebitis (an inflammation of the vein brought on by the presence of a blood clot), but then John had called back on Friday afternoon to tell us that he was feeling a little better. He wasn\x{2019}t supposed to walk, he said, but if we didn\x{2019}t mind coming to his apartment and ordering in Chinese food, maybe we could have our dinner after all. \x{2018}I\x{2019}d hate to miss seeing you and Gracie,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Since I have to eat something anyway, why don\x{2019}t we all do it here together?

I had visited Trause\x{2019}s apartment countless times in the past, but now that I had spent several hours thinking about it in my own apartment in Brooklyn, peopling it with the invented characters of my story, it seemed to belong as much to the world of fiction as to the world of solid objects and flesh-and-blood human beings. Unexpectedly, this feeling didn\x{2019}t go away. If anything, it grew stronger as the night went on, and by the time the Chinese food arrived at <<eight-thirty|5b>>, I was already beginning to settle into what I would have to call (for want of a better term) a state of double consciousness. I was both a part of what was going on around me and cut off from it, drifting freely in my mind as I imagined myself sitting at my desk in Brooklyn, writing about this place in the blue notebook, and sitting in a chair on the top floor of a Manhattan duplex, firmly anchored in my body, listening to what John and Grace were saying to each other and even adding some remarks of my own. It\x{2019}s not unusual for a person to be so preoccupied as to appear absent \x{2013} but the point was that I wasn\x{2019}t absent.

Not since the day of the funeral, in fact, which means we\x{2019}re talking about eight years \x{2013} more than eight years. I\x{2019}d never had much to do with her family while we were married, and now that she wasn\x{2019}t there anymore, I hadn\x{2019}t bothered to stay in touch with them.

So it surprised me when Richard called the other day. He lives in Florida now, he said, and had come to New York on a business trip. Would I be interested in going out to dinner with him?

In one instant, he said, thirty years of his life were erased. It was <<1953|9d:0>>, and he was in the living room of his family\x{2019}s house in West Orange, New Jersey, standing among the guests at Tina\x{2019}s sixteenth birthday party. He remembered everything now: the Sweet Sixteen bash, the caterers unpacking their food in the kitchen and lining up champagne glasses on the counter, the ringing of the doorbell, the music, the din of voices, the chignon knot in Tina\x{2019}s hair, the whooshing of her long yellow dress. One by one, he put each slide in the viewer and looked at all twelve of them. Everyone was there, he said. His mother and father, his cousins, his aunts and uncles, his sister, his sister\x{2019}s friends, and even himself, a scrawny fourteen-year-old with his protruding Adam\x{2019}s apple, flattop haircut, and red clip-on bow tie. It wasn\x{2019}t like looking at normal photographs, he explained. It wasn\x{2019}t even like looking at home movies \x{2013} which always disappoint you with their jerky images and washed-out colors, their sense of belonging to the remote past. The 3-D pictures were incredibly well preserved, supernaturally sharp. Everyone in them looked alive, brimming with energy, present in the moment, a part of some eternal now that had gone on perpetuating itself for close to thirty years. Intense colors, the minutest details shining in utmost clarity, and an illusion of surrounding space, of depth. The longer he looked at the slides, Richard said, the more he felt that he could see the figures breathing, and every time he stopped and went on to the next one, he had the impression that if he\x{2019}d looked a little longer \x{2013} just one more moment \x{2013} they actually would have started to move.",

After Nick undoes the padlock on the wooden door, he puts the keys into the left pocket of the aged, hand-me-down khakis bought at the Goodwill Mission store. As it happens, there\x{2019}s a large hole in that pocket, and the keys slide straight through it, travel down Nick\x{2019}s legs, and land at his feet. He bends over and picks them up, but instead of putting them back into the right pocket, he keeps them in his hand, carries them over to the place where he intends to begin working, and sets them on a shelf in front of a row of telephone books \x{2013} so as not to have them bulging in his pants and digging into his leg as he goes about his chores of lifting and carting, of squatting down and standing up. The air underground is especially clammy that day. Nick works for half an hour, hoping the exercise will warm him up, but the chill settles ever more deeply into his bones, and eventually he decides to withdraw to the apartment at the back of the room, which is equipped with a portable electric heater. He remembers the keys, returns to the spot where he left the ring, and again takes hold of it in his hand. Instead of going straight to the apartment, however, he starts thinking about the Warsaw phone book from 1937/38 that caught his attention the first time he visited the Bureau with Ed. He walks to the other end of the room to look for it, wanting to take it into the apartment with him and study during his break. Again, he puts the keys down on a shelf, but this time, absorbed in his search for the book, he forgets to take them with him after the volume is located. Under normal circumstances, this wouldn\x{2019}t have caused a problem. He would have needed the keys to open the door of the apartment, and once he realized his mistake, he would have gone back to fetch them. But that morning, in the frenzy that followed Ed\x{2019}s sudden collapse, the door was left open, and as Nick walks toward that door now, already flipping through the pages of the Warsaw phone book and thinking about some of the gruesome stories Ed told him <<about 1945|18:1>>, he is distracted enough not to pay attention to what he is doing. If he thinks about the keys at all, he will take it for granted that he\x{2019}s put them in his right pocket, and so he walks straight into the room, turns on the overhead light, and kicks the door shut behind him \x{2013} thereby locking himself in.

            "BORN IN A TOILET,
BABY DISCARDED

High on crack, a 22-year-old reputed prostitute gave birth over a toilet in a Bronx SRO, then dumped her dead baby in an outdoor garbage bin, police said yesterday.The woman, police said, had been having sex with a john <<about 1 a.m.|5>> yesterday when she left the room they were sharing at <<450|3:1>> Cyrus Pl. and walked into a bathroom to smoke crack. Sitting over a toilet, the woman \x{2018}feels the water break, feels something come out,\x{2019} Sgt. Michael Ryan said.But police said the woman \x{2013} wasted on crack \x{2013} apparently was not aware she had given birth.Twenty minutes later, the woman noticed the dead baby in the bowl, wrapped her in a towel, and dropped her in a garbage bin. She then returned to her customer and resumed having sex, Ryan said. A dispute over payment soon broke out, however, and police said the woman stabbed her customer in the chest <<about 1:15 a.m.|2a>>Police said the woman, identified as Kisha White, fled to her apartment on 188th Street. Later, White returned to the Dumpster and recovered her baby. A neighbor, however, saw her return and called the police.
When I finished reading the article for the first time, I said to myself: This is the worst story I have ever read. It was hard enough to absorb the information about the baby, but when I came to the stabbing incident in the fourth paragraph, I understood that I was reading a story about the end of mankind, that that room in the Bronx was the precise spot on earth where human life had lost its meaning. I paused for a few moments, trying to catch my breath, trying to stop myself from trembling, and then I read the article again. This time, my eyes filled with tears. The tears were so sudden, so unexpected, that I immediately covered my face with my hands to make sure no one saw them. If the coffee shop hadn\x{2019}t been crowded with customers, I probably would have collapsed in a fit of real sobbing. I didn\x{2019}t go that far, but it took every bit of strength in me to hold myself back.",

My culinary skills were limited, but I had once worked as a short-order cook, and I had a certain talent for whipping up spare and simple dinners. The first job was to peel the potatoes, and as I started slicing away the skins over a brown paper bag, the plot of the story finally came to me.

            "At first, Grace seemed to take the news calmly. I showed her the gap in the bookshelf where the first editions had been, pointed to the end table on which the portable TV had stood, then led her into the kitchen and informed her that we would have to buy a new toaster. Grace opened the drawers below the counter (which I had neglected to do) and discovered that our best set of silverware, which had been given to us by her parents as a first-anniversary present, was also missing. That was when anger took hold of her. She kicked the bottom drawer with her right foot and started to curse. Grace seldom used four-letter words, but for a minute or <<two that morning|5>> she was beside herself, and she let go with a barrage of invective that surpassed anything I\x{2019}d heard from her lips before. Then we went into the bedroom, and her anger spilled over into tears. Her lower lip started to tremble when I told her about the jewelry box, but when she saw that the lithograph was gone as well, she sat down on the bed and started to cry. I did my best to comfort her, promising to look for another van Velde as soon as possible, but I knew that nothing could ever replace the one she\x{2019}d bought as a twenty-year-old on her first trip to Paris: a swooping configuration of variegated, glowing blues, punctuated by a roundish blank in the center and a broken streak of red. I had been living with it for several years by then, and I had never grown tired of looking at it. It was one of those works that kept giving you something, that never seemed to use itself up.12",

When Byrd reached the Barrow Street apartment, John offered him a drink, and once the two men had finished their Scotch and sodas, they sat down to the task of rewriting Trause\x{2019}s will. The old one had been drawn up more than seven years earlier, and it no longer represented John\x{2019}s desires concerning the disposal of his estate. In the aftermath of Tina\x{2019}s death, he had named Jacob as his sole heir and beneficiary, appointing his brother Gilbert to serve as executor until the boy reached the age of twenty-five. Now, by the simple act of tearing up all copies of that document, Trause disinherited his son in front of his lawyer\x{2019}s eyes. Byrd then typed out a new will that bequeathed everything John owned to Gilbert. All cash, all stocks and bonds, all property, and all future royalties to be earned from Trause\x{2019}s literary works would henceforth be inherited by his younger brother. They finished at <<five-thirty|5b>>. John shook Byrd\x{2019}s hand, thanking him for his help, and the lawyer left the apartment with three signed copies of the new will. Twenty minutes later, John went back to proofreading his novel.

Under normal circumstances, Grace and I would have turned on the television as we were setting the table and preparing our dinner, but we didn\x{2019}t have a television anymore, so we went through the evening without knowing that John was lying in the city morgue, without knowing that his brother Gilbert was already on a plane from Detroit to New York, without knowing that Jacob was on the loose.

            "6. Much of her graphic work was inspired by looking at art, and before my collapse at the beginning of the year, we had often spent our Saturday afternoons wandering in and out of galleries and museums together. In some sense, art had made our marriage possible, and without the intervention of art, I doubt that I would have found the courage to pursue her. It was fortunate that we had met in the neutral surroundings of Holst & McDermott, a so-called work environment. If we had been thrown together in any other way \x{2013} at a dinner party, for example, or on a bus or a plane \x{2013} I wouldn\x{2019}t have been able to contact her again without exposing my intentions, and I instinctively felt that Grace had to be approached with caution. If I tipped my hand too early, I was almost certain I would lose my chance with her forever.
 \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Luckily, I had an excuse to call. She had been assigned to work on the cover of my book, and under the pretext of having a new idea to discuss with her, I rang up her office two days after our initial meeting and asked if I could come in and see her. \x{2018}Anytime you like,\x{2019} she said. Anytime proved to be difficult to arrange. I had a regular job then (teaching history at John Jay High School in Brooklyn), and I couldn\x{2019}t make it to her office before <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>. As it happened, Grace\x{2019}s agenda was clogged with late-afternoon appointments for the rest of the week. When she suggested that we meet the following Monday or Tuesday, I told her I was going out of town to give a reading (which happened to be true, but I probably would have said it even if it wasn\x{2019}t), so Grace relented and offered to squeeze in some time for me after work on Friday. \x{2018}I have to be somewhere at <<eight|9c:1>>,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}but if we met for an hour or so at <<five-thirty|5b>>, it shouldn\x{2019}t be a problem.\x{2019}
 \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} I had stolen the title of my book from a 1938 pencil drawing by Willem de Kooning. Self-Portrait with Imaginary Brother is a small, delicately rendered piece that depicts two boys standing side by side, one a year or two older than the other, one in long pants, the other in knickers. Much as I admired the drawing, it was the title that interested me, and I had used it not because I wanted to refer to de Kooning but because of the words themselves, which I found highly evocative and which seemed to fit the novel I had written. In Betty Stolowitz\x{2019}s office earlier that week, I had suggested putting de Kooning\x{2019}s drawing on the cover. Now I was planning to tell Grace that I thought it was a bad idea \x{2013} that the pencil strokes were too faint and wouldn\x{2019}t be visible enough, that the effect would be too muted. But I didn\x{2019}t really care. If I had argued against the drawing in Betty\x{2019}s office, I would have been for it now. All I wanted was a chance to see Grace again \x{2013} and art was my way in, the one subject that wouldn\x{2019}t compromise my true purpose.
 \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her willingness to see me after office hours gave me hope, but at the same time the news that she was going out at <<eight o\x{2019}clock|6>> all but destroyed that hope. There was little question that she had an appointment with a man (attractive women are always with a man on Friday night), but it was impossible to know how deeply connected she was to him. It could have been a first date, and it could have been a quiet dinner with her fianc\x{e9} or live-in boyfriend. I knew she wasn\x{2019}t married (Betty had told me as much after Grace left her office following our first meeting), but the range of other intimacies was boundless. When I asked Betty if Grace was involved with anyone, she said she didn\x{2019}t know. Grace kept her private life to herself, and no one in the company had the smallest inkling of what she did outside the office. Two or three editors had asked her out since she\x{2019}d started working there, but she\x{2019}d turned them all down.
 \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} I quickly learned that Grace was not someone who shared confidences. In the ten months I knew her before we were married, she never once divulged a secret or hinted at any prior entanglements with other men. Nor did I ever ask her to tell me something she didn\x{2019}t seem willing to talk about. That was the power of Grace\x{2019}s silence. If you meant to love her in the way she demanded to be loved, then you had to accept the line she\x{2019}d drawn between herself and words.
 \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} (Once, in an early conversation I had with her about her childhood, she reminisced about a favorite doll her parents had given her when she was seven. She named her Pearl, carried her everywhere for the next four or five years, and considered her to be her best friend. The remarkable thing about Pearl was that she was able to talk and understood everything that was said to her. But Pearl never uttered a word in Grace\x{2019}s presence. Not because she couldn\x{2019}t speak, but because she chose not to.)
 \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} There was someone in her life at the time I met her \x{2013} I\x{2019}m sure of that \x{2013} but I never learned his name or how seriously she felt about him. Quite seriously, I would imagine, for the first six months proved to be a tempestuous time for me, and they ended badly, with Grace telling me she wanted to break it off and that I shouldn\x{2019}t call her anymore. Through all the disappointments of those months, however, all the ephemeral victories and tiny surges of optimism, the rebuffs and capitulations, the nights when she was too busy to see me and the nights when she allowed me to share her bed, through all the ups and downs of that desperate, failed courtship, Grace was always an enchanted being for me, a luminous point of contact between desire and the world, the implacable love. I kept my word and didn\x{2019}t call her, but six or seven weeks later she contacted me out of the blue and said she had changed her mind. She didn\x{2019}t offer any explanation, but I gathered that the man who had been my rival was now out of the picture. Not only did she want to start seeing me again, she said, but she wanted us to get married. Marriage was the one word I had never spoken in her presence. It had been in my head from the first moment I saw her, but I had never dared to say it, for fear it would frighten her off. Now Grace was proposing to me. I had resigned myself to living out the rest of my life with a shattered heart, and now she was telling me I could live with her instead \x{2013} in one piece, my whole life in one piece with her.",

            "9. Four years earlier, I had adapted one of the stories from my first book, Tabula Rasa, for a young director named Vincent Frank. It was a small, low-budget film about a musician who recovers from a long illness and slowly puts his life together again (a prophetic story, as it turned out), and when the film was released in June 1980, it did fairly well. Tabula Rasa played in just a few art houses around the country, but it was perceived as a critical success, and \x{2013} as Mary was fond of reminding me \x{2013} it helped bring my name to the attention of a so-called wider public. Sales of my books began to improve somewhat, it\x{2019}s true, and when I turned in my next novel nine months later, A Short Dictionary of Human Emotions, she negotiated a contract with Holst & McDermott worth twice the amount I\x{2019}d been given for my previous book. That advance, along with the modest sum I\x{2019}d earned from the screenplay, allowed me to quit my high school teaching job, which had been my bread-and-butter work for the past seven years. Until then, I had been one of those obscure and driven writers who wrote between <<five|20>> and <<seven in the morning|5>>, who wrote at night and on weekends, who never went anywhere on his summer vacation in order to sit at home in a sweltering Brooklyn apartment and make up for lost time. Now, a year and a half after my marriage to Grace, I found myself in the luxurious position of being an independent, self-employed scribbler. We were hardly what could be called well off, but if I continued to produce work at a steady pace, our combined incomes would keep us floating along with our heads above water. Following the release of Tabula Rasa, a few offers came in to write more films, but the projects hadn\x{2019}t interested me, and I\x{2019}d turned them down to push on with my novel. When Holst & McDermott brought out the book in February 1982, however, I wasn\x{2019}t aware that it had been published. I had already been in the hospital for five weeks by then, and I wasn\x{2019}t aware of anything \x{2013} not even that the doctors thought I would be dead within a matter of days.
 \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Tabula Rasa had been a union production, and in order to be given credit for my screenplay I had been obliged to join the Writers Guild. Membership entailed sending in quarterly dues and turning over a small percentage of your earnings to them, but among the things they gave you in return was a decent health insurance policy. If not for that insurance, my illness would have landed me in debtor\x{2019}s prison. Most of the costs were covered, but as with all medical plans, there were countless other issues to be reckoned with: deductibles, extra charges for experimental treatments, arcane percentages and sliding-scale calculations for various medicines and disposable implements, a staggering range of bills that had put me in the hole to the tune of thirty-six thousand dollars. That was the burden Grace and I had been saddled with, and the more my strength returned, the more I worried about how to get us out from under this debt. Grace\x{2019}s father had offered to help, but the judge wasn\x{2019}t a rich man, and with Grace\x{2019}s two younger sisters still in college, we couldn\x{2019}t bring ourselves to accept. Instead, we sent in a small amount every month, trying to chip away at the mountain slowly, but at the rate we were going, we would still be at it when we were senior citizens. Grace worked in publishing, which meant her salary was meager at best, and I had earned nothing now for close to a year. A few microscopic royalties and foreign advances, but that was the extent of it. That explains why I returned Mary\x{2019}s call immediately after I listened to her message. I hadn\x{2019}t given any thought to writing more screenplays, but if the price was right for this one, I had no intention of turning down the job.",
