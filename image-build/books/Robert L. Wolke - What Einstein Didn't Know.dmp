            "For example, a solution of two cups of sugar in one cup of water (yes, it\x{2019}s possible; see p. 76) won\x{2019}t start boiling until <<217|3:0>> instead of 212 degrees Fahrenheit (103 instead of 100 degrees Celsius). But then as you continue to heat it, many of the water molecules will boil off as vapor, and the sugar solution will become more and more concentrated. It will develop a higher and higher proportion of sugar to water. The more concentrated it becomes, the higher its boiling temperature becomes, so the longer you boil it, the hotter it gets. Because of this, candy recipes can use temperature as an indication of how concentrated the sugar syrup is and therefore how hard or sticky it\x{2019}ll be when cooled.",

            "Picture the Earth as a sphere covered by a layer of air\x{2014}the atmosphere\x{2014}a couple of hundred miles thick. When the sun is directly overhead, its rays are coming down perpendicular to the atmosphere and to the ground, penetrating the least possible amount of atmosphere in the process. But when the sun is lower in the sky, its rays are coming to us obliquely and somewhat horizontally, having to penetrate much more of the atmosphere before getting to us. Because the atmosphere scatters and absorbs some sunlight, the more atmosphere the rays have to penetrate, the less intense they become. So low sun is weaker in intensity than high sun. Near sunrise or sunset, it is almost three hundred times dimmer than at <<noon|13>>.",

In a darkened room, shine the round beam of a penlight or tiny flashlight onto the surface of an orange. The penlight is the sun and the orange is the Earth. First hold the penlight directly above the equator, in <<noonday|13>> position. You\x{2019}ll see a perfectly circular beam of sunlight landing on the Earth. Now, holding the sun the same distance from the Earth (makes you feel powerful, doesn\x{2019}t it?), shine the beam onto the Earth obliquely, a little to the left (west) of where you had it before, in late afternoon position. You\x{2019}ll see an oval-shaped light on the orange, as if the circle of sunlight has been smeared out. Well, it has been. The same amount of light is now spread out over a larger area, so of course its intensity at any one spot must be lower.",
