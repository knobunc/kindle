And then she got sick. And died. Watching her ebb away, seeing her beauty diminish, witnessing the awful alteration of her face and body was too much for Jerry to bear and he sometimes fled her bedroom, ashamed of his weakness, avoiding his father. Jerry wished he could be as strong as his father, always in control, masking his sorrow and grief. When his mother finally died, suddenly, at <<three-thirty in the afternoon|5>>, slipping off quietly without a murmur, Jerry was overcome with rage, a fiery anger that found him standing at her coffin in silent fury. He was angry at the way the disease had ravaged her. He was angry at his inability to do anything about saving her. His anger was so deep and sharp in him that it drove out sorrow. He wanted to bellow at the world, cry out against her death, topple buildings, split the earth open, tear down trees. And he did nothing except lie awake in the dark, thinking of her body there in the funeral home, not her anymore, but a thing suddenly, cold and pale. His father was a stranger during those terrible days, like a sleepwalker going through the motions, like a puppet being maneuvered by invisible strings. Jerry felt hopeless and abandoned, all tight inside. Even at the cemetery, they stood apart from each other, a huge distance between them even though they were side by side. But not touching. And then, at the end of the service, as they turned to leave, Jerry found himself in his father\x{2019}s arms, his face pressed close to his father\x{2019}s body, smelling the cigarette tobacco, the faint odor of peppermint mouthwash, that familiar smell that was his father. There in the cemetery, clinging to each other in mutual sorrow and loss, the tears came for both of them. Jerry didn\x{2019}t know where his own tears began and his father\x{2019}s left off. They wept without shame, out of a nameless need, and walked together afterward, arm in arm, toward the waiting car. The fiery knot of anger had come undone, unraveled, and Jerry realized as they drove back from the cemetery that something worse had taken its place\x{2014}emptiness, a yawning cavity like a hole in his chest.",

            "Tubs\x{2019} left arm began to ache from the weight of the chocolates and he shifted his burden to his other arm, taking a moment to pat the reassuring bulge of his wallet. He had already sold three boxes\x{2014}six dollars\x{2014}but that wasn\x{2019}t enough, of course. He was still desperate. He needed a hell of a lot more by tonight and nobody but nobody had bought any chocolates at the last six houses he\x{2019}d visited. He had saved every cent he could from his allowance and had even sneaked a folded and greasy dollar bill from his father\x{2019}s pocket last night when he arrived home, half-drunk and wobbly. He hated doing that\x{2014}stealing from his own father. He vowed to return the money to him as soon as possible. When would that be? Tubs didn\x{2019}t know. Money, money, money had become the constant need of his life, money and his love for Rita. His allowance barely made it possible for him to take her to the movies and for a coke afterward. <<Two-fifty|5k:0>> each for the movies, fifty cents for two cokes. And his parents hated her for some reason. He had to sneak out to meet her. He had to make phone calls from Ossie Baker\x{2019}s house. She\x{2019}s too old for you, his mother said, when actually Tubs himself was six months older. All right, she looks old, his mother said. What his mother should have said was, she looks beautiful. She was so beautiful that she made Tubs all shaky inside, like an earthquake going on. At night in bed, he could have one without even touching himself, just thinking of her. And now her birthday was tomorrow and he had to buy her the present she wanted, the bracelet she\x{2019}d seen in the window of Black\x{2019}s downtown, that terrible and beautiful bracelet all sparkles and radiance, terrible because of the price tag: \$18.95 plus tax. \x{201c}Hon,\x{201d}\x{2014}she never called him Tubs\x{2014}\x{201c}that\x{2019}s what I want most in all the world.\x{201d} Jesus\x{2014}\$18.95 plus the 3 per cent sales tax which Tubs figured out would make a grand total of \$19.52, the sales tax amounting to fifty-seven cents. He knew that he didn\x{2019}t have to buy her the bracelet.",

Now, he watched the kid Renault, looking as if he was ready to faint with fright, his face pale and eyes wide with dread, and Archie having fun with him. Jesus. Carter hated this psychological crap.

He hadn\x{2019}t cried at all from the beating, had lain there on the ground for a few moments after the brief blackout, and then had dragged himself up and made it agonizingly to the locker room at school, walking as if on a tightrope and one misstep would send him hurtling into depths below: oblivion.

After a while, he took a warm bath, soaking in the water. Then he sat in the dark, quiet, letting himself mend, not stirring, feeling a dull ache settle in his bones now that the first waves of pain had moved away. The clock struck <<six|11>>.

Archie, who\x{2019}d been going down to defeat\x{2014}what a great scene that had been, the last <<Vigils|13>> meeting when he\x{2019}d stood there humiliated\x{2014}but now he was on top again, all the chocolate sold, in charge once more, the entire school in the palm of his hand. All of which proves that the meek don\x{2019}t inherit the earth. Not very original. Archie must have said it at one time or another.",

And now this\x{2014}this wacky raffle. Never anything like it at Trinity. Or anywhere. And he had to admit that he was kind of enjoying himself even though he had protested when Archie approached him this afternoon, asking him to take charge of the raffle. \x{201c}You did great with the chocolates,\x{201d} Archie said.

So we have a perfect setup here. The greed part\x{2014}a kid pays a buck for a chance to win a hundred. Plus fifty boxes of chocolates. The cruel part\x{2014}watching two guys hitting each other, maybe hurting each other, while they\x{2019}re safe in the bleachers.

            "Carter disguised his disgust. Archie repelled him in many ways but most of all by the way he made everybody feel dirty, contaminated, polluted. As if there was no goodness at all in the world. And yet Carter had to admit that he was looking forward to the fight, that he himself had bought not one but two tickets. Did that make him like everybody else\x{2014}greedy and cruel, as Archie said? The question surprised him. Hell, he\x{2019}d always thought of himself as one of the good guys. He had often used his position as president of The <<Vigils|13>> to keep control of Archie, to prevent him from going overboard on assignments. But did that make him one of the good guys? The question bothered Carter. That\x{2019}s what he hated about Archie. He made you feel guilty all the time. Christ, the world couldn\x{2019}t be as bad as Archie said it was. But hearing the shouts of the kids in the bleachers, impatient for the fight to get underway, Carter wondered.",

In the garish stadium light, the box was revealed as worn and threadbare, a small wooden container that might have been a discarded jewelry box. And yet it was a legend in the school. For potential victims, it was possible deliverance, protection, a weapon to be used against the might of The <<Vigils|13>>. Others doubted its existence: Archie Costello would never allow that sort of thing. But here was the black box now. Out in the open. In front of the whole frigging school.

He had washed his hands of the school and its cruelties and hadn\x{2019}t wanted to witness Jerry\x{2019}s daily humiliations. The school also reminded him of his own betrayals and defections. For three days, he\x{2019}d been home in bed. Sick. He wasn\x{2019}t at all sure whether he\x{2019}d really been sick or whether his conscience had revolted, infecting his body, leaving him weak and nauseous. At any rate, the bed had become his private world, a small safe place without people, without The <<Vigils|13>>, without Brother Leon, a world with no chocolates to sell, no rooms to destroy, no people to destroy. But one of the guys called up and told him about the fight between Jerry and Janza. And how the raffle tickets would control the fight. The Goober had moaned in protest. The bed had become unbearable. He had tossed and turned all day, prowling the bed like an animal seeking sleep, oblivion. He didn\x{2019}t want to go to the fight\x{2014}Jerry couldn\x{2019}t possibly win. But he couldn\x{2019}t stay in bed, either. Finally, desperate, he had gotten out of bed, and dressed hurriedly, ignoring the protests of his parents. He had taken the bus across town and walked half a mile to the stadium. Now, he huddled in the seat, looking down at the platform, listening to Carter explaining the rules of the crazy fight. Terrible.",
