Des and the rest of the early crew worked from <<0800|18:1>> to 1800; his counterparts worked from 1800 to <<0800|18:1>>. Groshik, in an effort to maximize profits, opened each afternoon at <<1300|9c:0>> and didn\x{2019}t close for ten straight hours. This allowed him to serve the night-crew workers before they started and catch the day crew when that shift was over. He\x{2019}d close at <<0300|9c:1>>, clean for two hours, sleep for six, then get up at <<1100|9c:0>> and start the process all over again. His routine was well known to all the miners; the Neimoidian was as regular as the rising and setting of Apatros\x{2019}s pale orange sun.",

The ground was composed of wet sand, molecular-compressed where walkways were needed, a far cry from the permacrete that was the modern construction standard. The buildings lining the walkways were made from some kind of plain but solid-looking white stone, its onetime cleanliness now marred by the brown and green mottlings of dirt and mold. A sprinkling of pedestrians roamed the streets, most showing the same general deterioration as the spaceport itself, and here and there a hurrying swoop or landspeeder could be glimpsed between the buildings.",
