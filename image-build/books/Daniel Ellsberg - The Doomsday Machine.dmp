In fact, after their troops were forced off the continent at Dunkirk in 1940, it was the only offensive effort they could take. And making that effort, effective or not, was prompted by strong political motivations. They had to counter the general conviction in the world that Hitler was bound to win the war, especially after his early successes in Russia in 1941. In 1940\x{2013}41 it was particularly important to the British to show their potential American allies that they were fully in the fight, that they were an ally worth supporting; likewise, after mid-1941, to show the Soviets that the British were taking and inflicting losses in fighting Germans, even if not comparable to those on the eastern front.
