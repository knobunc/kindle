The ocean was dark outside my windows. I was reading an analysis of the optimal conditions, from a Soviet point of view, for a surprise attack. A key point, I read, would be for them to accompany ICBM and bomber attacks on SAC bases deep in our interior with carefully coordinated attacks by cruise missiles from submarines onto bases near our oceans and on command centers (outflanking our radar in the north and providing no warning, with only minutes of flight time).',

The key projection was when the Soviets would or might have 300 or more. That was generally agreed to be the number that would allow coverage by missiles alone of all SAC bases in the United States and abroad as well as our soft ICBM sites. General Thomas Power had testified to Congress that the Soviets might have had that critical, dangerous arsenal in 1960, as Herman Kahn had been predicting. The CIA, as of June, put that as an upper level in mid-1963. The State Department had it as an upper level in mid-1962, and the Air Force definitely estimated <<about 300|18:0>> by mid-1962, with <<about 550|18:0>> in mid-1963 and over 1,000 in 1965.',

In fact, after their troops were forced off the continent at Dunkirk in 1940, it was the only offensive effort they could take. And making that effort, effective or not, was prompted by strong political motivations. They had to counter the general conviction in the world that Hitler was bound to win the war, especially after his early successes in Russia in 1941. In 1940\x{2013}41 it was particularly important to the British to show their potential American allies that they were fully in the fight, that they were an ally worth supporting; likewise, after mid-1941, to show the Soviets that the British were taking and inflicting losses in fighting Germans, even if not comparable to those on the eastern front. Bomber Command offered itself as the only force that could deliver either message. After the United States was attacked at the end of 1941, it was still important to show that aid to Britain was as important to America as its own competing rearmament.",

(The word he used for morale, incidentally, was \x{201c}moral effect,\x{201d} as in, \x{201c}the moral effect is to physical effect as <<twenty to one|10a:0>>.\x{201d} This makes a peculiar impression on an American reader, since the \x{201c}moral\x{201d} objective it refers to involves the deliberate killing of civilians.) So the agreement that Britain made on September 2, 1939, the day after Roosevelt\x{2019}s appeal, that they would not bomb civilian populations, was potentially quite a restriction on what Bomber Command was really preparing itself to do in terms of producing heavy bombers, such as the four-engine Lancaster that came into operation in early 1942.",
