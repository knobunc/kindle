            "Sherlock Holmes was still very much a part of Conan Doyle\x{2019}s commerce. In late 1897, he drafted a play about Sherlock Holmes, probably because his expenses had been unexpectedly heavy in building a new home in Hindhead, which he named \x{201c}Undershaw.\x{201d} Production of the play languished until May 1899, when American stage actor William Gillette approached Conan Doyle about a stage play based on the Adventures and the Memoirs (to be backed by American impresario Charles Frohman), and Conan Doyle revived the idea. The play, although styled Sherlock Holmes and billed as having been written by Conan Doyle and Gillette, was wholly written by Gillette. Drawing freely from the stories, the \x{201c}melodrama in four acts\x{201d} opened in Buffalo, New York, on October 23, 1899, and, some say, has never really ceased being performed. Gillette, who wrote his plays principally for himself, toured in it virtually continuously in America and England until <<1932|9c:0>>, giving over 1,300 performances as Holmes; and numerous amateur and professional theatre companies essayed the drama throughout the twentieth century and around the globe on stage, radio, and television. Since 1976, such luminaries as John Wood, Leonard Nimoy, and Frank Langella have assumed the lead r\x{f4}le.",

            "As in the case of Holmes, little is known of the young adulthood of John H. Watson. He took his doctor\x{2019}s degree at the University of London in 1878, and scholars place his birthdate at <<1851|18:0>> or 1852, seven or eight years before Arthur Conan Doyle\x{2019}s. There is some evidence that he spent a portion of his boyhood in Australia, and he attended public school in England. Watson\x{2019}s mother apparently died shortly after the birth of young John, although his father (H. Watson) and his elder brother survived until the mid-1880s. In his youth, Watson played rugby for Blackheath, and his love of sport and physical activity may have led him, after his residency at St. Bartholomew\x{2019}s Hospital, to take up a military career. Whatever his motivations, Dr. Watson enrolled in the required course for army surgeons at Netley. Upon completion of his training, he was posted to the Northumberland Fusiliers as assistant surgeon.",

            "In 1894 an event occurred that caused Watson to faint for the first and only time in his life: the return of Sherlock Holmes. Cruelly deceived by Holmes, Watson had mourned for three years for his friend but now embraced him upon his \x{201c}resurrection.\x{201d} Without a selfish thought (for Watson clearly had ample notes of pre-1891 cases to write up), Watson sold his practice and returned to Baker Street to live with Holmes. Then began another \x{201c}Great Hiatus\x{201d}\x{2014}the temporary cessation of Watson\x{2019}s career as a writer. While Holmes continued to jibe at Watson regarding his writing (see Holmes\x{2019}s remarks in \x{201c}The Abbey Grange\x{201d} and \x{201c}Wisteria Lodge,\x{201d} both definitely post-1891 cases), he apparently forbade Watson to publish anything further. Holmes did not relent until <<1901|9c:0>>, when Watson was permitted to publish the first instalment of The Hound of the Baskervilles, a report of an astonishing case that evidently took place before Holmes\x{2019}s disappearance in 1891. This case is all the more remarkable because it was published while Holmes was in active practice in London.",

Over a dozen more films have appeared since then, including most recently Without a Clue (1988), a comedy disclosing that Watson was the real investigator, with Holmes merely an actor hired to handle the public aspects of Watson\x{2019}s investigations. Michael Caine starred as Holmes, and Ben Kingsley as Watson. None of these recent versions has risen to the heights of perfection, but many point to the 1965 A Study in Terror (known as Fog in England), starring John Neville and Donald Houston, as the most literate script and high-quality production ever combined in a Sherlock Holmes film. The first film to depict Holmes dealing with Jack the Ripper, it broke new ground in its theory of the Ripper and showed a warm and believable relationship between Holmes and a highly competent Dr. Watson.",

            "SERIOUS study of Sherlock Holmes and the Watsonian Canon is generally considered to begin with Frank Sidgwick, who, under the signature \x{201c}F. S.,\x{201d} wrote an \x{201c}open letter to Dr. Watson,\x{201d} published in the Cambridge Review of January 23, 1902. Almost simultaneously, in America, Arthur Bartlett Maurice wrote \x{201c}Some Inconsistencies of Sherlock Holmes\x{201d} for The Bookman. In 1904, the English critic and poet Andrew Lang, best known for his collections of fairy tales, carefully analysed \x{201c}The Three Students\x{201d} in Longman\x{2019}s Magazine. The real launch of Sherlockian studies, however, can be attributed to Father Ronald Knox, who wrote, as a parody of serious biblical scholarship, a paper entitled \x{201c}Studies in the Literature of Sherlock Holmes\x{201d} (1911). He urged the reader of the Holmes cycle (which in a Biblical reference, became known as the Canon) to apply \x{201c}the method by which we treat as significant what the author did not mean to be significant, by which we single out as essential what the author regarded as incidental.\x{201d} There was a special fascination, he suggested, in applying this method to Sherlock Holmes \x{201c}because it is, in a sense, Holmes\x{2019}s own method. \x{2018}It has long been an axiom of mine,\x{2019} he says, \x{2018}that the little things are infinitely the most important.\x{2019} It might be the motto of his life\x{2019}s work.\x{201d} The essay became very popular among his fellow Oxford students, but not until <<1928|9c:0>>, when the essay was published in book form, did it have a more widespread impact. Other scholars in England and America began to publish works considering the biographical aspects of Watson and later Holmes, and in 1934, the first collection of essays, Baker Street Studies, was published in England (by an American, H. W. Bell).",

Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.

It is also the headquarters of the manufacture of bicycles and tricycles.\x{201d} However, Coventry is perhaps most famous for a legendary horseback ride. In the eleventh century, Lady Godiva bargained with her husband, a powerful noble, to reduce taxes in the district. He promised to do so if she rode naked on horseback through the Coventry marketplace at <<midday|13>>. Lady Godiva made her now-famous ride, and the taxes were eliminated. The story was recorded several times before <<1400|9c:1>>. In later accounts, probably at the urging of churchmen, the account was embellished with the tale of \x{201c}Peeping Tom,\x{201d} who was struck blind (or dead) when he alone gazed upon Lady Godiva. Another later invention was the detail of the story, often added, that Godiva was covered totally, except for her legs, by an enormous and improbable quantity of hair.

By the latter half of the nineteenth century, British India was beginning to echo with calls for reform. Following the bloody Indian Mutiny of 1857 (see the appendix on page 605), the East India Company\x{2014}which had run India for nearly a century, since shortly after one of its military officials, Robert Clive, recaptured Calcutta from the nawab of Bengal\x{2014}was abolished and power transferred to the Crown. Steps were made in the early 1860s toward allowing Indians to participate in government, and the Indian National Congress, a political party, was formed to further that goal in 1885. Yet despite such stirrings of change, India remained wholly a British subject (Queen Victoria was named empress in 1877) until <<1947|9c:0>>. Calcutta is the site of the opulent Victoria Memorial, commissioned to honour the queen by viceroy Lord Curzon and constructed in 1905\x{2013}1921.

At <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>> yesterday afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in by the postman. A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with coarse salt.

There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty, has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything through the post. Some years ago, however, when she resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular habits. The police are of opinion that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by these youths, who owed her a grudge, and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. Some probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss Cushing\x{2019}s belief, from Belfast.

Half in my dreams I was dimly conscious that something was going on in the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle light, and astonishment held me dumb. She wore an expression such as I had never seen before\x{2014}such as I should have thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale, and breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed, as she fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then, thinking that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking, which could only come from the hinges of the front door.

Crucial to containment of the disease were the efforts to regulate milk production and sale and the researches of German physician Emil von Behring, who helped develop the use of antitoxins to treat both diphtheria and tetanus (the diphtheria experiments he conducted from 1893 to 1895 led to his being awarded the first Nobel Prize for medicine in 1901); and Hungarian-American pediatrician Bela Schick, who in 1913 developed a skin test\x{2014}the appropriately named \x{201c}Schick test\x{201d}\x{2014}that could determine whether or not a child was susceptible to the disease.

            "The Tories transformed into the Conservative party <<after 1830|18:1>>, when John Wilson Croker described the faction with that term in the Quarterly Review. (Conservatives may still be referred to as Tories, but the Whigs were subsumed by the emerging Liberal party\x{2014}which eventually disintegrated and gave way to the Labour party in the early twentieth century.) Out of favor in a time of anti-imperialism, Conservatives weathered a fallow period of three decades before being brought triumphantly back to prominence by Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli (1868, 1874\x{2013}1880), who saw the need for the party to reach out to a broader populace and encourage social reform. He did this in large part by leading passage of the surprising (for the elitist Tories) Reform Act of 1867, which more than doubled the electorate when previously only one out of every six adult males was able to vote. Disraeli\x{2019}s courting of the middle and working classes was a master stroke, and it paid off handsomely; as A. N. Wilson reports, \x{201c}Conservatism, of a sort, was the dominant political creed of the second half of Victoria\x{2019}s reign.\x{201d}",

Italy joined the two in May 1882, out of anger at France over its invasion of Tunisia, and thus the Triple Alliance was born. In this delicate coalition (which eventually came to include Serbia and Romania), Italy was always something of an ambivalent outsider, given its rivalry with Austria-Hungary over the Balkans. Nonetheless, the treaty was periodically renewed until <<1914|18:0>> when Italy, contrary to the terms of the alliance, declared neutrality in World War I and ultimately joined the Allies to oppose its former conspirators.',

            "To paraphrase Watson, it was with heavy hearts that Strand Magazine readers began the tale Watson recorded as \x{201c}The Final Problem,\x{201d} which purported to include Watson\x{2019}s \x{201c}last words\x{201d} about Sherlock Holmes. The story stunned the British public, cost the Strand Magazine twenty thousand subscribers, and led to an outbreak of black armbands. Watson kept his silence until <<1901|9c:0>>, eight years after publication of \x{201c}The Final Problem,\x{201d} when he published The Hound of the Baskervilles, another reminiscence of Holmes. The modern reader knows that Holmes did not die, as Watson evidently believed at the close of this account, but instead returned to London in 1894. For obscure reasons, Holmes refused to allow Watson to disclose this information to his readers until <<1903|9c:0>>, when Watson was permitted to reveal the true conclusion of the events of \x{201c}The Final Problem\x{201d} in connection with his report of \x{201c}The Adventure of the Empty House,\x{201d} the first story of the volume entitled The Return of Sherlock Holmes. But \x{201c}The Final Problem\x{201d} is a fine drama in its own right, with the tense and thrilling encounters between Holmes and Professor Moriarty (copied by William Gillette with great success in his play Sherlock Holmes and aped in countless films thereafter). Moriarty, who has achieved near-legendary status as the arch-nemesis of Holmes, appears only in \x{201c}The Final Problem,\x{201d} \x{201c}The Empty House,\x{201d} and The Valley of Fear, and so the information about him in this tale has been carefully mined by scholars.",

            "\x{201c}My dear Watson, Professor Moriarty is not a man who lets the grass grow under his feet. I went out <<about midday|13>> to transact some business in Oxford Street. As I passed the corner which leads from Bentinck Street on to the Welbeck Street crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. I sprang for the foot-path and saved myself by the fraction of a second. The van dashed round by Marylebone Lane and was gone in an instant. I kept to the pavement after that, Watson, but as I walked down Vere Street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses and was shattered to fragments at my feet. I called the police and had the place examined. There were slates and bricks piled up on the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. Of course I knew better, but I could prove nothing. I took a cab after that and reached my brother\x{2019}s rooms in Pall Mall, where I spent the day. Now I have come round to you, and on my way I was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. I knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but I can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth I have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, I daresay, working out problems upon a black-board ten miles away. You will not wonder, Watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that I have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door.\x{201d}",
