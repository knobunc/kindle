Never let a hog of the howth trample underfoot your linen of Killiney. Never play lady\x{2019}s game for the Lord\x{2019}s stake. Never lose your heart away till you win his diamond back. Make a strong point of never kicking up your rumpus over the scroll end of sofas in the Dar Bey Coll Cafeteria by tootling risky apropos songs at commercial travellers\x{2019} smokers for their columbian nights entertainments the like of White limbs they never stop teasing or Minxy was a Manxmaid when Murry wore a Man. And, by the bun, is it you goes bisbuiting His Esaus and Cos and then throws them bag in the box? Why, the tin\x{2019}s nearly empty. First, thou shalt not smile. Twice, thou shalt not love. Lust, thou shalt not commix idolatry. Hip confiners help compunction. Never park your brief stays in the men\x{2019}s convenience. Never clean your buttoncups with your dirty pair of sassers. Never ask his first person where\x{2019}s your quickest cut to our last place. Never let the promising hand usemake free of your oncemaid sacral. The soft side of the axe!

Wet your thistle where a weed is and you\x{2019}ll rue it, despyneedies. Especially beware, please, of being at a party to any demoralising home life. That saps a chap.

Leg-before-Wicked lags-behind-Wall where here Mr Whicker whacked a great fall. Femorafamilla feeled it a candleliked but Hayes, Conyngham and Erobinson sware it\x{2019}s an egg. Forglim mick aye! Stay, forestand and tillgive it! Remember the biter\x{2019}s bitters I shed the vigil I buried our Harlotte Quai from poor Mrs Mangain\x{2019}s of Britain Court on the feast of Marie Maudlin. Ah, who would wipe her weeper dry and lead her to the haltar? Sold in her heyday, laid in the straw, bought for one puny petunia. Moral: if you can\x{2019}t point a lily get to henna out of here! Put your swell foot foremost on foulardy pneumonia shertwaists, irriconcilible with true fiminin risirvition, and ribbons of lace, limenick\x{2019}s disgrace.

Stick wicks in your earshells when you hear the prompter\x{2019}s voice. Look on a boa in his beauty and you\x{2019}ll nevermore wear your strawberry leaves. Rely on the relic.

Hold, flay, grill, fire that laney feeling for kosenkissing dysgenically within the proscribed limits like Population Peg on a hint or twin clandestinely does be doing to Temptation Tom. Atkings questions in barely and snakking svarewords like a nursemagd. While there\x{2019}s men-a\x{2019}-war on the say there\x{2019}ll be loves-o\x{2019}-women on the do. Love through the usual channels, cisternbrothelly, when properly disinfected and taken neat in the generable way upon retiring to roost in the company of a husband-in-law or other respectable relative of an apposite sex, not love that leads by the nose as I foresmellt but canalised love, you understand, does a felon good, suspiciously if he has a slugger\x{2019}s liver. But I cannot belabour the point too ardently (and after the lessions of experience I speak from inspiration) that fetid spirits is the thief of prurities, so none of your twenty rod cherrywhisks, me daughter, at the Cat and Coney or the Spotted Dog. When the night\x{2019}s in May and the moon shines might. And at <<2|9:1>> bis Lot\x{2019}s Road. When parties get tight for each other they lose all respect together.

We won\x{2019}t meeth in Navan till you try to give the Kellsfireclub the goby. Hill or hollow, Hull or Hague! And beware how you dare of wet cocktails in Kildare or the same may see your wedding driving home from your wake. Mades of ashens when you flirt spoil the lad but spare his shirt! Lay your lilylike long his shoulder but buck back if he butts bolder and just hep your homely hop and heed no horning. But if you\x{2019}ve got some brainy notion to raise cancan and rouse commotion I\x{2019}ll be apt to flail that tail for you till it\x{2019}s borning.

Ridewheeling that acclivisciously up windy Rutland Rise and insighting rebellious northers in the saunter of the city of Dunlob. Then breretonbiking on the free with your airs of gobe-dee and your heels upon the handlebars. Berrboell brazenness! No, before your corselage rib is decartilaged, that is to mean, if you have visceral ptosis, my point is, making allowances for the facts of your weak abdominal wall and your liver asprawl, vinvin, vinvin, or should you feel, in shorts, as though you needed healthy physicking exorcise to flush your kidneys, you understand, and move that twelfinger bowel and threadworm inhibitating it, lassy, and perspire freely, why, lict your lector in the lobby and out you go by the ostiary on to the dirt track and skip! Be a sportive. Deal with Nature, the great greengrocer, and pay regular by the monthlies. Your Punt\x{2019}s Perfume\x{2019}s only in the hatpinny shop beside the reek of the rawney. It\x{2019}s more important than air\x{2014}I mean than eats\x{2014}air (oop, I never open momouth but I pack mefood in it) and promotes that natural emotion. Stamp out bad eggs. Why so many puddings prove disappointing, as Dietician says in Creature Comforts Causeries, and why so much soup is so muck slop. If we could fatten on the elizabeetons we wouldn\x{2019}t have teeth like the hippopotamians. However. Likewise if I were in your unvelope shirt I\x{2019}d keep my weathereye well cocked open for your furnished lodgers paying for their feed on tally with company and piano tunes. Only stuprifying yourself!

And our local busybody, talker-go-bragk? Worse again! Off of that praying fan on to them priars! It would be a whorable state of affairs altogether for the red columnists of presswritten epics, Peter Paragraph and Paulus Puff (I\x{2019}m keepsoaking them to cover my concerts), to get ahold of for their balloons and shoot you private by surprise, considering the marriage slump that\x{2019}s on this oil age and pulexes three shillings a pint and wives at <<six|9c:1>> and <<seven|91:1>> when domestic calamities belame par and newlaids bellow mar for the twenty two toosent time thwealthy took thousands in the slack march of civilisation, were you, becoming guilty of unleckylike intoxication, to have and to hold, to pig and to pay, direct connection, qua intervener, with a prominent married member of the vicereeking squad and, in consequence of the hereinunder subpenas, be flummoxed to the second degree by becoming a detestificated companykeeper on the dammymonde of Lucalamplight.

            "So gullaby, me poor Isley! But I\x{2019}m not for forgetting me innerman monophone for I\x{2019}m leaving my darling proxy behind for your consolering, lost Dave the Dancekerl, a squamous runaway and a dear old man pal of mine too. He will arrive incessantly in the fraction of a crust. Could he quit doubling and stop trippling, he would be the unicorn of his kind. He\x{2019}s the mightiest penumbrella I ever flourished on behond the shadow of a post! Be sure and link him, me O treasauro, as often as you learn, provided there\x{2019}s nothing between you but a plain deal table. Only don\x{2019}t encourage him to cry lessontimes over Leperstown. But soft! Can\x{2019}t be? Do mailstanes mumble? Lumtum lumtum! Now! The froubadour! I fremble! Talk of wolf in a stomach, by all that\x{2019}s verminous! Eccolo me! The return of th\x{2019}athlate! Who can secede to his success! Isn\x{2019}t Jaunstown, Ousterrike, the small place after all? I knew I smelt the garlic leek! Why, bless me swits, here he its, darling Dave, like the catoninelives just in time as if he fell out of space, all draped in mufti, coming home to mourn mountains from his old continence. And not on one foot either or on two feet aether but on quinquisecular cycles after his French evolution and a blindfold passage by the <<4.32|5a:1>> with the pork\x{2019}s pate in his suicide paw and the gulls laughing lime on his natural skunk, blushing like Pat\x{2019}s pig, begob! He\x{2019}s not too timtom well ashamed to carry out onaglibtograbakelly in his showman\x{2019}s sinister the testymonicals he gave his twenty annis for, showing the three white feathers, as a home cured emigrant in Paddyouare far below on our sealevel. Bearer may leave the church, signed, Figura Porca, Lictor Magnaffica. He\x{2019}s the sneaking likeness of us, faith, me altar\x{2019}s ego in miniature and every Auxonian aimer\x{2019}s ace as nasal a Romeo as I am, for ever cracking quips on himself, that merry, the jeenjakes, he\x{2019}d soon arise mother\x{2019}s roses mid bedewing tears under those wild wet lashes onto anny living girl\x{2019}s laftercheeks. That\x{2019}s his little veiniality. And his impeppeppediment. He has novel ideas, I know, and he\x{2019}s a jarry queer fish betimes, I grant you, and cantanberous, the poisoner of his word, but, lice and all and semicoloured stainedglasses, I\x{2019}m enormously full of that foreigner, I\x{2019}ll say I am! Got by the one goat, suckled by the same nanna, one twitch, one nature makes us oldworld kin. We\x{2019}re as thick and thin now as two tubular jawballs. I hate him about his patent henesy, blasph it, yet am I amorist. I love him. I love his old portugal\x{2019}s nose. There\x{2019}s the nasturtium for ye now that saved manny a poor sinker from water on the grave. The diasporation of all pirates and quinconcentrum of a fake like Basilius O\x{2019}Cormacan MacArty? To camiflag he turned his shirt. Isn\x{2019}t he after borrowing all before him, making friends with everybooby, red in Rossya, white in Alba, and touching every distinguished Ourishman he could ever distinguish before or behind from a Yourishman for the customary halp of a crown and peace? He is looking aged with his pebbled eyes, and johnnythin too from livicking on pidgins\x{2019} ifs with puffins\x{2019} ands. He\x{2019}s been slanderising himself, but I pass no remark. Hope he hasn\x{2019}t the cholera. Give him an eyot in the farout. Moseses and Noasies, how are you? He\x{2019}d be as snug as Columbsisle Jonas wrocked in the belly of the whaves, as quotad before. Brayvo, senior chief! Famose! Sure there\x{2019}s nobody else in touch anysides to hold a chef \x{2019}s cankle to the darling at all for sheer dare with that prisonpotstill of Spanish breans on him like the knave of trifles! A jollytan fine demented brick and the prince of goodfilips! Dave knows I have the highest of respect of annyone in my oweand smooth way for that intellectual debtor (obbligato!) Mushure David R. Crozier. And we\x{2019}re the closest of chems. Mark my use of you, cog! Take notice how I yemploy, crib! Be ware as you I foil, coppy! It\x{2019}s a pity he can\x{2019}t see it for I\x{2019}m terribly nice about him. Canwyll y Cymry, the marmade\x{2019}s flamme! A leal of the O\x{2019}Looniys, a Brazel aboo! The most omportent man! Shervos! Ho, be the holy snakes, someone has shaved his rough diamond skull for him as clean as Nuntius\x{2019} piedish! The burnt out mesh and the matting and all! Thunderweather, khyber schinker, escapa sansa pagar! He\x{2019}s the spatton spit, so he is, scaly skin and all, with his blackguarded eye and the goatsbeard in his buttinghole, of Shemuel Tulliver, me grandsourd, the old cruxader, when he off with his paudeen! That was to let the crowd of Flu Flux Fans behind him see me proper. Ah, he\x{2019}s very thoughtful and sympatrico that way, is Brother Intelligentius, when he\x{2019}s not absintheminded, with his Paris adresse! He is, really. Hold hard till you\x{2019}ll ear him clicking his bull\x{2019}s bones! Some toad klakkin! You\x{2019}re welcome back, Wilkins, to red berries in the frost! And here\x{2019}s the butter exchange to pfeife and dramn ye with a bawlful of the Moulsaybaysse and yunker doodler wanked to wall awriting off his phoney. I\x{2019}m tired hairing of you. Hat yourself! Give us your dyed dextremity here, frother, the Claddagh clasp! I met with dapper dandy and he shocked me big the hamd. Where\x{2019}s your watchkeeper? You\x{2019}ve seen all sorts in shapes and sizes, marauding about the mappamound. How\x{2019}s the cock and the bullfight? And old Auster and Hungrig? And the Beer and Belly and the Boot and Ball? Not forgetting the oils of grease under that turkey in julep and Father Freeshots Feilbogen in his rockery garden with the costards? And did you meet with Peadhar the Grab at all? And did you call on Tower Geesyhus? Was Mona, my own love, no bigger than she should be, making up to you in her bestbehaved manor when you made your breastlaw and made her, tell me? And did you like the landskip from Lambay? I\x{2019}m better pleased than ten guidneys! You rejoice me! Faith, I\x{2019}m proud of you, french davit! You\x{2019}ve surpassed yourself! Be introduced to yes! This is me aunt Julia Bride, your honour, dying to have you languish to scandal in her bosky old delltangle. You don\x{2019}t reckoneyes him? He\x{2019}s Jackot the Horner who boxed in his corner, jilting no fewer than three female bribes. That\x{2019}s his penals. Shervorum! You haven\x{2019}t seen her since she stepped into her drawoffs. Don\x{2019}t be shoy, husbandman! Weih, what\x{2019}s on you, wifewoman? Up the shamewauch! She has plenty of woom in the smallclothes for the bothsforus, nephews push! Hatch yourself well! Come on, spinister, do your stuff! Would you wait biss she buds till you bite on her? Embrace her bashfully by all means at my frank incensive and tell her in your semiological agglutinative yez like boyrun to sibster how Idos be asking after her. Let us be holy and evil and let her be peace on the bough. Sure, she fell in line with our tripertight photos as the lyonised mails when we were stablelads together like the corksagain brothers, hungry and angry, cavileer grace by roundhered force, me and you, shinners true, and pinchme, our tertius quiddus, that never talked or listened. Always raving how we had the wrinkles of a snailcharmer and the slits and sniffers of a fellow that fell foul of the county de Loona and the meattrap of the first vegetarian. To be had for the asking. Have a hug! Take her out of poor tuppenny luck before she goes off in pure treple licquidance. I\x{2019}d give three shillings a pullet to the canon for the conjugation to shadow you kissing her from me liberally all over as if she was a crucifix. Enjombyourselves thurily. It\x{2019}s good for her bilabials, you understand. There\x{2019}s nothing like the mistletouch for finding a queen\x{2019}s earring false. Chink chink. As the curly bard said after kitchin the womn in his hym to the hum of her garments. You try a little tich to the tissle of his tail. The racist to the racy, rossy. The soil is for the self alone. Be ownkind. Be kithkinish. Be bloodysibby. Be irish. Be inish. Be offalia. Be hamlet. Be the property plot. Be Yorick and Lankystare. Be cool. Be mackinamucks of yourselves. Be finish. No martyr where the preature is there\x{2019}s no plagues like rome. It gives up the gripes. Watch the swansway. Take your tiger over it. The leady on the lake and the convict of the forest. Why, they might be Babau and Momie! Yipyip! To pan! To pan! To tinpinnypan. All folly me yap to Curlew! Give us a pin for her and we\x{2019}ll call it a tossup. Can you reverse positions? Let\x{2019}s have a fuchu all round, courting cousins! Quuck, the duck of a woman, for quack, the drake of a man, her little live apples for Leas and love potients for Leos, the next beast king. Put me down for all ringside seats. I can feel you being corrupted. Recoil. I can see you sprouting scruples. Get back. And as he\x{2019}s boiling with water I\x{2019}ll light your pyre. Turn about, skeezy Sammy, out of metaphor, till we feel are you still tropeful of popetry. Told you so. If you doubt of his love of dare airing his feelings you\x{2019}ll very much hurt, for Mischmasch mastufractured on europe you can read off the tail of his. Rip ripper rippest and jac jac jac. Dwell on that, my hero and lander! That\x{2019}s the side that appeals to em, the wring wrong way to wright woman. Shuck her! Let him! What he\x{2019}s good for. Shuck her more! Let him again! All she wants! Could you wheedle a staveling encore out of your imitationer\x{2019}s jubalharp, hey, Mr Jinglejoys? Congregational singing. Rota rota ran the pagoda con dio in capo ed il diavolo in coda. Many a diva devoutchka saw her Dauber Dan at the priesty pagoda Rota ran. Uck! He\x{2019}s so sedulous to singe always if prumpted, the mirthprovoker! Grunt unto us, I pray, your foreboden article in our own dear dockandoilish introducing the death of Nelson with coloraturas! Coraio, fra! And I\x{2019}ll string seconds to hermanise. My loaf and pottage neaheaheahear Rochelle. With your dumpsey diddeley dumpsey die, fiddeley fa. Diavoloh! Or come on, schoolcolours, and we\x{2019}ll scrap, rug and mat, and then be as chummy as two bashed spuds. Bitrial bay holmgang or betrayal buy jury. Attaboy! Fee gate has Heenan hoity, mind uncle Hare? What, sir? Poss, myster? Achieve! Thou thou? What say ye? Taurus periculosus, morbus pediculosus. Miserere mei in miseribilibus! There\x{2019}s uval lunguage for you! The tower is precluded, the mob\x{2019}s in her petticoats, Mr R. E. Meehan is in misery with his billyboots. Begob, there\x{2019}s not so much green in his Ireland\x{2019}s eye! Sweet fellow ovocal, he stones out of stune. But he could be near a colonel with a voice like that. The bark is still there but the molars are gone. The misery billyboots I used to lend him before we split! Be the hole in the year, they were laking like heaven\x{2019}s reflexes. But I told him make your will be done and go to a general and I\x{2019}d pray confessions for him. Areesh! Areesh! And I\x{2019}ll be your intrepider. Ambras! Ruffle her! Bussing was before the blood and bissing will behind the curtain. Triss! Did you note that worrid expressionism on his megalogue? A full octavium below me! And did you hear his three browrings rattlemaking when he was preaching to himself? And (whoa!) do you twig the schamlooking leaf greeping ghastly down his blousyfrock? Our national umbloom! Areesh! He won\x{2019}t. He\x{2019}s shoy. Those worthies, my old faher\x{2019}s onkel that was garotted, Caius Cocoa Codinhand, that I lost in a crowd, used to chop that tongue of his, japlatin, with my younkle\x{2019}s owlseller, Woowoolfe Woodenbeard, that went stonebathered, in the Tower of Balbus, as brisk, man, as I\x{2019}d scoff up muttan chepps and lobscouse. But it\x{2019}s all deafman\x{2019}s duff to me, begob. Sam knows miles bettern me how to work the miracle. And I see by his diarrhio he\x{2019}s dropping the stammer out of his silenced bladder since I bonded him off more as a friend and as a brother to try and grow a muff and canonise his dead feet down on the river airy by thinking himself into the fourth dimension and place the ocean between his and ours, the churchyard in the cloister of the depths, after he was capped out of beurlads scoel for the sin against the past participle and earned the jactitation for codding chaplain and of being as homely gauche as swift, B.A.A. Who gets twickly fullgets twice as allemanden huskers. But the whacker his word the weaker our ears for auracles who parles parses orileys oreill. Illstarred punster, lipstering cowknucks. \x{2019}Twas the quadra sent him and trinity too. And he can cantab as chipper as any oxon ever I mood with. A tiptoe singer! He\x{2019}ll prisckly soon handtune your Erin\x{2019}s ear for you, p.p. a mimograph at a time, numan bitter, with his ancomartinns to read the road roman with false steps ad Pernicious from rhearsilvar ormolus to torquinions superbers while I\x{2019}m far away from wherever thou art, serving my tallyhos and tullying my hostilious, by going in by the most holy recitatandas ffffor my varsatile examinations in the ologies, to be a coach on the Fukien mission. !

In the beginning was the geste, he jousstly says, for the end is with woman, flesh-without-word, while the man to be is in a worse case after than before since she on the supine satisfies the verb to him. Toughtough, tootoological. Thou, the first person shingeller. Art, an imperfect subjunctive. Paltry, flappent, haud serious. Miss Smith, onamatter-poetic. Hamnisandwis axes colles waxes warmas like sodullas. So pick your stops with fondness now. And mind you twine the twos noods of your nice-names. And pull up your furbelovs as farabove as you\x{2019}re farthingales. That\x{2019}ll hint him how to click the trigger. Show you shall and wont he will! His hearing is indoubting just as my seeing is onbelieving. So dactylise him up to blankpoint and let him blink for himself where you speak the best ticklish. You\x{2019}ll feel what I mean.

Under law\x{2019}s marshall and warschouw did I thole till lead\x{2019}s plumbate, ping on pang, reliefed me. I made praharfeast upon acorpolous and fastbroke down in Neederthorpe.

For sleeking beauties I spinned their nightinveils, to slumbred beasts I tummed the tief air.

In the humanity of my heart I sent out heywheywomen to refresh the ballwearied and then, doubling megalopolitan poleetness, my great great greatest of these charities, devaleurised the base fellows for the curtailment of their lower man: with a slog to square leg I sent my boundary to Botany Bay and I ran up a score and four of mes while the Yanks were huckling the Empire: I have been reciping om omominous letters and widelysigned petitions full of pieces of pottery about my monumentalness as a thingabolls and I have been inchanting causeries to the feshest cheoilboys so that they are allcalling on me for the song of a birtch.

Only but, there\x{2019}s a but, you must buy me a fine new girdle too, nolly. When next you go to Market Norkwall.

Hot and hairy, hugon, is your hand! Here\x{2019}s where the falskin begins. Smoos as an infams. One time you told you\x{2019}d been burnt in ice. And one time it was chemicalled after you taking a lifeness. Maybe that\x{2019}s why you hold your hodd as if. And people thinks you missed the scaffold. Of fell design. I\x{2019}ll close me eyes. So not to see. Or see only a youth in his florizel, a boy in innocence, peeling a twig, a child beside a weenywhite steed. The child we all love to place our hope in for ever. All men has done something. Be the time they\x{2019}ve come to the weight of old fletch. We\x{2019}ll lave it. So. We will take our walk before in the timpul they ring the earthly bells. In the church by the hearseyard. Pax goodmens will. Or the birds start their treestirm shindy. Look, there are yours off, high on high! And, cooshes, sweet good luck they\x{2019}re cawing you, Coole! You see, they\x{2019}re as white as the riven snae. For us. Next peaters\x{2019} poll you will be elicted or I\x{2019}m not your elicitous bribe. The Kinsella woman\x{2019}s man will never reduce me. A MacGarath O\x{2019}Cullagh O\x{2019}Muirk MacFewney sookadoodling and sweepacheeping round the lodge of Fjorn na Galla of the Trumpets! It\x{2019}s like potting the po to shambe on the dresser or tamming Uncle Tim\x{2019}s Caubeen on to the brows of a Viker Eagle. Not such big strides, huddy foddy! You\x{2019}ll crush me antilopes I saved so long for. They\x{2019}re Penisole\x{2019}s. And the two goodiest shoeshoes. It is hardly a Knut\x{2019}s mile or seven, possumbotts. It is very good for the health of a morning. With Buahbuah. A gentle motion all around. As leisure paces. And the helpyourselftoastrool cure\x{2019}s easy. It seems so long since, ages since. As if you had been long far away. Afartodays, afeartonights, and me as with you in thadark. You will tell me some time if I can believe its all. You know where I am bringing you? You remember? When I ran berrying after hucks and haws. With you drawing out great aims to hazel me from the hummock with your sling. Oar cries. I could lead you there and I still by you in bed. Les go dutc to Danegreven, nos? Not a soul but ourselves. Time? We have loads on our hangs. Till Gilligan and Halligan call again to hooligan. And the rest of the guns, Sullygan eight, from left to right. Olobobo, ye foxy theagues! The moskors thought to ball you out. Or the Wald Unicorn\x{2019}s Master, Bugley Captain from the Naul, drawls up by the door with the Honourable Whilp and the Reverend Poynter and the two Lady Pagets of Tallyhaugh, Ballyhuntus, in their riddletight raiding hats for to lift a hereshealth to their robost, the Stag, evers the Carlton hart.

But you came safe through. Enough of that horner corner! And old mutthergoosip! We might call on the Old Lord, what do you say? There\x{2019}s something tells me. He is a fine sport. Like the score and a moighty went before him. And a proper old promnentory. His door always open. For a newera\x{2019}s day. Much as your own is. You invoiced him last Eatster so he ought to give us hockockles and everything. Remember to take off your white hat, ech? When we come in the presence. And say hoothoothoo, ithmuthisthy! His is house of laws. And I\x{2019}ll drop my graciast kertssey too. If the Ming Tung no go bo to me homage me hamage kow bow tow to the Mong Tang. Ceremonialness to stand lowest place be!

Aloof is enoof. We can take or leave. He\x{2019}s reading his ruffs. You\x{2019}ll know our way from there, surely? Flura\x{2019}s way. Where once we led so many car couples have follied since. Clatchka! Giving Shaughnessy\x{2019}s mare the hillymount of her life. With her strulldeburgghers! Hnmn hnmn! The rollcky road adondering. We can sit us down on the heathery benn, me on you, in quolm unconsciounce. To scand the arising. Out from Drumleek. It was there Evora told me I had best. If I ever. When the moon of mourning is set and gone. Over Glinaduna. Lonu nula. Ourselves, oursouls alone. At the site of salvocean. And watch would the letter you\x{2019}re wanting be coming may be. And cast ashore. That I prays for be mains of me draims. Scratching it and patching at with a prompt from a primer. And what scrips of nutsnolleges I pecked up be meself. Every letter is a hard but yours sure is the hardest crux ever. Hack an axe, hook an oxe, hath an ans, heth hithences. But once done, dealt and delivered, tattat, you\x{2019}re on the map. Based on traumscrapt from Maston, Boss. After rounding his world of ancient days. Carried in a caddy or screwed and corked. On his mugisstosst surface. With a bob, bob, bottledby. Blob. When the waves give up yours the soil may for me. Sometime then, somewhere there, I wrote me hopes and buried the page when I heard Thy voice, ruddery dunner, so loud that none but, and left it to lie till a kissmess coming. So content me now. Lss. Unbild and be buildn our bankaloan cottage there and we\x{2019}ll cohabit respectable. The Gowans, ser, for Medem, me. With acute bubel runtoer for to pippup and gopeep where the sterres be. Just to see would we hear how Jove and the peers talk. Amid the soleness. Tiltop, bigmaster! Scale the summit! You\x{2019}re not so giddy now any more. All your graundplotting and the little it brought! Humps, when you hised us, and dumps, when you doused us! But sarra one of me cares a brambling ram, pomp porteryark! On limpidy marge I\x{2019}ve made me hoom. Park and a pub for me. Only don\x{2019}t start your stunts of Donachie\x{2019}s yeards agoad. I could guessp to her name who tuckt you that one, tufnut! Bold bet backwords. For the loves of sinfintins! Before the naked universe. And the bailby pleasemarm rincing his eye! One of these fine days, lewdyculler, you must redoform again. Blessed shield Martin! Softly so. I am so exquisitely pleased about the love-leavest dress I have. You will always call me Leafiest, won\x{2019}t you, dowling? Whordherfhull Ohldhbhoy! And you won\x{2019}t urbjunk to me parafume, oiled of kolooney, with a spot of marashy. Sm! It\x{2019}s Allpine Smile from Yesther late Yhesters. I\x{2019}m in everywince nasturtls. Even in Houlth\x{2019}s nose. Medeurscodeignus! Astale of astoun. Grand old marauder! If I knew who you are! When that hark from the air said it was Captain Finsen makes cumhulments and was mayit pressing for his suit I said are you there here\x{2019}s nobody here only me. But I near fell off the pile of samples. As if your tinger winged ting to me hear. Is that right what your brothermilk in Bray bes telling the district you were bragged up by Brostal because your parents would be always tumbling into his foulplace and losing her pentacosts after drinking their pledges? Howsomendeavour, you done me fine! The only man was ever known could eat the crushts of lobsters. Our native night when you twicetook me for some Marienne Sherry and then your Jermyn cousin who signs hers with exes and the beardwig I found in your Clarksome bag. Pharaops you\x{2019}ll play you\x{2019}re the king of Aeships. You certainly make the most royal of noises. I will tell you all sorts of makeup things, strangerous. And show you to every simple storyplace we pass. Cadmillersfolly, Bellevenue, Wellcrom, Quid Superabit, villities valleties. Change the plates for the next course of murphies! Spendlove\x{2019}s still there and the Canon going strong and so is Claffey\x{2019}s habits endurtaking and our parish pomp\x{2019}s a great warrent. But you\x{2019}ll have to ask that same four that named them that is always snugging in your barsalooner, saying they\x{2019}re the best relicts of Conal O\x{2019}Daniel and writing Finglas Since the Flood. That\x{2019}ll be some kingly work in progress. But it\x{2019}s by this route he\x{2019}ll come some morrow. And I can signal you all flint and fern are rasstling as we go by. And you\x{2019}ll sing thumb a bit and then wise your selmon on it. It is all so often and still the same to me. Snf? Only turf, wick dear! Clane turf. You\x{2019}ve never fogodden batt on tarf, have you, at broin burroow, what? Mch? Why, them\x{2019}s the muchrooms, come up during the night. Look, agres of roofs in parshes. Dom on dam, dim in dym. And a capital part for olympics to ply at. Steadyon, Cooloosus! Mind your stride or you\x{2019}ll knock. While I\x{2019}m dodging the dustbins. Look what I found! A lintil pea. And look at here! This cara weeseed. Pretty mites, my sweetthings, was they poorloves abandoned by wholawidey world? Neighboulotts for newtown. The Eblanamagna you behazyheld loomening up out of the dumblynass. But the still sama sitta. I\x{2019}ve lapped so long. As you said. It fair takes. If I lose my breath for a minute or two don\x{2019}t speak, remember! Once it happened, so may it again. Why I\x{2019}m all these years within years in soffran, allbeleaved. To hide away the tear, the parted. It\x{2019}s thinking of all. The brave that gave their. The fair that wore. All them that\x{2019}s gunne. I\x{2019}ll begin again in a jiffey. The nik of a nad. How glad you\x{2019}ll be I waked you! My! How well you\x{2019}ll feel! For ever after. First we turn by the vagurin here and then it\x{2019}s gooder. So side by side. Turn agaze, weddingtown! Laud, men of Londub! I only hope whole the heavens sees us. For I feel I could near to faint away. Into the deeps. Annamores leep. Let me lean, just a lea, if you le, bowldstrong bigtider. Allgearls is wea. At times. So. While you\x{2019}re adamant evar. Wrhps, that wind as if out of norewere! As on the night of the Apophanypes. Jumpst shootst throbbst into me mouth like a bogue and arrohs! Ludegude of the Lashlanns, how he whips me cheeks! Sea, sea! Here weir, reach, island, bridge. Where you meet I. The day. Remember! Why there that moment and us two only? I was but teen, a tiler\x{2019}s dot. The swankysuits was boosting always, sure him, he was like to me fad. But the swaggerest swell off Shackvulle Strutt. And the fiercest freaky ever followed a pining child round the sluppery table with a forkful of fat. But a king of whistlers. Scieoula! When he\x{2019}d prop me atlas against his goose and light our two candles for our singers duohs on the sewingmachine. I\x{2019}m sure he squirted juice in his eyes to make them flash for flightening me. Still and all he was awful fond to me. Who\x{2019}ll search for Find Me Colours now on the hillydroops of Vikloefells? But I read in Tobecontinued\x{2019}s tale that while blubles blows there\x{2019}ll still be sealskers. There\x{2019}ll be others but none so for me. Yed he never knew we seen us before. Night after night. So that I longed to go to. And still with all. One time you\x{2019}d stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of branches for to fan me coolly. And I\x{2019}d lie as quiet as a moss. And one time you\x{2019}d rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black shadow, with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I\x{2019}d frozen up and pray for thawe. Three times in all. I was the pet of everyone then. A princeable girl. And you were the pantymammy\x{2019}s Vulking Corsergoth. The invision of Indelond. And, by Thorror, you looked it! My lips went livid for from the joy of fear. Like almost now. How? How you said how you\x{2019}d give me the keys of me heart. And we\x{2019}d be married till delth to uspart. And though dev do espart. O mine! Only, no, now it\x{2019}s me who\x{2019}s got to give. As duv herself div. Inn this linn. And can it be it\x{2019}s nnow fforvell? Illas! I wisht I had better glances to peer to you through this baylight\x{2019}s growing. But you\x{2019}re changing, acoolsha, you\x{2019}re changing from me, I can feel. Or is it me is? I\x{2019}m getting mixed. Brightening up and tightening down. Yes, you\x{2019}re changing, sonhusband, and you\x{2019}re turning, I can feel you, for a daughterwife from the hills again. Imlamaya. And she is coming. Swimming in me hindmoist. Diveltaking on me tail. Just a whisk brisk sly spry spink spank sprint of a thing theresomere, saultering. Saltarella come to her own. I pity your oldself I was used to. Now a younger\x{2019}s there. Try not to part! Be happy, dear ones! May I be wrong! For she\x{2019}ll be sweet for you as I was sweet when I came down out of me mother. My great blue bedroom, the air so quiet, scarce a cloud. In peace and silence. I could have stayed up there for always only. It\x{2019}s something fails us. First we feel. Then we fall. And let her rain now if she likes. Gently or strongly as she likes. Anyway let her rain for my time is come. I done me best when I was let. Thinking always if I go all goes. A hundred cares, a tithe of troubles and is there one who understands me? One in a thousand of years of the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little warm tricks. And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it\x{2019}s all! And me letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time. I thought you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You\x{2019}re only a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in glory. You\x{2019}re but a puny. Home! My people were not their sort out beyond there so far as I can. For all the bold and bad and bleary they are blamed, the seahags. No! Nor for all our wild dances in all their wild din. I can see meself among them, allaniuvia pulchrabelled. How she was handsome, the wild Amazia, when she would seize to my other breast! And what is she weird, haughty Niluna, that she will snatch from my ownest hair! For \x{2019}tis they are the stormies. Ho hang! Hang ho! And the clash of our cries till we spring to be free. Auravoles, they says, never heed of your name! But I\x{2019}m loothing them that\x{2019}s here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending! I\x{2019}ll slip away before they\x{2019}re up. They\x{2019}ll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it\x{2019}s old and old it\x{2019}s sad and old it\x{2019}s sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms. I see them rising! Save me from those therrble prongs! Two more. Onetwo moremens more. So. Avelaval. My leaves have drifted from me. All. But one clings still. I\x{2019}ll bear it on me. To remind me of. Lff! So soft this morning, ours. Yes. Carry me along, taddy, like you done through the toy fair! If I seen him bearing down on me now under whitespread wings like he\x{2019}d come from Arkangels, I sink I\x{2019}d die down over his feet, humbly dumbly, only to washup. Yes, tid. There\x{2019}s where. First. We pass through grass behush the bush to. Whish! A gull. Gulls. Far calls. Coming, far! End here. Us then. Finn, again! Take. Bussofthlee, mememormee! Till thousendsthee.

            "This dismissal rests on considering the portmanteau in its singularity, as an isolated verbal play without syntactic context. Context is all in \x{2018}Jabberwocky\x{2019} and in most of Finnegans Wake, as it has to be in English, a language in which meaning derives from word position more than from inflections. \x{2018}Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe\x{2019} ought to make sense as a grammatical construction even though the vocabulary is not part of the English lexicon. The same can be said a fortiori of \x{2018}riverrun, past Eve and Adam\x{2019}s, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodious vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle & Environs\x{2019} (FW2, <<3.01|9p>>-3). Once sentence structure rather than vocabulary is accepted as normative, variant becomes more usable and error acceptable. If the opening and closing of Finnegans Wake read \x{2018}shore of swerve\x{2019} or \x{2018}swerve shore of\x{2019} instead of \x{2018}swerve of shore\x{2019} then the regulatory function of word order could be called on to question the reading.",

            "The second exemplar for the Wake (or at least its method) could be Dr Seuss\x{2019}s Oh, the Thinks You Can Think. The \x{2018}thinks\x{2019} are, in Milton\x{2019}s phrase, \x{2018}things unimagined yet in prose or rime\x{2019} and include \x{2018}snuvs and their gloves\x{2019} and \x{2018}Schlopp. Schlopp. Beautiful schlopp. Beautiful schlopp with a cherry on top.\x{2019} Again, sentence structure can be used as a corrective even though the vocabulary is, at best, incipient and lacks the conflation of Carroll and Joyce. Children love the strange and even disturbing challenge of Seussian vocabulary. This experimentation by Seuss and his child readers is demonstrated at both syntactic and morphological level in Kornei Chukovski\x{2019}s From <<Two to Five|10a:0>>, where some of the linguistic formulations made by children not yet fully constrained by the grammatical or semantic rules of adult language could very well be the products of Dr Seuss or James Joyce, especially when Joyce himself co-opts the language of children\x{2019}s verse as the linguistic base for his puns: \x{2018}This liggy piggy wanted to go to the jampot. And this leggy peggy spelt pea\x{2019} (FW2, 385.24-5). Even the neologistic title of the Seuss book is prefigured in a phrase that encapsulates the basic linguistic technique of Finnegans Wake: \x{2018}two thinks at a time\x{2019} (FW2, 454.06-7).",
