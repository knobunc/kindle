midnight|13>> I think, I got the bottle of Scotch from my father\x{2019}s liquor cabinet, and I started drinking. The liquor did not stop the noise in my head, but the buzz of the alcohol helped drown
out the nagging voices that told me about how badly I was behaving, about how ashamed my father would be to see me. I turned on the television and idly flipped from station to station, never
lingering beyond the first commercial, until only one station remained on the air, playing old movies until dawn.",

about anyone. I had been drinking with her only because I could not stand being alone. I was twenty-six years old, and it seemed wrong to sit alone drinking beer after beer. But at <<six|9c:1>>, when the
