Pedestrians running for shelter into the market and under the portico of St. Paul\'s Church, where there are already several people, among them a lady and her daughter in evening dress. They are all peering out gloomily at the rain, except one man with his back turned to the rest, who seems wholly preoccupied with a notebook in which he is writing busily.',

The double doors are in the middle of the back hall; and persons entering find in the corner to their right two tall file cabinets at right angles to one another against the walls. In this corner stands a flat writing\x{2013}table, on which are a phonograph, a laryngoscope, a row of tiny organ pipes with a bellows, a set of lamp chimneys for singing flames with burners attached to a gas plug in the wall by an indiarubber tube, several tuning\x{2013}forks of different sizes, a life\x{2013}size image of half a human head, showing in section the vocal organs, and a box containing a supply of wax cylinders for the phonograph.",

There is a Chippendale chair further back in the room between her and the window nearest her side. At the other side of the room, further forward, is an Elizabethan chair roughly carved in the taste of Inigo Jones. On the same side a piano in a decorated case. The corner between the fireplace and the window is occupied by a divan cushioned in Morris chintz.
It is between <<four|90>> and <<five in the afternoon|5>>.
The door is opened violently; and Higgins enters with his hat on.",
