            "But for the same reasons you shouldn\x{2019}t put much faith in doctor report cards, a comparison like this is highly deceptive. Two doctors in the same ER are likely to treat very different pools of patients. The average patient at <<noon|13>>, for instance, is about ten years older than one who comes in the middle of the night. Even two doctors working the same shift might see very different patients, based on their skills and interests. It is the triage nurse\x{2019}s job to match patients and doctors as best as possible. One doc may therefore get all the psychiatric cases on a shift, or all the elderly patients. Because an old person with shortness of breath is much more likely to die than a thirty-year-old with the same condition, we have to be careful not to penalize the doctor who happens to be good with old people.",

            "Thanks to the nature of the emergency room, there is another sort of de facto, accidental randomization that can lead us to the truth. The key is that patients generally have no idea which doctors will be working when they arrive at the ER. Therefore, the patients who show up between <<2:00|2>> and <<3:00 P.M.|2a>> on one Thursday in October are, on average, likely to be similar to the patients who show up the following Thursday, or the Thursday after that. But the doctors working on those three Thursdays will probably be different. So if the patients who came on the first Thursday have worse outcomes than the patients who came on the second or third Thursday, one likely explanation is that the doctors on that shift weren\x{2019}t as good.
