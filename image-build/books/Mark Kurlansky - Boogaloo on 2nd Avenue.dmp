            "\"Aayoych,\" said Eli, blending several Yiddish and American expletives. Then he got dressed and left, turning down Avenue A, which was already a bit redolent as the early summer heat cooked the trash on the street. Furniture was placed neatly along the garbage-strewn edges of sidewalks\x{2014}a special place where things were found and things were given away every day. The streetlamps in metallic paint were wrapped with paper flyers up to seven feet up the poles, like badly laid strudel dough, leaves dangling, advertisements for everything, some legal, including the exact time and place for demonstrations that had already been missed against every known form of repression. The trashy streets were occupied in shifts\x{2014}different people at different hours of the day The older people, such as Eli, were out first, beaten only by those who had spent the night on the sidewalk. Then the smarts, the new young people, walked quickly to the subways to their promising jobs in other neighborhoods. At <<eleven|9v>>, shaggy young people staggered out into the blinding sunlight looking as though they had spent the night with drugs and sex and not much food or sleep. But soon the smarts would be home from their jobs and the streets filled with the entire assortment.",

It was a fox-trot. Chow Mein would have called it a Jewish beat. <<One-two|9j:0>>, three and four. <<One-two|9j:0>>, three and four. Suddenly the rhythm changed. Somewhere under Manhattan in a dark and barely lit tunnel of rock, the train slowed and then stopped. Nathan felt the oxygen steadily depleting, as though movement had created the oxygen, the same way fish have to keep water moving through their gills to breathe. His heart was throbbing, reverberating through the thick cavities of his frail body, shaking him, thudding loudly enough for the other passengers to hear.",

The one on Fourth Street was still kosher but sold out by <<three in the afternoon|5>>, not because that many Jews had to have their challah kosher, but because the kosher bakery did not make many, on the assumption that few kosher people were left. Since all the kosher people knew this, they bought early. By <<three o\'clock|6>> the action shifted to the bakery on Seventh Street, which was not kosher but at least was Jewish. Once that bakery had sold its last loaf of braided egg bread, anyone who wanted challah had to resort to Chaim\'s. Chaim\'s was one of the oldest bakeries in the neighborhood, but several years earlier Chaim, having decided to spend his remaining years pondering a blue sea he never wanted to step into, had moved to Boca Raton and sold his bakery to an industrious Korean family.',
