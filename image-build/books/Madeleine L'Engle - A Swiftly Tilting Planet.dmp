            "I was kept hanging for two years. Over and over again I received nothing more than the formal, printed rejection slip. Eventually, <<after twenty-six|9:0>> rejections, I called my agent and said, \x{201c}Send it back. It\x{2019}s too different. Nobody\x{2019}s going to publish it.\x{201d} He sent it back, but a few days later a friend of my mother\x{2019}s insisted that I meet John Farrar, the publisher. He liked the manuscript, and eventually decided to publish it. My first editor was Hal Vursell.",

            "Meg\x{2019}s mother-in-law was also silent, but that was not surprising. What was surprising was that she had agreed to come to them for Thanksgiving dinner. Mrs. O\x{2019}Keefe must have been no more than a few years older than Mrs. Murry, but she looked like an old woman. She had lost most of her teeth, and her hair was yellowish and unkempt, and looked as if it had been cut with a blunt knife. Her habitual expression was one of resentment. Life had not been kind to her, and she was angry with the world, especially with the Murrys. They had not expected her to accept the invitation, particularly with Calvin in London. None of Calvin\x{2019}s family responded to the Murrys\x{2019} friendly overtures. Calvin was, as he had explained to Meg at their first meeting, a biological sport, totally different from the rest of his family, and when he received his M.D./Ph.D. they took that as a sign that he had joined the ranks of the enemy. And Mrs. O\x{2019}Keefe shared the attitude of many of the villagers that Mrs. Murry\x{2019}s two earned Ph.D.s, and her experiments in the stone lab which adjoined the kitchen, did not constitute proper work. Because she had achieved considerable recognition, her puttering was tolerated, but it was not work, in the sense that keeping a clean house was work, or having a <<nine-to-five|10a:0>> job in a factory or office was work.",
