The F\x{fc}hrer looks seriously and meditatively into the dark sky that has followed a refreshing thunderstorm. With raised hand he returns to the enthusiastic greetings of the people of the Rheinland \x{2026} In this hour he is more than ever admired by us. Not a quiver in his face reveals the slightest sign of what is going on within him. Yet we few people who stand by him in all difficult hours know how deeply he is grieved and also how determined to deal mercilessly in stamping out the reactionary rebels who are trying to plunge the country into chaos, and breaking their oath of loyalty to him under the slong of carrying out a \x{2018}Second Revolution.\x{2019}\x{201d}",

Lanny noticed the curious fact that not once did the little dwarf name one of the victims of the purge; he didn\x{2019}t even say directly that anybody had been killed! As a specimen of popular fiction there was something to be said for his effusion, but as history it wouldn\x{2019}t rank high. Lanny could nail one falsehood, for he knew that Hugo Behr had been shot at <<a few minutes after nine|10>> on Friday evening, which was at least three hours before the F\x{fc}hrer had given his orders according to the Goebbels account. The jail buzzed with stories of other persons who had been killed or arrested <<before midnight|13>>; in fact some had been brought to this very place. Evidently somebody had given the fatal order while the F\x{fc}hrer was still inspecting labor camps.",

No use going to the place of appointment ahead of time, so Lanny read the morning papers in this town which had changed hands many times, but for the present was French. He read that Adolf Hitler had called an assembly of his tame Reichstag in the Kroll Opera House, and had made them a speech of an hour and a half, telling how he had suffered in soul over having to kill so many of his old friends and supporters. When he was through, he sat with head bowed, completely overcome, while G\x{f6}ring told the world how Hitler was the ordained F\x{fc}hrer who was incapable of making a mistake; to all of which they voted their unanimous assent.",

Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at <<noonday|13>>.
