It was delivered yesterday in an early S\x{e8}vres sucrier which had that lovely canary-coloured ground known as jonquille. \x{2018}From Suzie,\x{2019} the note said, \x{2018}and thank you.\x{2019} It is nice to be appreciated. And the honey was interesting. Suzie Jolibois had, among other things, a small farm south of Casablanca, and was fond of bees. Her hives were set in the midst of a plantation of cannabis indica, and the bees drew their nectar exclusively from this source. They lived, those bees, in a state of perpetual euphoria and were disinclined to work. The honey was therefore very scarce. I spread a third piece of toast. The stuff was almost black. It had a pungent aroma. The telephone rang. I put the receiver to my ear and waited. I never speak first when called. After all, I\x{2019}m not phoning them. They\x{2019}re phoning me.",

Somewhere around Sixty-second Street, I found a good florist\x{2019}s shop. There I bought a corsage of three massive orchid blooms all fastened together. The orchids were cattleyas, white and mauve splotches on them. They were particularly vulgar. So, undoubtedly, was Mrs Elvira Ponsonby.
