            "Maybe one of his minions gave a sign to those women, that fanatical band of old crones whose purpose in life was to oblige us in Colchis to live just as our ancestors had done, down to the smallest detail. We didn\x{2019}t take them seriously, that was a mistake; all at once there came into existence in Colchis a distribution of power that was favorable to those women, so that they believed their time had come. Delighted by the King\x{2019}s revival of the old laws, now they wanted to see them followed to all their conclusions, for only one of the two, the King or his proxy, could survive, and when it was <<midnight|13>> and your day as King ended, brother, they passed through an entrance that on that night, oddly enough, wasn\x{2019}t guarded\x{2014}as they, oddly enough, knew\x{2014}and burst into your chambers, where they were able to find you defenseless in your bath and kill you, singing their bloodcurdling songs all the while. Such was the custom in the olden days, to which we, too, had appealed because we thought they promised us an advantage. And ever since I shudder at the thought of those old days and the forces they released in us, forces we could then no longer control. At some point this killing of the proxy King, which everyone approved of, including the victim himself\x{2014}at some point this must have turned into murder, and if your fearful death has taught me anything, brother, it\x{2019}s that we can\x{2019}t deal with the fragments of the past any way we like, piecing them together or ripping them apart just to suit our convenience. And insofar as I didn\x{2019}t prevent that, and even promoted it, then to that extent I was an accomplice in your death. Agameda meant something else when she accused me recently, but I still turned pale. I blanch every time I think about you, brother, and about this death that drove me away from Colchis. Agameda has no idea. Hates me blindly. But why does she hate me. Why am I hated.",

            "Now I\x{2019}m tired, I\x{2019}ve hardly slept. The awful night of the festival has got itself into my bones. The day had passed smoothly, the goddess had been offered, with great ceremony, the choicest parts of the sacrificial animals, the bullocks\x{2019} testicles had been fastened to her image in three overlapping rows. I saw that Agameda was the only Colchian to have mingled successfully with the Corinthian girls whose office was to cleanse the testicles and affix them to the goddess\x{2019}s image, which they would then bear through the city streets as a promise of lasting fertility. While the bullocks\x{2019} horns were being secured to the walls of the temple and a fire kindled on the sacrificial mound to roast the victims\x{2019} flesh, the people passed the time with dancing, singing, and clowning. Presbon had prepared some festival productions the likes of which had never been seen in Corinth, he was sending out over the festival grounds waves of costumed performers meant to recall to the Corinthians\x{2019} memories the glorious deeds of the past, he was stoking a mood that turned into rage when, shortly before dark, two breathless men came rushing up from the city, members of the watch, as one could tell from their clothing. They brought the news that a group of prisoners, using weapons that had been smuggled in to them, had broken out of their dungeon and, taking advantage of the empty streets, forced their way into some of the richest graves over in the necropolis and plundered them. After a deadly silence, a howl that had been awaiting its opportunity for a long time burst out among the revelers. Then what had to happen happened. The crowd began searching for victims to slake their thirst for revenge. They swayed irresolutely here and there, I thought with horror about the few Colchian women who had followed me to the festival, but they weren\x{2019}t the ones the Corinthians went for. They remembered the prisoners who had come to the temple seeking sanctuary from the tyranny of their masters and performed menial tasks there, that was enough of that, they should atone for the misdeeds of the others. I rushed to the doorway of the temple, implored the frightened priestesses, for the most part quite young girls from the better families, not to let this happen, to bar the temple doors and brace a wooden beam against them. They obeyed me because no one else was there to give them orders, the crowd hammered against the doors, I crept out of the temple through the secret passage behind the altar and tried to make people listen to me. I said that it was forbidden to desecrate the goddess\x{2019}s holy day, I shouted into their wide-open mouths, their hate-distorted faces, I thought that only through a fear greater than their rage could I overcome their thirst for blood; then an old man with a weathered, craggy face approached me and shook his fists at me. The ancestors had brought the goddess human sacrifices, he said, they were greatly to her liking, why shouldn\x{2019}t the people go back to the old ways. The crowd bellowed its agreement, I had lost. They began insulting me, crowding in on me, let them do it, I thought, if it has to be, then let it be now, let it be here. They had already broken through the great doors of the temple, the priestesses had fled, the frightened prisoners were crouching near the altar, many hands clutched at them. I had been pushed into the temple along with the crowd, they pressed me forward so that all at once I was standing face-to-face with the ringleader, a coarse fellow who was ostentatiously rejoicing. What do you have to say now, he bellowed, and I said quietly: Take only one. Only <<one|9k:0>>, he bellowed, why should we. I said, Even your ancestors would present only one chosen human victim to the goddess as a sacrifice, more would be a gross sacrilege, murder in the temple is punished most severely. They seemed astonished, hesitated, began to confer in whispers. The old man who had first spoken to me was to decide, he gave himself a few airs, at last he nodded. They pulled a man out of the pack of prisoners, he defended himself furiously, he screamed and pleaded, appealed to his right to find refuge in the temple, he was a great hulking person with a shaved skull and a dense, curly beard, I\x{2019}ll never be able to forget his face, his bloodshot eyes that were turned on me. They dragged him to the altar, I didn\x{2019}t turn away, I saw the coarse fellow cut his throat. The blood, human blood, ran down into the altar gutters.",
