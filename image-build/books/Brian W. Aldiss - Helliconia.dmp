This widens the range of temperatures within climatic zones.
The atmospheric composition varied slightly from pre-capture to post-capture. A greater amount of carbon dioxide in the air, pre-capture, produced a mean temperature of \x{2013} 7\x{b0}C. After capture, and at periastron (when Star B and planets are at their closest to Star A), some of this atmospheric CO2 combined with water to form carbonate rocks.",

The Earth\x{2013}Avernus method of reckoning Helliconian years is simply to date them After Apastron (AA). On Helliconia itself, various nations have, at various times, their own means of reckoning calendar time. Generally, such calendars begin from the start of the reign of a local despot.",
