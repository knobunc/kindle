OED points out that the literary currency of this sense stemmed from Theobald\x{2019}s emendation of \x{2018}luscious woodbine\x{2019} in A Midsummer Night\x{2019}s Dream II. 1.251 to \x{2018}lush woodbine\x{2019}, a reading adopted by Johnson. Woodhouse, however, glossed the meaning as \x{2018}deep coloured\x{2019}, and his note on To a Friend who Sent me some Roses 3 (\x{2018}From his lush clover covert\x{2019}) reads, \x{2018}full-coloured \x{2013} in opposition to faint-coloured\x{2019} (Woodhouse [1817], pp. 141, 149). This sense, which is recorded in Johnson\x{2019}s Dictionary, stemmed from Hanmer\x{2019}s explanation of \x{2018}lush\x{2019} in The Tempest II. <<1.52|5a:0>> as \x{2018}of a dark deep Colour, opposite to pale, faint\x{2019} (Shakespeare\x{2019}s Works [1774] VI). It is probable that Woodhouse is right about this instance: compare the \x{2018}lush laburnum\x{2019} here with \x{2018}the dark-leaved laburnum\x{2019}s drooping clusters\x{2019} (To George Felton Mathew 41).

The variant line, often accepted as the final reading, comes from Woodhouse\x{2019}s objections to the Keatsian \x{2018}feel of not to feel it\x{2019} (see K C I, p. 64).

            "Date uncertain, but probably December 1817. Published Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century (1896). Text here is based on Charles Brown\x{2019}s transcript rather than the holograph in the Huntington Library. In Philological Quarterly, XXXIV (1955), pp. 177\x{2013}88, A. Ward has shown that this hitherto obscure poem is a political satire upon the repressive measures taken by the Tory government to silence its critics in 1817. \x{2018}Daniel\x{2019} probably stands for William Hone (1780\x{2013}1842), who had attacked the government in parodies of the Catechism, the Creed, and the Litany. He was tried for blasphemous and seditious writings on 18\x{2013}20 December 1817, but defended himself brilliantly, pointing out that the employment of biblical parallels in political satire was nothing new, and citing several examples which had used the story of Daniel. Keats followed the trial with interest (L I, p. 191), as did Hunt in the Examiner, and Hone\x{2019}s acquittal was a liberal triumph. The poem is based on Daniel ii-iv, in which Nebuchadnezzar erects an image of gold, and suffers from nightmares. Daniel fearlessly interprets these dreams, which foretell the overthrow of Nebuchadnezzar\x{2019}s kingdom, for he is the \x{2018}head of gold\x{2019} (ii 38). In Keats\x{2019}s sonnet Nebuchadnezzar probably represents George III, while the \x{2018}valiant crew\x{2019} of \x{2018}loggerheads and chapmen\x{2019} (ll. <<10\x{2013}11|5a:0>> ) stands for the Tory ministry, who were terrified that the regime, maintained by force, might be overthrown by popular revolt. They have \x{2018}lying lips\x{2019} (l. 13) because they subvert the Constitutional liberties they are supposed to defend, but will be defeated by the truth voiced by Daniel (i.e. Hone). Keats also uses the image of the downfall of Babylon to prophesy the end of Tory tyranny in Endymion III, <<18\x{2013}21|5a:0>>. G and Allott mix readings from Brown\x{2019}s transcript and the draft (Texts, pp. 142\x{2013}3).",

At the time of its composition, Keats was confined to his rooms with a sore throat, and the subject, like that of its companion-piece The Eve of St Agnes, was probably suggested by Mrs Isabella Jones. The superstition is recounted in John Brand\x{2019}s Popular Antiquities (1813 edn) II, p. 166: \x{2018}It is customary in Yorkshire, as a clergyman of that county informed me, for the common people to sit and watch in the church porch on St Mark\x{2019}s Eve [24 April], from <<eleven o\x{2019}clock at night|6>> till <<one in the morning|5>>. The third year (for this must be done thrice), they are supposed to see the ghosts of all those who are to die next year, pass by into the church. When any one sickens that is thought to have been seen in this manner, it is presently whispered about that he will not recover, for that such, or such an one, who has watched St Mark\x{2019}s Eve, says so. This superstition is in such force, that, if the patients themselves hear of it, they almost despair of recovery. Many are said to have actually died by their imaginary fears on the occasion; a truly lamentable, but by no means incredible, instance of human folly.\x{2019}",

The Ode to Psyche assumes that Psyche is already a goddess, but the experiences described in the poem are drawn from her earlier meetings with Cupid, as they had been described in William Adlington\x{2019}s translation of Apuleius\x{2019}s The Golden Ass (1566). Adlington interprets the story as showing how Love (Cupid as Eros), hitherto mischievous, has been won over to the mind or soul, and Keats\x{2019}s Ode echoes verbal details of his description of Psyche\x{2019}s wanderings \x{2013} \x{2018}Thus poore Psyches being left alone, weeping and trembling on the toppe of the rocke, was blowne by the gentle aire and of shrilling Zephyrus, and caried from the hill with a meek winde, which retained her garments up, and little by little brought her downe into a deepe valley, where she was laid in a bed of most sweet and fragrant flowers. Thus faire Psyches being sweetly couched among the soft and tender hearbs, as in a bed of sweet and fragrant floures [compare ll. <<7\x{2013}15|5a:0>>], and having qualified the thoughts and troubles of her restlesse mind, was now well reposed. And when she had refreshed her selfe sufficiently with sleepe, she rose with a more quiet and pacified minde, and fortuned to espy a pleasant wood invironed with great and mighty trees. Shee espied likewise a running river as cleare as crystall: in the midst of the wood well nigh at the fall of the river was a princely Edifice, wrought and builded not by the art or hand of man [compare ll. 50\x{2013}62]\x{2019} (C. Whibley\x{2019}s reprint [1893], p. 102, of 1639 edn of Apuleius). In Apuleius, however, the \x{2018}princely Edifice\x{2019} is Cupid\x{2019}s palace, where Psyche is visited by her lover only at night. Psyche, who fears her lover may be a serpent, hides a burning lamp, intending to cut off his head, but when she sees Cupid she falls to her knees and he is woken by a drop of burning oil, and flees. Psyche then has to suffer a period of expiatory wandering, which includes a journey over the \x{2018}ridge\x{2019} of a \x{2018}mountain\x{2019} (see l. 55), and a trip to the underworld, before Cupid escapes through a \x{2018}window of the chamber where hee was inclosed\x{2019}, and successfully petitions Jupiter for Psyche\x{2019}s immortality.",

A drawing of the Sosibios Vase was made by Keats from Henry Moses\x{2019}s A Collection of Antique Vases, Altars, Paterae\x{2026} (1814), but the Townley and Borghese vases may also have influenced him. Further, see Jack, pp. 214\x{2013}24, 281\x{2013}9 (Plates XXIX-XXXVII reproduce the main influences, and Plate XXX reproduces Keats\x{2019}s drawing), and N. Machin, \x{2018}The Case of the Empty-handed Maenad\x{2019}, Observer Magazine (Colour Supplement), 28 February 1965. However, the heifer being led to sacrifice on the South Frieze of the Elgin Marbles probably supplied details for the fourth stanza (Jack, p. 219), and Wedgwood\x{2019}s reproductions of classical motifs and forms also played a part. For the latter, see D. E. Robinson\x{2019}s \x{2018}Ode on a \x{201c}New Etrurian Urn\x{201d} (A Reflection of Wedgwood Ware in the Poetic Imagery of John Keats)\x{2019}, KSJ, XII (1963), pp. 11\x{2013}35.

Brown later recorded, \x{2018}I engaged to furnish him with the fable, characters, and dramatic conduct of a tragedy, and he was to embody it into poetry. The progress of this work was curious; for, while I sat opposite to him, he caught my description of each scene, entered into the characters to be brought forward, the events, and every thing connected with it. Thus he went on, scene after scene, never knowing nor inquiring into the scene which was to follow, until <<four|9:0>> acts were completed. It was then he required to know, at once, all the events which were to occupy the fifth act. I explained them to him; but, after a patient hearing, and some thought, he insisted on it that my incidents were too numerous, and, as he termed them, too melodramatic. He wrote the fifth act in accordance with his own view\x{2019} (KC II, p. 66). Brown sent the completed tragedy to Drury Lane, where Charles Kean expressed an interest in the lead, though the play was turned down both there and at Covent Garden.

After an induction (I, <<1\x{2013}18|5a:0>>), The Fall of Hyperion deals with the nature of poetry and the poet the distinction between the poet and the dreamer and the problem of human suffering. At 1,294, Keats picks up the original narrative with the entry of Saturn and Thea, concluding with the appearance of Hyperion in Canto II. The movement from the pleasant garden (I, <<19\x{2013}46|5a:0>>) to the \x{2018}antichamber of this dream\x{2019} (I, 47-end) recalls the \x{2018}Chamber of Maiden-Thought\x{2019} which Keats had described a year earlier, in his letter to Reynolds of 3 May 1818: \x{2018}\x{2026} I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me \x{2013} The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think \x{2013} We remain there a long while\x{2026} but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle \x{2013} within us \x{2013} we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one\x{2019}s vision into the heart and nature of Man \x{2013} of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness and oppression \x{2013} whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken\x{2019}d and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open \x{2013} but all dark \x{2013} all leading to dark passages \x{2013} We see not the ballance of good and evil. We are in a Mist \x{2013} We are now in that state \x{2013} We feel the \x{201c}burden of the Mystery\x{201d}, To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote \x{201c}Tintern Abbey\x{201d}\x{2026}\x{2019} (L I, pp. 280\x{2013}81).",
