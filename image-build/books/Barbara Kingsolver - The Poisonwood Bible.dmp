            "We were presumed insane. Mother took the diagnosis well. She moved our things out of storage into a plywood cabin on the piney outskirts of town, which she rented on the strength of a tiny legacy from Grandfather Wharton. She did not hook up the telephone. She took up a hoe instead, and began to put every square inch of her sandy two-acre rented lot under cultivation: peanuts, sweet potatoes, and four dozen kinds of flowers. She seemed determined to grow tragedy out of herself like a bad haircut. A neighbor down the road had a mean goose and hogs, whose manure Mother toted home daily like a good African in two balanced bushel pails. It would not have surprised me to see her put a third bucket on her head. By midsummer we could not see out the windows for the foxglove and the bachelor\x{2019}s buttons. Mother said she aimed to set up a plank shack by the road and sell bouquets for <<three-fifty|5k:0>> apiece. I wondered what Bethlehem would say about that.

            "I shudder to think what Father would say to me here, skulking among a tribe of papist females. I pass the days as productively as I can: trying to stay clean, sharpen my aim, and keep my lip buttoned from <<Vespers|13>> till breakfast. Trying to learn the trick of what passes for patience. Every few weeks I get a letter from Leopoldville, which holds me on track. My heart races when I see the long blue envelope in a sister\x{2019}s hand, delivered to me under her sleeve as if a man himself were inside. And, oh, he is! Still sweet and bitter and wise and, best of all, still alive. I squeal, I can\x{2019}t help it, and run outside to the courtyard to taste him in private like a cat with a stolen pullet. I lean my face against the cool wall and kiss its old stones in praise of captivity, because it\x{2019}s only my being here and his being in prison that saves us both for another chance at each other. I know he despises being useless, sitting still while war overtakes us. But if Anatole were free to do as he pleased right now, I know he\x{2019}d be killed in the process. If captivity is damaging his spirit, I just hope for an intact body and will do what I can for the rest, later on.",

Opening up the bargaining table to a would-be congregation. I multiplied my perception of Anatole\x{2019}s intelligence by <<ten that day|5>>, and now looking back I have to do the same for everyone we knew. The children who hounded us daily for money and food weren\x{2019}t dim-witted beggars; they were accustomed to the distribution of excess, and couldn\x{2019}t fathom why we held ourselves apart. The chief who proposed to marry my sister surely didn\x{2019}t dream Father would actually hand over his whining termite! I think Tata Ndu was gently suggesting we\x{2019}d become a burden to his village in a time of near famine; that people here accommodate such burdens by rearranging families; and that if we found such an idea impossible we were perhaps better off somewhere else. Tata Ndu certainly had his arrogance in the ways of command, even calling down a vote in church to humiliate my father, but in matters of life and death, I can see now, he was almost incomprehensibly polite.",

The big banana-tree leaves grow right up against the shack\x{2019}s filthy back window, leaving narrow gaps perfect for spying. Mr. Axelroot himself is boring to watch; on a typical day he sleeps till <<noon|13>>, then takes a nap. You can just tell he isn\x{2019}t saved. But his clutter is fascinating: guns, tools, army clothes, even a radio of some kind, which he keeps in an army foot-locker. We can hear the faint static emanating from the trunk, and the spooky, distant voices speaking French and English. My parents told us there was not a radio within a hundred miles of our whole village (they wanted to get one for safety\x{2019}s sake, but neither the Mission League nor the Lord has so far provided). So they aren\x{2019}t aware of Mr. Axelroot\x{2019}s radio, and since I only learned of it through spying, I can\x{2019}t tell them about it.",
