            "At the end of the day, the two tactics work to secure fertilizations with a female under very different circumstances. Arriving slightly ahead of the females each day, a supermale first aggressively chases away all other males from a favored spot. Then he welcomes the females with vigorous vibrations of his pectoral fins and a few dashes up in the water column. A female impressed with both his location and his moves will join in one of these upward surges. The pair will swim almost belly to belly and simultaneously release their sperm and eggs into the upper waters. Successful TP males have been known to exceed 150 matings in a single day\x{2014}which is even more impressive given they don\x{2019}t spawn all twenty-four hours long\x{2014}these fish tend to be <<noontime|13>> lovers.",

            "Confined to an anemone, these fish are stuck with whoever else lives there. It\x{2019}s kind of like being forced to date only the girl or boy next door. But although there may be <<four to six|10a:0>> individuals living around one anemone, only the two largest individuals will mate: the one and only female with the largest male. And here\x{2019}s where being a BOFFFF comes in handy. Generally speaking, even a small male has enough sperm to fertilize all of a female\x{2019}s eggs. The more eggs the female can make, then, the more offspring the couple can produce. So a bigger female benefits them both. By starting off as a male, an individual that hooks up with a big female can produce lots of offspring when small, and then, when his older, bigger partner dies, he can then grow into the female role, get a new mate, and continue the high-level offspring output. This is what clownfish do, and this is why the real Nemo tale doesn\x{2019}t look anything like the movie.",

Then, one by one, each will join him in an upward spawning rush as the evening commences. It\x{2019}s quite romantic, as long as there aren\x{2019}t any other rusty angelfish harems around.

Looking at this ratio evens the playing field between, say, barnacles and blue whales, allowing for far more colorful comparisons. For example, a one-hundred-foot blue whale with a ten-foot penis has a penis-to-body ratio of <<about 1:10|2>>. People, on the other hand, come in at <<about 1:13|2>>, assuming average human penis length (erect or stretched out flaccid) is about five to six inches and assuming a six-foot-tall male. So blue whales have us beat, but not by much. Move into invertebrate territory, however, and it\x{2019}s a whole different ball game.",

            "There are other ways we can promote more natural conditions for sea life, especially along the coasts. A surge of projects to rebuild oyster reefs is one such example. From specially designed concrete blocks to bags packed with old oyster shell, new techniques to construct starter reefs help lift small oysters off the silty seafloor and provide a more attractive habitat on which wild oyster larvae can settle and grow. People with waterfront properties are joining \x{201c}oyster gardening\x{201d} efforts in which they hang bags of juvenile oysters off their docks, providing a protective way to grow young oysters to larger sizes, and then placing mature oysters out on restoration sites. Other ways folks are giving back to help oysters include shell recycling programs, such as those run by the Oyster Recovery Partnership in Maryland and the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana. Diners slurping back oysters at participating restaurants can rest assured valuable shells head back to the sea (rather than to the dump), where they can help build up reefs and attract new wild oysters to settle. In Maryland, businesses that recycle their shells can even collect a tax credit. In fact, Maryland now boasts claim to the largest restored oyster reef in the world, at <<330|9n:0>> acres. The approximately one billion oysters making up this reef were carefully cultivated in the lab, settled onto shells saved from the landfill, grown until they reached a large enough size, and then released back into the brine. They are part of an enormous effort to use oysters to clean up the pollution that is plaguing the once bountiful Chesapeake Bay.",
