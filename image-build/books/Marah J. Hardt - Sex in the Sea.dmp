Arriving slightly ahead of the females each day, a supermale first aggressively chases away all other males from a favored spot. Then he welcomes the females with vigorous vibrations of his pectoral fins and a few dashes up in the water column. A female impressed with both his location and his moves will join in one of these upward surges. The pair will swim almost belly to belly and simultaneously release their sperm and eggs into the upper waters. Successful TP males have been known to exceed 150 matings in a single day\x{2014}which is even more impressive given they don\x{2019}t spawn all twenty-four hours long\x{2014}these fish tend to be <<noontime|13>> lovers.",

But although there may be <<four to six|10a:0>> individuals living around one anemone, only the two largest individuals will mate: the one and only female with the largest male. And here\x{2019}s where being a BOFFFF comes in handy. Generally speaking, even a small male has enough sperm to fertilize all of a female\x{2019}s eggs. The more eggs the female can make, then, the more offspring the couple can produce. So a bigger female benefits them both. By starting off as a male, an individual that hooks up with a big female can produce lots of offspring when small, and then, when his older, bigger partner dies, he can then grow into the female role, get a new mate, and continue the high-level offspring output. This is what clownfish do, and this is why the real Nemo tale doesn\x{2019}t look anything like the movie.",

Looking at this ratio evens the playing field between, say, barnacles and blue whales, allowing for far more colorful comparisons. For example, a one-hundred-foot blue whale with a ten-foot penis has a penis-to-body ratio of <<about 1:10|2>>. People, on the other hand, come in at <<about 1:13|2>>, assuming average human penis length (erect or stretched out flaccid) is about five to six inches and assuming a six-foot-tall male.

These data show when the fish start to travel to the spawning site, where they come from, how long they stay, and where they go. In an effort to educate local communities about the importance of protecting this large spawning aggregation, the researchers work closely with local schools to educate children about this unique event in their home waters. Based in large part upon these efforts, in 2011 the Cayman Islands government extended the seasonal ban on fishing on Nassau grouper spawning sites\x{2014}current and historical locations\x{2014}for another eight years. Thus far, the ban seems to be working, with signs of recovery in the size of individual fish, new \x{201c}teenage\x{201d} fish showing up for their first spawns, and approximately double the number of fish since <<2003|3b:0>> when the ban first went into effect.",
