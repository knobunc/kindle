            "Gabra had been in a bad mood to begin with, and he had been stonily unamused by their story, but eventually Phil's enthusiasm\x{2014}he was back to thinking it had been a jolly adventure\x{2014}had swayed him, and he had begun to see the good side. A simple plan quickly evolved. Undercover law enforcement people in sufficiently disreputable-looking galabiyas would begin drifting into the caf\x{e9} at <<5 p.m.|5>>, an hour before the meeting with Ali Hassan, and station themselves at several tables. Gabra would be in a car a block away. As soon as Gideon came in and sat down with Hassan, the police would quietly appear at the table and it would be over before it began. No complicated sting operation, no money changing hands, nothing dangerous at all. Even Julie's mind had been put at ease.",

            "Clifford Haddon paused in mid-sentence, placed his glass of Scotch on the side table, and rose to shut the windows behind him. Even with them closed, the din was maddening. Eighteen years in Egypt and he had yet to get used to the unremitting noise. When he'd first started at Horizon House, the nights had been almost tolerable, but ever since some public-relations wunderkind had come up with those unspeakable sound-and-light shows at Karnak and Luxor Temple\x{2014}one three-quarters of a mile north of Horizon House, the other three-quarters of a mile south\x{2014}the racket along the Corniche was unending from morning till <<midnight|13>>.
