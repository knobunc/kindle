            "IT WAS, IN FACT, inconvenient for Mr. Parker to leave London. He had had to go and see Lady Levy towards the end of the morning, and subsequently his plans for the day had been thrown out of gear and his movements delayed by the discovery that the adjourned inquest of Mr. Thipps\x{2019}s unknown visitor was to be held that afternoon, since nothing very definite seemed forthcoming from Inspector Sugg\x{2019}s inquiries. Jury and witnesses had been convened accordingly for <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>>. Mr. Parker might altogether have missed the event, had he not run against Sugg that morning at the Yard and extracted the information from him as one would a reluctant tooth. Inspector Sugg, indeed, considered Mr. Parker rather interfering; moreover, he was hand-in-glove with Lord Peter Wimsey, and Inspector Sugg had no words for the interferingness of Lord Peter. He could not, however, when directly questioned, deny that there was to be an inquest that afternoon, nor could he prevent Mr. Parker from enjoying the inalienable right of any interested British citizen to be present. At <<a little before three|9c:1>>, therefore, Mr. Parker was in his place, and amusing himself with watching the efforts of those persons who arrived after the room was packed to insinuate, bribe or bully themselves into a position of vantage. The Coroner, a medical man of precise habits and unimaginative aspect, arrived punctually, and looking peevishly round at the crowded assembly, directed all the windows to be opened, thus letting in a stream of drizzling fog upon the heads of the unfortunates on that side of the room. This caused a commotion and some expressions of disapproval, checked sternly by the Coroner, who said that with the influenza about again an unventilated room was a death-trap; that anybody who chose to object to open windows had the obvious remedy of leaving the court, and further, that if any disturbance was made he would clear the court. He then took a Formamint lozenge, and proceeded, after the usual preliminaries, to call up fourteen good and lawful persons and swear them diligently to inquire and a true presentment make of all matters touching the death of the gentleman with the pince-nez and to give a true verdict according to the evidence, so help them God. When an expostulation by a woman juror\x{2014}an elderly lady in spectacles who kept a sweetshop, and appeared to wish she was back there\x{2014}had been summarily quashed by the Coroner, the jury departed to view the body. Mr. Parker gazed round again and identified the unhappy Mr. Thipps and the girl Gladys led into an adjoining room under the grim guard of the police. They were soon followed by a gaunt old lady in a bonnet and mantle. With her, in a wonderful fur coat and a motor bonnet of fascinating construction, came the Dowager Duchess of Denver, her quick, dark eyes darting hither and thither about the crowd. The next moment they had lighted on Mr. Parker, who had several times visited the Dower House, and she nodded to him, and spoke to a policeman. Before long, a way opened magically through the press, and Mr. Parker found himself accommodated with a front seat just behind the Duchess, who greeted him charmingly, and said: \x{201c}What\x{2019}s happened to poor Peter?\x{201d} Parker began to explain, and the Coroner glanced irritably in their direction. Somebody went up and whispered in his ear, at which he coughed, and took another Formamint.",

So I ran through some streets, and found myself in Goodge Street, and there I got a taxi and came home. I saw the account of the raid afterwards in the papers, and saw my friend had escaped, and so, as it wasn\x{2019}t the sort of thing I wanted made public, and I didn\x{2019}t want to get him into difficulties, I just said nothing.

            "I took him upstairs into the library, and switched on the centre light and the reading lamp on the writing table. I gave him a chair at the table with his back to the fire, and fetched the papers I had been faking, out of the safe. He took them, and began to read them, poking over them in his short-sighted way, while I mended the fire. As soon as I saw his head in a favourable position I struck him heavily with the poker, just over the fourth cervical. It was delicate work calculating the exact force necessary to kill him without breaking the skin, but my professional experience was useful to me. He gave one loud gasp, and tumbled forward on to the table quite noiselessly. I put the poker back, and examined him. His neck was broken, and he was quite dead. I carried him into my bedroom and undressed him. It was <<about ten minutes to ten|10>> when I had finished. I put him away under my bed, which had been turned down for the night, and cleared up the papers in the library. Then I went downstairs, took Levy\x{2019}s umbrella, and let myself out at the hall door, shouting \x{201c}Good-night\x{201d} loudly enough to be heard in the basement if the servants should be listening. I walked briskly away down the street, went in by the hospital side door, and returned to the house noiselessly by way of the private passage. It would have been awkward if anybody had seen me then, but I leaned over the back stairs and heard the cook and her husband still talking in the kitchen. I slipped back into the hall, replaced the umbrella in the stand, cleared up my papers there, went up into the library and rang the bell. When the man appeared I told him to lock up everything except the private door to the hospital. I waited in the library until he had done so, and <<about 10.30|9:1>> I heard both servants go up to bed. I waited a quarter of an hour longer and then went through to the dissecting-room. I wheeled one of the stretcher tables through the passage to the house door, and then went to fetch Levy. It was a nuisance having to get him downstairs, but I had not liked to make away with him in any of the ground-floor rooms, in case my servant should take a fancy to poke his head in during the few minutes that I was out of the house, or while locking up. Besides, that was a flea-bite to what I should have to do later. I put Levy on the table, wheeled him across to the hospital and substituted him for my interesting pauper. I was sorry to have to abandon the idea of getting a look at the latter\x{2019}s brain, but I could not afford to incur suspicion. It was still rather early, so I knocked down a few minutes getting Levy ready for dissection. Then I put my pauper on the table and trundled him over to the house. It was now <<five past eleven|10>>, and I thought I might conclude that the servants were in bed. I carried the body into my bedroom. He was rather heavy, but less so than Levy, and my Alpine experience had taught me how to handle bodies. It is as much a matter of knack as of strength, and I am, in any case, a powerful man for my height. I put the body into the bed\x{2014}not that I expected anyone to look in during my absence, but if they should they might just as well see me apparently asleep in bed. I drew the clothes a little over his head, stripped, and put on Levy\x{2019}s clothes, which were fortunately a little big for me everywhere, not forgetting to take his spectacles, watch and other oddments. At <<a little before half-past eleven|10>> I was in the road looking for a cab. People were just beginning to come home from the theatre, and I easily secured one at the corner of Prince of Wales Road. I told the man to drive me to Hyde Park Corner. There I got out, tipped him well, and asked him to pick me up again at the same place in an hour\x{2019}s time. He assented with an understanding grin, and I walked on up Park Lane. I had my own clothes with me in a suitcase, and carried my own overcoat and Levy\x{2019}s umbrella. When I got to No. 9A there were lights in some of the top windows. I was very nearly too early, owing to the old man\x{2019}s having sent the servants to the theatre. I waited about for a few minutes, and heard it strike the <<quarter past midnight|10>>. The lights were extinguished shortly after, and I let myself in with Levy\x{2019}s key.",

I put on my own boots and an old pair of goloshes outside the door. There was a thick Turkey carpet on the stairs and hall-floor, and I was not afraid of leaving marks. I hesitated whether to chance the banging of the front door, but decided it would be safer to take the latchkey. (It is now in the Thames. I dropped it over Battersea Bridge the next day.) I slipped quietly down, and listened for a few minutes with my ear to the letter-box. I heard a constable tramp past. As soon as his steps had died away in the distance I stepped out and pulled the door gingerly to. It closed almost soundlessly, and I walked away to pick up my cab. I had an overcoat of much the same pattern as Levy\x{2019}s, and had taken the precaution to pack an opera hat in my suitcase. I hoped the man would not notice that I had no umbrella this time. Fortunately the rain had diminished for the moment to a sort of drizzle, and if he noticed anything he made no observation. I told him to stop at 50 Overstrand Mansions, and I paid him off there, and stood under the porch till he had driven away. Then I hurried round to my own side door and let myself in.

He looked a bit out of place, so, not bein\x{2019} a shy girl, you see, she walked up to him, and said: \x{2018}Good-evening.\x{2019} \x{2018}Can you tell me, please,\x{2019} says the mysterious stranger, \x{2018}whether this street leads into Prince of Wales Road?\x{2019} She said it did, and further asked him in a jocular manner what he was doing with himself and all the rest of it, only she wasn\x{2019}t altogether so explicit about that part of the conversation, because she was unburdenin\x{2019} her heart to Sugg, d\x{2019}you see, and he\x{2019}s paid by a grateful country to have very pure, high-minded ideals, what? Anyway, the old boy said he couldn\x{2019}t attend to her just then as he had an appointment. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve got to go and see a man, my dear,\x{2019} was how she said he put it, and he walked on up Alexandra Avenue towards Prince of Wales Road. She was starin\x{2019} after him, still rather surprised, when she was joined by a friend of hers, who said: \x{2018}It\x{2019}s no good wasting your time with him\x{2014}that\x{2019}s Levy\x{2014}I knew him when I lived in the West End, and the girls used to call him Peagreen Incorruptible\x{2019}\x{2014}friend\x{2019}s name suppressed, owing to implications of story, but girl vouches for what was said. She thought no more about it till the milkman brought news this morning of the excitement at Queen Caroline Mansions; then she went round, though not likin\x{2019} the police as a rule, and asked the man there whether the dead gentleman had a beard and glasses. Told he had glasses but no beard, she incautiously said: \x{2018}Oh, then, it isn\x{2019}t him,\x{2019} and the man said: \x{2018}Isn\x{2019}t who?\x{2019} and collared her. That\x{2019}s her story. Sugg\x{2019}s delighted, of course, and quodded Thipps on the strength of it.\x{201d}",

I got that out of Sugg, too, though he was sittin\x{2019} tight on the information. Seems Thipps got into a confusion about the train he took back from Manchester. Said first he got home at <<10.30|9c:1>>. Then they pumped Gladys Horrocks, who let out he wasn\x{2019}t back till <<after 11.45|9f>>. Then Thipps, bein\x{2019} asked to explain the discrepancy, stammers and bungles and says, first, that he missed the train. Then Sugg makes inquiries at St. Pancras and discovers that he left a bag in the cloakroom there at <<ten|9b>>. Thipps, again asked to explain, stammers worse an\x{2019} says he walked about for a few hours\x{2014}met a friend\x{2014}can\x{2019}t say who\x{2014}didn\x{2019}t meet a friend\x{2014}can\x{2019}t say what he did with his time\x{2014}can\x{2019}t explain why he didn\x{2019}t go back for his bag\x{2014}can\x{2019}t say what time he did get in\x{2014}can\x{2019}t explain how he got a bruise on his forehead. In fact, can\x{2019}t explain himself at all. Gladys Horrocks interrogated again. Says, this time, Thipps came in at <<10.30|9c:1>>. Then admits she didn\x{2019}t hear him come in. Can\x{2019}t say why she didn\x{2019}t hear him come in. Can\x{2019}t say why she said first of all that she did hear him. Bursts into tears. Contradicts herself. Everybody\x{2019}s suspicion roused.

Accordingly, he plays a bold game of bluff. He invents an occasion on which the glasses may very easily have been lost or stolen, and applies for them. If confronted, nobody will be more astonished than he to learn where they were found. He will produce witnesses to prove that he left Victoria at <<5.45|9c:1>> and emerged from the train at Balham at the scheduled time, and sat up all Monday night playing chess with a respectable gentleman well known in Balham. In this case, the method of inquiry will be to pump the respectable gentleman in Balham, and if he should happen to be a single gentleman with a deaf housekeeper, it may be no easy matter to impugn the alibi, since, outside detective romances, few ticket-collectors and \x{2019}bus-conductors keep an exact remembrance of all the passengers passing between Balham and London on any and every evening of the week.",
