            "In January of 1971, the Fordham University Rams played a basketball game against the University of Massachusetts Redmen. The game was in Amherst, at the legendary arena known as the Cage, where the Redmen hadn\x{2019}t lost since December of 1969. Their record was 11\x{2013}1. The Redmen\x{2019}s star was none other than Julius Erving\x{2014}Dr. J\x{2014}one of the greatest athletes ever to play the game of basketball. The UMass team was very, very good. Fordham, on the other hand, was a team of scrappy kids from the Bronx and Brooklyn. Their center had torn up his knee the first week of practice and was out, which meant that their tallest player was six foot five. Their starting forward\x{2014}and forwards are typically almost as tall as centers\x{2014}was Charlie Yelverton, who was only six foot two. But from the opening buzzer, the Rams launched a full-court press, and they never let up. \x{201c}We jumped out to a <<thirteen-to-six|10a:0>> lead, and it was a war the rest of the way,\x{201d} Digger Phelps, the Fordham coach at the time, recalls. \x{201c}These were tough city kids. We played you ninety-four feet. We knew that sooner or later we were going to make you crack.\x{201d} Phelps sent in one indefatigable Irish or Italian kid from the Bronx after another to guard Erving, and, one by one, the indefatigable Irish and Italian kids fouled out. None of them were as good as Erving. It didn\x{2019}t matter. Fordham won 87\x{2013}79.",

There\x{2019}s no question that the latter is easier for the teacher: fewer papers to grade, fewer children to know and follow.
