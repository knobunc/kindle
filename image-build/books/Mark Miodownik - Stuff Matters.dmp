            "But this changed when, in 1903, an American businessman called King Camp Gillette decided to use the new cheap industrial steel produced by the Bessemer process to create a disposable razor. This was to be the democratization of shaving. His vision was to eliminate the need to sharpen the blade by making it so cheap that when it became blunt you could simply throw it away. In 1903 Gillette sold 51 razors and 168 blades. The following year, he sold 90,884 razors and 123,648 blades. By <<1915|9n:0>>, the corporation had established manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, England, France, and Germany, and razor blade sales exceeded seventy million. The disposable steel razor became a permanent fixture of every bathroom, and people stopped needing to go to the barber\x{2019}s for a shave. And it has remained so: while there are any number of back-to-basics movements in food production, no one wants to have their hair cut with a copper knife or their face shaved with a blunt razor.",

            'Tracking down the origin of such human errors can be tricky since, from the exterior, the concrete looks fine. The supervising engineer of the building of JFK Airport noticed through routine tests that the concrete arriving on trucks <<before noon|13>> had good strength when it set, but that arriving <<just after noon|10>> was substantially weaker. Puzzled, he investigated all possible reasons for this but was unable to find the answer until he resorted to following the truck delivering the concrete on its journey to the airport. He found that <<around noon|13>> the driver was in the habit of taking a break for lunch and would hose the concrete with water before doing so in the belief that adding extra water would keep the concrete liquid for longer.',

            'Everyone except one man, Kistler himself. He decided that the beauty and thermal insulation properties of these jelly skeletons were so extraordinary that they should and must have a future. Although silica aerogel is as fragile and brittle as glass, for its weight (which is minuscule), it has good strength, certainly enough to make it industrially useful. So he patented it and sold the license to manufacture it to a chemical company called Monsanto Corporation. By <<1948|9n:0>> it was making a product called Santogel, which was a powdered form of silica aerogel.',

            "Having collected the comet dust, the Stardust spacecraft returned to Earth, arriving back two years later. As it approached the Earth it veered away, jettisoning a Small capsule, which fell under Earth\x{2019}s gravity, entering the atmosphere at a speed of 12.9 kilometers per second, the fastest re-entry speed ever recorded, and so becoming for a while a shooting star itself. After fifteen seconds of free-fall, and having reached red-hot temperatures, the capsule deployed a drogue parachute to slow down the rate of descent. A few minutes later, at a height of ten thousand feet above the Utah desert, the capsule jettisoned the drogue chute and deployed the main parachute. At this point the recovery crews on the ground had a good idea of where the capsule was going to land and headed out into the desert to welcome it back from its seven-year, four-billion-kilometer round trip. The capsule hit the sand of the Utah desert at <<10:12|1a>> GMT on Sunday, January 15, 2006.",

            "Take a look at the graphite of a pencil and you will see that it is dark gray and shiny like a metal. For thousands of years it was mistaken for lead and was referred to as \x{201c}plumbago,\x{201d} or \x{201c}black lead,\x{201d} hence the use of the term \x{201c}lead\x{201d} to refer to the graphite used in a pencil. The confusion is understandable since they are both soft metals (although these days we call graphite a semi-metal). Plumbago mines became more and more valuable as new uses were found for graphite, such as the discovery that it was the perfect material to cast cannon and musket balls. In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Britain the material became so expensive that thieves took to digging secret tunnels into the mines, or working in the mines and secreting the plumbago about their person. As the price increased so did the smuggling and criminal activity until an act of Parliament was passed in 1752 that made the stealing of graphite from a mine a felony punishable by a year\x{2019}s hard labor or seven years\x{2019} transportation to Australia. By <<1800|9n:0>> graphite was such big business that armed guards were posted at the entrance to plumbago mines.",

            "Whatever the truth, it wasn\x{2019}t until <<1953|18:0>> that there was reliable documented evidence of such a transformation being achieved. Now the synthetic diamond industry is indeed big business, but it does not compete head to head with the natural diamond jewelry industry. There are a few reasons for this. The first is that although the industrial process has been mastered to the extent that small synthetic diamonds can be produced more cheaply than mining real ones, they are mostly colored and flawed, since the accelerated process of making them introduces defects which color the diamonds. In fact, the majority of these diamonds are used in the mining industry, where they embroider drills and cutting tools, not for aesthetic effect but to enable them to cut through granite and other hard rocks. Secondly, much of the value of diamonds is derived from their authenticity. It is important when proposing marriage that the diamond you offer, although physically identical to a synthetic one, was forged in the depths of the Earth a billion years ago. Thirdly, if you are the ultra-rational sort of person who does not care about the natural history of a gemstone, then buying a synthetic diamond is still a very expensive way to embellish your loved one. There are much cheaper lustrous substitutes that will glitter and dazzle and still fool anyone except a diamond expert, such as cubic zirconia crystals or even glass.",
