I told the papers, right out, that's what I done.\" He nodded, like a man agreeing with the obvious\x{2014}then glanced at Lanya, as though considering the new fact she brought. \"Now there's rape and there's rape.\" George's hands came free. \"You walking along one night and some guy jump\x{2014}\" George lunged, crouching\x{2014}\"out and grab you\x{2014}\" (Kidd, in the leaves, pulled back.)

Even though his pecker ain't touched you\x{2026} just dribbled on your handbag, like I say, see?\" George nodded and considered: \"And suppose some little girl who is seventeen years, three hundred and sixty-four days and <<twenty-three hours and fifty-five minutes|14>> old, she come up and say, 'Oh, honey, I want it so bad! Give it to me, give it to me, baby! Oh, please!'\" George's long head went back again, wobbling side to side. \"And she throw herself on the ground and pull down her panties and rubbing herself all up and down\x{2014}\" in a jogging crouch, he dragged his forearms up and down between his legs, pale nails on black fingers clawing toward the ground\x{2014} \"and moaning Oh, baby, do it to me, do it to me, I want it so bad! and you damn fool enough not to wait five minutes before you say\x{2014}\" George stood, punched the air\x{2014}\"Yeah, baby!\" Both hands went slowly back to his pockets. \"Well, that's rape too\x{2014}\"",

By dogs.\" That sounded funny, too; so he laughed. \"Yeah, I really was.\" He picked up his foot, rested it above his knee to examine the caked and calloused sole. The horny edge was cracked both sides. His ankle, knob and hollow, was grit-grey. Heel, ball, instep, and each dusty toe were gun-barrel black. He wiggled his toes: grit ground. \"I guess it was\x{2014}\" He looked up frowning\x{2014}\"maybe a couple of days ago\x{2014}\" and put his foot down. \"It was <<about three o'clock|6>>. In the morning. It was raining. No cars. So I took a nap on somebody's porch. <<About five|9e>>, when it was getting light, I went back out on the road to hitch. But it was still raining. So I figured, hell, I'd go back and catch another hour or two, 'cause there weren't any cars. Only when I got back, there was this damn dog, who'd been sleeping under the porch all the time I'd been snoozing topside. He was awake now. And he started barking. Then he chased my ass down to the road. I ran. He ran. My sandal broke and went into a ditch somewhere\x{2014}I just about didn't notice. While I was running, this old blue car pulled up\x{2014}big, old lady driving, with her skinny husband, and the back seat full of children. I jumped in out of the rain, and we drove right across the border, into Louisiana! They were all off to spend the day with some other kid of hers who was at some army base.\" He stepped from the sill. \"Bought me a good breakfast, too.\" The door creaked closed behind him. \"But I guess that's when I first noticed I couldn't remember my name. She asked me for it and I couldn't tell her\x{2026} But I don't think I've known it for a long, long time.\" And he was almost used to the light. \"I mean, you don't go around thinking about yourself by your own name, do you? Nobody does\x{2014}unless somebody calls to you by it, or asks you what it is. I haven't been around people who know me for\x{2026} for a while now. It's just something I haven't thought of for a long time, and somehow it's\x{2026} I guess just slipped my mind.\" He looked at the tops of his feet again, both filthy, one crossed with straps, one bare. \"It doesn't bother me.
