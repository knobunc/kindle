         from New Zealand invented a boron-based acid called a carborane, with a pH of \x{2013}18. To put that in perspective, water has a

         dropping one unit (e.g., from <<4 to 3|10a:0>>) boosts an acid\x{2019}s strength by ten times. So moving from stomach acid, at <<1|9:0>>, to the boron-based

         of their taste, so that apple cider vinegar tastes like apple cider, or Tabasco sauce like marinara. Miraculin does this both
         by muting the taste buds for sour and by bonding to the taste buds for sweet and putting them on hair-trigger alert for the
         stray hydrogen ions (H+) that acids produce. Along those same lines, people who accidentally inhale hydrochloric or sulfuric acid often recall their teeth aching as if they\x{2019}d been force-fed raw, extremely sour lemon slices. But as Gilbert Lewis proved,

         3.5 or drop from level 5 to level 1.8. Electrons jump only between whole-number levels. When excited electrons crash back
         down, they jettison excess energy as light, and because electron movement is so constrained, so too is the color of the light
         produced. It\x{2019}s monochromatic\x{2014}at least in theory. In practice, electrons in different atoms are simultaneously dropping from
         level <<3 to 1|10a:0>>, or <<4 to 2|10a:0>>, or whatever\x{2014}and every different drop produces a different color. Plus, different atoms emit light
         at different times. To our eyes, this light looks uniform, but on a photon level, it\x{2019}s uncoordinated and jumbled.",

         to the tenth floor and crashing back down. When this happens repeatedly, the second floor gets crowded; when there are more
         electrons on the second floor than the first, the laser has achieved \x{201c}population inversion.\x{201d} At this point, if any dawdling
         electrons do jump to the ground floor, they disturb their already skittish and crowded neighbors and knock them over the balcony,
         which in turn knocks others down. And notice the simple beauty of this: when the neodymium electrons drop this time, they\x{2019}re
         all dropping from <<two to one|10a:0>> at the same time, so they all produce the same color of light. This coherence is the key to a
         laser. The rest of the laser apparatus cleans up light rays and hones the beams by bouncing them back and forth between two
         mirrors. But at that point, the neodymium-yttrium crystal has done its work to produce coherent, concentrated light, beams
         so powerful they can induce thermonuclear fusion, yet so focused they can sculpt a cornea without frying the rest of the eye.",
