He sat huddled in a voluminous travelling coat of Continental origin, holding in his gloved hands a bundle of the day\x{2019}s papers. Because he was a precise man and did not care to be hurried, he had arrived thirty minutes before the train was due to depart. Still tired after the stresses of the previous night, when he had sat up talking with Ailsa Brimley until Heaven knew what hour, he was disinclined to read. Looking out of the window on to an almost empty station, he caught sight, to his great surprise, of Miss Brimley making her way along the platform, peering in at the windows, a carrier bag in her hand. He lowered the window and called to her.",

It appeared that on Wednesday evening Mr and Mrs Rode had been guests at dinner of Mr Terence Fielding, the senior housemaster at Carne and brother of the late Adrian Fielding, the celebrated French scholar who had vanished during the war while specially employed by the War Office. They had left Mr Fielding\x{2019}s house together at <<about ten to eleven|10>> and walked the half mile from the centre of Carne to their house, which stood alone at the edge of the famous Carne playing fields. As they reached their house Mr Rode remembered that he had left at Mr Fielding\x{2019}s house some examination papers which urgently required correction that night. (At this point Smiley remembered that he had failed to pack his dinner-jacket, and that Fielding would almost certainly ask him to dine.) Rode determined to walk back to Fielding\x{2019}s house and collect the papers, therefore, starting back at <<about five past eleven|10>>. It appears that Mrs Rode made herself a cup of tea and sat down in the drawing-room to await his return.",

The room was much warmer and at first Smiley wondered if someone had switched on the central heating in the middle of the night, after it had been off all day. Then he became aware of the sound of rain outside; he went to the window and parted the curtains. A steady rain was falling; by tomorrow the snow would be washed away. Two policemen walked slowly down the road; he could hear the squelch of their boots as they trod in the melting snow. Their wet capes glistened in the arc of the street lamp.',

            "\x{2018}Good Lord, I thought you knew! <<Half past eight|10>> last night Fielding rang us here. Perkins, his head boy, hadn\x{2019}t come back from a music lesson with Mrs Harlowe, who lives over to Longemede. We put out an alert and started looking for him. They sent a patrol car along the road he should have come back on \x{2013} he was cycling, you see. The first time they didn\x{2019}t see anything, but on the way back the driver stopped the car at the bottom of Longemede Hill, just where the water-splash is. It occurred to him the lad might have taken a long run at the water-splash from the top of the hill, and come to grief in the dip. They found him half in the ditch, his bike beside him. Dead.\x{2019}",

He would be coming up to London himself with some samples of a boy\x{2019}s handwriting and an examination paper; he would want the opinion of a handwriting expert. No, he would be coming by train on the <<4.25|3c>> from Carne, arriving at Waterloo at <<8.05|9c:1>>. Could a car be sent to the station to collect him? There was silence, then Rigby said testily, \x{2018}All right, I\x{2019}ll take a ruddy taxi,\x{2019} and rang off rather abruptly.

Most of us are old Carnians ourselves, in fact. Focused when we start. Rode wasn\x{2019}t, and Carne thrilled him. The very name Carne means quality, and Rode loved quality. His wife wasn\x{2019}t like that. She had her standards and they were different, but just as good. I used to watch Rode in the Abbey sometimes on Sunday mornings. Tutors sit at the end of pews, right by the aisle, you know. I used to watch his face as the choir processed past him in white and scarlet, and the Master in his doctor\x{2019}s robes and the Governors and Guardians behind him. Rode was drunk \x{2013} drunk with the pride of Carne. We\x{2019}re heady wine for the grammar school men, you know. It must have hurt him terribly that Stella wouldn\x{2019}t share any of that. You could see it did. The night they came to dinner with me, the night she died, they argued. I never told anyone, but they did. The Master had preached a sermon at <<Compline that evening|5>>: \x{201c}Hold fast to that which is good.\x{201d} Rode talked about it at dinner; he couldn\x{2019}t take much drink, you know, he wasn\x{2019}t used to it. He was full of this sermon and of the eloquence of the Master. She never came to the Abbey \x{2013} she went to that drab tabernacle by the station. He went on and on about the beauty of the Abbey service, the dignity, the reverence. She kept quiet till he\x{2019}d finished, then laughed, and said: \x{201c}Poor old Stan. You\x{2019}ll always be Stan to me.\x{201d} I\x{2019}ve never seen anyone so angry as he was then. He went quite pale.\x{2019}",
