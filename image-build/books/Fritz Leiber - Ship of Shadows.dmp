I know moonmist brings pains and sufferings as well as easings and joys. But suppose that every Workday morning and Loafday <<noon|13>> I should bring you a tiny pill that would give you all the good effects of moonmist and none of the bad. I\x{2019}ve one in this bag. Try it now and see. And every Playday night I would bring you without fail another sort of pill that would make you sleep soundly with never a nightmare. Much better than eyes and teeth.

His ears tickled Spar\x{2019}s throat. Spar was getting used to Kim\x{2019}s melodrama, and in any case the warning was hardly needed. He had just seen the half-dozen floating naked bodies and would have held still if only from embarrassment. Not that Spar could see genitals any more than ears at the distance. But he could see that save for hair, each body was of one texture: one very dark brown and the other five\x{2014}or was it <<four|9f>>? no, five\x{2014}fair. He didn\x{2019}t recognize the two with platinum and golden hair, who also happened to be the two palest. He wondered which was Crown\x{2019}s new girl, name of Almodie. He was relieved that none of the bodies were touching.",
