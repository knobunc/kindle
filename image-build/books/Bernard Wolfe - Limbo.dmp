With them, of course, they brought a recently developed ceremony named Mandunga. The second date could be given a little more exactly: October 19, 1972, at <<7:21 in the morning|2a>>.

That this was exactly two minutes after EMSIAC had begun to send out its red-flash alert to us about the impending attack. That, because the compartment of EMSIAC concerned with our flying hospital squadron was so heavily taxed at the moment with the problem of the alert, it did not have any circuits free to cope with the unauthorized flight of 17-M until several minutes later, just after the attack began. That finally, when its instructions to the pilot were ignored, EMSIAC at <<3:38|2>> took over the plane\x{2019}s automatic pilot, which had been set on steep climb and a southeast course, and fixed it on a half-turn, preparatory to returning it to base; at the same time, considering this breach of discipline a matter of the utmost urgency, it switched from ticker-tape communication to electrovox and began issuing oral instructions to the pilot to return for court-martial. (Judging from the coded records, EMSIAC was momentarily confused by 17-M\x{2019}s flight, an act of disobedience more flagrant than any it had so far encountered: two circuits backfired and blew before a course of action was decided upon, and it is clear that two or three times, when the electrovox began speaking, it stuttered.) That, a few moments before <<3:39|2>>, EMSIAC\x{2019}S self-protective batteries became aware that the EMSIAC receiving apparatus in 17-M was somehow being tampered with, that the container was being struck violently; the electrovox immediately assumed that the pilot of the runaway plane was attacking the communications system and began instructing him to desist, telling him that resistance was useless.
