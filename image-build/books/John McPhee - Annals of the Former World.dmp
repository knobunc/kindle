            "The poles of the earth have wandered. The equator has apparently moved. The continents, perched on their plates, are thought to have been carried so very far and to be going in so many directions that it seems an act of almost pure hubris to assert that some landmark of our world is fixed at 73 degrees 57 minutes and 53 seconds west longitude and 40 degrees 51 minutes and 14 seconds north latitude\x{2014}a temporary description, at any rate, as if for a boat on the sea. Nevertheless, these coordinates will, for what is generally described as the foreseeable future, bring you with absolute precision to the west apron of the George Washington Bridge. <<Nine A.M.|5>> A weekday morning. The traffic is some gross demonstration in particle physics. It bursts from its confining source, aimed at Chicago, Cheyenne, Sacramento, through the high dark roadcuts of the Palisades Sill. A young woman, on foot, is being pressed up against the rockwall by the wind booms of the big semis\x{2014}Con Weimar Bulk Transportation, Fruehauf Long Ranger. Her face is Nordic, her eyes dark brown and Latin\x{2014}the bequests of grandparents from the extremes of Europe. She wears mountain boots, blue jeans. She carries a single-jack sledgehammer. What the truckers seem to notice, though, is her youth, her long bright Norwegian hair; and they flirt by air horn, driving needles into her ears. Her name is Karen Kleinspehn. She is a geologist, a graduate student nearing her Ph.D., and there is little doubt in her mind that she and the road and the rock before her, and the big bridge and its awesome city\x{2014}in fact, nearly the whole of the continental United States and Canada and Mexico to boot\x{2014}are in stately manner moving in the direction of the trucks. She has not come here, however, to ponder global tectonics, although goodness knows she could, the sill being, in theory, a signature of the events that created the Atlantic. In the Triassic, when New Jersey and Mauretania were of a piece, the region is said to have begun literally to pull itself apart, straining to spread out, to break into great crustal blocks. Valleys in effect competed. One of them would open deep enough to admit ocean water, and so for some years would resemble the present Red Sea. The mantle below the crust\x{2014}exciting and excited by these events\x{2014}would send up fillings of fluid rock, and with such pressure behind them that they could intrude between horizontal layers of, say, shale and sandstone and lift the country a thousand feet. The intrusion could spread laterally through hundreds of square miles, becoming a broad new layer\x{2014}a sill\x{2014}within the country rock.",

            "The basin-range fault blocks in a sense are floating on the mantle. In fact, the earth\x{2019}s crust everywhere in a sense is floating on the mantle. Add weight to the crust and it rides deeper, remove cargo and it rides higher, exactly like a vessel at a pier. Slowly disassemble the Rocky Mountains and carry the material in small fragments to the Mississippi Delta. The delta builds down. It presses ever deeper on the mantle. Its depth at the moment exceeds twenty-five thousand feet. The heat and the pressure are so great down there that the silt is turning into siltstone, the sand into sandstone, the mud into shale. For another example, the last Pleistocene ice sheet loaded two miles of ice onto Scotland, and that dunked Scotland in the mantle. After the ice melted, Scotland came up again, lifting its beaches high into the air. Isostatic adjustment. Let go a block of wood that you hold underwater and it adjusts itself to the surface isostatically. A frog sits on the wood. It goes down. He vomits. It goes up a little. He jumps. It adjusts. Wherever landscape is eroded away, what remains will rise in adjustment. Older rock is lifted to view. When, for whatever reason, crust becomes thicker, it adjusts downward. All of this\x{2014}with the central image of the basin-range fault blocks floating in the mantle\x{2014}may suggest that the mantle is molten, which it is not. The mantle is solid. Only in certain pockets near the surface does it turn into magma and squirt upward. The temperature of the mantle varies widely, as would the temperature of anything that is two thousand miles thick. Under the craton, it is described as chilled. By surface standards, though, it is generally white hot, everywhere around the world\x{2014}white hot and solid but magisterially viscous, permitting the crust above it to \x{201c}float.\x{201d} Deffeyes was in his bathtub one Saturday afternoon thinking about the viscosity of the mantle. Suddenly he stood up and reached for a towel. \x{201c}Piano wire!\x{201d} he said to himself, and he dressed quickly and went to the library to look up a book on piano tuning and to calculate the viscosity of the wire. Just what he guessed\x{2014}1022 poises. Piano wire. Look under the hood of a well-tuned Steinway and you are looking at strings that could float a small continent. They are rigid, but ever so slowly they will sag, will slacken, will deform and give way, with the exact viscosity of the earth\x{2019}s mantle. \x{201c}And that,\x{201d} says Deffeyes, \x{201c}is what keeps the piano tuner in business.\x{201d} More miles, and there appears ahead of us something like a Christmas tree alone in the night. It is Winnemucca, there being no other possibility. Neon looks good in Nevada. The tawdriness is refined out of it in so much wide black space. We drive on and on toward the glow of colors. It is still far away and it has not increased in size. We pass nothing. Deffeyes says, \x{201c}On these roads, it\x{2019}s <<ten|9d:1>> to the minus five that anyone will come along.\x{201d} The better part of an hour later, we come to the beginnings of the casino-flashing town.

            "At the other end of the scale is the Holocene, the past ten thousand years, also called the Recent\x{2014}Cro-Magnon brooding beside the melting ice. (The Primitive and Secondary eras of eighteenth-century geology are long since gone from the vocabulary, but oddly enough the Tertiary remains. The term, which is in general use, embraces nearly all of the Cenozoic, from the Cretaceous Extinction to the end of the Pliocene, while the relatively short time that follows\x{2014}the Pleistocene plus the Holocene\x{2014}has come to be called the Quaternary. The moraines left by ice sheets are Quaternary, as are the uppermost basin fillings in the Basin and Range.) It was at some moment in the Pleistocene that humanity crossed what the geologist-theologian Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called the Threshold of Reflection, when something in people \x{201c}turned back on itself and so to speak took an infinite leap forward. Outwardly, almost nothing in the organs had changed. But in depth, a great revolution had taken place: consciousness was now leaping and boiling in a space of super-sensory relationships and representations; and simultaneously consciousness was capable of perceiving itself in the concentrated simplicity of its faculties. And all this happened for the first time.\x{201d} Friars of another sort\x{2014}evangelists of the environmental movement\x{2014}have often made use of the geologic time scale to place in perspective that great \x{201c}leap forward\x{201d} and to suggest what our reflective capacities may have meant to Mother Earth. David Brower, for example, the founder of Friends of the Earth and emeritus hero of the Sierra Club, has tirelessly travelled the United States delivering what he himself refers to as \x{201c}the sermon,\x{201d} and sooner or later in every talk he invites his listeners to consider the six days of Genesis as a figure of speech for what has in fact been four and a half billion years. In this adjustment, a day equals something like seven hundred and fifty million years, and thus \x{201c}all day Monday and until Tuesday <<noon|13>> creation was busy getting the earth going.\x{201d} Life began Tuesday <<noon|13>>, and \x{201c}the beautiful, organic wholeness of it\x{201d} developed over the next four days. \x{201c}At <<4 P.M.|5>> Saturday, the big reptiles came on. Five hours later, when the redwoods appeared, there were no more big reptiles. At <<three minutes before midnight|10>>, the human race appeared. At one-fourth of a second <<before midnight|13>>, Christ arrived. At <<one|9t:1>>-fortieth of a second <<before midnight|13>>, the Industrial Revolution began. We are surrounded with people who think that what we have been doing for that one-fortieth of a second can go on indefinitely. They are considered normal, but they are stark raving mad.\x{201d} Brower holds up a photograph of the world \x{2014}blue, green, and swirling white. \x{201c}This is the sudden insight from Apollo,\x{201d} he says. \x{201c}There it is. That\x{2019}s all. We see through the eyes of the astronauts how fragile our life really is.\x{201d} Brower has computed that we are driving through the earth\x{2019}s resources at a rate comparable to an automobile going a hundred and twenty-eight miles an hour\x{2014}and he says that we are accelerating.",

            "In like manner, geologists will sometimes use the calendar year as a unit to represent the time scale, and in such terms the Precambrian runs from New Year\x{2019}s Day until well after Halloween. Dinosaurs appear in the middle of December and are gone the day after Christmas. The last ice sheet melts on December 31st at <<one minute before midnight|10>>, and the Roman Empire lasts five seconds. With your arms spread wide again to represent all time on earth, look at one hand with its line of life. The Cambrian begins in the wrist, and the Permian Extinction is at the outer end of the palm. All of the Cenozoic is in a fingerprint, and in a single stroke with a medium-grained nail file you could eradicate human history. Geologists live with the geologic scale. Individually, they may or may not be alarmed by the rate of exploitation of the things they discover, but, like the environmentalists, they use these repetitive analogies to place the human record in perspective\x{2014}to see the Age of Reflection, the last few thousand years, as a small bright sparkle at the end of time. They often liken humanity\x{2019}s presence on earth to a brief visitation from elsewhere in space, its luminous, explosive characteristics consisting not merely of the burst of population in the twentieth century but of the whole residence of people on earth\x{2014}a single detonation, resembling nothing so much as a nuclear implosion with its successive neutron generations, whole generations following one another once every hundred-millionth of a second, temperatures building up into the millions of degrees and stripping atoms until bare nuclei are wandering in electron seas, pressures building up to a hundred million atmospheres, the core expanding at five million miles an hour, expanding in a way that is quite different from all else in the universe, unless there are others who also make bombs.",

            "It was dawn at the summit. We had been awake for hours and had eaten a roadhouse breakfast sitting by a window in which the interior of the room was reflected against the black of the morning outside while a television mounted on a wall behind us resounded with the hoofbeats of the great horse Silver. The Lone Ranger. <<Five A.M.|5>> CBS\x{2019}s good morning to Nevada. Waiting for bacon and eggs, I put two nickels in a slot machine and got two nickels back. The result was a certain radiance of mood. Deffeyes, for his part, was thinking today in troy ounces. It would take a whole lot more than two nickels to produce a similar effect on him. Out for silver, he was heading into the hills, but first, in his curiosity, he walked the interstate roadcut, now and again kicking a can. The November air was in frost. He seemed to be smoking his breath. He remarked that the mean distance between beer cans across the United States along I-80 seemed to be about one metre. Westward, tens of hundreds of square miles were etched out by the early light: basins, ranges, and\x{2014}below us in the deep foreground\x{2014}Paradise Valley, the village Golconda, sinuous stands of cottonwood at once marking and concealing the Humboldt. The whole country seemed to be steaming, vapors rising from warm ponds and hot springs. The roadcut was long, high, and benched. It was sandstone, for the most part, but at its lower, westernmost end the blasting had exposed a dark shale that had been much deformed and somewhat metamorphosed, the once even bedding now wrinkled and mashed\x{2014}rock folded up like wet laundry. \x{201c}You can spend hours doping out one of these shattered places, just milling around trying to find out what\x{2019}s going on,\x{201d} Deffeyes said cautiously, but he was fairly sure he knew what had happened, for the sandstone that lay above contained many volcanic fragments and was full of sharp-edged grains of chert and quartz, highly varied in texture, implying to him a volcanic source and swift deposition into the sea (almost no opportunity for streams to have rounded off the grains), implying, therefore, an island arc standing in deep water on a continental margin\x{2014}an Aleutian chain, a Bismarck Archipelago, a Lesser Antilles, a New Zealand, a Japan, thrust upon and overlapping the established continent, a piece of which was that mashed-up shale. Deffeyes mused his way along the cut. \x{201c}There is complexity here because you have not only the upper and lower plates of the Golconda Thrust, which happened in the early Triassic; you also have basin-range faulting scarcely a hundred yards away\x{2014}enormously complicating the regional picture. If you look at a geologic map of western Canada and Alaska, you can see the distinct bands of terrane that successively attached themselves to the continent. Here the pattern has been all broken up and obscured by the block faulting of the Basin and Range, not to mention the great outpouring of Oligocene welded tuff. So this place is a handsome mess. If you ever want to study this sort of collision more straightforwardly, go to the Alps, where you had a continent-to-continent collision and that was it.\x{201d}",

            "<<Before 1900|9:0>>, the method used in this country to extract silver from most ores was to stamp the rock to powder in small stamp mills, then stir the powder into hot salt water and mercury, and, after the mercury had attracted the silver, distill the mercury. In 1887, a more thorough extraction process had been developed in England whereby silver ores were dissolved in cyanide. The method moved quickly to South Africa and eventually to the United States. An obvious application was to run cyanide through old tailings piles to see what others had missed, and a fair amount of such work was done, in particular during the Depression. There had been so many nineteenth-century mines in Nevada, however, that Deffeyes was sure that some had been ignored. He meant to look for them, and the first basin he prospected was the C Floor of Firestone Library, up the hill from his office in Princeton. There he ran through books and journals and began compiling a catalogue of mines and mills in the Basin and Range that had produced more than a certain number of dollars\x{2019} worth of silver between 1860 and 1900. He prefers not to bandy the number. He found them in many places, from barrelcactus country near the Colorado River to ranges near the Oregon line, from the Oquirrh Mountains of Utah to the eastern rampart of the Sierra Nevada. In all, he listed twenty-five. The larger ones, like the Comstock, had been worked and reworked and cyanided to death, and \x{201c}tourists were all over them like ants.\x{201d} A scavenger had best consider lesser mines, out-of-the-way mines\x{2014}the quick-shot enrichments, the small-fissure lodes, where towns grew and died in six years. He figured that any mine worth, say, a million dollars a hundred years ago would still be worth a million dollars, because the old mills at best extracted ninety per cent of the silver in the ores, and the ten per cent remaining would be worth about what the ninety per cent had been worth then. Pulling more books and journals off the shelves, he sought to learn if and where attention had been paid to various old mines in the nineteen-thirties, and wherever he discovered activity at that time he crossed off those mines.",

The valley ran along the line of a fault that was thought to be inactive until that night. The air was crisp. The moon was full. The day before, a fire watcher in a tower in the Gallatins had become aware of an unnerving silence. The birds were gone, he realized. Birds of every sort had made a wholesale departure from his mountain. It would be noted by others that bears had taken off as well, while bears that remained walked preoccupied in circles. The Epsteins had no knowledge of these signs and would not have known what to make of them if they had. They were unaware then that Chinese geologists routinely watch wildlife for intimations of earthquakes. They were also unaware that David Love, of the Survey\x{2019}s office in Laramie, had published an abstract only weeks before called \x{201c}Quaternary Faulting in and near Yellowstone Park,\x{201d} in which he expressed disagreement with the conventional wisdom that seismic activity on a grand scale was a thing of the past in that region.

East and west from where she stood ran an eighteen-mile rip in the surface of the earth. The fault ran straight through Culligan\x{2019}s ranch house, and had split its levels, raising the back twelve feet. The tornado sound had been made by eighty million tons of Precambrian mountainside, whose planes of schistosity had happened to be inclined toward the Madison River, with the result that half the mountain came falling down in one of the largest rapid landslides produced by an earthquake in North America in historical time. People were camped under it and near it. Among the dead were some who died of the air blast, after flapping like flags as they clung to trees. Automobiles rolled overland like tumbleweed.

            "The mountain touched the Martinsburg, and its rock was the younger by at least ten million years. Kittatinny Mountain is largely quartzite, the primary component of the hubs of Hell. In the posttectonic, profoundly eroded East, quartzite has tended to stand up high. The Martinsburg is soft, and is therefore valley. There is nothing but time between the two. Where the formations meet, a touch of a finger will cover both the beginning and the end of the ten million years, which are dated at <<about 440|9c:0>> and 430 million years before the present\x{2014}from latest Ordovician time to a point in the early Silurian. During that time, something apparently lifted the Martinsburg out of its depositional pit and held it above sea level until weathers wore it low enough to be ready to accept whatever might spread over it from higher ground. The quartzite\x{2014}as sand\x{2014}spread over it, coming down from Taconic mountains. The sand became sandstone. Upward of fifty million years later, the sand grains fused and turned into quartzite in the heat and the crush of new rising mountains, or possibly a hundred million years after that, in the heat and the crush of more mountains. The Delaware River at that time was not even a cloud in the sky. Rivers of greater size were flowing the other way, crossing at wild angles the present route of the Delaware. Rivers go wherever the country tells them to, if the country is in vertical motion. The country would not be right for the Delaware for roughly a hundred million more years, and still another hundred million years would go by before the river achieved its present relationship with Kittatinny Mountain. No one knows how the river cut through. Did it cut from above through country now gone and lying as mud in the sea? Did it work its way through the mountain as two streams, eroding headward from either side, the one finally capturing the other? Was there once a great lake spilling over the mountain and creating the gap as its outlet? The big-lake idea has attracted no support. It is looked upon less as a hypothesis than as a theoretically possible but essentially foolish guess. There was for a time an ice-defended lake between the mountain and the Wisconsinan glacier. When the ice melted, the lake ran out through the Water Gap, leaving in evidence its stream deltas and seasonally banded bottom deposits. However, Glacial Lake Sciota, as it is called, was eight miles long and two hundred feet deep and could not have cut a gap through much of anything but sugar.",

The interstate, encountering this obstacle, had dealt with it with dynamite, opening up what highway engineers called a benched throughcut and geologists finding such a thing in nature call a wind gap. When we reached it, we stopped, got out, and put our noses on the outcrop, for this high multitiered exposure was Frontier sandstone, and Love referred to it as \x{201c}a published roadcut,\x{201d} studied to the last grain by paleontologists and stratigraphers. The reason for so much attention was not readily apparent in the gray and somewhat gloomy, sooty-looking rock, antiqued with fossil burrows. Nonetheless, it seemed to excite Love\x{2014}as he picked at it with his hammer\x{2014}at least as much as the woody asters had repelled him. The rock had been submarine sand, not far offshore. \x{201c}Frontier is one of the great oil sands in the Rocky Mountain region,\x{201d} he said. At <<five|9v>>, ten, twenty thousand feet, wildcat after wildcat had found handsome pay in this celebrated host formation, and here it was at the surface, fresh, unweathered, presenting clues to its wealth. Because oil is vulnerable to destruction by increased heat\x{2014}in the earth as in the engine of a car\x{2014}the oldest oil that has been recovered in large quantity is probably Cretaceous in age (loosely speaking, about a hundred million years). For about one human life span, geologists have had the ability to discern where, in the subsurface, oil should be. A large percentage of all the oil on earth has been burned up in fifty years. Around 1975, the quantity being discovered had diminished to the level of the quantity being burned. Love remarked that half a billion barrels of oil had been found in the Frontier sandstone in one field alone. With reverence, I collected a wormy chunk.",

The first\x{2014}thirty miles away\x{2014}was in the Big Sand Draw, where the grass was inadequate, the snows were exceptionally deep, and the water was marginally potable. In 1897, he collapsed his umbrella and moved. At Muskrat Creek, long before he bought the stagecoach towns, he lived in an earth dugout roofed with pine poles and clay. It was warm in winter, cool in summer, and danker than Scotland all year round. He was prepared to run risks. In Lander, sixty miles west, he made an extraordinary bet with a bank, whose assets included a number of thousands of sheep. John Love bet that he could take them for a summer and return them in the fall, fatter on the average by at least ten pounds. If he succeeded, he would be paid handsomely. If he failed, he would receive a scant wage. He was taking a chance on the weather, because a bad storm could wipe out the flock. By November, the sheep were as round as poker chips, ready to be cashed in. Leaving them in the care of a herder, he rode to Thermopolis, where he made a down payment on a flock of his own. The conditions of the deal were rigid: the rest of the money was to be paid in seven days or the deposit was forfeit and the animals, too. Within the week, he would have to return to his fattened sheep, move them to Lander, collect his money, and return to Thermopolis\x{2014}a round trip of two hundred and fifty miles. The sky over Thermopolis was dark with snowcloud. In his bearskin cap, his bearskin coat, his fleece-lined leather chaps, he saddled up Big Red\x{2014}Big Red, whose life had begun somewhere in the Red Desert in 1888, a wild horse. The blizzard began as horse and rider were climbing the Owl Creek Mountains. Through steep terrain that would have been hazardous in warm clear weather, they felt their way in whiteouts and darkness, in wind-chill factors greater than fifty below zero. Covering about six miles an hour, they reached the herd in twenty-one hours, and almost immediately began the gingerly walk to Lander, conserving the animals\x{2019} weight. John won his bet, got back on Big Red, and flew across the mountains with the money. He and the horse beat the deadline. He collected his ewes, took them home, and bred them. In seven days, he had, among other things, set himself forward one year. By <<1910|9:1>>, when he married Miss Waxham, he owned more than eleven thousand sheep and hundreds of cattle and horses\x{2014}a fortune in livestock which today would be valued at roughly five million dollars.",

Soon, though, the Archean cratons began to collide, building mountains where they hit, and sometimes trapping between them volcanic-island arcs\x{2014}a series of events that took place in the geologic brevity of a hundred million years. <<About 1850|9:0>> (1.85 billion years before the present), the Wyoming, Hearne, and Superior microcontinents came together, and the belt of deformation that held them tight is known in the science as the Trans-Hudson Orogen. A closed ocean, it is full of the crunched remains of oceanic islands. In 1900, they might have looked much like Indonesia today, but without its vegetation. By <<1830|9u>>, they would have resembled what Indonesia will look like after it collides with Asia. By <<1800|9:0>>, over-all, the Canadian Shield was complete. From 1800 to 1400, most of North America grew on its margins.",

            "Beyond the sheared edge of the Wyoming craton, seventeen hundred and fifty million years ago, islands stood in the ocean: volcanic-island arcs\x{2014}Japans in motion. They came in one after the other. We know them as conterminous country: southeastern Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska. Moving northerly, a crowd of accreting arcs probably extended as far as Chicago and beyond. Their radiometric ages date from their beginnings as islands, when their liquid substance came up off the mantle to solidify as juvenile crust. Their docking times\x{2014}the dates when they connected with the Wyoming craton and with one another\x{2014}are a good deal more difficult to determine, but on the average the islands seem to have existed in the ocean for ten to twenty million years before they collided with something else. The oldest age of the collected island arcs that are now the primary basement of Colorado is 1790\x{2014}1.79 billion years. There was no Colorado and no Nebraska in 1800. Virtually all of it came in during the hundred million years that followed, and by <<1700|9w>> or so the dockings of the arcs were complete. The new continental coastline trended from southern New Mexico through Indiana and on toward Labrador.",

            "Samarium/neodymium ages are accurate but they are not very precise. This distinction\x{2014}between accuracy and precision\x{2014}has a difference, and is less of a split hair than it may at first appear to be. For example, if you say that George Washington submitted his last expense account when he was forty-seven, plus or minus twenty years, you are accurate but you are not at all precise. If you say that Santa Claus came down the chimney at <<12:26|2a>>:09 A.M. on Halloween you are precise but almost surely inaccurate. \x{201c}You are accurate if you are within the stated limits of uncertainty,\x{201d} Van Schmus said, defining the goal of geochronology. \x{201c}You want to be both accurate and precise. You want your limits narrow, and you want the window to include the correct answer.\x{201d} He added, \x{201c}Precise means good lab technique. You can be very precise and very inaccurate. The idea is to narrow the window of accuracy and be, at the same time, precise.\x{201d} In Precambrian geochronology, a window of two million years is an extremely narrow one. A date like 1746\x{2014}plus or minus two\x{2014}is very precise.",

            "In what would become Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and thereabout, the last of the island-arc dockings occurred around 1700\x{2014}seventeen hundred million years ago. This final collision further cooked and deformed the rock now visible in the walls of Fremont County\x{2019}s Arkansas River gorge. The coast of the continent, in 1700, ran from southwestern Texas through Oklahoma, Missouri, Illinois, and Michigan. South of Denver and Ca\x{f1}on City, it was somewhere in southern New Mexico. By <<1650|9:0>>, the continental margin had evidently developed into something much like the modern west coast of South America, which is paralleled most of the way by the Peru-Chile Trench, the boundary between the South American and the Nazca tectonic plates. The Peru-Chile Trench is as much as twentysix thousand feet deep, a number that suggests the grandeur of the collision that is taking place as South America, moving west, rides over the Nazca Plate, which consists of nearly ten million square miles of ocean crust. Below the trench, the subduction zone dips to the east and under South America. Down there, the descending crust significantly melts, and the resulting magma has risen through the rock of the edge of South America to emerge as Volc\x{e1}n San Pedro, Volcan Llullaillaco, Volc\x{e1}n El Potro, del Toro, Domuyo, Mercedario, Aconcagua\x{2014}the Andes. The vertical difference between Aconcagua and the bottom of the trench not far away is forty-nine thousand two hundred and eighty-eight feet. That was the style (the altitudes are unknown) of the mountains of Kansas 1.65 billion years ago, and of the North American coast, running through southern Oklahoma\x{2014}an Andean margin, with ocean crust subducting and melting beneath it, making Mercedarios and Aconcaguas.",

Near Laramie\x{2014}after running along and then jumping across the old Cheyenne Belt, edge of the continent in 1800\x{2014}you would have moved onto the compacted island-arc complex whose dockings filled in Colorado and Nebraska, and much of the rest of the United States. You would not have encountered there the pink granite (today\x{2019}s front-range granite) that came into the arc complex <<around 1450|18:0>> as one of the mysterious plutons.

            "These eleven-hundred-million-year-old North American time lines have now all but met in the middle\x{2014}at the future sites of Lincoln, Omaha, Des Moines. In 1108, when the rifting began, the three sites were a good deal closer together. Now, <<around 1100|9u>>, they were still moving apart and would continue to move apart for fourteen million years. Something under the core of North America was tearing North America apart, threatening its continuing existence as an integral continent. It seems likely that the cause of the Midcontinent Rift was a thermal plume from deep in the mantle, a geophysical hot spot doming the crust and then cracking it. Flood basalts filled the rifting valley. At night above the lava fountains the whole sky was red. At <<about 1100|9c:0>>, the triple junction broke open under Lake Superior, connecting this southwestern arm and the arm that ran through Michigan. If the rifting had gone on long enough, the country between the two active arms\x{2014}including at least half of what is now called the Midwest\x{2014}would have departed from North America to end up who knows where and in how many pieces. In the middle of North America, a great bay would have developed, with a shoreline of a thousand miles.",

            "Between Lincoln and Omaha, I-80 runs directly over the center of the rift. It gradually slides toward the rift\x{2019}s eastern flank at Des Moines. On I-80, the whole western half of Iowa is over the rift itself or its flanking basins. To follow this cartographically, you would need the Composite Magnetic Anomaly Map or an isostatic residual gravity map of the United States. On the magnetic and gravity maps the Midcontinent Rift is the most prominent feature you see. A quarter-century ago, it was as unknown in scientific mapping as it still is in road mapping. It was referred to as \x{201c}the midcontinent gravity anomaly\x{201d} or \x{201c}the midcontinent gravity high\x{201d}\x{2014}descriptions merely, without implication or sense of cause. If the rifting had continued even for a couple of hundred million years, as the Mid-Atlantic rifting has done, Lincoln and Des Moines would be as far apart as Jersey City and Casablanca, whose sites were once as close as Lincoln and Des Moines. Yet that did not happen. The midcontinent rift system did not in the end play a major role in the evolution of the continent, because the rifting stopped\x{2014}or was stopped\x{2014}more or less abruptly. The rift system\x{2019}s oldest rocks date from <<1108|9c:0>>, the youngest from 1086, so the rifting lasted twenty-two million years\x{2014}not much by comparison with an Atlantic Ocean, but (to date) about three times the rifting of the Gulf of California and longer than the rifting of the Red Sea.",

            'Something seems to have snuffed out the young hot spot, leaving the midcontinent intact. Where crustal blocks had dropped in the middle of the rift as it widened, they now were subjected to a compressional force so great that the middle of the rift rose up to a position higher than the sides. In the language of geology, grabens were squeezed upward and became horsts. It was as if the Red Sea were to stop widening, while its floor came up to stand higher than the shores. The compressional force that stopped the rift in Proterozoic North America is believed to have been the Grenville Orogeny. This name has been given to a continent-to-continent collision, completed by <<about 1050|3:0>>, that brought the West African Craton and the Amazonian Craton against the eastern and southern margins of North America to create the supercontinent Rodinia, hundreds of millions of years before Pangaea, the most recent of supercontinents. In Grenville time, the African and South American cratons were neither configured nor juxtaposed as they would be in the next eon. They were not put together as they are now. They resembled their modern forms about as little as North America did. From Texas to Labrador, the Grenville Orogeny built the beginnings of eastern America.',
