            "At <<midnight|13>>, when Geever and the other black boy and the nurse went off duty, and the old colored fellow, Mr. Turkle, came on for his shift, McMurphy and Billy were already up, taking vitamins, I imagined. I got out of bed and put on a robe and walked out to the day room, where they were talking with Mr. Turkle. Harding and Scanlon and Sefelt and some of the other guys came out too. McMurphy was telling Mr. Turkle what to expect if the girl did come\x{2014}reminding him, actually, because it looked like they\x{2019}d talked it all over beforehand a couple of weeks back. McMurphy said that the thing to do was let the girl in the window, instead of risking having her come through the lobby, where the night supervisor might be. And to unlock the Seclusion Room then. Yeah, won\x{2019}t that make a fine honeymoon shack for the lovers? Mighty secluded. (\x{201c}Ahh, McMurphy,\x{201d} Billy kept trying to say.) And to keep the lights out. So the supervisor couldn\x{2019}t see in. And close the dorm doors and not wake up every slobbering Chronic in the place. And to keep quiet; we don\x{2019}t want to disturb them.",

            "Billy got more and more nervous, afraid the girl might not show up, afraid she might. He kept asking why didn\x{2019}t we all go to bed, instead of sitting out here in the cold dark like hounds waiting at the kitchen for table scraps, and we just grinned at him. None of us felt like going to bed; it wasn\x{2019}t cold at all, and it was pleasant to relax in the half-light and listen to McMurphy and Mr. Turkle tell tales. Nobody acted sleepy, or not even very worried that it was <<after two o\x{2019}clock|6>> and the girl hadn\x{2019}t showed up yet. Turkle suggested maybe she was late because the ward was so dark she couldn\x{2019}t see to tell which one to come to, and McMurphy said that was the obvious truth, so the two of them ran up and down the halls, turning on every light in the place, were even about to turn on the big overhead wake-up lights in the dorm when Harding told them this would just get all the other men out of bed to share things with. They agreed and settled for all the lights in the doctor\x{2019}s office instead.",

            "Mixed in paper medicine cups with the liquor and the port wine, the syrup had a taste like a kid\x{2019}s drink but a punch like the cactus apple wine we used to get in The Dalles, cold and soothing on the throat and hot and furious once it got down. We turned out the lights in the day room and sat around drinking it. We threw the first couple of cups down like we were taking our medication, drinking it in serious and silent doses and looking one another over to see if it was going to kill anybody. McMurphy and Turkle switched back and forth from the drink to Turkle\x{2019}s cigarettes and got to giggling again as they discussed how it would be to lay that little nurse with the birthmark who went off at <<midnight|13>>.",

            "Harding\x{2019}s speech, if it hadn\x{2019}t actually sobered people, had at least made them realize the seriousness of what we were doing. The night was getting on, and some thought had to be given to the arrival of the staff in the morning. Billy Bibbit and his girl mentioned that it was <<after four o\x{2019}clock|6>> and, if it was all right, if people didn\x{2019}t mind, they\x{2019}d like to have Mr. Turkle unlock the Seclusion Room. They went off under an arch of flashlight beams, and the rest of us went into the day room to see what we could decide about cleaning up. Turkle was all but passed out when he got back from Seclusion, and we had to push him into the day room in a wheelchair.",

I need me a little shut-eye before my big getaway. The day shift doesn\x{2019}t come on for another two hours yet; let\x{2019}s leave Billy and Candy down there a while longer. I\x{2019}ll cut out about six. Sandy, honey, maybe an hour in the dorm would sober us up. What do you say? We got a long drive tomorrow, whether it\x{2019}s Canada or Mexico or wherever.\x{201d}",
