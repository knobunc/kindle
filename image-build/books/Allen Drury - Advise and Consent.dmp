It was a shrewd if somewhat incomplete appraisal of the appointment, an assessment of its world and domestic political implications, and a suggestion for certain actions to be taken in the event of favorable action by the Senate. After it left his desk the Ambassador called home and reminded his wife that they were to attend the party at Mrs. Harrison\x{2019}s that night.

A few clerks and secretaries drifted in, the parliamentarian and his assistant stood at one of the doors talking, the clerk of the Senate and the sergeant-at-arms stood talking at another, the first reporters waiting to see Bob Munson wandered into the well of the Senate and stood about exchanging chaff. At his desk on the majority side, Dave Grant, secretary to the Majority, busied himself with papers and made last-minute calls to senatorial offices advising the expected schedule of business for the day, and at his desk on the minority side Bert Hallam, secretary to the Minority, did the same. Above in the public galleries the tourists settled themselves in an excited, peering bustle, a few senatorial wives and special guests entered the family gallery to the Chair\x{2019}s left, a few dark-skinned individuals of indeterminate nationality took their places in the diplomatic gallery directly across from him, a few reporters came into the press gallery directly above and behind him. From his personal office across the Senators\x{2019} lobby, behind the chamber, Harley Hudson peeped out quickly and then went in again, but not before several tourists had spotted him and exclaimed delightedly to one another. The press corps grew in front of Bob Munson\x{2019}s desk and in front of that of Warren Strickland of Idaho, the Minority Leader, directly across the center aisle. Paul Hendershot of Indiana, the first Senator to appear, came on the floor like some bright old peering bird and took his seat toward the back of the room; he was followed quickly by Cecil Hathaway of Delaware, John Baker of Kentucky, Bob Randall of New Jersey, and Powell Hanson of North Dakota. For a moment the four of them stopped to talk, a little knot of laughing, congenial men, then broke up and went to their respective desks. Murfee Andrews of Kentucky, loaded down with books and documents, came in prepared to do battle on the pending Federal Reserve bill; he was followed by his two principal antagonists, Taylor Ryan of New York and Julius Welch of Washington, looking fully as determined as he. It was <<ten minutes to noon|10>> on the day of the Leffingwell nomination and the Senate, with the exception of minor changes here and there, looked exactly as it had at <<ten minutes to noon|10>> in 1820, 1890, 1910, 1935, 1943, or any other time. As if by concerted agreement the Majority Leader entered down the center aisle, the Minority Leader entered from the side, and the press moved in on them both as they shook hands and gave one another friendly greeting while the tourists stared and twittered up above.",

Out among the embassies the Belgians, the Ceylonese, the Rumanians, and the Dutch were getting ready to entertain at lavishly decorated, lavishly catered receptions that would be attended by representatives of all the other embassies in town with which at the moment, they happened to be on speaking terms. In hundreds of giant apartment houses thousands of government girls were about to descend in thousands of self-operated elevators to meet thousands of government boys for a night on the town; and on Ninth Street and other drab haunts of Washington\x{2019}s incorrigibly small-town sin, little aimless groups of sailors, soldiers, airmen, and marines from nearby bases had just begun to wander about looking for wine, women, and a place in which to enjoy them.

Three orchestras were playing, one in the enormous living room, one in the great glassed-in sun porch and one in the ballroom upstairs, and there was a sort of loud, reverberating roar flooding the mansion, compounded of three different popular tunes going loudly at the same time, the thump of feet dancing, chandeliers tinkling, ice clinking, and everywhere amiable voices, getting increasingly loud and fuzzy, talking, talking, talking. He could sense already from the relaxed and easy tone of things that the party was very likely going to last until <<three|9c:1>>, if not later, and as the two ambassadors got their drinks and he switched quietly to plain ginger ale he decided that much could be done about the nomination before it was over. At the door he saw Orrin and Beth Knox arriving with Brigham and Mabel Anderson, to be followed immediately by Lafe Smith, traveling alone, and Seab Cooley, arriving with Arly and Helen Richardson. Crystal Danta came in with Hal Knox, George and Helen Keating followed and in a moment Tom and Anna August entered just ahead of the Ryans, the Welches, and the Andrews, who, their official differences on the Federal Reserve bill forgotten, arrived together in a merry group. Elsewhere in the room he could see Alexander and Mary Chabot of Louisiana talking animatedly to Allen and Evelyn Whiteside, and in the crush on the great winding staircase toward which he was leading his two companions he saw Winthrop of Massachusetts and his horsey, charming wife talking to Victor and Hazel Ennis, who looked hearty and a little tight, while behind them Fred Cahill of Missouri was struggling upwards with four drinks clutched desperately in his hands toward his wife and Luis and Concepci6n Valdez of New Mexico, who were hemmed in at the top of the stairs. The Senate was well represented already, and would be more so before long. He waved heartily to them all across the surging crowd and was about to take his captive diplomats up the stairs to Dolly\x{2019}s private study when he felt a nudge and looked around to find the Majority whip and their ebullient colleague from West Virginia beaming at his side.",

There had been three before it, and there were many after, but those who attended that night looked back upon it fondly as one of Dolly\x{2019}s greatest triumphs. It is true, of course, that a number of people, including two Cabinet officers, three four-star generals, half a dozen distinguished members of the press, and a whole clutch of prominent civil servants proved beyond all doubt that they could get just as drunk and just as mean and just as sloppy as, say, the president of the bank and the head of Rotary and the editor of the local paper at the country club dance back home; but on the whole it was a good crowd that enjoyed itself in a good way, liquid but happy.

How much of all their lives, Senator Munson thought, had been spent in the Senate Caucus Room; how many, many hours of testimony and investigation, high tragedy and tinpot comedy, frequently hectic and shabby, as America is hectic and shabby, but sometimes moving and noble, as America is moving and noble. The raw stuff of the government and the country came to the Caucus Room month in, month out, year in, year out, an unending pageant of idealism, veniality, astuteness, stupidity, selfishness, selflessness, failure, and achievement; and this time, he knew, the only difference was that extra excitement, that little edge of extra electric tension that came when participants and audience knew that something of really major import was under way.",

            'The Committee on Government Operations under Rhett Jackson of North Carolina is conducting one of its expeditions through the government procurement agencies, turning up as usual small, dark, loudly injured men from New York and Chicago who have been busily fleecing their country out of millions of dollars with the willing and well-paid compliance of several government inspectors who now wish they had taken up some other line of work or been more honest about the one they did decide to follow. It is too late now, however, and the committee is having a field day with their misjudgments. Senator Jackson, lean, hawk-featured and astute, is making the most of it, ably aided and assisted by such colleagues as razor-tongued Leif Erickson of Minnesota and patient, well-informed Lloyd B. Cavanaugh of Rhode Island. Right now all three of these gentlemen are bearing down on an inspector for the Army Quartermaster Corps, and the press is looking forward to some substantial sensations by <<noon|13>>.',

            "In Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, attendance is high, for there, under the smooth chairmanship of glib Rob Cunningham of Arizona, the issue this morning is a bill to provide certain legal encouragements to defense-plant construction; and this is a subject on which Senators and certain influential constituents alike have powerful views. Equally high is the attendance in the Agriculture Committee, where the issue is the disposal of farm surpluses. The issue in Agriculture is almost always farm surpluses in one form or another, and all hearings on the subject have approximately the same features: the stern denunciation of the Secretary of Agriculture by the chairman and most of the committee, his amiable but stubbornly unyielding rejoinders, and finally the bitter climax of threats of retaliation and impeachment. The Secretary, who has gone through all this on both sides of the Capitol twenty times before, is not noticeably impressed by it today, and so the committee\x{2019}s annoyance is rising somewhat more rapidly than usual. The press is now betting that the threats of impeachment will begin somewhere <<around 11 a.m.|5>> instead of at <<noon|13>> as they usually do. This will give them the usual story on the subject, and later on in the chamber members of the committee will make their usual indignant speeches; and nothing will be done to the Secretary, nor will the Congress offer any sensible alternative of its own, nor will the earth stop giving its yields in ever greater amounts, nor will anything be done to solve the paradox of history\x{2019}s greatest producer of food, unable to find a use for its surpluses in a world where people starve.",

            'Outwardly, of course, the story was factual and complete and in many ways standard for that time and section. His father had been a country storekeeper, raising seven children by the gift of gab and the grace of God and enough hard work to keep a little food in the cupboard and the necessary minimum of clothing on their backs. Living on the edge of poverty had imposed on all the children the obligation to go to work young, and Seab, first child and first son of four, early began to help his father in the store. This, begun at <<nine|9c:1>>, plus odd jobs for neighbors and other businessmen around Barnwell, had soon given him an ease with grownups and a familiarity with their world which rapidly sharpened an already highly active native intelligence to the point where he presently came to be regarded as one of the most promising youths around the countryside. His grades in school bore this out, for he had no trouble at all in leading his class consistently through grammar school and the first two years in high school. Then his father died, and there was no solution to the problem this posed except to drop school and take over the store to support his mother and the family. A year after this, driven to an almost frantic restlessness by the certainty that he had abilities far beyond storekeeping and the knowledge that he was not making use of them, he answered a high-school-by-mail advertisement and by dint of rising religiously at five every morning and studying until eight when he opened the store, and then studying again from immediately after supper until <<11 p.m.|5>>, he managed to complete his high-school course and received an accredited diploma in a year and a half. By then his next oldest brother was fifteen and able to take an increasingly active part in running the store (he kept at it all his life, and when he had died three years ago Cooley Stores, Inc., in which the Senator still held a sizeable share of stock, had branches in fifteen cities in the Carolinas, six in Georgia, and four in Alabama), and Seab began to think seriously about college.',

This action was taken on his own and without consultation with anyone else on the subcommittee or anyone else in the Senate, and as such it was to some degree an uncharacteristic action, one of the few impulsive and uncareful moments in a life which has not known many. Underlying his attempt to enjoy the day is the uneasy thought that possibly he had moved too fast and may regret it. Yet such had been the desperate urgency of James Morton\x{2019}s call, and so deep its anguished intensity, that he had perforce been swept into the conviction that it was genuine; and when he had called the number back within ten minutes to check for sure, the man had displayed an even greater anxiety. This had strengthened his own general tendency to be essentially a lone wolf, and he had felt further that in this case there were party matters involved, the commitment of the President and the Majority Leader to the nominee, all the matters of party prestige and political standing now riding on the shoulders of Robert A. Leffingwell, which he felt imposed an obligation upon him not to divulge his reasons to the press or anyone else until he could have a chance to discuss them at the White House. Compounding this reaction also was his shock and surprise, for he had been coming around in his own mind to a point where he could actively support the nominee.

It had been a rough fifteen hours, for all that they had seemed outwardly to affect him so little, and for all that it had been only Celestine, who in her silent way had recognized the full extent of the mental turmoil he had been going through. This was the biggest act of political defiance he had ever committed, the biggest single act of will he had ever displayed on the national scene, the first time he had ever stood out alone against the overwhelming weight of the White House, the party, the press, and a major portion of domestic and world opinion; and it was not an easy thing to do, however much an innate iron and strength of character had come to his assistance. He still had no great fear of the consequences, for he still felt he had a good case to make, and he still felt thoroughly capable of weathering whatever might come as a result of his actions; but this did not make it any easier to undergo, inside. Along with the stubbornness, the integrity of character, the impassive unyielding calm and tolerance there also went a very real sensitivity and a heart that could be bruised much more easily than the world knew. He didn\x{2019}t like to be going against popular opinion, he didn\x{2019}t enjoy being pilloried in the press, he didn\x{2019}t want to think he was giving trouble to his party and his friends.

            "There he had found that the emotional storms of the evening were not yet over, for the Andersons of course were there, as were Hal and Crystal and Stanley Danta, and there had been an unhappy couple of hours getting everybody quieted down and off to bed. Pidge mercifully fell to sleep early, her mother went to bed in Beth\x{2019}s room about ten after breaking them all up by remarking wistfully, \x{201c}I never really knew him, and now I never will,\x{201d} and after a time there remained only the immediate family to settle down and then he himself could get some rest. First, however, there had to be some fast planning for Hal and Crystal, who at first were determined to postpone the wedding on Wednesday afternoon, until their-fathers talked them out of it. Brig, it was explained, wouldn\x{2019}t have wanted that at all, and while it was agreed that they should cancel most of the guest list and restrict it to just a few close friends, there was no reason to put it off altogether. Dolly was called and consulted; said she was canceling the reception but thought they should go ahead with the rest of it as Orrin and Stanley suggested; after a while Hal and Crystal agreed reluctantly and went off, much troubled, to bed, Hal to his room and Crystal back to the Westchester, where she said she would make some coffee and sit up for her father. A call came from Brig\x{2019}s brother in Salt Lake City that he would be flying in in the morning, and Stanley volunteered to meet him and assist during the day Monday with the many details of liquidating the remnants of a life. It was decided that a memorial service would be held at National Cathedral at <<2 p.m.|5>> Tuesday, with burial in Salt Lake on Wednesday. The Senate would devote itself to eulogies tomorrow, and because of the services on Tuesday and the fact that a recess for the wedding on Wednesday had been promised long ago, there was now no possibility of a vote on the nomination until Thursday. Orrin told Stanley bluntly that he was out to beat it and would use every means at his command; Senator Danta looked grave and unhappy and finally said he thought possibly he would go along with this. Shortly after he left the house Seab called to say he had already contacted fifteen of their colleagues, including Sam Eastwood of Colorado, Stuart Schoenfeldt of Pennsylvania, Ray Smith and Vic Ennis of California, Roy Mulholland of Michigan, and Powell Hanson. Of them all, he reported, only Powell Hanson and Victor Ennis had refused to abandon their commitments to vote for the nominee. Of the rest, ten were now opposed and three were leaning their way. Seab said he would go on telephoning until <<about 2 a.m.|5>> and then start in again at <<six-thirty in the morning|5>>. Senator Knox thanked him with satisfaction and suggested several others he might work on. Senator Cooley promised grimly to do his best. There was no word from the Majority Leader, and Orrin made no move to call him. He imagined Bob was having a rough time and he was damned glad of it. He will get to him tomorrow, he thinks now, and he will see then what remains of an old friendship and a close alliance in the face of these somber events. He does not know exactly what part Bob played in the tragedy of their young friend, but instinct tells him it was not helpful to Brig when the chips were down. If it was something really bad, he tells himself grimly, he may never forgive him.",

            "Now in Chicago their preliminary battle was fought out for three days in the credentials committee, in the platform committee, in hotel suites and delegation headquarters and on the floor of the Stockyards Amphitheater. His delegation from Indiana was seated, the Governor\x{2019}s was thrown out, the Governor\x{2019}s delegation from New Jersey was seated, his was thrown out. Wisconsin caucused and came over to him; Pennsylvania caucused and split, with the Governor picking up almost half; Michigan, with Governor Harley Hudson at its head, and Ohio, with Governor Howard Sheppard in command, began to become more and more important to both headquarters. The convention, in the way of all national conventions, became a world unto itself, bounded by the hotels and the Amphitheater, in which there was no time, no outside world, nothing but the rising contest between two strong men vying for the greatest prize men could hope to achieve. There was no rest, little sleep, no surcease; five thousand increasingly tired delegates, reporters, and politicians\x{2014}of whom two in particular, and their wives, had forgotten what it was to relax\x{2014}began to brace themselves for the hour of balloting. At <<3 p.m.|5>> on the fourth day the nominations were made and the wild demonstrations began, around and around and around the screaming, roaring hall, <<two hours and twelve minutes|14>> for him, <<two hours and fifteen minutes|14>> for the Governor of California; half an hour, until he withdrew, for Bob Munson, an hour for Harley Hudson and another for Howie Sheppard. There was a recess for dinner, eaten so hastily in the midst of last-minute conferences that nobody knew what was being consumed and nobody cared. At <<9 p.m.|5>> the chairman of the convention banged the gavel and the proudest roll of names Americans know began to boom over the loudspeakers: \x{201c}A\x{2014}la\x{2014}bama!... A\x{2014}laska!... Ari\x{2014}zona!\x{201d} Destiny paused in the stockyards and the world settled down to watch.

He had tried desperately to see Harley and Howie in the interval, had reached the latter for a noncommittal but fairly encouraging two minutes, but Harley was remaining aloof. When the roll began Harley was on the platform, as though wishing to speak, which caused great excitement in the Amphitheater; but he did not, the roll started; Michigan continued to stand firm for its Governor, Ohio did the same; Wisconsin broke and went to the Governor, but Minnesota came over to Senator Knox. Deadlock again. The chairman held a hasty conference with the managers of the two top contenders, a quick agreement was reached, the convention was adjourned until <<10 a.m.|5>> next day.

I\x{2019}m standing by that. I hope you\x{2019}ll be with me tomorrow morning.\x{201d} The Governor of Michigan had given him a long look and a firm hand shake before they had gone back out to face the blinding flashbulbs and the television cameras and put off with bland and friendly wisecracks the eager questions of the press. \x{201c}I hope I will be able to,\x{201d} Harley had said as they opened the door. \x{201c}I hope everything works out.\x{201d}",

By order of his successor the Mansion was thrown open to the public on Friday, and all day long, in an endless line two abreast, shuffling and slow, native and foreign and black and white, they moved patiently up the curving drive, under the portico, into the East Room and around the candle-lit catafalque and slowly, slowly, out the door and down the other drive and out the East Gate. It was estimated by the press, which kept round-the-clock vigil as the day passed and the night came on and the city went fitfully to sleep and the dawn came again, that more than 200,000 people passed through 1600 Pennsylvania on this last farewell; and when the coffin on its horse-drawn caisson moved out the West Gate at <<10 a.m.|5>>, turned and started along Pennsylvania Avenue with its procession of sleek black limousines following behind, it was estimated that more than a million more lined the route.',

The senior Senator from South Carolina, author of the severest and perhaps the only truly honest expression of opinion the press had received on that hectic <<midnight|13>>\x{2014}\x{201c}He was an evil man, and the Lord has rendered judgment upon him\x{201d}\x{2014}sat silent, bland, and unblinking as they rode along, his face impassive; men did not dare imagine what he might be thinking in that shrewd, unforgiving old mind. The Speaker too was silent, lost in thoughts of his own, not sad, not happy, simply accepting what time and politics had brought and planning how best he might adjust to the new personality in the White House. In their car following, the Majority Leader of the Senate caught from time to time the eye of the Minority Leader of the Senate, and between them there passed on several occasions a look of mingled regret, relief, and concern, regret as one regrets the passing of any major force of nature terrible and magnificent in its ability for good and its capacities for evil, relief that they no longer had to deal with him, concern for the pleasantly undistinguished man who had taken his place and now bore all their hopes.",

Many people had cried, and the new Chief Executive had looked as though he might,, too.

Every room had a view of Angel Island, with the lights of Berkley/Oakland to the left and San Francisco to the right. It was a spectacular view that Uncle Al never looked at when he was working. His home office furniture was utilitarian\x{2014}filing cabinets, a bookcase, a reading desk supporting an ancient copier, a table where he read and sorted reference materials, and a sturdy desk with typewriter hard against the wall farthest from the window. Items of interest relevant to whatever he was working on\x{2014}postcards, photos, maps, menus\x{2014}were tacked to the walls in an ever-changing collage. Books, with pages of interest marked by metal tabs in assorted colors, were arranged in easy reach. Everything within his sight or reach was directly related to the project at hand\x{2014}no distractions, nothing unnecessary, was allowed within his sphere. He\x{2019}d rise early, eat a Spartan breakfast, then disappear into his office; from that moment until <<noon|13>> the only evidence of his existence was the sound of his typewriter. Uncle Al did allow himself vacations between novels, and he traveled a great deal when conducting research, but when the time came to write, he put six hours a day, six days a week, of butt-in-chair work into every project. My family lived in Florida and the room across the hall from mine was his bachelor apartment\x{2014}a large room with its own bath and porch\x{2014}where he stayed several weeks a year.
