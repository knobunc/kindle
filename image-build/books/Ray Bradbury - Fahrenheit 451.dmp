The printed word seemed far more real to him, and the pages of countless library books formed the core of his education. Bradbury would never attend college; after his 1938 graduation from Los Angeles High School, he spent four years selling evening newspapers at the corner of Norton and Olympic, earning one penny for every three-cent newspaper he sold. But he continued to read voraciously, absorbing a wide range of classics as well as the works of contemporary writers. Sometime in 1944 he read Arthur Koestler\x{2019}s Darkness at <<Noon|13>>, and from that point on, Fahrenheit 451 was inevitable.",

Given these activities and the emerging agenda of the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, it required a relatively small leap of the imagination for Bradbury to extend his storytelling into civil liberties.

Bradbury soon sent a subsequent hand-revised typescript, now titled \x{201c}The Fire Man,\x{201d} to Don Congdon. In early September 1950 Congdon had a clean copy prepared and began to circulate it. His initial impulse was to start with Amazing Stories, one of the oldest magazines in the pulp tradition of science fiction and fantasy, but he and Bradbury quickly decided to try mainstream magazines first, where Congdon had long-standing connections as both an agent and an editor. In quick succession, Esquire, the Canadian weekly Maclean\x{2019}s, The Saturday Evening Post, and Cosmopolitan all declined the novella, which now carried the slightly shortened title \x{201c}The Fireman.\x{201d} Congdon then sent it on to Town & Country, planning to submit it to Astounding if it failed to find a home there.",

            "A variant opening page for \x{201c}<<Long After Midnight|13>>,\x{201d} the first complete draft of the Fahrenheit 451 concept. This page was probably composed around August 1950, close to the time that Bradbury produced the complete draft in the UCLA library typing room. The \x{201c}<<Long After Midnight|13>>\x{201d} stage of work opens with a vivid nightmare of discovery as Leonard (not yet Guy) Montag is turned in by a neighbor boy for hiding and reading forbidden books. This opening scene disappears from all subsequent versions of Fahrenheit 451.",

            "The completion of \x{201c}The Fireman\x{201d} capped a miracle year of creativity for Bradbury. Between summer 1949 and summer 1950, he had also transformed and bridged many of his Martian stories into The Martian Chronicles and woven a looser but no less compelling tapestry of unrelated science fiction stories into The Illustrated Man collection, which was released in February 1951. His newest stories were now reaching the pages of Collier\x{2019}s, The Saturday Evening Post, and Esquire for the first time, extending his popularity in the mainstream magazine market. But even as he moved ahead with new stories, Bradbury began to consider refashioning \x{201c}The Fireman.\x{201d} Once again, Arthur Koestler\x{2019}s Darkness at <<Noon|13>> provided the initial spark. After seeing Sidney Kingsley\x{2019}s award-winning Broadway dramatization of Koestler\x{2019}s novel during his June 1951 trip to New York, Bradbury was inspired to expand \x{201c}The Fireman\x{201d} in ways that spoke to the increasing tensions of the times.",

            "In fact, world events seemed to form a grim backdrop for Bradbury\x{2019}s revisions. His transformation of \x{201c}The Fireman\x{201d} into Fahrenheit 451 extended through two of the most disturbing announcements the world had known since the dark days of World War II. In late October 1952, the United States proclaimed the successful test of a hydrogen bomb, a weapon far more destructive than the atomic bombs that had ended the war in the Pacific. Then in July 1953, the Soviet Union unexpectedly exploded its first hydrogen bomb, an ominous indicator that the West was no longer ahead of the Eastern Bloc superpower in terms of destructive potential. The Doomsday Clock, a chilling metaphor whose image appears on the cover of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, reached <<two minutes before midnight|10>>. The hands would not come as close to <<midnight|13>> again for the rest of the twentieth century.",

As the list indicates, Bradbury was somewhat concerned that The Illustrated Man, published in February 1951, was his only new book that year. His June 1951 encounter with the Broadway adaptation of Arthur Koestler\x{2019}s Darkness at <<Noon|13>>, the novel that most directly inspired \x{201c}The Fireman,\x{201d} finalized his intention to expand his novella.

She is in a trance, a condition so withdrawn as to resemble catatonia, compounded of equal parts liquor and a small Seashell thimble-radio tucked in her ear. The Seashell croons and murmurs its music and commercials and private little melodramas for her alone. The room is silent. The husband cannot even try to guess the communion between Seashell and wife. Awakening her is not unlike applying shock to a cataleptic.',

I called several other universities. Nobody knew, and nobody seemed to be able to look it up for me. And finally a light went on in my head, and I called the fire department. And I said, \x{201c}Put me through to the fire chief.\x{201d} I got hold of the fire chief here in Los Angeles, and I said, \x{201c}At what temperature does book paper catch fire and burn?\x{201d} He said, \x{201c}Just a moment, be right back.\x{201d} He came back and said, \x{201c}451 Fahrenheit.\x{201d} And I thought, \x{201c}Oh, that\x{2019}s beautiful.\x{201d} That\x{2019}s absolutely beautiful.
