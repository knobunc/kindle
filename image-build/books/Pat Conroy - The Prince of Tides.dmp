            "Luke, Savannah, and I began a ritual of rising at <<five in the morning|5>> and setting a string of crab pots in the river. We would empty the traps of blue crabs, spilling them into a large barrel centered in the boat and baiting the traps with fresh mullet and trash fish. We began with twenty traps and by summer\x{2019}s end we were pulling out fifty along twenty miles of river and creek. Because we were new on the river, we had to respect the rights of the commercial crabbers and set out pots in remote channels far from Colleton proper. We ranged far and wide throughout the county, leaving the wire traps as the signature of our passing. Tying white floats to a rope, we would haul the baited traps into the advancing or withdrawing tides. You could follow us from float to float over the wildest, most desolate stretches of our county. At first we worked slowly and our movements were inexpert and wasteful. But we grew into our task, learned the rhythms of the work, and developed an expertise based on our initial mistakes. In the first month, it took us ten minutes to empty a trap of crabs and to bait it again for the next tide. But in the second month, the same operation took us less than two minutes per trap. It was a matter of perfecting the technique of crabbing. We refined our movements; we learned grace and the economy of precise gestures; we learned that crabbing, like everything else, had its own native beauty, its own properties of dance. We broke even the first month because all our profits went into buying new traps. In the second month, we paid the note on our father\x{2019}s shrimp boat. The older crabbers watched our progress as we brought our catch to be weighed. In the beginning, we were the object of their derision and jokes. By August, we were initiates into their brotherhood. They would gather around to admire Savannah\x{2019}s rough and calloused hands. They gave sound advice. They taught us the mysteries of their rugged craft. Then, after we had mastered the essentials, they praised us by their silence. We were born to the river and they expected us to be good at what we were born to do.",

Soundlessly, we made our way down to the dock, and Luke did not start the motor until we had drifted a quarter of a mile from our house. He turned the boat into the main channel and he headed for the lights of Colleton across the river. He opened up the throttle and we flew through a light, choppy sea on a full tide. We were laughing as we passed under the bridge, but grew silent as we approached the landing at the end of the Street of Tides. Luke cut the motor and we drifted a hundred feet up to the shore where I jumped out and tied the boat to the community dock. We lifted the turtle out of the boat, and stopping often to rest, we moved through the dark abandoned streets of our town toward the Newbury house. We passed beneath the oaks that formed the green canopy along the most distinguished row of houses between Savannah and Charleston. Dogs barked far off in the town.

On Friday of the same week, Bernard won seven of them. After practice I would buy him a Coke and send him home to shower before he began his violin lessons. As his coach, I was making him obedient to a cold and wearying discipline. Because of his desire, he found, to his happy surprise, that he loved it. At the end of the first week, Bernard began to think of himself as a football player. I had transformed him into something he was never supposed to be. He returned the favor by making me feel like a coach again. His mouth still bothered me and he asked too many questions. It took him far too long to learn the basics of the game. But he kept trying and he burned with a love of the sport. He thrilled me and made me understand again the mystery of why I loved to teach boys the rudiments of a game I had played as a child. If a boy came to me in good faith and wanted to learn the game of football, I could make him better than he ever thought he could be. I could light a fire in that boy and other boys would hate to see him on the same field. Already, I could tell that there were boys from Phillips Exeter now asleep in Newport and Westchester who would hurt in the coming autumn because Bernard Woodruff spent his summer learning the fine points of his game in Central Park.',

            "But behind the wheel of his shrimp boat, with the dawn spilling its fine oils across the waters and the winches groaning beneath the weight of the nets, my father was the perfect master of his environment. His time on the river had left its mark and he would always look ten years older than his actual age. Each year his wind-tortured face would sag a bit around the edges and the Carolina sun at nigh <<noon|13>> would loosen and flense the pouches beneath the eyes. His skin was hard and leathery and it looked as though you could strike a kitchen match on the stubble of his chin. His hands were rough and his palms were glazed with layers of calluses the color of vellum. He was a hard-working and respected shrimper, but his talents were not amphibious; they did not follow him up onto dry land. Very early on, my father became obsessed with getting off the river. Shrimping was always a \x{201c}temporary\x{201d} situation with him. Neither of my parents could ever admit that shrimping was a beautiful way of life. They kept aloof from the shrimping fraternity and cut themselves off from any of those natural alliances so common among peers. Of course, the shrimpers and their wives were far too common for my mother\x{2019}s speciously cultivated and unattenuated tastes. My parents had no close friends. Together, they spent their whole lives waiting for their luck to change, as though luck were some fabulous tide that would one day flood and consecrate the marshes of our island, christening us in the iridescent ointments of a charmed destiny. It was an article of faith to Henry Wingo that he was a businessman of genius.

            "When my father gave the word and we heard the engine burst into sudden life, we would untie the boat and leap aboard as he headed out toward the sounds and channels of our island-dappled watery realm. On our right we would pass the sleeping town of Colleton, the mansions and stores along the Street of Tides, and my father would sound the horn to signal the bridge tender to open the bridge for the lordly passage of the Miss Lila on its way out to sea. My father\x{2019}s boat was a fifty-eight-foot beauty with an incredibly shallow draft for such a large boat. He made his three children memorize at an early age the essential numbers of his boat before he would confer official status on us as members of the crew. Shrimping always involves a tireless worship of numerology and when shrimpers discuss their boats they toss arcane figures back and forth that define the capabilities of their respective crafts. My father\x{2019}s main engine was a 6-DAMR-844 Buda manufactured by the Allis-Chalmers Company, Boston. It developed 188 horsepower at <<2100|18:0>> rpm. His reduction gear was a 3.88:1 Capitol. The brass shaft turned a 44-by-36-inch four-blade Federal propeller. The main bilge pump was a 1\x{bc}-inch Jabsco. In the deckhouse was a 42-inch Marty\x{2019}s wheel, a Ritchie compass, a Marmac throttle and clutch controls, and a Metal Marine automatic pilot. There was a Bendix DR16 depth recorder and a Pearce Simpson Atlantic 70 radio. On deck, the Miss Lila carried a Stroudsburg 515\x{bd} T-hoist, Wickwire cable, and Wall Manila rope. The anchor was a 65-pound Danforth and the horn was a 32-volt Spartan. In the language of shrimpers there were other brand names that imparted specific information: Oil City Brass blocks, Surrette Marine batteries, Dodge pillow blocks, Timken bearings, and a hundred others. Like all jobs, shrimping required its own idiom of precise communication. For me this language was as comforting as mother\x{2019}s milk and served as the background music of the part of my childhood spent afloat.",

When the band made the turn into the gas station, my father released three hundred helium-filled balloons, which rose straight up into the air and hovered over the town like lost flowers. He handed out lollipops and bubble gum to the kids. Roman candles exploded on the roof, showering sparks to the ground. The circus clown showed up late and my father was both surprised and delighted that he was a midget. The clown was drunk and broke a dozen Coke bottles trying to juggle them on the back of our pickup truck. The mayor of Colleton, Boogie Weiters, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, made a rather impassioned speech on the importance of attracting new industry to Colleton County. The drunk clown shouted that that should be easy since Colleton County had never attracted any old industry. The crowd applauded the clown, who responded with a spectacular handstand on the cab of the pickup. The Volunteer Fire Department arrived with their new fire truck and received a whole tank of gas free of charge because Henry Wingo wanted them to know how much he appreciated the fine job they were doing protecting the property of Colleton. A reporter from the Colleton Gazette interviewed my father and took his picture with the clown sitting on his shoulder. The high school band played a medley of patriotic songs and my father raised an American flag on top of the gas station when they played \x{201c}The Star-Spangled Banner.\x{201d} Toward the end of the day, the flag was set afire by an errant Roman candle and was extinguished by the members of the Volunteer Fire Department.",

When the story had come to her in the nightmare, she transcribed it in an eight-hour burst of unbroken creativity exactly as she had dreamed it. As she wrote it, she realized she was describing one of these lost interludes in her life. She could feel missing elements in the story and they were far more powerful than the ones she had included. The three men struck a particularly mordant chord in her and their approach to the house caused something to sound in her, far off, like a bell of some deconsecrated church ringing in the wind. She studied the story as though it were a lost sacred text that held inscrutable allusions to the mysteries of her own life. She read the story over and over again, convinced it was a parable or outline for something with far graver implications. Something had happened to her, but for the story she wrote she could come up with only one missing element: the statue of the Infant or Prague her father had brought back from World War II that sat on a table by the front door. She did not know the role the statue had played in the story but she knew it should be there. After Renata killed herself that statue made a hideous appearance in those hallucinations which always came to her in periods of suffering. The Infant of Prague joined forces with the chorus of voices within her, linked up with the black dogs of suicide and the angels of negation. Again, these apparitions chanted the withering litany she had heard since childhood, taunting her with her worthlessness, regaling her with murderous hymns and chants, calling for her death. She began to see the dogs hanging on meat hooks from her apartment wall, their bodies twisted in agony. Hundreds of these crucified dogs screamed out, their voices sibilant and intertwined, for her to kill herself. \x{201c}They\x{2019}re not real. They\x{2019}re not real,\x{201d} Savannah had repeated to herself, but her voice was drowned out in the demonic howling of the impaled accusatory dogs. She would rise up from her living room chair and walk into her bathroom to escape the gathering of dogs. There she found the menstruating angels hanging from the shower rod and the ceiling, with their necks broken, moaning with exquisite suffering. Their voices, delicate and soft, asked her to come home with them, to the safe place with long vistas, to the corridors of endless sleep, to the long night of silence, of voicelessness, where the angels were whole, immaculate, and kind. They lifted their arms toward her in a gesture of solidarity and possessiveness. Their eye sockets were black holes flowing with pus. Above them, she saw the small feet of the Infant of Prague, lynched from the ceiling, his face disfigured and bruised, speaking to her in her mother\x{2019}s voice, demanding that she maintain her silence. Whenever she took out her razor blades and began to count them, she could hear the pleasure of the dogs twisting on the hooks, the ecstasy of those disfigured angels with their fluted, encircling voices. Each night, she counted razor blades and listened to that sullied nation clamoring out the laws of storm, murmuring a <<compline|13>> of suicide.",

            'For a week the police parked a patrol car on Rosedale Road and a plainclothes detective circled our home several times during the night. My mother could not sleep at night and we would find her hovering over us <<after midnight|13>>, obsessively checking and rechecking the locks on our bedroom windows. Once I awoke and saw her framed in moonlight, staring out toward the forests of Callanwolde. As she stood there, I noticed her body for the first time, observed in guilt and terror its soft, voluptuous features, admired the shape of her full breasts and the curve of her waist as she scanned the moonlit yard for the approach of her enemy.',

They said <<vespers|13>> in the trees and watched over us, not because God required it, but because they cherished us and could not help it. She even recruited Norton as a foot soldier in that silent army of occupation which patrolled the winds above the river. Even a dark angel was susceptible to Savannah\x{2019}s enthusiastic overtures.

            "I grew up slowly beside the tides and marshes of Colleton; my arms were tawny and strong from working long days on the shrimp boat in the blazing South Carolina heat. Because I was a Wingo, I worked as soon as I could walk; I could pick a blue crab clean when I was five. I had killed my first deer by the age of seven, and at <<nine|9:0>> was regularly putting meat on my family\x{2019}s table. I was born and raised on a Carolina sea island and I carried the sunshine of the low-country, inked in dark gold, on my back and shoulders. As a boy I was happy above the channels, navigating a small boat between the sandbars with their quiet nation of oysters exposed on the brown flats at the low watermark. I knew every shrimper by name, and they knew me and sounded their horns when they passed me fishing in the river.",

            "Sharon McKissick was eight years old and felt the full weight of being the youngest. She thought that no one in her family ever took her seriously because she was so small and fragile. Everyone had called her \x{201c}Baby\x{201d} McKissick until she was six and reminded everyone that she had a name and it was Sharon. No one had taken the time to explain her father\x{2019}s death to her because they thought she was too little to understand. On the day of her father\x{2019}s funeral, her mother had come to her room and in a trembling voice told her that her father had gone to sleep. She had made her mother cry by answering, \x{201c}For how long?\x{201d} So she had been afraid to ask any more questions. She had watched the grass grow over her father\x{2019}s grave. At first it was a few blades coming out of the earth, then one day, it was all green, like a pretty bedspread covering the place where he was sleep ing. She could see her father\x{2019}s grave from her window and it bothered her at night that he might be lonely. When the wind would rise off the river, she would climb from her bed and gaze out the window toward his grave. In moonlight, she could see it, though it seemed to have nothing to do with her father. She tried to imagine angels gathering around his tombstone, helping him survive the solitude of the windswept night. But nothing helped and she vowed to herself if she ever had an eight-year-old, that child would know everything there was about life, death, and everything in between. She would show them all when she was nine. At <<nine|9e>>, they would listen to her and she certainly had some things to say.",
