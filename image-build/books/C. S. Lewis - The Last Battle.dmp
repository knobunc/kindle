            "The King\x{2019}s first idea was that they should not go back to Stable Hill - they were sick of the very name of it by now till after dark. But the Dwarf told them that if they arrived there by daylight they would probably find the place deserted, except perhaps for a Calormene sentry. The Beasts were far too frightened by what the Ape (and Ginger) had told them about this new angry Aslan - or Tashlan - to go near it except when they were called together for these horrible <<midnight|13>> meetings. And Calormenes are never good woodsmen. Poggin thought that even by daylight they could easily get round to somewhere behind the stable without being seen. This would be much harder to do when the night had come and the Ape might be calling the Beasts together and all the Calormenes were on duty. And when the meeting did begin they could leave Puzzle at the back of the stable, completely out of sight, till the moment at which they wanted to produce him. This was obviously a good thing: for their only chance was to give the Narnians a sudden surprise.",

            "The bonfire had not been lit for long and was just beginning to blaze up. It was only a few feet away from them, and the great crowd of Narnian creatures were on the other side of it, so that Tirian could not at first see them very well, though of course he saw dozens of eyes shining with the reflection of the fire, as you\x{2019}ve seen a rabbit\x{2019}s or cat\x{2019}s eyes in the headlights of a car. And just as Tirian took his place, the gong stopped beating and from somewhere on his left three figures appeared. One was Rishda Tarkaan the Calormene Captain. The second was the Ape. He was holding on to the Tarkaan\x{2019}s hand with one paw and kept whimpering and muttering, \x{201c}Not so fast, don\x{2019}t go so fast, I\x{2019}m not at all well. Oh my poor head! These <<midnight|13>> meetings are getting too much for me. Apes aren\x{2019}t meant to be up at night: It\x{2019}s not as if I was a rat or a bat - oh my poor head.\x{201d} On the other side of the Ape, walking very soft and stately, with his tail straight up in the air, came Ginger the Cat. They were heading for the bonfire and were so close to Tirian that they would have seen him at once if they had looked in the right direction. Fortunately they did not. But Tirian heard Rishda say to Ginger in a low voice:",

            "An experienced warrior and huntsman like Tirian can always wake up at the time he wants. So he gave himself till <<nine o\x{2019}clock that night|6>> and then put all worries out of his head and fell asleep at once. It seemed only a moment later when he woke but he knew by the light and the very feel of things that he had timed his sleep exactly. He got up, put on his helmet-and-turban (he had slept in his mail shirt), and then shook the other two till they woke up. They looked, to tell the truth, very grey and dismal as they climbed out of their bunks and there was a good deal of yawning.",

            "Narnian Dwarfs, though less than four feet high, are for their size about the toughest and strongest creatures there are, so that Poggin, in spite of a heavy day and a late night, woke fully refreshed before any of the others. He at once took Jill\x{2019}s bow, went out and shot a couple of wood pigeons. Then he sat plucking them on the doorstep and chatting to Jewel and Puzzle. Puzzle looked and felt a good deal better this morning. Jewel, being a Unicorn and therefore one of the noblest and delicatest of beasts, had been very kind to him, talking to him about things of the sort they could both understand like grass and sugar and the care of one\x{2019}s hoofs. When Jill and Eustace came out of the Tower yawning and rubbing their eyes at <<almost half past ten|10>>, the Dwarf showed them where they could gather plenty of a Narnian weed called Wild Fresney, which looks rather like our wood-sorrel but tastes a good deal nicer when cooked. (It needs a little butter and pepper to make it perfect, but they hadn\x{2019}t got these.) So that what with one thing and another, they had the makings of a capital stew for their breakfast or dinner, whichever you choose to call it. Tirian went a little further off into the wood with an axe and brought back some branches for fuel. While the meal was cooking - which seemed a very long time, especially as it smelled nicer and nicer the nearer it came to being done - the King found a complete Dwarfish outfit for Poggin: mail shirt, helmet, shield, sword, belt, and dagger. Then he inspected Eustace\x{2019}s sword and found that Eustace had put it back in the sheath all messy from killing the Calormene. He was scolded for that and made to clean and polish it.",

            "\x{201c}It\x{2019}s more a question by now, Sire, if the Ape is in his counsels,\x{201d} replied the Dwarf. \x{201c}The Ape has taken to drinking, you see. My belief is that the plot is now mostly carried on by Ginger or Rishda - that\x{2019}s the Calormene captain. And I think some words that Ginger has scattered among the Dwarfs are chiefly to blame for the scurvy return they made you. And I\x{2019}ll tell you why. One of those dreadful <<midnight|13>> meetings had just broken up the night before last and I\x{2019}d gone a bit of the way home when I found I\x{2019}d left my pipe behind. It was a real good \x{2018}un, an old favourite, so I went back to look for it. But before I got to the place where I\x{2019}d been sitting (it was black as pitch there) I heard a cat\x{2019}s voice say Mew and a Calormene voice say `here . . . speak softly,\x{2019} so I just stood as still as if I was frozen. And these two were Ginger and Rishda Tarkaan as they call him. `Noble Tarkaan,\x{2019} said the Cat in that silky voice of his, `I just wanted to know exactly what we both meant today about Aslan meaning no more than Tash.\x{2019} `Doubtless, most sagacious of cats,\x{2019} says the other, `you have perceived my meaning.\x{2019} `You mean,\x{2019} says Ginger, `that there\x{2019}s no such person as either.\x{201d} \x{201c}All who are enlightened know that,\x{2019} said the Tarkaan. `Then we can understand one another,\x{2019} purrs the Cat. `Do you, like me, grow a little weary of the Ape?\x{2019} `A stupid, greedy brute,\x{2019} says the other, `but we must use him for the present. Thou and I must provide for all things in secret and make the Ape do our will.\x{2019} `And it would be better, wouldn\x{2019}t it,\x{2019} said Ginger, `to let some of the more enlightened Narnians into our counsels: one by one as we find them apt. For the Beasts who really believe in Aslan may turn at any moment: and will, if the Ape\x{2019}s folly betrays his secret. But those who care neither for Tash nor Aslan but have only an eye to their own profit and such reward as The Tisroc may give them when Narnia is a Calormene province, will be firm.\x{2019} `Excellent Cat,\x{2019} said the Captain. `But choose which ones carefully.\x{201d}\x{2018}",
