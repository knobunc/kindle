            "Pendennis and St Mawes castles stand on headlands proudly facing each other across the mouth of the River Fal on the south-western tip of the Cornish coast. Guarding the estuary and anchorage known as Carrick Roads, near to Falmouth, they are perfect surviving examples of the scheme of coastal fortification constructed on Henry VIII\x{2019}s orders <<after 1539|18:0>>. They were intended to be, quite literally, the last bastion of defence in the event of an invasion by the Catholic powers of Europe.",

            "Born <<around 1540|18:0>> of humble yeoman stock, Francis Drake\x{2019}s life at sea began when he was apprenticed to the master of a small coasting ship. He was the eldest of the eleven children of Edmund Drake, a lay preacher whose fervent Protestant faith helped to shape Drake\x{2019}s sense of personal destiny. Another crucial ingredient in Drake\x{2019}s formation occurred on a slaving voyage with John Hawkins in 1568: the English captains were tricked, ambushed and defeated by the Spanish at the Battle of San Juan d\x{2019}Ulua off the coast of Mexico, inciting Drake\x{2019}s life-long hatred of Catholic Spain and his determination to avenge England at sea.",

            "If Ralegh\x{2019}s castle isn\x{2019}t Tudor enough for you, just down the road is the golden-coloured Sandford Orcas Manor House. This virtually unknown gem is a wonderful sixteenth-century house that you can tour, for a small fee, with owner Sir Mervyn Medlycott. The current family has owned the house since 1736, and it was restored in 1978. The Great Hall dates from <<around 1550|9c:0>>: the fireplace and splendid eighteen mullion windows are original, though the furniture and panelling are Jacobean. There is a \x{2018}solar room\x{2019} above the Hall with the same mullion windows and a Jacobean four-poster bed from <<1620|9c:0>>. Note the spiral staircases, indoor porches, gatehouse and garderobe. Look out for the leather Tudor children\x{2019}s shoes, found behind a cabinet where they had probably been put to ward off evil, and some fine examples of Elizabethan blackwork (decorative embroidery), including a bodice and coif (linen cap), embroidered with gold thread.",

The Great Kitchen retains its two huge fireplaces and a separate bread oven. The best bedchamber, now Lady Yate\x{2019}s Room, has Elizabethan panelling from floor to ceiling, with an ornate overmantle and ensuite garderobe, dropping to the moat. The simple sixteenth-century panelling continues onto the fourteenth-century walls of the Withdrawing Room, but it is the Great Chamber that would have had the most striking panelling, richly painted in red, black and yellow to imitate inlay. Fragments survive in two corners, and the ornately decorated door into Mermaid\x{2019}s Passage gives some sense of the overall effect.",

            "If you were suddenly transported back in time, you\x{2019}d probably find the house surprisingly garish, but wealthy Tudor houses were distinguished by their use of bold, extravagant colour and elaborate ornamentation. You can see this in the rare examples of Elizabethan wall painting at Harvington. Mermaid\x{2019}s Passage features exquisite arabesque paintings of scrolls, shells, flowers, birds, animals and the eponymous mermaids, in an Italianate style reminiscent of the panels from Nonsuch Palace [see LOSELEY PARK]. The Nine Worthies Passage is adorned with almost life-size images of the Nine Worthies (legendary and biblical heroes) and the Great Staircase features shadow painting from <<1600|9c:0>>. The small chapel also has walls emblazoned with rather lurid rows of red and white drops to represent the blood and water that flowed from Christ\x{2019}s side. Also, don\x{2019}t miss the glorious carved Elizabethan four-poster bed, from 1590, in the Priest\x{2019}s Room, and a more recent example of craftsmanship: the chimneypiece in the Great Chamber, which was made in Elizabethan style in 1996 following descriptions from <<1600|9c:0>>.",

The major differences are that in the early eighteenth century, the Great Hall was significantly reduced in size and several rooms were demolished, but what remains is authentic.
