The freshening western breeze swept the crenellations, drying the sweat on the commander\x{2019}s face and neck; in no hurry to climb back down to the muddy, windless streets, he chatted with Bluto about various aspects of the morning\x{2019}s battle.",

He flipped the coal-tipped stub spinning out over the rail, and watched it draw random red arabesques as it tumbled toward the square far below; then he turned to the wizard who was crouched over the telescope. \x{201c}Aren\x{2019}t we about due for\x{2014}\x{201d} the Irishman began, but he was interrupted by the preludial mechanical grinding from above, so he closed his eyes and shoved his fingers in his ears until the single bong had been stuck, and the echoes were ringing away through the dark streets below.",
