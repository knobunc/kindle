next to my parents\' bedroom where my mother still lay in bed. It was a matter
of chance, and strategy, too. It was the latest place that I had found to stay
hidden awhile after the <<midday|13>> meal until the coast was clear and I could slip
away without being given an afternoon job;
so far, nobody had thought of looking there for me. It was simply a matter of
putting in half an hour or so. Normally the room was very convenient, though
just at present its use required caution because the wattle wall between the
rooms was cracked and I had to move very cautiously on tiptoe lest my mother should
hear me.',

out for ourselves; a very crude fumbling
to begin with, but then more skilful when we had discovered one another and
begun to learn by practice. With Petra it was different. Already, at <<six|9:1>> and a
half, she had had a power of projection in a different class from ours, and
quite overwhelming \x{2014} but without
realization, and therefore with no control whatever. I did my best to explain
to her, but even at her present age of almost eight the necessity of putting it
in words that were simple enough presented a difficulty. After an hour of
trying to make it clear to her while we sat on the river-bank watching our
floats, I still had not got anywhere much, and she was growing too bored to try
to understand what I said. Another kind of approach seemed to be required.",
