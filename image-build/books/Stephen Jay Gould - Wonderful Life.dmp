            "1.16. The iconography of the cone of increasing diversity, as seen in six examples from textbooks. All these diagrams are presented as simple objective portrayals of evolution; none are explicit representations of diversification as opposed to some other evolutionary process. Three abstract examples (A\x{2013}C) are followed by conventional views of three specific phylogenies\x{2013}vertebrate (D), arthropod (E), and mammalian (F, on p. 42). The data of the Burgess Shale falsify this central view of arthropod evolution as a continuous process of increasing diversification.
<<1.16|5a:0>> A conventional view of mammalian phylogeny.
In another recent example, showing that this error infests technical as well as lay discourse, an editorial in Science, the leading scientific journal in America, constructs an order every bit as motley and senseless as White\x{2019}s \x{201c}regular gradation\x{201d} (see figure 1.3). Commenting on species commonly used for laboratory work, the editors discuss the \x{201c}middle range\x{201d} between unicellular creatures and guess who at the apex: \x{201c}Higher on the evolutionary ladder,\x{201d} we learn, \x{201c}the nematode, the fly and the frog have the advantage of complexity beyond the single cell, but represent far simpler species than mammals\x{201d} (June 10, 1988).",

            'Harry Whittington, who shares this rare visual genius, also expressed his gift at an early age. Harry began with no particular advantages of class or culture. He grew up in Birmingham, the son of a gunsmith (who died when Harry was only two) and grandson of a tailor (who then raised him). His interests wandered toward geology, thanks largely to the inspiration of a sixth-form (just pre-university) geography teacher. Yet Harry had always recognized and exploited his skill in three-dimensional visualization. As a child, he loved to build models, mostly of cars and airplanes, and his favorite toy was his Meccano set (the British version of an Erector set, providing strips of steel that can be bolted together into a variety of structures). In beginning geology courses, he excelled in map interpretation and, especially, in drawing block diagrams. The consistent theme is unmistakable: a knack for making three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional components, and inversely, for depicting solid objects in plane view. This ability to move from <<two to three|10a:0>> dimensions, and back again, provided the key for reconstructing the fauna of the Burgess Shale.',

            "Whittington began, as would any paleontologist who believes in cranking up slowly and deliberately, with the genus Marrella, the most common organism in the Burgess Shale. Marrella splendens overwhelms anything else in the Burgess by sheer abundance. Walcott collected more than 12,000 specimens. Whittington\x{2019}s party gathered another 800, and I am custodian to 200 more, collected by Percy Raymond in 1930. Many Burgess species are known from fewer than ten specimens, some from only <<one|9c:0>>. But with nearly 13,000 potential views, one need hardly worry about destroying unique evidence by dissection, or failing to find a crucial orientation.",

Segments <<11\x{2013}13|5a:0>> are cylindrical and carry no appendages, while the last, or fourteenth, segment forms a flattened telson, or tail. Again, this arrangement of segments and appendages departs strongly from the standard trilobite pattern of biramous limbs on each body segment. Yohoia, with its great appendage in front, and curious arrangement of limbs behind, was an orphan among arthropods.",

These are his camera lucida drawings of three specimens, in varying orientations, each combining features from the part and counterpart of the same specimen. Figure 3.24 provides a view from above (dorsal). We see the position of the eyes and nozzle, the full sequence of lateral lobes, and the gills lying above the lobes. The gut runs as a straight tube down the middle of the body. Figure 3.25 is a side view and reveals several features that could not be seen from the top. We now discern the point of attachment for the nozzle, and we note that the gut bends in a U to form the rearward-facing mouth. (In top view, the bend and rearward section collapse upon the straight portion and cannot be distinguished at all.) The top view also tells us nothing about the relative positions of lateral lobes and tail fins, for these are collapsed into the same plane. But the side view of figure 3.25 shows the lateral lobes pointing downward and away from the body, while the tail fins stand high and point upward\x{2014}in good positions, respectively, for oars and rudders.",

The terminal mouth (smack in the middle of the front surface) is surrounded by six or seven papillae. The head appendages bear three spinelike branches at their tip, and three additional spines along the anterior margin.

Its head (figure 3.46) bears one pair of antennae, and no other appendages! Bruton came to regard Sidneyia as a curious mosaic of characters. The first <<four of nine|10>> body segments carry uniramous walking legs like those of merostomes. But the five posterior segments bear ordinary biramous appendages, with gill branches and walking legs. The \x{201c}tail\x{201d} piece, formed of three cylindrical segments and a caudal fan, looks more crustacean than merostomoid. Bruton found ostracodes, hyolithids, and small trilobites in Sidneyia\x{2019}s gut, and interpreted the animal as a bottom-dwelling carnivore. But with no feeding appendages on the head, and a strong, tooth-lined food groove between the legs, Sidneyia presumably fed like most arthropods, by passing food toward the mouth from the rear, not by searching and grasping from the front.",
