Equus is the only twig left, and hence the tip of a ladder in our false iconography. Horses have become the classic example of progressive evolution because their bush has been so unsuccessful.

His interests wandered toward geology, thanks largely to the inspiration of a sixth-form (just pre-university) geography teacher. Yet Harry had always recognized and exploited his skill in three-dimensional visualization. As a child, he loved to build models, mostly of cars and airplanes, and his favorite toy was his Meccano set (the British version of an Erector set, providing strips of steel that can be bolted together into a variety of structures). In beginning geology courses, he excelled in map interpretation and, especially, in drawing block diagrams.

However, as Whittington studied hundreds of specimens, he slowly began to discover consistent, and probably fundamental, differences between the appendages of Marrella and those of all known trilobites. Whittington admitted, of course, that the basic structures are similar. This overall resemblance had never been doubted, and Whittington quoted St\x{f8}rmer\x{2019}s own words to emphasize the point: \x{201c}These appendages are \x{2018}more or less trilobite-like\x{2019} (St\x{f8}rmer, 1959, p. 26) in the general sense that there is a segmented walking leg and a filament-bearing gill branch\x{201d} (Whittington, 1971, p. 21). But the differences began to impress Whittington even more. The walking leg of Marrella, with its six sections and terminal spines (see figure <<3.15|5a:0>>), bears one or two fewer segments than the standard and scarcely varying number in trilobites. Whittington concluded: \x{201c}Neither branch is like that of any known trilobite, the walking leg having one (or two?) segments less than known in trilobites, the filament-bearing branch being differently constructed\x{201d} (1971, p. 7).",

Further, the head appendages are arranged just right, with two pairs of short, uniramous antennae in front of the mouth, and three pairs of ventral appendages behind the mouth.* The abdominal segments bear no appendages, but each thoracic segment carries a pair of standard biramous appendages, with an inner leg branch and a broad outer gill branch (figures <<3.37|5a:0>> and <<3.38|5a:0>>).",

These valves, discrete and shiny on most fossils, make Naraoia one of the most striking and attractive of Burgess organisms, but they also impose a severe problem in interpretation. They cover almost all the soft anatomy; most specimens show only the distal tips of the appendages, protruding out beyond the edge of the carapace (figure <<3.39|5a:1>>).

He realized that he could dissect through the firm carapace to reveal the proximal ends of the appendages, and their points of insertion. When he cut through the carapace of Naraoia (figure <<3.40|5a:0>>), he uncovered enough of the appendages to count their segments and resolve their proximal ends, including gnathobases and food grooves. Whittington also received one of the great surprises of his professional life. He was looking at a leg branch of the animal he knew best\x{2014}a trilobite. But beyond a vague similarity in general outline, the carapace, with its two valves, hardly resembles the exoskeleton of a trilobite.

Walcott accepted the standard view that this fossil represented the rear end of a crustacean, with the long axis as the trunk and the ventral spines as appendages (figure <<3.60|5a:0>>). Charles R. Knight followed this tradition in his famous painting of the Burgess fauna (see figure 1.1), where he constructed a composite organism by attaching Anomalocaris to Tuzoia, one of the bivalved arthropod carapaces that lacked associated soft parts and was therefore a good candidate for the cover of Anomalocaris\x{2019}s unknown head.",

            "Walcott\x{2019}s second chart (figure 4.9) illustrates the tyranny of the cone in an even more striking manner. Walcott claimed that five distinct lineages could be recognized among Burgess arthropods\x{2014}the extinct trilobites, and four prominent groups of organisms inhabiting modern waters. Again, he used two devices to compress Burgess disparity into the narrow end of a cone. First, he showed all five lineages as converging toward the bottom (subtly for four, perhaps because he felt sheepish about making such an assertion with no supporting data at all; more boldly, with a distinct angular bend, for the merostome lineage, where he adduced some evidence\x{2014}see below). Second, he placed all these contemporaneous fossils at different positions on his vertical branches, implying that they represented evolutionary diversification through time. On the merostome branch, he lined up eight genera (five of which are known only as contemporaries in the Burgess Shale) to forge a hypothetical link between merostomes and crustaceans: \x{201c}Such forms as Habelia, Molaria and Emeraldella serve to fill in the gap between the Branchiopoda and the Merostomata as represented by Sidneyia and later the eurypterids\x{201d} (1912, p. 163). Finally, figure <<4.10|5a:1>> shows Walcott\x{2019}s last and most abstract phylogeny for the Burgess arthropods.

We can arrange these fossils by outward appearance, as tubes, spines, cones, and plates (figure 5.7 shows a representative sample), but we do not know their zoological affinities. Perhaps they are merely bits and pieces from an era of early, still imperfect skeletonization; perhaps they covered familiar organisms that later developed the more elaborate shells of their conventional fossil signatures. But perhaps\x{2014}and this interpretation has recently been gaining favor among aficionados of the small shelly fauna\x{2014}most of the Tommotian oddballs represent unique anatomies that arose early and disappeared quickly.
