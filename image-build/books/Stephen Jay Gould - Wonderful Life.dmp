            'Harry Whittington, who shares this rare visual genius, also expressed his gift at an early age. Harry began with no particular advantages of class or culture. He grew up in Birmingham, the son of a gunsmith (who died when Harry was only two) and grandson of a tailor (who then raised him). His interests wandered toward geology, thanks largely to the inspiration of a sixth-form (just pre-university) geography teacher. Yet Harry had always recognized and exploited his skill in three-dimensional visualization. As a child, he loved to build models, mostly of cars and airplanes, and his favorite toy was his Meccano set (the British version of an Erector set, providing strips of steel that can be bolted together into a variety of structures). In beginning geology courses, he excelled in map interpretation and, especially, in drawing block diagrams. The consistent theme is unmistakable: a knack for making three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional components, and inversely, for depicting solid objects in plane view. This ability to move from <<two to three|10a:0>> dimensions, and back again, provided the key for reconstructing the fauna of the Burgess Shale.',

Whittington combined this anatomical information with other data to reconstruct an interesting and unusual life style for Aysheaia. On or near six of the nineteen Aysheaia specimens he found remains of sponges\x{2014}an association hardly ever encountered with other Burgess animals. Whittington conjectured that Aysheaia might have fed on sponges and lived among them for protection as well (figure 3.43). The tiny terminal claws of the limbs would not have worked on mud, but might have helped in climbing upon sponges and holding on. The anterior appendages could not have swept food directly into the mouth, but they might have lacerated sponges with their spines, permitting the animal to lap up nutritious juices and soft tissues. The backward-facing claws and spines of the posterior body limbs might have functioned as anchors to keep the animal in place at odd angles.",
