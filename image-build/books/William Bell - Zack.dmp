For centuries before Columbus landed in the so-called New World (to the millions of people already living here it was the same old place), the Trace had been a major trail used by Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians. Later, Hernando de Soto\x{2014}whoever he was, I thought, imagining a frown of displeasure on The Book\x{2019}s chubby face\x{2014}had followed it. So had the explorer Meriwether Lewis and the Indian-killer and someday president Andrew Jackson. The Trace became a post road <<after 1800|18:0>>. Most of the travellers, settlers and merchants who floated their wares on timber barges down the Mississippi River to Natchez, sold the boats because they couldn\x{2019}t be poled back upriver against the current. Then they hiked back north on the Trace.",
