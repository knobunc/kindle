The ones in the Walmart electronics department were more expensive than the \$300 she\x{2019}d allotted, so they tried a nearby GameStop, and Family Dollar, and then they went back to Walmart, which had turned out to have the best deal after all. Before they checked out, she and Charlie decided they needed a few groceries. \x{201c}So when we got into the grocery section\x{2014}mind you, I was the one, I was buying the items that night, I was the one who had the money\x{2014}and Charlie wanted a box of Steak-umms. And to make a long story short, when we would use his money to go to the grocery store, everything had to be bought as a meal. You know, everything had to be a meal. And he picked up these Steak-umms and he said he wanted to get those and he was going to take them home and fix them. And, of course, I\x{2019}m like, but you can\x{2019}t do that because everything has to be a meal. You know, we\x{2019}re planning our money out. We have to get enough to make meals that will last.
