It needed to be, for this was the most difficult of all the operations. One tooth was obviously more badly infected than he had expected. I even had to go into the next-door surgery during the operation so that he could use the extra-high-speed drill there. He also took out one of the roots of the tooth, and also a nerve, which gave quite a lot of pain. Mr Powell kept apologising, but I felt at least that I was getting my moneys worth.

Thomas scavenged amongst the food, and was to be seen eating vast chunks of French bread on and off for about an hour.

Down by the sea, surrounded by high basalt cliffs, it was tremendously peaceful. The calm of the sea affected me, made me feel relaxed and gave me a great sense of well-being. The sea, waves gently turning over on the shore, is so tranquil compared to the antics of the people who want to get near it \x{2013} the amusement arcades, the 6d telescopes, the hotels with greasy food, the guest houses with sharp-tongued landladies, the trousers rolled up, the windbreaks, the beach-trays, the sand-filled picnics, the real Devon cream ices, the traffic jams at Exeter, the slacks, the sun oil \x{2013} all of this endured in order to get near the sea. Two-thirds of the world\x{2019}s surface is water, why should seaside resorts always seem to have so little room?",

The 35mm camera was another impressive sign that this was a film, as were the many people whose sole job seemed to be to look after us, give us calls when we were required, fetch us coffee if we wanted it, and generally keep us sweet. But our mirth was great when we saw a man struggling to stick an \x{2018}Eric Idle\x{2019} sign on the back of a picnic chair. Did we really all have chairs with our name on? Yes we really did and, by the end of an eleven and a half hour-day, with only a half-hour break at lunch, I realised that the caravan, the chairs and the ever-helpful production assistants were there to help us work harder, and they were vital. To have a place to relax in after a take, without having to worry about finding out what is happening next, is a luxury we never had on television filming.",

I wasn\x{2019}t unduly concerned where I slept, so they must have been quite relieved at my reaction, but then I found that I had been quartered, not in a separate room, but in a small bed in John Cleese\x{2019}s room. This did niggle me, partly because John\x{2019}s room smelt of stale cigarette smoke, and I was feeling quite fragile in the abdominal area, and also because of the attitude of the lady who had arrived for my room. There was no word of apology \x{2013} she was merely concerned to let me know what an inconvenient day she\x{2019}d had. I went to bed ruffled. John arrived in a mellow mood <<about 1.15|5a:0>> and offered me brandy. I remember reacting to this with a slight feeling of nausea.",

The huge ceiling is studded with twinkling stars and above the proscenium and along the side walls are passageways, alcoves, balconies, in Spanish-Oriental style, with lights in as if for the start of a massive Shakespearean production. It\x{2019}s a magnificent folly \x{2013} and it seems an obvious target for developers. However, it continues in being as a rock concert theatre \x{2013} probably helped by the decision of the Albert Hall not to stage any more rock concerts.",

But also because it was at last something new in the midsummer wilderness of repeats.

Afterwards he pottered around the house, looking in all the rooms, trying to make helpful comments, but they generally came out as grumbles. His life is very much geared to his current obsessions, and these obsessions are nearly always anxieties and problems. There seems to be nothing that makes him happy any more. He told me he dislikes all the nurses, and clearly he is finding it very difficult to be told what to do by people who, as he says, \x{2018}have an inferiority complex\x{2019} (a social inferiority complex, he means), which they take out on him.
