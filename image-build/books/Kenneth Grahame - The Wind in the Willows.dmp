            "Alastair was about the same age Grahame had been when he arrived at his grandmother\x{2019}s home. The memories flooded back. As he later told Constance Smedley, who encouraged him to write down the stories of Toad: \x{201c}I feel I should never be surprised to meet myself as I was when a little chap of five, suddenly coming round a corner.... I can remember everything I felt then, the part of my brain I used from <<four|9c:0>> till about seven can never have altered\x{201d} (Green, p. 17). Grahame\x{2019}s distinctive power as a writer for children stems from the immediate, vivid access he had to his past, the sensations and joys concretely expressed in The Wind in the Willows.",

            "And what a play it had been! Drowsy animals, snug in their holes while wind and rain were battering at their doors, recalled still keen mornings, an hour before sunrise, when the white mist, as yet undispersed, clung closely along the surface of the water; then the shock of the early plunge, the scamper along the bank, and the radiant transformation of earth, air, and water, when suddenly the sun was with them again, and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the earth once more. They recalled the languorous siestaof hot <<midday|13>>, deep in green undergrowth, the sun striking through in tiny golden shafts and spots; the boating and bathing of the afternoon, the rambles along dusty lanes and through yellow cornfields; and the long cool evening at last, when so many threads were gathered up, so many friendships rounded, and so many adventures planned for the morrow. There was plenty to talk about on those short winter days when the animals found themselves round the fire; still, the Mole had a good deal of spare time on his hands, and so one afternoon, when the Rat in his arm-chair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over rhymes that wouldn\x{2019}t fit, he formed the resolution to go out by himself and explore the Wild Wood, and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with Mr. Badger.",

            "The Willow-Wren was twittering his thin little song, hidden himself in the dark selvedge of the river bank. Though it was <<past ten o\x{2019}clock at night|6>>, the sky still clung to and retained some lingering skirts of light from the departed day; and the sullen heats of the torrid afternoon broke up and rolled away at the dispersing touch of the cool fingers of the short midsummer night. Mole lay stretched on the bank, still panting from the stress of the fierce day that had been cloudless from dawn to late sunset, and waited for his friend to return. He had been on the river with some companions, leaving the Water Rat free to keep an engagement of long standing with Otter; and he had come back to find the house dark and deserted, and no sign of Rat, who was doubtless keeping it up late with his old comrade. It was still too hot to think of staying indoors, so he lay on some cool dock-leaves, and thought over the past day and its doings, and how very good they all had been.",

will be sung in the course of the evening by the... COMPOSERThe idea pleased him mightily, and he worked very hard and got all the letters finished by <<noon|13>>, at which hour it was reported to him that there was a small and rather bedraggled weasel at the door, inquiring timidly whether he could be of any service to the gentlemen. Toad swaggered out and found it was one of the prisoners of the previous evening, very respectful and anxious to please. He patted him on the head, shoved the bundle of invitations into his paw, and told him to cut along quick and deliver them as fast as he could, and if he liked to come back again in the evening perhaps there might be a shilling for him, or, again, perhaps there mightn\x{2019}t; and the poor weasel seemed really quite grateful, and hurried off eagerly to do his mission.",

            "11 (p. 136) \x{201c}Like Summer Tempests Came His Tears\x{201d}: The title for this chapter is a variation on lines from Alfred Tennyson\x{2019}s 1847 narrative poem \x{201c}The Princess: A Medley\x{201d}: \x{201c}Rose a nurse of ninety years,/ Set his child upon her knee\x{2014}/Like summer tempest came her tears\x{2014}/\x{2018}Sweet my child, I live for thee!\x{2019} \x{201d} (part 6, lines <<13-16|5a:0>>). Tennyson\x{2019}s mock-heroic poem concerns a princess who founds a university for women and, in order to preserve it from the encroachment of men, imposes a death penalty on male intruders. When a prince enters in disguise, the princess is forced to admit her failure. She marries the prince only after it is clear he shares her views, and together they strive to free women from oppressive societal strictures. Tennyson was a peripheral member of Frederick James Furnivall\x{2019}s Early English Text Society and his New Shakespeare Society, to which Grahame belonged. Grahame\x{2019}s readers would have recognized the echo of Tennyson in this title, which points to Toad\x{2019}s despair at losing Toad Hall to the stoats and weasels and to the resolution of his friends to help him reform and reclaim his home.",
