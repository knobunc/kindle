            "We sat at a table and fingered our glasses: I had never had much to say to Henry. I doubt whether I should ever have troubled to know Henry or Sarah well if I had not begun in 1939 to write a story with a senior civil servant as the main character. Henry James once, in a discussion with Walter Besant, said that a young woman with sufficient talent need only pass the mess-room windows of a Guards\x{2019} barracks and look inside in order to write a novel about the Brigade, but I think at some stage of her book she would have found it necessary to go to bed with a Guardsman if only in order to check on the details. I didn\x{2019}t exactly go to bed with Henry, but I did the next best thing, and the first night I took Sarah out to dinner I had the cold-blooded intention of picking the brain of a civil servant\x{2019}s wife. She didn\x{2019}t know what I was at; she thought, I am sure, I was genuinely interested in her family life, and perhaps that first awakened her liking for me. What time did Henry have breakfast? I asked her. Did he go to the office by tube, bus or taxi? Did he bring his work home at night? Did he have a briefcase with the royal arms on it? Our friendship blossomed under my interest: she was so pleased that anybody should take Henry seriously. Henry was important, but important rather as an elephant is important, from the size of his department; there are some kinds of importance that remain hopelessly damned to unseriousness. Henry was an important assistant secretary in the Ministry of Pensions\x{2014}later it was to be the Ministry of Home Security. Home Security\x{2014}I used to laugh at that later in those moments when you hate your companion and look for any weapon \x{2026} A time came when I deliberately told Sarah that I had only taken Henry up for the purpose of copy, copy too for a character who was the ridiculous, the comic element in my book. It was then she began to dislike my novel. She had an enormous loyalty to Henry (I could never deny that), and in those clouded hours when the demon took charge of my brain and I resented even harmless Henry, I would use the novel and invent episodes too crude to write \x{2026} Once when Sarah had spent a whole night with me (I had looked forward to it as a writer looks forward to the last word of his book) I had spoilt the occasion suddenly by a chance word which broke the mood of what sometimes seemed for hours at a time a complete love. I had fallen sullenly asleep about two and woke at <<three|9b>>, and putting my hand on her arm woke Sarah. I think I had meant to make everything well again, until my victim turned her face, bleary and beautiful with sleep and full of trust, towards me. She had forgotten the quarrel, and I found even in her forgetfulness a new cause. How twisted we humans are, and yet they say a God made us; but I find it hard to conceive of any God who is not as simple as a perfect equation, as clear as air. I said to her, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve lain awake thinking of Chapter Five. Does Henry ever eat coffee beans to clear his breath before an important conference?\x{2019} She shook her head and began to cry silently, and I of course pretended not to understand the reason\x{2014}a simple question, it had been worrying me about my character, this was not an attack on Henry, the nicest people sometimes eat coffee beans \x{2026} So I went on. She wept awhile and went to sleep. She was a good sleeper, and I took even her power to sleep as an added offence.",

            "I expect it was the rum that made him speak, or was he partly aware of how much I knew about him? Sarah was loyal, but in a relationship such as ours had been you can\x{2019}t help picking up a thing or two \x{2026} I knew he had a mole on the left of his navel because a birthmark of my own had once reminded Sarah of it: I knew he suffered from short sight, but wouldn\x{2019}t wear glasses with strangers (and I was still enough of a stranger never to have seen him in them): I knew his liking for tea at <<ten|9c:1>>: I even knew his sleeping habits. Was he conscious that I knew so much already, that one more fact would not alter our relation? He said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}m worried about Sarah, Bendrix.\x{2019}",

I have a vague memory now, after three years have passed, of <<vigils|13>> along the edge of the Common, watching their house from a distance, by the pond or under the portico of the eighteenth-century church, on the off-chance that the door would open and Sarah come down those unblasted and well-scoured steps. The right hour never struck. The rainy days were over and the nights were fine with frost, but like a ruined weather-house neither the man nor the woman came out; never again did I see Henry making across the Common after dusk. Perhaps he was ashamed at what he had told me, for he was a very conventional man. I write the adjective with a sneer, and yet if I examine myself I find only admiration and trust for the conventional, like the villages one sees from the high road where the cars pass, looking so peaceful in their thatch and stone, suggesting rest.',

In the morning I set myself a minimum of seven hundred and fifty words on the novel, but usually I managed to get a thousand done by <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>>. It\x{2019}s astonishing the effect of hope: the novel that had dragged all through the last year ran towards its end. I knew that Henry left for work <<around nine-thirty|5k:1>>, and the most likely hour for her to telephone was between then and <<twelve-thirty|5k:1>>. Henry had started coming home for lunch (so Parkis had told me); there was no chance of her telephoning again before <<three|9c:1>>. I would revise my day\x{2019}s work and do my letters until <<twelve-thirty|9c:1>>, and then I was released however gloomily from expectation. Until <<two-thirty|9:1>> I could put in time at the British Museum Reading Room, making notes for the life of General Gordon. I couldn\x{2019}t absorb myself in reading and note-taking as I could in writing the novel, and the thought of Sarah came between me and the missionary life in China. Why had I been invited to write this biography? I often wondered. They would have done better to have chosen an author who believed in Gordon\x{2019}s God. I could appreciate the obstinate stand at Khartoum\x{2014}the hatred of the safe politicians at home, but the Bible on the desk belonged to another world of thought from mine. Perhaps the publisher half hoped that my cynical treatment of Gordon\x{2019}s Christianity would cause a succ\x{e8}s de scandale. I had no intention of pleasing him: this God was also Sarah\x{2019}s God, and I was going to throw no stones at any phantom she believed she loved.
