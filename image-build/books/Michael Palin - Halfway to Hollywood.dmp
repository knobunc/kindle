I think how nice it would be to talk about my work to this very nice, bright group of six BNC undergraduates \x{2013} get down to some depth, think more carefully about things, accept more probing criticism, encourage more controversial questions. As it turns out this is not to be, and my talk to the BNC Arts Society is a public performance in front of 290 people packed into the JCR. I\x{2019}m ready for it and do enjoy it and we do cover quite serious matters \x{2013} censorship, religious and political convictions, etc. But really they want me to make them laugh.",
