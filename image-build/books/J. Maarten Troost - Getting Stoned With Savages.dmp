            'The dissonance was overwhelming. One day, I found myself pressed inside the Washington Metro, soaked through from a November rain, palpitating slightly as I realized I had an <<8 A.M.|5>> meeting and it was presently <<8:17 A.M.|2a>>, and just like that it occurred to me that six months earlier I could be found paddling an outrigger canoe across the sun-dappled waters of a lagoon in the South Pacific. This had been happening for some time, this juxtaposition of my former life upon my present one, and the contrast never failed to leave me twitching in bafflement. How had this happened? Huddled on the subway, I lingered on the image for a moment, far away, envisioning the canopy of palm trees swaying in the near distance, the urgent leap of a flying fish, the fishermen in sailing canoes returning with their catch, the brilliant, shimmering colors offered by a setting sun, until my reverie came to an abrupt end as the subway doors opened and I was swept into the tumult of the rush-hour commute. It was a disconcerting sensation. Blue, blue water, I thought in vain as I was shepherded onto an escalator crowded with pasty-faced suits like myself, dejected already. I tried imagining swaying palm trees as I scurried through the rain toward my office at the World Bank, flashing the color-coded ID card I kept tethered to my belt. Inside, I tried conjuring stress-free tropical living once I found on my chair a dreaded note from my boss: PLEASE SEE ME. <<7:45 A.M.|2a>> But the image was gone. Poof.',

Sighing, I loped toward the conference room, pausing briefly to catch sight of my reflection in the window, and I noted with some interest that I looked like sodden vermin. It was not going to be a good day, I knew. The conference room itself was transparent, because the World Bank values transparency, and as I approached I wondered, Is that a Bank vice president sitting there? Why, yes, it was.

After a rather exhilarating slide down a hill with my foot pressing the brake as far as it would go, we probably ought to have listened to our more sensible instincts and turned around. We drove on, however, partly because I am constitutionally incapable of backtracking, but mostly because the scenery was so alluring and each curve and every crest promised another vista of paradise. There were coconut palms with their fronds moving like languorous fans, and I was feeling tremendously pleased to be among them again. The hillsides were impressively dense and green, exuding an air of primordial wilderness. Those woods, I had read, contained a multitude of lizards, including the banded iguana, a fearsome-looking dragon that grows upwards of three feet in length. There was also the Pacific boa, an eight-foot-long snake that I hoped never to encounter. It is said that the Pacific boa is harmless, but I didn\x{2019}t believe that for a moment. Raised as a Catholic, I still find it difficult to have warm and mushy feelings toward snakes. We stopped here and there, never encountering another vehicle, and listened to the quiet buzz of insects and the lazy calls of birds slumbering in the <<midday|13>> sun. There was a torporous serenity to the island, and the lingering small pressures that remained of our lives in Washington, the urge to hurry on, to check e-mail, to do errands, evaporated with the rising heat.",

And in Vanuatu, when one considers what happened subsequent to the arrival of Westerners, it is a wonder that the Ni-Vanuatu did not kill every missionary, sandalwood trader, and colonist who landed upon their shores. Perhaps no country suffered more cruelly from the diseases introduced by Westerners than Vanuatu. Living in such isolation from the rest of the world, the Ni-Vanuatu had not acquired immunity to influenza, measles, whooping cough, and a half-dozen other ailments. What caused a sniffle in London killed in Vanuatu.

Whereas once I had been repelled by the smell of vomit, now I took it as my natural odor. In the predawn darkness, I\x{2019}d take him outside into the warm stillness of the Fijian night, and having discovered that my repertoire of lullabies consisted of little more than a line or two of dimly remembered Dutch children\x{2019}s songs, I\x{2019}d sing him a medley of U2 songs from the eighties as Saki, the night watchman, gazed at us approvingly.",

The morning of our departure, I boarded the ship in industrial Walu Bay, and as I walked across the steel deck I noticed that the ship was deeply corroded. The paint peeled. Mechanics emerged from below deck carrying rusty machine parts, which they studied with considerable interest. Belching trucks rumbled aboard.",

He took a stamp, dipped it in ink, and stamped my forearm. FIRST CLASS, it said. This pleased me enormously. It was my first time traveling anywhere first class, and the stamp on my arm made it seem extra special. First class entitled me to a berth in a four-bunk cabin, an indulgence that cost \$10 more than a standard fare. The lower classes, those not graced with stamps on their arms, were consigned to the deck. I found my cabin, deposited my backpack, and read the notice informing me that breakfast would be served between eight and nine, lunch from <<noon|13>> to one, tea from <<four to five|10a:1>>, and dinner between seven and eight. Very civilized, I thought. As far as I could tell, I was the only passenger with a first-class stamp.",

            '<<Shortly before midnight|13>>, we neared Koro Island. This should be interesting, I thought. There was no electricity on Koro. The only light available was offered by the stars. It was an extremely compact harbor, and the ship was very large. The captain and crew had spent the previous seven hours drinking buckets of kava. If it were me at the helm, I have no doubt we would have soon become one with the reef. In any event, the captain gave a few curt orders, and the ship turned around and brought its rump toward the pier in an admirable display of seamanship. They might not look like seamen, I thought. And they might all be stoned on kava. But they knew what they were doing. A few more trucks rumbled aboard, and soon we were cruising again through the darkness.',

            "<<Two A.M.|5>> passed. Most of the passengers were asleep on the benches. Though I was exhausted, I couldn\x{2019}t sleep. I had tried to retire to my first-class bunk, but with every roll of the boat there followed a discordant creaking of metal grinding on metal. It was the kind of noise that I tend to fixate on, and after a half hour, I was reduced to a state of frothing insensibility. Resigned, I sat on the deck and watched the slow drift of stars moving over the sea. Seventeen hours on a ferry was beginning to feel very much like seventeen hours on a ferry. Indeed, I was beginning to check my watch an awful lot, wishing the time forward: <<3:02|2>>\x{2026}<<3:06|2>>\x{2026}<<3:09|2>>. Finally, at <<4 A.M.|5>>\x{2014}there\x{2019}s that time again\x{2014}we arrived at Savusavu, and the silence of the night was disturbed by the sound of a dozen trucks turning over their engines, sending forth a foul cloud of exhaust that hovered above us in the still air.",

I hadn\x{2019}t made any advance arrangement for a hotel, which now struck me as a regrettable oversight. Savusavu at <<4 A.M.|5>> was a dim and quiet place where nothing stirred except for a few dogs. I picked up a rock and trudged on. I had almost resigned myself to simply holding out until dawn, when I came across a sign pointing me toward the Hot Springs Hotel. I followed the road up a hillside, pleased to see that, if all went well, I might soon be able to put an end to this day.",
