It had not yet been incorporated into France but had been expanding its borders at France\x{2019}s expense for some time. The linguistic environment was accordingly complicated and fluid. The population was largely Christianized, at least in name (nobility very much so by <<1200|3:0>>). Since most were illiterate, essentially all of the available records fall into three categories. The first two are (1) legal records and (2) chronicles/accountings kept by the feudal lords\x{2019} stewards, but these rarely refer to women independently of their marital status. The more fruitful source therefore is (3) church documents, typically written by priests, friars, etc. in Latin or, less frequently, medieval French.",

She allowed the servants to bring Esme into the home at once and was delighted to receive the kalonji plant, the merits of which she immediately began to describe to both Esme and young Anne. Without further obstinacy, she pledged herself to being a KCW and made her residence available as a safe house. Furthermore she encouraged her daughter to do so as well, which Anne agreed to eagerly.

Note: It is already marked in DODO archives, but for ease of reference, here is additional historical context (not told to Winnifred or Anne, of course): Anne Gresham/Dutton will go on to marry Nathaniel Bacon (half brother of Sir Francis), with whom she will live in Norwich, England.

You might not think of Normandy as a hostile location. But because of France\x{2019}s ancient and secret laws banning diachronic operations, it was hostile to us. Anyway, TAST, zeroing in on a powerful GLAAMR centered on this copse of trees, had been able to carry out a couple of <<midnight|13>> digs and verify that it had been the homesite of the lineage of presumed witches we\x{2019}d seen mentioned in various church documents.

Reply from Dr. Blevins, <<15:49|2>>, same day:
Macy, apologies for the belated response, but I wanted to let you know that I just saw Gr\x{e1}inne in person, looking a little the worse for wear after her activities at the Halloween party, which have already become the stuff of internal DODO legend\x{2014}all classified, of course. As you can appreciate, the concept of calling in sick is unfamiliar to Anachrons and so I think we can overlook her failure to do so this morning.",
