Every bit, beginning with how she was born the youngest daughter of the estranged youngest son of a viscount. She had laughed at herself as she\x{2019}d described her seasons and her family\x{2019}s efforts to find her a husband\x{2014}she was too tall, too plain, and too poor to secure more than pity\x{2014}and yet her constable had looked at her as if she were beautiful. She had told him how pleased she\x{2019}d been to find a position as agreeable as governess to the Shiplans. And when her grandfather had begun to wither away, she had confided that sometime in the future a small inheritance would be hers\x{2014}very small, but enough to keep a flat of her own, if she dared defy convention and live by herself. What would it matter if she did? At <<twenty-four|9u:0>>, she was all but a spinster; in another few years, she would very firmly be one. What harm would it do if she used her money in a manner that would make her most happy?",

She had a deadline, and she was going to miss it if she didn\x{2019}t pay attention and start producing some pages.
