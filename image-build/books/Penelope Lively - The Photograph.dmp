            "<<Past six|9e>>, now swinging into the circular driveway in front of the house, she sees that everyone has gone home. Only Nick\x{2019}s Golf is parked there. During the day, there is quite a lineup of cars. Sonia, Elaine\x{2019}s personal assistant, drives from her home ten miles away. Three times a week there is Liz, who deals with the  paperwork Sonia hasn\x{2019}t time for. The red pickup belongs to Jim, who does the heavy garden work. And then there are the relays of horticultural students serving their apprenticeship in the workshop of a master, just as Elaine herself once did. The current apprentice is Pam, who is a little northern butterball, sturdy as an ox, and exuberantly sociable, which makes her good front-of-house material on Saturdays, when the garden is open to the public. Then, all hands are needed to patrol the grounds and to man the sales area, where plants are on offer, along with a judicious selection of garden implements, seeds, gift-shop paraphernalia, and books\x{2014}not least a complete display of Elaine\x{2019}s own publications. On those days, the paddock next to the driveway becomes the visitors\x{2019} car park. Sometimes Elaine herself is on hand in the garden to be graciously responsive to queries and compliments. Initially, she found this stimulating and good for the ego. Nowadays, she gets rather tired of being asked if this or that is an annual or a perennial, and how to prune a rose. She tends to retreat to the house and leave customer relations to the students, who enjoy it.",
