            "One manifestation of the changes to physics that such extra dimensions could cause would be the production of black holes. As we travel east, we are going to higher energies and shorter distances, concentrating more and more energy into a smaller and smaller space. The point of particle colliders, the machines that get us there, is that they concentrate energy like this. A proton in the LHC has a tiny energy compared to a Ping-Pong ball. If all the kinetic energy of an LHC proton were transferred to a Ping-Pong ball, the ball would move about 1 mm every ten seconds. However, there are <<about 1023|18:0>> protons in a Ping-Pong ball, so that\x{2019}s quite impressive, really, when you think about it.",

            "This cancellation is why we don\x{2019}t feel electromagnetic forces as obviously as we feel the force of gravity. But down at the subatomic level, the electromagnetic force between a proton and an electron is <<about 1043|18:0>> (one followed by forty-three zeros, or ten million billion billion billion billion) times stronger than the gravitational force. Considering this huge difference, particle physicists can ignore gravity in their calculations.28",

            "Another gravity-related problem is something currently labeled Dark Energy. From measurements of the red shift and brightness of supernovae, it seems not only that the universe is expanding outward from the Big Bang, but also that the rate of expansion is increasing. Gravity on its own would slow the expansion, as the stars and galaxies attract each other. So a new ingredient is needed to explain the acceleration. We don\x{2019}t know what this new ingredient is, but Dark Energy is the name we give to our ignorance. \x{201c}Dark\x{201d} presumably comes from analogy with Dark Matter55 and \x{201c}Energy\x{201d} comes from the fact that it needs to be some form of energy density that is constant throughout all space (unlike matter or photons, which get more spread out as space expands). The quantum loops of the Standard Model actually predict the existence of a vacuum energy like this. Unfortunately, it gets the answer wrong by a factor of 10120\x{2014}ten followed by <<120|3:0>> zeroes, a number so big I am not even going to try to spell it out in words. It is such an enormous number that even some cosmologists have trouble ignoring it. Again, maybe the answer lies to the east.",
