            'The final push, to cover all the territory on our map that might possibly contain the missing Higgs boson of the Standard Model, came from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. Colliding protons head-on at unprecedented energies, the machine is in effect the most powerful microscope ever built. It gives us access to the whole of Bosonia and beyond. And in 2012 the Higgs was indeed finally observed, first of all decaying to pairs of photons and to pairs of virtual Z bosons, but later in other decay modes, too. Its mass, <<about 125|9n:0>> giga-electron volts, or about 130 times the mass of the proton, puts it in the eastern reaches of Bosonia, but well within the range required for it to be consistent with the Standard Model.',

            "One manifestation of the changes to physics that such extra dimensions could cause would be the production of black holes. As we travel east, we are going to higher energies and shorter distances, concentrating more and more energy into a smaller and smaller space. The point of particle colliders, the machines that get us there, is that they concentrate energy like this. A proton in the LHC has a tiny energy compared to a Ping-Pong ball. If all the kinetic energy of an LHC proton were transferred to a Ping-Pong ball, the ball would move about 1 mm every ten seconds. However, there are <<about 1023|18:0>> protons in a Ping-Pong ball, so that\x{2019}s quite impressive, really, when you think about it.",

            "Sphalerons are a very exotic prediction of the Standard Model, not something beyond it. And now that we know the Higgs exists, we know they should exist, too. We even know their longitude, roughly. They ought to lie at <<about 1012|3:0>> eV. This is higher than we can observe in LHC collisions, because even though the proton-proton collision energy is higher than that, the energy of the collision is\x{a0}shared among many quarks and gluons, and so not all of it is available\x{a0}for making new objects. (Remember, colliders are all about concentrating energy). But the energy at which sphalerons should appear is not ridiculously high.",

Each has two perpendicular arms two and a half miles long. An infrared laser beam is split, and half is sent up each arm. The beam is reflected more than 200 times, and the sensitivity is designed to be <<one-ten|5k:0>> thousandth of the width of the proton, or a ten billionth of a nanometer. The technology required\x{2014}accurate, efficient mirrors, powerful, stable laser, and so on\x{2014}is formidable, but the principle is simple.",

But down at the subatomic level, the electromagnetic force between a proton and an electron is <<about 1043|18:0>> (one followed by forty-three zeros, or ten million billion billion billion billion) times stronger than the gravitational force. Considering this huge difference, particle physicists can ignore gravity in their calculations.28",

            'Because gravity is not properly included in the Standard Model, if we were to go far enough east, there is definitely a distance scale, corresponding to an energy of <<around 1027|18:0>> eV, beyond which things definitely go wrong. This is the Planck scale. Gravity at this scale becomes as strong as the other forces. Singularities and infinities break out all over the place, and we have no way of understanding, or predicting, what might happen. This is a very significant failure in the ambition to describe natural phenomena within a single framework. The Standard Model is very clearly not a theory of everything, even if it co-opts general relativity as a partner.',

            "Another gravity-related problem is something currently labeled Dark Energy. From measurements of the red shift and brightness of supernovae, it seems not only that the universe is expanding outward from the Big Bang, but also that the rate of expansion is increasing. Gravity on its own would slow the expansion, as the stars and galaxies attract each other. So a new ingredient is needed to explain the acceleration. We don\x{2019}t know what this new ingredient is, but Dark Energy is the name we give to our ignorance. \x{201c}Dark\x{201d} presumably comes from analogy with Dark Matter55 and \x{201c}Energy\x{201d} comes from the fact that it needs to be some form of energy density that is constant throughout all space (unlike matter or photons, which get more spread out as space expands). The quantum loops of the Standard Model actually predict the existence of a vacuum energy like this. Unfortunately, it gets the answer wrong by a factor of 10120\x{2014}ten followed by <<120|3:0>> zeroes, a number so big I am not even going to try to spell it out in words. It is such an enormous number that even some cosmologists have trouble ignoring it. Again, maybe the answer lies to the east.",
