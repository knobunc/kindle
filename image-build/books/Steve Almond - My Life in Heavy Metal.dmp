            "Because we were a morning paper, I had to bang out my copy by <<midnight|13>>. I operated on a template involving an initial bad pun, a lengthy playlist\x{2014}adjective, adjective, song title\x{2014}and a description of the lead singer\x{2019}s hair. The rest was your standard catalog of puking yayas, flung undies, poignant duets with the rhythm guitarist back from rehab. I loved the velocity of the process: an event witnessed and recorded overnight. I loved the pressure, the glib improvisation; I loved seeing my byline the next day, all my pretty words, smelling of ink and newsprint.",

She was a nervous shopper, which I took to be a mark of her unfamiliarity with the ritual. I had all sorts of crappy ideas rattling around my head about life in Poland. I knew, vaguely, that the Poles had broken from the Soviet Bloc. But I still imagined a lumpen gulag: endless lines, bare shelves, faces like potatoes in kerchiefs. And my poor Basha trapped amid this needy vulgarity! I stood behind her and called out to the clerks: One of those! Make it <<two|9f>>! Why not? Do you have this in black?',

At <<noon|13>> I fixed myself a breakfast of eggs, sugar-cured bacon, rolls pan-fried in the fat. Then I settled down for a nap, listening to the yips of the kids on the playground below.
