She had played and sung as usual at this meeting. And all had seemed all right with her. After the meeting she had gone to  her room, saying that she was not feeling very well and was going to bed early. But by <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>>, when Clyde returned, her mother had chanced to look into her room and discovered that she was not there nor anywhere about the place. A certain bareness in connection with the room\x{2014}some trinkets and dresses removed, an old and familiar suitcase gone\x{2014}had first attracted her mother\x{2019}s attention. Then the house search proving that she was not there, Asa had gone outside to look up and down the street.

At once he went to it, curious and comprehending, for he had often wondered in what way, assuming that he ever wished to depart surreptitiously, he would notify his parents, for he knew they would never countenance his departure unless they were permitted to supervise it in every detail. And now here was Esta missing, and here was undoubtedly some such communication as he might have left. He picked it up, eager to read it, but at that moment his mother came into the room and, seeing it in his hand, exclaimed: \x{201c}What\x{2019}s that? A note? Is it from her?\x{201d} He surrendered it and she unfolded it, reading it quickly.

Mr. Squires then proceeded to explain that this hotel only paid fifteen dollars a month and board\x{2014}at the servant\x{2019}s table in the basement\x{2014}to any bell-boy at any time. But, and this information came as a most amazing revelation to Clyde, every guest for whom any of these boys did anything\x{2014}carried a bag or delivered a pitcher of water or did anything\x{2014}gave him a tip, and often quite a liberal one\x{2014}a dime, fifteen cents, a quarter, sometimes more. And these tips, as Mr. Squires explained, taken all together, averaged from four to six dollars a day\x{2014}not less and sometimes more\x{2014}most amazing pay, as Clyde now realized. His heart gave an enormous bound and was near to suffocating him at the mere mention of so large a sum. From four to six dollars! Why, that was twenty-eight to forty-two dollars a week! He could scarcely believe it. And that in addition to the fifteen dollars a month and board. And there was no charge, as  Mr. Squires now explained, for the handsome uniforms the boys wore. But it might not be worn or taken out of the place. His hours, as Mr. Squires now proceeded to explain, would be as follows: On Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, he was to work from <<six in the morning|5>> until <<noon|13>>, and then, with six hours off, from <<six in the evening|5>> until <<midnight|13>>. On Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, he need only work from <<noon|13>> until <<six|9c:1>>, thus giving him each alternate afternoon or evening to himself.

And at once he began to think of the need of a dress suit, or at least a tuxedo and trousers. Accordingly the next morning, he gained permission from Mr. Kemerer to leave at <<eleven|9c:1>> and not return before <<one|9c:1>>, and in that time he managed to find coat, trousers and a pair of patent leather shoes, as well as a white silk muffler for the money he had already saved.

But he, too, by now, as had Myra before him, feeling that Clyde was rather attractive and yet, for reasons of poverty, likely to be neglected from now on, not only by his family, but by himself as well, observed most pleasantly, and, as he hoped, compensatively: \x{201c}It\x{2019}s rather nice out, isn\x{2019}t it?

            "THE days lapsed and, although no further word came from the Griffiths, Clyde was still inclined to exaggerate the importance of this one contact and to dream from time to time of delightful meetings with those girls and how wonderful if a love affair with one of them might eventuate for him. The beauty of that world in which they moved. The luxury and charm as opposed to this of which he was a part. Dillard! Rita! Tush! They were really dead for him. He aspired to this other or nothing as he saw it now and proceeded to prove as distant to Dillard as possible, an attitude which by degrees tended to alienate that youth entirely for he saw in Clyde a snob which potentially he was if he could have but won to what he desired. However, as he began to see afterwards, time passed and he was left to work until, depressed by the routine, meager pay and commonplace shrinking-room contacts, he began to think not so much of returning to Rita or Dillard,\x{2014}he could not quite think of them now with any satisfaction, but of giving up this venture here and returning to Chicago or going to New York, where he was sure that he could connect himself with some hotel if need be. But then, as if to revive his courage and confirm his earlier dreams, a thing happened which caused him to think that certainly he was beginning to rise in the estimation of the Griffiths father and son\x{2014}whether they troubled to entertain him socially or not. For it chanced that one Saturday in spring, Samuel Griffiths decided to make a complete tour of inspection of the factory with Joshua Whiggam at his elbow. Reaching the shrinking department <<about noon|13>>, he observed for the first time with some dismay, Clyde in his undershirt and trousers working at the feeding end of two of the shrinking racks, his nephew having by this time acquired the necessary skill to \x{201c}feed\x{201d} as well as \x{201c}take.\x{201d} And recalling how very neat and generally presentable he had appeared at his house but a few weeks before, he was decidedly disturbed by the contrast. For one thing he had felt about Clyde, both in Chicago and here at his home, was that he had presented a neat and pleasing appearance. And he, almost as much as his son, was jealous, not only of the name, but the general social appearance of the Griffiths before the employees of this factory as well as the community at large. And the sight of Clyde here, looking so much like Gilbert and in an armless shirt and trousers working among these men, tended to impress upon him more sharply than at any time before the fact that Clyde was his nephew, and that he ought not to be compelled to continue at this very menial form of work any longer. To the other employees it might appear that he was unduly indifferent to the meaning of such a relationship.",

There must be some little place in one of the departments where he can be fitted in as the head of something, first or second or third assistant to some one, and where he can wear a decent suit of clothes and look like somebody.

And the few trees in front were pleasant. What was Roberta doing now? Why couldn\x{2019}t she have waited for him in the factory? Why couldn\x{2019}t she sense now that he was outside and come out? He wished intensely that in some way he could make her feel that he was out here, and so cause her to come out. But she didn\x{2019}t. On the contrary, he observed Mr. Shurlock issue forth and disappear toward Central Avenue. And, after that, pedestriam after pedestraim making their way out of different houses along the street and toward Cental, which caused him to walk briskly about the block in order to avoid being seen. At the same time he sighed often, because it was such a fine night\x{2014}a full moon rising <<about nine-thirty|5k:1>> and hanging heavy and yellow over the chimney tops. He was so lonely.",

            "Immediately he decided not to answer any questions in regard to this letter, since it promised a quick solution of the mystery of the perpetrator of the crime, if there had been one, plus exceptional credit in the present political situation to  whosoever should appear to be instrumental in the same. At the same time he at once ordered Earl Newcomb, as well as the guide who had brought Roberta and Clyde to Big Bittern, to return to Gun Lodge station from where the couple had come and say that under no circumstances was the bag held there to be surrendered to any one save himself or a representative of the district attorney. Then, when he was about to telephone to Biltz to ascertain whether there was such a family as Alden possessing a daughter by the name of Bert, or possibly Alberta, he was most providentially, as it seemed to him, interrupted by two men and a boy, trappers and hunters of this region, who, accompanied by a crowd of those now familiar with the tragedy, were almost tumultuously ushered into his presence. For they had news\x{2014}news of the utmost importance! As they now related, with many interruptions and corrections, at <<about five o\x{2019}clock|6>> of the afternoon of the day on which Roberta was drowned, they were setting out from Three Mile Bay, some twelve miles south of Big Bittern, to hunt and fish in and near this lake. And, as they now unanimously testified, on the night in question, at <<about nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>, as they were nearing the south shore of Big Bittern\x{2014}perhaps three miles to the south of it\x{2014}they had encountered a young man, whom they took to be some stranger making his way from the inn at Big Bittern south to the village at Three Mile Bay. He was a smartishly and decidedly well dressed youth for these parts, as they now said\x{2014}wearing a straw hat and carrying a bag, and at the time they wondered why such a trip on foot and at such an hour since there was a train south early next morning which reached Three Mile Bay in an hour\x{2019}s time. And why, too, should he have been so startled at meeting them? For as they described it, on his encountering them in the woods thus, he had jumped back as though startled and worse\x{2014}terrified\x{2014}as though about to run. To be sure, the lantern one of them was carrying was turned exceedingly low, the moon being still bright, and they had walked quietly, as became men who were listening for wild life of any kind. At the same time, surely this was a perfectly safe part of the country, traversed for the most part by honest citizens such as themselves, and there was no need for a young man to jump as though he were seeking to hide in the brush. However, when the youth, Bud Brunig, who carried the light, turned it  up to the stranger seemed to recover his poise and after a moment in response to their \x{201c}Howdy\x{201d} had replied: \x{201c}How do you do? How far is it to Three Mile Bay?\x{201d} and they had replied, \x{201c}About seven mile.\x{201d} And then he had gone on and they also, discussing the encounter.",

            "\x{201c}Well now, don\x{2019}t you recall that you never asked the boatman at all? It was not thirty-five cents an hour, but fifty cents. But of course you do not know that because you were in such a hurry to get out on the water and you did not expect to have to come back and pay for it anyway. So you never even asked, you see. Do you see? Do you recall that now?\x{201d} And here Mason produced a bill that he had gotten from the boatman and waved it in front of Clyde. \x{201c}It was fifty cents an hour,\x{201d} he repeated. \x{201c}They charge more than at Grass Lake. But what I want to know is, if you are so familiar with these other figures, as you have just shown that you are, how comes it that you are not familiar with this figure? Didn\x{2019}t you think of the expense of taking her out in a boat and keeping the boat from <<noon|13>> until night?\x{201d} The attack came so swiftly and bitterly that at once Clyde was confused. He twisted and turned, swallowed and looked nervously at the floor, ashamed to look at Jephson who had somehow failed to coach him as to this.",

A lone depot assistant who on inquiry directed her to the Bridgeburg Central House\x{2014}straight up the street which now faced her, then two blocks to her left after she reached the second street. The sleepy night clerk of  the Central House providing her instantly with a room and, once he knew who she was, directing her to the county jail. But she deciding after due rumination that now was not the hour. He might be sleeping. She would go to bed and rise early in the morning. She had sent him various telegrams.

And he, depressed and forlorn, on hearing this news, welcoming the thought of her as much as at first he had dreaded her coming. For now things were different. All the long grim story had been told. And because of the plausible explanation which Jephson had provided him, he could face her perhaps and say without a quaver that it was true\x{2014}that he had not plotted to kill Roberta\x{2014}that he had not willingly left her to die in the water.

And to lighten or darken his burden his mother came at <<noon|13>> the very next day. Not having been permitted to accompany him, she had waited over for a final conference with Belknap and Jephson, as well as to write in full her personal impressions in connection with her son\x{2019}s departure\x{2014}(Those nervously searing impressions!) And although anxious to find a room somewhere near the penitentiary, she hurried first to the office of the penitentiary immediately upon her arrival at Auburn and, after presenting an order from Justice Oberwaltzer as well as a solicitous letter from Belknap and Jephson urging the courtesy of a private interview with Clyde to begin with at least, she was permitted to see her son in a room entirely apart from the old death house. For already the warden himself had been reading of her activities and sacrifices and was interested in seeing not only her but Clyde also.",
