            "In early October, rebuked often enough by his wife\x{2019}s example and by her words (Ma Joad\x{2019}s indomitableness owes much to Carol\x{2019}s spirit), Steinbeck roused himself from \x{201c}self-indulgence\x{201d} and \x{201c}laziness\x{201d} to mount the final drive. Blessedly, the last five chapters of the novel came to him so abundantly that he had more material than he could use. Some time <<around noon|13>> on Wednesday, October 26, he completed the last 775 words of the novel; at the bottom of the concluding manuscript page, Steinbeck, whose writing was normally minuscule, scrawled in letters an inch-and-a-half high, END#. It should have been cause for joyous celebration, but between bouts of bone-weary tiredness and nervous exhaustion, he felt only numbness, and maybe a little of the mysterious satisfaction that comes from giving his all. He certainly had no grasp of the book\x{2019}s effectiveness or its potential popularity, and he even warned The Viking Press against a large first printing. Following a four-day recuperation in San Francisco, the Steinbecks moved to their new home (still under construction), where Carol finished typing the 751-page typescript, and together they made \x{201c}routine\x{201d} final corrections. The only \x{201c}clean\x{201d} copy of the book was sent to his New York agents, McIntosh and Otis, on December 7, 1938, roughly six months after he sat down to write the novel. Elizabeth Otis\x{2019}s visit to Los Gatos in late December 1938, to smooth out some of Steinbeck\x{2019}s \x{201c}rough\x{201d} language, its enthusiastic reception at Viking (marred briefly by the wrangling which ensued over the novel\x{2019}s controversial ending) all struck the novelist as anticlimactic. (He was by then suffering from severely painful sciatica, undoubtedly caused by a herniated spinal disk, one of the ironic results of his sedentary existence.)",

Drive continues. Today the argument against sin and the means of losing it\x{2014}the quest for the true spirit [Ed.\x{2014}middle section of Chapter 4]. This should be a good sharp section. Duke did not arrive. Probably today. Dinner at Louis\x{2019}s very interesting. He read two sections and there is a very fine tone to them. Conversation re hay fever, a curious rationalization. Locked her [Ed.\x{2014}Steinbeck\x{2019}s Airedale terrier] in my bathroom last night. She was  good. Weather is superb\x{2014}hot but not too hot. Letter from Paul Jordan Smith* who wants to come up end of the month. One hundred days of writing will finish this book, I think. That is four months. Means I should get first draft done in October and that is allowing lots of lee way for last. Must leave room every day for further comment. Turtle sequence stands up [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 3].",

I get nuts if not protected from all the outside stuff. Dinner tonight at Tolertons\x{2019}. *  I like them very much. Must make note of work progress at the end of this day. I want to finish my stint if I possibly can. Impulses to do other things. Wind blowing over me, etc. But must continue today for sake of discipline. Well, the stint is done but I think I\x{2019}ll try to finish out the chapter tomorrow [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 4]. Be about one more page. Lionel Smith came over. Bob C. * and Margery Bailey* coming down tomorrow night. Glad I got done. I hate to break the discipline.

Going to do a little work today\x{2014}perhaps a page to finish the chapter of Casy and Joad. If it doesn\x{2019}t get done, it doesn\x{2019}t matter. But since the next chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 5] tells of the coming of the tractors and must have a symphonic overtone, and, moreover, may not be more than four or five pages long, it would be just as well to limit the day\x{2019}s work to this chapter. Hence this attempt. Finished Chapter II [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 4]. Now must make music again. But on Monday and that will be",

Have really only one page to do to keep up with schedule but I want to do this short over-chapter complete in one day and so I will work at it until it is done. I had wanted to hear some music first but the washing machine is going and I\x{2019}ll have a fairly hard time. I would do it tonight but must go to the dentist and my jaws will be battered. My whole nervous system is battered. Don\x{2019}t know why. I hope I am not headed for a nervous breakdown. Lack of solitude* is doing it I think. But I don\x{2019}t know. I am very happy in this work, I do know that. It satisfies me so far. But I wish I could have the music. I really need the music. * Too many things happening. It would be interrupted and that would be worse than not playing it at all. Well\x{2014}to work and if it doesn\x{2019}t go well, I\x{2019}ll wait until the washing machine stops and then do it. Try now though. Now the two pages are done and I think well done. But there is one more day of work on the inter-chapter 3 [Ed.\x{2014} Chapter 5]. Have to make the sound of the tractors and the dust of the tractors. I\x{2019}ll have to have music before that, and the date will be",

Now it is a fairly early start. Today\x{2019}s work is the overtone of the tractors, the men who run them, the men they displace, the sound of them, the smell of them. I\x{2019}ve got to get this over. Got to because this one\x{2019}s tone is very important\x{2014}this is the eviction sound and the tonal reason for the movement. Must do it well. I am one page ahead so that if I should go no farther I should still have caught up. And so to do it. I am not frightened of this any more. Too much a part of it finally. Letter from Rodman* this morning. My traffic fine was \$2.50. Thought it might be twenty-five. But now to work. Well that is finished and I hope it is good [Ed.\x{2014}second half of Chapter 5].

This is the longest diary I ever kept. Not a diary of course but an attempt to map the actual working days and hours of a novel. If a day is skipped it will show glaringly on this record and there will be some reason given for the slip. Yesterday the general and now back to the particular. I find I am not very satisfied with the numbering of these chapters. It may be that they will simply be numbered with large numerals for the general and small for the particular. The reason is that I want the reader to be able to keep  them separate in his mind. Today Joad and Casy come home and find the house deserted. They meet Muley Graves and he tells them where Joad\x{2019}s parents are. They sleep in Muley\x{2019}s deserted house. Background for the moving comes in here. This is followed by the general [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 7] of the old cars, of the equipment, of the moving technique, and then the Joad family enters and the book really gets moving. Well, that\x{2019}s done but only a little into this chapter. I think maybe two or three more days on this chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 6] I think. And tomorrow will be",

Late start today. Last night two boys down from Stanford. They tied me in knots as nicely as I could do it to anyone when I was in Stanford. Nice kids and bright and alert ones. I like to see them and hear them. They cross examined me on the universe and man. I found difficulty in getting out of this book long enough to be anything but dull. This single track mind seems to be a narrow gauge as well. Now to the day\x{2019}s work and now Muley comes in and the reason for the desertion becomes apparent. Also the night comes with sleeping in the darkening plain and stars [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 6]. And after that I think a small inter chapter or maybe a large one dealing with the equipment of migration. Well here goes for Muley. Well that is done. I like Muley. He is a fine hater. Must write a few letters now.",

Friday around again. And a little mail. Wire from Crawford, letter from Ford. * Says he is going on the road with the show for  which I am glad indeed for I think he is fine. I hope it has a good run. With luck I should be finished with this first draft in October sometime and then God knows what I\x{2019}ll do. I\x{2019}ll surely be ready for a rest. Sometimes now I get a little bit tired just with the multitude of this story but the movement is so fascinating that I don\x{2019}t stay tired. And the leisurely pace is good too. This must be a good book. It simply must. I haven\x{2019}t any choice. It must be far and away the best thing I have ever attempted\x{2014}slow but sure, piling detail on detail until a picture and an experience emerge. Until the whole throbbing thing emerges. And I can do it. I feel very strong to do it. Today for instance into the picture is the evening and the cooking of the rabbits and the discussion of prison and punishment. And the owls and the cat catches a mouse and they sit on the sloping porch [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 6]. And tomorrow the beginning of the used car yard if I am finished with this scene. Better make this scene three pages instead of two. Because there can never be too much of background. Well to work on the characters.

And now I am ready to go to work and I am glad to get into other lives and escape from mine for a while. Yesterday the used car lot and today Tom and Casy go home to the family, if they get there (Ed.-beginning of Chapter 8]. Must go slowly and introduce these people fully and carefully for I will be with them a long time. After spending nearly seven thousand dollars to be alone and quiet, the neighbors run their radio all day and I get the benefit of it. Carol can hear them reading their letters to each other. We may have to move from this beautiful place. This is a day when I could readily lose myself in irrelevant reflection and recrimination and so I must go to work now and stop such a possibility.

Begin the detailed description of the family I am to live with for four months. Must take time in the description, detail, detail, looks, clothes, gestures. Ma very important. Uncle John important. Pa very. In fact all of them are important. Got to take it slowly. I don\x{2019}t care how long it is [Ed.-Chapter 8]. We have to know these people. Know their looks and their nature. Must. And now to work. Rest of the line for after work comment. Finished her. I don\x{2019}t know how well. Tomorrow I\x{2019}ll have to fight my willpower.",

Now it is Saturday and we got up early and I am to work early. I don\x{2019}t see any reason for not doing a full day\x{2019}s work [Ed.\x{2014}2,000 words]. This is a huge job. Mustn\x{2019}t think of its largeness but only of the little picture while I am working. Leave the large picture for planning time. If only I could do this book properly it would be one of the really fine books and a truly American book. But I am assailed with my own ignorance and inability. I\x{2019}ll just have to work from a background of these. Honesty. If I can keep an  honesty it is all I can expect of my poor brain\x{2014}never temper a word to a reader\x{2019}s prejudice, but bend it like putty for his understanding. If I can do that it will be all my lack of genius can produce. For no one else knows my lack of ability the way I do. I am pushing against it all the time. Sometimes, I seem to do a good little piece of work, but when it is done it slides into mediocrity. Well the day\x{2014}Ma, Pretty Boy Floyd, Grampa and Granma and maybe Noah. Can\x{2019}t tell whether I will get to Noah. To work now. Well, that\x{2019}s done and I\x{2019}ve caught up for my hangover\x{2014}one day ahead [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 8]. Try to get another next Saturday. Watch the old people. Might get out of hand but I want them mean and funny. And Monday will be",

Now a new week. Must slow down and take it easier. Saturday had a feeling of exhaustion near to collapse. I guess I\x{2019}d been working too hard. It\x{2019}s not the amount of work but the almost physical drive that goes into it that seems to make the difference. I should take it a little easier or I won\x{2019}t be finishing. I have just a page or so over 100 typescript pages done out of 600. I have five times as much work left to do as I have done already, so I must conserve strength because I do want to do this novel and  finish it this time. Must get no fatal feelings about it. Change from Shawnee to Sallisaw [Ed.\x{2014}Oklahoma]. Make earth red, not grey\x{2014}and above all I must take my time. That is the most important of all. Take it easy. I don\x{2019}t mean to write less or less forcefully but to keep the frantic quality out of my approach. Well it is time for work now. Now the day\x{2019}s work is done. The prayer and Al comes home [Ed.\x{2014}finish of Chapter 8]. Tomorrow the sorting of things to go and this should be a well done thing. I think I\x{2019}ll play The Swan* before because there too is the loss of a loved thing of the past. I think I\x{2019}ll do that. Beth is coming tomorrow and she has done just that. Just that. Sorted over the trappings of her dead life. And so the book moves on steadily, forcefully, slowly, and it must continue to move slowly. How I love it. Dinner with Louis and Mary tonight. Now on to thought. Tomorrow must be poetry.",

Out late last night and Carol mad at me for staying. The house above with its radio blasting has spoiled this place for us completely. Have to fight noise worse than in P.G.

Beth came last night. Looks much better than she did and her interests are awakening again. By the end of the summer I think she will be in good shape. She needs not to think too much about anything. But now to work. Little sleep last night. Couldn\x{2019}t get to sleep. And other things. And today I\x{2019}ll have to buck into it. Beginning of a particular chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 10] and that isn\x{2019}t so bad. I\x{2019}ll try to go through with it but for some reason I\x{2019}m slightly skittish. That does not always mean anything. I\x{2019}ll just take a running dive at it and set down what happens. Start with Tom and his mother. And works to the return of the men and begins the conference of the men. And the reports and circulars and ads for labor. (Got her done. And I\x{2019}m afraid she\x{2019}s a little dull.) Think.

This seems to be the approximate usual time. Good sleep last night and I feel fine and relaxed. I\x{2019}m not going to work on Saturday  this week so that I will get fresh and rested.

Don\x{2019}t know what to take him. Cigars maybe. We\x{2019}ll eat on the way. I go to the dentist at <<four|9c:0>>. After which digression, get back to work. And I feel relaxed about it too. Yesterday was a nervous drive. I notice my handwriting shows that. Beginning at any rate of the conference [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 10]. Enter all the rest of my actors. John, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and the two little kids [Ed.\x{2014}Ruthie and Winfield]. The circle of squatting men and the plans, the order of authority, and the texture of the family.

Letter from Tom [Ed.\x{2014}Collins] with vital information to be used later. He is so good. I need this stuff. It is exact and just the thing that will be used against me if I am wrong.

Now it is Monday. And I took two days off and have a little trouble getting into the swing. For one thing Pat* can\x{2019}t meet royalty payment and is paying one third, with notes for another two thousand. This is all right if it doesn\x{2019}t indicate that he is in difficulty. That worries me a little but not much. Ed came for the weekend. Good Ed.* We ran down to [Ed.\x{2014}Pacific] Grove Saturday night to inject 300 hagfish\x{2014}ugly, slimy brutes, and much better looking full of formaldehyde. That knocked the slime. Ritch and Tal* drove back. They are all coming next Saturday night for the week end of the Fourth. Short story volume [Ed.\x{2014}The Long Valley] comes out in early Sept. It will collapse of course but I\x{2019}ll be glad to have it out. May sell three or four thousand copies. People looking at the next lot. We really must get out of here. I would love so much to go over to the Aptos country [Ed.\x{2014}south of Santa Cruz]. Hear the ocean that I love. But must let Carol decide since she lives so much in her environment. Got a mild muscle [Ed.\x{2014}spasm] in my chest and was dizzy this morning. I don\x{2019}t know why. This place is getting as noisy as a city lot. There is a lot of talk in the diary this morning\x{2014}reason is to relieve the tension and get even with myself. Doesn\x{2019}t matter since I can work later this afternoon. Now for a discussion. Moment I stopped work the drive became sexual. Now the work will take that up. Now today\x{2019}s work is the pig killing and salting and the loading of the truck and the departure and the capture of Grampa  [Ed.\x{2014}last sections of Chapter 10]. That is at least two days or maybe three, and then the next general is the empty house. Take out the last paragraph of the last general for the next. I\x{2019}m a little sick today.

For all that burst and bally hoo yesterday, I got only a half day\x{2019}s work done. Must catch it up little by little this week. Didn\x{2019}t tell Carol.

I\x{2019}ll give this day a number depending on how much I make up. Well I caught up half a page and only half more to make it; and four days this week yet to do it so it will be all right I guess.

Now time has caught up with me. I\x{2019}ve been four days off work, am all rested but by the same token I\x{2019}ve got to get back the rhythm. I think I can for I jolly well must. There are no two ways about it. Beginning the second book today and it must have the rolling sound of wheels and the clutter of cars and the panting across the country. The first general [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 12] and it must have the meat of the whole second volume in it. For a  moment I was afraid to start but this diary is a good idea for it gives me the opening use of words every day. Long weekend. Ritch and Tal and Ed here. Danced Sunday night, went completely mad dancing. Never did such dancing\x{2014}every one for himself and Ed tippy-toeing around like a bear. All of us more drunk with high spirits than with anything else. Read Ed some little parts of this book and he finds them moving for which I am glad. They went home last night. This morning lots of quail. Play goes on the road with original cast. * Moore wants information for a critique* of some kind. Norwegian translation* coming, etc. Exciting but I can\x{2019}t allow excitement. Leave that for this winter. I want this done before the show comes out here. It is getting warm after all this time. Now back to the work. I feel fine about it. But during the four days off I have thought of the whole book. And it is rather like the prison term. Must not think too much of the end but of the immediate story\x{2014}instant and immediate. It is a long haul but what do I care[?] It will be done all of the rest of my life\x{2014}whatever is left of it. And that is not moody. When this book is finished a goodly part of my life will be finished with it. A part I will never get back to. But now the time is here to get to work and so I go. All done* but I don\x{2019}t know. I\x{2019}m afraid of that chapter. Two [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 13] is of the family again on the road. Must get down to business now and work hard and tomorrow is",

Now the land work starts again. Now the crossing and I must get into it the feeling of movement and of life. Review of my work* in a magazine this morning. All wrong. But the writer was dishonest. Still some of his criticism was valuable. Make the  people live. Make them live. But my people must be more than people. They must be an over-essence of people. Critics understand very little. They have to be taught the long hard way. But I am in the suck hole of work again. Immersed in it. And this chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 13] will be a long one. It is the first day and night. And it has in it the first communication with other migrants. This is important, very important. Letter from George Hedley at work in school, wants us to go up there. Wish I could but I can\x{2019}t.

Now it\x{2019}s Thursday. Strange how I\x{2019}m fighting this book now. I think it is about to change now though because I am feeling more and more like work. The despair came on me for a while but although still nervous from it I think I am recovering. Today will be a kind of test case I guess. As Carol says, stay with the detail. Let the damn book go three hundred thousand words if it wants to. This is my life. Why should I want to finish my own life? The confidence is on me again. I can feel it. It\x{2019}s stopping work that does the damage. Today I finish another section of this big book, a page section that is. I wish this [Ed.\x{2014}ledger] book were all full. This daily work diary is really working this time and it is a good thing. Today word from Barry,* who wants to print my statement. Also from teacher\x{2019}s association asking for a speech, and Who\x{2019}s Who* for correction of proof. That\x{2019}s all the mail.  Swedish translation* of T.F. arrived today, and the Norwegian is on the way. Getting quite a collection of translations. It will be a nice thing to have. Today I feel finally relaxed after the Fourth of July holiday. That seemed to wear me down rather than rest me. The work itself has rested me. Now the time is here to go to work. And I must go to work. And I\x{2019}m anxious today. Report later. Finished and I have a good feeling about today\x{2019}s work. I think it is better. More easy and moving.",

Fairly early start today. And a beautiful day. Carol goes to look at real estate today. Wilkus came out with a word about a ranch in the mountains\x{2014}360 acres for \$12,000.

These people must be intensely alive the whole time. I was worried about Rose of Sharon. She has to emerge if only as a silly pregnant girl now. She has to be a person. Noah I think I\x{2019}ll lose for the time being and Uncle John and maybe for a while Casy. But I want to keep Tom and Ma together. Lots of people walking along the roads in this season. I can hear their voices. Louis has finished his book, first draft. * He must be glad, I guess. Well, it\x{2019}s time for me to go to work. Time to go and today I must get them camped. And the tent effect built. And the new people. And maybe a part of the history of this new couple [Ed.\x{2014}the Wilsons]. Well, that\x{2019}s done. The death of Grampa [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 13].",

Monday again. The weeks swing by but they don\x{2019}t seem to get me much nearer to completion. They do, of course, only they don\x{2019}t seem to.

And I am terrified that through illness or something the work may stop. Once the first draft is done, it will be all right because someone could read it even if I passed out of the picture. But I simply must get the draft done. Must avoid every side influence. Must get to be tough about so many things now. Once it is finished of course\x{2014}then I\x{2019}ll take time off I hope. But I haven\x{2019}t really done much work the last two years\x{2014}for me, I mean. In wordage, more than most, but not for me. But once this book is done I won\x{2019}t care how soon I die, because my major work will be over. Today comes the funeral in the night of Grampa. That will be the whole day\x{2019}s work. And it closes one whole part of the book. It must be good and full of fullness and completions. And that feeling must go into it. Must. I seem to use the word must more than any other.

This is a beautiful day, hot and clean. Last night Richardson of the Chronicle down. Spoke about a new literature section. I have nothing for it and the price is too low for Louis. Well, there you have it. This morning a request from CIO* to head a committee for organization of farm workers. Can\x{2019}t do it until this book is done. Mail was sparse today. This is a hell of a time to be writing a book. Everything in the world is happening and I must sit here and write. Well if I ever finish, it will be some kind of triumph. This good pen holds up beautifully. I guess it will last out the entire book. The more I think of it, the better I like this work diary idea. Always I\x{2019}ve set things down to loosen up a creaking mind but never have I done so consecutively. This sort of keeps it all corralled in one place. Soule phoned* that he wanted me to talk to the President, but I don\x{2019}t know what about or why. I\x{2019}ll do it if I can do any good but I\x{2019}ll be damned if I\x{2019}ll be another shirt front in a curious mob. I can\x{2019}t go on this way forever. My hand today will steady down I think because I am calm. And it is time now.",

I don\x{2019}t know why, but everything seems to be happening now. We are looking at ranches today, too. And yesterday we saw the most beautiful I have ever seen. I want that ranch.* We\x{2019}ll try to get it. Carol wants it too. And it is reported that [Ed.\x{2014}Wally]  Ford is coming and all the time I go on working but I wonder whether my work isn\x{2019}t getting a shot-full-of-holes feeling. No word from Soule so I guess I won\x{2019}t have to meet the President. I would have but I didn\x{2019}t like it. Most brilliant weather now. Lovely. And time slips through my fingers. But so far the work has slipped through too so that in fifteen days I shall be half through this book. Probably the first of August no less. I don\x{2019}t know whether I can do the whole thing in one jump without a rest. We will see. May take a few days off when Book Two is done. Took four days when Book One was done. Tried to get some music but couldn\x{2019}t. Routine of the house more important. Will have to get on without it. Having to work through and around a thousand things anyway. Wish I could run away from everything to do my book. God, how I wish I could! It will be full of jitter at this rate. No other way, I guess. Well, to work\x{2014}or to try.",

Book II Chap. 4
Today much to my disgust the time has slipped away and it is the latest since I started this book. Not that it matters a great deal. Just work later. I\x{2019}ll get it done but it scares me to be late. We\x{2019}re hipped on this ranch. Can think of little else. But I must. Carol is mad over the place and so am I. Well I don\x{2019}t have to meet the President for which I am thankful. My lazy tendency is setting in now and I\x{2019}ll have to combat it. This book must be ready by the first of the year. Simply must. And that means solid work, completely solid. So this tendency must be put out of the way. Little mail this morning for which I\x{2019}m glad. Rusty sent sixty bottles  of the fine red wine. Nice people. Too many things are happening. No word from the east [Ed.\x{2014}from Pat Covici, or from McIntosh and Otis]. News printed my letters* and I imagine the reaction will be immediate. Now to work god damn it and different work. Must get to it.",

Today I have a leisurely feeling getting into the work whereas yesterday it was one of frantic rush. Today it will be 68 pages [Ed.\x{2014}of handwritten manuscript]. According to the thousand words to the page gauge, that would be about 70,000 words, but it is more I think. And it is the 35th day. In other words, in 16 more days I\x{2019}ll be half through. And I must get my people to California before then. By the first of August they should be there, come what may. I think all of today will be in the hamburger stand [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 15]. That is an important place. Carol going to San Jose today. That ranch sinks back now. Won\x{2019}t have to think of it for awhile. It would be fine to finish the book before thinking of it. Then I could think of it all I want. But today I can take my time and what difference if I don\x{2019}t finish until late? I don\x{2019}t care. Must be sure not to drink too much and little but beer or short ones in Salinas. Poison on town. I\x{2019}m going there in the same way that some people go to a slaughter house or a morgue. Anyway, I\x{2019}m going. This day is good. Letter from Ed and all his teeth are out now. And now to work. On with the hamburger stand. Carol just left with Elsie [Ed.\x{2014}Ray] and my time has  come. No more nonsense. Well, I got her and the eating joint is through and I think pretty well. Now a week end.",

Yesterday was a bust and I\x{2019}m sorry but I think today will be all right. I just can\x{2019}t go on these week ends. Confusion lasts too long.

Well last night a wire that Pat is in trouble. I\x{2019}ve been expecting it. I\x{2019}m so sorry for him. Our two thousand dollars, our year\x{2019}s royalties, are pretty important to us but we\x{2019}re eating and working and that\x{2019}s more than we have any right to expect. Being broke won\x{2019}t kill us but it will wipe Pat out. And he is such a nice fellow. The irritations are increasing. I wonder whether I will ever finish this book. And of course I\x{2019}ll finish it. Just work a certain length of time and it will get done poco a poco. Just do the day\x{2019}s work. Some days I think I am getting sour but I don\x{2019}t know. Then comes a good day and I am lifted up again. And I can\x{2019}t tell from the opening. Often in writing these beginning lines I think it is going to be all right and then it isn\x{2019}t. Just have to see. I hope it is all right today. It is hot today, but by powdering my arm and hand it seems to be all right. I hope the whole rest of the summer isn\x{2019}t boiling, but if it is, it is, and that\x{2019}s all there is to it. The work must go on day after day until one day it will be finished. In ten days I will be half done. 50 days of work. I hope we get to California by then because I would like half the time out here. That is the important part\x{2014}out here. Today I must get the family split\x{2014}perhaps Tom and Casy to Santa Rosa, or  Tom at least for the part [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 16]. I think it may be all right.

This is Friday and the last day of a short week. I am ashamed of the short week but it must be put down to accident. Actually I am just about up to schedule on wordage. And I have to take a small loss. So far it is very small. Pat did not have the creditors\x{2019} meeting yesterday. I have a feeling he will pull out of this. He  has an advance sale list of 8000 on the short stories a month before publication, which is phenomenal. I hope to goodness he can pull out. He is a plugger though. Letter from Burns Mantle for a reprint of M & M. * I hope everything will blow over and let me go on with this work. Only 8 days to finish half. And today I cut out another section. Record from Ford today. Jokes and very good. Startling effect hearing yourself addressed from the phonograph. No word from Pare. Have been expecting him. I won\x{2019}t mind a rest after today. I\x{2019}m taking my time now but the wordage continues. That\x{2019}s the way it should be, too. Now I should be getting back to work. To the Rays\x{2019} tonight for dinner and I suppose I\x{2019}ll get tight and I don\x{2019}t much care. In a way it is good and in a way bad. But if I am to drink anything Friday night is the best night for it. I\x{2019}m a bit addled but I can do it all right. If my self discipline will let me go on working while hell pops around my ears, I\x{2019}ll be all right. I\x{2019}ll know I am all right. I just hope the work isn\x{2019}t suffering. And now to it. Must build some on this one-eyed man [Ed.\x{2014}the junkyard scene in Chapter 16].",

Lots of excitement. Carol went with Nellie [Ed.\x{2014}her mother, who was vacationing in Santa Cruz] last night. Good for her, the change. Restless night for me on account of eating melon and strange and scary to be alone. Must write about this some time. It is a curious thing. Wind blew terribly. This morning lots of mail. Elizabeth writes everything that has been happening. I think Pat will get clear some way\x{2014}letters from John [Ed.\x{2014}Barry],  from Henning,* and from the O\x{2019}Brien guy.* Pleasant weekend but a little exhausting. Cerf* wired some plan whereby he carries Pat. I don\x{2019}t know. Wired Elizabeth. Mustn\x{2019}t interfere with her in any way. They\x{2019}re a fine bunch of people. I like Random House. Of course, I don\x{2019}t know anything about them financially, but I like the books they print. And I like Cerf. Well, anyway I haven\x{2019}t lost a minute of work on account of this difficulty. That\x{2019}s good. That\x{2019}s the fine discipline. If I can only keep that up this book will be finished in due course. Now I have all day to work and there is no need of hurrying. I can piddle out the two thousand words. Working in the main house because of telephone\x{2014}so I won\x{2019}t have to run in, I mean. It is a curious windy day with the weather changing and fallish and leaves falling. Probably be an early and mean winter. It is time for me to get to work. Got to. Even if I have plenty of time. I get assailed with old times. Last night particularly. The flies are in this house on my arms. Here I could have had only half a page of work done [Ed.\x{2014}still on Chapter 16]. This diary is really valuable to me though. Keeps me from writing letters. And now to work. This pen writes thinner if it is steeper. This has been a good pen to me so far. Never had such a good one. To work now.",

Now I didn\x{2019}t work then or all week. Carol had her tonsils out and has been so sick and miserable that I just can\x{2019}t concentrate. Weakness maybe but can\x{2019}t cut her pain out of my mind. Pat\x{2019}s trouble piddles on and that interferes some. Just have to drop  last week. It was out. Brod Crawford* came for the weekend. Nice fellow, but what a time to come. My nerves are very bad, awful in fact. I lust to get back into it. Maybe I was silly to think I could write so long a book without stopping. I can\x{2019}t. Or rather I couldn\x{2019}t. I\x{2019}ll try to go on now. Hope to lose some of the frantic quality in my mind now. It\x{2019}s just like slipping behind at Stanford. *  Panic sets in. Can\x{2019}t organize. And everybody is taking a crack at me. Want time, want to use me. In aggregate it is terrible. And I don\x{2019}t know where to run. Ought to go into the wild somewhere but I am needed here. Got to calm down. Simply must. I\x{2019}m jumpy. And it is hot. Good for fog. Don\x{2019}t know who will publish my book. Don\x{2019}t know at all. No reason to let it slide though. Must keep at it. Necessary. Carol says I\x{2019}m pampering myself. I guess I am. Wish I could control the jumping jitters though. Time to make the break and another try now. Time for it. I made it [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 16].",

So many things are going on I\x{2019}m nearly crazy. * I simply must keep my head. Pare is at last making headway and I wish to God I could jump in but this book comes first. I wonder if I am dramatizing myself. I wouldn\x{2019}t be surprised. Let\x{2019}s get down to earth. This book I\x{2019}m working on is just a book like any other. Let\x{2019}s work on it and not get wild. If it flops it flops, and that is that. I think I want it to be fine mainly because Carol does so much. But no reason to go nuts about it. Still no clarification of Pat\x{2019}s business. It should clear up in the next little while. It has to. There must be some way but they\x{2019}ll work that out. Now at last I am growing calm. This diary is a marvelous method of calming me down every day. Pretty soon I\x{2019}ll have to turn back  pages to continue it. I really should have word today how Pat comes out. Carol\x{2019}s throat is better today. I\x{2019}m going in and kiss her now. And then I\x{2019}ll feel better. And then I can go to work. And this day is the real restoration of the technique of stogyness. Which is what I am. And now to work.",

Well still we\x{2019}re hung up in the matter of the east [Ed.\x{2014}Covici\x{2019}s situation]. No word today at all and this is Wednesday. Carol is improving in the throat now. She dreamed about the Biddle ranch last night. She wants it terribly. I must make every effort to get it for her. It is the most beautiful place I have ever seen. No doubt of that at all. There are now four things or five rather to write through\x{2014}throat, bankruptcy, Pare, ranch, and the book. If I get this book done it will be remarkable. Well, two pages a day will do it in time. And the time slips by. Just a matter of doing the daily stint. Feel pretty good but am impatient about all the things hanging over me. Can\x{2019}t help it. But I\x{2019}ll get it done. I just hope it is some good. With this split attention I don\x{2019}t know. I really don\x{2019}t. Today I\x{2019}ll finish this general chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 17] of the change on the roads and the enemies, though maybe the enemies should wait until California. I think so. The end seems ages away and it is too ages away. It is hot now but not sufferingly so. Now the time has come to go to work and I only hope that I am worthy to work. Here goes.",

Today is the last day before I turn back some pages of this diary. I had no idea I would keep at it or that I would write so much in it every day. But it is so, and it is good. Letter from E.O. My affairs are still mixed up. I wrote the threat to the printers. * It may never be used. Don\x{2019}t know but I want Elizabeth to have it. And that was all. No other mail of any note. Ranch business tied up yet, too. Can\x{2019}t tell. Carol wants it terribly. Must get it for her. But how if we\x{2019}re never [Ed.\x{2014}financially] clear? Have moved my table to the shady side of the room. I hope to God this book isn\x{2019}t suffering from all the inroads of other things. Now today I must move my family fast. I think I want to get them through the desert in this chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 18] and to Bakersfield. Ten pages to this chapter will be 92 [Ed.\x{2014}manuscript pages] and that isn\x{2019}t far off my plan. Will be 108,000 words. So if the chapter is a little shorter it will still be well over a hundred. I\x{2019}m 96,000 now. In [Ed.\x{2014}typed] pages I am not <<far from 400|18:0>> now. I think it will be <<about 800|3:0>> or slightly under. Anyway, I am well along. And I don\x{2019}t care much about anything. Gail and George* just came by and took Carol to the city for the day. It will probably be good for her. But I\x{2019}ve got to go on and think of nothing but this book. I\x{2019}m behind now and I want not to lose any more time, and so I simply must go on.

Well the work has pretty much gone to hell. Might just as well take it in stride. The pressure broke down the strict discipline and Friday went to S.F. with Ed. I was tired. Then the difficulty and that didn\x{2019}t help, and the trouble in the east is still going on. Should break out of this this week I think. Then a letter from Muni* about T.F. Which I would like to do. If I could get Louis to work with me it would be good. I\x{2019}ll try when the time comes but meanwhile the pressure increases with little way out nor hope of ease. And so I simply must establish the discipline again and maintain it for a while. A slightly less frantic outlook would make some difference. The dog [Ed.\x{2014}female in heat] has been completely frantic lately and it must stop. Carol is entirely well now and able to take over the phone, etc. Not entirely well, but on the road if there are no complications. I should be able to go ahead. I am so lazy and the thing ahead is so very difficult. I think it is laziness that is getting me. How easily we can transpose our laziness into something else. But I\x{2019}ve done books before and what I have left to do now is one ordinary length novel. About the length of I.D.B. or a little longer and that will be the end. And now it is time to go to work.",

Now a new era. Don\x{2019}t know how it will work. Now cleared in N.Y. Viking Press* bought contract. New one made. I hope it is a good one. Will hear in a day or so. Wellman Farley* coming  down today. Hope G.S.K. [Ed.\x{2014}George S. Kaufman] has called him but I don\x{2019}t know. Probably late today. The washing machine slows me down. But I can\x{2019}t complain. It\x{2019}s so good mostly. And if I\x{2019}m a little late, what of it? I am removing the time dead line on this book. I think that a good idea.

The other things\x{2014}T.F. and I.D.B [Ed.\x{2014}movie versions] \x{2014}are good to think about but this book is my work. When it is done I can do what I want, but until then\x{2014}this is the stuff. I feel pretty good. If we could get this ranch I\x{2019}d feel better. Certainly it is the most beautiful place I ever saw. Must remember the trouble I had in M & M. * Thought I\x{2019}d never get it done or make it work. I don\x{2019}t know.

Although I got up early this morning I\x{2019}m late getting to work and I don\x{2019}t in the least know why. No word from the east today. Be a letter tomorrow and all the trouble will be done. For a while at least. No more word from Muni. My stipulations were tough and perhaps turned them away. Now this work is getting very hard. Wellman down yesterday and apparently G.S.K. doesn\x{2019}t intend to give him a chance. Well I\x{2019}ve done all I could there. I\x{2019}m getting worried about this book. I wish it were done. I\x{2019}m afraid I\x{2019}m botching it. I think it would be a good thing to stop and think about it but I hate to lose the time. But I want it to be good and I\x{2019}m afraid it is slipping. But I must remember that it always seems that way when it is well along. I think I\x{2019}ll plug  them into California today.

I don\x{2019}t know how that stands. And no word from the ranch. I don\x{2019}t know how that stands either. Either they are bluffing or they are arguing it out. I don\x{2019}t know which, or maybe they have lost interest in us. Can\x{2019}t tell. Just have to wait, I guess. Now I think that covers what has happened.

I simply must get this thing out of my system. I\x{2019}m not a writer. I\x{2019}ve been fooling myself and other people. I wish I were. This success will ruin me as sure as hell. It probably won\x{2019}t last, and that will be all right. I\x{2019}ll try to go on with work now. Just a stint every day does it. I keep forgetting.

Early to work this morning and this is a general chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 19], which\x{2014}although they are highly charged\x{2014}are nevertheless the repository of all the external information and material. In a way they are easier to write and in a way harder. But yesterday I got into the swing of doing my daily stint again. The hammering next door nearly drives me nuts, but no way out of that, I guess. Just have to work through it. Take all the time I need. Mustn\x{2019}t think of the hammering. Dan James and Chaplin coming up this afternoon. I\x{2019}ll be done early though. The hammering got me and I came into my room which is now the quietest in the house. And it seems pleasant to me. Looking forward to seeing Pare very much. Such a nice guy. Such fun if he isn\x{2019}t too tired. Want him to see the ranch, too. I\x{2019}m dawdling today. The hammering is terrific even in here. I don\x{2019}t care if I do dawdle some. The lady who is doing the thesis* writes fearfully. The ranch is still the most beautiful place in the world. I love that place. We will enjoy it. I\x{2019}ve sneaking fears that it is too good and too beautiful for me. Beth will love it, too. In fact, every one we like will love it. It is so beautiful. But I can\x{2019}t go on this way for I must get my slow day\x{2019}s work done. And now is a good time to start on it. What a wonderful pen this is. It has and is giving me perfect service\x{2014}never stops flowing for a second and never overflows and blots a word. But I\x{2019}m stalling now to keep from going to work. To work.",

Today Pare arrives. Yesterday was too much for me. I fought it really hard until I realized that the fight was obscuring the picture. I have some force but not enough for that apparently. Today I feel better I hope. Anyway I try to go on today. I\x{2019}m afraid for this book, really afraid. Part of the difficulty lies in all the  shooting at me, but the other half lies within myself. That\x{2019}s why it is going to be good to see Pare. Maybe it will be easier when I see him. My dream of early finish goes glummering. Plodding is all right until a day comes when I can\x{2019}t even plod anymore. I feel limited, too. M.B. [Ed.\x{2014}Margery Bailey] hunting. C.A.S [Ed.\x{2014}Carlton Allyn Sheffield] hunting and sniping. No help for that. The book is to do. I\x{2019}ve fallen in these holes before even in the little Mice book. I had great trouble.* None are east and they aren\x{2019}t even going to grow east. Good luck is even worse for work than bad luck. I have been too fortunate lately. Of course it balances with the long years on the other side. Can\x{2019}t tell. Can\x{2019}t tell. Just have to plod for 90,000 words. Plod as the people are plodding. They aren\x{2019}t rushing. And now to work and the first life in Hooverville [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 20].",

This is Tuesday. Pare came over the week end. Big time. Carol sprained her ankle. Went down to the peninsula with Pare and spent night at Chaplin\x{2019}s place [Ed.\x{2014}Pebble Beach]. Talked all night. Of course, I lost a day of work. I am afraid that Pare doesn\x{2019}t need me on this job and I think he knows it but hasn\x{2019}t admitted it yet. I\x{2019}ll work if I am needed. But I wish I could be left alone until Christmas. I am getting tired\x{2014}very tired. I have at least 6 weeks yet of work by any measuring, and I must re-establish the discipline. Must get tough. So many attractive things are happening that it is difficult. And the ranch on top of everything else. But I must get this done. After all, I\x{2019}ve always worked under some kind of pressure: T.F. while mother was ill, I.D.B while Dad was ill, M & M while this house was going up. Always something. Just more this time. I can do it and I will do it, by  God. It is just the discipline that is all. I\x{2019}m wasting time today and I don\x{2019}t care much. Everything goes in circles and I must think WORK. Such strangeness, such strangeness. I\x{2019}ve read parts to people and they like the parts or say they do, but I wonder whether the whole thing will bear up. I wonder. I don\x{2019}t want to get cocky about it. I really shouldn\x{2019}t have told anyone. I get the benefit of the doubt now when before I didn\x{2019}t. The hammering on the next door house is awful. Everything is curious. Pare made me feel better about the country at large. But I am very confused. French rights to I.D.B. are sold now. So many things are happening. This is probably the high point of my life if I only knew it. I will spend today getting straightened out and on a level again\x{2014}thinking. I am fresh again and that is good. My brain is clear for details. I can almost finish in one piece I should think. I want to. I shouldn\x{2019}t be thinking about getting done. Should be thinking only of the story and, by God, I will. I can\x{2019}t let future interfere with the hardest, most complete work of my life. I simply can\x{2019}t. Always I have been weak. Vacillating and miserable. I wish I wouldn\x{2019}t. I wish I weren\x{2019}t. I\x{2019}m so lazy, so damned lazy. This year though I have made up for last year\x{2019}s lay off. I really have batted out a lot of words. I would go through until winter if I could. But if I don\x{2019}t lay off it will be done, and if I do lay off I\x{2019}ll lose the thread. I am simply incapable of working any way but hard and fast. That is the only way I can make it. This is too bad. It is almost impossible in fact but I must get calm and quieted before I can go on. I mean that streak yesterday was curiously indecent. I don\x{2019}t know why but it was. So many things. How impossible it is for me to think. Just writing words, but the thing is starting in my brain. I must get the tempo.",

My nerves are going fast. Getting into confusion of many particles\x{2014}each one beatable, but in company pretty formidable. And I get a little crazy with all of them. Too bad. Just too many things. Must beat them off. I wish I coula go to a furnished room some place where I knew no one and just disappear for a while. I wish that. But I guess it is impossible. I guess it is. I must get back into the stride and sweep. It isn\x{2019}t just noise and bustle, it\x{2019}s all the shots in my direction. The wants, the demands, the dissatisfactions. They\x{2019}re breaking me down, and every now and then my head goes spinning and that frightens me. Some time it might not stop spinning. Nowhere to turn. Nowhere. Can\x{2019}t think of these things any more. Where has my discipline gone? Have I lost control? Quite coldly we\x{2019}ll see today.

Yesterday we bought the Biddle ranch. And there were very cautious inquiries into water rights. Very cautious. And now it is ours. That doesn\x{2019}t mean anything. There is a great weight on my heart. I guess it comes from having property. More and more. It is such a beautiful place. I hope we can sell everything else and just have that one thing. My work is no good, I think\x{2014}I\x{2019}m desperately upset about it. Have no discipline any more. I must get back. An ordinary novel would be finished now, but not this one. This one must be good. Very good. And I\x{2019}m afraid it is not.  Carol is going to try to pick up and start putting it in type. I hope she can. It would help. I so want this to be a good book. So much. I don\x{2019}t know what to do. I\x{2019}m slipping. I\x{2019}ve been slipping all my life. Shouldn\x{2019}t think of that. Is this all laziness, I wonder? I must try to get ahead. Must try that. The week has been shot to hell. Just shot to hell. I\x{2019}ve always had these travails. Never get used to them. Never. This place has become an absolute mad house\x{2014}voice culture on one side, linemen shrieking on another. I don\x{2019}t know what to do. I wish\x{2014}Jesus!",

Now I have lost a great deal of time. I have been remiss and lazy, my concentration I have permitted to go under the line of effort. If this had been the first time I should be very sad. But I am always this way. I can concentrate and under some circumstances I can work. My job is to get down to it and now. For all the pressures, there is only one person to blame and I must force him into it. The point is that I am over half through with this book. What remains is in length an average novel. I can do it and must. Nothing must interfere from this time on. We had rest and change and relaxation and now there is no excuse. Every day now\x{2014}every day. It is just like starting all over, the reluctance and everything. Today is Monday. This is the start into the final [Ed.\x{2014}stretch]. I\x{2019}ve been interested in other things. Can\x{2019}t be anymore. Nothing but the Joads. Must get to it. That is getting to be the forerunning statement in a failure. Expectation. I don\x{2019}t know what I expect or what is expected of me. Nor care. This family must live. I have the laziness and the reluctance that is always present in the beginning. The ranch is bought and there\x{2019}s nothing to do about that. Business is set. Nothing in the world  to interfere. And there is this frightful fear that I won\x{2019}t be able to do it, that it is too much for me. And there are dates that mustn\x{2019}t be kept, and arrangements that must not be made. And the time has come. I must get down to the work although my stomach is water about it.",

Was ever a book written under greater difficulty? Now it\x{2019}s the house. We listed it for sale and we\x{2019}re swamped. People [who] want to buy it want to look at it. We\x{2019}ll be living in a gold fish globe until it is sold I guess. No mail but bills. And the weather is beautiful. Yesterday John Collier* and Jerry [indecipherable].

The time goes on and the manuscript crawls on. And after a long time it will be done. I am not sad. In fact, I am pretty glad now. Time is going. The noise of pounding* next door is simply terrific. There are days when they pound their heads off. Today they seem to be just hammering as loudly as they can. There is proof today how bad a merchant I would be. Our house is for sale and a quasi-customer is coming out. I am full of resentment\x{2014}not that I don\x{2019}t want to sell it, but that I don\x{2019}t like the position of seller. The new ranch is so lovely. And we\x{2019}re in no hurry to sell. But it is listed and I guess we\x{2019}ll have to show it. Hope there isn\x{2019}t a train of people looking. Now for today in the work. I\x{2019}ll finish a chapter today and be ready for a general on Monday. I think this last chapter has been weak in detail. Must get it back. Got to get them out of Hooverville and into a federal camp for they must learn something of democratic procedure. But today it is just a matter of getting them out of camp [Ed.\x{2014}end of Chapter 20]. Casy is in jail. Uncle John is drunk. Tom will go to the grocery and trail Uncle John. God, this pounding is terrible today. I have to ignore it as much as I can. They\x{2019}re laying floors, Christ! What a place, and we came here looking for quiet. No mail today except requests. That\x{2019}s about all my mail is any more. People who want things. What more can I expect? I\x{2019}ve really asked for it in a way. There doesn\x{2019}t seem to be any other way. Here they  come to look at the house. I wish I didn\x{2019}t feel so much resentment about being a seller instead of a buyer. Seem to be a lot of women. Let Carol take care of them. I\x{2019}ll stick out here and do my own work. Finish out this page. I feel really very good today. The flow of story is coming back to me. The feel of the people. And the feel of speech and the flow of action. So it must go and if it takes until Christmas, then that is the way it must be. I can\x{2019}t be rushed. I must have enough time. I do hope that Pare won\x{2019}t need me, much as I\x{2019}d like to work with him. I must do my own work and I have a feeling that he is this picture not me. Now to work.",

Beginning Chapter 9 general [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 21]. This one will be of the locals and their fight to preserve themselves. It should be a decent one. First, our house is sold.* Just one more thing.

And I need some place to work. How I wish my book were done. But I feel very good about it now. It is really moving and I can finish it if I am only given time. I say six weeks more. It may take more or less. But I want to take plenty and yet not too much. The title is still good. I like it very much. Today I have an early start and except for a little stomach ache from too much excitement, I feel fine. And now even the stomach ache is gone. And I am about ready to start Chapter 9.

But I feel very good about it now. It is really moving and I can finish it if I am only given time. I say six weeks more. It may take more or less. But I want to take plenty and yet not too much. The title is still good. I like it very much. Today I have an early start and except for a little stomach ache from too much excitement, I feel fine. And now even the stomach ache is gone. And I am about ready to start Chapter 9. I hope it is good. Time to go and if I have a good day, I\x{2019}ll be finished by <<noon|13>>. Go!",

Today is Friday. Yesterday I finished the general chapter of the rotting fruit. Today I must go on. The book is beginning to  round out. I think they go to Shafter. I think. I can begin to see the end. But that time jump is bound to give me trouble. I want this book to be perfectly integrated. Well it is heading toward that now. I rather think I will spend today in contemplation. I don\x{2019}t know. Things are weighing on me. And time is passing. I have not heard from Pare which would indicate that his plan has not matured. But it is impossible to know and I am floundering some. There are letters to write. I really shouldn\x{2019}t take the time right now but I feel rather devilish about the whole thing. So many things come up and go down. The T.F. matter has undoubtedly died. I hear so many things like that die. And as for this book, it goes on and on. Pare doesn\x{2019}t want or need me I am pretty sure. I have lots of time to finish. Maybe I\x{2019}ll write to Pare today and try to get an answer out of him. Perhaps it would help. Anyway, I am fairly sure now that I shan\x{2019}t work today but will build on work. The Stones have left the ranch and the foundation forms of the new house are in. What a place it will be. I want to dig holes. I want to use a shovel. Did some yesterday and it made me feel fine. How I wish I were through. The time has come now to write a letter to Pare, I am pretty sure.",

            "This book has become a misery to me because of my inadequacy. Friday I took off to consider my progress, and instead I got caught in all the details of the new ranch. And I grew frightened of this property. It is so much. One person or two have not the right to have so much. Then Steve came Saturday. And Steve is a member of I AM, * a very complicated pseudo-psycho religion  for people who want to dodge responsibility. That\x{2019}s all right if he doesn\x{2019}t go about conversion of us. And I am afraid that Steve is not going to be all right at all. Can\x{2019}t tell yet, of course. Anyway Francis* and Ritch and Tal and Ed were all up here and it was a terrific week end and it left me rather limp and raggy. And today I am still raggy and have to gather myself in. And I\x{2019}m frightened that I\x{2019}m losing this book in the welter of other things. The war about to break. I don\x{2019}t think it will, and everything. Play goes on the road. Philly Oct. 19. Must write to Annie Laurie. Neither Wally nor Brod in it and I don\x{2019}t care about that. A curious megalomania took them over. Rightly I guess. I hear The Long  Valley was well reviewed* in the East. Joe hasn\x{2019}t touched it. Maybe he is irritated at me. I don\x{2019}t know. But that is his business, not mine. Carol is nearly four hundred pages along on her typing. Hope she stops pretty soon and puts up the front against the outside. I find that I am trying to get done early these days and that is entirely wrong. Today I am going to discipline myself by working all day. Can\x{2019}t have this time barrier up. It would ruin the book. Must throw out the world for a little time more\x{2014}a month perhaps. We\x{2019}ll see, but I must keep it leisurely and not try to get done too fast. Must remember that. We don\x{2019}t have to put in a new pipe [Ed.\x{2014}water line] until we want to. Just get the house ready. That\x{2019}s the thing. This book is my sole responsibility and I must stick to it and nothing more. This book is my life now or must be. When it is done, then will be the time for another life. But, not until it is done. And the other lives have begun to get in. There is no doubt of that. That is why I am taking so much time in this diary this morning\x{2014}to calm myself. My stomach and my nerves are screaming merry hell in protest against the inroads. I won\x{2019}t be glad when it is done so why try to hurry it done? Now, I hope I calm down enough to start work again.

Yesterday was an unhappy maundering bust. And today doesn\x{2019}t look much better. It started early. Parsons* told in her column that Chaplin was coming for the weekend and already real estate people are trying to sell stuff. This meant guarding against [Ed.\x{2014}intrusions]. I am all mixed up, but this time I simply won\x{2019}t let myself. After all I have a book to write. Once it is written it will be all right. Then I can do things. And then I probably won\x{2019}t want to. This is a hell of a day. I must get down to it now and prove to myself that I can still concentrate no matter how badly. Time to go now.

I am convinced that Carol shall not do the dull final draft. And at the same time there must be a great deal to do with the manuscript. My hand writing is bad now. One more month\x{2014}one more.

That is a bargain. Today I shall work slowly and try to get that good feeling again. It must be. Just a little bit every day. A little bit every day. And then it will be through. And the story is coming to me fast now. And it will be fast from now on. Movement fast but the detail slow as always. I seem to be delaying pretty badly today. Half an hour gone already and I don\x{2019}t care because the little details are coming, are getting clearer all the time. So the more I wait, the more of this book will get written. How about the jail. Today, the preacher and Tom and the raid on the tent and the killing of the preacher [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 26]. Tom\x{2019}s escape. Kills. Goes back to the camp to hide. Tom\x{2014}half bitterness, half humane. Escapes in the night. Hunted, hunted. Over the last pages Tom hangs like a spirit around the camp. And in the water brings stolen food. Must get to work now. The thing speeds up.

            "Friday again and a short week. Has gone quickly. I think the work has been pretty good but I can\x{2019}t tell. I\x{2019}ve a funny feeling about it. And a change is coming over me\x{2014}a goatish sexuality. The summer has been just the opposite\x{2014}very low. Now it is rising rapidly. Maybe the weather, I don\x{2019}t know. Maybe the burden of the work getting near an end has something to do with it. No mail of importance this morning. Not even requests for things. Today is quiet. I should be able to get my work done fairly easily. Furnace men coming this afternoon. I hope they come early. There is one fly in this room and I can\x{2019}t find him. I hope next week the work comes as well as this week. I think it will. And 10,000 [Ed.\x{2014}words] next week instead of 8,000. Got the fly. He is the last. Now\x{2014}no hurry today. Plenty of time. Yesterday, I finished early and wasted a great deal of time. Today I can\x{2019}t do that. Take all the time on the manuscript I want. It is Friday and I can finish gradually for the week. This leisurelyness must go on although the tempo gets faster the details must be as slow. Today the hiding of Tom and the scene with his mother [Ed.\x{2014}the end of Chapter 26]. The cut in wages. Tom has to go. Getting together. The drop to starvation level of the wages. The trapped quality. Must get it in\x{2014}Difficulty of getting clean. No soap. No money to buy soap. Then peaches. The rush of workers and the fight for the peaches. Fight to get them. Must get this all in. There\x{2019}s so damned much in this book already. I must keep it coming. Furnace men came. Means we can get in to San Jose today. Must get to work.

Monday again and I think it is my last week. I\x{2019}m almost dead from lack of sleep. Can\x{2019}t go to sleep. I don\x{2019}t know why. Just plan for the ending. Pat was here for the week end. He read the first part\x{2014}400 pages. He is very volatile. Likes it very much, he said. I hope he doesn\x{2019}t over sell* it. Too many superlatives can spoil its chances. I hope he lays low and lets people find out about it if they will. Well any way, that\x{2019}s the story. Saturday and Sunday went out to the ranch. Set a lot of gopher traps. Caught four and have ten traps out now. Can gradually work them out if I keep after them. Word from Pittsburgh that M & M is playing to crowded houses. Hope it gets a little run. It could pay for the  whole damned ranch if it wanted to. And also it could pay Viking out on the contract. Well enough of that. My stomach is shot to pieces with tiredness. If I could only get some sleep I\x{2019}d be all right. Twelve hours I\x{2019}d like. Carol is back at typing. Poor kid, but there is to be no final draft, thank goodness. Well, I might as well get to the work. No one is going to do it for me.",

It is becoming almost her usual state of mind. She used to blame it on other things. Now she blames herself and that is worse and she mourns more. I just don\x{2019}t know what to do.

I can work as long or as little as I want. The work flows easily and is fun. Why should I hurry? I\x{2019}ll stay relaxed if I can. I hope this can be a relaxed book. There are so few of them now and the world really needs them for the world is tight and knotted now. A good fire is burning in the fire place and the room is warm. And I can even work at night if I want to. I can do anything,  but I usually wind up doing the same things every time. There isn\x{2019}t very much variation in a given man. I haven\x{2019}t been or felt so quiet in years. Of course, the birth of other peoples\x{2019} unease are in me but of myself I am at peace. Perhaps a kind of anaesthesia. I don\x{2019}t know. But I seem to be aware at least. Back still hurts and stomach ache has come to join it nicely now. Maybe it really is the flu. Can\x{2019}t tell, don\x{2019}t even want to. I\x{2019}ll just sit here by the fire and set down words. Nothing wrong with that. I should be opening the page for the book work of today. There are so many things to go into this book. An astonishing number of things. But I\x{2019}ll get them all in if I just relax and get them in day by day and only worry about the 2000 words of each day\x{2019}s work.

            "The second part of the novel\x{2019}s dedication\x{2014}\x{201c}To TOM who lived it\x{201d}\x{2014}refers to Thomas Collins (1897?-1961), the novelist\x{2019}s chief source, guide, discussant, and chronicler of accurate migrant information. Collins not only put Steinbeck in touch with the real-life prototypes of the Joads and Jim Casy, but himself served as Steinbeck\x{2019}s real-life prototype for Jim Rawley, the fictional manager of the \x{201c}Weedpatch\x{201d} government camp. (That camp became an oasis of relief for the harried Joads, and is featured in Chapters 22 to 26 of The Grapes of Wrath.) An intrepid, resourceful, and exceptionally compassionate man, Collins was the manager of a model Farm Security Administration camp, located in Kern County at the southern end of California\x{2019}s Central Valley. The Arvin Sanitary Camp (featured in the fourth installment of Steinbeck\x{2019}s 1936 San Francisco News reports, \x{201c}The Harvest Gypsies,\x{201d} a documentary forerunner of The Grapes of Wrath) was one of several proposed demonstration camps intended to provide humane, clean, democratic\x{2014}but temporary\x{2014}living conditions for the growing army of migrant workers entering California from the lower Middle West and Dust Bowl region. (More than two dozen camps were planned in 1935 by the Resettlement Administration, the forerunner of the F.S.A.; by <<1940|9n:1>>, with New Deal budgets slashed by conservatives in Congress, only fifteen were actually completed or under construction.)6 Collins possessed a genius for camp administration\x{2014}he had the right mix of fanaticism, vision, and tactfulness\x{2014}and he and Steinbeck, both Jacksonian democrats, hit it off immediately in late summer 1936, when the novelist went south on the first of several grueling research trips during  the next two years to investigate field conditions. (Contrary to popular belief, Steinbeck never traveled with a migrant family all the way from Oklahoma to California.)",

Many \x{201c}have speculated,\x{201d} his biographer writes, \x{201c}about what happened to change Steinbeck after The Grapes of Wrath.

Here, perhaps, is a private tragedy, a cautionary tale, to parallel the tragic aspects of his fiction: an isolated individual writer composed a novel that extolled a social group\x{2019}s capacity for survival in a hostile economic world, but he was himself so nearly unraveled in the process that the unique qualities\x{2014}the angle of vision, the vital signature, the moral indignation\x{2014}that made his art exemplary in the first place could never be repeated with the same integrated force. Although he published prolifically after The Grapes of Wrath, it would be twelve years before Steinbeck summoned the resources to attempt, in East of Eden, another \x{201c}big\x{201d} book with a similarly exalted conception and theme. A less hardy writer might have become an anachronism after the success of a celebrated novel like The  Grapes of Wrath, but Steinbeck showed the capacity to survive through change. His new writing lacked the aggressive bite of his earlier work (he adamantly refused to repeat himself), but it had the virtue of being so different that it generally kept him from becoming a parody of himself. <<After 1940|9n:0>> much of his important writing centered on explorations of a new topic\x{2014}the dimensions of individual choice and imaginative consciousness. A prophetic post-modernist, Steinbeck\x{2019}s real subject in Cannery Row, East of Eden, Sweet Thursday, The Winter of Our Discontent,  and Journal of a Novel was the creative process itself.",

Steinbeck\x{2019}s proprietary attitude toward his recently completed novel, so passionately defended in his January 16 letter to Covici, began to fade with each subsequent writing project. By <<1955|9n:0>>, invited to respond to a couple of diametrically opposed scholarly essays on The Grapes of Wrath which had recently been published in The Colorado Quarterly, Steinbeck was content to make only modest claims for his greatest book: \x{201d}I don\x{2019}t think the Grapes of Wrath is obscure in what it tries to say. As to its classification and pickling, I have neither opinion nor interest. It\x{2019}s just a book, interesting I hope, instructive in the same way the writing instructed me. Its structure is very carefully worked out and it is no more intended to be inspected than is the skeletal structure of a pretty girl.

Contrary to what most critics have observed\x{2014}or wished\x{2014}Steinbeck was not very much interested in doctrinaire political theories at this point of his career. Benson sets the record straight in his True Adventures of John Steinbeck, and in his subsequent \x{201d}Through a Political Glass, Darkly: The Example of John Steinbeck,\x{201c} Studies in American Fiction,  12 (Spring 1984), 45\x{2014}59.

            "That ranch. Carol\x{2019}s father, Wilbur Henning, a San Jose realtor, had found a forty-seven-acre homestead, known locally as the \x{201c}Old Biddle Ranch\x{201d} (settled originally <<around 1850|18:0>>). It was located in an isolated area off the Santa Cruz Highway near the Summit, about five  miles out of Los Gatos. Edna B. Stone, the owner, was asking \$16,000. The Steinbecks considered her price too steep and began negotiating to lower it, a process that consumed a great deal of attention and emotion during the coming weeks. Views of the Biddle ranch site are available in Anne-Marie Schmitz, In Search of Steinbeck (Los Altos, CA: Hermes Publications, 1978), pp. 11, 12, 15, 16; and in Don Herron, The Literary World of San Francisco & Its Environs (San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1985), p. 221.

Mackinnon, wrote ahead to see if Steinbeck would mind being interviewed for the thesis. In reply, Steinbeck wrote: \x{201c}Let your young woman write, but let her beware. I\x{2019}ll lie\x{2014}not because I want to lie, but because I can\x{2019}t remember what is true and what isn\x{2019}t. I\x{2019}m reasonably sure that my biography, particularly when it is autobiography, is the worst pack of lies in the world. And the awful thing is that I don\x{2019}t know which are lies and which aren\x{2019}t. Compensation maybe, I don\x{2019}t know. It\x{2019}s so bad that my wife, who is a truthful person, really likes the truth, I mean, and puts some store in it, is all confused, too.

I\x{2019}m not trying to be funny\x{2014}this is a tragic truth\x{201d} (John Steinbeck/C. N. Mackinnon, letter, ca. late July 1938). Armed with this caveat, Danford sent Steinbeck a five-page questionnaire which he managed to fill out without being very specific or informative.

Russian-born Lewis Milestone (1895\x{2014}1980) was one of Hollywood\x{2019}s most respected directors and a winner of two Oscars (for Two Arabian Knights in 1928, and for All Quiet on the Western Front, 1930). His best films\x{2014}he was especially good at adapting novels\x{2014}were known for their vivid realism, sharp dialogue, and fluid camera technique, all exemplified in his masterful production of Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck admired Milestone, who was considered something of a maverick in Hollywood, and interceded with Annie Laurie Williams (something he rarely did) so that Milestone could make The Red Pony. Production of the movie (Steinbeck wrote the script), however, was held up for many years and wasn\x{2019}t released until <<1949|9c:0>>.

Steinbeck was too old to be conscripted into active duty, and his \x{201c}radical\x{201d} past, which had become the subject of an extensive FBI file, repeatedly foiled his request for an Army officer\x{2019}s commission. (\x{201c}Do you suppose you could ask Edgar\x{2019}s boys to stop stepping on my heels? They think I\x{2019}m an enemy alien. It\x{2019}s getting tiresome,\x{201d} Steinbeck told United States Attorney General Francis Biddle, who in turn forwarded Steinbeck\x{2019}s note to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover on May 11, 1942.) Eventually Steinbeck worked under the auspices of the Office of War Information, and the Air Force, for which he wrote\x{2014}and John Swope photographed\x{2014}Bombs Away: The Story of a Bomber Team (New York: The Viking Press, 1942). In 1943 he was accredited as a war correspondent and spent June through October of that year writing dispatches from Europe and North Africa for the New York Herald Tribune, which were later collected as Once  There Was a War (New York: The Viking Press, 1958). Jackson Benson, in True Adventures of John Steinbeck (pp. 485\x{2014}541), is the first to establish the factual order and significance of Steinbeck\x{2019}s World War II activities. At J. Edgar Hoover\x{2019}s direction the FBI kept detailed files on American writers they considered subversive and dangerous. Steinbeck was no exception; the FBI monitored him from <<1939|9c:0>>, when The Grapes of Wrath first appeared, to March 1968, nine months before he  died.
