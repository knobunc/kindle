            "In early October, rebuked often enough by his wife\x{2019}s example and by her words (Ma Joad\x{2019}s indomitableness owes much to Carol\x{2019}s spirit), Steinbeck roused himself from \x{201c}self-indulgence\x{201d} and \x{201c}laziness\x{201d} to mount the final drive. Blessedly, the last five chapters of the novel came to him so abundantly that he had more material than he could use. Some time <<around noon|9h>> on Wednesday, October 26, he completed the last 775 words of the novel; at the bottom of the concluding manuscript page, Steinbeck, whose writing was normally minuscule, scrawled in letters an inch-and-a-half high, END#. It should have been cause for joyous celebration, but between bouts of bone-weary tiredness and nervous exhaustion, he felt only numbness, and maybe a little of the mysterious satisfaction that comes from giving his all. He certainly had no grasp of the book\x{2019}s effectiveness or its potential popularity, and he even warned The Viking Press against a large first printing. Following a four-day recuperation in San Francisco, the Steinbecks moved to their new home (still under construction), where Carol finished typing the 751-page typescript, and together they made \x{201c}routine\x{201d} final corrections. The only \x{201c}clean\x{201d} copy of the book was sent to his New York agents, McIntosh and Otis, on December 7, 1938, roughly six months after he sat down to write the novel. Elizabeth Otis\x{2019}s visit to Los Gatos in late December 1938, to smooth out some of Steinbeck\x{2019}s \x{201c}rough\x{201d} language, its enthusiastic reception at Viking (marred briefly by the wrangling which ensued over the novel\x{2019}s controversial ending) all struck the novelist as anticlimactic. (He was by then suffering from severely painful sciatica, undoubtedly caused by a herniated spinal disk, one of the ironic results of his sedentary existence.)",

Drive continues. Today the argument against sin and the means of losing it\x{2014}the quest for the true spirit [Ed.\x{2014}middle section of Chapter 4]. This should be a good sharp section. Duke did not arrive. Probably today. Dinner at Louis\x{2019}s very interesting. He read two sections and there is a very fine tone to them. Conversation re hay fever, a curious rationalization. Locked her [Ed.\x{2014}Steinbeck\x{2019}s Airedale terrier] in my bathroom last night. She was good. Weather is superb\x{2014}hot but not too hot. Letter from Paul Jordan Smith* who wants to come up end of the month. One hundred days of writing will finish this book, I think. That is four months. Means I should get first draft done in October and that is allowing lots of lee way for last. Must leave room every day for further comment. Turtle sequence stands up [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 3].",

People want to come to see me next Monday. Can\x{2019}t be. Just want to sit. Day not propitious. Have a loose feeling that makes me nervous. Will get to work and try to forget all the bothers. I get nuts if not protected from all the outside stuff. Dinner tonight at Tolertons\x{2019}. * I like them very much. Must make note of work progress at the end of this day. I want to finish my stint if I possibly can. Impulses to do other things. Wind blowing over me, etc. But must continue today for sake of discipline. Well, the stint is done but I think I\x{2019}ll try to finish out the chapter tomorrow [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 4]. Be about one more page. Lionel Smith came over.

Have really only one page to do to keep up with schedule but I want to do this short over-chapter complete in one day and so I will work at it until it is done.

This is the longest diary I ever kept. Not a diary of course but an attempt to map the actual working days and hours of a novel.

I find I am not very satisfied with the numbering of these chapters. It may be that they will simply be numbered with large numerals for the general and small for the particular. The reason is that I want the reader to be able to keep them separate in his mind. Today Joad and Casy come home and find the house deserted. They meet Muley Graves and he tells them where Joad\x{2019}s parents are. They sleep in Muley\x{2019}s deserted house. Background for the moving comes in here.

Late start today. Last night two boys down from Stanford. They tied me in knots as nicely as I could do it to anyone when I was in Stanford. Nice kids and bright and alert ones.

Also the night comes with sleeping in the darkening plain and stars [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 6]. And after that I think a small inter chapter or maybe a large one dealing with the equipment of migration.

Comes now the\x{2014}fifteenth day. Charley Cushman\x{2019}s mother killed in an accident. Letter today. Last night Carol, reading Tristram Shandy,* suddenly got an impulse to make her will. Copied mine for form. Can\x{2019}t see the connection\x{2014}T.S. and wills. Just a business proposition and a wise thing to do but nevertheless it got into my dreams which have been deep and clear lately and I dreamed a confused mess made up of Dad and his failures and me and my failures. Some way connected with the store. Poor Dad couldn\x{2019}t run a store, he didn\x{2019}t know how. And I used to eat pies at noon hour and was ashamed of selling things. No mercantile ability in either of us and the store failed and left a terrible mark on Dad.* That was all in the dream and Gene\x{2019}s death. It was a dark mess and I have trouble throwing it off. And the news now is so stupid, insane. The race in its leaders any way hardly deserves to survive. And now I am ready to go to work and I am glad to get into other lives and escape from mine for a while. Yesterday the used car lot and today Tom and Casy go home to the family, if they get there (Ed.-beginning of Chapter 8]. Must go slowly and introduce these people fully and carefully for I will be with them a long time. After spending nearly seven thousand dollars to be alone and quiet, the neighbors run their radio all day and I get the benefit of it. Carol can hear them reading their letters to each other. We may have to move from this beautiful place. This is a day when I could readily lose myself in irrelevant reflection and recrimination and so I must go to work now and stop such a possibility. This book can\x{2019}t stop any more and this chapter must get under way. Well she\x{2019}s done. Slow but I think good. I wanted this part slow. Tomorrow there is difficulty.",

Now it is Saturday and we got up early and I am to work early. I don\x{2019}t see any reason for not doing a full day\x{2019}s work [Ed.\x{2014}2,000 words]. This is a huge job. Mustn\x{2019}t think of its largeness but only of the little picture while I am working. Leave the large picture for planning time. If only I could do this book properly it would be one of the really fine books and a truly American book. But I am assailed with my own ignorance and inability. I\x{2019}ll just have to work from a background of these. Honesty. If I can keep an honesty it is all I can expect of my poor brain\x{2014}never temper a word to a reader\x{2019}s prejudice, but bend it like putty for his understanding. If I can do that it will be all my lack of genius can produce. For no one else knows my lack of ability the way I do. I am pushing against it all the time. Sometimes, I seem to do a good little piece of work, but when it is done it slides into mediocrity. Well the day\x{2014}Ma, Pretty Boy Floyd, Grampa and Granma and maybe Noah. Can\x{2019}t tell whether I will get to Noah. To work now. Well, that\x{2019}s done and I\x{2019}ve caught up for my hangover\x{2014}one day ahead [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 8]. Try to get another next Saturday. Watch the old people. Might get out of hand but I want them mean and funny. And Monday will be",

Now a new week. Must slow down and take it easier. Saturday had a feeling of exhaustion near to collapse. I guess I\x{2019}d been working too hard. It\x{2019}s not the amount of work but the almost physical drive that goes into it that seems to make the difference. I should take it a little easier or I won\x{2019}t be finishing. I have just a page or so over 100 typescript pages done out of 600. I have five times as much work left to do as I have done already, so I must conserve strength because I do want to do this novel and finish it this time. Must get no fatal feelings about it. Change from Shawnee to Sallisaw [Ed.\x{2014}Oklahoma]. Make earth red, not grey\x{2014}and above all I must take my time. That is the most important of all. Take it easy. I don\x{2019}t mean to write less or less forcefully but to keep the frantic quality out of my approach. Well it is time for work now. Now the day\x{2019}s work is done. The prayer and Al comes home [Ed.\x{2014}finish of Chapter 8]. Tomorrow the sorting of things to go and this should be a well done thing. I think I\x{2019}ll play The Swan* before because there too is the loss of a loved thing of the past. I think I\x{2019}ll do that. Beth is coming tomorrow and she has done just that. Just that. Sorted over the trappings of her dead life. And so the book moves on steadily, forcefully, slowly, and it must continue to move slowly. How I love it. Dinner with Louis and Mary tonight. Now on to thought. Tomorrow must be poetry.",

This seems to be the approximate usual time. Good sleep last night and I feel fine and relaxed. I\x{2019}m not going to work on Saturday this week so that I will get fresh and rested. Something has been hard on me. I don\x{2019}t know whether the intensity of the work or what. John Street* is in the hospital. We\x{2019}ll go up to see him tonight. Don\x{2019}t know what to take him. Cigars maybe. We\x{2019}ll eat on the way. I go to the dentist at <<four|9c:1>>. After which digression, get back to work. And I feel relaxed about it too. Yesterday was a nervous drive. I notice my handwriting shows that. Beginning at any rate of the conference [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 10]. Enter all the rest of my actors. John, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and the two little kids [Ed.\x{2014}Ruthie and Winfield]. The circle of squatting men and the plans, the order of authority, and the texture of the family. I only expect to crack the surface of this conference today for it is important and should be dealt with at some length. Carol got new dresses today. Glad to see the cracking of the poverty complex. But she does feel a little sinful. Should lose that. It isn\x{2019}t good. Wrote to Pare today and to Le Roy.* The last about Louis and a trick just to see if it would work. And now I should go to work. And will with a note to follow. (Well, there she is\x{2014}just the truck coming home with the new people entering, and tomorrow the conference.) And that will be",

Something has been hard on me. I don\x{2019}t know whether the intensity of the work or what. John Street* is in the hospital. We\x{2019}ll go up to see him tonight. Don\x{2019}t know what to take him. Cigars maybe. We\x{2019}ll eat on the way. I go to the dentist at <<four|9c:1>>. After which digression, get back to work. And I feel relaxed about it too. Yesterday was a nervous drive. I notice my handwriting shows that. Beginning at any rate of the conference [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 10]. Enter all the rest of my actors. John, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and the two little kids [Ed.\x{2014}Ruthie and Winfield]. The circle of squatting men and the plans, the order of authority, and the texture of the family. I only expect to crack the surface of this conference today for it is important and should be dealt with at some length. Carol got new dresses today. Glad to see the cracking of the poverty complex. But she does feel a little sinful. Should lose that. It isn\x{2019}t good. Wrote to Pare today and to Le Roy.* The last about Louis and a trick just to see if it would work. And now I should go to work. And will with a note to follow. (Well, there she is\x{2014}just the truck coming home with the new people entering, and tomorrow the conference.) And that will be

Now it is Monday. And I took two days off and have a little trouble getting into the swing. For one thing Pat* can\x{2019}t meet royalty payment and is paying one third, with notes for another two thousand. This is all right if it doesn\x{2019}t indicate that he is in difficulty. That worries me a little but not much. Ed came for the weekend. Good Ed.* We ran down to [Ed.\x{2014}Pacific] Grove Saturday night to inject 300 hagfish\x{2014}ugly, slimy brutes, and much better looking full of formaldehyde. That knocked the slime. Ritch and Tal* drove back. They are all coming next Saturday night for the week end of the Fourth. Short story volume [Ed.\x{2014}The Long Valley] comes out in early Sept. It will collapse of course but I\x{2019}ll be glad to have it out. May sell three or four thousand copies. People looking at the next lot. We really must get out of here. I would love so much to go over to the Aptos country [Ed.\x{2014}south of Santa Cruz]. Hear the ocean that I love. But must let Carol decide since she lives so much in her environment. Got a mild muscle [Ed.\x{2014}spasm] in my chest and was dizzy this morning. I don\x{2019}t know why. This place is getting as noisy as a city lot. There is a lot of talk in the diary this morning\x{2014}reason is to relieve the tension and get even with myself. Doesn\x{2019}t matter since I can work later this afternoon. Now for a discussion.

End of Book One
My system of time has indeed collapsed. Today\x{2014}the last day of June and I have finished in one month Book One, the background of this novel. One general chapter today and it will be a short one, too. The empty and deserted houses [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 11]. Yesterday the work was short and I went over the whole of the book in my head\x{2014}fixed on the last scene, huge and symbolic, toward which the whole story moves. And that was a good thing, for it was a reunderstanding of the dignity of the effort and the mightyness of the theme. I felt very small and inadequate and incapable but I grew again to love the story which is so much greater than I am. To love and admire the people who are so much stronger and purer and braver than I am. This morning a letter from Barry saying his group was non partisan,* and I wrote back to place myself on record as partisan to the common people. There can be left no doubt of that. And now the sun is shining and the birds, 50 different kinds, are singing in the trees outside my window, and the woods are green and beautiful. It is a good day in which to finish the first book. I have all of my people in whom I shall use, some of them well described. I hope all of them alive because they must live. Carol is washing now. I thought I would move but I can\x{2019}t. There is more noise in the house than out here, even with the washing machine going. So I\x{2019}ll stay out here [Ed.\x{2014}porch deck] and work through it if I can. It isn\x{2019}t very long after all. My head aches today I don\x{2019}t know why. But I\x{2019}ll finish and I hope I\x{2019}ll have the new part ready by tomorrow. It would be good to have a few days off. I think I\x{2019}ll take them. Carol is right. Why should I rush? October and November and December will be enough to get it finished. Maybe I\x{2019}ll take the time off. I\x{2019}ll see. It would be good for me. And now to finish Book One. It occurs to me that I\x{2019}ll finish Book Two by the end of July and then two months for Book Three. And now Book One is done\x{2014}rhyme, rhyme. And I am going to take Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday off. I feel a little daring doing this but I think it will be better if I do. I\x{2019}m getting a tenseness and a weariness. I must get fresh. This will be the last until the 5th.",

Now time has caught up with me. I\x{2019}ve been four days off work, am all rested but by the same token I\x{2019}ve got to get back the rhythm. I think I can for I jolly well must. There are no two ways about it. Beginning the second book today and it must have the rolling sound of wheels and the clutter of cars and the panting across the country. The first general [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 12] and it must have the meat of the whole second volume in it. For a moment I was afraid to start but this diary is a good idea for it gives me the opening use of words every day. Long weekend. Ritch and Tal and Ed here. Danced Sunday night, went completely mad dancing. Never did such dancing\x{2014}every one for himself and Ed tippy-toeing around like a bear. All of us more drunk with high spirits than with anything else. Read Ed some little parts of this book and he finds them moving for which I am glad. They went home last night. This morning lots of quail. Play goes on the road with original cast. * Moore wants information for a critique* of some kind. Norwegian translation* coming, etc. Exciting but I can\x{2019}t allow excitement. Leave that for this winter. I want this done before the show comes out here. It is getting warm after all this time. Now back to the work. I feel fine about it. But during the four days off I have thought of the whole book. And it is rather like the prison term. Must not think too much of the end but of the immediate story\x{2014}instant and immediate. It is a long haul but what do I care[?] It will be done all of the rest of my life\x{2014}whatever is left of it. And that is not moody.

Now it\x{2019}s Thursday. Strange how I\x{2019}m fighting this book now. I think it is about to change now though because I am feeling more and more like work. The despair came on me for a while but although still nervous from it I think I am recovering. Today will be a kind of test case I guess. As Carol says, stay with the detail. Let the damn book go three hundred thousand words if it wants to. This is my life. Why should I want to finish my own life? The confidence is on me again. I can feel it. It\x{2019}s stopping work that does the damage. Today I finish another section of this big book, a page section that is. I wish this [Ed.\x{2014}ledger] book were all full. This daily work diary is really working this time and it is a good thing. Today word from Barry,* who wants to print my statement. Also from teacher\x{2019}s association asking for a speech, and Who\x{2019}s Who* for correction of proof. That\x{2019}s all the mail. Swedish translation* of T.F. arrived today, and the Norwegian is on the way. Getting quite a collection of translations. It will be a nice thing to have. Today I feel finally relaxed after the Fourth of July holiday. That seemed to wear me down rather than rest me. The work itself has rested me. Now the time is here to go to work. And I must go to work. And I\x{2019}m anxious today. Report later. Finished and I have a good feeling about today\x{2019}s work. I think it is better. More easy and moving.",

            "Now it\x{2019}s Thursday. Strange how I\x{2019}m fighting this book now. I think it is about to change now though because I am feeling more and more like work. The despair came on me for a while but although still nervous from it I think I am recovering. Today will be a kind of test case I guess. As Carol says, stay with the detail. Let the damn book go three hundred thousand words if it wants to. This is my life. Why should I want to finish my own life? The confidence is on me again. I can feel it. It\x{2019}s stopping work that does the damage. Today I finish another section of this big book, a page section that is. I wish this [Ed.\x{2014}ledger] book were all full. This daily work diary is really working this time and it is a good thing. Today word from Barry,* who wants to print my statement. Also from teacher\x{2019}s association asking for a speech, and Who\x{2019}s Who* for correction of proof. That\x{2019}s all the mail. Swedish translation* of T.F. arrived today, and the Norwegian is on the way. Getting quite a collection of translations. It will be a nice thing to have. Today I feel finally relaxed after the Fourth of July holiday. That seemed to wear me down rather than rest me. The work itself has rested me. Now the time is here to go to work. And I must go to work. And I\x{2019}m anxious today. Report later. Finished and I have a good feeling about today\x{2019}s work. I think it is better. More easy and moving.

Fairly early start today. And a beautiful day. Carol goes to look at real estate today. Wilkus came out with a word about a ranch in the mountains\x{2014}360 acres for \$12,000. Could sell off what we didn\x{2019}t want. We\x{2019}ll look at it anyway. It might be fine. No mail of any consequence today. French translation of M & M and IN. D. B. are in progress. * They get about. I wonder how this book will be. I wonder. Yesterday it seemed to me that the people were coming to life. I hope so. These people must be intensely alive the whole time. I was worried about Rose of Sharon. She has to emerge if only as a silly pregnant girl now. She has to be a person. Noah I think I\x{2019}ll lose for the time being and Uncle John and maybe for a while Casy. But I want to keep Tom and Ma together. Lots of people walking along the roads in this season. I can hear their voices. Louis has finished his book, first draft. * He must be glad, I guess. Well, it\x{2019}s time for me to go to work. Time to go and today I must get them camped. And the tent effect built. And the new people. And maybe a part of the history of this new couple [Ed.\x{2014}the Wilsons]. Well, that\x{2019}s done. The death of Grampa [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 13].",

This is a beautiful day, hot and clean. Last night Richardson of the Chronicle down. Spoke about a new literature section. I have nothing for it and the price is too low for Louis. Well, there you have it. This morning a request from CIO* to head a committee for organization of farm workers. Can\x{2019}t do it until this book is done. Mail was sparse today. This is a hell of a time to be writing a book. Everything in the world is happening and I must sit here and write. Well if I ever finish, it will be some kind of triumph. This good pen holds up beautifully. I guess it will last out the entire book. The more I think of it, the better I like this work diary idea. Always I\x{2019}ve set things down to loosen up a creaking mind but never have I done so consecutively. This sort of keeps it all corralled in one place. Soule phoned* that he wanted me to talk to the President, but I don\x{2019}t know what about or why. I\x{2019}ll do it if I can do any good but I\x{2019}ll be damned if I\x{2019}ll be another shirt front in a curious mob. I can\x{2019}t go on this way forever. My hand today will steady down I think because I am calm. And it is time now.",

I don\x{2019}t know why, but everything seems to be happening now. We are looking at ranches today, too. And yesterday we saw the most beautiful I have ever seen. I want that ranch.* We\x{2019}ll try to get it. Carol wants it too. And it is reported that [Ed.\x{2014}Wally] Ford is coming and all the time I go on working but I wonder whether my work isn\x{2019}t getting a shot-full-of-holes feeling. No word from Soule so I guess I won\x{2019}t have to meet the President. I would have but I didn\x{2019}t like it. Most brilliant weather now. Lovely. And time slips through my fingers. But so far the work has slipped through too so that in fifteen days I shall be half through this book. Probably the first of August no less. I don\x{2019}t know whether I can do the whole thing in one jump without a rest. We will see. May take a few days off when Book Two is done. Took four days when Book One was done. Tried to get some music but couldn\x{2019}t. Routine of the house more important. Will have to get on without it. Having to work through and around a thousand things anyway. Wish I could run away from everything to do my book. God, how I wish I could! It will be full of jitter at this rate. No other way, I guess. Well, to work\x{2014}or to try.",

Today much to my disgust the time has slipped away and it is the latest since I started this book. Not that it matters a great deal. Just work later. I\x{2019}ll get it done but it scares me to be late. We\x{2019}re hipped on this ranch. Can think of little else. But I must. Carol is mad over the place and so am I. Well I don\x{2019}t have to meet the President for which I am thankful. My lazy tendency is setting in now and I\x{2019}ll have to combat it. This book must be ready by the first of the year. Simply must. And that means solid work, completely solid. So this tendency must be put out of the way. Little mail this morning for which I\x{2019}m glad. Rusty sent sixty bottles of the fine red wine. Nice people. Too many things are happening. No word from the east [Ed.\x{2014}from Pat Covici, or from McIntosh and Otis].

Today I have a leisurely feeling getting into the work whereas yesterday it was one of frantic rush. Today it will be 68 pages [Ed.\x{2014}of handwritten manuscript].

And I must get my people to California before then. By the first of August they should be there, come what may. I think all of today will be in the hamburger stand [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 15].

Well last night a wire that Pat is in trouble. I\x{2019}ve been expecting it. I\x{2019}m so sorry for him. Our two thousand dollars, our year\x{2019}s royalties, are pretty important to us but we\x{2019}re eating and working and that\x{2019}s more than we have any right to expect. Being broke won\x{2019}t kill us but it will wipe Pat out. And he is such a nice fellow. The irritations are increasing. I wonder whether I will ever finish this book. And of course I\x{2019}ll finish it. Just work a certain length of time and it will get done poco a poco. Just do the day\x{2019}s work. Some days I think I am getting sour but I don\x{2019}t know. Then comes a good day and I am lifted up again. And I can\x{2019}t tell from the opening. Often in writing these beginning lines I think it is going to be all right and then it isn\x{2019}t. Just have to see. I hope it is all right today. It is hot today, but by powdering my arm and hand it seems to be all right. I hope the whole rest of the summer isn\x{2019}t boiling, but if it is, it is, and that\x{2019}s all there is to it. The work must go on day after day until one day it will be finished. In ten days I will be half done. 50 days of work. I hope we get to California by then because I would like half the time out here. That is the important part\x{2014}out here. Today I must get the family split\x{2014}perhaps Tom and Casy to Santa Rosa, or Tom at least for the part [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 16]. I think it may be all right.

This is Friday and the last day of a short week. I am ashamed of the short week but it must be put down to accident. Actually I am just about up to schedule on wordage. And I have to take a small loss. So far it is very small. Pat did not have the creditors\x{2019} meeting yesterday. I have a feeling he will pull out of this. He has an advance sale list of 8000 on the short stories a month before publication, which is phenomenal. I hope to goodness he can pull out. He is a plugger though. Letter from Burns Mantle for a reprint of M & M. * I hope everything will blow over and let me go on with this work. Only 8 days to finish half. And today I cut out another section. Record from Ford today. Jokes and very good. Startling effect hearing yourself addressed from the phonograph. No word from Pare. Have been expecting him. I won\x{2019}t mind a rest after today. I\x{2019}m taking my time now but the wordage continues. That\x{2019}s the way it should be, too. Now I should be getting back to work. To the Rays\x{2019} tonight for dinner and I suppose I\x{2019}ll get tight and I don\x{2019}t much care. In a way it is good and in a way bad. But if I am to drink anything Friday night is the best night for it. I\x{2019}m a bit addled but I can do it all right. If my self discipline will let me go on working while hell pops around my ears, I\x{2019}ll be all right. I\x{2019}ll know I am all right. I just hope the work isn\x{2019}t suffering. And now to it. Must build some on this one-eyed man [Ed.\x{2014}the junkyard scene in Chapter 16].",

Lots of excitement. Carol went with Nellie [Ed.\x{2014}her mother, who was vacationing in Santa Cruz] last night. Good for her, the change. Restless night for me on account of eating melon and strange and scary to be alone. Must write about this some time. It is a curious thing. Wind blew terribly. This morning lots of mail. Elizabeth writes everything that has been happening. I think Pat will get clear some way\x{2014}letters from John [Ed.\x{2014}Barry], from Henning,* and from the O\x{2019}Brien guy.* Pleasant weekend but a little exhausting. Cerf* wired some plan whereby he carries Pat. I don\x{2019}t know. Wired Elizabeth. Mustn\x{2019}t interfere with her in any way. They\x{2019}re a fine bunch of people. I like Random House. Of course, I don\x{2019}t know anything about them financially, but I like the books they print. And I like Cerf. Well, anyway I haven\x{2019}t lost a minute of work on account of this difficulty. That\x{2019}s good. That\x{2019}s the fine discipline. If I can only keep that up this book will be finished in due course. Now I have all day to work and there is no need of hurrying. I can piddle out the two thousand words. Working in the main house because of telephone\x{2014}so I won\x{2019}t have to run in, I mean. It is a curious windy day with the weather changing and fallish and leaves falling. Probably be an early and mean winter. It is time for me to get to work. Got to. Even if I have plenty of time. I get assailed with old times. Last night particularly. The flies are in this house on my arms. Here I could have had only half a page of work done [Ed.\x{2014}still on Chapter 16]. This diary is really valuable to me though. Keeps me from writing letters. And now to work. This pen writes thinner if it is steeper. This has been a good pen to me so far. Never had such a good one.

So many things are going on I\x{2019}m nearly crazy. * I simply must keep my head. Pare is at last making headway and I wish to God I could jump in but this book comes first. I wonder if I am dramatizing myself. I wouldn\x{2019}t be surprised. Let\x{2019}s get down to earth. This book I\x{2019}m working on is just a book like any other. Let\x{2019}s work on it and not get wild. If it flops it flops, and that is that. I think I want it to be fine mainly because Carol does so much. But no reason to go nuts about it. Still no clarification of Pat\x{2019}s business. It should clear up in the next little while. It has to. There must be some way but they\x{2019}ll work that out. Now at last I am growing calm. This diary is a marvelous method of calming me down every day. Pretty soon I\x{2019}ll have to turn back pages to continue it. I really should have word today how Pat comes out. Carol\x{2019}s throat is better today. I\x{2019}m going in and kiss her now. And then I\x{2019}ll feel better. And then I can go to work.

Well still we\x{2019}re hung up in the matter of the east [Ed.\x{2014}Covici\x{2019}s situation]. No word today at all and this is Wednesday. Carol is improving in the throat now. She dreamed about the Biddle ranch last night. She wants it terribly. I must make every effort to get it for her. It is the most beautiful place I have ever seen. No doubt of that at all. There are now four things or five rather to write through\x{2014}throat, bankruptcy, Pare, ranch, and the book. If I get this book done it will be remarkable. Well, two pages a day will do it in time. And the time slips by. Just a matter of doing the daily stint. Feel pretty good but am impatient about all the things hanging over me. Can\x{2019}t help it. But I\x{2019}ll get it done. I just hope it is some good. With this split attention I don\x{2019}t know. I really don\x{2019}t. Today I\x{2019}ll finish this general chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 17] of the change on the roads and the enemies, though maybe the enemies should wait until California. I think so.

Well the work has pretty much gone to hell. Might just as well take it in stride. The pressure broke down the strict discipline and Friday went to S.F. with Ed. I was tired. Then the difficulty and that didn\x{2019}t help, and the trouble in the east is still going on. Should break out of this this week I think. Then a letter from Muni* about T.F. Which I would like to do. If I could get Louis to work with me it would be good. I\x{2019}ll try when the time comes but meanwhile the pressure increases with little way out nor hope of ease. And so I simply must establish the discipline again and maintain it for a while. A slightly less frantic outlook would make some difference. The dog [Ed.\x{2014}female in heat] has been completely frantic lately and it must stop. Carol is entirely well now and able to take over the phone, etc. Not entirely well, but on the road if there are no complications. I should be able to go ahead. I am so lazy and the thing ahead is so very difficult. I think it is laziness that is getting me. How easily we can transpose our laziness into something else. But I\x{2019}ve done books before and what I have left to do now is one ordinary length novel. About the length of I.D.B. or a little longer and that will be the end.

Although I got up early this morning I\x{2019}m late getting to work and I don\x{2019}t in the least know why. No word from the east today. Be a letter tomorrow and all the trouble will be done. For a while at least. No more word from Muni. My stipulations were tough and perhaps turned them away. Now this work is getting very hard. Wellman down yesterday and apparently G.S.K. doesn\x{2019}t intend to give him a chance. Well I\x{2019}ve done all I could there. I\x{2019}m getting worried about this book. I wish it were done. I\x{2019}m afraid I\x{2019}m botching it. I think it would be a good thing to stop and think about it but I hate to lose the time. But I want it to be good and I\x{2019}m afraid it is slipping. But I must remember that it always seems that way when it is well along. I think I\x{2019}ll plug them into California today. Letter from Tom [Ed.\x{2014}Collins]\x{2014}worried about this committee. So am I sometimes. But the trip isn\x{2019}t so bad. Whatever that means. I have no reason except laziness, but I simply must get these people across the desert and into the field. Must do that and soon. Now to work at least into thought of work. So long!",

Again to work. And lots of things have happened. Pare called from L.A. Will be here next week end. I\x{2019}ll be glad to see him. And perhaps many things will be clear. No word from Muni. I don\x{2019}t know how that stands. And no word from the ranch. I don\x{2019}t know how that stands either. Either they are bluffing or they are arguing it out. I don\x{2019}t know which, or maybe they have lost interest in us. Can\x{2019}t tell. Just have to wait, I guess. Now I think that covers what has happened. Did ever a book get written under such excitement? Well, two got written while mother and dad were ill* and if that could happen\x{2014}anything could. The Viking contract went through I guess. And so the time approaches to get to work and I wonder whether I can. Well I\x{2019}ve got to and there\x{2019}s no end to that.",

Early to work this morning and this is a general chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 19], which\x{2014}although they are highly charged\x{2014}are nevertheless the repository of all the external information and material. In a way they are easier to write and in a way harder. But yesterday I got into the swing of doing my daily stint again. The hammering next door nearly drives me nuts, but no way out of that, I guess. Just have to work through it. Take all the time I need. Mustn\x{2019}t think of the hammering. Dan James and Chaplin coming up this afternoon. I\x{2019}ll be done early though. The hammering got me and I came into my room which is now the quietest in the house. And it seems pleasant to me. Looking forward to seeing Pare very much. Such a nice guy. Such fun if he isn\x{2019}t too tired. Want him to see the ranch, too. I\x{2019}m dawdling today. The hammering is terrific even in here. I don\x{2019}t care if I do dawdle some. The lady who is doing the thesis* writes fearfully. The ranch is still the most beautiful place in the world. I love that place. We will enjoy it. I\x{2019}ve sneaking fears that it is too good and too beautiful for me. Beth will love it, too. In fact, every one we like will love it. It is so beautiful. But I can\x{2019}t go on this way for I must get my slow day\x{2019}s work done. And now is a good time to start on it. What a wonderful pen this is. It has and is giving me perfect service\x{2014}never stops flowing for a second and never overflows and blots a word. But I\x{2019}m stalling now to keep from going to work. To work.",

This has been the most crowded week so far in our lives and it will carry through. For Pare comes tomorrow and Chaplin* was here last night. Lots of fun, good fun. Dan James looks as young as ever. Gail and George Saturday. Big week end all in all. Today the wind is blowing hard and it makes Carol miserable. She did such a good dinner last night and so beautifully. All this entertaining falls heavily on her shoulders. Now away from the daily life and into the book. I read a couple of chapters to company last night and could see the whole thing clearly. Also it doesn\x{2019}t sound bad. Today is going to take a long time. I have to get on the line of my family again. The outline of today will carry over some days.

Today Pare arrives. Yesterday was too much for me. I fought it really hard until I realized that the fight was obscuring the picture. I have some force but not enough for that apparently. Today I feel better I hope. Anyway I try to go on today. I\x{2019}m afraid for this book, really afraid. Part of the difficulty lies in all the shooting at me, but the other half lies within myself. That\x{2019}s why it is going to be good to see Pare. Maybe it will be easier when I see him. My dream of early finish goes glummering. Plodding is all right until a day comes when I can\x{2019}t even plod anymore. I feel limited, too. M.B. [Ed.\x{2014}Margery Bailey] hunting. C.A.S [Ed.\x{2014}Carlton Allyn Sheffield] hunting and sniping. No help for that. The book is to do. I\x{2019}ve fallen in these holes before even in the little Mice book. I had great trouble.* None are east and they aren\x{2019}t even going to grow east. Good luck is even worse for work than bad luck. I have been too fortunate lately. Of course it balances with the long years on the other side. Can\x{2019}t tell. Can\x{2019}t tell. Just have to plod for 90,000 words. Plod as the people are plodding. They aren\x{2019}t rushing.

This is Tuesday. Pare came over the week end. Big time. Carol sprained her ankle. Went down to the peninsula with Pare and spent night at Chaplin\x{2019}s place [Ed.\x{2014}Pebble Beach]. Talked all night. Of course, I lost a day of work. I am afraid that Pare doesn\x{2019}t need me on this job and I think he knows it but hasn\x{2019}t admitted it yet. I\x{2019}ll work if I am needed. But I wish I could be left alone until Christmas. I am getting tired\x{2014}very tired. I have at least 6 weeks yet of work by any measuring, and I must re-establish the discipline. Must get tough. So many attractive things are happening that it is difficult. And the ranch on top of everything else. But I must get this done. After all, I\x{2019}ve always worked under some kind of pressure: T.F. while mother was ill, I.D.B while Dad was ill, M & M while this house was going up. Always something. Just more this time. I can do it and I will do it, by God. It is just the discipline that is all. I\x{2019}m wasting time today and I don\x{2019}t care much. Everything goes in circles and I must think WORK. Such strangeness, such strangeness. I\x{2019}ve read parts to people and they like the parts or say they do, but I wonder whether the whole thing will bear up. I wonder. I don\x{2019}t want to get cocky about it. I really shouldn\x{2019}t have told anyone. I get the benefit of the doubt now when before I didn\x{2019}t. The hammering on the next door house is awful. Everything is curious. Pare made me feel better about the country at large. But I am very confused. French rights to I.D.B. are sold now. So many things are happening. This is probably the high point of my life if I only knew it. I will spend today getting straightened out and on a level again\x{2014}thinking. I am fresh again and that is good. My brain is clear for details. I can almost finish in one piece I should think. I want to. I shouldn\x{2019}t be thinking about getting done. Should be thinking only of the story and, by God, I will. I can\x{2019}t let future interfere with the hardest, most complete work of my life. I simply can\x{2019}t. Always I have been weak. Vacillating and miserable. I wish I wouldn\x{2019}t. I wish I weren\x{2019}t. I\x{2019}m so lazy, so damned lazy. This year though I have made up for last year\x{2019}s lay off. I really have batted out a lot of words. I would go through until winter if I could. But if I don\x{2019}t lay off it will be done, and if I do lay off I\x{2019}ll lose the thread. I am simply incapable of working any way but hard and fast. That is the only way I can make it. This is too bad. It is almost impossible in fact but I must get calm and quieted before I can go on. I mean that streak yesterday was curiously indecent.

Now I have lost a great deal of time. I have been remiss and lazy, my concentration I have permitted to go under the line of effort. If this had been the first time I should be very sad. But I am always this way. I can concentrate and under some circumstances I can work. My job is to get down to it and now. For all the pressures, there is only one person to blame and I must force him into it. The point is that I am over half through with this book. What remains is in length an average novel. I can do it and must. Nothing must interfere from this time on. We had rest and change and relaxation and now there is no excuse. Every day now\x{2014}every day. It is just like starting all over, the reluctance and everything. Today is Monday. This is the start into the final [Ed.\x{2014}stretch]. I\x{2019}ve been interested in other things. Can\x{2019}t be anymore. Nothing but the Joads. Must get to it. That is getting to be the forerunning statement in a failure. Expectation. I don\x{2019}t know what I expect or what is expected of me. Nor care. This family must live. I have the laziness and the reluctance that is always present in the beginning. The ranch is bought and there\x{2019}s nothing to do about that. Business is set. Nothing in the world to interfere. And there is this frightful fear that I won\x{2019}t be able to do it, that it is too much for me. And there are dates that mustn\x{2019}t be kept, and arrangements that must not be made. And the time has come. I must get down to the work although my stomach is water about it.",

Was ever a book written under greater difficulty? Now it\x{2019}s the house. We listed it for sale and we\x{2019}re swamped. People [who] want to buy it want to look at it. We\x{2019}ll be living in a gold fish globe until it is sold I guess. No mail but bills. And the weather is beautiful. Yesterday John Collier* and Jerry [indecipherable]. Went up to the ranch and fooled around and lost time. I can\x{2019}t help it. I\x{2019}ll get finished by Christmas, and that\x{2019}s all I can hope for.

The time goes on and the manuscript crawls on. And after a long time it will be done. I am not sad. In fact, I am pretty glad now. Time is going. The noise of pounding* next door is simply terrific. There are days when they pound their heads off. Today they seem to be just hammering as loudly as they can. There is proof today how bad a merchant I would be. Our house is for sale and a quasi-customer is coming out. I am full of resentment\x{2014}not that I don\x{2019}t want to sell it, but that I don\x{2019}t like the position of seller. The new ranch is so lovely. And we\x{2019}re in no hurry to sell. But it is listed and I guess we\x{2019}ll have to show it. Hope there isn\x{2019}t a train of people looking. Now for today in the work. I\x{2019}ll finish a chapter today and be ready for a general on Monday. I think this last chapter has been weak in detail. Must get it back. Got to get them out of Hooverville and into a federal camp for they must learn something of democratic procedure. But today it is just a matter of getting them out of camp [Ed.\x{2014}end of Chapter 20]. Casy is in jail. Uncle John is drunk. Tom will go to the grocery and trail Uncle John. God, this pounding is terrible today. I have to ignore it as much as I can. They\x{2019}re laying floors, Christ! What a place, and we came here looking for quiet. No mail today except requests. That\x{2019}s about all my mail is any more. People who want things. What more can I expect? I\x{2019}ve really asked for it in a way. There doesn\x{2019}t seem to be any other way. Here they come to look at the house. I wish I didn\x{2019}t feel so much resentment about being a seller instead of a buyer. Seem to be a lot of women. Let Carol take care of them. I\x{2019}ll stick out here and do my own work. Finish out this page. I feel really very good today. The flow of story is coming back to me. The feel of the people. And the feel of speech and the flow of action. So it must go and if it takes until Christmas, then that is the way it must be. I can\x{2019}t be rushed. I must have enough time.

Today is Saturday and half a day\x{2019}s work will finish the chapter. * So I\x{2019}ll do it. The end of the Hooverville chapter. Carol is typing now and the book is beginning to seem real to me. Also Carol got the title last night \x{201c}The Grapes of Wrath.\x{201d} I think that is a wonderful title. Must query Elizabeth, but will use it any way until I am forbidden. The looks of it\x{2014}marvelous title.* The book has being at last. I think really that a good month will finish it. Middle of October anyway, which is six weeks. No mail again but requests. Young man wants to talk, wants to be a writer. What could I tell him? Not a writer myself yet. But the story is having a reality finally. I said that before but I am stunned with the fact. I think I never really believe I will finish a book until it is finished. And Carol\x{2019}s draft is going to be the final. Let them [Ed.\x{2014}The Viking Press] pay for retyping if they want. We\x{2019}ll put it in shape so it is readable with ease. I just hope it is good. Now to work. Finished the chapter, by God. Now a general and I don\x{2019}t quite know which one it will be.",

Beginning Chapter 9 general [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 21]. This one will be of the locals and their fight to preserve themselves. It should be a decent one. First, our house is sold.* Just one more thing. We hadn\x{2019}t intended to sell it so soon but the first people who looked at it wanted it. Well\x{2014}the last four books have been written in a mess. This one might as well be. There hasn\x{2019}t been a moment of peace since I started. And it gets worse. The Stones are still on the ranch. Must see whether we can get them off. We have to have some place to lay our heads. And I need some place to work. How I wish my book were done. But I feel very good about it now. It is really moving and I can finish it if I am only given time. I say six weeks more. It may take more or less. But I want to take plenty and yet not too much. The title is still good. I like it very much. Today I have an early start and except for a little stomach ache from too much excitement, I feel fine. And now even the stomach ache is gone. And I am about ready to start Chapter 9.

I\x{2019}ll try to dodge it. Would start a million fights. I feel very sick today. Dreamy sleep and coughing from too much smoking and confused by too many things happening and pretty worn out from too long work on manuscript. Have to cut down smoking or something. I\x{2019}m afraid this book is going to pieces. If it does, I do too. I\x{2019}ve wanted so badly for it to be good. If it isn\x{2019}t, I\x{2019}m afraid I\x{2019}m through in more ways than one. Carol is working too hard now, too. And I\x{2019}ve been with this book so long now that I don\x{2019}t know much about it, I\x{2019}m afraid. Well\x{2014}have to take that chance. After all, if only I wouldn\x{2019}t take this book so seriously. It is just a book after all, and a book is very dead in a very short time. And I\x{2019}ll be dead in a very short time too. So the hell with it. Let\x{2019}s slow down, not in pace or wordage but in nerves. I wish I could do that. I wish I would write only one page a day but I can\x{2019}t. Got to go on at this rate or suffer for it. It must go on. I can\x{2019}t stop. But oh! if I only had lots of time. I need to settle down some. Burned my pen finger with a match the other day and the blister comes right where the pen fits. And it hurts like hell and my handwriting reaches new heights of badness because of it. Taylor [Ed.\x{2014}next-door neighbor] just rakes his yard and putters. But he would probably do a better job of this than I am doing. More ship-shape. I wish I were he sometimes. Just rake the yard and mix a little cement. How did I ever get started on this writing business anyway? To work.

If he insists I know I can\x{2019}t refuse, but it is hard to accept right at this time. Letters from Putnam, who has something he wants; from Louis, who doesn\x{2019}t like my title; from Eric, who has been travelling. Alice Cohee is coming tomorrow. All in all, it is a tough time with so many things, so many demands, that if I am not careful, I\x{2019}ll crash. I feel the weariness creeping up on me again as it did that day when I was really in danger of collapse. But I can\x{2019}t now. Must finish this book. Simply must. And I don\x{2019}t know how near it is to finished. I just can\x{2019}t tell. It ought to be long. Carol has 150 pages typed now and she is racing ahead. She\x{2019}ll turn two hundred this week. This is really a God send, getting it all in type so quickly. But I wonder whether it will be any good. I\x{2019}ve got to slow down. My nervousness will get into it if I don\x{2019}t. The trouble is that I\x{2019}m getting a finish feeling into it, and I shouldn\x{2019}t. Can\x{2019}t get that for a long time yet. Must go slow. I have plenty of time. It\x{2019}s this god damn moving that makes it hard. When Carol finishes what I have finished it will be easier because then she will be able to take care of the outside business again. Now we just have to let things go and it is that letting go that bothers me so much. Our house sold so quickly that it made our heads swim. One partial visit was all and now the money has gone in and we don\x{2019}t own our house any more. God damn dog is barking now and it is time to get to work anyway. Well that is the end of another big section all finished [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 22]. Pare wired that he advised against my going on the air right now.

There\x{2019}s a kind of safety in keeping in the book that I like. Tomorrow I must find Noah and send him down the Colorado River. And now to work.

Gaining weight and looks pretty happy. This week end to Jacksons\x{2019} to meet Adamic.* Should be fun. Went to the ranch yesterday. Ed quite crazy about it. Stones still on it. Supposed to go on Monday or Tuesday, I hope. We must get our work started there. Today my work is not so well mapped out. Just have to work along. And the end is not in sight. Have that time trouble. * Don\x{2019}t know yet how I am going to get over it. Maybe I\x{2019}ll figure it out later. Seems an awful problem now. But I\x{2019}ll get it worked out, I guess. It might strain the whole structure if I am not very careful. And I can\x{2019}t go on through it. I suppose it would be best to be very direct about it. That is usually the best. Today I think the general and I don\x{2019}t quite know which one it is. Can\x{2019}t very well do two more on camp life, or can I? I can to a certain extent. And then tomorrow do a general on music possibly, or on joy possibly. But today I should close up the first camp chapter [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 22] because the next is the dance chapter.

Not over four thousand words. I want all of the things they do. I want this to precede the long chapter of the dance [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 24]. Beginning a review of Long Valley\x{2014}lyrical and without much meaning. However the book hasn\x{2019}t much meaning.

Next week the ranch will be vacant. Shower last night. The first of the season. Laid the dust and this morning felt like Mexico. Nostalgic air. Full of curious whispers. Carol will get to page 270 today. How she is working! She\x{2019}ll be caught up in two more weeks. And then she can lay off for the duration and that will be good. I should be through in another month if I last. 25 days. Fifty thousand more words will finish it I am sure. Now to work.

            "This book has become a misery to me because of my inadequacy. Friday I took off to consider my progress, and instead I got caught in all the details of the new ranch. And I grew frightened of this property. It is so much. One person or two have not the right to have so much. Then Steve came Saturday. And Steve is a member of I AM, * a very complicated pseudo-psycho religion for people who want to dodge responsibility. That\x{2019}s all right if he doesn\x{2019}t go about conversion of us. And I am afraid that Steve is not going to be all right at all. Can\x{2019}t tell yet, of course. Anyway Francis* and Ritch and Tal and Ed were all up here and it was a terrific week end and it left me rather limp and raggy. And today I am still raggy and have to gather myself in. And I\x{2019}m frightened that I\x{2019}m losing this book in the welter of other things. The war about to break. I don\x{2019}t think it will, and everything. Play goes on the road. Philly Oct. 19. Must write to Annie Laurie. Neither Wally nor Brod in it and I don\x{2019}t care about that. A curious megalomania took them over. Rightly I guess. I hear The Long Valley was well reviewed* in the East. Joe hasn\x{2019}t touched it. Maybe he is irritated at me. I don\x{2019}t know. But that is his business, not mine. Carol is nearly four hundred pages along on her typing. Hope she stops pretty soon and puts up the front against the outside. I find that I am trying to get done early these days and that is entirely wrong. Today I am going to discipline myself by working all day. Can\x{2019}t have this time barrier up. It would ruin the book. Must throw out the world for a little time more\x{2014}a month perhaps. We\x{2019}ll see, but I must keep it leisurely and not try to get done too fast. Must remember that. We don\x{2019}t have to put in a new pipe [Ed.\x{2014}water line] until we want to. Just get the house ready. That\x{2019}s the thing. This book is my sole responsibility and I must stick to it and nothing more. This book is my life now or must be. When it is done, then will be the time for another life. But, not until it is done. And the other lives have begun to get in. There is no doubt of that. That is why I am taking so much time in this diary this morning\x{2014}to calm myself. My stomach and my nerves are screaming merry hell in protest against the inroads. I won\x{2019}t be glad when it is done so why try to hurry it done? Now, I hope I calm down enough to start work again.

They\x{2019}ll be recruited first [Ed.\x{2014}to pick peaches at Hooper Ranch in Pixley], then escorted by state police, then by farm deputies. That night Tom creeps out and penetrates the lines.

I love it. I like the smell and the process. I\x{2019}m sure he will. Funny man. Seems so dreadfully lonely. Maybe that\x{2019}s why he wants to come up so much. The rotisserie will make him love it.

            "Early start this morning. Can\x{2019}t ever tell. Worked long and slowly yesterday. Don\x{2019}t know whether it was good, but it was a satisfactory way to work and I wish it would be that way every day. I\x{2019}ve lost this rushed feeling finally and can get back to the easy method of day by day\x{2014}which is as it should be. Got the iron gate [Ed.\x{2014}in exchange] for an autograph. That is a bargain. Today I shall work slowly and try to get that good feeling again. It must be. Just a little bit every day. A little bit every day. And then it will be through. And the story is coming to me fast now. And it will be fast from now on. Movement fast but the detail slow as always. I seem to be delaying pretty badly today. Half an hour gone already and I don\x{2019}t care because the little details are coming, are getting clearer all the time. So the more I wait, the more of this book will get written. How about the jail. Today, the preacher and Tom and the raid on the tent and the killing of the preacher [Ed.\x{2014}Chapter 26]. Tom\x{2019}s escape. Kills. Goes back to the camp to hide. Tom\x{2014}half bitterness, half humane. Escapes in the night. Hunted, hunted. Over the last pages Tom hangs like a spirit around the camp. And in the water brings stolen food. Must get to work now. The thing speeds up.

And a change is coming over me\x{2014}a goatish sexuality. The summer has been just the opposite\x{2014}very low. Now it is rising rapidly. Maybe the weather, I don\x{2019}t know. Maybe the burden of the work getting near an end has something to do with it. No mail of importance this morning. Not even requests for things. Today is quiet. I should be able to get my work done fairly easily. Furnace men coming this afternoon. I hope they come early. There is one fly in this room and I can\x{2019}t find him. I hope next week the work comes as well as this week. I think it will. And 10,000 [Ed.\x{2014}words] next week instead of 8,000. Got the fly. He is the last. Now\x{2014}no hurry today. Plenty of time. Yesterday, I finished early and wasted a great deal of time. Today I can\x{2019}t do that. Take all the time on the manuscript I want. It is Friday and I can finish gradually for the week. This leisurelyness must go on although the tempo gets faster the details must be as slow. Today the hiding of Tom and the scene with his mother [Ed.\x{2014}the end of Chapter 26]. The cut in wages. Tom has to go. Getting together. The drop to starvation level of the wages. The trapped quality. Must get it in\x{2014}Difficulty of getting clean. No soap. No money to buy soap. Then peaches. The rush of workers and the fight for the peaches. Fight to get them. Must get this all in. There\x{2019}s so damned much in this book already. I must keep it coming. Furnace men came. Means we can get in to San Jose today. Must get to work.

The roof is on the new house. Begins to look like a house. And another agent from Hollywood wanting to buy The Red Pony. Carol took it and shot it. I don\x{2019}t want that stuff.

The air is very heavy today. Must be going to rain. It is stifling. But it is quiet. No pounding or anything like that any more. The mail this morning\x{2014}just a mass of requests. Driving me crazy. Terribly nervous today. As Carl* used to say\x{2014}I\x{2019}m nervous as a cat. Cats always seemed to me to be fairly placid animals.

Monday again and I think it is my last week. I\x{2019}m almost dead from lack of sleep. Can\x{2019}t go to sleep. I don\x{2019}t know why. Just plan for the ending. Pat was here for the week end.

Hope it gets a little run. It could pay for the whole damned ranch if it wanted to. And also it could pay Viking out on the contract. Well enough of that. My stomach is shot to pieces with tiredness. If I could only get some sleep I\x{2019}d be all right. Twelve hours I\x{2019}d like. Carol is back at typing. Poor kid, but there is to be no final draft, thank goodness. Well, I might as well get to the work. No one is going to do it for me.

            "And the opening was good, I think. Ed thinks so too. In fact, he thinks it is better than I do. Last night I went to bed by <<9:30|2>> and dreamed strangely. Woke up early. Still the back ache and stomach ache. Maybe I have the flu again, too, but I don\x{2019}t think so. The pen writes a little thickly. I hope this isn\x{2019}t a psychic pen. I\x{2019}m having enough trouble with such things. Visitations so definite that I don\x{2019}t see how I can imagine them. Perhaps I am just crazy. I\x{2019}ve never been sure I am not. Called Carol last night. She is low and mourning. I wonder if she is ever going to be even reasonably happy. It isn\x{2019}t fair that she has so much unhappiness. It is becoming almost her usual state of mind. She used to blame it on other things. Now she blames herself and that is worse and she mourns more. I just don\x{2019}t know what to do. Poor darling, I want so much for her to be happy. No sun today. It is <<10:30|2>> and I feel the crowding of work and the urge to hurry. But why? I have all day. I can work as long or as little as I want. The work flows easily and is fun. Why should I hurry? I\x{2019}ll stay relaxed if I can. I hope this can be a relaxed book. There are so few of them now and the world really needs them for the world is tight and knotted now. A good fire is burning in the fire place and the room is warm. And I can even work at night if I want to. I can do anything, but I usually wind up doing the same things every time. There isn\x{2019}t very much variation in a given man. I haven\x{2019}t been or felt so quiet in years. Of course, the birth of other peoples\x{2019} unease are in me but of myself I am at peace. Perhaps a kind of anaesthesia. I don\x{2019}t know. But I seem to be aware at least. Back still hurts and stomach ache has come to join it nicely now. Maybe it really is the flu. Can\x{2019}t tell, don\x{2019}t even want to. I\x{2019}ll just sit here by the fire and set down words. Nothing wrong with that. I should be opening the page for the book work of today. There are so many things to go into this book. An astonishing number of things. But I\x{2019}ll get them all in if I just relax and get them in day by day and only worry about the 2000 words of each day\x{2019}s work. That\x{2019}s the only way to do it, I have found. But damn it, I have to learn it over again every time. And that\x{2019}s all for this section for today.",

            "That ranch. Carol\x{2019}s father, Wilbur Henning, a San Jose realtor, had found a forty-seven-acre homestead, known locally as the \x{201c}Old Biddle Ranch\x{201d} (settled originally <<around 1850|18:0>>). It was located in an isolated area off the Santa Cruz Highway near the Summit, about five miles out of Los Gatos. Edna B. Stone, the owner, was asking \$16,000. The Steinbecks considered her price too steep and began negotiating to lower it, a process that consumed a great deal of attention and emotion during the coming weeks. Views of the Biddle ranch site are available in Anne-Marie Schmitz, In Search of Steinbeck (Los Altos, CA: Hermes Publications, 1978), pp. 11, 12, 15, 16; and in Don Herron, The Literary World of San Francisco & Its Environs (San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1985), p. 221.

            "Joe and Charlotte. Writer, editor, and critic, Joseph Henry Jackson (1894\x{2014}1955), and his wife, Charlotte, carried on a lively intellectual and artistic household in Berkeley, across the Bay from San Francisco where Jackson reigned for a quarter of a century (from 1930 until his death) as the influential and judicious Book Editor of the San Francisco Chronicle, and the originator of a weekly Pacific Coast radio program, \x{201c}Bookman\x{2019}s Guide.\x{201d} Jackson had a particularly strong interest in the literature and lore of California, about which he wrote and/or edited several books, among them an anthology, Continent\x{2019}s End: A Collection of California Writing (New York: McGraw Hill/Whittlesey House, 1944), which included a selection from In Dubious Battle. The Jacksons and the Steinbecks had been friends and traveling companions for several years. Jackson\x{2019}s book, Mexican Interlude (New York: Macmillan, 1936; rev. ed., 1937), includes a brief scene, in Chapter XV, of the Steinbecks in the market at Huejotzingo. Inscribing a copy of the first edition, Jackson wrote: \x{201c}For John and Carol Steinbeck, who helped us see Mexico. Especially to John for the kind things he said about this book, and for his graciousness in accepting without comment his appearance as an actor in its pages....\x{201d} Quoted in DeMott, Steinbeck\x{2019}s Reading (p. 59). Steinbeck\x{2019}s \x{201c}kind words\x{201d} occurred in one of the only book reviews he ever wrote, \x{201c}A Depiction of Mexico, by an Author with No Pattern to Vindicate,\x{201d} San Francisco Chronicle, May 31, 1936, Section D, p. 4. Although Steinbeck grenerally disliked critics and reviewers, he trusted and admired Lewis Gannett (New York Herald Tribune), Wilbur Needham (Los Angeles Times), and Jackson. In response to Jackson\x{2019}s essay, \x{201c}John Steinbeck: A Portrait,\x{201d} Saturday Review of Literature, 16 (September 25, 1937), <<11\x{2014}12|5a:0>>; 18\x{2014}one of the first serious national exposures for Steinbeck\x{2014}the novelist said: \x{201c}It\x{2019}s a nice article, Joe, but what pleases me more than the article is that around it and through it is the feeling that you genuinely do like us and that is very important to us.\x{201d} (John Steinbeck/Joseph Henry Jackson, letter [October 1937]; courtesy of Joseph Henry Jackson Papers, Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley). Jackson not only reviewed Steinbeck\x{2019}s books favorably, but\x{2014}drawing on his familiarity with Steinbeck\x{2019}s personal and intellectual life\x{2014}also wrote informative introductions to the two-volume The Grapes of Wrath (New York: Limited Editions Club, 1940), and to The Short Novels of John Steinbeck (New York: The Viking Press, 1953). His widow recalled that Steinbeck was always pleased with her husband\x{2019}s work (Charlotte Jackson/Robert DeMott, telephone interview, July 17, 1980).",

            "Thesis. Merle Danford, a graduate student at Ohio University, was planning a master\x{2019}s degree thesis on Steinbeck. Her English Department advisor, C. N. Mackinnon, wrote ahead to see if Steinbeck would mind being interviewed for the thesis. In reply, Steinbeck wrote: \x{201c}Let your young woman write, but let her beware. I\x{2019}ll lie\x{2014}not because I want to lie, but because I can\x{2019}t remember what is true and what isn\x{2019}t. I\x{2019}m reasonably sure that my biography, particularly when it is autobiography, is the worst pack of lies in the world. And the awful thing is that I don\x{2019}t know which are lies and which aren\x{2019}t. Compensation maybe, I don\x{2019}t know. It\x{2019}s so bad that my wife, who is a truthful person, really likes the truth, I mean, and puts some store in it, is all confused, too. For years she struggled to keep her head above water, but she is sinking finally. I\x{2019}m really sorry about this, but your candidate will just have to take her chance. I\x{2019}m not trying to be funny\x{2014}this is a tragic truth\x{201d} (John Steinbeck/C. N. Mackinnon, letter, ca. late July 1938). Armed with this caveat, Danford sent Steinbeck a five-page questionnaire which he managed to fill out without being very specific or informative. Steinbeck\x{2019}s answers are appended to Danford\x{2019}s \x{201c}A Critical Survey of John Steinbeck: His Life and the Development of his Writings\x{201d} (Ohio University, 1939), and reprinted, with commentary by Robert DeMott, \x{201c} \x{2018}Voltaire Didn\x{2019}t Like Anything\x{2019}: A 1939 Interview with John Steinbeck,\x{201d} Steinbeck Quarterly, 19 (Winter-Spring 1986), <<5-11|5a:0>>.",

Russian-born Lewis Milestone (1895\x{2014}1980) was one of Hollywood\x{2019}s most respected directors and a winner of two Oscars (for Two Arabian Knights in 1928, and for All Quiet on the Western Front, 1930). His best films\x{2014}he was especially good at adapting novels\x{2014}were known for their vivid realism, sharp dialogue, and fluid camera technique, all exemplified in his masterful production of Of Mice and Men. Steinbeck admired Milestone, who was considered something of a maverick in Hollywood, and interceded with Annie Laurie Williams (something he rarely did) so that Milestone could make The Red Pony. Production of the movie (Steinbeck wrote the script), however, was held up for many years and wasn\x{2019}t released until <<1949|9c:0>>.

            "Military service. Congress passed The Burke-Wadsworth Selective Service Bill on September 14, 1940. Steinbeck was too old to be conscripted into active duty, and his \x{201c}radical\x{201d} past, which had become the subject of an extensive FBI file, repeatedly foiled his request for an Army officer\x{2019}s commission. (\x{201c}Do you suppose you could ask Edgar\x{2019}s boys to stop stepping on my heels? They think I\x{2019}m an enemy alien. It\x{2019}s getting tiresome,\x{201d} Steinbeck told United States Attorney General Francis Biddle, who in turn forwarded Steinbeck\x{2019}s note to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover on May 11, 1942.) Eventually Steinbeck worked under the auspices of the Office of War Information, and the Air Force, for which he wrote\x{2014}and John Swope photographed\x{2014}Bombs Away: The Story of a Bomber Team (New York: The Viking Press, 1942). In 1943 he was accredited as a war correspondent and spent June through October of that year writing dispatches from Europe and North Africa for the New York Herald Tribune, which were later collected as Once There Was a War (New York: The Viking Press, 1958). Jackson Benson, in True Adventures of John Steinbeck (pp. 485\x{2014}541), is the first to establish the factual order and significance of Steinbeck\x{2019}s World War II activities. At J. Edgar Hoover\x{2019}s direction the FBI kept detailed files on American writers they considered subversive and dangerous. Steinbeck was no exception; the FBI monitored him from <<1939|9c:0>>, when The Grapes of Wrath first appeared, to March 1968, nine months before he died. The chilling story is evident in Jack Sirica, \x{201c}FBI tracked Steinbeck\x{2019}s travels and friendships for nearly 30 years,\x{201d} San Jose Mercury News, June 14, 1984, pp. 1, 12A, and in Herbert Mitgang, Dangerous Dossiers: Exposing the Secret War Against America\x{2019}s Greatest Authors (New York: Donald I.
