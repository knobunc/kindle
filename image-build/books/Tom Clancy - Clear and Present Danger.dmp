            "For this training mission, an honest-\x{200b}to-\x{200b}God fighter pilot had \x{201c}volunteered\x{201d} to be trucked out to the boonies, where another helicopter had draped a parachute over a tree to simulate a genuinely shot-\x{200b}down airman, who had in turn activated a genuine rescue-\x{200b}beacon radio. One of the new tricks was that the chute was coated with a chemical that fluoresced on ultraviolet light. Johns did the copilot's job of activating a low-\x{200b}power UV laser that scanned ahead, looking for the return signal. Whoever had come up with this idea deserved a medal, PJ thought. The worst, scariest, and always seemingly the longest part of any rescue mission was actually getting eyeballs on the victim. That was when the gomers on the ground, who were also out hunting, would hear the sound of the rotor and decide that they might as well bag two aircraft on the same day . . . His Medal of Honor had come on such a mission over eastern Laos , when the crew of an F-105 Wild Weasel had attracted a platoon of NVA. Despite aggressive support from the Sandy team, the downed airmen hadn't dared to reveal their position. But Johns had coldly decided not to go home empty, and his Jolly had absorbed two hundred rounds in a furious gunfight before getting both men out. Johns often wondered if he'd ever have the courage\x{2014}lunacy\x{2014}to try that again.

As some men were born to play baseball, or to act, or to drive race cars, Bronco Winters had entered the world for the single purpose of flying fighter planes. He had the sort of eyesight to make an ophthalmologist despair, coordination that combined the best of a concert pianist and the man on the flying trapeze, and a much rarer quality known in his tight community as SA\x{2014}situational awareness. Winters always knew what was happening around him. His airplane was as natural a part of the young man as the muscles in his arm. He transmitted his wishes to the airplane and the F-15C complied at once, precisely mimicking the mental image in the pilot's mind. Where his mind went, the airplane followed.",

He'd successfully taken one case to the Supreme Court and on a <<five-\x{200b}to-\x{200b}four|10a:0>> decision managed to get his client a new trial, where the death sentence had been bargained down to life plus ninety-\x{200b}nine years.

Why did it happen . . . ? Maybe hereditary, probably not. No, blood pressure had nothing to do with it. Almost impossible to diagnose under the best of circumstances. Did he complain of headaches?

There was an ache at the back of his head to remind him that he was still not fully adjusted to the altitude, but a couple of Tylenol caplets went to work on that, and he knew that his job didn't involve much in the way of physical activity. He ordered breakfast sent up and went through some setting-\x{200b}up exercises to work the kinks out of his muscles. The morning jog was definitely out, however. Finished, he showered and shaved. Service was good here. Just as he got his clothes on, breakfast arrived, and by <<nine o'clock|6>> he was ready for work. Clark took the elevator down to the lobby, then went outside. The car was waiting. He got in the front.",

It had been a two-\x{200b}hour drive from the airport, and on arrival each man had been assigned a bunk in the building. The rest of the bunks had already been filled with sleeping, snoring men. Soldiers, of course. Only soldiers snored like that. It had struck him at the time as ominous. The only reason why young men would be asleep and snoring <<just after ten at night|10>> was fatigue. This was no vacation spot. Well, that was no surprise either.",
