If anything, some of the young ones were too loyal. There\x{2019}d been incidents. A couple of the Marine guards, just weeks before, had got a little too much pop-skull into them and flashed eye-resonating commercials at three of the natives with their hand weapons.

            "Shanghai! Jewel of the Orient! By <<ten o\x{2019}clock that night|6>> we were in a floating bar along the Bund. I was getting down the tenth, or maybe it was the twentieth, well-spiked Moke, checking out the dark-haired little bar girls with their flapper haircuts, wondering if I ought to try connecting with one before I got too paralyzed to do anything about it. Gert was drinking straight GNS, and with every shot getting more and more upright and careful in her speech, and glassy-eyed. That was a funny thing about Gert Martels. She was not a bad-looking woman, not counting the scars that slashed down the left side of her face, from ear to jawbone. But I had never come on to her, nor she to me. A lot of it had to do, I guess, with the military code and the trouble you could get into fraternizing between officers and enlisted personnel, but lots of other Os and EPs had taken their chances and gotten away with it. And it had been a long, long time since Mitzi. \x{201c}How come?\x{201d} I asked, waving to the waitress.",
