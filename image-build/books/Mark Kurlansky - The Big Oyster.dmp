In 1790, when the first U.S. census was conducted, 49,401 people were living in what were to become the five boroughs of New York City. By <<1930|9:0>>, when all the oyster beds had been polluted and shut down, the population was 6,930,446, almost double what it had been at the start of that century. In the seventy years since then, perhaps in recognition that the space was nearly filled to capacity, the population grew by only about half a million. New Yorkers have long regarded their city as unnatural, in contradiction with nature. They talk of leaving the city \x{201c}to see some nature.\x{201d} Perhaps it is not just unnatural but a threat to nature. Perhaps that many people just won\x{2019}t fit.

He wrote in 1839: \x{201c}On the way out we pass many Indian shell heaps bleached as white as snow, which they much resemble at a distance. Some of them on the banks of the creek extend from fifteen to thirty feet upon the bank, and under water, in many instances entirely across the creek. These shell heaps, long ere this, has excited our curiosity and we had proposed all manner of questioning concerning their authors. These questions my father did not and could not satisfactorily answer, and we were consequently unsatisfied, and hence there was a constantly recurring inquiry.\x{201d}",

The fur of beavers, the second largest rodent on earth next to the capybara, was from <<about 1550|18:0>> to 1850, the more valuable. It was used primarily for hats, and the Russians, who had been the chief suppliers, had so greedily pursued this industry that by the dawn of New Netherlands, these rodents were nearly extinct in Russia and Scandinavia. Western Europeans, trying to compete with the Russians, had driven their beavers to complete extinction. The beaver hat industry was able to continue only because of North American pelts. The French had moved into the hat business with Canadian pelts, but now the Dutch had a chance to compete. Van der Donck estimated in midcentury that eighty thousand beavers were being killed annually.',

It was the road of the Wieckquaesgecks, the Indian route into New Amsterdam, along which the group had been slaughtered fifteen years earlier. The trail ran down what would become upper Broadway and past fields of wild strawberries, then cut over to the East Side and dropped down along what would become Second Avenue, veering west to a brook where the Plaza hotel now stands, through the woods to pick up the route that would be Broadway at Twenty-third Street, and followed Broadway down to the town on the southern tip.

This pond where the Lenape once fished, where the Dutch picnicked on an adjacent hill to have a view of it, was becoming a mucky, malarial swamp, strewn with trash and festering with disease. The trashier it became, the more it was abused. Since it had become a despoiled zone, the most polluting industries, such as butchers and hide tanners, were installed there.

In 1686, the last of the wolves in Manhattan, the only remaining feared predator, were killed. The flour barrel replaced the fur pelt as the most valued cargo, and remained so for more than one hundred years. In 1678, the colonial government required the sifting, \x{201c}bolting,\x{201d} of flour for export to be done at the port, thus facilitating inspection and quality control. As a result, port trade increased. In 1678, 3 ships, 8 sloops, and 7 boats came to New York. Only sixteen years later, 60 ships, 62 sloops, and 40 boats came.

They planted small young oysters from Arthur Kill and the Raritan River, but these took two or three years to reach a marketable size. They also tried Long Island oysters with slightly more success. With production declining, the market for oysters in New York City was growing. As early as 1816, Chesapeake Bay oysters were being sold in New York. Chesapeake oysters had the advantage that, having been reared in warm water, even transported to New York they had a faster first growing season than a native New Yorker.

Typical of baymen of the time, he did some fishing, carted seaweed, sold cord-wood to New York City by way of the Fire Island Inlet, and did some oystering. Avery is credited with being the first to plant seed oysters off of Blue Point, his childhood home. He sailed a sloop to the Chesapeake and brought back a load of seed. According to family lore, during the two years in which he waited for the oysters to grow to a marketable size, Avery patrolled his bed with a loaded musket. He labeled his harvest Bluepoints after his native town by the Islip\x{2013}Brookhaven line. The town, a traditional oystering center, was named by the oystermen who worked the beds on skiffs and claimed that the point was often seen through a blue haze.

The reasoning was that as Manhattan expanded north, anyone who owned an empty lot ready for development in the middle of the city could eventually sell it for a fortune. Wealthy leading Manhattan families also invested in the area. But while the wealthy were eager to invest, they did not want to live there. No one really did, because it was associated with dampness, filth, and disease. The engineers had dried out the land where the pond had been, but the earth remained moist and muddy and houses would shift and even tilt.

Typically an oyster barge was a two-story wooden vessel with a curved deck for drainage. On one end, oystermen would tie up their boots and unload, while on the other, pedestrians and wagons from the street would pull up to buy oysters.',

But his competitor opened 2,500 in <<two hours twenty-three minutes|14>> and thirty-nine and three-fourths seconds. Even this, at slightly faster than seventeen oysters a minute, did not come close to the oysters-per-minute record. In the late 1870s, Rhode Island and New York champions went down to Philadelphia to take on the champions from the South. Billy Lowney, who opened oysters in the Robert Pettis shop in Providence, led the North, defeating the Southern champion by opening 100 oysters in three minutes and three seconds, establishing a new world record for 100 oysters. Most people could not pick up and put down 100 oysters in that amount of time. That was 100 oysters without breaking any shells, because in competition only unbroken oysters were counted.',

The wholesale dealers of New York City pay their shuckers $1.00 for every thousand oysters opened. If we assume that this shucker could keep this record up for a working day of 10 hours, he would earn about $14.00, and if he worked six days a week, he would earn $84.00 per week, and the enormous salary of $336.00 per month. We do not wonder therefore that the New York oyster dealer thinks the cost of shucking is too high.',

But it was the all-night ferry to and from Brooklyn that would make the Fulton Street Market a late-night institution in nineteenth-century New York. Also, many New Yorkers lived within a short walk of the market. The immediate area was filled with decrepit wooden buildings ripe for slum clearance, yet another antique neighborhood neglected until it was so unlivable that the prevailing solution was to level it and put something else there. The city held an architectural contest for the new market\x{2019}s design, which was won by an Irish-born New York architect, James O\x{2019}Donnell, whose plan the city council immediately began revising. The city did not actually level the neighborhood for the new market until <<1821|9c:0>>. As always, it was claimed that few people actually lived there and it remains a mystery what happened to them after their neighborhood was torn down. There was some controversy about tearing it down, which was solved by a fortuitous accident. A mysterious fire in a sailors\x{2019} boardinghouse cleared most of the block.",
