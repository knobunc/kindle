            'At <<four|9m>> or <<five|20a>>, our friends would start to call us or we them. Evening plans were laid with the care of an invasion. If I told you I was going to the Middle East at ten to catch a rap revue, you met me there or missed me altogether. Plans with friends had weight and stakes in those pre-texting days because they were uncorrectable once the night got rolling.',

            "Driving was a major social easer for Dave Wallace. Normal conversational requirements\x{2014}listening while thinking, while watching face-and body-language, while processing these sometimes undermining messages (your voice says that you\x{2019}re interested, your face says that you\x{2019}re bored), while also wondering about one\x{2019}s own mixed messages of interest, boredom, politeness, contempt\x{2014}could be a burden. Talking was easier when driving because both parties, seated, safety-belted, were positioned to stare out at the same relaxing blankness of the highway. The highway, saving eye contact, made interaction bearable when Dave\x{2019}s nerves began to fray. His mood improved on drives at <<two AM|5>> with girlfriends to the beaches north of Boston or west to Walden Pond, an oasis in the suburbs now, where we would go swimming in the deep and spring-fed pond. Walden\x{2019}s water tastes the way a sidewalk smells just before it rains. The water is very hard and excellent for swimming, like velvet drawn across the skin. Dave would roll his tan corduroys up and wade like Alfred Prufrock and worry, just a little, about snapping turtles. But he was happy; you could hear it. He felt good.",

The theory puts staggering onus on Johnson\x{2019}s assassins, Samuels and Guild.

Guild and Samuels\x{2019}s options in Boston: the Army; or the minimum wage; or careers in muggings, burglaries, possessions with intent; stints at the Commonwealth\x{2019}s minimum-security facility on Deer Island in Boston Harbor, forestalled perhaps by informing on close friends; then the medium-security pen at Dedham; then, finally, when busted for a big enough felony or sentenced to life under Massachusetts\x{2019}s habitual offender statute, a long stay at the \x{2018}Hard Rock Caf\x{e9},\x{2019} maximum-security Walpole, from which they\x{2019}d emerge middle-aged, professional prisoners.

            "An episode initially aired on June 12, 1967, features Tony, the space-age American, idly wishing aloud that he could live in the Old West, when men were Men. Jeannie, eager, all-powerful, and literal-minded (a deadly sit-combo), sends him and us back to Gopher Gulch, an old Rawhide set terrorized by rustlers led by veteran B-movie cowboy crooner Hoyt Axton. A <<High Noon|13>> spoof ensues, with Tony in good-guy white shooting his own foot but refusing Jeannie\x{2019}s help: he must face Hoyt Axton alone. Tony finally \x{2018}wins\x{2019} their burlesque gunfight, and he and Jeannie return to Cocoa Beach with a minute or so left in the episode (like suburbanites back from vacation the night before a workday) and just enough script left to savor, with an interrupting Roger Healey, their ended adventure.",

The <<High Noon|13>> spoof certainly is a freaky premise for fantasy: Tony\x{2019}s unwanted peril follows from getting his wish; but it turns out that this peril, this wish-gone-awry, is what he had craved without knowing it. All in a fantasy Florida never to be confused with the actual Florida of Walter Cronkite, itself the scene of some distinctly unfunny race riots in Tampa, which began the night before Tony Nelson went back to the Old West and raged at their worst between <<8 PM|5>> and <<midnight|13>> Eastern Time, Monday, June 12, 1967, as the <<High Noon|13>> spoof aired.",
