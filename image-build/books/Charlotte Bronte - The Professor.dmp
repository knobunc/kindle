fourth, a curtain covers it, which I may hereafter withdraw, or
may not, as suits my convenience and capacity.  At any rate, for

syllables, however sweet or classic, can produce.  Belgium! I
repeat the word, now as I sit alone <<near midnight|13>>.  It stirs my

slept, are seen by me ascending from the clods\x{2014}haloed most of
them\x{2014}but while I gaze on their vapoury forms, and strive to
ascertain definitely their outline, the sound which wakened them

            "Next morning I awoke from prolonged and sound repose with the
impression that I was yet in X\x{2014}, and  perceiving it to be
broad daylight I started up, imagining that I had overslept
myself and should be behind time at the counting-house.  The
momentary and painful sense of restraint vanished before the
revived and reviving consciousness of freedom, as, throwing back
the white curtains of my bed, I looked forth into a wide, lofty
foreign chamber;  how different from the small and dingy, though
not uncomfortable, apartment I had occupied for a night or two at
a respectable inn in London while waiting for the sailing of the
packet!  Yet far be it from me to profane the memory of that
little dingy room!  It, too, is dear to my soul; for there, as I
lay in quiet and darkness, I first heard the great bell of St.
Paul's telling London it was <<midnight|13>>, and well do I recall the
deep, deliberate tones, so full charged with colossal phlegm and
force.  From the small, narrow window of that room, I first saw
THE dome, looming through a London mist.  I suppose the
sensations, stirred by those first sounds, first sights, are felt
but once; treasure them, Memory; seal them in urns, and keep them
in safe niches!  Well\x{2014}I rose.  Travellers talk of the apartments
in foreign dwellings being bare and uncomfortable; I thought my
chamber looked stately and cheerful.  It had such large windows
\x{2014}CROISEES that opened like doors, with such broad, clear panes
of glass; such a great looking-glass stood on my dressing-table
\x{2014}such a fine mirror glittered over the mantelpiece\x{2014}the painted
floor looked so clean and glossy; when I had dressed and was
descending the stairs, the broad marble steps almost awed me, and
so did the lofty hall into which they conducted.  On the first
landing I met a Flemish housemaid: she had wooden shoes, a short
red petticoat, a printed cotton bedgown, her face was broad, her
physiognomy eminently stupid; when I spoke to her in French, she
answered me in Flemish, with an air the reverse of civil; yet I
thought her charming; if she was not pretty or polite, she was, I
conceived, very picturesque; she reminded me of the female
figures in certain Dutch paintings I had seen in other years at
Seacombe Hall.",

Rue Royale.  Re-admitted to Mr. Brown's breakfast-room, I found
him, as before, seated at the table, and he was not alone\x{2014}a
gentleman stood by the hearth. Two words of introduction
designated him as my future master.  \"M. Pelet, Mr. Crimsworth;
Mr. Crimsworth, M. Pelet\" a bow on each side finished the
ceremony.  I don't know what sort of a bow I made; an ordinary
one, I suppose, for I was in a tranquil, commonplace frame of
mind; I felt none of the agitation which had troubled my first
interview with Edward Crimsworth.  M. Pelet's bow was extremely
polite, yet not theatrical, scarcely French; he and I were
presently seated opposite to each other.  In a pleasing voice,
low, and, out of consideration to my foreign ears, very distinct
and deliberate, M. Pelet intimated that he had just been
receiving from \"le respectable M. Brown,\" an account of my
attainments and character, which relieved him from all scruple as
to the propriety of engaging me as professor of English and Latin
in his establishment; nevertheless, for form's sake, he would put
a few questions to test; my powers.  He did, and expressed in
flattering terms his satisfaction at my answers.  The subject of
salary next came on; it was fixed at one thousand francs per
annum, besides board and lodging. \"And in addition,\" suggested M.
Pelet, \"as there will be some hours in each day during which
your services will not be required in my establishment, you may,
in time, obtain employment in other seminaries, and thus turn
your vacant moments to profitable account.\"",

            '"How do you like Belgium, Monsieur?"  asked she, in an accent of
the broadest Bruxellois.  I could now well distinguish the
difference between the fine and pure Parisian utterance of M.
Pelet, for instance, and the guttural enunciation of the
Flamands.  I answered politely, and then wondered how so coarse
and clumsy an old woman as the one before me should be at the
head of a ladies\' seminary, which I had always heard spoken of in
terms of high commendation.  In truth there was something to
wonder at.  Madame Reuter looked more like a joyous, free-living
old Flemish fermiere, or even a maitresse d\'auberge, than a
staid, grave, rigid directrice de pensionnat. In general the
continental, or at least the Belgian old women permit themselves
a licence of manners, speech, and aspect, such as our venerable
granddames would recoil from as absolutely disreputable, and
Madame Reuter\'s jolly face bore evidence that she was no
exception to the rule of her country; there was a twinkle and
leer in her left eye; her right she kept habitually half shut,
which I thought very odd indeed.  After several vain attempts to
comprehend the motives of these two droll old creatures for
inviting me to join them at their gouter, I at last fairly gave
it up, and resigning myself to inevitable mystification, I sat
and looked first at <<one|9c:1>>, then at the other, taking care meantime
to do justice to the confitures, cakes, and coffee, with which
they amply supplied me.  They, too, ate, and that with no
delicate appetite, and having demolished a large portion of the
solids, they proposed a "petit verre."  I declined.  Not so
Mesdames Pelet and Reuter; each mixed herself what I thought
rather a stiff tumbler of punch, and placing it on a stand near
the stove, they drew up their chairs to that convenience, and
invited me to do the same.  I obeyed; and being seated fairly
between them, I was thus addressed first by Madame Pelet, then by
Madame Reuter.',

            "\"She watches late,\" thought I, \"for it must be now <<near midnight|13>>.
She is a fascinating little woman,\" I continued in voiceless
soliloquy; \"her image forms a pleasant picture in memory; I know
she is not what the world calls pretty\x{2014}no matter, there is
harmony in her aspect, and I like it; her brown hair, her blue
eye, the freshness of her cheek, the whiteness of her neck, all
suit my taste.  Then I respect her talent; the idea of marrying a
doll or a fool was always abhorrent to me:  I know that a pretty
doll, a fair fool, might do well enough for the honeymoon; but
when passion cooled, how dreadful to find a lump of wax and wood
laid in my bosom, a half idiot clasped in my arms, and to
remember that I had made of this my equal\x{2014}nay, my idol\x{2014}to know
that I must pass the rest of my dreary life with a creature
incapable of understanding what I said, of appreciating what I
thought, or of sympathizing with what I felt!  \"Now, Zoraide
Reuter,\" thought I, \"has tact, CARACTERE, judgment, discretion;
has she heart?  What a good, simple little smile played about her
lips when she gave me the branch of lilacs!  I have thought her
crafty, dissembling, interested sometimes, it is true; but may
not much that looks like cunning and dissimulation in her conduct
be only the efforts made by a bland temper to traverse quietly
perplexing difficulties?  And as to interest, she wishes to make
her way in the world, no doubt, and who can blame her?  Even if
she be truly deficient in sound principle, is it not rather her
misfortune than her fault?  She has been brought up a Catholic:
had she been born an Englishwoman, and reared a Protestant, might
she not have added straight integrity to all her other
excellences?  Supposing she were to marry an English and
Protestant husband, would she not, rational, sensible as she is,
quickly acknowledge the superiority of right over expediency,
honesty over policy?  It would be worth a man's while to try the
experiment; to-morrow I will renew my observations.  She knows
that I watch her: how calm she is under scrutiny! it seems rather
to gratify than annoy her.\"  Here a strain of music stole in upon
my monologue, and suspended it; it was a bugle, very skilfully
played, in the neighbourhood of the park, I thought, or on the
Place Royale.  So sweet were the tones, so subduing their effect
at that hour, in the midst of silence and under the quiet reign
of moonlight, I ceased to think, that I might listen more
intently.  The strain retreated, its sound waxed fainter and was
soon gone; my ear prepared to repose on the absolute hush of
<<midnight|13>> once more.  No.  What murmur was that which, low, and
yet near and approaching nearer, frustrated the expectation of
total silence?  It was some one conversing\x{2014}yes, evidently, an
audible, though subdued voice spoke in the garden immediately
below me.  Another answered; the first voice was that of a man,
the second that of a woman; and a man and a woman I saw coming
slowly down the alley.  Their forms were at first in shade, I
could but discern a dusk outline of each, but a ray of moonlight
met them at the termination of the walk, when they were under my
very nose, and revealed very plainly, very unequivocally, Mdlle.

fagged with sleeplessness, to their ordinary tone\x{2014}for I had no
intention of getting up a scene with M. Pelet, reproaching him
with perfidy, sending him a challenge, or performing other
gambadoes of the sort\x{2014}I hit at last on the expedient of walking
out in the cool of the morning to a neighbouring establishment of
baths, and treating myself to a bracing plunge.  The remedy
produced the desired effect.  I came back at <<seven o'clock|6>>
steadied and invigorated, and was able to greet M. Pelet, when he
entered to breakfast, with an unchanged and tranquil countenance;
even a cordial offering of the hand and the flattering
appellation of \"mon fils,\" pronounced in that caressing tone with
which Monsieur had, of late days especially, been accustomed to
address me, did not elicit any external sign of the feeling
which, though subdued, still glowed at my heart.  Not that I
nursed vengeance\x{2014}no; but the sense of insult and treachery lived
in me like a kindling, though as yet smothered coal.  God knows I
am not by nature vindictive; I would not hurt a man because I can
no longer trust or like him; but neither my reason nor feelings
are of the vacillating order\x{2014}they are not of that sand-like sort
where impressions, if soon made, are as soon effaced.  Once
convinced that my friend's disposition is incompatible with my
own, once assured that he is indelibly stained with certain
defects obnoxious to my principles, and I dissolve the
connection.  I did so with Edward.  As to Pelet, the discovery
was yet new; should I act thus with him?  It was the question I
placed before my mind as I stirred my cup of coffee with a
half-pistolet (we never had spoons), Pelet meantime being seated
opposite, his pallid face looking as knowing and more haggard
than usual, his blue eye turned, now sternly on his boys and
ushers, and now graciously on me.",

she immediately began to slip her books into her cabas again;
and, presently, after I had returned to the estrade, while I was
arranging the mass of compositions, I heard the folding-door
again open and close; and, on looking up, I perceived her place
vacant. I thought to myself, "She will consider her first attempt
at taking a lesson in English something of a failure;" and I
wondered whether she had departed in the sulks, or whether
stupidity had induced her to take my words too literally, or,
finally, whether my irritable tone had wounded her feelings.  The
last notion I dismissed almost as soon as I had conceived it, for
not having seen any appearance of sensitiveness in any human face
since my arrival in Belgium, I had begun to regard it almost as a
fabulous quality. Whether her physiognomy announced it I could
not tell, for her speedy exit had allowed me no time to ascertain
the circumstance.  I had, indeed, on two or three previous
occasions, caught a passing view of her (as I believe has been
mentioned before); but I had never stopped to scrutinize either
her face or person, and had but the most vague idea of her
general appearance.  Just as I had finished rolling up the
compositions, the <<four o\'clock|6>> bell rang; with my accustomed

me that the "priere du midi" was not yet concluded.  I waited the
termination thereof; it would have been impious to intrude my
heretical presence during its progress.  How the repeater of the
prayer did cackle and splutter!  I never before or since heard
language enounced with such steam-engine haste.  "Notre Pere qui
etes au ciel" went off like a shot; then followed an address to
Marie "vierge celeste, reine des anges, maison d\'or, tour
d\'ivoire!"  and then an invocation to the saint of the day; and
then down they all sat, and the solemn (?) rite was over; and I
entered, flinging the door wide and striding in fast, as it was
my wont to do now; for I had found that in entering with aplomb,
and mounting the estrade with emphasis, consisted the grand
secret of ensuring immediate silence.  The folding-doors between
the two classes, opened for the prayer, were instantly closed; a
maitresse, work-box in hand, took her seat at her appropriate
desk; the pupils sat still with their pens and books before them;
my three beauties in the van, now well humbled by a demeanour of
consistent coolness, sat erect with their hands folded quietly on
their knees; they had given up giggling and whispering to each
other, and no longer ventured to utter pert speeches in my
presence; they now only talked to me occasionally with their
eyes, by means of which organs they could still, however, say
very audacious and coquettish things.  Had affection, goodness,
modesty, real talent, ever employed those bright orbs as
interpreters, I do not think I could have refrained from giving a
kind and encouraging, perhaps an ardent reply now and then; but

with the gaze of stoicism.  Youthful, fair, brilliant, as were

might have observed towards them.  If any doubt the accuracy of

maudit Anglais, Creemsvort.\" I had not yet retired; some German
books I had got hold of had kept me up late; I heard the uproar
below, and could distinguish the director's voice exalted in a
manner as appalling as it was unusual.  Opening my door a little,
I became aware of a demand on his part for \"Creemsvort\" to be
brought down to him that he might cut his throat on the
hall-table and wash his honour, which he affirmed to be in a
dirty condition, in infernal British blood.  \"He is either mad or
drunk,\" thought I, \"and in either case the old woman and the
servants will be the better of a man's assistance,\" so I
descended straight to the hall.  I found him staggering about,
his eyes in a fine frenzy rolling\x{2014}a pretty sight he was, a just
medium between the fool and the lunatic.",

Her mission was upstairs; I have followed her sometimes and
watched her.  First she opened the door of the dortoir (the
pupils' chamber), noiselessly she glided up the long room between
the two rows of white beds, surveyed all the sleepers; if any
were wakeful, especially if any were sad, spoke to them and
soothed them; stood some minutes to ascertain that all was safe
and tranquil; trimmed the watch-light which burned in the
apartment all night, then withdrew, closing the door behind her
without sound. Thence she glided to our own chamber; it had a
little cabinet within; this she sought; there, too, appeared a
bed, but one, and that a very small one; her face (the night I
followed and observed her) changed as she approached this tiny
couch; from grave it warmed to earnest; she shaded with one hand
the lamp she held in the other; she bent above the pillow and
hung over a child asleep; its slumber (that evening at least, and
usually, I believe) was sound and calm; no tear wet its dark
eyelashes; no fever heated its round cheek; no ill dream
discomposed its budding features.  Frances gazed, she did not
smile, and yet the deepest delight filled, flushed her face;
feeling pleasurable, powerful, worked in her whole frame, which
still was motionless.  I saw, indeed, her heart heave, her lips
were a little apart, her breathing grew somewhat hurried; the
child smiled; then at last the mother smiled too, and said in low
soliloquy, \"God bless my little son!\" She stooped closer over
him, breathed the softest of kisses on his brow, covered his
minute hand with hers, and at last started up and came away.  I
regained the parlour before her.  Entering it two minutes later
she said quietly as she put down her extinguished lamp\x{2014}",

he often walks home with us.  His wood is large, and some of the
timber is old and of huge growth. There are winding ways in it
which, pursued through glade and brake, make the walk back to
Daisy Lane a somewhat long one.  Many a time, when we have had
the benefit of a full moon, and when the night has been mild and
balmy, when, moreover, a certain nightingale has been singing,
and a certain stream, hid in alders, has lent the song a soft
accompaniment, the remote church-bell of the one hamlet in a
district of ten miles, has tolled <<midnight|13>> ere the lord of the

had had rather a sharp appetite, and had been waiting somewhat
impatiently to hear the signal of feeding time.  I forgot it now,

from my mind by the stir and tumult which the transaction of the
last half-hour had there excited.  I only thought of walking,
that the action of my muscles might harmonize with the action of
my nerves; and walk I did, fast and far.  How could I do
otherwise?  A load was lifted off my heart; I felt light and
liberated.  I had got away from Bigben Close without a breach of
resolution; without injury to my self-respect. I had not forced
circumstances; circumstances had freed me.  Life was again open
to me; no longer was its horizon limited by the high black wall
surrounding Crimsworth's mill.  Two hours had elapsed before my
sensations had so far subsided as to leave me calm enough to
remark for what wider and clearer boundaries I had exchanged that
sooty girdle.  When I did look up, lo! straight before me lay
Grovetown, a village of villas about five miles out of X\x{2014}. The
short winter day, as I perceived from the far-declined sun, was
already approaching its close; a chill frost-mist was rising from
the river on which X\x{2014} stands, and along whose banks the road I
had taken lay; it dimmed the earth, but did not obscure the clear
icy blue of the January sky.  There was a great stillness near
and far; the time of the day favoured tranquillity, as the people
were all employed within-doors, the hour of evening release from
the factories not being yet arrived; a sound of full-flowing
water alone pervaded the air, for the river was deep and
abundant, swelled by the melting of a late snow.  I stood awhile,
leaning over a wall; and looking down at the current:  I watched
the rapid rush of its waves. I desired memory to take a clear and
permanent impression of the scene, and treasure it for future
years.  Grovetown church clock struck <<four|11>>; looking up, I beheld
the last of that day's sun, glinting red through the leafless
boughs of some very old oak trees surrounding the church\x{2014}its
light coloured and characterized the picture as I wished.  I
paused yet a moment, till the sweet, slow sound of the bell had
quite died out of the air; then ear, eye and feeling satisfied, I
quitted the wall and once more turned my face towards X\x{2014}.",
