Gold is about as legal there as heroin is here, and vice versa. I\x{2019}m getting about two hundred pounds on the black market for a brick weighing sixteen Troy ounces, worth about three thousand, <<three five|9j>>, dollars here. A pound goes a lot further than a dollar, it\x{2019}s like, about two hundred bucks. So three and a half thousand here buys me the equivalent of forty thousand over there. Real estate prices are low, too. The place I need to buy on the far side is huge, but it should go for about a thousand pounds, call it equivalent to two hundred grand here. In our own Boston it\x{2019}d be going for upwards of a million, easily. But gold is worth so much that I can pay for it with five bars of the stuff\x{2014}about eighteen thousand dollars on this side. I\x{2019}ve found an, uh, black-market outlet who seems reasonably trustworthy at handling the gold\x{2014}he\x{2019}s got his angles, but I know what they are.
