            "The first three recipes are from Hasegawa Shigeki, and they all start with the same stock, a soup that is the base for many of his dishes. A small amount is also used in the spinach and sesame dish and the sea bream, which are not Shigeki\x{2019}s recipes. The stock, called dashi, can be bought commercially bottled, but when basing an entire dinner on it, it is worth making yourself. The base is kombu, dried kelp, which can be found in Asian stores, health-food stores, or online. Kombu was traditionally associated with the cuisine of Osaka, but it is considered a great source of umami, which has been a growing obsession in modern Japanese cooking. Up until <<1908|18:0>> the Japanese, like many Westerners, thought of four basic tastes, the tastes of the tongue\x{2014}salt, bitter, sweet, and sour. But in 1908, Kikunae Ikeda, a chemist, discovered that there was a certain flavor produced by glutamates for which there are receptors on the tongue just as there are for the other four basic tastes. This is why the Chinese season their food with monosodium glutamate. Although controversial in the US, this fermented cereal has long been made by the Chinese because they find that it adds \x{201c}flavorfulness,\x{201d} a loose translation of Kikunae Ikeda\x{2019}s word, umami. Seaweed, but also tomatoes and meat and other foods that are high in glutamates, have this flavor. The Japanese prefer to introduce umami more naturally by using foods high in glutamates\x{2014}in Shigeki\x{2019}s case, with a seaweed stock.",

            "There is an alley of sushi restaurants at the market, each the size of a railroad car, with one long counter and little space to pass behind the customers seated at the stools. If you get there before the market opens to the public at <<nine a.m.|5>>, you can avoid long lines. The sushi are placed in front of you on a long green haran leaf faster than you can eat them. You can have five kinds of tuna sushi with different degrees of fattiness, a huge pile of uni (sea urchin), steamed freshwater eel\x{2014}unlike the roasted eel you find elsewhere\x{2014}and a bulbous pile of something soft and white and rich tasting. I asked what the last was and the translated response came back as \x{201c}testosterone of cod.\x{201d} My guess is that it is the organ that produces the sperm, but as I said, one of the secrets of enjoying Japanese food is not to ask too many questions.",

Spain continued to bring Africans until <<1860|9c:0>> and did not abolish slavery until 1886. I have met Cubans who knew their African-born grandparents.",

            'The Sinai Peninsula is the only land connection between Africa and Asia, and because of this strategic position, like the rest of Egypt, it has known many outside rulers. After the days of the pharaohs, the Greeks and Romans ruled Egypt for about nine centuries, then it was the Arabs for another nine centuries, the Turks for three centuries, the French ruled for three years, and the British took it in 1882 and controlled it until <<1953|18:0>> when Egypt regained independence. So there are many influences on Egyptian food and culture. This became clear to me as I crossed the barren, rocky Egyptian Sinai Desert on a camel led by a Bedouin tribesman who was obsessed with the cassettes he played of Jamaican reggae music. My camel was named Bob Marley.',

Sylvia periodically goes back to visit friends, and <<after one|9w>> visit she told me that all her friends in Budapest were on a health kick.
