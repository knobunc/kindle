Eight hours after the accident, as the hands of the clock were just slipping <<past two a.m.|9h>>, Riordan finally ambled into the police station where the bodies lay. An assistant was holding him upright, officers reported, and he was a big enough man that his weight pulled both of them sideways. Riordan looked down at the dead men. When told their names\x{2014}Joseph Collins, 52, Gottlieb Minnick, 27\x{2014}he snapped, slurring the words but saying clearly enough: \x{201c}It\x{2019}s a shame that two such names should pull us out on a night like this.\x{201d} All this according to the notes of journalists covering the accident, who helped trigger a formal investigation of Riordan\x{2019}s work.",

            "BORN IN 1883, the son of a Hungarian immigrant who had left the country for better opportunities, Gettler learned early to love the magic of chemistry. By the time he graduated from high school, he was hooked by the puzzle of fitting one molecule to another, by the kaleidoscope of colors that glowed in a test tube. His family had no money to send him to college, so he paid for it himself. While working as a ticket agent on the 39th Street Brooklyn-to-Battery ferry, he earned a science degree from the College of the City of New York. To earn his master\x{2019}s at Columbia University, he arranged to work the <<midnight|13>>-to-eight ferry shift. That way he could do homework during the ferry\x{2019}s quiet night hours and attend classes during the day.",

            'COCKTAIL PARTIES sparkled defiantly through the last chime of the day, to the dreaded first minute of January 20, 1920. With morning would come the official start of Prohibition, so the revelers danced through the night in black-draped rooms featuring open coffins to collect empty bottles. In Times Square, crowds gathered to mourn the stroke of <<midnight|12>>. The dancers and the mourners were shiny in party clothes, somber in mock funeral wear, dressed up with black top hats and smoke-fine veils, just as drunk as they could be. Some stayed into the morning, crowding along Broadway with their whiskey-fed protests. Others slipped away to continue the festivities in private.',

When Gettler gave a dog 50 milligrams of cyanide (a little less than 2 drops), the animal died in 21 minutes. When he cut the dose to 20 milligrams, the dog lived for <<2 hours and 35 minutes|14>>. When inhaled, less of the poison was needed to kill, and it worked more quickly, but again not instantly. One gassed dog, for instance, breathed in about 10 milligrams of cyanide; he was dead in 15 minutes.',
