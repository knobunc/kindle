Queerly, then, it seemed to her that she shouldn\'t have left the bed. If death were to come tomorrow anyway, why delay it? But she knew the answer in the surging will to live that swept her; and in the thought, for the second time, that this <<midnight|13>> visitor was proof that someone who wanted her dead feared there would be no execution.',

It was nearly dark now, but he could see the top of a neighboring building that almost touched the roof he was on. A leap of two yards at most, an easy jump. With a loud clang! the clock in a near-by tower began to intone the hour. One--two--<<five--ten|5k:1>>! And on the stroke, a low, grinding noise struck Jommy\'s ears, and suddenly, in the shadowy center of that expanse of roof opposite him yawned a wide, black hole. Startled, he flung himself flat, holding his breath.',
