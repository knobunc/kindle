            'REDUCTIONS IN THE STAFF

The first member of the staff of Cosy Moments to arrive at the
office on the following morning was Master Maloney. This sounds
like the beginning of a "Plod and Punctuality," or "How Great
Fortunes have been Made" story; but, as a matter of fact, Master
Maloney was no early bird. Larks who rose in his neighbourhood,
rose alone. He did not get up with them. He was supposed to be at
the office at <<nine o\'clock|6>>. It was a point of honour with him, a
sort of daily declaration of independence, never to put in an
appearance before <<nine-thirty|9c:1>>. On this particular morning he was
punctual to the minute, or half an hour late, whichever way you
choose to look at it.',

            '"Yes. The house where I live was raided late last night. It seems
that some gamblers have been running a pool-room on the ground
floor. Why the cops should have thought I had anything to do with
it, when I was sleeping peacefully upstairs, is more than I can
understand. Anyway, at <<about three in the morning|9h>> there was the
dickens of a banging at my door. I got up to see what was doing,
and found a couple of Policemen there. They told me to come along
with them to the station. I asked what on earth for. I might have
known it was no use arguing with a New York cop. They said they had
been tipped off that there was a pool-room being run in the house,
and that they were cleaning up the house, and if I wanted to say
anything I\'d better say it to the magistrate. I said, all right,
I\'d put on some clothes and come with them. They said they couldn\'t
wait about while I put on clothes. I said I wasn\'t going to travel
about New York in pyjamas, and started to get into my shirt. One of
them gave me a shove in the ribs with his night-stick, and told me
to come along quick. And that made me so mad I hit out." A chuckle
escaped Billy. "He wasn\'t expecting it, and I got him fair. He went
down over the bookcase. The other cop took a swipe at me with his
club, but by that time I was so mad I\'d have taken on Jim Jeffries,
if he had shown up and got in my way. I just sailed in, and was
beginning to make the man think that he had stumbled on Stanley
Ketchel or Kid Brady or a dynamite explosion by mistake, when the
other fellow loosed himself from the bookcase, and they started in
on me together, and there was a general rough house, in the middle
of which somebody seemed to let off about fifty thousand dollars\'
worth of fireworks all in a bunch; and I didn\'t remember anything
more till I found myself in a cell, pretty nearly knocked to
pieces. That\'s my little life-history. I guess I was a fool to cut
loose that way, but I was so mad I didn\'t stop to think."',

After parting with you last night, I went meditatively back to my
Fourth Avenue address, and, with a courtly good night to the large
policeman who, as I have mentioned in previous conversations, is
stationed almost at my very door, I passed on into my room, and had
soon sunk into a dreamless slumber. At <<about three o\'clock in the

Mr. Jarvis was as good as his word. On the following morning, at
<<ten o\'clock|6>> to the minute, he made his appearance at the office of
Cosy Moments, his fore-lock more than usually well oiled in honour
of the occasion, and his right coat-pocket bulging in a manner that
betrayed to the initiated eye the presence of the faithful
"canister." With him, in addition to his revolver, he brought a
long, thin young man who wore under his brown tweed coat a
blue-and-red striped jersey. Whether he brought him as an ally in
case of need or merely as a kindred soul with whom he might commune
during his vigil, was not ascertained.',
