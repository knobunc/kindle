I\x{2019}ve been hearing about you all along the Arctic seaboard, about how you had your skull pierced, about how your subject of study seems to vary between digging on the ocean bed and gazing at the northern lights, about how you suddenly appeared, like as it might be out of nowhere, <<about ten|9:0>>, twelve years ago, and that\x{2019}s all mighty interesting. But something\x{2019}s drawn me here, Dr. Grumman, beyond simple curiosity. I\x{2019}m concerned about the child. I think she\x{2019}s important, and so do the witches.
