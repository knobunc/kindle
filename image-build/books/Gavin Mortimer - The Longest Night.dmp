            "\x{201c}An engaging, down-to-the-minute retelling of May <<10-11|5a:1>>, 1941 . . . Part military history, part chronicle of survivors\x{2019} memories, and part moving tribute to London, the result is reminiscent of Richard Collier\x{2019}s The City That Would Not Die, but is a captivating and important contribution in its own right. True to his journalistic roots, Mortimer opens by introducing a large cast of characters, most of whom he personally interviewed. The experiences of those who were in and around London that fateful night drive the narrative. . . . Mortimer offers great insight into the intricacies of World War II London, its population, physical layout, architecture, and history, as well as the complexities of German and British warplanes and weaponry of the period.",

            "Three days later Hitler fulfilled his promise. Three hundred and fifty German bombers, escorted by <<600|3:0>> fighters, blotted out the warm September sun as they came up the Thames estuary. They were two miles high and the head of the force stretched twenty miles wide. At <<5 p.m.|5>> the bombs began to fall. On Woolwich Arsenal, the country\x{2019}s largest munitions factory, and then on the docks that proliferated along  the banks of the Thames. But this was a day not just for military and industrial targets, this was a special day. Saturday, September 7, 1940, was the day Hitler had chosen to launch his attack on the British people. This was the beginning of the Blitz. Bombs spewed out of aircraft and fell with murderous intensity on London\x{2019}s East End. People in the boroughs of East Ham and West Ham, in Stepney and Poplar and in Whitechapel, died easily in the later summer sunshine. There were 430 dead as night edged in, and elsewhere across London people watched with bemusement: Why, they asked each other, was the sun setting in the east as well as the west? The fires guided in the second wave of German bombers at <<8 p.m.|5>> When dawn broke on Sunday, September 8, 400 more were dead.",

After weeks of heroic resistance the RAF was on its knees. On September 4, the day Hitler addressed the rally of nurses and social workers in Berlin, the RAF lost <<nearly 300|18:0>> aircraft and 100 of its pilots. Factories couldn\x{2019}t produce enough new planes and the replacement pilots were horribly raw. If the onslaught continued for another week, the Battle of Britain would go Germany\x{2019}s  way.

            "THERE was another heavy raid on January 11, then a little era of peace. On March 8, 125 aircraft attacked London, and 94 aircraft decorated the city with their bombs on the following day. They were back on March 15 and 19. A lull for a month, giving time for the daffodils to appear and the cheering smell of spring to lift the city\x{2019}s spirits. Then on April 16 the largest force yet seen\x{2014}685 bombers\x{2014}laid waste to  London in what came to be remembered as \x{201c}the Wednesday\x{201d} raid. One thousand were killed. Worse was to come three days later, \x{201c}the Saturday,\x{201d} when 712 planes mounted a reprisal raid for an RAF attack on Berlin. The number of dead exceeded Wednesday\x{2019}s tally by <<200|3:0>>. Never had number crunching been so grim. The 1,200 added to the existing total brought London\x{2019}s fatalities since September to more than 16,000, with another 23,000 seriously wounded. Not a patch on the original prewar forecasts of the Air Staff but severe enough to shake the capital\x{2019}s morale. Continual bombing, day after day, night after night, had been easier to deal with psychologically. People knew what to expect, and when to expect it. The first fifty-seven uninterrupted days of bombing had come nowhere near weakening people\x{2019}s resolve. \x{201c}We can take it,\x{201d} they boasted. But the raids of March and April had been different: they\x{2019}d been heavier, far heavier than anything in 1940, and the \x{201c}Blitz nerves\x{201d} of many were fraying. It was the suspense that excoriated them. Will they come tonight? Maybe tomorrow? Perhaps next week? They didn\x{2019}t know. All they knew was they would come again, and when they did it would be in force.",

Nevertheless, Hitler was incensed. Such effrontery must not go unpunished. The twenty or so guests who gathered at his Bavarian chalet retreat 8,000 feet above the town of Berchtesgaden on Friday, May 9, were there to hear him hold sway on a range of issues. As they stood in the gold-leafed elevator that took them from the car park into the chalet they suspected the raids would be mentioned. It was an esteemed coterie that were led into the great room, among them Martin Bormann, the Nazi Party chairman; Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, commander of the German armed forces; and Hans Baur, Hitler\x{2019}s personal pilot.",

Some of the Portland stone walls had been defaced by shrapnel, too, but an army of firewatchers now swarmed over the 23,000 square feet of Mansion House dousing incendiaries with their stirrup pumps.",

Sewage culverts were deepest and needed new bricks laid. Then came the electricity cables and the hydraulic power mains. The gas mains were sunk lower than the hydraulics but because they were made of heavy iron they waited until everything else was secure. The penultimate  operation was performed by the Water Board, mending the main and sterilizing it. Then the road was tarmacked and traffic could begin to flow again. The whole process required patience. In Fleet Street the gas didn\x{2019}t return until Monday evening and it wasn\x{2019}t possible to make outgoing phone calls until Wednesday. Traffic wasn\x{2019}t able to pass along until Friday, May 16, and Ludgate Hill was barred to traffic for a further two weeks. Worse affected was the Temple, just a few hundred yards south. The water was reconnected by lunchtime on Sunday; the electricity was back on eight days later. But they remained without gas for five weeks.",

            "The bones of many buildings continued to be carted away as London put itself back together. Around the Elephant and Castle the clean-up operation seemed never-ending, so demolition workers worked late, picking up overtime. On Saturday, June 6, a row of ruined houses on Gurney Street off the New Kent Road, toppled on May 10 by a stick of HEs, was cleared. The men packed up in the early evening and went off for a pint. The local children moved in, playing cowboys and Indians in the street. <<Just after 9 p.m.|10>> Emily Macfarlane and her mum left their flat in the Peabody Estate to go have a drink in the Elephant and Castle pub. It was still daylight. As they walked down Gurney Street Emily\x{2019}s mum changed her mind. She didn\x{2019}t fancy the Elephant tonight. Why not the Doctor\x{2019}s Pub in Walworth Road? They turned round and set off back down Gurney Street. Two minutes later a terrible explosion rocked the ground under their feet. Emily recognized what it was immediately, by the noise and by the way the pressure of the blast tried to squeeze her lungs out of her body. There was silence for a few seconds, then bricks began to rain down, thudding off the dead and dying and dropping into a crater thirty-five feet wide and seven feet deep.",
