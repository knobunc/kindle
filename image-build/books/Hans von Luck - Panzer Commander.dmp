            "Back at my command post I made contact with Feuchtinger. I described the situation as it appeared to me at <<about midday|13>> on 18 July, and ended, \x{201c}General, I believe that the whole British attack has come to a standstill, thanks to the engagement of all elements of my combat group, and thanks not least to a Luftwaffe 8.8cm battery that I found by chance at Cagny and put to use in the ground fighting. I see a great danger, however, on my right wing. If the British were to move up their infantry things would look pretty bad for my rather thin defensive front. For the moment it's all right still, but reserves ought to arrive in the course of the afternoon.\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}The Ist SS will arrive today in the late afternoon, the 12th SS not <<before midday|13>> tomorrow. We must hold till then.\x{201d} In the late afternoon Feuchtinger came through again, \x{201c}The first elements of the Ist SS have arrived. Together with them we have knocked out a lot of tanks. With, your tally the British have probably lost at least 200 tanks. I am reassured that you can hold out on the right flank. Convey my appreciation to Kurz commander of II Battalion).\x{201d} In the afternoon I finally changed and at once felt better. The Tiger battalion sent word that about ten Tigers were again operational, and that they would be mounting an attack on the enemy's left flank.",

            'From division and from Becker\'s two batteries now operating alone on my left flank we heard that the Ilth Armored Division, with grenadiers and supported by tanks and heavy artillery, had mounted an attack <<about four o\'clock|6>> against two villages on the northern edge of the Bourgebus hills, which were defended by elements of the Ist P anzer Division.',

            "Finally, <<about five o'clock|6>>, the first elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division arrived. A general-staff officer made contact with me, \x{201c}The division has been through a costly march. We were shot up time and again by British fighters and forced into cover. The bulk of the division will be here in the course of the night. How do things look with you?\x{201d} I put him in the picture and learned that my combat group was to be relieved by this division. Shortly after came the order from my own division: \x{201c}in the course of the night von Luck's combat group will disengage from the enemy and hand over to the 12th SS Division. You will take up a defensive position on either side of Troarn on the east bank of the flooded Dives. Rauch's combat group will also be relieved and stationed east of the Dives.\x{201d} The relief went through without difficulty. I hoped to be able to give the thoroughly overtired and battle-weary men a little rest. By \x{201c}Operation Goodwood,\x{201d} 18/19 July 1944 201 the late evening of 19 July it was possible to, see what the British had managed or failed to do: The little bridgehead had been extended by about 9 kilometers; Caen had now been fully occupied. But the breakthrough in the direction of Falaise had not been made.",
