            'Cutbacks in the news divisions of the Big Three television networks were common as their competition with each other was expanded to include a struggle for audience with hundreds of cable and online offerings. In November 1980, the year CNN launched, 75 percent of television sets in use were tuned to one of the three nightly network newscasts during the dinner hour. By <<2003|9n:1>>, the figure had dropped to 40 percent. In 1980, 52.1 million Americans watched one of the three evening news programs. In the first quarter of 2017, that figure was 25.0 million. Network television news remains important. The Big Three still have excellent reporters, and, even with much smaller audiences, their evening news programs still draw far larger viewership than any of the cable news shows. But they have lost the dominance they once enjoyed.14',
