Both of her parents were school teachers, a profession, Emily held, that called to it only the most boring people. Her parents\x{2019} one binding commonality was the way they approached raising their kids. Above all else, they wanted to foster their children\x{2019}s intellect, encourage them to be bold thinkers, to be analytical, critical, and, failing that, to at least become knowledgeable, cultivated, conversant. The manner in which they approached this was insisting that their children never be given chores or household duties: no cooking, cleaning, caring for younger siblings; so long as they were seen to be reading, studying, perfecting some sort of skill or art, they were exempt from everything they thought of as toilsome or menial. An approach that had Emily\x{2019}s parents, particularly her mother, working several times the amount of the average person, as well as rendering Emily utterly useless in the kitchen later on in her life, inept at controlling textile-incinerating irons, and the owner of underwear that was all <<three to six|10a:0>> shades away from its original colour.

And, let\x{2019}s see, what else: she\x{2019}d have a garden, a nice one, something bigger than the meagre backyard plot they had now, big enough that she could invite people over for the Feast of Dormition in August, with a firepit where Yannis could set up a spit and knock down the cinders, stirring the coals until they were the perfect temperature to roast a lamb. And if not a garden, then maybe a holiday, back in Greece. They could visit her parents, spend Easter there, in the way that Easter should be spent: go to the vigil in church on Pascha Saturday, watch the lighting of the Holy Fire at <<midnight|13>>. That\x{2019}s what she would do.

However, as good as things were going for him, the scene had its drawbacks. Crack was everywhere, and everyone was smoking it, a constant burnt-candy smell wafting between the walls and blocks of the housing complex, puffs of sweet-plastic smoke rising from corners where kids were crouching in the dark, glass pipes hovering close to their lips, having just bought a \x{201c}<<twenty|9k:0>>\x{201d} from him. Twenty bucks for a half-gram enveloped in Saran Wrap, ripped away and lit up every few minutes to maintain the effect, which would, at most, last a half-hour, only to find them strung out, open-mouthed, and frantically looking for more.

Bruno was curled up on the chesterfield beside her, the tip of his tail drooping over his nose. It was a deep sleep, his tabby eyes sealed tight, his purring having stopped long ago, even if Melissa\x{2019}s hand was still on his back. Melissa Johnson was focused on the book in her other hand, her thumb pressed into its crease, prying it open. When she\x{2019}d finished the page she was reading, she grinned, removed her hand from the cat, and dog-eared the page\x{2019}s corner. Despite this movement, Bruno slept on. And would have continued to had Melissa not glanced into her empty teacup and calculated that there was enough time for another before work. Unfortunately for Bruno, the sofa was the antithesis of firm, the weakened springs creaking and sponging low when weighted, as well as springing widely back as she stood up, jostling him. The cat woke to give her a narrow-eyed glare as she disappeared into the kitchen, then tucked his face under his paw and let out a world-weary sigh. Outside in the boreal distance, a chainsaw puttered out. A crow complained in the quiet that was left behind. In the bay window in front of the sofa, a myriad of individual clouds\x{2014}the kind that are only seen in autumn, small and shaped like blotchy snails with grey-bottomed bodies and white-furrowed shells\x{2014}glided through the sky, all of them moving in the same direction, from one nameless place, to another.",

The phone was red. And what William hated most about it, besides the fact that it was inconveniently mounted on a wall in a tight corner (and at a strange angle), was that when it rang it was so gratingly loud that you could actually see the cherry receiver quavering as you picked it up. He shook his head in the relieving silence, put it to his ear. \x{201c}Yes?\x{201d} Then he leaned over the tiny and strangely angled desk to write on a pad of paper there, pen out of his jacket pocket, clicked and already jotting down the information, a glance at his watch, time and date scrawled onto the top left-hand corner. \x{201c}Mm-hmm, all right. And how long ago did the call come in? Mm-hmm. Okay. So you\x{2019}re more or less ten minutes away then, is that about right, John? All right. We\x{2019}ll be ready for you.
