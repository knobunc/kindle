circumnavigated two of Africa\'s three great lakes for the first time, 
and had solved the mystery of the central African watershed by separating the Congo\'s source from the Nile\'s - not one word of which was 
mentioned in his letter - I found it immensely poignant that Stanley, 
the illegitimate workhouse boy, had still needed to attach his name to 
Livingstone\'s in order to make himself seem worthy of assistance. It 
reminded me of just how far he had come from a childhood world of 
parental rejection and poverty, and how, if he had not emigrated to 
America aged eighteen, he would never (in class-stratified Britain) 
have been taken on by one of the world\'s great newspapers, and so

store and do business there? It seems very unlikely. There was only one 
Henry Stanley in the cotton trade in New Orleans at this date: Henry 
Hope Stanley, who had the controlling interest in the largest company 
in town compressing and baling raw cotton mechanically, and who 
was also the lessee of six shipping wharves with offices in Exchange 
Place. For two reasons this made him a most improbable candidate for 
having a desk in a grocer\'s store. In the first place, his extraordinarily

real entrepreneur like Mr Stanley. In reality, James Speake had been

            "So how was it ever supposed that Stanley once lived in Orange 
Street, New Orleans, with his `father' - something stated as fact in the 
most recent biography with any pretensions to being definitive? The 
idea derives from an anonymous article in the principal New Orleans 
newspaper, the Daily Picayune (z8 December 118go), in which it was 
stated that Rowlands passed `many days in play in hall and balcony 
and in the square', and that `men who were children of the neighbourhood then, remembered him ...'. The author also stated that 
Rowlands and the Stanleys' adopted daughter, Annie, had played 
together as children at <<904|9c:0>>, Orange Street. This was repeated in an 
influential article in the Roosevelt Review in June 11944, and thereafter 
crept into most subsequent biographies.z'9 But this must be wrong, since there is documentary census evidence to show that Rowlands 
could only have lived in Orange Street for six weeks in i 86o, when he 
was nineteen years old - hardly the right age to be playing with 'children of the neighbourhood'.3\x{b0} Strangely, no author, or journalist, 
would remark, until the 1940s upon the very puzzling differences 
between the Henry Hope Stanley of the Daily Picayune and the Henry 
Stanley of the Autobiography. 3z  Even when, in 19go, John Bierman 
expressed his scepticism about the extent and intensity of the relationship between Rowlands and Henry Hope Stanley, he did not question 
that there had been a genuine link between the two. I can only assume 
that this link has not been challenged until now because it seemed 
impossibly audacious for Rowlands to have appropriated another 
man's name and claimed a close relationship, not simply without his 
knowledge or consent, but without ever having known him.",

the great lakes was not suspected, and the position of the sources of 
the Nile and Congo were matters only for fruitless conjecture. Then, 
between 11853 and 11856, Livingstone, in a majestic journey, crossed 
Africa along the line of the Zambezi. He suffered twenty-seven attacks 
of malaria and almost died at the half-way stage. Two years later, 
Richard Burton and John Speke reached Lake Tanganyika, and that 
same year Speke gained his first sight of an immense lake, which with 
typical Victorian cultural arrogance he called Lake Victoria. He 
returned in <<118|1a>>6z and found the vast lake\'s narrow northern outflow, 
which he would claim as the source of the Nile. In 11864 Samuel Baker 
reached a large lake north-west of Speke\'s Victoria Nyanza, the Luta 
Nzige, which he renamed Lake Albert. But none of these men had 
proved whether these nyanzas were single bodies of water, or groups 
of lakes. Nor did anyone know whether Lake Tanganyika - lying to 
the south-west of Lake Albert - fed it by a connecting river. If it did, 
Tanganyika (being so far to the south) would be the primary source of 
the Nile, rather than Speke\'s Victoria. This link was something Stanley

Ganda escort at Alice Island, he headed south-west for a large island 
called Bumbireh, which he had heard was twenty-five miles away. `With 
every prospect of starvation\' facing him and his men, Henry knew how 
vital it would be to win over these islanders.21 Happily, the wind was 
now blowing from the north-east so he and his men could rely on their sail for much of their journey, though `rain, thunder, lightning and a 
sounding surf on all sides\' meant they spent many hours baling to stay 
afloat. They passed a wet and exhausting night under the lee of a small 
uninhabited island, before sailing on to Bumbireh itself, arriving at 
<<about 9 a.m.|5>> on z8 April. `As we entered the cove we saw the plateau\'s 
summit lined with men, and heard shouts like war cries, yet imminent 
starvation compelled us to ground our boat and endeavour to entice the 
people to part with some food for us for cloth or beads.\'',

eloquently of what he had endured emotionally and physically. After 
his great trans-Africa journey, the secret ties to his mother and half-sister, which had once been so sustaining, had started to fray and sunder.

Susi, Uledi and the rest - with whom he felt at ease, as he never did with

her about `the cesspool of slander & calumny\' surrounding the House

and May 11892-, by which he made it illegal for natives to hunt elephants or harvest wild rubber, unless they handed over these commodities to the State\'s officers for a small fixed sum per kilo.\' Nor was 
Stanley informed of the decree of 3 o October 1189 z, by which `vacant\' lands (that is, those not lived on or farmed by Africans) were to be 
divided into three zones, one of which, the Domaine Prive, was a vast 
territory that included the valleys of the Aruwimi and the Uele - all of 
which would be reserved entirely for the State.\' In <<118|1a>>9z, although the 
Dunlop Tyre Company was by now trading in Europe and America, 
rubber sales were still only achieving one-thirtieth of the tonnage 
recorded at the century\'s end, so it was not yet apparent that rubber 
would save the finances of the Congo Free State. Apart from the king\'s 
debts, there was another reason why Henry did not speak in public 
against Leopold\'s new policies. By the time he heard about `vacant 
lands\' late in 118gz, the king\'s force publique had attacked the ArabSwahili in the east of Leopold\'s vast country and the war Stanley had 
been urging for years had started.',

Glave\'s diary was published in Century Magazine. Here, at last, was a 
source that Stanley accepted as gospel truth. In the first diary extract, 
Glave stated that in 1895 the State had been using Baluba and 
Manyema soldiers, without white officers, against local tribes on the 
Upper Congo around Kabambare, Kasongo and Nyangwe. In consequence there had been many massacres of innocent people. The 
released slaves of the Arab-Swahili, not long after returning as free 
men to their villages, had been `shipped south to be soldiers, workers, 
&c., on the State stations\'; `what were peaceful families have been 
broken up\'. Glave had seen `in stations in charge of white men ... 
strings of poor emaciated old women, some of them mere skeletons, 
working from <<six in the morning|5>> till <<noon|13>>, and from <<half-past two|10>> till 
<<six|9f>>...\'. These innocent `prisoners of war\' had been brought in by black 
government soldiers to be forced labourers.14 Five months later, far 
worse revelations from Glave\'s diaries would be published, with graphic descriptions of hangings and floggings. `I conscientiously

Dolly had come to love Denzil and found him `indescribably charming

February 11904, Stanley could walk slowly, dragging his left leg, with a 
stick in his right hand. Dorothy summoned a photographer to take 
pictures of him, and with a shaky hand he signed a few for friends. He

proving that it was a single body of water and not several, which made 
Speke's northern outlet almost certain to be the primary source of the 
Nile. His circumnavigation of Lake Tanganyika established that the 
only outflow from the lake flowed into the Lualaba to the west. By 
making regular observations for latitude and longitude at <<noon|13>> on 
clear days, using a sextant and a chronometer, he made the first reliable maps of the two largest northern lakes, and the river system of the 
central African watershed. He also mapped the course of the Congo, 
joining a series of dots that recorded each of the positions obtained by 
his regular <<midday|13>> observations. He took boiling-point readings to 
establish heights above sea level and used a theodolite to estimate the 
height of distant hills. By following the Lualaba north and then west, 
he proved that it had no connection with the Nile, or the Niger, and 
was therefore the Congo, and he mapped its entire course to the 
Atlantic from Nyangwe. Despite his problems with hostile tribes, with 
rapids, and with lack of food, he managed to take nineteen observations between 4 February and z March 11877, during which time he 
delineated the entire top of the river's majestic hoop-like curve. His

newspaper story to have found a wise and pious old man in the heart 
of Africa than to have rescued one obsessed with past insults and 
injuries. Through what he wrote about him, Stanley made the public 
forget about the deaths and disasters of the Zambezi Expedition, and 
enabled them to acclaim a British saint. Yet having made the man an 
icon of goodness, he would never escape from being adversely compared with the mythic figure he had created. `Well may he call his lecture "Through the Dark Continent",\' wrote the editor of The 
Anti-Slavery Reporter in November 1878. `It will be dark for him. He 
will stand in everlasting contrast to Livingstone, and act as a dark

iz Even if Noe\'s claim - that S had been obsessed with finding Livingstone since 
11866 - is ignored, it still seems implausible that Gordon Bennett dreamed up 
the Livingstone story, given his remarks to S in Dec 1867 about Americans not 
being interested in Africa. I believe S told Anderson about his desire to `find\' 
Livingstone in Jan 1867, or in London exactly a year later, before leaving for 
Abyssinia. (SD 4.011.11868). Otherwise, knowing all Bennett\'s prejudices, 
Anderson would hardly have picked an expensive African story solely on the 
unsupported evidence of a single letter in The Times. There are other reasons 
for ruling out Bennett as the originator of the Livingstone search. John Hotten, the London publisher, whose life of Stanley was published in 1872, and 
who interviewed Stanley\'s relations in that year, was sure that S had had the 
Livingstone idea. What Hotten wrote on the subject has not been quoted by 
previous biographers: `Among other articles left by Mr Stanley with his 
mother ... was a kind of pocket cash-book ... [now missing TJ]\' which, said 
Hotten, pre-dated S\'s commission to find Livingstone, and contained a page of 
calculations of `Expenses re Livingstone Expedition\'. Hotten also mentioned 
`a friend who carried on a correspondence with Mr Stanley for several years, 
who states that he [Stanley] "often said it was the height of his ambition to 
find Dr Livingstone"\' (Hotten 115o-i). Gordon Bennett\'s biographer 
attributes the originating role to Colonel Anderson, offering no facts to support the assertion (Seitz 303). All the actual evidence suggests that credit for 
the famous journalistic event should be S\'s alone.',

            '13 Identification of treaty makers: Strauch to Valcke 1.02.1884; Strauch to S 
4.01.1883 mentioning Harou\'s instructions; Strauch to S 1.02.1884 mentioning 
instructions to Hansenns; S to Elliott <<7-01|5a:0>>.84 (Stengers 141 and note 37; Diplomatic Blue Book Africa No 5, 1884, c-4o23 Papers Presented to both Houses of 
Parliament quoting treaties and signatories). Sovereignty was demanded by 
Leopold as a vital ingredient in treaties from 188z, and the earliest agreements 
of this sort were made by Valcke in October that year at Inkissi, and by Parfoury 
at Isangila in November, when S was away in Europe. Most of these sovereignty 
treaties were obtained by Valcke, Orban, Vangele, Harou, Hansenns and Elliot, 
who all received their orders directly from the king, without any reference to S. 
All the other `exclusive\', or monopolistic, treaties that are known about were 
made on dates in the second half of 188z when S was either hundreds of miles 
away on the upper Congo, or in Europe or on his way there. (Known monopolistic treaties such as Isangila, Manyanga, Ngombi, Leopoldville, Ndandanga, 
Msuata and Lufuntchu were all made in the second half of 188z when S was in 
Europe. S\'s own non-monopolistic treaties at Isangila and Manyanga had been 
signed over two years earlier.) The treaty agreed between Lutete, chief of 
Ngombi, and the Belgian officer, Lieutenant Valcke, on 20.10.1882 is typical of 
all monopolistic agreements: `The chiefs cede absolutely\' the land specified in 
the treaty, and `none other than the agents of the aforesaid Comite is authorised 
to come and trade within the limits of the territory of the said Chiefs\' (Blue
