            'Given that during his extraordinary trans-Africa expedition he had circumnavigated two of Africa\'s three great lakes for the first time, and had solved the mystery of the central African watershed by separating the Congo\'s source from the Nile\'s - not one word of which was mentioned in his letter - I found it immensely poignant that Stanley, the illegitimate workhouse boy, had still needed to attach his name to Livingstone\'s in order to make himself seem worthy of assistance. It reminded me of just how far he had come from a childhood world of parental rejection and poverty, and how, if he had not emigrated to America aged eighteen, he would never (in class-stratified Britain) have been taken on by one of the world\'s great newspapers, and so would probably have lacked the self-belief to attempt his unparalleled journey. During it, <<113|1a>>z of his original zz8 expedition members had died, including all three of his white companions, and by the end of it he had lost almost a third of his body weight and looked fifteen years older than his thirty-six years.

If, for any reason, they ever left the workhouse, which required permission, they would at once be recognized as inmates. It was as if, wrote Stanley, they had committed a crime, and yet their only offence was to have `become old, or so enfeebled by toil or sickness that they could no longer sustain themselves\', or, if young, their sin was to have been deserted." Workhouse inmates were at the bottom of the social heap, in a cruelly snobbish society, and were made to know their place every day of their lives. They rose at <<six|9b>>, and were penned into their dormitories at <<eight in the evening|5>>. Their bread and gruel was unappetizing, and meant to be. Husbands and wives were separated, parents and children too, and even brothers and sisters were kept apart. `It is a fearful fate that of a British outcast,\' wrote Stanley, `because the punishment afflicts the mind and breaks the heart.\'1z',

Henry\'s changing sides at Camp Douglas had been a matter of self-preservation, but his enlistment in the Federal navy had been entirely different: almost a demonstration of thinking himself above, or at least outside, the framework of rules by which ordinary people lived their lives. Yet Stanley would probably have been shocked if anyone had accused him of undermining Noe\'s sense of right and wrong. In all his letters to Lewis he called him his `friend and brother\', and was plainly eager to ingratiate himself with the boy\'s sister and his father, and to correspond with both. His old longing to be part of a close-knit family - and the Noes appeared to be just that - persisted. And though, in Henry\'s eyes, Lewis had disappointed by failing to be guided by him, `brother Henry\' still needed Lewis\'s unquestioning loyalty.',

The existence of the great lakes was not suspected, and the position of the sources of the Nile and Congo were matters only for fruitless conjecture. Then, between 11853 and 11856, Livingstone, in a majestic journey, crossed Africa along the line of the Zambezi. He suffered twenty-seven attacks of malaria and almost died at the half-way stage. Two years later, Richard Burton and John Speke reached Lake Tanganyika, and that same year Speke gained his first sight of an immense lake, which with typical Victorian cultural arrogance he called Lake Victoria. He returned in <<118|1a>>6z and found the vast lake\'s narrow northern outflow, which he would claim as the source of the Nile. In 11864 Samuel Baker reached a large lake north-west of Speke\'s Victoria Nyanza, the Luta Nzige, which he renamed Lake Albert. But none of these men had proved whether these nyanzas were single bodies of water, or groups of lakes. Nor did anyone know whether Lake Tanganyika - lying to the south-west of Lake Albert - fed it by a connecting river. If it did, Tanganyika (being so far to the south) would be the primary source of the Nile, rather than Speke\'s Victoria. This link was something Stanley wished to investigate, should he reach the Tanganyika in his search for Livingstone.',

He wrote in his diary: `As de Brazza will be in Paris, it will be the best occasion I shall have for explaining what we are doing, & the truth about de Brazza so far as it may be necessary to disillusionize [sic] some of our French friends who attribute to him an apostolic character!"\' `What can be done to make Stanley keep quiet?\' an anxious Leopold asked Strauch, fearing that incautious criticism of France\'s hero would redouble French efforts to secure the Congo. The king now suspected that Stanley had faked illness and come back to Europe solely to get even with de Brazza.',

            'Stanley was forty-one years old when he paused for a week in Paris in November <<118|1a>>8z, on his clandestine way back to Africa via Spain and Cadiz. With his grey cropped hair, pale penetrating eyes, and lean, deeply tanned face, Henry was a more distinguished-looking man than he had been a decade earlier. Not even the guarded detachment with which he faced the camera all his adult life could conceal his greater self-assurance and more reflective cast of mind.\' His habitual expression of latent sadness, overlaid with masterful determination, spoke eloquently of what he had endured emotionally and physically. After his great trans-Africa journey, the secret ties to his mother and half-sister, which had once been so sustaining, had started to fray and sunder. Now, travelling with Dualla and a recently engaged English valet, Stanley rarely thought of Mrs Jones and Emma. The family that he missed was his African one - Swinburne, Christophersen, Mabruki Ndogo, Susi, Uledi and the rest - with whom he felt at ease, as he never did with well-connected people in London. In Africa, it was always `a relief to find oneself among unconventional people with whom one can talk without a chance remark being flung & broadcast before readers\'.\' But he still yearned to find a woman to be close to, and perhaps marry.',

His three friends were all very conscious of his imminent departure, and of the dangers awaiting him in Africa. During the meal, Stanley was wracked by stomach and chest pains so agonizing that he thought he was dying. Smelling salts were brought, and windows thrown open, before the sick man was helped from the room. A doctor was called, who gave him a morphine injection, having debated with May Sheldon whether his patient was suffering from a heart attack, contractions of the pyloric sphincter, or inflammation of the stomach walls. Stanley sus pected he had been poisoned by some fanatical admirer of de Brazza, or by a Dutch or Portuguese trader who hated the AIC. A month earlier he had received an anonymous threat of just that. Written in French, this odious note had been mailed from Amsterdam.7 But recalling the similarity of the pains he had suffered at Manyanga, he accepted his doctor\'s diagnosis of damage to his stomach\'s lining by quinine and other medicines. As the morphine took effect, Stanley announced to his friends that he meant to catch the Madrid express at <<eight that evening|5>>, as planned!',

For eleven months this gang had been ravaging an area somewhat larger than the whole of Ireland for slaves and ivory, killing and enslaving thousands of people. In 118811 and <<118|1a>>8z there had also been raids near here, netting z,8oo slaves. In their present camp they had 2,300 captives, including children, chained together and looking so wretched and despairing that Stanley could hardly believe that `such awful wickedness was possible\'.

But to clinch it, the king had to ensure that a treaty Britain had signed with Portugal in February was never accepted internationally. France\'s ratification of the Makoko Treaty in November <<118|1a>>8z had persuaded Britain that the only way to deny France control of the Lower Congo was to hand that right to Portugal. But after discussions with Leopold, Bismarck rejected the Anglo-Portuguese treaty in June 1[ 884, effectively killing it. With Germany entering the race for African colonies, the Iron Chancellor had not wanted Britain, the principal power in Africa, to control the Congo through her puppet, Portugal. Nor did Bismarck want Leopold to be forced to hand the Congo to the French. So, the chancellor decided to support the AIC - just as Leopold had calculated he would. In Prince Bismarck\'s words, the Congo, as a state in Leopold\'s hands, would be `useful for diverting troublesome rivalries\'."',

This arose from the decision of Harper\'s - his American publisher - not to bring out his new book unless he stopped it being pirated. Because there was no copyright protection in America for the works of foreigners, Stanley was asked to give proof of nationality, or be naturalized. He had always imagined that by taking the oath of allegiance at Camp Douglas he had become an American, but now he learned that he had not. Unfortunately, to qualify for naturalization he would have to visit America and obtain an honourable discharge from the American army, from which he had deserted in the summer of <<118|1a>>6z. (He did not intend to mention his later desertion from the US navy.) Since his army desertion had been due in part to a spell in hospital, after which he had become separated from his regiment, Henry decided to claim that he had been given a medical certificate of discharge - now lost. Luckily, the records of Harper\'s Ferry Hospital had disappeared, so the Adjutant-General was delighted to be fed such a persuasive reason for striking the charge of desertion from the military record of a famous man.22',

Five years earlier, Muhammad Ahmad, the son of a boat builder from Dongola in the northern Sudan, had declared himself the Mahdi (the Expected One) and launched a jihad against the Khedive of Egypt and all his Turkish and Egyptian soldiers in the Sudan. When Britain became the de facto governing power in Egypt in <<118|1a>>8z, her servants also became candidates for holy slaughter by the Mahdi\'s rapidly growing army.

Then, in January 11885, Khartoum itself had followed, leaving Emin as the Khedive\'s only functioning representative in Sudan. In the deep south of Equatoria, close to Buganda, the Islamic faith was less entrenched, so Emin felt that by moving towards Lake Albert he might yet place himself beyond the Mahdi\'s reach.\' In this new region, the main line of communication with the outside world was not up the Nile, but eastwards to Zanzibar.

By making regular observations for latitude and longitude at <<noon|13>> on clear days, using a sextant and a chronometer, he made the first reliable maps of the two largest northern lakes, and the river system of the central African watershed. He also mapped the course of the Congo, joining a series of dots that recorded each of the positions obtained by his regular <<midday|13>> observations. He took boiling-point readings to establish heights above sea level and used a theodolite to estimate the height of distant hills. By following the Lualaba north and then west, he proved that it had no connection with the Nile, or the Niger, and was therefore the Congo, and he mapped its entire course to the Atlantic from Nyangwe. Despite his problems with hostile tribes, with rapids, and with lack of food, he managed to take nineteen observations between 4 February and z March 11877, during which time he delineated the entire top of the river's majestic hoop-like curve. His original map of the Congo was sold as Lot 3 8 at Christie's Africa Sale on 24 September zooz for \x{a3}78,ooo, almost four times its minimum estimate of \x{a3}zo,ooo. This unique map was bought by an American private collector. It should surely have been bought for the British nation.'7",

            'In a photographic exhibition in London, in August zoos, there was a photograph of a broken statue of Henry Stanley, lying on the rotting deck of the AIA , one of his own steamers launched on the Upper Congo in November <<118|1a>>8z. The man and the little ship have lain together since the 1970s in a public works lot in Kinshasa. Both are popular with photographers, since the fallen figure of Stanley in his solar topee (regulation wear for imperial officials) speaks eloquently of the absurdity of white supremacist ideas and the fate that had always awaited them. I doubt whether Stanley would have been surprised by the fall of his effigy, or by the fact that the government of Zambia is trying to get Zimbabwe to hand over to them the statue of a man, whom `the Zambians have a great deal of affection for\'. It is not Stanley, of course, but the much-photographed one of striding Dr Livingstone that overlooks Victoria Falls."',

            'The fact that the Livingstone problem seems likely to cloud Stanley\'s reputation for many years to come is another of those great ironies afflicting him. In <<118|1a>>7z, Henry had thought it made a better newspaper story to have found a wise and pious old man in the heart of Africa than to have rescued one obsessed with past insults and injuries. Through what he wrote about him, Stanley made the public forget about the deaths and disasters of the Zambezi Expedition, and enabled them to acclaim a British saint. Yet having made the man an icon of goodness, he would never escape from being adversely compared with the mythic figure he had created. `Well may he call his lecture "Through the Dark Continent",\' wrote the editor of The Anti-Slavery Reporter in November 1878. `It will be dark for him. He will stand in everlasting contrast to Livingstone, and act as a dark shadow to throw up the brightness of Livingstone\'s fame.\'',
