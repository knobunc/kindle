According to an Icelandic custom that continues to this day, the lad was given a surname derived from his father\x{2019}s first name, thus Snorri Thorfinsson.

It had just come in from Singapore and had recently performed runs to Toronto and Sydney. It was a workhorse, heavily employed on long-haul flights, and was well accustomed to flying the Atlantic.",

I checked my bags with the porter where I was staying, on Pall Mall, at <<around 10 P.M.|5>> It was a Saturday night. I was hungry and assumed I would have quite a hard time at that hour finding someplace halfway decent to eat. I strolled up through Leicester Square and into Covent Garden, walking past countless caf\x{e9}s and bistros, most with waiting clients spilling out into the street. And then, halfway along an alleyway, I came to J. Sheekey, a newly spruced-up edition of the seafood restaurant that I remember my parents taking me to when I was about ten, back in the 1950s. So fashionable is Sheekey\x{2019}s these days that I imagined it would be quite impossible to get a table, at least not without a long wait, and so I started to walk on by. Except that on a whim I turned back and ventured in, fully expecting disappointment.",
