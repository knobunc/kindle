            "Novr 17 Wednesday \x{2014} Awoke in mine and Pattys house at Northborough \x{a0} felt very fearful yet cannot say why or what about \x{2014} I call it house for it is not a home to me & cant be called <<one|9f>> \x{2014} in the morning wrote a letter off to Mr Reid in Alloa & asked if he would loan me some of his Scotch Papers \x{a0} having never had perusal of a Newspaper for some years I\x{2019}d be very grateful for some entertaining incidents or literary News but if he will be good enough to send it me I do not know \x{2014} in with my letter to him I enclosed a Song that is intended for Child Harold but I think it is not much of one and I may leave it out weather is very bad \x{2014} all \x{2018}vapour clouds and storms\x{2019} that puts a melancholly light on things so I must make a struggle & buck up if I am not to feel as abject as when I was held at Matthew Allens Prison in the Forest \x{a0} went a walk down by the old Brook in the afternoon and thought of Mary for in Truth I think of no one else although my new wife Patty Turner & our children are all kind to me \x{a0} I am a lucky man that has two wives but I confess that I am worried not to hear from Mary for so long \x{2014} I have not seen her for about a twelvemonth nor did she reply since last I wrote to her when I arrived in Northborough last July after my bold escape & walk of what they tell me is near 80 miles \x{a0} I fear she has forgot me while I was in High Beech and was sad to come upon our secret Place there by the Stream where first we sat when we were young and in the Spring of Life some 30 years ago \x{a0} the Hawthorn bush we played beneath is overgrown now so that I could not see which it was & yet I had a fancy that my First Wife might have lost some token when loves rapture thrilled us under its dark canopy those many years before \x{2014} a Lace or Buckle I might chance upon if I but pulled aside the tangled branch & twig to look yet when I tried all that I did was step up to my knee in cold wet bog and poked my eye upon a thorn so that it wept and made me nearly blind \x{a0} the Light was poor beside so that the Sun was silver through the smoke from off the Fields & looked more like the Moon \x{2014} I limped back to the cottage with my boot soaked through and some pain in my foot where I am still quite lame since I wore that bad Shoe with half the sole hung off while on my Walk from Essex \x{a0} Patty had been out about her cleaning work & being tired had little Sympathy for me when she came back \x{2014} I told her I had looked for Marys buckle in the Hawthorn by the Brook & hurt my eye but she was cross & woud have none of it & started on her old tales about how She was my only Wife with me and my sweet Mary never wed at all to hear Her tell it \x{a0} She said that she did not want to hear about the brook nor what Mary & I had done there & if I had hurt my eye it was my own fault poking in the hedgerow while I might be out and earning wages when we were so poor \x{a0} I grew indignant telling her that I had written some time back to Matthew Allen asking what has happend to the yearly sallary my daughter Queen Victoria had promised me for I was told that the first quarter had commenced before last haytime else I dreamed it so \x{a0} here Patty wept and became vexed without a reason much as Women do & said a hateful thing of Mary I shall not write in these pages \x{2014} next She said that she would not live like this for much longer & that come this Friday we must ride into Northampton Town to see a place she thought would suit me better than my time in Essex at which mention I coud feel a heavy stone of anguish sink inside me \x{2014} would have asked her more but in a fierce & stormy temper she stamped off to bed so that I am left here alone to write these words by weak and yellow Lamplight spilling down from off the shelf above the table \x{a0} so I am to be put back in an asylum for there is no other place within Northampton they would think me suited to \x{2014} Well that is it then & it cant be helpd yet I am sorry when I think of all the walking that I did on my escape from High Beech only to discover still another prison here at home \x{2014} I can recall the Sunday in July when I was freed from my incarceration for a little while to walk in Epping forest where I fell in with some travelling folk who I took to be gypseys such as I once livd with in my youth but these were of another type that dressed in reeking fur & cowskin with their hair unshawn and with barbaric paint marks on their faces \x{2014} it seems strange now when I think of it yet did not seem so then \x{2014} I got on readily enough with this rough company & they confided in me that they had but lately been bereaved laying to rest a travelling woman of their order in a Grave between the trees \x{2014} they told me that she had been troubled by a bad foot & looked at me very queerly when they said these words so that I felt afraid but not for any reason I can say \x{2014} after a time they pointed out to me a sallow & unhappy idiot boy that skulked at the far edges of their camp where other travelling childern cruelly made to drive him off with stones He wept and made a piteous yelp each time they caught him on his shin & my companions told me that this was the halfwit son of she they had so lately put beneath the soil who coud not keep himself nor work towards the common good & so was banished now he had no Mother to look out for him \x{a0} I knew a great pang in my heart towards the boy but soon he ran from sight between the spreading summer oaks & was thereafter never spoken of according to the harsh & brutal code by which such people live though I confess we in our Towns and Villages are not so very different nor less keen to make an outcast of a man \x{a0} one of the Gypseys seemed to take a shine to me and offered to assist in my escape from out the mad house hideing me there in his camp \x{a0} this seemed to me a good enough idea so that I was decided but informed him that although I had no money I woud get him fifty pounds if he woud help me get away before next Saturday to which he readily agreed \x{2014} I am not properly decided on what happened next \x{2014} sometimes it seems to me as if all of my meetings with the Gypsey took place upon that single Sunday afternoon while other times I can recall a whole week passing with me going back there on the Friday where I found my new friend seeming less than eager to pursue our plan so that I did not speak much of it & went back there two days later when I found their camp deserted and they were all gone \x{2014} whether these things occurred throughout a week or on a solitary afternoon I do not know but either way it was agen a Sunday when I stood between the sighing trees and only had a burnt & blackened circle on the grass to say my Gypsey friends had ever been there save an old wide awake hat and a straw bonnet of what they call the plumb pudding sort \x{2014} I put the hat into my pocket thinking that it might prove usefull for another oppertunity which with God\x{2019}s Will it so turned out to be \x{a0} the hour is late & I am tired with all this writing \x{2014} Patty is surely asleep by now and if I take care I do not disturb her getting into Bed then we shall have no quarrels \x{a0} She is good to me despite her wicked tongue yet when I lie beside her I wish it were Mary Clare instead, who once was Mary Joyce I am a fool & so to bed",

            "Novr 19 \x{2014} Friday \x{2014} Last night I had a dream where I returned to Northborough and found it empty with my cottage all deserted and my first wife Mary gone \x{a0} Next in \x{a0} the dream I was married agen and living in the rushes by a river with my new Wife Patty Clare who once was Patty Turner & our childern although in the queer style that things have in dreams it was as if my second wife & childern all were ducks with dark eyes and green feathers until in my sleep I cried out loud and startled them so that they flew away from me across the fens & when I woke my face was wet with tears \x{a0} went in a carriage to Northampton with my Second Wife & our Son John who at but fifteen years is quite the little man \x{a0} dressed very smart & with a grave expression \x{2014} I was proud of him & yet it tickled me to see him take his Mothers arm when we climed down from out the carriage for he played the Husbands part far better than did I myself \x{2014} there was a bitter drizzle all about the town that hung suspended like an old grey sheet above its meadows yet I loved it still \x{a0} There is a call this County has and when I was away from here in Mr Allens prison then I knew it well & heard its sweet voice that sang out to me across the fields & miles between us and my Heart was stirrd \x{a0} though I have lived in Essex and have visited in London on no less than four occasions still my home is here & I do not forsee that I shall ever have the Strength to leave agen nor yet the will to do so \x{2014} the Town is much changed since I last came here and is not so like the fond imaginings of it I had in my confinement with the Norman Castle little more now than a pile of stones and much of the surrounding common land fenced & enclosed \x{2014} the fine old Churches though are well but many of the fanciful grotesques about the stonework of St. Peters are destroyed \x{a0} I wanted to walk up to Sheep Street there to see its wonderful round church but Patty became tired & so made do with sitting on the steps between the pillars at All Saints instead at last went to an Inn to have some bread & cheese & half a pint of Ale I do not now recall its name but it sat at the top end of a lane where Bears were kept and was not far off from the round Church of the Holy Sepulcher \x{2014} there was much boisterous talk around the Tavern of a folly built nearby in Kings Thorp where the road goes out to Boughton and a Mine was drilled into the Earth with hope of finding coal \x{2014} it seems the Engineer was something of a rogue & had left bits of Coal about the Pit for men to find so that he might then sell his shares at better Profit \x{2014} I am not surprised at this for Men of Trade are ever Cheats & Liars such as Edward Drury come from Stamford and the Publisher John Taylor who between them owe me close to fifty pounds that I have not forgot for all they say my wits are ailing \x{a0} in the afternoon when I might no more put it off we went a walk to the Asylum on the Road to Billing & I must confess that it looks well enough for such a Place with old walls of brown stone that have a rustic look & that the trees beyond have overgrown though in the rain it had a dismal air \x{a0} we met a Mr Knight who was in my opinion a most serious fellow showing me much sympathy for all the questions I was asked \x{2014} he seemd most interested in my First Wife & asked when I had last seen Her to which I replied that we had been together but a year ago in Glinton whereupon he said Now come that cannot be when you have been four Years in High Beech at which I became confused and muddled in my Thoughs & so he let me Be \x{a0} he talked with Patty for a Time alone while John & I walked in the Grounds \x{2014} we Stood together & we held each other by the hand and both said Nothing looking over the asylum land down to the silverd ribbon of the Nene and all the Villages Beyond \x{a0} after a short time Patty joined Us saying that it was arranged & that there woud be found a place for me within a month whereat I was Dismayd yet made to seem that I were pleasd for Pattys Sake and for the Boy \x{2014} they say that I may go out walking when I Like & that I shall not be a prisoner such as they made me there in Essex so perhaps it may not be so Bad though we shall see and in the mean time put as Brave a face on things as Fortune will allow \x{a0} as we rode back to Northborough we did not speak of much and so I sat and gazed out from the carriage window on the darkning fields where I heard come the brief sore throated screaming of a Jay somewhere above the blackend stubble \x{a0} we passed by an Inn where Men were Singing a lewd ballad & though Patty made a fuss and scolded little John for listening it made me smile \x{2014} When I made my escape from High Beech on that Tuesday in July I took the route suggested by my friend the Gypsey though I soon went wrong and missed the lane to Enfield town and so found myself on the Enfield highway where I came upon an Inn much like the one that mine and Pattys carriage passed tonight save that the Public House there on the Enfield highway was more silent and more queer in its appearance \x{2014} when I saw it first I took it for an empty Ruin with its roof caved in but on approach I soon saw that it was a Tavern good as any in the land \x{a0} its name upon the hanging sign was The Labour in Vain which seemd peculiar to my ear and those I have since asked of it say they have never heard of such a Place \x{2014} as I passed by A person that I knew was comeing out the door this being the young Idiot boy I had seen driven from the Gypsey camp \x{a0} he had an ugly Wound upon one knee that looked as though it had turned bad & so thick was his speech I coud not understand the half of it but when I asked what Way it was to Enfield he would point and gesture so that I shoud know his meaning and I walked on filled with cheer and confidence \x{2014} so came at last by the York Road to Stevenage before the fall of dark \x{a0} I climed a paddock gate & then some paleings to a yard where was a Hovel with trussed clover piled up for my Bed \x{2014} I lay myself down with my head towards the North so that I might not lose my bearings when I woke yet slept but fitfully and had uneasy dreams \x{a0} I though My first wife lay there at my side her head at rest on my left arm and then it seemed that in the night she was took from me so that I awoke in much distress to find her gone yet as I woke I heard someone say \x{2018}Mary\x{2019} though I searched and there was nobody about and so I thanked God for his providence in finding me a bed if not a meal & once more struck out to the North \x{a0} it was a short while <<after seven|3b>> when we got home to the cottage & so very dark and young John went straight up to bed beside his brother and it was not long before Patty & I had fallen to another quarrel over Mary \x{2014} I think none the less of Her for what she says for I well know that she is tired and at her Wits End from my Antics but her words are nonsense to me \x{2014} she Says John will You not see you never married her but only knew her when she was a girl and then it is Why do you Say she is your Wife when you have none but me & so forth & so forth until my poor head is fair spinning and once more she takes herself away to bed without me and Im left with nought save yellow light and yellowd pages for my solace but there is none \x{a0} there is none",

            "enough of that I got up most refreshed and headed on towards the town though with my Foot still causing me some pain \x{a0} it was not difficult to spot Northampton when it came in view ahead for all the smoke hung out like flags on the stiff autumn breeze \x{a0} I stopped and had a drink at Becketts Well for there Thomas the Martyr that was tried and Sentenced here paused also but with more call for complaint than I and next I went on through the Dern gate into Town \x{a0} we are all sentenced in our Fashion yet with most of us there is no Trial and we are Judged by measures that we do not know \x{a0} how can they hail a Man one minute for his Verse and then the next they drop him like a burning coal when he has had his day in favour \x{a0} Its a puzzle past my wits & it woud take a better Man by far than I to give its answer \x{a0} on the third or forth day of my walk from Essex I do not know which I was so Starvd I ate the grass that grew beside the road to satisfy my hunger which it did & tasted very much like Bread so that it seemed to do me good and I went on in better Spirits than before \x{2014} after A time I reccollected that I had tobacco but my box of lucifers being exhausted I had not the means to light my pipe so chewed the stuff instead & swallowed up the quids when they were done after which time I was not hungry \x{a0} I went on through Bugden and then Stilton where I was so lame I lay me down upon a gravel causeway and went near to sleep & as I did I could hear voices that I took for Angels since at first I did not understand their tongue \x{a0} One of them that seemed a young woman said poor creature then another one more elderly said O he shams but added next O no he dont As I stood up and limped upon my way \x{2014} I heard the voices but did not look back & saw no one they came from and so on I went in way of Peterborough and my Home beyond across the summer meadows \x{a0} I am sat once more about this Journal neath the portico of All Saints on the steps here and I can see down the hill of Gold street where the money lenders have their place & past the Mare fair & Saint Peters spire to where the castle\x{2019}s piteous ruin stands down near the bridge such as it stands at all \x{2014} after I came to Town by the Dern Gate <<a little after noon|13>> I walked about a while & finding it to be a Market day resolvd to make a visit to that place not far up Drum Lane from the church where I now sit & scribble \x{a0} in the sunlight all the traders made a cheerful scene with many varied stripes and colours in their awnings and the fruits and bales of bright new linen on display & I wish now I might recall the half of all the things they cried \x{a0} the shops and houses that are built around the Market square are for the most part new & raised up since the great fire that they Had here when the square was ringed with flame & all the townsfolk made escape by going through the front door of the Welsh house where they pay the drovers come from Wales then got to safety out the back \x{a0} there is a fine old coach Inn stood upon the square three hundred years now where black tongues of soot may still be seen that lick across the old rubbd stone & I thank God for his great Providence in saving all who were not burnt that day \x{2014} after a while when I grew weary of the markets bustle I came to the graveyard at the back side of this church and walked amongst the stones a time \x{a0} I found a marker for Mat Seyzinger the famous coachman on the Nottingham Times who I saw once & who in his day had a great following \x{2014} there are not people such as once there were neither do folk now have the humour or the depth of character that they had then \x{2014} Jem Welby overturned his coach before this very church and when asked to explain he said that He had tipped his passengers out in the road to count them No doubt now hed be thought Mad & put away as I myself shall be \x{a0} Got up to the asylum on the Billing road not long before I heard the Bells chime three o clock where I am sat now by the gate \x{2014} On my Way here my thoughts were Mary this & Mary that & nothing else but Mary In my fancy I have scolded her for having been so long apart from me & then have begged her to be kind and to forgive me so confused am I in all my feelings \x{a0} are they right that say we were not Wed \x{2014} it can not be for I remember on that day we walked down by the brook did She & I and there was all made right & we were married before God \x{a0} I kneeled with her beneath the Hawthorns canopy where came a very greenish light & said There now this is our Church \x{a0} why do they try to keep me from Her and tell me such Stories that it is small wonder if I am made Mad O Mary mary why will you not see me for now I am no where unless in Despair \x{a0} when I walked here from Essex lame & dizzy in the head for want of food through Peterborough I came next to Walton & then Werrington and was upon the highway with my First Wife\x{2019}s home not far ahead so that my heart was light & when I saw a cart that came towards me with a man a woman & a boy in it I thought nought of it yet when it drew close to me it stopped \x{a0} at this the woman jumps down from the cart & tries to get me into it with her saying O John john dont you know me But I did not know her and so thought her drunk or mad as I \x{2014} but then the man sat with her says Why john this is your wife & so I looked agen and it was Patty and our son young Charles beside her \x{2014} though it frightend me I had not known her I was filled with Joy to think I had one Wife with me again and so might soon have two & thus I bade them take me on to Northborough that I should be by Marys side \x{a0} we were soon in the sight of Glinton church but Mary was not there neither coud I get any information about her further then the old story of her being dead six years ago but I woud take no notice of this blarney for was it not one year since the broadsheets said that I myself were dead and lying in my grave \x{a0} or were they right & this is Hell \x{a0} I beat upon her neighbors doors & said I thought that She was here at which they said Well you thought wrong like Hobs Hog & and they shut me out \x{2014} I sat upon the step of Marys cott in Northborough & cried while Patty & our son looked on and Said come away John cant you see shes not here \x{2014} I picked a pebble up from off the path that once perhaps her tender foot had brushed & set it in my mouth & all was lost and Patty got me to the cart \x{a0} On the way to our house that is called Poets Cottage by the people thereabout Patty sat by me in my weeping and was near in tears herself to see me so undone & all the time was saying Why john what is it that makes you say she was your wife You knew her when you were fourteen years old and she was ten and never saw her after that why do you say it why why why and I dont know and I cant say \x{a0} I sit here now by the asylum gate and watch the sun grow long upon the tired brown stone whereover slump the boughs as heavy as my Heart \x{a0} all of it vanishes like dust upon the Wind & nothing is made safe \x{2014} I rue the dwindling hedgerow and the closed off Land & am made desolate to see the meadows heaped with brick \x{2014} yet in the Market and the Town the aprons & the awnings hung above the shops are very much like flowers of a different kind & so too will be gone \x{a0} time shall unravel all of us & now the shadows move on the asylum wall so quick their movement may be seen \x{a0} I sat beneath the Hawthorn with her afterwards and said There we are married now & made her promis she woud not Tell any one what we had done \x{a0} I turn and squint to where the light floods from the West like fire & for a moment see that Sweet child stood against it like An angel but it is a sack cloth caught upon the madhouse paleings & I never shall be free agen",

I went and stood beside the London Road up near the old stone cross they\x{2019}ve got there, where Queen Eleanor was set down on her funeral procession back to London, and it wasn\x{2019}t long before I\x{2019}d thumbed a lorry down, on its way to that very place. I spun a yarn about a lift I\x{2019}d missed from some well-off old chum who drove a Bentley, and the lorry driver was soon taken in. He drove me to Tally Ho Corner on the Barnet Road and we arrived there <<about six|9b>> as it was getting light.",

I saw this pub just set back from the road a bit and thought, \x{2018}Well, I\x{2019}ve got time for one to brace me for the journey.\x{2019} Also, I could use their Gents. It\x{2019}s funny, I\x{2019}ve been out that way before and though I know most of the pubs up there, this one was new to me. I think it\x{2019}s how you come upon it, round a bend. The first sight that I had of it was when my headlights swung across and caught it, and at first it looked half derelict. They ought to do it up a bit, in my opinion. It\x{2019}d be money well spent, because set back there from the road I\x{2019}ll bet that most folk overlook it. Had a funny name, as I recall, although I can\x{2019}t think what at present.
