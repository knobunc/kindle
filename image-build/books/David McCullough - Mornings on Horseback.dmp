            "The first to reach the New World was James Bulloch of Glasgow, a scholar versed in Latin and Greek, who landed at Charleston, South Carolina, about 1729, which, as the Roosevelts measured such things, was rather late in the game, their own Claes Martenszen van Rosenvelt having arrived in New Amsterdam in 1649. (All that is known of Claes Martenszen is that he was a farmer with a wife named Jannetje, and that he was called Kleytjen, which in the idiom of the day meant Shorty.) James Bulloch became a planter, married, and attained some standing in South Carolina politics before removing to coastal Georgia, where he received a grant of several thousand acres in the Sea Island district. His wife was Jean Stobo, also of Glasgow, who, with her mother and her father, Archibald Stobo, a noted Presbyterian divine, had set forth in 1699 as part of the ill-fated effort to found a Utopian Scottish colony in the jungles of Dari\x{e9}n, on the Isthmus of Panama. The situation at Dari\x{e9}n being hopeless, the expedition, a flotilla of three ships, turned back, and on the voyage home to Scotland the Stobos\x{2019} ship, Rising Sun, stopped at Charleston to take on water and supplies. The ship anchored outside the harbor, passengers remaining aboard, but the people of Charleston, hearing Stobo was so close at hand, requested that he come preach. So consequently, he, his wife, and daughter, Jean, were safely ashore the following day when a hurricane struck, sinking the ship and taking the lives of nearly all aboard. Stobo was at once offered a pulpit\x{2014}the congregation being \x{201c}obedient to the finger of Providence\x{201d}\x{2014}and in time he became a Charleston institution, his customary sermon running to such length that it was possible to leave in the middle, go home for a large <<midday|13>> meal, and return to find him still going strong.",

A high-pitched wheeze begins. The child has to sit up. If he tries to speak at all, it is in short, desperate bursts. Soon he is unable to speak or move, except with the utmost difficulty. He is battling for breath, tugging, straining, elbows planted on his knees, shoulders hunched high, his head thrown back, eyes popping.

As I came in he beckoned to me. I ran to him and\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. my arms about him, he got up and with my help tottered to the mantel. Here suddenly his face became distorted with pain and he called out loud for ether. I left him, got the bottle and taking him in my arms put him on the sofa and drenching the handkerchief I held it on his face. Mother, Bamie, and Mary Ann came up and we sent for the doctor. This was <<10:15|2>>. From then until <<11:30|2>> all the strength I had could barely keep him on the sofa. He never said anything but \x{201c}Oh! My!\x{201d} but the agony in his face was awful. Ether and sedatives were of no avail. Little Mother stood by with a glass of water which I drank at intervals, being deathly sick. Pretty soon Father began to vomit after which he would be quiet a minute, then with face fearful with pain [he] would clasp me tight in his arms.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. The power with which he would hug me was terrific and then in a second he would be lying, white, panting, and weak as a baby in my arms with sweat in huge drops rolling down his face and neck.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. At <<11:30|2>>, thank God, the doctor came. I ran up to the Ellises, found Dr. Thomas and returned to find the doctor about to give Father chloroform. On its application Father became quiet instantly but the two doctors despaired of his life and from then until <<1:30|2>> Mother sat at his head and I by him with the chlo[roform] and handkerchief. We put him from one chlo[roform] sleep into another\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Dr. Polk relieved Mother and I at <<1:30|2>> when we tried to take a bit of lunch.

I felt so sick I stayed to smoke a cigar and after felt well and more myself. I sat in the little room with Uncles Corneil and Jim and Aunts Laura and Lizzie and little Mary Ann.

Mother, Dr.\x{2019}s Polk and Goldthwait and Uncle Jimmie by the bedside. Father seemed the same but his pulse much feebler. Dr. P[olk], Bamie, and C[onie] went to bed. Uncle Jim came up and Mother and the two uncles and Dr. G[oldthwait] and watched. Oh, my God, my father, what agonies you suffered.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. So it went on. At <<eleven fifteen|5b>> he opened his eyes. I motioned to the Dr. who applied the tube and brandy to his mouth. He did not make an effort to suck even. We put the glass up and dropped it [the brandy] down. He turned sharp to the left and throwing up his arms around, he gave one mighty clasp and then with a groan of pain turned over and with his right hand under his head and left out over the side of the sofa began the gurgling breathing of death. \x{201c}Call the doctor.\x{201d} \x{201c}Bamie\x{2014}Corinne.\x{201d} \x{201c}Mother, come here for Gods sake quick.\x{201d} And then Dr. Polk sitting by his side.

His eyelids fluttered, he gave three long breaths. It is finished. No, my God, it cannot be. \x{201c}Darling, darling, darling, I am here,\x{201d} cried my little widowed mother. I knelt down and prayed, \x{201c}Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy will be done, Thy will be done.\x{201d} As the last breath left his body the little clock on the table struck <<one|11>>\x{2014}one <<half past eleven|10>>.

Alvord had been Speaker of the Assembly the year Theodore was born.

Back at Albany again, he was made the Republican nominee for Speaker, a somewhat empty honor in view of the overwhelming Democratic majority, but one which put him at the head of his party in the Assembly at the age of twenty-four. It was almost inconceivable prominence for one so young and inexperienced, let alone so unconventional. The papers began writing about the Cleveland Democrats and the Roosevelt Republicans.

Remembering the two of them together, William Hudson of the Brooklyn Eagle would write, \x{201c}The Governor would sit large, solid, and phlegmatic, listening gravely to the energetic utterances of the mercurial young man, but signifying neither assent nor dissent.
