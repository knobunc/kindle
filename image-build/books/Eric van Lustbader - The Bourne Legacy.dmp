The guard climbed in, checked off each item on the list, then he and his partner opened every carton, checking the two chairs, credenza, cabinet and sofa bed. All the doors on the credenza and cabinet were opened, the interiors inspected, the pillows on the sofa and chairs lifted. Finding everything in order, the security guards handed back the bill of lading and gave the driver and his delivery partner directions to Ethan Hearn\x{2019}s office.",

            'Martin Lindros got the call <<just after eleven a.m.|10>> Eastern Daylight Time. He jumped into his car and made the fifteen-minute drive to George Washington Hospital in just under eight minutes. Detective Harry Harris was in the E.R. Lindros used his credentials to cut through the red tape so that one of the harried residents took him over to the bed. Lindros pulled aside the curtain that ran around three sides of the emergency room station, pulled it shut behind him.',

            "Approximately ninety minutes later Jamie Hull was below street level, checking the security at the Oskjuhlid Hotel\x{2019}s delivery entrance when he caught sight of Comrade Boris. The Russian security chief evinced surprise at Hull\x{2019}s presence, but Hull wasn\x{2019}t fooled. He\x{2019}d had a feeling that Boris had been shadowing him of late, but maybe he was just being paranoid. Not that he wouldn\x{2019}t be justified. All the principals were in the hotel. Tomorrow morning at <<eight a.m.|5>> the summit would begin and the time of maximum risk would be upon him. He dreaded the thought that somehow Comrade Boris had gotten wind of what Feyd al-Saoud had discovered, what he and the Arab security chief had concocted.",

            "Accordingly, <<just after nine p.m.|10>>, health department officials went public with their findings. Reykjavik was under a hepatitis A alert. Because they hadn\x{2019}t yet found the source of the infection, they put the city under quarantine. Over all their heads was the specter of a full-blown epidemic, something they could not afford with the terrorism summit beginning and the entire world\x{2019}s attention focused on the capital. In their television and radio interviews, the officials sought to reassure an uneasy public that they were taking every measure to gain control over the virus. To that end, they said repeatedly, the department was devoting its entire staff to the ongoing safety of the public at large.",
