Bingo receives his envelope from Wee Tots on the first of the month, it
is too often his practice, in defiance of Mrs Bingo\x{2019}s expressed wishes, to
place its contents on the nose of some horse of whose speed and resolution he
has heard good reports, and such horses have a nasty habit of pausing half-way
down the stretch to pick daisies. And this had happened now. A mistaken
confidence in Sarsaparilla for the <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>> at Ally Pally had not
only cleaned him out but had left him owing his bookie ten quid. This tenner
would have to be coughed up in the course of the next few days, and tenners in

never easy to convey every shade of your meaning by waving your arms at a
distance of forty yards, and Freddie not unnaturally missed quite a good deal
of the gist. Actually, what the girl was trying to tell him was that she had
recently met at the bandstand on the pier a man called George Perkins, employed
in a London firm of bookmakers doing business under the trade name of Joe
Sprockett; that a mutual fondness for the Overture to Zampa had drawn
them together; that she had become deeply enamoured of him; that her tender
sentiments had been fully reciprocated; that her father, who belonged to a
religious sect which disapproved of bookmakers, had refused to sanction the
match or even to be introduced to the above Perkins; that he\x{2014} her father\x{2014}had
intercepted a note from the devout lover, arranging for a meeting at the latter\x{2019}s
boarding-house (10, Marina Crescent) and a quick wedding at the local registrar\x{2019}s;
