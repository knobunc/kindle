In fact, he was among the first writers\x{2014}Joan Didion and V. S. Naipaul also come to mind\x{2014}to realize that as our culture rushed headlong into the Age of Information, it was no longer as interesting or as vital to imagine reality as to report, shape, and define it. In Cold Blood, it is now apparent, was the compass pointing the way to much of the most exciting writing that has since followed, on both sides of the border between fiction and nonfiction, from the New Journalism of Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese to the Literary Journalism of Bruce Chatwin and Ryszard Kapuscinski, from James Ellroy\x{2019}s American Tabloid to John Berendt\x{2019}s <<Midnight|13>> in the Garden of Good and Evil.",

But today he lingered, let Vic Irsik\x{2019}s sons come and leave, for the previous evening, a Friday the thirteenth, had been a tiring one, though in part exhilarating. Bonnie had resurrected her \x{201c}old self\x{201d}; as if serving up a preview of the normality, the regained vigor, soon to be, she had rouged her lips, fussed with her hair, and, wearing a new dress, accompanied him to the Holcomb School, where they applauded a student production of Tom Sawyer, in which Nancy played Becky Thatcher. He had enjoyed it, seeing Bonnie out in public, nervous but nonetheless smiling, talking to people, and they both had been proud of Nancy; she had done so well, remembering all her lines, and looking, as he had said to her in the course of backstage congratulations, \x{201c}Just beautiful, honey\x{2014}a real Southern belle.\x{201d} Whereupon Nancy had behaved like one; curtsying in her hoop-skirted costume, she had asked if she might drive into Garden City. The State Theatre was having a special, <<eleven-thirty|9j>>, Friday-the-thirteenth \x{201c}Spook Show,\x{201d} and all her friends were going. In other circumstances Mr. Clutter would have refused. His laws were laws, and one of them was: Nancy\x{2014}and Kenyon, too\x{2014}must be home by <<ten|3j>> on week nights, by <<twelve|3j>> on Saturdays. But weakened by the genial events of the evening, he had consented. And Nancy had not returned home until <<almost two|9c:1>>. He had heard her come in, and had called to her, for though he was not a man ever really to raise his voice, he had some plain things to say to her, statements that concerned less the lateness of the hour than the youngster who had driven her home\x{2014}a school basketball hero, Bobby Rupp.",

It was a <<quarter to nine|10>>, and Dick was a half hour late; however, if Dick had not hammered home the every-minute importance of the next twenty-four hours, he would not have noticed it. Time rarely weighed upon him, for he had many methods of passing it\x{2014}among them, mirror gazing. Dick had once observed, \x{201c}Every time you see a mirror you go into a trance, like. Like you was looking at some gorgeous piece of butt. I mean, my God, don\x{2019}t you ever get tired?\x{201d} Far from it; his own face enthralled him.

It was a changeling\x{2019}s face, and mirror-guided experiments had taught him how to ring the changes, how to look now ominous, now impish, now soulful; a tilt of the head, a twist of the lips, and the corrupt gypsy became the gentle romantic. His mother had been a full-blooded Cherokee; it was from her that he had inherited his coloring\x{2014}the iodine skin, the dark, moist eyes, the black hair, which he kept brilliantined and was plentiful enough to provide him with sideburns and a slippery spray of bangs. His mother\x{2019}s donation was apparent; that of his father, a freckled, ginger-haired Irishman, was less so. It was as though the Indian blood had routed every trace of the Celtic strain. Still, pink lips and a perky nose confirmed its presence, as did a quality of roguish animation, of uppity Irish egotism, which often activated the Cherokee mask and took control completely when he played the guitar and sang. Singing, and the thought of doing so in front of an audience, was another mesmeric way of whittling hours. He always used the same mental scenery\x{2014}a night club in Las Vegas, which happened to be his home town. It was an elegant room filled with celebrities excitedly focused on the sensational new star rendering his famous, backed-by-violins version of \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll Be Seeing You\x{201d} and encoring with his latest self-composed ballad:",

I used to walk it back and forth, but I always worked summers, and last year I\x{2019}d saved enough to buy my own car, a \x{2019}55 Ford. So I drove over there, got there <<a little after seven|9b>>. I didn\x{2019}t see anybody on the road or on the lane that leads up to the house, or anybody outside. Just old Teddy. He barked at me. The lights were on downstairs\x{2014}in the living room and in Mr. Clutter\x{2019}s office. The second floor was dark, and I figured Mrs. Clutter must be asleep\x{2014}if she was home. You never knew whether she was or not, and I never asked. But I found out I was right, because later in the evening Kenyon wanted to practice his horn, he played baritone horn in the school band\x{2014}and Nancy told him not to, because he would wake up Mrs. Clutter. Anyway, when I got there they had finished supper and Nancy had cleaned up, put all the dishes in the dishwasher, and the three of them\x{2014}the two kids and Mr. Clutter\x{2014}were in the living room. So we sat around like any other night\x{2014}Nancy and I on the couch, and Mr. Clutter in his chair, that stuffed rocker. He wasn\x{2019}t watching the television so much as he was reading a book\x{2014}a \x{2018}Rover Boy,\x{2019} one of Kenyon\x{2019}s books. Once he went out to the kitchen and came back with two apples; he offered one to me, but I didn\x{2019}t want it, so he ate them both. He had very white teeth; he said apples were why. Nancy\x{2014}Nancy was wearing socks and soft slippers, blue jeans, I think a green sweater; she was wearing a gold wristwatch and an I.D. bracelet I gave her last January for her sixteenth birthday\x{2014}with her name on one side and mine on the other\x{2014}and she had on a ring, some little silver thing she bought a summer ago, when she went to Colorado with the Kidwells. It wasn\x{2019}t my ring\x{2014}our ring. See, a couple of weeks back she got sore at me and said she was going to take off our ring for a while. When your girl does that, it means you\x{2019}re on probation. I mean, sure, we had fusses\x{2014}everybody does, all the kids that go steady. What happened was I went to this friend\x{2019}s wedding, the reception, and drank a beer, one bottle of beer, and Nancy got to hear about it. Some tattle told her I was roaring drunk. Well, she was stone, wouldn\x{2019}t say hello for a week. But lately we\x{2019}d been getting on good as ever, and I believe she was about ready to wear our ring again.",

But by nine, when the boys finished work\x{2014}during which they noticed nothing amiss\x{2014}the sun had risen, delivering another day of pheasant-season perfection. As they left the property and ran along the lane, they waved at an incoming car, and a girl waved back. She was a classmate of Nancy Clutter\x{2019}s, and her name was also Nancy\x{2014}Nancy Ewalt. She was the only child of the man who was driving the car, Mr. Clarence Ewalt, a middle-aged sugar-beet farmer.

The garage was there, and she noted that both cars were in it: two Chevrolet sedans. Which meant they must be home.

And we don\x{2019}t know which of the four was the main target. The primary victim. It could have been Nancy or Kenyon, or either of the parents. Some people say, Well, it must have been Mr. Clutter. Because his throat was cut; he was the most abused. But that\x{2019}s theory, not fact. It would help if we knew in what order the family died, but the coroner can\x{2019}t tell us that; he only knows the murders happened sometime between <<eleven P.M.|5>> Saturday and <<two A.M.|5>> Sunday.\x{201d} Then, responding to questions, he said no, neither of the women had been \x{201c}sexually molested,\x{201d} and no, as far as was presently known, nothing had been stolen from the house, and yes, he did think it a \x{201c}queer coincidence\x{201d} that Mr. Clutter should have taken out a forty-thousand-dollar life-insurance policy, with double indemnity, within eight hours of his death. However, Dewey was \x{201c}pretty darn sure\x{201d} that no connection existed between this purchase and the crime; how could there be one, when the only persons who benefited financially were Mr. Clutter\x{2019}s two surviving children, the elder daughters, Mrs. Donald Jarchow and Miss Beverly Clutter? And yes, he told the reporters, he did have an opinion on whether the murders were the work of one man or two, but he preferred not to disclose it.",

He still entertained a pair of opinions\x{2014}or, to use his word, \x{201c}concepts\x{201d}\x{2014}and, in reconstructing the crime, had developed both a \x{201c}single-killer concept\x{201d} and a \x{201c}double-killer concept.\x{201d} In the former, the murderer was thought to be a friend of the family, or, at any rate, a man with more than casual knowledge of the house and its inhabitants\x{2014}someone who knew that the doors were seldom locked, that Mr. Clutter slept alone in the master bedroom on the ground floor, that Mrs. Clutter and the children occupied separate bedrooms on the second floor. This person, so Dewey imagined, approached the house on foot, probably <<around midnight|13>>. The windows were dark, the Clutters asleep, and as for Teddy, the farm\x{2019}s watchdog\x{2014}well, Teddy was famously gun-shy. He would have cringed at the sight of the intruder\x{2019}s weapon, whimpered, and crept away. On entering the house, the killer first disposed of the telephone installations\x{2014}one in Mr. Clutter\x{2019}s office, the other in the kitchen\x{2014}and then, after cutting the wires, he went to Mr. Clutter\x{2019}s bedroom and awakened him. Mr. Clutter, at the mercy of the gun-bearing visitor, was forced to obey instructions\x{2014}forced to accompany him to the second floor, where they aroused the rest of the family. Then, with cord and adhesive tape supplied by the killer, Mr. Clutter bound and gagged his wife, bound his daughter (who, inexplicably, had not been gagged), and roped them to their beds. Next, father and son were escorted to the basement, and there Mr. Clutter was made to tape Kenyon and tie him to the playroom couch. Then Mr. Clutter was taken into the furnace room, hit on the head, gagged, and trussed. Now free to do as he pleased, the murderer killed them one by one, each time carefully collecting the discharged shell. When he had finished, he turned out all the lights and left.",

In all truthfulness & with love for you Perry, for you are my only living brother and the uncle of my children, I cannot say or feel your attitude towards our father or your imprisonment JUST or healthy. If you are getting your back up\x{2014}better simmer down as I realize there are none of us who take criticism cheerfully & it is natural to feel a certain amount of resentment towards the one giving this criticism so I am prepared for one or two things\x{2014}a) Not to hear from you at all, or b) a letter telling me exactly what you think of me.
I hope I\x{2019}m wrong & I sincerely hope you will give this letter a lot of thought & try to see\x{2014}how someone else feels. Please understand I know I am not an authority & I do not boast great intelligence or education but I do believe I am a normal individual with basic reasoning powers & the will to live my life according to the laws of God & Man. It is also true that I have \x{201c}fallen\x{201d} at times, as is normal\x{2014}for as I said I am human & therefore I too have human weaknesses but the point is, again, There is no shame\x{2014}having a dirty face\x{2014}the shame comes when you keep it dirty. No one is more aware of my shortcomings and mistakes than myself so I won\x{2019}t bore you further.
Now, first, & most important\x{2014}Dad is not responsible for your wrong doings or your good deeds. What you have done, whether right or wrong, is your own doing. From what I personally know, you have lived your life exactly as you pleased without regard to circumstances or persons who loved you\x{2014}who might be hurt. Whether you realize it or not\x{2014}your present confinement is embarrassing to me as well as Dad\x{2014}not because of what you did but the fact that you don\x{2019}t show me any signs of SINCERE regret and seem to show no respect for any laws, people or anything. Your letter implies that the blame of all your problems is that of someone else, but never you. I do admit that you are intelligent & your vocabulary is excellent & I do feel you can do anything you decide to do & do it well but what exactly do you want to do & are you willing to work & make an honest effort to attain whatever it is you choose to do? Nothing good comes easy & I\x{2019}m sure you\x{2019}ve heard this many times but once more won\x{2019}t hurt.
In case you want the truth about Dad\x{2014}his heart is broken because of you. He would give anything to get you out so he can have his son back\x{2014}but I am afraid you would only hurt him worse if you could. He is not well and is getting older &, as the saying goes, he cannot \x{201c}Cut the Mustard\x{201d} as in the old days. He has been wrong at times & he realizes this but whatever he had and wherever he went he shared his life & belongings with you when he wouldn\x{2019}t do this for anyone else. Now I don\x{2019}t say you owe him undying gratitude or your life but you do owe him RESPECT and COMMON DECENCY. I, personally, am proud of Dad. I love him & Respect him as my Dad & I am only sorry he chose to be the Lone Wolf with his son, or he might be living with us and share our love instead of alone in his little trailer & longing & waiting & lonesome for you, his son. I worry for him & when I say I I mean my husband too for my husband respects our Dad. Because he is a MAN. It\x{2019}s true that Dad did not have a great extensive education but in school we only learn to recognize the words and to spell but the application of these words to real life is another thing that only LIFE & LIVING can give us. Dad has lived & you show ignorance in calling him uneducated & unable to understand \x{201c}the scientific meaning etc\x{201d} of life\x{2019}s problems. A mother is still the only one who can kiss a boo-boo and make it all well\x{2014}explain that scientifically.
I\x{2019}m sorry to let you have it so strong but I feel I must speak my piece. I am sorry that this must be censored [by the prison authorities], & I sincerely hope this letter is not detrimental towards your eventual release but I feel you should know & realize what terrible hurt you have done. Dad is the important one as I am dedicated to my family but you are the only one Dad loves\x{2014}in short, his \x{201c}family.\x{201d} He knows I love him, of course, but the closeness is not there, as you know.
Your confinement is nothing to be proud of and you will have to live with it & try & live it down & it can be done but not with your attitude of feeling everyone is stupid & uneducated & un-understanding. You are a human being with a free will. Which puts you above the animal level. But if you live your life without feeling and compassion for your fellow-man\x{2014}you are as an animal\x{2014}\x{201c}an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\x{201d} & happiness & peace of mind is not attained by living thus.
As far as responsibility goes, no one really wants it\x{2014}but all of us are responsible to the community we live in & its laws. When the time comes to assume the responsibility of a home and children or business, this is the seeding of the boys from the Men\x{2014}for surely you can realize what a mess the world would be if everyone in it said, \x{201c}I want to be an individual, without responsibilities, & be able to speak my mind freely & do as I alone will.\x{201d} We are all free to speak & do as we individually will\x{2014}providing this \x{201c}freedom\x{201d} of Speech & Deed are not injurious to our fellow-man.
Think about it, Perry. You are above average in intelligence, but somehow your reasoning is off the beam. Maybe it\x{2019}s the strain of your confinement. Whatever it is\x{2014}remember\x{2014}you & only you are responsible and it is up to you and you alone to overcome this part of your life. Hoping to hear from you soon.",

Waiting for Perry outside the post office, Dick was in excellent spirits; he had reached a decision that he was certain would eradicate his current difficulties and start him on a new road, with a new rainbow in view.

The reason was, the sheriff wanted to keep him and Hickock separated from each other until after their trial. The afternoon they brought them in, I made six apple pies and baked some bread and all the while kept track of the goings-on down there on the Square.

Well, it must be a terrible experience\x{2014}to be stared at by a horde of strangers, to have to walk among them, and them knowing who you are and what you did. Then they brought up Smith. I had some supper ready to serve them in their cells, hot soup and coffee and some sandwiches and pie. Ordinarily, we feed just twice a day. Breakfast at <<seven-thirty|5b>>, and at <<four-thirty|5b>> we serve the main meal. But I didn\x{2019}t want those fellows going to bed on an empty stomach; seemed to me they must be feeling bad enough without that. But when I took Smith his supper, carried it in on a tray, he said he wasn\x{2019}t hungry. He was looking out the window of the ladies\x{2019} cell. Standing with his back to me. That window has the same view as my kitchen window: trees and the Square and the tops of houses. I told him, \x{2018}Just taste the soup, it\x{2019}s vegetable, and not out of a can. I made it myself. The pie, too.\x{2019} In about an hour I went back for the tray and he hadn\x{2019}t touched a crumb. He was still at the window. Like he hadn\x{2019}t moved. It was snowing, and I remember saying it was the first snow of the year, and how we\x{2019}d had such a beautiful long autumn right till then. And now the snow had come. And then I asked him if he had any special dish he liked; if he did I\x{2019}d try and fix it for him the next day. He turned round and looked at me. Suspicious, like I might be mocking him. Then he said something about a movie\x{2014}he had such a quiet way of speaking, almost a whisper. Wanted to know if I had seen a movie. I forget the name, anyway I hadn\x{2019}t seen it: never have been much for picture shows. He said this show took place in Biblical times, and there was a scene where a man was flung off a balcony, thrown to a mob of men and women, who tore him to pieces. And he said that was what came to mind when he saw the crowd on the Square. The man being torn apart. And the idea that maybe that was what they might do to him. Said it scared him so bad his stomach still hurt. Which was why he couldn\x{2019}t eat.

Moreover, Smith, while dictating his statement, had revealed the whereabouts of other potent evidence. \x{201c}We hit the highway and drove east,\x{201d} he\x{2019}d said, in the process of describing what he and Hickock had done after fleeing the murder scene. \x{201c}Drove like hell, Dick driving.

I got out of the car, and siphoned some water out of the water tank and washed the blood off the gun barrel.

            "I will try to tell you all I can about myself, though most of my early life is vague to me\x{2014}up until about my tenth birthday. My school years went quite the same as most other boys my own age. I had my share of fights, girls, and other things that go with a growing boy. My home life was also normal, but as I told you before, I was hardly ever allowed to leave my yard and visit with playmates. My father was always strict about us boys [his brother and him] in that line. Also I had to help my dad quite a lot around the house.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I can only remember my mother and dad having one argument that amounted to anything. What it was about, I don\x{2019}t know.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. My dad bought me a bicycle once, and I believe that I was the proudest boy in town. It was a girl\x{2019}s bike and he changed it over to a boy\x{2019}s. He painted it all up and it looked like new. But I had a lot of toys when I was little, a lot for the financial condition that my folks were in. We were always what you would call semi-poor. Never down and out, but several times on the verge of it. My dad was a hard worker and did his best to provide for us. My mother also was always a hard worker. Her house was always neat, and we had clean clothes aplenty. I remember my dad used to wear those old fashioned flat crown caps, and he would make me wear them too, and I didn\x{2019}t like them.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. In high-school I did real well, made above average grades the first year or two. But then started falling off a little. I had a girl friend. She was a nice girl, and I never once tried to touch her anyway but just kissing. It was a real clean courtship.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. While in school I participated in all the sports, and received 9 letters in all. Basketball, football, track and baseball. My senior year was best. I never had any steady girl, just played the field. That was when I had my first relationship with a girl. Of course I told the boys that I\x{2019}d had a lot of girls.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I got offers from two colleges to play ball, but never attended any of them. After I graduated from school I went to work for the Santa Fe railroad, and stayed until the following winter when I got laid off. The following spring I got a job with the Roark Motor Company. I had been working there about four months when I had an automobile wreck with a company car. I was in the hospital several days with extensive head injuries. While I was in the condition I was in I couldn\x{2019}t find another job, so I was unemployed most of the winter. Meantime, I had met a girl and fallen in love. Her dad was a Baptist preacher and resented me going with her. In July we were married. All hell broke loose from her dad until he learned she was pregnant. But still he never wished me good luck and that has always gone against the grain. After we were married, I worked at a service-station near Kansas City. I worked from <<8 at night|5>> till <<8 in the morning|5>>. Sometimes my wife stayed with me all night\x{2014}she was afraid I couldn\x{2019}t keep awake, so she came to help me. Then I got an offer to work at Perry Pontiac, which I gladly accepted. It was very satisfactory, though I didn\x{2019}t make a lot of money\x{2014}\$75 a week.

First he stopped at the campus house where he roomed; he talked with the landlady, told her that he had come to pick up his typewriter, and that because of the bad weather the trip from Wolcott to Lawrence had taken two hours. Departing, he visited a movie theater, where, uncharacteristically, he chatted with an usher and a candy vendor. At <<eleven|9v>>, when the movie let out, he returned to Wolcott.

The reason was, the sheriff wanted to keep him and Hickock separated from each other until after their trial. The afternoon they brought them in, I made six apple pies and baked some bread and all the while kept track of the goings-on down there on the Square. My kitchen window overlooks the Square; you couldn\x{2019}t want a better view.

And then I asked him if he had any special dish he liked; if he did I\x{2019}d try and fix it for him the next day. He turned round and looked at me. Suspicious, like I might be mocking him. Then he said something about a movie\x{2014}he had such a quiet way of speaking, almost a whisper. Wanted to know if I had seen a movie. I forget the name, anyway I hadn\x{2019}t seen it: never have been much for picture shows. He said this show took place in Biblical times, and there was a scene where a man was flung off a balcony, thrown to a mob of men and women, who tore him to pieces. And he said that was what came to mind when he saw the crowd on the Square. The man being torn apart. And the idea that maybe that was what they might do to him. Said it scared him so bad his stomach still hurt. Which was why he couldn\x{2019}t eat.

My school years went quite the same as most other boys my own age. I had my share of fights, girls, and other things that go with a growing boy. My home life was also normal, but as I told you before, I was hardly ever allowed to leave my yard and visit with playmates. My father was always strict about us boys [his brother and him] in that line. Also I had to help my dad quite a lot around the house.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I can only remember my mother and dad having one argument that amounted to anything. What it was about, I don\x{2019}t know.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. My dad bought me a bicycle once, and I believe that I was the proudest boy in town. It was a girl\x{2019}s bike and he changed it over to a boy\x{2019}s. He painted it all up and it looked like new. But I had a lot of toys when I was little, a lot for the financial condition that my folks were in. We were always what you would call semi-poor. Never down and out, but several times on the verge of it. My dad was a hard worker and did his best to provide for us. My mother also was always a hard worker. Her house was always neat, and we had clean clothes aplenty. I remember my dad used to wear those old fashioned flat crown caps, and he would make me wear them too, and I didn\x{2019}t like them.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. In high-school I did real well, made above average grades the first year or two. But then started falling off a little. I had a girl friend. She was a nice girl, and I never once tried to touch her anyway but just kissing. It was a real clean courtship.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. While in school I participated in all the sports, and received 9 letters in all. Basketball, football, track and baseball. My senior year was best. I never had any steady girl, just played the field. That was when I had my first relationship with a girl. Of course I told the boys that I\x{2019}d had a lot of girls.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I got offers from two colleges to play ball, but never attended any of them. After I graduated from school I went to work for the Santa Fe railroad, and stayed until the following winter when I got laid off. The following spring I got a job with the Roark Motor Company. I had been working there about four months when I had an automobile wreck with a company car. I was in the hospital several days with extensive head injuries. While I was in the condition I was in I couldn\x{2019}t find another job, so I was unemployed most of the winter. Meantime, I had met a girl and fallen in love. Her dad was a Baptist preacher and resented me going with her. In July we were married. All hell broke loose from her dad until he learned she was pregnant. But still he never wished me good luck and that has always gone against the grain. After we were married, I worked at a service-station near Kansas City. I worked from <<8 at night|5>> till <<8 in the morning|5>>. Sometimes my wife stayed with me all night\x{2014}she was afraid I couldn\x{2019}t keep awake, so she came to help me. Then I got an offer to work at Perry Pontiac, which I gladly accepted. It was very satisfactory, though I didn\x{2019}t make a lot of money\x{2014}\$75 a week.

But for six years, or since 1954, there had been no pay checks for a hangman in Kansas (except at the Army and Air Force Disciplinary Barracks, which also has a gallows). The late George Docking, Governor of Kansas from 1957 through 1960, was responsible for this hiatus, for he was unreservedly opposed to the death penalty (\x{201c}I just don\x{2019}t like killing people\x{201d}).",

            "Andrews, according to statements credited to him, \x{201c}didn\x{2019}t feel anything about it. The time came, and I was doing what I had to do. That\x{2019}s all there was to it.\x{201d} After the shootings he raised a window in his bedroom and removed the screen, then roamed the house rifling dresser drawers and scattering the contents: it was his intention to blame the crime on thieves. Later, driving his father\x{2019}s car, he traveled forty miles over snow-slippery roads to Lawrence, the town where the University of Kansas is located; en route, he parked on a bridge, dismantled his lethal artillery, and disposed of it by dropping the parts into the Kansas River. But of course the journey\x{2019}s true purpose was to arrange an alibi. First he stopped at the campus house where he roomed; he talked with the landlady, told her that he had come to pick up his typewriter, and that because of the bad weather the trip from Wolcott to Lawrence had taken two hours. Departing, he visited a movie theater, where, uncharacteristically, he chatted with an usher and a candy vendor. At <<eleven|9v>>, when the movie let out, he returned to Wolcott. The family\x{2019}s mongrel dog was waiting on the front porch; it was whining with hunger, so Lowell Lee, entering the house and stepping across his father\x{2019}s corpse, prepared a bowl of warm milk and mush; then, while the dog was lapping it up, he telephoned the sheriff\x{2019}s office and said, \x{201c}My name is Lowell Lee Andrews. I live at 6040 Wolcott Drive, and I want to report a robbery\x{2014}\x{201d}",

And this big dark-haired boy, Lowell Lee, he was sitting on the porch petting his dog. Patting it on the head. Lieutenant Athey asked the boy what happened, and he pointed to the door, real casual, and said, \x{2018}Look in there.\x{2019}\x{a0}\x{201d} Having looked, the astonished officers summoned the county coroner, a gentleman who was also impressed by young Andrews\x{2019} callous nonchalance, for when the coroner asked him what funeral arrangements he wished to have made, Andrews replied with a shrug, \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t care what you do with them.\x{201d}",

Though convinced he was lying, the detectives listened respectfully to the tale of how he had driven to Lawrence to fetch a typewriter, gone to a movie, and arrived home <<after midnight|13>> to find the bedrooms ransacked and his family slain.

Awakened by an urgent call from the county coroner, Dameron presented himself at the jail <<around 3:00 A.M.|2a>>, whereupon detectives, who had been strenuously but abortively interrogating the suspect, withdrew to another room, leaving the minister to consult privately with his parishioner. It proved a fatal interview for the latter, who many months afterward gave this account of it to a friend: \x{201c}Mr. Dameron said, \x{2018}Now, Lee, I\x{2019}ve known you all your life. Since you were just a little tadpole. And I knew your daddy all his life, we grew up together, we were childhood friends. And that\x{2019}s why I\x{2019}m here\x{2014}not just because I\x{2019}m your minister, but because I feel like you\x{2019}re a member of my own family.

He had never attended an execution, and when on the <<midnight|13>> past he entered the cold warehouse, the scenery had surprised him: he had anticipated a setting of suitable dignity, not this bleakly lighted cavern cluttered with lumber and other debris. But the gallows itself, with its two pale nooses attached to a crossbeam, was imposing enough; and so, in an unexpected style, was the hangman, who cast a long shadow from his perch on the platform at the top of the wooden instrument\x{2019}s thirteen steps. The hangman, an anonymous, leathery gentleman who had been imported from Missouri for the event, for which he was paid six hundred dollars, was attired in an aged double-breasted pin-striped suit overly commodious for the narrow figure inside it\x{2014}the coat came nearly to his knees; and on his head he wore a cowboy hat which, when first bought, had perhaps been bright green, but was now a weathered, sweat-stained oddity.",
