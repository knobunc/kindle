Peggy is not required until <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>>, because little Georgie\x{2019}s parents are taking charge of him themselves for once, and he is going to visit his grandmother. Not required like a piece of luggage which is indispensable but can go in the guard\x{2019}s van for the time being, thinks Clare. And Clare has done her week\x{2019}s baking, and made her father turn out of his study while she cleaned it. Her bread came out of the oven hard and grey, but even Francis Coyne is unlikely to be fastidious about it. No one can do better now, not with this flour. It is all they can get, and Clare knows they are lucky to have it. In the cities women queue for hours, and besiege the bakers\x{2019} shops as soon as they open. But she won\x{2019}t think of that now. It is Saturday afternoon, and she is lying in the sun, which fixes on her dark dress like a burning-glass, soaking away the tiredness in her thigh muscles. Out of the wind, it is almost too hot. She hoists herself up on her elbows, and the wind tugs at her again. The coast and country stream with light. Sea and grass pucker like cat\x{2019}s fur under the warm May wind.",

Westerly light drips through stained glass on to her hair, through the languid figure of a craggy-jawed Pre-Raphaelite beauty. Her long green robes make green blobs on the black and white tiled floor. Clare runs a finger round the outline of a big, bare foot which peeks out of the draperies. She used to reach up and huff her breath on the toes to see them cloud. She used to think the figures were angels, not second-hand Lizzie Siddals.",

            "Francis Coyne is mapping the distribution of travelling plants in an area seven miles around St Ives. He is more interested in travelling species than in the close-rooted kind which has always been at home here, clinging to its habitat. Seeding by bird-droppings, accidental migrations in sailors\x{2019} knapsacks, carefully harvested pods and cuttings which survive, freakishly, half-way around the planet: these interest him. When Clare was a child, the only fairy stories he told her were the stories of plants: their places of birth and their uprootings, their adventures, adaptations and survivals. At <<six|9m>> and seven and eight she had listened, fascinated; now she\x{2019}s nearly twenty, and she has become impatient. Or perhaps she had never been patient, or even interested at all. She had drunk up attention, and even if it came to her filtered through a strange dialect of pedicels, racemes and bracts, she was capable of burrowing past the information to the cadences of her father\x{2019}s voice, his smell, his light hands that never clasped her as tightly as she wanted. Now Francis Coyne is supposed to be writing a book, and Clare is supposed to be helping him. He is a self-taught botanist, an amateur, as he will admit to anyone who asks him. No expert. But it is his enthusiasm, gentlemanly and kept well within bonds.",
