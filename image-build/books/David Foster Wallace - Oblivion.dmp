            "The figure that began its free climb up the building\x{2019}s steadily increscent north facet <<just before 11:00 AM|2a>> was outfitted in tight windproof Lycra leggings and a snug hooded GoreTex sweatshirt w/fiber-lined hood up and tied tight and what appeared to be mountaineering or rock-climbing boots except that instead of crampons or spikes there were suction cups lining the instep of each boot. Attached to both palms and wrists\x{2019} insides were single suction cups the size of a plumber\x{2019}s helper; the cups\x{2019} color was the same shrill orange as hunting jackets and road crews\x{2019} hardhats. The Lycra pants\x{2019} color scheme was one navy-blue leg and one white leg; the sweatshirt and hood were blue with white piping. The mountaineering boots were an emphatic black. The figure moved swiftly and with numerous moist popping suction-noises up the display window of the Gap, a large retail clothier. He then pulled himself up and over onto the narrow ledge at the base of the second-floor window, rose complexly to his feet, affixed his cups, and swarmed up the pane\x{2019}s thick glass, which gave onto the Gap\x{2019}s second floor but had no promotional items displayed within. The figure presented as lithe and expert. His manner of climbing appeared almost more reptilian than mammalian, you\x{2019}d have to say. He was halfway up the window of a management consulting firm on the fifth floor when a small crowd of passersby began to gather on the sidewalk below. Winds at ground level were light to moderate.",

            "The conference room\x{2019}s carpeting was magenta pile in which wheels left symmetrically distended impressions when one or more of the men adjusted their executive swivel chairs slightly to reposition their legs or their bodies\x{2019} relation to the table itself. The ventilation system laid a pale hum over tiny distant street and city noises which the window\x{2019}s thickness itself cut to almost nothing. Each of the Targeted Focus Group\x{2019}s members wore a blue-and-white nametag with his first name inscribed thereon by hand. 42.8% of these inscriptions were cursive or script; three of the remaining eight were block capitals, with all the block-cap first names, in a remarkable but statistically meaningless coincidence, beginning with H. Sometimes, too, Schmidt would as it were take a step back inside his head and view the Focus Group as a unit, a right-angled mass of fleshtone busts; he\x{2019}d observe all the faces at once, qua group, so that nothing but the very broadest commonalities passed through his filter. The faces were well-nourished, mid- to upscale, neutral, provisionally attentive, the blood-fed minds behind them occupied with their own owners\x{2019} lives, jobs, problems, plans, desires, & c. None had been hungry a day in their lives\x{2014}this was a core commonality, and for Schmidt this one did ramify. It was rare that the product ever truly penetrated a Focus Group\x{2019}s consciousness. One of the first things a Field Researcher accepts is that the product is never going to have as important a place in a TFG\x{2019}s minds as it did in the Client\x{2019}s. Advertising is not voodoo. The Client could ultimately hope only to create the impression of a connection or resonance between the brand and what was important to consumers. And what was important to consumers was, always and invariably, themselves. What they conceived themselves to be. The Focus Groups made little difference in the long run\x{2014}the only true test was real sales, in Schmidt\x{2019}s personal opinion. Part of today\x{2019}s design was to go past lunch and keep the members eating only confections. Assuming a normal breakfasttime prior to arrival, one could expect their blood sugar to start heading down sharply by <<11:30|2>>. The ones who ate the most Felonies! would be hit the hardest. Among other symptoms, low blood sugar produces oscitance, irritability, lowered inhibitions\x{2014}their game-faces would begin to slip a bit. Some of the TFG strategies could be extremely manipulative or even abusive in the name of data. A bleach-alternative detergent\x{2019}s agency had once hired Team \x{394}y to convene primipara mothers aged 29 to 34 whose TATs had indicated insecurities at three key loci and to administer questionnaires whose items were designed to provoke and/or heighten those insecurities\x{2014}Do you ever have negative or hostile feelings towards your child? How often do you feel as if you must hide or deny the fact that your parenting skills are inadequate? Have teachers or other parents ever made remarks about your child which embarrassed you? How often do you feel as if your child looks shabby or unclean in comparison to other children? Have you ever neglected to launder, bleach, mend or iron your child\x{2019}s clothes because of time constraints? Does your child ever seem sad or anxious for no reason you can understand? Can you think of a time when your child appeared to be frightened of you? Does your child\x{2019}s behavior or appearance ever provoke negative feelings in you? Have you ever said or thought negative things about your child? & c.\x{2014}which, over eleven hours and six separate rounds of carefully designed questionnaires, brought the women to such an emotional state that truly invaluable data on how to pitch Cheer Xtra in terms of very deep maternal anxieties and conflicts emerged . . . data that so far as Schmidt had been able to see went wholly unexploited in the campaign the agency had finally sold P. & G. on. Darlene Lilley had later said she had felt like calling the Focus Group\x{2019}s women and apologizing and letting them know that they\x{2019}d been totally set up and manhandled, emotionally speaking.",

            "41.6% of what Schmidt mistakenly believed were the TFG\x{2019}s twelve true sample consumers were presenting with the classic dilated eyes and shiny pallor of low-grade insulin shock as Schmidt announced that he\x{2019}d decided to \x{2018}privately confide\x{2019} to the men that the product\x{2019}s original proposed trade name had actually been Devils!, a cognomen designed both to connote the snack cake\x{2019}s chocolate-intensive composition and to simultaneously invoke and parody associations of sin, sinful indulgence, yielding to temptation, & c., and that considerable resources had been devoted to developing, refining, and target-testing the product inside various combinations of red-and-black individual wrappers with various cartoonishly demonic incarnations of the familiar Mister Squishy icon, presented here as rubicund and heavy-browed and grinning fiendishly instead of endearingly, before negative test data scrapped the whole strategy. Both Darlene Lilley and Trudi Keener had worked some of these early Focus Groups, which apparently some intr\x{e4}agency political enemy of the Creative Packaging Director at Reesemeyer Shannon Belt who\x{2019}d pitched the trade name Devils! had used his (meaning the CPD\x{2019}s enemy\x{2019}s) influence with R.S.B.\x{2019}s MROP coordinator to stock heavily with consumers from downstate IL\x{2014}a region that as Terry Schmidt knew all too well tended to be Republican and Bible-Beltish\x{2014}and without going into any of the Medicean intrigues and retaliations that had ended up costing three midlevel R.S.B. executives their jobs and resulted in at least one six-figure settlement to forestall WT litigation (which was the only truly interesting part of the story, Schmidt himself believed, jingling a pocket\x{2019}s contents and watching his cordovan rotate slowly from <<10:00|2>> to <<2:00|2>> and back again as straticulate clouds in the lake\x{2019}s upper atmosphere began to lend the sunlight a pearly cast that the conference room\x{2019}s windows embrowned), the nub was that the stacked Groups\x{2019} responses to taglines that included Sinfully Delicious, Demonically Indulgent, and Why Do You Think It\x{2019}s Called [in red] Temptation?, as well as to video storyboards in which shadowed and voice-distorted figures in hoods supposedly confessed to being regular upstanding citizens and consumers who unbeknownst to anyone \x{2018}worshipped the Devil\x{2019} in \x{2018}secret orgies of indulgence,\x{2019} had been so uniformly extreme as to produce markedly different Taste and Overall Satisfaction aggregates for the snack cakes on IRPs and GRDSs completed before and after exposure to the lines and boards themselves, which after much midlevel headrolling and high-level caucuses had resulted in the present Felonies!, with its milder penal and thus renegade associations designed to offend absolutely no one except maybe anticrime wackos and prison-reform fringes. With the facilitator\x{2019}s stated point being that please let none of those assembled here today doubt that their judgments and responses and the hard evaluative work they had already put in and would shortly plunge into again qua group in the vital GRDS phase were important or were taken very seriously indeed by the folks over at Mister Squishy.",

            "The real principle behind running Field research in which some of the TFGs completed only IRPs and some were additionally convened in juridical groups to hammer out a GRDS was to allow Team \x{394}y to provide Reesemeyer Shannon Belt with two distinct and statistically complete sets of market research data, thereby allowing R.S.B. to use and evince whichever data best reinforced the research results that they believed Mister Squishy and N.A.S.C. most wanted to see. Schmidt, Darlene Lilley, and Trudi Keener had all been given tacitly to understand that this same principle informed the experimental subdivision of today\x{2019}s TFG juries into so-called No-Access and Full-Access groups, which latter were to be given what the members were told was special behind-the-scenes information on the genesis, production, and marketing goals of the product\x{2014}meaning that, whether retroscenic access to marketing agendas created substantive differences in the Focus Groups\x{2019} mean GRDSs or not, Team \x{394}y and R.S.B. clearly wanted access to different data fields from which they could pick and choose and use slippery hypergeometric statistical techniques to manipulate as they believed Client saw fit. In the green room, only A. Ronald Mounce, M.S.\x{2014}who is Robert Awad\x{2019}s personal mentee and probable heir apparent and is also his mole among the Field Researchers, whose water cooler chitchat Mounce distills and reports via special #0302 Field Concerns and Morale forms that Awad\x{2019}s earnest young Administrative Asst. provides Mounce with in the same manila envelopes all the day\x{2019}s IRP and GRDS packets are distributed to Field Teams in\x{2014}only Mounce has been told privately that the unconventional Full- and No-Access Mister Squishy TFG design is in fact part of a larger field experiment that Alan Britton and Team \x{394}y\x{2019}s upper management\x{2019}s secret inner executive circle (said circle incorporated by Britton as a \x{a7}543 Personal Holding Company under the dummy name Dy Associates) is conducting for its own sub rosa research into TFGs\x{2019} probable role in the ever more complex and self-conscious marketing strategies of the future. The basic idea, as Robert Awad saw fit to explain to Mounce on Awad\x{2019}s new catamaran one June day when they were becalmed and drifting four nautical miles off Montrose-Wilson Beach\x{2019}s private jetties, was that as the ever-evolving US consumer became more savvy and discerning about media and marketing and tactics of product positioning\x{2014}a sudden insight into today\x{2019}s average individual consumer mind which Awad explained he had achieved in his health club\x{2019}s sauna one day after handball when the intellectual property attorney he had just decisively trounced was praising an A.C. Romney-Jaswat campaign for the new carbonated beverage Surge whose tightly demotargeted advertisements everyone had been seeing all over the metro area that quarter, and remarked (the nude and perspiring intellectual property attorney had) that he probably found all these modern youth-targeted ads utilizing jagged guitar riffs and epithets like dude and the whole ideology of rebellion-via-consumption so fascinating and got such a hoot out of them because he himself was so far out of the demographic (using the actual word demographic) for a campaign like Surge\x{2019}s that even as an amateur he found himself disinterestedly analyzing the ads\x{2019} strategies and pitches and appreciating them more like pieces of art or fine pastry than like mere ads, then had (meaning the attorney had, right there in the sauna, wearing only plastic thongs and a towel wrapped Sikh-style around his head, according to Awad) proceeded casually to deconstruct the strategies and probable objectives of the Surge campaign with such acuity that it was almost as if the fellow had somehow been right there in the room at A.C. Romney-Jaswat\x{2019}s MROP team\x{2019}s brainstorming and strategy confabs with Team \x{394}y, who as Mounce was of course aware had done some first-stage Focus Group work for A.C.R.-J./Coke on Surge six quarters past before the firm\x{2019}s gradual emigration to R.S.B. as a Captured Shop. Awad, whose knowledge of small craft operation came entirely from a manual he was now using as a paddle, told Mounce that the idea\x{2019}s gist\x{2019}s thrust here involved what was known in the industry as a Narrative (or, \x{2018}Story\x{2019}) Campaign and the concept of making some new product\x{2019}s actual marketers\x{2019} strategies and travails themselves a part of that product\x{2019}s essential Story\x{2014}as in for historic examples that Chicago\x{2019}s own Keebler Inc.\x{2019}s hard confections were manufactured by elves in a hollow tree, or that Pillsbury\x{2019}s Green Giant-brand canned and frozen vegetables were cultivated by an actual giant in his eponymous Valley\x{2014}but with the added narrative twist or hook now of, say for instance, advertising Mister Squishy\x{2019}s new Felony! line as a disastrously costly and labor-intensive ultra-gourmet snack cake which had to be marketed by beleaguered legions of nerdy admen under the thumb of, say, a tyrannical mullah-like CEO who was such a personal fiend for luxury-class chocolate that he was determined to push Felonies! into the US market no matter what the cost- or sales-projections, such that (in the proposed campaign\x{2019}s Story) Mister Squishy\x{2019}s advertisers had to force Team \x{394}y to manipulate and cajole Focus Groups into producing just the sort of quote unquote \x{2018}objective\x{2019} statistical data needed to greenlight the project and get Felonies! on the shelves, all in other words comprising just the sort of arch and tongue-in-cheek pseudo-behind-the-scenes Story designed to appeal to urban or younger consumers\x{2019} self-imagined savvy about marketing tactics and \x{2018}objective\x{2019} data and to flatter their sense that in this age of metastatic spin and trend and the complete commercialization of every last thing in their world they were unprecedentedly ad-savvy and discerning and canny and well nigh impossible to manipulate by any sort of clever multimillion-dollar marketing campaign. This was, as of the second quarter of 1995, a fairly bold and unconventional ad concept, Awad conceded modestly over Ron Mounce\x{2019}s cries of admiration and excitement, tossing (Mounce did) another cigarette over the catamaran\x{2019}s side to hiss and bob forever instead of sinking; and Awad further conceded that obviously an enormous amount of very carefully controlled research would have to be done and analyzed in all sorts of hypergeometric ways before they could even conceive of possibly jumping ship and starting their own R. Awad & Subordinates agency and pitching the idea to various farsighted companies\x{2014}certain of the US Internet\x{2019}s new startups, with their young and self-perceivedly renegade top management, looked like a promising market\x{2014}yes to various forward-looking companies that craved a fresh, edgy, cynicism-friendly corporate image, rather like Subaru\x{2019}s in the previous decade, or also for example FedEx and Wendy\x{2019}s in the era when Sedelmaier\x{2019}s own local crew had come out of nowhere to rule the industry. Whereas in point of fact none of what Robert Awad had brought his mentee four miles out onto the lake to whisper in Mounce\x{2019}s big pink ear was true or even in any sense real except as the agreed-upon cover narrative to be fed to select Team \x{394}y SRDs and Field Researchers as part of the control conditions for the really true Field experiment, which Alan Britton and Scott R. Laleman (there was really no \x{a7}543-structured Dy Associates; that little fiction was part of the cover narrative that Britton had fed to Bob Awad, who unbeknownst to him [= Awad] was already being gradually eased out in favor of Mrs. Lilley, who Laleman said was a whiz on both Systat and HTML, and on whom [= Darlene Lilley] Britton had had his eye ever since he\x{2019}d sent Awad around with covert instructions to behave in such a way as to test for faultlines in Field Team morale and the girl\x{2019}d shown such an extraordinary blend of personal stones and political aplomb in defusing Awad\x{2019}s stressors) so but yes which field experiment Britton and his mentee Laleman had been told by no less a personage than T. Cordell (\x{2018}Ted\x{2019}) Belt himself was designed to produce data on the way(s) certain received ideas of market research\x{2019}s purposes affected the way Field Researchers facilitated their Targeted Focus Groups\x{2019} GRDS phase and thus influenced the material outcome of the TFGs\x{2019} in camera deliberations and GRDSs. This internal experiment was the second stage of a campaign, Britton had later told Laleman over near-zeppelin-sized cigars in his inner office, to finally after all this time start bringing US marketing research into line with the realities of modern hard science, which had proved long ago (science had) that the presence of an observer affects any process and thus by clear implication that even the tiniest, most ephemeral details of a Field test\x{2019}s setup can impact the resultant data. The ultimate objective was to eliminate all unnecessary random variables in those Field tests, and of course by your most basic managerial Ockham\x{2019}s Razorblade this meant doing away as much as possible with the human element, the most obvious of these elements being the TFG facilitators, namely Team \x{394}y\x{2019}s nerdy beleaguered Field Researchers, who now, with the coming digital era of abundant data on whole markets\x{2019} preferences and patterns available via cybercommerce links, were soon going to be obsolete (the Field Researchers were) anyway, Alan Britton said. A passionate and assuasive rhetor, Britton liked to draw invisible little illustrations in the air with his cigar\x{2019}s glowing tip as he spoke. The mental image Scott Laleman associated with Alan Britton was of an enormous macadamia nut with a tiny little face painted on it. Laleman did unkind impersonations of Britton\x{2019}s speech and gestures for some of the boys in Technical Processing when he was sure Mr. B. was nowhere around. Because the whole thing from soup to nuts could soon be done via computer network, as Britton said he was sure he didn\x{2019}t have to sell Laleman on. Scott Laleman didn\x{2019}t really even like cigars. Meaning the coming www-dot-slash-hypercybercommerce thing, which there\x{2019}d already been countless professional seminars on and all of US marketing and advertising and related support industries were terribly excited about. But where most agencies still saw the coming www primarily as just a new, fifth venue for high-impact ads, part of your more forward-looking Reesemeyer Shannon Belt-type vision for the coming era involved finding ways to exploit cybercommerce\x{2019}s staggering research potential as well. Undisplayed little tracking codes could be designed to tag and follow each consumer\x{2019}s w interests and spending patterns\x{2014}here Laleman once again told Alan Britton what these algorithms were commonly called and averred that he personally knew how to design them; he of course did not tell Britton that he had already secretly helped design some very special little tracking algorithms for A.C. Romney- Jaswat & Assoc.\x{2019}s sirenic Chloe Jaswat and that two of these quote unquote Cookies were even at that moment nested deep within Team \x{394}y\x{2019}s SMTP/POP protocols. Britton said that Focus Groups and even n-sized test markets could be assembled abstractly via ANOVAs on consumers\x{2019} known patterns, that the TFG vetting was built right in\x{2014}as in e.g. who showed an interest? who bought the product or related products and from which cybervendor via which link thing?\x{2014}that not only would there be no voir dire and no archaic per diem expenses but even the unnecessary variable of consumers even knowing they were part of any sort of market test was excised, since a consumer\x{2019}s subjective awareness of his identity as a test subject instead of as a true desire-driven consumer had always been one of the distortions that market research swept under the rug because they had no way of quantifying subjective-identity-awareness on any known ANOVA. Focus Groups would go the way of the dodo and bison and art deco. Alan Britton had already had versions of this conversation with Scott Laleman several times; it was part of Britton\x{2019}s way of pumping himself up. Laleman had a vision of himself at a very large and expensive desk, Chloe Jaswat behind him kneading his trapezius muscles, while an enormous macadamia nut sat in a low chair before the desk and pleaded for a livable severance package. Sometimes, on the rare occasions when he masturbated, Laleman\x{2019}s fantasy involved a view of himself, shirtless and adorned with warpaint, standing with his boot on the chest of various supine men and howling upward at what lay outside the fantasy\x{2019}s frame but was probably the moon. That in other words, gesturing with the great red embrous tip, the exact same wonkish technology that Laleman\x{2019}s boys in Technical Processing now used to run analyses on the TFG paperwork could replace the paperwork. No more small-sample testing; no more \x{3b2}-risks or variance-error probabilities or 1 \x{2013} \x{3b1} confidence intervals or human elements or entropic noise. Once, in his junior year at Cornell U., Scott R. Laleman had been in an A.C.S. Dept. lab accident and had breathed halon gas, and for several days he went around campus with a rose clamped in his teeth, and tried to tango with anyone he saw, and insisted everybody all call him The Magnificent Enriqu\x{e9}, until several of his fraternity brothers finally all ganged up and knocked some sense back into him, but a lot of people thought he was still never quite the same after the halon thing. For now, in Belt and Britton\x{2019}s forward-looking vision, the market becomes its own test. Terrain = Map. Everything encoded. And no more facilitators to muddy the waters by impacting the tests in all the infinite ephemeral unnoticeable infinite ways human beings always kept impacting each other and muddying the waters. Team \x{394}y would become 100% tech-driven, abstract, its own Captured Shop. All they needed was some hard study data showing unequivocally that human facilitators made a difference, that variable elements of their appearance and manner and syntax and/or even small personal tics of individual personality or attitude affected the Focus Groups\x{2019} findings. Something on paper, with all the Systat t\x{2019}s crossed and i\x{2019}s dotted and even maybe yes a high-impact full-color graph\x{2014}for these were professional statisticians, after all, the Field Researchers; they knew the numbers didn\x{2019}t lie; if they saw that the data entailed their own subtraction they\x{2019}d go quietly, some probably even offering to resign, for the good of the Team. Plus then also Laleman pointed out that the study data\x{2019}d also come in handy if some of them tried to fight it or squeeze Team \x{394}y for a better severance by threatening some kind of bullshit WT suit. He could almost feel the texture of Mr. B.\x{2019}s sternum under his heel. Not to mention (said Britton, who sometimes then held the cigar like a dart and jabbed it at the air when stipulating or refining a point) that not all would need to go. The Field men. That some could be kept. Transferred. Retrained to work the machines, to follow the Cookies and run the Systat codes and sit there while it all compiled. The rest would have to go. It was a rough business; Darwin\x{2019}s tagline still fit. Britton sometimes addressed Scott Laleman as Laddie or Boyo, but of course never once as The Magnificent Enriqu\x{e9}. Mr. B. had absolutely 0% knowledge of what and who Scott R. Laleman really was inside, as an individual, with a very special and above-average destiny, Laleman felt. He had practiced his smile a great deal, both with and w/o rose. Britton said that the sub rosa experiments\x{2019} stressors would, as always in nature and hard science, determine survival. Fitness. As in who fit the new pattern. Versus who made too much difference, see, and where, when push came to shove there in camera. This was all artful bullshit. Britton poked glowing holes in the air above the desk. To see, he said he meant, how the facilitators reacted to unplanned stimuli, how they responded to their Focus Groups\x{2019} own reactions. All they needed were the stressors. Nested, high-impact stimuli. Shake them up. Rattle the cage, he said, watch what fell out. This was all really what was known in the game as Giving Someone Enough Rope. The big man leaned back, his smile both warm and expectant. Inviting the Boyo he\x{2019}d chosen to mentor to brainstorm with him on some possible stressors right here and now. As in with Britton himself, to flesh out the needed tests. No time like now. Scott Laleman felt a kind of vague latent dread as the big man made a show of putting out his Fuente. A chance to step up to the plate with the big dogs, get a taste of real frontlines creative action. Right here and now. A chance for Dy\x{2019}s golden boy to strut his stuff. Impress the boss. Run something up the rampant pole. Anything at all. Spontaneous flow. To brainstorm. The trick was not to think or edit, just let it all fly. The big man counted down from <<five|9c:1>> and put one hand to his ear and came down with the other hand to point at Scott Laleman as if to signal You\x{2019}re On the Air, his eyes now two nailheads and tiny mouth turned down. The finger had something dark\x{2019}s remains in the rim around its nail. Laleman sat there smiling at it, his mind a great flat blank white screen.",

            "The site of the original trauma was 4th grade Civics class, second period, at R. B. Hayes Primary School here in Columbus. A very long time ago now. The class had a required seating chart, and all of us had assigned desks, which were bolted to the floor in orderly rows. It was <<1960|9d>>, a time of fervent and somewhat unreflective patriotism. It was a time that is now often referred to as a somewhat more innocent time. Civics was a state-mandated class on the Constitution, the U.S. presidents, and the branches of government. In the second quarter, we had actually built papier m\x{e2}ch\x{e9} models of the branches of government, with various tracks and paths between them, to illustrate the balance of powers that the Founding Fathers had built into the federal system. I had fashioned the Doric columns of the Judicial Branch out of the cardboard cylinders inside rolls of Coronet paper towels, which was our mother\x{2019}s preferred brand. It was during the cold and seemingly endless period in March when our regular Civics teacher was absent that we had our Constitution unit and perused the American Constitution and its various drafts and amendments under the supervision of Mr. Richard A.

            "In the midst of writing on the chalkboard, illustrating that the phrase due process of law appears identically in both the Vth and XIVth Amendments, Mr. Richard Allen Johnson inadvertently inserted something else in the phrase, as well\x{2014}the capital word KILL. Ellen Morrison, Sanjay Rabindranath, and some other of the class\x{2019}s more diligent pupils, copying down word for word what Mr. Johnson was putting up on the chalkboard, discovered that they had written due process KILL of law and that that, too, was what was on the chalkboard, which Mr. Johnson had stepped one or two steps back from and was looking up in evident puzzlement at what was written there. At least, many classmates later reported this as puzzlement because of the way, even though the sub was facing the chalkboard and thus had his back to the class, his head was now cocked curiously over to the side, not unlike a dog\x{2019}s when it hears a certain type of high sound, and he remained that way for a moment before shaking his head slightly as if shaking off some confusion and, using the board\x{2019}s eraser to erase the KILL of law, replaced it with the correct of law. As usual, Chris DeMatteis had his head on his desk in the second row and was asleep, because his father and older brothers ran a newspaper delivery service for newsstands and retail vendors covering over a third of the city early in the morning, and often they made DeMatteis get up as early as <<3:00 in the morning|2a>> to pitch in and help, even if it was a school day, and DeMatteis often fell asleep in his classes, especially if it was a sub.

Hayes knew very little about in terms of the realities of her personal life or history (both I and Tim Applewhite had been placed in Miss Clennon\x{2019}s slow readers class with Blemm in 3rd grade, although Applewhite later got bused to a special school in Minerva Park, as he just could not read at all\x{2014}he literally was a slow reader, whereas Blemm and I were not), rarely ever even took her book or pencils out in class, and always sat looking at the desktop in a withdrawn or sullen manner, and never paid attention or completed any of her assignments, until the school authorities reached a point where they became so concerned that they began making plans to have Blemm transferred to Minerva Park as well, at which time she would abruptly begin completing her assignments and being involved in classroom goings on. Then, as soon as the administrative heat was off, she would once more revert to just sitting there staring at her desktop or biting dead skin off of the sides of her thumbnail very slowly for the whole class period. She had also been known to eat paste. Everyone was a little afraid of her. At the same time, Frankie Caldwell, who now works in Dayton as a quality control inspector for Uniroyal, had his head down and was drawing something on his theme paper with great precision and intensity. Alison Standish (who later moved away) was absent again. Meanwhile, the Xth Amendment (the first I-IX are what comprise the familiar Bill of Rights, although the Xth Amendment was adopted simultaneously in 1791) contains the phrase The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, and so forth, which Mr. Johnson, while at the board, according to Ellen Morrison and every other pupil taking notes, wrote as The powers not delegated KILL to the United States THEM by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it KILL THEM to the States, at which time there was again, evidently, another long classroom silence, during which the pupils all began looking at one another while Mr. Johnson stood with his back to the room at the board with his hand with the yellow chalk hanging at his side and his head again cocked to the side as if he were having trouble hearing or understanding something, without turning around or saying anything, before picking up the board\x{2019}s eraser once again and trying to continue the lesson on Amendments X and XIII as though nothing unusual had taken place. According to Mandy Blemm, by this time the room was deathly quiet, and many of the pupils had an uneasy expression on their face as they dutifully crossed out the THEM and KILL THEM that Mr. Johnson had initially inserted in the quotation. At this same time, in the window, a terrible series of events was transpiring for Ruth Simmons\x{2019} father, who in a diagonal series of panels in the protective mesh was stoically and uncomplainingly clearing the long black driveway of snow with the enormous Snow Boy brand device that the owner\x{2019}s company engineers had invented in his R&D laboratories, which was why he was now so wealthy. This was just the beginning of the era of power lawnmowers and snow removers for ordinary consumers. Meanwhile, Mrs. Marjorie Simmons\x{2019} car was stuck in the street\x{2019}s heavy snow and was idling with the windows so fogged up that the observer had no idea what she might be doing in there, and Cuffie and the hardbitten feral dogs were presumably still traversing the lengthy industrial pipe that ran from the Scioto River to a large industrial-chemical factory on Olentangy River Road, as for several consecutive panels there are depictions of the cement exterior of the pipe but no visible activity or anything exiting the pipe at either end except for the ominous orange trickle into the river. The whole Civics classroom had become very quiet. The total number of words on the chalkboard after the erasures was either 104 or 121, depending on whether one counted Roman numerals as words or not. If asked, I could probably have told you the total number of letters, the most and the least used letters (in the latter case, a tie), as well as a number of different statistical functions by which the relative frequency of different letters\x{2019} appearance could be quantified, although I would not have put any of these data in this way, nor was I even quite aware that I could. The facts about the words were simply there, much the way a knowledge of how your tummy feels and where your arms are are there regardless of whether you\x{2019}re paying attention to these parts or not. They were simply part of the whole peripheral environment in which I sat. What I was, however, wholly aware of was that I was becoming more and more disturbed by the graphic narrative that was unfolding, square by square, in the window. While compelling and diverting, few of the window\x{2019}s narratives were ever gruesome or unpleasant. Most had upbeat\x{2014}if somewhat naive and childish\x{2014}themes. And it was only on days when there was enough time before the bell rang for the end of Civics that I got to see how they ended. Some carried over from the prior day, but as a practical matter this was rare, as it was difficult to hold all the unfolding details in mind for that long.",

            "For my own part, I had begun having nightmares about the reality of adult life as early as perhaps age seven. I knew, even then, that the dreams involved my father\x{2019}s life and job and the way he looked when he returned home from work at the end of the day. His arrival was always between <<5:42|2>> and <<5:45|2>>, and it was usually I who was the first to see him come through the front door. What occurred was almost choreographic in its routine. He came in already turning in order to press the door closed behind him. He removed his hat and topcoat and hung the coat in the foyer closet; he clawed his necktie loose with two fingers, took the green rubber band off of the Dispatch, entered the living room, greeted my brother, and sat down with the newspaper to wait for my mother to bring him a highball. The nightmares themselves always opened with a wide angle view of a number of men at desks in rows in a large, brightly lit room or hall. The desks were arranged in precise rows and columns like the desks of an R. B. Hayes classroom, but these were all more like the large, grey steel desks that the teachers had at the front of the room, and there were many, many more of them, perhaps 100 or more, each occupied by a man in suit and tie. If there were windows, I do not remember noticing them. Some of the men were older than others, but they were all obviously adults\x{2014}people who drove, and applied for insurance coverage, and had highballs while they read the paper before dinner. The nightmare\x{2019}s room was at least the size of a soccer or flag football field; it was utterly silent and had a large clock on each wall. It was also very bright. In the foyer, turning from the front door while his left hand rose to remove his hat, my father\x{2019}s eyes appeared lightless and dead, empty of everything we associated with his real persona. He was a kind, decent, ordinary looking man. His voice was deeply pitched but not resonant. Softspoken, he had a sense of humor that kept his natural reserve from seeming remote or aloof. Even when my brother and I were small, we were aware that he spent more time with us and took the trouble to show us that we were important to him a good deal more than most fathers of that era did. (It was many years before I had any real idea of how our mother felt about him.) The foyer was directly off of the living room, where the piano was, and at that time, I often read or played with my trucks outside of kicking range beneath the piano while my brother practiced his Hanons, and I was often the first to register the sound of my father\x{2019}s key in the front door. It took only four steps and a brief sockslide into the foyer to be able to see him first as he entered on a wave of outside air. I remember the foyer as dim and cold and smelling of the coat closet, the bulk of which was filled with my mother\x{2019}s different coats and matching gloves. The front door was heavy and difficult to open and close, as if the foyer were somehow pressurized. The door had a small, diamond-shaped window in the center, though we later moved before I was ever tall enough to see out of it. He had to put his side into the door somewhat in order to make it close all the way, and I would not see his face until he turned to remove his hat and coat, but I can recall that the angle of his shoulders as he leaned into the door had the same quality as his eyes. I could not convey this quality now and most assuredly couldn\x{2019}t have then, but I know that it helped inform the nightmares. His face was not at all like this on weekends off. It is in hindsight that I believe the dreams to have been about adult life. At the time, I knew only their terror\x{2014}much of the difficulty they complained of in getting me to lie down and go to sleep at night was due to these dreams. Nor could it always have been dusk at <<5:42|2>>, though that is what I recall its being, and the inrush of outside air he brought with him as cold, and scented with burnt leaves and the sad way the street smelled at twilight, when all of the houses became the same color and all of their porch lights came on like bulwarks against something without name. His eyes when he turned from the door didn\x{2019}t scare me, but the feeling was somehow related to being scared. Often I still had a truck in my hand. His hat went on the hatrack, his coat shouldered out of, then the coat was folded over his left arm, the closet opened with his right hand, the coat transferred to that hand while the third wooden coathanger from the left is removed with his left hand. There was something about this routine that cast shadows deep down in parts of me I could not access on my own. I knew something of boredom by then, of course, at Hayes, and Riverside, or on Sunday afternoons when there was nothing to do\x{2014}the fidgety type of childhood boredom that is more like worry than despair. But I do not believe I consciously connected the way my father looked at night with the far different and deeper, soul-level boredom of his job, which I knew was actuarial because in 2nd grade everyone in Mrs. Claymore\x{2019}s homeroom had had to give a short presentation on what our father\x{2019}s profession was. I knew that insurance was protection that adults applied for in case of risk, and I knew that it had numbers in it because of the documents that were visible in his briefcase when I got to pop its latches and open it for him, and my brother and I had had the building that housed the insurance company\x{2019}s HQ and my father\x{2019}s tiny window in its face pointed out to us by our mother from the car, but the actual specifics of his job were always vague. And they remained so for many years. Looking back, I suspect that there was something of a cover-your-eyes and stop-your-ears quality to my lack of curiosity about just what my father had to do all day. I can remember certain exciting narrative tableaux based around the competitive, almost primitive connotations of the word breadwinner, which had been Mrs. Claymore\x{2019}s blanket term for our fathers\x{2019} occupations. But I do not believe I knew or could even imagine, as a child, that for almost 30 years of 51 weeks a year my father sat all day at a metal desk in a silent, fluorescent lit room, reading forms and making calculations and filling out further forms on the results of those calculations, breaking only occasionally to answer his telephone or meet with other actuaries in other bright, quiet rooms. With only a small and sunless north window that looked out on other small office windows in other grey buildings. The nightmares were vivid and powerful, but they were not the kind from which you wake up crying out and then have to try to explain to your mother when she comes what the dream was about so that she could reassure you that there was nothing like what you just dreamed in the real world. I knew that he liked to have music or a lively radio program on and audible all of the time at home, or to hear my brother practicing while he read the Dispatch before dinner, but I am certain I did not then connect this with the overwhelming silence he sat in all day. I did not know that our mother\x{2019}s making his lunch was one of the keystones of their marriage contract, or that in mild weather he took his lunch down in the elevator and ate it sitting on a backless stone bench that faced a small square of grass with two trees and an abstract public sculpture, and that on many mornings he steered by these 30 minutes outdoors the way mariners out of sight of land use stars. My father died of a coronary when I was sixteen, and I can acknowledge, despite the obvious shock and loss, that his passing was less hard to bear than much of what I learned about his life when he was gone. For instance, it was very important to my mother that my father\x{2019}s burial plot be somewhere where there were at least a few trees in view; and given the logistics of the cemetery and the details of the mortuary contract he\x{2019}d prepared for them both, this caused a great deal of trouble and expense at a difficult time, which neither my brother nor I saw the point of until years later when we learned about his weekdays and the bench where he liked to eat his lunch. At Miranda\x{2019}s suggestion, I made a point, one spring, of visiting the site where his little square of grass and trees had been. The area had been refashioned into one of the small and largely unutilized downtown parks that were characteristic of the New Columbus renewal programs of the early \x{2019}80s, in which there were no longer grass or beech trees but a small, modern children\x{2019}s play area, with wood chips instead of sand and a jungle gym made entirely of recycled tires. There is also a swingset, whose two empty swings moved back and forth at different rates in the wind the whole time I sat there. For a time in my early adulthood, I had periods of imagining my father sitting on the bench year after year, chewing, and looking at that carved out square of something green, always knowing exactly how much time was left for lunch without taking his watch out. Sadder still was trying to imagine what he thought about as he sat there, imagining him perhaps thinking about us, our faces when he got home or the way we smelled at night after baths when he came in to kiss us on the top of the head\x{2014}but the truth is that I have no idea what he thought about, what his internal life might have been like. And that were he alive I still would not know. Or trying (which Miranda feels was saddest of all) to imagine what words he might have used to describe his job and the square and two trees to my mother. I knew my father well enough to know it could not have been direct\x{2014}I am certain he never sat down or lay beside her and spoke as such about lunch on the bench and the twin sickly trees that in the fall drew swarms of migrating starlings, appearing en masse more like bees than birds as they swarmed in and weighed down the elms\x{2019} or buckeyes\x{2019} limbs and filled the mind with sound before rising again in a great mass to spread and contract like a great flexing hand against the downtown sky. Trying thus to imagine remarks and attitudes and tiny half anecdotes that over time conveyed enough to her that she would go through hell and back to have his grave site moved to the premium areas nearer the front gate and its little stand of blue pines. It was not quite a nightmare proper, but neither was it a daydream or fancy. It came when I had been in bed for a time and was beginning to fall asleep but only partway there\x{2014}the part of the featherfall into sleep in which whatever lines of thought you\x{2019}ve been pursuing begin now to become surreal around the edges, and then at some point the thoughts themselves are replaced by images and concrete pictures and scenes. You move, gradually, from merely thinking about something to experiencing it as really there, unfolding, a story or world you are part of, although at the same time enough of you remains awake to be able to discern on some level that what you are experiencing does not quite make sense, that you are on some cusp or edge of true dreaming. Even now, as an adult, I still can consciously recognize that I am starting to fall asleep when my abstract thoughts turn into actual pictures and tiny films, ones whose logic and associations are ever so slightly off\x{2014}and yet I am always aware of this, of the illogic and my reactions to it. The dream was of a large room full of men in suits and ties seated at rows of great grey desks, bent forward over the papers on their desks, motionless, silent, in a monochrome room or hall under long banks of high lumen fluorescents, the men\x{2019}s faces puffy and seamed with adult tension and wear and appearing to hang slightly loose, the way someone\x{2019}s face can go flaccid and loose when he seems to be staring at something without really seeing it. I acknowledge that I could never convey just what was so dreadful about this tableau of a bright, utterly silent room full of men immersed in rote work. It was the type of nightmare whose terror is less about what you see than about the feeling you have in your lower chest about what you\x{2019}re seeing. Some of the men wore glasses; there were a few small, neatly trimmed mustaches. Some had grey or thinning hair or the large, dark, complexly textured bags beneath their eyes that both our father and Uncle Gerald had. Some of the younger men had wider lapels; most did not. Part of the terror of the dream\x{2019}s wide angle perspective was that the men in the room appeared as both individuals and a great anonymous mass. There were at least 20 or 30 rows of a dozen desks each, each with a blotter and desklamp and file folders with papers in them and a man in a straightback chair behind the desk, each man with a subtly different style or pattern of necktie and his own slightly distinctive way of sitting and positioning his arms and inclining his head, some feeling at their jaw or forehead or the crease of their tie, or biting dead skin from around their thumbnail, or tracing along their lower lip with their pencil\x{2019}s eraser or pen\x{2019}s metal cap. You could tell that the particular styles of sitting and the small, absent habits that individualized them had evolved over years or even decades of sitting like this over their job\x{2019}s work every day, moving purposefully only once in a while to turn a stapled page, or to move a loose page from the left side of an open file folder to the right side, or to close one file folder and slide it a few inches away and then pull another file folder to themselves and open it, gazing down into it as if they were at some terrible height and the documents were the ground far below. If my brother dreamed, we certainly never heard about it. The men\x{2019}s expressions were somehow at once stuporous and anxious, enervated and keyed up\x{2014}not so much fighting the urge to fidget as appearing to have long ago surrendered whatever hope or expectation causes one to fidget. A few of the chairs\x{2019} seat portions had cushions made of corduroy or serge, one or two of them brightly colored and edged with fringe in such a way that you could tell they had been handmade by a loved one and given as a gift, perhaps for a birthday, and for some reason this detail was the worst of all. The dream\x{2019}s bright room was death, I could feel it\x{2014}but not in any way you could convey or explain to my mother if I cried out in fear and she hurried in. And the idea of ever trying to tell my father about the dream was\x{2014}even later, after it had vanished as abruptly as the problem with reading\x{2014}unthinkable. The feeling of telling him about it would have been like coming to our Aunt Tina, one of my mother\x{2019}s sisters (who, among her other crosses to bear, had been born with a cleft palate that operations had not much been able to help, besides also having a congenital lung condition), and pointing out the cleft palate to Aunt Tina and asking her how she felt about it and how her life had been affected by it, at which even imagining the look that would come into her eyes was unthinkable. The overall feeling was that these colorless, empty-eyed, long suffering faces were the face of some death that awaited me long before I stopped walking around. Then, when real sleep descended, it becomes a real dream, and I lost the perspective of someone merely looking at the scene and am in it\x{2014}the lens of perspective pulls suddenly back, and I am one of them, one part of the mass of grey faced men stifling coughs and feeling at their teeth with their tongues and folding the edges of papers down into complex accordion creases and then smoothing them carefully out once more before replacing them in their assigned file folders. And the dream\x{2019}s perspective\x{2019}s view slowly moves further and further in until it is primarily me in view, in close-up, with a handful of other desks\x{2019} men\x{2019}s faces and upper bodies framing me, and the backs of a few photos\x{2019} frames and either an adding machine or a telephone at the edge of the desk (mine is also one of the chairs with a handmade cushion). As I can recall it now, in the dream I look neither like my father nor my real self. I have very little hair, and what I do have is wet combed carefully around the sides, and a small Vandyke or maybe goatee, and my face, which is angled downwards at the desktop in concentration, looks as if it has spent the last 20 years pressed hard against something unyielding. And at a certain point in the interval, in the middle of removing a paper clip or opening a desk drawer (there is no sound), I look up and into the lens of the dream\x{2019}s perspective and stare back at myself, but without any sign of recognition on my face, nor of happiness or fright or despair or appeal\x{2014}the eyes are flat and opaque, and only mine in the way that a very old album\x{2019}s photo of you as a child in a setting you have no memory of is nevertheless you\x{2014}and in the dream, as our eyes meet, it is impossible to know what the adult me is seeing or how I am reacting or if there is anything in there at all.",

            "There was a basic logical paradox that I called the \x{2018}fraudulence paradox\x{2019} that I had discovered more or less on my own while taking a mathematical logic course in school. I remember this as being a huge undergrad lecture course that met twice a week in an auditorium with the professor up on stage and on Fridays in smaller discussion sections led by a graduate assistant whose whole life seemed to be mathematical logic. (Plus all you had to do to ace the class was sit down with the assigned textbook that the prof was the editor of and memorize the different modes of argument and normal forms and axioms of first-order quantification, meaning the course was as clean and mechanical as logic itself in that if you put in the time and effort, out popped the good grade at the other end. We only got to paradoxes like the Berry and Russell Paradoxes and the incompleteness theorem at the very end of the term, they weren\x{2019}t on the final.) The fraudulence paradox was that the more time and effort you put into trying to appear impressive or attractive to other people, the less impressive or attractive you felt inside\x{2014}you were a fraud. And the more of a fraud you felt like, the harder you tried to convey an impressive or likable image of yourself so that other people wouldn\x{2019}t find out what a hollow, fraudulent person you really were. Logically, you would think that the moment a supposedly intelligent nineteen-year-old became aware of this paradox, he\x{2019}d stop being a fraud and just settle for being himself (whatever that was) because he\x{2019}d figured out that being a fraud was a vicious infinite regress that ultimately resulted in being frightened, lonely, alienated, etc. But here was the other, higher-order paradox, which didn\x{2019}t even have a form or name\x{2014}I didn\x{2019}t, I couldn\x{2019}t. Discovering the first paradox at age nineteen just brought home to me in spades what an empty, fraudulent person I\x{2019}d basically been ever since at least the time I was four and lied to my stepdad because I\x{2019}d realized somehow right in the middle of his asking me if I\x{2019}d broken the bowl that if I said I did it but \x{2018}confessed\x{2019} it in a sort of clumsy, implausible way, then he wouldn\x{2019}t believe me and would instead believe that my sister Fern, who\x{2019}s my stepparents\x{2019} biological daughter, was the one who\x{2019}d actually broken the antique Moser glass bowl that my stepmom had inherited from her biological grandmother and totally loved, plus it would lead or induce him to see me as a kind, good stepbrother who was so anxious to keep Fern (whom I really did like) from getting in trouble that I\x{2019}d be willing to lie and take the punishment for it for her. I\x{2019}m not explaining this very well. I was only four, for one thing, and the realization didn\x{2019}t hit me in words the way I just now put it, but rather more in terms of feelings and associations and certain mental flashes of my stepparents\x{2019} faces with various expressions on them. But it happened that fast, at only <<four|9c:1>>, that I figured out how to create a certain impression by knowing what effect I\x{2019}d produce in my stepdad by implausibly \x{2018}confessing\x{2019} that I\x{2019}d punched Fern in the arm and stolen her Hula Hoop and had run all the way downstairs with it and started Hula-Hooping in the dining room right by the sideboard with all my stepmom\x{2019}s antique glassware and figurines on it, while Fern, forgetting all about her arm and hoop because of her concern over the bowl and other glassware, came running downstairs shouting after me, reminding me about how important the rule was that we weren\x{2019}t supposed to play in the dining room. . . . Meaning that by lying in such a deliberately unconvincing way I could actually get everything that a direct lie would supposedly get me, plus look noble and self-sacrificing, plus also make my stepparents feel good because they always tended to feel good when one of their kids did something that showed character, because it\x{2019}s the sort of thing they couldn\x{2019}t really help but see as reflecting favorably on them as shapers of their kids\x{2019} character. I\x{2019}m putting all this in such a long, rushing, clumsy way to try to convey the way I remember it suddenly hit me, looking up at my stepfather\x{2019}s big kindly face as he held two of the larger pieces of the Moser bowl and tried to look angrier than he really felt. (He had always thought the more expensive pieces ought to be kept secure in storage somewhere, whereas my stepmom\x{2019}s view was more like what was the point of having nice things if you didn\x{2019}t have them out where people could enjoy them.) How to appear a certain way and get him to think a certain thing hit me just that fast. Keep in mind I was only around four. And I can\x{2019}t pretend it felt bad, realizing it\x{2014}the truth is it felt great. I felt powerful, smart. It felt a little like looking at part of a puzzle you\x{2019}re doing and you\x{2019}ve got a piece in your hand and you can\x{2019}t see where in the larger puzzle it\x{2019}s supposed to go or how to make it fit, looking at all the holes, and then all of a sudden in a flash you see, for no reason right then you could point to or explain to anyone, that if you turn the piece this one certain way it will fit, and it does, and maybe the best way to put it is that in that one tiny instant you feel suddenly connected to something larger and much more of the complete picture the same way the piece is. The only part I\x{2019}d neglected to anticipate was Fern\x{2019}s reaction to getting blamed for the bowl, and punished, and then punished even worse when she continued to deny that she\x{2019}d been the one playing around in the dining room, and my stepparents\x{2019} position was that they were even more upset and disappointed about her lying than they were about the bowl, which they said was just a material object and not ultimately important in the larger scheme of things. (My stepparents spoke this way, they were people of high ideals and values, humanists. Their big ideal was total honesty in all the family\x{2019}s relationships, and lying was the worst, most disappointing infraction you could commit, in their view as parents. They tended to discipline Fern a little more firmly than they did me, by the way, but this too was an extension of their values. They were concerned about being fair and having me be able to feel that I was just as much their real child as Fern was, so that I\x{2019}d feel maximally secure and loved, and sometimes this concern with fairness caused them to bend a little too far over backward when it came to discipline.) So that Fern, then, got regarded as being a liar when she was not, and that must have hurt her way more than the actual punishment did. She was only five at the time. It\x{2019}s horrible to be regarded as a fraud or to believe that people think you\x{2019}re a fraud or liar. It\x{2019}s possibly one of the worst feelings in the world. And even though I haven\x{2019}t really had any direct experience with it, I\x{2019}m sure it must be doubly horrible when you were actually telling the truth and they didn\x{2019}t believe you. I don\x{2019}t think Fern ever quite got over that episode, although the two of us never talked about it afterward except for one sort of cryptic remark she made over her shoulder once when we were both in high school and having an argument about something and Fern was storming out of the house. She was sort of a classically troubled adolescent\x{2014}smoking, makeup, mediocre grades, dating older guys, etc.\x{2014}whereas I was the family\x{2019}s fair-haired boy and had a killer G.P.A. and played varsity ball, etc. One way to put it is that I looked and acted much better on the surface then than Fern did, although she eventually settled down and ended up going on to college and is now doing OK. She\x{2019}s also one of the funniest people on earth, with a very dry, subtle sense of humor\x{2014}I like her a lot. The point being that that was the start of my being a fraud, although it\x{2019}s not as if the broken-bowl episode was somehow the origin or cause of my fraudulence or some kind of childhood trauma that I\x{2019}d never gotten over and had to go into analysis to work out. The fraud part of me was always there, just as the puzzle piece, objectively speaking, is a true piece of the puzzle even before you see how it fits. For a while I thought that possibly one or the other of my biological parents had been frauds or had carried some type of fraud gene or something and that I had inherited it, but that was a dead end, there was no way to know. And even if I did, what difference would it make? I was still a fraud, it was still my own unhappiness that I had to deal with.",

            "Here\x{2019}s the basic Berry paradox, by the way, if you might want an example of why logicians with incredible firepower can devote their whole lives to solving these things and still end up beating their heads against the wall. This one has to do with big numbers\x{2014}meaning really big, past a trillion, <<past ten|9:0>> to the trillion to the trillion, way up there. When you get way up there, it takes a while even to describe numbers this big in words. \x{2018}The quantity one trillion, four hundred and three billion to the trillionth power\x{2019} takes twenty syllables to describe, for example. You get the idea. Now, even higher up there in these huge, cosmic-scale numbers, imagine now the very smallest number that can\x{2019}t be described in under twenty-two syllables. The paradox is that the very smallest number that can\x{2019}t be described in under twenty-two syllables, which of course is itself a description of this number, only has twenty-one syllables in it, which of course is under twenty-two syllables. So now what are you supposed to do?",

            "Now we\x{2019}re getting to the part where I actually kill myself. This occurred at <<9:17 PM|2a>> on August 19, 1991, if you want the time fixed precisely. Plus I\x{2019}ll spare you most of the last couple hours\x{2019} preparations and back-and-forth conflict and dithering, which there was a lot of. Suicide runs so counter to so many hardwired instincts and drives that nobody in his right mind goes through with it without going through a great deal of internal back-and-forth, intervals of almost changing your mind, etc. The German logician Kant was right in this respect, human beings are all pretty much identical in terms of our hardwiring. Although we are seldom conscious of it, we are all basically just instruments or expressions of our evolutionary drives, which are themselves the expressions of forces that are infinitely larger and more important than we are. (Although actually being conscious of this is a whole different matter.) So I won\x{2019}t really even try to describe the several different times that day when I sat in my living room and had a furious mental back-and-forth about whether to actually go through with it. For one thing, it was intensely mental and would take an enormous amount of time to put into words, plus it would come off as somewhat clich\x{e9} or banal in the sense that many of the thoughts and associations were basically the same sorts of generic things that almost anyone who\x{2019}s confronting imminent death will end up thinking. As in, \x{2018}This is the last time I will ever tie my shoe,\x{2019} \x{2018}This is the last time I will look at this rubber tree on top of the stereo cabinet,\x{2019} \x{2018}How delicious this lungful of air right here tastes,\x{2019} \x{2018}This is the last glass of milk I\x{2019}ll ever drink,\x{2019} \x{2018}What a totally priceless gift this totally ordinary sight of the wind picking trees\x{2019} branches up and moving them around is.\x{2019} Or, \x{2018}I will never again hear the plaintive sound of the fridge going on in the kitchen\x{2019} (the kitchen and breakfast nook are right off my living room), etc. Or, \x{2018}I won\x{2019}t see the sun come up tomorrow or watch the bedroom gradually undim and resolve, etc.,\x{2019} and at the same time trying to summon the memory of the exact way the sun comes up over the humid fields and the wet-looking I-55 ramp that lay due east of my bedroom\x{2019}s sliding glass door in the morning. It had been a hot, wet August, and if I went through with killing myself I wouldn\x{2019}t ever get to feel the incremental cooling and drying that starts here around mid-September, or to see the leaves turn or hear them rustle along the edge of the courtyard outside S. & C.\x{2019}s floor of the building on S. Dearborn, or see snow or put a shovel and bag of sand in the trunk, or bite into a perfectly ripe, ungrainy pear, or put a piece of toilet paper on a shaving cut. Etc. If I went in and went to the bathroom and brushed my teeth it would be the last time I did those things. I sat there and thought about that, looking at the rubber tree. Everything seemed to tremble a little, the way things reflected in water will tremble. I watched the sun begin to drop down over the townhouse developments going up south of Darien\x{2019}s corporation limit on Lily Cache Rd. and realized that I would never see the newest homes\x{2019} construction and landscaping completed, or that the homes\x{2019} white insulation wrap with the trade name TYVEK all over it flapping in all the wind out here would one day have vinyl siding or plate brick and color-coordinated shutters over it and I wouldn\x{2019}t see this happen or be able to drive by and know what was actually written there under all the nice exteriors. Or the breakfast nook window\x{2019}s view of the big farms\x{2019} fields next to my development, with the plowed furrows all parallel so that if I lean and line their lines up just right they seem to all rush together toward the horizon as if shot out of something huge. You get the idea. Basically I was in that state in which a man realizes that everything he sees will outlast him. As a verbal construction I know that\x{2019}s a clich\x{e9}. As a state in which to actually be, though, it\x{2019}s something else, believe me. Where now every movement takes on a kind of ceremonial aspect. The very sacredness of the world as seen (the same kind of state Dr. G. will try to describe with analogies to oceans and whitecaps and trees, you might recall I mentioned this already). This is literally about one one-trillionth of the various thoughts and internal experiences I underwent in those last few hours, and I\x{2019}ll spare both of us recounting any more, since I\x{2019}m aware it ends up seeming somewhat lame. Which in fact it wasn\x{2019}t, but I won\x{2019}t pretend it was fully authentic or genuine, either. A part of me was still calculating, performing\x{2014}and this was part of the ceremonial quality of that last afternoon. Even as I wrote my note to Fern, for instance, expressing sentiments and regrets that were real, a part of me was noticing what a fine and sincere note it was, and anticipating the effect on Fern of this or that heartfelt phrase, while yet another part was observing the whole scene of a man in a dress shirt and no tie sitting at his breakfast nook writing a heartfelt note on his last afternoon alive, the blondwood table\x{2019}s surface trembling with sunlight and the man\x{2019}s hand steady and face both haunted by regret and ennobled by resolve, this part of me sort of hovering above and just to the left of myself, evaluating the scene, and thinking what a fine and genuine-seeming performance in a drama it would make if only we all had not already been subject to countless scenes just like it in dramas ever since we first saw a movie or read a book, which somehow entailed that real scenes like the one of my suicide note were now compelling and genuine only to their participants, and to anyone else would come off as banal and even somewhat cheesy or maudlin, which is somewhat paradoxical when you consider\x{2014}as I did, sitting there at the breakfast nook\x{2014}that the reason scenes like this will seem stale or manipulative to an audience is that we\x{2019}ve already seen so many of them in dramas, and yet the reason we\x{2019}ve seen so many of them in dramas is that the scenes really are dramatic and compelling and let people communicate very deep, complicated emotional realities that are almost impossible to articulate in any other way, and at the same time still another facet or part of me realizing that from this perspective my own basic problem was that at an early age I\x{2019}d somehow chosen to cast my lot with my life\x{2019}s drama\x{2019}s supposed audience instead of with the drama itself, and that I even now was watching and gauging my supposed performance\x{2019}s quality and probable effects, and thus was in the final analysis the very same manipulative fraud writing the note to Fern that I had been throughout the life that had brought me to this climactic scene of writing and signing it and addressing the envelope and affixing postage and putting the envelope in my shirt pocket (totally conscious of the resonance of its resting there, next to my heart, in the scene), planning to drop it in a mailbox on the way out to Lily Cache Rd. and the bridge abutment into which I planned to drive my car at speeds sufficient to displace the whole front end and impale me on the steering wheel and instantly kill me. Self-loathing is not the same thing as being into pain or a lingering death, if I was going to do it I wanted it instant.",

            "Also, by this point in time, our routine (or, \x{2018}ritual\x{2019}) for preparing to retire and go to sleep in the bedroom had also often become almost indescribably tense and unpleasant.

            "In Chicago, O Verily Productions operated out of north side facilities just a few blocks down Addison from WGN\x{2019}s great uplink tower, past which landmark Skip Atwater\x{2019}s rented Cavalier yawed and squeaked\x{2014}pulling severely to the right from a bent transaxle that had worn one tire nearly bald on the trip up Interstate 65, and with the driver\x{2019}s side door bowed dramatically out from inside as if from some horrific series of impacts, about which neither Hertz Inc. nor Style\x{2019}s Accounting staff would be pleased at all\x{2014}on 2 July at <<10:10 AM|2a>>, nearly two hours late, because it had turned out that any highway speed over 45 mph produced a sound like a great deal of loose change rattling around inside the vehicle\x{2019}s engine.",

            "Ellen Bactrian had them out and arranged on Mrs. Anger\x{2019}s desk when the executive intern came in carrying her bicycle at <<7:10|2>>. Three of the pieces were upright, one more base intensive and kind of spread out. Each sat on its own blank sheet of typing paper; it was the 20 pound rag bond used for executive letters and memos at Style. The pieces were in no particular order. The two editorial interns were in matching chairs in the room\x{2019}s two far corners. Ellen Bactrian had short dark blond hair and an arc of studs along the rim of one ear that every so often caught the light just right and flashed. On the wall near the office door, a large photorealist portrait depicted Mrs. Anger in a glove tight Saint Laurent suit and what almost looked like the kind of Capezio pumps professional dancers wore.",

It was another sign of her overall favor and influence that Mrs. Anger let her store the bicycle in her office, which locked. The executive intern\x{2019}s arrival that morning was ever so slightly late, because the SE2 issue had finally closed the previous day. Mrs. Anger herself rarely rolled in much before <<9:30|2>>.",

            "\x{2018}That\x{2019}s nice, but it\x{2019}s not really my point,\x{2019} Laurel Manderley said. She was seated at Atwater\x{2019}s console, absently snapping and unsnapping a calfskin barrette. As was SOP with Skip and his interns, this telephone conversation was neither rapid nor clipped. It was <<shortly before 3:30|2>> and <<4:30|2>> respectively, since Indiana does not adhere to the DST convention. Laurel Manderley would later tell Skip that she had been so tired and unwell on Tuesday that she\x{2019}d felt almost translucent, and plus was upset that she would have to come in on the Fourth, tomorrow, in order to mediate between Atwater and Ellen Bactrian re the so called artist\x{2019}s appearance on The Suffering Channel\x{2019}s inaugural tableau vivant thing, all of which had been literally thrown together in hours. It was not the way either of them normally worked.",

Ellen Bactrian wore a dark gray Fila unitard with Reebok crosstrainers. There was a neoprene brace on her right knee, but it was mostly prophylactic, the legacy of a soccer injury at Wellesley three seasons past. Multicolored fairy lights on the machines\x{2019} sides spelled out the brand name of the elliptical trainers. The executive intern, in the same ensemble she\x{2019}d worn for biking in to the Style offices that morning, had programmed her machine to the same medium level of difficulty as Ellen Bactrian\x{2019}s, as a kind of courtesy.",

            "In what everyone at the next day\x{2019}s working lunch would agree was a masterstroke, the special limousine that arrived at <<5:00 AM|2a>> Wednesday to convey the artist and his wife to Chicago was like something out of a Style reader\x{2019}s dream. Half a city block long, white the way cruise ships and bridal gowns are white, it had a television and wet bar, opposing seats of cordovan leather, noiseless AC, and a thick glass shield between passenger compartment and driver that could be raised and lowered at the touch of a button on the woodgrain panel, for privacy. To Skip Atwater, it looked like the hearse of the kind of star for whom the whole world stops dead in its tracks to mourn. Inside, the Moltkes faced each other, their knees almost touching, the artist\x{2019}s hands obscured from view by the panels of his new beige sportcoat.",

Finalists were still being auditioned as late as <<3:00 PM|2a>>\x{2014}and Style magazine\x{2019}s Skip Atwater, in a move whose judgment was later questioned all up and down the editorial line, ended up devoting a good part of his time, attention, and shorthand notes to these auditions, as well as to a lengthy and somewhat meandering Q&A with an assistant to the Reudenthal and Voss associate tasked to the day\x{2019}s multiform permissions and releases.",

            "The emetic prosthesis consisted of a small polyurethane bag taped under one arm and a tube of ordinary clear plastic running up the rear of the left shoulder blade to emerge from the turtleneck through a small hole just under my chin. The contents of the bag were six of the little cakes mixed with mineral water and real bile harvested by means of OTC emetic first thing this AM. The bag\x{2019}s power cell and vacuum were engineered for one high-volume emission and two or three smaller spurts and dribbles afterward; they were to be activated by a button on my watch. The material wouldn\x{2019}t actually be coming out of my mouth, but it was a safe bet that nobody would be looking closely at the point of exit; people\x{2019}s automatic reaction is to avert their eyes. The C.P.D.\x{2019}s transmitter\x{2019}s clear earpiece was attached to my glasses. The scope\x{2019}s Mission Time said <<24:31|2>> and change, but the presentation already seemed much longer.
