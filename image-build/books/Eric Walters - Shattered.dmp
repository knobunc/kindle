The sink, filled with soapy suds, was already filled to capacity. Was I supposed to help wash the dishes as well? I hated washing dishes\x{2014} not that I did it very often. Berta, our housekeeper, took care of all those things. If I was supposed to do the dishes here that could take forever. Then again, what did I care? The longer I was here the more quickly I\x{2019}d be through having to come back. It was <<seven forty-five|5b>>. If I worked another fifteen minutes that would be two hours. That meant I had to come here twenty times to complete my placement. If I came here three times a week that would take almost seven weeks. If I hadn\x{2019}t been so stupid I would have started doing my hours when everybody else did. It would probably be better if I did stay and work on the dishes. If I stayed until nine that would be three hours, and I\x{2019}d only have to come here thirteen times\x{2014}only thirteen times. I shook my head.",
