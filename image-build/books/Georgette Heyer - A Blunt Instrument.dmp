But, setting aside the fact that she\'s got no reason to tell lies now she knows that precious husband of hers isn\'t implicated in the crime,  we  have  the  post man\'s  word  for it that a  woman dressed like her came out of Greystones at <<just after 10|10>>.<<00 p.m.|5>>  on  the  17th.  So  that fixes her. If  it  weren\'t  for  his having  compared  his  watch  with  the  clock  in  the  late Ernest\'s  study,  I\'d  say  old  Ichabod  was  mistaken  in  the time he saw a chap coming out of the side gate. But he\'s a conscientious, painstaking officer, is Ichabod, and he\'s not the sort to state positively that it was <<10.02|3:1>> if it wasn\'t. I  mean to say, you ought to hear him on the subject of false witnesses. Ticked me off properly, when I tried to shake his evidence a bit. But if you can make his evidence fit Mrs North\'s, all I can say is you\'re cleverer than I am. It wasn\'t so bad when the only fixed times we had were <<10.02|5a:1>>, when Ichabod saw the unknown, and <<10.05|5a:1>> when he discovered the body of the late Ernest. But the moment we began to collect more fixed times the whole case got so cock-eyed there was no doing anything with it. We\'re now faced with four highly incompatible times, unless you assume young Neville  murdered  his  uncle,  and  Carpenter  saw  it,  and bolted for his life. We\'ve got <<9.58|5a:1>>, or thereabouts, when Ernest saw Mrs North\'s man off; <<10.01|9p>>, when Mrs North left; <<10.02|5a:1>> when Ichabod\'s man left by the side gate; and <<10.05|5a:1>>  when  Ernest  was  found  dead.

She stated that the man X left the study with Ernest at <<9.58|9c:1>>, that she went back into it, and left it as the hall clock struck <<10.00|11>>. Now, the only times we know to be correct are <<10.02|5a:1>>, when Glass saw X making off; and <<10.05|5a:1>>, when he discovered Fletcher's body. That left us with a difference of four minutes, between the time Mrs North said X left and the time Glass actually  saw him leave. We could just, and only just, account for that by  assuming  that X  doubled back to  the study, murdered Fletcher, and again made off. But if Fletcher returned to the study not at <<10.00|9c:1>>, but at <<10.01|9c:1>>, then there is no possibility of X's having returned, committed the murder, and reached the gate again.
