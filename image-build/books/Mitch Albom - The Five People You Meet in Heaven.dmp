Back at the pier, the crowd stood silently around the wreckage of Freddy\x{2019}s Free Fall. Old women touched their throats. Mothers pulled their children away. Several burly men in tank tops slid to the front, as if this were something they should handle, but once they got there, they, too, only looked on, helpless.

The morning after the accident, Dominguez came to the shop early, skipping his routine of picking up a bagel and a soft drink for breakfast. The park was closed, but he came in anyhow, and he turned on the water at the sink. He ran his hands under the flow, thinking he would clean some of the ride parts.

Who would pay for Eddie\x{2019}s funeral? He had no relatives. He\x{2019}d left no instructions. His body remained at the city morgue, as did his clothes and personal effects, his maintenance shirt, his socks and shoes, his linen cap, his wedding ring, his cigarettes and pipe cleaners, all awaiting claim.",

She smiled and he smiled, and she was, to him, as beautiful as ever, and he closed his eyes and said for the first time what he\x{2019}d been feeling from the moment he saw her again: \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t want to go on.
