The typical size of positronium forged during the Dark Era is trillions of light-years, larger than the entire observable universe of today Positronium formation of this type is scheduled to begin around the 71st cosmological decade. These enormous atoms are born in states of relatively high energy, compared to the microscopic positronium atoms that decay so quickly. The electron and the positron slowly circle each other and gradually give up extraordinarily small amounts of radiation as their orbits become ever smaller. The particles spiral together in an exotic dance which ultimately results in the complete destruction of the participants and a total bankruptcy of their stored energy. With their enormous starting sizes, the positronium atoms take a rather long time to decay, <<about 145|9n:0>> cosmological decades.

For the sake of definiteness, we adopt a proton lifetime of 37 cosmological decades for most of this discussion; other values for the proton lifetime can easily be accommodated without qualitatively changing the story. If the proton does not decay through the simplest channels predicted by grand unified theories (see, e.g., Langacker 1981; Kane 1993), a host of other proton decay channels are possible (e.g., Feinberg, Goldhaber, and Steigman 1978; Wilczek and Zee 1979; Mohapatra and Marshak 1980; Weinberg 1980; Goity and Sher 1995).
