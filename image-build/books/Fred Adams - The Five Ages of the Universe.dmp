These shadow bands, among the rarest of natural phenomena, were produced by the special combination of a crescent sliver of Sun and unusual turbulence in the upper atmosphere. The bands persisted for less than a minute, and then seemed to evaporate. The wind grew stronger.',

Stars live in galaxies which have masses of about one hundred billion (10) solar masses, and stars are made of hydrogen atoms which have masses of about 10 grams or about 10 solar masses. Thus, in principle, galaxies could build objects anywhere in the mass range from <<10|20b>> to <<10|20a>> solar masses, a factor of 10 in mass scale! And yet, stars exist in a range whose mass is allowed to vary only by a factor of a thousand.',

Since the stars must live relatively long, they must be relatively small. By this conservative measure, the largest star that can survive long enough contains <<1.15|5a:0>> solar masses. In addition, the stars must not have binary companions capable of disrupting habitable orbits. These requirements are not particularly restrictive.

The percentage of supernovae that leave behind black holes, as opposed to neutron stars or complete dispersal, lies in the neighborhood of \x{3b9} to 10 percent. Each galaxy will thus contain roughly one million stellar black holes by the time star formation and stellar evolution have run their course.

            "By the 40th cosmological decade, the galaxies are completely destroyed. Galactic gas and dust will have long since been dispersed or incorporated into stars. Because of the decay of their constituent protons, stellar remnants, brown dwarfs, and planets have entirely evaporated. Except for stray radiation and scattered elementary particles, the sole legacy of each galaxy is one supermassive black hole and about one million stellar black holes. As these black holes slowly trace their orbits through vast gravitationally bound clusters, some fraction of the supermassive black holes merge to form gargantuan conglomerate black holes. The volume of space which now makes up our observable universe contributes roughly thirty billion supermassive holes and thirty million billion stellar holes to the overall melange. The total number of black holes in the entire observable universe at the start of the Black Hole Era is colossal. The horizon is 10 times farther away than it is now. If the large-scale geometry of space-time is flat, the observable universe will contain about 10 black holes with supermassive status, and <<nearly 10|9w>> stellar black holes, one trillion trillion holes for every star within the cosmological horizon of today\x{2019}s universe.",

Observed through a telescope, the black hole appears like a psychedelic comet, surrounded by faintly glowing gas and warped images of background stars and galaxies.

In the future, when the universe is 100 billion years old, the time will be <<10|9c:0>>\x{201d} years or \x{3b7} = 11 cosmological decades. The power of this scheme is that each successive cosmological decade represents a tenfold increase in the total age of the universe.

Our aggressively large example, the number 10, thus corresponds to the rather more tractable hundredth cosmological decade, or \x{3b7} = 100.",

            "The idea of a Copernican time principle forms a natural extension of our ever widening view of the universe. A major revolution in perspective took place in the 16th century, when Nicolaus Copernicus argued that Earth is not the center of our solar system, as had been previously assumed. Copernicus correctly realized that Earth is just one of a number of planets orbiting the Sun. This apparent reduction in status of Earth and hence mankind had profound repercussions at the time. As the story is usually told, the heretical implications of this shift in thinking prompted Copernicus to delay the publication of his greatest work De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium until <<1543|9c:0>>, the year of his death. He hesitated until the very end, and came close to leaving his work concealed. In the introduction of his book, Copernicus writes, \x{201c}I was almost impelled to put the finished work wholly aside, through the scorn I had reason to anticipate on account of the newness and apparent contrariness of my theory to reason.\x{201d} In spite of the delay, the work was eventually published, and the first printed copy was laid out on the deathbed of Copernicus. Earth was no longer thought to be the center of the universe. A major revolution had begun.",
