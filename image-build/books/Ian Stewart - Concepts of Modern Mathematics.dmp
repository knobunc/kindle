            "In Chapter 11 we had a four-colour problem and a five-colour theorem. On 22 July 1972 two mathematicians at the University of Illinois, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken, announced a proof1 that every map on the plane can be coloured with four colours, resolving the long-standing question. The snag with their proof is that it involves an immense amount of computing time - they used <<about 1200 hours|1>>, but a check might be performed in 300 on a big machine - and a single error might destroy the proof completely. Contrary to popular opinion, computers do make errors even when their programmers do not. The problems raised by this are as much philosophical as technical (is a proof checked by a human any more likely to be accurate than one checked by computer?) and look like causing some problems in future. At the present moment, the Appel\x{2014}Haken proof has not been fully checked by an independent program, although those parts that have been checked appear to be error-free. Philosophy apart, most mathematicians would probably agree that the theorem is proved provided such a check is carried out in full. The philosophical problem is an interesting one, however, because it involves the difference between a logical proof and a satisfactory one. I shall return to this once we\x{2019}ve seen how it goes.",
