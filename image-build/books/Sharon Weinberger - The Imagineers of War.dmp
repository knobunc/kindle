The writing that had the \x{201c}greatest influence on Petraeus\x{2019}s thinking,\x{201d} according to the journalist Fred Kaplan, was a counterinsurgency book by David Galula, the French officer sponsored by DARPA in the early 1960s under Project AGILE. Petraeus lifted Galula out of decades of obscurity, dusting off his writing and incorporating elements of it in a new counterinsurgency manual. \x{201c}The objective is the population\x{201d} became an often-cited sentence from Galula\x{2019}s DARPA-funded study of Algeria. In Iraq, COIN was heralded as a success, elevating Petraeus and a new generation of \x{201c}COINdinistas,\x{201d} as the newly minted experts were called, to near-rock-star status. \x{201c}By <<2009|9:0>> [counterinsurgency] was being celebrated as the answer to America\x{2019}s mounting woes in Afghanistan as well,\x{201d} wrote Greg Jaffe, a Washington Post reporter.",

            "By <<2013|9e:1>>, DARPA\x{2019}s work in Afghanistan had drawn to a close, though the Taj, the onetime staging base for More Eyes, lived on as a symbol of the agency\x{2019}s well-intentioned but ultimately failed efforts to harness science in the service of counterinsurgency. The Taj that year was nominally still open, serving stale cornflakes to the rare guest, who could lounge on a rusting lawn chair perched on cracked concrete overlooking the long-empty pool. At the edge of the pool, solar panels, which powered nothing at all, tilted up wistfully toward the sun. All that was left of the only tiki bar in Afghanistan was a collection of moldering business cards and a \x{201c}Synergy Strike Force\x{201d} combat patch stapled to a piece of wood, the last remnants of the Western patrons who had swapped their data for beer. Outside this onetime oasis of DARPA-funded techno-optimism, Afghans lived and fought much as they had for more than a thousand years. Inside, the bar stood empty, an enduring testament to science\x{2019}s ability to transform warfare but not to end it.",

            "The question, however, is whether those novelties have successfully achieved what DARPA at one time intended: to create technologies that ensure the United States would not have to go to war and, if it did go to war, that it would achieve a swift victory. Nothing illustrates that disparity better perhaps than the 1960s-era investment in counterinsurgency research, intended to prevent large-scale conventional engagements in so-called limited wars. By <<2006|9e:1>>, counterinsurgency theory was resurrected as a tool to help conventional forces wage war against insurgents, the exact thing the original DARPA program was meant to prevent. The allure of applying the wizardry of science and technology to warfare seems only to have made the temptation to engage in armed conflict more inviting and to have entangled the United States in a \x{201c}forever war.\x{201d}",

            "The current DARPA is so narrowly focused on technical problems it is hard to see how its mandate could have allowed it to come up with anything more creative in Afghanistan than computer algorithms. Nexus 7 was significant as an attempt to address current problems of warfare and insurgency by exploiting cutting-edge science and technology. And it was the first time since the Vietnam War that DARPA deployed personnel to a war zone. Yet its narrow scope also highlights how much had changed. In the Vietnam War, DARPA had sought to understand the fundamentals of society and the causes of insurgency; by <<2011|9e:1>>, DARPA in Afghanistan was seeking simply to predict the next IED attack. The wide-ranging exploration of human behavior that led to the hiring of J. C. R. Licklider seems unlikely today in an agency whose notion of social science is limited to computer programs that spit out predictions like a Zoltar Fortune Teller machine. \x{201c}This may be more like an entropy process,\x{201d} Lukasik said. \x{201c}Once you move in that direction, you move in the direction of more detail, and if that\x{2019}s the case, you run the risk of becoming irrelevant, because your measure of survival is political adroitness rather than technical excellence and solving important problems.\x{201d}",

The aircraft\x{2014}essentially a powered glider\x{2014}used a muffled Volkswagen engine so that it could fly at night without being detected, to spot Vietcong laying booby traps. The modified aircraft was painted beige to mask its visibility, and in domestic testing it was given the fictitious company name San Jose Geophysical Inc. to hide its military connections. Though sometimes touted as the first example of a \x{201c}stealth aircraft,\x{201d} the QT-2 was not designed to evade radar.
