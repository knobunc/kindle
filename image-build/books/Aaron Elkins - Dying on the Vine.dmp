            "The answers were yes and yes, so that when they arrived <<a few minutes before two|10>>, having stopped for panini at a dreary roadside caf\x{e9}, the Cubbiddus were already waiting for them in the frescoed sitting room (decorated with faux eighteenth-century depictions of the villa and its rolling green vineyards\x{2014}which hadn\x{2019}t been planted until the twentieth) of Franco\x{2019}s suite. They sat, singly and in pairs, on slender, elegant, flute-legged Louis XVI armchairs and settees. They all knew the meeting concerned Pietro and Nola, but none of them had any idea of what to expect, including Martignetti, who was in a corner, a little away from the others, with a pad and pen at the ready on his lap. Franco and Nico shared a settee, as did Luca and Linda. The Cubbiddu\x{2019}s lawyer, Severo Quadrelli, was twiddling his thumbs, prudently seated in the only chair really suited to his heft: a so-called tub chair, a wide, substantial object built along the lines of a half barrel set atop short, thick legs. A sort of chair version of the man himself.",

Julie and Marti were learning how to make zabaglione, and John had turned down his invitation to join him at the Museo Galileo, formerly the Museo di Storia della Scienze, in Florence. Having the morning to himself suited him fine. The museum, which he also had pretty much to himself, was housed in yet another gorgeous sixteenth-century palazzo (yawn) on the Arno. The building directly abutted the Uffizi, but while the line to enter that celebrated museum already wound around the corner at <<nine thirty in the morning|5>>, getting into the Galileo was simply a matter of walking through the human-size entry cut into the great wooden portal and paying one\x{2019}s eight euros at the desk.",

If the problema The museum was a bigger place than he\x{2019}d expected, with more rooms, and as far as he knew there were no more than half a dozen visitors in it. It was a shame, he thought, that science drew so paltry an audience, but it certainly made museum-going a lot more pleasant than those folks had it in the next building over. He was able to wander at his leisure and pause as long as he wished at the objects that caught his interest. Of which there were many: evocative, sepia-colored antique maps, huge sixteenth-century globes made to adorn royal apartments, fabulous golden armillary spheres that had tracked the heavens five hundred years ago. There were six-foot-long wooden astronomical telescopes, an ingenious sixteenth century calculator, frightening old surgical instruments, and even an eighteenth-century \x{201c}mechanical paradox\x{201d} in which a cylinder placed at the bottom of a set of rails rolled quite indubitably upward when released.",

There he made two purchases, which he brought back unopened to Villa Antica. He got two glasses from the tasting room, went out to the back terrace with them, and sat down at one of the tables. He removed from the paper bag two half-liter bottles that held purple liquid. One them had Giorniquilla on a bright red background; this was the same cough medicine he\x{2019}d seen Cesare guzzling. The other, identical except that its label was moss green, said Dormiquilla. He undid both screw caps and poured some from each into separate glasses. He sipped from <<one|9c:1>>, then the other. Thought a minute. With his eyes closed, he switched the bottles themselves around enough times to turn it into a blind tasting. Sipped directly from the first bottle that came to hand, then from the other. Opened his eyes. Thought again.",
