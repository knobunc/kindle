         expanded what can be considered secret. One of the truisms of national security is
         that secrecy is necessary in matters of intelligence, foreign policy, and defense.
         If the government made certain things public\x{2014}troop movements, weapons capabilities,

         notion of military secrecy has been true for millennia, but recently has changed dramatically.
         I\x{2019}m using the US as an example here. In World War I, we were concerned about the secrecy
         of specific facts, like the location of military units and the precise plans of a
         battle. In World War II, we extended that secrecy to both large-scale operations and
         entire areas of knowledge. Not only was our program to build an atomic bomb secret;
         the entire science of nuclear weaponry was secret. <<After 9|9:0>>/11, we generalized further,

         cosmetics to them. And they know that different ages and genders respond better to
