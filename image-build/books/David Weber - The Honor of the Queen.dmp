She was just far enough abaft Fearless\'s beam to deny them an "up the kilt" shot through the wide-open after end of her wedge, but Honor couldn\'t believe how close the battlecruiser\'s captain had come to giving her that deadly opening. And now he was going to maximum power! Preposterous as it was, Rafe was right - she was breaking off the action!"Shall we pursue, Ma\'am?" Cardones\' tone left no doubt as to his own preference, and Honor couldn\'t blame him. His missile armament was untouched, and he\'d outscored his opponent at least <<six-to-one|10a:0>>.

The mortality rate was high among men, too, and there\'d been fewer of them to begin with, and biology played another trick on us. Our female births outnumber male by <<three to one|10a:0>>; if we were to sustain a viable population, every potential father had to begin begetting children as soon as possible and spread his genes as widely as he could before Grayson killed him, so our households grew. And as they grew, family became everything and the patriarch\'s authority became absolute. It was a survival trait which tied in only too well with our religious beliefs. After a century, women weren\'t even people - not really. They were property. Bearers of children. The promise of a man\'s physical continuation in a world which offered him a life expectancy of less than forty years of backbreaking toil, and our efforts to create a godly society institutionalized that."',
