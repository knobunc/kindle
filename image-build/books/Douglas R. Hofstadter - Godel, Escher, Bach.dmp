I first came into contact with this work through a couple of English translations, and then read others, always fascinated by the translators' different philosophies and styles. From this first flame of excitement, I slowly was drawn into trying to read the original text, and then somehow, despite having a poor command of Russian, I could not prevent myself from trying to translate a stanza or two. Thus started a slippery slope that I soon slid down, eventually stunning myself by devoting a whole year to recreating the entire novel \x{2014} <<nearly 400|18:0>> sparkling sonnets \x{2014} in English verse. Of course, during that time, my Russian improved by leaps and bounds, though it still is far from conversationally fluent.

            "As it is now formulated, TNT has reached \"critical mass\" (perhaps a strange metaphor to apply to something called \"TNT\"). It is of the same strength as the system of Principia Mathematica; in TNT one can now prove every theorem which you would find in a standard treatise on number theory. Of course, no one would claim that deriving theorems in TNT is the best way to do number theory. Anybody who felt that way would fall in the same class of people as those who think that the best way to know what 1000 x 1000 is, is to draw a 1000 by <<1000|3:0>> grid, and count all the squares in it . . . No; after total formalization, the only way to go is towards relaxation of the formal system. Otherwise, it is so enormously unwieldy as to be, for all practical purposes, useless. Thus, it is important to embed TNT within a wider context, a context which enables new rules of inference to be derived, so that derivations can be speeded up. This would require formalization of the language in which rules of inference are expressed\x{2014}that is, the metalanguage. And one could go considerably further. However, none of these speeding-up tricks would make TNT any more powerful; they would simply make it more usable. The simple fact is that we have put into TNT every mode of thought that number theorists rely on. Embedding it in ever larger contexts will not enlarge the space of theorems; it will just make working in TNT\x{2014}or in each \"new, improved version\"\x{2014}look more like doing conventional number theory.",
