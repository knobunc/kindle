I knew that it was going to be an excruciating wait until the conference at <<eleven-thirty|5b>>; and it was all I could do to stand still and not blurt out incriminating questions. I had no idea what they might spring on my mother and me once they had us in the office; the very word \x{201c}conference\x{201d} suggested a convocation of authorities, accusations and face-downs, a possible expulsion. If I lost my scholarship it would be catastrophic; we were broke since my dad had left; we barely had money for rent. Above all else: I was worried sick that Mr. Beeman had found out, somehow, that Tom Cable and I had been breaking into empty vacation houses when I went to stay with him out in the Hamptons. I say \x{201c}breaking\x{201d} though we hadn\x{2019}t forced a lock or done any damage (Tom\x{2019}s mother was a real estate agent; we let ourselves in with spare keys lifted from the rack in her office). Mainly we\x{2019}d snooped through closets and poked around in dresser drawers, but we\x{2019}d also taken some things: beer from the fridge, some Xbox games and a DVD (Jet Li, Unleashed) and money, about ninety-two dollars total: crumpled fives and tens from a kitchen jar, piles of pocket change in the laundry rooms.",

Luckily, when he was drunk, his footsteps slowed to a jarring and unmistakable cadence\x{2014}Frankenstein steps, as I thought of them, deliberate and clumping, with absurdly long pauses between each footfall\x{2014}and as soon as I realized it was only him thudding around out there in the dark and not some serial murderer or psychopath, I would drift back into a fretful doze. The following day, Saturday, my mother and I would contrive to be out of the apartment before he woke from his sweaty, tangled sleep on the sofa. Otherwise we would spend the whole day creeping around, afraid of shutting the door too loudly or of disturbing him in any way, while he sat stony-faced in front of the television with a Chinese beer from the takeout place and a glassy look in his eye, watching news or sports with the sound off.",

            "In many respects it was a relief to have my father out of the picture. Certainly I didn\x{2019}t miss him much, and my mother didn\x{2019}t seem to miss him either, though it was sad when she had to let our housekeeper, Cinzia, go because we couldn\x{2019}t afford to pay her (Cinzia had cried, and offered to stay and work for free; but my mother had found her a part time job in the building, working for a couple with a baby; once a week or so, she stopped in to visit my mother for a cup of coffee, still in the smock she wore over her clothes when she cleaned.) Without fanfare, the photo of a younger, suntanned dad atop a ski slope came down from the wall, and was replaced by one of my mother and me at the rink in Central Park. At night my mother sat up late with a calculator, going over bills. Even though the apartment was rent stabilized, getting by without my dad\x{2019}s salary was a month-by-month adventure, since whatever new life he\x{2019}d fashioned for himself elsewhere did not include sending money for child support. Basically we were content enough doing our own laundry down in the basement, going to matinees instead of full-price movies, eating day-old baked goods and cheap Chinese carry-out (noodles, egg foo yung) and counting out nickels and dimes for bus fare. But as I trudged home from the museum that day\x{2014}cold, wet, with a tooth-crunching headache\x{2014}it struck me that with my dad gone, no one in the world would be particularly worried about my mother or me; no one was sitting around wondering where we\x{2019}d been all morning or why they hadn\x{2019}t heard from us. Wherever he was, off in his New Life (tropics or prairie, tiny ski town or Major American City) he would certainly be riveted to the television; and it was easy to imagine that maybe he was even getting a little frantic and wound-up, as he sometimes did over big news stories that had absolutely nothing to do with him, hurricanes and bridge collapses in distant states. But would he be worried enough to call and check on us? Probably not\x{2014}no more than he would be likely to call his old office to see what was happening, though certainly he would be thinking of his ex-colleagues in midtown and wondering how all the bean counters and pencil-pushers (as he referred to his co-workers) were faring at <<101|3:1>> Park. Were the secretaries getting scared, gathering their pictures off their desks and putting on their walking shoes and going home? Or was it turning into a subdued party of sorts on the fourteenth floor, people ordering in sandwiches and gathering around the television in the conference room?",

There was the shopping bag from Paragon Sporting Goods\x{2014}tag of the pup tent dangling, King Kanopy, \$43.99, just as crisp and new-looking as the day I\x{2019}d bought it eight years before. And though the texture of the pillowcase peeking out of the bag threw me an ugly short-circuit, like an electric pop in the temple, more than anything I was struck by the smell\x{2014}for the plastic, pool-liner odor of masking tape had grown overwhelming from being shut up in such a small space, an emotionally evocative odor I hadn\x{2019}t remembered or thought of in years, a distinct polyvinyl reek that threw me straight back to childhood and my bedroom back in Vegas: chemicals and new carpet, falling asleep and waking up every morning with the painting taped behind my headboard and the same adhesive smell in my nostrils. I had not properly unwrapped it in years; just to get it open would take ten or fifteen minutes with an X-Acto knife but as I stood there overwhelmed (slippage and confusion, almost like the time I\x{2019}d waked, sleepwalking, in the door of Pippa\x{2019}s bedroom, I didn\x{2019}t know what I\x{2019}d been thinking or what I ought to do) I was transfixed with an urge amounting almost to delirium: for to have it only a handbreadth away again, after so long, was to find myself suddenly on some kind of dangerous, yearning edge I hadn\x{2019}t even known was there. In the shadows the mummified bundle\x{2014}what little was visible\x{2014}had a ragged, poignant, oddly personal look, less like an inanimate object than some poor creature bound and helpless in the dark, unable to cry out and dreaming of rescue. I hadn\x{2019}t been so close to the painting since I was fifteen years old, and for a moment it was all I could do to keep from snatching it up and tucking it under my arm and walking out with it. But I could feel the security cameras hissing at my back; and\x{2014}quick spasmodic movement\x{2014}I dropped my Redbreast Flake tin in the Bloomingdale\x{2019}s bag and shut the door and turned the key. \x{201c}Just flush them if you ever really want to kick,\x{201d} Jerome\x{2019}s extremely hot girlfriend Mya had advised me, \x{201c}else your ass is going to be up at that storage unit at <<two in the morning|9a>>,\x{201d} but as I walked out the door, lightheaded and buzzed, the drugs were the last thing on my mind.

My childish machinations about the chest-on-chest now struck me as ridiculous\x{2014}I would simply have to go to Hobie and admit what I\x{2019}d done: not much fun, pretty shitty in fact, but better if he heard it from me. How he would react I couldn\x{2019}t imagine; antiques were all I knew, I\x{2019}d have a hard time getting another job in sales but I was just handy enough to find a place in a workshop if I had to, gilding frames or cutting bobbins; restorations didn\x{2019}t pay well but so few people knew how to repair antiques to any kind of decent standard that someone was sure to take me on. As for the article: I was confused by what I\x{2019}d read, almost as if I\x{2019}d walked in on the middle of the wrong movie. On one level it was clear enough: some enterprising crook had faked my goldfinch (in terms of size and technique, not all that difficult a piece to fake) and the phony was floating around somewhere being fronted as collateral in drug deals and mis-identified by various clueless drug lords and federal agents. But no matter how fanciful or off-base the story, how lacking in relevance to the painting or me, the connection Reeve had made was real. Who knew how many people Hobie had told about me showing up at his house? or how many people those people had told? But so far no one, not even Hobie, had made the connection that Welty\x{2019}s ring put me in the gallery with the painting. This was the crux of the biscuit, as my father would have said. This was the story that would get me put in jail. The French art thief who\x{2019}d panicked, who\x{2019}d burned a lot of the paintings he\x{2019}d stolen (Cranach, Watteau, Corot) had gotten only twenty-six months in prison.

But at closing time, <<seven p.m.|5>>, I still had some catching-up to do in the shop. A decorator, miraculously, had shown up to inquire about some expensive, out of fashion, and impossible-to-sell pewter that had been gathering dust atop a cabinet since Welty\x{2019}s day. Pewter wasn\x{2019}t something I knew much about, and I was looking for the article I wanted in a back number of Antiques when Boris dashed up from the curb and knocked on the glass door, not five minutes after I\x{2019}d locked up for the day. It was pelting rain; in the ragged downpour he was a shadow in an overcoat, unrecognizable, but the cadence of his rap was distinct from the old days, when he would circle around to the patio at my dad\x{2019}s house and tap briskly for me to let him in.",

            "SO I SPENT THE night\x{2014}we ordered in, later, and then went back to bed. But though on some level it was all easy enough pretending everything was the same (because, in some way, hadn\x{2019}t we both been pretending all along?) on another I felt nearly suffocated by the weight of everything unknown, and unsaid, pressing down between us, and later when she lay curled against me asleep I lay awake and stared out the window feeling completely alone. The silences of the evening (my fault, not Kitsey\x{2019}s\x{2014}even in extremis Kitsey was never at a loss for words) and the seemingly unbridgeable distance between us had reminded me very strongly of being sixteen and never having the faintest idea what to say or do around Julie, who though she definitely couldn\x{2019}t be called a girlfriend was the first woman I\x{2019}d thought of as such. We\x{2019}d met outside the liquor store on Hudson when I was standing outside money in hand wanting someone to go in and buy me a bottle of something and there she came billowing around the corner, in batlike, futuristic garb incongruous with her clumping walk and farm-girl looks, her plain-but-pleasing face of a prairie wife of the 1900s. \x{201c}Hey kid\x{2014}\x{201d} hoisting her own wine bottle out of the bag\x{2014}\x{201c}here\x{2019}s your change. No really. Don\x{2019}t mention it. Are you going to stand out here in the cold and drink that?\x{201d} She was twenty-seven, nearly twelve years older than me, with a boyfriend just finishing business school in California\x{2014}and there was never any question that when the boyfriend came back I wasn\x{2019}t to come by or contact her ever again. We both knew. She hadn\x{2019}t had to say it. Galloping up the five flights to her studio, on the rare (to me) afternoons I was permitted to come see her, I was always bursting with words and feelings too big to contain but all the things I\x{2019}d planned to say to her always vanished the instant she opened the door and instead of being able to engage in conversation for even two minutes like a normal person, I would instead hover speechless and desperate three steps behind her, hands plunged in pockets, hating myself, while she walked barefoot around the studio looking hip, talking effortlessly, apologizing for the dirty clothes on the floor and for forgetting to pick up a six-pack of beer\x{2014}did I want her to run downstairs?\x{2014}until at some point I would almost literally hurl myself at her mid-sentence and knock her over on the day bed, so violently sometimes my glasses flew off. It had all been so wonderful I\x{2019}d thought I would die but lying awake afterward I\x{2019}d been sick with emptiness, her white arm on the coverlet, streetlights coming on, dreading the <<eight o\x{2019}clock|6>> hour which meant she would have to get up and dress for her job, at a bar in Williamsburg where I wasn\x{2019}t old enough to stop in and visit her. And I hadn\x{2019}t even loved Julie. I\x{2019}d admired her, and obsessed over her, and envied her confidence, and even been a little afraid of her; but I hadn\x{2019}t really loved her, no more than she\x{2019}d loved me. I wasn\x{2019}t so sure I loved Kitsey either (at least not the way I\x{2019}d once wished I loved her) but still it was surprising just how bad I felt, considering I\x{2019}d been through the routine before.",

It was topaz, eighteenth century, a necklace for a fairy queen, girand\x{f4}le with diamond bow and huge, clear, honey-colored stones: just the shade of her eyes. As I turned away, averting my gaze from the wall of her photos opposite, and hurried down the stairs, it was almost with the old childhood terror and exhilaration of having thrown a rock through a window.
