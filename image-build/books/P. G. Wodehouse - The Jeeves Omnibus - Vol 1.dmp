It\x{2019}s all right for you fellows who have nothing to do, but I\x{2019}m a busy man. Good night, old thing. Close the door quietly after you and switch out the light.

I told him then that this nuisance must now cease, and after that he cheesed it, and practically passed out of my life, till one afternoon when I got back to the flat to dress for dinner and found Jeeves inspecting a whacking big poster sort of thing which he had draped over the back of an armchair.",
