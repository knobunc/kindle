            "HAPPY HOGSWATCH AND BE GOOD. I WILL KNOW IF YOU\x{2019}RE GOOD OR BAD, YOU KNOW. HO. HO. HO.\x{2018}Well, you brought some magic into that little life,\x{2019} said Albert.IT\x{2019}S THE EXPRESSION ON THEIR LITTLE FACES I LIKE, said the Hogfather.\x{2018}You mean sort of fear and awe and not knowing whether to laugh or cry or wet their pants?\x{2019}YES. NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL BELIEF.The Hogfather\x{2019}s duties include moral judgement. Has the child been good or bad, naughty or nice? A good little boy gets, say, a model Klatchian war chariot with real spinning sword blades. A bad little boy traditionally gets nothing but a bag of smelly old bones, though modern and enlightened parents are beginning to back off from this practice, on the grounds that (a) it causes a nasty complex, and (b) you really do not want to be woken up by all this weeping and wailing at <<six in the morning|9a>>.",

            "The Protestant parts of Germany disapproved of saints, so St Nicholas is not mentioned there. Instead, it is the Christ Child, imagined as a radiantly lovely little boy, who comes at <<midnight|3d>> on Christmas Eve to bless the good children and leave presents for them. However, it wouldn\x{2019}t do for things to be all sweetness and light. So in north Germany there is also Knecht Ruprecht, a weird figure dressed in skins or straw; if children have been good and can sing a hymn nicely, he rewards them with apples and gingerbread from his wallet, but if they can\x{2019}t he beats them with a bag of soot and ashes. In some parts people call him Rough Klas or Ashy Klas; since \x{2018}Klas\x{2019} is short for \x{2018}Nicholas\x{2019}, they must think he is an avatar of the saint.",

            "As far as is known, Death has not made similar arrangements on Earth. But apparently the Devil did, once. It\x{2019}s said that there was once a blacksmith at Keenthorne in Shropshire who was so proud of his skill that he boasted that \x{2018}if the Devil himself came to his forge he would shoe his horse for him, aye, and shoe him to rights too!\x{2019} And then, one dark <<midnight|13>>, a traveller on a great black horse arrived, demanding that it be shod \x{2013} and the smith noted with horror that the rider himself had a hoof. The smith ran off in a panic and roused the parson, begging him for help. The parson answered that he must fulfil his boast, but should accept no payment, for that would be selling himself to the Devil. So the smith did shoe the Devil\x{2019}s horse, most efficiently, but though the Devil repeatedly offered him good payment, he would take nothing. The Devil and his horse vanished in a flash of fire.",

            "Both the Rider and the Reaper were thought of, at first, as having the normal body of a living man. However, the European Middle Ages had a rather morbid interest in physical decay, so for a while Death adopted the appearance of a rotting corpse, with split belly, peeling skin, and crawling worms, wearing (if anything) a shroud. Many medieval painters and sculptors showed him in this form. Then, little by little, he changed over to something more hygienic \x{2013} just clean, gleaming bones. His new idea of himself as a Skeleton Reaper seeped into the minds of Italian artists during the fourteenth century. He can be seen in this guise, for example, on early packs of Tarot cards (he is Number 13 among the Greater Trumps, which accounts for a lot). Then, soon <<after 1400|18:0>>, painters in the Netherlands who had to do the illustrations for manuscripts of the Apocalypse got the message, and started drawing the Rider on the Pale Horse as a skeleton too. At first they kept the sword (after all, that\x{2019}s what the Book said), but by the end of the century woodcuts in German Bibles were giving him the scythe instead. And that, give or take a black cloak and hood, is how Death still usually chooses to be seen: a skeleton on a white horse, with a scythe and an hourglass. He allows himself one touch of luxury \x{2013} the robe is fastened with a silver brooch engraved with an omega, which is the last letter of the Greek alphabet and so very definitely signals The End. Also, it\x{2019}s a pretty shape.",

            "There stood upon the Downs close to Broadwater an old oak tree, and people said that always on Midsummer Eve, just at <<midnight|13>>, a number of skeletons started up from its roots and, joining hands, danced round it till cock-crow, then as suddenly sank down again. They said several persons had actually seen this dance of death; one young man in particular, having been detained by business at Findon till very late, and forgetting that it was Midsummer Eve, had been frightened out of his very senses by seeing the dead men caper to the rattling of their own bones.On other occasions, his dancing is sedate and courtly. In Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Dance of Death was often painted on the walls of cemeteries and churches; it showed a line of men and skeletons, hand in hand, pacing along in a slow and stately chain-dance. In England there was a famous mural in the cloister of London\x{2019}s Old St Paul\x{2019}s Cathedral (the one that burned down in the Great Fire of 1666), and there is still a set of carvings on the ceiling of Roslyn Chapel near Edinburgh. The Dance was also painted in the margins of prayer books, and acted out in religious pageants. Nowadays, it is best remembered as the closing shot of Ingmar Bergman\x{2019}s film The Seventh Seal.",
