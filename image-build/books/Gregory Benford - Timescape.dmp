            "The Colloquium topic was announced a week in advance. Gordon began reading up on the topic and taking down a few notes. He would look up the speaker\x{2019}s papers, with special attention to the Conclusions section, where authors usually speculated a bit, threw out \x{201c}blue sky\x{201d} ideas, and occasionally took indirect slams at their competitors. Then he would read the competitors\x{2019} papers as well. This always generated several good questions. Occasionally such a question, innocently asked, could puncture a speaker\x{2019}s ideas like a stiletto. This would create a murmur of interest in the audience, and inquiring glances toward Gordon. Even an ordinary question, if well delivered, created the impression of deep understanding. Gordon began by calling out questions from near the back. After a few weeks he moved forward. The senior professors in the department always took the first-row seats, and soon he was sitting only two rows behind them. They began turning in their seats to watch as he asked a question. Within a few more weeks he was in the second row. Full professors began to nod to him as they took their seats before Colloquium began. By Christmas Gordon was known to most of the department. He had felt a slight tug of guilt about it ever since, but, after all, he hadn\x{2019}t done anything except show a keen and systematic interest. If it benefited him, so much the better. He had been a demon for physics and mathematics then, more interested in watching a lecturer pull an analytic rabbit out of a higher mathematical hat than in a Broadway show. Once he spent a whole week trying to crack Fermat\x{2019}s Last Theorem, skipping lectures to scribble away. Somewhere <<around 1650|18:1>>, Pierre de Fermat jotted the equation x + y = zin the margin of his copy of Diophantus\x{2019} Arithmetic. Fermat wrote that if x, y, z, and n were positive integers, there were no solutions to the equation for n greater than two. \x{201c}The proof is too long to write in this margin,\x{201d} Fermat scribbled. In the 300 years since, no one had been able to prove it. Was Fermat bluffing? Maybe there wasn\x{2019}t a proof. Anyone who could decide the issue with a mathematical demonstration would be famous. Gordon struggled with the riddle and then, falling behind in classes, gave it up. But he swore that some day he would get back to it.",

He found himself slowly drawn into this vacuum. The apartment had been thick with talk as he grew up, except in the last times of his father, and a silence here unnerved him. Gordon told his mother about the battle over his work. Of Saul Shriffer. (No, she had not seen the TV news, but she heard. She wrote him, remember?) Of spontaneous resonance. Of Tulare\x{2019}s warning. And finally, of Penny. His mother didn\x{2019}t, wouldn\x{2019}t, couldn\x{2019}t believe a girl would turn down a man like her son. What could she be thinking of, to do that? Gordon found this response unexpectedly pleasing; he had forgotten the ability of mothers to shore up sons\x{2019} egos. He confessed to her that somehow he had gotten into the habit of thinking he and Penny would settle into something more conventional (\x{201c}respectable,\x{201d} his mother corrected). It had come as a surprise that Penny wasn\x{2019}t thinking in parallel. Something had happened to him then. He tried to explain it to his mother. She made the familiar, encouraging sounds. \x{201c}Maybe, I don\x{2019}t know, it was \x{2026} Penny I wanted to hold on to, now that everything else is going kaput\x{2026}\x{201d} But that wasn\x{2019}t quite what he meant, either.

I tried to tell you that.\x{201d} Gordon shook his head, sipping tea, confused. It was no use, he saw. He was all jumbled up inside and he suddenly didn\x{2019}t want to talk about Penny any more.

Show her what she\x{2019}s lost by\x{2014}\x{201d} and on she went, longer than Gordon wanted. He felt a momentum building in him, an urgency. He veered from these muddy matters of women. As his mother\x{2019}s voice droned in the heavy air he thought about Claudia Zinnes. He shuffled numbers and equipment in his head. He was making some plans when her phrases gradually penetrated; she thought he was leaving Penny. \x{201c}Huh?\x{201d} he sputtered, and she said blankly, \x{201c}Well, after that girl rejected you\x{2014}\x{201d} An argument followed. It reminded him far too much of the debates over when he had to be home from dates, and what he wore, and all the other small things that finally drove him to an apartment of his own. It ended with the same sad shaking of the head, the \x{201c}You are fartootst, Gordon, fartootst\x{2026}\x{201d} He changed the subject, wanted to call up Uncle Herb. \x{201c}He is in Massachusetts. He bought a consignment of hats cheap, now goes up there to spread them around. The market fell kapoosh when Kennedy wouldn\x{2019}t wear one, you know, but your uncle figures in New England the men, their heads are cold.\x{201d} She made more tea, they went for a walk. The silences widened between them. Gordon made no attempt to bridge them. His mother was aboil over Penny, he could see that, but he\x{2019}d had enough. He could stay longer, but the spreading silences promised more trouble. He stayed overnight, took her to an off-Broadway play and topped it off with crepes at Henry VIII\x{2019}s.
