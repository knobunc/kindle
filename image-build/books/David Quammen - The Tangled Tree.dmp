            "The phrase \x{201c}mitosing cells\x{201d} is another way of saying eukaryotic cells, the ones with nuclei and other complex internal structures, the ones that compose all animals and plants and fungi (as well as some other intricate life-forms, less familiar because they\x{2019}re microscopic). \x{201c}Mitosing\x{201d} refers to mitosis, of course, the phase in eukaryotic cell replication at which the chromosomes of the nucleus duplicate, then split apart into two bundles within two new nuclei, as a prelude to the cell fissioning into two complete new cells, each with an identical set of chromosomes. You learned about it in high school biology, not long before you dissected the poor frog. Mitosis is taught along with meiosis, the yang to its yin. Mitosis occurs during ordinary cell division, whereas meiosis constitutes \x{201c}reduction division,\x{201d} yielding the specialized sex cells known as gametes (eggs and sperm in an animal, eggs and pollen in a flowering plant). Meiosis in an animal yields four new cells, not two, <<after two|9:0>> divisions, not one, each resulting cell reduced to a half share of chromosomes. Later, sperm will meet egg, and, bingo, the full measure will be restored. It\x{2019}s a little hard to remember which of those terms is which, I concede, but here\x{2019}s my mnemonic: meiosis is reduction division because its spelling is reduced by the loss of the t in mitosis. Helpful? Granted, that leaves the inconvenient fact of meiosis containing the addition, not reduction, of an e. So, okay, never mind. But it works for me.",

He had no grant funding, just a bit of money given \x{201c}from time to time\x{201d} by a wealthy patron. He had no collaborators and no graduate students, just a pair of technical assistants, one also named Ivan.

Wallin\x{2019}s day job was anatomy professor. His lab was a shed behind the medical school\x{2019}s classrooms. He set to work and, between 1922 and 1927, produced nine papers and then a book, making his case not just that mitochondria derive from bacterial symbionts but also that such partnerships had repeatedly changed the course of the history of life.",

            "Whittaker returned to the problem in 1969. His paper \x{201c}New Concepts of Kingdoms of Organisms\x{201d} appeared in Science that year and, somewhat surprisingly, given his previous waffling, influenced a generation\x{2019}s worth of biology textbooks.

Meanwhile, as I\x{2019}ve described, Roger Stanier and C. B. van Niel had offered their own forceful idea on broad categories in 1962\x{2014}dividing all life into prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Whittaker nodded to that dichotomy, used it for characterizing bacteria, then otherwise essentially ignored it. He split the bacteria away from Protista and gave them their own realm, going back to Haeckel\x{2019}s label: Monera. His new illustration was a prickly pear cactus with five lobes: Monera at base, Protista rising from that, then Plantae and Fungi and Animalia.

            "So there\x{2019}s an extraordinary amount of evolutionary pressure, out there in the world, forcing bacteria to acquire resistance or die. But the most startling aspects of the trend have been how speedily resistance has spread and how many different kinds of bacteria have acquired multiple resistance\x{2014}that is, resistance not <<just to one|10>> antibiotic but also to whole arsenals of different kinds. The danger of multiple resistance is that whatever antibiotic may be prescribed, whatever pharmaceutical may be thrown at it, the bacteria just keep eating a person\x{2019}s flesh or blood or guts, sometimes to the death. The death of the patient is no dead end to the strain of bacteria, of course, if it has managed to infect other victims in the meantime. And the appearance of resistance to each drug so quickly, in one strain of bacteria and another, as occurred in the 1940s and 1950s, was a phenomenon that couldn\x{2019}t be explained by the slow Darwinian process of mutation, natural selection, and ordinary inheritance, occurring independently in each case. Darwinian selection was certainly involved, but selection can act only on variation: genetic differences between one individual and another. What was the source of the variation? Mutation alone couldn\x{2019}t account for the appearance of so many new genes, so fast, in so many different organisms. It had to be something else\x{2014}something that moved speedily and sideways, even between members of different bacterial species. Tsutomu Watanabe recognized the alternate explanation and, based on research by him and his Japanese colleagues, laid it out in English for the first time.",

            "The Japanese work began after World War II in response to an increase in cases of dysentery, an intestinal affliction resulting in bloody diarrhea and other symptoms. Postwar deprivation, dislocation, and disruption of sanitary and health services probably exacerbated the problem, but its proximate cause was a bacterium, Shigella dysenteriae. The preferred treatment at first involved various forms of sulfa drugs, but Shigella strains soon showed resistance to those sulfas, so medical people turned to newer antibiotics, such as streptomycin and tetracycline. By <<1953|9:0>>, strains of Shigella showed resistance also to both of those. Each bacterial strain, though, was resistant to only one drug. It could still be stopped by the others. Then in 1955 a Japanese woman returned from a stay in Hong Kong, sick with dysentery, and Shigella from her feces tested resistant to multiple antibiotics. From that point, resistance spread fast, shockingly fast, and during the late 1950s, Japan suffered a wave of dysentery outbreaks caused by Shigella superbugs resistant to four kinds of antibiotic: sulfas, streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Could these strains have acquired such multiple resistance so quickly by incremental mutations alone\x{2014}one misplaced A, C, G, or T at a time? The odds against that were so high you\x{2019}d need a string of twenty-eight zeros to print them. But if not, what was happening?",

            "What exactly was this packet of genes that traveled so easily across boundaries? Watanabe and a colleague, Toshio Fukasawa, in earlier work, had offered a hypothesis: it was an episome, a sort of autonomous genetic element that floats free within a bacterial cell, unattached to the cell\x{2019}s single circular chromosome. An episome is sublimely selfish DNA. It carries extra information beyond what\x{2019}s absolutely necessary to assemble and operate the cell. It codes for traits that might be useful in emergencies. It can hold multiple genes, exist in many copies within a cell, replicate independently apart from the chromosome, and send a copy of itself into another cell during conjugation. It might be lost entirely from a strain of bacteria when its genes aren\x{2019}t needed, because of changing environmental conditions, and then, when conditions shift again, reacquired from other strains. Wow: wildly mobile DNA. Esther Lederberg\x{2019}s F factor was such an episome, though she didn\x{2019}t realize that at the time of discovery. The concept didn\x{2019}t exist until <<1958|9c:0>>. But now Watanabe declared to the scientific world in his 1963 paper what Fukasawa and he had already said in Japanese: multiple resistance, to streptomycin and those three other antibiotics, was coded on an episome. They gave the episome a name: resistance transfer factor. It became known as R factor, for short, in parallel to Esther Lederberg\x{2019}s F factor.",

The upper heat limit for any form of life had been thought, by most microbiologists, to be about 73 degrees Celsius (163 Fahrenheit), until Brock went to Yellowstone in the mid-1960s. He found Thermus aquaticus, for instance, not at the very source of a hot spring but downstream along its outflow channel, at a relatively balmy 69 degrees C. But these pink filaments grew in the hottest part of Octopus Spring, at upward of 92 degrees C. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s fucking hot,\x{201d} Pace reminded me. Water boils at <<100|9c:0>>.
