We came to my house for tea and just talked and talked and talked of the wonderful days we spent at the Barracuda Beach Hotel back in \x{2019}62. Harold said he had a touch of gastritis and wanted to go straight to bed, couldn\x{2019}t walk so he said. Well, here it is <<10 in the am|5>> and he\x{2019}s still sleeping like a baby! I called the bank and told them he wouldn\x{2019}t be in this morning. I think his tummy needs a rest, frankly Ethel, and I just hate the thought of waking him up, so peaceful he looks.

In fact, it was the last thing his aunt gave anybody, since she died on the railroad platform waving goodbye to the seventeen-year-old Charlie Gibbon as his train pulled away bound for New Jersey. So the comb was special. He used the comb often. The strange and even sick part of it all was that he used it without a mirror. He would stand, one arm crooked over his head; his eyes on an object so distant that it had no name, and he would scrape away at his scalp with those five plastic teeth.',
