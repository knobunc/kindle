I\x{2019}m thinking of the meter reader rooting through the kitchen at <<eight A.M.|5>>, the Jehovah\x{2019}s Witness suddenly standing in your living room. \x{201c}Here,\x{201d} they seem to say. \x{201c}Use my eyes. The focus is much keener.\x{201d} I had always thought of our main room as cheerful, but walking through the door, I saw that I was mistaken. It wasn\x{2019}t dirty or messy, but like being awake when all decent people are fast asleep, there was something slightly suspicious about it. I looked at the Visible Man spread out on the table. The pieces lay in the shadow of a large taxidermied chicken that seemed to be regarding them, determining which organ might be the most appetizing. The table itself was pleasant to look at\x{2014}oak and hand-hewn\x{2014}but the chairs surrounding it were mismatched and in various states of disrepair. On the back of one hung a towel marked with the emblem of the Los Angeles County Coroner\x{2019}s Office. It had been a gift, not bought personally, but still it was there, leading the eye to an adjacent daybed, upon which lay two copies of a sordid true-crime magazine I purportedly buy to help me with my French. The cover of the latest issue pictured a young Belgian woman, a camper beaten to death with a cinder block. IS THERE A SERIAL KILLER IN YOUR REGION? the headline asked. The second copy was opened to the crossword puzzle I\x{2019}d attempted earlier in the evening. One of the clues translated to \x{201c}female sex organ,\x{201d} and in the space provided I had written the word for vagina. It was the first time I had ever answered a French crossword puzzle question, and in celebration I had marked the margins with bright exclamation points.",
