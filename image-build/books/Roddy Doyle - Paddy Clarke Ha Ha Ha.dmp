            "I polished everything in the house on Sunday mornings before we went to mass. My ma gave me a cloth, usually part of a  pair of old pyjamas. I started upstairs in their bedroom. I polished the dressing table and straightened her brushes. I wiped the top of the headrest. There was always loads of dust up there. It always left a mark on the cloth. I wiped as much of the picture of Jesus with his heart showing as I could reach. Jesus had his head tilted sideways, a bit like a kitten. The picture had my ma and da\x{2019}s names and the date they got married\x{2014}the twenty-fifth of July, <<nineteen fifty-seven|5k:0>> - and the dates of all our birthdays, except my youngest sister that my ma was only after having. The names were written in by Father Moloney. My name was the first; Patrick Joseph. Then my sister that had died; Angela Mary. She was dead before she came out of my ma. Then Sinbad; Francis David. Then my sister; Catherine Angela. There was a place left for my new sister. Her name was Deirdre. I was the oldest; the same name as my da. There was room for six more names. I wiped the stairs, all the way down, including the rails. I cleaned all the ornaments in the drawing room. I never broke anything. There was an old music box; you turned a key at the back and it played a song. There was a picture of sailors at the front. The felt material at the back was wearing away. It was my ma\x{2019}s. I didn\x{2019}t do the kitchen.",

            "I had a book on top of my head. I had to get up the stairs without it falling off. If it fell off I would die. It was a hardback book, heavy, the best kind for carrying on your head. I couldn\x{2019}t remember which one it was. I knew all the books in the house. I knew their shapes and smells. I knew what pages would open if I held them with the spine on the ground and let the sides drop. I knew all the books but I couldn\x{2019}t remember the name of the one on my head. I\x{2019}d find out when I got to the top, touched my bedroom door and got back down again. Then I could take it off my head - I\x{2019}d bring my head forward slowly and let it slide off and I\x{2019}d catch it\x{2014}and see what it was. I could have seen the corner of the cover if I\x{2019}d looked up very carefully; I could have got the name from the colour of the corner. But it was too dangerous. I had a mission to complete. Steady was better than too slow. If I went too slow I\x{2019}d go all unsteady and I\x{2019}d think I\x{2019}d never make it and the book would fall off. Death. There was a bomb in the book. Steady was best, steps <<one two|5l:0>>; no rush. Rushing was as bad as too slow. You panicked towards the end. Like Catherine walking across the living room. She walked fine for four or five steps, then you could see her face change because she saw that it was ages to go to the other side; her smile became a stretch, she knew she wouldn\x{2019}t make it, she tried to get there quicker, she fell. She knew she was  going to; her face got ready for it. She cried. Steady. Nearly at the top. The point of no return. Napoleon Solo. When you got to the top you had to get used to not having any more steps to go up; it was nearly like falling over.",
