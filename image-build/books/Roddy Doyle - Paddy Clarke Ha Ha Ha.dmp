It had the writing part in the middle and the seven men who\x{2019}d signed it around the sides. She stuck it up over the blackboard and let us up to see it one by one.

            "I polished everything in the house on Sunday mornings before we went to mass. My ma gave me a cloth, usually part of a  pair of old pyjamas. I started upstairs in their bedroom. I polished the dressing table and straightened her brushes. I wiped the top of the headrest. There was always loads of dust up there. It always left a mark on the cloth. I wiped as much of the picture of Jesus with his heart showing as I could reach. Jesus had his head tilted sideways, a bit like a kitten. The picture had my ma and da\x{2019}s names and the date they got married\x{2014}the twenty-fifth of July, <<nineteen fifty-seven|5k:1>> - and the dates of all our birthdays, except my youngest sister that my ma was only after having. The names were written in by Father Moloney. My name was the first; Patrick Joseph. Then my sister that had died; Angela Mary. She was dead before she came out of my ma. Then Sinbad; Francis David. Then my sister; Catherine Angela. There was a place left for my new sister. Her name was Deirdre. I was the oldest; the same name as my da. There was room for six more names. I wiped the stairs, all the way down, including the rails. I cleaned all the ornaments in the drawing room. I never broke anything. There was an old music box; you turned a key at the back and it played a song. There was a picture of sailors at the front. The felt material at the back was wearing away. It was my ma\x{2019}s. I didn\x{2019}t do the kitchen.",
