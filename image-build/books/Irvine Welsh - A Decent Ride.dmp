All the other cars are parked in the street outside, but, much to the chagrin of the bemused cemetery officials, the Rolls inches as close as it can to the gravestones, <<before two|9:0>> suited and overcoated male passengers exit ceremoniously. One is a gangster whom Terry knows as The Poof. He is accompanied by a younger, wily-eyed, narrow-featured man, who, to Terry\x{2019}s eye, appears too physically unimpressive to be a minder.",

Terry is too cold to wait for the closing hymn. He shuffles away and heads down the street to the Guilty Lily pub, where the reception will take place. He is the first person to get to the alehouse, and it\x{2019}s a relief to be in the warm on this foul, dreich day. Outside it is already pitch dark at barely <<4 p.m.|5>> A sombre barmaid points to a white-clothed table full of glasses of beer, whisky and wine, and another with a buffet of traditional funeral spread; the mini sausage rolls, the ham-and-cheese sandwiches. Terry hits the toilets, doing a livener before returning to get himself a bottle of beer. As he takes up position by the bar, the mourners file in. Terry, his eyes on Maggie\x{2019}s entrance, fails to notice Stevie\x{2019}s discord. As she moves elegantly over to the big fireplace, on the other side of the room, he wonders how long it will take her to come his way.",

            "Scotland\x{2019}s smokers have been praised for their heroism, standing up to extremely inhospitable elements in the form of the devastating hurricane known dismissively as \x{2018}Bawbag\x{2019} by locals. As the storm raged to its height <<around 1am|5>>, clusters of smokers spontaneously left the bars of Edinburgh\x{2019}s Grassmarket, where they struck up a rousing, defiant rendition of \x{2018}Flower of Scotland\x{2019}. But instead of standing against \x{2018}proud Edward\x{2019}s Army\x{2019}, as in Roy Williamson\x{2019}s famed lyric, they subsistuted this with \x{2018}Hurricane Bawbag\x{2019}. Plasterer Hugh Middleton, 58, said, \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve never seen anything like it. We just roared our song out into the night. Amazingly, the hurricane seemed to die out after that. So we really did send Bawbag \x{201c}homewards tae think again\x{201d}. I suppose the message is that if you come to Scotland, behave yourself and you\x{2019}ll be looked after.
