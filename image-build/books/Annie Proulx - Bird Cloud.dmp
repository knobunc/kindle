            'It was a summer of back and forth between Centennial and Saratoga with easement papers, permits, right-of-way documents, then, in August, the long trip to Newfoundland and a decision to sell the old house there that I had spent more than a decade renovating. The travel to the Great Northern Peninsula was arduous and tiresome, the visit too short, as always. I chopped wood, peeled bark off the logs on the boat slipway, freed the ax from a clenched junk of wood and hiked the Raven Trail. The house was in the Atlantic boreal region where the salinity of the open sea was around 35 percent, but inshore a little less from freshwater streams and rivers. In the tidal pools east of our wharf there was black whip weed, unknown this far north <<before 1928|18:0>> (another proof of climate change?), laver, rockweed with its paired air bladders, northern rock barnacles, acorn barnacles, minuscule snails best appreciated under a magnifying glass, tiny reddish worms. In slightly deeper water were millions of blue mussels and green sea urchins, one or two purple starfish, a few moon and purple jellyfish. The year before there had been many jellyfish, but this year only a few.',

            "Walking near Jack Creek in the fading autumn light I noticed that the beaver of last year had not returned, washed out by the June flood although its dams were still partially there. <<About five|9:0>> ducks\x{2014}too fast to identify, probably goldeneyes\x{2014}were in the creek as I neared the bridge. Two deer ran east and six magpies sat on six fence posts. A cloud of gnats rose from the water. I heard a hawk\x{2019}s hoarse call but could not see the bird. The air was so calm that flying was probably laborious, and when a light breeze slipped in\x{2014}not from the west but out of the east\x{2014}a big redtail climbed up to play along the cliff face, then dropped down to skim low. On the way back I stopped where the top of an old cottonwood, broken off by lightning or wind, landed upside down, branches pronged deep into the soil. The bark was almost two inches thick and very deeply furrowed. What service does such thick, furrowed bark perform for the tree? In the river a huge trout leapt five feet out of the water. Was it chased by a bigger trout? Could there be a bigger trout? Or was it making an impossible try to snag the low-flying redtail?",

We set up camp, then explored, looking for minerals and fossils before cooking dinner and building the campfire. A wild stallion showed up in an aggressive mood. He snorted a few times, then galloped away. Overnight the wind began to rise and by the next morning we could look south toward Colorado and see great plumes of dust bowling along the ground like desert djinns. There was an uneasy, ghost-ridden feel to the place. These dust devils were not uncommon in the desert, but had increased in number as gas energy drill rigs and work trucks broke up the cryptobiotic crust that holds the fine soil in place. We escaped from the wind by going down into a huge wash framed by sandstone towers topped with pink hats and continued to explore. The wash was packed with eroded caves, strange formations, pebbles and domes, gullies and pale walls. I saw a parent hawk carry a rabbit to its nest behind one of the towers.",

            "Under the terrific killing pressure the game began to dwindle. The near extinction of some species is an ugly story embedded in our history. Today the human effect on wildlife numbers is a popular subject of scientific study. There is continuing controversy about the cause of the extinction of the woolly mammoth (and other megafauna) around the time humans arrived in North America. Briefly (passing over the complex details of evidence and rival theories), for some it was climate change\x{2014}a warming period\x{2014}that modified the ecosystem in ways unfavorable for the vegetation that nurtured mammoths and horses. Evidence from the examination of exhumed dung from these giant animals shows a precipitous drop in the percentages of spores of the fungus Sporormiella after 10,800 B.P., indicating a change in climate and a long decline that ended in extinction. Others believe that incoming human predators from the west, expert hunters who took advantage of the animals\x{2019} na\x{ef}vet\x{e9}, were major players in the inevitable depletion of mammoth stocks. While a more arid climate may have been the operative factor, it is difficult to ignore how rapidly human hunters can decimate animal populations. We have the example of Wyoming: this was an incredibly rich hunting ground with more than a hundred thousand pronghorn when whites, with their technologically superior weapons for mass killing, came into the country in numbers in the 1860s. By <<1910|9n:0>> the nascent Game and Fish Department counted only seven thousand pronghorn antelope in the state.",

            "In late May 1914, the sixty-one-year-old Seton-Karr, still fit from a lifetime of athletic adventures, enjoyed a successful climbing holiday in British Columbia and was on his way back to London. In Qu\x{e9}bec City he boarded the S.S. Empress of Ireland, a Canadian Pacific Railway luxury ocean liner on which he had his usual first-class accommodations. The ship, with fifteen hundred passengers, and fitted with sufficient lifeboats after the tragedy of the Titanic two years before, sailed in late afternoon, heading east down the St. Lawrence Seaway. An hour and a <<half after midnight|10>> the pilot left the ship at Rimouski and the Empress steamed toward the open Atlantic. Very soon after the pilot left, Captain Henry George Kendall, on his first trip with the Empress, saw a low-lying collier coming up the river. The coal carrier, S.S. Storstad, from Sydney, Nova Scotia, was heavily laden. Exactly what happened next is still not clear, as heavy spring fog blanked out everything and the accounts given at the later investigation varied. The Storstad somehow rammed the Empress amidships. The beautiful liner sank in fourteen minutes. So swiftly did she go down there was not enough time to launch more than a few lifeboats. Among the 1,012 people who lost their lives was Henry Seton-Karr, but a New York Times report on the tragedy depicted him as a hero who gave his life jacket to a man who had none, saying confidently that he would get another. He didn\x{2019}t.",

            'Walking induces a trancelike state that allows the mind freedom and ease and encourages exploration of odd possibilities and improbable connections. I walked every day, for the mind as well as the body. On that first solitary day at Bird Cloud, I walked east to the Jack Creek bridge and looked up at a big empty nest high on the cliff across the river. It was clearly an eagle nest. Had the bald eagles used it before moving half a mile west to the cottonwoods? Had it belonged to another pair of eagles? The huge structure was heaped with snow. Somehow it had a fierce look, black and bristling with stick ends. At <<4:30|2>> sunlight still plated the cliff with gold light. Ten minutes later it had faded to cardboard grey. I looked again at the distant nest, then noticed that on the debris pile of colluvium below and a little to the west of the nest there were two elk. They were likely refugees from a big herd that had moved through the property several weeks earlier. Twenty or thirty geese flew upriver high enough to be out of gun range. Dusk thickened, and then, in the gloaming, I saw a large bird fly into a cranny directly above the elk. Roosting time for someone, but who?',

I wanted badly to get a good look at it, but it seemed to fly past only when my head was turned.

At first sight I could imagine they were the mountain sheep that used to live on the cliff in Indian times. Their faces seemed rather dished, like sheep faces. Magpies were busy across the river, and one raven sat in a tree slightly to the west of their nest site in the cliff.

I wondered about the ravens. Shouldn\x{2019}t they at least be bringing twigs to the nest ledge? Ehrlich, Dobkin and Wheye said that the male, with some help from the female, builds the nest; that she lays <<four to six|10a:0>> eggs; that they both sit on the eggs; that incubation is eighteen to twenty-one days and that the young fly after thirty-eight to forty-four days. So, if they fly, as they have the past two years, around Memorial Day, then they must hatch around April 20\x{2013}25, and the eggs must be laid the first week in April. They are monogamous birds. Late in the afternoon, as if it had read my thoughts, one raven appeared, sailing around the cliff, legs hanging down as though prepared to land. It flew into the deep chimney to the west of the old nest site several times. That would be a better place to nest if the ravens wanted more privacy and shelter from the southwest winds, but for me the view would not be good. The elk were still around.",
