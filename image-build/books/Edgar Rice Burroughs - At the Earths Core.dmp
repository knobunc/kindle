it were but yesterday the night of that momentous occasion upon which we were
to test the practicality of that wondrous invention.\x{a0} It was <<near midnight|3b>> when we repaired to the
lofty tower in which Perry had constructed his       iron mole       as he was
wont to call the thing.\x{a0} The great nose
rested upon the bare earth of the floor.\x{a0}
We passed through the doors into the outer jacket, secured them, and

our nostrils were assailed by almost overpowering ammonia fumes, and the

We suffered nearly two hours of this intense and bitter cold, until at
about two hundred and forty-five miles from the surface of the earth we entered
stratum of solid ice, when the mercury quickly rose to 32 degrees.\x{a0} During the next three hours we passed through

withal it is very simple, David.\x{a0} The
earth was once a nebulous mass.\x{a0} It
cooled, and as it cooled it shrank.\x{a0} At
length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon its outer surface--a sort of
shell; but within it was partially molten matter and highly expanded
gases.\x{a0} As it continued to cool, what
happened?\x{a0} Centrifugal force hurled the
particles of the nebulous center toward the crust as rapidly as they approached
a solid state.\x{a0} You have seen the same
principle practically applied in the modern cream separator.\x{a0} Presently there was only a small super-heated
core of gaseous matter remaining within a huge vacant interior left by the
contraction of the cooling gases.\x{a0} The
equal attraction of the solid crust from all directions maintained this
luminous core in the exact center of the hollow globe.\x{a0} What remains of it is the sun you saw
today--a relatively tiny thing at the exact center of the earth.\x{a0} Equally to every part of this inner world it
diffuses its perpetual <<noonday|13>> light and torrid heat.",

beneath a stationary sun.\x{a0} Already I was

If we fell we were prodded with a sharp point.\x{a0} Our companions in chains did not
stumble.\x{a0} They strode along proudly
erect.\x{a0} Occasionally they would exchange
words with one another in a monosyllabic language.\x{a0} They were a noble-appearing race with
well-formed heads and perfect physiques.\x{a0}
The men were heavily bearded, tall and muscular; the women, smaller and
more gracefully molded, with great masses of raven hair caught into loose knots
upon their heads.\x{a0} The features of both
sexes were well proportioned--there was not a face among them that would have
been called even plain if judged by earthly standards.\x{a0} They wore no ornaments; but this I later
learned was due to the fact that their captors had stripped them of everything
of value.\x{a0} As garmenture
the women possessed a single robe of some light-colored, spotted hide, rather
similar in appearance to a leopard's skin.\x{a0}
This they wore either supported entirely about the waist by a leathern
thong, so that it hung partially below the knee on one side, or possibly looped
gracefully across one shoulder.\x{a0} Their
feet were shod with skin sandals.\x{a0} The
men wore loin cloths of the hide of some shaggy beast, long ends of which
depended before and behind nearly to the ground.\x{a0} In some instances these ends were finished
with the strong talons of the beast from which the hides had been taken.",
