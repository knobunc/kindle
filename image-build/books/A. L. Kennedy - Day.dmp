Meanwhile, the actors had this or that to say and this or that to do \x{2013} he was too far away to catch the details. Then along came <<10.56|5a:0>> and the colour dropped out of his morning, while his head pulled him down and forward through the usual, opening hole and he tried to slacken out his limbs, to roll into the impact he wouldn\x{2019}t feel.",

He\x{2019}d sat with his ma in the kitchen \x{2013} she couldn\x{2019}t go to chapel because of the pain in her leg and that wasn\x{2019}t good, it made a familiar rawness in at the back of his thoughts, still Alfred and his ma, they kept things cheery. They were fine. They were being comfy together and they\x{2019}d eaten their sausage, eggs and bacon, not talking much because they never had to, and everything today could be late and slow \x{2013} they\x{2019}d get away with that \x{2013} and they were having extra toast \x{2013} he didn\x{2019}t know then she made the best bread he\x{2019}d ever taste \x{2013} and the house would be at rest for another two hours, at least. The back door was open and the smell of their last roses coming in and a wedge of sunshine fallen down into the hall with the cat lying in it and purring, you could tell by the set of his head before you even heard a sound. Then Chamberlain comes on the wireless and Alfred had never liked him, never taken to the tone of him \x{2013} the way he seemed like some thin, grey relative you wouldn\x{2019}t want to sit with, all his sentences fading away and breaking if his voice went low and everything being so sad and hard for him, even though there were other people in the world who weren\x{2019}t enjoying themselves that much. Like the Czechs. Or the Poles. You could bet they weren\x{2019}t happy. But here was Chamberlain in the Cabinet room \x{2013} which Alfred imagined to be like a kind of parlour: Mansion Polish and china dogs \x{2013} and he was saying in his pretty accent that he\x{2019}d had a bitter blow and there was nothing else for it now but to be at war. He\x{2019}d needed to hear from the Germans by <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> and <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> was gone. Which suited Alfred nicely, thanks ever so much.",
