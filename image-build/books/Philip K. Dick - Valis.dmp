            "It looked like an ordinary pot: squat and light brown, with a small amount of blue glaze as trim. Stephanie was not an expert potter. This pot was one of the first she threw, at least outside of her ceramics class in high school. Naturally, one of her first pots would go to Fat. She and he had a close relationship. When he\x{2019}d get upset, Stephanie would quiet him down by supercharging him with her hashpipe. The pot was unusual in one way, however. In it slumbered God. He slumbered in the pot for a long time, for almost too long. There is a theory among some religions that God intervenes at the eleventh hour. Maybe that is so; I couldn\x{2019}t say. In Horselover Fat\x{2019}s case God waited until <<three minutes before twelve|10>>, and even then what he did was barely enough: barely enough and virtually too late. You can\x{2019}t hold Stephanie responsible for that; she threw the pot, glazed it and fired it as soon as she had the kickwheel. She did her best to help her friend Fat, who, like Gloria before him, was beginning to die. She helped her friend the way Fat had tried to help his friend, only Stephanie did a better job. But that was the difference between her and Fat. In a crisis she knew what to do. Fat did not. Therefore Fat is alive today and Gloria is not. Fat had a better friend than Gloria had had. Perhaps he would have wanted it the other way around but the option was not his. We do not serve up people to ourselves; the universe does. The universe makes certain decisions and on the basis of those decisions some people live and some people die. This is a harsh law. But every creature yields to it out of necessity. Fat got God, and Gloria Knudson got death. It is unfair and Fat would be the first person to say so. Give him credit for that.",

            "Yet, in all fairness, I have to admit that God \x{2013} or someone calling himself God, a distinction of mere semantics \x{2013} had fired precious information at Horselover Fat\x{2019}s head by which their son Christopher\x{2019}s life had been saved. Some people God cures and some he slays. Fat denies that God slays anyone. Fat says, God never harms anyone. Illness, pain and undeserved suffering arise not from God but from elsewhere, to which I say, How did this elsewhere arise? Are there two gods? Or is part of the universe out from under God\x{2019}s control? Fat used to quote Plato. In Plato\x{2019}s cosmology, no\x{f6}s or Mind is persuading ananke or blind necessity \x{2013} or blind chance, according to some experts \x{2013} into submission. No\x{f6}s happened to come along and to its surprise discovered blind chance: chaos, in other words, onto which no\x{f6}s imposes order (although how this \x{2018}persuading\x{2019} is done Plato nowhere says). According to Fat, my friend\x{2019}s cancer consisted of disorder not yet persuaded into sentient shape. No\x{f6}s or God had not yet gotten around to her, to which I said, \x{2018}Well, when he did get around to her it was too late.\x{2019} Fat had no answer for that, at least in terms of oral rebuttal. Probably he sneaked off and wrote about it in his journal. He stayed up to <<four A.M.|5>> every night scratching away in his journal. I suppose all the secrets of the universe lay in it somewhere amid the rubble.",
