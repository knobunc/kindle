            "Station WOKO (they might have dreamed up a grander call-sign!) in Albany, the capital of New York State and about fifty miles due south of where I was, announced that it was <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>>. The weather report that followed included a storm warning with gale-force winds. The storm was moving down from the north and would hit Albany <<around eight p.m.|9h>> That meant that I would be having a noisy night. I didn\x{2019}t mind. Storms don\x{2019}t frighten me, and although the nearest living soul, as far as I knew, was ten miles away up the not very good secondary road to Lake George, the thought of the pines that would soon be thrashing outside, the thunder and lightning and rain, made me already feel snug and warm and protected in anticipation. And alone! But above all alone! \x{2018}Loneliness becomes a lover, solitude a darling sin.\x{2019} Where had I read that? Who had written it? It was so exactly the way I felt, the way that, as a child, I had always felt until I had forced myself to \x{2018}get into the swim\x{2019}, \x{2018}be one of the crowd\x{2019} \x{2013} a good sort, on the ball, hep. And what a hash I had made of \x{2018}togetherness\x{2019}! I shrugged the memory of failure away. Everyone doesn\x{2019}t have to live in a heap. Painters, writers, musicians are lonely people. So are statesmen and admirals and generals. But then, I added to be fair, so are criminals and lunatics. Let\x{2019}s just say, not to be too flattering, that true individuals are lonely. It\x{2019}s not a virtue, the reverse if anything. One ought to share and communicate if one is to be a useful member of the tribe. The fact that I was so much happier when I was alone was surely the sign of a faulty, a neurotic character. I had said this so often to myself in the past five years that now, that evening, I just shrugged my shoulders and, hugging my solitude to me, walked across the big lobby to the door and went out to have a last look at the evening.",

            "Five acres or so of these stupid trees had been cleared to build the motel, which is all that this place really was. \x{2018}Motel\x{2019} isn\x{2019}t a good word any longer. It has become smart to use \x{2018}Motor Court\x{2019} or \x{2018}Ranch Cabins\x{2019} ever since motels became associated with prostitution, gangsters and murders, for all of which their anonymity and lack of supervision is a convenience. The site, tourist-wise, in the lingo of the trade, was a good one. There was this wandering secondary road through the forest, which was a pleasant alternative route between Lake George and Glens Falls to the south, and halfway along it was a small lake, cutely called Dreamy Waters, that is a traditional favourite with picnickers. It was on the southern shore of this lake that the motel had been built, its reception lobby facing the road with, behind this main building, the rooms fanning out in a semicircle. There were forty rooms with kitchen, shower and lavatory, and they all had some kind of a view of the lake behind them. The whole construction and design was the latest thing \x{2013} glazed pitch-pine frontages and pretty timber roofs all over knobbles, air-conditioning, television in every cabin, children\x{2019}s playground, swimming pool, golf range out over the lake with floating balls (fifty balls, one dollar) \x{2013} all the gimmicks. Food? Cafeteria in the lobby, and grocery and liquor deliveries twice a day from Lake George. All this for ten dollars single and sixteen double. No wonder that, with around two hundred thousand dollars\x{2019} capital outlay and a season lasting only from July the first to the beginning of October, or, so far as the NO VACANCY sign was concerned, from July fourteenth to Labour Day, the owners were finding the going hard. Or so those dreadful Phanceys had told me when they\x{2019}d taken me on as receptionist for only thirty dollars a week plus keep. Thank heavens they were out of my hair! Song in my heart? There had been the whole heavenly choir at <<six o\x{2019}clock that morning|6>> when their shiny station-wagon had disappeared down the road on their way to Glens Falls and then to Troy where the monsters came from. Mr Phancey had made a last grab at me and I hadn\x{2019}t been quick enough. His free hand had run like a fast lizard over my body before I had crunched my heel into his instep. He had let go then. When his contorted face had cleared, he said softly, \x{2018}All right, sex-box. Just see that you mind camp good until the boss comes to take over the keys tomorrow <<midday|13>>. Happy dreams tonight.\x{2019} Then he had grinned a grin I hadn\x{2019}t understood, and had gone over to the station-wagon where his wife had been watching from the driver\x{2019}s seat. \x{2018}Come on, Jed,\x{2019} she had said sharply. \x{2018}You can work off those urges on West Street tonight,\x{2019} She put the car in gear and called over to me sweetly, \x{2018}\x{2019}Bye now, cutie-pie. Write us every day.\x{2019} Then she had wiped the crooked smile off her face and I caught a last glimpse of her withered, hatchet profile as the car turned out on to the road. Phew! What a couple! Right out of a book \x{2013} and what a book! Dear Diary! Well, people couldn\x{2019}t come much worse, and now they\x{2019}d gone. From now on, on my travels, the human race must improve!",

Then I ran across the short covered way to the cabins out back and went into mine, Number 9 on the right-hand side towards the lake, and took off my clothes and had a cold shower.

            "Of course, I was thrilled. The \x{2018}400\x{2019} is the top night club in London and I had never graduated higher than the cellar places in Chelsea. I told him a bit about myself and made Astor House sound funny and he was very easy to talk to, and when the bill came he knew exactly how much to tip and it seemed to me that he was very grown-up to be still at school, but then English public schools are supposed to grow people up very quickly and teach them how to behave. He held my hand in the taxi, and that seemed to be all right, and they seemed to know him at the \x{2018}400\x{2019} and it was deliciously dark and he ordered gins and tonics and they put a half bottle of gin on the table that was apparently his from the last time he had been there. Maurice Smart\x{2019}s band was as smooth as cream and when we danced we fitted at once and his jive was just about the same as mine and I was really having fun. I began to notice the way his dark hair grew at the temples and that he had good hands and that he smiled not just at one\x{2019}s face but into one\x{2019}s eyes. We stayed there until <<four in the morning|5>> and the gin was finished and when we went out on to the pavement I had to hold on to him. He got a taxi and it seemed natural when he took me in his arms, and when he kissed me I kissed back. After I had twice taken his hand off my breast, the third time it seemed prissy not to leave it there, but when he moved it down and tried to put it up my skirt, I wouldn\x{2019}t let him, and when he took my hand and tried to put it on him I wouldn\x{2019}t do that either, although my whole body was hot with wanting these things. But then, thank heavens, we were outside the flat and he got out and took me to the door and we said we would see each other again and he would write. When we kissed goodbye, he put his hand down behind my back and squeezed my behind hard, and when his taxi disappeared round the corner I could still feel his hand there and I crept up to bed and looked into the mirror over the washbasin and my eyes and face were radiant as if they were lit up from inside and, although probably most of the lighting-up came from the gin, I thought, \x{2018}Oh, my heavens!

            "Derek\x{2019}s last term came to an end and we had exchanged four letters each. His first one had begun \x{2018}Dearest\x{2019} and ended with love and kisses, and I had compromised with \x{2018}Dear\x{2019} and \x{2018}love\x{2019}. His were mostly about how many runs he had made, and mine were about the dances I had been to and the cinemas and plays I had seen. He was going to spend the summer at his home, and he was very excited about a second-hand MG his parents were going to give him and would I come out with him in it? Susan was surprised when I said that I wouldn\x{2019}t be coming up to Scotland and that I wanted to stay on in the flat at any rate for the time being. I hadn\x{2019}t told her the truth about Derek, and because I always got up earlier than her, she didn\x{2019}t know about his letters. It wasn\x{2019}t like me to be secretive, but I treasured my \x{2018}love-affair\x{2019} as I described it to myself, and it seemed to be so fragile and probably full of disappointments that I thought even to talk about it might bring it bad luck. For all I knew I might be just one in a whole row of Derek\x{2019}s girls. He was so attractive and grand, at any rate at school, that I imagined a long queue of \x{2018}Mayfair\x{2019} sisters, all in organdie and all with titles, at his beck and call. So I simply said that I wanted to look around for a job and perhaps I would come up later, and in due course Susan went north and a fifth letter came from Derek saying would I come down next Saturday on the <<twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>> from Paddington and he would meet me with the car at Windsor station?",

I became a sort of Universal Aunt to the two of them, and I would have found the role ridiculous if it hadn\x{2019}t all seemed quite natural and rather fun \x{2013} like having two big dolls to play at \x{2018}Weddings\x{2019} with. Kurt had even planned their sex life minutely and the details which he insisted, rather perversely, on sharing with me, were at first embarrassing and then, because he was so clinical about the whole subject, highly educative. On the honeymoon in Venice (all Germans go to Italy for their honeymoons) they would of course do it every night because, Kurt said, it was most important that \x{2018}the act\x{2019} should be technically perfect and, to achieve this, much practice was necessary. To this end, they would have a light dinner, because a full stomach was not desirable, and they would retire not later than <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> because it was important to have at least eight hours\x{2019} sleep \x{2018}to recharge the batteries\x{2019}. Trude, he said, was unawakened and inclined to be \x{2018}k\x{fc}hl\x{2019} sexually, while he was of a passionate temperament. So there would have to be much preliminary sex-play to bring the curve of her passion up to his. This would need restraint on his part, and in this matter he would have to be firm with himself, for as he told me, it was essential to a happy marriage that the climax should be reached simultaneously by the partners. Only thus could the thrilling summits of Ekstase become the equal property of both. After the honeymoon they would sleep together on Wednesdays and Saturdays. To do it more often would weaken his \x{2018}batteries\x{2019} and might reduce his efficiency at the \x{2018}B\x{fc}ro\x{2019}.

This suitcase would in fact contain nothing but a full set of precision tools, together with false licence plates for their roomy station-wagon that would be parked in the car-port alongside their cabin door. After locking themselves in and waiting for the lights to go out in the office, the couple would set to work on inconspicuous things like loosening the screws of the bathroom fixtures, testing the anchoring of the TV set and so on. Once the management had gone to bed, they would really get down to it, making neat piles of bedding, towels and shower curtains, dismantling light-fixtures, bed-frames, lavatory-seats and even the lavatories themselves if they had plumbing knowledge. They worked in darkness of course, with pencil torches, and, when everything was ready, say <<around two in the morning|9h>>, they would quietly carry everything through the door into the car-port and pile it into the station-wagon.

I had a couple of guns, heavy ones that really stop people, and at <<ten to twelve|10>> I took up my position to the right of the door in an angle of solid masonry and got ready just in case Uhlmann or one of the hoodlums managed to bust through the Mounties across the passage. To tell you the truth, as the minutes went by and I could imagine the killer car coming down the street and the men piling out and running softly up the stairs, I wished I had accepted the Mounties\x{2019} offer that one of their men should share this vigil, as they called it, with me. But it would have been a five-hour t\x{ea}te-\x{e0}-t\x{ea}te and, apart from not knowing what we would talk about during all that time, I\x{2019}ve always had a preference for operating alone. It\x{2019}s just the way I\x{2019}m made. Well, the minutes and the seconds ticked by and then, bang on time, at <<five minutes to midnight|10>>, I heard a rush of rubber soles on the stairs and then all hell broke loose.\x{2019}",
