St. Mary of Egypt was indeed a repentant prostitute, but she lived in the fourth century. Sima goes on to quote hymns from the <<matins|13>> of Holy Wednesday, the middle of Holy Week, in which the woman with the alabaster vessel confesses to having been a harlot. The longest of these hymns, from which Sima quotes most fully, known as \x{201c}The Hymn of Cassia,\x{201d} is attributed to the Byzantine abbess and hymnographer Cassia (ca. 805\x{2013}867).
