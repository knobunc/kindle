            '"Shit," she moaned quietly, "shit!" She sat down on the bed and rested her head in her hands, her energy and will to resist fading frighteningly fast. It had been a long and terrible day, and even standing up felt like a battle. What have I done? Erasmus was nuts, or playing a sick joke on her, sending her to a brothel to talk to the madam: although, on further thought, it didn\'t seem particularly strange compared to the rest of this eventful day. She\'d been dragged out of her house arrest, shanghaied into a forced wedding, just missed being blown up by a bomb, seen the king and the prince she\'d been engaged to gunned down (and who knew what the hell was going to happen in the Gruinmarkt now?) and run into an old heartthrob (and what the hell was he doing there, working for the DEA?). Then she\'d lied for her life, been attacked by muggers, menaced by a cabbie who thought she was a prostitute, and finally locked up in another goddamned prison cell, this time in a brothel. I\'m going to go mad, she thought dizzily, lying down on the lumpy mattress. I can\'t take much more of this. But instead, she fell asleep. And that was how they found her when they came for her, <<an hour after midnight|10>>.',

            'The room was maybe twenty feet long and eight feet wide, with a ten-foot ceiling. Naked unpainted cinder block walls, a galvanized tin ceiling, and a concrete floor completed the scene. There was a big rolling door at one end and dust everywhere. But what caught her attention was the sheer size of the cylinder that, standing on concrete blocks, dominated the room. "Sweet baby Jesus," she whispered. It was at least ten feet long, and had to be a good four feet in diameter. There was barely room to walk around the behemoth. She shone her torch along the cylinder, expecting to see-"what the hell?" "Herz, report! What have you seen?" "It\'s a cylinder," she said slowly. "<<About ten|9:1>>, twelve feet long, four, five feet in diameter. Supported on concrete blocks. One end is rounded; there\'s some kind of collar about three feet from the other end and four vanes sticking out, sort of like the fins on \'a bomb..." She trailed off. Like the fins on a bomb, she thought, dazed. Jesus, this can\'t be here! She shook herself and continued, "there\'s some kind of equipment trolley near the back end, and some wires going into the, the back of the bomb." She glanced down at her watch. The second hand was spinning round. It was a logarithmic counter, and it had jumped from tens of becquerels per second to tens of thousands as she crossed the threshold. Gamma emission from secondary activation isotopes created by neutron absorption, she heard the lecture replay in her mind\'s eye; Geiger counters can\'t detect neutrons until the flux is way too high for safety, but over lime a neutron source will tend to activate surrounding materials. "I\'m reading secondaries. I think we\'ve got a hot one. I\'m coming out now." A quick sweep across the screen door in front of the gadget\'s nose revealed no telltale trip wires. "No sign of booby traps."',
