In the fridge, sandwich fixings, Filipino single-serving ice cream cones, pre-made boba tea with huge pearls of tapioca in it, and cans of Starbucks frappucino. He helped himself, snitching it all into a shoulder-bag he\x{2019}d brought along, scurrying back to his den to scarf it down.",

If he\x{2019}d done the math right, it was <<about 6AM|5>> at their longitude, which should be just about directly in line with New Zealand. Which meant the sun would be up, and the crew would no doubt be swarming on deck, surveying the damage and securing the remaining containers as best as they could with the ship\x{2019}s little crane and tractors. And that meant that he\x{2019}d have to stay put, amid the puke and the bad air and the mess, wait until that ship\x{2019}s night or maybe even the next night. And he had no WiFi, either.",

And that\x{2019}s when the magic began. By back-dating the books, the broker could assign the shitty trades to shitty customers, cheapskates, or big, locked-in, slow-moving customers, like loosely-managed estates for long-dead people whose wealth was held in trust. The gains could be written to the broker\x{2019}s best customers, like some billionaire that the broker was hoping to do more business with. In this way, every broker got a certain amount of discretion every day in choosing who would make money and who would lose it. It was just a larger version of the barista at the coffee shop slipping her regulars a large instead of a medium every now and again, without charging for the upgrade. The partners who ran the brokerages knew that this was going on, and so did many of the customers. It was impossible to prove that you\x{2019}d lost money or gained money this way\x{2014}unless your broker told you at <<9:15|2>> on a Tuesday morning that your account would have an extra \$20,000 in it by <<5PM|5>>.",
