In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer\x{2019}s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men\x{2019}s stiff collars wilted by <<nine in the morning|5>>. Ladies bathed <<before noon|13>>, after their <<three-o\x{2019}clock|6>> naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.",
