            "On a Monday night, January 23, 1978, that local police confidence had translated into a call to Russ from a small department north of Sacramento. A terrible homicide had been committed, one that was far beyond the ordinary murder in terms of the violence done to the victim. David Wallin, twenty-four, a laundry-truck driver, had returned to his modest suburban rented home after work, <<about six|3d>> on the evening of January 23, and found his twenty-two-year-old, three-months-pregnant wife, Terry, in the bedroom, dead, with her abdomen slashed. He ran screaming to a neighbor\x{2019}s house, and that neighbor called the police. Wallin was so upset that he could not talk to the authorities when they arrived. The first policeman who entered the home, a sheriff\x{2019}s deputy, was similarly shocked. Later, the deputy said that he had nightmares for months from viewing the carnage.",

That Monday morning, she\x{2019}d cashed a check at a shopping center within walking distance of her home, and there was speculation that the killer had seen her do that and had followed her home. Her mother had called Terry\x{2019}s home at <<one-thirty in the afternoon|5>> and had gotten no answer, and the coroner\x{2019}s office said Terry had been killed prior to that time. The coroner\x{2019}s office also was of the opinion that some of the stab wounds had been inflicted prior to Terry\x{2019}s death, but that fact was not told to the public.

At <<about 12:30 P.M.|2a>>, a neighbor had discovered three bodies in a suburban home that was within a mile of the Wallin murder. Dead were Evelyn Miroth, thirty-six, her six-year-old son, Jason, and Daniel J.

All the dead had been shot, and Evelyn Miroth had been slashed in a manner similar to Mrs. Wallin.

The house was reported as not having been ransacked.

Once she had fallen asleep, at <<five in the morning|9a>>, Kemper took a claw hammer from the kitchen and, as he had done so often in his imagination, went into her bedroom while she slept. This time, he actually brought the hammer down with considerable force on her right temple, then slashed her throat with his pocketknife. Blood was still gushing from her as he decided to sever the head as he had done with his other victims. Another slice removed her larynx, and he threw this part into the disposal unit in the kitchen sink. When the disposal was unable to digest the larynx and spewed it back out, Kemper thought this was poetic justice. He wrapped the body in the bloody sheets and stashed it in the closet.",

During those years of the early 1970s, the Bureau had opened the new FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, the last positive legacy of J.

Ken Joseph had been tapped to come to headquarters and help in the setting up of the Quantico programs, and in 1974, he pulled me in from Cleveland. At the FBI National Academy (FBINA), I began as a class counselor for the visiting policemen; each instructor handled about fifty students, shepherding them through the several-month program. By June of 1974, I was convinced that I should make a stay at Quantico part of my FBI resume; the academic environment was attractive, as was the beautiful Virginia countryside, and I also thought that a stint at Quantico was imperative if I was to go up the ladder into higher FBI management. Another factor luring me to Quantico was the fledgling Behavioral Sciences Unit, then consisting mainly of two senior men, Howard Teten and Pat Mullany, a Mutt and Jeff team. They always taught together, and were quite a pair, with Teten the six-seven, thin straight man and Mullany the <<five-ten|5k:0>>, slightly chubby comic. Teten, quiet, low-key, and methodical, and Mullany, quick and energetic, devoted most of their time to teaching, but now and then analyzed a violent crime and \x{201c}profiled\x{201d} the appearance and behavior of likely suspects.

He tortured small animals such as mice and moths. All of these were control fantasies, involving power over living things. Berkowitz also confided to me his fantasies about wishing to cause fiery air crashes. He had actually never interfered with an airplane, but arson was a logical extension of this fantasy. Most arsonists like the feeling that they are responsible for the excitement and violence of a fire. With the simple act of lighting matches, they control events in society that are not normally controlled; they orchestrate the fire, the screaming arrival and deployment of the fire trucks and fire fighters, the gathering crowds, the destruction of property and sometimes of people. Berkowitz loved to watch bodies being carried out of burning buildings. These fires were all a prelude to his moving into the arena in which he could exercise the ultimate in control, homicide. Here was a man who obtained his biggest thrills in life from sitting at home and watching the news on television as it reported his latest killing and the fear that he caused to grip the city.",

            "Potential murderers became solidified in their loneliness first during the age period of eight to twelve; such isolation is considered the single most important aspect of their psychological makeup. Many factors go into fashioning this isolation. Among the most important is the absence of a father. When there\x{2019}s no father or father figure present for an eight- or ten- or twelve-year-old boy, this is embarrassing for the child in front of his peers. He begins to avoid friends, to avoid situations in which father-and-son teams are usually present, such as Little League or the Boy Scouts. His preadolescent sexual activity, rather than being connected to other human beings, starts as autoerotic. More than three-quarters of the murderers we investigated began autoerotic sexual practices as preadolescents; half reported rape fantasies occurring between the ages of twelve and fourteen; more than 80 percent admitted to using pornography, and to tendencies toward fetishism and voyeurism. Again, we must realize that many boys grow up in homes without a father and do not turn into sociopaths; but for the ones who do become sociopaths, the <<eight-to-twelve|10a:1>> period is critical. Investigation often leads back to just this time, and the set of circumstances in which the father figure is absent, as the period when bizarre behavior began.",

            "The house that she described to the police belonged to John Brennan Crutchley, thirty-nine, a computer engineer for the Harris Corporation, a NASA contractor. He was married and had one child; both his wife and child were in Maryland, visiting her family for the holidays. A search warrant was obtained and served on Crutchley\x{2019}s home at <<two-thirty|5b>> the next morning. During this serving, Crutchley was arrested, some obvious items of interest were seized, and photographs were taken of the residence. The hitchhiker initially did not want to file charges against Crutchley, but she was convinced to do so by a rape counselor, on the grounds that convicting Crutchley would prevent him from assaulting other women. The victim took and passed a lie-detector test about the rapes, and Crutchley was charged with sexual battery, kidnapping, and aggravated battery of the hitchhiker, as well as possession of marijuana and of drug paraphernalia.",

A search of the area between her home and the friend\x{2019}s home turned up one of Debra\x{2019}s mittens. Later that morning, an aunt who was staying at the Vine home received a telephone call from someone she described as a white male in his late teens or early twenties with a Southern or New England accent. He said, \x{201c}We have your daughter. We want eighty thousand dollars or you will never see her again.\x{201d} The aunt asked to speak to Debra, and the caller hung up.",
