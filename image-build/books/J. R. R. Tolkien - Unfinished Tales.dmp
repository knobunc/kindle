She was long-lived (for the women of the N\x{fa}men\x{f3}reans had the longer life, or laid down their lives less easily), and she would wed with no man. Therefore after her day the sceptre passed to Minastir; he was the son of Isilmo, the second child of Tar-S\x{fa}rion. Tar-Telperien was born in the year 1320; she ruled for 175 years, until <<1731|9n:0>>, and died in that same year.",

For he was like his father proud and greedy of wealth, and the N\x{fa}men\x{f3}reans in his service exacted heavy tribute from the men of the coasts of Middle-earth. In his time the Shadow fell upon N\x{fa}menor; and the King, and those that followed his lore, spoke openly against the ban of the Valar, and their hearts were turned against the Valar and the Eldar; but wisdom they still kept, and they feared the Lords of the West, and did not defy them. Atanamir is called also the Unwilling, for he was the first of the Kings to refuse to lay down his life, or to renounce the sceptre; and he lived until death took him perforce in dotage.",

In the Tale of Years (Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings), however, Silmarien\x{2019}s birth is given in the annal entry 548; a date that goes back to the first drafts of that text.

            "10 In the Tale of Years (Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings) occurs the entry: \x{2018}2251 Tar-Atanamir takes the sceptre. Rebellion and division of the N\x{fa}menoreans begins.\x{2019} This is altogether discrepant with the present text, according to which Tar-Atanamir died in 2221. This date 2221 is, however, itself an emendation from <<2251|9c:0>>; and his death is given elsewhere as 2251. Thus the same year appears in different texts as both the date of his accession and the date of his death; and the whole structure of the chronology shows clearly that the former must be wrong. Moreover, in the Akallab\x{ea}th (The Silmarillion p. 266) it is said that it was in the time of Atanamir\x{2019}s son Ancalimon that the people of N\x{fa}menor became divided. I have little doubt therefore that the entry in the Tale of Years is in error for a correct reading: \x{2018}2251 Death of Tar-Atanamir. Tar-Ancalimon takes the sceptre. Rebellion and division of the N\x{fa}menoreans begins.\x{2019} But if so, it remains strange that the date of Atanamir\x{2019}s death should have been altered in \x{2018}The Line of Elros\x{2019} if it were fixed by an entry in the Tale of Years.",

Night had come, and hope faded. Men were falling; for some of the greater Orcs leaped up, two at a time, and dead or alive with their weight bore down aD\x{fa}nedan, so that other strong claws could drag him out and slay him.

Yavanni\x{eb} (Ivanneth) thus corresponded to Halimath, our September; and Narbeleth to our October. Forty days (till Narbeleth 15) was sufficient, if all went well. The journey was probably at least three hundred and eight leagues as marched; but the soldiers of the D\x{fa}nedain, tall men of great strength and endurance, were accustomed to move fully-armed at eight leagues a day \x{2018}with ease\x{2019}: when they went in eight spells of a league, with short breaks at the end of each league (l\x{e1}r, Sindarin daur, originally meaning a stop or pause), and one hour <<near midday|13>>. This made a \x{2018}march\x{2019} of about ten and a half hours, in which they were walking eight hours. This pace they could maintain for long periods with adequate provision. In haste they could move much faster, at <<twelve|9:1>> leagues a day (or in great need more), but for shorter periods. At the date of the disaster, in the latitude of Imladris (which they were approaching), there were at least eleven hours of daylight in open country; but at midwinter less than eight. Long journeys were not, however, undertaken in the North between the beginning of Hithui (H\x{ed}sim\x{eb}, November) and the end of N\x{ed}nui (N\x{e9}nim\x{eb}, February) in time of peace.

            'When the main host of the Wainriders advanced to the attack it was then <<two hours after noon|10>>, and Minohtar had withdrawn his line to the head of the great North Road of Ithilien, half a mile beyond the point where it turned east to the Watch-towers of the Morannon. The first triumph of the Wainriders was now the beginning of their undoing. Ignorant of the numbers and ordering of the defending army they had launched their first onslaught too soon, before the greater part of that army had come out of the narrow land of Ithilien, and the charge of their chariots and cavalry had met with a success far swifter and more overwhelming than they had expected. Their main onslaught was then too long delayed, and they could no longer use their greater numbers with full effect according to the tactics they had intended, being accustomed to warfare in open lands. It may well be supposed that elated by the fall of the King and the rout of a large part of the opposing Centre, they believed that they had already overthrown the defending army, and that their own main army had little more to do than advance to the invasion and occupation of Gondor. If that were so, they were deceived.',

            "All went ill, as most likely it would have done in any case: Saruman\x{2019}s strength was too great. He began his attack by day, and <<before noon|13>> of March the 2nd a strong force of his best fighters, coming down by the Road from Isengard, attacked the forts on the west of the Fords. This force was in fact only a small part of those that he had in hand, no more than he deemed sufficient to dispose of the weakened defence. But the garrison of the Fords, though greatly outnumbered, resisted stubbornly. At length, however, when both the forts were heavily engaged, a troop of Uruks forced the passage between them and began to cross the Fords. Grimbold, trusting in Elfhelm to hold off attack on the east side, came across with all the men he had left and flung them back \x{2013} for a while. But the enemy commander then threw in a battalion that had not been committed, and broke the defences. Grimbold was obliged to withdraw across the Isen. It was then near sunset. He had suffered much loss, but had inflicted far heavier losses on the enemy (mostly Orcs), and he still held the east bank strongly. The enemy did not attempt to cross the Fords and fight their way up the steep slopes to dislodge him; not yet.",

It was the vanguard of the whole remaining forces of Saruman that he was now committing to battle for the conquest of Westfold. They came on at great speed, and suddenly all the host burst into flame, as it seemed. Hundreds of torches were kindled from those borne by the leaders of troops, and gathering into their stream the forces already manning the west bank they swept over the Fords like a river of fire with a great clamour of hate. A great company of bowmen might have made them rue the light of their torches, but Grimbold had only a handful of archers. He could not hold the east bank, and withdrew from it, forming a great shieldwall about his camp. Soon it was surrounded, and the attackers cast torches among them, and some they sent high over the heads of the shieldwall, hoping to kindle fires among the stores and terrify such horses as Grimbold still had. But the shieldwall held. Then, since the Orcs were of less avail in such fighting because of their stature, fierce companies of the Dunlendish hillmen were thrown against it. But for all their hatred the Dunlendings were still afraid of the Rohirrim if they met face to face, and they were also less skilled in warfare and less well armed. The shieldwall still held.',
