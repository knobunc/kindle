            'When a hair drops out, both the long shaft and the short root become detached, but the tiny papilla at the base of the follicle stays put. This little bud then starts to sprout a new hair to replace the old one. It remains active for another six years, when it once again stops growing new cells and becomes dormant. After another three-month resting period it sheds its old hair and repeats the whole process. With our extended lifespan today, each papilla can be expected to repeat its life cycle about twelve times, creating twelve complete hairs, one after the other, each hair being several feet in length. It follows from this that if an individual human being lacked the dormant phase in the hair cycle, he or she would be able to grow locks of hair up to 30 feet in length. This freak condition does seem to have occurred at least once. Swami Pandarasannadhi, an Indian monk from a monastery near Madras, was reported to have unkempt hair that stretched for 26 feet (<<7.49|5a:1>> m).',

            "The male larynx is one-third larger than the female. Male vocal cords are 18 mm long (0.7 inch), female cords only 13 mm (0.5 inch). Compared with the other great apes, the human animal has a much greater gender difference in loudness and depth of voice. This is something we take for granted and yet it is a significant development in the evolutionary separation of the sexes in our species. At puberty the voices of boys break and rapidly deepen with the adult male voice averaging 130\x{2013}145 cycles per second. The voices of girls retain the higher pitch of childhood throughout the adult lifespan, at <<230|9n:0>>\x{2013}255 cycles per second, one octave higher. The difference in pitch between the male and female laugh is even greater.",

            "According to the pro-beard lobby there are several advantages to being bearded, even today. Wearing a beard, they say, makes a man look more virile, mature and dominant. It can make a weak face look stronger, a plain face more interesting and gives the impression of independence, wisdom and mystery. In purely practical terms, wearing a beard saves money on shaving equipment as well as saving time and energy spent shaving each morning. Men who eschew shaving do not have to worry about morning stubble or <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>> shadow and they can avoid cuts, scrapes and nicks. A beard can conceal facial scars, compensate for baldness, and has the added appeal that it provides something to stroke, twiddle and even suck. A bearded man is one who refuses to follow the herd and bow to the dominant, clean-shaven fashion.",

            'The ideal waist/hip ratio for women is <<7:10|2>>, that for the male <<9:10|2>>. When men were shown a series of pictures of women with varying waist/hip ratios and were asked to indicate which was the most attractive, they chose the 7 to 10 ratio. In a similar test, when women were shown a series of pictures of men with varying waist/hip ratios and were asked to indicate which was the most attractive, they chose the 9 to 10 ratio. The response to these contour differences appears to be deep-seated and it is interesting that the distribution of male and female fat deposits appears to support them. When a woman puts on weight, she changes less in the waist region than elsewhere. In this way, although her body may be getting heavier, her crucial waist/hip ratio is to some extent protected. When a man puts on weight, his waistline is not protected in this way.',

In this, good fortune for a coming year depends on the arrival on your doorstep of the First Foot of the New Year, no more than <<a few minutes after midnight|10>> as 31 December becomes 1 January. The newcomer must be carrying gifts and, if the household is to prosper for the next twelve months, he must be a dark male stranger who does not suffer from flat feet. It is vital that he enters the house with his right foot, as the left foot is considered extremely unlucky.',

            "Finally, a word about the name \x{2018}football\x{2019}. It has always been assumed that this title refers to the fact that the world\x{2019}s favourite game involves kicking a ball with the foot. This is so obvious that nobody has ever questioned it, but it happens to be wrong. Football has been played in Britain for nearly a thousand years and, for most of that time, the male foot was not much involved. The early form of folk football was a rough and ready sport, played by large crowds who wrestled for the ball and, once gaining it, held on to it as tightly as possible. To have kicked it into the milling crowd would have lost it. This handling game was so rowdy that it was repeatedly banned, but refused to disappear. It can still be seen in a few places, even today. At Ashbourne in Derbyshire the medieval game is played each year on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday, when up to two thousand players assemble in the town centre. The ball is ceremonially thrown into the crowd at <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>> and the huge scrum then fight for it and try to get it to one of the two goals, which are several miles apart. If nobody has succeeded by late in the evening, the game is called off.",

            'Bromhall sees this last type, to which homosexual males belong, as merely a by-product of the increasingly infantile condition of our species. In other words, when evolution took the human species down the road of increasingly playful, innovative behaviour as a new survival device, the process was not too precise. The ideal outcome would have been to create a species made up of a balanced mixture of reliable organisers, the Bureautypes, and creative fun-lovers, the Neotypes. But this shift was not fully achieved. At <<one|9m:0>> extreme there remained a few of the old-style Alphatypes, the macho toughs, good in a fight, but poor cooperators; and at the other end of the scale a few of the new-style Ultratypes, so advanced in this new evolutionary direction that they got stuck at the boy-group stage.',
