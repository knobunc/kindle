The Earl of Derby's great race (which, it turned out, the rank outsider Felstead did indeed win, to the amusement of the attending King and Queen, to the bookies' great chagrin, to some punters' great joy, and to the humiliation of a crestfallen Times racing correspondent, who had predicted quite otherwise) was the grandest f\x{ea}te staged each year for those able to afford what was still called `the sport of kings': those who attended the ball that followed the race whirled like stately dervishes until <<three|9c:0>>, when dawn came up in all its brief midsummer eagerness.",

            'Chaucer\'s vocabulary, reflective of all that was said and written around him, shows clearly the great measure of change that by his time had come upon the language. In the 858 lines in his Prologue to the Canterbury Tales, for example, there are <<almost 500|18:0>> French (or rather, Norman French) loanwords. Historical studies suggest that by 1365, some 300 new French words were being incorporated into English every year. But it must be stressed that it was not that French was being spoken; the English language, reviving itself from its mysterious dark age, was including and assimilating new French-originated words, speakers and writers using them as replacements for words that had vanished during the time when spoken and written French did dominate the nation\'s language.',

            "A man named John Withals took a hesitating few steps towards the ideal, producing twenty years after Elyot a Latin\x{b1}English vocabulary book in which the words were organized into categories. He collected together words that had something to do with skie, for example, or four-footed beastes, partes of housinge, instruments of musicke, and the names of Byrdes, Byrdes of the Water, Byrdes about the house as cockes, hennes etc; of Bees, Flies and Others. The usefulness of such a book is now self-evident: rather than merely offering a means of translating one word into another language, Withals's small volume classified them, and by doing so reminded readers of, let us say, the names of birds, nudging them towards improving their knowledge. Can't remember the name of a bird between shrike and tern? In Withals there is swallow and swift\x{2014}and at a stroke his book becomes, if little else, an aide-me\x{c2}moire. He called it A Shorte Dictionary for Yonge Beginners: it became a standard school textbook and was wildly popular, remaining in print for more than 70 years, at least until <<1634|9c:0>>.",

After the meal, which lasted from <<7 to 9|10a:0>>, all four of them set to work, arranging and writing out words for the Philological Dictionary, of which Furnivall is now Editor in place of poor Herbert Coleridge. `Missy', as F. calls the girl, is his amanuensis and transcribes: takes long walks too with him and others, of ten and twenty miles a day; which is creditable to her; and indeed she seems a quiet and unassuming creature.There is no doubting either Furnivall's genius, his energy, or his scholarship. He was blessed with friends who luxuriated in his many talents: Alfred, Lord Tennyson was close, as were Charles Kingsley, John Ruskin, William Morris, and Frederick Delius. And the banker-writer Kenneth Grahame, who shared Furnivall's enthusiasm for sculling, eventually succeeded in writing his friend into The Wind in the Willows, a book which Furnivall had encouraged him to write. He cast him as the Water Rat, a cunning and ever-keen creature imbued with a properly rattish pedantry. `We learned 'em!' says Toad. `We taught 'em!' corrects Rat.",

            "Our attempts lay no claim to perfection; but they represent the most that could be done in the time and with the data at our command. The \x{2026} direction in which much time has been consumed is the elucidation of the meaning of obscure terms, sometimes obsolete, sometimes current, belonging to matter of history, customs, fashions, trade or manufactures. In many cases, the only thing known about these was contained in the quotations, often merely allusive, which had been collected by the diligence of our readers. They were to be found in no dictionary, or, if mentioned in some, were explained in a way which our quotations evidently showed to be erroneous. The difficulty of obtaining first-hand and authoritative information about these has often been immense, and sometimes insurmountable. <<Ten|9k:0>>, twenty or thirty letters have sometimes been written to persons who, it was thought, might possibly know, or succeed in finding out, something definite on the subject; and often weeks have passed, and `copy' advances into the state of `proof', and `proof' into `revise', and `revise' even into `final', before any results could be obtained. It is incredible what labour has had to be expended, sometimes, to find out facts for an article which occupies not five or six lines; or even to be able to write the words `Derivation unknown', as the net outcome of hours of research and of testing the statements put forth without hesitation in other works.Elisabeth Murray, in her classic biography of her grandfather, recalls a lecture in which he listed a typical daily bout of letterwriting:",

            "But economy could be won by limiting the number of quotations, by simplifying the explanations of etymology, and by curbing prolixity in definitions. Murray tried this, and while he was working on A, managed to keep a ratio of six of his pages to one of Webster's, which most thought manageable. But gradually, as his enthusiasm for the project increased, so did his page ratio. By the letter Bhe was running at seven to one; by C, eight to one; and a number of delegates began to accuse him and Bradley\x{2014} particularly Bradley, who seemed to be especially undisciplined in this regard\x{2014}of `systematically neglecting' the limits which had been informally imposed on him, of keeping to <<about six to one|10>>, and certainly no more than seven. The Delegates who warned the editors of their profligacy did, however, agree to an increase in the overall size of the OED: it could, they said, be published at 12,900 pages total, which was more than half as many pages again as had been agreed back in 1884.",

Seven to one, eight and <<three-quarters to one|10>>\x{2014}whatever it took was, all of a sudden, just fine.

In dictionary circles he is known specifically for having laboured mightily over words beginning with W, among them warm, wasp, water, wick, wallop,  waggle, and winter. He also dealt at length with the three very tricky W words walnut, wampum, and walrus, and in lexicographical circles his struggles with walrus have become almost famous, since in the Bodleian library there is a ring-backed notebook in Tolkien\'s distinctively neat handwriting listing a bewildering variety of its possible definitions and puzzling etymologies.',
