            "It must hold its readers engrossed, for it has overcome that strange name on the cover, \x{201c}Krakow,\x{201d} a city by no means well known to tourists and <<before 1928|18:1>> never used in a book for boys and girls. And neither school histories nor legends had celebrated a king so oddly named as \x{201c}Kazimir Jagiello.\x{201d} But Mr. Kelly makes us share his own fascination for medieval Poland; he makes that strange, ancient city as real and exciting as he does his colorful cast of people. We are transported into a world of alchemists and armored knights, of a kind priest and a fearful villain, all seen through the eyes of young Joseph. With him, we watch the great king do justice to his family, and see the wildly dramatic end of that fateful, ancient treasure, the \x{201c}Great Tarnov Crystal.\x{201d}",

It has sheltered every mood that my spirit has known and it has expressed every joy that there is in me.\x{201d}",

            "The stranger that they had left in the mud by the roadside that morning stood by the side of the wagon with a crowd of ruffians at his heels, threatening and shouting at Pan Andrew and his wife. The stranger carried a huge club, and the ruffians, of whom he appeared to be the leader, were armed with staves and stones and were shouting angrily, as if intent on harming the man and woman above them. Pan Andrew, in facing them, had stepped in front of his wife, to shield her if stones were thrown; and the sight of the resistance, and the cries of the leader and his attackers, soon brought a huge crowd surging about the wagon, for it was now close on to <<noon|13>>, and the morning\x{2019}s business of the market was well-nigh finished and many citizens and farmers were eating or resting in the shade of the trees about the square.",

Up and up went father and son, until they reached the level where there was a room for the watchman. This octagonal room was divided into two sections, one being the room where the trumpeter might keep warm between watches, the other being the open space around it, from which the turret windows looked out over the city. Here hung extra trumpets, here were the ropes which connected with the great bell hanging in the lower tower, and here were the red flags and the lanterns which were hung out when a fire was perceived from the tower.',

            "Pan Andrew fitted his key to the lock of the door leading into the inner room and threw back the bolt. Entering after his father, Joseph found himself in a small comfortable room containing a table, a bed, a small stove, and a lighted lantern hanging on the wall. About the table were three chairs, wedged rather tightly because of the lack of space, and upon the table was a huge hourglass, one of the largest that Joseph had ever seen. The sand pouring through it in a fine stream had filled the lower section almost to a level graded on the glass with a Latin \x{201c}X\x{201d} to designate the tenth hour. The glass was in reality a twelve-hour glass, and lines and Latin numerals had been marked upon it just after the maker had blown it into shape, when the material was still soft. This was the trumpeter\x{2019}s official clock. There was on the south side of the nave roof, where the sun touched at all hours of the day, a large sundial which was read each <<noon|13>>, and on the north wall of the tower was a clock with one hand. This hand, which indicated the hours, was in truth a hand\x{2014}a piece of metal shaped like a double fist\x{2014}with fingers curled and the index pointing out to the hours.",

Sometimes he would take the duties of the watchman while his father slept and sound the Heynals at each hour and inspect the city regularly from each of the tower windows in order to sound the alarm whenever a red tongue of flame leaped into the sky.
