As it was, the citizen lieutenant had been forced to screen Citizen Captain Russell-again-to alert her to the fact that Citizen Secretary Saint-Just would not, in fact, be at home where she expected to find him when she and her people reported for duty. The citizen captain was as accustomed as Tsakakis himself to such sudden and unpredictable alterations, but that didn\x{2019}t make her any happier about being awakened at <<two in the morning|9a>> so that she could start waking up all of the rest of her people, as well.

But if he\x{2019}d gone into the office early, there wouldn\x{2019}t be any civilians around. Or not any innocent ones, at any rate.
