            "The gendered and sexualized inflections of generational politics are similarly thematized in two of Joaquin\x{2019}s best-known works, \x{201c}The Summer Solstice\x{201d} and \x{201c}May Day Eve\x{201d} (both 1947). In the former, set in the late nineteenth century, the patriarchal complacency of a wealthy Filipino home is shattered on the hottest day of the summer when one of the servants, Agueda, returns from an orgiastic fertility ritual with its roots in pre-Christian practices. Drawn to the erotic power suddenly palpable on the half-naked body of the servant, the properly feminine mistress, Do\x{f1}a Lupe, decides, with the encouragement of her much younger nephew newly returned from Europe and against the wishes of her older, more conservative husband, Don Paeng, to attend the ritual. Running off to join the frenzied dancing among women of all ages and classes, Lupe is transformed as she comes to absorb the repressed memory of pagan practices that elevated women\x{2019}s power of fertility over men\x{2019}s claims of ownership over that power. Back home, she triumphantly confronts her husband, forcing him to declare his adoration for her as her \x{201c}dog,\x{201d} and \x{201c}slave.\x{201d} In the unforgettable ending, he gets down on the ground like \x{201c}a great agonized lizard,\x{201d} and crawls toward her outstretched naked foot, \x{201c}kiss[ing] it savagely\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. the step, the toe, the frail ankle\x{2014}while she bit her lip and clutched in pain at the windowsill, her body distended and wracked by horrible shivers, her head flung back and her loose hair streaming out the window\x{2014}streaming fluid and black in the white night where the huge moon glowed like a sun and the dry air flamed into lightning and the pure heat burned with the immense fever of <<noon|13>>.\x{201d}",

For the storm had caught the ship near that island; the ship had been hurled against the rocks and had shattered into pieces. A few men had saved themselves by swimming ashore, Currito among them and some other Spaniards, but the rest were natives who had been impressed to the service and who now turned against their cruel masters, pushing the Spaniards off the cliffs and hurling great rocks at them until they were all dead or dying, whereupon the natives fled to the wilderness.",

For a lifetime (said he) was barely enough to educate us to the beauties of this world, which are but finite\x{2014}and to educate us for God, whose beauty is infinite: could a mere lifetime, however long and however arduous, be deemed sufficient? And they, not understanding him, stared at each other, wondering was this Currito?

Garlanded boys bore torches; flower-crowned girls carried lamps; acolytes pressed forward with the cross, the standards, and the censers; and a glittering angel lifted the great Flag of the City, its Lions and Castles embroidered in jewels. Behind a company of heralds appeared the mighty St. Andrew, attired in apostolic red and wreathed with laurel. Beside him walked the virgin St. Potenciana, robed in bridal white and crowned with roses. Behind them came St. Francis and St. Dominic and a great crowd of Holy Souls who had been, in life, illustrious citizens and faithful lovers of Manila. Down the aisle advanced the concourse, the cathedral doors swung open, and the Maestro followed the procession down the street to the Puerta Postigo. There the crowd paused in its chanting and, in a moment of silence so infinite you could hear the clocks all over the world intoning twelve, a key clicked audibly in the lock and (as in Jerusalem and Rome and Antioch and Salamanca and Byzantium and Paris and Alexandria and Canterbury and all the great Sees of Christendom) the gates opened and St. Sylvestre entered the city as the wild bells greeted the New Year, the two processions merging and flowing together to the cathedral.',

Actually, she was laughing because this pompous, pompous (and rather shabby) young man tickled her nostalgic bone.

            "\x{2014}I heard her say so. Saturday morning, mother called me up asking me to get her emeralds from the bank. When I brought them over I asked her was she thinking of walking in the Naval procession, because she never wears those jewels except when she joins that procession, and she hasn\x{2019}t been able to since her heart began to trouble her. When she told me that Josie had offered to take her place as guardia I got suspicious right away. Josie has been thick with that guy this last month, and I felt she was up to something. So, yesterday afternoon, I dropped around again. Mother and Josie were in here, dressing for the procession; I stood just outside the door, it was open a little, and I could hear them talking. I heard mother say: \x{201c}I wanted to save you, Josefa.\x{201d} And Josie said, very loud: \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t say that, mother.\x{201d} But mother said she had to say it and that Josie should listen; and then she began to talk about the Christian life and choosing between good and evil and about glory and all that piety stuff, and Josie kept telling her to stop and not to speak. Then I heard mother say: \x{201c}I placed those emeralds in your hands because I wanted you to be free to choose.\x{201d} She said that she knew about Josie\x{2019}s crucial temptation and that she was trying to save Josie by trusting her. \x{201c}Whatever you choose to do now,\x{201d} mother said, \x{201c}you will choose deliberately, with full consciousness; knowing what you will do to me and to yourself.\x{201d} But Josie said it was no use at all, it just happened, and was happening even then; and I heard mother say: \x{201c}Did you feel it too? Someone just stepped across my grave.\x{201d} Then I heard a thud, and I listened but there was only silence and at last I got frightened and pushed open the door and went in. Josie was lying on the floor and mother was bending over her, crying very weakly and trying to call out. I lifted Josie and laid her in bed and she really looked as if she had fainted: she was limp and cold all over, and very pale and sweating. Of course it was all a damned fake. Oh, she had it all planned out\x{2014}this fainting act, so she could stay behind, in bed, with the jewels, while mother went off to the procession. She had me fooled all right; she did look ill; I stopped being suspicious\x{2014}and mother kept whispering: \x{201c}Maybe I\x{2019}ve saved her, maybe I\x{2019}ve saved her,\x{201d} and wouldn\x{2019}t let Josie be disturbed. I took mother to the procession and it was <<past nine|3b>> when we came back. I dropped mother at the door and drove on home. Mother went right up to see how Josie was\x{2014}but Josie was gone already. She had left a note, just one line: \x{201c}Dear Mother, I have chosen. Goodbye.\x{201d} When I reached home, mother\x{2019}s maid was on the phone, frantic: mother had collapsed.",

Yesterday was a Wednesday and we have this <<noon|13>> Mass in our parish. Bobby came with me willingly, he looked all right. We got to church some time before the Mass. So I asked him if he wanted to go to confession and he said yes. He was in the box waiting, I was watching, and when the priest opened the window Bobby jumped as though he had seen a ghost and rushed out of the church. So I ran out too and Bobby was on the steps pressing a hand to his eyes and shaking all over. I got him into a taxi and all the way home I was trying to calm him down saying Bobby this and Bobby that. And suddenly he jerked up and yelled at me: \x{2018}I\x{2019}m not Bobby, I\x{2019}m not Bobby! Stop calling me Bobby!\x{2019} For a moment I wondered which of us had gone mad.\x{201d}",
