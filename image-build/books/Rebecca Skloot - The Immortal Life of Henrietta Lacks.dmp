Special thanks to John Cal de-razzo and Lee Gutkind for more than a decade of encouragement, support, and close friendship.

Everyone at Hopkins called him Uncle Dick. He\x{2019}d pioneered the use of estrogen for treating symptoms of menopause and made important early discoveries about endometriosis. He\x{2019}d also written one of the most famous clinical gynecology textbooks, which is still widely used sixty years and ten editions after he first wrote it.
