But what if the moon doesn't shine from <<noon|13>> until <<nine|9c:1>>? What if killing Brenda and Erica Lafferty wasn't actually part of God's plan but was merely a crime of such staggering cruelty that it is beyond forgiveness? What if, in short, Dan got it all wrong? Has it occurred to him that he may in fact have a great deal in common with another fundamentalist of fanatical conviction, Osama bin Laden?",

We went to the New York\x{2013}New York Casino, and stood outside in the street there with thousands and thousands of other people as the ball dropped and they counted down the seconds to the year 2000.

The Mountain Meadows Massacre, published in 1950, is an extraordinary work of history, the seminal portrait of Mormondom under Brigham Young. Will Bagley's updated treatment of the same subject, Blood of the Prophets, published in 2002, must now be considered the definitive work, but as Bagley acknowledges, he owes an immeasurable debt to Juanita Brooks, whom he praises as \x{201c}one of the West's best and bravest historians.\x{201d} In a very discernible sense, every book about the Mormon experience in nineteenth-century Utah published <<after 1950|18:0>> is a response to Brooks's book\x{2014}just as every post-1946 treatment of the Mormons under Joseph Smith was written in the immense shadow cast by Fawn Brodie's masterpiece, No Man Knows My History.
