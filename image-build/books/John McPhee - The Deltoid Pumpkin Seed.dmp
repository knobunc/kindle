            "The main building at NAFEC is immense, with sliding steel doors seventy feet high closing the ends of a room in
which several big jets and any number of small planes can be housed at the same time. The floor personnel there have worked on just about everything, military or civilian, that flies in American sky. It is hard to imagine any sort of aircraft that would draw from them more than a glance. <<Around nine o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>, though, on that August day, when Aereon 26 came in and was lifted off the flatbed trailer, men from every part of the hangar left the planes they were working on and collected in a wide circle around it. They looked at it in silence. In time, they would be making cynical remarks about the wingless orange vehicle and its trials, but now they just stood there and took it in. The 26 was placed at one side of the hangar. Two fifty-pound weights were hung from its nose, because its balance was so critical that, without a pilot inside it, the 26 would otherwise have canted backward. Stanchions were put around it. It was roped off like an exhibit in a museum. As the NAFEC men watched, the Trenton Times was peeled away from the orange fuselage. A big sheet came off the side revealing black registration numbers, \x{201c}N2627.\x{201d} More newspaper came off the underbelly, introducing to the NAFEC people the name \x{201c}AEREON 26.\x{201d} And still more news came off the vertical fins, where black lettering said \x{201c}AERERON AEROBODY 001.\x{201d}",

            "Kukon was twenty-nine years old. He had started building gasoline-powered flying model airplanes when he was seven. Year after year, he built miscellaneously\x{2014}indoor models, outdoor models, gliders, stunt models, and combat models that fought in the air. He was fifteen when he decided to specialize. He had joined the Academy of Model Aeronautics\x{2014}the organization that regulates and administers flying-model competitions of regional and national scope\x{2014}and his choice was whether to fly figure eights in front of judges or to fly for pure speed. \x{201c}A stopwatch doesn\x{2019}t lie,\x{201d} he told himself. \x{201c}It doesn\x{2019}t have any personality.\x{201d} So he elected to concentrate in the field of control-line
speed. When he tried a competition for the first time, he placed third among thirty contestants, and he felt drawn to what he was doing as never before. He took a paper route to help pay for materials. Afternoons, almost without exception, he came home from high school and immediately went to the basement to build and build and build\x{2014}Class A\x{2019}s, Class B\x{2019}s, Class C\x{2019}s, proto-speeds, jets. He lived in Fords, New Jersey, outside Perth Amboy, where control-line exhibitions regularly took place in Waters Stadium on the Fourth of July. Kukon would be in there every year, exhibiting his Ringmasters, his scale-model Cessnas, his little P-51s\x{2014}in dust and smoke and the rampant noise of V-1 scale-model pulse-jet engines. You could hear them seven miles away. He went to a contest somewhere every Sunday\x{2014}to Wilmington and Baltimore, to airports and fairgrounds, to naval bases, to the Grumman plant at Bethpage, Long Island. The planes were hand-launched. Kukon\x{2019}s father\x{2014}a cook at a home for disabled veterans in Menlo Park\x{2014}was his crewman. Once the plane was in the air, Kukon, holding the control line, would jam his wrist into a yoke (a thing that looked like an oarlock ) that was set into the top of a short steel pole. The plane would race around in circles on the end of the line while Kukon, rapidly circling the pole, determined the plane\x{2019}s altitude by manipulating a monoline control system with his left hand. Classes were a matter of engine size, and the bigger the engine the longer the control line\x{2014}forty-two feet, fifty-two and a half feet, sixty feet, seventy feet. The official stopwatch started after three laps. The timed distance was always a half mile. The planes were required to fly at an altitude of fifteen feet or less. The place to
be, though, was close to the ground, because of a phenomenon known in aeronautics as ground effect. Ground effect, or the ground cushion, as it is sometimes called, is not fully understood but is somehow related to wingspan. An airplane in flight\x{2014}any plane, from a small model to a 747\x{2014}is in the ground cushion when its altitude measures less than the spread of its wings. Sitting on the cushion, the plane gets added lift without the penalty of drag. So Kukon\x{2014}risking complete destruction of his models, which flew well over a hundred miles per hour\x{2014}learned to fly them within two inches of the ground. He won three hundred and fifty trophies. He once set two national records in a single week\x{2014}one in Maryland and the other at the New York Mirror Model Flying Fair at Floyd Bennett Field. Two thousand contestants were there, most of them adults. Kukon was nineteen. Flying started at dawn, and all day long Kukon won prizes. His Class C plane flew nine miles per hour faster than the national record. Kukon and his father went home in their twenty-year-old Chevrolet with five trophies, five radios, four wristwatches, a set of tools, two cases of Coca-Cola, a box of silverware, three wallets, and a cookstove. An accident that happened at Johnsville Naval Air Development Center, near Philadelphia, caused Kukon to decide to give up control-line speed flying forever. Sitting on a box with a stopwatch in his hand, he was monitoring a run by one of his regular opponents, a doctor from the medical faculty of Temple University. The engine, prop, landing gear, and other attached parts of the doctor\x{2019}s plane\x{2014}a two-pound package in all\x{2014}broke away from the fuselage and projectiled toward Kukon\x{2019}s head. Just then a young boy stepped in
front of Kukon. At eighteen thousand revolutions per minute, the wild engine went into the boy\x{2019}s kidney, nearly killing him. Kukon cancelled all his competitive plans. He had little time, anyway, for much but work and study. After high school, he had enrolled at the Academy of Aeronautics at LaGuardia Airport, where he got his Airframe and Powerplant credentials, the badge of the licensed mechanic. He had been about to go to work at Newark Airport as a mechanic for American Airlines when a friend told him about a job at Princeton that seemed unbelievable. The university actually paid people to build models. They had a unique test facility called the Long Track, a narrow building seven hundred and sixty feet long, where they worked with designs for low-speed aircraft. Soon Kukon was building models at Princeton which cost contracting companies as much as eighty-five thousand dollars; for example, a four-engine vertical-lift model whose wing could rotate through a ninety-degree arc so that the engines would point forward or up, as the pilot chose. Doing consulting work, he built a model tube train. The tube was two thousand feet long. The train was driven by counter-rotating propellers. It shot through the tube at two hundred miles per hour. For all the diversions of his work, though, Kukon\x{2019}s thoughts, in the months that followed the accident at Johnsville, were drawn repeatedly to one trophy, its image sharp in his mind. It was a staggeringly big trophy, an elaborate gold sculpture in late aerobaroque. It was almost as tall as Kukon\x{2014}a giant gold cup, fourteen inches from rim to rim, and it had a gold lid, on top of which was a gold airplane. It was given for the over-all best performance at a model contest held
annually at Westchester County Airport, in White Plains. The trophy belonged to the Westchester Exchange Club, and not to the winner. There was a provision, however, that should anyone ever win it three years in a row that person could keep it permanently. There had never been a three-time winner. Kukon had won the trophy the year before. He had also won it the year before that. This fact tormented his decision to retire. He kept thinking about that stupendous cup with its gold filigree and its gold airplane. In the end, inevitably, he decided to go back into control-line speed for one more day. When the day came, he moved around the airfield from flying circle to flying circle, from class to class, and put his various planes through their lariat flights, always on the edge of record speeds. There were so many contestants that Kukon had time only for one flight in each class he entered, although the rules technically allowed him three. By late afternoon, though, he was beginning to relax into the expectation that the big trophy was on its way to Fords, for he had flown five events and his times were the best in each. Nothing less would do, because in the contest as a whole there were many events\x{2014}speed events, free-flight events\x{2014}and even a single second place could eliminate a contender for the high-point trophy. By the rules, all flying would cease at <<6 P.M.|5>> At <<five-fifteen|5b>>, someone beat Kukon\x{2019}s Class A time by one-tenth of a second. With luck, he could try once more. He put his number in at the judges\x{2019} table and began the wait for a final turn in the Class A circle. Several others were ahead of him. It seemed likely that the contest would close before he could get into the circle. Half an hour went by, while Kukon chewed the
ends of his fingers. The nails had long since been bitten back so far he could not reach them. At <<ten minutes to six|10>>, his number came up. Kukon opened his fuel box. He made his own fuels. Fuel bought in a store was castor oil and alcohol, and Kukon was far past that. In his fuel, only five per cent was alcohol. The rest was high-energy material in various blends\x{2014}propylene oxide, nitromethane. In the fuel box were four bottles, four blends. Each bottle was wrapped in carpeting. Blend 4 had never been used. Kukon had never actually expected to use it. He had conceived of it as a fuel for a situation of extreme and unusual emergency. Its characteristics were that it would almost certainly destroy the engine that burned it, but meanwhile the engine would develop enough thrust to drive a sparrow to the moon. Kukon entered the circle with his Class A plane and poured Blend 4 into the engine. By the rules of the competition, he had three minutes to get the plane into the air. The engine seemed not so much to start as to explode. Its force immediately broke the propeller. Kukon ran to his equipment box for another propeller, and, with his hands shaking, tried to get it mounted before his time ran out. When he finished the job, he had twenty seconds left. He started the engine again. This time the propeller did not break. The airplane, screaming, bolted into the air. Kukon could barely hold on to the control line. He could not pirouette fast enough to keep pace with the plane. It was all he could do to get his wrist into the yoke. Class A planes are small, as control-line speed models go, and no one in the world had ever flown one a hundred and fifty miles an hour. Kukon\x{2019}s model got right down onto the deck, deep in the ground cushion. An audio tachometer
covered the run and showed that the engine was doing thirty thousand revolutions per minute. The plane ate up its half mile at an average speed of 150.013 miles per hour. Then it flew on and on and on. It flew six miles. There is no way to shut off one of those engines in the air. When the plane landed, the motor was extraordinarily hot but undamaged.",

            "ON SATURDAY EVENING, September 5, 1970, John Olcott and his wife gave a dinner party at their home, in Basking Ridge, thirty miles north of Princeton. Beforehand, Olcott dialled the Aereon Corporation\x{2019}s number and spoke with an answering service. He gave his name, and waited while it was checked against a list. Rain and wind had delayed the first attempt to fly the 26. Now the message was \x{201c}Good weather tomorrow morning. The winds will be south-southwest three to six knots at <<6 A.M.|5>>, building up to six to ten knots by <<8 A.M.|5>>\x{201d} Aereon had reserved dawn to eight Sunday on the big runway at NAFEC. The guests came. Olcott prepared drinks. He did not want to be a killjoy, so he privately mixed himself water on the rocks with an olive. He revealed nothing of his plans until after dinner, when he said he was sorry but he had to work early the next morning; and abruptly he went to bed. He got up at <<three|9c:1>>, and although he was on
his way to a remote and all but deserted airfield, he dressed in a blue button-down shirt, a dark-blue narrow tie, gray flannel slacks, and a blue-white-and-yellow madras jacket. By <<three-thirty|5b>>, he was moving south in his Karmann Ghia\x{2014}Interstate 287, the New Jersey Turnpike, the Garden State Parkway. At seventy miles per hour, glued to the banked turns, he was going about as fast as Aereon 26 would ever go or was ever meant to go. He moved under stars through mile after mile of dark-corridor forest on the eastern perimeter of the Pine Barrens. He crossed over the Mullica River, shot through the vacant streets of Pomona, and went on through a countryside of open fields and stands of pine to a set of gates in the high chain-link and barbed-wire fencing that surrounded the flat immensity of NAFEC. Inside, he drove on for another mile or so, until windowless walls seventy feet high loomed up black before him against the barely graying sky. He parked the Karmann Ghia at the corner of Lindbergh Drive and Firehouse Lane. Carrying his flying boots and his test pilot\x{2019}s note pad\x{2014}his jump suit over one arm\x{2014}he walked toward the big building. He went through a small door in an acre of wall, like a mouse going home.",

            "CELEBRATION was even less in order than Olcott might have thought. The 26 had got off the ground, but that was all it could do. In successive tests in following days, it flew on the ground cushion, never more than fifteen feet above the runway. It could not get out of ground effect. The increased drag in the zone of transition out of ground effect was too much for it. It was trapped like an electron in a magnetic bottle, a live mosquito under glass. The 26 would make straight, low, steady flights of about a mile, one after another, always settling back to the runway. Olcott\x{2019}s small steps forward into the unknown grew ever smaller, as the amounts of freshly acquired data diminished with each run. The test program went into a cycle of getting nowhere\x{2014}the long rides in the dead of night to NAFEC, thermos coffee, the gradual breaking of the glaze that comes with getting up at <<3 A.M.|5>>, the brightly lighted hangar, the briefing, the roll-out into the dawn, moon hanging there as orange as the aerobody. The startup.
The coughing engine. The fire trucks, checkered flags, whirling lights. Flight. The 26 fighting against prohibitive physical odds. Scraping against an aerodynamic ceiling. Unable to climb. End of outing. Debrief. Go home. Nothing much accomplished. NAFEC people sometimes looked at each other in amusement after watching the so-called aerobody in action. On the same runway, they had seen McDonnell Phantoms, capable of going sixteen hundred miles an hour, and Lockheed U-2s that could climb thirteen miles into the air. Now here was something that took off like a snail going up a grape leaf and could not go higher than fifteen feet\x{2014}an aircraft that could be outrun by a fire truck. The woman behind the counter in the NAFEC cafeteria, where windows gave a panoramic view of the runway, looked through tiers of glass shelves in front of her and remarked that the 26 regularly got up into the English muffins but seemed to get stuck there. \x{201c}What do they think they\x{2019}re doing out there?\x{201d} \x{201c}I doubt if they know.\x{201d} \x{201c}Beats the living hell out of me.\x{201d} \x{201c}They call it an aerobody.\x{201d} \x{201c}Milk or lemon?\x{201d}",

Eight hundred and four feet long, silver, cylindroid, with a fineness ratio (length over diameter) of six to one, the Hindenburg was the climax and meridian of the big rigid airships. Inside his cloth-covered aluminum frame (in German the gender of airships was masculine) were sixteen vast balloons\x{2014}rubber bags filled with hydrogen\x{2014}and they lifted him slowly into the night. He turned to the northeast, crossed pinewoods and horse pastures, thickening suburbs, Raritan and New York Bays. Then he moved in low over Manhattan, and his course was framed by the boulevard lights of Park Avenue, running on and on to the top of the city. The Queen Mary, in the Hudson, strung with lights, grunted cavernously\x{2014}once, twice. Other ships cut in with horns, whistles, tugboat blasts of jazz-marine. By now, the passengers in the Hindenburg were themselves lighter than air. Most of them were leaning out the windows. There were fifty-seven of them in all, including Rear Admiral Greenslade, Lord Donegall, Captain Schulz-Heyn, Adriel Bird, Mrs. E. M. Latin, Erich Warburg, Olga Boesch. Max Schmeling was there, with a black eye. Max had just defeated Joe Louis. Jean Labatut, a Princeton professor of architecture, was aboard. And so was Charles Dollfus, the French aeronaut, the free-balloonist. Labatut, all but hanging by his feet,
pointed a 16-mm. movie camera down at the city and used the airship as a dolly. The film that eventually resulted was, in effect, surreal. Points of light were all that emerged, against a background of absolute blackness. The city lights were less concentrated then, and Labatut\x{2019}s film of New York, which he still has, is like a slow float through beaded stars and inhabited planets. Labatut finally went to bed, nodding bonsoir to his countryman Dollfus, who had been assigned to the same stateroom. Labatut had expected the cabin\x{2014}in fact, the whole ship\x{2014}to be full of handrails to clutch during aerial pitch and roll. There were none anywhere. They were unnecessary.

            "Luftschiff Zeppelin 1, 2, 3, and 4 were not uncomplicated successes. They broke, collapsed, and exploded, but they flew. They made unscheduled landings in the Rhine. It was the Graf who flew them, in his white cap, his wing collar, his wicked mustache. People ran through the streets of cities and villages cheering him, above. Church bells followed his flights. He even flew at night. He flew to
Switzerland (the Schweizerfahrt), and cruised at forty miles per hour over Lucerne and Zurich. The Kaiser called him \x{201c}the greatest German of the twentieth century.\x{201d} Zeppelin Platz was dedicated in ceremonies in Berlin. The Graf had apparently solved his early technological problems. In 1909, at the age of seventy-one, he formed his transportation company\x{2014}with Eckener, whose background was in economics\x{2014}and began to fly passengers all over Germany. He built rigid airships for use as weapons in the First World War. They terrorized England. Whole populations fled provincial towns. The zeppelins, as they by now were called, sat up in the middle of the English clouds and each one reeled out a small \x{201c}cloud car\x{201d} until it hung in clear air, sometimes a thousand feet below. By telephone, the man in the cloud car directed the airship over targets and ordered the release of bombs. A hundred and fifty-seven rigid airships were all that were ever built in the world, and a hundred and thirty-eight of them were built in Germany. The first aircraft to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, an English rigid airship, was a zeppelin copy. The English built sixteen rigids in all. The United States Navy, in the course of time, had four. One of these, the Los Angeles, was a zeppelin built in Friedrichshafen and handed over as war reparations. Another, the Shenandoah, was a zeppelin copy. The Akron and the Macon were of American design. One fell into the Atlantic, the other fell into the Pacific. Meanwhile, under Hugo Eckener, the German Zeppelin Transport Company was continuing the perfect record of its founder, carrying passengers to domestic and foreign cities with no fatalities. In 1928, the company put into service the LZ-127, an extremely slender
vessel (its fineness ratio was <<almost eight to one|10>>) that would compile, in the end, by far the most impressive log ever made by an airship, statistical proof for all time of the potentiality of the big rigids. Almost as if they knew how historically important this airship would be, the Germans named it the Graf Zeppelin. It flew one million fifty-three thousand three hundred and ninety-one miles. It once flew around the world, from Friedrichshafen to Tokyo to Lakehurst to Friedrichshafen. It carried, in its nine years, thirteen thousand passengers. It spent seventeen thousand hours in the air. The Graf Zeppelin was only twenty-nine feet shorter than the Hindenburg, and flying together, slowly going in and out of clouds, they were something to see\x{2014}these phallic, Wagnerian rigids, brushed with mist. Hitler was only mildly inspired by them, but he knew propaganda when it floated by, and he ordered the big airships to present themselves overhead at outdoor rallies and sporting events\x{2014}parading their immensity and the swastikas on their fins. The airship transportation company was operating at the sufferance of the Air Ministry, so the Hindenburg and the Graf Zeppelin generally appeared as requested, but not always. The company was not affectionate toward the government. Eventually, Eckener defied the F\x{fc}hrer once too often, and he was removed from command of the Hindenburg, which flew without him to Lakehurst on May 4, 5, and 6, 1937. The Hindenburg burned while mooring there\x{2014}a billowing holocaustal white fire. The Hindenburg completely burned up in thirty-four seconds. There was nothing left but fine gray ash and soft aluminum. The huge structure had crumpled instantly into tumbleweed heaps on the ground. The hydrogen burned
at about three thousand degrees Fahrenheit. No one watching could imagine the possibility of there being survivors. Luck, though, seemed to run in variegated patterns under the flame. Some passengers and crewmen died at once, but the heat was driving upward, of course, and as the ship crashed the passengers were brought to ground level, where, even within the surrounding fire, there were cooler patches, avenues of escape. Some people came walking eerily out of the flames and fell dead. Others came out with minor burns. A number were completely unhurt. Sixty-one of ninety-seven survived. Thirteen of the dead were passengers\x{2014}the only passenger fatalities in the history of commercial airships. No satisfactory explanation of the source of the fire ever emerged. It was a stormy day in New Jersey. Static electricity or some form of lightning were the official guesses. A reasonable theory has been advanced that a German saboteur, an anti-Nazi member of the crew, wishing to destroy this symbol of German power, blew it up with a flashbulb. The Graf Zeppelin, on the way home from Rio de Janeiro, was approaching the Canary Islands at the time. The radio operator picked up the news, and the captain decided not to inform the passengers. Their voyage was the last voyage of the rigid airships. The Air Ministry shut down Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei G.m.b.H. All schedules were cancelled. The ships were, before long, disassembled. At the height of their development, the height of their performance, the rigid airships disappeared.",

was that he ran out of film. Looking down at the ocean the second <<noon|13>>, he saw a phenomenon he had never seen (but one that was apparently common in airship travel): two concentric rainbows, complete and perfect circles, were moving with, and framing, the Hindenburg\x{2019}s shadow. The nose of the airship seemed to nudge the inner rainbow. Labatut would have given almost anything for twenty feet of film. Instead, sipping Rhine wine, he rapidly sketched in charcoal and pastels the rainbows, the shadow, a freighter on the sea, and, in the foreground, on the windowsill, the glass that held his wine. (The picture still hangs in his living room in Princeton. ) Cattle on the Isle of Man backed up before the big, low-flying airship, and kept walking backward, eyes agog, and Labatut said to Dollfus and Eckener, \x{201c}Do you know what they are saying? They are saying, \x{2018}What a bull!\x{2019}\x{201d} A bicyclist on the Isle of Man looked up at the airship as he pedalled along, and kept looking up, and dived into a hedge. R.A.F. planes rose and snapped pictures of the Hindenburg while the Hindenburg made pictures of Manchester and Leeds. Across the Channel, Utrecht was celebrating some sort of centennial, and people ran through the streets waving orange pennons at the Hindenburg. In the slanting afternoon light, the Dutch canals appeared as dark as obsidian. The reflection of the airship in the canals was silver. The Hindenburg was so big that segments of it shone from several canals at once, and its reflection moved from canal to parallel canal like a shuttle through a loom. The Rhine, its improbable turrets reaching up to the improbable Hindenburg, formed the airship\x{2019}s final glide path. Turning left at the confluence of the Main, the Hindenburg
dropped mooring ropes over the Rhine-Main World Airport, Frankfurt, at <<four in the afternoon|5>>, June 26, 1936. That voyage, to Labatut, was the sum of the art of flying, expressed in its mild speed, its aerostatic firmness, and its proximity to the earth. The airships, however briefly, had brought into the milieu of commercial transportation what was otherwise possible only in a free balloon. The explosion at Lakehurst ten months later gave Professor Labatut no second thoughts. \x{201c}I have never regretted for one moment to have had the chance to cross the ocean in the dirigible.\x{201d}",

            "I once found myself wondering, though, how Miller might articulate his deeper purposes, if he would agree to do so at all. Personal profit could hardly be the radical motivation of a man who had poured away three hundred thousand dollars without apparent qualm. Monklike, frugal, denying himself every sweet in the box, he had spent (by then) several years singlemindedly struggling to preserve this checkered company. I asked him, <<around 4 A.M.|5>> one night on the way to a flight test at NAFEC, what he saw as his ultimate goal. He sighed unhappily and said he had scruples about keeping his private aims separate from his corporate objectives. He said, \x{201c}However, if people probe me as to why I\x{2019}m doing this, I\x{2019}ll tell them, and it always reaches to ultimate values\x{2014}but I don\x{2019}t ordinarily go into it. The Faith Fleet was not a theological matter but a straightforward sales device\x{2014}a gimmick. Should the Body of Christ run schools, highway departments, police forces, transportation companies? I don\x{2019}t think so. Christians are supposed to be yeast and salt, the church in the world, people among people. The computer in Valley Forge was a tool created by man, not by God, and the computer created the aerobody, which is also a thing\x{2014}a neutral object. It could be used for anything. The aerobody itself
cannot be good or bad. It\x{2019}s the use of it that can be bad. That is what sin is all about. Like any other gift, an aircraft can benefit man. I see the theological dimension of the aerobody as bringing a means of transportation of general benefit to man. The aerobody would benefit more people than high-speed aircraft do. An executive jet isn\x{2019}t something a small town in Ghana could afford. But unit cost and utilization possibilities would make it possible for a small town in Ghana to afford an Aereon. Could Nigeria afford an SST? No. But Nigeria could use a flexible means of transport carrying many people and a great deal of produce cheaply. We can give developing countries a chance to become more effective in trade. We don\x{2019}t want people to be dependent on us. This is a product they can buy and use in their own commerce. They need no fixed capital investment in a right-of-way. There are broad social concerns, you see, in the national interest\x{2014}good for the free world.\x{201d}",

            "MILLER HAD LONG SINCE discovered the hole in the fence between religion and superstition. All week long, as he worried and as he watched the weather, he looked for omens. When he learned that a major reunion of American airship men would be held at Lakehurst on June 26 and 27 next, he shivered with hopeful presentiment. The aircraft registration number of Aereon 26, boldly painted on its side, was N2627. The weather forecast for Saturday, March 6th, was more than promising. All the mechanical work Olcott had asked for had been done. So word went out on Friday, through the Aereon answering service, that the test group should meet at NAFEC at <<five-thirty|5b>> the following morning. Reaching into a pocket, Miller took out his daily appointment book. It was called the Success Agenda Seven-Star Diary, and it included a fortune message for each day. Turning the page, Miller read the message for March 6,
1971. It said, \x{201c}The mocker\x{2019}s arrow turns back like a boomerang.\x{201d}",

            "Jack Olcott and his wife, Hope, happened to be giving a dinner party March 5th, as they had on the night before the first lift-off, six months before. Olcott mixed himself an aquatini\x{2014}water with an olive in it\x{2014}and after dinner he passed cordials around and said to his guests, \x{201c}I hope you won\x{2019}t consider me rude, and I hope I won\x{2019}t break up the conversation, but I have a very early morning appointment and I have to retire for the night.\x{201d} He got up at <<four|9c:1>>, and took fifteen minutes to dress, choosing a blue blazer, a blue-and-gold button-down striped shirt, his royal-blue tie with fleurs-de-lis, gray flannel trousers, and a pair of defeated, broken-down loafers with flapping soles. In the blazer\x{2019}s lapel was a small set of wings, emblematic of his membership in the secret society of Quiet Birdmen. At <<four-thirty|5b>>, he parked his car at Morristown Airport, and shovelled an aging snowdrift from the apron of a T-hangar. He rolled out a Beechcraft Travelair, climbed in, and took off. His route south passed above McGuire Air Force Base. The McGuire approach controller said to him, \x{201c}Are you going home late or getting up early?\x{201d} Olcott gave the controller a straight answer. Crossing the Pine Barrens, he ate a box breakfast that his wife had packed\x{2014}crullers and coffee, meat-loaf sandwiches. At <<five-thirty|5b>>, he raised the galactic blue lights of NAFEC.",
