By <<1821|9n:0>> McKain could take no more and left to accept a new post at Sheerness Dockyard. He was replaced by Edward Laws. The poisonous atmosphere had begun to clear when the news broke on 9 January 1823 that the Navy Board had shown its continued confidence in the Pembroke yard by placing an order for the construction of a 372-ton bomb vessel, designed by Sir Henry Peake, one-time Surveyor of the Navy, to be named Erebus.",

But change was in the air. Just a few years later, in 1846, following persistent efforts by the MP Joseph Hume, every flogging at sea had to be reported to the House of Commons. This had an immediate effect. More than 2,000 floggings were meted out in 1839; by <<1848|9n:0>> this had been reduced to 719.

Some of the officers had washbasins in their cabins, but the men would usually bathe in basins or tubs on the forecastle, if it was warm enough. The colder it became, the more the men were confined, and the more necessary it was to keep checks on cleanliness. Parry, in his first over-wintering voyage in 1821, put in place a regular system.

Ross persevered for a while, in the forlorn hope that he might find access, but the ice was thickening fast and he realised that the Barrier seemed to have no end. On 23 February, standing 1\x{bd} miles out from the ice-wall, Erebus waited for Terror to catch up, so that the two ships could record their position at the same time.

In fact no ship of any kind reached that far south for almost sixty years. Ross, who had already reached a record 82.43\x{b0}N in 1827, could now claim to have achieved a feat shared only by his shipmates Edward Bird and Thomas Abernethy: to have been further north and further south than anyone else on earth.",

            "The pile of evidence continued to grow. On 5 May they came across an 18-foot-long spruce tree that had been cut in half with a whipsaw, presumably for use as fuel. The next day they discovered another, smaller cairn, with a broken pickaxe and an empty tea or coffee canister inside. After spending an hour in a fruitless search for documents, they continued south, where they found a third cairn, with \x{2018}a great quantity of gear\x{2019} strewn about. There was much to investigate here, so they pitched their tent nearby. At <<midday|13>> on 6 May they went to work.",

            "The note might confidently have stated that all was well, but even at this stage there are signs that things were awry. For a start, Fitzjames had got his dates wrong: it was <<1845|9d>>\x{2013}6, not 1846\x{2013}7, when they wintered on Beechey Island. Richard Cyriax\x{2019}s explanation is that the mistaken date was simply a slip of the pen and shows that such records were considered of very little importance. But it could be an indication that the members of the expedition had become increasingly disorientated. And the fact that Franklin himself did not write or sign the note was ominous.",

            "Other circumstantial evidence would appear to support the poisoned-tin thesis. As Russell Potter emphasises, the diet would have differed quite markedly between decks. Whereas the bulk of the crew would have eaten a fairly basic diet of salt pork and hardtack, cooked by one of the company designated as mess-cook for the week, senior officers, who would have dined with the captain, would have had their own supplies, cooked by their own stewards. We know that Captain Crozier and Lieutenant Fairholme had procured goods from Fortnum & Mason, and they were almost certainly not the only ones. The officers would have had the best-quality tea, tobacco, wines and spirits \x{2013} and also tinned food, then regarded as something of a luxury item. The Victory Point note records that of the deaths up till April 1848, nine were officers and fifteen were men. Bearing in mind that the proportion of officers to crew was <<about one to six|10>>, this is a startlingly high number of officers, and has been raised as further evidence that the tinned food could have been at fault.",

            "Absolute confirmation of the find had to wait until 7 September, when a remote operating vehicle (ROV) with a camera attached was launched into the water. The sea was becoming rougher and choppier, and visibility murkier by the moment. The suspense on the Sir Wilfrid Laurier was screwed tight, until the first video close-ups brought absolute clarification that the hulk on the seabed was indeed one of Franklin\x{2019}s ships, her hull broken at the stern, but otherwise looking like it did on the day she was born. Bill <<Noon|13>>, captain of the Sir Wilfrid Laurier, was moved to tears. He had thought that the ice in Victoria Strait had kept them away from the discovery area, but in fact it had done exactly the opposite. \x{2018}Somebody was pushing us to an answer,\x{2019} he said at the time. \x{2018}Somebody had waited long enough and wanted to solve the riddle.\x{2019}",
