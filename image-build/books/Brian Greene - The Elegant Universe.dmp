            'Although this seems paradoxical, let\'s try to pinpoint a precise experiment that would reveal a logical absurdity. The simplest possibility is to arrange things so that when George and Gracie pass one another they both set their clocks to read <<12:00|2>>. As they travel apart, each claims that the other\'s clock is running slower. To confront this disagreement head on, George and Gracie must rejoin each other and directly compare the time elapsed on their clocks. But how can they do this? Well, George has a jetpack that he can use, from his perspective, to catch up with Gracie. But if he does this, the symmetry of their two perspectives, which is the cause of the apparent paradox, is broken since George will have undergone accelerated, non-force-free motion. When they rejoin in this manner, less time will indeed have elapsed on George\'s clock as he can now definitively say that he was in motion, since he could feel it. No longer are George\'s and Gracie\'s perspectives on equal footing. By turning on the jet-pack, George relinquishes his claim to being at rest.',

            "Let's see this, first, from George's perspective. Imagine that every hour, on the hour, George recites into his cell phone, \"It's <<twelve o'clock|6>> and all is well,\" \"It's <<one o'clock|6>> and all is well,\" and so forth. Since from his perspective Gracie's clock runs slow, at first blush he thinks that Gracie will receive these messages prior to her clock's reaching the appointed hour. In this way, he concludes, Gracie will have to agree that hers is the slow clock. But then he rethinks it: \"Since Gracie is receding from me, the signal I send to her by cell phone must travel ever longer distances to reach her. Maybe this additional travel time compensates for the slowness of her clock.\" George's realization that there are competing effects\x{2014}the slowness of Gracie's clock vs. the travel time of his signal\x{2014}inspires him to sit down and quantitatively work out their combined effect. The result he finds is that the travel time effect more than compensates for the slowness of Gracie's clock. He comes to the surprising conclusion that Gracie will receive his signals proclaiming the passing of an hour on his clock after the appointed hour has passed on hers. In fact, since George is aware of Gracie's expertise in physics, he knows that she will take the signal's travel time into account when drawing conclusions about his clock based on his cell phone communications. A little more calculation quantitatively shows that even taking the travel time into account, Gracie's analysis of his signals will lead her to the conclusion that George's clock ticks more slowly than hers.",

Although the subsequent discovery that the universe is expanding led Einstein to retract the modification, physicists have since realized that there is no explanation for why the cosmological constant should be zero. In fact, the cosmological constant can be interpreted as a kind of overall energy stored in the vacuum of space, and hence its value should be theoretically calculable and experimentally measurable. But, to date, such calculations and measurements lead to a colossal mismatch: Observations show that the cosmological constant is either zero (as Einstein ultimately suggested) or quite small; calculations indicate that quantum-mechanical fluctuations in the vacuum of empty space tend to generate a nonzero cosmological constant whose value is some 120 orders of magnitude (a 1 followed by <<120|3:0>> zeros) larger than experiment allows! This presents a wonderful challenge and opportunity for string theorists: Can calculations in string theory improve on this mismatch and explain why the cosmological constant is zero, or if experiments do ultimately establish that its value is small but nonzero, can string theory provide an explanation?

How can such a speck of a universe be physically identical to the great expanse we view in the heavens? Furthermore, we are now led forcefully to the second of our initial three questions: String theory was supposed to eliminate the ability to probe sub-Planck distances. But if a circular dimension has radius R whose length is larger than the Planck length, its reciprocal 1/R is necessarily a fraction of the Planck length. So what is going on?

If we start in either the Heterotic-E or Type IIA regions and turn the value of the respective string coupling constants up, we migrate toward the center of the map in Figure <<12.11|5a:0>>, and what appeared to be one-dimensional strings stretch into two-dimensional membranes. Moreover, through a more or less intricate sequence of duality relations involving both the string coupling constants and the detailed form of the curled-up spatial dimensions, we can smoothly and continuously move from any point in Figure <<12.11|5a:0>> to any other. Since the two-dimensional membranes we have come upon from the Heterotic-E and Type IIA perspectives can be followed as we migrate to any of the three other string formulations in Figure <<12.11|5a:0>>, we learn that each of the five string formulations involves two-dimensional membranes as well.',

This means that with weak string coupling, in any of the five formulations, all but the strings will be enormously massive\x{2014}orders of magnitude heavier than the Planck mass. Because they are so heavy and, therefore, from E\x{a0}=\x{a0}mc, require such unimaginably high energy to be produced, branes have only a small effect on much of physics (but not on all, as we shall see in the next chapter).

In the central region of Figure <<12.11|5a:0>>, we have a theory whose fundamental ingredients are not just strings or membranes, but rather \"branes\" of a variety of dimensions, all more or less on equal footing. Currently, we do not have a firm grasp on many essential features of this full theory. But one thing we do know is that as we move from the central region to any of the peninsular regions, only the strings (or membranes curled up to look ever more like strings, as in Figures 12.7 and 12.8) are light enough to make contact with physics as we know it\x{2014}the particles of Table 1.1 and the four forces through which they interact. The perturbative analyses string theorists have made use of for close to two decades have not been refined enough to discover even the existence of the super-massive extended objects of other dimensions; strings dominated the analyses and the theory was given the far-from-democratic name of string theory. Again, in these regions of Figure <<12.11|5a:0>> we are justified, for most considerations, in ignoring all but the strings. In essence, this is what we have done so far in this book.

            "At first sight it's hard to imagine any two things more radically different than black holes and elementary particles. We usually picture black holes as the most gargantuan of heavenly bodies, whereas elementary particles are the most minute specks of matter. But the research of a number of physicists during the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Demetrios Christodoulou, Werner Israel, Richard Price, Brandon Carter, Roy Kerr, David Robinson, Hawking, and Penrose, showed that black holes and elementary particles are perhaps not as different as one might think. These physicists found increasingly persuasive evidence for what John Wheeler has summarized by the statement \"black holes have no hair.\" By this, Wheeler meant that except for a small number of distinguishing features, all black holes appear to be alike. The distinguishing features? <<One|9k:0>>, of course, is the black hole's mass. What are the others? Research has revealed that they are the electric and certain other force charges a black hole can carry, as well as the rate at which it spins. And that's it. Any two black holes with the same mass, force charges, and spin are completely identical. Black holes do not have fancy \"hairdos\"\x{2014}that is, other intrinsic traits\x{2014}that distinguish one from another. This should ring a loud bell. Recall that it is precisely such properties\x{2014}mass, force charges, and spin\x{2014}that distinguish one elementary particle from another. The similarity of the defining traits has led a number of physicists over the years to the strange speculation that black holes might actually be gigantic elementary particles.",

But now we see that the answer is yes: Through these physically sensible space-tearing conifold transitions, we can continuously change any given Calabi-Yau space into any other.

Before this expansion, matter that is now in far-flung regions of the cosmos was much closer together than in the standard cosmological model, making it possible for a common temperature to be easily established. Then, through Guth's momentary burst of cosmological inflation\x{2014}followed by the more usual expansion of the standard cosmological model\x{2014}these regions of space were able to become separated by the vast distances we witness currently.
