            'Although this seems paradoxical, let\'s try to pinpoint a precise experiment that would reveal a logical absurdity. The simplest possibility is to arrange things so that when George and Gracie pass one another they both set their clocks to read <<12:00|2>>. As they travel apart, each claims that the other\'s clock is running slower. To confront this disagreement head on, George and Gracie must rejoin each other and directly compare the time elapsed on their clocks. But how can they do this? Well, George has a jetpack that he can use, from his perspective, to catch up with Gracie. But if he does this, the symmetry of their two perspectives, which is the cause of the apparent paradox, is broken since George will have undergone accelerated, non-force-free motion. When they rejoin in this manner, less time will indeed have elapsed on George\'s clock as he can now definitively say that he was in motion, since he could feel it. No longer are George\'s and Gracie\'s perspectives on equal footing. By turning on the jet-pack, George relinquishes his claim to being at rest.',

            "Let's see this, first, from George's perspective. Imagine that every hour, on the hour, George recites into his cell phone, \"It's <<twelve o'clock|6>> and all is well,\" \"It's <<one o'clock|6>> and all is well,\" and so forth. Since from his perspective Gracie's clock runs slow, at first blush he thinks that Gracie will receive these messages prior to her clock's reaching the appointed hour. In this way, he concludes, Gracie will have to agree that hers is the slow clock. But then he rethinks it: \"Since Gracie is receding from me, the signal I send to her by cell phone must travel ever longer distances to reach her. Maybe this additional travel time compensates for the slowness of her clock.\" George's realization that there are competing effects\x{2014}the slowness of Gracie's clock vs. the travel time of his signal\x{2014}inspires him to sit down and quantitatively work out their combined effect. The result he finds is that the travel time effect more than compensates for the slowness of Gracie's clock. He comes to the surprising conclusion that Gracie will receive his signals proclaiming the passing of an hour on his clock after the appointed hour has passed on hers. In fact, since George is aware of Gracie's expertise in physics, he knows that she will take the signal's travel time into account when drawing conclusions about his clock based on his cell phone communications. A little more calculation quantitatively shows that even taking the travel time into account, Gracie's analysis of his signals will lead her to the conclusion that George's clock ticks more slowly than hers.",

            "And finally, a fifth possible means of connecting string theory to observations involves the cosmological constant\x{2014}remember, as discussed in Chapter 3, this is the modification Einstein temporarily imposed on his original equations of general relativity to ensure a static universe. Although the subsequent discovery that the universe is expanding led Einstein to retract the modification, physicists have since realized that there is no explanation for why the cosmological constant should be zero. In fact, the cosmological constant can be interpreted as a kind of overall energy stored in the vacuum of space, and hence its value should be theoretically calculable and experimentally measurable. But, to date, such calculations and measurements lead to a colossal mismatch: Observations show that the cosmological constant is either zero (as Einstein ultimately suggested) or quite small; calculations indicate that quantum-mechanical fluctuations in the vacuum of empty space tend to generate a nonzero cosmological constant whose value is some 120 orders of magnitude (a 1 followed by <<120|3:0>> zeros) larger than experiment allows! This presents a wonderful challenge and opportunity for string theorists: Can calculations in string theory improve on this mismatch and explain why the cosmological constant is zero, or if experiments do ultimately establish that its value is small but nonzero, can string theory provide an explanation? Should string theorists be able to rise to this challenge\x{2014}as yet they have not\x{2014}it would provide a compelling piece of evidence in support of the theory.",

But closer inspection reveals that although arranged in a different order, the \"total energy\" columns of both tables have identical entries.

That is, vibration and winding contributions play complementary roles when the radius of the circular dimension changes from <<10 to 1|10a:0>>/10. And so, as far as total string energies go, there is no distinction between these different sizes for the circular dimension. just as the interchange of fitness-high/valves-low with valves-high/fitness-low is exactly compensated by an interchange of the number of shares held in each company, interchange of radius 10 and radius 1/10 is exactly compensated by the interchange of vibration and winding numbers.

If string theory is right, this is physically identical to the familiar dimensions being circular with incredibly tiny radii of about 1/R=1/10 = 10 times the Planck length! These are our well-known familiar dimensions in an alternate description provided by string theory. In fact, in this reciprocal language, these tiny circles are getting ever smaller as time goes by, since as R grows, 1/R shrinks. Now we seem to have really gone off the deep end. How can this possibly be true? How can a six-foot tall human being \"fit\" inside such an unbelievably microscopic universe? How can such a speck of a universe be physically identical to the great expanse we view in the heavens? Furthermore, we are now led forcefully to the second of our initial three questions: String theory was supposed to eliminate the ability to probe sub-Planck distances. But if a circular dimension has radius R whose length is larger than the Planck length, its reciprocal 1/R is necessarily a fraction of the Planck length. So what is going on?

These physicists found increasingly persuasive evidence for what John Wheeler has summarized by the statement \"black holes have no hair.\" By this, Wheeler meant that except for a small number of distinguishing features, all black holes appear to be alike. The distinguishing features? <<One|9k:0>>, of course, is the black hole's mass. What are the others? Research has revealed that they are the electric and certain other force charges a black hole can carry, as well as the rate at which it spins. And that's it.
