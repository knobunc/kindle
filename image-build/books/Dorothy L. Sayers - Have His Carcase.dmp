            "\x{2018}Well, there was Commander Mellon; he had two of them. But it wouldn\x{2019}t be him, because his ship was blown up and sank with all hands and his kit went down with him. In 1917, that would be. A very gallant gentleman, was the Commander, and of good family. One of the Dorset Mellons. The Duke of Wetherby: he had one, and he was telling me the other day that he still had it; it wouldn\x{2019}t be him. And Mr Pritchard: he had a remarkable experience with his; his personal man went off his head and attacked him with his own razor, but fortunately Mr Pritchard was able to overpower him. They brought him in guilty of attempted murder but insane, and the razor was an exhibit at the trial. I know Mr Pritchard came in afterwards and bought a new razor, a black one, because the other had struck the back of a chair during the struggle and had a piece chipped out of the edge, and he said he was going to keep it as a memento of the narrowest shave of his life. That was very good, I thought. Mr Pritchard was always a very amusing gentleman. Colonel Grimes: he had one, but he had to abandon all his kit in the Retreat over the Marne\x{2014}I couldn\x{2019}t say what happened to that one. He liked that razor and came back for another one similar, and he has it yet. That makes six out of the second dozen. What happened to the others?\x{2014}Oh, I know! There was a very funny story about one of them. Young Mr Ratcliffe\x{2014}the Hon. Henry Ratcliffe\x{2014}he came in one day in a great state. \x{201c}Endicott,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}just you look at my razor!\x{201d} \x{201c}Bless me, sir!\x{201d} I said, \x{201c}it looks as if somebody had been sawing wood with it.\x{201d} \x{201c}That\x{2019}s a very near guess, Endicott,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}My sister-in-law and some of that bright crowd of hers in her studio got the idea that they\x{2019}d have some private theatricals and used my best razor to cut out the scenery with.\x{201d} My goodness, he was wild about it! Of course the blade was ruined for ever; he had a different one after that, a very fine French razor which we were trying out at the time. Then, ah, yes! There was poor Lord Blackfriars. A sad business that was. He married one of these film-stars, and she ran through his money and went off with a dago\x{2014}you\x{2019}ll remember that, my lord. Blew his brains out, poor gentleman. He left his pair of razors to his personal man, who wouldn\x{2019}t part with them on any account Major Hartley had two and so did Colonel Belfridge. They\x{2019}ve left Town and gone to live in the country. I could give you their addresses. Sir John Westlock\x{2014}well, now, I couldn\x{2019}t say for certain about him. There was some sort of trouble and he went abroad, at the time of the Megatherium Scandal. Early in the twenties, wasn\x{2019}t it? My memory isn\x{2019}t what it was. He had a pair of razors. Very fond of a good blade, he was, and looked after it very carefully. Mr Alec Baring\x{2014}that was sad, too. They said it was in the family, but I always thought that flying crash had something to do with it. I suppose they wouldn\x{2019}t let him have razors where he is now. He only had one of that set, as a replacement for one he left in an hotel. How many does that make? Sixteen altogether, not counting the dozen that went to Bombay. Well, that\x{2019}s nearly the lot, because I gave a round half-dozen to my late head-assistant when we broke up the business. He has an establishment of his own in Eastbourne, and is doing very well there, I\x{2019}m told. <<Twenty-two|9k:0>>. Now, what about the last pair?\x{2019}",

There\x{2019}s a train from Wilvercombe that stops at Darley Halt on Thursdays at <<10.15|9c:1>>, to take people in to Heathbury market. Alexis travelled by that train and got out at the Halt. I think it must have been Alexis all right. He was pretty conspicuous with his black beard and his natty gent\x{2019}s outfitting. I think we can take that bit as proved. The guard on the train remembered him, and so did three or four of his fellow-travellers. What\x{2019}s more, his landlady says he left his rooms in time to catch the train, and the booking-clerk remembers him at Wilvercombe.

            "Mr Goodrich, a stout and hearty squire of the old school, was delighted to give any assistance in his power. Mr Martin had turned up at the house at <<about seven o\x{2019}clock|6>> on the Tuesday evening and had asked permission to camp at the bottom of Hinks\x{2019}s Lane. Why Hinks\x{2019}s Lane, by the way? Well, there used to be a cottage there that belonged to an old fellow called Hinks\x{2014}a regular character\x{2014}used to read the Bible through regularly every year, and it was to be hoped it did him good, for a graceless old scamp he was and always had been. But that was donkey\x{2019}s years ago, and the cottage had fallen into disrepair. Nobody ever went down there now, except campers. Mr Martin had not asked for information about camping-grounds; he had asked straight out for permission to camp in Hinks\x{2019}s Lane, calling it by that name. Mr Goodrich had never set eyes on Mr Martin before, and he (Mr Goodrich) knew pretty well everything that went on in the village. He was almost certain that Mr Martin had never been in Darley before. No doubt somebody had told him about Hinks\x{2019}s Lane\x{2014}it was a regular place for campers. They were out of the way down there, and there were no crops for them to damage and no gates for them to leave open, unless they were to go out of their way to trespass on Farmer Newcombe\x{2019}s pasture on the other side of the hedge. But there was no necessity for them to do so, as it didn\x{2019}t lead anywhere. The stream that ran through the pasture came out on to the beach only fifty yards away from the camping-ground and was fresh, except, of course, at flood-tide, when it was brackish. Now Mr Goodrich came to think about it, he believed there had been some complaint from Mr Newcombe about a broken hedge, but the story only came through Geary the blacksmith, who was a notorious talker and he (Mr Goodrich) didn\x{2019}t see that it had anything to do with Mr Martin. Mr Newcombe was not altogether a satisfactory tenant in the matter of repairs to hedges and when there were gaps, animals would sometimes stray through them. Apart from this, he (Mr Goodrich) knew nothing to Mr Martin\x{2019}s discredit. He seemed to have been quiet enough, and in any case, Hinks\x{2019}s Lane being out of sight and sound of the village, campers couldn\x{2019}t make nuisances of themselves down there. Some of them brought gramophones or concertinas or ukuleles, according to their taste and social position, but Mr Goodrich had no objection to their amusing themselves, so long as they didn\x{2019}t disturb anybody. He never made any charge for camping on his ground\x{2014}it didn\x{2019}t hurt him, and he didn\x{2019}t see why he should take payment for letting the poor devils who lived in town help themselves to a mouthful of fresh air and a drink of water. He usually asked them to leave the place as tidy as they could, and as a rule he had found them pretty decent in this respect.",

The land led out upon a flat expanse of rough turf, beyond which a belt of heavy stones and shingle sloped down to the edge of the sea.

            "\x{2018}This was last Monday week, gentlemen. On the Tuesday night, I went down to the sea\x{2014}just over there, at the end of the town, and sat on a seat to think things over. It was getting on for <<midnight|13>>.\x{2019} The words were coming more fluently now, the glass of whisky having no doubt done its work. \x{2018}I looked at the sea and I felt the razor in my pocket and I wondered whether it was worthwhile struggling on. I was terribly depressed. I had come quite to the end of my resources. There was the sea, and there was the razor. You might think that the use of a razor would come natural to a hairdresser, but I can assure you gentlemen that the idea of using it for that purpose seems just as horrible to us as it would to you. But the sea\x{2014}washing up against the wall of the Esplanade\x{2014}it seemed to call me, if you can understand what I mean. It sounded as if it was saying: \x{201c}Chuck it, chuck it, chuck it up, Bill Simpson.\x{201d} Fascinating and frightening at the same time, as you might say. All the same, I\x{2019}ve always had a horror of drowning. Helpless and choking, and the green water in your eyes\x{2014}we all have our special nightmares, and that one\x{2019}s mine. Well, I\x{2019}d sat there for a bit, trying to make up my mind, when I heard somebody walking along, and presently this young fellow came and sat down on the seat beside me. He was in evening dress, I remember, with an overcoat and a soft hat. He had a black beard\x{2014}that was about the first thing I noticed, because it\x{2019}s not very usual on a young man in this country, except he might be an artist, perhaps. Well, we got into conversation\x{2014}I think he started it by offering me a cigarette. It was one of those Russian ones, with a paper tube to it. He spoke friendly, and, I don\x{2019}t know how it was, I found myself telling him all about the fix I was in. You know how it is, my lord. Sometimes you\x{2019}ll get talking to a stranger where you wouldn\x{2019}t to anybody you knew. It struck me he didn\x{2019}t feel so very happy himself, and we had a long talk about the general damnableness of life. He said he was a Russian and an exile and told me about the hard times he\x{2019}d had as a kid, and a lot of stuff about \x{201c}Holy Russia\x{201d} and the Soviet. Seems as if he took it to heart a lot. And women and all that\x{2014}seemed as though he\x{2019}d had some trouble with his best girl. And then he said he only wished his difficulties could be solved as easy as mine, and how I ought to pull myself together and make a fresh start. \x{201c}You give me that razor,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}and go away and think it over.\x{201d} So I said the razor was my livelihood, such as it was, and he laughed and said, \x{201c}In the mood you\x{2019}re in, it\x{2019}s more likely to be your deathlihood.\x{201d} A funny way he had of talking, quick and sort of poetic, you know. So he gave me some money\x{2014}five pounds it was, in Treasury notes\x{2014}and I gave him the razor. \x{201c}What\x{2019}ll you do with that, sir?\x{201d} I said, \x{201c}it\x{2019}s no good to you.\x{201d} \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll find a use for it,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}never you fear.\x{201d} And he laughed and put it away in his pocket. Then he got up and said, \x{201c}Funny we should drop across one another tonight,\x{201d} and something about \x{201c}two minds with but a single thought.\x{201d} And he clapped me on the shoulder and told me to buck up and gave me a pleasant nod and away he went, and that\x{2019}s the last I saw of him. I wish I\x{2019}d known what he wanted with the razor, or I wouldn\x{2019}t have given it to him, but there! how was I to know, I ask you, gentlemen?\x{2019}",

At <<1.30|9e>> he leaves the Feathers, comes down here, gets the mare and rides off along the shore. We see where he spilt the oats with which he got her to come to him and we see the gap he made getting her through the hedge. He rides along through the edge of the water, so as to leave no marks. He tethers the mare to the ring that he has driven into the rock; he kills Alexis and rides back in a deuce of a hurry. In crossing the rough pebbles below Pollock\x{2019}s cottage, the mare casts a shoe. That doesn\x{2019}t worry him, except that it lames the nag a bit and delays him. When he gets back, he doesn\x{2019}t return the mare to the field, but lets her run. Like that, it will look as though she broke out of the field on her own, and will easily explain the gap, the lameness, and the shoe, if anybody finds it. Also, if the horse should be found still blown and sweaty, it will appear perfectly natural.

That is to say, considered as a murder, it was obscure; on the other hand, the evidence for suicide was perhaps a little strengthened, though only negatively. Instead of the sinister Martin, who might have been anybody, they now had merely Mr Henry Weldon, whom they knew.

Moreover, the fact that he had been known for five years as the bespectacled Haviland Martin of the tinted glasses, robbed his latest masquerade of half its significance.

Within fifteen minutes the bell rang and Superintendent Glaisher was learning from Mrs Morecambe\x{2019}s maid that her mistress was staying at Heathbury Vicarage. A call to the vicarage received immediate attention. Yes, Mrs Morecambe was staying there; yes, she was at home; yes, they would fetch her; yes, this was Mrs Morecambe speaking; yes, she distinctly remembered driving a gentleman in dark glasses from Darley to Wilvercombe and back last Thursday; yes, she thought she could remember the times; she must have picked him up <<about ten o\x{2019}clock|6>>, judging by the time she had started out from Heathbury, and she knew she had dropped him in Darley again at <<one o\x{2019}clock|6>>, because she had consulted her watch to see if she would be in time for her luncheon and tennis party at Colonel Cranton\x{2019}s, the other side of Heathbury. No, she had never seen the gentleman before and did not know his name, but she thought she could identify him if required. No trouble at all, thanks\x{2014}she was only glad to know that the police had nothing against her (silvery laughter); when the maid said the Superintendent was on the phone she had been afraid she might have been trespassing on the white lines, or parking in the wrong place or something. She would be staying at the vicarage till next Monday and would he happy to assist the police in any way. She did hope she hadn\x{2019}t been helping a gangster to escape or anything of that sort.",

Now, if Harriet had not been there, what would have happened? In a few hours the tide would have covered the body. Pause there, Morocco. If Weldon was the murderer, he would not want the body lost. He would want his mother to know that Alexis was dead. Yes; but under ordinary circumstances the body would have turned up sooner. It was the violent south-west wind and the three hundred sovereigns that had combined to keep the body hidden. And the body had been found, even so. Well, then. If Harriet had not found the body when she did, there would have been nothing to show that the death had not occurred earlier\x{2014}say between n and 1.30\x{2014}the period for which there was the alibi. In fact, the victim\x{2019}s arrival at that early hour at Darley Halt made it look much more likely that the earlier hour was the right one. Why should you tempt your victim to a lonely spot at <<11.30 a.m.|2a>> and then wait two and a half hours before polishing him off\x{2014}except in order to create a presumption that you had really killed him earlier? And then, too, there was that crusty pair, Pollock and his grandson, with their grudging evidence that they had seen Alexis \x{2018}lying down\x{2019} on the Flat-Iron at <<1.45|9c:1>>. They must be in it too. That was it. That must be it. The murder was meant to look like a morning murder\x{2014}and that was why there had been that curious insistence on the alibi and the journey to Wilvercombe. \x{2018}Always suspect the man with the cast-iron alibi\x{2019}\x{2014}was not that the very first axiom in the detective\x{2019}s book of rules?

It looked queer\x{2014}because it was intended to look queer. It was asking, clamouring for investigation. It existed simply and solely to distract attention from the crucial hour of <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>>. And if only Harriet had not come upon that freshly slain corpse, how well the plan might have succeeded. But Harriet had been there, and the whole structure had collapsed under the shock of her evidence. That must have been a blow indeed. No wonder Weldon was doing his best to discredit that awkward testimony as to the time of the death. He knew better than anyone that death at <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>> was no proof of suicide, whatever it might appear to a coroner\x{2019}s jury.

I\x{2019}d looked at my watch a mile or so back and it said <<five-and-twenty to two|10>>, and I thought I\x{2019}d push along to the shore and have my meal there. When I looked at it again it still said <<five-and-twenty to two|10>>, and I found it had stopped, so I knew time must be getting on. I saw a kind of little lane going down towards the sea, so I turned down that way. There was an open space at the foot of it with a motor-car and a little tent, and a man doing something to the car. I hailed him and asked what the time was. He was a big man with dark hair and a red face, and he wore coloured spectacles. He told me it was <<five minutes to two|10>>. I set my watch going and thanked him and then I just said something pleasant about what a nice camping-place he had found. He grunted rather rudely, so I thought perhaps he was put out by his car being out of order, so I just asked him\x{2014}most politely\x{2014}whether there was anything wrong. That was all. I can\x{2019}t think why he should have taken offence but he did. I expostulated with him and said I only asked out of politeness and to know if I could help him in any way, and he called me a very vulgar name and\x{2014}\x{2019} Mr Perkins hesitated and blushed.",

The family dinners had been eaten as usual at <<twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and after dinner there was the ironing to finish. There was a sight of washing, as Mr Ormond could see for himself, for Mrs Pollock and Mrs Moggeridge to deal with.

The gentleman was wearing hornrimmed spectacles and he came up the lane \x{2018}somewhere between <<half-past three|10>> and <<four|20a>>,\x{2019} and went straight off along the road towards Lesston Hoe.

            "Why, yes, he remembered Thursday, 18th. Day as the poor young man was found dead at the Flat-Iron. A beautiful day, surely, only a bit blowy towards evening. He always notices any strangers that came through. He remembered seeing a big open car come past at <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>>. A red one it was, and he even knew the number of it, because his great-grandson, little Johnnie\x{2014}ah! and a bright lad he was -had noticed what a funny number it was. OIOIOI\x{2014}just like you might be saying Oy, oy, oy. Mr Gander could call to mind the day when there wasn\x{2019}t none o\x{2019} them things about, and folks was none the worse for it, so far as he could see. Not that Mr Gander was agin\x{2019} progress. He\x{2019}d always voted Radical in his young days, but these here Socialists was going too far, he reckoned. Too free with other folks\x{2019} money, that\x{2019}s what they were. It was Mr Lloyd George as give him the Old Age Pension, which was only right, seeing he had worked hard all his life, but he didn\x{2019}t hold with no dole for boys of eighteen. When Mr Gander was eighteen, he was up at <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> every morning and on the land till sunset and after for five shillings a week and it hadn\x{2019}t done him no harm as he could see. Married at nineteen he was, and ten children, seven of them still alive and hearty. Why, yes, the car had come back at <<one o\x{2019}clock|6>>. Mr Gander had just come out from the Feathers after having a pint to his dinner, and he see the car stop and the gentleman as was camping in the lane get out of it. There was a lady in the car, very finely rigged out, but mutton dressed as lamb in Gaffer\x{2019}s opinion. In his day, women weren\x{2019}t ashamed of their age. Not that he minded a female making the best of herself, he was all for progress, but he thought they were going a bit too far nowadays. Mr Martin, that was the gentleman\x{2019}s name, had said good morning to him and gone into the Feathers, and the car had taken the Heathbury road. Why, yes, he\x{2019}d seen Mr Martin leave. <<Half-past one|10>> it were by the church clock. A good clock, that was. Vicar, he\x{2019}d had it put in order at his own expense two years ago and when they turned the wireless on, you might hear Big Ben and the church clock striking together quite beautiful. There hadn\x{2019}t been no wireless in Mr Gander\x{2019}s day, but he thought it was a great thing and a fine bit of progress. His grandson Willy, the one that was married on a woman over to Taunton, had give him a beautiful set. It was that loud, he could hear it beautiful, even though his hearing was getting a little hard. He\x{2019}d heard tell as they were going to show you pictures by wireless soon, and he hoped the Lord might spare him long enough to see it. He hadn\x{2019}t nothing against wireless, though some people thought it was going a bit far to have the Sunday services laid on like gas, as you might say. Not but what it might be a good thing for them as was ailing, but he thought it made the young folks lazy and disrespectful-like. He himself hadn\x{2019}t missed going to Sunday church for twenty year, not since he broke his leg falling off the hayrick, and while he had his strength, please God, he would sit under vicar. Why, yes, he did remember a strange young man coming through the village that afternoon. Of course he could describe him; there wasn\x{2019}t nothing wrong with his eyes, nor his memory neither, praise be! It was only his hearing as wasn\x{2019}t so good but, as Mr Ormond might have noticed, you had only to speak up clear and not mumble as these young people did nowadays and Mr Gander could hear you well enough. One of these rickety-looking town-bred fellows it was, in big glasses, with a little bag strapped to his back and a long stick to walk with, same as they all had. Hikers, they called them. They all had long sticks, like these here Boy Scouts, though, as anybody with experience could have told them, there was nothing like a good crutch-handled ash-plant to give you a help along when you were walking. Because, it stood to reason, you got a better holt on it than on one of they long sticks. But young folks never listened to reason, especially the females, and he thought they was going a bit far, too, with their bare legs and short pants like football players. Though Mr Gander wasn\x{2019}t so old neither that he didn\x{2019}t like to look at a good pair of female legs. In his days females didn\x{2019}t show their legs, but he\x{2019}d known men as would go a mile to look at a pretty ankle.",

If the relations between them had not been what they were, it would have been only fair to ring him up and tell him about the corpse with the cut throat. But under the circumstances, the action might be misinterpreted. And, in any case, the thing was probably only the dullest kind of suicide, not worth bringing to his attention. Not nearly so complicated and interesting a problem, for instance, as the central situation in The Fountain-Pen Mystery. In that absorbing mystery, the villain was at the moment engaged in committing a crime in Edinburgh, while constructing an ingenious alibi involving a steam-yacht, a wireless time-signal, five clocks and the change from summer to winter time. (Apparently the cut-throat gentleman had come from the Wilvercombe direction. By road? by train? Had he walked from Darley Halt? If not, who had brought him?) Really, she must try and concentrate on this alibi. The town-clock was the great difficulty. How could that be altered? And altered it must be, for the whole alibi depended on its being heard to strike <<midnight|13>> at the appropriate moment. Could the man who looked after it be made into an accomplice? Who did look after town-hall clocks? (Why gloves? And had she left her own finger-prints on the razor?) Was it, after all, going to be necessary to go to Edinburgh? Perhaps there was no town-hall and no clock. A church-clock would do, of course. But church-clocks and bodies in belfries had been rather overdone lately. (It was odd about Mr Perkins. If the solution was murder after all, could not the murderer have walked through the water to some point? Perhaps she ought to have followed the shore and not the coast-road. Too late now, in any case.) And she had not properly worked out the speed of the steam-yacht. One ought to know about these things. Lord Peter would know, of course; he must have sailed in plenty of steam-yachts. It must be nice to be really rich. Anybody who married Lord Peter would be rich, of course. And he was amusing. Nobody could say he would be dull to live with. But the trouble was that you never knew what anybody was like to live with except by living with them. It wasn\x{2019}t worth it. Not even to know all about steam-yachts. A novelist couldn\x{2019}t possibly marry all the people from whom she wanted specialised information. Harriet pleased herself over the coffee with sketching out the career of an American detective-novelist who contracted a fresh marriage for each new book. For a book about poisons, she would marry an analytical chemist; for a book about somebody\x{2019}s will, a solicitor; for a book about strangling, a\x{2014}a hangman, of course. There might be something in it. A spoof book, of course. And the villainess might do away with each husband by the method described in the book she was working on at the time. Too obvious?
