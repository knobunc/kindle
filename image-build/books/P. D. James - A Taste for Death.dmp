This unlikely pair of companions had left Miss Wharton\x{2019}s flat in Crowhurst Gardens <<just before half past eight|10>> to walk the half-mile stretch of the Grand Union Canal to St. Matthew\x{2019}s Church. Here Miss Wharton, as was her custom each Wednesday and Friday, would weed out the dead flowers from the vase in front of the statue of the Virgin, scrape the wax and candle stubs from the brass holders, dust the two rows of chairs in the Lady Chapel, which would be adequate for the small congregation expected at that morning\x{2019}s early Mass, and make everything ready for the arrival at <<nine twenty|5b>> of Father Barnes.",

Darren, who liked best this part of the walk, gave a whoop and rushed into the tunnel, hollering for an echo and running his hands, like pale starfish, along the brick walls. She followed his leaping figure, half-dreading the moment when she would pass through the arch into that claustrophobic, dank, river-smelling darkness and would hear, unnaturally loud, the suck of the canal against the paving stones and the slow drip of water from the low roof. She quickened her pace, and within minutes the half moon of brightness at the end of the tunnel had widened to receive them again into the daylight and he was back, shivering at her side.',

It occurred to him that he had reached the age when a man looks forward to his pleasures less keenly than in youth but is disproportionately aggrieved when his plans are upset. There had been the usual time-consuming, wearying and slightly acrimonious preliminaries to the setting up of the new squad in CI, and already his mind was reaching out with relief to the solitary contemplation of alabaster effigies, sixteenth-century glass and the awesome decorations of Winchfield. But it looked as if Paul Berowne wasn\x{2019}t proposing to take much time over their meeting. His plans might still be possible.

            "The change of subject was obviously welcome, and Father Barnes was voluble on the subject of Harry. Poor Harry was a problem for St. Matthew\x{2019}s. For some reason, no one knew why, he had for the last four months taken to sleeping in the south porch. He usually bedded down on newspapers and covered himself with an old blanket which he sometimes left in the porch, ready for the next night, and sometimes took away, rolled into a long wad and tied around his stomach with string. Father Barnes, when he found the blanket, hadn\x{2019}t liked to remove it. After all, it was Harry\x{2019}s only covering. But it wasn\x{2019}t really convenient to have the porch used as a shelter or as a storage for Harry\x{2019}s odd and rather smelly belongings. The Parochial Church Council had actually discussed whether they ought to install railings and a gate, but that had seemed uncharitable, and there were more important things to spend their money on. They had difficulty in meeting their diocesan quota as it was. They had all tried to help Harry, but he wasn\x{2019}t easy. He was known at the Wayfarers\x{2019} Refuge in Cosway Street in St. Marylebone, an excellent place, where he usually got a <<midday|13>> meal and medical attention for minor ailments when he needed it. He was a little too fond of drink and would occasionally get into fights. St. Matthew\x{2019}s had liaised with the refuge about Harry, but they hadn\x{2019}t known what to suggest. They had tried to persuade Harry to have a bed in their dormitory, but he wouldn\x{2019}t agree. He couldn\x{2019}t bear the intimate contact with other people. He wouldn\x{2019}t even eat his dinner at the refuge. He\x{2019}d put it between slabs of bread, then take it away to eat in the streets.

            "After leaving the church Dalgliesh went briefly back to the Yard to pick up his file on Theresa Nolan and Diana Travers, and it was <<after midday|13>> before he arrived at 62 Campden Hill Square. He had brought Kate with him, leaving Massingham to supervise what remained to be done at the church. Kate had told him that at present there were only women in the house, and it seemed sensible that he should have a woman with him, particularly as it was Kate who had first broken the news. It was not a decision he had expected Massingham to welcome, and nor had he. These first interviews with the next of kin were crucial and Massingham wanted to be there. He would work with Kate Miskin loyally and conscientiously because he respected her as a detective and that was what he was required to do. But Dalgliesh knew that Massingham still half-regretted the days when women police officers were content to find lost children, search female prisoners, reform prostitutes, comfort the bereaved and, if they hankered for the excitement of criminal investigation, were suitably occupied coping with the peccadillos of juvenile delinquents. And, as Dalgliesh had heard him argue, for all their demands for equality of status and opportunity, putting them in the front line behind the riot shields, taking the petrol bombs, the hurled stones and, now, the bullets, only made the job of their male colleagues even more onerous. In Massingham\x{2019}s view the instinct to protect a woman in moments of high danger was deep-seated and ineradicable, and the world would be a worse place if it weren\x{2019}t. He had, as Dalgliesh knew, grudgingly respected Kate\x{2019}s ability to look down at the butchered bodies in St. Matthew\x{2019}s vestry and not be sick, but he hadn\x{2019}t liked her the better for it.",

On the opposite wall was a bank of stage designs, drawings and costumes for what looked like Shakespearean productions.

A side table was covered with signed photographs in silver frames. <<Two|9k:0>>, flamboyantly signed, were from minor European ex-royalty.

Thin crustless bread and butter, a plate of cucumber sandwiches, homemade scones with cream and jam, a fruitcake. It reminded him of childhood rectory teas, of visiting clergy and parish workers balancing their wide-brimmed cups in his mother\x{2019}s shabby but comfortable drawing room, of himself, carefully schooled, handing round plates. It was odd, he thought, that the sight of a coloured plate of thinly cut bread and butter could still evoke a momentary but sharp pain of grief and nostalgia. Watching Nellie as she carefully aligned the handles, he guessed that all their life was governed by small diurnal rituals: early-morning tea, the cocoa or milk last thing at night, beds carefully turned down, nightdress and pyjamas laid out. And now it was <<five fifteen|5b>>, the autumn day would soon be darkening into evening and this small, very English tea ceremony was designed to propitiate the afternoon furies. Order, routine, habit, imposed on a disorderly world. He wasn\x{2019}t sure that he would like to live with it, but as a visitor he found it soothing and he didn\x{2019}t despise it.

Then she had been a privileged spectator; but now she felt like an outcast, yearning for this distant, unattainable paradise from which she was forever excluded.

She had telephoned Emma, who had come into the Civil Service with her from Reading, and who was now a Principal in the Department of Health and Social Security.

            "As simple as that, thought Dalgliesh. The lost hours accounted for, the wedge of mud on his shoe explained. He had gone, not to his mistress, but to a woman whom he had seen only once before in his life, who asked no questions, made no demands, who had given him those remembered moments of peace. He had wanted to spend those few hours where no one in the world knew where to find him. And he must have gone straight from Paddington to St. Matthew\x{2019}s Church. They would have to check the times of the trains, how long the whole journey was likely to have taken. But whether or not Lady Ursula was lying, it seemed highly unlikely that Berowne could have called in at his house, collected his diary, and still arrived at the church at <<six|9c:1>>.",

She dressed carefully for the excursion; first impressions were always important. Before setting out, she knelt to pray briefly that the visit might be a success, that she would be met with understanding, that Scotland Yard wouldn\x{2019}t be the terrifying place of her imagination, that Commander Dalgliesh or Inspector Miskin would be willing to talk to the local authority, to explain that she wouldn\x{2019}t even mention the murders to Darren if his social worker thought it unwise. She walked to Paddington underground station and took the Circle Line. At St. James\x{2019}s Park Station she came out of the wrong exit, was for a few minutes lost and had to enquire the way to the Yard. And suddenly, across the road, she saw the revolving sign and the great glass oblong building so familiar from television news pictures.",

            'There was no answer at the vicarage and all the windows were dark, and then he remembered from his first visit to the church that the noticeboard had shown <<Evensong|13>> at <<four|3j>> on Thursdays. Father Barnes would presumably be in church. And so it proved. The great north door was unbolted, and when he turned the heavy iron handle and pushed it open he was met by the expected waft of incense and saw that the lights were on in the Lady Chapel and that Father Barnes, robed only in his surplice and stole, was leading the responses. The congregation was larger than Dalgliesh had expected and the mutter of voices came to him clearly in a gentle, disjointed murmur. He seated himself in the front row just inside the door and sat to listen in patience to <<Evensong|13>>, that most neglected and aesthetically satisfying portion of the Anglican liturgy. For the first time since he had known it, the church was being used for the purpose for which it had been built. But it seemed to him subtly changed. In the branched candleholder where, only last Wednesday, his single light had burned there was now a double row of candles, some newly lit, others flickering with their last tremulous flame. He felt no impulse to add to the glitter. In their light the Pre-Raphaelite face of the Madonna with her flare of crimped and yellow hair under the high crown shone glossily as if newly painted and the distant voices came to him like the ominous premonitory mutterings of success.',

Suddenly he wasn\x{2019}t there, and Swayne felt a wild apprehension until he saw that the boy had climbed down into the ditch and was now reappearing, his hands stretched round the rim of an old cycle wheel. He began bowling it along the towpath. The wheel lurched and bounded. Swayne stepped out of his hiding place and caught it. The boy, no more than twelve yards away, stopped short, looked at him, wary as an animal, seemed about to turn and run. At once Swayne smiled and bowled the wheel back. The boy caught it, still fixing on him his steady unsmiling gaze. Then he swung it round, clumsily twirling, staggered and let it go. It rose out over the water, then fell with a splash which seemed to Swayne so loud that he half expected the canal path to be suddenly alive with people.

The assistant might remember him, but then, who was going to ask? The theft would be seen as an unimportant break-in. And afterwards he would throw the chisel in the canal. Without the chisel to match with the marks on the edge of the box, how could they possibly link him with the crime? It was too long for his jacket pocket, so he placed it with the gun in the canvas bag. It amused him to carry over his shoulder that innocuous commonplace bag, to feel the weight of the gun and the chisel bumping against his side. He had no fear of being stopped. Who would want to stop him, a respectably dressed young man walking quietly home at the end of the day? But the assurance was more deeply rooted. He walked the drab streets head high, invincible, and could have laughed aloud at the grey, stupid faces, staring ahead as they passed him, or bent to the ground as if instinctively searching the pavement in the hope of finding a dropped coin. They were corralled in their hopeless lives, endlessly trudging the same bare perimeters, slaves of routine and convention. He alone had had the courage to break free. He was a king among men, a free spirit. And in a few hours he would be on his way to Spain to the sun. No one could stop him. The police had nothing to justify holding him, and now the only physical evidence linking him with the scene of crime was within his reach. He had enough money to last for the next two months and then he would write to Barbie. The time wasn\x{2019}t ripe to tell her yet, but one day he would tell her and it had to be soon. The need to tell someone was becoming an obsession. He had nearly confided in that pathetic spinster over drinks at the St. Ermin\x{2019}s Hotel. Afterwards he had been almost frightened by that urge to confess, to have someone marvel at his brilliance, his courage. He would tell Barbie. It was Barbie who had a right to know. He would tell her that she owed her money, her freedom, her future to him. She would know how to be grateful.",

No wonder, he thought, men have always feared it, like the anger of God. And then, immediately, came the rain spilling from the porch roof in a solid wall of water. It would be ridiculous to set out for the vicarage through such a storm. He would be soaking wet in seconds.
