            "It\x{2019}s odd that Hilary and the other two are here at all, waitressing at Camp Adanaqui; it\x{2019}s not as if they need the money. (Not like me, thinks Joanne, who haunts the mail desk every <<noon|13>> to see if she got her scholarship.) But it\x{2019}s the doing of their mothers. According to Alex, the three mothers banded together and jumped Mrs. B. at a charity function, and twisted her arm. Naturally Mrs. B. would attend the same functions as the mothers: they\x{2019}ve seen her, sunglasses pushed up on her forehead, a tall drink in her hand, entertaining on the veranda of Mr. B.\x{2019}s white hilltop house, which is well away from the camp proper. They\x{2019}ve seen the guests, in their spotless, well-pressed sailing clothes. They\x{2019}ve heard the laughter, the voices, husky and casual. Oh God don\x{2019}t tell me. Like Hilary.",

When she\x{2019}d negotiated her way as usual past the snoopy landlady on the ground floor and arrived on tiptoe at his door, he pulled her inside roughly and bent her backwards in a tipsy, mocking embrace. She started to giggle, but he kissed her seriously and pushed her onto the bed. If he couldn\x{2019}t have what he wanted he would at least have something. The bristles of her shaved legs rasped against him; her breath smelled like grape bubble gum. When she began to protest, warning him again of the danger of pregnancy, he said it didn\x{2019}t matter. She took this as a marriage proposal. In the event, it was <<one|9f>>.",
