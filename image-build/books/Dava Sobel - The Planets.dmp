            "Despite the increased population of the Solar System, its planets stayed stable at <<nine|9c:0>>, at least through 1992. That year, a small, dark body, independent of Pluto, was detected on the Solar System\x{2019}s periphery. Similar discoveries soon followed, until the total number of diminutive outliers grew to seven hundred over the ensuing decade. The abundance of mini-worlds made some astronomers wonder whether Pluto should continue to be regarded as a planet, or reclassified as the largest of the \x{201c}trans-Neptunian objects.\x{201d} (The Rose Center has already excluded Pluto from the planetary roll call.)",

It was a bona fide new planet\x{2014}of another star. Astronomers had long suspected that stars other than the Sun might have their own planetary systems, and now the first one had surfaced at 51 Pegasi, in the constellation of the flying horse. Within months, other \x{201c}exoplanets\x{201d}\x{2014}as the newly discovered extra-solar planets were quickly dubbed\x{2014}turned up at stars such as Upsilon Andromedae, 70 Virginis b, and PSR 1257+12. <<Nearly 200|9n:0>> additional exoplanets have since been identified, and refinements in discovery techniques promise to uncover many more in the near future.

There, dusk falls and dawn breaks twice on the same day, and the stars come out with the Sun still overhead.

At that rate, almost double the Earth\x{2019}s pace, Mercury takes only eighty-eight Earth-days to complete its orbital journey. The same Procrustean gravity that accelerates Mercury\x{2019}s revolution, however, brakes the planet\x{2019}s rotation about its own axis. Because the planet forges ahead so much faster than it spins, any given locale waits half a Mercurian year (about six Earth-weeks) after sunup for the full light of <<high noon|13>>. Dusk finally descends at year\x{2019}s end. And once the long night commences, another Mercurian year must pass before the Sun rises again. Thus the years hurry by, while the days drag on forever.",

Gassendi\x{2019}s comment about the small size of Mercury, however, generated big surprise. His formal report stressed his astonishment at the planet\x{2019}s smallness, explaining how he at first dismissed the black dot as a sunspot, but presently realized it was moving far too quickly to be anything but the winged messenger himself. Gassendi had expected Mercury\x{2019}s diameter to be one-fifteenth that of the Sun, as estimated by Ptolemy fifteen hundred years before. Instead, the transit revealed Mercury to be only a fraction of that dimension\x{2014}less than one-hundredth the Sun\x{2019}s apparent width. The aid of the telescope, coupled with Gassendi\x{2019}s sighting Mercury silhouetted against the Sun, had stripped the planet of the blurred, aggrandizing glow it typically wore on the horizon.",

            "Still Mercury frustrated observers who wanted to know what it looked like. One German astronomer postulated a dense cloud layer completely shrouding Mercury\x{2019}s surface. In Italy, Giovanni Schiaparelli of Milan decided to track the planet overhead in daylight, despite the Sun\x{2019}s glare, in the hope of getting clearer views of its surface. By pointing his telescope upward into the <<midday|13>> sky, instead of horizontally during dawn or dusk, Schiaparelli avoided the turbulent air on Earth\x{2019}s horizon, and also succeeded in keeping Mercury in his sights for hours at a time. Beginning in 1881, avoiding coffee and whiskey lest they dull his vision, and forswearing tobacco to the same end, he observed the planet on high at its every elongation. But the pallor of Mercury against the daytime sky confounded his efforts to perceive surface features. After eight years at this Herculean task, Schiaparelli could report nothing but \x{201c}extremely faint streaks, which,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}can be made out only with greatest effort and attention.\x{201d} He sketched these streaks, including one that took the shape of the number five, on a rough map of Mercury he issued in 1889.",
