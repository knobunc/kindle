She was dreadfully alarmed, and started to run home as fast as she could. Then she heard an engine started up and hid herself in the bushes, thinking that the bad man was pursuing her in the car. Nothing came, however, and after a time she ventured out again and hurried home. Just as she got inside her own gate, a car flashed past at a furious pace towards Kirkcudbright. She got into the cottage just as the kitchen clock was striking <<ten|11>>. She rushed into the bedroom and jumped into bed, just as she was, and pulled the clothes over her head.',

All next day she refused to tell them anything, but the next night she had woken them up three times by crying out in her sleep that the bad man was coming to kill her. On Wednesday evening, her father, who made a great pet of the child, succeeded in getting the story out of her, and when they heard the name of Campbell mentioned they decided that the police ought to be told.

The bridge is the common club and gathering-place of the Gatehouse population, who meet there for the exchange of gossip, the counting of passing cars and rising trout, and the discussion of local politics. Even if, by a miracle, the bridge should have been clear on both occasions, there was the long bench outside the Anwoth Hotel, on which fishermen sit to tie knots, pat Bounce the dog and inquire of Felix the cat how many rats he has killed during the day.

It seemed the best way of getting Drewitt out of the house, so I put on a coat and went up with him. He\x{2019}d hired a car from somewhere or other and he ran me along. He wanted me to go aboard and meet his whelp, but I didn\x{2019}t want to do that. I hadn\x{2019}t made up my mind, you see.

            "\x{2018}Yes \x{2013} I can give you the itinerary if you want it. We dropped down the estuary with the morning tide, passing the Ross Light some time before <<10|9c:1>>. Then we held on across Wigtown Bay, passing Barrow Head fairly close in. We had a good southeasterly breeze and made the Mull about tea-time. Then we followed the coast northwards, passing Portpatrick at <<about 7 o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and anchored for the night in Lady Bay, just outside Loch Ryan. I can\x{2019}t give you more details than that, as I\x{2019}m no yachtsman. That was Tuesday. On Wednesday we lazed about and did a bit of fishing, and then, about lunch-time, the wind started to haul round to the south-west and Drewitt said he thought we\x{2019}d better run across to Larne instead of carrying on up to Gourock as we intended. We put in at Larne for the night and took some beer and stuff aboard. On Thursday it was fine enough, but blowing rather a lot, so we sailed up to Ballycastle. It was a bally place, too. I began to think I was wasting my time, I was sick, too. Friday was a foul beast of a day, raining like hell and blowing. However, Tom Drewitt seemed to think it was the kind of day he liked to be out in. Said he didn\x{2019}t care how it blew, provided he had plenty of sea-room or words to that effect. We staggered across to Arran, and I was sick all the time. That was the day I got this crack on the head, curse it. I made Tom put in somewhere under the lee of the island, and in the night the wind dropped, thank God! This morning we got up to Gourock and I shook the dust of the beastly boat off my feet. No more sailing-boats for me, thank you. For complete boredom and physical misery, commend me to a small sailing-vessel in a gale of wind. Have you ever tried cooking fish on a dirty little oil-stove, with your knees above your head? Oh, well, perhaps you enjoy that sort of thing. I don\x{2019}t. Nothing but fish and corned beef for four days \x{2013} that\x{2019}s not my idea of amusement. Go on up the coast, indeed! Not on your sweet life, I told him. I got off that damned old wherry as quick as I bloody well could, and went on by train to Glasgow and got a hot bath and a shave, and my God! I needed them. And I was just starting off to catch the <<5.20|5a:1>> to Dumfries, when these police imbeciles came along and collared me. And now, do you mind telling me what it\x{2019}s all about?\x{2019}",

I simply cannot believe that, if it took place as you say at the cottage, between <<midnight|13>> and morning, it could have done so without disturbing Ferguson. Campbell was a powerful man, and, unless he was battered to death in his sleep, there would have been a noise and a struggle. Given the characters of all the people concerned, I cannot bring myself to believe that this was a case of a <<midnight|13>> assassin, creeping stealthily up to Campbell\x{2019}s bedroom and felling him with one blow, before he had time to cry out. It is, in particular, exceedingly unlike what one might expect from Farren. On the other hand, if there was a noisy fight, I cannot understand why Ferguson heard nothing of it. It was August, the windows would be wide open, and, in any case, besides the actual noise of the quarrel, there would be a great deal of going to and fro in the night, taking the corpse out to the car and so on, that Ferguson could scarcely have failed to hear.",

But we know he was still there at <<five past eleven|10>>, so we\x{2019}ll have to give him till then.

Hammond would meet him with the two-seater some place between Barrhill and Girvan, and he would be provided with any necessary tackle for securing the bicycle to the car. They would drive together to just this side of Girvan, where Hammond would alight, take the bicycle and proceed to Ayr, contriving whether by design or mischance to lose the bicycle in the station. It will be remembered that the person travelling with the bicycle was said to speak like an Englishman. Gowan then proceeded with the car to some point from which he could write and dispatch his letter to Major Aylwin.

It showed a morning lighting \x{2013} he remembered that Campbell had been seen painting <<a little after 10 o\x{2019}clock|6>>. The grey stone bridge lay cool in the golden light, and the berries of a rowan-tree, good against witchcraft, hung yellow and red against it, casting splashes of red reflection upon the brown and white of the tumbling water beneath. Up on the left, the hills soared away in veil on veil of misty blue to meet the hazy sky. And splashed against the blue stood the great gold splendour of the bracken, flung in by spadefuls of pure reds and yellows.",

He may not have bothered about anything very complicated, but he\x{2019}d make haste to dissociate himself from this place as quickly as possible. And I don\x{2019}t fancy he\x{2019}d be anxious to show himself in Newton-Stewart or Creetown. There\x{2019}s nowhere much for him to go northward \x{2013} it only takes him up into the hills round Larg and the Rhinns of Kells. He could go up to Glen Trool, but there\x{2019}s not much point in that; he\x{2019}d only have to come back the same way. He might, of course, follow the Cree back on the eastern bank as far as Minniegaff, avoiding Newton-Stewart, and strike across country to New Galloway, but it\x{2019}s a long road and keeps him hanging about much too close to the scene of the crime. In my opinion, his best way would be to come back to the road and go north-west by Bargrennan, Cairnderry, Creeside and Drumbain, and strike the railway at Barrhill. That\x{2019}s about nine or ten miles by road. He could do it, going briskly, in an hour, or, as it\x{2019}s a rough road, say an hour and a half. Say he finished the painting at <<11 o\x{2019}clock|6>>, that brings him to Barrhill at <<12.30|9c:1>>. From there he could get a train to Stranraer and Port Patrick, or even to Glasgow, or, of course, if he dumped the bicycle, he might take a motor-bus to somewhere. If I were you, I\x{2019}d have a hunt in that direction.\x{2019}",

But the murderer\x{2019}s got to be an artist, and a clever one, for that painting would have to pass muster as Campbell\x{2019}s work. He must know how to drive a car, and he must possess, or have access to, a bicycle. He must be fairly hefty, to have carried the body up here on his back, for I see no signs of dragging. He must have been in contact with Campbell <<after 9.15|5a:0>> last night, when I saw him leave the McClennan Arms alive and kicking. He must know the country and the people pretty well, for he obviously knew that Campbell lived alone with only a charwoman coming in, so that his early morning departure would surprise nobody. He either lives in the same way himself, or else had a very good excuse for being up and out before breakfast this morning. If you and a man who fulfils all these conditions, he\x{2019}s probably the right one. His railway-ticket, if he took one, ought to be traceable. Or it\x{2019}s quite possible I may be able to put my finger on him myself, working on different lines and with rather less exertion.\x{2019}",
