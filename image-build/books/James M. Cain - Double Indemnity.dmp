The second is, the time, the place, the way, all known in advance\x{2014}to us, but not to him. The third is, audacity. That\x{2019}s the one that all amateur murderers forget. They know the first two, sometimes. But that third, only a professional knows. There comes a time in any murder when the only thing that can see you through is audacity, and I can\x{2019}t tell you why. You know the perfect murder? You think it\x{2019}s this swimming pool job, and you\x{2019}re going to do it so slick nobody would ever guess it. They\x{2019}d guess it in two seconds, flat. In three seconds, flat, they\x{2019}d prove it, and in four seconds, flat, you\x{2019}d confess it. No, that\x{2019}s not it. The perfect murder is the gangster that goes on the spot. You know what they do? First they get a finger on him. They get that girl that he lives with. Along <<about six o\x{2019}clock|6>> they get a phone call from her. She goes out to a drugstore to buy some lipstick, and she calls. They\x{2019}re going to see a picture tonight, he and she, and it\x{2019}s at such and such a theatre. They\x{2019}ll get there <<around nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>. All right, there\x{2019}s the first two elements. They got help, and they fixed the time and the place in advance. All right, now watch the third. They go there in a car. They park across the street. They keep the motor running. They put a sentry out. He loafs up an alley, and pretty soon he drops a handkerchief and picks it up. That means he\x{2019}s coming. They get out of the car. They drift up to the theatre. They close in on him. And right there, in the glare of the lights, with a couple hundred people looking on, they let him have it. He hasn\x{2019}t got a chance. Twenty bullets hit him, from four or five automatics. He falls, they scram for the car, they drive off\x{2014}and then you try to convict them. You just try to convict them. They\x{2019}ve got their alibis ready in advance, all airtight, they were only seen for a second, by people who were so scared they didn\x{2019}t know what they were looking at\x{2014}and there isn\x{2019}t a chance to convict them. The police know who they are, of course. They round them up, give them the water cure\x{2014}and then they\x{2019}re habeas corpused into court and turned loose. Those guys don\x{2019}t get convicted. They get put on the spot by other gangsters. Oh yeah, they know their stuff, all right. And if we want to get away with it, we\x{2019}ve got to do it the way they do it, and not the way some punk up near San Francisco does it, that\x{2019}s had two trials already, and still he\x{2019}s not free.",

This park, they call it a park, but it\x{2019}s really a scenic drive, up high above Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley, for people in cars, and a hilly ride for people on horses. People on foot don\x{2019}t go there much. What I was going to do was let her get in and then start up the hill. When I came to one of those platforms where the road is graded to a little flat place so people can park and look over the valley, I was going to pull in, and say something about parking there, so we could talk. Only I wasn\x{2019}t going to park. The car was accidentally on purpose, going to roll over the edge, and I was going to jump. As soon as I jumped I was going to dive into the bridle path, race on down to my car, and drive home. From where I was going to park Sachetti\x{2019}s car to where I was going to run her over the edge was about two miles, by road. But by bridle path it was only a hundred yards, on account of the road winding all through the hills for an easy grade, and the bridle path being almost straight up and down.
