In oriental fashion he had appreciated Hercule Poirot\x{2019}s courteous refusal to rush him in any way. Now, in his own good time, he was willing to elaborate the theme of the Crale family.",

Dr. Faussett stated that Mr. Amyas Crale of Alderbury had died suddenly and that in consequence of the circumstances of that death and also of a statement made to him by a Mr. Blake, a guest staying in the house, he considered that it was a case for the police.",

On her way, however, she met Mr. Meredith Blake and entrusted her errand to him, herself returning to Mrs. Crale whom she felt might be in need of someone. Dr. Faussett arrived on the scene a quarter of an hour later. He saw at once that Mr. Crale had been dead for some time\x{2014}he placed the probable time of death at between <<one|90>> and <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>>. There was nothing to show what had caused death. There was no sign of any wound and Mr. Crale\x{2019}s attitude was a perfectly natural one. Nevertheless Dr. Faussett, who was well acquainted with Mr. Crale\x{2019}s state of health, and who knew positively that there was no disease or weakness of any kind, was inclined to take a grave view of the situation. It was at this point that Mr. Philip Blake made a certain statement to Dr. Faussett.\x{201d}",

According to Miss Greer, he later complained of stiffness in the limbs and grumbled that he must have got a touch of rheumatism. But he was the type of man who hates to admit to illness of any kind, and he undoubtedly tried not to admit that he was feeling ill. His irritable demand that he should be left alone and the others go up to lunch was quite characteristic of the man, I should say.\x{201d}",
