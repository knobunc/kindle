Two Nobel physics laureates, Max von Laue, who won the prize in 1914 for his discovery of X-ray diffraction, and James Franck, who won it in 1925 for producing experimental confirmation of the quantization of energy, deposited their medals for safe keeping with Niels Bohr at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen.

In that year, Richard Ford, who had inherited Abraham Darby\x{2019}s pioneering iron foundry at Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, showed that it was possible to vary the amount of coke or coal added to the ore in order to produce iron that was either brittle or tough.

            "The redistribution of wealth and power was also one objective of the Carbonari, revolutionary precursors of the Risorgimento that would lead to the unification of Italy in 1871. They began as a secret society in the Kingdom of Naples, formed to resist French occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, taking their name from the Italian for charcoal burner, carbonaro. Their flag was red, blue and black for charcoal, only later becoming the red, white and green of modern Italy. The impulses of the Carbonari were patriotic, liberal and secular. After the defeat of Napoleon, they directed their efforts against their new overlords, the Austrians and the allied Papal States. The movement spread and, in 1820, after a number of failed uprisings, the Carbonari staged patriotic rebellions in several Italian cities. <<Shortly after eight in the evening|9h>> of Friday 8 December 1820, the poet Lord Byron, then living in Ravenna, was caught up in one of these dramas when a powerful local Carbonari chief was assassinated. In Don Juan, he describes \x{2013} \x{2018}This is a fact, and no poetic fable\x{2019} \x{2013} how he heard shots and ran out of his home to find the man lying in the street: \x{2018}for some reason, surely bad, / They had slain him with five slugs\x{2019}.

The research began at Berkeley, but following the American entry into the war and the setting up of the Manhattan Project, the locus of the effort to synthesize plutonium moved to Chicago. Seaborg worked here for three years until <<1945|18:0>> in a building called, with deliberate obfuscation, the Metallurgical Laboratory, or Met Lab. The first task was to build an atomic pile in which slugs of uranium were stacked in such a way that they would undergo a chain reaction to produce element number ninety-four. At the start, the sought-for element was referred to simply as 94, but, as this was a little obvious, the chemists brightly adopted the code number 49 instead and took to calling it \x{2018}copper\x{2019}. This was fine until one experiment actually required some copper, which then had to be distinguished by calling it \x{2018}honest-to-God copper\x{2019}.",

The Swede Carl Scheele was the first to isolate the gas in 1774, noting its green colour, choking power and bleaching effect on litmus paper and plants. He made the discovery in pursuit of one of the great chemical projects of the day: to confirm whether or not all acids contained oxygen. Well-known acids such as sulphuric and nitric were known to contain oxygen. Hydrochloric acid, then known as muriatic acid (after muria, the Latin for brine), was a mystery. Antoine Lavoisier even called it oxymuriatic acid, believing its acidity had to be linked to oxygen. Scheele succeeded in obtaining chlorine during the course of his own experiments with this acid. However, this did not prove the absence of oxygen. It was not until <<1810|18:0>> that this was done by Humphry Davy, who confirmed that the gas Scheele had isolated was indeed an element, by combining muriatic acid with his own newly discovered metal, potassium, and obtaining from the reaction only potassium chloride and hydrogen gas \x{2013} no oxygen.",

            "Meanwhile, the couple continued to chase down the radioactive species linked to barium using a new sample of pitchblende. They succeeded just before Christmas, this time obtaining unequivocal evidence for the existence of another new element, even more radioactive than polonium, to which they gave the name radium. The salts of barium and radium are more soluble than those of bismuth and polonium. It made sense to try to isolate radium by repeatedly boiling up salt solutions and then cooling them slowly so that pure radium chloride, which was marginally less soluble than barium chloride, crystallized out first. Marie set out to tackle this immense challenge in 1899. She acquired ten tonnes of pitchblende residue, already more radioactive than the basic ore. It came in sacks of brown dust mixed with pine needles. Processing the material in twenty-kilogramme batches, she turned the primitive \x{2018}hangar\x{2019} of a laboratory into a factory with cauldrons of boiling radioactive liquor in various stages of preparation.

            "One of the several distinct innovations of Johannes Gutenberg that leads us to claim him as the father of printing was his adoption of lead for type. Gutenberg had some training as a goldsmith and was a skilled metallurgist by the time, <<around 1440|9n:0>> while living in Strasbourg, he turned his mind to the problem of printing. He saw that the presses used locally for wine-making might be adapted to press lettering on to paper, but for the lettering to be changeable so that different texts might be printed, he would need a material with special properties. It would have to be highly mouldable to take the intricate shape of each letterform, but also sufficiently durable to bear repeated impact on the paper. For fully movable type, each small piece comprising a single letter would furthermore have to remain loose so that, once released from the press, it could be rearranged to set new text. Gutenberg\x{2019}s answer \x{2013} also reached independently in Korea around the same time \x{2013} was to use lead alloyed with tin and a little antimony. This made the metal flow better while molten and yet form a harder letter when solid.

Many equally eccentric schemes were essayed in the years that followed, spurred on by the obvious need for a more effective means of communication than the visual methods of flags and lights used by relays of signalmen during the Napoleonic Wars.

Adding a proton to an atomic nucleus transmutes it into a different chemical element one unit heavier; adding a neutron merely converts it into a heavier isotope of the same element. To the physicist, it seems unfair that it is only the former that warrants a new name. Notwithstanding this, Armbruster has been involved in many naming decisions. Until 1992, he tells me, it was the discoverer\x{2019}s right to choose a name, but this has changed in response to the priority disputes of the Cold War so that claimants are now only permitted to put forward names as suggestions.

The official justification is that it completed a nesting geographic set along with europium and germanium (Darmstadt, Hesse, Germany, Europe), and was a fitting response to Seaborg and Ghiorso\x{2019}s earlier naming of americium, californium and berkelium (an event which prompted the New Yorker to quip that if only the researchers could now find universitium and ofium their work would be complete). \x{2018}This bad tradition was established by Berkeley. We wanted to do it for Europe,\x{2019} says Armbruster. It seems that nationalism begets nationalism. But there is a more subtle patriotic subtext here too \x{2013} an historical reassertion of Germanic strength in nuclear physics. For Armbruster\x{2019}s favourite of the six elements he has helped to name is number 109, meitnerium, named after the partly Jewish Austrian physicist Lise Meitner. Working in Berlin, and then in Stockholm and Copenhagen in exile from the Nazi regime <<after 1938|18:0>>, Meitner was one of the discoverers of nuclear fission, the process whereby atomic nuclei split to release massive amounts of energy. (Her work also demonstrated why the elements heavier than uranium could not be stable.) Meitner achieved this in the face of Nazi persecution and discrimination against women wherever she went. \x{2018}I was convinced that she was a very important part of nuclear physics in the twentieth century,\x{2019} says Armbruster. \x{2018}And she had all the disadvantages you can have.\x{2019}",
