            "Major League Baseball was an example. Segregation led to the creation of about two hundred all-black professional baseball teams. They had black coaches, black managers, and black owners and were the leading black entertainment\x{2014}according to some historians, a bigger draw than even music. Black baseball produced some of the best players and some of the best teams in the history of the sport. Then, in 1946, Major League Baseball was integrated, starting with Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby. A handful of Negro League stars were picked up, such as Satchel Paige, who pitched for Cleveland on the 1948 World Series Champion Cleveland Indians. Soon white Major League Baseball was skimming off the best of the black players, and black baseball lost its fans and was no longer commercially viable. But at no time has Major League Baseball offered more than a fraction of the jobs in baseball that the Negro Leagues had. There was only a smattering of black players, a few black coaches, rare black managers and general managers, and no black owners until <<2012|9c:0>>, when basketball star Magic Johnson became owner of the Dodgers. So some could ask, why was this progress? And although this was an example of successful integration, by 1964 most attempts such as schools had had little success.",

            "As whites left for the suburbs, the neighborhood had gone from one third black in 1950 to 96 percent black in 1960. It was happening all over Detroit, which by 1967 was 40 percent black. But the police force was largely white and known for harassing young blacks, using words such as nigger. The vice squads were particularly infamous, and one such group raided a Twelfth Street club expecting to round up a handful of people. Instead there were eighty-two people inside celebrating the return of two Vietnam veterans. Hugely outnumbered, the police decided to attempt to arrest all eighty-two. The situation erupted so rapidly that the police lost control of the city and federal troops were brought in the next morning. After five days of fighting for control of the city\x{2019}s black neighborhoods, 43 people were killed, 1,189 injured, and more than 7,000 people were arrested. <<Almost four|9:0>> out of five victims were blacks shot by police or National Guardsmen. In one of the most famous incidents, the subject of John Hersey\x{2019}s The Algiers Motel Incident, the police shot three unarmed black teenagers in a hotel. The youngest victim of the violence was Tonya Blanding, a four-year-old girl shot in the chest with a\x{a0}.50-caliber bullet from a tank that opened fire on her housing complex when they mistook the lighting of a cigarette for sniper fire.",

            "By <<1954|9:1>> black R&B recordings were garnering enough sales to occasionally slip onto the white pop charts, and by 1955 R&B music had gone from a backwater subculture of popular music aimed at ghettos and southern villages to a \$25-million-a-year industry. The established record industry noticed this but generally dismissed it as a passing trend. Blacks making inroads on white music charts were no more welcome than blacks moving in on any other established white turf. It was when whites started taking prominent positions on the charts with what seemed to be black music, even sung and performed in a somewhat black way, that the record industry started to react. This happened in 1955, when Decca released a white group, Bill Haley and the Comets, singing \x{201c}Rock Around the Clock,\x{201d} and again in 1956 when RCA scored a phenomenal commercial success with Elvis Presley. This was music that appeared to have equal appeal to blacks and whites, a new phenomenon in the music industry that suggested both money (good) and social change (bad).",

            "They picked up the tempo and turned the waltz, a song that ironically constantly repeats the word blue, into the blues, but with a hard beat. It was rhythm & blues. To listen to the slow and sentimental waltz in 3/4 time and then hear it souped up to an upbeat 4/4 with an insistent beat is the quickest way to understand what rock \x{2019}n\x{2019} roll was all about. In fact, for years, rock hits were created by switching an existing piece to four-beat measures with an upbeat tempo.

            "In the 1930s GM embraced the idea of changing every car every year, a policy that other car companies adopted, so that, by the 1950s there was great excitement every year to see what the new cars would be like. New models took two years to develop, so the car companies were always working on the future. By <<1955|9:0>> the car industry was offering 272 models a year. Automatic transmissions, which made it easy for anyone to learn to drive, became standard equipment by the 1950s. The cars were ever larger, with little competition from small foreign models built for fuel efficiency. Detroit\x{2019}s cars were huge and imposing, with fins and other design flairs suggestive of space travel, with tremendously powerful engines that were capable of greater speeds than the still undeveloped highway system allowed. In 1955, the year Gordy worked on a different assembly line, Chevrolet produced the Bel Air, with a \x{201c}small,\x{201d} newly designed eight-cylinder engine, the V8, a gas-slurper that produced 162 horsepower. But for an additional \$59, a modified version was available with a bigger carburetor and a different manifold, an air cleaner, duo-exhausts, and a 180-horsepower engine. It has become one of the most collectible vintage cars.",
