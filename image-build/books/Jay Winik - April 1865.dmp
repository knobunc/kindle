He was sick, dispirited, and even his hands were routinely cold and clammy. And today, the weather itself seemed to be colluding with his foul and melancholy mood. That morning, heavy clouds moved over Washington, as they had the day before and the day before that, whipping the capital with blasts of rain and wind.

            "By <<1859|9n:0>>, with its population of almost 40,000, Richmond was not the largest city in the South. Slightly smaller than Charleston, it had less than a quarter of New Orleans\x{2019}s population and even ranked behind Louisville, Kentucky. But it was surely unique. Unlike the Deep South, it was distinctly more diverse: with its commitment to public education, it had six public schools as well as a college for women; with its commitment to religious pluralism, it had thirty-three Protestant churches that were complemented by three Jewish synagogues, three Roman Catholic churches, a Quaker meeting house, and a Universalist church. With its four newspapers jockeying for attention, its political voice was often broad and remarkably lively. Not surprisingly, as the war came, few doubted that the city was anything but an impressive blend of rural provincialism and urban potential; its atmosphere of high breeding and noblesse oblige made it distinctly Southern, but its diverse economy, heterogeneous population, and moderate outlook gave it a lusty, cosmopolitan air that solidly fastened it in the mold of the larger United States\x{2014}unusual in the antebellum South. And, in a young country still very much struggling with its national identity, Richmond and Richmond alone among the great cities could bask in the golden age of Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison, making it a trenchant portrait of the young American republic.",

The Confederates were almost entirely surrounded, outnumbered <<nearly six to one|10>>, with little food, little hope of resupply, little prospect for immediate reinforcement. But there was still the distinct prospect of escape, especially if those fires were of cavalry, not infantrymen. And before the opportunity slipped away, Lee hoped to turn the momentary lull to his advantage. Six straight days of Lee\x{2019}s relentless march westward had not dimmed his audacity, his remaining men\x{2019}s courage, or his desire to avoid surrender and somehow salvage victory. He devised another plan for breaking through the enemy lines: his men would attack as soon as possible, attempting to slice a hole through Grant\x{2019}s slumbering army, and if successful, they would resume the march southward. General John Gordon, one of Lee\x{2019}s most daring officers, was chosen to lead the breakout.

            "By way of a profession, Lincoln was a self-taught lawyer and a successful one at that, earning up to \$5,000 a year by the 1850s, but law per se never held much appeal for him. Politics did. Not the Jacksonian Democrats of his father, which he rejected, but the new roads, central banking, and protective tariffs of the National Republicans and Whigs. From the start, Lincoln saw his role as a champion of the budding middle class. \x{201c}Republicans,\x{201d} he memorably put it, \x{201c}are for both the man and the dollar.\x{201d} He gave his first stump speech at nineteen, and the pleasant taste stayed with him long after that, \x{201c}Politics were his life, newspapers his food, and his great ambition his motive power,\x{201d} his law partner Herndon wrote. At <<twenty-three|9:0>>, only seven months after coming to the little Illinois community of New Salem, Lincoln was already running for office. He lost. But contrary to the way he liked to tell it, success soon came to him; two years later, in 1834, Sangamon County sent him to the lower Illinois house. From this time on to the end of his life\x{2014}except for the years between 1849 and 1854, when his political prospects were at their lowest ebb\x{2014}he was either campaigning, serving in office, or out on the stump for other office seekers.",

What could have been more incongruous? This was, after all, just five days after the giddy glow of Appomattox. But as a long wooden coffin was quietly edged down the narrow lodging house steps on Tenth Street, through the mud and onto the roads, carrying Abraham Lincoln\x{2019}s body back to the White House, flags drooped to half-mast everywhere and the muffled ringing of bells could be heard against the rain. Now it was the voices of revenge that could be heard loudest. Citizens poured into the streets, in the downpour, and soon they were nothing more than muttering mobs, a hostile throng angrily congregating from K Street to Lafayette Square: they shook their fists at Ford\x{2019}s Theater, shouting \x{201c}Burn the theater!\x{201d}; a cascade of ugly roars and boos spontaneously swelled up, fell, then continued even more loudly; any mention of Confederates brought an equally vociferous reprise: \x{201c}Shoot them!\x{201d} \x{201c}Hang them!\x{201d} \x{201c}Hang them again!\x{201d} \x{201c}Kill the god damn rebels!\x{201d} Talk of streets running red with Confederate blood was everywhere. And with the iron hand of martial law imposed upon the Union capital, the city remained edged with fear. In every direction, a phalanx of armed guards sought to keep order, manning stations on all roads to and from the city. Government departments and business houses were abruptly closed; the city was immediately cordoned off; routine market wagons, milk carts, and mail riders were turned around and sent back beyond the outskirts; theaters and music halls hastily canceled their engagements; and concerts and social functions were postponed indefinitely. But if the streets threatened to turn crimson with vengeance, they were just as quickly tinged with the real color of sorrow. Black was ubiquitous. So, too, were the telltale sounds of mourning. The White House columns were draped in black, and somber black folds were looped along all the Federal buildings. The melancholy sound of organs rippled across town, and altar candles were lit. Soldiers fastened shreds of darkened crepe and cut rib bon on their sleeves. Even the poor pinned scraps of black cloth in their windows and on their modest doorposts.",

It was one thing to profit from slavery or to own slaves; it was quite another for a well born gentleman to buy and sell slaves for a living.

Whatever his legacy, one has to consider the incident at Fort Pillow, which has been debated by contemporary observers and historians ever since it happened on that fateful day of April 12, 1864. The basic facts are well known. As part of a series of ten separate engagements over several weeks, Forrest came across the Union garrison of Fort Pillow on the Mississippi River. This garrison had little special strategic meaning, although capturing it would be a significant morale booster for the South. But it mattered for other reasons: it was manned by locally recruited Unionists whom Forrest derided as \x{201c}Tennessee Tories\x{201d} and some 270 blacks, mostly escaped slaves, whom Forrest labeled a \x{201c}damned nigger regiment.\x{201d} Forrest issued his customary demand for surrender, adding, if not, \x{201c}I cannot be responsible for the fate of your command.\x{201d} Not only did the fort commander refuse, but the cocky Federals openly taunted Forrest, daring him to try to take the garrison. It was the mistake of their lives. The assault came quickly, and within hours, Fort Pillow had devolved into little more than a lurid slaughter pen: many of the blacks, estimated at <<100|3:0>>\x{2014}and a number of whites as well\x{2014}were not allowed to surrender and were butchered in cold blood instead, even as they fell to their knees and with uplifted hands screamed for mercy.

As was often the case, Forrest was outnumbered, this time <<almost two to one|10>>, but he was un-fazed.

In effect, the reader will see that I have applied the notion of contingency to the period of April 1865. Also see James McPherson in \x{201c}American Victory, American Defeat\x{201d} in Gabor S. Boritt\x{2019}s important edited work, Why the Confederacy Lost (Oxford University Press, 1992), esp. 40\x{2013}41, and Boritt\x{2019}s \x{201c}Introduction\x{201d} in that same work, 14, as well as E. H. Carr, What Is History? (Penguin, 1980). In this little gem of a book, Carr refers to \x{201c}an unending dialogue between the present and past.\x{201d} For other viewpoints, see Geoffrey Barraclough, An Introduction to Contemporary History (Penguin, 1977), <<9\x{2013}42|5a:0>>, and History in a Changing World (Penguin, 1955), 14; and Hugh Trevor-Roper, The Rise of Christian Europe (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1975), 7\x{2013}33- Also see Gary Gallagher\x{2019}s review essay \x{201c}Civil War Military Leaders Reassessed,\x{201d} Reviews in American History 23 (1995), where he asserts that new studies should \x{201c}ask different questions,\x{201d} 226. Daniel Boorstin sums up this task of historical inquiry nicely: while seeking to create \x{201c}an original vision,\x{201d} \x{201c}the successful historian at his best demands and secures a willing suspension of knowledge. He asks the reader to pretend that he does not already know \x{2026} and adds new drama to everything we thought we already knew,\x{201d} Hidden History, 22. of decisions made, but also one of decisions rejected: On this point, see discussion in \x{201c}Introduction\x{201d} in Stephen E. Ambrose, Americans at War (Berkley, 1998), ix-xvi. Ambrose makes the point that \x{201c}history is about people, leaders and led.\x{201d} He further notes that in history, \x{201c}nothing is inevitable.\x{201d} Author-columnist William Safire once offered me this spirited question: \x{201c}What if Lincoln had lost the 1864 election? Which almost happened \x{2026}\x{201d} Gabor S. Boritt, invoking French thinker Raymond Aron, warns that \x{201c}overlooking the \x{2018}might have beens\x{2019} may prevent the full understanding of \x{2018}the have-beens\x{2019} that make up history,\x{201d} Boritt, \x{201c}Introduction,\x{201d} esp. 5. The spirit of these points by Ambrose, Safire, Boorstin and Boritt, and McPherson on \x{201c}contingency\x{201d} or \x{201c}turning points,\x{201d} suffuse this study. For further discussion, see the essay \x{201c}The Fool Who Saved the Nation, and Other Historical What-If\x{2019}s,\x{201d} New York Times, July 17, 1999, and Robert Cowley\x{2019}s excellent essay \x{201c}The Road Not Taken,\x{201d} MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History 10, no. 3 (Spring 1998): 64\x{2013}89. Cowley writes, \x{201c}Might-have-beens lead us to question long-held assumptions\x{201d} and they \x{201c}define true turning points.\x{201d} He adds that \x{201c}small changes are likely \x{2026} to have major repercussions,\x{201d} 65; also George M. Frederickson, Why the Confederacy Did Not Fight a Guerilla War After the Fall of Richmond: A Comparative View (Gettysburg College, 35th Annual Fortenbaugh Memorial Lecture), another outstanding discussion; and Howard Mean\x{2019}s novelistic treatment, CSA\x{2014}The Confederate States of America (Morrow, 1998). \x{201c}hoarse cry of vengeance\x{201d}: Quote in Leech, 400.

Roper stresses that history should not remove \x{201c}the sense of wonder,\x{201d} \x{201c}the unpredictability,\x{201d} and \x{201c}therefore the freshness [events] ought to have,\x{201d} 24. Restoring the sense of contingency, and the freshness, to the events of April 1865 is precisely in this vein. Trevor-Roper also encourages historians to \x{201c}occasionally trespass into less familiar circumstances,\x{201d} 7. This, too, I have done.",

What did not change: See 407\x{2013}30 for this paragraph in Boorstin, esp. 417\x{2013}18; also see Kenneth Stampp, The Imperiled Union, Essays on the Background of the Civil War (Oxford University Press, 1980), esp. Stampp chapter on \x{201c}The Concept of a Perpetual Union,\x{201d} <<3\x{2013}36|5a:0>>, a superb essay and overview on this subject; I draw heavily upon this chapter for the ensuing discussion on union and disunion. The first spark assaulting national unity: See Thomas P. Slaughter, The Whiskey Rebellion: Frontier Epilogue to the American Revolution (Oxford University Press, 1986). This is the best discussion on the matter, a fine scholarly work that is wonderfully narrated. Also see Ambrose, UC, 38\x{2013}43. He calls the rebellion \x{201c}the greatest threat to national unity\x{201d} between the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, 38, adding \x{201c}this threat of secession was quite real,\x{201d} 52; actually, it could be added that as early as 1779\x{2013}80, with the war going badly, discontented farmers in Berkshire County held a convention and threatened to secede from Massachusetts. Washington biographer Smith, Patriarch, 210\x{2013}26, adds that for George Washington \x{201c}nothing less was at stake than the survival of the central government,\x{201d} esp. 226. For further study, see Jeffrey Crow, \x{201c}The Whiskey Rebellion in North Carolina,\x{201d} North Carolina Historical Review 66, no. 1 (1989): <<1\x{2013}28|5a:0>>; Mary Bonsteel Tachau, \x{201c}The Whiskey Rebellion in Kentucky: A Forgotten Episode of Civil Disobedience,\x{201d} Journal of the Early American Republic 2, no. 3 (1982): 239\x{2013}59; and George Connor, \x{201c}The Politics of Insurrection: A Comparative Analysis of the Shays, \x{2018}Whiskey, and Fries\x{2019} Rebellion, Social Science Journal 29, no. 3 (1992): 259\x{2013}81. the next alarum came: For discussion of Virginia and Kentucky resolutions, see Dumas Malone, Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty (Little, Brown, 1962), vol. 3, 395\x{2013}409; also Ethelbert Dudley Warfield, The Kentucky Resolutions of 1796: An Historical Study (Putnam\x{2019}s, 1887); Stampp, Imperiled Union, <<22\x{2013}24|5a:0>>. fatal to the ten-year-old Constitution: Among others, Palmer, World of the French Revolution, 230\x{2013}31; on the threat of secession, for further reading, see Kenneth Stampp, ed., The Causes of the Civil War (Touchstone, 1991). affirmed a basis: Brodie makes this point, too, Thomas Jefferson, 311. during the War of 1812: See James Banner Jr., \x{201c}A Shadow of Secession? The Hartford Convention, 1814,\x{201d} History Today 38 (September 1988): 34\x{2013}41, for excellent overview; quotes from Banner and Stampp, Imperiled Union, unless otherwise noted; also see Banner, To the Hartford Convention: The Federalists and the Origins of Party Politics in Massachusetts, 1789\x{2014}1815 (Knopf, 1970); Reginald Horseman, The War of 1812 (Knopf, 1969); J. C. A. Stagg, Mr. Madison\x{2019}s War: Politics, Diplomacy, and Warfare in the Early American Republic, 1778\x{2013}-1815 Princeton University Press, 1983). Robert Leckie, in The Wars of America (Harper and Row, 1968), states firmly: \x{201c}the Hartford Convention pointed a pistol at the heart of the Union. In simplest terms, New England proposed to defend herself with her own forces financed by tax monies collected within her own borders. As the Federalists well knew, what New England could do the other sections might also do \x{2026},\x{201d} 302. To the horror and disgust of Southerners: Southerners deeply resented the actions of New England, creating profound friction between the two sections. Consider the words of one Southern senator, dripping with sarcasm and disgust: \x{201c}whatever differences of opinion might have existed to the cause of the war, the country has a right to expect that when once invoked on the contest, all Americans would cordially unite \x{2026} as in the South \x{2026} But not so in New England; there great efforts were made to stir up the minds of the people to oppose it. Nothing was left undone to embarrass the financial operations of the government, to prevent the enlistment of troops, to keep back the men and money of New England from service to the Union, to force the president from his Senate. \x{2018}Yes sir,\x{2019} the Island of Elbe! Or a halter! were the alternatives they presented to Madison!\x{201d} Hinton, History and Topography of the United States, 393\x{2013}94. Ultimately, cooler heads prevailed: According to Lawrence Cress, Federalist calls for secession provoked fears of civil war, military despotism, and the kind of demagoguery that had doomed the French Revolution to tyranny, see \x{2018}\x{201c}Cool and Serious Reflection\x{2019}: Federalist Attitudes Toward War in 1812,\x{201d} Journal of the Early Republic (Summer 1987): 123\x{2013}45, esp. 134\x{2013}37. Nullification and secession: Many Southerners, interestingly enough, saw the North as initiating secession. That the mood was raw and bitter long before the Civil War was without doubt. Listen to Southerner Mathew Carey in 1834: \x{201c}demagogues from the eastern states, and regardless of their vital interests, were courting their own destruction by allowing a few restless, turbulent men, to lead them blindfolded to a separation pregnant with their own ruin.\x{201d} And also: \x{201c}\x{2026} if a separation to the latter who have so long been harassed with complaints, the ingratitude, the restlessness, the turbulence, that their patience has been tried almost to endurance.\x{201d} Both quotes in Hinton, History and Topography of the United States, at note, 389. Nor did the studied ambiguities: For following discussion, see Stampp, Imperiled Union; for divergent views, the interested reader may also refer to The Writings and Speeches of Daniel Webster: Speeches in Congress (Little, Brown, 1903), vol. 6; and Richard K. Cralle, ed., Speeches of John C. Calhoun, Delivered in the House of Representatives and in the Senate (Appleton, 1851). Union\x{2019}s perpetuity: See Charles Royster\x{2019}s discussion of how Americans saw their republic as a \x{201c}vulnerable\x{201d} and \x{201c}short-lived\x{201d} one, with no promise of \x{201c}perpetuity.\x{201d} Royster even contends that George Washington thought \x{201c}failure inevitable,\x{201d} The Destructive War: William Tecumseh Sherman, Stonewall Jackson, and the Americans (Vintage, 1993), esp. 146.",

He later went west after March 1805, where his machinations included setting up an independent republic in Louisiana.

Grants critics: Of course, the counterpoint, seen in hind sight, was the difference between strategic and tactical victories; Grant had the resources, men, and material, to spare, as long as the Union was willing to continue fighting; Lee did not have that luxury, and among other things, this campaign practically obliterated his command structure, see Power, Lee\x{2019}s Miserables, 297, and Gallagher, \x{201c}The Army of Northern Virginia in May 1864,\x{201d} 108.",

            "hadn\x{2019}t he bested them before?: Douglas Southall Freeman points out that this retreat, however, was far more difficult than his 1862 Maryland withdrawal and his retreat after Gettysburg, 53. the signs of progress were still promising: Much has been made, rightly, by historians about the loss of will and ebbing morale of Confederate soldiers in the face of repeated deprivations and a now ten-month siege. But as Gary Gallagher points out, perhaps too much. Evidence strongly suggests Confederate soldiers\x{2019} morale held to the very end of the war. Moreover, consider a few facts that stand, he notes, as an index of commitment. The Confederates mobilized 75\x{2013}85 percent of available draft age white males, an astonishing number; one of every three men in uniform died, with 37\x{2013}39 percent killed or wounded in action, a far higher rate of casualties than the Union sustained. By contrast, consider other American wars: 4.2\x{2013}5.7 percent died in the American Revolution; in the War of 1812, 2.4 percent; the War with Mexico, 5.1 percent; World War 1, 5.4 percent; World War II 5\x{2013}8 percent; the Korean War, 2.4 percent; and Vietnam, 7.7 percent. In concrete numbers, it would be as though there were 6 million casualties in WWI\x{2014}or nearly half a million in Vietnam. In the North, Union fatalities were 17.5 percent, but if the rate were comparable to that in the South, the deaths would have been around 385,000. Gallagher asks, \x{201c}how would northern society have stood up to [such] battlefield losses?,\x{201d} 30. The desertion numbers reveal a pattern of shaky support: 200,000 Northern soldiers deserted; another 120,000 evaded conscription; and some 90,000 fled to Canada to avoid the draft, while thousands more congregated in the mountainous counties of Pennsylvania to be out of reach of enrolling officers. Evidence mustered by Gallagher suggests that the North could not have withstood further privations\x{2014}which is to say the war ended in the nick of time; see Gallagher, Confederate War, 31. Also see Elle Lonn\x{2019}s pioneering work on desertion, Desertion During the Civil War (Century, 1928), 205\x{2013}6; Lonn notes, for instance, that some Confederates deserted Lees army in Virginia, going home to check on their families, but then rejoined the army in North Carolina. Also see Gallagher on this point, 28\x{2013}33. It was happening like this: The following sources have been used extensively for Lee\x{2019}s retreat and Grant\x{2019}s pursuit in this chapter, from which quotes are taken, unless otherwise indicated: Freeman, 58\x{2013}133, which remains an outstanding source; Foote, 907\x{2013}43; Stern, End to Valor, 210\x{2013}57; Catton, A Stillness, 342\x{2013}75 (for Union soldier point of view); Korn, Pursuit to Appomattox, 108\x{2013}45; Davis, To Appomattox, 166\x{2013}70, 189\x{2013}99 (Confederate), 200\x{2013}6 (Union), 213\x{2013}31 (Confederate), 231\x{2013}35 (Union), 242\x{2013}66 (Confederate), 266\x{2013}71 (Union), 278\x{2013}328 (Confederate), 329\x{2013}35 (Union), 341\x{2013}67 (Confederate), 367\x{2013}73 (Union); Calkins, Appomattox Campaign, 63\x{2013}184; Trudeau, Campaign to Appomattox, <<3\x{2013}40|5a:0>> (a wonderfully concise and readable overview); Trudeau, Out of the Storm, 89\x{2013}142; Hendrickson, Road to Appomattox, 159\x{2013}86; packed roads and stubby rural cut-throughs: There was variation. The roads themselves often were reasonably straight, at least in spurts; for instance, they were relatively good between Amelia Springs and Farmville, except between Old Genito Road and Deatonsville, Davis, Io Appomattox, 244. once replenished, their lead over Grant solidified: It is worth pointing out that the Union men had this ongoing, almost existential fear that Lee would \x{201c}strike a blow\x{201d} before being crippled by desertions, and when the blow came, it would \x{201c}fall with savage force,\x{201d} Catton, A Stillness, 331. But U. S. Grant was not so forgiving; In fact, Grant thought he would ensnare Lee by April 5. This, of course, did not happen. See for example, Davis, To Appomattox, 173. at his house, Clover Hill: At Clover Hill, over iced tea, Judge Cox\x{2019}s daughter Kate quipped to Lee: \x{201c}General, we will still win. You will join General Johnston in North Carolina, and together you will win!\x{201d} Lee replied: \x{201c}Know this, whatever happens, no men fought better than mine,\x{201d} Davis, To Appomattox, 166\x{2013}70; Trudeau, Campaign to Appomattox, 9. But now, a mere administrative mix-up: To this day, it is not clear just what happened and how; it remains one of the great historical mysteries of this war; Trudeau does say that \x{201c}Lee himself doomed this plan when, on April 4, he decided to stop at Amelia \x{2026} to reprovision his army. The stop accomplished none of Lees intended objectives,\x{201d} \x{201c}A Mere Question of Time\x{2019}\x{201d} 549; of course, it would have been different had there been food; Trudeau further counters that there was \x{201c}something irrational about the whole enterprise \x{2026} Lee made no effective attempt to provide rations in anticipation of the move,\x{201d} 548\x{2013}49. For his part, Calkins says that the heart of the Confederate cause had stopped beating long before its military and political leaders acknowledged the fact, Final Bivouac, 201, 208. I would put it differently. The heart was there, but in light of the, Amelia disaster, the food wasn\x{2019}t\x{2014}and now the Confederate limbs began inexorably to fail, fate and luck \x{2026} smoke of a skirmish: Indeed, on the morning of April 9, Phil Sheridan, on the way to meet with Gordon, narrowly missed getting killed by a Confederate sharpshooter\x{2019}s bullet, Stern, End to Valor, 253.",

He attributed the Confederate defeat to its failure to wage a \x{201c}war of national liberation.\x{201d} He believes, however, that by the fall of Richmond the will of Southerners was too sapped. Boers in South Africa: See Frederickson, Why the Confederacy Did Not Fight a Guerrilla War. The Algerians: On this, see Stampp, \x{201c}The Southern Road to Appomattox,\x{201d} Imperiled Union, 265. Stampp vividly highlights the unrelenting nationalism of Algerian revolutionaries. He concludes, \x{201c}In spite of its great physical superiority [France] had to withdraw.\x{201d} One important point, however, to be added, was Algeria\x{2019}s spectacular willingness not simply to wage guerrilla war, but to resort to what experts in terrorism such as Brian Jenkins of the Rand Corporation and Algerian expert Lisa Anderson call \x{201c}spectacular terrorism\x{201d} against all targets, civilian and otherwise, virtually without limits (oral briefings with staff of the House U.S. Armed Services Committee, 1986, and at Rand Corporation, 1981). in Cambodia: See Elizabeth Becket, When the War Was Over: The Voices of Cambodia\x{2019}s Revolution (Simon and Schuster, 1986), and Jay Winik, U.S. Policy Toward Cambodia in the 101st Congress: A Case Study of Congressional Initiation and Influence in Foreign Policy, doctoral dissertation, Yale University, December 1993.

It could be pointed out that many Confederates were actually taking careful note of this conflict that was just beginning. E. P. Alexander quipped that he was considering going to Brazil and joining the fight against Paraguay, adding this lighthearted note: \x{201c}And, judging from the map \x{2026} for once I would be on the winning side,\x{201d} see Alexander, Fighting for the Confederacy, 531. In truth, he misjudged how difficult that war would be. Another intriguing example of the lack of inevitablity in unequal conflicts could be found\x{2014}by analogy\x{2014}in Michael Howard, War in European History (Oxford University Press, 1976). \x{201c}European artillery, breech loading rifles and machine guns made the outcome of any fighting almost a foregone conclusion,\x{201d} Howard writes\x{2014}\x{201c}but not quite \x{2026} as the British survivors of the Zulu victory at Isandhlwana in 1897 and the Italian survivors of the Ethiopian victory in 1896 would have been able to testify.\x{201d} Howard concludes that success \x{201c}still owed at least as much to the superior cohesion, organization, and above all self-confidence of the Europeans as it did to their weapons,\x{201d} 122\x{2013}23. Therefore, he generally agrees with Beringer, Hattaway, Jones, and Still, Why the South Lost the Civil War, about the need for \x{201c}will.\x{201d} And then, of course, there was the most honorable example to \x{201c}sort of victory which ruins an army\x{201d}: See Asprey, War in the Shadows, 63\x{2013}71; B.

One Davis biographer, Michael Ballard, puts it somewhat differently: Davis did not advocate guerrilla war \x{201c}per se,\x{201d} he suggests. See A Long Shadow: Jefferson Davis and the Final Days of the Confederacy (University of Mississippi Press, 1992).

History should not mask \x{2026} how ill-prepared Lincoln really was for the job: Lincoln biographers would agree with this point. See Donald, 645, note for 292. Concerning Lincoln\x{2019}s objectives at the war\x{2019}s start, Donald points out, rightly in my view, the pitfalls of Lincoln\x{2019}s newness to Washington, his inexperience as an administrator, and his preference to react to events. Black Hawk War: For more, see Harry Pratt, Lincoln in the Black Hawk War (Bulletin of the Abraham Lincoln Association, December 1938), <<3\x{2013}13|5a:0>>. Where, in those darkest moments \x{2026} inner resolve: From Sandburg to Hofstadter and Oates and Donald, all wonderfully capture the depths of Lincoln\x{2019}s depressions and moroseness. Iowa Senator James Harlan, for one, observed Lincoln\x{2019}s moods, Donald, 593. On the very last day of his life, when he was jubilant over Lee\x{2019}s surrender and after he had had his carriage ride with Mary, it is worth recalling that he was suffering from a fierce headache, Leech, 386. That Lincoln could summon the energy, clarity of thought, and measure of strength in a crisis such as this is all the more remarkable\x{2014}not to mention unusual for someone prone to such depressions over a long period of crises, as clinicians point out. By way of comparison, consider Lincoln\x{2019}s secretary of war. Oates reminds us that after one typically hectic day, Stanton nearly broke under the strain\x{2014}and this was early on\x{2014}and an assistant found him alone in his office, sobbing, with his head on his desk, 279. Rather than being worn down, over time, Lincoln became a \x{201c}tough wartime president,\x{201d} Oates, The Man Nobody Knows, 120.",

            "mystical attachment to Union: Ironically, the first person to make this point was Confederate Vice President Alexander H. Stephens, after the war; it was not meant, however, as a compliment, but as a criticism for being unrealistic. Lincoln had his blind spots: This point again recalls his gross inexperience upon entering the presidency. Concerning Lincoln\x{2019}s objectives at the wars start, Donald also points out, rightly in my view, the pitfalls of Lincoln\x{2019}s newness to Washington, his inexperience, and his fatigue. I find the fatigue element least compelling; Lincoln was far more fatigued during the war, and at its last stages, when he arguably made some of his wisest decisions, his recalcitrance toward emancipation: This, along with his colonization schemes, raises for some the ultimate question of whether Lincoln was a racist. In fact, Lerone Bennett Jr., for one, has labeled Lincoln a racist; see \x{201c}Was Abe Lincoln a White Supremacist?,\x{201d} Ebony 23 (February 1968), 35\x{2013}42. For further on this extremely complex subject, including whether Lincoln was or wasn\x{2019}t a racist, see Fehrenbacher, \x{201c}Only His Stepchildren,\x{201d} in Lincoln in Text and Context (Stanford University, 1987), 95\x{2013}112, and George M. Fredrickson, \x{201c}A Man but Not a Brother: Abraham Lincoln and Racial Equality,\x{201d} Journal of Southern History 41 (February 1975): 39\x{2013}58; Lincoln\x{2019}s views fit racist confines of his day and time, and were at times bold, at other times timid, but on the whole, cautiously progressive. This is no small feat, given, as Oates says, \x{201c}slavery was the most inflammable issue of the generation,\x{201d} Ahraham Lincoln, The Man Behind the Myth, 61. Unlike many others, Lincoln did not speak of the physical or innate inferiority of blacks, or of their inability for intellectual development. Donald thus suggests that Lincoln escaped \x{201c}the more virulent strains of racism.\x{201d} This is probably the right way to put it. See his note, 633. But understanding the age in which Lincoln lived is crucial. For instance, in April 1865 it had been only thirty-seven years since the Vatican\x{2019}s ban on Copernicus\x{2019}s De revolutionibus orbium coelestium had been lifted, war began to change things; See, for example, Oates, Man Behind the Myth, 92. anything but the picture of the confident\x{2026} commander in chief: For further on Lincoln\x{2019}s constant search for effective generals, see T. Harry Williams, Lincoln and His Generals (Knopf, 1952). George McClellan: See Kenneth Williams, Lincoln Finds a General: A Military Study of the Civil War (Macmillan, 1949); and Stephen Sear\x{2019}s George B. McClellan: The Young Napoleon (Ticknor and Fields, 1988), an outstanding biography, the actions of a still tentative man: Stephen Ambrose points out another stunning example of Lincoln\x{2019}s early lack of experience and judgment concerning wartime operations. In August 1862, John A. McClernand, an Illinois Democrat wearing a major general\x{2019}s uniform, came to Lincoln and cursed Grant for being too cautious, and said he could take Vicksburg by Christmas. Lincoln and Stanton arranged for McClernand to raise a private \x{201c}army\x{201d} in the Northwest, and he would operate independently of Grant. At first they didn\x{2019}t even tell their general in chief Henry Hallek, and when they did, they ordered him, even more remarkably, to keep it secret from Grant. Eventually, Hallek spoiled McClernand\x{2019}s machinations\x{2014}and inadvertently helped Lincoln\x{2014}by telling Grant the \x{201c}secret,\x{201d} and foiling McClernand\x{2019}s ability to raise an army. See Ambrose, Americans at War, 4\x{2013}5. looked as though the Confederacy could\x{2026} win: \x{201c}The army is tired with its hard and terrible experience,\x{201d} Captain Oliver Wendell Holmes said in the winter of 1862\x{2013}63. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve pretty much made up my mind that the South have achieved their independence.\x{201d} Or there is the example, of course, of Lincoln\x{2019}s famous \x{201c}blind memorandum\x{201d} asking for the resignation of his entire cabinet on August 23, 1864. Before Adanta, he was convinced he would lose the election\x{2014}with all the fateful consequences. As author-columnist William Safire reminds me, anything could then have happened in the war. three Gatling guns: Account in Elmer Davis, History of the New York Times 1851\x{2013}1921 (New York Times, 1921), 60. crying out for peace: For more on Northern antiwar movements, see two older studies that have conflicting interpretations: Wood Gray, The Hidden Civil War: The Story of the Copperheads (Viking, 1942), and Frank Klement, The Copperheads in the Middle West (University of Chicago Press, 1960), and also BC, 760\x{2013}72. the Democratic Party platform: On the Democratic Party and Lincoln\x{2019}s opponents in 1864, see Joel Silby, A Respectable Minority: The Democratic Party in the Civil War Era, 1860-1868 (Norton, 1977), and conversely, T.

Considering the chaos, and some glaring inaccuracies due to lack of adequate sources, some of the early reporting of Lincoln\x{2019}s death and the aftermath was quite accurate. Also see Leech, 395\x{2013}400; Bak, Day Lincoln Was Shot, no; Thomas Reed Turner, Beware the People Weeping: Public Opinion and the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln (LSU Press, 1982), 25\x{2013}52; Lewis, Assassination of Lincoln, 48\x{2013}49, 56, 58\x{2013}59; from which quotes are taken, unless otherwise noted. Talk of streets running red: Across the Union, those who professed the slightest sympathy for the killing of Lincoln put their life in danger\x{2014}literally. Thirty-five-year-old Joseph Shaw, the editor of the Westminster (Maryland) Democrat, was killed in Zachariah\x{2019}s Hotel while defending himself from a hostile mob, who physically broke into his hotel room. They brutally fell upon him and killed him because of \x{201c}disrespectful language\x{201d} about Lincoln \x{bf}n his paper, Turner, Beware the People Weeping, 50\x{2013}51; his press was also destroyed by mob action. In another instance, at the Mission Church in the First Ward, a preacher made some insulting comments about Lincoln in the course of a Sunday sermon; he was dragged from the pulpit, assaulted, then arrested, Leech, 369. Instances like this, of assault, mob rule, or murder, were commonplace in the days that followed. On this also see Glenn, 206\x{2013}9. Wrote the New York Times: Quotes are from April 17, 1865. for under an hour: Remarkably, outside of speculation, it is not known what the two men even talked about. Edwin Stanton \x{2026}, tendered his resignation: Oates describes him \x{201c}as looking exhausted and utterly worn down from illness\x{201d} and strain. He stayed on only because Lincoln prevailed upon him to remain. \x{201c}Reluctantly,\x{201d} Stanton said, he would (Oates\x{2019}s words), \x{201c}stay with Lincoln a little longer,\x{201d} 423. By any measure, Stanton would become one of the most controversial characters of this time period, and then again of the Johnson administration.

I am much indebted to these studies. Other very useful studies that I have used are: Michael DiSalle, Second Choice (Hawthorne, 1966); Merrill Jensen, The Making of the American Constitution (Van Nostrand, 1964); Jonathan Elliot, ed., The Debates on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, vols. 1\x{2013}5 (William S. Hein, 1888); and Edward S. Corwin, The President: Office and Powers 1767\x{2013}1957 (New York University Press, 1991). When the Founders to until that election took place: For this section, see esp. Silva, Presidential Succession, <<1\x{2013}13|5a:1>>, and Wilhelm, \x{201c}Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,\x{201d} 36\x{2013}51; also Michael Dorman, The Second Man: The Changing Role of the Vice Presidency (Delacorte, 1968), 45\x{2013}46. they did not intend for the vice president to become president: Wilhelm agrees with this. He also notes that the delegates at the convention did not consider the matter \x{201c}a major topic.\x{201d} And further, that historical documents still \x{201c}leave the question of why the office was even created a mystery,\x{201d} \x{201c}Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,\x{201d} 214; Jefferson ally William Rives referred to the whole matter of succession as a \x{201c}remote and shadowy inheritance,\x{201d} Silva, Presidential Succession, 114\x{2013}15.

Indeed, for the better part of a half century: On March 1, 1792, Congress did pass a presidential succession law, which provided that a vice president can resign or refuse election in one way only, with a written refusal signed and dated and delivered to the secretary of state, Wilhelm, \x{201c}Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,\x{201d} 213. The law also provided that the president pro tempore of the Senate or speaker of the house would be in line to act as president, until presidential electors were chosen or elected and a special election held. One may ask, why was the secretary of state not put in line? The reason was politics, having to do with Alexander Hamilton\x{2019}s hatred of Thomas Jefferson. On this point, the choleric Fisher Ames, Federalist leader in Massachusetts, gleefully reported to Thomas Dwight: \x{201c}The Secretary of State is struck out of the bill for the future presidency, in case of the first two offices becoming vacant. His friends think it important to hold him up as King of the Romans. The firmness of the Senate kept him out,\x{201d} See Silva, Presidential Succession, 113\x{2013}14; for a larger discussion of congressional actions on this matter, occurring in 1792, 1820\x{2013}21, and 1842, see Silva, Presidential Succession, 112\x{2013}16, 166\x{2013}68. Interestingly, when President Johnson was later impeached, many in Congress asserted that he was still \x{201c}vice president,\x{201d} and for the time, only \x{201c}acting president.\x{201d} Others noted simply that he was serving out \x{201c}Lincoln\x{2019}s term.\x{201d} Indeed, the three original impeachment resolutions introduced by Benjamin F. Loan and John Kelso spoke of \x{201c}the officer now exercising the function pertaining to the office of President of the United States\x{201d}; James Ashley\x{2019}s resolution referred to \x{201c}Andrew Johnson, Vice President and acting President of the United States\x{201d}; and another resolution put it this way: \x{201c}Vice President of the United States, discharging the powers and duties of the office of the President.\x{201d} The Final Judiciary Committee resolutions that impeached him, however, did so as the \x{201c}president.\x{201d} See Silva, Presidential Succession, note on 26 and 27. But even the Founders were not omniscient to So by the time Lincoln lay dying: Silva, Presidential Succession, <<14\x{2013}31|5a:1>>, and conclusions, esp. 166\x{2013}69; Stathis, \x{201c}John Tyler\x{2019}s Presidential Succession\x{201d}; also Chidsey, And Tyler Too, esp. 41\x{2013}53; and Dorm\x{e1}n, Second Man, esp. 45\x{2013}55. hours away in Williamsburg: Some 230 miles and at least twenty-one hours, to be exact. This in itself was a telling fact about the lack of importance of the vice presidency. Washington was alive with fierce speculation: Chidsey writes that the capital was in a \x{201c}state of pitiful bewilderment\x{201d} over the succession issue. \x{201c}Learned statesman everywhere were asking themselves the question\x{201d} of succession, which had been left \x{201c}in the air.\x{201d} the cabinet would run the show: As Chidsey puts it: \x{201c}That this amiable Virginian might become \x{2026} the full time, undisputed president, Webster did not for a moment believe\x{201d}; moreover, the secretaries assembled \x{201c}were to rule the nation in Tyler\x{2019}s name,\x{201d} And Tyler Too, 44\x{2013}45. Before relatively newer scholarship, Tyler\x{2019}s succession had been blandly portrayed by some as almost devoid of political intrigue. See Oliver Chitwood, John Tyler: Champion of the Old South (D. Appleton, 1939), 202\x{2013}6; Leonard Dinnerstein, \x{201c}The Accession of John Tyler to the Presidency,\x{201d} Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 70 (October 1952): 447\x{2013}58; Robert Seager, And Tyler Too (Easton Press, 1963). Tyler had won the showdown: Claude Fuess says that Tyler \x{201c}made it entirely clear that he intended to seize full authority,\x{201d} Claude M. Fuess, Daniel Wehster, 2 vols. (Little, Brown, 1930), vol. I, 95. Similarly, of the ambitious Tyler, Morgan argues, \x{201c}Tyler\x{2019}s whole course of action after he arrived in the capital demonstrated [his] serious deliberation to establish himself as President in his own right and not as a mere caretaker for the departed Harrison,\x{201d} Robert J. Morgan, A Whig Embattled: The Presidency Under John Tyler (Lincoln, 1954), 9. special presidential election should be called for: Chidsey points out, however, \x{201c}Could a man in truth be President who had never been elected President? This was the question that perplexed even the most expert hairsplitters in Washington,\x{201d} And Tyler Too, 50. administered not by Chief Justice Taney: One unsatisfactory reason could be that Taney was a resident of Baltimore, while Cranch lived in Washington.

            "Andrew Johnson: Historians have long been puzzled about how exactly to assess Johnson, and exactly what made \x{201c}him tick\x{201d} (Brooks Simpsons phrase). Biographies and in-depth studies have appeared in waves, coinciding with sharply divergent assessments of Reconstruction over the years. Books written in the 1920s and 1930s lauded him for his conciliatory stances toward a prostrate South, while accounts <<after 1960|18:0>> excoriated him for incompetence and wrongheaded obstinacy. Moralizing, of either stripe, aside, the question of understanding Johnson remains. For further readings, which I have consulted, used, or perused, see Paul H. Bergeron, ed., The Papers of Andrew Johnson, vol. 8: May\x{2014}August 1865 (University of Tennessee Press, 1989), which helps us understand the context in which he operated, crucial because the new president was immediately bombarded with advice and suggestions from across the entire political spectrum; David Bowen\x{2019}s perceptive Andrew Johnson and the Negro (University of Tennessee Press, 1989), which nicely explores Johnsons racial attitudes and his political and social philosophy; Albert Castel\x{2019}s The Presidency of Andrew Johnson (University Press of Kansas, 1979), a solid evaluation of Johnsons effectiveness as a politician and a policy maker, which lays out the pitfalls created by his stubbornness; James E. Sefton, Andrew Johnson and the Uses of Constitutional Power (Little, Brown, 1990), a short but lively biography that offers the reader the challenge of \x{201c}coping with Johnson on his terms\x{201d}; Hans Trefousse\x{2019}s biography, Andrew Johnson: A Biography (Norton, 1989), which clarifies a number of details about Johnsons life, written by a professional historian. It also is fairly balanced (the author does not like Johnson, but has begrudging admiration for him), albeit short on the actual inner life of Johnson himself Also see Brooks D. Simpsons review essay \x{201c}Reconstructing Andrew Johnson,\x{201d} Congress and the Presidency 7, no. 2 (Autumn 1990): 167\x{2013}73, and Michael Perman, \x{201c}Solving the Riddle of Andrew Johnson,\x{201d} Journal of East Tennessee History 62 (1990): 105\x{2013}14. For an example of a particularly harsh critique of Johnson, see Eric McKitrick, Andrew Johnson: A Profile (Hill and Wang, 1969). Also used for this section on Johnson, from which quotes are further taken, see Foote, 986\x{2013}89; Dorm\x{e1}n, Second Man, 66\x{2013}87; Gene Smith, High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Impeachment and Trial of Andrew Johnson (Morrow, 1976), esp. 7\x{2013}126; also Donald, Sumner and the Rights of Man, 218\x{2013}30, and James McPherson, Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction (Knopf 1982), 495\x{2013}96. taught him how to read and write: Trefousse presents convincing evidence that it was not his wife but probably the foreman at Selby\x{2019}s tailor shop in Raleigh who taught him literacy. Lincoln\x{2019}s second inaugural: See, for instance, Foote, 810\x{2013}12; Smith, High Crimes, 60\x{2013}65. Johnson be forced to resign \x{201c}so dishonored\x{201d}: Donald, Sumner and the Rights of Man, 218. no greater testimony to Johnsons diminished stature \x{2026} dutifully complied: The reader may note here that the succession process was still so relatively new that that it didn\x{2019}t occur to anyone, including Johnson, that the \x{201c}acting presidency\x{201d} or the \x{201c}presidency itself\x{201d} should have already devolved upon Johnson. Instead, he waited to take the oath of office. By comparison, John lyler, with no precedent to back him up, did not think the oath of office was even needed.",

            "Of all the men who would choose to Forrest couldn\x{2019}t have known it then, but in fact Johnston did want to surrender: For Forrest biographical sketch and role of Forrest, I have relied heavily upon the following sources, from which all quotes are taken unless otherwise noted: On Forrest, see two recent biographies, each written in a lively, readable style, Jack Hurst, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and Brian Steel Wills, A Battle from the Start: The Life of Nathan Bedford Forrest (HarperCollins, 1992), both of which offer full coverage of Forrest\x{2019}s prewar and postwar life, but are sometimes short of description of his wartime activities; John A. Wyeth, Life of General Nathan Bedford Forrest (Harper and Bros., 1899), one of the better turn-of-the-century studies; Andrew N. Lyde, Bedford Forrest and His Critter Company (J. S. Sanders, 1992), esp. 355\x{2013}77 for final months of war, but which suffers in some respects from lack of scholarship; for a more outdated work, see Thomas Jordan and J. P. Pryor, The Campaigns of Lieut.~Gen. N B. Forrest (1868, Da Capo reprint 1996) (marred, however, by unfortunate errors); also Robert Selph Henry, \x{201c}First with the Most\x{201d} Forrest (Bobbs-Merrill, 1944), which for many is still the best text. It is extremely useful and provides a great chronological narrative of Forrest\x{2019}s battles, and in many ways the best accounts of his campaigns. At times, however, it is short on critical analysis of Forrest himself; also R. S. Henry, ed., As They Saw Forrest: Some Recollections and Comments of Contemporaries (McCowat Mercet, 1956), perhaps overwrought in some areas, but still very useful; also outstanding and extremely helpful to me was a three-part condensed biography of the life of Nathan Bedford Forrest by Mark Grimsley in Civil War Times Illustrated, \x{201c}Millionaire Rebel Raider, Part I\x{201d} (September/October 1993), 59\x{2013}73; \x{201c}The Great Deceiver, Part II\x{201d} (November/December 1993), 33\x{2013}96; and \x{201c}Leader of the Klan,\x{201d} Part III (January/February 1994), 35\x{2013}73; I am heavily indebted to this concise sketch for helping make sense of this complex man, and have drawn upon it extensively. See further, sketch of Forrest in Ward, Civil War, 346, and comments by Foote, 245\x{2013}46, and discussion in BC, esp. 513\x{2013}15, 723, 807\x{2013}8. none was more suited; Emory Thomas, CN, points out that during the Confederacy\x{2019}s darkest hours in these waning months, Forrest won some of his \x{201c}greatest victories,\x{201d} 288. But nothing quite so succeeds in American life, North or South, as success: I am indebted to the author Tom Wolfe for this insight. Wolfe points out that in the South, much of the old money was in fact new money, and that the nouveaux riches were always prevalent while affecting the status of old South, pin down an invading army of 40,000: See BC, on this point, 514. logistics have always been half the battle: Jay Winik briefing to Defense Secretary Les Aspm, 1992. \x{201c}I get there firstest with the mostest\x{201d}: Did Forrest ever actually say this? Or is it folklore? Most likely, he said something like it, although in Henry\x{2019}s terms, not so self-consciously a piece of literary description. The phrase, in whatever form it occurred, originated from a discussion between Forrest and John Hunt Morgan while the two were comparing notes at Murfreesboro, Tennessee, after operations in Kentucky and middle Tennessee. Forrest explained his success this way: \x{201c}I just got there first with the most men.\x{201d} (Actually, he probably pronounced this \x{201c}git tar fuss\x{201d}). But in truth, while he often got there first, rarely did he have the most men. See Henry, \x{201c}First with the Most\x{201d} Forrest, <<18\x{2013}20|5a:1>>; later in the war, he met with Union representatives Colonel John G. Parkenhurst and Captain Lewis Hosea on February 23\x{2013}24. Here again he spoke of his unorthodox philosophy of war, and reiterated his maxim of getting there first. He also said he preferred \x{201c}pistols to sidearms.\x{201d} In this same meeting, he spoke openly, without recrimination, of the rebel effort in Mississippi to enroll Negroes in the army, suggesting he was a convert to this view, see, for example, Hurst, Nathan Bedford Forrest, 246\x{2013}47. Fort Pillow: The truth of the killing of several dozen black prisoners and some whites\x{2014}including Major William Bradford, the commander, who was captured and subsequently killed, is now generally accepted. For more on Fort Pillow, see Ronald K. Hugh, \x{201c}Fort Pillow Massacre: Aftermath of Paducah,\x{201d} Illinois State Historical Society Journal 66 (1973): 62\x{2013}70, and George Bodnia, ed., \x{201c}Fort Pillow \x{2018}Massacre,\x{2019} Observations of a Minnesotan,\x{201d} Minnesota History 4 (1973): 186\x{2013}90; Albert Castel, \x{201c}The Fort Pillow Massacre: A Fresh Examination of the Evidence,\x{201d} CWH 4, no. 1 (March 1958): 48; and John Cimprich and Robert Mainfort Jr., \x{201c}Fort Pillow Revisited: New Evidence About an Old Controversy\x{201d} CWH 28 (1982): 293\x{2013}306. It could be added that General Bill Sherman, who faced accusations of brutality as well, after examining the evidence, was satisfied that Forrest had done what he could to halt excesses, and that the slaughter of \x{201c}negro troops\x{201d} was not, \x{201c}properly speaking, a \x{2018}massacre\x{2019} so much as the rather unnecessary killing of blacks due to their panic,\x{201d} see Lewis, Sherman, 370. Qualifying a wholesale acceptance of Sherman\x{2019}s assessments are his own questionable racial biases and the accusations he had to face, significant morale booster for the South: See Gallagher, Confederate War, 36\x{2013}37. \x{201c}blood can not restore blood\x{201d}: See BC, 794. \x{201c}niggers\x{201d} and \x{201c}Tories\x{201d} alike, had it corning: See Albert Castel\x{2019}s introduction on this point in Jordan and Pryor, Campaigns of Lieut.~Gen. N B. Forrest, esp. viii. He asserts that Forrest \x{201c}was no more to blame for what happened than Lee was for the similar mass killing of black troops in the Battle of the Crater in Virginia on July 30, 1864.\x{201d} By contrast, Grimsley notes that what occurred was clearly an \x{201c}atrocity,\x{201d} but that Forrest\x{2019}s role is \x{201c}controversial\x{201d} and that it is one thing to say Forrest did not order the killings\x{2014}evidence suggests he didn\x{2019}t\x{2014}and another to \x{201c}absolve him of responsibility,\x{201d} Grimsley, \x{201c}Great Deceiver,\x{201d} 38; that both blacks and whites were killed does dampen the notion that it was wholly racially motivated. James Webb, much-decorated Vietnam War hero, former navy secretary, and best-selling novelist, tells me that it is his view that Forrest and his men did not do anything in the heat of the battle that other armies throughout history haven\x{2019}t done, and warns of the peril of applying contemporary standards to Forrest at Fort Pillow. In short, from his experience, he would subscribe to the insanitas belli thesis. That Lincoln was less bothered by this issue than many others may lend some credence to this view. \x{201c}War \x{2026} means killing\x{201d}: See Hurst, Nathan Bedford Forrest, 263. the most humiliating Union defeat: McPherson, for example, makes this point, BC, 748. James W Wilson: See, for example, Foote, 847\x{2013}50, 904\x{2013}5. Wilsons aides: This famous meeting, of course, was with Colonel John G. Parkenhurst and Captain Lewis Hosea on February 23\x{2013}24, 1865. sieges of Fort Blakely and Spanish Fort For more on these two battles, which don\x{2019}t receive nearly enough attention, see Trudeau, Out of the Storm, 153\x{2013}87. \x{201c}point of the saber instead of the edge\x{201d}: In fact, this was no mere bluster.

Indeed, Forrest himself wanted to rid the land of such lawless guerrillas, as he told Wilson\x{2019}s aides, Parkenhurst and Hosea, in February 1865 (see Hurst, Nathan Bedford Forrest, <<2.47|5a:0>>).

Critics and ethicists: See, for example, Michael Walzer, Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations (Basic Books, 1977). \x{201c}War is cruelty\x{201d}: There is considerable debate about whether Sherman actually waged total war, and if so, to what degree. Michael Walzer, a leading political scientist and ethi-cist, resoundingly says he did wage total war, and an unjustified one at that\x{2014}one that cruelly broke down the barriers between combatants and noncombatants. In Walzer\x{2019}s words, Sherman is on the \x{201c}extreme form\x{201d} of \x{201c}a one-sided and partial way of thinking,\x{201d} and what Walzer calls \x{201c}the sliding scale argument\x{201d} in which \x{201c}no limits [are] left except force itself.\x{201d} This, in Walzer\x{2019}s view, is unacceptable, see Just and Unjust Wars, 32\x{2013}33, 37, 230; James Reston Jr., Sherman\x{2019}s March and Vietnam (Macmillan, 1984), further portrays Sherman as the progenitor of modern \x{201c}total war,\x{201d} which reached its conclusion in World War II. See also Bruce Russett and Harvey Starr, \x{201c}Ethics and War,\x{201d} World Politics (Freeman, 1996), 316\x{2013}22; Malham M. Wakin, War, Morality, and the Military Profession (Westview, 1986), esp. 284\x{2013}16, 341\x{2013}65; Paul Ramsey, The Just War (Scribner\x{2019}s, 1968); by contrast, see Mark Neely Jr., \x{201c}Was the Civil War a Total War?,\x{201d} CWH 37 (1991): <<14\x{2013}15|5a:0>>, 27, who maintains that true total war is \x{201c}without scruples or limitations\x{201d} and that it must \x{201c}break down the distinction between soldiers and civilians, combatants and noncombatants,\x{201d} which sounds like Walzer. Neely, however, doe not feel that this happened, see <<14\x{2013}16|5a:0>>, 27. Mark Grimsley, in The Hard Hand of War: Union Military Policy Toward Southern Civilians, 1861\x{2014}1865 (Cambridge University Press, 1995), largely agrees. Where Walzer sees the perils of the \x{201c}sliding scale\x{201d} of the \x{201c}war is hell doctrine,\x{201d} Grimsley maintains that the actions of Sherman were \x{201c}seldom the wanton wholesale fury of legend,\x{201d} but instead, a \x{201c}balance between severity and restraint,\x{201d} and were \x{201c}roughly proportional to legitimate needs.\x{201d} He labels Sherman\x{2019}s efforts \x{201c}hard war,\x{201d} characterized by \x{201c}direct severity.\x{201d} James McPherson comes down in their support, adding that compared with ethnic cleansing by Serbian armies in Bosnia or Allied bombing in WWII, Sherman\x{2019}s soldiers were a \x{201c}model of decorum,\x{201d} see review essay \x{201c}G\x{f6}tterd\x{e4}mmerung,\x{201d} New York Review of Books, December 21, 1995, <<10\x{2013}16|5a:0>>. Michael Fellman, often a critic of Sherman, also says that the army \x{201c}placed limits on itself,\x{201d} Citizen Sherman, 225. However, that Sherman did wage at least something approaching total war in South Carolina, all agree. Does that then absolve Sherman of the change? That he was perhaps less severe than, say, the British in Ireland or Philip II of Spain against the Dutch does not completely vitiate the severity of his total war policies against part of the South. Also, some of the comparisons may not tell the full story. It is quite clear that in the American context, and as practiced by American soldiers, Sherman introduced a whole new brand of warfare. This is not a judgment, merely a historical observation. One may further take note that Robert E. Lee rejected precisely this sort of warfare\x{2014}and the Confederacy surely paid a price for it. For broader historical perspective on the growth of war and changing norms of conflict, see Michael Howard, War in European History (Oxford University Press, 1976), esp. 1\x{2013}115; and Liddell Hart, Strategy, 1\x{2013}147.

            "While many scholars think not: For example, Wiley speaks of Davis\x{2019}s lack of administrative capacity, his inability to get along with people, his aloofness, and the fact that he was out of his depth as president; David Potter dissects him thoroughly, among other things, criticizing him for his conservative mind; Allan Nevins, in his study of statesmanship of the Civil War, accuses Davis of a lack of passion and inability to rouse his people as did a Lincoln or a Churchill. Some thought him a dictator: Of his many flaws, this was not one. Davis resisted all attempts to wantonly accrue dictatorial power; what he did do was embrace the centralized states with greater frequency as the war continued, which, of course, ran counter to states\x{2019} rights theorists. Even Wiley acknowledges that \x{201c}far from being a despot, [Davis] exercised notable restraint,\x{201d} Road to Appomattox, 112; Lincoln was also accused of being a dictator\x{2014}often\x{2014}also not true, Donald, 564. Such were the passions of war. he generally embraced a strategy: On this rich subject, see BC, 337\x{2013}38; Weigley, American Way of War, esp. <<3\x{2013}17|5a:0>>; Williams, \x{201c}Military Leadership of North and South\x{201d}; and Potter, \x{201c}Jefferson Davis and the Political Factors in Confederate Defeat,\x{201d} esp. 45\x{2013}46, 108\x{2013}10. each state at first raised its own forces: As did the Union, it could be added, that nearly ruined George Washington: At one point, a deeply frustrated Washington asked Congress to increase the number of allowable lashes from \x{201c}the biblical 39 to 500,\x{201d} see Leckie, Wars of America, 139\x{2013}46, esp. 123; for insights into Washington and comparisons to Lee, I am also indebted to Bob Parker; also Jared Sparks, The Life of George Washington (Little, Brown, 1839), 156\x{2013}96. Yet for all his considerable weaknesses: See McPherson on this point, \x{201c}American Victory, American Defeat,\x{201d} 38\x{2013}40. Had he lost the 1864 reelection, or had the outcome of the war been different, Lincoln would have gone down in history as an also-ran and a loser, Davis as a great leader of a war for independence, fanatical\x{2026} all these men shared common traits: For more on just two of these examples, see Tim Joyner, Magellan (International Marine, 1992), and J. Atkinson, Martin Luther and the Birth of Protestantism (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1968). learned about Lincoln\x{2019}s assassination: Davis himself knew of Confederate plans to kidnap Lincoln and was perfectly willing to consider the idea, largely because he believed there had been several Northern-inspired plots against his own life. See Donald, 677, footnote for 549 (retaliation \x{2026} ). He declined all plans because he believed they would lead to Lincoln\x{2019}s death, not his capture (because, as he said, it \x{201c}Would probably involve the killing, instead of bringing away the captive alive\x{201d}). Also, the South\x{2014}and Davis\x{2014}believed that there had been a plot to kill both him and his cabinet, when in 1864 they found documents on Union Colonel Ulric Dahlgren, who was killed in a failed mission to liberate prisoners in Richmond. The papers spoke ominously of killing Davis and the Confederate cabinet, as well as burning Richmond. The Union denied that the papers were accurate, but as Ernest Furgurson concludes, \x{201c}though debates over the paper\x{2019}s validity would run on \x{2026} the weight of the evidence suggests that they were indeed genuine.\x{201d} See his compact account in Ashes of Glory, 249\x{2013}55; also Donald, 549. Davis was captured: He was released from Fort Monroe in 1867, without standing trial; see Foote for account of his captivity, 1034\x{2013}39. \x{201c}virtually at an end: However, the war was not formally declared over by President Johnson until August 20, 1866, see, for example, Trudeau, Out of the Storm, 396\x{2013}97.",
