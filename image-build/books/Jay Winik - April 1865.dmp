He was sick, dispirited, and even his hands were routinely cold and clammy. And today, the weather itself seemed to be colluding with his foul and melancholy mood. That morning, heavy clouds moved over Washington, as they had the day before and the day before that, whipping the capital with blasts of rain and wind.

            "By <<1859|9n:0>>, with its population of almost 40,000, Richmond was not the largest city in the South. Slightly smaller than Charleston, it had less than a quarter of New Orleans\x{2019}s population and even ranked behind Louisville, Kentucky. But it was surely unique. Unlike the Deep South, it was distinctly more diverse: with its commitment to public education, it had six public schools as well as a college for women; with its commitment to religious pluralism, it had thirty-three Protestant churches that were complemented by three Jewish synagogues, three Roman Catholic churches, a Quaker meeting house, and a Universalist church. With its four newspapers jockeying for attention, its political voice was often broad and remarkably lively. Not surprisingly, as the war came, few doubted that the city was anything but an impressive blend of rural provincialism and urban potential; its atmosphere of high breeding and noblesse oblige made it distinctly Southern, but its diverse economy, heterogeneous population, and moderate outlook gave it a lusty, cosmopolitan air that solidly fastened it in the mold of the larger United States\x{2014}unusual in the antebellum South. And, in a young country still very much struggling with its national identity, Richmond and Richmond alone among the great cities could bask in the golden age of Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison, making it a trenchant portrait of the young American republic.",

The Confederates were almost entirely surrounded, outnumbered <<nearly six to one|10>>, with little food, little hope of resupply, little prospect for immediate reinforcement. But there was still the distinct prospect of escape, especially if those fires were of cavalry, not infantrymen. And before the opportunity slipped away, Lee hoped to turn the momentary lull to his advantage. Six straight days of Lee\x{2019}s relentless march westward had not dimmed his audacity, his remaining men\x{2019}s courage, or his desire to avoid surrender and somehow salvage victory. He devised another plan for breaking through the enemy lines: his men would attack as soon as possible, attempting to slice a hole through Grant\x{2019}s slumbering army, and if successful, they would resume the march southward. General John Gordon, one of Lee\x{2019}s most daring officers, was chosen to lead the breakout.

            "By way of a profession, Lincoln was a self-taught lawyer and a successful one at that, earning up to \$5,000 a year by the 1850s, but law per se never held much appeal for him. Politics did. Not the Jacksonian Democrats of his father, which he rejected, but the new roads, central banking, and protective tariffs of the National Republicans and Whigs. From the start, Lincoln saw his role as a champion of the budding middle class. \x{201c}Republicans,\x{201d} he memorably put it, \x{201c}are for both the man and the dollar.\x{201d} He gave his first stump speech at nineteen, and the pleasant taste stayed with him long after that, \x{201c}Politics were his life, newspapers his food, and his great ambition his motive power,\x{201d} his law partner Herndon wrote. At <<twenty-three|9:0>>, only seven months after coming to the little Illinois community of New Salem, Lincoln was already running for office. He lost. But contrary to the way he liked to tell it, success soon came to him; two years later, in 1834, Sangamon County sent him to the lower Illinois house. From this time on to the end of his life\x{2014}except for the years between 1849 and 1854, when his political prospects were at their lowest ebb\x{2014}he was either campaigning, serving in office, or out on the stump for other office seekers.",

What could have been more incongruous? This was, after all, just five days after the giddy glow of Appomattox. But as a long wooden coffin was quietly edged down the narrow lodging house steps on Tenth Street, through the mud and onto the roads, carrying Abraham Lincoln\x{2019}s body back to the White House, flags drooped to half-mast everywhere and the muffled ringing of bells could be heard against the rain. Now it was the voices of revenge that could be heard loudest. Citizens poured into the streets, in the downpour, and soon they were nothing more than muttering mobs, a hostile throng angrily congregating from K Street to Lafayette Square: they shook their fists at Ford\x{2019}s Theater, shouting \x{201c}Burn the theater!\x{201d}; a cascade of ugly roars and boos spontaneously swelled up, fell, then continued even more loudly; any mention of Confederates brought an equally vociferous reprise: \x{201c}Shoot them!\x{201d} \x{201c}Hang them!\x{201d} \x{201c}Hang them again!\x{201d} \x{201c}Kill the god damn rebels!\x{201d} Talk of streets running red with Confederate blood was everywhere. And with the iron hand of martial law imposed upon the Union capital, the city remained edged with fear. In every direction, a phalanx of armed guards sought to keep order, manning stations on all roads to and from the city. Government departments and business houses were abruptly closed; the city was immediately cordoned off; routine market wagons, milk carts, and mail riders were turned around and sent back beyond the outskirts; theaters and music halls hastily canceled their engagements; and concerts and social functions were postponed indefinitely. But if the streets threatened to turn crimson with vengeance, they were just as quickly tinged with the real color of sorrow. Black was ubiquitous. So, too, were the telltale sounds of mourning. The White House columns were draped in black, and somber black folds were looped along all the Federal buildings. The melancholy sound of organs rippled across town, and altar candles were lit. Soldiers fastened shreds of darkened crepe and cut rib bon on their sleeves. Even the poor pinned scraps of black cloth in their windows and on their modest doorposts.",

It was one thing to profit from slavery or to own slaves; it was quite another for a well born gentleman to buy and sell slaves for a living.

Whatever his legacy, one has to consider the incident at Fort Pillow, which has been debated by contemporary observers and historians ever since it happened on that fateful day of April 12, 1864. The basic facts are well known. As part of a series of ten separate engagements over several weeks, Forrest came across the Union garrison of Fort Pillow on the Mississippi River. This garrison had little special strategic meaning, although capturing it would be a significant morale booster for the South. But it mattered for other reasons: it was manned by locally recruited Unionists whom Forrest derided as \x{201c}Tennessee Tories\x{201d} and some 270 blacks, mostly escaped slaves, whom Forrest labeled a \x{201c}damned nigger regiment.\x{201d} Forrest issued his customary demand for surrender, adding, if not, \x{201c}I cannot be responsible for the fate of your command.\x{201d} Not only did the fort commander refuse, but the cocky Federals openly taunted Forrest, daring him to try to take the garrison. It was the mistake of their lives. The assault came quickly, and within hours, Fort Pillow had devolved into little more than a lurid slaughter pen: many of the blacks, estimated at <<100|3:1>>\x{2014}and a number of whites as well\x{2014}were not allowed to surrender and were butchered in cold blood instead, even as they fell to their knees and with uplifted hands screamed for mercy.

As was often the case, Forrest was outnumbered, this time <<almost two to one|10>>, but he was un-fazed.

Actually, there were other rare sights. For instance, a Virginia Military Institute cadet on picket duty at the Richmond front was amazed to be relieved by black soldiers who \x{201c}politely intimated with the character of their orders, and took their position \x{2026} with all the precision and alacrity of old soldiers,\x{201d} see Jordan, Black Confederates and Afro Yankees in Civil War Virginia, 246. \x{201c}with themselves.\x{201d} Richmond Examiner, March 15, 18, 20, 1865, also Durden, Gray and the Black, 274.-75 and Thomas, Confederate State of Richmond, 189\x{2013}90. beloved Army of Northern Virginia: On blacks in Army of Northern Virginia during Lee\x{2019}s retreat, see important work by Trudeau, Like Men of War, 409\x{2013}14; also see Calkins, Appomattox Campaign, 183\x{2013}84. For instance, a Union chaplain observed, \x{201c}a squad [of] many negroes recently armed by Jeff.

Of their service, Major Henry Scott reported proudly, \x{201c}I have the great pleasure in stating that my men acted with the utmost promptness and good will\x{2026} Allow me to state Sir that they [the portion of his black company] behaved in an extraordinary acceptable manner,\x{201d} Jordan, Black Confederates and Afro Yankees in Civil War Virginia, 246.

Considering the chaos, and some glaring inaccuracies due to lack of adequate sources, some of the early reporting of Lincoln\x{2019}s death and the aftermath was quite accurate. Also see Leech, 395\x{2013}400; Bak, Day Lincoln Was Shot, no; Thomas Reed Turner, Beware the People Weeping: Public Opinion and the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln (LSU Press, 1982), 25\x{2013}52; Lewis, Assassination of Lincoln, 48\x{2013}49, 56, 58\x{2013}59; from which quotes are taken, unless otherwise noted. Talk of streets running red: Across the Union, those who professed the slightest sympathy for the killing of Lincoln put their life in danger\x{2014}literally. Thirty-five-year-old Joseph Shaw, the editor of the Westminster (Maryland) Democrat, was killed in Zachariah\x{2019}s Hotel while defending himself from a hostile mob, who physically broke into his hotel room. They brutally fell upon him and killed him because of \x{201c}disrespectful language\x{201d} about Lincoln \x{bf}n his paper, Turner, Beware the People Weeping, 50\x{2013}51; his press was also destroyed by mob action. In another instance, at the Mission Church in the First Ward, a preacher made some insulting comments about Lincoln in the course of a Sunday sermon; he was dragged from the pulpit, assaulted, then arrested, Leech, 369. Instances like this, of assault, mob rule, or murder, were commonplace in the days that followed. On this also see Glenn, 206\x{2013}9. Wrote the New York Times: Quotes are from April 17, 1865. for under an hour: Remarkably, outside of speculation, it is not known what the two men even talked about. Edwin Stanton \x{2026}, tendered his resignation: Oates describes him \x{201c}as looking exhausted and utterly worn down from illness\x{201d} and strain. He stayed on only because Lincoln prevailed upon him to remain. \x{201c}Reluctantly,\x{201d} Stanton said, he would (Oates\x{2019}s words), \x{201c}stay with Lincoln a little longer,\x{201d} 423. By any measure, Stanton would become one of the most controversial characters of this time period, and then again of the Johnson administration.

I am much indebted to these studies.

Silva, Presidential Succession, 1\x{2013}13, and Wilhelm, \x{201c}Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,\x{201d} 36\x{2013}51; also Michael Dorman, The Second Man: The Changing Role of the Vice Presidency (Delacorte, 1968), 45\x{2013}46. they did not intend for the vice president to become president: Wilhelm agrees with this. He also notes that the delegates at the convention did not consider the matter \x{201c}a major topic.\x{201d} And further, that historical documents still \x{201c}leave the question of why the office was even created a mystery,\x{201d} \x{201c}Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,\x{201d} 214; Jefferson ally William Rives referred to the whole matter of succession as a \x{201c}remote and shadowy inheritance,\x{201d} Silva, Presidential Succession, 114\x{2013}15.

Indeed, for the better part of a half century: On March 1, 1792, Congress did pass a presidential succession law, which provided that a vice president can resign or refuse election in one way only, with a written refusal signed and dated and delivered to the secretary of state, Wilhelm, \x{201c}Origins of the Office of the Vice Presidency,\x{201d} 213. The law also provided that the president pro tempore of the Senate or speaker of the house would be in line to act as president, until presidential electors were chosen or elected and a special election held. One may ask, why was the secretary of state not put in line? The reason was politics, having to do with Alexander Hamilton\x{2019}s hatred of Thomas Jefferson. On this point, the choleric Fisher Ames, Federalist leader in Massachusetts, gleefully reported to Thomas Dwight: \x{201c}The Secretary of State is struck out of the bill for the future presidency, in case of the first two offices becoming vacant. His friends think it important to hold him up as King of the Romans. The firmness of the Senate kept him out,\x{201d} See Silva, Presidential Succession, 113\x{2013}14; for a larger discussion of congressional actions on this matter, occurring in 1792, 1820\x{2013}21, and 1842, see Silva, Presidential Succession, 112\x{2013}16, 166\x{2013}68. Interestingly, when President Johnson was later impeached, many in Congress asserted that he was still \x{201c}vice president,\x{201d} and for the time, only \x{201c}acting president.\x{201d} Others noted simply that he was serving out \x{201c}Lincoln\x{2019}s term.\x{201d} Indeed, the three original impeachment resolutions introduced by Benjamin F. Loan and John Kelso spoke of \x{201c}the officer now exercising the function pertaining to the office of President of the United States\x{201d}; James Ashley\x{2019}s resolution referred to \x{201c}Andrew Johnson, Vice President and acting President of the United States\x{201d}; and another resolution put it this way: \x{201c}Vice President of the United States, discharging the powers and duties of the office of the President.\x{201d} The Final Judiciary Committee resolutions that impeached him, however, did so as the \x{201c}president.\x{201d} See Silva, Presidential Succession, note on 26 and 27. But even the Founders were not omniscient to So by the time Lincoln lay dying: Silva, Presidential Succession, 14\x{2013}31, and conclusions, esp. 166\x{2013}69; Stathis, \x{201c}John Tyler\x{2019}s Presidential Succession\x{201d}; also Chidsey, And Tyler Too, esp. 41\x{2013}53; and Dorm\x{e1}n, Second Man, esp. 45\x{2013}55. hours away in Williamsburg: Some 230 miles and at least twenty-one hours, to be exact. This in itself was a telling fact about the lack of importance of the vice presidency. Washington was alive with fierce speculation: Chidsey writes that the capital was in a \x{201c}state of pitiful bewilderment\x{201d} over the succession issue. \x{201c}Learned statesman everywhere were asking themselves the question\x{201d} of succession, which had been left \x{201c}in the air.\x{201d} the cabinet would run the show: As Chidsey puts it: \x{201c}That this amiable Virginian might become \x{2026} the full time, undisputed president, Webster did not for a moment believe\x{201d}; moreover, the secretaries assembled \x{201c}were to rule the nation in Tyler\x{2019}s name,\x{201d} And Tyler Too, 44\x{2013}45. Before relatively newer scholarship, Tyler\x{2019}s succession had been blandly portrayed by some as almost devoid of political intrigue. See Oliver Chitwood, John Tyler: Champion of the Old South (D. Appleton, 1939), 202\x{2013}6; Leonard Dinnerstein, \x{201c}The Accession of John Tyler to the Presidency,\x{201d} Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 70 (October 1952): 447\x{2013}58; Robert Seager, And Tyler Too (Easton Press, 1963). Tyler had won the showdown: Claude Fuess says that Tyler \x{201c}made it entirely clear that he intended to seize full authority,\x{201d} Claude M. Fuess, Daniel Wehster, 2 vols. (Little, Brown, 1930), vol. I, 95. Similarly, of the ambitious Tyler, Morgan argues, \x{201c}Tyler\x{2019}s whole course of action after he arrived in the capital demonstrated [his] serious deliberation to establish himself as President in his own right and not as a mere caretaker for the departed Harrison,\x{201d} Robert J. Morgan, A Whig Embattled: The Presidency Under John Tyler (Lincoln, 1954), 9. special presidential election should be called for: Chidsey points out, however, \x{201c}Could a man in truth be President who had never been elected President? This was the question that perplexed even the most expert hairsplitters in Washington,\x{201d} And Tyler Too, 50. administered not by Chief Justice Taney: One unsatisfactory reason could be that Taney was a resident of Baltimore, while Cranch lived in Washington. But this still does not explain his essential refusal to administer the oath to Tyler. See Bernard Steiner, Life of Brooke Taney: Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court (Williams &Wilkins, 1922), 257\x{2013}58.",

            "Andrew Johnson: Historians have long been puzzled about how exactly to assess Johnson, and exactly what made \x{201c}him tick\x{201d} (Brooks Simpsons phrase). Biographies and in-depth studies have appeared in waves, coinciding with sharply divergent assessments of Reconstruction over the years. Books written in the 1920s and 1930s lauded him for his conciliatory stances toward a prostrate South, while accounts <<after 1960|18:0>> excoriated him for incompetence and wrongheaded obstinacy. Moralizing, of either stripe, aside, the question of understanding Johnson remains. For further readings, which I have consulted, used, or perused, see Paul H. Bergeron, ed., The Papers of Andrew Johnson, vol. 8: May\x{2014}August 1865 (University of Tennessee Press, 1989), which helps us understand the context in which he operated, crucial because the new president was immediately bombarded with advice and suggestions from across the entire political spectrum; David Bowen\x{2019}s perceptive Andrew Johnson and the Negro (University of Tennessee Press, 1989), which nicely explores Johnsons racial attitudes and his political and social philosophy; Albert Castel\x{2019}s The Presidency of Andrew Johnson (University Press of Kansas, 1979), a solid evaluation of Johnsons effectiveness as a politician and a policy maker, which lays out the pitfalls created by his stubbornness; James E. Sefton, Andrew Johnson and the Uses of Constitutional Power (Little, Brown, 1990), a short but lively biography that offers the reader the challenge of \x{201c}coping with Johnson on his terms\x{201d}; Hans Trefousse\x{2019}s biography, Andrew Johnson: A Biography (Norton, 1989), which clarifies a number of details about Johnsons life, written by a professional historian. It also is fairly balanced (the author does not like Johnson, but has begrudging admiration for him), albeit short on the actual inner life of Johnson himself Also see Brooks D. Simpsons review essay \x{201c}Reconstructing Andrew Johnson,\x{201d} Congress and the Presidency 7, no. 2 (Autumn 1990): 167\x{2013}73, and Michael Perman, \x{201c}Solving the Riddle of Andrew Johnson,\x{201d} Journal of East Tennessee History 62 (1990): 105\x{2013}14. For an example of a particularly harsh critique of Johnson, see Eric McKitrick, Andrew Johnson: A Profile (Hill and Wang, 1969). Also used for this section on Johnson, from which quotes are further taken, see Foote, 986\x{2013}89; Dorm\x{e1}n, Second Man, 66\x{2013}87; Gene Smith, High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Impeachment and Trial of Andrew Johnson (Morrow, 1976), esp. 7\x{2013}126; also Donald, Sumner and the Rights of Man, 218\x{2013}30, and James McPherson, Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction (Knopf 1982), 495\x{2013}96. taught him how to read and write: Trefousse presents convincing evidence that it was not his wife but probably the foreman at Selby\x{2019}s tailor shop in Raleigh who taught him literacy. Lincoln\x{2019}s second inaugural: See, for instance, Foote, 810\x{2013}12; Smith, High Crimes, 60\x{2013}65. Johnson be forced to resign \x{201c}so dishonored\x{201d}: Donald, Sumner and the Rights of Man, 218. no greater testimony to Johnsons diminished stature \x{2026} dutifully complied: The reader may note here that the succession process was still so relatively new that that it didn\x{2019}t occur to anyone, including Johnson, that the \x{201c}acting presidency\x{201d} or the \x{201c}presidency itself\x{201d} should have already devolved upon Johnson. Instead, he waited to take the oath of office. By comparison, John lyler, with no precedent to back him up, did not think the oath of office was even needed.",

Confederacy was an isolated wasteland: BC, 818. As to guerrilla warfare: It is important to note that Forrest did not see himself as a \x{201c}guerrilla\x{201d} or \x{201c}partisan\x{201d} as the term was used, which usually meant those like William Quantrill in Missouri. Indeed, Forrest himself wanted to rid the land of such lawless guerrillas, as he told Wilson\x{2019}s aides, Parkenhurst and Hosea, in February 1865 (see Hurst, Nathan Bedford Forrest, <<2.47|5a:0>>). But as a cavalryman taking to the hills, under direction from Davis or Lee, that would surely be a different matter. \x{201c}Resist the sensational rumors\x{201d}: See Forrest letter from the field in OR, series 1, vol. 49, 1263\x{2013}64; at this point, Forrest resisted all notion of a final surrender.
