            "Einstein began his relativity paper with the claim that there was an asymmetry in the then-current interpretation of electrodynamics, an asymmetry not present in the phenomena of nature. Almost all physicists <<around 1905|18:0>> accepted the idea that light waves\x{2014}like water waves or sound waves\x{2014}must be waves in something. In the case of light waves (or the oscillating electric and magnetic fields that constituted light), that something was the all-pervasive ether. Most late-nineteenth-century physicists considered the ether to be one of the great ideas of their era, and they hoped that once properly understood, intuited, and mathematized, the ether would lead science to a unified picture of phenomena from heat and light to magnetism and electricity. Yet it was the ether that gave rise to the asymmetry that Einstein rejected.2",

            "Einstein believed that physicists would only find consistency by sorting out the measurements of space and time. To make spatial measurements, a coordinate system is needed\x{2014}by Einstein\x{2019}s lights, a system of ordinary rigid measuring rods. For example: this point is two feet along the x-axis, three along the y, and fourteen up the z-axis. So far, so good. Then came the surprising part, the reanalysis of time that contemporaries like the mathematician and mathematical physicist Hermann Minkowski saw as the crux of Einstein\x{2019}s argument.4 As Einstein put it: \x{201c}We have to take into account that all our judgments in which time plays a role are always judgments of simultaneous events. If, for instance, I say, \x{2018}That train arrives here at <<7 o\x{2019}clock|6>>,\x{2019} I mean something like this: \x{2018}The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events\x{2019}.\x{201d}5 For simultaneity at one point, there is no problem: if an event located in the immediate vicinity of my watch (say, the train engine pulling up beside me) occurs just when the small hand of the watch reaches the seven, then those two events are obviously simultaneous. The difficulty, Einstein insisted, comes when we have to link events separated in space. What does it mean to say two distant events are simultaneous? How do I compare the reading of my watch here to a train\x{2019}s arrival at another station there at <<7 o\x{2019}clock|6>>?",

            "Figure 1.1 Central Clock Coordination. In his 1905 paper on special relativity, Einstein introduced\x{2014}and rejected\x{2014}a scheme of clock coordination in which the central clock sent a signal to all other clocks; these secondary clocks set their times when the signal arrived. For example, if the central clock sent its time signal at <<3:00 P.M.|2a>>, each secondary clock synchronized its hands to that same <<3:00 P.M.|2a>> when the pulse arrived. Einstein\x{2019}s objection: the secondary clocks were at different distances from the center so close clocks would be set by the arriving signal before distant ones. This made the simultaneity of two clocks depend (unacceptably to Einstein) on the arbitrary circumstance of where the time-setting \x{201c}central\x{201d} clock happened to be.",

            "Having knocked the straw out of this straw man, young Einstein proposed a better system: let one observer at the origin A send a light signal when his clock says <<12:00|2>> to B at a distance d from A; the light signal reflects off B and returns to A. Einstein has B set her clock to noon plus half the round-trip time. A two-second round-trip? Then Einstein has B set her clock to <<noon|13>> plus one second when she gets the signal. Assuming that light travels just as fast in one direction as the other, Einstein\x{2019}s scheme amounts to having B set her clock to <<noon|13>> plus the distance between the two clocks divided by the speed of light. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers per second. So if B is 600,000 kilometers from A when B receives the light signal, she sets her clock to <<12:00|2>>:02, <<noon|13>> plus two seconds. If B were 900,000 kilometers away from A, B would set her clock to <<12:00|2>>:03 when she gets the signal. Continuing in this way, A, B, and anyone else participating in this coordination exercise can all agree that their clocks are synchronized. If we now move the origin, it makes no difference: every clock is already set to take into account the time it takes for a light signal to arrive at the clock\x{2019}s location. Einstein liked this: no privileged \x{201c}master clock,\x{201d} and an unambiguous definition of simultaneity.",

Indeed, Einstein judged the alteration of time in relativity theory to be that theory\x{2019}s most striking feature. But his assessment did not immediately carry the day, even among those who counted themselves as Einstein\x{2019}s backers. Some embraced relativity after experiments on the deflection of electrons seemed to lend it support.

Through tense meetings, exchanges of letters, articles and responses, by <<1910|9n:0>> a growing number of Einstein\x{2019}s colleagues were pointing to the revision of the time concept as the salient feature.

As was their answer: two distant events are simultaneous if coordinated clocks at the two locations read the same\x{2014}<<noon|13>> in Paris, <<noon|13>> in Berlin. Such judgments were inevitably conventions of procedure and rule: to ask about simultaneity was to ask how to coordinate clocks. Their proposal: Send an electromagnetic signal from one clock to the other, taking into account the time the signal takes to arrive (at approximately the speed of light).

Framing himself as a heretic and an outsider, Einstein scrutinized the physics of the fathers not to venerate and improve, but to displace. Einstein saw the coordination of time, and indeed his physics and his philosophy more generally, as part and parcel of the same critical reevaluation of the founding assumptions of the disciplines. Einstein did not move methodically from one aspect of time coordination to another. Most elements of his approach to relativity theory were already in place before he even touched the problem of time; for example, by <<1901|9n:0>> he had already dismissed the ether that Poincar\x{e9} had struggled so hard to maintain. Einstein\x{2019}s engagement with critical works at the boundary of physics and philosophy were by then long-standing, and at the patent office, he and his fellow inspectors had been dissecting the machinery of time for three years. So in May 1905, when Einstein began defining simultaneity by way of electrocoordinated clocks, it was not, as it was for Poincar\x{e9}, a matter of distinguishing \x{201c}apparent\x{201d} from \x{201c}true\x{201d} time alongside a quasi-fictional ether. For Einstein clock coordination was the turn of the key that would at last set in motion the theory machine that he had struggled for a decade to assemble.

Despite the presence of ever-more-vigilant clock tenders on the ships to protect the ticking freight, the measured time difference from the United States to England was, impossibly, different from that from England to the United States. Something on the high seas was confounding the clocks. Astronomers suspected that temperature was probably the culprit, with the lower temperatures far offshore slowing the clockworks. This meant that if a lethargic clock set sail at <<1:00 P.M.|2a>> from Cambridge, Massachusetts, it would arrive in Europe showing that Cambridge time was earlier than it really was and induce British map makers, relying on the clocks arriving in England, to put Cambridge, Massachusetts, to the west of its actual location. Conversely, a slow-running seagoing clock set initially in Liverpool would suggest to the Americans that Liverpool time was earlier than it was, so the New World map makers would draw their maps with Liverpool to the west and therefore closer to the shores of North America. Testing, calculating, and interpolating did little to help. Crowding the ship with more supervisors, better temperature compensators, and superior clocks just spewed out additional conflicting data.

            "Allen was the time shuffler of all time shufflers, the bureaucrat behind the endless lists of trains and schedules. It was Allen who scheduled the local schedulers; Allen, the railroad man who, more than any other, stood responsible for organizing the myriad iron roads into a guide that allowed the traveler to make connections between lines. And he, at least in June 1879, equivocated before he came to back a plan for unification.43 On the one side, he was being pressed by the scientists\x{2019} continental scale of action: they wanted the whole country under the rule of a single time convention. On the other, he and the railroads had to accommodate ordinary people who were used to operating on local time. So he compromised, settling for the status quo that nailed time along the tracks to the big cities they served. In June 1879, Abbe dismissed Allen\x{2019}s antique attachment to calling it <<twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>> when the sun happened to be near the meridian. \x{201c}The advantages of uniform time far outweigh the first week\x{2019}s awkwardness of the proposed change.

            "Fleming wanted a single, universal time convention for the earth as a whole, with each of the twenty-four zones labeled by assigning to the 0-degree longitude line the name prime meridian; the letter A would stand for the 15-degree line, B the 30-degree line, and so on through X (345-degree line). \x{201c}Universal,\x{201d} \x{201c}cosmopolitan,\x{201d} or \x{201c}terrestrial\x{201d} time was then determined by an imaginary clock fixed in the center of the earth, with its hour hand pointed permanently at the sun. When the earth rotated so that meridian line C crossed the hour hand\x{2019}s line of sight to the sun, it would be C o\x{2019}clock everywhere. When D crossed that imaginary line, it was D o\x{2019}clock everywhere. Every clock in the world would display the same time simultaneously. If Big Ben said it was C:30:27 (meaning 30 minutes and 27 seconds past C o\x{2019}clock), then so would a clock at Times Square or downtown Tokyo, the \x{201c}electric telegraph affording the means of securing perfect synchronism all over the earth.\x{201d} Here was a scale of electric time unification that dwarfed even continental America. To accommodate local sensibilities, Fleming hatched watchmaking schemes. One allowed the user to rotate the whole watch face so the wearer\x{2019}s local <<noon|13>> (say, for example, F or Q, depending on location) stood at the top. Another design provided side-by-side clock faces, one for local, the other for terrestrial time.47",

This opposition was not, as Allen sometimes suggested, based on a reactionary attachment to the removal of God\x{2019}s own <<noonday|13>> sun. Protesters uniformly accepted the principle of a railroad-and-telegraph-determined simultaneity. There were, after all, already effective time zones carved out by railroads from the Atlantic to the Pacific. A railroad guide in September 1883, for example, showed some forty-seven lines running on New York time while thirty-six took time from Chicago\x{2019}s clocks, while Philadelphia\x{2019}s clocks governed another thirty-three.60 Every train line accepted the conventionalism of time. This fundamental feature of late-nineteenth-century time was so deeply hammered into rails and wires that it was as present to time-zone protesters as it was to boosters. What then did the dissenters dispute? One newspaper article, defending a single national time, targeted the observatories, where astronomers, in charge of far-flung outposts, had grown fat feeding time to regions; local simultaneity had become \x{201c}the meat upon which these star-gazers feed.\x{201d} Another anti-standard time complaint came from an almanac publisher: sunrise and sunset times would be thrown into a cocked hat by time unification.61 Most protesters simply disputed the dividing lines of conventional simultaneity, their antizonism grounded in the convenience of local train schedules, or regional, national, or universal time. Very few invoked \x{201c}God\x{2019}s true time.\x{201d}62",

Edson forwarded the recommendation to the city\x{2019}s aldermen wrapped in a sheaf of railway documents and institutional endorsements. By year\x{2019}s end, conventionality talk about time was as common in New York as Paris; even an American big-city politician could proclaim: \x{201c}What is called local time is only a mean which differs from astronomical time, but which suits the convenience of the people in any locality because all agree to use it.\x{201d} Since the majority of the community benefits and difference is slight, the mayor reasoned, why not conform to the new standard?68 \x{201c}Conventional and arbitrary,\x{201d} chimed the city fathers, time \x{201c}should be accommodated to that which is most agreeable to the interests of the people whom it is designed to direct.\x{201d} With those words came the resolution that at <<noon|13>> on 18 November 1883, not only the railways but also New York City time would be that of the seventy-fifth meridian, running several minutes west of City Hall.69",

Stars told each station its local time, cables whispered to them of time somewhere else. It was devilishly hard work, demanding precision results, strong cables, and orchestrated teamwork. One of de Bernardi\x{e8}res\x{2019} French collaborators perched his station near the ruins of the city of Chorillos, just south of Lima. Another waited by his telegraph in the observatory of the naval school in Buenos Aires. Linking up the various wires, de Bernadi\x{e8}res began signaling electrically from Valparaiso to Panama. All along the route, relay men struggled to keep the signal moving without a break: the tiny current tickling the mirror; reflected light flickering. As soon as he saw the light spot move, the operator would relaunch the signal. Starting on 18 January 1883, while the Americans were still readying crates in Washington for their expedition along the coast of Peru and Argentina, the French team seized three excellent astronomical and electrical evenings. Just after their last measurement, the submarine cable into Panama snapped, severing communication between their minuscule observatory and Paris. But they had results: the longitude of the flagpole over the stock market of Valparaiso stood <<4 hours, 55 minutes|14>>, and 54.11 seconds earlier than the Montsouris time room thousands of miles to the east.",

Lallemand took two men on a side mission to the far north in the hopes of extending the network into Colombia, but they were promptly stymied by political turbulence. In a somewhat optimistic aside, Poincar\x{e9} conveyed the expedition leaders\x{2019} hope that, <<before 1904|9n:0>>, they would have established telegraphic simultaneity to all the far north stations short of Colombia.50",

He developed electrically maintained pendula so regular that they far surpassed mechanical ones: a heavy pendulum swung freely except when it needed an electromagnetic boost. Alongside such electrical timepieces, Hipp perfected recording clocks that radically altered experimental psychology. Collaborating with physicists and astronomers, he tracked the transmission speeds of nerves, telegraphs, and light, thereby inventing, altering, and producing new ways to use electricity and clocks to materialize time. Though he worked closely with scientists (especially Swiss astronomer Adolphe Hirsch), Hipp was more artisan-entrepreneur than mathematician-savant.

In the fifty or so Swiss electric clock patents granted in the years <<around 1905|18:1>>, for example (they are typical), there is not a single footnote either to another patent or to a scientific or technical article.110 This comparison does not prove, of course, why Einstein did not cite others in that first paper. But it may help make sense of why a young patent officer in a hurry may not have felt impelled to situate his work in the matrix of papers by a Lorentz, a Poincar\x{e9}, an Abraham, or a Cohn. After three years of evaluating hundreds of patents under Haller\x{2019}s rigorous demands for analysis and presentation, the specificities of patent work had become, for Einstein, a way of life, a form of work, and (as he suggested to Zangger) a precise and austere style of writing.111",

According to Swiss patent law (and not only Swiss law), the description of the invention was to be \x{201c}representable through a model, the unity of the invention defended, the consequences of the patent must be unambiguously laid out and lucidly ordered, so the whole is easily understood by properly certified technicians as well as by specialists.\x{201d}112 In all his theoretical papers written <<around 1905|18:0>>, Einstein ended with a series of assertions about what the experimental consequences would be. In the case of the relativity paper, he concluded with the sharp, numbered paragraphs occasionally used in physics papers but standard in the \x{201c}claims\x{201d} section required by Swiss statute to appear at the end of every patent.113 Strikingly, from 1905 Einstein began describing (and occasionally drawing) devices, not only for his little electrostatic Maschinchen but also as key components of his theoretical arguments.",

            "Repeated ceaselessly from East Africa to the Far East, the procedure of electromagnetic clock coordination was at once thoroughly technological and altogether theoretical. It was brass tubes with fragile, suspended mirrors, and it was global control of \x{201c}universal time.\x{201d} It was vast lengths of copper cable protected by heavy gutta-percha insulation, lying a mile under the ocean and served by brass telegraph keys inside crude observatory shacks; it was also the phantasmagorical reach of empire. Surveyors and astronomers pored over personal equations, calculating and correcting measurements through simultaneity on their way to the map, the final, prized product of their longitude work. But clock coordination was also the assembly of synchronized clocks strung together like beads along a continent-spanning chain through Europe, Russia, and North America. This fusion of technology and science drew together (though often in all-out struggle) Swiss horlogiers, American train schedulers, British astronomers, and members of the German General Staff. At <<one|9m:1>> extreme, time synchronization represents technology conditioning humdrum daily procedure at every two-bit whistle-stop. As such it is a substantial part of the thick social history of the New England or Brandenburg countryside. At the other extreme, it stands for the symbolic reach of modernity that had mayors, physicists, and philosophers, pronouncing on the conventionality of time while poets payed homage to the annihilation of space by speed. In this register, clock coordination was rarified history, pursued at the pinnacle of European philosophy and mathematical physics.",

            "Einstein\x{2019}s stance toward the great academies of science was different. Just after World War I, Arthur Eddington, the British astrophysicist, took advantage of a total eclipse to measure the deflection of starlight by the gravitational pull of the sun (or as Einstein would have it, by the sun\x{2019}s bending of spacetime). Thrust into front-page fame by the resulting confirmation of his general theory of relativity, Einstein overnight became a world figure. Facing the limelight in his increasingly public role, his relativity work <<after 1919|18:0>> moved toward the abstract unification of physical forces and away from the machine culture of the patent office. A few days after his 1933 speech in Royal Albert Hall, Einstein left for the United States, where he embraced a venerated if monastic existence at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Half seer, half mascot, he spoke in oracular terms on everything from the meaning of God to the future of nuclear warfare. In April 1953, two years before his death, Einstein wrote from Princeton to Maurice Solovine of the laughter and insight of their so-unacademic academy during Einstein\x{2019}s Bern years, when patents, physics, and philosophy stood side by side:",
