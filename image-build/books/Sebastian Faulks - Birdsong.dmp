Madame Azaire would tell her which rooms were to be done and if there were special preparations to be made for guests. The old woman\x{2019}s heavy, rolling step could be heard as she trundled to her prescribed task. Lisette sat in the sunlight that splashed into the room beneath the spokes of clematis at the window, watching the shadows on the polished table, listening to the way her stepmother ran the household.
