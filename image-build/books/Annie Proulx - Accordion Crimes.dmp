He had come in very late, hours <<past midnight|13>>, after a week away at the Robinsonville levee break. He had no doubt; it had been dynamited by the malcontents he had fired from the timber contract; foreigners, all of them, observed creeping and slinking for the better part of a week. And as soon as the levee breached they\x{2019}d disappeared. The damage was local, hard on the Yazoo Valley, but in the long run the silt deposit would improve the bottomland. He knew one thing; he\x{2019}d rather have niggers than dago socialist rabble screaming for weekly paydays and threatening strikes and blowing up levees in revenge when they did not get what they wanted. His eyes burned. The staircase wound as did a chambered nautilus, and he walked down quickly, one hand on the banister\x{2014}taking pleasure in the mild centrifugal force of the descent, the flash of his passage in silvered mirrors\x{2014}stepped into the foyer, glancing at the seascape, a study of icebergs in some northern sea, hanging against the brown paper, looked through the archway at the hall stand with its coats like headless bodies, taking satisfaction in the carved chair, the electroplated card receiver with the head of Hadrian staring at the beaded doorknob. He noted the sweep of herled feathers in a jardiniere\x{2014}that was new\x{2014}felt the usual irritation at his squabby reflection in the hall-stand mirror. He yawned.",

The bow sank quickly, but the stern floated on, filled with fire that set the sugar barrels ablaze. The moonlight shone on the rolling waves and the wet faces of the drowning passengers, who cried out in six languages. Loats kicked to shore in the company of a young Dutch woman, both clinging to the headboard of the captain\x{2019}s pine bed. As the headboard dipped and plunged, Loats imagined a life-saving machine, a right-angled wooden frame with an inflated rubber cushion for buoyancy, a rear propeller driven by a hand crank, another under the feet driven by pedals; and there would be a mast with a little sail, a whistle hanging from a lanyard, a signal flag, and even a lantern. But how could one light the lantern? He puzzled at it until the waves swept them into the sandy surf. He helped the woman, reeling and choking, toward a green house with smoke streaming from the chimney. All along the wet sand lay the wooden shoes of drowned Dutchmen and from the woods a bear emerged, head up into the wind, lured by the smell of burning sugar.",

Enormous sensitivities prickled: loud colors, bright light, the beeping of dump trucks in reverse, slamming doors and the conversations around him scraped his nerves raw. He developed allergies to dust, mold, apples and tomatoes. He was constipated, bought packets of laxatives at the Cut Rate drugstore in Millinocket, but nothing worked. He heard of a health food store that had just opened in Portland and made the long drive to forage through the jars of blackstrap and honey, the coarse bran and dark apricot ears. He bought packets of ginseng tea and nerve tisanes but developed abdominal pain, sore throat, shooting pains in his joints. One night pain spread through his face, a dull, severe ache that was unbearable at night. It hurt to rest his cheek on the pillow but if he turned on his back the pain flowed in waves from ear to ear. His mouth was burning up, his tongue swelled until he could barely speak. He woke at <<two in the morning|9a>> with groin pains shooting up one leg and into his abdomen, across and down the other leg, circumscribing an endless circle of pain.

That\x{2019}s what they did, you know, in the old days, people just made music with each other for a good time, not for money, but always there was a family that was good, they all played the instruments. On Sundays we\x{2019}d have a picnic in Glowacka Park, start at <<noon|9g>>, and you could buy a hot dog or good Polish things; I sold pierozki at these picnics and made a nice bit of money. There\x{2019}d always be somebody\x{2019}s polka band\x{2014}two violins, you know, the bass fiddle and the clarinet, no accordion at all, they\x{2019}d just play all afternoon and we\x{2019}d dance. No music pages, they play from their heads, they were geniuses. You know, the dancers used to sing out a line of a song, or not even sing it, just shout it like, and the musicians they had to catch it, know it and play it back in the same key. Oh, they were so good. Well, your grandfather, he sees after a while there is some money starting to come to the polka band players and there was all kinds of places that wanted polka bands\x{2014}Polish Homes, the Polish Club, not the culture evening but the Saturday night dance, little dance halls all over the place, the union halls, bars and Polka Dot restaurant, the Polish League of War Veterans, a lot of restaurants, Polonia Hall\x{2014}oh, there was plenty of polka dancing, and a lot of fun, and weddings, weddings, weddings, everybody was getting married and you got to have polkas. So your grandfather decides, this is in 1926, he decides he\x{2019}s going to have a polka band. So he gets a couple of fellows together, a fiddle, they don\x{2019}t need the second one because they got the accordion, a clarinet, drums, and he\x{2019}s very good. They picked an American name, the Polkalookas. The drum was good, pick up their feet, yes? He was a shrewdie, your grandfather. He\x{2019}d take two engagements for the same night, hire some extra fellows and get both bands set up at different places, then he\x{2019}d run back and forth between them and collect the money for both. It was not so old-fashioned, this music, as the polka bands in the park. No, a little faster and louder because of the accordion and the drums. And he got the idea for the Baby Polka Band, he got your father, Hieronim, only six years old, and five or six other little kids and got them all going with instruments, playing little baby polkas. A comb and paper, a triangle, they had a little girl singer, so cute. People loved this very much. But he was not happy and he drank all the money from the band playing. After a while he quit, just like that, but your father, Hieronim, he kept on, played with other bands, whoever would ask him, even though he was young, and he brought every cent he earned back to me.\x{201d}",

Cars and trucks slid and stalled on the greasy streets and she was shaking with cold by the time the sign HOTEL POLONIA MOTEL came in sight. Under the streetlight, a few hundred feet from the Polonia, something small stuck out of the snow. She picked it up, a pack of cards with a rubber band around it and a folded paper. She pulled the paper loose, it unfolded into two ten-dollar bills. The pack of cards showed whores in bizarre display postures.',
