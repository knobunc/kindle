Erosion had been stealing land in the Chesapeake decades before anyone talked about climate change, they\x{2019}ll tell you. Why, look at Holland Island. Rising seas didn\x{2019}t kill it. Waves simply tore at the shore where most of its households were concentrated, until people there had to move.

            'By <<2007|9n:0>>, the fishery was poised at the brink of collapse. The total population of blue crabs in the bay had plunged from 791 million in 1990 to 260 million. Of that 260 million, just 120 million were adult crabs capable of producing a new generation, well below the 200 million adults that experts deemed the rock bottom necessary to sustain the crab as a viable part of the Chesapeake ecosystem. That year, 2007, was the worst for crabbers since bay-wide record keeping began in 1945.',

That was true all around the bay: In 1994\x{2013}95, the Chesapeake had been worked by <<346|3:0>> dredge boats, each manned by a captain and one or two mates. Just four years later, the number dropped to 192.

And indeed, by <<2007|9n:0>> only fifty-three boats were still at it, just a dozen from Tangier.

            "<<AN HOUR BEFORE ONE|10>> JUNE SUNUP I hitch a ride out to Ooker\x{2019}s crab shanty with Donald Thorne Jr., a.k.a. Thornie, first cousin to Carol Moore. I find the mayor packing soft crabs for market while listening to an Eastern Shore farm report on the radio. A crabber\x{2019}s life resembles a farmer\x{2019}s in manifold ways, he tells me. His livelihood is dependent on the weather, for one thing, and on other natural forces beyond his control: the bay\x{2019}s temperature and salinity, the health of its underwater grasses, the preponderance or dearth of fish that prey on juvenile crabs. His income, like a farmer\x{2019}s, turns on whatever price the market sets for his product, and he doesn\x{2019}t have much say in that, either. Prices typically start high in the spring, when crabs are fresh from the mud and just starting their migration, and drop steadily as their numbers increase after Memorial Day, reaching a seasonal low in late July or August, when the animals are at their greatest abundance. Beyond that general rule, however, a Tangierman cannot count on much. \x{201c}You find out what the price is when you come in with your catch,\x{201d} Ooker says. \x{201c}Sometimes they won\x{2019}t even put a price on your ticket\x{2014}they\x{2019}ll just tell you it will be higher or lower than the day before.\x{201d}",

Ed Parks, maternal grandfather of mailboat skipper Brett Thomas, has pulled up to the dock in a skiff. Beside him are two boxes of swelling toads, as Tangiermen call the spiked and self-inflating northern puffers. Ugly though the fish are, they\x{2019}re undeniably delicious. Skinned and deep-fried, they enjoy growing popularity as \x{201c}sugar toads,\x{201d} a restaurant appetizer. Even so, the eighty-year-old Ed is one of a few Tangier crabbers who fish for them.",
