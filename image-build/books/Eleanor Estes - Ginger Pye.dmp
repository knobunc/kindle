            'That weekend was a cold, raw, and bleak one. Rachel slept on a small cot in the parlor and she could not get warm the whole night. She didn\'t have enough covers and her feet would not warm up. She stayed awake and stayed awake and though she scrunched herself up into a tight ball, she still stayed cold. Since Auntie Hoyt was poor, Rachel imagined she did not have any more covers in the cupboard and she felt she should not embarrass her by asking for more. Anyway she didn\'t want to be a nuisance and wake anybody up, so she shivered and shook. Also she didn\'t want Papa to think he had such a cold daughter he could not possibly take her on any more trips. Rachel longed to go on bird trips with Papa, to the coldest North and the hottest South and traipse through the swamps of Florida. She had to be stoic. It must have been <<about three in the morning|9h>> before she ever fell asleep.',

Moreover, he thought he could run over to Mrs. Speedy\'s before the dusting of the pews and explain to her that he had the dollar, that all he had to do was dust some pews, that is, and then the dollar would be his.

It was really hard work. Jerry did not care how hard he worked though. Thoughts of the little puppy that was going to be his when the last pew and pulpit were dusted put heart and speed in his hands. In Rachel\'s too. But not in Uncle Bennie\'s. He was merely making a chivalrous gesture toward this unusual way of spending Saturday. After all, he was only three and who would expect him to take the dusting of the pews seriously? Uncle Bennie was having a good time anyway, climbing up and down the pews and pushing all the hymnals and prayer books to the ends of their little racks.
