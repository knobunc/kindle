Most of the yards were just let run to long grass, and the buildings were log or unpainted board, but there were a few brick houses, and a few of painted clapboards with gimcracks around the veranda rails. Around them the grass was cut, and lilac bushes were planted in the shade. There were big purple cones of blossom on them. Already Bridger\x{2019}s Wells was losing its stage-stop look and beginning to settle into a half-empty village of the kind that hangs on sometimes where all the real work is spread out on the land around it, and most of the places take care of themselves.",

I thought quickly, in the middle of what I was really thinking, that now I didn\x{2019}t know any of those men; they were strangers and enemies, except Gil. And yet I did know most of them, at least by their faces and outfits, and to talk to, and liked them: quiet, gentle men, and the most independent in the world too, you\x{2019}d have said, not likely, man for man, to be talked into anything. But now, stirred up or feeling they ought to be, one little yelp about Judge Tyler and I might as well have raped all their sisters, or even their mothers. And the queerest part of it was that there weren\x{2019}t more than two or three, those from Drew\x{2019}s outfit, who really knew Kinkaid; he wasn\x{2019}t easy to know. And the chances were <<ten to one|10a:0>> that a lot more than that among them had, one time or another, done a little quiet brand changing themselves. It wasn\x{2019}t near as uncommon as you\x{2019}d think; the range was all still pretty well open then, and those riders came from all ends of cow country from the Rio to the Tetons. It wouldn\x{2019}t have been held too much against them either, as long as it wasn\x{2019}t done on a big scale so somebody took a real loss.

At that she boiled it down better than anybody else had. Kinkaid had been killed way down in the southwest corner of the valley, eight miles below the ranch. They didn\x{2019}t know just when, but it must have been <<noon|13>> or earlier, because a couple of the riders had picked up his horse clear over by the ranch road, and at <<about two o\x{2019}clock|6>> had found Kinkaid lying on his back in the sun in a dry wash over under the mountains. Greene didn\x{2019}t know if there were any more cattle gone; they hadn\x{2019}t been able to distinguish the rustlers\x{2019} tracks. Too many cattle had been working over the range there, and there were still a lot of horses\x{2019} prints from the roundup. She kept him toned down except on that one thing, that Kinkaid had been shot through the head. That was the one thing he seemed to have clear without question. He had kept on saying that to the men too. It impressed him that Kinkaid had been shot through the head, as if he could feel it more, as if he would have felt better if Kinkaid had been shot in the belly or in the back, or anywhere but in the head. When Ma asked him, he admitted that he hadn\x{2019}t seen Kinkaid, but that the man who told him had. No, he hadn\x{2019}t seen the sheriff down there; it must have been <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>> before they sent him to Bridger\x{2019}s and he hadn\x{2019}t seen the sheriff all day.",
