The missionaries spent the next few days waiting around, pestering him for permission to settle. The only thing worse than a missionary coming to your house is a whole troupe of missionaries coming to your house day after day, begging to move next door. One day they brought the king an extravagant Bible they had intended to give his father. Then they invited him to dinner on the Thaddeus and sang him hymns. Another time he made the excuse that he couldn\x{2019}t give them an answer until he consulted Queen Kaahumanu, who was away on a fishing trip. One morning the white men and women paid a visit to the king\x{2019}s house and were scandalized to learn he was still in bed at <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>>.

            "The missionaries, Smola points out, employed \x{201c}the Roman alphabet we use in English. Now, the initial form of written Hawaiian in 1822 consisted of seventeen of twenty-six English characters. Five vowels, twelve consonants. By <<1826|9n:0>> there was an effort to standardize the written form of the language. They thought they were better served by a smaller alphabet. What they found was that several letters served the same purpose. For example B and D functioned the same as P; K the same as T; L the same as R; and B the same as W. If you look up an 1825 map of Oahu, you\x{2019}ll see a little tiny town on the south shore marked \x{2018}Honoruru,\x{2019} as opposed to Honolulu. You also see references to \x{2018}Tamehameha,\x{2019} as opposed to Kamehameha. So basically what happened was by 1826 a committee of mikanele and native Hawaiians got together and voted B, D, R, T, and V out of the alphabet, leaving us a modern Hawaiian alphabet of twelve letters. A, E, I, O, U, H, P, L, K, M, N, W.",

            "Translating directly from Hebrew and Greek to Hawaiian speaks to the influence of the original New England clerics. The desire to train ministers capable of studying the Bible in Hebrew and Greek is the foundation of higher education in New England, and thus the United States. The Massachusetts Bay colonists, whose early ministers were mostly Cambridge-trained theologians from the old country, clamored to build a college on the outskirts of Boston to train a new generation of clergymen in those ancient tongues. And so, only six years after their arrival in the New World, they founded Harvard College in 1636. Harvard did not drop compulsory Hebrew for all students until <<1755|9c:1>>, the year John Adams graduated. Those finicky standards speak to the reason Hiram Bingham and Asa Thurston were the only members of the first company of missionaries to be called missionaries. The other men on the Thaddeus were deemed \x{201c}assistants.\x{201d} Bingham and Thurston were properly ordained graduates of the new seminary at Andover. Thurston had attended Timothy Dwight\x{2019}s Yale before that. This preoccupation, more than racism, explains why later on the New Englanders will deny the indispensible Thomas Hopu\x{2019}s request to become a full-fledged minister instead of merely the missionaries\x{2019} helper\x{2014}not so much because he was Hawaiian but because he wasn\x{2019}t a seminarian.",

The whalers visited Hawaii to refuel, pick up fresh food, water, and other supplies, air out ornery crews, and hire on new sailors, many of them native Hawaiians, to replace deserters.",
