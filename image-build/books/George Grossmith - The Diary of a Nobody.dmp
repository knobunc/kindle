Found Borset waiting. He had been three times during the day to apologise for his conduct last night. He said he was unable to take his Bank Holiday last Monday, and took it last night instead. He begged me to accept his apology, and a pound of fresh butter. He seems, after all, a decent sort of fellow; so I gave him an order for some fresh eggs, with a request that on this occasion they should be fresh. I am afraid we shall have to get some new stair-carpets after all; our old ones are not quite wide enough to meet the paint on either side. Carrie suggests that we might ourselves broaden the paint. I will see if we can match the colour (dark chocolate) on Monday.",

He said he spent half-a-day calling at warehouses to see if he could get it. He suggested he should entirely repaint the stairs. It would cost very little more; if he tried to match it, he could only make a bad job of it. It would be more satisfactory to him and to us to have the work done properly. I consented, but felt I had been talked over. Planted some mustard-and-cress and radishes, and went to bed at <<nine|9c:1>>.',

Franching apologised for the short notice; but said he had at the last moment been disappointed of two of his guests and regarded us as old friends who would not mind filling up the gap. Carrie rather demurred at the invitation; but I explained to her that Franching was very well off and influential, and we could not afford to offend him. \x{201c}And we are sure to get a good dinner and a good glass of champagne.\x{201d} \x{201c}Which never agrees with you!\x{201d} Carrie replied, sharply. I regarded Carrie\x{2019}s observation as unsaid. Mr. Franching asked us to wire a reply. As he had said nothing about dress in the letter, I wired back: \x{201c}With pleasure. Is it full dress?\x{201d} and by leaving out our name, just got the message within the sixpence.",

Why do people live such a long way off? Having to change \x{2019}buses, I allowed plenty of time\x{2014}in fact, too much; for we arrived at <<twenty minutes to seven|10>>, and Franching, so the servant said, had only just gone up to dress.

Knowing that the dinner was only for us six, we never dreamed it would be a full dress affair. I had no appetite. It was quite <<twenty minutes past eight|10>> before we sat down to dinner.
