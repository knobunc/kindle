We were about to have a lovely summer and even now at <<ten thirty in the morning|5>> you could see that this day was going to be, by English standards, a scorcher. My original plan was to stroll west along the front to Craigweil, to see where the king had stayed, but that hope was dashed when I learned that Craigweil was torn down in 1939 and that today the site is lost somewhere beneath a housing estate. So instead I walked east along the promenade towards Felpham because that was the direction that nearly all the other strollers were going in and I assumed they knew what they were doing.',

            "I had never been put in charge of anything in the adult world before, and I took the responsibility seriously, and spent the first morning marching around the ward like Captain Bligh patrolling the deck of the Bounty. But gradually it dawned on me that there wasn\x{2019}t actually a great deal of prestige or reward in being in charge of forty empty beds and a communal bathroom, so I began to look for diversions. Tuke offered precious little. The day room contained a small selection of games and jigsaw puzzles, but the puzzles were either mixed up or conspicuously incomplete and the games required a second player. The ward\x{2019}s numerous cupboards yielded nothing but cleaning materials, a stepladder, and an artificial Christmas tree with several branches missing. But then at the very back of one cupboard I found five or six boxes of Woman\x{2019}s Own, a weekly magazine full of cheerful advice and enlightenment for the homemaker, representing a more or less complete set of issues from <<about 1950|18:0>> to nearly the present, and these I hauled out one box at a time and carried to the ward office.",

The advent of cheap package holidays meant people could go to the sunny Mediterranean for less than they paid to shiver for a week at Butlin\x{2019}s. For older people and those with families, the teenage clientele became a disincentive because of their tendency to fight and vomit copiously. Under pressure to keep costs down, the holiday camps skimped on maintenance and grew increasingly threadbare. At <<one|9m:0>> camp on the Isle of Wight \x{2013} not a Butlin\x{2019}s, it must be said \x{2013} conditions were so appalling that four hundred holidaymakers revolted and refused to pay their bills.

They were booked to stay for four nights, but by the second afternoon the children were begging to be taken somewhere where the sheets weren\x{2019}t sticky and they weren\x{2019}t mugged for their sweets by feral children wedged into a bend on the helter-skelter.
