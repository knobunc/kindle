After three hours the train seemed not clumsy and old anymore but venerable and important, and the image of the bush as an ocean that had come to me earlier was part of it, the train like an old vessel plowing this ocean. It stopped often and everywhere, not always at a station or a platform but in the middle of nowhere, in the yellowy bush, the spindly tree limbs stuck against the window, and the wall of foliage so close that the locomotive\'s racket echoed against it. There seemed no point in these stops, fifteen or twenty of them <<before noon|13>>, and several times the train hesitated, rolled backwards for half a minute, lurched, and then started up again. I was not dismayed. Like the slow speed, the sudden stops and reverses made the whole business odd and agreeable.',

It was always on Saturdays that the trains brought the prisoners of war home from the German camps. In the first year after the war many of these Dutch soldiers got off the train to meet their joyous relatives, and then there were fewer, and at last in the 1950s, none.',
