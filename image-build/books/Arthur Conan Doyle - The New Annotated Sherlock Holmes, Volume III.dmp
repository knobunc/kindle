            "6 When London\x{2019}s first university college was founded in Bloomsbury in 1828, its mission was\x{2014}at least in part\x{2014}to make higher education available to non-Anglicans, who were at that time barred from attending Oxford and Cambridge. \x{201c}It was a true London institution,\x{201d} writes Peter Ackroyd in London: The Biography, \x{201c}its founders comprising radicals, Dissenters, Jews and utilitarians.\x{201d} (Historian Roy Porter reports that critics scorned it as \x{201c}that godless institution in Gower Street.\x{201d}) The college\x{2019}s educational philosophy, too, differed fundamentally from that of Oxford and Cambridge: the goal of what became known as University College was to produce practising doctors and engineers, not scholars and theologians. A second London college, King\x{2019}s College, was founded in 1829 by members of the Anglican church; and in 1836, the University of London was formed as an administrative entity designed to examine and confer degrees upon students from both institutions. That jurisdiction was broadened by the Supplemental Charter of 1849, which allowed students from anywhere in the British Empire to earn degrees from the University of London. In 1878\x{2014}the year Watson earned his degree\x{2014}the university became the first in the United Kingdom to grant degrees to women, and in fact had been educating women at its London School of Medicine for Women since 1874. The university did not begin offering its own courses until <<1900|9c:0>>. There is no indication of where Watson actually studied.",

Initially confined to a government-controlled island in the Bronx\x{2019}s East River, after a legal struggle, Mallon won her release, agreeing to give up her occupation and report to health officials regularly. She proceeded to vanish for five years. When an epidemic of typhus broke out in a Manhattan maternity hospital, Mallon was discovered working there as a cook under a false name. She was again confined to the island facility, where she remained until her death twenty-three years later. The infection of forty-seven people, three of whom died, is attributed to Mallon. At the time of Mallon\x{2019}s first arrest, there was at least one other known carrier in New York, Tony Labella, who had caused more cases of typhoid (120) and deaths (seven) than Mallon. Labella fled to New Jersey and was no more cooperative than Mallon.",

It was rare for him to be up <<after ten at night|9h>>, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning.53 Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.54 Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.55',

            "97 The violins made by Antonio Stradivari (1644\x{2013}1737) at his workshop in Cremona, Italy, have long been prized for their perfect design and pure tone. While apprenticing with Nicol\x{f2} Amati in 1666 (see below), Stradivari began making improvements upon Amati\x{2019}s model and creating violins with the Latin inscription Antonius Stradivarius Cremonensis Faciebat Anno [date] imprinted on them. (It should be noted that such a label may or may not indicate authenticity.) Stradivari\x{2019}s best work was done <<after 1700|18:0>>; the instruments he produced during that period set the standard by which modern violins are designed and judged. A fitting description is found in The Lost Stradivarius (1895), by John Meade Falkner, in which a Stradivarius discovered in an old cupboard is described as possessing \x{201c}a light-red colour, with a varnish of peculiar lustre and softness. The neck seemed rather longer than ordinary, and the scroll was remarkably bold and free.\x{201d} Approximately 650 of Stradivari\x{2019}s more than 1,100 violins, cellos, harps, guitars, mandolins, and violas survive today.",

Bradford\x{2019}s Atlas (1838) referenced a great desert that extended from the Arkansas Territory into Colorado and Wyoming, including South Dakota and parts of Nebraska and Kansas.

Martyrdom of Man, a religious treatment of history that skewered accepted opinion because of its non-religious orientation, was published in London in 1872 and, despite a uniformly hostile public reception (it was not reviewed favourably until <<1906|18:0>>), achieved both mass readership and wide popularity among intellectuals such as H.

Among Reade\x{2019}s other books were his African Sketch Book, a travelogue told in the form of a journal (addressed to \x{201c}Dear Margaret\x{201d}), and The Outcast, completed and published the year Reade died, in which the author\x{2014}ill from the lingering effects of dysentery and fever contracted during the Ashanti campaign that culminated in the taking of Coomassie (now Kumasi), which he was the only civilian to witness\x{2014}spoke in fictional form of the effects of persecution that comes from professing one\x{2019}s lack of religious belief.

            "<<About twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>> last night [said the Standard],166 Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto\x{2019}s person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood police station and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo. It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones\x{2019}s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more de-centralized,167 and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.",

(The police did not acquire motorboats until <<1910|18:1>>.) Under the command of Superintendent George Steed, the force consisted in 1887 of 44 inspectors, 4 sergeants, and 124 constables, according to Charles Dickens, Jr. (Dictionary of the Thames, 1887). These numbers had increased 10 percent by the following year.

There was a variety of headgear: a hard glazed hat, a peaked yachtsman\x{2019}s cap, or a straw hat. The officers decorated their collars with a nickel anchor. Dickens, Jr., writes: \x{201c}Both night and day several boats patrol the river in different parts; a fresh boat starting from the station hard every two hours to relieve the one whose watch is up. Each boat contains an inspector and two men, the latter of whom do the rowing, and a careful system of supervision is maintained by which the passing of each boat is checked at varying points. Two steam launches are also employed\x{201d}; by 1898, eight more steam launches had been added. The work was dangerous, and between 1857 and 1901 at least two officers drowned in the line of duty.",

On the 4th of June Sir Charles had declared his intention of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore to prepare his luggage. That night he went out as usual for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar. He never returned. At <<twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>> Barrymore, finding the hall door still open, became alarmed and, lighting a lantern, went in search of his master. The day had been wet, and Sir Charles\x{2019}s footmarks were easily traced down the Alley, and it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered. One fact which has not been explained is the statement of Barrymore that his master\x{2019}s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onwards to have been walking on his toes. One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears by his own confession to have been the worse for drink. He declares that he heard cries, but is unable to state from what direction they came. No signs of violence were to be discovered upon Sir Charles\x{2019}s person and though the doctor\x{2019}s evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion\x{2014}so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient who lay before him\x{2014}it was explained that this is a symptom which is not unusual in cases of dyspn\x{153}a39 and death from cardiac exhaustion. This explanation was borne out by the post-mortem examination, which showed long standing organic disease, and the coroner\x{2019}s jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.40 It is well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost importance that Sir Charles\x{2019}s heir should settle at the Hall, and continue the good work which has been so sadly interrupted. Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been difficult to find a tennant for Baskerville Hall. It is understood that the next-of-kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville, if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville\x{2019}s younger brother. The young man, when last heard of, was in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a view to informing him of his good fortune.",

This method gives as the ratio of map distances to actual distance on the surface of the Earth, without indication of units (for example, 1:63,360, <<1:10|2>>,060). (Note that there are 12 x 5,280, or 63,360, inches to the mile.) According to the Encyclop\x{e6}dia Britannica (9th Ed.), the typical Ordnance Survey parish map had a large scale of 1:2500, the typical town map a very large scale of 1:500 (and, of course, consisted of numerous sheets). Thus a map at the normal 1-inch (1:63,360 RF) scale showing a radius of five miles (10 miles wide) would be 10 inches wide, while a 6-inch scale map (<<1:10|2>>,060) would be 5 feet square. At the parish scale of 1:2500, a five-mile radius requires a map over 20 feet square and at the town scale of 1:500 would be over 100 feet square! (Sabine Baring-Gould\x{2019}s fine handbook entitled Devon [1907] reproduces the entire area on a map about two feet square, which uses a scale of 4 miles to the inch (that is, 1:253,440), but of course this does not show anything so small as a \x{201c}clump of buildings.\x{201d}) If Holmes had only a single map showing the relevant area, it was likely a 6-inch scale map, which would be convenient to use if folded. Watson states that Holmes \x{201c}unrolled\x{201d} a section\x{2014}rolling such a map would have produced an unwieldy five-foot-long tube!",

Hunter, a mechanically minded boy who grew up on a farm near Glasgow and left school at thirteen to roam the fields and teach himself animal economy, first officially took up the scalpel under the guidance of his brother, William Hunter, a London obstetrician and teacher of anatomy and dissection. He displayed an instant talent for the work, and William arranged for him to have surgical training at St. George\x{2019}s, St. Bartholomew\x{2019}s, and Chelsea Hospitals in London, also publishing his younger brother\x{2019}s first paper, \x{201c}The State of the Testis in the Foetus and on the Hernia Congenita,\x{201d} in Medical Commentaries (1762).

Within five years Sholes had arrived at the consummate design\x{2014}the Remington 2 model, with its famed qwerty keyboard, featuring the shift key, which physically moved the carriage to produce capitals letters. The marketing firm of Wyckoff, Seamans, and Benedict acquired sole distribution rights in 1883 and, in 1886, sole manufacturing rights, buying the typewriter portion of the business from Remington. The Remington brand name remained in place. In the summer of 1894, the Remington Company, as it continued to be called, placed Model No. 6 on the market\x{2014}by far its most serviceable and popular design\x{2014}with the slogan \x{201c}to save time is to lengthen life.\x{201d} All of these early models were of an upstrike, or \x{201c}blind,\x{201d} design: When the typist hit a key, the type swung up against the platen and made its impression on the paper; the typist (or \x{201c}type-writer,\x{201d} then the more common term for the individual using the machine) had to lift the carriage in order to determine if the correct key had been struck. A frontstrike (\x{201c}visible\x{201d}) model was not marketed until <<1908|9c:0>>. Apart from typewriters, Remington also made sewing machines, and many of the first typewriters, which sold for a hefty \$100 and were in fact manufactured by the sewing machine department of the Remington arms company, resembled the beautiful, early machines prized by seamstresses, with their decorative flower panels, mother-of-pearl inlay, and, in some cases, bronze finishes.",

From the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired man rushed out on the landing.',

            "132 In choosing a disguise for a Vermissa company, Watson may have looked no farther than the newspapers. By <<1912|9n:0>>, the French comic actor Max Linder (1883\x{2013}1925) was the highest paid film star in the world. Born Gabriel-Maximilien Leuviefle, he preceded Charlie Chaplin as a recognisable silent-film genius whose slapstick antics captivated audiences. Linder wrote, directed, and starred in all his own early films, which always featured the actor as an upper-class bachelor (\x{201c}Max\x{201d}) in pursuit of a pretty young woman. His service in the military in World War I was well publicised, as was his suffering from a gas attack and his subsequent breakdown. Commercial failures in the early 1920s may have contributed to his death in a suicide pact with his wife in 1925.",
