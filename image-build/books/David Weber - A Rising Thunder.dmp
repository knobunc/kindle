He should have known better than to listen! Yet given what had happened to the Manties\x{2019} home system, the temptation to double down had been overwhelming.

            "Hell, they\x{2019}d be more than human if they weren\x{2019}t worried! he thought coldly. But whatever happens to us, Tango Two is screwed. There\x{2019}s no way in this universe that forty superdreadnoughts can match the defensive firepower of four hundred and thirty of them!
A minute passed. Two minutes. <<Three|9k:0>>.
Eleventh Fleet\x{2019}s velocity rose to 5,647 KPS. The hyper limit lay 963,000 kilometers behind Oppenheimer, and the range to Tango Two had fallen to 12.3 million kilometers. The Manties were 3.2 million kilometers inside Cataphract\x{2019}s powered envelope, even with no ballistic phase built into the attack run, although projected accuracy at forty-one light-seconds would be abysmal. On the other hand, he only had to worry about forty targets, and each of his superdreadnoughts had twelve missile pods towing astern. That gave him over five thousand pods, each containing ten missiles, which didn\x{2019}t even count his tubes. Each of his superdreadnoughts had given up a pair of tubes in each broadside to squeeze in Aegis, but that left them thirty per side. If he flushed all of his pods and fired a full broadside from each of his superdreadnoughts, he could put over 64,000 missiles into space simultaneously.",

Magellan saw the dark-faced captain\x{2019}s expression change abruptly as his own image appeared on the other man\x{2019}s display.
