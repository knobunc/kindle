He walked south two blocks, and the only car he saw was a taxi that slowed hopefully and then went on when he made no gesture. The lobbies of the big apartment buildings were lighted, and uniformed doormen dozed in leather chairs behind brass-fitted doors. He turned east and found Susdorf and Cherry sitting on the granite stoop of a town house. They both showed the resentful air of men who had been pulled from sleep. Susdorf nodded. Cherry sneered.',
