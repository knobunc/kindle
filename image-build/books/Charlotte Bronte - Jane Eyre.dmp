Why was I always suffering, always brow-beaten, always accused, forever condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win any one\x{2019}s favor? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage,k was universally indulged. Her beauty\x{2014}her pink cheeks, and golden curls\x{2014}seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John, no one thwarted, much less punished, though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks,l set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory; he called his mother \x{201c}old girl,\x{201d} too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregardedher wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still \x{201c}her own darling.\x{201d} I dared commit no fault; I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to <<noon|13>>, and from <<noon|13>> to night.",

            "Daylight began to forsake the red-room. It was <<past four o\x{2018}clock|6>>, and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain still beating continuously on the stair-case window, and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall. I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sunk. My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so\x{2014}what thought had I been but just conceiving, of starving myself to death! That certainly was a crime; and was I fit to die? or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead church an inviting bourne?m In such vault, I had been told, did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him, but I knew that he was my own uncle\x{2014}my mother\x{2019}s brother; that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house; and that, in his last moments, he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race,n and unconnected with her, after her husband\x{2019}s death, by any tie? It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.",

            'Next day, by <<noon|13>>, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down; but my worst ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there; they were all gone out in the carriage with their mamma. Abbot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging;o but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.',

She had a turn for traffic,v and a marked propensity for saving, shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterrew she wished to sell; and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but, some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of interest\x{2014}fifty or sixty per cent\x{2014}which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.",

Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisseab and bonnet, and, wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery.

At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd\x{2019}s chair reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.

Among the readers, I observed my acquaintance of the verandah; at the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the class,  but for some error of pronunciation or some inattention to stops,ak she was suddenly sent to the very bottom.

Don\x{2019}t trouble yourself to answer\x{2014}I see, you laugh rarely; but you can laugh  very merrily; believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother\x{2014}or father, or master, or what you will\x{2014}to smile too gayly, speak too freely, or move too quickly; but in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.

While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Ad\x{e8}le (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study\x{2014}reasons that I may, nay that I shall, impart to you some day); she pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones. \x{2018}Il faut que je l\x{2019}essaie!\x{2018} cried she; \x{2018}et \x{e0} l\x{2018}instant m\x{ea}me!\x{2019}cr and she rushed out of the room.

It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured\x{2014}on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill.

She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy upper haunt. Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled oaken chamber of the third story; there she sat and sewed\x{2014}and probably laughed drearily to herself\x{2014}as companion-less as a prisoner in his dungeon.",

            "1816 Charlotte Bront\x{eb} is born on April 21 in Thornton, En gland, the third of six children of the Reverend Patrick and Maria Branwell Bront\x{eb}.1817- 1820 Charlotte\x{2019}s younger siblings, Patrick Branwell, Emily, and Anne, are born.1820 The Bront\x{eb} family moves to Haworth, where Reverend Bront\x{eb} has been offered a lifetime curacy.1821 Charlotte\x{2019}s mother, Maria, dies, and her sister, Elizabeth Branwell, moves into the Bront\x{eb} household to help raise the six young children.1824 Charlotte and Emily, along with their older sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, attend Cowan Bridge School.1825 Maria and Elizabeth contract what is probably tuberculosis and die. Charlotte and Emily are pulled out of school to return home to Haworth.1826 The four surviving siblings create the \x{201c}Young Men\x{201d} plays, the first of their imaginative fictional writings, which are followed in 1827 by \x{201c}Our Fellows\x{201d} and \x{201c}The Islanders.\x{201d}1831- 1832 Charlotte attends Miss Wooler\x{2019}s school at Roe Head.1835 Charlotte returns to Roe Head as a teacher. Emily attends as a student, but stays only three months; Anne takes her place, studying there until <<1837|18:0>>.1837 Charlotte writes to Robert Southey, the British poet lau reate, to ask his opinion of her poetry. His disheartening response implies that while Charlotte displays what Words worth calls \x{201c}faculty of verse,\x{201d} this is nothing extraordinary in a time of so many decent poets. He goes on to declare that women have no business in literature.1838 Charlotte resigns from her teaching position at Roe Head.1839 She works as a governess, first in Lothersdale and later in1841 Rawdon.1842 Charlotte and Emily travel to Brussels to study at Pension nat H\x{e9}ger, where they read, among other things, works by French and German Romantics. They stay less than a year, returning to Haworth because their aunt Elizabeth Bran well has died.1843- 1844 Charlotte spends a second year at the Pensionnat in Brus sels honing her French and German language skills. She develops a strong emotional attachment to her married employer and former teacher, Constantin H\x{e9}ger, a situa tion that may have informed the Jane Eyre love story. Char lotte returns to Haworth in January 1844.1846 In February, Charlotte sends a manuscript, Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell (the pen names of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne Bront\x{eb}, respectively), to the London publisher Aylott and Jones. The poems are published in May at the sisters\x{2019} expense; only two copies are sold. In June Charlotte completes her first novel, The Professor. By the end of the year she has begun work on Jane Eyre. 1847 While Charlotte\x{2019}s manuscript for The Professor is rejected by various publishers, her sisters\x{2019} novels\x{2014}Anne\x{2019}s Agnes Grey and Emily\x{2019}s Wuthen\x{2018}ng Heights-are accepted for pub lication by Thomas Cautley Newby. Charlotte approaches another publisher, Smith, Elder and Co., with Jane Eyre, which is published in October to instant success, over shadowing the publication in December of her sisters\x{2019} nov els and surpassing them in acclaim. All three sisters are still publishing under their \x{201c}Bell\x{201d} pen names.1848 Amid growing rumors that there is only one \x{201c}Bell\x{201d} writer, Charlotte and Anne travel to London to prove otherwise. Charlotte\x{2019}s publisher, George Smith, learns the truth of the Bront\x{eb}s\x{2019} identities but is sworn to protect their secret. In September, Branwell Bront\x{eb} dies after a sustained bout with depression, alcoholism, and drug use; in December, Emily dies of tuberculosis.1849 In May, Anne dies of tuberculosis. Charlotte\x{2019}s novel Shirley  is published by Smith, Elder and Co. In November, Charlotte travels again to London, this time as a well-known author. She meets one of her literary idols, William Mak epeace Thackeray.1850 Charlotte returns to London. In August, she travels to Win dermere, where she meets the writer Elizabeth Gaskell, with whom she becomes close friends. In December, Char lotte writes the prefaces and biographical notes for her sisters\x{2019} novels; she reveals the true identities of the \x{201c}Bells\x{201d} and works to protect the posthumous reputations of Emily and Anne, who have received some criticism for their \x{201c}coarse\x{201d} and \x{201c}nihilistic\x{201d} writings. Depressed by the loss of her siblings, Charlotte writes little fiction this year but reads Jane Austen for the first time; she disparages Aus ten\x{2019}s novels as shrewd and observant, but without senti ment.1853 Charlotte\x{2019}s novel Villette is published in January. In April, she spends a week in Manchester with Elizabeth Gaskell; in September, Gaskell visits her at Haworth.1854 In June, Charlotte marries Arthur Bell Nicholls, whom she has known since 1845, when he began work as a curate at Haworth.1855 Charlotte is happily married for a few months, but early in the year she becomes ill; she dies on March 31.1857 Elizabeth Gaskell\x{2019}s Life of Charlotte Bront\x{eb} is published, as is Charlotte\x{2019}s first novel, The Professor, though the latter\x{2019}s re lease is partly obscured by the enormous interest Gaskell\x{2019}s work receives.1928 In August, Haworth Parsonage opens to the public as the Bront\x{eb} Parsonage Museum.",
