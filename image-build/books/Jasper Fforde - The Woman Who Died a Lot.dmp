The Wing Commander\x{2019}s place in the household had been of huge benefit over the past couple of years, the last few months especially. His full name was Wing Commander Cornelius Scampton-Tappett, and he was a stereotypical wartime RAF officer. Very English, very stiff-upper-lip, and very young\x{2014}barely twenty-five, but with the demeanor of one who had seen and experienced much, and all of it harrowing. He was utterly steadfast, fearless and loyal. He sported a large walrus mustache and wore the blue uniform of an RAF officer, except when he went out, at which time he wore an Irvin flying jacket. His four greatest laments were that he no longer had a bomber of any description, nor the spiffing chaps to fly it, that he would as like as not never take tea with Vera Lynn now that she was president, and that the war wasn\x{2019}t still on. It hadn\x{2019}t been, in fact, for over fifty years, and if Scampton-Tappet\x{2019}s appearance, eternal youth and general demeanor caused a few raised eyebrows, it was because he was entirely fictional. I had bought him in a BookWorld salvage yard to pep up one of Landen\x{2019}s books. That didn\x{2019}t really work out for a number of reasons, so he now acted as family bodyguard and general assistant\x{2014}as well as conducting vital research and development work for the BookWorld.",
