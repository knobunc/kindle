Her grandfather had been an equerry to the House of Romanov, had taught the Crown Prince Aleksey to ride\x{2014}no small feat since the youngster was tragically stricken with hemophilia, and the utmost caution had needed to be exercised. That had been the crowning achievement of an otherwise undistinguished life. He\x{2019}d been a failure as an Army officer, though friends at court had ensured his advancement to colonel. All that had accomplished was the utter destruction of his regiment in the Tannenberg Forests, and his capture by the Germans\x{2014}and his survival <<past 1920|18:0>>. Upon learning that his wife had died in the revolutionary turmoil that followed the First World War, he\x{2019}d never returned to Russia\x{2014}he always called it Russia\x{2014}and eventually drifted to the United States, where he\x{2019}d settled in the suburbs of New York and remarried after establishing a small business. He\x{2019}d lived to the ripe old age of ninety-seven, outliving even a second wife twenty years his junior, and Mary Pat never forgot his rambling stories. On entering college and majoring in history, she learned better, of course. She learned that the Romanovs were hopelessly inept, their court irredeemably corrupt. But one thing she\x{2019}d never forget was the way her grandfather wept when he got to the part about how Aleksey, a brave, determined young man, and his entire family had been shot like dogs by the Bolsheviks. That one story, repeated to her a hundred times, gave Mary Pat a view of the Soviet Union which no amount of time or academic instruction or political realism could ever erase. Her feelings for the government which ruled her grandfather\x{2019}s land were completely framed by the murder of Nicholas II, his wife, and his five children.
