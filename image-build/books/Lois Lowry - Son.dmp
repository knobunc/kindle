            "Claire nodded. Confined to the Birthing Unit and its surrounding grounds for over a year now, she had not needed any kind of transportation. And she had walked here, carrying her small case of belongings, from the Birthmothers\x{2019} area to the northeast. It wasn\x{2019}t far, and she knew the route, but after so many months, everything seemed new and unfamiliar. She had passed the school and saw children at their required exercise in the recreation field. None seemed to recognize her, though they looked curiously at the young woman walking along the path at <<midday|13>>. It was unusual. Most people were at their jobs. Those who needed to be out and about were on bicycles making their way from one building to another. No one walked. A small girl with hair ribbons grinned at Claire from the exercise routine, and waved surreptitiously; Claire smiled back, remembering her own beribboned days, but an instructor called sharply to the child, who made a face and turned back to the assigned calisthenics.",

It had been a long and exhausting day. This morning she had awakened in her familiar surroundings, the place where she had lived for so many months, but by <<midday|13>> her entire life had shifted. She had not had a chance to say goodbye to her friends, the other Vessels. They would be wondering where she had gone, but would likely forget her soon. She had taken her place here, been issued a nametag, and been introduced to the other workers. They seemed pleasant enough. Some, older than Claire, had spouses and dwellings, and left at the end of the day\x{2019}s work. Others, like herself, lived here, in rooms along the corridor. <<One|9k:0>>, Heather, had been the same year as Claire; she had been a Twelve at the same ceremony. Surely she would remember Claire\x{2019}s Assignment as Birthmother. Her eyes flickered in recognition when they were introduced, but Heather said nothing. Neither did Claire. There was nothing really to say.",

At <<twelve|9e>>, when the selections were made and the future jobs assigned, the children\x{2019}s education took different paths. Some in her group\x{2014}she remembered a boy named Marcus, who excelled in school and was assigned a future as an engineer\x{2014}would continue on and learn various sciences. He had probably completed biology by now, she guessed, and would be studying higher mathematics, or astrophysics, or biochemistry, one of the subjects that was whispered about, when they were young, as incomprehensibly difficult.

She retied the cord that held it bunched at her neck, then wiped her sweaty hands carefully on the woven cloth of her garment.

Earlier, farther down, she might have recovered from a falter or stumble, might even have bound up a twisted ankle and continued on.
