            "It is most certainly in the domain of reading that my eclecticism is least pronounced, though even there the variety of my interests is most extreme. I have read history, philosophy, economics, sociology, psychology, pedagogy, psychoanalysis and, of course\x{2014}above all\x{2014}literature. While all these have always interested me, literature has been my whole life. My cat Leo was baptized thus because of Tolstoy. My previous cat was called Dongo because of Stendhal\x{2019}s Fabrice del. The first one was called Karenina because of Anna but I called her Kar\x{e9} for short, for fear of being found out. With the exception of my guilty lapse where Stendhal is concerned, my taste is most definitely partial to pre-1910 Russia, but it flatters my pride to note that the amount of world literature I have devoured is nevertheless considerable, given the fact that I am a country girl who, by ending up head concierge at <<7|9c:0>>, rue de Grenelle, has witnessed her career expectations go far beyond what she anticipated\x{2014}particularly when you think that such a destiny should surely have doomed her to the eternal worship of Barbara Cartland. I do confess to a guilty indulgence for detective stories\x{2014}but the ones I read I consider to be true works of literature. I find it especially exasperating when, from time to time, I have to drag myself away from my Connelly or Mankell in order to go and answer the door for Bernard Grelier or Sabine Palli\x{e8}res, whose concerns are hardly shared by the likes of Harry Bosch, the jazz-loving LAPD cop, and all the more so when all they have to say is:",

In the heat of the theater, on the verge of tears, happier than I had ever been, I was holding the faint warmth of his hand for the first time in months.

But that did not matter to me, I just wanted to make the most of it, of these moments stolen from the burden of illness, moments with his warm hand in mine and a shudder of pleasure going through both of us because, thank heavens, it was a film we could share and delight in equally.",

            "Every morning at breakfast Papa drinks a coffee and reads the newspaper. Several newspapers, in fact: Le Monde, Le Figaro, Lib\x{e9}ration and, once a week, L\x{2019}Express, Les \x{c9}chos, Time and Courrier International. But I can tell that the most satisfying thing for him is his first cup of coffee with Le Monde. He is absorbed by his reading for at least half an hour. In order to enjoy this half-hour, he has to get up very early, because his days are full. But every morning, even if there\x{2019}s been a nighttime session and he has only slept two hours, he gets up at <<six|9b>> and reads his paper while he drinks a strong cup of coffee. In this way Papa constructs himself, every day. I say \x{201c}constructs himself\x{201d} because I think that each time it\x{2019}s a new construction, as if everything has been reduced to ashes during the night, and he has to start from scratch. In our world, that\x{2019}s the way you live your grown-up life: you must constantly rebuild your identity as an adult, the way it\x{2019}s been put together it is wobbly, ephemeral, and fragile, it cloaks despair and, when you\x{2019}re alone in front of the mirror, it tells you the lies you need to believe. For Papa, the newspaper and the coffee are magic wands that transform him into an important man. Like a pumpkin into a coach. Of course he finds this very satisfying: I never see him as calm and relaxed as when he\x{2019}s sitting drinking his <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> coffee. But at such a price! You pay such a price when you lead a false life! When the mask is taken away, when there\x{2019}s a crisis\x{2014}and there\x{2019}s always a crisis at some point among mortals\x{2014}the truth is terrible! Look at Monsieur Arthens, the food critic on the sixth floor, who is dying. At <<noon|13>>, Maman whirled in from her shopping like a tornado and the moment she was in the hallway she shouted for everybody to hear: \x{201c}Pierre Arthens is dying!\x{201d} By everybody, of course I mean Constitution and me. Needless to say, her effort at drama was a flop. Maman, who was a bit disheveled, looked disappointed. When Papa came home this evening she jumped on him to tell him the news. Papa seemed surprised: \x{201c}His heart? What, already?\x{201d} he asked.",

Which way lies truth, in the end? In power, or in Art?

            "But I want see the positive side of things: at least he is here, and really here, and what\x{2019}s more we had a very interesting conversation yesterday. First of all, there\x{2019}s the fact that everyone in the building is absolutely crazy about Monsieur Ozu. My mother speaks of nothing else, my father listens to her for once, whereas usually his mind is elsewhere when she starts to go blah-blah-blah about the goings-on in the building; Colombe pinched my Japanese textbook and, in an unprecedented event in the annals of 7, rue de Grenelle, Madame de Broglie came to have tea chez nous. We live on the fifth floor, directly above the former Arthens apartment and lately there has been all this remodeling work going on\x{2014}a gigantic amount of remodeling! It was clear that Monsieur Ozu had decided to change everything, and everyone was drooling with desire to see what he had changed. In a world full of fossils, the slightest movement of a pebble on the slope of the cliff is nearly enough to bring on a whole series of heart attacks\x{2014}so you can imagine what happens when someone dynamites the whole mountain! In short, Madame de Broglie was dying to have a look at the fourth floor, so when she ran into Maman last week in the hall she wheedled an invitation out of her. And you know what her pretext was? It\x{2019}s really funny. Madame de Broglie is the wife of Monsieur de Broglie, the State Councilor who lives on the first floor and who joined the Council under Giscard d\x{2019}Estaing\x{2014}he\x{2019}s so conservative that he won\x{2019}t say hello to divorced people. Colombe calls him \x{201c}the old fascist\x{201d} because she\x{2019}s never read a thing about the French right wing, and Papa holds him up as a perfect example of the ossification of political ideas. His wife fits the image: posh suit, string of pearls, pinched lips and loads of grandchildren called Gr\x{e9}goire or Marie. Until now she would scarcely say hello to Maman (who is a Socialist, dyes her hair and wears pointed shoes). But last week she jumped on us as if her life depended on it. We were in the hall, we had just come back from shopping and Maman was in a very good mood because she had found an eggshell linen tablecloth for two hundred and forty euros. And I swear I thought I was having auditory hallucinations. After the customary \x{201c}Bonjour, Madame,\x{201d} Madame de Broglie said to Maman, \x{201c}I have something to ask you,\x{201d} which must have really hurt her lips. \x{201c}Please, go right ahead,\x{201d} said Maman with a smile (thanks to the tablecloth and her anti-depressants). \x{201c}Well, my little daughter-in-law, \x{c9}tienne\x{2019}s wife, is not very well these days and I think she\x{2019}ll have to consider therapy.\x{201d} \x{201c}Oh?\x{201d} said Maman with an even bigger smile. \x{201c}Yes, uh, you see, some sort of psychoanalysis.\x{201d} Madame de Broglie looked like a snail lost in the Sahara but she stood fast all the same. \x{201c}Yes, I see,\x{201d} said Maman, \x{201c}and how may I be of assistance, Madame de Broglie?\x{201d} \x{201c}Well, the thought occurred to me that you might have an idea . . . well . . . how to go about it . . . so I would have liked to discuss it with you, that\x{2019}s all.\x{201d} Maman could not get over her good fortune: an eggshell linen tablecloth, the prospect of spouting all her knowledge about psychoanalysis and Madame de Broglie dancing the dance of the seven veils\x{2014}oh yes, a good day indeed! And she couldn\x{2019}t resist because she knew perfectly well what the other woman\x{2019}s actual intention was. My mother may be a bit of a bumpkin in the intellectual subtlety category, but you still can\x{2019}t fool her completely. She knows perfectly well that the day the de Broglies are genuinely interested in psychoanalysis, the Gaullists will start singing the Internationale\x{2014}clearly, the name of her sudden success was \x{201c}the fifth-floor landing lies directly above the fourth-floor landing.\x{201d} Still, she decided to act magnanimously, to prove to Madame de Broglie how kind and open-minded socialists can be\x{2014}but not without a little hazing to begin with. \x{201c}By all means, Madame de Broglie. Would you like me to come to your place one evening to discuss it?\x{201d} she asked. The other woman looked constipated, she wasn\x{2019}t expecting such a suggestion, but she got hold of herself very quickly and, as a woman of the world, she said, \x{201c}No, no, please, I don\x{2019}t want you to have to come down, I will come up to see you.\x{201d} Maman had already had her little moment of satisfaction so she didn\x{2019}t insist. \x{201c}Well, I\x{2019}m in this afternoon,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}why don\x{2019}t you come have a cup of tea at <<around five o\x{2019}clock|6>>?\x{201d}",

The most remarkable thing is the intention that presides over her undertaking, and that is to make Ockham\x{2019}s philosophical theses into the consequence of his conception of God\x{2019}s action, by reducing his years of philosophical labor to the rank of a secondary excrescence of his theological thought. It is sidereal, as inebriating as bad wine and above all a perfect illustration of the way the university works: if you want to make a career, take a marginal, exotic text (William Ockham\x{2019}s Sum of Logic) that is relatively unexplored, abuse its literal meaning by ascribing to it an intention that the author himself had not been aware of (because, as we all know, the unknown in conceptual matters is far more powerful than any conscious design), distort that meaning to the point where it resembles an original thesis (it is the concept of the absolute power of God that is at the basis of a logical analysis, the philosophical implications of which are ignored), burn all your icons while you\x{2019}re at it (atheism, faith in Reason as opposed to the reason of faith, love of wisdom and other bagatelles dear to the hearts of socialists), devote a year of your life to this unworthy little game at the expense of a collectivity whom you drag from their beds at <<seven in the morning|9a>>, and send a courier to your research director.",

What\x{2019}s really funny is that Madame Michel told Colombe to take a hike because she rang at the loge at <<seven in the morning|9a>> to ask her to bring up the package. Madame Michel must have told her off (the loge opens at eight) because Colombe came back to the house like a fury, ranting that the concierge was an old scumbag and who did she think she was, anyway, and have you ever seen such a thing? Maman seemed to recall suddenly that yes, indeed, in an advanced, civilized country, you don\x{2019}t go disturbing concierges at any old hour of the day or night (and she would have done better to remember that before Colombe went down there), but that didn\x{2019}t calm my sister down, and she went on bleating that just because she\x{2019}d goofed up on the time didn\x{2019}t mean this non-entity had the right to slam the door in her face.
