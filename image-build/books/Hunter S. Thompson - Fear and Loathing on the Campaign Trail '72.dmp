There was an alerting reaction; obvious apprehension and fear, and attempts to escape\x{2026} In human studies, at a dose of 300 mg. given orally, the subject experiences visions, changes in perception of the environment and delusions or alterations of thinking. Visual imagery became more vivid, with animals often appearing. Ibogaine produces a state of drowsiness in which the subject does not wish to move, open his eyes, or be aware of his environment.

            "HST: McGovern places a large part of the blame for his defeat on the press. He did before the election, and even now he\x{2019}s still doing it. The Eagleton affair turned him brutally against the press. He thought they were crucifying him and leaving Nixon alone\x{2026} and he was right, on one level. But what he ignored was the fact that, first, he was out in the open and committing these blunders that the press couldn\x{2019}t ignore\x{2026} while Nixon was not out in the open and committing no blunders\x{2026} or at least none that the press could pin on him. The Watergate thing came about as close as anything and the Washington Post worked that one about as heavily as any newspaper could. But McGovern throughout the campaign blamed the press for taking advantage of his\x{2026} of what he called his \x{201c}open campaign\x{201d}\x{2026} as if\x{2026} he opened up his house to guests and they came in and pissed all over the floor and ripped off his silver and\x{2026} you know\x{2026} raped the children\x{2026} that sort of thing\x{2026} But I think one of the best examples of the way the press people felt that night showed up in these few pieces of paper I found in the typewriter <<about 5 in the morning|5>> in the press room. I was just sort of wandering around\x{2026} There was an odd sense of not wanting to go to sleep\x{2026} because that would have been giving up\x{2026} In a scene like that you get a weird feeling that maybe if you stay up a little longer, maybe something good might happen\x{2026} but Colorado was the only bright spot in the country that night\x{2026}",

            "1. As it turned out, another rabid Redskins fan that year was Richard Nixon, despite his political differences with the management. His unsolicited advice to Coach George Allen resulted in a disastrous interception ending the Redskins\x{2019} last hopes for a come-from-behind victory in the 1971 playoffs. They lost\x{2014}the final score was <<24 to 20|10a:0>>. Two weeks later Nixon announced he was backing Miami against Dallas in the Super Bowl. This time he went so far as to send in a play which once again backfired disastrously. Miami lost <<24 to 3|10a:0>>. The Nixon jinx continued to plague the Redskins again in the 1973 Super Bowl, despite quarterback Bill Kilmer\x{2019}s widely-quoted statement that this time he would just as soon do without the President\x{2019}s tactical advice. The Redskins were three-point favorites against the Dolphins this time around, but with Nixon on their side they got blown out of the stadium and wound up on the sick end of a deceptively one-sided <<14 to 7|10a:0>> defeat.",

            "1. Both the New Hampshire and Florida primaries were scheduled for early March so sometime in late February I left McGovern up in New Hampshire and went down to Florida to check on Muskie and Lindsay. Lindsay had just made a strong showing in the Arizona delegate-selection caucuses, running even with Muskie and beating McGovern <<almost 2 to 1|10>>. All he needed in Florida was 20 percent of the Democratic vote\x{2014}which seemed entirely possible at the time. A Lindsay \x{201c}win\x{201d} in Florida would have changed the race entirely. There were twelve candidates in the primary and in February the wizards were saying that no one of them could hope to poll more than 25 or 30 percent of the vote. Muskie was still a front-runner and George Wallace had only recently decided to enter the race as a Democrat, rather than as an American Independent. McGovern was running out of money and had already decided to cut his losses in Florida and go for broke in Wisconsin several weeks later. So if Lindsay had made a strong showing in Florida\x{2014}even running second or close third to Muskie\x{2014}he would probably have crippled McGovern\x{2019}s image as a candidate of the Democratic Left. When I arrived in Miami, the consensus of the local pols was that the Democratic primary would probably come down to a relatively close race between Muskie and Lindsay, with Humphrey and Wallace splitting the right-wing vote and McGovern grappling for the booby prize with Shirley Chisholm.",

It was sometime <<after midnight|13>> in a ratty hotel room and my memory of the conversation is hazy, due to massive ingestion of booze, fatback, and forty cc\x{2019}s of adrenochrome. In any case the Bobby Kennedy voice tapes were never used again. By mid-May, however, when it was obvious that Hubert Humphrey was the only remaining obstacle between George and the nomination, there were other Kennedy voices supporting McGovern. The whole clan was actively campaigning for him and even Teddy was saying that he would do everything he could for George except run on the same ticket with him.",
