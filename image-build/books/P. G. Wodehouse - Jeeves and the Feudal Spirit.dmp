along these lines is always the aftermath of a brisk dust-up with
the heart-throb. During the taxi drive she remained about as
silent as the tomb, and from the way her foot kept tapping on the
floor of the vehicle I knew that she was thinking of Stilton,
whether or not in agony of spirit I was, of course, unable to say, but
I thought it probable. Following her into the joint, I was on the
whole optimistic. It seemed to me that with any luck I ought to be
