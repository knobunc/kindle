            'A call to Scar House always came as rather a jolt because it meant that at least two hours had been removed from the working day. In all but the driest weather it was safer to leave the car at Mr. Broom\'s and make the journey on foot. One February night at <<about eight o\'clock|6>> I was splashing my way along the track, feeling the mud sucking at my wellingtons; it was to see a horse with colic and my pockets were stuffed with the things I might need - arecoline, phials of morphia, a bottle of Paraphyroxia.
