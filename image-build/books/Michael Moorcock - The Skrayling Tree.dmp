         hag, he said. Hadn\x{2019}t I read the guide? The Old Woman was the local English name for the unpredictable bore, a twisting, vicious
         current which ran between the dozens of little islands in the Sound and could sometimes turn into a dangerous whirlpool. The
         French called her Le Chaudron Noir, the black cauldron. Small whaling ships had been dragged down in the nineteenth century,
         and only a year or <<two before three|10>> vacationing schoolgirls in a canoe had disappeared into the maelstrom. Neither they nor
         their canoe had ever been recovered.",

         the crater of an enormous volcano. There were no evident signs of a harbor entrance, only the still lagoon within. It seemed
