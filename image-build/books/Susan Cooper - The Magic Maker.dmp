The way he trained our voices . . . it wasn\x{2019}t the usual hootie-flootie sound that you hear in cathedrals in England, it had a ring to it. And he was an outstanding organist, a great technician, with all the repertoire including the then far-out music of Charles Tournamine, who\x{2019}d been a pupil of C\x{e9}sar Franck. All the young organists about town used to turn up at our <<Evensong|13>> services, to hear Mitchell and his boy choir.",

Since Ken had a tendency to sleepwalk, Jack was charged with looking after him. \x{201c}He\x{2019}d go toward the window, and I\x{2019}d go and put a chair in his way.\x{201d} Ken too had a beautiful voice, but he had not been given his brother\x{2019}s sense that his voice was his identity. He was much less restrained than Jack in expressing his longing to be back at 39 Garden Place. Esther Langstaff kept every letter that her children ever wrote her, and after they had grown up she chose the letters she felt should be preserved, typed them all out, and had them compiled in seven leather-bound books.

The year-round pressures of Revels and all the rest of his singing and teaching life multiplied. Nudged by his family, his friends, and his board, he began shifting responsibilities, and in the course of the 1980s George Emlen became Music Director, Paddy Swanson became Associate Artistic Director, and Gayle Rich became General Manager.
