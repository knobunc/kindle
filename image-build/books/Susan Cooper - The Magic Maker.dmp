            "I wasn\x{2019}t lonely, missing my parents \x{2014} well, probably at first, but they kept you so busy. It was all rehearsals, going, going, going. Mitchell was a wonderful teacher. The way he trained our voices . . . it wasn\x{2019}t the usual hootie-flootie sound that you hear in cathedrals in England, it had a ring to it. And he was an outstanding organist, a great technician, with all the repertoire including the then far-out music of Charles Tournamine, who\x{2019}d been a pupil of C\x{e9}sar Franck. All the young organists about town used to turn up at our <<Evensong|13>> services, to hear Mitchell and his boy choir.",

They\x{2019}d pay me twenty dollars, or even fifty, and that was a lot then.\x{201d} His repertoire included all the classic pieces then sung by boy sopranos, like \x{201c}O for the Wings of a Dove,\x{201d} but it also went way beyond. David Blair McCloskey, the singer-teacher who was John Fitzgerald Kennedy\x{2019}s voice coach in his 1960 campaign, once reminisced about singing the baritone part in a performance of the Brahms Requiem in which young Jack Langstaff sang soprano.",

            "Two years after Jack became a chorister, his brother Kennedy joined him. Since Ken had a tendency to sleepwalk, Jack was charged with looking after him. \x{201c}He\x{2019}d go toward the window, and I\x{2019}d go and put a chair in his way.\x{201d} Ken too had a beautiful voice, but he had not been given his brother\x{2019}s sense that his voice was his identity. He was much less restrained than Jack in expressing his longing to be back at 39 Garden Place. Esther Langstaff kept every letter that her children ever wrote her, and after they had grown up she chose the letters she felt should be preserved, typed them all out, and had them compiled in seven leather-bound books. The two elder boys\x{2019} letters from choir school show a telling contrast.
Here is Jack at <<twelve|9c:1>>, writing home on Mother\x{2019}s Day 1933.
