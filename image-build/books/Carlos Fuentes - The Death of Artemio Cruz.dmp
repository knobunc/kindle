            "Yesterday you did what you do every day. You don't know if it's worthwhile remembering it. You only want to remember, lying back there in the twilight of your bedroom, what's going to happen: you don't want to foresee what has already happened. In your twilight, your eyes see ahead; they don't know how to guess the past. Yes; yesterday you will fly from Hermosillo, yesterday, April 9, 1959, on the Compa\x{f1}\x{ed}a Mexicana de Aviaci\x{f3}n shuttle, which will depart from the capital of Sonora, where it will be hot as hell, at <<9:55 a.m.|2a>>, and will reach Mexico City exactly on time at <<4:30 p.m.|2a>> From your seat on the four-motor plane, you will see a flat, gray city, a belt of adobe and tin roofs. The hostess will offer you a Chiclet wrapped in cellophane\x{2014}you will remember that in particular because she will be (she has to be, don't think everything in the future tense from now on) a very pretty girl and you will always have a good eye for such things even if your age condemns you to imagine rather than do (you're using words incorrectly: of course, you will never feel condemned to that, even if you can only imagine it). The bright sign NO SMOKING, FASTEN SEAT BELTS will go on just when the plane, entering the Valley of Mexico, abruptly descends, as if it had lost the power to stay aloft in the thin air; then it suddenly leans to the right, and packages, jackets, suitcases will fall and a collective shout will ring out, cut off by a low sob, and the flames will sputter, until the fourth motor on the right wing stops, and everyone goes on shouting and only you stay calm, unmoved, chewing your gum and watching the legs of the hostess, who will run up and down the aisle calming the passengers. The internal fire extinguisher will work and the plane will land with no difficulty, but no one will have realized that only you, an old man of seventy-one, maintained his composure. You will feel proud of yourself, without showing it. You will think that you have done so many cowardly things that it's easy for you to be brave. You will smile and say to yourself no, no, it isn't a paradox: it's the truth and perhaps even a general truth. You will have made the trip to Sonora by car\x{2014}a 1959 Volvo, license plate DF 712\x{2014}because some government officials were misbehaving badly and you would have to go all that way just to make sure those people remain loyal, the people you bought\x{2014}bought, that's right, you will not fool yourself with words from your own annual speeches: I'll convince them, I'll persuade them. No, you'll buy them\x{2014}and then they'll impose tariffs (another ugly word) on the truckers who carry fish on the Sonora-Sinaloa-Mexico City route. You will give the inspectors ten percent, and because of those middlemen, the fish will be expensive when they reach the city, and your personal profit will be twenty times larger than the original value of the fish. You will try to remember all this, and you will carry out your desire even if all this seems a fit subject for an editorial in your newspaper and you think that, after all, you're wasting your time remembering it. But you will insist, you will go through with it. You will insist. You would like to remember other things, but above all you would like to forget the condition you're in. You will excuse yourself: You're not at home. You will be. They will carry you in a faint to your house, you will collapse in your office; the doctor will come and say that it will take a couple of hours to make the diagnosis. Other doctors will come. They will know nothing and understand nothing. They will say difficult words. And you will want to imagine yourself. Like an empty, wrinkled wineskin. Your chin will tremble, your breath will be bad, your armpits will smell, everything between your legs will stink. You will be left there, without a bath, without a shave: you will be a storehouse of sweat, irritated nerves, and unconscious physiological functions. But you will insist on remembering what will happen yesterday. You will go from the airport to your office and you will cross a city impregnated with mustard gas because the police will have just broken up a demonstration in Caballito Plaza. You will consult with your editor in chief about the headlines, the editorials, the cartoons, and you will feel satisfied. You will be visited by your U.S. partner, you will point out to him the dangers of these so-called clean-up-the-union movements. Later your administrator, Padilla, will come to your office and tell you that the Indians are agitating and you, through Padilla, will tell the commissioner for communal lands to clamp down on them; after all, that's what you pay him for. You will do a lot of work yesterday morning. The representative of that Latin American benefactor will visit you and you will get the subsidy for your newspaper increased. You will summon your gossip columnist and order her to insert a libel in her column about the Couto who's fighting you in the Sonora business. You will do so many things! And then you will sit down with Padilla to count your assets. That will amuse you a great deal. An entire wall of your office is covered with the diagram of the vast network of businesses you control: the newspaper, the real-estate investments\x{2014}Mexico City, Puebla, Guadalajara, Monterrey, Culiac\x{e1}n, Hermosillo, Guaymas, Acapulco\x{2014}the sulphur domes in J\x{e1}ltipan, the mines in Hidalgo, the logging concessions in Tarahumara, your stock in the chain of hotels, the pipe factory, the fish business, financing of financing, the net of stock operations, the legal representation of U.S. companies, the administration of the railroad loans, the advisory posts in fiduciary institutions, the shares in foreign corporations\x{2014}dyes, steel, detergents\x{2014}and one fact that does not appear on the diagram: \$15 million deposited in London, New York, and Zurich. You will light a cigarette, despite the doctor's warnings, and you will recite to Padilla the steps that led to this wealth. Short-term loans at high interest to the peasants in the state of Puebla at the end of the Revolution; acquisition of property near the city of Puebla, foreseeing its growth, thanks to the friendly intervention of whichever President happened to be in power at the time; property for subdivisions in Mexico City; acquisition of the metropolitan daily; purchase of mining stocks and the creation of joint Mexican-U.S. corporations in which you were the front man, to comply with the letter of the law; the man on whom U.S. investors depended; intermediary between Chicago, New York, and the Mexican government; manipulation of the bond market to raise or lower prices, sell or buy according to your wish or need; a cozy, tight relationship with President Alem\x{e1}n; acquisition of communal properties stripped from the peasants to create new subdivisions in the cities of the interior; logging concessions. Yes\x{2014}you will sigh as you ask Padilla for a match\x{2014}twenty years of confidence, social peace, class collaboration; twenty years of progress after L\x{e1}zaro C\x{e1}rdenas's demagoguery; twenty years of protection for the company's interests; twenty years of submissive union leaders and broken strikes. And then you will raise your hands to your stomach, and your head, with its unruly gray hair, will land with a hollow thud on the glass tabletop, and once again, now from up close, you will see that reflection of your sick twin, while all noise pours out of your head, in laughter, and the sweat of all those people envelops you, the flesh of all those people suffocates you, makes you lose consciousness. The reflected twin will join the other, which is you, the old man seventy-one years of age who will lie unconscious between the desk chair and the big metal desk, and you will be here but not know which facts will get into your biography and which will be hushed up, hidden. You will not know. They are vulgar facts and you will not be the first or only person to possess such a service record. You will have had a good time. You will have remembered that. But you will recall other things, other days, you will have to remember them, too. They are days that, far back, recent, pushed toward oblivion, etched in memory\x{2014}meeting and rejection, fleeting love, freedom, anger, failure, will\x{2014}were and will be something more than the names you might give them: days in which your destiny will pursue you like a bloodhound, will find you, will charge you dearly, will incarnate you with words and acts, complex, opaque, adipose matter, woven forever with the other, the impalpable, the substance of your spirit absorbed by matter: a love of cool quinces, the ambition of growing fingernails, the tedium of progressive baldness, the melancholy of sun and desert, the abulia of dirty dishes, the distraction of tropical rivers, the fear of sabers and gunpowder, the loss of clean sheets, the youth of black horses, the old age of an abandoned beach, the discovery of the envelope and the foreign stamp, the repugnance toward incense, the reaction to nicotine, the pain of red earth, the tenderness of the afternoon patio, the spirit of all objects, the matter of all souls: the sundering of your memory, which separates the two halves; the solder of life that reunites them once again, that dissolves them, that pursues them, that finds them. The fruit has two halves: today they will be united once again. You will remember the half you left behind: destiny will find you: you will yawn: no need to remember: you will yawn: things and their sentiments have frayed, have fallen in pieces along the road: there, behind, there was a garden: if you could return to it, if you could find it again at the end. You will yawn: you haven't moved: you will yawn: you are on the garden's earth, but the pale branches deny fruit, the dusty riverbed denies water. You will yawn: the days will be different, the same, distant current. Soon you will forget need, urgency, surprise. You will yawn: you will open your eyes and see the women there, next to you, with that false solicitude. You will whisper their names: Catalina, Teresa. They will not be able to dissimulate that feeling of being fooled and violated, their irritated disapproval, which will perforce transform itself now into the appearance of concern, affection, grief. The mask of solicitude will be the first sign of that transition your sickness, your appearance, decency, the gaze of another, inherited habit, will impose on them. You will yawn: you will close your eyes: you will yawn: you, Artemio Cruz, him: you will grow in your days with your eyes closed.",

            "Confess it: you imposed yourself so they would let you in as their equal. You've rarely felt happier, because from the time you began to be what you are, from the time you learned to appreciate the feel of fine cloth, the taste of fine liquors, the scent of fine lotions, all those things that for the past few years have been your isolated and only pleasure, from that time on you turned your eyes northward and lived with the regret that a geographical error kept you from being part of them in everything. You admire their efficiency, their comforts, their hygiene, their power, their will, and you look around you and the incompetence, the misery, the filth, the languor, the nakedness of this poor country that has nothing, all seem intolerable to you. And what pains you even more is knowing that no matter how much you try, you cannot be like them, you can only be a copy, an approximation, because after all, say it now: was your vision of things, in your worst or your best moments, ever as simplistic as theirs? Never. Never have you been able to think in black and white, good guys versus bad guys, God or the Devil: admit that always, even when it seemed just the opposite, you've found the germ, the reflection of the white in the black. Your own cruelty, when you've been cruel, hasn't it always been tinged with a certain tenderness? You know that all extremes contain their opposites: cruelty and tenderness, cowardice and bravery; life, death. In some way\x{2014}almost unconsciously, because of who you are, because of where you've come from, because of what you've lived through\x{2014}you know this, and for that reason you can never resemble them who don't know these things. Does that bother you? Of course it does, it's uncomfortable, annoying. It's much easier to say: this is good and that is evil. Evil. You could never say, \"That is evil.\" Perhaps because we are more forsaken, we do not want to lose that intermediate, ambiguous zone between light and shadow, that zone where we can find forgiveness. Where you may be able to find it. Isn't everyone, in a single moment of his life, capable of embodying\x{2014}as you do\x{2014}good and evil at the same time, letting himself be simultaneously led by two mysterious, different-colored threads that unwind from the same spool, so that the white thread ascends and the black one descends and, despite everything, the two come together again in his very fingers? You won't want to think about all that. You will detest me for reminding you of it. You would like to be like them, and now, an old man, you almost achieve that goal. Almost. Only almost. You yourself will block oblivion; your bravery will be the twin of your cowardice, your hatred will have been born from your love, all your life will have contained and promised your death. Therefore, you will not have been either good or evil, generous or selfish, faithful or a traitor. You will let the others affirm your good qualities and your faults; but you yourself, how will you deny that each of your affirmations will be negated, that each of your negations will be affirmed? No one will know about it, except perhaps you. That your existence will be woven of all the threads on the loom, like the lives of all men. That you will have neither too few nor too many chances to make of your life what you wish it to be. And if you become one thing and not another, it will be because, despite it all, you will have to choose. Your choices will not negate the rest of your possible life, all that you will leave behind each time you choose: they will only hone it, hone it to the point that today your choice and your destiny will be one and the same. The coin will no longer have two sides: your desire will be identical with your destiny. Will you die? It won't be the first time. You will have lived so much dead life, so many moments of mere gesticulation. When Catalina puts her ear to the door that separates you and listens to your movements; when you, on the other side of the door, move without knowing you're being listened to, without knowing that someone lives dependent on the sounds and silences of your life behind the door, who will live in that separation? When both of you realize one single word would be enough and yet you keep silent, who will live in that silence? No, you won't want to remember that. You'd like to recall something else; that name, that face the passage of time will wear away. But you will know that if you remember these things, you will save yourself, you will save yourself too easily. You will first remember the things that condemn you, and having been saved there, you will find out that the other, what you think will save you, will be your real condemnation: remembering what you want. You will remember Catalina when she was young, when you met her, and you will compare her with the faded woman of today. You will remember and remember why. You will incarnate what she, and all of them, thought then. You won't know it. You will have to incarnate it. You will never listen to what others say. You will have to live what they say. You will shut your eyes: you will shut them. You will not smell that incense. You will not listen to that weeping. You will remember other things, other days. Days that will reach you at night\x{2014}your night of eyes shut. You will only recognize them by their voice, never by sight. You will have to give credit to the night and accept it without seeing it, believe it without recognizing it, as if it were the God of all your days: the night. Now you must be thinking that all you'll have to do to have it is to close your eyes. You will smile, despite the pain that reasserts itself. You will try to stretch your legs a little. Someone will touch your hand, but you will not respond to that\x{2014}what? caress? care? anguish? calculated move? Because you will have created the night with your closed eyes, and from the depth of that ocean of ink, a stone boat\x{2014}which the hot and sleepy <<midday|13>> sun will cheer in vain\x{2014}will sail toward you: thick blackened walls raised to protect the Church from Indian attacks and also to link the religious conquest to the military conquest. The rough soldiers, Spanish, the troops of Queen Isabella the Catholic, advance toward your closed eyes with the swelling din of their fifes and drums, and in sunlight you will traverse the wide esplanade with a stone cross at its center and with exterior chapels, the prolongation of the native religion, theatrical and open-air, at its corners. At the top of the church built at the end of the esplanade, the vaults made of tezontle stone will rest on forgotten Moorish scimitars, sign of yet one more bloodline imposed on that of the conquistadors. You will advance toward the portal of the early, Castilian, baroque, already rich in columns wound with profuse vines and aquiline keystones; the portal of the Conquest, severe and playful, with one foot in the old, dead world and the other in the new world that didn't begin here but on the other side of the sea: the new world arrived with them, with a redoubt of austere walls to protect their sensual, happy, greedy hearts.",

            "He bought a paper from a newsboy and tried to read it as he drove, but he could only glance at the headlines, which spoke about the execution of those who had made an attempt on the life of the other leader, the candidate. He remembered him in the great moments, the campaign against Villa, during his presidency, when all of them swore their loyalty to him, and he looked at that photo of Father Pro, with his arms wide open to receive the volley of bullets. Passing by him in the street were the white roofs of new automobiles; on the sidewalk, the short skirts and cloche hats of the women, and the balloon trousers of today's lounge lizards, and the shoeshine boys sitting on the ground around the fountain with its ornamental frogs. But it wasn't the city that ran before his glassy, fixed eyes, but the word. He tested it and saw it in the rapid glances from the sidewalks that met his own; he saw it in the attitudes, the winks, the fleeting gestures, in the bent-over men, in obscene finger signals. He felt dangerously alive, clutching the steering wheel, dizzied by all the faces, gestures, finger-penises on the street, between two swings of the pendulum. He had to do it because, inevitably, the guys who got screwed today would end up screwing him tomorrow. A reflection off the windshield blinded him and he shaded his eyes with his hand: he'd always known how to choose the biggest motherfucker, the emerging leader against the fading leader. The immense square of the Z\x{f3}calo opened before him with its stands set in the arcades, and the Cathedral bells sounded the deep bronze of <<two o'clock in the afternoon|6>>. He showed his identification card to the guard at the entrance to the Moneda. The crystalline winter of the plateau outlined the ecclesiastical silhouette of old Mexico, and groups of students, now taking exams, walked down Argentina and Guatemala Streets.

The waves barely whispered, and the voices of the few swimmers did not disturb the solitary encounter of the rising sun, the tranquil ocean, and the sand brushed smooth by the tide. He spread the curtains wide and took a deep breath of the clean air. Three small children were walking along the beach with their pails, picking up the night\'s treasures: starfish, shells, driftwood.

            'Behind him he could hear the swift hooves of Villa\'s cavalry as they detached themselves from the column to take him. They were almost on him when the Yaqui\'s broken legs emerged from beneath the animal\'s body. Villa\'s men tore the cartridge belts from his chest.
It was <<seven o\'clock in the morning|6>>.
By <<four in the afternoon|5>>, when they entered the Perales prison, he wouldn\'t have any memory of the forced march that Colonel Zagal imposed on his men and the two prisoners to negotiate, in nine hours, the difficult mountain passes and descend into the Chihuahua village. His head was so riddled with pain that he could barely follow the route they took. Seemingly, the harshest. The simplest for someone like Zagal, who had accompanied Pancho Villa on his first raids and had spent twenty years traveling these mountains, memorizing hiding places, passes, canyons, and shortcuts. The mushroom shape of Zagal\'s hat hid half his face, but his long, clenched teeth were always visible in a smile, framed by a black beard and mustache. Zagal smiled when Cruz was mounted, with great effort, on a horse, and the Yaqui\'s broken body, face down, was tied on the croup of the animal. He smiled when Tobias stretched out an arm to hold on to the captain\'s belt. He smiled when the column moved forward, entering a dark mouth, a natural tunnel, which he and the rest of Carranza\'s men hadn\'t know about, a shortcut that reduced to an hour what would have been a four-hour gallop on the open road. But he was only half aware of all this. He knew that both sides shot captured officers on the spot, so he wondered why Colonel Zagal was leading him to an unknown destiny.',

            'By <<four in the afternoon|5>>, when they entered the Perales prison, he wouldn\'t have any memory of the forced march that Colonel Zagal imposed on his men and the two prisoners to negotiate, in nine hours, the difficult mountain passes and descend into the Chihuahua village. His head was so riddled with pain that he could barely follow the route they took. Seemingly, the harshest. The simplest for someone like Zagal, who had accompanied Pancho Villa on his first raids and had spent twenty years traveling these mountains, memorizing hiding places, passes, canyons, and shortcuts. The mushroom shape of Zagal\'s hat hid half his face, but his long, clenched teeth were always visible in a smile, framed by a black beard and mustache. Zagal smiled when Cruz was mounted, with great effort, on a horse, and the Yaqui\'s broken body, face down, was tied on the croup of the animal. He smiled when Tobias stretched out an arm to hold on to the captain\'s belt. He smiled when the column moved forward, entering a dark mouth, a natural tunnel, which he and the rest of Carranza\'s men hadn\'t know about, a shortcut that reduced to an hour what would have been a four-hour gallop on the open road. But he was only half aware of all this. He knew that both sides shot captured officers on the spot, so he wondered why Colonel Zagal was leading him to an unknown destiny.',

            "From the depth of your memory you will cry out; you will lower your head as if to place it next to the horse's ear and spur him on with words. You will feel\x{2014}and your son will probably feel as well\x{2014}that fierce, steaming breath, that sweat, those tense nerves, those eyes glassy from strain. Your voices will be lost in the thunder of the hooves, and he will shout: \"You've never been able to beat the mare, Papa!\" \"And who taught you to ride, eh?\" \"I'm telling you, you'll never be able to beat the mare!\" \"Let's just see!\" \"You should tell me all about it, Lorenzo, just as you have until now, just like that\x{2026}just as you have until now\x{2026}You shouldn't be ashamed to tell your mother; no, no, never be embarrassed with me; I'm your best friend, maybe your only friend\x{2026}\" She will repeat it that morning, lying in bed, that spring morning, and she will repeat all the conversations she'd prepared since her son was a child, draining you out of his life, taking care of him all day long, refusing to hire a nanny, packing your daughter, as soon as she turned six, off to Catholic boarding school, so that all her time would be for Lorenzo, so that Lorenzo would grow accustomed to that comfortable life devoid of options. The speed will bring tears to your eyes; you will squeeze your legs over your horse's flanks, you will throw yourself violently against its mane, but the black mare will keep three lengths ahead. You will straighten up, tired; you will slow down. Seeing the mare and the young rider pulling away will seem more beautiful to you, the sound of the hooves lost in the chorus of macaws, in the bleating that flows down the hillsides. You will have to squint so as not to lose sight of Lorenzo's mare, which will now leave the path to trot toward the woods, returning to the riverbank. No: without difficult options, without the alarming need to choose, Catalina will say to herself, thinking that in the beginning you helped her with your indifference, unintentionally, because you belonged to another world, the world of work and force she came to know when you took Don Gamaliel's lands away from him, allowing the boy at the beginning to join the other world of bedrooms in semidarkness: a natural slope, a climate of almost nonexistent exclusions and inclusions created by her between her sacred muttering and her silent dissimulation. Lorenzo's mare will detour off the path to trot once more toward the woods, returning to the riverbank. The boy's raised arm will point east, where the sun came up, toward a lagoon separated from the bay by a sandbar in the river. You will close your eyes when you again feel the hot steam rising toward your face along with the cool shadow that falls on your head. You will let your horse follow the road on its own, rocking you on the moist saddle. Behind your closed eyelids, the shape of the sun and the form of the shadow will scatter in invisible depths, and the blue phantom of the young, strong figure will stand out. You must have awakened that morning, as you did every day, with expectant joy. \"I've always turned the other cheek,\" Catalina will repeat, the child at her side. \"Always, I have always accepted everything. If it weren't for you\"\x{2014}and you will love those astonished, questioning eyes that allow themselves to be led. \"One day, I'll tell you everything\x{2026}\" You will not be mistaken in bringing Lorenzo to Cocuya from the time he is twelve; you will repeat it: not mistaken. For him alone will you have bought this land, rebuilt the hacienda, left him on it, the child-master, responsible for the harvests, open to the life of horses and hunting, swimming and fishing. You will see him from a distance, on horseback, and you will say to yourself that he is the image of your own youth, slim and strong, dark, his green eyes sunken into high cheekbones. You will breathe in the muddy rot of the riverbank. \"One day, I'll tell you everything\x{2026}Your father; your father, Lorenzo\x{2026}Lorenzo: do you really love Our Lord? Do you believe all the things I've taught you? Do you know that the Church is the body of God on earth and that priests are the ministers of the Lord\x{2026}? Do you believe\x{2026}?\" Lorenzo will place his hand on your shoulder. Each will see the other reflected in his eyes, you will smile. You will grab Lorenzo around the neck; the boy will pretend to punch you in the stomach; you will mess his hair, laughing; you will embrace in a mock but rough, hard-fought, panting struggle until you both collapse on the grass, laughing, out of breath, laughing\x{2026}\"My God, why am I asking you this? I have no right, really, I have no right\x{2026}I don't know about holy men\x{2026}about real martyrs\x{2026}Do you think it could be approved?\x{2026}I don't know why I'm asking you\x{2026}\" The horses will go home, as tired as you two, and now you will walk, leading them by their bridles, along the sand bridge that leads to the sea, the open sea, Lorenzo, Artemio, to the open sea where Lorenzo will run, agile, toward the waves breaking, around his waist, toward the green sea of the tropics which will soak his trousers, the sea guarded by the low flight of sea gulls, the sea that only pokes its tired tongue onto the beach, the sea that you will impulsively take in the palm of your hand and raise to your lips: the sea that tastes like bitter beer, smells like melon, custard apple, guava, quince, strawberry. The fishermen will drag their heavy nets toward the sand, you two will join them, shuck oysters with them, eat crabs and lobsters with them, and Catalina, alone, will try to close her eyes and sleep, will await the return of the boy she hasn't seen now for two years, since he turned fifteen, and Lorenzo, as he cracks the pink shell of the lobsters and thanks the fishermen for the slice of lemon they pass him, will ask you if you ever think about what's on the other side of the sea, because he thinks all lands resemble each other and that only the sea is different. You will tell him there are islands. Lorenzo will say that in the sea so many things happen that we would have to be bigger, more complete, in order to live in the sea. Lying back in the sand, listening to the fisherman's out-of-tune guitar, you would like to explain to him that years ago, forty or so, something shattered here so that something else could begin, or something, even newer, would never begin. Under the misty sun of dawn, under the blazing, molten sun of dawn, under the blazing, molten sun of <<midday|13>>, on the black paths and alongside this sea, this one, now tranquil, dense, and green, there existed for you a ghost, not real but true, that could\x{2026}It wasn't that\x{2014}the very truth of those lost possibilities\x{2014}which upset you so much, what brought you back to Cocuya hand in hand with Lorenzo, but something\x{2014}you will say it with your eyes closed, with the taste of shellfish in your mouth, with the Caribbean music of Veracruz, the son, in your ears, lost in the immensity of this afternoon\x{2014}more difficult to express, to think by yourself; and even though you would like to tell your son, you will not dare to. He has to understand on his own. You hear him understand, as he settles on his haunches, facing the open sea, his ten fingers spread out, under the overcast, suddenly dark sky: \"A ship leaves in ten days. I've already booked passage.\" The sky and Lorenzo's hand, which turns to receive the first drops of rain, as if he were begging for them: \"Wouldn't you have done the same thing, Papa? You didn't stay home. Do I believe in a cause? I don't know. You brought me here, you taught me all these things. It's as if I had relieved your life, don't you understand?\" \"Yes.\" \"Now there is this battle line. I think it's the only one left. I'm going.\"\x{2026}Oh, that pain, that jab, oh, how you'd like to get up, run, forget the pain by walking it off, working, shouting, giving orders. And they won't let you, they will take you by the arms, they will force you to stay still, they will force you, physically, to keep on remembering, and you will not want to, you do want to, oh, you don't. You will only have dreamed your days: you don't want to know about one day that is more yours than any other day because it will be the only one on which someone will live for you, the only one you can remember in the name of someone; a short day, terror, a day of white poplars, Artemio, your day too, your life too\x{2026}oh\x{2026}",

For the past few days he\'d been wanting to suggest something to him. Even though his boots were worn, they were still holding up; all Miguel had was an old pair of sandals he\'d wrapped with rags and bound up with string. He wanted to say they could take turns with the boots: he one day, Miguel the next. But he didn\'t have the nerve. The wrinkles in that face said he shouldn\'t. Now they blew on their fingers, because they knew only too well what it meant to spend a night on an open roof. Then, from the far end of the street came a soldier, one of ours, a Republican running toward us as if he\'d popped out of one of the shell holes. He waved his arms and finally fell, face down. Behind him came more Republican soldiers, boots slapping the pockmarked streets. The artillery salvo, which had seemed so far off, suddenly was closer, and from the street below, one of the soldiers shouted: "Weapons, please, give us some guns!"',

As they asked him to strike new poses, he insisted on straightening his hair and running his fingers along the two heavy bags that hung off the sides of his nose and gradually disappeared into his neck. His high cheekbones still had the old hardness, though even they were crisscrossed by a network of wrinkles that began at his eyelids, which seemed to sag more and more every day, as if to protect his eyes, which expressed a combination of amusement and bitterness, their greenish irises hidden in the folds of loose skin.",

The time of paralyzed branches, when even the river seemed not to flow. The naked boy stretched out under the solitary palm tree and felt the heat of the sun\'s rays as they cast the shadow of the trunk and the crown of leaves farther and farther. The sun began its final race; even so, its oblique rays seemed to rise, illuminating his entire body, pore by pore. First his feet, when he leaned back against the naked pedestal. Then his spread legs, his dormant sex, his flat stomach, his chest hardened by the water, his long neck, and his square chin, where the light was opening two deep clefts, like two bows aimed at his hard cheekbones, which framed the clarity of his eyes, lost that afternoon in a deep and tranquil siesta. He was sleeping, and nearby, Lunero, stretched out, face down, was drumming with his fingers on the black frying pan. A rhythm was taking hold of him. The seeming languor of his body at rest was actually the contemplative tension of his dancing arm as it drew concentrated tones out of the utensil. He began to murmur, as he did every afternoon, having recovered the memory of a rhythm that grew ever more rapid, the memory of childhood song, of a life he no longer lived, when his ancestors crowned themselves, around the silk-cotton tree, with caps decorated with bells and rubbed their arms with liquor: a man would be seated in a chair with his head covered by a white cloth, and everyone drank the mixture of corn and bitter orange down to its black sugar lees. Children were taught that they shouldn\'t whistle at night:',

            "Don't reproach me for anything. I'm your son, too\x{2026}My blood is the same as Atanasio's\x{2026}so why, that night\x{2026}? All I was told was: \"Sergeant Robaina, from the old Santa Anna troops, has found what you've been looking for for so long, Colonel Menchaca's body, in the Campeche cemetery. Another soldier, who saw where they buried your father with no marker, told the sergeant when he was ordered to the port garrison. And the sergeant, outwitting the commanders, stole Colonel Menchaca's remains at night. Now he's being transferred to Jalisco and is passing through here and wants to give you the remains. I'll wait for you and your brother tonight, <<after eleven|9e>>, inthe clearing about a mile from town, the place where they had the gallows for hanging rebel Indians.\" Clever, wasn't it? Atanasio believed him, as I did; his eyes filled with tears, he never questioned the message. Why did I ever come to Cocuya that season? Because I was starting to run out of money in Mexico City, and Atanasio never refused me anything. He even preferred that I be far away, he wanted to be the only Menchaca in the area, your only guardian. The red moon that shines in the hottest time of the year was up when we got there. There was Sergeant Robaina. We remembered him from when we were kids. He was leaning against his big horse, his teeth glowing like white rice, just like his white mustache. We remembered him from when we were kids. He'd always accompanied General Santa Anna and was famous as a horse breaker; he'd always laughed like that, as if he were part of a huge joke. And there, on the big horse's back, was the filthy sack we were hoping for. Atanasio hugged him, and the sergeant laughed as he'd never laughed, he even whistled with laughter, and that's when the four men came out of the thicket, glowing in the moonlight, because they were all wearing white. \"All souls in heaven!\" shouted the sergeant in his jolly voice. \"Souls in heaven right here for those who aren't satisfied with having lost a man and go around wanting to get him back!\" And then his face changed, and he went for Atanasio, too. No one took any account of me, I swear. They just walked forward, looking at my brother, as if I didn't exist. I don't even know how I managed to get on my horse and break through that damned circle of four men walking with machetes in hand, while Atanasio shouted to me in a hoarse but calm voice: \"Go home, brother, and remember what you take with you.\" And I felt the butt bouncing off my knee, but I could no longer see the four men surrounding Atanasio, how they first slashed open his legs and then cut him to pieces, there under the moon, so it could take place in silence. Where could I go for help on the haciendawhen I knew he was dead and gone, and besides, he'd been killed by the men who worked for the new headman in the district, who sooner or later had to kill Atanasio to be headman for certain? And from then on, who was going to oppose him? After that, I didn't want to know about the new fence, put up the next day by the man who had defeated us on our own land. What for? The workers went over to him without a word; he couldn't be worse than Atanasio. And as if to warn me to keep my mouth shut, a detachment of federal troops spent a week standing guard over the new boundaries. And for some reason or other, a month later, General Porfirio D\x{ed}az visited the new big house in the area. And they didn't even bother to omit their little joke. Along with Atanasio's mutilated body, they gave me some cow bones, a huge skull with horns\x{2014}which is what the sergeant had in his sack. All I did was hang that shotgun over the door of the house, who knows? maybe as a kind of tribute to poor Atanasio. Really, that night\x{2026}I didn't even realize that I had it on my saddle, even though the butt kept hitting me on the knee on that long gallop, Mama, I swear, it was so long\x{2026}",
