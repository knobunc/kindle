            "Each night for a week I have lingered on the wild flags of the waterfront, palaces crowding to the left, brittle light crackling over the harbor in the warm autumn. TEI goes strangely. Tonight when I turned back into the great trapezoid of the Piazza, fog hid the tops of the red flagpoles. I sat on the base of one nearest the tower and made notes on Lobey\x{2019}s hungers. Later I left the decaying gold and indigo of the Basilica and wandered through the back alleys of the city till <<well after midnight|13>>. Once I stopped on a bridge to watch the small canal drift through the close walls beneath the night-lamps and clotheslines. At a sudden shrieking I whirled: half a dozen wailing cats hurled themselves about my feet and fled after a brown rat. Chills snarled the nerves along my vertebrae. I looked back at the water: six flowers\x{2014}roses\x{2014}floated from beneath the bridge, crawling over the oil. I watched them till a motorboat puttering on some larger waterway nearby sent water slapping the foundations. I made my way over the small bridges to the Grand Canal and caught the Vaporetto back to Ferovia. It turned windy as we floated beneath the black wood arch of the Ponte Academia; I was trying to assimilate the flowers, the vicious animals, with Lobey\x{2019}s adventure\x{2014}each applies, but as yet I don\x{2019}t quite know how. Orion straddled the water. Lights from the shore shook in the canal as we passed beneath the dripping stones of the Rialto.",

            "\x{201c}Let\x{2019}s talk about mythology, Lobey. Or let\x{2019}s you listen. We\x{2019}ve had quite a time assuming the rationale of this world. The irrational presents just as much of a problem. You remember the legend of the Beatles? You remember the Beatle Ringo left his love Maureen even though she treated him tender. He was the one Beatle who did not sing, so the earliest forms of the legend go. After a hard day\x{2019}s night he and the rest of the Beatles were torn apart by screaming girls, and he and the other Beatles returned, finally at <<one|9c:0>>, with the great rock and the great roll.\x{201d} I put my head in La Dire\x{2019}s lap. She went on. \x{201c}Well, that myth is a version of a much older story that is not so well known. There are no 45\x{2019}s or 33\x{2019}s from the time of this older story. There are only a few written versions, and reading is rapidly losing its interest for the young. In the older story Ringo was called Orpheus. He too was torn apart by screaming girls. But the details are different. He lost his love\x{2014}in this version Eurydice\x{2014}and she went straight to the great rock and the great roll, where Orpheus had to go to get her back. He went singing, for in this version Orpheus was the greatest singer, instead of the silent one. In myths things always turn into their opposites as one version supersedes the next.\x{201d}",

\x{201c}And you know what a City is.\x{201d} He motioned around at the sand. \x{201c}Well a village grows bigger and bigger till it becomes a town; then the town grows bigger and bigger till it becomes a City. But this was a ghost town. That means it was from a very old time, from the old people of the planet. It had stopped growing. The buildings had all broken open, sewers caved in, dead leaves fled up the streets, around the stubs of street- lamp bases; an abandoned power station, rats, snakes, department stores\x{2014}these are the things that are in a town. Also the lowest, dirtiest outcasts of a dozen species who are vicious with a viciousness beyond what intelligence can conceive. Because if there were a brain behind it, they would all be luxuriant, decadent lords of evil over the whole world instead of wallowing in the junk heap of a ghost town.
