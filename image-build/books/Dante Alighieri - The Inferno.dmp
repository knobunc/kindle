            "The lyric poetry Dante produced between the early 1280s and the mid 1290s holds much greater importance in his poetic development. These ninety or so poems of undoubted attribution represent a kind of artistic workshop for the young aspiring lyric poet. The poems display a variety of metrical forms: sonnets, sestinas, ballate (dance songs with repeating refrains), and canzoni, odelike \x{201c}songs,\x{201d} as the name implies, consisting of a number of stanzas and a shorter envoy. Dante considered the canzone to be the noblest form of poetry. This kind of poetry was popular among the major groups of lyric poets Dante admired, imitated, and sometimes criticized: the Proven\x{e7}al troubadours, such as Arnaut Daniel and Bertran de Born; the Sicilian School of poetry that flourished from <<around 1230|18:0>> to 1250, the members of which included Pier della Vigna and Giacomo da Lentini, the probable inventor of the sonnet; the Tuscan school led by Guit tone d\x{2018}Arezzo; the Bolognese group of poets led by Guido Guin izzelli; and what came to be known as the dolce stil novo poets (the \x{201c}sweet new style\x{201d}), a group of Tuscans including not only Bonagiunta da Lucca, Cino da Pistoia, and Guido Calvacanti, but also Dante himself. Dante places a number of these individuals in The Divine Comedy as testimony to his own literary development and to his argument that poetry represents one of humanity\x{2019}s most noble callings.",

The city of Ravenna on the Adriatic coast was then ruled by Guido Vecchio (d. 1310), head of the powerful Polenta family, who controlled the city from the thirteenth century to 1441, when it was taken over by Venice. Guido, whose coat of arms bore the insignia of an eagle, was the father of Francesca da Rimini (see canto V). Cervia, a town a few miles below Ravenna, was valuable because of the revenue its salt generated. In 11. 43-44, Dante is referring to the town of Forl\x{ec} (\x{201c}the city which one made the long resistance\x{201d}): Guido da Montefeltro defended the city against a French attack in 1282, during which time the French suffered heavy losses (\x{201c}of the French a sanguinary heap\x{201d}); the city then came under the rule of the Or deleffi family, whose coat of arms contained a green lion (the \x{201c}Green Paws\x{201d} of 1. 45). \x{201c}Verrucchio\x{2019}s ancient Mastiff\x{201d} (1. 46) refers to Malatesta da Verrucchio (d. 1312), the lord of Rimini who captured the city from the Ghibellines in 1295. (One of his sons was the husband of the aforementioned Francesca da Rimini of canto V.) The \x{201c}new\x{201d} mastiff is Malatestino, who succeeded his father as lord of Rimini in 1312 and ruled until <<1317|9c:0>>. Dante refers to the men as dogs, or mastiffs, because of their cruelty, and he describes them as fashioning \x{201c}wimbles,\x{201d} or augurs, of their teeth, the better to bite into their beleaguered subjects (1. 48). The \x{201c}bad disposal of Montagna\x{201d} (1. 47) refers to the fact that in 1295, after Malatesta captured the leader of the Ghibellines of Rimini, Montagna de\x{2019} Parcitati, he had him murdered by his son Malatestino. The towns of Faenza on the Lamone River and Imola on the Santerno River were governed by a ruler Dante calls the \x{201c}Lioncel of the white lair\x{201d} (1. 50); the so-called \x{201c}little lion\x{201d} was Maghinardo Pagani da Susinna, whose coat of arms bore a blue lion on a white field. Dante describes him as changing sides, since he was Ghibelline in Romagna but supported the Guelphs in Tuscany. The city \x{201c}of which the Savio bathes the flank\x{201d} (1. 52) is Cesena, which is located between Forl\x{ec} and Rimini; it \x{201c}lives between tyranny and a free state,\x{201d} because it was not ruled by a tyrant like the other cities of the Romagna, and its affairs were controlled by a cousin of Guido da Montefeltro named Galasso da Montefeltro.",

Longfellow is one of the few translators of Dante to have rendered Dante\x{2019}s term for this principle of punishment, contrapasso, into a precise English term: A counterpoise is any force or influence that balances or equally counteracts another force or influence. Therefore, in almost all cases in Hell, the punishment the sinners receive fits their crimes. The punishment is counterpoised to the sin in some fashion, often an extremely ingenious one.

There she witnessed the slaughters of her daughter, Polyxena, on the grave of Achilles (1. 17) and her son, Polydorus, killed by the king of Thrace, Polymnestor, and left unburied on the Thracian beach (1. 18). As a result, Hecuba became insane (11. <<20-21|5a:0>>) but was still able to kill Polymnestor. See The Metamorphoses, Book XIII, for the Ovidian source.",
