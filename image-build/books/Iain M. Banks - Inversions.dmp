            "The Doctor shook her hand free of Nolieti\x{2019}s and calmly put her finger to her mouth, spreading the brown paste along her top gum. \x{2018}The taste is bitter-sweet,\x{2019} she said in the same tone she uses when she is teaching me. \x{2018}The effects last between <<two|90>> and <<three bells|15>> and usually have no side effects, though in a body seriously weakened and in shock, fits are likely and death is a remote possibility.\x{2019} She licked her finger. \x{2018}Children in particular suffer severe side effects with almost no restorative function and it is never recommended for them. The gel is made from the berries of a biennial plant which grows on isolated peninsulae on islands in the very north of Drezen. It is quite precious, and more usually applied in a solution, in which form, too, it is most stable and long-lasting. I have used it to treat the King on occasion and he regards it as one of my more efficacious prescriptions. There is not much left now and I would have preferred not to waste it on either those who are going to die anyway, or on myself, but you did insist. I am sure the King will not mind.\x{2019} (I have to report, Master, that as far as I am aware, the Doctor has never used this particular gel - of which she has several jars - on the King, and I am not sure she had ever used it to treat any patient.) The Doctor closed her mouth and I could see her wipe her tongue round her top gum. Then she smiled. \x{2018}Are you sure you won\x{2019}t try some?\x{2019}",
