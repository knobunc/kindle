            "It occurs in other languages, among them German, where the word is Neger. It was used by Nazi propagandists to induce fear or loathing (jazz was Negermusik), and in his speeches Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels raised the specter of a defeated Germany being overrun by betrunken Neger (\x{201c}drunken niggers\x{201d}). Germans have come to see Neger as an objectionable word (often replaced by Farbige, colored, or Schwarze, black), which is why Negerkuss (\x{201c}nigger kiss\x{201d}), the chocolate-covered marshmallow treat beloved by German children, was not long ago renamed Schokokuss (\x{201c}chocolate kiss\x{201d}). The French word n\x{e8}gre is not so insulting but has belittling implications\x{2014}for example, n\x{e8}gre is also slang for ghostwriter. Defying the formality of the Belgian king Baudouin and other luminaries, in the celebration of the Congo\x{2019}s independence in 1960 in Leopoldville, Patrice Lumumba, the newly elected prime minister, angrily used the word, saying, \x{201c}We have known sarcasm and insult, endured blows morning, <<noon|13>> and night, because we were \x{2018}niggers\x{2019} [n\x{e8}gres].

Something about the wood paneling, the quality of the curtains, the closeness of the room, the sense of being in the deep countryside holding a glass of wine on a hot day\x{2014}all of it was like being in old Russia.
