looked after the advertising and so on; and I arrived with good old Billson
this afternoon. We\x{2019}re giving him twenty quid, and the other fellow\x{2019}s getting
another twenty; and all the rest of the cash Izzy and I split on a fifty-fifty
basis. Affluence, laddie! That\x{2019}s what it means. Affluence beyond the dreams of
a Monte Cristo. Owing to this Jones fellow the place is crowded, and every
sportsman for miles around will be there to-morrow at <<five|9b>> bob a head, cheaper
seats two-and-six, and standing-room one shilling. Add lemonade and fried fish
privileges, and you have a proposition almost without parallel in the annals
of commerce. I couldn\x{2019}t be more on velvet if they gave me a sack and a shovel
and let me loose in the Mint.\x{201d}",

was wearing that blue dress when I first met her, Gorky. And a hat with
thingummies. It was on the Underground. I gave her my seat, and, as I hung over
her, suspended by a strap, I fell in love absolutely in a flash. I give you my
honest word, laddie, I fell in love with her for all eternity between Sloane
Square and South Kensington stations. She got out at South Kensington. So did
I. I followed her to the house, rang the bell, got the maid to show me in, and,
once I was in, put up a yarn about being misdirected and coming to the wrong
address and all that sort of thing. I think they thought I was looney or trying
to sell life insurance or something, but I didn\x{2019}t mind that. A few days later I
called, and after that I hung about, keeping an eye on their movements, met \x{2018}em
everywhere they went, and bowed and passed a word and generally made my
presence felt, and\x{2014}well, to cut a long story short, old horse, we\x{2019}re engaged. I
happened to find out that Millie was in the habit of taking the dog for a run
in Kensington Gardens every morning at <<eleven|9c:1>>, and after that things began to
move. It took a bit of doing, of course, getting up so early, but I was on the
spot every day and we talked and bunged sticks for the dog, and\x{2014}well, as I say,
we\x{2019}re engaged. She is the most amazing, wonderful girl, laddie, that you ever
encountered in your life.\x{201d}",

            "For a
man like myself, who finds at least eight hours of sleep essential if that
schoolgirl complexion is to be preserved, it was unfortunate that Leonard the
parrot should have proved to be a bird of high-strung temperament, easily
upset. The experiences which he had undergone since leaving home had, I was to
discover, jarred his nervous system. He was reasonably tranquil during the
hours preceding bedtime, and had started his beauty-sleep before I myself
turned in; but at <<two in the morning|9a>> something in the nature of a nightmare
must have attacked him, for I was wrenched from slumber by the sound of a
hoarse soliloquy in what I took to be some native dialect. This lasted without
a break till <<two-fifteen|5b>>, when he made a noise like a steam-riveter for some
moments; after which, apparently soothed, he fell asleep again. I dropped off
at <<about three|9c:1>>, and at <<three-thirty|5b>> was awakened by the strains of a deep-sea
chanty. From then on our periods of sleep never seemed to coincide. It was a
wearing night, and before I went out after breakfast I left imperative
instructions with Bowles for Ukridge, on arrival, to be informed that, if
anything went wrong with his plans for removing my guest that day, the
mortality statistics among parrots would take an up-curve. Returning to my
rooms in the evening, I was pleased to see that this manifesto had been taken
to heart. The hat-box was gone, and <<about six o\x{2019}clock|6>> Ukridge appeared, so
beaming and effervescent that I understood what had happened before he spoke. \x{201c}Corky,
my boy,\x{201d} he said, vehemently, \x{201c}this is the maddest, merriest day of all the
glad New Year, and you can quote me as saying so!\x{201d}",
