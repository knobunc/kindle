            "He crossed Smith Straits and the wooded, deep-folded ranges of north Central Island, and came down by <<noon|13>> in Centralville. It looked like a city, at least after three months in the woods; there were real streets, real buildings, it had been there since the Colony began four years ago. You didn\x{2019}t see what a flimsy little frontier-town it really was, until you looked south of it a half-mile and saw glittering above the stumplands and the concrete pads a single golden tower, taller than anything in Centralville. The ship wasn\x{2019}t a big one but it looked so big, here. And it was only a launch, a lander, a ship\x{2019}s boat; the NAFAL ship of the line, Shackleton, was half a million kilos up, in orbit. The launch was just a hint, just a fingertip of the hugeness, the power, the golden precision and grandeur of the star-bridging technology of Earth.",

Outside the Lodge a hunting-party went out, children chirped, women talked in voices like running water. A dryer voice called Coro Mena from the door. He crawled out into the evening sunlight. His sister stood outside, sniffing the aromatic wind with pleasure, but looking stern all the same. \x{201c}Has the stranger waked up, Coro?\x{201d}",

            "CAPTAIN Raj Lyubov had a headache. It began softly in the muscles of his right shoulder, and mounted crescendo to a smashing drumbeat over his right ear. The speech centers are in the left cerebral cortex, he thought, but he couldn\x{2019}t have said it; couldn\x{2019}t speak, or read, or sleep, or think. Cortex, vortex. Migraine headache, margarine breadache, ow, ow, ow. Of course he had been cured of migraine once at college and again during his obligatory Army Prophylactic Psychotherapy Sessions, but he had brought along some ergotamine pills when he left Earth, just in case. He had taken two, and a superhyperduper-analgesic, and a tranquilizer, and a digestive pill to counteract the caffeine which counteracted the ergotamine, but the awl still bored out from within, just over his right ear, to the beat of the big bass drum. Awl, drill, ill, pill, oh God. Lord deliver us. Liver sausage. What would the Athsheans do for a migraine? They wouldn\x{2019}t have one, they would have daydreamed the tensions away a week before they got them. Try it, try daydreaming. Begin as Selver taught you. Although knowing nothing of electricity he could not really grasp the principle of the EEG, as soon as he heard about alpha waves and when they appear he had said, \x{201c}Oh yes, you mean this,\x{201d} and there appeared the unmistakable alpha-squiggles on the graph recording what went on inside his small green head; and he had taught Lyubov how to turn on and off the alpha-rhythms in one half-hour lesson. There really was nothing to it. But not now, the world is too much with us, ow, ow, ow above the right ear I always hear Time\x{2019}s winged chariot hurrying near, for the Athsheans had burned Smith Camp day before yesterday and killed two hundred men. Two hundred and seven to be precise. Every man alive except the Captain. No wonder pills couldn\x{2019}t get at the center of his migraine, for it was on an island two hundred miles away two days ago. Over the hills and far away. Ashes, ashes, all fall down. And among the ashes, all his knowledge of the High Intelligence Life Forms of World 41. Dust, rubbish, a mess of false data and fake hypotheses. <<Nearly five|9:1>> E-years here, and he had believed the Athsheans to be incapable of killing men, his kind or their kind. He had written long papers to explain how and why they couldn\x{2019}t kill men. All wrong. Dead wrong.",

            "He had come in late afternoon, which was like \x{2018}arriving in a Terran city just after dawn. Athsheans did sleep\x{2014}the colonists\x{2019} opinion, as often, ignored observable fact\x{2014}but their physiological low was between <<noon|13>> and <<four p.m.|5>>, whereas with Terrans it is usually between <<two|20>> and <<five a.m.|5>>; and they had a double-peak cycle of high temperature and high activity, coming in the two twilights, dawn and evening. Most adults slept five or six hours in 24, in several catnaps; and adept men slept as little as two hours in 24; so, if one discounted both their naps and their dreaming-states as \x{2018}laziness,\x{2019} one might say they never slept. It was much easier to say that than to understand what they actually did do.\x{2014}At this point, in Tuntar, things were just beginning to stir again after the late-day slump.",

            "\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t feel so good,\x{201d} Davidson said. He said it again. Then he stopped saying it, for there was nobody to say it to. Then he realized he hadn\x{2019}t said it anyway. He felt groggy. Must have hit his head. Aabi wasn\x{2019}t there. Where was he? This was the hopper. It was all slewed around, but he was still in his seat. It was so dark, like being blind. He felt around, and so found Post, inert, still doubled up, crammed in between the front seat and the control panel. The hopper trembled whenever Davidson moved, and he figured out at last that it wasn\x{2019}t on the ground but wedged in between trees, stuck like a kite. His head was feeling better, and he wanted more and more to get out of the black, tilted-over cabin. He squirmed over into the pilot\x{2019}s seat and got his legs out, hung by his hands, and could not feel ground, only branches scraping his dangling legs. Finally he let go, not knowing how far he\x{2019}d fall, but he had to get out of that cabin. It was only a few feet down. It jolted his head, but he felt better standing up. If only it wasn\x{2019}t so dark, so black. He had a torch in his belt, he always carried <<one at night|5>> around camp. But it wasn\x{2019}t there. That was funny. It must have fallen out. He\x{2019}d better get back into the hopper and get it. Maybe Aabi had taken it. Aabi had intentionally crashed the hopper, taken Davidson\x{2019}s torch, and made a break for it. The slimy little bastard, he was like all the rest of them. The air was black and full of moisture, and you couldn\x{2019}t tell where to put your feet, it was all roots and bushes and tangles. There were noises all around, water dripping, rustling, tiny noises, little things sneaking around in the darkness. He\x{2019}d better get back up into the hopper, get his torch. But he couldn\x{2019}t see how to climb back up. The bottom edge of the doorway was just out of reach of his fingers.",
