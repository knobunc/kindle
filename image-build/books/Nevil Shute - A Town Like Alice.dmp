He said that his brother-in-law, Arthur Paget, had been killed in a motor car accident in Malaya and so he wanted to redraft his will to make a trust in favour of his sister Jean and her two children. I am sorry to say that I was so ignorant of this client that I did not even know he was unmarried and had no issue of his own. He finished up by saying that he was too unwell to travel down to London, and he suggested that perhaps a junior member of the firm might be sent up to see him and arrange the matter.',

Provisionally, I have arranged the funeral for the day after tomorrow, at <<two o\'clock|6>>, at St Enoch\'s cemetery. The only relations that I know of live, or used to live, in Southampton. The sister, Mrs Arthur Paget, was living in 1941 at No 17 St Ronans Road, Bassett-that\'s just by Southampton somewhere. There were some other Paget relations in the district, the parents of Arthur Paget. Mrs Arthur Paget-her Christian name was Jean-yes, she was the deceased\'s sister. She had two children, Donald and Jean Paget, but they were both in Malaya in 1941. God knows what became of them. I wouldn\'t waste much time just now looking for them, but would you get Harris to do what he can to find some of these Southampton Pagets and tell them about the funeral?

There was no proper organization for a twenty-four hour listening watch at the Cairns Ambulance; in an emergency such as this everybody had to muscle in and lend a hand. She had been on duty the previous day from <<eight in the morning|5>> till <<midnight|13>>, and from <<eight o\'clock that morning|6>> till then; Mr Barnes had taken the night watch and was preparing to do so again. She thought, ruefully, that she had missed Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall; the show would be half over. But there was still one more night, and with any luck this flap would be over and she could see it tomorrow. She went to telephone to Mr Barnes.',

            'Mr Barnes telephoned to Mr Smythe of Australian National Airways, and Mr Smythe telephoned to his reserve pilot, Captain Jimmie Cope. Mr Cope said, "Hell, I hope it\'s better in the morning than it was today. We\'d never have got over the Tableland today. Better say take off at <<six|9c:0>>, I suppose. I\'ll be along at the hangar then."',

            'He held a little conference with Sergeant Haines and Sister Douglas and Al Burns beside the truck. "I\'ll have a crack at flying him back here," he said. "If it\'s no better this afternoon he\'ll have to spend the night in hospital here. I can\'t fly him to Cairns in this weather. It\'ll probably be better by tomorrow." They gave him a freehand pencil map which the sergeant had prepared for him, showing him the creeks and Midhurst homestead, and the new bore, and the probable position of the airstrip, and he took off again. That was at <<about eleven o\'clock|6>>. Following this map he found the place without much difficulty. It was clear where they meant him to land, because trees had been felled upon a line he was to come in on, and bushes had been cleared for a short distance on what seemed to be a grassy meadow. He could see about ten men working or standing looking up at him; he could see a utility parked with a tent over it. He circled round under the low cloud, considering the risks. The runway that they had prepared was pitifully short, even for a Dragon. Time was also short, however; the man had had his compound fracture three days now. Sepsis and gangrene and all sorts of things would be setting in; he must not delay. He bit his lip and lined the Dragon up with the runway for a trial approach.',

            'He turned to the orderly behind him as he circled low under the clouds, keeping the airstrip in sight. "Got a pencil and paper? Write this." He thought for a moment. "Sorry I can\'t make it. Strip must be about a hundred yards longer, or a hundred and fifty if you can manage it. I will come back at <<four o\'clock this afternoon|6>>." They put this in a message bag with coloured streamers flying from it, and flew over, and dropped it on the middle of the strip.',

            'At <<four o\'clock|6>> he was back over the airstrip at the top end of Midhurst; the rain had stopped and he was able to approach at about eight hundred feet. He circled once and had a good look; they had made the strip much longer and he would have no difficulty now. He came in and touched down at the near end; the Dragon bounced on the uneven ground and landed again, and rolled bumping and swaying to a standstill.',
