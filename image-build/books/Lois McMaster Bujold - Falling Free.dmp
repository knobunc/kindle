            '"And that," Leo
overrode him, "is precisely why Silver is in charge. Your
capture of a cargo Jumper is the signal for a quaddie uprising here
on the Habitat. And that uprising is their death warrant. When
GalacTech discovers it cannot control the quaddies, it will almost
certainly be frightened into an attempt to violently exterminate
them. Escape must be assured before we tip our hand. The ship you
must catch is out that way." Leo pointed. "I can depend on
Silver to remember that. You," Leo smiled thinly, "are no
worse than anyone else." Ti subsided at that, although not
happily. Silver, Zara, Siggy, a particularly husky quaddie from the
pusher crews named Jon, and Ti. Five, crammed into a ship meant for a
crew of two and not designed for overnight use in any case. Leo
sighed. The Superjumpers carried a pilot and an engineer. <<Five-to-two|10a:0>>
wasn\'t altogether bad odds, but Leo wished he could have loaded them
even more overwhelmingly in the quaddies\' favor.',
