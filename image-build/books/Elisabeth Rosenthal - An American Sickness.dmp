            "President Obama supported the idea in his 2016 budget, prompting a firestorm of protest from groups like the American Hospital Association, of course. The resulting congressional Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 included a pale compromise, prohibiting hospitals from billing facility fees for services performed in a doctor\x{2019}s office that had not been considered part of a hospital before that date. This was a tiny step toward solving a much bigger problem. All the doctors\x{2019} offices that had already been rebranded as hospitals were allowed to continue charging facility fees; also, the law applies only to Medicare patients, and it doesn\x{2019}t go into effect until <<2017|9c:0>>. What\x{2019}s more, it is still perfectly legal for simple tests and procedures, such as echocardiograms or the insertion of an IUD, to be performed at hospitals, just to pad a patient\x{2019}s medical bill with hefty facility fees.",

If I have a sore knee and want to see an in-network orthopedist next Tuesday between <<1|90>> and <<5 p.m.|5>>, I should be able to go to my plan\x{2019}s online directory, which would show me which in-network orthopedists within a five-mile radius were available, because it would be connected to its providers\x{2019} scheduling books. I could schedule my appointment, know how much I had to pay, and even prepay the co-payment, rather than calling three receptionists to see which doctor is available, checking coverage with insurers, filling out the same form every time I visit a new provider, and having a mailbox filled with paper statements for months afterward.",
