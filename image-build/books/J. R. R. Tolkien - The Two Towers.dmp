the chestnut: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. Some recalled the ash: tall straight
grey Ents with many-fingered hands and long legs; some the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, the rowan, and the
linden. But when the Ents all gathered round Treebeard, bowing their heads slightly, murmuring in their slow musical voices,
