With the banging of the door behind Phil, the door also banged on Miss Pettigrew\x{2019}s exhilarating feeling of adventure, romance and joy. She felt suddenly tired, inefficient and nervous again. She had only been allowed the privilege of seeing romance for a short time, but it was not really her portion in life. Now all the practical, terrifying worries of her daily life poured back into her mind. She was now the applicant for a post and Miss LaFosse her possible employer. She would never learn who Phil was, or what his last name was, or why Miss LaFosse so urgently wanted him away when she so obviously enjoyed his kisses.",

Miss Lafosse disengaged herself from the newcomer\x{2019}s arms and Miss Pettigrew saw him clearly for the first time. Graceful, lithe, beautifully poised body. Dark, vivid looks: a perfection of feature and colouring rare in a man. Brilliant, piercing eyes of a dark bluish-purple colour: a beautiful, cruel mouth, above which a small black moustache gave him a look of sophistication and a subtle air of degeneracy that had its own appeal. Something predatory in his expression: something fascinating and inescapable in his personality.",

Immediately the door closed behind Nick tension relaxed. It was like coming out of a fog into clear, bright air. Miss Pettigrew drew a long breath. Her legs felt wobbly. Reaction had set in. She felt weak, unstrung, thoroughly upset. She found a chair and sat down. Suddenly she burst out crying.",

They lunched at home, and Miss Pettigrew prepared it. She discovered the remains of a cold chicken in the pantry. Cold chicken, to her, was the height of luxury. Miss LaFosse opened a bottle of Liebfraumilch and made her drink some. Miss Pettigrew sipped it slowly with stern caution, and beyond making her feel, if possible, a little more reckless, it had no ill effects.",

\x{201c}OH!\x{201d} gasped Miss Pettigrew. She was nearly knocked over by the flying passage of a female body belonging to a lady of startling attractions. Miss Pettigrew gaped, blinked and devoured them avidly. The lady was young, slim, arresting. Her face was of a deep, creamy pallor, devoid of any colour except the wicked red bow of her mouth. Hair, like black lacquer, parted in the middle, was coiled in an elaborate roll at the nape of her neck. A tiny hat was perched at an acute angle at the side of her head. Black brows curved with an unnatural slant above eyes of a surprisingly vivid blue for a brunette. Long, black lashes, as thick and curled as the most famous of film star\x{2019}s, held Miss Pettigrew\x{2019}s fascinated attention. Vivid green ear-rings dangled from tiny, shell-like ears snug against her head. As she moved, a delicate perfume, subtly alluring, beguiled Miss Pettigrew\x{2019}s senses. Her clothes\x{2026}Miss Pettigrew gave it up. Her experience had not fitted her to describe Parisian confections. The lady had flung open her fur coat and tossed her gloves on the couch. Obviously here to stay. Miss Pettigrew turned and shut the door.",

Miss Pettigrew was extremely happy. She felt so delightfully light and airy she was almost sure she could make the passage to the door by simply floating through the air. She discerned a small portion of liquor still in the bottom of her glass. She drank it down. Miss LaFosse was gazing at Miss Pettigrew from the other side of the room. For the past quarter of an hour all her interest had been centred in Miss Pettigrew\x{2019}s corner of the room. She had noted the length of Tony\x{2019}s stay. She had noted Miss Dubarry join them. Her curiosity had reached fever heat. Then an acquaintance had blocked her vision, held her in conversation, and when next she had been free to gaze, Tony was gone; Miss Dubarry was gone.",
