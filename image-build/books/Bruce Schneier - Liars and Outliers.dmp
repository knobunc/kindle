            '(3) It\'s commonly asserted that countries with authoritarian governments have low crime rates: that in these countries, both good and bad defectors are stamped out. And if we want to live in a free country where dissent is tolerated, we necessarily need to tolerate some level of crime. It\'s a good story, and it may be true, but there\'s not much in the way of supporting data. The problems are twofold. <<One|9k:0>>: in authoritarian regimes, government-generated data pertaining to crime rates is vulnerable to distortion and manipulation, especially since the regime is motivated to flatter and defend itself. And two: crime statistics provided by authoritarian regimes are likely to be skewed by the absence of figures for crimes condoned or carried out by the state or against marginalized groups. So while rates of reported street crime like muggings, burglaries, and murders are often said to be lower under authoritarian regimes such as the former USSR, former East Germany, and Nazi Germany than in democratic countries, it might be that stamping out dissent doesn\'t actually make the streets safer. Mussolini didn\'t make the trains run on time; he just made it illegal to complain about them.',

            'Since the mid-1980s, a growing docket of complaints, criminal prosecutions, and civil suits in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere has revealed that, since at least 1950, Roman Catholic bishops knowingly transferred thousands of priests accused of child molestation into unsuspecting parishes and dioceses, rather than diminish the ranks and reputation of the priesthood and expose the church to scandal. By <<2011|9n:0>>, allegations had been made against nearly 5,000 U.S. priests, and over 15,000 U.S. residents had testified to being victimized. (Estimates of the actual number of victims range as high as 280,000.) In a 2002 tally, approximately two-thirds of sitting U.S. bishops were alleged to have either retained accused priests in their then-current positions or moved them to new assignments. This was in keeping with the Vatican\'s exhortations to investigate cases of sexual abuse in secret, so they would remain bound only by canon law.',

Hundreds of people in Haiti, Panama, and Nigeria died of kidney failure in the 1990s and 2000s after consuming medicinal syrups manufactured with toxic diethylene glycol\x{2014}an industrial chemical used to make plastics. Economically minded manufacturers had secretly substituted the toxic chemical for the more expensive, but nontoxic, glycerin.

Just as moral and reputational pressures can fail against corporations, so can institutional pressures. We've discussed some of the ways they fail against individuals in Chapter 9: interpretation, loopholes, lack of enforcement. These failures can be more severe in corporations, because corporations can afford more and better lawyers to figure out how to evade laws. And law enforcement is much more consumer-friendly when it comes to dealing with individual defectors. If someone steals your wallet, you know how to call the police. If a corporation breaks the law, whom do you call?",

Scope. Sandwich-like things, such as hot dogs, bagels, wraps, and muffins.

All this makes it much more difficult to enforce the basic societal dilemmas of a market economy.

But by tying the two products together, perhaps selling a sandwich and chips together, or offering a once-a-week chip subscription with the purchase of a sandwich subscription, he is able to play the two societal dilemmas off each other, taking advantage of both.",

Even with the September 11 attacks included in the count, the number of Americans killed by international terrorism since the late 1960s (which is when the State Department began counting) is about the same as the number of Americans killed over the same period by lightning, accident-causing deer, or severe allergic reaction to peanuts.',
