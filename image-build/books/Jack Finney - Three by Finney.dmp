Harry pulled in beside Lew\x{2019}s VW, turned off lights and engine, and they sat staring back at the foreshortened length of the bridge, its distant half brilliant with motionless headlights, the back of the huge white screen in the north tower going dark. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve reported accidents, breakdowns, tieups of every kind,\x{201d} the radio voice shouted delightedly, \x{201c}but never anything like this! Down on the bridge below me people are standing between their cars, they\x{2019}re up on both walks, they\x{2019}re sitting on car hoods. A group of young people are sitting cross-legged on the roof of their van, and they\x{2019}re applauding! There\x{2019}s a highway patrol car down there, its dome light revolving, but it can\x{2019}t move, it\x{2019}s locked in, can\x{2019}t move! Here at the toll plaza and beyond everything is bl\x{2014}. There\x{2019}s a report card up on the screen! I mean it! A tremendous yellow report card forty feet high!\x{201d}",
