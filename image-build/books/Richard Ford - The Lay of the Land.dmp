My recent health concerns\x{2014}sixty radioactive iodine seeds encased in titanium BBs and smart-bombed into my prostate at the Mayo Clinic\x{2014}all seemed to be going well (systems up and running, locked and loaded). My Thanksgiving plans for a semi-family at-home occasion hadn\x{2019}t yet started to make me fitful (stress is bad for the iodine seeds\x{2019} half-life).

Wade, I think, just likes big explosions and the controlled devastation that follows. In his young life, he was an engineer, and watching things blow up is his way of coping with being now in his eighties, and of fortifying his belief that the past crumbles and that staring loss in the face is the main requirement for living out our allotment (this is as spiritual as engineers get).

            "Neptune\x{2019}s Daily Catch Bistro, I already know from our local Shore weekly, is serving its twenty-dollar turkey \x{2019}n trimmings buffet to all Ortley Beach seniors, <<eleven to two|10a:1>>.

My guess is if I cruise in right at <<one|9c:1>>, almost now, and tell her I\x{2019}m taking her away for a holiday feast, she\x{2019}ll beg off with the boss, leave her apron on the doorknob, see the whole idea as a complete blast that I\x{2019}ve had planned for weeks, feel secretly flattered and relieved and sure she\x{2019}s had me pegged right and that I\x{2019}m fuller of surprises than she imagined and that all her appreciation of me these years wasn\x{2019}t wrong or wasted. In other words, she\x{2019}ll recognize that I recognize her as the ideal woman, and that even if she\x{2019}s home in time for the nightly news, she\x{2019}ll have gotten more than she bargained for\x{2014}which is all that usually counts with humans.",

The Wiggle Room has opened up, and a hefty blue New Jersey Waste snail-back is swaying into its back alley. There are even tourists outside the mini-golf/batting cage, their nonchalant gestures betraying seasonal uncertainty, their gazes skyward. The green EMS wagon rests back in its Fire Department bay, the same crew as earlier out front under the waving American flag, sharing a smoke and a joke with the two jodhpured motorcycle cops who guarded the race.

            "Of course\x{2014}anyone would expect the rest to happen\x{2014}I wake up in the Sea-Clift EMS truck, strapped to a yellow Stryker stretcher, shirtless and jacketless, covered with a thin pink blanket, my feet toward the back door. It is just like all the movies portray it\x{2014}a fish-eye view, a jouncing, swerving ride under an elevated railroad in the Bronx, siren whoop-whooping, diesel motor growling, lights flashing. The fluorescent light inside is lime green, barely sufficient for decent patient care. The turns and roaring motorized dips make me roll against my nylon belt restraints. There\x{2019}s the smell of rubbing alcohol and other disinfectants and aluminum. And I believe I\x{2019}ve died and this is what death is\x{2014}not the \x{201c}distinguished thing,\x{201d} but a swervy, bumpy ride with a lot of blinking lights all around you that never ends, a constant state of being in between departure and arrival, though that might be just for some. I\x{2019}m bandaged and strung up to a collapsing clear plastic drip bag, and wearing a mask to aid my breathing. I can see the scruffy, heavy-set, red-bearded guy in a white shirt with his stethoscope, sitting beside me, talking to someone else in the compartment who I can\x{2019}t see, talking in the calmest of voices, as if they\x{2019}re on break from the produce department at Kroger\x{2019}s and taking their time about clocking back in. They talk about the 5-K race and some guy they thought had \x{201c}stroked out\x{201d} but, it turns out, hadn\x{2019}t. And some woman with a prosthetic leg whom they admired but couldn\x{2019}t see having decent sex with. And about how no one would catch them out running in the street on Thanksgiving when they could be home watching the Sixers, and then something about the police saying the boys who\x{2019}d shot me and Nick (and possibly Drilla) being Russians: \x{201c}Go figure.\x{201d} I am gripping. My hand can touch something cold and tubular, and I would like very much to sit up and see out the little louvered side windows to find out where we are. The clock on the wall here says it\x{2019}s <<2:33|2>>. But when I stir toward rising, the red-bearded EMS guy with the purple birthmark says, \x{201c}Well, our friend\x{2019}s come alive, looks like,\x{201d} and puts a big freckled hand heavily on my good shoulder so that I can see he\x{2019}s wearing a milky blue plastic glove. I\x{2019}m aware that I say from under my mask, \x{201c}It\x{2019}s all right, I don\x{2019}t have AIDS.\x{201d} And that he says, \x{201c}Sure, we know. Nobody does. These gloves are just my fashion statement.\x{201d} And I may say, \x{201c}I do have cancer, though.\x{201d} And he may say, \x{201c}In-te-rest-ing. Four inches lower and this would be a more leisurely trip.\x{201d} Then I relax and stare at the dim, rocking, metallic-gray ceiling as the boxy crate roars on.",

            "On the nearer-to-home front, Clarissa Bascombe\x{2019}s scrape with local law in Absecon was indeed serious, but ended not nearly as badly as it might\x{2019}ve. Her mother did bring down a lawyer from Haddam, a big, blond, handsome Nordic-looking palooka with eyes on both sides of his head\x{2014}who I\x{2019}d seen a hundred times and never paid any attention to, and who, I believe, is Ann\x{2019}s new goodly swain\x{2014}not the patch-pockets history teacher I previously imagined. She told me this lawyer, Otis\x{2014}I don\x{2019}t know if that\x{2019}s his last name or his first\x{2014}had \x{201c}good connections,\x{201d} which meant either the mob or the statehouse, whatever the difference might be. But by <<six p.m.|5>> Thanksgiving Day, this Otis had Clarissa sprung from the Absecon lockup and had made allegations that the police applied reckless and undue force by running her off the road and into the blinking lane-change arrow and on into the NJDOT employee, whose foot was only sprained and may have been sprained a week before. Otis also claimed Clarissa had possibly been the victim of date rape, or at the very least of a pretty scary dating experience that amounted to assault, leaving her traumatized\x{2014}as good as innocent. She was actually fleeing for her safety, he said, when she made contact with the Absecon police. Thom may pay the freight for this or he may not, since he naturally turns out to have a past no one knew about but, also naturally, has mouthpieces of his own. It\x{2019}s enough that Clarissa was unharmed and will eventually look less like a fool than she felt at the time. When she arrived at the hospital late on Thanksgiving night, when I\x{2019}d been in surgery and was just waking up, feeling surprisingly not so bad but out of my head, she stood close by my bed, gave me her serious stare, put her two hands on my wrist below where they had me strung up to fluids and infusions and heartbeat monitors, then smiled gamely and said in what I remember as an extremely softened, chastened, worn-out, had-it-with-life voice, \x{201c}I guess I\x{2019}ve become number one in number two.\x{201d} This was our joke of possibly longest standing and refers to a sign we once saw on a septic-service truck on the back roads of Connecticut, when she was just a girly girl and I was an insufficient father trying to find sufficiency. There were, or seemed to be, others in the room with her\x{2014}Ann, possibly Paul, possibly Jill, possibly Detective Marinara. I may have dreamed this. Along the top of the green wall, where it corniced with the white ceiling, was a frieze bearing important phrases that the hospital authorities wanted us patients to see as soon as we opened our eyes (if we did). What I read said, \x{201c}When patients feel better about their comfort level they heal faster and their length of stay is shortened.\x{201d}",
