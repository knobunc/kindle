was <<about noon|13>> that the General died. The humming of the native
Christians was the only sound to break the silence. As the afternoon
wore on, the humming was silenced by the great heat; all living
creatures were obliged to crawl into some shade in order to survive.
For a while the silence now became profound at the Residency, as it did
every afternoon. Besides, there was nothing further for the garrison to
do; by now they had made their defences as secure as was possible in
the circumstances. The ladies, having fought polite but ruthless
battles for a place under those punkahs in the billiard room that were
still moving (that is to say, those which still had a native attached
to the other end), lay stretched out on charpoys and mattresses in
their chemises and petticoats like arrangements of wilted flowers,
their faces, necks, and arms shining with perspiration. Flies and
mosquitoes tormented them and they longed for the evening which would
bring, if not coolness, at least a fall in the temperature.',

of mutiny at the prison and Treasury reached the Residency an hour

Krishnapur were most crowded, a strange clinking sound was heard.
People wondered at first where it was coming from; it seemed to be all
around them. As it grew louder they realized that among the familiar
inhabitants of the town a number of strangers had appeared: they moved
in long lines through the evening crowds, looking neither to right nor
left, moving with a curious, rapid shuffle away from the middle of the
town; presently, it became clear that the sound came from the ankle
chains with which they were shackled. The prison guards had mutinied on
a signal given by the sepoys at Captainganj and had freed their

he wore a pink rose which one of the ladies had given him the evening
before. He was pleased with the rose; it helped him to appear calm and
cheerful. Now that the defence of the Residency had begun his main
function must be to keep up the morale of the garrison. With this in
mind he walked over to the Cutcherry as if he were going for a morning
stroll, paying no attention whatsoever to the musket balls which

emphasis, narrowly avoided plunging to the floor; this could have
