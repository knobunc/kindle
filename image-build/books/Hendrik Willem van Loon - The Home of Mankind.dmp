They are not as high as the Alps and therefore it ought to be easier to cross them by means of mountain passes. But that is not so. The Alps, although, very high, are also very wide, and the roads that run across them, although quite long, rise only very slowly and offer no special difficulties to either man or pack-horse. The Pyrenees, on the other hand, are only 60 miles wide, and as a result their mountain passes were much too steep for anybody except a goat or a mule. According to well-seasoned travellers, even the mules experienced difficulties. Trained mountaineers (mostly professional smugglers) were able to get through, but only during a few months of summer. The engineers who built the railways connecting Spain with the rest of the world realized this, for they built the two trunk lines from Paris to Madrid and from Paris to Barcelona along the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Whereas the Alps have half a dozen railway lines passing over them or under them, the Pyrenees, between Irun in the west and Figueras in the east, were not pierced by a single tunnel until <<1928|9c:0>>, when the first of two tunnels was completed.

The granite bridge connecting Scandinavia with Russia was entirely inhabited by people of Mongolian origin. But the western half, the so-called Finnish half, was conquered by the Swedes, while the eastern half, inhabited by the Karelians, became Russian territory. After five centuries of Swedish influence and domination, the Finns of the west had become a civilized European nation superior in many ways to several countries which enjoyed a much better geographical position. But the Karelians, after an equally long period under the rule of the Russians, who some day hoped to exploit the riches of the Kola peninsula and the Murmansk coast, were exactly where they had been when the Muscovite Tsars first insisted upon their submission. Whereas in Finland proper, which did not get in touch with Slavic culture until <<1809|18:0>> when Sweden lost this province to Russia, the number of illiterates is one per cent., it is 97% in Karelia, which has always been under Muscovite influence.

It was during the Shogun era that Japan adopted that strict feudal system which was to influence the character of her people in so profound a way that even to-day, after almost eighty years of industrialism, the Japanese are still feudalists at heart, and contemplate the problems of life from an angle that is totally different from that of their European and American competitors. It took some time to perfect the details of this new arrangement, but <<after 1600|18:0>> Japanese society was divided definitely into three different groups. The highest of these castes consisted of the Daimyos, members of the feudal nobility, the big landowners.

The Arabs, who could wander at will over the entire northern part which, had gradually been converted to Mohammedanism, held a monopoly of that trade. They had sold an occasional shipload of blackamoors to the Portuguese since 1434, but their business did not assume the gigantic proportions of the later days until <<1517|9c:0>>. There was big money in it. The Emperor Charles V (he of the famous Habsburg chin) bestowed upon one of his Flemish friends a grant which allowed him to carry 4000 African slaves each year to Haiti, Cuba, and Porto Rico. The Fleming at once sold his imperial patent to a Genoese speculator who paid him 25,000 ducats for it. The Genoese in turn sold it to a combination of Portuguese, and these Portuguese went to Africa and got in touch with the Arab dealers and the Arab dealers raided a number of Sudanese villages until they had about 10,000 slaves together (one must count on a heavy percentage of loss during the voyage) who were then packed into the hold of some evil-smelling carack and despatched across the ocean.',
