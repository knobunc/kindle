Seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was the noblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life\x{2014}I resolved to capture him, spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil of a boat\x{2019}s crew for a pull on a whaleline); seeing all this, I say, I jumped into my first mate\x{2019}s boat\x{2014}Mr. Mounttop\x{2019}s here (by the way, Captain\x{2014}Mounttop; Mounttop\x{2014}the captain);\x{2014}as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop\x{2019}s boat, which, d\x{2019}ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it.

We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same instant the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here\x{201d} (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); \x{201c}yes, caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell\x{2019}s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh\x{2014}clear along the whole length of my arm\x{2014}came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;\x{2014}and that gentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain\x{2014}Dr. Bunger, ship\x{2019}s surgeon: Bunger, my lad,\x{2014}the captain).

            "Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished, and with such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, in all-ramifying heartlessness;\x{2014}yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the <<midnight|13>> watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah\x{2019}s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss; but what is  more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior\x{2014}though a little swelled\x{2014}of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.",

After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat\x{2014}the swiftest keeled of all\x{2014}seemed to have succeeded in fastening\x{2014}at least, as well as the man at the masthead could tell anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats\x{2014}ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction\x{2014}the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till <<near midnight|13>>, but for the time, to increase her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail\x{2014}stunsail on stunsail\x{2014}after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen, though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen.",

At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy,lc the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale\x{2019}s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.",

They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw;eb they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harbouring wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors;ec they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages;ed they float alike the full-rigged mer-   chant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a <<midnight|13>> ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave\x{2019}s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt\x{2014}but gentlemen, you shall hear.",

It is a quiet <<noon|13>>-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine, when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen.",

Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the harpooner is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one\x{2019}s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half started\x{2014}what that is none know but those who have tried it.

No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooners are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship  owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooner that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted!",

It is much the same with him who endeavours the description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale\x{2019}s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster\x{2019}s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the Highland costume\x{2014}a shirt and socks\x{2014}in which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.",

So long as a man\x{2019}s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one\x{2019}s experience will teach him, that though he can take in an indiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and completely, to examine any two things\x{2014}however large or however small\x{2014}at <<one|9c:0>> and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other.

How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man\x{2019}s, that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction?

I have never marked the coin inspectingly. He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty, heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at <<midnight|13>>, we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.\x{201d}",

And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer\x{2019}s Hook, I\x{2019}d not look at it very long ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killingly wonderful? By   Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here\x{2019}s signs and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditchje in his Epitome calls the zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I\x{2019}ll get the almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll\x{2019}s arithmetic,jf  I\x{2019}ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here\x{2019}s the book. Let\x{2019}s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he\x{2019}s always among \x{2019}em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are\x{2014}here they go\x{2014}all alive:\x{2014}Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here\x{2019}s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among \x{2019}em. Aye, here on the coin he\x{2019}s just crossing the threshold between <<two of twelve|10>> sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know your places. You\x{2019}ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That\x{2019}s my small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch\x{2019}s navigator, and Daboll\x{2019}s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There\x{2019}s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist\x{2014}hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I\x{2019}ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come, Almanac! To begin: there\x{2019}s Aries, or the Ram\x{2014}lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull\x{2014}he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins\x{2014}that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path\x{2014}he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that\x{2019}s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the Scales\x{2014}happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here\x{2019}s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed;   when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There\x{2019}s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly\x{2019}s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let\x{2019}s hear what he\x{2019}ll have to say. There; he\x{2019}s before it; he\x{2019}ll out with something presently.

            "1819Herman Melvill is born on August 1 in New York City to Allan and Maria Gansevoort Melvill, the third of eight children. (The family will add the final \x{2018}e\x{2019} in Melville after Allan\x{2019}s death.) The United States is recovering from an economic depression, and businesses like Allan Melvill\x{2019}s import concern are still struggling. The family is financially unstable and frequently borrows money from relatives.1826Herman contracts scarlet fever, which leaves him with permanently weakened eyesight.1830Allan Melvill\x{2019}s business fails, and the family moves to Albany, New York. Herman enrolls at the Albany Academy, where he remains until his father\x{2019}s death.1832Allan Melvill dies, deeply in debt. Herman takes a number of jobs, such as bank clerk and farmhand, to help his family financially.1835Herman enrolls in the Albany Classical School, where he is exposed to James Fenimore Cooper, Sir Walter Scott, Lord Byron, and other early-nineteenth-century British poets.1837Melville teaches in a school near Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The family is forced into bankruptcy and can no longer maintain their home in Albany. They move to Lansingburgh, New York.1838Melville studies surveying at Lansingburgh Academy, in hopes of working as an engineer on the Erie Canal, a plan that never comes to fruition.1839Melville publishes two installments of \x{201c}Fragments from a Writing Desk\x{201d} in the Democratic Press and Lansingburgh Advertiser. The amateurish composition provides insight into Melville\x{2019}s literary influences; he quotes directly from oralludes to Thomas Campbell\x{2019}s The Pleasures of Hope, Robert Burton\x{2019}s The Anatomy of Melancholy, William Shakespeare\x{2019}s  Hamlet, Lord Byron\x{2019}s Childe Harold\x{2019}s Pilgrimage, Sir Walter Scott\x{2019}s Ivanhoe, poems by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Greek and Roman mythology.In June Melville signs on as a crew member on a ship traveling between New York and Liverpool. He finds the grime, poverty, and starvation of Liverpool astonishing and horrifying, and sees for the first time the need for social reform. He returns to the United States in October and takes another teaching position, this time in Greenbush, New York.1840Melville works as a substitute teacher in Brunswick, New York. He and a friend, Eli James Fly, look for work in Galena, Illinois, near Melville\x{2019}s uncle.1841Melville ships as a seaman aboard the Acushnet, a whaling vessel bound from New Bedford, Massachusetts, for the South Seas; the trip provides facts and ideas for Moby-Dick. Before the voyage, he goes to the Seaman\x{2019}s Bethel and hears a sermon, just as Ishmael listens to Father Mapple in the Whaleman\x{2019}s Chapel before sailing with the Pequod.1842Melville deserts ship with Richard T. Greene in the Marquesas Islands and spends several weeks among the natives of the Taipi valley. An Australian whaling ship picks him up on August 9; when they reach Tahiti, he and others are held in light confinement as mutineers after refusing to obey orders from the first mate. Melville befriends the ship\x{2019}s doctor, and the two become \x{201c}beachcombers\x{201d} throughout the Tahitian islands, where they encounter native villages and Catholic and Protestant missionaries.1843Melville spends four months in the Sandwich Islands (as Hawaii was then called), at Lahaina (Maui) and Honolulu. In August he enlists in the U.S. Navy as an ordinary seaman and sails for home.1844Back in New York, Melville begins writing about his sailing adventures.1846With the help of his older brother, Gansevoort, Melville publishes his first book, Typee: A Peep at Polynesian Life, a novel about his stay with the natives in the Marquesas. Thepoet Walt Whitman reads the novel and writes in the Brooklyn Eagle that it is \x{201c}a strange, graceful, most readable book.\x{201d}1847Melville publishes Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas, another account of his travels and experiences with natives in the Pacific Islands. Both Typee and Omoo are hugely successful. He begins a friendship with Evert Duyckinck, an editor of The Literary World. Over the course of the next few years, Duyckinck will introduce Melville to William Cullen Bryant, Bayard Taylor, N. P. Willis, probably Washington Irving and Edgar Allan Poe, and other members of the New York literary scene.In August Melville marries Elizabeth Shaw, daughter of family friend Lemuel Shaw, chief justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts. Melville\x{2019}s attempts to secure a gov ernment appointment in Washington are unsuccessful, and he and Elizabeth settle in New York City. Over the next few years, he writes articles for The Literary World and Yankee Doodle, a satirical magazine modeled on the British maga zine Punch.1849The Melvilles\x{2019} first child, Malcolm, is born. Melville publishes Mardi: And a Voyage Thither, which begins as a Polynesian adventure but becomes a doomed symbolic quest.  Mardi is not well received by critics or readers. Melville tries to return to his earlier, more successful storytelling mode with Redburn: His Voyage. Being the Sailor-Boy Confessions and Reminiscences of the Son-of-a-Gentleman, in the Merchant Service; however, his increasing seriousness and melancholy are evident.1850Melville publishes White-Jacket; Or, The World in a Man-of- War, another unsuccessful attempt to regain his earlier audience. The Melvilles purchase Arrowhead, a farm near Pittsfield, Massachusetts; Nathaniel Hawthorne lives in nearby Lenox, and the two men begin a strong and lasting friendship.1851Melville publishes Moby-Dick; Or, The Whale, to poor reviews. The Melvilles\x{2019} second son, Stanwix, is born.1852Melville publishes the dark novel Pierre; Or, The Ambiguities; it too fares badly with critics and readers.1853The Melvilles\x{2019} daughter, Elizabeth, is born. Copies of Melville\x{2019}s books are destroyed in a fire at his publishing house, Harper and Brothers. Because there is not enough demand for his works, the books are not reprinted. Melville writes for Putnam\x{2019}s Monthly Magazine and Harper\x{2019}s New Monthly Magazine.1855Melville publishes Israel Potter, a novel of the Revolutionary War. Elizabeth and Herman have a second daughter, Frances.1856Melville publishes The Piazza Tales, a collection that in cludes the stories \x{201c}Bartleby the Scrivener (1853),\x{201d} \x{201c}The Encantadas (1854),\x{201d} and \x{201c}Benito Cereno (1855),\x{201d} which had been published in Putnam\x{2019}s Monthly Magazine.1856\x{2014}1857His physical and emotional health jarred by poor reviews of his novels over the last few years, Melville takes a travel va cation in Europe and the Middle East. He visits Rome, Naples, Syria, Salonica, Jerusalem, Joppa, Beirut, Athens, Alexandria, and Cairo.1857Melville publishes the dark comedy The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade, a satire on materialism in the United States.1857\x{2014}1860He tries to earn a living as a lecturer. He begins writing po etry but cannot find a publisher for his first collection. In 1860 he sails to San Francisco, a trip meant both for enjoy ment and to improve his health, but he has an unpleasant time and returns home to New York via Panama.1861Melville meets President Abraham Lincoln. The four-year American Civil War begins. Melville\x{2019}s thoughts on the di vided nation and the war are evident in his poetry. In some poems he reveals a pessimistic fear that a victorious North will be corrupted by its success and in others a sympathy for human suffering and loss.1863The family moves from Pittsfield to New York City.1866Melville publishes Battle-Pieces and Aspects of the War, a seriesof poems. He begins work as a customs inspector at New York harbor.1867Melville\x{2019}s son Malcolm dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound; it is unclear whether his death is an accident or suicide.1876With financial backing from his uncle, Melville publishes  Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land, which addresses the problem of religious doubt.1885Melville resigns as customs inspector.1886His son Stanwix dies of tuberculosis in a San Francisco hos pital.1888Melville publishes John Marr and Other Sailors, a book of poetry. He takes a short trip to Bermuda.1891He publishes another book of poems, Timoleon. Melville dies of a heart attack on September 28 in New York City.1920sBeginning <<around 1920|18:0>>, in a \x{201c}Melville revival,\x{201d} critics re examine the author\x{2019}s works, to great acclaim.1924The short novel Billy Budd is published.",

            "This came about in part because the study of American literature was by then beginning to be respectable in university English departments, but it is no accident that the \x{201c}rediscovery\x{201d} of Melville coincided with the new experimentalism in all the arts in the years before and <<around 1920|18:0>>. The innovative work of artists like Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, and T. S. Eliot made fresh demands on methods of interpretations. Change was in the air; Joyce\x{2019}s  Ulysses appeared the year following Weaver\x{2019}s study. In literary study there began to be less emphasis on historical context, and more attention to the character of a writer\x{2019}s rhetoric, the suggestiveness of symbolic structures, and the apparent fragmentation of traditional patterns of organization. When this kind of interest was given to  Moby-Dick it stood up to every scrutiny that the period we call modernism could bring. It was not that Melville and his major novel were \x{201c}before their time\x{201d}\x{2014}they were very much part of it\x{2014}but that certain kinds of literature came to be examined in somewhat different ways.",
