            "It was the second day of the assize. The hour was <<12.30 p.m.|2a>> and Pettigrew was just tying the red tape round his second and last brief before leaving the court. Barber, if he had so desired, could have sent his invitation at any time after the sitting of the court that morning. By delaying it to the last moment he must have known that he was combining the pleasures of dispensing hospitality with the maximum of inconvenience to his guest. Such, at least, was Pettigrew\x{2019}s first reflection when, having bowed himself out of court, he finally received the message in the dank and cheerless cell that served as counsel\x{2019}s robing-room at the Shire Hall. He had planned to catch the only fast train of the afternoon to London, which left at <<one o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and lunch on the way. If he accepted he could hardly avoid spending another night in Markhampton. Moreover, the Judge had expressed his intention of dining with the mess. Two meals in Barber\x{2019}s company was more than enough for one day. On the other hand, there was nothing to make his presence in London necessary. Barber, who was quite alive to the state of Pettigrew\x{2019}s practice, knew this also and would be certain to take a refusal as an affront. And that, Pettigrew reflected, would mean that he would have his knife into him for the rest of the circuit. He pondered the alternatives, wrinkling his nose in a characteristic fashion, as he tenderly folded his wig into its battered tin box.",

            "The bar was full and noisy with the mellow voices of patrons putting away their last drinks. The air was cloudy with tobacco smoke and rich with a warm, moist smell of beer and humanity. Pettigrew noted the time by the clock on the far wall and was about to withdraw when his eye was caught by an animated group beneath it. Three or four soldiers and one or two civilians were clustered round a darts board, at which a short, tubby middle-aged man in a dazzling check pullover was taking aim. Evidently the game was in its concluding stages, and excitement was running high. Evidently, also the thrower was a master of the craft. He threw, and a shout went up. \x{201c}Thirty-four you want!\x{201d} someone shouted. \x{201c}Careful now, Corky. Go for\x{2014}\x{2014}\x{201d} But Corky evidently knew exactly what he wanted. With a look of perfect confidence he threw again. Another shout. \x{201c}Double seven!\x{201d} \x{201c}<<Twenty|9q>> now,\x{201d} said the voice. Pettigrew, who knew nothing whatever of the game felt the rising tide of emotion grip him. He became desperately anxious for Corky to do whatever was necessary, and waited breathlessly for the last throw. He need not have worried. Amid a sudden breathless silence, Corky raised his fat form on his toes with the grace of a dancer, took careful aim and loosed his last shaft. \x{201c}Double ten!\x{201d} The noise seemed to make every glass in the bar ring again. Sweating, but otherwise perfectly calm, the triumphant Corky suffered his hand to be wrung, his back to be thumped again and again, and retired to finish his glass, while, the barman thundered, \x{201c}Time, gentlemen, please!\x{201d}",

These were merely official affairs, at which such dignitaries as the High Sheriff, the Mayor and the local County Court Judge attended with their wives, discussed local affairs and departed punctually at a <<quarter past ten|10>>. But they served, if nothing else, to demonstrate Hilda\x{2019}s admirable tact. She would manage her party with discretion, never allow the conversation to degenerate to the mere maundering of the average official gathering, and at the same time subdued her own brilliance to the level of the company. More to her taste, however, were the lunches to which the Judge invited from time to time the members of the bar engaged in the criminal cases. She was at her best with the young men. Derek observed with rueful amusement others undergoing the same process of drawing-out that he had endured. He noticed also that neither to them nor to their elders did she admit to the faintest knowledge of their trade. On one occasion she sat without moving a muscle while a very young man, holding his first brief, laboriously explained for her benefit an elementary point of procedure\x{2014}and incidentally explained it wrongly.",

It is perhaps a matter for an expert toxicologist, such as I do not claim to be, to decide, but I should judge that swallowed whole, in the fashion of a pill taken medicinally, a quantity of carbide such as this might be attended with disagreeable, possibly even fatal results. I cannot say, but it is possible. I do not seek to put it higher than that. But who ever heard of anyone ingesting chocolates in this manner? The very raison d\x{2019}\x{ea}tre  of such articles is the pleasure to the palate, which would be wholly circumvented by such a procedure. No! There are two methods only of consuming sweets. <<One|9k:0>>, the procedure which I fancy you favour, Lady Barber, that of biting and munching\x{2014}I apologise for the crudity of the phrase but I know no other way of expressing it\x{2014}the other, the slower and gentler technique adopted by the Judge, namely that of sucking  and slow absorption. Now it is clear from your own very unpleasant experience of last night (I trust you are quite recovered by the way? Forgive me for not having made the inquiry sooner) it is clear that at the very first moment of  biting,  the contact of the saliva with the carbide releases acetylene gas, the fraud is exposed and the intruder summarily ejected. On the sucking  principle, on the other hand, discovery is slower, but none the less\x{2014}\x{2014}\x{201d} he shook his head solemnly \x{201c}\x{2014}none the less sure. Possibly before the moment of revelation and repudiation there would be time for a minute quantity of carbide to be absorbed into the system\x{2014}enough I dare say to set up very unpleasant internal reactions, but not, I am convinced, sufficient to be a lethal dose. I repeat, as a medium for what is so strangely and inaptly termed a practical joke, carbide is all that could be desired. As a poison, it is simply not in the picture.\x{201d}",

Beechammle\x{2019}s shop in New Bond Street,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I had with me a one-pound box of chocolates handed to me that morning by the Assistant Commissioner, with the information that he had received it from Lady Barber in the same state in which it was given to me. At the shop I saw the manageress, a Mademoiselle Dupont. I informed her that I was a police officer and that I was making inquiries concerning the box which I then produced to her. I explained that there was reason to suppose that the contents had been tampered with and that it was required to ascertain if possible the date on which the box had been sold and the person to whom the sale had been effected. Mademoiselle Dupont informed me that chocolates of the type in question, known by the name of Bouch\x{e9}es  Princesses  were made and sold by the firm in comparatively small quantities only, approximately fifty pounds a week. Of these about half went to restaurants and other customers who gave regular orders. A list of these was furnished to me. So far as the date of purchase was concerned, she was in the position to say that the box in question had been packed in the factory on or after the 2nd instant. She was able to establish this from the paper wrapping of the individual chocolates. Due to difficulties of supply following on war conditions, paper of a slightly inferior quality was employed on and after that date. Chocolates are normally on sale in the shop on the day following the packing of the box in the factory. It follows therefore that the box in question must have been purchased between the 3rd instant and the day on which they arrived at Southington, namely the 7th.\x{201d}",

More important, perhaps, was the obvious fact that however anxious Sally was to show her opinion of Hilda\x{2019}s interference, and however nimble in devising her retort, she would be most unlikely to do anything about it until she had had some tea. After all, she had probably eaten nothing for lunch beyond a hasty snack at the National Gallery canteen; and Bradshaw did not credit the train with a restaurant car.

Here he would be engaged in conversation which, as the days went on, became more and more desultory, by Derek and, if she chose to appear, by Hilda.

Down these it was the Shaver\x{2019}s custom to descend with slow and solemn gait and a ceremonious expression on his face as though to emphasize the fact that whereas at breakfast a short hour ago he had been merely a rather peevish elderly gentleman, he was just now His Majesty\x{2019}s Judge of Assize.

Mrs. Square, he felt, might immediately be dismissed from the reckoning.

Apart from the pleasure of demonstrating the necessity of keeping a watch at night, he could not imagine the object in such behaviour, but he was quite prepared to credit her with motives beyond his comprehension. Perhaps she was slightly mad, and her madness had taken the form of inventing the whole story of a plot against the Judge and the concoction of incidents to support it. After all, persecution mania was a recognized aberration and this might be merely an unusual form of it. Derek toyed with the idea for some time and for a moment almost believed that he had the clue to the whole mystery. But he soon saw that it would not do. He had seen Hilda\x{2019}s face at the moment when she tasted the poisoned chocolate, and he had seen her immediately after the assault at Wimblingham.

            "\x{201c}Yes. You see he had told me some time ago about this case, and I knew that he was in rather a state about it. Yesterday morning, I happened to see on the notice board in the Cloisters that it was being heard in No. 1 Court, where I knew that Barber was sitting, and this morning I saw that it was part heard. I took no particular interest in it until at lunch-time when I happened to sit next to Fawcett in hall, and heard from him that Barber had\x{2014}not to put too fine a point on it\x{2014}behaved outrageously. That worried me quite a bit, because I am really quite fond of young Marshall, and I knew he would take it badly. Then when I got back here in the afternoon, John told me that he had been trying to see me. He told me, too, that he was obviously in a very nervous and excited state, and had left abruptly <<just before four o\x{2019}clock|10>>. I suddenly had a horrible feeling of anxiety about him. I remembered his absurd idealism about judges and justice\x{2014}rather engaging in its way, but confoundedly dangerous\x{2014}and it crossed my mind that he might have gone back to the court, and that if so, I really ought to try to head him off. So, on the spur of the moment, I took a taxi and dashed down there. I was just too late, as it turned out. Poor chap!\x{201d}",
