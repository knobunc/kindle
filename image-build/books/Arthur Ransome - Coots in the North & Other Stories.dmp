            "He got it. He wrote several fairly worthless books of tales in the years <<after 1906|18:0>>, as well as further literary criticism. He did not seem to be making much progress. Then, in 1913, he went to Russia, chiefly in order to learn the language and make a collection of Russian folk-tales. Old Peter (published in 1916) resulted from this adventure, and was Ransome\x{2019}s first indubitable literary success. It has never been out of print. Arthur Ransome\x{2019}s apprenticeship was over.",

            "At least he had sailing. He had learned the art in the years before <<1914|9c:0>>, on Coniston Water, where he sailed with his friends the Collingwood family (W. G. Collingwood was a Lakeland antiquary and historian); now, settled in Estonia, from which he wrote about Russia for the Manchester Guardian, he took it up again with enthusiasm. After a year or two of makeshifts he commissioned the building of his very own ship, Racundra; and the log he joyously kept of his first voyage in her provided the raw material for a new book which, he later came to feel, got him back to his proper business in life. Racundra\x{2019}s First Cruise (1923) was such a success that he thought he would attempt a sequel; but somehow or other, like the sequel to Old Peter, it never got done. Instead the Ransomes moved to England, sold Racundra, and bought a cottage in the hills east of Lake Windermere with the proceeds. Ransome tried to settle down to life as a staff-writer on the Manchester Guardian. It seemed that he had put story-telling behind him for good.",

During the next few years (until <<1935|18:0>>) Ransome continued to live at Low Ludderburn, and the books, with the exception of Peter Duck, were all set in the north. Swallowdale continued the exploration of the fictionalised Lake District: we hear about Kanchenjunga (Coniston Old Man), the great mountain which dominates the western shore of the lake; the text is dotted with real lake country names (Bigland, High Street, the Heald Wood); the Swainson farm is the one at High Nibthwaite where the Ransome family had stayed every summer during Arthur\x{2019}s childhood; near by was the original Knickerbockerbreaker where the young Arthur wore through the seat of his shorts, which were then darned in situ by Annie Swainson (Mary in the book). Swallowdale itself can still be found by those prepared to do some careful map-reading, after consulting Arthur Ransome and Captain Flint\x{2019}s Trunk, by Christina Hardyment, or Arthur Ransome\x{2019}s Lakeland, by Roger Wardale.",

His grandfather was as keen and ingenious a fisherman as his grandson, and a founder member of the association that controlled the fishing on the river Bela. Arthur considered it a great honour to be invited to fill his grandfather\x{2019}s place, in <<about 1930|18:0>>, and when, a few years later, he reckoned up the pros and cons of moving from the Lake District to the East Coast, he thought the loss of the Bela fishing a decided con:",

So it is not surprising that the idea of putting Tom into a book should have occurred to him; and he announced the plan to his American publisher in January 1931. Not until <<1943|18:0>> did he take it up seriously. But then he made his plans and got to work with decision and fluency that suggest he had never quite forgotten the project.

Tom counted them, and as he heard the ninth and last, knew that in the vicarage schoolroom, the boys would be saying \x{201c}Our Father, which art in Heaven\x{201d}, sentence by sentence after the old Canon, and then singing \x{201c}Rock of Ages\x{201d} before settling down to the morning\x{2019}s lessons. He was late already. If he were to run all the way now he would come to the schoolroom to find them all at work. There was a splash in the pool below the bridge. Tom scrambled again on the parapet, but the salmon, if it was the salmon, had already driven forward into the deeper water. He watched, but there were no more. Perhaps the fish had been running since yesterday. The river might be full of them, fresh from the sea. Perhaps there were salmon already lying in the Oaks pool. It was then that he remembered the bacon sandwiches. With those, he was free till supper-time. The faraway clock chimed the half hour. Tom slipped down from the parapet, picked up his satchel, turned towards the village, stopped, turned the other way, crossed the bridge and slipped through the narrow stone stile into the meadow. Tom Staunton was not going to school that day.",
