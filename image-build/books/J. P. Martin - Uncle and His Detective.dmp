Then that great slimy fist came crashing through the window-pane and started to grope about the room. I was shaking so much I could hardly unscrew the top of the bottle.

The castle will, of course, have a few flags out and electric lights from top to bottom, and the great searchlight will be working on Captain Walrus\'s lighthouse. After refreshments I will make a short speech of about five minutes, and everybody will be pleased and somewhat enriched when they hear it.
