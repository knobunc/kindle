Summers were manic and gusty, then often around August deadly calm. The wind would just die some August days, and it was no relief at all; the cessation drove us nuts. Each August, we realized afresh how much the sound of wind had become part of the soundtrack to life in Philo. The sound of wind had become, for me, silence.

            "The only time I ever got caught in what might have been an actual one was in June \x{2019}78 on a tennis court at Hessel Park in Champaign, where I was drilling one afternoon with Gil Antitoi. Though a contemptible and despised tournament opponent, I was a coveted practice partner because I could transfer balls to wherever you wanted them with the mindless constancy of a machine. This particular day it was supposed to rain around suppertime, and a couple times we thought we\x{2019}d heard the tattered edges of a couple sirens out west toward Monticello, but Antitoi and I drilled religiously every afternoon that week on the slow clayish Har-Tru of Hessel, trying to prepare for a beastly clay invitational in Chicago where it was rumored both Brescia and Mees would appear. We were doing butterfly drills\x{2014}my crosscourt forehand is transferred back down the line to Antitoi\x{2019}s backhand, he crosscourts it to my backhand, I send it down the line to his forehand, four 45\x{b0} angles, though the intersection of just his crosscourts make an X, which is four 90\x{b0}s and also a crucifix rotated the same quarter-turn that a swastika (which involves eight 90\x{b0} angles) is rotated on Hitlerian bunting. This was the sort of stuff that went through my head when I drilled. Hessel Park was scented heavily with cheese from the massive Kraft factory at Champaign\x{2019}s western limit, and it had wonderful expensive soft Har-Tru courts of such a deep piney color that the flights of the fluorescent balls stayed on one\x{2019}s visual screen for a few extra seconds, leaving trails, which is also why the angles and hieroglyphs involved in butterfly drill seem important. But the crux here is that butterflies are primarily a conditioning drill: both players have to get from one side of the court to the other between each stroke, and once the initial pain and wind-sucking are over\x{2014}assuming you\x{2019}re a kid who\x{2019}s in absurd shape because he spends countless mindless hours jumping rope or running laps backward or doing star-drills between the court\x{2019}s corners or straight sprints back and forth along the perfect furrows of early beanfields each morning\x{2014}once the first pain and fatigue of butterflies are got through, if both guys are good enough so that there are few unforced errors to break up the rally, a kind of fugue-state opens up inside you where your concentration telescopes toward a still point and you lose awareness of your limbs and the soft shush of your shoe\x{2019}s slide (you have to slide out of a run on Har-Tru) and whatever\x{2019}s outside the lines of the court, and pretty much all you know then is the bright ball and the octangled butterfly outline of its trail across the billiard green of the court. We had one just endless rally and I\x{2019}d left the planet in a silent swoop inside when the court and ball and butterfly trail all seemed to surge brightly and glow as the daylight just plain went out in the sky overhead. Neither of us had noticed that there\x{2019}d been no wind blowing the familiar grit into our eyes for several minutes\x{2014}a bad sign. There was no siren. Later they said the C.D. alert network had been out of order. This was June 6, 1978. The air temperature dropped so fast you could feel your hairs rise. There was no thunder and no air stirred. I could not tell you why we kept hitting. Neither of us said anything. There was no siren. It was <<high noon|13>>; there was nobody else on the courts. The riding mower out over east at the Softball field was still going back and forth. There were no depressions except a saprogenic ditch along the field of new corn just west. What could we have done? The air always smells of mowed grass before a bad storm. I think we thought it would rain at worst and that we\x{2019}d play till it rained and then go sit in Antitoi\x{2019}s parents\x{2019} station wagon. I do remember a mental obscenity\x{2014}I had gut strings in my rackets, strings everybody with a high sectional ranking got free for letting the Wilson sales rep spray-paint a W across the racket face, so they were free, but I liked this particular string job on this racket, I liked them tight but not real tight, 62-63 p.s.i. on a Proflite stringer, and gut becomes pasta if it gets wet, but we were both in the fugue-state that exhaustion through repetition brings on, a fugue-state I\x{2019}ve decided that my whole time playing tennis was spent chasing, a fugue-state I associated too with plowing and seeding and detasseling and spreading herbicides back and forth in sentry duty along perfect lines, up and back, or military marching on flat blacktop, hypnotic, a mental state at once flat and lush, numbing and yet exquisitely felt. We were young, we didn\x{2019}t know when to stop. Maybe I was mad at my body and wanted to hurt it, wear it down. Then the whole knee-high field to the west along Kirby Avenue all of a sudden flattened out in a wave coming toward us as if the field was getting steamrolled. Antitoi went wide west for a forehand cross and I saw the corn get laid down in waves and the sycamores in a copse lining the ditch point our way. There was no funnel. Either it had just materialized and come down or it wasn\x{2019}t a real one. The big heavy swings on the industrial swingsets took off, wrapping themselves in their chains around and around the top crossbar; the park\x{2019}s grass got laid down the same way the field had; the whole thing happened so fast I\x{2019}d seen nothing like it; recall that Bi-mini H-Bomb film of the shock wave visible in the sea as it comes toward the ship\x{2019}s film crew. This all happened very fast but in serial progression: field, trees, swings, grass, then the feel like the lift of the world\x{2019}s biggest mitt, the nets suddenly and sexually up and out straight, and I seem to remember whacking a ball out of my hand at Antitoi to watch its radical west-east curve, and for some reason trying to run after this ball I\x{2019}d just hit, but I couldn\x{2019}t have tried to run after a ball I had hit, but I remember the heavy gentle lift at my thighs and the ball curving back closer and my passing the ball and beating the ball in flight over the horizontal net, my feet not once touching the ground over fifty-odd feet, a cartoon, and then there was chaff and crud in the air all over and both Antitoi and I either flew or were blown pinwheeling for I swear it must have been fifty feet to the fence one court over, the easternmost fence, we hit the fence so hard we knocked it halfway down, and it stuck at 45\x{b0}, Antitoi detached a retina and had to wear those funky Jabbar retina-goggles for the rest of the summer, and the fence had two body-shaped indentations like in cartoons where the guy\x{2019}s face makes a cast in the skillet that hit him, two catcher\x{2019}s masks offence, we both got deep quadrangular lines impressed on our faces, torsos, legs\x{2019} fronts, from the fence, my sister said we looked like waffles, but neither of us got badly hurt, and no homes got whacked\x{2014}either the thing just ascended again for no reason right after, they do that, obey no rule, follow no line, hop up and down at something that might as well be will, or else it wasn\x{2019}t a real one. Antitoi\x{2019}s tennis continued to improve after that, but mine didn\x{2019}t.",

Since Joe B. is average, he\x{2019}ll shrug at pollsters\x{2019} questions and answer averagely that he most often watches television to \x{201c}unwind\x{201d} from those elements of his day and life he finds unpleasant. It\x{2019}s tempting to suppose that TV enables this unwinding simply because it offers an Auschlanderian \x{201c}distraction,\x{201d} something to divert the mind from quotidian troubles. But would mere distraction ensure continual massive watching? Television offers way more than distraction. In lots of ways, television purveys and enables dreams, and most of these dreams involve some sort of transcendence of average daily life. The modes of presentation that work best for TV\x{2014}stuff like \x{201c}action,\x{201d} with shoot-outs and car wrecks, or the rapid-fire \x{201c}collage\x{201d} of commercials, news, and music videos, or the \x{201c}hysteria\x{201d} of prime-time soap and sitcom with broad gestures, high voices, too much laughter\x{2014}are unsubtle in their whispers that, somewhere, life is quicker, denser, more interesting, more\x{2026} well, lively than contemporary life as Joe Briefcase knows it. This might seem benign until we consider that what good old average Joe Briefcase does more than almost anything else in contemporary life is watch television, an activity which anyone with an average brain can see does not make for a very dense and lively life. Since television must seek to attract viewers by offering a dreamy promise of escape from daily life, and since stats confirm that so grossly much of ordinary U.S. life is watching TV, TV\x{2019}s whispered promises must somehow undercut television-watching in theory (\x{201c}Joe, Joe, there\x{2019}s a world where life is lively, where nobody spends six hours a day unwinding before a piece of furniture\x{201d}) while reinforcing television-watching in practice (\x{201c}Joe, Joe, your best and only access to this world is TV\x{201d}).",

            "Pynchon and DeLillo were ahead of their time. Today, the belief that pop images are basically just mimetic devices is one of the attitudes that separates most U.S. fiction writers under c. 40 from the writerly generation that precedes us, reviews us, and designs our grad-school curricula. This generation gap in conceptions of realism is, again, TV-dependent. The U.S. generation born <<after 1950|18:0>> is the first for whom television was something to be lived with instead of just looked at. Our elders tend to regard the set rather as the flapper did the automobile: a curiosity turned treat turned seduction. For younger writers, TV\x{2019}s as much a part of reality as Toyotas and gridlock. We literally cannot imagine life without it. We\x{2019}re not different from our fathers in that television presents and defines our contemporary world. Where we are different is that we have no memory of a world without such electric definition. This is why the derision so many older fictionists heap on a \x{201c}Brat Pack\x{201d} generation they see as insufficiently critical of mass culture is at once understandable and misguided. It\x{2019}s true that there\x{2019}s something sad about the fact that David Leavitt\x{2019}s short stories\x{2019} sole description of some characters is that their T-shirts have certain brand names on them. But the fact is that, for most of Leavitt\x{2019}s educated young readership, members of a generation raised and nourished on messages equating what one consumes with who one is, Leavitt\x{2019}s descriptions really do do the job. In our post-1950s, inseparable-from-TV association pool, brand loyalty really is synecdochic of character; this is simply a fact.",

The horses are in their own individual stalls, with half-height doors and owners and grooms on stools by the doors, a lot of them dozing. The horses stand in hay. Billy Ray Cyrus plays loudly on some stableboy\x{2019}s boom box. The horses have tight hides and apple-sized eyes that are set on the sides of their heads, like fish. I\x{2019}ve rarely been this close to fine livestock. The horses\x{2019} faces are long and somehow suggestive of coffins. The racers are lanky, velvet over bone.

All their muscles are beautiful; the hides enhance them. Their tails whip around in sophisticated double-jointed ways, keeping the flies from mounting any kind of coordinated attack.

These are special competitive horses, intricately bred, w/ high-strung artistic temperaments. I wish I\x{2019}d brought carrots: animals can be bought, emotionally. Stall after stall of horses. Standard horse-type colors. They eat the same hay they stand in. Occasional feedbags look like gas masks.

The cars come in all hues. Most look to be sponsored by either Skoal or Marlboro. Pit crews in surgical white lean out into the track and flash obscure commands written on little chalkboards. The infield is clotted with trailers and tow trucks and Officials\x{2019} stands and electric signs. Women in skimpy tops stand on different trailers, seeming very partisan indeed. It\x{2019}s all very confusing. Certain facts in the program just don\x{2019}t add up\x{2014}like the Winner\x{2019}s Purse is only \$9200, yet each car supposedly represents a six-figure annual investment for various sponsors. Whatever they invest in, it isn\x{2019}t mufflers. I can barely take my hands off my ears long enough to turn the program\x{2019}s pages. The cars sound almost like jets\x{2014}that insectile whine\x{2014}but with a diesely, lawn-mowerish component you can feel in your skull. Part of the problem is the raw concrete of the Grandstand\x{2019}s seating; another\x{2019}s the fact that the seating\x{2019}s on just one side of the Grandstand, on the straightaway. When the main mass of cars passes it\x{2019}s unendurable; your very skeleton hurts from the noise, and your ears are still belling when they come around again. The cars go like mad bats on the straightaways and then shift down for the tight turns, their rear tires wobbling in the dirt. Certain cars pass other cars, and some people cheer when they do. Down at the bottom of my section of seats a little boy held up on a cement fence-support by his father is rigid, facing away from the track, his hands clamped over his ears so hard his elbows stick way out, and his face is a rictus of pain as the cars go by. The little boy and I sort of rictus at each other. A fine dirty dust hangs in the air and coats everything, tongues included. Then all of a sudden binoculars come out and everyone stands as there\x{2019}s some sort of screeching slide and crash on a far turn, all the way across the infield; and firemen in full-length slickers and hats go racing out there in fire trucks, and the PA voice\x{2019}s pitch goes way up but is still incomprehensible, and a man with those airline earmuffs in the Officials\x{2019} stands leans out and flails at the air with a bright-yellow flag, and the go-carts throttle down to autobahn speed, and the Official Pace Car (a Trans Am) comes out and leads them around, and everybody stands up, and I stand too. It\x{2019}s impossible to see anything but a swizzle stick of smoke above the far turn, and the engine noise is endurable and the PA silent, and the relative quiet hangs there while we all wait for news, and I look around hard at all the faces below the raised binoculars, but it\x{2019}s not at all clear what sort of news we\x{2019}re all hoping for.",

            "08/15/ <<1800h|1>>. Back again at the seemingly inescapable Club Mickey D\x{2019}s. All signs of baton-twirlers and fallen spectators have been erased. The tent\x{2019}s now set up for Illinois Golden Gloves Boxing. Out on the floor is a kind of square made up of four boxing rings. The rings are made out of clothesline and poles anchored by cement-filled tires, one ring per age division\x{2014}Sixteens, Fourteens, Twelves, Tens(!). Here\x{2019}s another unhyped but riveting spectacle. If you want to see genuine interhuman violence, go check out a Golden Gloves tourney. None of your adult pros\x{2019} silky footwork or Rope-a-Dope defenses here. Here asses are thoroughly kicked in what are essentially playground brawls with white-tipped gloves and brain-shaped headguards. The combatants\x{2019} tank tops say things like \x{201c}Rockford Jr. Boxing\x{201d} and \x{201c}Elgin Fight Club.\x{201d} The rings\x{2019} corners have stools for the kids to sit on and get worked over by their teams\x{2019} coaches. The coaches look like various childhood friends of mine\x{2019}s abusive fathers\x{2014}florid, blue-jawed, bull-necked, flinty-eyed, the kind of men who bowl, watch TV in their underwear, and oversee sanctioned brawls. Now a fighter\x{2019}s mouthguard goes flying out of the Fourteens\x{2019} ring, end over end, trailing strings of spit, and the crowd around that ring howls. In the Sixteens\x{2019} ring is a Springfield kid, a local hero, one Darrell Hall, against a slim fluid Latino named Sullivano from Joliet. Hall outweighs Sullivano by a good twenty pounds. Hall also looks like just about every kid who ever beat me up in high school, right down to the wispy mustache and upper lip\x{2019}s cruel twist. The crowd around the Sixteens\x{2019} ring is all his friends\x{2014}guys with muscle shirts and varsity gym shorts and gelled hair, girls in cutoff overalls and complex systems of barrettes and scrunchies. There are repeated shouts of \x{201c}Kick his ass Darrell!\x{201d} The Latino sticks and moves. Somebody in this tent is smoking a joint, I can smell. The Sixteens can actually box. The ceiling\x{2019}s lights are bare bulbs in steel cones, hanging cockeyed from a day of batons. Everybody here pours sweat. A few people look askance at the little clicker I carry. The reincarnation of every high school cheerleader I ever pined for is in the Sixteens\x{2019} crowd. The girls cry out and sort of frame their face in their hands whenever Darrell Hall gets hit. I do not know why cutoff overall shorts have evaded the East Coast\x{2019}s fashion ken; they are devastating. The fight in Fourteens is stopped for a moment to let the ref wipe a gout of blood from one kid\x{2019}s glove. Sullivano glides and jabs, sort of orbiting Hall. Hall is implacable, a hunched and feral fighter, boring in. Air explodes through his nose when he lands a blow. He keeps trying to back the Latino against the clothesline. People fan themselves with wood-handled fans from the Democratic Party. Mosquitoes work the crowd. The refs keep slapping at their necks. The rains have been bad, and the mosquitoes this August are the bad kind, big and vaguely hairy, field-bred, rapacious, the kind that can swarm on a calf overnight and the farmer finds his calf in the morning splay-legged and bled kosher. This actually happens. Mosquitoes are not to be fucked with out here. (East-Coast friends laugh at my dread of mosquitoes, and they make fun of the little battery-powered box I carry whenever I\x{2019}m outside at night. Even in like NYC or Boston I carry it. It\x{2019}s from an obscure catalogue and produces a sound like a dragonfly\x{2014}a.k.a. odonata anisoptera, sworn eternal foe to all mosquitoes everywhere\x{2014}a faint high-speed clicking that sends any right-thinking mosquito out of its mind with fear. On East 55th, carrying the little box is maybe a bit neurotic; here, with me ripe and sweaty and tall in this crowd, the good old trusty clicker saves more than just my ass.) I can also see the Tens from this vantage, a vicious free-for-all between two tiny kids whose headguards make their heads look too big for their bodies. Neither ten-year-old has any interest in defense. Their shoes\x{2019} toes touch as they windmill at each other, scoring at will. Scary dads chew gum in their corners. One kid\x{2019}s mouthguard keeps falling out. Now the Sixteens\x{2019} crowd explodes as their loutish Darrell catches Sullivano with an uppercut that puts him on his bottom. Sullivano gamely rises, but his knees wobble and he won\x{2019}t face the ref. Hall raises both arms and faces the crowd, disclosing a missing incisor. The girls betray their cheerleading backgrounds by clapping and jumping up and down at the same time. Hall shakes his gloves at the ceiling as several girls call his name, and you can feel it in the air\x{2019}s very ions: Darrell Hall is going to get laid before the night\x{2019}s over.",

This ominousness is hard to put a finger on or describe in any sensuous way. It turns out that there\x{2019}s a warning out that day for a Santa Ana Wind, a strange weather phenomenon that causes fire hazards   and also a weird but verifiable kind of high-ion anxiety in man and beast alike. LA\x{2019}s murder rate is apparently higher during Santa Ana Wind periods than any other time, and in Griffith Park it\x{2019}s easy to confirm that something\x{2019}s up atmospherically: sounds sound harsher, smells smell stronger, breathing tastes funny, the sunlight has a way of diffracting into spikes that penetrate all the way to the back of the skull, and overall there\x{2019}s a weird leathery stillness to the air, the West-Coast equivalent of the odd aquarial stillness that tends to precede Midwestern thunderstorms. The air smells of sage and pine and dust and distant creosote. Wild mustard, yucca, sumac, and various grasses form a kind of <<five-o\x{2019}clock|6>> shadow on the hillsides, and scrub oak and pine jut at unlikely angles, and some of the trees\x{2019} trunks are creepily curved and deformed, and there are also a lot of obstreperous weeds and things with thorns that discourage much hiking around. The texture of the site\x{2019}s flora is basically that of a broom\x{2019}s business end. A single red-tailed hawk circles overhead through the whole first day of shooting, just one hawk, and always the same circle, so that after a while the circle seemed etched. The road where the set is is like a kind of small canyon between a butte on one side and an outright cliff on the other. The cliff affords both a good place to study the choreography of the set and, in the other direction, a spectacular view of Hollywood to the right and to the left the S.F.

At <<0\x{2013}15|9m:1>>, his first serve is flat and 118 mph and way out to Joyce\x{2019}s backhand, which is a two-hander and hard to lunge effectively with, but Joyce lunges plenty effectively and sends the ball back down the line to the Canadian\x{2019}s forehand, deep in the court and with such flat pace that Brakus has to stutter-step a little and backpedal to get set up\x{2014}clearly he\x{2019}s used to playing guys for whom 118 mumps out wide would be an outright ace or at least produce such a weak return that he could move up easily and put the ball away\x{2014}and Brakus now sends the ball back up the line high over the net, loopy with topspin, not all that bad a shot considering the fierceness of the return, and a topspin shot that\x{2019}d back most tennis players up and put them on the defensive, and but Michael Joyce, whose level of tennis is such that he moves in on balls hit with topspin and hits them on the rise,   moves in and takes the ball on the rise and hits a backhand cross so tightly angled that nobody alive could get to it. This is kind of a typical Joyce-Brakus point. The match is carnage of a particular high-level sort: it\x{2019}s like watching an extremely large and powerful predator get torn to pieces by an even larger and more powerful predator. Brakus looks pissed off after Joyce\x{2019}s winner, makes some berating-himself-type noises, but the anger seems kind of pro forma: it\x{2019}s not like there\x{2019}s anything Brakus could have done much better, not given what he and the 79th-best player in the world have in their respective arsenals.",

            "The Joyce-Knowle match takes slightly more than an hour. This is including delays caused when Knowle throws his racquet and has to go retrieve it or when he walks around in aimless circles muttering blackly to himself in some High-German dialect. Knowle\x{2019}s tantrums seem a little contrived and insincere to me, though, because he rarely loses a point as a result of doing anything particularly wrong. Here\x{2019}s a typical point in this match: it\x{2019}s 1\x{2013}4 and <<15\x{2013}30|5a:1>> in the sixth game. Knowle hits a 110-mph slice serve to Joyce\x{2019}s forehand; Joyce hits a very flat and penetrating drive crosscourt, so that Knowle has to stretch and hit his forehand on the run, something that\x{2019}s not particularly easy to do with a two-handed forehand. Knowle gets to the forehand and hits a thoroughly respectable shot, loopy with topspin and landing maybe only a little bit short, a few feet behind the service line, whereupon he reverses direction and starts scrambling back to get in the middle of the baseline to get ready for his next shot. Joyce, as is SOP, has moved in on the slightly short ball and takes the ball on the rise just after it\x{2019}s bounced, driving a backhand even flatter and harder into the exact same place he hit his last shot, the spot Knowle is scrambling away from. Knowle is now forced to reverse direction and get back to where he was.   This he does, and he gets his racquet on the ball, but only barely, and sends back a weak little USDA Prime loblet that Joyce, now in the actual vicinity of the net, has little trouble blocking into the open court for a winner. The four people clap, Knowle\x{2019}s racquet goes spinning into the blood-colored tarp, and Joyce walks expressionlessly back to the deuce court to receive again whenever Knowle gets around to serving. Knowle has slightly more firepower than the first round\x{2019}s Brakus: his groundstrokes are formidable, probably even lethal if he has sufficient time to get to the ball and get set up. Joyce simply denies him that time. Joyce will later admit that he wasn\x{2019}t working all that hard in this match, and he doesn\x{2019}t need to. He hits few spectacular winners, but he also makes very few unforced errors, and his shots are designed to make the somewhat clumsy Knowle move a lot and to deny him the time and the peace ever to set up his game. This strategy is one that Knowle cannot solve or interdict: he hasn\x{2019}t got the tools for it. This may be one reason why Joyce is unaffronted by having to play the Qualies for Montreal: barring some kind of injury or neurological dysfunction, he\x{2019}s not going to lose to somebody like Austria\x{2019}s Julian Knowle\x{2014}Joyce is simply on a different plateau from the mass of these Qualie players.",

            "It\x{2019}s now <<1132h|1>>., and boarding will not commence one second <<before 1400|18:0>> sharp; a PA announcement politely but firmly declares Celebrity\x{2019}s seriousness about this.   The PA lady\x{2019}s voice is what you imagine a British supermodel would sound like. Everyone\x{2019}s clutching his numbered card like the cards are identity papers at Checkpoint Charley. There\x{2019}s an Ellis Island/pre-Auschwitz aspect to the massed and anxious waiting, but I\x{2019}m uncomfortable trying to extend the analogy. A lot of the people waiting\x{2014}Caribbeanish clothing notwithstanding\x{2014}look Jewish to me, and I\x{2019}m ashamed to catch myself thinking that I can determine Jewishness from people\x{2019}s appearance.   Maybe two-thirds of the total people in here are actually sitting in orange chairs. Pier 21\x{2019}s pre-boarding blimp hangar\x{2019}s not as bad as, say, Grand Central at <<1715h|1>>. on Friday, but it bears little resemblance to any of the stressless pamper-venues detailed in the Celebrity brochure, which brochure I am not the only person in here thumbing through and looking at wistfully. A lot of people are also reading the Fort Lauderdale Sentinel and staring with subwayish blankness at other people. A kid whose T-shirt says SANDY DUNCAN\x{2019}S EYE is carving something in the plastic of his chair. There are quite a few old people all travelling with really desperately old people who are pretty clearly the old people\x{2019}s parents. A couple different guys in different rows are field-stripping their camcorders with military-looking expertise. There\x{2019}s a fair share of WASP-looking passengers, as well. A lot of the WASPs are couples in their twenties and thirties, with a honeymoonish aspect to the way their heads rest on each other\x{2019}s shoulders. Men after a certain age simply should not wear shorts, I\x{2019}ve decided; their legs are hairless in a way that\x{2019}s creepy; the skin seems denuded and practically crying out for hair, particularly on the calves. It\x{2019}s just about the only body-area where you actually want more hair on older men. Is this fibular hairlessness a result of years of chafing in pants and socks? The significance of the numbered cards turns out to be that you\x{2019}re supposed to wait here in Pier 21\x{2019}s blimp hangar until your number is called, then you board in \x{201c}Lots.\x{201d}   So your number doesn\x{2019}t stand for you, but rather for the subherd of cruisers you\x{2019}re part of. Some 7NC-veterans nearby tell me that 7 is not a great Lot-number and advise me to get comfortable. Somewhere past the big gray doors behind the restrooms\x{2019} roiling lines is an umbilical passage leading to what I assume is the actual Nadir, which outside the south wall\x{2019}s windows presents as a tall wall of total white. In the approximate center of the hangar is a long table where creamy-complected women in nursish white from Steiner of London Inc. are doing free little makeup and complexion consultations with women waiting to board, priming the economic pump.   The Chicago lady and BIG DADDY are in the hangar\x{2019}s southeasternmost row of chairs playing Uno with another couple, who turn out to be friends they\x{2019}d made on a Princess Alaska Cruise in \x{2019}93.",

If you back off from something really big, the creamy ladies then try to sell you on a facial, which they say \x{201c}a great large number\x{201d} of male Nadirites have pampered themselves with this week, but I also decline the facial, figuring that at this point in the week the procedure for me would consist mostly in exfoliating half-peeled skin. <<1425h|1>>.: Now I\x{2019}m in the small public loo of the Olympic Health Club, a one-holer notable only because O.

            "I swear I am not exaggerating: this occasion is a real two-handed head-clutcher, awesome in its ickiness. But now, just as I need to leave in order not to be late for <<1500h|1>>.\x{2019}s much-anticipated skeetshooting, Scott Peterson starts to relate an anecdote that engages my various onboard dreads and fascinations enough for me to stay and try to write down. Scott Peterson tells us how his wife, Mrs. Scott Peterson, was in the shower in the Mr. and Mrs. Scott Peterson Suite on Deck 3 of the Nadir the other night when\x{2014}one hand goes up in the gesture of someone searching for just the right delicate term\x{2014}when nature called. So Mrs. Scott Peterson apparently gets out of the shower still wet and sits down on Scott Peterson\x{2019}s stateroom\x{2019}s bathroom\x{2019}s commode. Scott Peterson, in a narrative aside, says how perhaps we\x{2019}ve all noticed that the commodes on the m.v. Nadir are linked to a state-of-the-art Vacuum Sewage System that happens to generate not a weak or incidental flush-suction. Other Nadirites besides just me must fear their toilet, because this gets a big jagged tension-related laugh. Mrs. Scott Peterson   is sinking lower and lower in her salmon-colored chair. Scott Peterson says but so Mrs. Scott Peterson sits down on the commode, still naked and wet from the shower, and attends to nature\x{2019}s summons, and when she\x{2019}s done she reaches over and hits the commode\x{2019}s Flush mechanism, and Scott Peterson says that, in Mrs. Scott Peterson\x{2019}s wet slick condition, the incredible suction of the Nadir\x{2019}s state-of-the-art V.S.S. starts actually pulling her down through the seat\x{2019}s central hole,   and apparently Mrs. Scott Peterson is just a bit too broad abeam to get sucked down all the way and hurled into some abstract excremental void but rather sticks, wedged, halfway down in the seat\x{2019}s hole, and can\x{2019}t get out, and is of course stark naked, and starts screeching for help (by now the live Mrs. Scott Peterson seems very interested in something going on down underneath her table, and mostly only her left shoulder\x{2014}leather-brown and stippled with freckles\x{2014}is visible from where I\x{2019}m sitting); and Scott Peterson tells us that he, Scott Peterson, hears her and comes rushing into the bathroom from the stateroom where he\x{2019}d been practicing his Professional Smile in the bedside table\x{2019}s enormous vanity mirror,   comes rushing in and sees what\x{2019}s happened to Mrs. Scott Peterson and tries to pull her out\x{2014}her feet kicking pathetically and buttocks and popliteals purpling from the seat\x{2019}s adhesive pressure\x{2014}but he can\x{2019}t pull her out, she\x{2019}s been wedged in too tight by the horrific V.S.S. suction, and so thanks to some quick thinking Scott Peterson gets on the phone and calls one of the Nadir\x{2019}s Staff Plumbers, and the Staff Plumber says Yes Sir Mr. Scott Peterson Sir I\x{2019}m on my way, and Scott Peterson runs back into the bathroom and reports to Mrs. Scott Peterson that professional help is on the way, at which point it only then occurs to Mrs. Scott Peterson that she\x{2019}s starkers, and that not only are her ectomorphic breasts exposed to full Eurofluorescent view but a portion of her own personal pudendum is clearly visible above the rim of the occlusive seat that holds her fast,   and she screeches Britishly at Scott Peterson to for the bloody love of Christ do something to cover her legally betrothed nethers against the swart blue-collar gaze of the impending Staff Plumber, and so Scott Peterson goes and gets Mrs. Scott Peterson\x{2019}s favorite sun hat, a huge sombrero, in fact the very same huge sombrero Scott Peterson\x{2019}s beloved wife is wearing right\x{2026} umm, just a couple seconds ago was wearing right here in this very Rainbow Room; and but so via the quick and resourceful thinking of Scott Peterson the sombrero is brought from the stateroom into the bathroom and placed over Mrs. Scott Peterson\x{2019}s inbent concave naked thorax, to cover her private parts. And the Nadir\x{2019}s Staff Plumber knocks and comes in all overlarge and machine-oil-redolent, w/ tool-belt ajingle, and badly out of breath, and sure enough swart, and he comes into the bathroom and appraises the situation and takes certain complex measurements and performs some calculations and finally tells Mr. Scott Peterson that he thinks he (the Staff Plumber) can get indeed get Mrs. Scott Peterson out of the toilet seat, but that extracting that there Mexican fellow in there with Mrs. S.P. is going to be a whole nother story.",

Cruise Director \x{201c}Dave the Bingo Boy\x{201d} is coordinating activities from a canvas director\x{2019}s chair at stage left. A septuagenarian from Halifax VA tells four ethnic jokes and sings \x{201c}One Day at a Time (Sweet Jesus).\x{201d} A retired Century 21 Realtor from Idaho does a long drum solo to \x{201c}Caravan.\x{201d} The climactic Passenger Talent Show is apparently a 7NC tradition, as was Tuesday night\x{2019}s Special Costume Party.   Some of the Nadirites are deeply into this stuff and have brought their own costumes, music, props. A lithe Canadian couple does a tango complete w/ pointy black shoes and an interdental rose. Then the finale of the P.T.S. is apparently going to be four consecutive stand-up comedy routines delivered by very old men. These men totter on one after the other. One has one of those three-footed canes, another a necktie that looks uncannily like a Denver omelette, another an excruciating stutter. What follow are four successive interchangeable routines where the manner and humor are like exhumed time capsules of the 1950s: jokes about how impossible it is to understand women, about how very much men want to play golf and how their wives try to keep them from playing golf, etc. The routines have the same kind of flamboyant unhipness that makes my own grandparents objects of my pity, awe, and embarrassment all at once. One of the senescent quartet refers to his appearance tomorrow night as a \x{201c}gig.\x{201d} The one with the tridential cane stops suddenly in the middle of a long joke about skipping his wife\x{2019}s funeral to play golf and, pointing the cane\x{2019}s tips at Dave the Bingo Boy, demands an immediate and accurate estimate of what the attendance will be for tomorrow night\x{2019}s Passenger Talent Show. Dave the Bingo Boy sort of shrugs and looks at his emery board and says that it\x{2019}s hard to say, that it like varies week to week, whereupon the old guy kind of brandishes his cane and says well it better be substantial because he goddamn well hates playing to an empty house.",

            "For me, at the end of a full day of Managed Fun, Nigel Ellery\x{2019}s act is not particularly astounding or side-splitting or entertaining\x{2014}but neither is it depressing or offensive or despair-fraught. What it is is weird. It\x{2019}s the same sort of weird feeling that having an elusive word on the tip of your tongue evokes. There\x{2019}s something crucially key about Luxury Cruises in evidence here: being entertained by someone who clearly dislikes you, and feeling that you deserve the dislike at the same time that you resent it. All six subjects are now lined up doing syncopated Rockette kicks, and the show is approaching its climax, Nigel Ellery at the microphone getting us ready for something that will apparently involve furiously flapping arms and the astounding mesmeric illusion of flight. Because my own dangerous susceptibility makes it important that I not follow Ellery\x{2019}s hypnotic suggestions too closely or get too deeply involved, I find myself, in my comfortable navy-blue seat, going farther and farther away inside my head, sort of Creatively Visualizing a kind of epiphanic Frank Conroy-type moment of my own, pulling mentally back, seeing the hypnotist and subjects and audience and Celebrity Show Lounge and deck and then whole motorized vessel itself with the eyes of someone not aboard, visualizing the m.v. Nadir at night, right at this moment, steaming north at 21.4 knots, with a strong warm west wind pulling the moon backwards through a skein of clouds, hearing muffled laughter and music and Papas\x{2019} throb and the hiss of receding wake and seeing, from the perspective of this nighttime sea, the good old Nadir complexly aglow, angelically white, lit up from within, festive, imperial, palatial\x{2026} yes, this: like a palace: it would look like a kind of floating palace, majestic and terrible, to any poor soul out here on the ocean at night, alone in a dinghy, or not even in a dinghy but simply and terribly floating, a man overboard, treading water, out of sight of all land. This deep and creative visual trance\x{2014}N. Ellery\x{2019}s true and accidental gift to me\x{2014}lasted all through the next day and night, which period I spent entirely in Cabin 1009, in bed, mostly looking out the spotless porthole, with trays and various rinds all around me, feeling maybe a little bit glassy-eyed but mostly good\x{2014}good to be on the Nadir and good soon to be off, good that I had survived (in a way) being pampered to death (in a way)\x{2014}and so I stayed in bed. And even though the tranced stasis caused me to miss the final night\x{2019}s climactic P.T.S. and the Farewell <<Midnight|13>> Buffet and then Saturday\x{2019}s docking and a chance to have my After photo taken with Captain G.

            "An important variable I\x{2019}m skipping is that children are (not surprisingly) immature and tend to get angry with themselves when they screw up, and so a key part of my strategy involved putting the opponent in a position where he made a lot of unforced errors and got madder and madder at himself, which would ruin his game. Feelings of self-disgust at his errors, or (even better for me) bitter grievance at the universe for making him have \x{201c}bad luck\x{201d} or an \x{201c}offday\x{201d} would mount until usually by sometime in the second set he\x{2019}d sink into a kind of enraged torpor and expect to miss, or occasionally he\x{2019}d even have a kind of grand Learesque tantrum, complete with racquet-hurling and screamed obscenities and sometimes tears. This happened less and less as I got older and opponents got more mature, and by the time I was in college only genuine head-cases could be counted on to get so mad that they\x{2019}d basically make themselves lose to an inferior player (viz. me). It\x{2019}s something of a shock, then, to watch Joyce do to his third-round Qualies opponent what I used to do to twelve-year-old rich kids, which is essentially to retrieve and avoid errors and wait for this opponent to have a temper tantrum. Because Sunday was a rainout, Joyce\x{2019}s third round is played Monday at <<10:00 A.M.|2a>>, at the same time that some of the main draw\x{2019}s first rounds are beginning. Joyce\x{2019}s opponent is a guy named Mark Knowles, 25, the 1986 U.S. Junior Indoor Champion, a native of the Bahamas, now known primarily as a doubles player but still a serious opponent, ranked in the world\x{2019}s top 200, somebody on Joyce\x{2019}s plateau.",
