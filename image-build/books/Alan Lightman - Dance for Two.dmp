But the problem here is not simply the lack of wings. Scale up a pheasant to the size of a man and it would plummet to earth like a rock. Or consider Icarus. In the very plausible picture of him in my childhood mythology book, each attached wing equals his height and is about one quarter as wide\x{2014}not unlike the graceful proportions of a swallow. Unfortunately, to fly with those wings the boy would have to beat his arms at <<one|9c:0>> and a half horsepower, four times the maximum sustained output of an athletic human being.

            "What is shocking about the 1932 paper is that Landau, without warning and in a single sentence, dismisses a major branch of physics. The paper concerns a theoretical investigation of the structure attained by stars in balancing their inward gravitational forces against their outward pressure forces. For the burned-out stars Landau was considering, the outward pressure forces are prescribed by quantum mechanics, the theory of matter at the atomic level. By <<1932|9n:0>> the laws of quantum mechanics had been firmly established and ranked beside Einstein\x{2019}s relativity as the foundation for modern physics. To Landau\x{2019}s dismay, his calculations predicted that burned-out stars cannot avoid complete inward collapse if slightly more massive than the sun. That is, in sufficiently massive cold stars no amount of internal pressure can counterbalance the inward crush of gravity, leading to a frantic contraction of the star from a sphere a million miles or more across down to a point. Landau then writes: \x{201c}As in reality such masses exist quietly as stars and do not show any such ridiculous tendencies, we must conclude that\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}the laws of quantum mechanics are violated.\x{201d} (Sir Arthur Eddington made an almost identical remark at a Royal Astronomical Society meeting in 1935, upon reviewing calculations by S. Chandrasekhar that independently reached the same conclusions about cold stars.)",

            "Kepler had the good fortune of being the student of Tycho Brahe, a wealthy Danish astronomer who spent night after night observing the planets from his private island. Brahe\x{2019}s naked-eye reckonings of planetary positions were the most accurate ever taken. Kepler inherited this gold mine of data <<around 1600|18:0>>. His job was to make sense of it. In addition to having good material to work with, Kepler owed his success to two other factors: he was a dedicated Copernican, and he believed in the Platonist ideal that nature follows mathematically simple laws. What were the laws governing the motions of the planets? What were the shapes of the orbits? Kepler struggled with countless trial orbits of compounded circles. Eventually, he was forced to admit that they just wouldn\x{2019}t fit Brahe\x{2019}s data. Then he discovered ellipses. (Every artist knows the ellipse; it is a foreshortened circle.) One ellipse for each planetary orbit was also much simpler than two circles. The sacred circle had been replaced by the accurate and economical ellipse.",
