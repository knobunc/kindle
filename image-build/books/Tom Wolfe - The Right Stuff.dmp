            "A riveting subject, especially if it were one\x{2019}s own hide that was on the line. Every evening at bases all over America, there were military pilots huddled in officers clubs eagerly cutting the right stuff up in coded slices so they could talk about it. What more compelling topic of conversation was there in the world? In the Air Force there were even pilots who would ask the tower for priority landing clearance so that they could make the beer call on time, at <<4 p.m.|5>> sharp, at the Officers Club. They would come right out and state the reason. The drunken rambles began at <<four|9c:1>> and sometimes went on for ten or twelve hours. Such conversations! They diced that righteous stuff up into little bits, bowed ironically to it, stumbled blindfolded around it, groped, lurched, belched, staggered, bawled, sang, roared, and feinted at it with self-deprecating humor. Nevertheless!\x{2014}they never mentioned it by name. No, they used
the approved codes, such as: \x{201c}Like a jerk I got myself into a hell of a corner today.\x{201d} They told of how they \x{201c}lucked out of it.\x{201d} To get across the extreme peril of his exploit, one would use certain oblique cues. He would say, \x{201c}I looked over at Robinson\x{201d}\x{2014}who would be known to the listeners as a non-com who sometimes rode backseat to read radar\x{2014}\x{201c}and he wasn\x{2019}t talking any more, he was just staring at the radar, like this, giving it that zombie look. Then I knew I was in trouble!\x{201d} Beautiful! Just right! For it would also be known to the listeners that the non-coms advised one another: \x{201c}Never fly with a lieutenant. Avoid captains and majors. Hell, man, do yourself a favor: don\x{2019}t fly with anybody below colonel.\x{201d} Which in turn said: \x{201c}Those young bucks shoot dice with death!\x{201d} And yet once in the air the non-com had his own standards. He was determined to remain as outwardly cool as the pilot, so that when the pilot did something that truly petrified him, he would say nothing; instead, he would turn silent, catatonic, like a zombie. Perfect! Zombie. There you had it, compressed into a single word, all of the foregoing. I\x{2019}m a hell of a pilot! I shoot dice with death! And now all you fellows know it! And I haven\x{2019}t spoken of that unspoken stuff even once!",

he and Glennis saddled up a couple of Pancho\x{2019}s dude-ranch horses and went for a romp, a little rat race, in the moonlight. This was in keeping with the military tradition of Flying & Drinking and Drinking & Driving, except that this was prehistoric Muroc and you rode horses. So Yeager and his wife set off on a little proficiency run at full gallop through the desert in the moonlight amid the arthritic silhouettes of the Joshua trees. Then they start racing back to the corral, with Yeager in the lead and heading for the gateway. Given the prevailing conditions, it being nighttime, at Pancho\x{2019}s, and his head being filled with a black sandstorm of many badly bawled songs and vulcanized oaths, he sees too late that the gate has been closed. Like many a hard-driving <<midnight|13>> pilot before him, he does not realize that he is not equally gifted in the control of all forms of locomotion. He and the horse hit the gate, and he goes flying off and lands on his right side. His side hurts like hell.",

In the skids, the tumbles, the spins, there was, truly, as Saint-Exup\x{e9}ry had said, only one thing you could let yourself think about: What do I do next? Sometimes at Edwards they used to play the tapes of pilots going into the final dive, the one that killed them, and the man would be tumbling, going end over end in a fifteen-ton length of pipe, with all aerodynamics long gone, and not one prayer left, and he knew it, and he would be screaming into the microphone, but not for Mother or for God or the nameless spirit of Ahor, but for one last hopeless crumb of information about the loop: \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve tried A!

If he were well liked, he might get one of those dusty stretches of road named for him on the base. He was probably a junior officer doing all this for four or five thousand a year.

            "The probings of the bowels seemed to be endless, full proctosigmoidoscope examinations, the works. These things were never pleasant; in fact, they were a bit humiliating, involving, as they did, various things being shoved up your tail. The Lovelace Clinic specialty seemed to be the exacting of maximum indignity from each procedure. The pilots had never run into anything like this before. Not only that, before each ream-out you had to report to the clinic at <<seven o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> and give yourself an enema. Up yours! seemed to be the motto of the Lovelace Clinic\x{2014}and they even made you do it to yourself. So Conrad reports at <<seven|3b>> one morning and gives himself the enema. He\x{2019}s supposed to undergo a lower gastrointestinal tract examination that morning. In the so-called lower G.I. examination, barium is pumped into the subject\x{2019}s bowels; then a little hose with a balloon on the end of it is inserted in the
rectum, and the balloon is inflated, blocking the canal to keep the barium from forcing its way out before the radiologist can complete his examination. After the examination, like everyone who has ever been through the procedure, Conrad now feels as if there are eighty-five pounds of barium in his intestines and they are about to explode. The Smocks inform him that there is no john on this floor. He\x{2019}s supposed to pick up the tube that is coming out of his rectum and follow an orderly, who will lead him to a john two floors below. On the tube there is a clamp, and he can release the clamp, deflating the balloon, at the proper time. It\x{2019}s unbelievable! To try to walk, with this explosive load sloshing about in your pelvic saddle, is agony. Nevertheless, Conrad picks up the tube and follows the orderly. Conrad has on only the standard bed patient\x{2019}s tunic, the angel robes, open up the back. The tube leading out of his tail to the balloon gizmo is so short that he has to hunch over to about two feet off the floor to carry it in front of him. His tail is now, as the saying goes, flapping in the breeze, with a tube coming out of it. The orderly has on red cowboy boots. Conrad is intensely aware of that fact, because he is now hunched over so far that his eyes hit the orderly at about calf level. He\x{2019}s hunched over, with his tail in the breeze, scuttling like a crab after a pair of red cowboy boots. Out into a corridor they go, an ordinary public corridor, the full-moon hunchback and the red cowboy boots, amid men, women, children, nurses, nuns, the lot. The red cowboy boots are beginning to trot along like mad. The orderly is no fool. He\x{2019}s been through this before. He\x{2019}s been through the whole disaster. He\x{2019}s seen the explosions. Time is of the essence. There\x{2019}s a hunchback stick of dynamite behind him. To Conrad it becomes more incredible every step of the way. They actually have to go down an elevator\x{2014}full of sane people\x{2014}and do their crazy tango through another public hallway\x{2014}agog with normal human beings\x{2014}before finally reaching the goddamned john.",

His mother used to take the family to the Church of Christ, a Protestant denomination that was so fundamentalist no musical instruments were allowed in the church, not even a piano. The human voice raising thanks to God was music enough. Not that Gus was much of a singer, either, however. His public incantations consisted mainly of Hoosier gus gruffisms. He was a short man with sloping shoulders, a compact build, black crew-cut hair, and black bushy eyebrows, a broad nose, and a face given to very dour looks. The only time Gus felt like talking was when he was with other pilots, particularly at beer call. Then he became another human being. His sleepy eyes lit up to about 200 watts.

            "Other men would no doubt go farther into space, into earth orbit and beyond. But they, in turn, would be chosen from the first men to fly suborbitally; so the first astronaut would be the one the world remembered. When a man realized something like that, there was no use being shy about the opportunity he had. Glenn had not gotten this far in his career by standing still in a saintly fashion and waiting for his halo to be noticed. When he reached Korea, flying strafing and bombing missions in support of Marine ground troops, he realized that the biggest accolade was being assigned to Air Force fighter squadrons, on loan (like Schirra), for air-to-air combat up at the Yalu River. So he had gone after that assignment and had gotten it and had shot down three MiGs during the last few days of the war. As soon as the war ended, he realized that flight test was the hot new arena and had gone straight to his superiors and asked to be assigned to the Navy\x{2019}s Patuxent River Test Pilot School, and they sent him there. He had been in flight test barely three years when he dreamed up the F8U transcontinental run. He dreamed it up himself, as a major in the Marines! Although everyone knew it was possible, no one had ever made a sustained coast-to-coast flight at an average speed of greater than Mach 1. Glenn developed the whole scheme, the aerial rendezvous with three different AJ1 refueling tankers, the way he would dive down to 22,000 feet to meet them, the whole thing. He pulled it off on July 16, 1957, flying from Los Angeles to Floyd Bennett Field in New York, in <<three hours and twenty-three minutes|14>>. The word was that there were some test pilots who
were put out because he got the assignment. They seemed to think they had done the major test work on the F8U, and so forth and so on. But it was his idea! He got it launched! If he hadn\x{2019}t put himself forward, it wouldn\x{2019}t have happened at all. Last year, 1958, it was obvious to him that all the services were working on the problems of manned space flight. There was no Project Mercury yet, and no one knew who would be running the show when a manned program began. All he knew was that it was not likely to be the Marines but he wanted to play a part in it. So he had himself assigned to the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. He volunteered for runs on the Navy\x{2019}s human centrifuge machine at Johnsville, Pennsylvania, exploring the high g-forces associated with rocket flight. By March of this year, 1959, just a month before the seven of them were selected as astronauts, he had been at the McDonnell Aircraft plant in St. Louis as a representative of the Bureau of Aeronautics on a NASA Mockup Review Board, reviewing progress of the manufacture of the Mercury capsule. He didn\x{2019}t know just how the seven of them were selected \x{2026} but obviously all that hadn\x{2019}t hurt his chances.",

It was assumed\x{2014}and the Genteel Beast kept underlining the point\x{2014}that the seven astronauts were the greatest pilots and bravest men in America precisely because of the wholesome circumstances of their backgrounds: small towns, Protestant values, strong families, the simple life. Henry Luce, Life\x{2019}s founder and boss of bosses, had not played a major role, other than parting with the money, in making the astronaut deal, but eventually he came to look upon them as his boys. Luce was a great Presbyterian, and the Mercury astronauts looked like seven incarnations of Presbyterianism. This was no rural-American miracle, however. It was John Glenn who had set the moral tone of the Astronaut at the first press conference. The others had diplomatically kept their mouths shut ever since.

Such computers had not been in production before <<1951|9c:0>>, and yet here it was, 1960 and engineers were already devising systems for guiding rockets into space, through the use of computers built into the engines and connected to accelerometers, for monitoring the temperature, pressure, oxygen supply, and other vital conditions of the Mercury capsule and for triggering safety procedures automatically\x{2014}meaning they were creating, with computers, systems in
which machines could communicate with one another, make decisions, take action, all with tremendous speed and accuracy \x{2026}",

            "The scientists and engineers took it for granted that the training of the astronauts would be unlike anything ordinarily thought of as flight training. Flight training consisted of teaching a man how to take certain actions. He was taught how to control an unfamiliar craft or how to put a familiar craft through unfamiliar maneuvers, such as bombing runs or carrier landings. On the other hand, the only actions the astronauts would have to learn how to take would be to initiate the emergency
procedures in the case of a bad rocket launch or a bad landing and to step in as a backup (redundant component) if the automatic control system failed to hold the heatshield in the correct position prior to re-entry through the earth\x{2019}s atmosphere. The astronaut would not be able to control the path or the speed of the capsule at all. A considerable part of his training would be what was known as de-conditioning, de-sensitizing, or adapting out fears. There was a principle in psychology that maintained that \x{201c}bad habits, including overstrong emotionality, can be eliminated by a graded series of exposures to the anxiety-arousing stimulus.\x{201d} That was what much of astronaut training was to be. The rocket launch was regarded as a novel and possibly disorienting event, in part because the astronaut would have no control over it whatsoever. So they had devised \x{201c}a graded series of exposures.\x{201d} They took the seven men to the Navy\x{2019}s human centrifuge facility in Johnsville, Pennsylvania. The centrifuge looked like a Wild Bolo ride; it had a fifty-foot arm with a cockpit, or gondola, on the end of it, and the arm could be whirled around at astonishing speeds, great enough to put up to 40 g\x{2019}s of pressure on the rider inside the gondola, one g being equal to the force of gravity. The high g-forces generated by combat aircraft in dives and turns during the Second World War had sometimes caused blackouts, red-outs, gray-outs, or made it impossible for pilots to lift their hands to the controls; the giant centrifuge at Johnsville had been built to explore this new problem of high-speed flight. By <<1959|9n:0>> the machine had been computerized and turned into a simulator capable of duplicating the g-forces and accelerations of any form of flight, even rocket flight. The astronaut was helped into his full pressure suit, with his biosensors attached and his rectal thermometer inserted, and then placed into the gondola, in a contoured seat molded for his body, whereupon all the wires, hoses, and microphones he would have in actual flight were hooked up, and the gondola was depressurized to five pounds per square inch, as it would be in space flight. The interior of the gondola had been converted into a replica of the Mercury capsule\x{2019}s interior, with all the switches and console displays. The taped noise of an actual Redstone rocket firing was played over the astronaut\x{2019}s headset, and the ride began. Using the computers, the engineers would put the man through an entire Mercury flight profile. The centrifuge built up the g-forces at precisely the same
rate they would build up in flight, up to six or seven g\x{2019}s, whereupon the g-forces would suddenly drop off, as they would in flight as the capsule went over the top of its arc, and the astronaut experienced a tumbling sensation, as he would, presumably, in flight. All the while the astronaut would be required to push a few switches, as he would in actual flight, and talk to a mock flight controller, forcing his words out into the microphone, no matter how great the pressure of the g-forces on his chest. The centrifuge could also duplicate the pressures of deceleration a man would experience during the return through the earth\x{2019}s atmosphere.",

            "Gordon Cooper had been frowned upon a few months before when he complained about the lack of supersonic fighter planes for \x{201c}proficiency\x{201d} flying, but now the boys took up his complaint within the corridors of NASA, with Slayton and Schirra leading the way and Voas arguing their case for them. Soon they had two F\x{2013}102s on loan from the Air Force. The ships were somewhat the worse for wear, however\x{2014}absolute junkers, in fact, in the eyes of the seven pilots. The Air Force had sloughed these wrecks off on them like hand-me-downs. The poor condition of the F\x{2013}102s wasn\x{2019}t the worst of it, however. The galling thing was that the F\x{2013}102, which had been one of the first in the Century series, was by now a back number. It would go supersonic but just barely, Mach <<1.25|5a:0>> being about top speed. Wally Schirra knew how to formulate the argument on this score. Wally was not merely an expert prankster; he could also turn stern and bang the table and conjure up the aura of the right stuff and its privileges and prerequisites without once uttering the unspoken things. Wally would say to the brass: You\x{2019}re presenting us to the American people as the seven best test pilots in America, and we are among the best, all the p.r. aside, and yet you\x{2019}re not even giving us the opportunity to keep up our proficiency! Before I joined this program I was flying fighter aircraft capable of Mach 2 or better. And now we\x{2019}re supposed to keep up our proficiency
with a couple of old clunkers that will hardly go Mach 1 even when they\x{2019}re in half-decent shape. It doesn\x{2019}t make any sense! It\x{2019}s as if you decided to prepare a major-league ball club for World Series competition by having them take a year off to play against a bunch of old crocks in a Parks & Recreation league in south Jersey. Wally was terrific in moments like this; and by and by, the boys would get a couple of F\x{2013}106s, which were second-generation F\x{2013}102s and capable of Mach 2.3. In the meantime, they tried to make do with the F\x{2013}102s. But, hell, even flying F\x{2013}102s was a big step beyond the original training agenda\x{2014}which assumed that proficiency flights of whatever sort would be of no use for the astronaut in Project Mercury. Nor had this assumption yet died, Wally and Deke or no Wally and Deke.",

            "At that, Walker\x{2019}s place looked like a little bit of heaven compared to Bob White\x{2019}s. But then, on the surface, Walker and White were different in every respect. White, who was a major, was the Air Force\x{2019}s prime pilot for the X\x{2013}15 project. He was the eternally correct and reserved Air Force blue-suiter. He didn\x{2019}t drink. He exercised like a college athlete in training. He was religious. He was an usher in the Roman Catholic chapel of the base and never, but never, missed Mass. He was slender, black-haired, handsome, intelligent\x{2014}even cultivated, if the truth were known. And he was terribly serious. He was not a beer-call fighter jock. Not many people picked out Bob White to just shoot the breeze with. White and his family lived on the base itself at 116 Thirteenth Street in a miserable grid of military housing plots known as the Wherry housing section. Or it had been known as Wherry at the outset. By <<1960|9n:0>> it was usually referred to as Weary housing. Children grew up there thinking that Weary housing was the real name. Parked out front of White\x{2019}s place was an unpainted Model A Ford. The Air Force, being the newest branch of the service, was strong on instant tradition. This old junker, the Ford, was bestowed, as an ironic sculpture of the Right Stuff, upon whomever was the number-one Air Force test pilot at Edwards. Scott Crossfield, the prime pilot for the manufacturer, North American, had completed the first phase of testing the X\x{2013}15, checking out the power system and basic aerodynamics. White and Walker had been chosen to
push the rocket plane to its outer limits, which were envisioned as speeds in excess of Mach 6, or about 4,000 miles per hour, and, more important, an altitude of 280,000 feet. Just where \x{201c}space\x{201d} began was a matter of definition that had never been fully resolved. But fifty miles up was generally accepted as the boundary line. There was very little atmosphere left at that altitude; in fact, once a ship reached 100,000 feet, there was not enough air remaining to provide aerodynamics. The X\x{2013}15\x{2019}s target of 280,000 feet was 53 miles up.",

            "On May 7 Walker had cut loose the X\x{2013}15 on its first real speed run with the Little Engine and reached Mach <<3.19|5a:1>> or 2,111 miles an hour, just a shade faster than Mel Apt\x{2019}s world record of 2,094 miles an hour in the X\x{2013}2. On May 19 Bob White took the X\x{2013}15 on its first bid for maximum altitude with the Little Engine and reached 109,000 feet, which was 17,000 feet under Iven Kincheloe\x{2019}s record in the X\x{2013}2. And that was another point that everybody should have known about \x{2026} and didn\x{2019}t. Kinch and Mel were now dead. Mel Apt died just a few minutes after he set his world speed record, the victim of a demon that was waiting especially for rocket ships reaching speeds of Mach 2 or more in the thin air up around 70,000 feet: instability in the yaw or roll axis \x{2026} followed by an uncontrollable tumble. Sometimes it took the form of \x{201c}inertia coupling,\x{201d} which usually occurred when a pilot tried to bank a rocket ship and it snapped into a full roll and then began pitching and yawing\x{2014}and rolling violently. This would throw it end over end. Some pilots felt that the formal term \x{201c}inertia coupling\x{201d} added damned little to your understanding of the phenomenon. The ship simply \x{201c}uncorked\x{201d} (as Crossfield liked to put it) and lost all semblance of aerodynamics and fell out of the sky like a bottle or a length of pipe. There was no way to maneuver out of a rocket-plane tumble. The pilot took a furious beating from the g-forces and from being thrown about the cockpit. The more he experimented with the controls, the worse fix he was in. Yeager had been the first rocket pilot to go through this particular hole in the supersonic envelope, and it was during the flight in the X\x{2013}IA in which he set a speed record of Mach <<2.42|5a:1>>. He was battered unconscious and fell seven miles before hitting the denser atmosphere at 25,000 feet and coming to and managing to put the ship into a spin. That was good; a mere spin he knew how to get out of, and he survived. Kinch went into a tumble during
his record flight and came out of it at low altitude, as Yeager had done. That was just twenty days before Mel Apt augered in. Mel went into the wild tumble and tried to eject, but wasn\x{2019}t able to complete the sequence in the X\x{2013}2. Yeager had always figured it was useless to try to punch out of a rocket plane. Crossfield called it \x{201c}committing suicide to keep from getting killed.\x{201d} Inertia coupling nearly killed Kit Murray in 1954, when he set an altitude record of 94,000 feet in the X\x{2013}IA, and it had hit Joe Walker twice, once in the XF\x{2013}102 and again in the X\x{2013}3.",

After he landed it on Rogers Lake, he cut loose with a cowboy yell that startled everyone on the radio circuit: \x{201c}Yippeeeee!\x{201d} That was Joe Walker. A week later Bob White went up in the X\x{2013}15 and set a new altitude record of 136,500 feet, or slightly more than twenty-five miles. It had been a perfect flight.

wasn\x{2019}t the way it happened on the centrifuge! The g-forces were coming up so fast, driving him back so deep into his seat, he knew he couldn\x{2019}t complete the maneuvers he was supposed to make on the fly-by-wire system. Whether he did them or not on this flight would make no difference as far as his own safety was concerned. This was practice for orbital flights. In orbital flights the one thing the astronaut would be able to do would be to hold the capsule at the proper attitude, the proper angles, if the automatic system malfunctioned. Nevertheless\x{2014}he was behind on the checklist! Falling behind put you on the threshold of fucking up \x{2026} Soon he wouldn\x{2019}t be able to control the capsule\x{2019}s attitude with the manual controls or the fly-by-wire.

The capsule began to swing from side to side as it came through the denser and denser layers of atmosphere, but it was not nearly as rough a ride as the same interval in the centrifuge. He was lying on his back again. If he looked up, he looked straight toward the sky. He tensed his calves and the muscles of his abdomen to counteract the g-forces \x{2026} just as he had a thousand times on the centrifuge \x{2026} He forced his breath out in grunts as the g\x{2019}s pressed down on his chest \x{2026} He grunted out the g readings as they rose on the dial \x{2026} \x{201c}Uhhsix \x{2026} uh seven \x{2026} uhh eight \x{2026} uhh nine \x{2026}\x{201d} Then he kept repeating, kept grunting out the word \x{201c}Ohhkay \x{2026} Ohhkay \x{2026} Ohhkay \x{2026} Ohhkay \x{2026} Ohhkay \x{2026} Ohhkay \x{2026} Ohhkay\x{201d} \x{2026} to let the ground know that the g-forces were on top of him but that he was all right. He could see nothing except indigo out the portholes. He didn\x{2019}t even bother looking. He kept staring at the instrument panel at the big lights that would show the parachutes were coming out. They would come out automatically. The first green light came on. The drogue chute, the parachute that pulled the main chute out, had deployed. Now Shepard could see it through the periscope. He could see the needle pass 20,000 on his altimeter. Why doesn\x{2019}t it\x{2014} At 10,000 feet the main chute came
out, as he could see through the periscope. Then it filled and the jolt slammed him back into his seat once more. A kick in the butt! For reassurance! He knew he had it made. The capsule swayed from side to side under the parachute, but there was nothing to it. He was lying on his back. The landing bag was right underneath his back. He started undoing his knee straps. Get out of all these goddamned straps, hoses, and wires. That was the main thing. He took his face seal hose and oxygen exhaust hoses off his helmet. Through the periscope he could see he was coming closer and closer to the water. It was sunny out there. He was near Bermuda. The ships were all nearby. He could hear them clearly on the radio. Then the blunt end of the capsule hit the water. It was right under his back. The impact drove him back into his seat yet again. It was just like they said it would be! It was about the same jolt you get when you land on the deck of an aircraft carrier. No more than that. The capsule keeled over to the right. The right-hand window was underwater. But he could look out the other one and see his yellow dye marker on the surface of the water. It was released automatically. It made a big yellow stain, so that the rescue helicopters could spot the capsule better. Shepard was busy trying to get himself out of the rest of the rig. Get free! He broke the neck ring seal off his helmet so that he could get the helmet off. He kept looking at the window that was underwater. The capsule was supposed to right itself. The goddamned window stayed underwater. Gurgling! He kept looking all around it for signs of water seeping in. He couldn\x{2019}t see any but he could hear it. It had finally started seeping in on the ape\x{2019}s flight. The goddamned capsule was not made for the water. What a way to blow the whole thing this would be. Bobbing around in the goddamned water in a bucket. The capsule slowly came up vertical. The helicopter was already overhead radioing for instructions. He had it made as long as he didn\x{2019}t fuck it up getting out of the capsule. He opened the door at the top of the capsule, the neck, with a cable device and pulled himself up. A tremendous burst of sunlight hit him, sunlight on the open sea. It was barely <<quarter of ten in the morning|10>>. He was forty miles from Bermuda on a sunny day out in the Atlantic. The noise of the helicopter overhead obliterated every other sound. The crewmen were lowering a rescue sling, which looked like an old-fashioned horse collar, the kind they used to put on dray horses. It
was a big helicopter, an industrial type. It had already hooked onto the capsule and pulled it up out of the water. There were some Marine Corps crewmen inside the helicopter. The noise was overwhelming. They kept staring at him and smiling. It was that glistening look.",

An ape would make the first orbit of the earth for the U.S.A. The prestige of Project Mercury had by now rendered such considerations meaningless.

White was weightless for three minutes during his tremendous arc over the top, as compared to Shepard\x{2019}s and Grissom\x{2019}s five minutes. White saw all the things that Shepard and Grissom saw (and Shepard, only barely) \x{2026} including the entire blue band of atmosphere at the horizon of the earth. Above all, White was a pilot. He controlled his plane\x{2019}s ascent. He used hydrogen-peroxide thrusters to control his attitude once the air became too thin for aileron control\x{2014}the same system of hydrogen-peroxide thrusters that Shepard and Grissom had used\x{2014}and he did it all without benefit of any automatic
backup. And he brought the ship back down through the earth\x{2019}s atmosphere himself \x{2026} and landed it himself on the holy plateau of Edwards \x{2026} on the dome of the world. A rocket pilot (quoth the brethren), but the national press barely noticed.",

He had gone through the same g-forces so many times \x{2026} he hardly noticed them as they built up. It would have bothered him much more if they had been less. Nothing novel! No excitement, please! It took thirteen seconds for the huge rocket to reach transonic speed. The vibrations started. It was just as Shepard and Grissom said: it was much gentler than the centrifuge. He was still lying flat on his back, and the g-forces drove him deeper and deeper into the seat, but it all felt so familiar. He barely noticed it. He kept his eyes on the instrument panel the whole time \x{2026} All quite normal, every little needle and switch in the right place \x{2026} No malevolent instructor feeding Abort problems into the loop \x{2026} As the rocket entered the transonic zone, the vibration became intense. The vibrations all but obliterated the roar of the engines. He was entering the area of \x{201c}max q,\x{201d} maximum aerodynamic pressure, in which the pressure of the shaft of the Atlas forcing its way through the atmosphere at supersonic speed would reach almost a thousand pounds per square foot. Through the cockpit window he could see the sky turning black. Almost 5 g\x{2019}s were driving him back into his seat. And yet \x{2026} easier than the centrifuge \x{2026} All at once he was through max q, as if through a turbulent strait, and the trajectory was smooth and he was supersonic and the rumble of the rocket engines was more muffled than ever and he could hear all the little fans and recorders and the busy little kitchen, the humming little shop \x{2026} The pressure on his chest reached 6 g\x{2019}s. The rocket pitched down. For the first time he could see clouds and the horizon. In a moment\x{2014}there it was\x{2014}the Atlas rocket\x{2019}s two booster engines shut down and were jettisoned from the side of the shaft and his body was slammed forward, as if he were screeching to a halt, and the g-forces suddenly dropped to <<1.25|5a:1>>, almost as if he were on earth and not accelerating at all, but the central sustainer engine and two smaller engines were still driving him up through the atmosphere \x{2026} A flash of white smoke went up past the window \x{2026} No!

The g-forces built up and the capsule whipped up and down. Yet no sooner had it begun than Glenn knew what it was. The weight of the rocket on the launch pad had been 260,000 pounds, most of it oxidizer and fuel, the liquid oxygen and RP-1 fuel. This was being consumed at such a furious rate, about one ton per second, that the rocket was becoming merely a skeleton with a thin skin of metal stretched over it, a tube so long and light that it was flexing. The g-forces reached six and then he was weightless, just like that. The sudden release made him feel as if he were tumbling head over heels, as if he had been catapulted off the end of that same springboard and was falling through the air doing forward rolls. But he had felt this same thing on the centrifuge when they ran the g-forces up to seven and then suddenly cut the speed. At the same moment, right on schedule \x{2026} a loud report \x{2026} the posigrade rockets fired, throwing the capsule free of the rocket shaft \x{2026} the capsule began its automatic turnabout, and all the proper green lights went on in front of him, and he knew he was \x{201c}through the gate,\x{201d} as they said.",

It was hot in here. Even with the suit fans still running, the heat was terrific. Over the radio they kept telling him not to try to leave the capsule. The rescue ship was almost there.

            "At 40,000 feet Yeager began his speed run. He cut in the afterburner and it slammed him back in his seat, and he was now riding an engine with nearly 16,000 pounds of thrust. As soon as the Machmeter hit 2.2, he pulled back on the stick and started the climb. The afterburner would carry him to 60,000 feet before exhausting its fuel. At precisely that moment he threw the switch for the rocket engine \x{2026} terrific jolt \x{2026} He\x{2019}s slammed back in his seat again. The nose pitches up to 70 degrees. The g-forces start rising. The desert sky starts falling away. He\x{2019}s going straight up into the indigo. At 78,000 feet a light on the console \x{2026} as usual \x{2026} the main engine overheating from the tremendous exertion of the climb. He throws the switch, and shuts it down, but the rocket is still accelerating. Who doesn\x{2019}t know this feeling if he doesn\x{2019}t! The bastards are fantastic! \x{2026} One hundred thousand feet \x{2026} He shuts down the rocket engine. He\x{2019}s still climbing. The g-forces slide off \x{2026} makes you feel like you\x{2019}re pitching forward \x{2026} He\x{2019}s weightless, coming over the top of the arc \x{2026} 104,000 feet \x{2026} It\x{2019}s absolutely silent \x{2026} Twenty miles up \x{2026} The sky is almost black. He\x{2019}s looking straight up into it, because the nose of the ship is pitched up. His angle of attack is still about 50 degrees. He\x{2019}s over the top of the arc and coming down. He pushes the sidearm control to bring down the nose of the ship. Nothing
happens \x{2026} He can hear the thruster working but the nose isn\x{2019}t budging. It\x{2019}s still pitched up. He hits the thruster again \x{2026} Shit! \x{2026} She won\x{2019}t go down! \x{2026} Now he can see it, the whole diagram \x{2026} This morning at 108,000 feet the air was so thin it offered no resistance and you could easily push the nose down with the thrusters. At 104,000 feet the air remains just thick enough to exert aerodynamic pressure. The thrusters aren\x{2019}t strong enough to overcome it \x{2026} He keeps hitting the reaction controls \x{2026} The hydrogen peroxide squirts out of the jet on the nose of the ship and doesn\x{2019}t do a goddamned thing \x{2026} He\x{2019}s dropping and the nose is still pitched up \x{2026} The outside of the envelope! \x{2026} well, here it is, the sonofabitch \x{2026} It doesn\x{2019}t want to stretch \x{2026} and here we go! \x{2026} The ship snaps into a flat spin. It\x{2019}s spinning right over its center of gravity, like a pinwheel on a stick. Yeager\x{2019}s head is on the outer edge of the circle, spinning around. He pushes the sidearm control again. The hydrogen peroxide is finished. He has 600 pounds of fuel left in the main engine but there\x{2019}s no way to start it up. To relight the engine you have to put the ship nose down into a dive and force air through the intake duct and start the engine windmilling to build up the rpms. Without rpms there\x{2019}s no hydraulic pressure and without hydraulic pressure you can\x{2019}t move the stabilizer wings on the tail and without the stabilizer wings you can\x{2019}t control this bastard at the lower altitudes \x{2026} He\x{2019}s in a steady-state flat spin and dropping \x{2026} He\x{2019}s whirling around at a terrific rate \x{2026} He makes himself keep his eyes pinned on the instruments \x{2026} A little sightseeing at this point and it\x{2019}s vertigo and you\x{2019}re finished \x{2026} He\x{2019}s down to 80,000 feet and the rpms are at dead zero \x{2026} He\x{2019}s falling 150 feet a second \x{2026} 9,000 feet a minute \x{2026} And what do I do next? \x{2026} here in the jaws of the Gulp \x{2026} I\x{2019}ve tried A!\x{2014}I\x{2019}ve tried B!\x{2014}The damned beast isn\x{2019}t making a sound \x{2026} just spinning around like a length of pipe in the sky \x{2026} He has one last shot \x{2026} the speed brakes, a parachute rig in the tail for slowing the ship down after a highspeed landing \x{2026} The altimeter keeps winding down \x{2026} Twenty-five thousand feet \x{2026} but the altimeter is based on sea level \x{2026} He\x{2019}s only 21,000 feet above the high desert \x{2026} The slack\x{2019}s running out \x{2026} He pops the speed brake \x{2026} Bango!\x{2014}the chute catches with a jolt \x{2026} It pulls the tail up \x{2026} He pitches down \x{2026} The spin stops. The nose is pointed down. Now he only has to jettison the chute and let her
dive and pick up the rpms. He jettisons the chute \x{2026} and the beast heaves up again! The nose goes back up in the air! \x{2026} It\x{2019}s the rear stabilizer wing \x{2026} The leading edge is locked, frozen into the position of the climb to altitude. With no rpms and no hydraulic controls he can\x{2019}t move the tail \x{2026} The nose is pitched way above 30 degrees \x{2026} Here she goes again \x{2026} She\x{2019}s back into the spin \x{2026} He\x{2019}s spinning out on the rim again \x{2026} He has no rpms, no power, no more speed chute, and only 180 knots airspeed \x{2026} He\x{2019}s down to 12,000 feet \x{2026} 8,000 feet above the farm \x{2026} There\x{2019}s not a goddamned thing left in the manual or the bag of tricks or the righteousness of twenty years of military flying \x{2026} Chosen or damned! \x{2026} It blows at any seam! Yeager hasn\x{2019}t bailed out of an airplane since the day he was shot down over Germany when he was twenty \x{2026} I\x{2019}ve tried A!\x{2014}I\x{2019}ve tried B!\x{2014}I\x{2019}ve tried C! \x{2026} 11,000 feet, 7,000 from the farm \x{2026} He hunches himself into a ball, just as it says in the manual, and reaches under the seat for the cinch ring and pulls \x{2026} He\x{2019}s exploded out of the cockpit with such force it\x{2019}s like a concussion \x{2026} He can\x{2019}t see \x{2026} Wham \x{2026} a jolt in the back \x{2026} It\x{2019}s the seat separating from him and the parachute rig \x{2026} His head begins to clear \x{2026} He\x{2019}s in midair, in his pressure suit, looking out through the visor of his helmet \x{2026} Every second seems enormously elongated \x{2026} infinite \x{2026} such slow motion \x{2026} He\x{2019}s suspended in midair \x{2026} weightless \x{2026} The ship had been falling at about 100 miles an hour and the ejection rocket had propelled him up at 90 miles an hour. For one thick adrenal moment he\x{2019}s weightless in midair, 7,000 feet above the desert \x{2026} The seat floats nearby, as if the two of them are parked in the atmosphere \x{2026} The butt of the seat, the underside, is facing him \x{2026} a red hole \x{2026} the socket where the ejection mechanism had been attached \x{2026} It\x{2019}s dribbling a charcoal red \x{2026} lava \x{2026} the remains of the rocket propellant \x{2026} It\x{2019}s glowing \x{2026} it\x{2019}s oozing out of the socket \x{2026} In the next moment they\x{2019}re both falling, he and the seat \x{2026} His parachute rig has a quarter bag over it and on the bag is a drogue chute that pulls the bag off so the parachute will stream out gradually and not break the chute or the pilot\x{2019}s back when the canopy pops open during a high-speed ejection. It\x{2019}s designed for an ejection at <<400|3:0>> or 500 miles an hour, but he\x{2019}s only going about 175. In this infinitely expanded few seconds the lines stream out and Yeager and the rocket seat and the glowing red
socket sail through the air together \x{2026} and now the seat is drifting above him \x{2026} into the chute lines! \x{2026} The seat is nestled in the chute lines \x{2026} dribbling lava out of the socket \x{2026} eating through the lines \x{2026} An infinite second \x{2026} He\x{2019}s jerked up by the shoulders \x{2026} it\x{2019}s the chute opening and the canopy filling \x{2026} in that very instant the lava\x{2014}it smashes into the visor of his helmet \x{2026} Something slices through his left eye \x{2026} He\x{2019}s knocked silly \x{2026} He can\x{2019}t see a goddamned thing \x{2026} The burning snaps him to \x{2026} His left eye is gushing blood \x{2026} It\x{2019}s pouring down inside the lid and down his face and his face is on fire \x{2026} Jesus Christ! \x{2026} the seat rig \x{2026} The jerk of the parachute had suddenly slowed his speed, but the seat kept falling \x{2026} It had fallen out of the chute lines and the butt end crashed into his visor \x{2026} 180 pounds of metal \x{2026} a double visor \x{2026} the goddamned thing has smashed through both layers \x{2026} He\x{2019}s burning! \x{2026} There\x{2019}s rocket lava inside the helmet \x{2026} The seat has fallen away \x{2026} He can\x{2019}t see \x{2026} blood pouring out of his left eye and there\x{2019}s smoke inside the helmet \x{2026} Rubber! \x{2026} It\x{2019}s the seal between the helmet and the pressure suit \x{2026} It\x{2019}s burning up \x{2026} The propellant won\x{2019}t quit \x{2026} A tremendous whoosh \x{2026} He can feel the rush \x{2026} He can even hear it \x{2026} The whole left side of the helmet is full of flames \x{2026} A sheet of flame goes up his neck and the side of his face \x{2026} The oxygen! \x{2026} The propellant has burned through the rubber seal, setting off the pressure suit\x{2019}s automatic oxygen system \x{2026} The integrity of the circuit has been violated and it rushes oxygen to the helmet, to the pilot\x{2019}s face \x{2026} A hundred percent oxygen! Christ! \x{2026} It turns the lava into an inferno \x{2026} Everything that can burn is on fire \x{2026} everything else is melting \x{2026} Even with the hole smashed in the visor the helmet is full of smoke \x{2026} He\x{2019}s choking \x{2026} blinded \x{2026} The left side of his head is on fire \x{2026} He\x{2019}s suffocating \x{2026} He brings up his left hand \x{2026} He has on pressure-suit gloves locked and taped to the sleeve \x{2026} He jams his hand in through the hole in the visor and tries to create an air scoop with it to bring air to his mouth \x{2026} The flames \x{2026} They\x{2019}re all over it \x{2026} They go to work on the glove where it touches his face \x{2026} They devour it \x{2026} His index finger is burning up \x{2026} His goddamned finger is burning! \x{2026} But he doesn\x{2019}t move it \x{2026} Get some air! \x{2026} Nothing else matters \x{2026} He\x{2019}s gulping smoke \x{2026} He has to get the visor open \x{2026} It\x{2019}s twisted \x{2026} He\x{2019}s encased in a little broken globe dying in a cloud of his own fried flesh \x{2026} The stench of it! \x{2026} rubber
and a human hide \x{2026} He has to get the visor open \x{2026} It\x{2019}s that or nothing, no two ways about it \x{2026} It\x{2019}s smashed all to hell \x{2026} He jams both hands underneath \x{2026} It\x{2019}s a tremendous effort \x{2026} It lifts \x{2026} Salvation! \x{2026} Like a sea the air carries it all away, the smoke, the flames \x{2026} The fire is out. He can breathe. He can see out of his right eye. The desert, the mesquite, the motherless Joshua trees are rising slowly toward him \x{2026} He can\x{2019}t open his left eye \x{2026} Now he can feel the pain \x{2026} Half his head is broiled \x{2026} That isn\x{2019}t the worst of it \x{2026} The damned finger! \x{2026} Jesus! \x{2026} He can make out the terrain, he\x{2019}s been over it a million times \x{2026} Over there\x{2019}s the highway, 466, and there\x{2019}s Route 6 crossing it \x{2026} His left glove is practically burned off \x{2026} The glove and his left index finger \x{2026} he can\x{2019}t tell them apart \x{2026} they look as if they exploded in an oven \x{2026} He\x{2019}s not far from base \x{2026} Whatever it is with the finger, it\x{2019}s very bad \x{2026} Nearly down \x{2026} He gets ready \x{2026} Right out of the manual \x{2026} A terrific wallop \x{2026} He\x{2019}s down on the mesquite, looking across the desert, one-eyed \x{2026} He stands up \x{2026} Hell! He\x{2019}s in one piece! \x{2026} He can hardly use his left hand. The goddamn finger is killing him. The whole side of his head \x{2026} He starts taking off the parachute harness \x{2026} It\x{2019}s all in the manual! Regulation issue! \x{2026} He starts rolling up the parachute, just like it says \x{2026} Some of the cords are almost melted through, from the lava \x{2026} His head feels like it\x{2019}s still on fire \x{2026} The pain comes from way down deep \x{2026} But he\x{2019}s got to get the helmet off \x{2026} It\x{2019}s a hell of an operation \x{2026} He doesn\x{2019}t dare touch his head \x{2026} It feels enormous \x{2026} Somebody\x{2019}s running toward him \x{2026} It\x{2019}s a kid, a guy in his twenties \x{2026} He\x{2019}s come from the highway \x{2026} He comes up close and his mouth falls open and he gives Yeager a look of stone horror \x{2026}",
