I think winter-time would have weighed less on our spirits: the drawn curtains, and the bright lamps, and the companionable fires would have helped us. We were only five in the house altogether \x{2013} after having once been so many! I can\x{2019}t tell you how dreary the grey daylight looked, <<towards seven o\x{2019}clock|6>>, in the lonely rooms, and on the noiseless staircase. Surely, the prejudice in favour of long summer evenings, is the prejudice of happy people? We did our best. We kept ourselves employed, and Miss Garth helped us. The prospect of preparing for our departure, which had seemed so dreadful earlier in the day, altered into the prospect of a refuge from ourselves, as the evening came on. We each tried at first to pack up in our own rooms \x{2013} but the loneliness was more than we could bear. We carried all our possessions downstairs, and heaped them on the large dining-table, and so made our preparations together, in the same room. I am sure we have taken nothing away which does not properly belong to us.",

While she was still hesitating, the half-open door of her husband\x{2019}s study attracted her attention. The room seemed to be in sad confusion. Drawers were left open; coats and hats, account-books and papers, pipes and fishing-rods were all scattered about together. She went in, and pushed the door to \x{2013} but so gently that she still left it ajar. \x{2018}It will amuse me to put his room to rights,\x{2019} she thought to herself. \x{2018}I should like to do something for him, before I am down on my bed helpless.\x{2019} She began to arrange his drawers; and found his banker\x{2019}s book lying open in one of them. \x{2018}My poor dear, how careless he is! The servants might have seen all his affairs, if I had not happened to have looked in.\x{2019} She set the drawers right; and then turned to the multifarious litter on a side table. A little old-fashioned music-book appeared among the scattered papers, with her name written in it, in faded ink. She blushed like a young girl in the first happiness of the discovery. \x{2018}How good he is to me! He remembers my poor old music-book, and keeps it for my sake.\x{2019} As she sat down by the table and opened the book, the bygone time came back to her in all its tenderness. The clock struck the half-hour, struck the three-quarters \x{2013} and still she sat there, with the music-book on her lap, dreaming happily over the old songs; thinking gratefully of the golden days when his hand had turned the pages for her, when his voice had whispered the words which no woman\x{2019}s memory ever forgets.",

Captain Wragge seized the brandy bottle, in genuine alarm; and forced his visitor to drink a wine-glassful of the spirit, before a word was said between them on either side.",

He was cheerful at dinner; he reverted to the idea of the cheap little house in France; he smirked and simpered; and talked French to Mrs Lecount, while the housemaid and Louisa waited, turn and turn about, under protest. When dinner was over he returned to his comfortable chair before the fire, and Mrs Lecount followed him. He resumed the conversation \x{2013}  which meant, in his case, repeating his questions. But he was not so quick and ready with them, as he had been earlier in the day. They began to flag \x{2013} they continued, at longer and longer intervals \x{2013} they ceased altogether. <<Towards nine o\x{2019}clock|6>> he fell asleep again.",

The head housemaid happened on that particular morning to be in the same condition as Mrs Drake; and referred her to the under-housemaids. The under-housemaids declared they were all behindhand and had not a minute to spare \x{2013} they suggested, not too civilly, that old Mazey had nothing on earth to do, and that he knew the house as well, or better than he knew his A B C. Magdalen took the hint, with a secret indignation and contempt which it cost her a hard struggle to conceal. She had suspected, on the previous night, and she was certain now, that the women-servants all incomprehensibly resented her presence among them, with the same sullen unanimity of distrust. Mrs Drake, as she had seen for herself, was really engaged that morning over her accounts. But of all the servants under her who had made their excuses, not one had even affected to be more occupied than usual. Their looks said plainly, \x{2018}We don\x{2019}t like you; and we won\x{2019}t show you over the house.\x{2019}",
