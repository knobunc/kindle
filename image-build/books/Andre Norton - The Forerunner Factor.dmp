Instead, drawing upon the skills of her lean body, she jumped, landing only barely on the other rock, fighting desperately for hand- and footholds. Here she lay for a space, breathing fast and staring up into the haze. It was <<midday|13>> or later, and now she was conscious of the heat both of the air and of the rock beneath her.',

The larger they were, the more she could foresee trouble if she kept on a direct course. Then both plants ceased growth abruptly as a last jump landed her on an expanse of what appeared to be ebony-hued glass, so that she slipped in spite of desperate efforts to keep to her feet, sprawling forward, luckily out of reach of those flailing vegetable arms.',

She herself had cut off her past deliberately, and now\x{2014}Was it worth what she had done? That was her last thought before sleep, deep and dreamless, closed upon her. Did she dream? If she did, there was no memory upon awakening. It was Zass\x{2019}s shrilling cry that pulled her out of that depth. The zorsal walked up and down the ledge within an arm\x{2019}s length, her antennae weaving furiously. Plainly, she was disturbed or highly excited.
