            "He wasn\x{2019}t there, either. The house was empty. Probably someone had died, or was about to die. Plenty of times he was called away to do what he could where comforting was needed. The last time it happened he came in the door <<after midnight|13>>, grumbling to himself. He said, \x{201c}Asking a man to apologize on his deathbed for the abject and total disappointment he was in life! That does beat all.\x{201d} He took off his hat. \x{201c}So I took them aside, the family. And I said, If you\x{2019}re not Christian people, then what am I doing here? And if you are, you\x{2019}d better start acting like it. Words to that effect.\x{201d} He looked at her. \x{201c}I know I was harsh. But the poor old devil could hardly get his breath, let alone give his side of things. There were tears in his eyes!\x{201d} He hung up his coat. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve known him my whole life. He wasn\x{2019}t worse than average. Wouldn\x{2019}t matter if he was.\x{201d} And then he said, \x{201c}You shouldn\x{2019}t have waited up for me, Lila. The two of you need your sleep,\x{201d} and he kissed her cheek and went up to his study to pray over the regret he felt because he\x{2019}d lost his temper. Anger was his besetting sin, he said. He was always praying about it. She had thought, If that\x{2019}s the worst of it, I\x{2019}ll be all right.",

            "The clock struck <<eleven|11>>. He always came home for lunch. If she met him at the door he put his arms around her. If there was rain on him he still might not even wait to take his coat off first before he kissed her forehead or her cheek, and she liked the coldness and the good smell. He never asked her how she had spent the morning, but she told him sometimes. Reading a little. Thinking about things. She felt good, and the baby was moving around more than ever, elbows and knees. The old man would look into her face for sadness or weariness, and she would turn her face away, since there was no telling what he might see in it, her thoughts being what they were. She\x{2019}d been thinking that folks are their bodies. And bodies can\x{2019}t be trusted at all. Her own body was so strong with working, for what that was worth. She\x{2019}d known from her childhood there was no use being scared of pain. She was always telling the old man, women have babies, no reason I can\x{2019}t do it. But they both knew things can go wrong. That\x{2019}s how it is. Then there\x{2019}d be poor old Boughton again, if he could even make it up the stairs this time, and there\x{2019}d be Jesus, still keeping His thoughts to Himself. And she\x{2019}d be thinking, Here\x{2019}s my body, dying on me, when I almost promised him I wouldn\x{2019}t let it happen. It might make her believe she was something besides her body, but what was the good of that when she\x{2019}d be gone anyway and there\x{2019}d be nothing in the world that could comfort him. She guessed she really was married to him, the way she hated the thought of him grieving for her. It might even make him give up praying. Then he\x{2019}d hardly be himself anymore.",

            "When that woman at the house in St. Louis asked Lila what she would call herself, since none of them used their own names, she said, \x{201c}Doll, I guess,\x{201d} and the woman snorted, which is how she laughed. She said, \x{201c}We already got a Doll. Had two of them till a couple months ago. The one ran off with some salesman. She\x{2019}ll be back pretty soon. Think she\x{2019}d have better sense. So you ain\x{2019}t Doll. We don\x{2019}t have no Rose just now. Put a little henna in your hair\x{2014}Rose\x{2019}ll do. Ruby. We\x{2019}ll think of something.\x{201d} Her knuckles were big, and her rings hung loose on the bones of her fingers. She was always turning them up the way they were supposed to be, and they wouldn\x{2019}t stay because of the weight of the stones. Bright red, bright green, big as gumdrops. Lila and Mellie used to keep bits of broken glass they found in the road sometimes, and they called them jewels. Why was she thinking about any of this? She was so scared that day, in that parlor with the drapes closed at <<noon|13>> and that damn credenza with the vase of dusty feathers sitting on it. Looking like a coffin. There was a stirring under her heart, so she said to the child, \x{201c}I won\x{2019}t breathe a word to you about that place, but I guess you might know anyway. Because that fear has never left my body, has just hidden in it, waiting. You might feel it, down in your poor little bones. God bless \x{2019}em.\x{201d}",

It came over her, before he had even closed the door behind him, the thought of that house in St. Louis. It was just pure misery. Misery must have been what she was looking for, because she felt it the minute she walked in that door. The twilight of the parlor made her feel as if she had stepped into deep water with her eyes open. Breathing came hard and sound reached her a heartbeat after she should have heard it. She could hardly speak. Nothing was the way it was in daylight, but the place had its own ways and you got used to them. Like death, if something comes after it. That first day there were girls fighting over a hairbrush. Mrs. got up from her chair and went and took the brush away from them and put it in the credenza. When they saw her coming they shrank away from her, watching her. \x{201c}Now,\x{201d} she said when she came back to Lila, \x{201c}you get a safe place to live, so long as you act right. Any trouble and you\x{2019}re gone. I don\x{2019}t like drinking or yelling. I don\x{2019}t want you out on the street. This is a respectable house. Quiet. Our gentlemen like it that way.\x{201d} She called them gentlemen. And the girls were supposed to be ladies.",

            "\x{201c}Oh!\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Then I\x{2019}m glad you have some time to spare. I\x{2019}ve been wondering about that more or less my whole life.\x{201d} He brought her into the kitchen and seated her at the table, and after he had made coffee they sat there together for a while, saying practically nothing. Yes, the weather had been fine. He traced a scratch on the table with his finger. And then he began to tell her about the brother and sisters who died before he was born, and how his mother said once that the stairs were scuffed by the children\x{2019}s shoes because she could never keep them from running in the house. And when she found a scrawl in a book, she said, \x{201c}One of the children must have done it.\x{201d} There was a kind of fondness and sadness in her voice that he heard only when she mentioned them. So when he found a scratch or a mark on something, he still thought, One of the children. His brother Edward, the oldest, was spared the diphtheria that took the rest of them. So Edward knew the children, and he had stories about them. <<One|9k:0>>, closest to him, was named John, a family name. Once, he heard his brother call him Non-John, thinking he was too young to understand. Because Edward missed the brother he had lost, he always did miss him. He was\x{2014}very loyal to him. Their mother and father and grandfather seldom mentioned those children. They could hardly bear to think of them. \x{201c}There\x{2019}s been a good deal of sorrow in this old place,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Some of it mine. Some I used to wish were mine. So I sort of live with the question. Why things happen. I guess this isn\x{2019}t much help.\x{201d}",
