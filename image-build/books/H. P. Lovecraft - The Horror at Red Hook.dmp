            'Malone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more
terrible  than any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by
priests and  philanthropists. He was conscious, as one who united
imagination with scientific  knowledge, that modern people under
lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat  the darkest instinctive
patterns of primitive half-ape savagery in their daily  life and ritual
observances; and he had often viewed with an anthropologist\'s  shudder
the chanting, cursing processions of blear-eyed and pockmarked young
men  which wound their way along in the dark small hours of morning.
One saw groups  of these youths incessantly; sometimes in leering
<<vigils|13>> on street corners,  sometimes in doorways playing eerily on
cheap instruments of music, sometimes in  stupefied dozes or indecent
dialogues around cafeteria tables near Borough Hall,  and sometimes in
whispering converse around dingy taxicabs drawn up at the high  stoops
of crumbling and closely shuttered old houses. They chilled and
fascinated him more than he dared confess to his associates on the
force, for he  seemed to see in them some monstrous thread of secret
continuity; some fiendish,  cryptical, and ancient pattern utterly
beyond and below the sordid mass of facts  and habits and haunts listed
with such conscientious technical care by the  police. They must be, he
felt inwardly, the heirs of some shocking and  primordial tradition;
the sharers of debased and broken scraps from cults and  ceremonies
older than mankind. Their coherence and definiteness suggested it,  and
it shewed in the singular suspicion of order which lurked beneath their
squalid disorder. He had not read in vain such treatises as Miss
Murray\'s  Witch-Cult in Western Europe; and knew that up to recent
years there had  certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a
frightful and clandestine  system of assemblies and orgies descended
from dark religions antedating the  Aryan world, and appearing in
popular legends as Black Masses and Witches\'',

            'Then came the June wedding and the great sensation. Flatbush was gay
for the  hour <<about high noon|13>>, and pennanted motors thronged the
streets near the old  Dutch church where an awning stretched from door
to highway. No local event ever  surpassed the Suydam-Gerritsen
nuptials in tone and scale, and the party which  escorted bride and
groom to the Cunard Pier was, if not exactly the smartest, at  least a
solid page from the Social Register. At <<five o\'clock|6>> adieux were waved,
and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier, slowly turned
its nose  seaward, discarded its tug, and headed for the widening water
spaces that led to  old world wonders. By night the outer harbour was
cleared, and late passengers  watched the stars twinkling above an
unpolluted ocean.',

            "That same June evening, without having heard a word from the sea,
Malone was  desperately busy among the alleys of Red Hook. A sudden
stir seemed to permeate  the place, and as if apprised by 'grapevine
telegraph' of something singular,  the denizens clustered expectantly
around the dance-hall church and the houses  in Parker Place. Three
children had just disappeared\x{2014}blue-eyed Norwegians from  the streets
toward Gowanus\x{2014}and there were rumours of a mob forming among the
sturdy Vikings of that section. Malone had for weeks been urging his
colleagues  to attempt a general cleanup; and at last, moved by
conditions more obvious to  their common sense than the conjectures of
a Dublin dreamer, they had agreed  upon a final stroke. The unrest and
menace of this evening had been the deciding  factor, and <<just about
midnight|13>> a raiding party recruited from three stations  descended upon
Parker Place and its environs. Doors were battered in, stragglers
arrested, and candlelighted rooms forced to disgorge unbelievable
throngs of  mixed foreigners in figured robes, mitres, and other
inexplicable devices. Much  was lost in the melee, for objects were
thrown hastily down unexpected shafts,  and betraying odours deadened
by the sudden kindling of pungent incense. But  spattered blood was
everywhere, and Malone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier  or altar
from which the smoke was still rising.",
