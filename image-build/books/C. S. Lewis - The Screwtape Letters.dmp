            "Remember, he is not, like you, a pure spirit. Never having been a human (Oh that abominable advantage of the Enemy's!) you don't realise how enslaved they are to the pressure of the ordinary. I once had a patient, a sound atheist, who used to read in the British Museum. One day, as he sat reading, I saw a train of thought in his mind beginning to go the wrong way. The Enemy, of course, was at his elbow in a moment. Before I knew where I was I saw my twenty years' work beginning to totter. If I had lost my head and begun to attempt a defence by argument I should have been undone. But I was not such a fool. I struck instantly at the part of the man which I had best under my control and suggested that it was just about time he had some lunch. The Enemy presumably made the counter-suggestion (you know how one can never quite overhear What He says to them?) that this was more important than lunch. At least I think that must have been His line for when I said \x{201c}Quite. In fact much too important to tackle it the end of a morning\x{201d}, the patient brightened up considerably; and by the time I had added \x{201c}Much better come back after lunch and go into it with a fresh mind\x{201d}, he was already half way to the door. Once he was in the street the battle was won. I showed him a newsboy shouting the <<midday|13>> paper, and a No. 73 bus going past, and before he reached the bottom of the steps I had got into him an unalterable conviction that, whatever odd ideas might come into a man's head when he was shut up alone with his books, a healthy dose of \x{201c}real life\x{201d} (by which he meant the bus and the newsboy) was enough to show him that all \x{201c}that sort of thing\x{201d} just couldn't be true. He knew he'd had a narrow escape and in later years was fond of talking about \x{201c}that inarticulate sense for actuality which is our ultimate safeguard against the aberrations of mere logic\x{201d}. He is now safe in Our Father's house.",

            "He's a hedonist at heart. All those fasts and <<vigils|13>> and stakes and crosses are only a fa\x{e7}ade. Or only like foam on the sea shore. Out at sea, out in His sea, there is pleasure, and more pleasure. He makes no secret of it; at His right hand are \x{201c}pleasures for evermore\x{201d}. Ugh! I don't think He has the least inkling of that high and austere mystery to which we rise in the Miserific Vision. He's vulgar, Wormwood. He has a bourgeois mind. He has filled His world full of pleasures. There are things for humans to do all day long without His minding in the least\x{2014}sleeping, washing, eating, drinking, making love, playing, praying, working, Everything has to be twisted before it's any use to us. We fight under cruel disadvantages. Nothing is naturally on our side. (Not that that excuses you. I'll settle with you presently. You have always hated me and been insolent when you dared.)",
