            'U Po Kyin, Sub-divisional Magistrate of Kyauktada, in Upper Burma, was sitting in his veranda.  It was only <<half past eight|10>>, but the month was April, and there was a closeness in the air, a threat of the long, stifling midday hours.  Occasional faint breaths of wind, seeming cool by contrast, stirred the newly drenched orchids that hung from the eaves.  Beyond the orchids one could see the dusty, curved trunk of a palm tree, and then the blazing ultramarine sky. Up in the zenith, so high that it dazzled one to look at them, a few vultures circled without the quiver of a wing.',

            'Flory yawned as he came out of the gate.  He had been half drunk the night before, and the glare made him feel liverish.  \'Bloody, bloody hole!\' he thought, looking down the hill.  And, no one except the dog being near, he began to sing aloud, \'Bloody, bloody, bloody, oh, how thou art bloody\' to the tune of \'Holy, holy, holy, oh how Thou art holy \' as he walked down the hot red road, swishing at the dried-up grasses with his stick.  It was <<nearly nine o\'clock|6>> and the sun was fiercer every minute.  The heat throbbed down on one\'s head with a steady, rhythmic thumping, like blows from an enormous bolster.  Flory stopped at the Club gate, wondering whether to go in or to go farther down the road and see Dr Veraswami.  Then he remembered that it was \'English mail day\' and the newspapers would have arrived.  He went in, past the big tennis screen, which was overgrown by a creeper with starlike mauve flowers.',

His forehead was sweating. He was sulky, but not in a rage any longer.  At all times he was spiteful and perverse, but his violent fits of rage were soon over, and were never apologized for.  Quarrels were a regular part of the routine of Club life.  Mr Lackersteen was feeling better and was studying the illustrations in La Vie Parisienne.  It was <<after nine|9:0>> now, and the room, scented with the acrid smoke of Westfield\'s cheroot, was stifling hot.  Everyone\'s shirt stuck to his back with the first sweat of the day.

All European food in Burma is more or less disgusting--the bread is spongy stuff leavened with palm-toddy and tasting like a penny bun gone wrong, the butter comes out of a tin, and so does the milk, unless it is the grey watery catlap of the dudh-wallah.  As Ko S\'la left the room there was a scraping of sandals outside, and a Burmese girl\'s high-pitched voice said, \'Is my master awake?\'',

One dog had taken a dislike to Flory\'s house, and had settled down to bay at it systematically.  Sitting on its bottom fifty yards from the gate, it let out sharp, angry yelps, one to half a minute, as regularly as a clock.  It would keep this up for two or three hours, until the cocks began crowing.',

It smelt of chintz and dying flowers.  Mrs Lackersteen was upstairs, sleeping.  Outside, the servants lay silent in their quarters, their heads tethered to their wooden pillows by the death-like sleep of <<midday|13>>.  Mr Lackersteen, in his small wooden office down the road, was probably sleeping too.

White egrets stood poised, motionless, like herons, and piles of drying chilis gleamed crimson in the sun.  Sometimes a white pagoda rose from the plain like the breast of a supine giantess.  The early tropic night settled down, and the train jolted on, slowly, stopping at little stations where barbaric yells sounded from the darkness.  Half-naked men with their long hair knotted behind their heads moved to and fro in torchlight, hideous as demons in Elizabeth\'s eyes.  The train plunged into forest, and unseen branches brushed against the windows.  It was <<about nine o\'clock|6>> when they reached Kyauktada, where Elizabeth\'s uncle and aunt were waiting with Mr Macgregor\'s car, and with some servants carrying torches.  Her aunt came forward and took Elizabeth\'s shoulders in her delicate, saurian hands.',

The Prome anecdote, and many another, found a new home.  Any newcomer to Kyauktada was apt to come in for rather a large share of Mr Macgregor\'s conversation, for the others looked on him as an unparalleled bore, and it was a tradition at the Club to interrupt his stories.  But Elizabeth was by nature a good listener.  Mr Macgregor thought he had seldom met so intelligent a girl.',

Of course, it was not a question of any overt act of disloyalty--that was quite irrelevant.  The point was, was the doctor the KIND of man who would hold seditious opinions?  In India you are not judged for what you do, but for what you ARE.  The merest breath of suspicion against his loyalty can ruin an Oriental official.  Mr Macgregor had too just a nature to condemn even an Oriental out of hand.  He had puzzled as late as <<midnight|13>> over a whole pile of confidential papers, including the five anonymous letters he had received, besides two others that had been forwarded to him by Westfield, pinned together with a cactus thorn.',
