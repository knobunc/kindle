            'When I first met Mr Leakey I never guessed he was a magician. I met him like this. I was going across the Haymarket <<about five o\'clock|6>> one afternoon. When I got to the refuge by a lamp-post in the middle I stopped, but a little man had crossed so far with me went on. Then he saw a bus going down the hill and jumped back, which is always a silly thing to do. He jumped right in front of a car, and if I hadn\'t grabbed his overcoat collar and pulled him back on to the refuge, I think the car would have knocked him down. For it was wet weather, and the road was very greasy, so it only skidded when the driver put the brakes on.',

We\'ll go by carpet. You\'ll want a parachute in case you fall off on the way, and amulets to protect you against jinns and Rakshasas, and pyrethrum oil to keep off mosquitoes. Also some cool clothes. You won\'t need a sun helmet, it\'s <<three o\'clock in the afternoon|6>> there, but it will be fairly warm after London.\'',

            'There was a great bustle in the house when we got back there <<about eleven o\'clock|6>>. All sorts of magic things were happening. Cupboard doors were opening, and clothes, amulets, magic wands, books of spells, and what not, were jumping out and packing themselves into a hamper. When the hamper was full it shut itself, and a snake came out of another basket and wriggled its head underneath.',

We came down for a minute over the Amazon River, which was nearly as broad as the English Channel and yet flowing quite quickly, carrying down huge trees. After some more mountains we came to the sea again at <<about half-past three|10>> by my watch.',

On the stairs I met a rather badly dressed boy, and we went in together, for this time the door was there all right. Mr Leakey received us; he was dressed like a real magician, in a huge conical hat covered with runes and pentacles, and a long flowing robe. He introduced me to the boy, and told me he was called Mr John Robinson. I liked that. I think it is very rude to introduce a boy as Johnnie Robinson, or Master Robinson. If boys behave sensibly I think you ought to be just as polite to them as if they were grown-up.',

A few rusty nails and tin cans came rushing towards it, and so did the rats, but more slowly. They were full of iron filings, and the magnet just pulled them. Soon the hole round the magnet was full of rats, and they switched the current on to the next magnet. Then they turned on the third magnet, and so on. Of course only the rats that were above ground were pulled into the holes by the magnets. But they turned them on again and again, and as more and more came out of their holes they were caught too.',
