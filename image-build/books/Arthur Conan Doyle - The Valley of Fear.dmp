That was the breathless burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house, followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at the scene of the crime <<a little after twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>>, after taking prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was afoot.",
