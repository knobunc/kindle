He led us along Pavement, through Parliament Street, through Davygate, our boots clinking on the cobbles. It was cold, and the streets were mainly empty, except for the buried noise coming from pubs along the way. I could feel the Police Gazette in my coat pocket, burning away there, as it seemed to me.

            "I looked at the signs again: \x{2018}T\x{e9}l\x{e9}phone\x{2019}. I could not telephone. I was not up to it; did not know how. I looked again at the clock: <<12.27|9p>>. There were some electrical trains in the bays; but smoke floated over from somewhere beyond. I saw the ticket windows. Would they accept English money? <<12.28|9p>>. I could not see the money-changing place. I dashed to the ticket window \x{2013} Billets Internationaux \x{2013} and slammed down one of the tenners. \x{2018}London,\x{2019} I gasped out, \x{2018}boat train, second-class\x{2019}, and then I added for good measure, \x{2018}deck\x{2019}, which I\x{2019}d heard Sampson say at Charing Cross. The man was writing out the ticket before I\x{2019}d finished. But this writing out took an age. I looked at the clock. Dead on half past.",

            'The train waited, and when half an hour had passed I began to think of Sampson beating me to Thorpe-on-Ouse, leave alone Mike. After three quarters of an hour I began pacing the carriage. I could not sleep, think, stop thinking. Presently, a whistle came from the engine, and the train began to roll forwards, and it continued making twenty miles an hour at the most until a great railway works came in sight, with ranks of half-made engines illuminated by little fires burning about the place. This seemed to give heart to our train, for it at last picked up speed for the run to a spot called Rouen, which was sunk into a stonewalled cutting between two long tunnels. The train stopped here to change engines, and I could see nothing of Rouen but a clock: <<quarter to four in the morning|10>>. The deadest time of all. Within forty-five minutes, Sampson would be able to begin his journey to England if he was so minded.',

Every mile, the swooping telegraph wires told me of the course I ought to have taken. At <<3.30|9e>>, I glimpsed a finger post by the line reading \x{2018}York\x{2019}, and just then the first spatterings of rain fell against the window glass, as if the very word had brought it on.",
