Worse than that, it will backfire. My guess is that the very least that will happen is for Mars to withdraw even from its present loose association with the Empire. Much more likely there will be reprisals and human beings will be killed\x{2014}maybe every human on Mars. Then the extremists in the Humanity Party would have their way and Mars would be brought into the Empire by force\x{2014}but only after every Martian was dead.
