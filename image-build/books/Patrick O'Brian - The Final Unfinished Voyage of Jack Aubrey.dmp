            "* MS I, 1Stephen Maturin squared up to his writing-desk once more: he had been called away to attend to one of the ship\x{2019}s boys who in the lightness of his heart had contrived to stun himself in the foretop by taking the maul from its place, tossing it to a considerable height and so misjudging the revolutions as it fell that the massive head struck him down, speechless and unnaturally pale. Stephen dressed the wound, such as it was (more bruise than blood and no bone broken) and said to his loblolly-boy, \x{2018}Tell Dr Jacob, when he comes back, that this boy is to have no grog for the next three days, and tomorrow he may keep his hammock.\x{2019} Dr Jacob, the surgeon\x{2019}s mate, was away visiting friends aboard the frigate\x{2019}s tender, the rapid and windwardly Chesapeake schooner Ringle, and Stephen glanced in her direction, fine on the starboard bow, before going down from the brilliance of <<noon|13>> to the comparatively sombre cabin that he shared with Captain Aubrey.",
