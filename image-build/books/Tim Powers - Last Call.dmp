            'The game went well for Crane. The extra dozen decks of cards encouraged players to call for a new deck after a loss, a good start toward getting some superstition back into the game, and the sandwiches, when he brought them out at <<midnight|13>>, were a good enough diversion to produce a couple of instances of positively idiotic play. And there were a couple of doctors at the table, and doctors always had a lot of money and played loose, staying in with just about every hand; and nobody was completely sober, and Scott was apparently the only one who had any concerns about money, and by the time the game broke up at <<two in the morning|9a>> he had won more than two thousand dollars. That was two payments on the mortgage right there, and he could certainly find another game somewhere within the next couple of days.',

It had stayed pointed that way while Trumbill drove across the <<midnight|13>> desert on the straight dark line that was <<1-15|5a:1>> to Baker, and then down to Barstow into, eventually, the maze of Orange County.
