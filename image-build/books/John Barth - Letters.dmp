Its hero would live the first half of his life in the first three dozen years of the republic (say, 1776-1812) and the second half in its \x{201c}last\x{201d} (say, 1940\x{2014}1976), with a 128-year nap between, during which\x{2014}unlike Rip Winkle\x{2019}s case\x{2014}the country ages but the sleeper doesn\x{2019}t.

Ambrose, very big on solstices and equinoxes, chose Thursday, 20 March, to \x{201c}make his play.\x{201d} Your letters had arrived, declining the degree and suggesting we give it to Ambrose himself, an unthinkable idea. I\x{2019}d called a meeting of the nominating committee for <<2:30|2>> to decide our next move, and invited Ambrose to stop by my office earlier on and discuss ways of forestalling Harry Carter\x{2019}s inevitable renomination of A. B. Cook. To my surprise he proposed, straight upon entering, that we copulate at once atop the conference table, and took my arm to usher me there. I bade him be serious; he expressed his ardent wish that I bend over my desk and be mounted a tergo. I promptly so bent, but only to ring for Shirley Stickles, certain he\x{2019}d not risk public exposure. As I asked her to come in, however, he called my bluff by hitching up my skirt and down my panty hose (horrid term!). I bade Shirley wait a moment; turned to him furious; found his trouser fly already open, penis out and standing, face all smiles. At the same time, Shirley announced into my ear that President Schott was on the line and must speak to me at once; even as she so declared, that unctuous baritone broke in to say he\x{2019}d heard of your declining and wished, without of course in any way intervening in the committee\x{2019}s deliberations, to read me then and there A. B. Cook\x{2019}s newly published ode, in the Tidewater Times-Democrat, comparing Vice-President Spiro Agnew to St Patrick and the liberal news media to serpents. He began to read.

Here in my room, <<around ten in the evening|9h>> of that day, I finished drafting my memoir about not committing suicide aboard Capt. James Adams\x{2019}s showboat in 1937\x{2014}a story I\x{2019}d been writing since the previous March as one facet of my old Inquiry\x{2014}and prepared to resume the inquiry itself, together with the even older Letter to My Father of which it is a part. But to reward myself for completing the showboat narrative, I strolled down to the New Year\x{2019}s Eve party in progress at the Cambridge Yacht Club. The Macks were settled in Baltimore at this time; I never saw or heard from them. But I was delighted to find Jeannine there with her (first) husband, Barry Singer, and I spent some time chatting with them. The marriage had caused a tiny stir in the old Guilford/Ruxton society in which the Macks moved, where anti-Semitism perhaps enjoys a prolonged half-life even today. But Singer was the son of Judge Joseph Singer of the Maryland Appellate bench, who had ruled with the majority in Harrison Mack\x{2019}s favor in our great estate battle of 1938; Singer was moreover a proper Princetonian, and if his part-ownership of a chain of small-town movie houses was regarded by some as \x{201c}Jewish,\x{201d} they were pleased enough to meet at his parties the film and stage people among his friends.

The force Amherst dispatcht against Niagara included, along with British regulars & colonial militiamen, some 1,900 of these Iroquois, among whom Andrew Cooke III moved easily under the nom de guerre of John Butler: it was the largest such force ever assembled on the side of the British. Their plan was not to take the fort by storm, but to besiege it, cut off the reinforcement of its garrison, and so force its surrender. The French relief force, sent up promptly from the Ohio Valley & Detroit to lift the siege, consisted of 1,600 Indians\x{2014}Hurons, Mingoes, Shawnees\x{2014}and 600 French: amongst the latter was Andr\x{e9}e, in the r\x{f4}le of a half-breed habitant camp-follower.",

He would set the chisel for Karl or Grandfather to hold, and swing the mallet himself; he would hold the chisel and try to tell others how to strike. In 1920, he and Andrea married: there were eight in the house until <<1927|9c:0>>, when Peter was born and Konrad and Rosa moved next door to make room for the new grandchild. He experimented with ingenious jigs, positioning devices, chisel-headed hammers of his own devising. He bound his almost useless right arm to force himself into independence; he even tried to employ his foot as an extra hand. All in vain: it wants two strong arms like Peter\x{2019}s to shape the rock, and a knowing eye, and a temper of mind\x{2014}well, different from Ambrose\x{2019}s, who was born the year this folly made room for a larger.",

Like Dante Alighieri and many another at this famous juncture, he found himself at spiritual, philosophical, even psychological sixes and sevens. He misdoubted the validity of his career thus far: He had been active in the m\x{e9}nages of Madame de Sta\x{eb}l and Joel Barlow during the French Revolution and the Directorate; coming to America <<after 1800|18:1>>, he had involved himself with Aaron Burr\x{2019}s conspiracy and Tecumseh\x{2019}s Indian alliance, more out of antipathy for what he took to be his father\x{2019}s causes than out of real enmity toward the U.S. or sympathy for the Indians. At the time of these letters, about to become a father himself, Andrew Cook IV profoundly questions both the authenticity of his own motives and his appraisal of his father\x{2019}s, whom circumstances have precluded his knowing at all closely. With the aid of his remarkable wife, he researches the history of the family and discovers a striking pattern of filial rebellion: since the convergence of the Cooke and Burlingame lines\x{2014}that is to say, since the child of Henry Burlingame III and Anna Cooke was named and raised as Andrew Cooke III after his father\x{2019}s disappearance (per the epilogue of our Sot-Weed Factor novel)\x{2014}every firstborn son in the line has defined himself against what he takes to have been his absent father\x{2019}s objectives, and in so doing has allied himself, knowingly or otherwise, with his grandfather, whose name he also shares! Thus Andrew Cook IV, in aiding Tecumseh against the U.S., reenacted Andrew Cooke III\x{2019}s association with Pontiac in the French and Indian War, thinking to spite his father Henry Burlingame IV as Andrew III had thought to spite his father, H.B. III, et cetera.",

            "By <<1812|9n:0>>, however, Andrew is in the quandary aforementioned. Indeed, without giving over his admiration for his grandfather, he now believes himself to have been as mistaken about his father as he thinks his father to have been about his father! I leave it to his eloquent \x{201c}prenatal\x{201d} letters to set forth fully his historical investigations and psychological circumstances. He concludes with the resolve to devote the second half of his life to undoing his \x{201c}wrongheaded\x{201d} accomplishments in the first\x{2014}presumably by endeavoring to prevent the very war he has been promoting, or (as he believes it too late now to forestall the declaration of which today is the anniversary) by doing what he can to prevent a decisive victory for either the British or the Americans, in the hope that a stalemate will check their territorial expansion on the North American continent and permit the establishment of an Indian Free State. His career thus bids to be in effect self-canceling, by his own acknowledgment, as the careers of his successive Ancestors may be presumed to have been reciprocally canceling. It is his pious hope, in the fourth and final letter, that this program of self-refutation, together with the pattern he has exposed in the family history, will enable his unborn child\x{2014}i.e., Henry or Henrietta Cook Burlingame V\x{2014}to proceed undistracted by the spurious rebelliousness that has so dissipated the family\x{2019}s energies: that he or she may break the pattern and not defeat, but best, their father, by achieving the goals he can now hope only to take a few positive steps toward.",

The demolition party goes to Greenleaf Point, the confluence of the Potomac\x{2019}s east and west branches; they decide to drown the 150 powder barrels in a well shaft there, not realizing that the water is low; they dump the barrels in; someone adds a cigar, or a torch (it cannot be Andrew; he is back at the post office, writing this letter). The explosion is seismic: the whole city trembles, blocks of buildings are unroofed, windows shatter everywhere; the concussion sickens everyone for half a mile around. Greenleaf Point itself virtually disappears, the demolition squad with it; no one even knows how many men die\x{2014}one dozen, three. Debris lands on the post office, a mile away. And as the mangled casualties are collected, nature follows with another blow: no mere terrific thundersquall, but a bona fide tornado, a <<2 P.M.|5>> twister that unroofs the post office after all, sends letters flying, blows men out of the saddle and cannon off their carriages, picks up trees and throws them, tears the masts out of ships\x{2014}all this with an astonishing deluge of rain, lightning bolts, and thunderclaps that make the Battle of Bladensburg a Guy Fawkes Day picnic.

            "Can you see, Muse, through the rain of that sodden Tuesday, the letters going back and forth between Brooke and Cochrane, army and navy? Cochrane has written Ross on the Monday afternoon that, as best he can see from the river, the flank of Sam Smith\x{2019}s earthworks may be turned without a frontal assault. His letter comes back that evening unopened, together with the news of Ross\x{2019}s death. Unperturbed, perhaps relieved, Cochrane orders the body preserved in a cask of Jamaican rum and dashes off encouragement to Colonel Brooke: Prevost says burn, burn; I will take Fort McHenry (the harbor, alas, is blocked with scuttled privateers); you take the city. On Tuesday morning his bomb and rocket ships open fire, out of range of the guns of the fort. Three hours later he is already wavering; another letter goes down the river and up the North Point Road, this one to Brooke via Admiral Cockburn: It appears we cannot help you; the city is too far away, the fort too strong; consider reconsidering whether Brooke should attack at all. But he sustains the one-way bombardment into the afternoon, and the garrison at McHenry must take their punishment without reply. Even Cochrane cannot see the one bombshell out of hundreds and hundreds that lands directly on the powder magazine, goes through its roof with fuse still sputtering and, like the one bullet that felled General Ross, might have rewrit this chapter of history had not a nimble nameless fellow leaped to douse it. Cochrane moves his ships in closer; the Americans at last and jubilantly return the barrage; he moves back out of range. Nothing is working. Here\x{2019}s a letter from Brooke, fifteen hours late: he will be in Baltimore by <<noon|13>>! But it\x{2019}s <<past three|9f>>, and there\x{2019}s no sign of action at the earthworks. Cochrane can\x{2019}t see what you can, Muse: that Brooke has got his letter, explored the enemy\x{2019}s flanks and found them defended, and agreed with Cockburn that a night attack is the best strategy. As Cochrane reads this letter, Brooke is writing him another: the army and marines will attack at <<2:00 A.M.|2a>>; will the navy please stage a diversion on the farther side of Fort McHenry, as if moving up to threaten Baltimore from the west?",

It is Tuesday evening, rain coming down hard now. Cockburn scoffs at this letter\x{2014}Washington all over again!\x{2014}and urges Brooke to ignore it: Attack, attack. Brooke\x{2019}s junior officers are of the same mind; retreats do not earn promotions. But command is heavy: if the army takes the city but the navy cannot take the fort to load prizes, there will be nothing but an expensive bonfire to show for possibly very high losses.

There is a bad moment towards late afternoon, just after the one heavy exchange of fire from the fort, when they lose sight of it, the big 30-by-42-foot Stars and Stripes, in the smoke and rain, and wonder whether after all the fort has died. But John Skinner recollects that there is a second flag there, a smaller \x{201c}storm flag\x{201d} for squally weather; he optimistically proposes that the renewed silence means only that the bomb ships have retired back out of range, and that Major Armistead may be using the lull to hoist a banner more appropriate to the wretched weather.

What with the firing ceased and the rain still falling, the night is dead black. There is no need even to make his case to Admiral Cochrane: their gig is taken at once for one of the little flotilla assembling about the Surprize under general command of Captain Napier, and the lieutenant stays mum, recognizing the opportunity. Twenty small boats with muffled oars and light artillery, about fifteen men to a vessel, they head out at <<midnight|13>> in a quiet file. Andrew\x{2019}s boat is ninth in line: a single tap on the lieutenant\x{2019}s shoulder (even whispered conversation is forbidden) is enough to turn them and the eleven boats behind them up the wrong river-branch almost at once, into the line of scuttled ships across the harbor mouth.
