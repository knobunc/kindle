The idea is that you have to be back when the clock on the ground says <<one|11>> hour has passed. Now you want it so that when you come back, your clock is as far ahead as possible. According to Einstein, if you go very high, your clock will go faster, because the higher something is in a gravitational field, the faster its clock goes.

            "How did the customer beat the abacus? The number was 1729.03. I happened to know that a cubic foot contains 1728 cubic inches, so the answer is a tiny bit more than 12. The excess, <<1.03|9p>>, is only one part in <<nearly 2000|18:0>>, and I had learned in calculus that for small fractions, the cube root\x{2019}s excess is one-third of the number\x{2019}s excess. So all I had to do is find the fraction 1/1728, and multiply by 4 (divide by 3 and multiply by 12). So I was able to pull out a whole lot of digits that way.",
