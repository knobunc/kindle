Nothing happened. \x{201c}Be careful you don\x{2019}t tilt it,\x{201d} Baxter said. Picnic hammered on the machine in certain carefully selected spots. Something clicked and two streams, one of carbonated water and one of Coke syrup, began to flow out. Just before they shut off, an empty cup dropped down and got covered on the outside with syrup. \x{201c}Oh god, you\x{2019}re cute,\x{201d} Picnic said. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s neurotic,\x{201d} Rizzo said. \x{201c}The heat has driven it crazy.\x{201d} They talked for a while, speculating and cursing the Cajuns and the army, smoking and drinking Cokes, till finally Levine stood up and put his hands in his pockets letting his gut bulge out. \x{201c}Well,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}I reckon I\x{2019}ll go pack.\x{201d}",

And the order says specialists, ace specialists. Unfortunately we don\x{2019}t have any. But you have to do, slobs like you are all we have.\x{201d} Pierce was ROTC, a graduate of MIT. He had just made first lieutenant and was trying hard not to feel his power. When he spoke it was with a precise, dry Beacon Hill accent. \x{201c}Lieutenant,\x{201d} Levine said, \x{201c}you were young once. I got this broad in N\x{2019}Orleans, she\x{2019}s waiting for me. Give youth its day. There\x{2019}s hundreds of specialists better than me.\x{201d} The lieutenant smiled grimly. There was an implicit and mutual recognition of worth between them whenever things like this cropped up. Outwardly neither had any use for the other; but each had the vague sense that they were more alike than either would care to admit, brothers, possibly, under the skin. When Pierce had first arrived at Roach and found out the story on Levine he had tried to talk to him. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re wasting yourself, Levine,\x{201d} he would say. \x{201c}Here you are, college graduate, highest IQ in the damn battalion, and what are you doing. Sitting here in the most wretched pesthole in the armed forces, on an ass that gets broader every month. Why don\x{2019}t you go for OCS? You could probably even get into the Point if you wanted. Why did you enlist in the army in the first place?\x{201d} And Levine would say with a hesitant grin that was neither auite apologetic nor auite scornful, \x{201c}Well I sort of figured I\x{2019}d like to stay an enlisted man and make a career out of it.\x{201d} At first the lieutenant would blow up whenever he said this, get incoherent. Later he would turn and walk away and finally he gave up altogether and gave up talking to Levine. Now he said, \x{201c}You\x{2019}re in the army, Levine. Leave isn\x{2019}t a right, it\x{2019}s a privilege.\x{201d} Levine stuck his hands in his back pockets. \x{201c}Ah,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Well, okay.\x{201d}",

The whole business had clearly been a foulup on the part of the Weather Bureau: Wednesday afternoon, when the inhabitants of the town had started to evacuate, the bureau had issued a statement that the hurricane would not arive till Thursday night. It urged them not to crowd the roads. There was plenty of time. Sometime between <<midnight|13>> and <<three|20a>> Thursday morning the hurricane hit, zeroed in on Creole. The National Guard was coming, the article continued, so were the Red Cross, the army and the navy. They were trying to get planes up from the air force base in Biloxi but flying conditions were very bad. One of the big oil companies was contributing a couple of tugboats to aid in rescue operations. Creole would probably be declared a disaster area. And so on. They had a few more beers and talked about the hurricane and everyone agreed that for the next few days they were probably going to be working their ass off, and this led to several statements, obscene and disaffected, about the nature of the U.S. Army. \x{201c}Re-up,\x{201d} Rizzo said, \x{201c}you still got time, you can still be eligible.

Outside a small wind had risen, which rattled the flaps of tar paper and blundered baffled and turbulent into and around the jutting corners and irregular angles of the shack. Somehow they started telling sea stories. Pig told about how he and a sonarman named Feeny had stolen a horse-drawn taxi in Barcelona. It turned out neither of them knew anything about horses and they wound up driving full tilt off the end of Fleet Landing, pursued by at least a platoon of Shore Patrolmen. While they were floundering around in the water it occurred to them that this would be a good time to swim out to the carrier Intrepid and stomp hell out of a few airedales. They would have made it had it not been for the Intrepid \x{2018}s motor launch, which caught up with them a few hundred yards out. Feeny managed to throw the coxswain and the bow hook over the side before some wise-assed ensign with a .45 stopped all the fun by shooting Feeny through the shoulder. Flange told about how one spring weekend back in college he and two comrades had swiped a female cadaver from the local morgue. They took it up to Flange\x{2019}s fraternity <<about three in the morning|9h>> and deposited it next to the president of the house, who was lying passed out on his bed. Next morning bright and early all the brothers able to ambulate marched en masse to the president\x{2019}s room and began banging on the door. \x{201c}Yes, just a minute,\x{201d} a voice groaned from inside, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll be right with.

About fifteen minutes later Vincent, ashen and trembling, opened up and they all trooped in noisily. They looked under the bed and moved the furniture around and opened the closet, but no corpse. Puzzled, they began pulling out dresser drawers, when suddenly there was a piercing scream from outside. They rushed to the window and looked down. A coed had fainted in the street. It turned out Vincent had knotted together his three best neckties and hung the body outside the window. Pig shook his head. \x{201c}Wait a minute,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I thought you were gonna tell a sea story.\x{201d} By this time they had killed the gallon.

It became clear almost immediately that he was not fond of Goodfellow. With him was a robust, myopic girl of eleven; the sister. Mildred was in Egypt, she soon informed Porpentine, to gather rock specimens, being daft for rocks in the same way Sir Alastair was for large and ancient pipe-organs. He had toured Germany the previous year, alienating the populations of various cathedral towns by recruiting small boys to toil away half-days at a clip keeping the bellows going: and then underpaying. Frightfully, added Victoria. There was, he continued, no decent pipe-organ anywhere on the African continent (which Porpentine could hardly doubt). Goodfellow mentioned an enthusiasm for the barrel-organ, and had Sir Alastair ever tried his hand at <<one|9c:1>>. The peer growled ominously. Out of the corner of his eye Porpentine saw Count Khevenh\x{fc}ller-Metsch come out of an adjoining room, steering the Russian Vice-Consul by the arm and talking wistfully; M. de Villiers punctuated the conversation with mirthful little barks. Aha, Porpentine thought. Mildred had produced from her reticule a large rock, which she now held up to Porpentine for inspection. She had found it out near the site of the ancient Pharos, it contained trilobite fossils. Porpentine could not respond; it was his old weakness.

            "But like a Yorkshire sunset, certain things could not be afforded. Porpentine had realized this as a fledgling. You do not feel pity for the men you have to kill or the people you have to hurt. You do not feel any more than a vague esprit de corps toward the agents you are working with. Above all, you do not fall in love. Not if you want to succeed in espionage. God knew what pre-adolescent agonies were responsible; but somehow Porpentine had remained true to that code. He had grown up possessing a sly mind and was too honest not to use it. He stole from street-hawkers, could stack a deck at fifteen, would run away whenever fighting was useless. So that at some point, prowling any mews or alley in midcentury London, the supreme Tightness of \x{201c}the game for its own sake\x{201d} must have occurred to him, and acted as an irresistible vector aimed <<toward 1900|18:0>>. Now he would say that any itinerary, with all its doublings-back, emergency stops, and hundred-kilometer feints remained transitory or accidental. Certainly it was convenient, necessary; but never gave an indication of the deeper truth that all of them operated in no conceivable Europe but rather in a zone forsaken by God, between the tropics of diplomacy, lines they were forbidden forever to cross. One had consequently to play that idealized colonial Englishman who, alone in the jungle, shaves every day, dresses for dinner every night, and is committed to St. George and no quarter as an article of love. Curious irony in that, of course. Porpentine grimaced to himself. Because both sides, his and Moldweorp\x{2019}s, had each in a different way done the unforgivable: had gone native. Somehow it had come about that one day neither man cared any longer which government he was working for. As if that prospect of a Final Clash were unable by men like them, through whatever frenzied twists and turns, to be evaded. Something had come to pass: who could guess what, or even when? In the Crimea, at Spicheren, at Khartum; it could make no difference. But so suddenly that there was a finite leap or omission in the maturing process\x{2014}one fell asleep exhausted among immediacies: F.O. dispatches, Parliamentary resolutions; and awakened to find a tall specter grinning and gibbering over the foot of the bed, know that he was there to stay\x{2014}hadn\x{2019}t they seen the apocalypse as an excuse for a glorious beano, a grand way to see the old century and their respective careers go out?",

Across the double line of tracks was a small park, green with palms and acacias. Porpentine kept to the shadow of the station-house. Soon the others arrived. He noticed the tiniest flicker of communication pass between Bongo-Shaftsbury and Lepsius. The morning express pulled in, amid sudden commotion on the platform. Porpentine turned to see Lepsius in pursuit of an Arab, who had apparently stolen his valise. Goodfellow had already gone into action. Sprinting across the platform, blond mane flapping wild, he cornered the Arab in a doorway, took back the valise and surrendered his quarry to a fat policeman in a pith helmet. Lepsius watched him snake-eyed and silent as he handed back the valise.",

            'That night Porpentine commissioned a cab and roved about the city until early morning. The coded instructions had told them nothing more than to bide time: Good-fellow was taking care of that, having escorted Victoria to an Italian summer-theater performance at the Ezbekiyeh Garden. In the course of the night Porpentine visited a girl who lived in the Quartier Rosetti and was the mistress of a junior clerk in the British Consulate; a jewel merchant in the Muski who had lent financial support to the Mahdists and did not wish now that the movement was crushed to have his sympathies known; a minor Esthetic who had fled England on a narcotics charge to the land of no extradition and who was a distant cousin of the valet to Mr. Raphael Borg, the British Consul; and a pimp named Varkumian who claimed to know every assassin in Cairo. From this fine crew Porpentine returned to his room at <<three in the morning|9a>>. But hesitated at the door, having heard movement behind it. Only one thing for it: at the end of the corridor was this window with a ledge outside. He grimaced. But then everyone knew that spies were continually crawling about window-ledges, high above the streets of exotic cities. Feeling an utter fool, Porpentine climbed out and got on the ledge. He looked down: there was a drop of about fifteen feet into some bushes. Yawning he made his way quickly but clumsily toward the corner of the building. The ledge became narrower at the corner. As he stood with each foot on a different side and the edge of the building bisecting him from eyebrows to abdomen he lost his balance and fell. On the way down it occurred to him to use an obscene word; he hit the shrubbery with a crash, rolled, and lay there tapping his fingers. After he had smoked half a cigarette he got to his feet and noticed a tree next his own window, easily climbable. He ascended puffing and cursing; crawled out on a limb, straddled it, and peered inside.',

Porpentine watched from a deserted room on the third floor of the Hotel Victoria. Lord Cromer was a perfect target but this vantage at least was unavailable to any hired assassin-in-opposition as long as Porpentine\x{2019}s friends kept on the alert. The archaeologist had taken Victoria and Mildred to tour the bazaars and the Tombs of the Khalifs. Goodfellow was sitting in a closed landau directly under the window. Unobtrusive (as Porpentine watched) he started off behind the carriage, keeping at a safe distance. Porpentine left the hotel, strolled up Sharia el-Maghrabi. At the next corner he noticed a church off to his right; heard loud organ music. On a sudden whim he entered the church. Sure enough, it was Sir Alastair, booming away. It took the unmusical Porpentine some five minutes to come aware of the devastation Sir Alastair was wreaking on the keys and pedals. Music laced the interior of the tiny, Gothic house with certain intricate veinings, weird petal-shapes. But it was violent and somehow Southern foliage. Head and fingers uncontrollable for a neglect of his daughter\x{2019}s or any purity, for the music\x{2019}s own shape, for Bach\x{2014}was it Bach?\x{2014}himself? Foreign and a touch shabby, uncomprehending, how could Porpentine say. But was yet unable to pull away until the music stopped abruptly, leaving the church\x{2019}s cavity to reverberate. Only then did he withdraw unseen out into the sun, adjusting his neck-cloth as if it were all the difference between wholeness and disintegration.",

Soon the Consul-General\x{2019}s party arrived and sat near them. Lepsius and Bongo-Shaftsbury drifted in from either side and stationed themselves in boxes; forming, with Lord Cromer as vertex, an angle of 120 degrees. \x{201c}Bother,\x{201d} said Goodfellow. \x{201c}We should have got some elevation.\x{201d} Four policemen came marching down the center aisle, glanced up at Bongo-Shaftsbury. He pointed to Porpentine. \x{201c}My Gawd,\x{201d} Goodfellow moaned. Porpentine closed his eyes. He\x{2019}d blown it, all right. This was what happened when one blundered right in. The policemen surrounded them, stood at attention. \x{201c}All right,\x{201d} Porpentine said. He and Goodfellow arose and were escorted out of the theater. \x{201c}We shall desire your passports,\x{201d} one of them said. Behind them on the breeze came the first sprightly chords of the opening scene. They marched down a narrow path, two police behind, two in front. Signals had, of course, been arranged years before. \x{201c}I shall want to see the British Consul,\x{201d} Porpentine said and spun, drawing an old single-shot pistol. Goodfellow had the other two covered. The policeman who had asked for their passports glowered. \x{201c}No one said they would be armed,\x{201d} another protested. Methodically, with four raps to the skull, the policemen were neutralized and rolled into the underbrush. \x{201c}A fool trick,\x{201d} Goodfellow muttered: \x{201c}we were lucky.\x{201d} Porpentine was already running back toward the theater. They took the stairs two at a time and searched for an empty box. \x{201c}Here,\x{201d} Goodfellow said. They edged into the box. It was almost directly across from Bongo-Shaftsbury\x{2019}s. That would put them next to Lepsius. \x{201c}Keep down,\x{201d} Porpentine said. They crouched, peering between small golden balusters. On stage Edmondo and the students chaffed the Romantic, horny Des Grieux. Bongo-Shaftsbury was checking the action of a small pistol. \x{201c}Stand by,\x{201d} Goodfellow whispered. The postilion horn of the diligence was heard. The coach came rattling and creaking into the inn courtyard. Bongo-Shaftsbury raised his pistol. Por-pentine said: \x{201c}Lepsius. Next door.\x{201d} Goodfellow withdrew. The diligence bounced to a halt. Porpentine centered his sights on Bongo-Shaftsbury, then let the muzzle drift down and to the right until it pointed at Lord Cromer. It occurred to him that he could end everything for himself right now, never have to worry about Europe again. He had a sick moment of uncertainty. Now how serious had anyone ever been? Was aping Bongo-Shaftsbury\x{2019}s tactics any less real than opposing them? Like a bloody grouse, Goodfellow had said. Manon was helped down from the coach. Des Grieux gaped, was transfixed, read his destiny on her eyes. Someone was standing behind Porpentine. He glanced back, quickly in that moment of hopeless love, and saw Moldweorp there looking decayed, incredibly old, face set in a hideous though compassionate smile. Panicking, Porpentine turned and fired blindly, perhaps at Bongo-Shaftsbury, perhaps at Lord Cromer. He could not see and would never be sure which one he had intended as target. Bongo-Shaftsbury shoved the pistol inside his coat and disappeared. A fight was on out in the corridor. Porpentine pushed the old man aside and ran out in time to see Lepsius tear away from Goodfellow and flee toward the stairs. \x{201c}Please, dear fellow,\x{201d} Moldweorp gasped. \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t go after them. You are outnumbered.\x{201d} Porpentine had reached the top step. \x{201c}Three to two,\x{201d} he muttered.",
