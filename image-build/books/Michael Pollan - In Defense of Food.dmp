            "All this is so well understood that when pollsters ask Americans if they eat together as a family most nights, they offer a resounding\x{2014}and resoundingly untrue\x{2014}reply in the affirmative. In fact, most American families today report eating dinner together <<three to four|10a:0>> nights a week, but even those meals bear only the faintest resemblance to the Norman Rockwell ideal. If you install video cameras in the kitchen and dining-room ceilings above typical American families, as marketers for the major food companies have done, you\x{2019}ll quickly discover that the reality of the family dinner has diverged substantially from our image of it. Mom might still cook something for herself and sit at the table for a while, but she\x{2019}ll be alone for much of that time. That\x{2019}s because dad and each of the kids are likely to prepare an entirely different entr\x{e9}e for themselves, \x{201c}preparing\x{201d} in this case being a synonym for microwaving a package. Each family member might then join mom at the table for as long as it takes to eat, but not necessarily all at the same time. Technically, this kind of feeding counts as a family dinner in the survey results, though it\x{2019}s hard to believe it performs all the customary functions of a shared meal. Kraft or General Mills, for instance, is now determining the portion sizes, not mom, and the social value of sharing food is lost. It looks a lot more like a restaurant meal, where everyone orders his or her own dish. (Though the service isn\x{2019}t quite as good, because the entr\x{e9}es don\x{2019}t arrive at the same time.) Of course, people tend to eat more when they can have exactly what they want\x{2014}which is precisely why the major food companies approve of this modernized family meal and have done everything in their considerable power to foster it. So they market different kinds of entr\x{e9}es to each member of the family (low carb for the dieting teenager, low cholesterol for dad, high fat for the eight-year-old, and so on), and engineer these \x{201c}home meal replacements,\x{201d} as they\x{2019}re known in the trade, so that even the eight-year-old can safely microwave them.",
