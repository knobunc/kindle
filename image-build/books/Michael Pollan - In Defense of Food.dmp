Other similar trials have found striking protective effects in more traditional, plant-based dietary patterns that no single nutrient can adequately explain. In the D.A.S.H. (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) study, a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in saturated fat reduced blood pressure even when salt intake and weight remained unchanged. (Lawrence J. Appel, et al., \x{201c}A Clinical Trial of the Effects of Dietary Patterns on Blood Pressure,\x{201d} New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 336, No. 16, April 17, 1997.) Neither of these studies relied on food-frequency questionnaires; rather, the researchers prepared the meals for the participants. The Lyon Diet Heart Study found that the Mediterranean diet, when compared to a Western diet, offered protection against a second heart attack during the four years patients were followed. (Michel de Lorgeril et al., \x{201c}Mediterranean Diet, Traditional Risk Factors, and the Rate of Cardiovascular Complications after Myocardial Infarction,\x{201d} Circulation, 1999:99; 779\x{2013}85.)",
