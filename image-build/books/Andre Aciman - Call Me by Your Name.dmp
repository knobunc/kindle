            "With the exception of my family, he was probably the only other Jew who had ever set foot in B. But unlike us he let you see it from the very start. We were not conspicuous Jews. We wore our Judaism as people do almost everywhere in the world: under the shirt, not hidden, but tucked away. \x{201c}Jews of discretion,\x{201d} to use my mother\x{2019}s words. To see someone proclaim his Judaism on his neck as Oliver did when he grabbed one of our bikes and headed into town with his shirt wide open shocked us as much as it taught us we could do the same and get away with it. I tried imitating him a few times. But I was too self-conscious, like someone trying to feel natural while walking about naked in a locker room only to end up aroused by his own nakedness. In town, I tried flaunting my Judaism with the silent bluster that comes less from arrogance than from repressed shame. Not him. It\x{2019}s not that he never thought about being Jewish or about the life of Jews in a Catholic country. Sometimes we spoke about just this topic during those long afternoons when both of us would put aside work and enjoy chatting while the entire household and guests had all drifted into every available bedroom to rest for a few hours. He had lived long enough in small towns in New England to know what it felt like to be the odd Jew out. But Judaism never troubled him the way it troubled me, nor was it the subject of an abiding, metaphysical discomfort with himself and the world. It did not even harbor the mystical, unspoken promise of redemptive brotherhood. And perhaps this was why he wasn\x{2019}t ill at ease with being Jewish and didn\x{2019}t constantly have to pick at it, the way children pick at scabs they wish would go away. He was okay with being Jewish. He was okay with himself, the way he was okay with his body, with his looks, with his antic backhand, with his choice of books, music, films, friends. He was okay with losing his prized Mont Blanc pen. \x{201c}I can buy another one just like it.\x{201d} He was okay with criticism too. He showed my father a few pages he was proud of having written. My father told him his insights into Heraclitus were brilliant but needed firming up, that he needed to accept the paradoxical nature of the philosopher\x{2019}s thinking, not simply explain it away. He was okay with firming things up, he was okay with paradox. Back to the drawing board\x{2014}he was okay with the drawing board as well. He invited my young aunt for a t\x{ea}te-\x{e0}-t\x{ea}te <<midnight|13>> gita\x{2014}spin\x{2014}in our motorboat. She declined. That was okay. He tried again a few days later, was turned down again, and again made light of it. She too was okay with it, and, had she spent another week with us, would probably have been okay with going out to sea for a <<midnight|13>> gita that could easily have lasted till sunrise.",

He could have passed for my age. As promised, that night we all sat down\x{2014}there were no guests\x{2014}and watched television romances. The best part was how everyone, including Vimini, who wandered in, and Mafalda, who had her \x{201c}seat\x{201d} near the door of the living room, talked back to every scene, predicted its end, by turns outraged by and derisive of the stupidity of the story, the actors, the characters. Why, what would you have done in her place? I would have left him, that\x{2019}s what. And you, Mafalda?

With dusk scarcely an hour away, the street-lights glistened through dense halos, while the lighted storefronts seemed doused in gleaming colors of their own invention. Dampness clung to every forehead and every face. I wanted to caress his face. I couldn\x{2019}t wait to get to our hotel and shower and throw myself on the bed, knowing all the while that, unless we had good air-conditioning, I\x{2019}d be no better off after the shower. But I also loved the languor that sat upon the city, like a lover\x{2019}s tired, unsteady arm resting on your shoulders.",

Someone had sent us a bunch of flowers and a bowl filled with fruit. The note came from Oliver\x{2019}s Italian publisher: \x{201c}Come to the bookstore <<around eight-thirty|5k:0>>. Bring your manuscript. There\x{2019}s a party for one of our authors. Ti aspettiamo, we\x{2019}re awaiting you.\x{201d}",

By now it must have been <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>>. The air was still very damp. You could see it on our faces, and on our clothes, we looked limp and soggy. Even the tablecloths felt limp and soggy. But the restaurant was on a hill and occasionally a breathless draft would sough through the trees, signifying that tomorrow it would rain again but that the mugginess would remain unchanged.",

            "It was well <<past one in the morning|9h>> when the party arrived at Caff\x{e8} Sant\x{2019}Eustachio. We ordered coffees for everyone. I thought I understood why everyone swears by Sant\x{2019}Eustachio\x{2019}s coffee; or perhaps I wanted to think I understood, but I wasn\x{2019}t sure. I wasn\x{2019}t even sure I liked it. Perhaps no one else did but felt obliged to fall in with the general opinion and claimed that they too couldn\x{2019}t live without it. There was a large crowd of coffee drinkers standing and sitting around the famed Roman coffeehouse. I loved watching all these lightly dressed people standing so close to me, all of them sharing the same basic thing: love for the night, love for the city, love for its people, and an ardent desire to couple\x{2014}with anyone. Love for anything that would prevent the tiny groups of people who had come together here from disbanding. After coffee, when the group considered separating, someone said, \x{201c}No, we can\x{2019}t say goodbye yet.\x{201d} Someone suggested a pub nearby. Best beer in Rome. Why not? So we headed down a long and narrow side alley leading in the direction of Campo de\x{2019} Fiori. Lucia walked between me and the poet. Oliver, talking with two of the sisters, was behind us. The old man had made friends with Straordinario-fantastico and they were both confabulating about San Clemente. \x{201c}What a metaphor for life!\x{201d} said Straordinario-fantastico. \x{201c}Please! No need to overdo things either with clementification this and clementization that. It was just a figure of speech, you know,\x{201d} said Falstaff, who probably had had his fill of his godson\x{2019}s glory for the night. Noticing that Ada was walking by herself, I walked back and held her by the hand. She was dressed in white and her tanned skin had a sheen that made me want to touch every pore in her body. We did not speak. I could hear her high heels tapping the slate pavement. In the dark she seemed an apparition.",

            "The bar was closing when we arrived. \x{201c}We close at <<two|9c:1>>.\x{201d} \x{201c}Well, we still have time for drinks.\x{201d} Oliver wanted a martini, an American martini. What a beautiful idea, said the poet. \x{201c}Me too,\x{201d} chimed in someone else. On the large jukebox you could hear the same summer hit we\x{2019}d heard during the entire month of July. On hearing the word \x{201c}martini,\x{201d} the old man and the publisher also dittoed the order. \x{201c}Ehi! Taverniere!\x{201d} shouted Falstaff. The waiter told us that we could either have wine or beer; the bartender had left earlier that evening, on account of because his mother was taken gravely ill to the hospital where she had to be taken. Everyone smothered a laugh at the waiter\x{2019}s garbled speech. Oliver asked what they charged for martinis. The waiter yelled the question to the girl at the cash register. She told him how much. \x{201c}Well, what if I make the drinks and you charge us your price on account of because we can mix the drinks we are mixing?\x{201d}",

            "We returned to the bar to find everyone had already left. By then it must have been <<three in the morning|5>>, or even later. Except for a few cars, the city was dead quiet. When, by mistake, we reached the normally crowded Piazza Rotonda around the Pantheon, it too was unusually empty. There were a few tourists lugging huge knapsacks, a few drunks, and the usual drug dealers. Oliver stopped a street vendor and bought me a Lemonsoda. The taste of bitter lemons was refreshing and made me feel better. Oliver bought a bitter orange drink and a slice of watermelon. He offered me a bite, but I said no. How wonderful, to walk half drunk with a Lemonsoda on a muggy night like this around the gleaming slate cobblestones of Rome with someone\x{2019}s arm around me. We turned left and, heading toward Piazza Febo, suddenly, from nowhere, made out someone strumming a guitar, singing not a rock song, but as we got closer, an old, old Neapolitan tune. \x{201c}Fenesta ca lucive.\x{201d} It took me a moment to recognize it. Then I remembered.",

I could have fallen asleep right then and there, forgetting all about Billowy and the smell, and about Oliver himself.
