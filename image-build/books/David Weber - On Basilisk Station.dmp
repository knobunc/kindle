They can stand the loss of a couple of battle squadrons as the opening round in a war, especially if they can inflict a favorable rate of exchange in return. And it's going to be a horse race to get anything here from Manticore in time to stop them, even with our Code Zulu.

It showed a birds-eye view of the valley, relayed from one of the two pinnaces invisible on station high above him, and his skin crawled as the ground itself seemed to flow towards his positions. The Stilties were coming at him in a mob more than two kilometers wide and three deep, flowing through the moss like a vast, ragged tide. There must be at least ten thousand of them out there, and that was far more than he\'d allowed even his worst-case estimates to assume.

"<<Approximately one-eight|9:0>>-nine seconds, Sir."
Coglin nodded and rubbed his lower lip. His missiles would still burn out nine seconds before they reached Fearless, and part of him wanted to wait. To conceal the fact that Sirius was armed until Fearless was close enough that his birds\' drives would last all the way to their target. The chance of a hit would be marginally greater if they retained their power to maneuver and follow Fearless\'s evasion, but only marginally at such a range. And, truth to tell, it probably wouldn\'t really make a good goddamn\'s difference. Under power or ballistic, the flight time would be long enough to give the cruiser\'s point defense plenty of time to engage them.',
