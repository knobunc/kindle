            "This new version he began to write in earnest in October of 1932, during a visit to Leningrad with Elena Sergeevna, whom he had just married. (The \x{201c}model\x{201d} for Margarita, who had now entered the composition, she was previously married to a high-ranking military official, who for some time opposed her wish to leave him for the writer, leading Bulgakov to think he would never see her again.) His wife was surprised that he could set to work without having any notes or earlier drafts with him, but Bulgakov explained, \x{201c}I know it by heart.\x{201d} He continued working, not without long interruptions, until <<1936|9n:0>>. Various new tides occurred to him, all still referring to Satan as the central figure \x{2014} The Great Chancellor, Satan, Here I Am, The Black Theologian, He Has Come, The Hoofed Consultant. As in the earliest version, the time of the action is 24\x{2014} 5 June, the feast of St John, traditionally a time of magic enchantments (later it was moved to the time of the spring full moon). The nameless friend of Margarita is called \x{201c}Faust\x{201d} in some notes, though not in the text itself. He is also called \x{201c}the poet\x{201d}, and is made the author of a novel which corresponds to the \x{201c}Gospel of Woland\x{201d} from the first drafts. This historical section is now broken up and moved to a later place in the novel, coming closer to what would be the arrangement in the final version.",

This was to be the definitive resolution. Clearly, the master is not to be seen as a heroic martyr for art or a \x{201c}Christ-figure\x{201d}. Bulgakov\x{2019}s gentle irony is a warning against the mistake, more common in our time than we might think, of equating artistic mastery with a sort of saintliness, or, in Kierkegaard\x{2019}s terms, of confusing the aesthetic with the ethical.",

Along with the watery spray and hail, broken-off roses, magnolia leaves, small twigs and sand were swept on to the balcony under the columns. The hurricane racked the garden.',
