incline to a clearing. Here, among ferns, nettles and wild flowers, eight hives
had been arranged in a circle. To each of these Anselm had given the name of a

between Th\x{e9}r\x{e8}se de Lisieux and Augustine of Hippo. Memorising who was where
among the rest had not been an easy task. Anselm only succeeded after
Sylvester, the Gatekeeper, gave him a Christmas present <<after midnight|13>> mass:

watchman had inscribed a name in glorious copperplate. Within the hour they\x{2019}d

the powers-that-be at Larkwood didn\x{2019}t immediately share Anselm\x{2019}s enthusiasm.
The novice master suggested he dwell upon Isaiah, Chapter 11, verses <<one\x{2014}ten|5k:1>>, a
passage which Anselm later read with horror, because it laid out the wondrous
qualities of a good judge. The community was pushing him away, he thought, back
to the law, to the misery that would desiccate the marrow in his bones. Of
course it was wise counsel: they had to be sure; and he had to clearly
appreciate what he might leave behind. But Anselm refused to be discouraged.
For two years he knocked tenaciously upon a heavy door that only opened ever so
slowly, ever so cautiously He looked through the gap, seeing more and more; and
the community looked back like puzzled badgers in their set. In fairness, each
side blinked once or twice, wondering what they might be letting themselves in
for, but each eventually formed the sort of merciful judgement described by
Isaiah. Aged thirty\x{2014}four, jazz records in his bag, Anselm\x{2019}s feet finally
crunched upon the gravel of a lane marked \x{2018}Private\x{2019}. The door was already open

these last two encounters would have vexed him, but now they were utterly
inconsequential. Among old soldiers (said Martin, mingling anecdote with fact)
the Salient was called Immortal because of its strategic importance, and for
the vast numbers of dead it claimed. At this small spot the hopes of the
opposing sides had collided in increasingly desperate attempts to break the
deadlock, to make the static war a mobile conflict. No price had been deemed
too high. For whoever broke through could launch a sweeping movement inland to
win the war. But it never happened. By <<1917|9u>>, he said, there were bodies in the
Salient reflecting the age of the conflict. Anselm had grimaced \x{2014} not so much
at the idea, but because Martin had used an archaeologist\x{2019}s phrase to
illuminate the past. It was an unavoidable technique when all that remained of
the bloodshed was an archive. The very exercise, however, revealed the acute

Field General Court Martial had to comprise at least three officers unless the

fields of cabbage or hops draped on wooden scaffolds, he remembered that two

Field Punishment or Imprisonment. After a mile or so Herbert came upon the rows
