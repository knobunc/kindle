J. C. Rolfe, et seq.). And we learn from the same author that when he read to Augustus and his sister Octavia the second, fourth, and sixth books of the Aeneid, when he reached in the sixth book the lines about her son Marcellus, who had died young, she fainted, and it was difficult to revive her. We know too that Virgil and his father somehow escaped the fate of so many of the landowners in the area that Virgil refers to as Mantua\x{2014}\x{201c}but Mantua / Stands far too close for comfort to poor Cremona\x{201d} (Eclogues <<9.28|5a:0>>, trans.

He is called in the early lines of the poem (<<1.10|5a:0>>) \x{201c}a man outstanding in his piety,\x{201d} insignem pietate virum, and in 1.457 he introduces himself to his mother, Venus (whom he has not yet recognized), with the words \x{201c}I am pious Aeneas,\x{201d} sum pius Aeneas (trans.

But Juno is bitterly opposed to this vision of the future; she hated Troy while it stood, and all Trojans since with a vicious aversion, and she is determined that Aeneas will not reach Italy. This hatred of Trojans has many causes: the fact that their ancestor was Dardanus, the son of Zeus and Electra, daughter of Atlas\x{2014}\x{201c}the Trojan stock she loathed\x{201d} (<<1.35|5a:0>>); the fact that Ganymede, a beautiful boy whose father was Laomedon, a Trojan prince, had been carried up to Olympus by Zeus, who assumed the shape of an eagle, to be his cupbearer\x{2014}\x{201c}the honors showered on Ganymede\x{201d} (<<1.35|5a:0>>)\x{2014}and lastly the so-called Judgment of Paris, delivered while Troy still stood secure at peace behind its walls. Three goddesses, Juno, Athena, and Venus, disputed which was the most beautiful and finally decided on a beauty contest to be judged by Paris, a son of Priam, king of Troy. As he surveyed their charms, each one offered him a bribe to win his vote. The virgin goddess Athena offered him success in war, Juno success in every walk of life, but Venus offered the love and the hand of the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen, wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta in Greece. He judges Venus the most beautiful, goes to Sparta, runs off to Troy with Helen, and the ten-year war begins. Juno never forgot this insult; it is mentioned at the beginning of Virgil\x{2019}s poem, \x{201c}the judgment of Paris, the unjust slight to her beauty\x{201d} (<<1.34|5a:0>>).

            "There has been much discussion of the passage in Virgil. Aeneas and the Sibyl are not dreams to start with; and why must they go out of the land of the dead through the gate of false dreams? The obvious answer is that since the other party, the shades of noble Romans to come, must go through the Gate of Horn, which \x{201c}offers easy passage to all true shades\x{201d} (6.1031), Aeneas and the Sibyl must go out through the Gate of Ivory. But the real question is: why did Virgil use the Odyssean gates of dreams for the two exits from the land of the dead, one for the living, one for the Roman spirits, back to temporary oblivion? The answer is suggested by Goold in his revision of Fairclough\x{2019}s Virgil (1999, note <<6.57|5a:0>>), where he writes: \x{201c}By making Aeneas leave by the gate of delusive dreams Virgil represents his vision of Rome\x{2019}s destiny as a dream which he is not to remember on his return to the real world; the poet will have us know that from the beginning of Book 7 his hero has not been endowed with superhuman knowledge to confront the problems which face him.\x{201d}",

at the mountain\x{2019}s hollow flank and out charge the winds 
through the breach he\x{2019}d made, like armies on attack 
in a blasting whirlwind tearing through the earth. 
Down they crash on the sea, the Eastwind, Southwind, 
all as one with the Southwest\x{2019}s squalls in hot pursuit, 
heaving up from the ocean depths huge killer-breakers 
rolling toward the beaches. The crews are shouting,

as pitch-black night comes brooding down on the sea 
with thunder crashing pole to pole, bolt on bolt 
blazing across the heavens\x{2014}death, everywhere 
men facing instant death. 
At once Aeneas, limbs limp in the chill of fear, 
groans and lifting both his palms toward the stars 
cries out: \x{201c}<<Three|9k:0>>, four times blest, my comrades 
lucky to die beneath the soaring walls of Troy\x{2014}

where mighty Sarpedon lies, where the Simois River 
swallows down and churns beneath its tides so many 
shields and helmets and corpses of the brave!\x{201d} 
Flinging cries 
as a screaming gust of the Northwind pounds against his sail, 
raising waves sky-high. The oars shatter, prow twists round, 
taking the breakers broadside on and over Aeneas\x{2019} decks 
a mountain of water towers, massive, steep. 
Some men hang on billowing crests, some as the sea 
gapes, glimpse through the waves the bottom waiting, 
a surge aswirl with sand. 
Three ships the Southwind grips 
and spins against those boulders lurking in mid-ocean\x{2014}

One ship 
that carried the Lycian units led by staunch Orontes\x{2014}
before Aeneas\x{2019} eyes a toppling summit of water 
strikes the stern and hurls the helmsman overboard, 
pitching him headfirst, twirling his ship three times, 
right on the spot till the ravenous whirlpool gulps her down. 
Here and there you can sight some sailors bobbing in heavy seas, 
strewn in the welter now the weapons, men, stray spars 
and treasures saved from Troy. 
Now Ilioneus\x{2019} sturdy ship, 
now brave Achates\x{2019}, now the galley that carried Abas, 
another, aged Aletes, yes, the storm routs them all, 
down to the last craft the joints split, beams spring 
and the lethal flood pours in. 
All the while Neptune 
sensed the furor above him, the roaring seas first and 
the storm breaking next\x{2014}his standing waters boiling up 
from the sea-bed, churning back. And the mighty god, 
stirred to his depths, lifts his head from the crests 
and serene in power, gazing out over all his realm, 
he sees Aeneas\x{2019} squadrons scattered across the ocean, 
Trojans overwhelmed by the surf and the wild crashing skies. 
Nor did he miss his sister Juno\x{2019}s cunning wrath at work. 
He summons the East- and Westwind, takes them to task:

You winds, you dare make heaven and earth a chaos, 
raising such a riot of waves without my blessings. 
You\x{2014}what I won\x{2019}t do! But first I had better set 
to rest the flood you ruffled so. Next time, trust me, 
you will pay for your crimes with more than just a scolding. 
Away with you, quick! And give your king this message: 
Power over the sea and ruthless trident is mine, 
not his\x{2014}it\x{2019}s mine by lot, by destiny. His place,

            "Jove had spoken. Mercury made ready at once 
to obey the great commands of his almighty father. 
First he fastens under his feet the golden sandals, 
winged to sweep him over the waves and earth alike 
with the rush of gusting winds. Then he seizes the wand 
that calls the pallid spirits up from the Underworld 
and ushers others down to the grim dark depths, 
the wand that lends us sleep or sends it away, 
that unseals our eyes in death. Equipped with this, 
he spurs the winds and swims through billowing clouds 
till in mid-flight he spies the summit and rugged flanks 
of Atlas, whose long-enduring peak supports the skies. 
Atlas: his pine-covered crown is forever girded 
round with black clouds, battered by wind and rain; 
driving blizzards cloak his shoulders with snow, 
torrents course down from the old Titan\x{2019}s chin 
and shaggy beard that bristles stiff with ice. 
Here the god of Cyllene landed first, 
banking down to a stop on balanced wings. 
From there, headlong down with his full weight 
he plunged to the sea as a seahawk skims the waves, 
rounding the beaches, rounding cliffs to hunt for fish inshore. 
So Mercury of Cyllene flew between the earth and sky 
to gain the sandy coast of Libya, cutting the winds 
that sweep down from his mother\x{2019}s father, Atlas. 
Soon 
as his winged feet touched down on the first huts in sight, 
he spots Aeneas founding the city fortifications, 
building homes in Carthage. And his sword-hilt 
is studded with tawny jasper stars, a cloak 
of glowing Tyrian purple drapes his shoulders, 
a gift that the wealthy queen had made herself, 
weaving into the weft a glinting mesh of gold. 
Mercury lashes out at once: \x{201c}You, so now you lay 
foundation stones for the soaring walls of Carthage! 
Building her gorgeous city, doting on your wife. 
Blind to your own realm, oblivious to your fate! 
The King of the Gods, whose power sways earth and sky\x{2014}
he is the one who sends me down from brilliant Olympus, 
bearing commands for you through the racing winds. 
What are you plotting now? 
Wasting time in Libya\x{2014}what hope misleads you so? 
If such a glorious destiny cannot fire your spirit, 
[if you will not shoulder the task for your own fame,] 
at least remember Ascanius rising into his prime, 
the hopes you lodge in Iulus, your only heir\x{2014}
you owe him Italy\x{2019}s realm, the land of Rome!\x{201d} 
This order still on his lips, the god vanished 
from sight into empty air. 
Then Aeneas 
was truly overwhelmed by the vision, stunned, 
his hackles bristle with fear, his voice chokes in his throat. 
He yearns to be gone, to desert this land he loves, 
thunderstruck by the warnings, Jupiter\x{2019}s command . . . 
But what can he do? What can he dare say now 
to the queen in all her fury and win her over? 
Where to begin, what opening? Thoughts racing, 
here, there, probing his options, turning 
to this plan, that plan\x{2014}torn in two until, 
at his wits\x{2019} end, this answer seems the best. 
He summons Mnestheus, Sergestus, staunch Serestus, 
gives them orders: \x{201c}Fit out the fleet, but not a word. 
Muster the crews on shore, all tackle set to sail, 
but the cause for our new course, you keep it secret.\x{201d} 
Yet he himself, since Dido who means the world to him 
knows nothing, never dreaming such a powerful love 
could be uprooted\x{2014}he will try to approach her, 
find the moment to break the news gently, 
a way to soften the blow that he must leave. 
All shipmates snap to commands, 
glad to do his orders. 
True, but the queen\x{2014}
who can delude a lover?\x{2014}soon caught wind 
of a plot afoot, the first to sense the Trojans 
are on the move . . . She fears everything now, 
even with all secure. Rumor, vicious as ever, 
brings her word, already distraught, that Trojans 
are rigging out their galleys, gearing to set sail. 
She rages in helpless frenzy, blazing through 
the entire city, raving like some Maenad 
driven wild when the women shake the sacred emblems, 
when the cyclic orgy, shouts of \x{201c}Bacchus!\x{201d} fire her on

            "So, driven by madness, beaten down by anguish, 
Dido was fixed on dying, working out in her mind 
the means, the moment. She approaches her grieving 
sister, Anna\x{2014}masking her plan with a brave face 
aglow with hope, and says: \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve found a way, 
dear heart\x{2014}rejoice with your sister\x{2014}either 
to bring him back in love for me or free me 
of love for him. Close to the bounds of Ocean, 
west with the setting sun, lies Ethiopian land, 
the end of the earth, where colossal Atlas turns 
on his shoulder the heavens studded with flaming stars. 
From there, I have heard, a Massylian priestess comes 
who tended the temple held by Hesperian daughters. 
She\x{2019}d safeguard the boughs in the sacred grove 
and ply the dragon with morsels dripping loops 
of oozing honey and poppies drowsy with slumber. 
With her spells she vows to release the hearts 
of those she likes, to inflict raw pain on others\x{2014}
to stop the rivers in midstream, reverse the stars 
in their courses, raise the souls of the dead at night 
and make earth shudder and rumble underfoot\x{2014}you\x{2019}ll see\x{2014}
and send the ash trees marching down the mountains. 
I swear by the gods, dear Anna, by your sweet life, 
I arm myself with magic arts against my will. 
\x{201c}Now go, 
build me a pyre in secret, deep inside our courtyard 
under the open sky. Pile it high with his arms\x{2014}
he left them hanging within our bridal chamber\x{2014}
the traitor, so devoted then! and all his clothes 
and crowning it all, the bridal bed that brought my doom. 
I must obliterate every trace of the man, the curse, 
and the priestess shows the way!\x{201d} 
She says no more 
and now as the queen falls silent, pallor sweeps her face. 
Still, Anna cannot imagine these outlandish rites 
would mask her sister\x{2019}s death. She can\x{2019}t conceive 
of such a fiery passion. She fears nothing graver 
than Dido\x{2019}s grief at the death of her Sychaeus. 
So she does as she is told. 
But now the queen, 
as soon as the pyre was built beneath the open sky, 
towering up with pitch-pine and cut logs of oak\x{2014}
deep in the heart of her house\x{2014}she drapes the court 
with flowers, crowning the place with wreaths of death, 
and to top it off she lays his arms and the sword he left 
and an effigy of Aeneas, all on the bed they\x{2019}d shared, 
for well she knows the future. Altars ring the pyre. 
Hair loose in the wind, the priestess thunders out 
the names of her three hundred gods, Erebus, Chaos 
and triple Hecate, Diana the three-faced virgin. 
She\x{2019}d sprinkled water, simulating the springs of hell, 
and gathered potent herbs, reaped with bronze sickles 
under the moonlight, dripping their milky black poison, 
and fetched a love-charm ripped from a foal\x{2019}s brow, 
just born, before the mother could gnaw it off. 
And Dido herself, standing before the altar, 
holding the sacred grain in reverent hands\x{2014}
with one foot free of its sandal, robes unbound\x{2014}
sworn now to die, she calls on the gods to witness, 
calls on the stars who know her approaching fate. 
And then to any Power above, mindful, evenhanded, 
who watches over lovers bound by unequal passion, 
Dido says her prayers. 
The dead of night, 
and weary living creatures throughout the world 
are enjoying peaceful sleep. The woods and savage seas 
are calm, at rest, and the circling stars are gliding on 
in their <<midnight|13>> courses, all the fields lie hushed 
and the flocks and gay and gorgeous birds that haunt 
the deep clear pools and the thorny country thickets 
all lie quiet now, under the silent night, asleep. 
But not the tragic queen . . . 
torn in spirit, Dido will not dissolve 
into sleep\x{2014}her eyes, her mind won\x{2019}t yield tonight. 
Her torments multiply, over and over her passion 
surges back into heaving waves of rage\x{2014}
she keeps on brooding, obsessions roil her heart: 
\x{201c}And now, what shall I do? Make a mockery of myself, 
go back to my old suitors, tempt them to try again? 
Beg the Numidians, grovel, plead for a husband\x{2014}
though time and again I scorned to wed their like? 
What then? Trail the Trojan ships, bend to the Trojans\x{2019} 
every last demand? So pleased, are they, with all the help, 
the relief I lent them once? And memory of my service past 
stands firm in grateful minds! And even if I were willing, 
would the Trojans allow me to board their proud ships\x{2014}
a woman they hate? Poor lost fool, can\x{2019}t you sense it, 
grasp it yet\x{2014}the treachery of Laomedon\x{2019}s breed? 
What now? Do I take flight alone, consorting 
with crews of Trojan oarsmen in their triumph? 
Or follow them out with all my troops of Tyrians 
thronging the decks? Yes, hard as it was to uproot 
them once from Tyre! How can I force them back to sea 
once more, command them to spread their sails to the winds? 
No, no, die! 
You deserve it\x{2014}
end your pain with the sword! 
You, my sister, you were the first, won over by my tears, 
to pile these sorrows on my shoulders, mad as I was, 
to throw me into my enemy\x{2019}s arms. If only I\x{2019}d been free

Little Ajax, son of Oileus, is to be distinguished from Great Ajax, son of Telamon, the hero of Sophocles\x{2019} play who committed suicide before Troy fell and, questioned by Ulysses (Odysseus) in the Underworld, refused to speak (Odyssey 11.617-49).

The mention of RHESUS (567-73) alludes to the events narrated in Iliad 10. Diomedes and Ulysses raid the Trojan camp at night and kill the recently arrived Rhesus, a Thracian ally of Troy. They then drive his magnificent horses back to the Greek camp, because an oracle had said that if the horses could crop the grass of Troy or drink from the river Xanthus, the city would not fall. TROILUS (573-79), a very young warrior, is killed by Achilles (not in the Iliad; his story comes from later epic work). The Trojan women (579-83) are seen as unsuccessful suppliants of Athena, who refuses, as in the Iliad (6.338-66), to divert the battle fury of Diomedes from the Trojans. In the Iliad (Books <<22-25|5a:0>>), Achilles drags the body of Hector (Aeneid 1.583-89) not around the walls of Troy but around the tomb of Patroclus, and gives his body back to Priam, his father.
