            'The first theory of higher dimensions was called Kaluza-Klein theory, <<after two|9:0>> scientists who proposed a new theory of gravity in which light could be explained as vibrations in the fifth dimension. When extended to N-dimensional space (where N can stand for any whole number), the clumsy-looking theories of subatomic particles dramatically take on a startling symmetry. The old Kaluza-Klein theory, however, could not determine the correct value of N, and there were technical problems in describing all the subatomic particles. A more advanced version of this theory, called supergravity theory, also had problems. The recent interest in the theory was sparked in 1984 by physicists Michael Green and John Schwarz, who proved the consistency of the most advanced version of Kaluza-Klein theory, called superstring theory, which postulates that all matter consists of tiny vibrating strings. Surprisingly, the superstring theory predicts a precise number of dimensions for space and time: ten.',

Although the energy scale necessary to manipulate hyperspace is astronomically large, these scientists point out that scientific growth will probably continue to rise exponentially over the next centuries, exceeding the capabilities of human minds to grasp it. Since World War II, the sum total of scientific knowledge has doubled every <<10 to 20|10a:0>> or so years, so the progress of science and technology into the twenty-first century may surpass our wildest expectations.

            "For example, for an ordinary two-dimensional surface, Riemann introduced a collection of three numbers at every point that completely describe the bending of that surface. Riemann found that in four spatial dimensions, one needs a collection of ten numbers at each point to describe its properties. No matter how crumpled or distorted the space, this collection of ten numbers at each point is sufficient to encode all the information about that space. Let us label these ten numbers by the symbols g11, g12, g13,\x{2026}. (When analyzing a four-dimensional space, the lower index can range from <<one to four|10a:0>>.) Then Riemann\x{2019}s collection of ten numbers can be symmetrically arranged as in Figure 2.3. (It appears as though there are 16 components. However, g12 = g21, g13 = g31, and so on, so there are actually only ten independent components.) Today, this collection of numbers is called the Riemann metric tensor. Roughly speaking, the greater the value of the metric tensor, the greater the crumpling of the sheet. No matter how crumpled the sheet of paper, the metric tensor gives us a simple means of measuring its curvature at any point. If we flattened the crumpled sheet completely, then we would retrieve the formula of Pythagoras.",

What astonished Einstein was that once the five-dimensional field theory was broken down to a four-dimensional field theory, both Maxwell\x{2019}s and Einstein\x{2019}s equations remained.
