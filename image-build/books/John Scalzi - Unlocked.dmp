            "I was supposed to get three minutes with the First Lady before she went up and gave her speech, but when we arrived we were told by her press secretary Jean Allison that she wasn\x{2019}t going to give any pre-speech interviews. Well, I was more than a little annoyed by this. The only reason we were at the Jamboree at all was because we were promised face time, otherwise we would have just had a cameraman do crowd shots for the last two minutes of the <<6:30|2>> broadcast. I told Jean that, and reminded her that it was her office who set up the interview, not us. She apologized and kind of ducked in toward me and said \x{201c}look, she\x{2019}s really not feeling well and we\x{2019}re just trying to get her through this thing,\x{201d} and that she would make it up to me. Then she walked off.",

            "Nevertheless <<around midnight|13>> I came into the room just before heading home myself. The President was sitting on his wife\x{2019}s bed, facing away from me, holding her hand. I could hear him talking to her quietly. Most of it I couldn\x{2019}t make out, but once or twice I heard him say, \x{201c}Tell me what I should do. Tell me what I need to do, Margie. Tell me.\x{201d}",

            "Kenny and I came into the Oval Office at <<8am|5>> the next morning and were surprised that the President already had the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Speaker of the House, and the Majority Leader of the Senate in there with him. We had been under the impression that the meeting would be the usual agenda setter between me, Kenny, and the President. The looks we got from every other member of the meeting suggested to us that they were at least as surprised to be at the meeting as we were. We found out after the meeting that the President called each of them personally at <<around 5am|5>> and told them to be in the Oval Office or face the consequences, \x{201c}the consequences\x{201d} being unspecified but dire. He didn\x{2019}t call me or Kenny, I suppose, because he knew we were coming anyway.",

            "So every week I printed them out. Most weeks I didn\x{2019}t look at them, but one evening I was out with friends and remembered that I forgot to do the spreadsheet, and I didn\x{2019}t want to be known as so inept that I couldn\x{2019}t even do that. So I left the party early \x{2014}<<11pm|5>>\x{2014}and went back to the office to run off the report. As I was collating the paper I actually looked at the report and noticed one printer had a weird usage pattern. It usually went off-shift at <<10pm|5>>, which was the end of our second shift, but every day in the last week it was active between <<11pm|5>> and <<midnight|13>>. So I pulled up the real-time monitor and saw the printer was running right at that moment. I went down to the printer floor to see what was going on and there was Charlie, printing out something that looked like a hand. He looked very surprised to see me.",
