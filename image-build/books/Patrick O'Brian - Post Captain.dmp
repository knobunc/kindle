            'They had been hunting since <<half past ten|10>>, and now the sun was low. They had killed two foxes, and the third, a barren vixen, had led them a rare old dance, right away into the heavy country beyond Plimpton with its wet plough, double oxers, and wide ditches. She was now only one field ahead, failing fast and heading for a drain she knew. At the last check Jack had a lucky inspiration to bear away right-handed, a short-cut that brought him and Sophia closer to hounds than anyone in the field; but now there was a bank, a towering fence, mud in front of it and the gleam of broad water beyond. Sophia looked at the jump with dismay, put her tired horse at it without any real wish to reach the other side, and felt thankful when the mare refused it. She and her mount were quite done up; Sophia had never felt so tired in her life; she dreaded the sight of the fox being torn to pieces, and the pack had just hit off the line again. There was a deadly implacable triumph in the voice of the old bitch that led them. \'The gate, the gate,\' called Jack, wheeling his horse and cantering to the corner of the field. He had it half open - an awkward, sagging, left-handed gate - when Stephen arrived. Jack heard Sophia say \'should like to go home - pray, pray go on - know the way perfectly.\' The piteous face wiped away his look of frustration; he lost his fixed \'boarders away\' expression, and smiling very kindly he said, \'I think I will turn back too: we have had enough for today.\'',

Number one\'s port-lid was jammed, its crew prising with their crows and handspikes in the confined space, thumping it with shot, hauling on the port-tackle, all smelling of brown men in violent emotion. Jack bent low under the beams, straddled the gun: with his hands hard on the carnage he lashed out backwards with all his might. Splinters and flakes of paint dropped from the port: it did not budge - seemed built into the ship. Three times. He slipped off, hobbled round to check the breeching, cried \'Bowse her up\' and as the gun\'s muzzle came hard against the port, \'Stand by, stand by.\' He pulled the laniard. A spark, a great sullen crash (damp powder, by God), and the gun leapt back under him. The acrid smoke tore out of the shattered port, and as it thinned Jack saw the sponger already at work, his swab right down the barrel of the gun, while the rest of the crew clapped on to the train-tackle. \'They know their business\' he thought with pleasure, leaning out and tearing the wreckage from its hooks. \'Crucify that God-damned gunner!\' But this was no time for reflection. Number three was still inboard. Jack and Major Hill tailed on to the side-tackles, and with \'<<One|9k:0>> - <<two|9k:0>> - <<three|9k:0>>\' they ran it up, the carriage crashing against the port-sill and the muzzle as far out as it could go.

His bandaged head, mulling about dreams, how they sometimes made sense and how sometimes they did not, suddenly shot from the pillow, all the pink happiness wiped off it. His coat, which had slipped from the back of the chair, looked exactly like the coat of yesterday.

But this was nothing to the trial of meeting Dr Maturin on the water; for Stephen had been inspired to put off from the shore at about the same time, though from a different place, and their courses converged some three furlongs from the frigate\'s side. Stephen\'s conveyance was one of the Lively\'s cutters, which saluted Jack by tossing oars, and which fell under his wherry\'s lee, so that they pulled in close company, Stephen calling out pleasantly all the way. Jack caught a frightened glance from Killick, noticed the wooden composure of the midshipman and the cutter\'s crew, saw the grinning face of Matthew Paris, an old Polychrest, Stephen\'s servant, once a framework knitter and still no kind of seaman - no notion of common propriety in his myopic, friendly gaze. And as Stephen rose to wave and hoot, Jack saw that he was dressed from head to foot in a single tight dull-brown garment; it clung to him, and his pale, delighted face emerged from a woollen roll at the top, looking unnaturally large. His general appearance was something between that of an attenuated ape and a meagre heart; and he was carrying his narwhal horn.',
