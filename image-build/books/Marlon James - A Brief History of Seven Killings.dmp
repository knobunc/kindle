            "Even before I knew I had a novel, Colin Williams was doing research for it. Some of that hard work appears in this book, but more of it will appear in the next. By the time Benjamin Voigt took over as researcher I had a narrative, even a few pages, but still not quite a novel. The problem was that I couldn\x{2019}t tell whose story it was. Draft after draft, page after page, character after character, and still no through line, no narrative spine, nothing. Until <<one|9e:0>> Sunday, at W.A. Frost in St. Paul, when I was having dinner with Rachel Perlmeter, she said what if it\x{2019}s not one person\x{2019}s story? Also, when last did I read Faulkner\x{2019}s As I Lay Dying? Well maybe not in those exact words, but we also talked about Marguerite Duras, so I went and read The North China Lover as well. I had a novel, and it was right in front of me all that time. Half-formed and fully formed characters, scenes out of place, hundreds of pages that needed sequence and purpose. A novel that would be driven only by voice. At the very least I knew what to tell my other researchers, Kenneth Barrett and Jeeson Choi, to look for. In the meantime, thanks to a travel and research grant from Macalester College, where I teach, I was able to do quite a bit of research on my own. Without brilliant and creative students to challenge me all the time, and a strong and supportive English Department, the four years spent on this novel wouldn\x{2019}t have been quite as successful or rewarding. That one-year sabbatical didn\x{2019}t hurt either. Quite of bit of that sabbatical was spent writing at a French caf\x{e9} in South Beach, Miami, thanks to awesome support and free room and board from Tom Borrup and Harry Waters Jr., who (knock wood) have yet to charge me rent though I invent reasons to use their place all the time. In fact, the draft that I eventually showed to my wonderful agent, Ellen Levine, and fine editor, Jake Morrissey, was written not far from the actual beach. Before them of course was Robert Mclean, my first-draft reader, and still the only person I trust to read a manuscript even as I am in the process of writing it (though he is still mystified as to why). Jeffrey Bennett, my brilliant last-draft reader, line-edited the whole thing before it went off to the publisher and corrected, among other things, my wildly erroneous depiction of the drive from JFK airport to the Bronx. And thanks to Martha Dickson, who translated my loose English into Cuban Spanish when I made the mistake of thinking Mexican Spanish would do. A writer can go through days of distraction and self-doubt, so thanks to Ingrid Riley and Casey Jarrin for unwavering friendship, support and an occasional kick in the ass. Thanks to my family and friends, and this time around maybe my mother should stay away from part four of the book.",

Babies aren\x{2019}t crying in the street and women aren\x{2019}t getting raped pregnant as what happens every day in the ghetto. I\x{2019}ve seen the ghetto, been there with my father. Everybody lives in their own Jamaica and damn if that was ever going to be mine. Last week, somewhere between <<eleven p.m.|5>> and <<three a.m.|5>>, three men broke into my father\x{2019}s house. My mother is always looking for signs and wonders and for her the fact that the newspaper last week said gunmen crossed the Half Way Tree line and have started picking off targets uptown was a very bad sign. The curfew was still on and even decent uptown people had to be indoors by a certain hour, six, eight, who knows, or they would be up for grabs. Last month Mr. Jacobs from four houses down was coming home from night service and the police stopped him, threw him in the back of the van and sent him to the Gun Court lockup. He would still be there if Daddy didn\x{2019}t find a judge to tell him that this was straight foolishness when we start to lock up even proper law-abiding people. Neither man mentioned that Mr. Jacobs was too dark-skinned for police to assume he was proper people, even in a gabardine suit. Then gunmen broke into our house. They took my parents\x{2019} wedding rings, all my mother\x{2019}s figurines from Holland, three hundred dollars, all her costume earrings even though she told them they\x{2019}re worth nothing, and his watch. They punched my father a couple times, and slapped my mother when she asked one of them if his mother knew that he was sinning. I asked her if any of the men had their way with her but said the rosebush was growing wild like a leggo beast, and I pretended I was talking to somebody else. The policeman didn\x{2019}t come until the morning even though they called the station all night. <<Nine-thirty in the morning|5>>, long after I got there (they didn\x{2019}t call me until six), and he took a statement on a yellow pad with a red pen.

Fifteen more man jump out of the other five, everybody have M16. Josey and him posse sweep down the road, and man, woman and pickney running and screaming. A man and a woman run to they house but Josey follow close and clip the two right by they door. Man open fire and shoot up all playing domino, two man try to run but got trap in the bullet dance. Woman grabbing pickney and running. The posse run from house to house, fence to fence, sticking they hand over the zinc and ratatatat. Where the men be? Nineteen gunmen run and fire, people running mad like ants. Josey Wales walk, he never run. He see a target, consider it, walk up slow and kill. Posse men mark a pattern in the zinc with bullet. Somebody shoot a pickney. The woman screaming too loud and bawling too long so Josey walk up to her and put the gun right the back of her head. Josey and the posse draw away from Rema, twelve people dead. Police draw down on Copenhagen City and take away two gun, but that is all. Nobody can touch the don.",

This made man from Southside that grew into a bloated check that the mob wanted cashed. Picked up the tab at Denny\x{2019}s and talked business. They said how\x{2019}s about five hundred bucks and you and your broski Paco rub out this dude named Eustace. Eustace? Him some kinda faggot? Paco said. Mob guy didn\x{2019}t answer. It was simple enough: At <<nine-ten|5b>> on Tuesdays his wife stepped out for choir practice while he sat down with his own projector, in the basement, cigar in one hand dick in the other, while he jacked himself silly to Cherry Poppers 1\x{2013}4. Paco bailed because he said he\x{2019}s a thief, not a killer. Made it halfway down the basement before the guy heard me, but with one hand on his johnson and the other way up somewhere most men don\x{2019}t think about, there was no hand to draw for the gun. I couldn\x{2019}t stop shooting. The noise was so loud at first I didn\x{2019}t hear the wife screaming. She ran away and I ran after, praying she did not reach the door. She reached the door and ran out screaming. So there we were, running down Martin Street, she in her nightie and bunny slippers screaming like her throat half cut, me behind her. Popped her off in the middle of the road, just as two station wagons passed. One stopped so I fired into the rear windshield and kept firing until they drove off and crashed into a tree seventy yards or so. With shit done I had to leave Chicago.",
