            "Old bones continue the story. By around 2.3 million years ago, the first tentative record emerges of a new species, a habiline. Habilines, still poorly understood, are the \x{201c}missing link\x{201d} between apes and humans. They were truly missing until <<1960|9c:0>>, when Jonathan Leakey, the twenty-year-old son of paleontologist Louis Leakey and archaeologist Mary Leakey, discovered them in the form of a jaw, skull, and hand in Tanzania\x{2019}s Olduvai Gorge. Even now there are only six skulls that tell us the brain size of the principal species, and just two reasonably complete specimens showing their limbs, so our portraits of these intermediate beings are fuzzy. Habilines appear to have been about the same small size as australopithecines and had long arms and jutting faces, leading some people to call them apes. Yet they are thought to be the knife makers, and they had brains twice as big as those of living nonhuman apes, so others place them in the genus Homo and thereby call them human. In short, they show a mixture of prehuman and human characteristics. They were like upright chimpanzees with big brains, and we might guess they were just as hairy and almost as good at climbing trees.",

Lunch was a salad of sunflower greens, sprouted fenugreek seeds, sprouted broccoli seeds, fermented cabbage, and a loaf made of sprouted sunflower seeds, dehydrated seaweed, and some vegetables. Dinner was more sprouts, avocado chunks, pineapple, red onion, olive oil, raw vinegar, and sea salt. An hour later she was hungry again. In photographs she looks distinctly thin, but she was happy. She described herself as feeling energized, mentally sharper, and more serene. Nevertheless, after six months, during which she lost 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms), she could not resist slipping out for a pizza. Mardesich was not alone in finding a wholly raw diet a challenge. The Giessen Raw Food study found that 82 percent of long-term raw-foodists included some cooked food in their diets.",

Our empty stomachs are highly acidic thanks to the secretions of a billion acid-producing cells that line the stomach wall and secrete <<one to two|10a:0>> liters of hydrochloric acid a day. Food entering the stomach buffers the acidity and causes a more neutral pH, but the stomach cells respond rapidly and secrete enough acid to return the stomach to its original intense low pH, less than 2. This intense acidity has at least three functions: it kills bacteria that enter with the food, activates the digestive enzyme pepsin, and denatures proteins. Denaturation looks particularly important.',

Following Aiello and Wheeler\x{2019}s hypothesis, australopithecine diets should therefore have been higher in quality than the diets of living chimpanzees. This seems likely. During seasons of plenty, australopithecines would have eaten much the same diet as chimpanzees or baboons do when living in the kinds of woodland that australopithecines occupied\x{2014}fruits, occasional honey, soft seeds, and other choice plant items. It was when fruits were scarce that australopithecines must have eaten better than their chimpanzee-like ancestors. Present-day chimpanzees that are short of fruit turn to items specific to their rain-forest homes, eating foliage such as the stems of giant herbs and the soft young leaves of forest trees. In their drier woodlands australopithecines would have found few such items. The most likely alternatives were starch-filled roots and other underground or underwater storage tissues of herbaceous plants. These would have been ideal.",

Humans comparatively bolt their food. If adults eat 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day, as many people do, the fact that they chew for only about one hour per day means that the average intake rate will average 2,000 to 2,500 calories an hour or higher, or more than six times the rate for a chimpanzee. The rate is doubtless much more when people eat high-calorie foods, such as hamburgers, candy bars, and holiday feasts. Humans have clearly had a long history of much more intense calorie consumption than primates are used to. Thanks to cooking, we save ourselves around four hours of chewing time per day.',

But nutritionists have long recognized important limitations in the Atwater convention, so it has been modified in various ways. One way was to make the general factors more specific. In 1955 the Atwater specific-factor system was introduced to take advantage of a half century of nutritional biochemistry research. For example, the energy value of different types of protein is known to vary: egg protein produces <<4.36|5a:0>> kcal/gram, whereas brown rice protein produces <<3.41|5a:0>> kcal/gram, and so on. An exhaustive list of such variants has been compiled.",

In fact, although the specific-factor system lends greater precision, the overall effects of the changes are so small that some nutritionists (particularly those in Britain) still prefer to use general factors, albeit modified since Atwater\x{2019}s time.",

            "65 Cooking increased the protein value of eggs by around 40 percent: The discovery that we do not digest raw egg protein nearly as well as cooked egg protein is the first to identify the effects of heat on the digestibility of protein in the human gut. But the evidence that raw eggs are a relatively poor food has been hinted at by other studies. For example, allergy researchers collected breast milk from women who had eaten either raw or cooked eggs for breakfast. They found that the concentration of ovalbumin rose in breast milk after eating eggs, and that the rise was about twice as fast when eggs were cooked as when they were raw. Again, the cooked eggs appeared more digestible. Allergy study: Palmer et al. (2005). The recent data about the effects of cooking on digestibility of eggs were anticipated by at least two groups. Hawk (1919) claimed his research team had evidence that raw egg white is used less completely than cooked egg white. Cohn (1936) showed that rats grew poorly on diets rich in raw egg white compared to those eating cooked egg white. She attributed this partly to the anti-trypsin factor and partly to raw egg proteins being passed more rapidly than cooked egg proteins from the stomach to the small intestine, an effect also found by Evenepoel et al. (1998). Cohn\x{2019}s suggestion that a rapid gastric emptying rate might be responsible for the poor energy supply from raw eggs is not supported by modern data. First, in recent decades the idea that the stomach was responsible for a large proportion of digestion has given way to the orthodoxy that most digestion occurs in the small intestine. Second, Evenepoel et al. (1998) found no difference in transit time to the ileocecal junction (the half-time averaged <<5.3 hours|1>> in both cases). This meant that raw eggs spent more time than cooked eggs in the small intestine, where digestive processes are most active, so they should have been better digested than the cooked eggs.",
