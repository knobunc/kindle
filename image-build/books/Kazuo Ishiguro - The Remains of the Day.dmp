            'TONIGHT,  I  find  myself  here in a  guest house  in  the  city  of  Salisbury.  The  first day of my trip is now completed, and all in all, I must say I am quite satisfied. This expedition began this morning almost an hour later than I had planned, despite my having  completed  my  packing  and  loaded  the  Ford  with  all  necessary  items  <<well before eight o\'clock|6>>. What with Mrs Clements and the girls also gone for the week, I  suppose  I  was  very  conscious  of  the  fact  that  once  I  departed,  Darlington  Hall would  stand  empty  for  probably  the  first  time  this  century  -  perhaps  for  the  first time since the day it was built. It was an odd feeling and perhaps accounts for why I  delayed  my  departure  so  long,  wandering  around  the  house  many  times  over, checking one last time that all was in order.',

            ".  I  suppose,  a  relatively  modest  establishment,  but  very  clean  and  perfectly adequate  for  my  needs.  The  landlady,  a  woman  of  around  forty  or  so,  appears  to regard me as a rather grand visitor on account of Mr Farraday's Ford and the high quality  of  my  suit.  This  afternoon  -  I  arrived  in  Salisbury  at  <<around  three thirty|9c:0>>  - when I entered my address in her register as 'Darlington Hall', I could see her look at me with some trepidation, assuming no doubt that I was some gentleman used to such places as the Ritz or the Dorchester and that I would storm out of her guest house on being shown my room. She informed me that a double room at the front was available, though I was welcome to it for the price of a single. I was then brought up to this room, in which, at that point of the day, the sun was lighting  up  the  floral  patterns  of  the  wallpaper  quite  agreeably.  There  were  twin beds and a pair of good-sized windows overlooking the street. On inquiring where the  bathroom  was,  the  woman  told  me  in  a  timid  voice  that  although  it  was  the door facing mine, there would be no hot water available until after supper. I asked her to bring me up a pot of tea, and when she had gone, inspected the room further. The  beds  were  perfectly  clean  and  had  been  well  made.  The  basin  in  the  corner was also very clean. On looking out of the windows, one saw on the opposite side of  the  street  a  bakery  displaying  a  variety  of  pastries,  a  chemist's  shop  and  a barber's. Further along, one could see where the street passed over a round-backed bridge  and  on  into  more  rural  surroundings.  I  refreshed  my  face  and  hands  with cold \x{b7}water at the basin, then seated myself on a hard-backed chair left near one of the windows to await my tea.",

The wide, airy nature of the streets here give  the  city  a  marvellously  spacious  feel,  so  that  I  found  it  most  easy  to  spend some hours just strolling in the gently warm sunshine. Moreover, I discovered the city  to  be  one  of  many  charms;  time  and  again,  I  found  myself  wandering  past delightful  rows  of  old  timber-fronted  houses,  or  crossing  some  little  stone footbridge over one of the many streams that flow through the city. And of course, I  did  not  fail  to  visit  the  fine  cathedral,  much  praised  by  Mrs  Symons  in  her volume.  This  august  building  was  hardly  difficult  for  me  to  locate,  its  looming spire being ever-visible wherever one goes in Salisbury. Indeed, as I was making my way back to this guest house this evening, I glanced back over my shoulder on a number of occasions and was met each time by a view of the sun setting behind that great spire.',

            'Miss Kenton and my father had arrived at the house at more or less the same time - that is to say, the spring of 1922 - as a consequence of my losing at one stroke the previous housekeeper  and under-butler.  This  had  occurred  due  to  these  latter  two persons  deciding  to  marry  one  another  and  leave  the  profession.  I  have  always found such liaisons a serious threat to the order in a house. Since that time, I have lost numerous more employees in such circumstances. Of course, one has to expect such things to occur amongst maids and footmen, and a good butler should always take  this  into  account  in  his  planning;  but  such  marrying  amongst  more  senior employees  can  have  an  extremely  disruptive  effect  on  work.  Of  course,  if  two members of staff happen to fall in love and decide to marry, it would be churlish to be  apportioning  blame;  but  what  I  find  a  major  irritation  are  those  persons  -  and housekeepers  are  particularly  guilty  here  -  who  have  no  genuine  commitment  to their  profession  and  who  are  essentially  going  from  post  to  post  looking  for romance. This sort of person is a blight on good professionalism. But let me say immediately I do not have Miss Kenton in mind at all when I say this. Of course, she too eventually left my staff to get married, but I can vouch that during  the  time  she  worked  as  housekeeper  under  me,  she  was  nothing  less  than dedicated and never allowed her professional priorities to be distracted. But I am digressing. I was explaining that we had fallen in need of a housekeeper and an under-butler at <<one|9c:0>> and the same time and Miss Kenton had arrived - with unusually good references, I recall - to take up the former post. As it happened, my father  had  around  this  time  come  to  the  end  of  his  distinguished  service  at Loughborough  House  with  the  death  of  his  employer,  Mr  John  Silvers,  and  had been at something of a loss for work and accommodation. Although he was still, of course, a professional of the highest class, he was now in his seventies and much ravaged  by  arthritis  and  other  ailments.  It  was  not  at  all  certain,  then,  how  he would fare against the younger breed of highly professionalized butlers looking for posts. In view of this, it seemed a reasonable solution to ask my father to bring his great experience and distinction to Darlington Hall.',

            'As things turned out, that particular visit was simply the first of a whole series of such  \'unofficial\'  meetings  between  Lord  Halifax  and  the  German  Ambassador  of that  time,  Herr  Ribbentrop.  But  on  that  first  night,  Lord  Halifax  had  arrived  in  a mood of great wariness; virtually his first words on being shown in were: "Really, Darlington, I don\'t know what you\'ve put me up to here. I know I shall be sorry." Herr  Ribbentrop  not  being  expected  for  a  further  hour  or  so,  his  lordship  had suggested to his guest a tour of Darlington Hall - a strategy which had helped many a nervous visitor to relax. However, as I went about my business, all I could hear for  some  time  was  Lord  Halifax,  in  various  parts  of  the  building,  continuing  to express his doubts about the evening ahead, and Lord Darlington trying in vain to reassure  him.  But  then  at  one  point  I  overheard  Lord  Halifax  exclaiming:  "My goodness,  Darlington,  the  silver  in  this  house  is  a  delight."  I  was  of  course  very pleased to hear this at the time, but what was for me the truly satisfying corollary to  this  episode  came  two  or  three  days  later,  when  Lord  Darlington  remarked  to me:  "By  the  way,  Stevens,  Lord  Halifax  was  jolly  impressed  with  the  silver  the other night. Put him into a quite different frame of mind altogether." These were - I recollect it clearly - his lordship\'s actual words and so it is not simply my fantasy that  the  state  of  the  silver  had  made  a  small,  but  significant  contribution  towards the easing of relations between Lord Halifax and Herr Ribbentrop that evening. It is probably apt at this point to say a few words concerning Herr Ribbentrop. It is, of course, generally accepted today that Herr Ribbentrop was a trickster: that it was Hitler\'s  plan  throughout  those  years  to  deceive  England  for  as  long  as  possible concerning  his  true  intentions,  and  that  Herr  Ribbentrop\'s  sole  mission  in  our country was to orchestrate this deception. As I say, this is the commonly held view and  I  do  not  wish  to  differ  with  it  here.  It  is,  however,  rather  irksome  to  have  to hear people talking today as though they were never for a moment taken in by Herr Ribbentrop - as though Lord Darlington was alone in believing Herr Ribbentrop an honourable gentleman and developing a working relationship with him.  The truth is that Herr Ribbentrop was, throughout the thirties, a well-regarded figure, even a glamorous one, in the very best houses. Particularly <<around 1936|18:1>> and 1937, I can recall  all  the  talk  in  the  servants\'  hall  from  visiting  staff  revolving  around  \'the German Ambassador\', and it was clear from what was said that many of the most distinguished ladies and gentlemen in this country were quite enamoured of him. It is, as I say, irksome to have to hear the way these same people now talk of those times,  and  in  particular,  what  some  have  said  concerning  his  lordship.  The  great hypocrisy of these persons would be instantly obvious to. you were you to see just a  few  of  their  own  guest  lists  from  those  days;  you  would  see  then  not  only  the extent  to  which  Herr  Ribbentrop  dined  at  these  same  persons\'  tables,  but  that  he often did so as guest of honour.',

            "The fact that I am now here, the fact that I came to be to all intents and purposes at the  mercy  of  Mr  and  Mrs  Taylor's  generosity  on  this  night,  is  attributable  to  one foolish,  infuriatingly  simple  oversight:  namely,  I  allowed  the  Ford  to  run  out  of petrol. What with this and the trouble yesterday concerning the lack of water in the radiator,  it  would  not  be  unreasonable  for  an  observer  to  believe  such  general disorganization endemic to my nature. It may be pointed out, of course, that as far as  long-distance  motoring  is  concerned,  I  am  something  of  a  novice,  and  such simple oversights are only to be expected. And yet, when one remembers that good organization and foresight are qualities that lie at the very heart of one's profession, it is hard to avoid the feeling that one has, somehow, let oneself down again. But  it  is  true,  I  had  been  considerably  distracted  during  the  last  hour  or  so  of motoring  prior  to  the  petrol  running  out.  I  had  planned  to  lodge  the  night  in  the town of Tavistock, where I arrived <<a little before eight o'clock|6>>. At the town's main inn,  however,  I  was  informed  all  the  rooms  were  occupied  on  account  of  a  local agricultural fair. Several other establishments were suggested to me, but though I called at each, I was met every time with the same apology. Finally, at a boarding house on the edge of the town, the landlady suggested I motor on several miles to a roadside inn run by a relative of hers - which, she assured me, was bound to have vacancies, being too far out of Tavistock to be affected by the fair. She had given me thorough directions, which had seemed clear enough at the time, and  it  is  impossible'\x{b7}  to  say  now  whose  fault  it  was  that  I  subsequently  failed  to find any trace of this roadside establishment. Instead, after fifteen minutes or so of motoring, I found myself out on a long road curving across bleak, open moorland. On  either  side  of  me  were  what  appeared  to  be  fields  of  marsh,  and  a  mist  was rolling  across  my  path.  To  my  left,  I  could  see  the  last  glow  of  the  sunset.  The skyline  was  broken  here  and  there  by  the  shapes  of  barns  and  farmhouses  some way away over the fields, but otherwise, I appeared to have left behind all signs of community.",
