At first he could see the dim outline of each rung as he grasped it, and the rough grey texture of the stone behind, but as he climbed the black grew thicker. <<Thirteen fourteen|5k:0>> <<fifteen sixteen|5k:0>>. By thirty, his arms trembled with the strain of pulling. He paused a moment to catch his breath and glanced down. A circle of faint light shone far below, half obscured by his own feet. Tyrion resumed his ascent. Thirty-nine forty forty-one. By fifty, his legs burned. The ladder was endless, numbing. Sixty-eight sixty-nine seventy. By eighty, his back was a dull agony. Yet still he climbed. He could not have said why. <<One thirteen|5k:0>> <<one fourteen|5k:0>> <<one fifteen|5k:0>>.',

            "\x{201c}Many of my brothers have proved themselves in battle. It is not enough. Some matters cannot be settled with a battleaxe. Maester Aemon will understand that, though Cotter Pyke does not. The Lord Commander of the Night\x{2019}s Watch is a lord, first and foremost. He must be able to treat with other lords\x{2026} and with kings as well. He must be a man worthy of respect.\x{201d} Ser Denys leaned forward. \x{201c}We are the sons of great lords, you and I. We know the importance of birth, blood, and that early training that can ne\x{2019}er be replaced. I was a squire at <<twelve|9c:1>>, a knight at eighteen, a champion at two-and-twenty. I have been the commander at the Shadow Tower for thirty-three years. Blood, birth, and training have fitted me to deal with kings. Pyke\x{2026} well, did you hear him this morning, asking if His Grace would wipe his bottom? Samwell, it is not my habit to speak unkindly of my brothers, but let us be frank\x{2026} the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves, and Cotter Pyke was raping and murdering when he was still half a boy. Maester Harmune reads and writes his letters, and has for years. No, loath as I am to disappoint Maester Aemon, I could not in honor stand aside for Pyke of Eastwatch.\x{201d}",
