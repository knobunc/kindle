            "It was my turn to say \x{2018}Of course\x{2019}. I thought for a moment and told the driver the name of a small bar in the K\x{e4}rntnerstrasse. I didn\x{2019}t think he\x{2019}d want to be seen for a while in a busy British bar full of transit officers and their wives. This bar \x{2013} perhaps because it was exorbitant in its prices \x{2013} seldom had more than one self-occupied couple in it at a time. The trouble was too that it really only had one drink \x{2013} a sweet chocolate liqueur that the waiter improved at a price with cognac \x{2013} but I got the impression that Martins had no objection to any drink so long as it cast a veil over the present and the past. On the door was the usual notice saying the bar opened from <<six till ten|10>>, but one just pushed the door and walked through the front rooms. We had a whole small room to ourselves; the only couple were next door, and the waiter, who knew me, left us alone with some caviare sandwiches. It was lucky that we both knew I had an expense account.",

I would suggest two lectures: \x{201c}The Crisis of Faith in the Western World\x{201d} (you are very respected here as a Christian writer, but this lecture should be quite unpolitical and no references should be made to Russia or Communism) and \x{201c}The Technique of the Contemporary Novel\x{201d}. The same lectures would be given in Vienna. Apart from this, there are a great many people here who would like to meet you, and I want to arrange a cocktail party for early next week. But for all this I must have a few words with you.\x{2019} The letter ended on a note of acute anxiety. \x{2018}You will be at the discussion tomorrow night, won\x{2019}t you?

            "The original police agreement in Vienna between the Allies confined the military police (who had to deal with crimes involving allied personnel) to their particular zones, unless permission was given to them to enter the zone of another Power. This agreement worked well enough between the three Western Powers. I only had to get on the phone to my opposite number in the American or French zones before I sent in my men to make an arrest or pursue an investigation. During the first six months of the occupation it had worked reasonably well with the Russians: perhaps forty-eight hours would pass before I received permission, and in practice there are few occasions when it is necessary to work quicker than that. Even at home it is not always possible to obtain a search warrant or permission from one\x{2019}s superiors to detain a suspect with any greater speed. Then the forty-eight hours turned into a week or a fortnight, and I remember my American colleague suddenly taking a look at his records and discovering that there were forty cases dating back more than three months where not even an acknowledgement of his requests had been received. Then the trouble started. We began to turn down, or not to answer, the Russian requests, and sometimes without permission they would send in police, and there were clashes. . . . At the date of this story the Western Powers had more or less ceased to put in applications or reply to the Russian ones. This meant that if I wanted to pick up Kurtz it would be as well to catch him outside the Russian zone, though of course it was always possible his activities might offend the Russians and his punishment be more sudden and severe than any we should inflict. Well, the Anna Schmidt case was one of the clashes: when Rollo Martins went drunkenly back at <<four o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> to tell Anna that he had seen the ghost of Harry, he was told by a frightened porter who had not yet gone back to sleep that she had been taken away by the International Patrol.",

He had only to rise once again through the ground, walk fifty yards, bring Martins back with him, and sink again into the obscurity of the sewers. He had no idea that this method of evasion was known to us: he probably knew that one patrol of the sewer police ended before <<midnight|13>>, and the next did not start till <<two|9f>>, and so at <<midnight|13>> Martins sat in the little cold caf\x{e9} in sight of the kiosk, drinking coffee after coffee. I had lent him a revolver; I had men posted as close to the kiosk as I could, and the sewer police were ready when zero hour struck to close the manholes and start sweeping the sewers inwards from the edge of the city. But I intended, if I could, to catch him before he went underground again. It would save trouble \x{2013} and risk to Martins. So there, as I say, in the caf\x{e9} Martins sat.",
