gloamings. The features of the town had a keen interest for
Elizabeth\'s mother, now that the human side came to the fore. As
soon as they had wandered about they could see that the stockade of
gnarled trees which framed in Casterbridge was itself an avenue,
standing on a low green bank or escarpment, with a ditch yet
visible without. Within the avenue and bank was a wall more or less
discontinuous, and within the wall were packed the abodes of the
burghers.',

of stone-crop and grass almost as far up as the very battlements.
From this tower the clock struck <<eight|11>>, and thereupon a bell began
to toll with a peremptory clang. The curfew was still rung in
Casterbridge, and it was utilized by the inhabitants as a signal
for shutting their shops. No sooner did the deep notes of the bell
throb between the house-fronts than a clatter of shutters arose

up the High Street, in no great hurry; for to herself her position
was only that of a poor relation deputed to hunt up a rich one. The
front doors of the private houses were mostly left open at this
warm autumn time, no thought of umbrella stealers disturbing the
minds of the placid burgesses. Hence, through the long, straight,
entrance passages thus unclosed could be seen, as through tunnels,
the mossy gardens at the back, glowing with nasturtiums, fuchsias,
scarlet geraniums, "bloody warriors," snapdragons, and dahlias,
this floral blaze being backed by crusted grey stone-work remaining
from a yet remoter Casterbridge than the venerable one visible in
the street. The old-fashioned fronts of these houses, which had
older than old-fashioned backs, rose sheer from the pavement, into
which the bow windows protruded like bastions, necessitating a
pleasing chassez-dechassez movement to the time-pressed pedestrian
at every few yards. He was bound also to evolve other Terpsichorean
figures in respect of door-steps, scrapers, cellar-hatches, church
buttresses, and the overhanging angles of walls which, originally
unobtrusive, had become bow-legged and knock-kneed.',

opposite extremities of its diameter north and south. From its
sloping internal form it might have been called the spittoon of the
Jotuns. It was to Casterbridge what the ruined Coliseum is to
modern Rome, and was nearly of the same magnitude. The dusk of
evening was the proper hour at which a true impression of this
suggestive place could be received. Standing in the middle of the
arena at that time there by degrees became apparent its real
vastness, which a cursory view from the summit at <<noon-day|13>> was apt
to obscure. Melancholy, impressive, lonely, yet accessible from
every part of the town, the historic circle was the frequent spot
for appointments of a furtive kind. Intrigues were arranged there;
tentative meetings were there experimented after divisions and
feuds. But one kind of appointment\x{2014}in itself the most common of
any\x{2014}seldom had place in the Amphitheatre: that of happy lovers.",

sequestered spot for interviews, the cheerfullest form of those
occurrences never took kindly to the soil of the ruin, would be a
curious inquiry. Perhaps it was because its associations had about
them something sinister. Its history proved that. Apart from the
sanguinary nature of the games originally played therein, such
incidents attached to its past as these: that for scores of years
the town-gallows had stood at one corner; that in 1705 a woman who
had murdered her husband was half-strangled and then burnt there in
the presence of ten thousand spectators. Tradition reports that at
a certain stage of the burning her heart burst and leapt out of her
body, to the terror of them all, and that not one of those ten
thousand people ever cared particularly for hot roast after that.
In addition to these old tragedies, pugilistic encounters almost to
the death had come off down to recent dates in that secluded arena,
entirely invisible to the outside world save by climbing to the top
of the enclosure, which few towns-people in the daily round of
their lives ever took the trouble to do. So that, though close to

South Walk; and then from both quarters simultaneously. She moved
on to the bottom of Corn Street, and, knowing his time well, waited
only a few minutes before she heard the familiar bang of his door,
and then his quick walk towards her. She met him at the point where
the last tree of the engirding avenue flanked the last house in the
street.',

Visitors soon began to flock in from county houses, villages,
remote copses, and lonely uplands, the latter in oiled boots and
tilt bonnets, to see the reception, or if not to see it, at any
rate to be near it. There was hardly a workman in the town who did
not put a clean shirt on. Solomon Longways, Christopher Coney,
Buzzford, and the rest of that fraternity, showed their sense of

she preferred waiting for him by the firelight, and, if it were not
too cold, keeping one of the window-sashes a little way open that
the sound of his wheels might reach her ears early. She was leaning
back in the chair, in a more hopeful mood than she had enjoyed
since her marriage. The day had been such a success, and the
temporary uneasiness which Henchard\'s show of effrontery had
wrought in her disappeared with the quiet disappearance of Henchard
himself under her husband\'s reproof. The floating evidences of her
absurd passion for him, and its consequences, had been destroyed,

within a few yards of Farfrae\'s he saw the door gently opened, and
a servant raise her hand to the knocker, to untie the piece of
cloth which had muffled it. He went across, the sparrows in his way

in human aggression at so early a time.',

leaden gloom of one who has lost all that can make life
interesting, or even tolerable. There would remain nobody for him
