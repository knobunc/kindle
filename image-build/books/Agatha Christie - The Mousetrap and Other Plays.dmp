Members of the Jury, I appear in this case with my learned friend Mr. Barton for the prosecution, and my learned friends Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr. Brogan-Moore appear for the defence. This is a case of murder. The facts are simple and up to a certain point are not in dispute. You will hear how the prisoner, a young and, you may think, a not unattractive man, made the acquaintance of Miss Emily French, a woman of fifty-six. How he was treated by her with kindness and even with affection. The nature of that affection you will have to decide for yourselves. Dr. Wyatt will tell you that in his opinion death occurred at some time between <<nine-thirty|5k:1>> and <<ten|3d>> on the night of the fourteenth of October last. You will hear the evidence of Janet MacKenzie, who was Miss French\x{2019}s faithful and devoted housekeeper. The fourteenth of October\x{2014}it was a Friday\x{2014}was Janet MacKenzie\x{2019}s night out, but on this occasion she happened to return for a few minutes at <<nine twenty-five|5b>>. She let herself in with a key and upon going upstairs to her room she passed the door of the sitting-room. She will tell you that in the sitting-room she heard the voices of Miss French and of the prisoner, Leonard Vole.",
