With the girl I was having at the moment. She was a Beta-Minus, and I think\x{201d} (he shut his eyes), \x{201c}I think she had yellow hair. Anyhow she was pneumatic, particularly pneumatic; I remember that. Well, we went there, and we looked at the savages, and we rode about on horses and all that. And then\x{2014}it was almost the last day of my leave\x{2014}then \x{2026} well, she got lost. We\x{2019}d gone riding up one of those revolting mountains, and it was horribly hot and oppressive, and after lunch we went to sleep. Or at least I did. She must have gone for a walk, alone. At any rate, when I woke up, she wasn\x{2019}t there. And the most frightful thunderstorm I\x{2019}ve ever seen was just bursting on us. And it poured and roared and flashed; and the horses broke loose and ran away; and I fell down, trying to catch them, and hurt my knee, so that I could hardly walk. Still, I searched and I shouted and I searched. But there was no sign of her. Then I thought she must have gone back to the rest-house by herself. So I crawled down into the valley by the way we had come. My knee was agonizingly painful, and I\x{2019}d lost my soma. It took me hours. I didn\x{2019}t get back to the rest-house till <<after midnight|13>>. And she wasn\x{2019}t there; she wasn\x{2019}t there,\x{201d} the Director repeated. There was a silence. \x{201c}Well,\x{201d} he resumed at last, \x{201c}the next day there was a search. But we couldn\x{2019}t find her. She must have fallen into a gully somewhere; or been eaten by a mountain lion. Ford knows. Anyhow it was horrible. It upset me very much at the time. More than it ought to have done, I dare say. Because, after all, it\x{2019}s the sort of accident that might have happened to any one; and, of course, the social body persists although the component cells may change.\x{201d} But this sleep-taught consolation did not seem to be very effective. Shaking his head, \x{201c}I actually dream about it sometimes,\x{201d} the Director went on in a low voice. \x{201c}Dream of being woken up by that peal of thunder and finding her gone; dream of searching and searching for her under the trees.\x{201d} He lapsed into the silence of reminiscence.",
