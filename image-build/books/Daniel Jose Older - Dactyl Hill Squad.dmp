            "So Magdalys mostly had to be content with watching the great beasts cavort along outside her window: The lamplighter\x{2019}s iguanodons would pass first thing in the morning, extinguishing the lanterns as the day broke. Then the commuter brachys would stomp past, passengers cluttered on the saddles and hanging from straps along the side. By <<noon|13>> the streets would fill with stegosaurs lugging supplies and the duckbill riders in fancy dress clothes, heading off to important meetings, while microraptors scurried across the roads, carrying messages or making nuisances of themselves. Most of the trikes and raptors had been sent down south to fight the Confederates, but every once in a while she\x{2019}d see one of those too. Magdalys could watch them out her window all day, but it wasn\x{2019}t the same as being out there with the dinos.",
