            'It was <<one|3b>> Saturday late in December that Caddie came near drowning for the second time that year. Father had brought them to Eau Galle for the first skating of the season, and, while he was busy in the mill, Caddie and the two boys strapped on their skates and tried the ice. Tom was an expert skater, cutting figure-eights and scrolls and spirals in fine profusion over the new ice. Caddie and Warren were ambitious to do as well as Tom, but they could only follow along in awkward imitation of his skill. What they lacked in skill, they tried to make up in daring.',

            "At morning recess someone slipped in and hung a slate on the front of Teacher\x{2019}s desk. On it were drawn long two-legged, skinny creatures with heads like buttons, labeled Teecher and Obediah. They were fighting, and around them was drawn a heart. Teacher, not having occasion to go in front of her desk and see it, attributed the unusual amount of giggling to the influence of the day. But Obediah had to sit gazing at the slate with growing fury until <<noon|13>>. At <<noon|13>>, as soon as Miss Parker had gone into the hallway for her lunch basket, Obediah seized the slate in his big hands and broke it into four pieces which he flung into the stove. He glared around the room without saying a word and then stalked outdoors. Obediah was tamed, but the children saw with awe that he was still a lion at heart.",

            "The summer grew hotter and drier. The Indians did not come back, and Father said it was because they could read the weather signs and knew that hunting and fishing would be better in the north. On hot evenings Tom and Caddie used to go down to the lake and take the canoe out to set lines for fish. Using empty, corked jugs as floats, they anchored them in several places on the lake with baited lines attached to them. In the morning early, before school, they would go down and pull in the lines, and usually there would be a nice pike or two for Mrs. Conroy to bake or make into chowder. John\x{2019}s dog went with them to the lake, his tongue hanging out and his eyes alert for any small fish which they might throw him. Just now John\x{2019}s dog was in disfavor at the farmhouse. He had bitten the head off one of Clara\x{2019}s pet kittens, and Caddie was the only one who continued to love and defend him. Like Mary\x{2019}s lamb, he used to follow her to school, and sit mournfully outside the little building, waiting until she came out at recess and at <<noon|13>>.",

            "\x{201c}I guess if I can mend clocks, I ought to be able to quilt,\x{201d} said Caddie a little defiantly, and nobody contradicted her, because she was quilting very well. By <<noon|13>> she was quite as good as Clara or Annabelle and so pleased with herself that she thought quilting one of the greatest sports in the world. When Tom and Warren came up from the barn, she hailed them enthusiastically and began to exhibit her skill.",

            "\x{201c}But you young ones have all of your lives before you, and you already have some ideas of what you wish to make of them. It would be a pity for someone else to make a wrong decision for you. So I think it best that we should take a family vote. Since we are still on American soil and have always considered ourselves good Americans, we shall vote in the American way by written ballot. That is, each child shall decide for himself what he wishes to do. Then, without telling anyone else what he has decided, he shall write \x{2018}Go\x{2019} or \x{2018}Stay\x{2019} on a piece of paper which he shall then fold and place between the leaves of the family Bible in the parlor. We shall vote this afternoon at <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and, in the meantime, I want you to discuss it among yourselves and to ask Mother and me as many questions as you like, and, above all, I want you to think each for yourself: \x{2018}What will be best for my future? Where shall I be most useful and happy?\x{2019} \x{201d}",
