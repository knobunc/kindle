In fact, this 120-degree property turns out to be a general rule for the way soap bubbles fuse together. It was first discovered by Belgian scientist Joseph Plateau, who was born in 1801. While he was doing research into the effect of light on the eye, he stared at the sun for half a minute, and by the age of 40, he was blind. Then, with the help of relatives and colleagues, he switched to investigating the shape of bubbles.',

Any bubble that didn\x{2019}t satisfy Plateau\x{2019}s rules was believed to be unstable and would therefore collapse to a stable configuration that did satisfy these rules. It was not until 1976 that Jean Taylor finally proved that the shape of bubbles in foam had to satisfy the rules laid down by Plateau. Her work tells us how the bubbles connect together, but what about the actual shapes of the bubbles in foam? Because bubbles are lazy, the way to the answer is to find the shapes that enclose a given amount of air in each bubble in the foam while minimizing the surface area of soap film.",

            'The perfect shuffle comes into its own in the hands of a magician who can exploit an interesting property that it has. If you take a pack of 52 cards and do the perfect shuffle eight times, then amazingly, the cards all return to their original positions in the pack. To the onlooker, the shuffling seems to have totally randomized the pack. After all, eight shuffles done by a normal gambler is more than most do at the beginning of a game. In fact, mathematicians have proved that it takes only seven shuffles by a normal cardplayer for the pack to lose all of its original structure and become random. But the perfect shuffle is no ordinary shuffle. Think of the pack of cards as being something like an eight-sided coin, and the perfect shuffle as being the rotation of the coin by an eighth of a turn. <<After eight|9:0>> rotations, the coin comes back to its starting position.',

The way to work out the location of each card is to think of a clock with 2N \x{2013} 1 hours on it, so a 52-card pack is like a clock with hours from 1 to 51.

To work out how many times I have to do the perfect shuffle to get all the cards back to their original position, I have to work out how many times I have to double numbers on this clock for them to return to the original position.

This question turns out to be related to the Riemann hypothesis, the million-dollar question <<about prime|16>> numbers that concluded chapter 1.

Objects fell too quickly for accurate timing from something like the top of the Leaning Tower, so Galileo decided to roll balls down a slope to see how the speed varied. He discovered that if a ball rolled one unit of distance after one second, then after two seconds it would have covered four units of distance, and after three seconds it would have traveled nine units. He could then predict that after four seconds the ball should have traveled a total of 16 units of distance\x{2014}in other words, the distance a body falls is proportional to the square of the time for which it has been falling. In mathematical symbols, d = \x{bd}gt  where d is the distance fallen and t is the time. The factor g, known as the acceleration due to gravity, told Galileo how the vertical speed of a falling object changed with each passing second. For a soccer ball dropped from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, after one second its speed is g, <<after two|9:0>> seconds it is 2g, and so on.
