            'Music impacts all three levels of processing. The initial pleasure of the rhythm, tunes, and sounds is visceral, the enjoyment of playing and mastering the parts behavioral, and the pleasure of analyzing the intertwined, repeated, inverted, transformed melodic lines reflective. To the listener, the behavioral side is vicarious. The reflective appeal can come several ways. At <<one|9m:0>> extreme, there is the deep appreciation of the structure of the piece, perhaps of the reference it makes to other pieces of music. This is the level of music appreciation exercised by the critic, the connoisseur, or the scholar. At the other extreme the musical structure and lyrics might be designed to delight, surprise, or shock.',

His stories were written in the 1940s and \x{2019}50s, but in his novel I, Robot, he quotes the three laws of robotics from the 2058 edition of the Handbook of Robotics; thus, he looked ahead more than 100 years. By <<2058|9n:0>>, we may indeed need his laws. Moreover, as the analyses indicate, the laws are indeed relevant, and many systems today follow them, even if inadvertently. The difficult aspects have to do with damage due to lack of action, as well as with properly assessing the relative importance of following orders versus damage or harm to oneself, others, or humanity.",
