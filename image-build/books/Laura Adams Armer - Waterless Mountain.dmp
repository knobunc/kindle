            "While the sheep lazily grazed in the <<noontime|13>>, Younger Brother rested in the shade of the rocks. He could hear the wind singing in the canyon. The Wind People were always kindly in the summer time. They played with tumbleweeds, rolling them over and over and making them hide in the little hollows at the base of the cliffs. They danced in spirals in the sunshine and sometimes they lifted the red band off of Younger Brother\x{2019}s head and waved it to the tumbleweeds.",

He thought the whole earth might be a red stone for the sun to look through just before it set in the west. Probably it was. He couldn\x{2019}t see any reason why it shouldn\x{2019}t be. The sky at <<noon|13>> was a big turquoise bowl. He knew that, and at night it was the darkness stone of jet, set all over with shining stars.",

The curator ordered sycamore limbs to be brought, and Mother soon had the two posts firmly set in the ground. To these she tied a cross piece at top and bottom, and proceeded to make the frame for the woolen strings she wound up and down for the warp. As her rug was to be a small one she had the strings all stretched by <<noontime|13>>. She had brought her wool yarn with her from the desert.",
