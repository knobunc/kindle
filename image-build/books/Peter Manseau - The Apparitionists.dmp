            "Daguerre discovered this himself during his earliest photographic efforts to document human activity. At <<eight o\x{2019}clock|6>> one bright morning in 1838, he pointed his camera to the busy Boulevard du Temple in Paris. From his studio window he saw the crowded street, full as always with people and wagons going about the business of a new day. Yet despite what the artist\x{2019}s eye could behold, when he examined the image he had made after an exposure of about twelve minutes, he noticed that only two figures were apparent: the dark outline of a bootblack stooped before a customer standing tall over him on a walkway that appeared otherwise empty. As Parisians rushed around them, these two were as still as the buildings and trees, and so they alone remained fixed for the future to see.",
