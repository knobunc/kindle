So I came back into the study and checked my email - \x{2018}No New Messages\x{2019}; and then I decided to write an account of my conversation, or rather non-conversation, with the woman at the ARC private view, which in retrospect seemed rather amusing, though stressful at the time. First I did it in the usual journal style, then I rewrote it in the third person, present tense, the kind of exercise I used to give students in my stylistics seminar. First person into third person, past tense into present tense, or vice versa.What difference does it make to the effect? Is one method more appropriate to the original experience than another, or does any method interpret rather than represent experience? Discuss.",

So I had to carry out my promise to \x{2018}look into\x{2019} the matter, and an exchange of emails followed. First I asked Bethany Brooks if she gave private lessons, and she said she didn\x{2019}t, because she runs classes all over the region and doesn\x{2019}t have time to give individual lessons, but that anyway really it was better to learn lip-reading in a group.

I suggested, hopefully, that as a beginner perhaps I should wait until the start of a new course, rather than attempt to join an ongoing one, but she told me that there was no need, because there was no real beginning or end to the course, and most of the participants had been coming for years. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s not like learning a new language,\x{2019} she wrote. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s more a matter of developing habits of observation.

I take off my jacket, roll up my right shirtsleeve, then with the fingers of two hands adjust the angle of her hips and lightly caress the curve of her buttocks, like a dog fancier steadying his trembling thorough-bred for display. I draw back my arm and then swing it forward, bringing my open palm smack into contact with her bottom. The sound and the sensation of my flesh against her flesh explodes in my head. I hear her gasp. I let my hand rest for a second where it landed before withdrawing it and smacking her again, and again, and again, pausing deliberately between each smack, favouring one cheek, then the other, in alternation, each time letting my stinging hand rest a little longer where it landed . . .",

I imagined her preparing the flat, closing the blinds in the living room, setting up the red table lamp in the corner, then stripping her lower limbs and bending over the table with her face resting on a cushion, waiting for my ring on the entryphone - no, I revised the scenario, she wouldn\x{2019}t bend over the table until she had heard my ring and admitted me to the building, but she would be naked from the waist down, ready to take up her position at the table at once. So now she might be pacing anxiously like me, but half-naked, or sitting on the sofa with her bare knees together, like  the adolescent nude in the Munch picture, waiting, wondering if I would come.

There was already a small heap of wrapped presents under the tree. The little crib with carved olive-wood Nativity figures bought in Bethlehem and presented by Fred\x{2019}s parents years ago was in place on the bookshelves. Carol music filtered from the discreetly placed speakers. It was a pleasant scene, almost as if staged to make an impression. I have to admit that Fred does Christmas very well. But almost at once there was a little friction between us: she asked me if I would help her drape the coloured lights around the tree, and I said I was too tired and couldn\x{2019}t it wait till tomorrow, so with an impatient sigh she did it herself while I got myself and Dad a drink, and the lights didn\x{2019}t come on, and Fred got irritable, and in the end I had to lay the flex out on the floor and check that all the fragile little bulbs were screwed tightly into their sockets before I found the culprit which was breaking the circuit. I hope this is not a foretaste of contretemps to come. The trouble is that as soon as there is the slightest disagreement between Fred and me, our respective parents instinctively line up behind their offspring, and so the friction factor is squared. Dad urged me to  finish my drink before attending to the lights and Fred\x{2019}s mother mentioned that her late husband always used to regard the Christmas tree lights as his special responsibility.

A lot of people have already retired, exhausted by hours of compulsory festivity and each other\x{2019}s company: Fred (who has certainly earned a long rest) led the retreat at <<ten|9c:1>>, accompanied by her mother, followed by Giles and Nicola (who said they were  woken up by their teething baby last night), and Anne, who needed no excuse, for she looks heavily pregnant - hard to believe that the birth is still two months away. Marcia and Peter went home with their offspring hours ago. At <<ten-thirty|5b>> Ben, Maxine and Jim settled down to watch a classic Hollywood film noir on the television. Dad, who slept - and snored - in the drawing room for some time after lunch, with a newspaper over his head, was inconveniently perky this evening. The film was not to his taste, and after a few critical remarks about the depressing effect of the black-and-white photography and the melodramatic style of the acting, designed to persuade the others to switch over to something lighter and brighter, which failed to have the desired effect, he turned his attention to me and began a rambling series of anecdotes about his life as a dance musician. The amount of cigarette smoking going on in the film revived memories of Arthur Lane\x{2019}s addiction, his trick of pinching out fag ends between his foot-operated cymbals and the famous occasion when he set fire to his bass drum while the band was playing \x{2018}Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\x{2019}. \x{2018}And did I ever tell you about Sammy Black\x{2019}s wig?

            "As the morning passed the smell of the roasting turkey filled the kitchen and seeped out into the dining room and front hall and could be faintly sniffed even in my study. \x{2018}Mmm! What a delicious smell,\x{2019} the newly arriving members of the family party exclaimed  as they took off their coats and shed their burdens of wrapped presents, though personally I find it falls only just short of faintly nauseous on the olfactory scale. Still, the morning was all right, on the whole. Dad slept till <<gone nine|9f>>, which meant I was able to read yesterday\x{2019}s paper over my breakfast before I had to make his and sit with him while he ate it in his dressing gown, and there was just time to get him upstairs and out of sight to wash and dress before people started to arrive. Anne and Jim were the first. I was glad to see that she looked well. Jim looked as he always looks, genial but detached, slightly spaced out, though he assured me once that he never smokes grass before lunch. Although he was only a child in the Sixties, he looks and acts like a fossilised relic of that era, wearing his hair shoulder length, dressing always in denim, and sporting one of those long straggly moustaches that were popular on the West Coast during the Summer of Love. Cecilia can hardly bring herself to look at him without flinching. He and Anne have been together for eight years now. I must admit that he wouldn\x{2019}t have been my first choice as a partner for my daughter, and I sometimes feel he is living off her rather than supporting her, but she seems happy with the relationship, so I keep my doubts to myself.",

The grace gave the food a further opportunity to cool, a fact to which Dad tactlessly adverted by asking if his portion could be warmed up a bit in a frying pan and volunteering to carry out this operation himself.  His table manners are an inexhaustible source of amusement, irritation or embarrassment, according to one\x{2019}s point of view. He doesn\x{2019}t feel that a dinner plate is equipped for its function unless it has a generous smear of mustard and a small hill of salt on the rim, irrespective of the ingredients of the meal, and it is no use telling him that mustard doesn\x{2019}t go with turkey or that too much salt is bad for you (though we do, every year). Nor is it any use handing him a salt mill - either he twists it the wrong way, causing it to come apart and scatter crystals of sea salt all over the table, or he labours with increasing impatience to grind out enough minute fragments to make a perceptible heap on the edge of his plate. Fred was so irritated by this procedure on one occasion that she provided him with a half-kilo plastic container of Saxo salt beside his plate at the next meal, but so far from taking the hint, or any offence, he thanked her for the thought. I had remembered to place an old-fashioned cruet with a salt cellar and a pot of prepared mustard within his reach at table today, but forgot that he would also require a slab of white bread, spurning the warm ciabatta rolls provided as being too crusty for his false teeth and contaminated by bits of indigestible olive, and I felt obliged to fetch a slice of white loaf from the kitchen in spite of Fred\x{2019}s injunction that I should stop fussing and sit down.",

            "It was depressing to reflect that I would probably never have a proper conversation with my father again, but it was a consolation that when I had called on him two weeks earlier on my way to Poland he had been calmer and much more lucid than of late, and surprised me with feats of long-term memory, like sunbursts through cloud suddenly illuminating small patches of a dark and obscure landscape. I asked him what his earliest memory was, and  he said it was being carried on his father\x{2019}s shoulder to the tobacconist to buy cigarettes. \x{2018}He asked the man in the shop for twenty Wills\x{2019} Gold Flake and the man took them down off the shelf and gave them to him. Well, my father was called Will, remember, so I thought the cigarettes were made specially for him. That made him laugh. And he had a brother called Alf, who had a real boozer\x{2019}s nose, you know, all broken veins, and I called him \x{201c}the uncle with the writing on his nose\x{201d}. That made them all laugh too.\x{2019} He even dredged up some stories about his early musical career that I hadn\x{2019}t heard before. \x{2018}For a time I used to do two jobs of an evening - the band at the 53 Club off Regent Street, which opened at <<about nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and before that, on my way to the West End, I used to do a session at a dance school at the Elephant and Castle - they called it a dance school, it was really a way of running a dance hall without paying entertainment tax. It was just a three-piece band, piano, drums and me on sax and clarinet, strict tempo stuff, quick quick slow, I could play the tunes in my sleep, in fact I used to read a book while I was blowing, had it propped up on the music stand, nobody on the floor could see . . . but the money was useful. I was saving up to get married. Not that I was in a hurry, but your mother was. One day, she said to me, \x{201c}When are we going to get married? Mum and Dad want to know.\x{201d} So I named a date, and then I had to think about putting a few quid in the bank. But I gave up the dance school when we got married. I wasn\x{2019}t seeing enough of Norma.\x{2019} The thought seemed to make him melancholy. \x{2018}I suppose she never had much of a life, being married to a musician, out at work every evening, and Jewish weddings most Sundays. Especially after you came along. But she never complained.\x{2019} I remembered how sorry for my mother Maisie had been when she was introduced to our nuclear family and realised what a limited, home-bound existence Mum had led for most of her life, living vicariously on the anecdotes her musician husband and scholarly son brought back from the wider world. \x{2018}She made herself a slave to you two men,\x{2019} Maisie used to say, and in retrospect I think she was right, but it was much too late in the day to say as much to Dad, and  I didn\x{2019}t want to strike a discordant note in what was the best conversation I had had with him for a long time.",

            "That last Christmas she was very ill, very weak, and in pain, though she bravely concealed the severity of it from the children. The cancer had metastasised all over her body and she knew there would be no remission. When I arranged for the kids to go on the skiing holiday, she saw a window of opportunity, to leave without fuss a life that promised nothing but more suffering, physical and emotional. She didn\x{2019}t want to die in a hospital, or a hospice, looked after by strangers, however kind. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve had enough, Des,\x{2019} she said. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m not sure how much longer I can stay in control. I\x{2019}m tired. It\x{2019}s time to go, and you\x{2019}ve got to help me.\x{2019} I think our GP guessed her intention and decided tacitly to cooperate. Her principal means of pain relief was a battery-operated syringe driver - a fairly new device in those days - which administered a continuous supply of diamorphine subcutaneously, refilled by the visiting nurse as required. Maisie was able to increase the supply herself according to need, but only up to a safe level. She also used Distalgesic tablets when the pain was very bad. Towards the end of Christmas week our GP wrote a prescription for a larger than usual quantity, \x{2018}to see you through the New Year holiday\x{2019}, and as he handed it over he looked me in the eye and said: \x{2018}Too many of these combined with alcohol can be dangerous.\x{2019} On the last night of the year I crushed twenty Distalgesic tablets and helped Maisie swallow them in a mixture of warm milk and brandy. She turned up the syringe driver to maximum. I kissed her, lit a night-light candle beside the bed, and lay down beside her, holding her hand, until she fell into a deep sleep. Then I sat in an armchair and watched her breathing until I fell asleep myself. When I woke at <<4 a.m.|5>>, the candle was out, and she was dead, her face quite peaceful, her limbs relaxed. I called the doctor at <<six|9c:1>> and he came round. He didn\x{2019}t ask any questions,  and in due course he signed the death certificate. Later that morning I phoned the ski resort in Austria to tell Anne and Richard.",

            "22nd February. Dad made the long journey north after all, not in an ambulance, but in a hearse. Tonight his body reposes just up the road in the mortuary of B.H. Gilbert & Sons, Funeral Directors, whose men fetched it from Tideway Hospital today.The local cemetery for Brickley, where Mum was cremated, is a dreary place, hemmed in by a council estate and a railway line where trains rattle noisily past every few minutes. I remember her funeral as a profoundly depressing occasion. There was a municipal strike on at the time, and a lot of uncollected garbage was blowing about the site in the strong March wind, and there were heaps of flowers all over the place, rotting inside their cellophane wrappings.There weren\x{2019}t many mourners, and I knew there would be even fewer for Dad\x{2019}s funeral if it were held in London. His two cousins, to whom I have written about his death, are both too old and infirm to travel from their seaside homes, and I can\x{2019}t think of anyone in Brickley who would have come except perhaps the Barkers. When I drew up a list it mostly consisted of Fred\x{2019}s family and mine, and the thought of inviting them back after the service to the house in Lime Avenue, even in its cleaned-up state, or hiring some place in Brickley, a district not noted for elegant licensed premises, was dispiriting. So we decided to have the funeral up here, and the reception at home. It\x{2019}s been arranged for next Monday at <<twelve|9o>>. It will be a cremation, and in due course I\x{2019}ll take the ashes back to Brickley Cemetery where Mum was cremated and scatter them in the Garden of Remembrance where Dad scattered Mum\x{2019}s. He left no instructions about his funeral, needless to say, but I think that\x{2019}s what he would have wanted.",

            "I looked at the time on the dateline of the message: <<03.21|9p>>. Nearly seven hours ago. I ran to my car without bothering to set the house burglar alarm, and drove to Wharfside Court as fast as the traffic permitted. I had no idea whether the message was genuine, or some kind of joke - whether I would find Alex unconscious, or dead, curled up on her blood-soaked bed, or lolling naked in a bath full of red-tinted water; or whether she would open the door with a smile, smart and svelte as usual in her black top and pants, saying with a flick of her glossy blonde hair,\x{2018}Hi! Come in. I thought that would bring you running.\x{2019} Was her use of the word \x{2018}suicide\x{2019} - avoided, as she had told me, by most people who committed it - a hint that her  note was a hoax, or on the contrary a guarantee of its authenticity? Was the uncorrected typo, \x{2018}Desdond\x{2019}, evidence that the pills or loss of blood were beginning to take their effect, or a cunning device to give just that impression?",
