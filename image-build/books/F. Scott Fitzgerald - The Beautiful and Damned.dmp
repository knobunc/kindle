            "In 1925 Fitzgerald published his masterpiece, The Great Gatsby. Written while the author was living in the French Riviera, the story of the parvenu Jay Gatsby was more a critical success than a financial one, and Fitzgerald continued to support his extravagant lifestyle through frequent, and well-paid, magazine contributions. But his literary fortunes changed following publication of The Great Gatsby. Although he published a collection of short stories in 1926, he did not produce another book until <<1934|9c:0>>, when Tender Is the Night, on which he had labored for years, was published. Meanwhile, his domestic life deteriorated as he sank deeper into alcoholism and Zelda became increasingly unstable. Zelda\x{2019}s emotional collapse in 1930 was precipitated by maniacally intense ballet studies; the remaining years of her life were spent in and out of hospitals.",

            "Zelda was becoming restless. Tired of being just Fitzgerald\x{2019}s wife, she wanted something of her own. In the past she had tried to write, publishing a few short pieces, and painted, but she needed something more all-consuming. They had moved to Paris, and at <<twenty-nine|9:0>>, Zelda obsessively took up ballet lessons with the dream of joining the Ballets Russes. Drinking regularly and passing out occasionally, Fitzgerald by now had become a full-fledged alcoholic. He and Zelda fought over her ballet mania while he struggled with his fourth novel. The only bright spot was Fitzgerald\x{2019}s growing friendship with a young writer he had helped get started, Ernest Hemingway. When Fitzgerald and Hemingway first met, Fitzgerald was the established and successful writer and Hemingway was the struggling unknown. Yet from the beginning Hemingway assumed the upper hand in the relationship while Fitzgerald played the role of a devoted groupie. He genuinely admired Hemingway\x{2019}s writing\x{2014}recommending Hemingway to Maxwell Perkins at Scribner\x{2019}s \x{2014}but Fitzgerald also seemed to worship Hemingway\x{2019}s machismo and male exploits in much the same way he had once worshiped football heroes. While Fitzgerald loved spending time with Hemingway, Zelda was not a fan. She thought he was a bully and a phony, and Hemingway in return thought that Zelda was crazy and told Fitzgerald she was trying to sabotage his writing.",

Just by luck a matter came to my attention that I think will be just suited to you. I would like to see you start with something that would bring you notice. At the same time if a very beautiful girl of your sort is put directly into a picture next to one of the rather shop-worn stars with which every company is afflicted, tongues would very likely wag. But there is a \x{201c}flapper\x{201d} part in a Percy B. Debris production that I think would be just suited to you and would bring you notice. Willa Sable plays opposite Gaston Mears in a sort of character part and your part I believe would be her younger sister.Anyway Percy B. Debris who is directing the picture says if you\x{2019}ll come to the studios day after to-morrow (Thursday) he will run off a test. If <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> is suited to you I will meet you there at that time.With all good wishes
Ever faithfully 
JOSEPH BLACK.Gloria had decided that Anthony was to know nothing of this until she had obtained a definite position, and accordingly she was dressed and out of the apartment next morning before he awoke. Her mirror had given her, she thought, much the same account as ever. She wondered if there were any lingering traces of her sickness. She was still slightly under weight, and she had fancied, a few days before, that her cheeks were a trifle thinner\x{2014}but she felt that those were merely transitory conditions and that on this particular day she looked as fresh as ever. She had bought and charged a new hat, and as the day was warm she had left the leopard-skin coat at home.",
