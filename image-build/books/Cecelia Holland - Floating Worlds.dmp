This isn\x{2019}t the place to comment on people who aggravate the natural tensions between races and individuals for their personal ends, however grandiose, and I won\x{2019}t do that. The Ybix incident was a practical exercise. General Gordon made a misjudgment, to which he was helped by a variety of people not even on trial here and for which he has suffered. Certainly neither of the two ships destroyed at Luna would have been shot down if not for Ybix\x{2019}s presence, but Ybix had been there for <<nearly 240 hours|1>> without a problem, and therefore I conclude that without General Gordon\x{2019}s miscalculation, the incident would not have occurred. I am holding Ybix responsible for one ship and General Gordon for the other. The eight men who died in the ships cannot be brought to life again by any piety or wit in this courtroom. They were soldiers and carried guns, and men who use force must accept it will be used against them.
