The Great Western was the smoothest, steadiest, fastest railway line in England.

He thought little of it, he said: the Kents\' dog was known to bark at the slightest thing.

The heavily pregnant Mrs Kent was not disturbed by barking that night either, though she said she slept lightly: \'I awoke frequently.\' She heard nothing out of the ordinary, she said, apart from \'a noise as of the drawing-room shutters opening\' in the early morning, soon after dawn had broken - she imagined that the servants had started work downstairs.',

Ordinarily he cleaned the knives as well, but today Holcombe took over the task so that the boy could be ready sooner: \'I want you in the garden,\' he told him, \'to help me about some manure.

The police were instructed to treat everyone with respect - the drivers of hansom cabs, for instance, were not to be referred to as \'cabbies\' - and to avoid the use of force. These standards were to be observed off-duty, too. If found drunk at any time, a constable was issued with a warning, and if the offence was repeated he was dismissed from the force.

His father, a police superintendent, had set up the first police-station library. Dolly shared lodgings in I Palace Place, Great Scotland Yard, with sixteen other single policemen. One of these, Tim Cavanagh, later gave an account of Dolly\'s relationship with a cat that had attached itself to the house. This animal, Tommas, had a habit of \'killing and eating the local cats\', according to Cavanagh, and the officers\' neighbours demanded that he be destroyed. \'Much to our regret, we had to put a stone around the poor old fellow\'s neck and drop him into the river. This was a great shock to "Dolly," who was much attached to "Tommas," and, if I may let a secret out now, actually trained the "warrior" for his <<midnight|13>> work.

Some thought it suspicious that Gough had not mentioned Saville\'s absence to Emily Doel, her assistant, <<just before seven|10>> on the morning of his disappearance; Whicher thought her silence \'seems to tell in her favour\', because it indicated that she really did believe the boy\'s mother had taken him, and that there was no cause for alarm.

            'A few days before the murder she obtained possession of a razor from a green case in her father\'s wardrobe, and secreted it. This was the sole instrument which she used. She also secreted a candle with matches, by placing them in the corner of the closet in the garden, where the murder was committed. On the night of the murder she undressed herself and went to bed, because she expected that her sisters would visit her room. She lay awake watching until she thought that the house-hold were all asleep, and soon <<after midnight|13>> she left her bedroom and went downstairs and opened the drawing-room door and window shutters. She then went up into the nursery, withdrew the blanket from between the sheet and the counterpane, and placed it on the side of the cot. She then took the child from his bed and carried him downstairs through the drawing-room. She had on her nightdress, and in the drawing-room she put on her goloshes. Having the child in one arm, she raised the drawingroom window with the other hand, went round the house and into the closet, lighted the candle and placed it on the seat of the closet, the child being wrapped in the blanket and still sleeping, and while the child was in this position she inflicted the wound in the throat. She says that she thought the blood would never come, and that the child was not killed, so she thrust the razor into its left side, and put the body, with the blanket round it, into the vault. The light burnt out. The piece of flannel which she had with her was torn from an old flannel garment placed in the waste bag, and which she had taken some time before and sewn it to use in washing herself. She went back into her bedroom, examined her dress, and found only two spots of blood on it. These she washed out in the basin, and threw the water, which was but little discoloured, into the footpan in which she had washed her feet over night. She took another of her nightdresses and got into bed. In the morning her nightdress had become dry where it had been washed. She folded it up and put it into the drawer. Her three nightdresses were examined by Mr Foley, and she believes also by Mr Parsons, the medical attendant of the family. She thought the blood stains had been effectually washed out, but on holding the dress up to the light a day or two afterwards she found the stains were still visible. She secreted the dress, moving it from place to place, and she eventually burnt it in her own bedroom, and put the ashes or tinder into the kitchen grate. It was about five or six days after the child\'s death that she burnt the nightdress. On the Saturday morning, having cleaned the razor, she took an opportunity of replacing it unobserved in the case in the wardrobe. She abstracted her nightdress from the clothes basket when the housemaid went to fetch a glass of water. The stained garment found in the boiler-hole had no connexion whatever with the deed. As regards the motive of her crime it seems that, although she entertained at one time a great regard for the present Mrs Kent, yet if any remark was at any time made which in her opinion was disparaging to any member of the first family she treasured it up and determined to revenge it. She had no ill-will against the little boy, except as one of the children of her stepmother . . .She told me that when the nursemaid was accused she had fully made up her mind to confess if the nurse had been convicted, and that she had also made up her mind to commit suicide if she was herself convicted. She said that she had felt herself under the influence of the devil before she committed the murder, but that she did not believe, and had not believed, that the devil had more to do with her crime than he had with any wicked action. She had not said her prayers for a year before the murder, and not afterwards till she came to reside at Brighton. She said that the circumstance which revived religious feelings in her mind was thinking about receiving sacrament when confirmed.Bucknill finished his letter by observing that, though Constance was not in his opinion insane, even as a child she had \'a peculiar disposition\' and \'great determination of character\', which indicated that \'for good or evil, her future life would be remarkable\'. If placed in solitary confinement, he warned, she could succumb to insanity.',

The 18 64 edition included some of the London detectives\' own lingo: to \'pipe\' a man was to follow him; to \'smoke\' was to detect, or to \'penetrate an artifice\'.52
The first English detective story . . .1849. In Chambers\'s Edinburgh Journal of 28 July 1849. This magazine published eleven more stories by Waters between then and September 1853. The twelve were issued as a book in 1856.52

\'The credit for skill . . . Dickens and the like. Also that year, Charley Field was criticised for the underhand manner in which he caught two men who had tried to blow up the railway tracks at Cheddington, Buckinghamshire. He disguised himself as a match-seller, according to the Bedford Times, took rooms in the town and made himself at home in the local pubs, where he would joshingly introduce himself as a \'timber merchant\', until he got the information he sought. See Dickens and Crime (1962) by Philip Collins.53
Like Whicher . . . little finger\'. Literary detectives were inconspicuous and quiet. Carter of the Yard in Mary Elizabeth Braddon\'s novel Henry Dunbar (1864) looks like something between \'a shabby-genteel half-pay captain and an unlucky stockbroker\'. The police detective in Thomas Hardy\'s Desperate Remedies (1871) is \'commonplace in all except his eyes\'. The narrator of John Bennett\'s Tom Fox (1860) says, \'I always made use of my eyes and ears, and said little - a precept every Detective should lay to heart.\' The detective in Braddon\'s The Trail of the Serpent (1860) is mute.54
In 1850 Charley Field . . . a lovely idea!\' From \'Three "Detective" Anecdotes\' in House-hold Words, 14 September 1850.55 The artistry of crime . . . the analytical detective. The \'Newgate novels\' of the 1820s to 1840s were melodramas about fearless criminals such as Dick Turpin and Jack Sheppard. For the ascendancy of the detective hero, see, for example, Bloody Murder: From the Detective Story to the Crime Novel - a History (1972) by Julian Symons; Bloodhounds of Heaven: The Detective in English Fiction from Godwin to Doyle (1976) by Ian Ousby; Detective Fiction and the Rise of Forensic Science (1999) by Ronald Thomas; and The Pursuit of Crime: Art and Ideology in Detective Fiction (1981) by Dennis Porter. The shift of focus was described by Michel Foucault in Discipline and Punish (1975): \'we have moved from the exposition of the facts or the confession to the slow process of discovery; from the execution to the investigation; from the physical confrontation to the intellectual struggle between criminal and investigator\'.55

In 1859 . . . sued Bonwell for misconduct. The Bonwell case inspired an extraordinary editorial in the Daily Telegraph of 10 October 1859: \'This London is an amalgam of worlds within worlds and the occurrences of every day convince us that there is not one of these worlds but has its special mysteries and its generic crimes . . . It has been said . . . that Hampstead sewers shelter a monstrous breed of black swine, which have propagated and run wild among the slimy feculence, and whose ferocious snouts will one day up-root Highgate archway, while they make Holloway intolerable with their grunting.\' Quoted in Black Swine in the Sewers of Hampstead: Beneath the Surface of Victorian Sensationalism by Thomas Boyle (1988).

Privacy had become . . . or a tea.

Wohl. In an essay in this anthology, Elaine Showalter writes that secrecy was \'the fundamental and enabling condition of middle-class life . . . The essential unknowability of each individual, and society\'s collaboration in the maintenance of a facade behind which lurked innumerable mysteries, were the themes which preoccupied many mid-century novelists.\'In 1935 the German philosopher Walter Benjamin connected this new privacy to the birth of detective fiction: \'For the private citizen the space in which he lives enters for the first time into contrast with the one of daily work . . . the traces of the inhabitant impress themselves upon the interieur and from them is born the detective story, which goes after these traces.\' Quoted (and translated) by Stefano Tani in The Doomed Detective: The Contribution of the Detective Novel to Postmodern American and Italian Fiction (1984).110
A murder like this could reveal. . . middle-class house. In an article about the popularity of detective stories, Bertolt Brecht wrote: \'We gain our knowledge of life in a catastrophic form. History is written after catastrophes . . . The death has taken place. What had been brewing beforehand? What had happened? Why has a situation arisen? All this can now perhaps be deduced.\' Published in 1976 in Brecht\'s collected works and quoted in Delightful Murder: A Social History of the Crime Story (1984) by Ernest Mandel.110

            'It is a summer\'s night in 1860. In an elegant detached Georgian house in the village of Road, Wiltshire, all is quiet. Behind shuttered windows the Kent family lies sound asleep. At some point <<after midnight|13>> a dog barks.The family wakes the next morning to a horrific discovery: an unimaginably gruesome murder has taken place in their home. The household reverberates with shock, not least because the guilty party is surely still among them. Jack Whicher of Scotland Yard, the most celebrated detective of his day, reaches Road Hill House a fortnight later. He faces an unenviable task: to solve a case in which the grieving family are the suspects. The murder provokes national hysteria. The thought of what might be festering behind the closed doors of respectable middle-class homes - scheming servants, rebellious children, insanity, jealousy, loneliness and loathing - arouses fear and a kind of excitement. But when Whicher reaches his shocking conclusion there is uproar and bewilderment.A true story that inspired a generation of writers such as Wilkie Collins, Charles Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle, this has all the hallmarks of the classic murder mystery - a body; a detective; a country house steeped in secrets. In "The Suspicions of Mr Whicher "Kate Summerscale untangles the facts behind this notorious case, bringing it back to vivid, extraordinary life.',
