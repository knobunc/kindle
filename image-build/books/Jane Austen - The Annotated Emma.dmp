Its popularity increased further <<after 1800|18:0>>, for its exoticism and fantastical elements appealed to the Romanticism of the period. The story of Aladdin and his magical lamp was one of the most read of the tales.

They had existed in antiquity and been revived during the Renaissance. They were worn as jewelry or simply collected. Queen Elizabeth was well-known for giving cameo brooches or pendants as gifts to those she wished to reward. The eighteenth century witnessed a renewed interest in cameos, which increased even further in the years <<just after 1800|18:0>>, when an interest in classical decoration caused people to favor an art that had strong associations with antiquity. The leading carvers were in Europe, and cameos were an easy and relatively cheap item for travelers to bring back as souvenirs of their having visited distinguished sites. It is possible some of the Knightley family\x{2019}s collection results from travels, though people could also buy them in England.",

The latter were traditionally used in England, but <<around 1700|18:0>> the sash window emerged and soon replaced casements as the dominant type. The existence of casement windows in this building suggests it was constructed in an earlier time, but the owners, people in business who presumably occupy the ground floor, since Mrs. and Miss Bates are not there, probably installed sash windows at a certain point for their own use. They would not care as much about the apartment above that they rent out to others, and Mrs. and Miss Bates lack the money to install new windows themselves or pay additional rent to encourage the landlord to do so. Hence the contrast in the windows suggests their financial state.',

Also known as indispensables, and a little later as reticules, ridicules had emerged as popular items <<around 1800|18:0>>, when the change to thin, close-fitting dresses for women eliminated the capacious pockets that earlier, expansive skirts had allowed, and thereby made necessary another receptacle for carrying personal items. Ridicules tended to come in bright colors and contain elaborate and inventive decorations, which were often prized as a contrast with the mostly plain, pale-colored gowns of the period; hence they are an appropriate accessory for Mrs. Elton.
