They speak more slowly than any other Color save Obsidian, favoring digital communication. They are older than I, graduates of the <<Midnight|13>> School, all. Beyond them, near the back of the bridge, Gray marines and several Obsidians stand sentinel. I clap Roque on the shoulder. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s time.\x{201d}",

Orion, the first to speak, still stands, shoulders square, long neck unbent. Her dialect is lowborn, sharper, and more worldly than the dreamy lingo of these academics. Likely from the dock city of Phobos or the String Docks near the Academy\x{2019}s Can.
