Trade routes were well established, and whether they were transported via India, Arabia, Persia, or Egypt, spices would pass through as many as twelve hands before reaching consumers in western Europe.

Bacon was also a physician and an experimentalist, knowledgeable in the sciences that we would now call astronomy, chemistry, and physics. He was also fluent in Arabic, and it is likely that he learned about gunpowder from a nomadic tribe, the Saracens, who acted as middlemen between the Orient and the West. Bacon must have been aware of the destructive potential of gunpowder, as his description of its composition was in the form of an anagram that had to be deciphered to reveal the ratio: seven parts saltpeter, five parts charcoal, and five parts sulfur. His puzzle remained unsolved for 650 years before finally being decoded by a British army colonel. By then gunpowder had, of course, been in use for centuries.",

As more sophisticated firearms developed (the musket, the flintlock, the wheellock), the need for different rates of burning of gunpowder became apparent. Sidearms needed faster-burning powder, rifles a slower-burning powder, and cannons and rockets an even slower burn. A mixture of alcohol and water was used to produce a powder that caked and could be crushed and screened to give fine, medium, and coarse fractions. The finer the powder, the faster the burn, so it was possible to manufacture gunpowder that was appropriate for the various applications. The water used for manufacture was frequently supplied as urine from workers in the gunpowder mill; the urine of a heavy wine drinker was believed to create particularly potent gunpowder. Urine from a clergyman, or better yet a bishop, was also considered to give a superior product.',

Even if the mold extract was diluted eight hundred times, it was still active against the bacterial cells. Moreover mice, injected with the substance that Fleming was now calling penicillin, showed no toxic effects.

            "It is not difficult to imagine how, in a time steeped in sorcery and superstition, users of flying ointments really did believe they had flown through the night sky and taken part in wild dancing and wilder revelries. The hallucinations from atropine and scopolamine have been described as particularly vivid. A witch would have no reason to believe  the effects of her flying ointment were solely in her mind. It is also not difficult to imagine how the knowledge of this wonderful secret was passed on\x{2014}and it would have been considered a wonderful secret. Life for most women in these times was hard. Work was never ending, disease and poverty ever present, and a woman\x{2019}s control over her own destiny unheard of. A few hours of freedom, riding the skies to a gathering where one\x{2019}s sexual fantasies were played out, then waking up safely in one\x{2019}s own bed must have been a great temptation. But unfortunately the temporary escape from reality created by the molecules of atropine and scopolamine often proved fatal, as women accused of witchcraft who confessed to such imagined <<midnight|13>> exploits were burned at the stake.",

This 122-year delay should not be seen as unproductive. On the contrary, organic chemists often view the actual deciphering of the structure of morphine as equally beneficial to mankind as the well-known pain-relieving effects of this molecule. Classical methods of structure determination, new laboratory procedures, an understanding of the  three-dimensional nature of carbon compounds, and new synthetic techniques were just some of the results of the unraveling of this marathon chemical puzzle. Structures of other important compounds have been deduced because of the work done on the composition of morphine.",

Columbus, upon returning from his fourth voyage to the New World in 1502, presented cacao pods to King Ferdinand of Spain.

            "A similar pattern followed the introduction of coffee to Europe during the seventeenth century. The lure of caffeine eventually won over the initial apprehension of officials of the Church and government as well as physicians. Sold on the streets of Italy, in caf\x{e9}s in Venice and Vienna, in Paris and Amsterdam, in Germany and Scandinavia, coffee has been credited with bringing greater sobriety to the population of Europe. To a certain extent it took the place of wine in southern Europe and beer in the north. No longer did workingmen consume ale for breakfast. By <<1700|9n:0>> there were over two thousand coffeehouses in London; patronized exclusively by men, many came to be associated with a specific religion or trade or profession. Sailors and merchants gathered at Edward Lloyd\x{2019}s coffeehouse to peruse shipping lists, an activity that eventually led to the underwriting of trade voyages and the establishment of the famous insurance company Lloyd\x{2019}s of London. Various banks, newspapers, and magazines as well as the stock exchange are all supposed to have started life in London\x{2019}s coffeehouses.",

Huge areas of land that had already been established as sugar plantations switched to growing coffee trees in the expectation of huge profits to be reaped from the bean. In Brazil the abolition of slavery was delayed through the political power of coffee growers, who needed cheap labor. Not until <<1850|18:0>> was the importation of new slaves into Brazil banned. From 1871 all children born to slaves were considered legally free, ensuring the country\x{2019}s eventual, although gradual, abolition of slavery.

It was not generally known what plant the bark came from until <<1735|9c:0>>, when a French botanist,  Joseph de Jussieu, while exploring the higher elevations of the South American rain forests, discovered that the source of the bitter bark was various species of a broad-leafed tree that grew as high as sixty-five feet. It was a member of the Rubiaceae, the same family as the coffee tree. There was always great demand for the bark, and its harvesting became a major industry. Although it was possible to gather some of the bark without killing the tree, greater profits could be made if the tree was felled and all the bark stripped. By the end of the eighteenth century an estimated 25,000 quina trees were being cut down each year.",

            "Throughout history metals have been pivotal in shaping human events. Apart from its possibly apocryphal role in Napoleon\x{2019}s buttons, tin from the Cornish mines in southern England was highly sought after by the Romans and was one reason for the extension of the Roman Empire into Britain. By <<1650|9n:0>> an estimated sixteen thousand tons of silver from the mines of the New World had enriched the coffers of Spain and Portugal, much of it to be used supporting wars in Europe. The search for gold and silver had an immense impact on exploration, settlement, and the environment of many regions; for example, the gold rushes of the nineteenth century in California, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and the Canadian Klondike did much to open up those countries. As well, our language contains many words or phrases invoking this metal\x{2014}goldbrick, gold standard, good as gold, golden years.  Whole epochs have been named in tribute to the importance of metals.
