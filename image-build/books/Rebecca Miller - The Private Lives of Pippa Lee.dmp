            "This was one of the newer units, they were told. Dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, microwave, electric oven, all new. Carpeting, new. Septic tank. Roof. Yet the floor of the basement had a crack in the concrete, and some of the grouting between the tiles in the bathroom was turning dark with mold. Signs of decay, like in an old mouth with gleaming caps glued over the stumps, Pippa thought. She wondered how many people had died in this house. Marigold Village, retirement community: a prelude to heaven. This place had everything: swimming pool, restaurants, mini-mall, gas station, health food store, yoga classes, tennis courts, nursing staff. There was an on-call grief counselor, two marriage counselors, a sex therapist, and an herbalist. Book club, camera club, garden club, model boatbuilding club. You never had to leave. Pippa and Herb had first encountered Marigold Village when returning to their Long Island beach house from a lunch party in Connecticut twenty years earlier, when Pippa was just past thirty, Herb sixty. Herb had taken a wrong turn, and they found themselves on a narrow, winding road lined with clusters of dun-colored, single-story houses. It was <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>> in April; the late afternoon light cast a golden filter over the perfectly maintained lawns. The houses looked identical; a hive of numbered mailboxes stood at the end of each shared driveway. Some of the numbers were in the thousands. Herb had been confident that a couple of left turns and a right would put them back on the main road, but every turn he made seemed to suck them deeper into the development.",

New members welcome.\x{2019} This caught her interest. It might be a good way to meet people. The following Thursday, she was knocking on the door of the prescribed unit, wearing one of Herb\x{2019}s shirts and a loose linen skirt. She felt she should hide her still solid body from the old women. It seemed only kind. A tiny lady with the tight white curls and pull-on trousers of the nearly aged swung open the door. \x{2018}Another young one!\x{2019} she pronounced rather loudly, half-looking over her shoulder. \x{2018}Come on in.

Pippa noticed something the color of peanut butter spread on one of the slices of chocolate cake. She sniffed it cautiously. It was peanut butter. Yet she distinctly remembered sponging down the table the night before. The place had been immaculate. A chill went up her spine, and she swiveled around, imagining a malevolent pair of psychotic eyes staring at her from the living room \x{2013} some escaped lunatic, brandishing a dirty cake knife. Seeing no one, she went to the kitchen door, tried it. Locked. She walked around the house, checked every door, every window. All locked. No one had come in. It must have been Herb. But they had gone to bed together at <<eleven|9c:1>>. Herb had fallen asleep first. She tried to imagine him getting up to let people in, <<after midnight|13>>, for chocolate cake and peanut butter.

Yet, no, rare as sex with Herb was these days, precautions were still necessary; eggs were meant to be fulminating inside her in this twilight of her fertility.

Every time we approached a turn, she whacked the horn, warning the eighteen-wheeler that was surely barreling round the bend, making ready to spin out of control and flatten us.

But I shot him glances as I worked. He ate with his wife every night. Their conversations seemed strained yet civil. He always pulled her chair out for her. He talked more than she did; mostly she nodded, unsmiling, staring into her plate. Directly after she had finished her meal, she stood up, murmured a goodbye, and walked out. Mr Brown would then get himself a cup of coffee and circulate around the dining hall, chatting with the boys. He seemed to relax when his wife was out of the room.

            "Once spurned by the Jesuits, Chris set about giving away as much of his parents\x{2019} money as possible to the bums in Jersey City, twenties and fives filched from his mother\x{2019}s purse, his father\x{2019}s wallet. He started getting into bar brawls with hypocrites; he even got himself arrested once, for screaming \x{2018}Please stop lying to each other!\x{2019} up and down their quiet suburban street at <<two o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>. He went straight from jail to a tattoo parlor and had the Lord bored into his skin for good. The boy was driving his mother crazy. His father felt completely impotent in the face of his son\x{2019}s problem. \x{2018}If it was drugs,\x{2019} Johnny said, \x{2018}at least we could send him to rehab. But this \x{2026}\x{2019} He flapped his arms and let them slap his sides uselessly.",

            "When she got home, she made spanakopita for Herb, folding neat packets of filo dough around a mixture of feta cheese and spinach. Then she settled into a reclining lawn chair on the patio, sipping a large glass of pomegranate juice. Herb was in his office. It was <<past one|9f>>, he should be home soon. Pippa looked across the pond at Dot\x{2019}s house. The yellow truck was there. Then she saw the front door open. Chris walked out and got into his truck. He was the strangest person she had ever met. So unpleasant, yet so touching. The yellow truck pulled away just as Herb laid his hand on her shoulder. She turned, startled. \x{2018}Did you think I was a geriatric marauder?\x{2019} he asked.",

            "Once in the parking lot, she couldn\x{2019}t face getting into her car. She didn\x{2019}t want to go home. She didn\x{2019}t know what to do with herself. It was <<eleven in the morning|5>>. Chris was asleep. Herb was in his office. She could go and see him. It was strange, Pippa felt, that she hadn\x{2019}t thought of Herb first. That was wrong. She must pay more attention to Herb. She walked over to the building where his office was, pushed open the door, ran up the flight of stairs to his door, knocked. She already had her first sentence formed: \x{2018}I got kicked out of pottery class.\x{2019} There was a little laugh in it, the way she was saying it in her head; already she was making fun of Mrs Mankevitz, her gypsy jewelry, the way the whole class had stared at her as though she had just admitted to a sex crime. Herb would crack up about it. She could hear shuffling inside his office. She knocked again.",

            "He tried to help her with her bag, but she ignored him, rushed it to her car. Once she got into the driver\x{2019}s seat, she realized she had forgotten her car keys. She smacked the steering wheel with a curse, then ran back into the house. The kitchen was empty now. She searched the room wildly for her keys. She had to get out before Herb walked back in. At last she saw them, chucked behind her morning coffee mug. When she drank that coffee, at <<eight that morning|5>>, she\x{2019}d thought she was a happily married woman. As she snatched the keys off the kitchen counter, she glimpsed Herb\x{2019}s shoe on the linoleum. His foot was in it. She walked around the island of white Formica and saw him lying unconscious on the ground, a dark stain on his trousers where he had wet himself.",

\x{2018}Maybe just for half an hour.\x{2019} She went into the house, tiptoed down the hall, and peeked into her bedroom. Grace was asleep, huddled under the duvet. Pippa wrote a note, propped it up on the bedside table beside Grace, took her cell phone out of her handbag, drew her sweatshirt off the back of a kitchen chair, and walked outside. Chris was already in the driver\x{2019}s seat.",
