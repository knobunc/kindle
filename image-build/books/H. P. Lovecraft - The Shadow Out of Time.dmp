            'The story is told through the eyes of Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, an American living in the first decade of the 20th century, who is "possessed" by a Yithian. He fears he is losing his mind when he unaccountably sees strange vistas of other worlds and of the Yithian library city. He also feels himself being led about by these creatures and experiences how they live. When he is returned to his own body, he finds that those around him have judged him insane due to the actions of the Yithian that possessed his body. While he was experiencing a Yithian existence in Earth\'s ancient past, the Yithian occupying his body was experiencing a human <<one in the present day|5>>.',

            "Back in Providence, Lovecraft lived in a \"spacious brown Victorian wooden house\" at 10 Barnes Street until <<1933|9c:0>>. The same address is given as the home of Dr. Willett in Lovecraft's The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. The period beginning after his return to Providence\x{2014}the last decade of his life\x{2014}was Lovecraft's most prolific; in that time he produced short stories, as well as his longest work of fiction The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and At the Mountains of Madness. He frequently revised work for other authors and did a large amount of ghost-writing, including \"The Mound\", \"Winged Death\", \"The Diary of Alonzo Typer\". Client Harry Houdini was laudatory, and attempted to help Lovecraft by introducing him to the head of a newspaper syndicate. Plans for a further project were ended by Houdini's death.",

Any chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the amnesia \x{2014} and then I read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient and ill-regarded cults.
