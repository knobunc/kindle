Help me. You\x{2019}ve got to help me.\x{2019} The woman\x{2019}s voice quavered on the edge of tears. The duty constable who had picked up the phone heard a hiccuping gulp, as if the caller was struggling to speak. \x{2018}That\x{2019}s what we\x{2019}re here for, madam,\x{2019} PC Ron Swindells said stolidly. He\x{2019}d worked in Buxton man and boy for the best part of fifteen years and for the last five, he\x{2019}d found it hard to shake off a sense that he was reliving the first ten. There was, he reckoned, nothing new under the sun. It was a view that would be irrevocably shattered by the events that were about to unfold around him, but for the moment, he was content to trot out the formula that had served him well until now. \x{2018}What seems to be the problem?\x{2019} he asked, his rich bass voice gently impersonal.",

There was no quicker way to get the feel of a place than through bar-room conversation.

            "First had been Pauline Catherine Reade. Dark-haired and hazel-eyed, sixteen years old, a trainee confectioner from Gorton, Manchester. Slim build, about five feet tall, wearing a pink and gold dress and a pale-blue coat. <<Just before eight|10>> on Friday, i2th July, she had walked out of the terraced house where she lived with her parents and her younger brother to go to a twist dance. She was never seen again. There had been no trouble at home or at work. She had no boyfriend to fall out with. She had no money to run away with, even if she\x{2019}d wanted to. The area had been extensively searched and three local reservoirs drained, all without a trace of Pauline. Manchester police had followed up every report of a sighting, but none had led them to the vanished girl. The second missing child appeared to have nothing in common with Pauline Reade apart from the inexplicable, almost magical nature of his disappearance. John Kilbride, 12 years old, 4ft 10 ins tall with a slim build, dark-brown hair, blue eyes and a fresh complexion. He was wearing a grey check sports jacket, long grey flannel trousers, a white shirt and black, chisel-toed shoes. According to one of the Lancashire detectives George knew from cricket, he wasn\x{2019}t a bright lad, but a pleasant and obliging one. John went to the cinema with some friends on Saturday afternoon, the day after Kennedy died in Dallas. Afterwards, he left them, saying he was going down to the marketplace in Ashton-under-Lyne, where he often earned threepence making tea for the stallholders. The last anyone saw of him, he was leaning against a salvage bin <<around half past five|10>>. The resulting hunt had been given a last desperate boost only the day before when a local businessman had offered a 100 reward. But nothing appeared to have come of it. That same colleague had remarked to George only the previous Saturday at a police dance, that John Kilbride and Pauline Reade would have left more traces if they\x{2019}d been abducted by little green men in a flying saucer.",

George looked around the church hall with an air of resignation. In the pale-yellow light, it looked dingy and cramped, the pale-green walls adding to the institutional flavour. But they needed an incident room large enough to accommodate a CID team as well as the uniformed officers, and there were precious few candidates within striking distance ofScardale. Pressed, Peter Grundy had only been able to come up with either the village hall in Longnor or this depressing annexe to the Methodist Chapel that squatted on the main road just past the Scardale turn-off. It had the advantage not only of being closer to Scardale, but of having a telephone line already installed in what claimed, according to the sign on its door, to be the vestry.',

He\x{2019}d check in at the incident room in the Methodist Hall in case anything fresh had cropped up, then he\x{2019}d drop off the hair samples at divisional HQ in Buxton and go home to a hot bath, a home-cooked meal and a few hours\x{2019} sleep; what passed for normal life in an investigation like this. But first, he wanted to have a few words with young Charlie Lomas. He\x{2019}d barely made it as far as the village green when a figure lurched out of the shadows in front of him. Startled, he stopped and stared, struggling to believe what he was seeing. His tiredness tripped a giggle inside him, but he managed to swallow it before it spilled into the misty night air. The shape had resolved itself into something an artist might have fallen into raptures over. The bent old woman who peered up at him was the archetype of the crone as witch, right down to the hooked nose that almost met the chin, complete with wart sprouting hairs and black shawl over her head and shoulders. She had to be the original of the photograph he carried in his pocket. The strange suddenness of the coincidence provoked an involuntary pat of the pocket containing her facsimile. \x{2018}You\x{2019}d be the boss, then,\x{2019} she said in a voice like a gate that creaked in soprano.",

George was beginning to think he would dream the road to Scardale for the rest of his life. The car plunged down the narrow defile in the gathering dusk of a gloomy winter afternoon. If the sun had made an appearance through the day\x{2019}s cloud and mist, he\x{2019}d certainly missed it, he thought, slowing down as the village green grew near. Men were milling around the police caravan, cups of tea sending wisps of steam to join the wraiths of mist creeping down the dale. The day\x{2019}s fruitless searching was over with the dying of the light.",

George had gone home when his eyes could no longer focus on the witness statements. There had been a planning meeting between the uniformed branch and CID to organize the volunteer searches for the morning. A representative from the water board had come along to discuss draining the two moorland reservoirs within four miles ofScardale, one on the bleak Staffordshire uplands, the other in the greener hills between Scardale and Longnor. George had found his eagerness almost ghoulish. After the arrangements for the morning had been finalized, he\x{2019}d suggested a quick drink to Tommy Clough. They\x{2019}d driven down to the tiny Baker\x{2019}s Arms and settled in the gloomiest corner with a pint apiece. \x{2018}I checked with the hostel,\x{2019} Clough said. \x{2018}Crowther went straight back after we cut him loose.

Eventually, as the eastern sky lightened, he dozed off, curled like a foetus in one corner of the bed. The alarm roused him at <<seven|9c:1>> and his eyes snapped open, his mind fully conscious. Was he a father? He uncoiled his legs and half ran across the room, almost tripping as he hurried downstairs to the phone. The tone was the same, even though the accent was different. No news.
