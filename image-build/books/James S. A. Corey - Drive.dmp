The interior of the yacht is cream and orange. The control panel is a simple touchscreen model, old enough that the surface has started going grey at the corners. It\x{2019}s not pretty, but it is functional. Solid. An alert pops up that the water recycler has gone off-line. Solomon\x{2019}s not surprised\x{2014}he\x{2019}s outside the design specs\x{2014}and he starts guessing where exactly the system failed. His guess, given that all the thrust is along the primary axis of the ship, is the reservoir back-flow valve, but he\x{2019}s looking forward to checking it when the run is finished. He tries to move his hand, but the weight of it astounds him. A human hand weighs something like three hundred grams. At <<seven|9m:1>> g, that\x{2019}s still only a little over two thousand. He should still be able to move it. He pushes his arm toward the control panel, muscles trembling. He wonders how much above seven he\x{2019}s going. Since the sensors are pegged, he\x{2019}ll have to figure it out when the run is over. How long the burn lasted and whatever his final velocity winds up being. Simple math. Kids could do it. He\x{2019}s not worried. He reaches for the control panel, really pushing it this time, and something wet and painful happens in his elbow.",

    Three years after he met her, Caitlin showed up at the door to his hole at <<three in the morning|9a>>, crying, frightened, and sober. It wasn\x{2019}t the sort of thing Solomon expected from her, and he\x{2019}d spent a fair amount of time in her company. They\x{2019}d become lovers almost seven months after they\x{2019}d met. He called it that. Becoming lovers wasn\x{2019}t the kind of thing Caitlin said. With her, it was always something crude and a little raunchy. That was who she was. He thought it was a kind of emotional protection that she was never exactly sincere. It was a way to control fear and deny anxieties. And really as long as she still wanted to come share his bed some nights, he was fine with that. And if she hadn\x{2019}t wanted to anymore, he\x{2019}d have been disappointed, but he still would have been fine with it. He liked the way she smirked at the world. The confidence she carried herself with, especially when she was faking it. He liked, all in all, who she was. That made everything easier.",
