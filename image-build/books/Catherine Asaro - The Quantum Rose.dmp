            "Similarly, in quantum scattering, particles in the beam collide with those in the target. If two particles join to form a single bigger particle, they are in a bound state. For example, when an electron and a proton socialize, they make a hydrogen atom, which consists of the electron bound to the proton. A bound system can have only certain energies\x{2014}anything between those is forbidden. In our macroscopic world it would be roughly equivalent to saying your car could go at <<ten|9c:1>>, <<twenty|9k:0>>, or thirty miles an hour, but never at, say, twenty-two. In other words, energy is quantized. We don\x{2019}t notice because the differences in the allowed energies are too tiny to detect in our everyday lives.",

His stag lifted its front two legs and pawed the air, its bi-hooves glinting like glass, though they were a hardier material, hornlike and durable. The man ignored its restless motions, keeping his cowled head turned toward Kamoj.',

At <<one|9t:0>> fire, a bondsgirl poured a steaming drink for a stagman, her smile shy and her gaze averted as he closed his hands around hers on the mug.

As they raced across the plains, the suns rose in the sky, though they never reached the zenith overhead. In the morning Aldan had been in front of Valdor, but by <<midday|13>> he had moved to the side and no longer eclipsed his elder sibling.

As the migration approached Aquinal, people came pouring out to meet them, running through the grass, calling to friends and relatives in their swelling ranks. Rather than one village, Aquinal consisted of many small hamlets gathered together, an archipelago in the ocean of the plains. Their total population rivaled that of Dalvador, the largest Plains village. Word soon reached them; nine thousand Aquinal citizens had heeded Vyrl\x{2019}s call.",
