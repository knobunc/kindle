            "Hardy\x{2019}s narrative procedure is on the cusp of the modern, so it is perhaps not surprising to learn that he lived on the cusp of the twentieth century. Born in 1840 in the county of Dorset, England, Hardy did not die until <<1928|9c:0>>, well after the end of World War I and the high-water mark of literary modernism. His biography is illustrative if unencumbered by fantastic events; having left school at sixteen, he was apprenticed to an architect and trained in the profession, which he practiced until 1873, when he became a full-time novelist. He lived in his native city of Dorchester his entire life, except for annual spells in London. He was married twice, first in 1874 to Emma Gifford and, after her death, for a second time in 1914 to Florence Dugdale, whom he had met and fallen in love with in 1893. Some biographers speculate that Florence was the model for Sue Bridehead in Jude the Obscure.",

The bell symbolically marks Jude\x{2019}s exclusion from these venerable walls: As an outsider he counts the tolls and thinks he has miscounted because of the odd number.",
