It was <<before noon|13>>, and he had still not decided what to do.
He sat in his highest room (a circular place, small, the walls of which were lined with leather and shelves of books; musical and scientific objects, astrolabes and lutes, stood on its draped stone tables; it was here that he worked at his songs), playing softly an instrument that he had got under strange circumstances some time ago, in the East. Its strings were taut and harsh, and stung his finger ends; its tone was high and unpleasant and melancholy, but that was his mood. He played in a mode forgotten by all but himself and certain desert musicians, and his thoughts were not with the music.',

Moving furtively, as if they had been crippled, or as if they had only just learned how to breath air, frogs and small lizards floundered from sump to sump; they swam with equal difficulty, hurt perhaps by the water, and after some apparently aimless, undirected activity, always struggled to leave it at the same place they had entered.

Kiss-O-Suck was not born a dwarf but chose it as his career, having himself confined for many years in the black oak box, the gloottokoma, so as to stunt his growth. Now he was at the peak of his powers. When he motioned peremptorily, the other clowns sprang up into the air around him. His voice echoed to Vera over the arena. \x{201c}Dog pit pooley!\x{201d} he chanted, and the crowd gave it him back: but Vera, still somehow on Endingall Street with Egon Rhys trembling beside her, heard, \x{201c}Born in a desert, knows all deserts!\x{201d} The next day she sent him her name with a great bunch of anemones. I admire your act. They met in secret in Montrouge.",

They don\x{2019}t look as if much life ever goes on in them, thought the watchman, an unimaginative man at the beginning of his night\x{2019}s work, which was to walk from there up to the back of the Atteline Quarter (where he could get a cup of tea if he wanted one) and down again.

They stuck their heads out of the windows and shouted, \x{2018}Fuck off!\x{2019} into the rush of air.

            "\x{201c}We lived there for three months, in some rooms on Salt Lip Road behind the Rue Serpolet. The streets stank. At <<six in the morning|5>> a smell so corrupt came up from the Yser Canal it seemed to blacken the iron lamp-posts; we would gag in our dreams, struggle for a moment to wake up, and then realise that the only escape was to sleep again. It was winter, and everything was filthy. Inside, the houses smelled of vegetable peel, sewage, perished rubber. Everyone in them was ill. If we wanted a bath we had to go to a public washhouse on Mosaic Lane. The air was cold; echoes flew about under the roof; the water was like lead. Sometimes it was hardly like water at all. There were some famous murals there, but they were so badly kept up you could make furrows in the grease. Scrape it off and you\x{2019}d see the most beautiful stuff underneath, chalky reds, pure blues, children\x{2019}s faces!",
