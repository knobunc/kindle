There had been the battle with the Wolves early, not long after dawn, then celebration there on the road for the victory and sorrow for their losses (which had been amazingly small, as things had fallen). Then had come the realization that Susannah was gone, the trek to the cave, their discoveries there. By the time they\x{2019}d gotten back to the East Road battlefield, it had been <<past noon|13>>. Most of the townsfolk had left, bearing their saved children home in triumph.
