            "\"I was raised to farm work\x{2026}till I was twenty-two. At <<twenty-one|9:0>> I came to Illinois, Macon County. Then I got to New Salem,\x{2026}where I remained a year as a sort of clerk in a store. Then came the Black Hawk war; and I was elected captain of a volunteer company, a success that gave me more pleasure than any I have had since. I went to campaign, was elated, ran for the Legislature the same year (1832), and was beaten\x{2014}the only time I ever have been beaten by the people. The next and three succeeding biennial elections, I was elected to the Legislature. I was not a candidate afterward. During the legislative period I had studied law, and removed to Springfield to practice it. In 1846 I was elected to the lower house of Congress. Was not a candidate for re\x{eb}lection. From 1849 to 1854, inclusive, practiced law more assiduously than ever before. Always a Whig in politics, and generally on the Whig electoral tickets, making active canvasses. I was losing interest in politics when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused me again.",
