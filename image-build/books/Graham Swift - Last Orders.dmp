            "I picked up the phone there and then, third ciggy on the go, and dialled a number where I knew they\x{2019}d take a four-figure punt, no questions asked, even from the likes of me. Where they\x{2019}d say, \x{2018}What\x{2019}s the asking?\x{2019} And I\x{2019}d say, \x{2018}A thousand, to win, tax paid.\x{2019} And they\x{2019}d take down my credit-card number and read me back the details without so much as a wobble in the voice, Miracle Worker, thinking, There\x{2019}s one born every minute, there must be harder ways of making dough.

But it\x{2019}s different if you know. And if it don\x{2019}t come in, which it will, then Jack\x{2019}ll get his money back. I\x{2019}ll foot the bill for this bet, recoup it on another. Jack\x{2019}ll get his thousand back, and that\x{2019}s my conscience squared. Price of a camper.",

Bernie says, in his just-between-you-and-me voice, bringing me my pint, \x{2018}What\x{2019}s the news on Jack?\x{2019} I say, \x{2018}I went in last night, I\x{2019}ll go again this evening. It\x{2019}s just a matter of time, Bern.\x{2019} Looking at Slattery\x{2019}s clock. <<Quarter past two|10>>. And Bernie shakes his head, like what\x{2019}s happening to Jack is something that ought not to be possible, like it\x{2019}s a miracle working the opposite way. I say, \x{2018}You having one too, Bern? Have one on me. Fetch me a sandwich while you\x{2019}re at it. Ham, no mustard.\x{2019} And up on its shelf, high up at the end of the bar, Bernie\x{2019}s telly\x{2019}s all set up and switched on, the screen angled and the sound pitched just right, so that any Joe sitting at the bar can keep his eye and ear on what\x{2019}s showing, without having to move an inch to order a drink.

I don\x{2019}t move a muscle when they click up the result and the SPs to confirm. Shortened a shade, but I don\x{2019}t need no SPs.

Bernie says, \x{2018}Someone\x{2019}s lucky day.\x{2019} And I say, \x{2018}Yep,\x{2019} picking up my whisky glass, draining it, looking through the bleary bottom of it. Then I look at my watch and at Slattery\x{2019}s clock and put my empty glass on the bar and dismount my stool. \x{2018}Well, must be getting along, Bern. See yer.\x{2019} Bernie says, \x{2018}See yer,\x{2019} taking the glass. It\x{2019}s hard to imagine Bernie not being there, like Slattery\x{2019}s clock, behind the bar.",
