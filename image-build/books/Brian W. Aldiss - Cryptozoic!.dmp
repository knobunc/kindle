That would be <<about 2056|18:0>>, when his father opened his new dentist\x{2019}s surgery. People had gone Victoriana-mad during that period \x{2013} his father had even installed a plastic mahogany rinse-bowl for people to spit into. It was the Victorians who had first revealed the world of prehistory, with its monsters so like the moving things in the depths of the mind, and presumably one thing had led to another. Presumably Wenlock had been influenced by the same currents of the period. But Wenlock had turned out to be the first mind of his age, not a beaten-up failed artist.",
