            "\x{201c}So\x{2026}\x{201d} I tried to think of something to say. Act natural, Thalia had told us. When you're a half-blood on a dangerous mission, what the heck is natural? \x{201c}Um, design any good buildings lately?\x{201d} Annabeth's eyes lit up, the way they always did when she talked about architecture. \x{201c}Oh my gods, Percy. At my new school, I get to take 3-D design as an elective, and there's this cool computer program\x{2026}\x{201d} She went on to explain how she'd designed this huge monument that she wanted to build at Ground Zero in Manhattan. She talked about structural supports and facades and stuff, and I tried to listen. I knew she wanted to be a super architect when she grew up\x{2014}she loves math and historical buildings and all that\x{2014}but I hardly understood a word she was saying. The truth was I was kind of disappointed to hear that she liked her new school so much. It was the first time she'd gone to school in New York. I'd been hoping to see her more often. It was a boarding school in Brooklyn, and she and Thalia were both attending, close enough to Camp Half-Blood that Chiron could help if they got in any trouble. Because it was an all-girls school, and I was going to MS-54 in Manhattan, I hardly ever saw them. Yeah, uh, cool,\x{201c} I said. \x{201d}So you're staying there the rest of the year, huh?\x{201c} Her face got dark. \x{201d}Well, maybe, if I don't\x{2014}\x{201c} \x{201d}Hey!\x{201c} Thalia called to us. She was slow dancing with Grover, who was tripping all over himself, kicking Thalia in the shins, and looking like he wanted to die. At least his feet were fake. Unlike me, he had an excuse for being clumsy. \x{201d}Dance, you guys!\x{201c} Thalia ordered. \x{201d}You look stupid just standing there.\x{201c} I looked nervously at Annabeth, then at the groups of girls who were roaming the gym. \x{201d}Well?\x{201c} Annabeth said. \x{201d}Um, who should I ask?\x{201c} She punched me in the gut. \x{201d}Me, Seaweed Brain.\x{201c} \x{201d}Oh. Oh, right.\x{201c} So we went onto the dance floor, and I looked over to see how Thalia and Grover were doing things. I put one hand on Annabeth's hip, and she clasped my other hand like she was about to judo throw me. \x{201d}I'm not going to bite,\x{201c} she told me. \x{201d}Honestly, Percy. Don't you guys have dances at your school?\" I didn't answer. The truth was we did. But I'd never, like, actually danced at <<one|9c:1>>. I was usually one of the guys playing basketball in the corner. We shuffled around for a few minutes. I tried to concentrate on little things, like the crepe- paper streamers and the punch bowl\x{2014}anything but the fact that Annabeth was taller than me, and my hands were sweaty and probably gross, and I kept stepping on her toes.",

            "second. \x{201c}I'll break that up,\x{201d} Thalia said. \x{201c}You circulate around the cabins. Tell everybody about capture the flag tomorrow.\x{201d} \x{201c}All right. You should be team captain.\x{201d} \x{201c}No, no,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}You've been at camp longer. You do it.\x{201d} \x{201c}We can, uh\x{2026} co-captain or something.\x{201d} She looked about as comfortable with that as I felt, but she nodded. As she headed for the court, I said, \x{201c}Hey, Thalia.\x{201d} \x{201c}Yeah?\x{201d} \x{201c}I'm sorry about what happened at Westover. I should've waited for you guys.\x{201d} '\x{201c}S okay, Percy. I probably would've done the same thing.\x{201d} She shifted from foot to foot, like she was trying to decide whether or not to say more. \x{201c}You know, you asked about my mom and I kinda snapped at you. It's just\x{2026} I went back to find her after seven years, and I found out she died in Los Angeles. She, um\x{2026} she was a heavy drinker, and apparently she was out driving late one night about two years ago, and\x{2026}\x{201d} Thalia blinked hard. \x{201c}I'm sorry.\x{201d} \x{201c}Yeah, well. It's\x{2026} it's not like we were ever close. I ran away when I was ten. Best two years of my life were when I was running around with Luke and Annabeth. But still\x{2014}\x{201d} \x{201c}That's why you had trouble with the sun van.\x{201d} She gave me a wary look. \x{201c}What do you mean?\x{201d} \x{201c}The way you stiffened up. You must've been thinking about your mom, not wanting to get behind the wheel.\x{201d} I was sorry I'd said anything. Thalia's expression was dangerously close to Zeus's, the one time I'd seen him get angry\x{2014}like any minute, her eyes would shoot a million volts. \x{201c}Yeah,\x{201d} she muttered. \x{201c}Yeah, that must've been it.\x{201d} She trudged off toward the court, where the Ares camper and the Hunter were trying to kill each other with a sword and a basketball. The cabins were the weirdest collection of buildings you've ever seen. Zeus and Hera's big white-columned buildings, Cabins One and Two, stood in the middle, with five gods' cab- ins on the left and five goddesses' cabins on the right, so they all made a U around the central green and the barbecue hearth. I made the rounds, telling everybody about capture the flag. I woke up some Ares kid from his <<midday|13>> nap and he yelled at me to go away. When I asked him where Clarisse was he said, \x{201c}Went on a quest for Chiron. Top secret!\x{201d}",

            "Let him die, I wanted to scream. Luke had tried to kill us in cold blood too many times. He didn't deserve anything from Annabeth. Then the darkness above Luke began to crumble, like a cavern roof in an earthquake. Huge chunks of black rock began falling. Annabeth rushed in just as a crack appeared, and the whole ceiling dropped. She held it somehow\x{2014}tons of rock. She kept it from collapsing on her and Luke just with her own strength. It was impossible. She shouldn't have been able to do that. Luke rolled free, gasping. \x{201c}Thanks,\x{201d} he managed. \x{201c}Help me hold it,\x{201d} Annabeth groaned. Luke caught his breath. His face was covered in grime and sweat. He rose unsteadily. \x{201c}I knew I could count on you.\x{201d} He began to walk away as the trembling blackness threatened to crush Annabeth. \x{201c}HELP ME!\x{201d} she pleaded, \x{201c}Oh, don't worry,\x{201d} Luke said. \x{201c}Your help is on the way. It's all part of the plan. In the mean- time, try not to die.\x{201d} The ceiling of darkness began to crumble again, pushing Annabeth against the ground. I sat bolt upright in bed, clawing at the sheets. There was no sound in my cabin except the gurgle of the saltwater spring. The clock on my nightstand read <<just after midnight|10>>. Only a dream, but I was sure of two things: Annabeth was in terrible danger. And Luke was responsible. SIX AN OLD DEAD FRIEND COMES TO VISIT The next morning after breakfast, I told Grover about my dream. We sat in the meadow watching the satyrs chase the wood nymphs through the snow. The nymphs had promised to kiss the satyrs if they got caught, but they hardly ever did. Usually the nymph would let the satyr get up a full head of steam, then she'd turn into a snow-covered tree and the poor satyr would slam into it headfirst and get a pile of snow dumped on him. When I told Grover my nightmare, he started twirling his finger in his shaggy leg fur. \x{201c}A cave ceiling collapsed on her?\x{201d} he asked. \x{201c}Yeah. What the heck does that mean?\x{201d} Grover shook his head. \x{201c}I don't know. But after what Zoe dreamed\x{2014}\x{201d} \x{201c}Whoa. What do you mean? Zoe had a dream like that?\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}I\x{2026} I don't know, exactly. <<About three in the morning|9h>> she came to the Big House and de- manded to talk to Chiron. She looked really panicked.\x{201d} \x{201c}Wait, how do you know this?\x{201d} Grover blushed. \x{201c}I was sort of camped outside the Artemis cabin.\x{201d} \x{201c}What for?\x{201d} \x{201c}Just to be, you know, near them.\x{201d} \x{201c}You're a stalker with hooves.\x{201d} \x{201c}I am not! Anyway, I followed her to the Big House and hid in a bush and watched the whole thing. She got real upset when Argus wouldn't let her in. It was kind of a dangerous scene. I tried to imagine that. Argus was the head of security for camp\x{2014}a big blond dude with eyes all over his body. He rarely showed himself unless something serious was going on. I wouldn't want to place bets on a fight between him and Zoe Nightshade. \x{201d}What did she say?\x{201c} I asked. Grover grimaced. \x{201d}Well, she starts talking really old-fashioned when she gets upset, so it was kind of hard to understand. But something about Artemis being in trouble and needing the Hunters. And then she called Argus a boil-brained lout\x{2026} I think that's a bad thing. And then he called her\x{2014}\x{201c} \x{201d}Whoa, wait. How could Artemis be in trouble?\x{201c} \x{201d}I\x{2026} well, finally Chiron came out in his pajamas and his horse tail in curlers and\x{2014}\x{201c} \x{201d}He wears curlers in his tail?\x{201c} Grover covered his mouth. \x{201d}Sorry,\x{201c} I said. \x{201d}Go on.\x{201c} \x{201d}Well, Zoe said she needed permission to leave camp immediately. Chiron refused. He re- minded Zoe that the Hunters were supposed to stay here until they received orders from Artemis. And she said\x{2026}\x{201c} Grover gulped. \x{201d}She said 'How are we to get orders from Artemis if Artemis is lost?'\x{201c} \x{201d}What do you mean lost? Like she needs directions?\x{201c} \x{201d}No. I think she meant gone. Taken. Kidnapped.\x{201c} \x{201d}Kidnapped?\x{201c} I tried to get my mind around that idea. \x{201d}How would you kidnap an immortal goddess? Is that even possible?\x{201c} \x{201d}Well, yeah. I mean, it happened to Persephone.\x{201c} \x{201d}But she was like, the goddess of flowers.\x{201c} Grover looked offended. \x{201d}Springtime.\x{201c} \x{201d}Whatever. Artemis is a lot more powerful than that. Who could kidnap her? And why?\"",

            "York Yankees cap. I stared at it for a second and then:BANG BANG. Someone, or something, was pounding on my door. I grabbed Riptide and got out of bed. \x{201c}Hello?\x{201d} I called. THUMP. THUMP.I crept to the door. I uncapped the blade, flung open the door, and found myself face-to-face with a black pe- gasus. Whoa, boss! Its voice spoke in my mind as it clopped away from the sword blade. I don't wanna be a horse-ke-bob! Its black wings spread in alarm, and the wind buffeted me back a step, \x{201c}Blackjack,\x{201d} I said, relieved but a little irritated. \x{201c}It's the middle of the night!\x{201d} Blackjack huffed. Ain't either, boss. It's <<five in the morning|5>>. What you still sleeping for? \x{201c}How many times have I told you? Don't call me boss.\x{201d} Whatever you say, boss. You're the man. You're my number one. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and tried not to let the pegasus read my thoughts. That's the problem with being Po- seidon's son: since he created horses out of sea foam, I can understand most equestrian an- imals, but they can understand me, too. Sometimes, like in Blackjacks case, they kind of ad- opt me. See, Blackjack had been a captive on board Luke's ship last summer, until we'd caused a little distraction that allowed him to escape. I'd really had very little to do with it, seriously, but Blackjack credited me with saving him. \x{201c}Blackjack,\x{201d} I said, \x{201c}you're supposed to stay in the stables.\x{201d} Meh, the stables. You see Chiron staying in the stables? \x{201c}Well\x{2026} no.\x{201d} Exactly. Listen, we got another little sea friend needs your help. \x{201c}Again?\x{201d} Yeah. I told the hippocampi I'd come get you. I groaned. Anytime I was anywhere near the beach, the hippocampi would ask me to help them with their problems. And they had a lot of problems. Beached whales, porpoises caught in fishing nets, mermaids with hangnails\x{2014}they'd call me to come underwater and help. \x{201c}All right,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}I'm coming.\x{201d} You're the best, boss. \x{201c}And don't call me boss!\x{201d} Blackjack whinnied softly. It might've been a laugh. I looked back at my comfortable bed. My bronze shield still hung on the wall, dented and unusable. And on my nightstand was Annabeth's magic Yankees cap. On an impulse, I stuck the cap in my pocket. I guess I had a feeling, even then, that I wasn't coming back to my cab- in for a long, long time.",

            "EIGHT I MAKE A DANGEROUS PROMISE Blackjack gave me a ride down the beach, and I have to admit it was cool. Being on a fly- ing horse, skimming over the waves at a hundred miles an hour with the wind in my hair and the sea spray in my face\x{2014}hey, it beats waterskiing any day. Here. Blackjack slowed and turned in a circle. Straight down. \x{201c}Thanks.\x{201d} I tumbled off his back and plunged into the icy sea. I'd gotten more comfortable doing stunts like that the past couple of years. I could pretty much move however I wanted to underwater, just by willing the ocean currents to change around me and propel me along, I could breathe underwater, no problem, and my clothes never got wet unless I wanted them to. I shot down into the darkness. <<Twenty|9k:0>>, thirty, forty feet. The pressure wasn't uncomfortable. I'd never tried to push it\x{2014}to see if there was a limit to how deep I could dive. I knew most regular humans couldn't go past two hundred feet without crumpling like an aluminum can. I should've been blind, too, this deep in the water at night, but I could see the heat from living forms, and the cold of the cur- rents. It's hard to describe. It wasn't like regular seeing, but I could tell where everything was. As I got closer to the bottom, I saw three hippocampi\x{2014}fish-tailed horses\x{2014}swimming in a circle around an overturned boat. The hippocampi were beautiful to watch. Their fish tails shimmered in rainbow colors, glowing phosphorescent. Their manes were white, and they were galloping through the water the way nervous horses do in a thunderstorm. Something was upsetting them. I got closer and saw the problem. A dark shape\x{2014}some kind of animal\x{2014}was wedged halfway under the boat and tangled in a fishing net, one of those big nets they use on trawlers to catch everything at once. I hated those things. It was bad enough they drowned porpoises and dolphins, but they also occasionally caught mythological animals. When the nets got tangled, some lazy fishermen would just cut them loose and let the trapped animals die. Apparently this poor creature had been mucking around on the bottom of Long Island Sound and had somehow gotten itself tangled in the net of this sunken fishing boat. It had tried to get out and managed to get even more hopelessly stuck, shifting the boat in the pro- cess. Now the wreckage of the hull, which was resting against a big rock, was teetering and threatening to collapse on top of the tangled animal. The hippocampi were swimming around frantically, wanting to help but not sure how. One was trying to chew the net, but hippocampi teeth just aren't meant for cutting rope. Hippo-",

            "And then I ran. TEN I BREAK A FEW ROCKET SHIPS I tore across the Mall, not daring to look behind me. I burst into the Air and Space Mu- seum and took off my invisibility cap once I was through the admissions area. The main part of the museum was one huge room with rockets and airplanes hanging from the ceiling. Three levels of balconies curled around, so you could look at the exhibits from all different heights. The place wasn't crowded, just a few families and a couple of tour groups of kids, probably doing one of those holiday school trips. I wanted to yell at them all to leave, but I figured that would only get me arrested. I had to find Thalia and Grover and the Hunters. Any minute, the skeleton dudes were going to invade the museum, and I didn't think they would settle for an audio tour. I ran into Thalia\x{2014}literally. I was barreling up the ramp to the top-floor balcony and slammed into her, knocking her into an Apollo space capsule. Grover yelped in surprise. Before I could regain my balance, Zoe and Bianca had arrows notched, aimed at my chest. Their bows had just appeared out of nowhere. When Zoe realized who I was, she didn't seem anxious to lower her bow. \x{201c}You! How dare you show thy face here?\x{201d} \x{201c}Percy!\x{201d} Grover said. \x{201c}Thank goodness.\x{201d} Zoe glared at him, and he blushed. \x{201c}I mean, um, gosh. You're not supposed to be here!\x{201d} \x{201c}Luke,\x{201d} I said, trying to catch my breath. \x{201c}He's here.\x{201d} The anger in Thalia's eyes immediately melted. She put her hand on her silver bracelet. \x{201c}Where?\x{201d} I told them about the Natural History Museum, Dr. Thorn, Luke, and the General. \x{201c}The General is here?\x{201d} Zoe looked stunned. \x{201c}That is impossible!

Skeleton warriors\x{2014}\x{201d} \x{201c}What?\x{201d} Thalia demanded. \x{201c}How many?\x{201d} \x{201c}<<Twelve|9k:0>>,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}And that's not all. That guy, the General, he said he was sending something, a 'playmate,' to distract you over here. A monster.\x{201d} Thalia and Grover exchanged looks. \x{201c}We were following Artemis's trail,\x{201d} Grover said. \x{201c}I was pretty sure it led here.
