His photograph had not been recognized at Russell\x{2019}s tea shop, but as they did a busy trade there at teatime, and he was not an habitu\x{e9}, that was hardly surprising. His manservant confirmed that he had returned to Cardigan Gardens to dress for his dinner-party at a <<quarter to seven|10>>\x{2014}rather late, since the dinner was at <<seven-thirty|5b>>, and Mr. Crackenthorpe had been somewhat irritable in consequence. Did not remember hearing him come in that evening, but, as it was some time ago, could not remember accurately and, in any case, he frequently did not hear Mr. Crackenthorpe come in. He and his wife liked to retire early whenever they could. The garage in the mews where Harold kept his car was a private lockup that he rented and there was no one to notice who came and went or any reason to remember one evening in particular.",

He could have left there at <<nine-thirty|5b>> and would have had plenty of time to go to Rutherford Hall, move the body from the embankment to the sarcophagus, and get into Brackhampton in time to catch the <<11:55|2>> back to London.
