The command scurried along the interminable front rank: \x{201c}Stop shooting!\x{201d} Here and there a ramrod still clattered, here and there a shot rang out, belated and lonesome. The blue-gray fog between the fronts lifted slightly. All at once, they were in the <<noonday|13>> warmth of the cloudy, silvery, thundery sun. Now, between the lieutenant and the backs of the soldiers, the Kaiser appeared with two staff officers. He held a field glass supplied by one of his escorts and was about to place it on his eyes. Trotta knew what that meant: even assuming that the enemy was retreating, the rear guard must still be facing the Austrians, and anyone raising binoculars was marking himself as a worthy target. And this was the young Kaiser! Trotta\x{2019}s heart was in his throat. Terror at the inconceivable, immeasurable catastrophe that would destroy Trotta, the regiment, the army, the state, the entire world drove burning chills through his body. His knees quaked. And the eternal grudge of the subaltern frontline officer against the high-ranking staff officers, who haven\x{2019}t the foggiest sense of bitter reality, dictated the action that indelibly stamped the lieutenant\x{2019}s name on the history of his regiment. Both his hands reached toward the monarch\x{2019}s shoulders in order to push him down. The lieutenant probably grabbed too hard; the Kaiser promptly fell. His escorts hurled themselves upon the falling man. That same instant, a shot bored through the lieutenant\x{2019}s left shoulder, the very shot meant for the Kaiser\x{2019}s heart. As the emperor rose, the lieutenant sank. Along the entire front, a tangled and irregular rattling awoke from the terrified guns, which had been startled from their slumber. The Kaiser, impatiently urged by his escorts to leave this perilous zone, nevertheless leaned over the prostrate lieutenant and, mindful of his imperial duty, asked the unconscious man, who could hear nothing, what his name was. A regimental surgeon, an ambulance orderly, and two stretcher bearers came galloping over, backs bent, heads stooped. The staff officers first yanked the Kaiser down and then threw themselves on the ground. \x{201c}Here\x{2014}the lieutenant!\x{201d} the Kaiser shouted up at the breathless medic.",

Herr von Trotta sat down at the table in the breakfast room. The egg, soft-boiled as usual, was in its silver cup. The honey shimmered golden, the fresh kaiser rolls smelled of fire and yeast, the butter shone yellow, embedded in a gigantic dark-green leaf, the coffee steamed in the gold-rimmed porcelain. Nothing was missing. Or at least it seemed to Herr von Trotta at first glance that nothing was missing. But then he promptly stood up, put down his napkin, and scrutinized the table again. The letters were missing from their usual place. For as long as the district captain could remember, no day had ever passed without official mail. First Herr von Trotta went to the open window as if to convince himself that the world still existed outside. Yes, the old chestnut trees in the city park still wore their dense green crowns. The invisible birds were making their usual morning racket in the foliage. The milk wagon, which normally drew up at his residence around this time, stood there today, nonchalant, as if this were a day like any other. So nothing has changed outside, the district captain determined. Was it possible that there had been no mail? Was it possible that Jacques had forgotten it? Herr von Trotta shook the handbell. Its silvery peal scurried through the silent house. No one came. The district captain did not touch his breakfast for now. He shook the bell once more. Finally there was a knock. He was amazed, startled, and offended upon seeing his housekeeper, Fr\x{e4}ulein Hirschwitz, enter.",

He had unusual notions about the eastern border of the monarchy. Because of embarrassing lapses in duty, two of his schoolmates had been transferred to that distant crownland, at whose edges the Siberian wind could probably be heard howling. The civilized Austrian was menaced there by bears and wolves and even more dreadful monsters, such as lice and bedbugs. The Ruthenian peasants made sacrifices to pagan gods, and the Jews raged cruelly against other people\x{2019}s property. Herr von Trotta took along his old revolver. He was not the least bit terrified of adventure; indeed, he experienced that intoxication he had felt in his long-buried boyhood\x{2014}the excitement that had driven him and his friend Moser to go hunting in the mysterious wooded depths of his father\x{2019}s estate and to visit the graveyard at <<midnight|13>>.",

From time to time the wind billowed the sunny yellow curtains on the high arched windows, and a touch of summery green stole into the district captain\x{2019}s field of vision.

Although the ladies were hot they smiled, each lady a cheerful breeze. They smiled with lips and eyes, with breasts trapped in airy tight-hooked frocks, with ajouris\x{e9} lace gloves that reached up to their elbows, with tiny handkerchiefs that they held in their hands, sometimes dabbing their noses\x{2014}but gently, gently to avoid tattering the lace. Vendors sold candy, champagne, and tickets for the wheel of fortune, which was handled personally by the superintendent, and colored pouches of confetti, which was poured on all of them and which they tried to puff away by coquettishly pursing their lips.

One couldn\x{2019}t tell where it came from. The district captain stood up. He himself emanated the new shimmer. The pure silver of his beard tinged the greenish light of the day and the reddish glow of the carpet. It exhaled the radiant mildness of an unknown, perhaps otherworldly day that was already dawning in the midst of Herr von Trotta\x{2019}s earthly life, just as the mornings of this world begin to dawn while the stars of the night are still shining.

Christmas and Easter he spent at his uncle\x{2019}s. He came home only during summer holidays. He always arrived on a Sunday. This accorded with the wishes of his father, Herr District Captain Franz, Baron von Trotta und Sipolje. At home, summer vacation, no matter when it commenced at school, had to begin on a Saturday. On Sundays, Herr von Trotta was off duty. He reserved the entire morning, from <<nine to twelve|10a:1>>, for his son. Punctually at <<ten minutes to nine|10>>, a quarter hour after early mass, the boy stood in his Sunday uniform outside his father\x{2019}s door.

They could see his faltering steps and his sparkling glasses. They could see Count Tattenbach, his short rotund body on bandy equestrian legs, the eternally red skull with the close-shorn clear-blond hair parted down the middle and his pale, beady, red-rimmed little eyes. They could hear the physician\x{2019}s gentle voice and the rittmaster\x{2019}s thunderous voice. And even though the words \x{201c}honor\x{201d} and \x{201c}dying,\x{201d} \x{201c}shooting\x{201d} and \x{201c}fighting,\x{201d} \x{201c}death\x{201d} and \x{201c}grave\x{201d} had been at home in their hearts and minds ever since they could think and feel, it struck them today as incomprehensible that they might be separated forever from the rittmaster\x{2019}s thunderous voice and the physician\x{2019}s gentle one. Whenever the doleful chimes of the large wall clock rang out, the men believed that their own final hour had struck. Unwilling to trust their ears, they looked at the wall. No doubt about it: time had not paused. <<Seven-twenty|9j>>, <<seven-twenty|9j>>, <<seven-twenty|9j>>: it hammered in all brains.",

The cadet at the Imperial and Royal Military Academy had been intimate with the notion of death, but it had been a very remote death. Tomorrow morning, <<seven-twenty|9j>>, Death was waiting for his friend, Dr. Demant; the day after tomorrow, or in a few days, for Lieutenant Carl Joseph von Trotta. Oh, horror and darkness! To be the cause of Death\x{2019}s black arrival and finally to be his victim! And should he not become his victim, how many corpses still lined the roadway? Like milestones on other men\x{2019}s roads, the gravestones lay along Trotta\x{2019}s road. He was certain he would never see his friend again, just as he had never seen Katharina again. Never again! In front of Carl Joseph\x{2019}s eyes, this word stretched out without shore or limit, a dead sea of numb eternity. The little lieutenant clenched his white weak fist against the grand black law, which rolled up the headstones but set no dam against the relentlessness of never and refused to illuminate the everlasting darkness. He clenched his fist; he stepped over to the window to raise his fist against heaven. But he raised only his eyes. He saw the cold twinkling of the winter stars. He remembered the night, the last time he had walked with Dr. Demant, from the barracks to the town. The last time, he had known then.",

He dashed over to the clothes hook, strapped on his saber and yanked on his coat, hurried along the corridor and practically soared down the stairs, raced across the nocturnal rectangle of the parade ground, out the gates, past the sentry, ran through the silent landscape, reached the little town in ten minutes and, a while later, the only sleigh that was on lonely night duty; and he glided amid the comforting jingling toward the southern edge of the town, toward the physician\x{2019}s house. Behind the gate the small house slept with sightless windows. Trotta rang the bell. The hush continued. He shouted Dr. Demant\x{2019}s name. Nothing stirred. He waited.

The tinny strains of a pianola blaring somewhere through the nocturnal hush gave him a momentary goal; he hurried toward the metallic rattle. It resounded through the dimly lit glass door of a tavern near Frau Resi\x{2019}s establishment, a tavern patronized by the troops but off limits to officers. The lieutenant stepped up to the brightly glowing window and peered over the reddish curtain into the taproom. He could see the counter and the haggard proprietor in shirtsleeves. At <<one|9t:0>> table, three men, likewise in shirtsleeves, were playing cards; at another table, a corporal was sitting, with a girl at his side and beer glasses in front of them. In the corner, a man sat alone, holding a pencil, hunched over a sheet of paper. He wrote something, broke off, sipped a drink, and stared into space. All at once his glasses focused on the window.

His sparkling glasses approached the lieutenant\x{2019}s light-brown hair. He, the wise Dr. Demant, had already settled accounts with the world; he had sent his wife to her father in Vienna, given his orderly leave, closed down his house. He had been staying at the Golden Bear Hotel ever since the eruption of this disastrous affair. He was ready. Once he had started drinking liquor contrary to his habit, he had actually managed to find some sense in this senseless duel, to wish for death as the lawful end of a path bristling with errors\x{2014}indeed, he managed to glean a shimmer of the next world, which he had always believed in. After all, long before the danger toward which he was now heading, he had been familiar with graves and dead friends. Gone was his childish love for his wife. Jealousy, painfully burning in his heart just weeks ago, was now a small pile of cold ashes. His will, just written, addressed to the colonel, was in his coat pocket. He had nothing to bequeath, few people to remember, and thus had forgotten nothing. The alcohol gave him a light head; only the waiting made him impatient. <<Seven-twenty|9j>>, the moment that for days now had been hammering dreadfully in the brains of all his comrades, pealed in his brain like a silvery chime. For the first time since he had donned his uniform, he felt strong, brave, and lighthearted. He enjoyed the nearness of death the way a convalescent enjoys the nearness of life.

All his life, he had sat at such a gateway\x{2014}a much bigger one, probably. He would rise to his feet when the farmers drew up.
