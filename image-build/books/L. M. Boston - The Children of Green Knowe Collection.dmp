            'It was Christmas Eve. There had been snow, then a dripping thaw that had filled the river, followed by a sudden hard frost. The trees dangled with icicles that tinkled like Japanese bells. The eaves were jagged with ice daggers. The ground was hard like glazed rock, the moat frozen. Toby and Alexander, with their mother, had gone on foot to <<Midnight|13>> Mass at the big church in Penny Soaky across the river. The little church in this village belonged to what Linnet called the preachies, who did not celebrate <<Midnight|13>> Mass. The family had gone on foot because the road was too slippery for horses, the ruts too hard for a coach. Linnet could not walk so far, so she was put to bed and the grandmother sat downstairs alone. Linnet took Orlando, her little black and white curly dog, to bed with her.',

            "Out into the moonlight came St Christopher himself, huge and gentle and with his head among the stars, taking the stone Child on his shoulders to <<Midnight|13>> Mass. As they went past, Orlando lifted his chin and gave a little cry, and from the stables came a quiet whinny. All the birds in the spruce tree woke up and flew out of the window, circling round St Christopher with excited calls. The stone giant strode across the lawns with his bare feet and soon came to the river. At the edge there was thin, loose ice that shivered like a window-pane as he stepped in. The water rushed round his legs and the reflection of the moon was torn to wet ribbons. The stream crept up to his waist and, as he still went on, to his armpits. When it looked as if he could go no farther Linnet heard a child\x{2019}s voice singing gaily. The sound was torn and scattered by the wind as the moon\x{2019}s reflection had been by the water, but she recognized the song as it came in snatches.",

            'When St Christopher was out of sight Linnet realized that it was cold. She also remembered that she had got into bed without saying her prayers. She said them now, and Orlando lay on her feet and kept them warm till she had finished. Then she got into bed again and before long the bells rang out for <<midnight|13>>, and it was Christmas morning. When the boys came back she told them what she had seen. Alexander said he too had seen St Christopher kneeling among the tombstones outside the church in the shadow of a big cypress tree. He thought nobody else had noticed.',

            "Tolly was far too excited to think of going to bed. His head was in a whirl, thinking of the Christmas tree, of the live partridge that should arrive tomorrow, of his present for his great-grandmother, of the probability that there would be some sort of a present for him, of the cradle song in Mrs Oldknow\x{2019}s room, of the children, of the loveliness of everything. The only thing he never thought of was something he had done himself that morning. Now he was trying to contrive ways of staying up longer. Asking questions seemed the easiest way.
\x{2018}Shall we go to <<Midnight|13>> Mass if it snows?\x{2019}
\x{2018}I believe it is thunder,\x{2019} said Mrs Oldknow. \x{2018}Open the door, Tolly, and listen.\x{2019} Tolly opened the door into the garden. It was a dark evening with tattered clouds in front of a slatey sky. He heard no thunder. It was even unnaturally quiet. Perhaps it only seemed unnatural because he himself was brimming with excitement. He heard the weir pounding at the end of the garden. It only made the quietness quieter. It was rather like a heart that is only heard when it beats too loud. Tolly wondered how loud Feste\x{2019}s heart would sound if you put your head against his ribs after a gallop.",

Before starting to walk to <<Midnight|13>> Mass with Mrs Oldknow, Tolly had been privately to look at St Christopher. The moon shone full on his weathered stone face. He looked as if he had not moved since the beginning of time. As they set off with their moon shadows playing on the path round their feet, Tolly wondered if Linnet was looking out of the top window.',

They put on their warmest clothes and crept silently downstairs. Although nobody had told them they were not to go out at <<midnight|13>>, they knew enough of grown-ups to expect to be sent back to bed if they were caught. Creaking floors and old obstinate doors and steep uncarpeted stairs had to be passed, the flashlight travelling from banister to banister till they were down on the brick floor of the hall, where all the scents of the day before were settling as mud settles in still water.',

She had been facing it all the time, but had been more interested in what was round her \x{2013} water rats swimming in search of land, earwigs troubled at finding themselves afloat on sticks. Now she searched the hillock where the windmill stood for something unusual. She saw nothing except a dead tree lying uprooted near the water\x{2019}s edge. Its roots had been broken off, all but two which were bent back under one of those fuzzy knobs that the boles of elm trees often have, which, if the tree had been a piece of sculpture, would have been the head of a reclining figure. There were only two branches left, and they were crossed one over the other like legs. Quite an ordinary thing to see, really. Only while she was looking at it the branches moved and crossed the other leg over. And the foot swung contentedly in the lazy <<noon|13>> air.",
