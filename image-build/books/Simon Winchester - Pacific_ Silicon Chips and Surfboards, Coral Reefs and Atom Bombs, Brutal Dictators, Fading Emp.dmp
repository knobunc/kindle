Albatross have been seen soaring above the waves from Skagway to Shanghai, from Midway to Nome. By <<2018|9n:0>> the numbers will have risen to eight thousand, by which time the bird will be officially declared no longer at imminent risk.

All the aircraft had flown safely away from the air base and the naval air station. Streams of military trucks and private cars were taking airmen and civilians down to Subic. Traffic jams extended for miles. Heavily armed U.S. Marines lined the choked highway, in case Marxist rebels operating in the region took the opportunity to stage ambushes. The <<noontime|13>> temperature was well over one hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and the combination of fear, urgency, and the ever-present sight of the erupting volcano nearby made for a volatile couple of days.',

Nine hundred feet had been erased from the mountaintop,3 hurled out and into the upper atmosphere and then back down to earth, which meant the two bases below had been wrecked, utterly. They were covered in a foot and more of heavy, gray, and greasy mud. It would take millions of dollars to clean up the bases, and they would be inoperable for years.',

The existence of an ephemeral line that magically decreed it to be <<noon|13>> on a nonworking Tokyo Saturday while it was still breakfast time on a potentially busy California Friday had scarcely any effect on such matters as the trade in guano futures.
