            "I confess to you that I lied to the travel agent about my assets. When I arrived, almost the first thing I did was to cautiously convert a couple of slow cents into fast money. I did it reluctantly. The best slow-to-fast exchange rate I could find here was usurious\x{2014}I took a 92-percent hit on the public rate, never mind what a relative would have fronted me\x{2014}but to up-convert with full and final settlement via the issuing bank would take nearly a billion seconds: It\x{2019}s not called slow money for nothing. I was not, in fact, sleeping on park benches and subsisting on raw hydrocarbon slurry: But I saw no need to advertise the fact that I had <<7.02|5a:0>> slow dollars signed and sealed to my soul chips, and another 208.91 medium dollars at my fingertips. That much money walking around unguarded was an invitation to a mugging or worse.",

            "The deacon appeared to be a fully gendered male, possibly to the extent of being equipped with the coupling peripherals required by a follower of the holy pleasure. (His robe, thankfully, concealed any such distasteful details from view.) What I could see of him suggested that his body was nearly as thin as his silent charges\x{2014}he was almost skeletal. But while they were clearly Fragile and dead, give or take a few wires and motors, he was clearly Post and alive. His skin was <<midnight|13>> black, his eyes a solid sapphire blue that matched his close-cropped hair\x{2014}and large, befitting a body tailored for life in the abyssal depths of space. He showed few other obvious signs of phenotypic modification away from the archaic Fragile human baseline. \x{201c}The skeleton\x{2014}may I ask what you\x{2019}re using it for?\x{201d} I asked.",

            "It is colder beneath the thermocline, and the pressure rises steadily the farther the corpse falls from the roof of the world. The red light of <<noon|13>> fades to the dim purple glow of the disphotic zone. In the direction of travel, there is no light to speak of: just a darkness as palpable as a black hole\x{2019}s event horizon. The waters of this zone are a-chirp with the hunting clicks and shrills of saprophytic feeders: The overlapping thermoclines above reflect tight-beam upward-directed sonar pulses back down, illuminating prey and fragments of falling food without revealing the location of the scavengers to their toothy, bug-eyed predators.",
