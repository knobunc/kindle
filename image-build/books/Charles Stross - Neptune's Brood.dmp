I did it reluctantly. The best slow-to-fast exchange rate I could find here was usurious\x{2014}I took a 92-percent hit on the public rate, never mind what a relative would have fronted me\x{2014}but to up-convert with full and final settlement via the issuing bank would take nearly a billion seconds: It\x{2019}s not called slow money for nothing. I was not, in fact, sleeping on park benches and subsisting on raw hydrocarbon slurry: But I saw no need to advertise the fact that I had <<7.02|5a:0>> slow dollars signed and sealed to my soul chips, and another 208.91 medium dollars at my fingertips. That much money walking around unguarded was an invitation to a mugging or worse.",

The starship itself was decelerating constantly, but at less than a thousand milligees: Even though it had prodigious amounts of power on tap, if it tried to sustain any higher acceleration, its crew would find themselves roasting in the fusion reactors\x{2019} waste heat. Our main hazards were threefold. The antimeteoroid point-defense devices behind the starship\x{2019}s frontal shield might mistake us for a snowball on a collision course; Sondra might attempt to bring the beacon laser to bear on us; or she might do something really unfortunate with her drive torch if she realized what was going on. My greatest hope was that she would continue to pursue the radar decoy, which was obscured to her optical sensors by the fiery plume of her rocket exhaust. So I endured several minutes of deepening dread and growing terror as I waited for the circle of sky at the front of our cargo bay to flash brighter than a million suns and melt my face.",
