            "I confess to you that I lied to the travel agent about my assets. When I arrived, almost the first thing I did was to cautiously convert a couple of slow cents into fast money. I did it reluctantly. The best slow-to-fast exchange rate I could find here was usurious\x{2014}I took a 92-percent hit on the public rate, never mind what a relative would have fronted me\x{2014}but to up-convert with full and final settlement via the issuing bank would take nearly a billion seconds: It\x{2019}s not called slow money for nothing. I was not, in fact, sleeping on park benches and subsisting on raw hydrocarbon slurry: But I saw no need to advertise the fact that I had <<7.02|5a:0>> slow dollars signed and sealed to my soul chips, and another 208.91 medium dollars at my fingertips. That much money walking around unguarded was an invitation to a mugging or worse.",

(His robe, thankfully, concealed any such distasteful details from view.) What I could see of him suggested that his body was nearly as thin as his silent charges\x{2014}he was almost skeletal. But while they were clearly Fragile and dead, give or take a few wires and motors, he was clearly Post and alive. His skin was <<midnight|13>> black, his eyes a solid sapphire blue that matched his close-cropped hair\x{2014}and large, befitting a body tailored for life in the abyssal depths of space. He showed few other obvious signs of phenotypic modification away from the archaic Fragile human baseline. \x{201c}The skeleton\x{2014}may I ask what you\x{2019}re using it for?\x{201d} I asked.",

            "It is colder beneath the thermocline, and the pressure rises steadily the farther the corpse falls from the roof of the world. The red light of <<noon|13>> fades to the dim purple glow of the disphotic zone. In the direction of travel, there is no light to speak of: just a darkness as palpable as a black hole\x{2019}s event horizon. The waters of this zone are a-chirp with the hunting clicks and shrills of saprophytic feeders: The overlapping thermoclines above reflect tight-beam upward-directed sonar pulses back down, illuminating prey and fragments of falling food without revealing the location of the scavengers to their toothy, bug-eyed predators.",

            "Not only was it over two hundred kilometers away, it was receding from us at twenty kilometers a second, albeit decelerating, its drive torch pointed away from us and toward the vector we had been following seconds earlier. At <<ten|9m>> gees, it would take us close to four minutes to stop the gap from widening further\x{2014}but then we would close it extremely rapidly, before flipping end over end for the final dive. The starship itself was decelerating constantly, but at less than a thousand milligees: Even though it had prodigious amounts of power on tap, if it tried to sustain any higher acceleration, its crew would find themselves roasting in the fusion reactors\x{2019} waste heat. Our main hazards were threefold. The antimeteoroid point-defense devices behind the starship\x{2019}s frontal shield might mistake us for a snowball on a collision course; Sondra might attempt to bring the beacon laser to bear on us; or she might do something really unfortunate with her drive torch if she realized what was going on. My greatest hope was that she would continue to pursue the radar decoy, which was obscured to her optical sensors by the fiery plume of her rocket exhaust. So I endured several minutes of deepening dread and growing terror as I waited for the circle of sky at the front of our cargo bay to flash brighter than a million suns and melt my face.",
