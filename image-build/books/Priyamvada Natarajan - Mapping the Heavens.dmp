            'One of the early milestones in mapping was the estimate in 240 BCE of the circumference of the earth by the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes, who noted that in the town of Syene (modern-day Aswan) on the longest day each year (the summer solstice) there was no shadow cast at <<noon|13>>. He was aware that the sun was not directly overhead on the same day in his hometown of Alexandria along the Nile in northern Egypt, so he estimated the discrepancy in its position by calculating the angle produced by the shadow of a tall tower in Alexandria. Using geometry and knowledge of the distance between the two cities, he arrived at a figure for the circumference of the earth that was just about 16 percent off the modern measurement of about forty thousand kilometers (twenty-five thousand miles).',

            "On a cold February morning in 1848, Edgar Allan Poe gave a lecture titled \x{201c}On the Cosmography of the Universe.\x{201d} The location was the stately Society Library in New York. Only sixty people attended, and they left utterly disappointed and baffled. Still, this talk and the work that preceded it would serve as the basis for the prose poem \x{201c}Eureka,\x{201d} in which Poe presents his personal conception of the origin of the universe. Some read \x{201c}Eureka\x{201d} as prophetic\x{2014}anticipating new scientific discoveries\x{2014}others as romantic, deeply personal, or even intentionally satirical. In the opening section, Poe declares, \x{201c}I design to speak of the Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical\x{2014} of the Material and Spiritual Universe: of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny.\x{201d} He goes on to describe the universe as restless and evolving. This was in stark contrast to the scientific community\x{2019}s existing view of a static universe. Lacking proof, Poe\x{2019}s poem attempts to convince through suggestion. By <<1848|9:0>>, however, it was impossible to persuade anyone of the validity of a new scientific idea without presenting empirical evidence. A scientific explanation needed support from data. Of course, Poe had not conducted any scientific research. But he was right.",

            'It was Slipher, mentioned above, who discerned one of the early hints from data using these new observational tools, finding in 1912 that the Andromeda Nebula appeared to be rushing toward us at a rather dramatic speed of about three hundred kilometers (186 miles) per second, which is about a million kilometers (more than six hundred thousand miles) per hour. By <<1914|9:1>>, by measuring their velocities, he found that several other nebulae were also peculiarly flying rapidly, but away from us. These speeds were impossible to conceive. The fastest car in the 1912 Indianapolis 500 rally, for example, clocked in at an average speed of only 129 kilometers (eighty miles) per hour. Part of the puzzlement of these measurements was how entirely beyond human grasp these tremendous speeds were.',

            "Astronomers had started studying nebulae, and Slipher had, by <<1914|9:0>>, measured the speeds of thirteen of them, using the change in wavelength of light that results from relative motion of the source with respect to us. Just as the sound of the siren of an approaching ambulance is shriller (has a higher pitch) when it is moving toward us, light emitted from a body moving toward us is shifted in frequency and wavelength toward the blue end of the spectrum, or blueshifted. Conversely, when the object emitting light is moving away from us, the wavelength shifts to the redder end and is measured as a redshift. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect. Using this effect, whereby the wavelength stretch or compression of the light that we receive on earth reflects the motion of the object, Slipher estimated that the typical nebula was moving away from us at a speed of approximately six hundred kilometers (373 miles) per second, which is significantly higher than the speed of any known object in the sky. Over the next eight years he amassed data for about forty such nebulae and found that they all seemed to be consistently receding, with the exception of Andromeda. Astronomers, including Hubble, pondered Slipher\x{2019}s results, and even eminent theorists, such as Eddington, were baffled by these large speeds. These measurements were confusing to interpret, but it was acknowledged that they were important and required further study and understanding. At the time, the fact that these nebulae were extragalactic was not recognized, as the key unknown was their distance from us.",

            "Hubble decided to tackle the challenge of measuring distances to nebulae. Using Leavitt\x{2019}s method, he began to look for more Cepheids. This took many long, lonely nights of observing with the help of an assistant, sitting still on the platform next to the instrument mounted on the hundred-inch mirror and tracking stars. Hubble dressed warmly, and once the telescope clicked into place and pointed to where he intended, he would light his pipe and sit hunched over, watching the heavens swing slowly by. On one of these celestial <<vigils|13>>, much to his excitement, he found one Cepheid in the Andromeda Nebula (our nearest neighboring galaxy) and successfully measured its distance from earth to be nine hundred thousand light-years, about three times the size of our galaxy as estimated by Shapley using the same techniques on nearby cosmic objects.21",

            "General relativity predicts gravitational lensing\x{2014}as mass distorts space, tracking the distortion, light bends. When the earth and the sun align during a solar eclipse, the divot caused by their masses is deeper, which makes the bending of light observable. The astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich proposed the first experiment to verify the theory of general relativity, by observing the bending of starlight during a total solar eclipse. Presenting his proposal to make this astronomical observation, he informed Einstein that the next observable total eclipse would be visible from Crimea in the summer of 1914. Einstein even helped raise funds for the expedition, which set off early that summer, but the outbreak of World War I ended the quest. Much to the shock of the pacifist Einstein, the Russian army in Odessa arrested and imprisoned the entourage. This delayed verification until <<1919|9c:0>>, when Arthur Eddington led one of two British expeditions during a solar eclipse to measure the deviation in the path of light rays that passed close to the sun. Eddington photographed and measured the positions of several stars near the sun during the eclipse. Light from these distant stars traversed space-time that was distorted by the gravity of the sun. These stars appeared displaced from their positions measured six months before the eclipse. The presence of the sun had indeed deflected the light by the amounts that Einstein\x{2019}s theory exactly predicted. Eddington\x{2019}s November 6, 1919, announcement of the discovery of light bending to a joint meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society made Einstein instantly famous. Yet confirmation of this theory did more than make Einstein an icon; it opened up investigation of further potential applications.11",

            "By 1997 both had enough supernovae to draw and extend Hubble\x{2019}s original diagram from <<1929|9c:0>>. In doing so, however, they found incredibly bizarre and puzzling results. They remained cautious in their announcements, going only so far as to claim that they both seemed to have accumulating evidence for a low-matter-content universe. At this point what really amped up the game was supernovae data from the Hubble Space Telescope. The exquisite resolution of this telescope, orbiting in space, means that its measurements of light are significantly more accurate than any data taken from the ground, where the earth\x{2019}s atmosphere blurs light. Although astronomers can account and correct for this blur, such corrections add to the overall error incurred in the measurement. The race here was for accuracy and precision, and to achieve them required meticulously characterizing all sources of error. Once both teams analyzed their first data from Hubble, they found that its two initial supernovae data points were not lining up with their earlier trend. So they waited patiently to get more data, and once they had a handful of supernovae\x{2014}six, in fact\x{2014}the Supernova Cosmology Project submitted its paper to Nature, in the first week of October 1997.",
