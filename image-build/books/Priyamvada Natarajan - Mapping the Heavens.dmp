            'One of the early milestones in mapping was the estimate in 240 BCE of the circumference of the earth by the Greek astronomer Eratosthenes, who noted that in the town of Syene (modern-day Aswan) on the longest day each year (the summer solstice) there was no shadow cast at <<noon|13>>. He was aware that the sun was not directly overhead on the same day in his hometown of Alexandria along the Nile in northern Egypt, so he estimated the discrepancy in its position by calculating the angle produced by the shadow of a tall tower in Alexandria. Using geometry and knowledge of the distance between the two cities, he arrived at a figure for the circumference of the earth that was just about 16 percent off the modern measurement of about forty thousand kilometers (twenty-five thousand miles).',

            "There is no doubt that the Copernican system was a disruption of all prior notions of the heavens\x{2014}it implied not only that the earth revolved around the sun but also, because the arrangement of stars remained fixed despite the earth\x{2019}s movement in its proposed orbit (an absence of what is called parallax), that the stars were far, far away. The celestial frontier had been pushed out. Fearful of re jection, Copernicus at first hesitated to publish his full treatise on the subject, De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres), until <<1543|9:0>>. Eventually, a bishop encouraged its publication, and Copernicus dedicated it to the pope. It was only more than seventy years later, in 1616, that the work was banned, until it was \x{201c}corrected\x{201d} by the Catholic inquisition. A list of \x{201c}corrections\x{201d} was issued, with a handful of passages (in about ten places) deleted, including ones that presented the motion of the earth as a fact rather than a hypothesis. These amendments were made to present heliocentrism as just a convenient way of describing the planets\x{2019} motion\x{2014}a frame of reference\x{2014}not reality. As we will see in many of the following chapters, similar dodges have often been needed as part of the course in making radical ideas more palatable.",

            "On a cold February morning in 1848, Edgar Allan Poe gave a lecture titled \x{201c}On the Cosmography of the Universe.\x{201d} The location was the stately Society Library in New York. Only sixty people attended, and they left utterly disappointed and baffled. Still, this talk and the work that preceded it would serve as the basis for the prose poem \x{201c}Eureka,\x{201d} in which Poe presents his personal conception of the origin of the universe. Some read \x{201c}Eureka\x{201d} as prophetic\x{2014}anticipating new scientific discoveries\x{2014}others as romantic, deeply personal, or even intentionally satirical. In the opening section, Poe declares, \x{201c}I design to speak of the Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical\x{2014} of the Material and Spiritual Universe: of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny.\x{201d} He goes on to describe the universe as restless and evolving. This was in stark contrast to the scientific community\x{2019}s existing view of a static universe. Lacking proof, Poe\x{2019}s poem attempts to convince through suggestion. By <<1848|9e:1>>, however, it was impossible to persuade anyone of the validity of a new scientific idea without presenting empirical evidence. A scientific explanation needed support from data. Of course, Poe had not conducted any scientific research. But he was right.",

            'It was Slipher, mentioned above, who discerned one of the early hints from data using these new observational tools, finding in 1912 that the Andromeda Nebula appeared to be rushing toward us at a rather dramatic speed of about three hundred kilometers (186 miles) per second, which is about a million kilometers (more than six hundred thousand miles) per hour. By <<1914|9e:1>>, by measuring their velocities, he found that several other nebulae were also peculiarly flying rapidly, but away from us. These speeds were impossible to conceive. The fastest car in the 1912 Indianapolis 500 rally, for example, clocked in at an average speed of only 129 kilometers (eighty miles) per hour. Part of the puzzlement of these measurements was how entirely beyond human grasp these tremendous speeds were.',

            "Astronomers had started studying nebulae, and Slipher had, by <<1914|9e:1>>, measured the speeds of thirteen of them, using the change in wavelength of light that results from relative motion of the source with respect to us. Just as the sound of the siren of an approaching ambulance is shriller (has a higher pitch) when it is moving toward us, light emitted from a body moving toward us is shifted in frequency and wavelength toward the blue end of the spectrum, or blueshifted. Conversely, when the object emitting light is moving away from us, the wavelength shifts to the redder end and is measured as a redshift. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect. Using this effect, whereby the wavelength stretch or compression of the light that we receive on earth reflects the motion of the object, Slipher estimated that the typical nebula was moving away from us at a speed of approximately six hundred kilometers (373 miles) per second, which is significantly higher than the speed of any known object in the sky. Over the next eight years he amassed data for about forty such nebulae and found that they all seemed to be consistently receding, with the exception of Andromeda. Astronomers, including Hubble, pondered Slipher\x{2019}s results, and even eminent theorists, such as Eddington, were baffled by these large speeds. These measurements were confusing to interpret, but it was acknowledged that they were important and required further study and understanding. At the time, the fact that these nebulae were extragalactic was not recognized, as the key unknown was their distance from us.",

This took many long, lonely nights of observing with the help of an assistant, sitting still on the platform next to the instrument mounted on the hundred-inch mirror and tracking stars. Hubble dressed warmly, and once the telescope clicked into place and pointed to where he intended, he would light his pipe and sit hunched over, watching the heavens swing slowly by. On one of these celestial <<vigils|13>>, much to his excitement, he found one Cepheid in the Andromeda Nebula (our nearest neighboring galaxy) and successfully measured its distance from earth to be nine hundred thousand light-years, about three times the size of our galaxy as estimated by Shapley using the same techniques on nearby cosmic objects.21",

            "General relativity predicts gravitational lensing\x{2014}as mass distorts space, tracking the distortion, light bends. When the earth and the sun align during a solar eclipse, the divot caused by their masses is deeper, which makes the bending of light observable. The astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich proposed the first experiment to verify the theory of general relativity, by observing the bending of starlight during a total solar eclipse. Presenting his proposal to make this astronomical observation, he informed Einstein that the next observable total eclipse would be visible from Crimea in the summer of 1914. Einstein even helped raise funds for the expedition, which set off early that summer, but the outbreak of World War I ended the quest. Much to the shock of the pacifist Einstein, the Russian army in Odessa arrested and imprisoned the entourage. This delayed verification until <<1919|9c:0>>, when Arthur Eddington led one of two British expeditions during a solar eclipse to measure the deviation in the path of light rays that passed close to the sun. Eddington photographed and measured the positions of several stars near the sun during the eclipse. Light from these distant stars traversed space-time that was distorted by the gravity of the sun. These stars appeared displaced from their positions measured six months before the eclipse. The presence of the sun had indeed deflected the light by the amounts that Einstein\x{2019}s theory exactly predicted. Eddington\x{2019}s November 6, 1919, announcement of the discovery of light bending to a joint meeting of the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society made Einstein instantly famous. Yet confirmation of this theory did more than make Einstein an icon; it opened up investigation of further potential applications.11",

            "Consider for example Sir William Herschel, the English astronomer who, with a telescope of his own making, discovered the planet Uranus on March 13, 1781. He pushed the known edge of the solar system beyond the classical planets with his sighting. By <<1846|9e:1>>, Uranus had almost completed a full orbit since Herschel\x{2019}s first observation of it. Astronomers, tracking its orbit, found discrepancies that Newton\x{2019}s theory of gravitation could not explain. This pointed to the possibility that either Newton was wrong or his laws of motion needed amending. Starting with the observed anomalies, the French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier suggested that an undetected planet lurking beyond Uranus was affecting its motion, and he calculated where such a planet ought to be. His prediction was verified when Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis d\x{2019}Arrest detected Neptune on September 23, 1846. The British astronomer John Couch Adams was also on the trail and had made an independent prediction; however, Le Verrier beat him to the chase and was the first to report the detection of Neptune. Newton\x{2019}s laws remained intact.27",

They remained cautious in their announcements, going only so far as to claim that they both seemed to have accumulating evidence for a low-matter-content universe. At this point what really amped up the game was supernovae data from the Hubble Space Telescope. The exquisite resolution of this telescope, orbiting in space, means that its measurements of light are significantly more accurate than any data taken from the ground, where the earth\x{2019}s atmosphere blurs light. Although astronomers can account and correct for this blur, such corrections add to the overall error incurred in the measurement. The race here was for accuracy and precision, and to achieve them required meticulously characterizing all sources of error. Once both teams analyzed their first data from Hubble, they found that its two initial supernovae data points were not lining up with their earlier trend. So they waited patiently to get more data, and once they had a handful of supernovae\x{2014}six, in fact\x{2014}the Supernova Cosmology Project submitted its paper to Nature, in the first week of October 1997.",

            "It was <<around 1944|9:0>> that Gamow began working in earnest with Alpher and Herman on cosmic chemistry. Herman, a recent PhD from Princeton, had worked on both expanding the idea of Lema\x{ee}tre\x{2019}s primeval atom and the beginnings of the universe. Gamow wanted to investigate the grand question of how all the known chemical elements had been synthesized. In particular, he wanted to explore if it was possible for all elements to have been made in the early universe, well before the first stars came into existence. He believed strongly in the hot big bang model, a universe with a hot, dense beginning, and was deeply invested in finding ironclad proof, which was lacking at the time. Since it was known that hydrogen and helium could be made in the nascent universe, he surmised that finding a credible explanation for the early origin of the rest of the elements would be the clincher. Adopting a novel methodology, Alpher and Herman extrapolated to the initial conditions, when the density of the universe was very high, starting from the current situation, wherein the universe essentially contains mostly hydrogen- and helium-rich stars. The early universe they estimated would have been so dense that particles and their physical nemeses, antiparticles, could form and destroy one another continually, thus allowing energy and matter to morph into each other rapidly. At extremely high temperatures, Einstein\x{2019}s equivalence between mass and energy (expressed in the famous formula E = mc2) is realized\x{2014}so particles and antiparticles abound. If the early universe was indeed a soup of unruly particles, Alpher and Herman realized, then this constant mass-energy transmutation would likely bring some kind of balance, and as a result the now familiar subatomic particles\x{2014}protons, electrons, neutrons, photons, and neutrinos\x{2014}would then condense into being as the universe expanded and cooled.",

            "This kind of balance is referred to as thermal equilibrium, and it has some unusual properties. Imagine a closed box with opaque walls that trap energy (all forms of radiation, including light) and matter inside. According to quantum mechanics, such a box will reach equilibrium and behave like an ideal \x{201c}blackbody,\x{201d} so that the intensity of radiation it emits will depend only on the temperature of its walls. It was Gamow who first realized and discussed the important role that thermal radiation and thermal equilibrium might play in the synthesis of chemical elements. Following up on his hunch, Alpher and Herman had a key insight. They surmised that the hot, dense, early universe, on achieving thermal balance, would have behaved like a blackbody. And since the identifying feature of blackbodies is their temperature, Alpher and Herman estimated the resulting cosmic temperature\x{2014}the current temperature of the universe. Furthermore, they conjectured that even though expansion had cooled the universe, an indelible signature of the early, heated universe must still survive in the form of blackbody radiation. This pervasiveness of the radiation would arise because of the special shape of emission from a blackbody; a blackbody remains one forever, even as it cools. Therefore the universe would still be a blackbody today, albeit with a lower temperature than at its fiery start. Alpher and Herman estimated the current blackbody temperature to be about five kelvins (\x{2013}268 degrees Celsius or \x{2013}450 degrees Fahrenheit). That the universe is a blackbody and that the early universe and the present-day universe have unique temperatures were remarkable claims. Alpher and Herman\x{2019}s predicted low value for the current cosmic temperature was counterintuitive yet famously close to the value that was measured decades later. High temperatures are somehow more graspable from everyday experience, as we witness boiling water and food sizzling on grills. But this cosmic temperature of five kelvins was way below these familiar temperatures and way below our body temperature, which is <<about 310|9:0>> kelvins, and well below the temperature even of ice. Temperatures aside, the primary goal for Alpher and Herman\x{2019}s calculation was to explain the origin and the buildup of atoms from the primeval fireball. They succeeded only partially in this task\x{2014}only a tiny amount of any element heavier than helium was produced, however hard they tried. They published these new yet unsatisfactory results in the journal Nature in 1948, with the estimate of the extremely low current temperature of the universe tucked away in an aside.6 This paper provided major insights into the physics of the early universe and corrected errors that Gamow had made in one of his previous papers, but it failed to explain the absence of a stable isotope with atomic number 5 in nature. This was a key part of the problem that they had set out to solve. Despite this, Alpher and Herman had many interesting results, including the calculation of the evolution of the density of matter in an expanding universe. However, since they had failed to account for the missing atomic number 5 isotope, and had failed to properly account for the origin of all the heavier elements, the paper was seen as a dud. Unfortunately, as the estimate of the cosmic temperature that they had computed was nestled in a paper that was considered wanting and faulty, it was ignored.",

            "Part of the problem also stemmed from overspecialization and the lack of communication among scientific subfields in astronomy and physics. Herman and Alpher were stellar astrophysicists\x{2014}a distinct subdiscipline\x{2014}by training and thus perceived of as somewhat disconnected from cosmology. Helge Kragh, in his book Cosmology and Controversy, suggests that the conflicting and multiple values for the temperature of the universe (the CMBR) that Gamow, Herman, and Alpher published might have confused astronomers. Besides, it was unclear whether the temperature was of the cosmic origin or if it included the effects of stellar radiation. This confusion in interpretation was in fact an old one and likely led to the dismissal of what might have been truly the first reported detection of the CMBR, even prior to Dicke\x{2019}s aborted attempt. In 1941 the Canadian physicist Andrew McKellar had measured the temperature of the universe without realizing it. He was looking at the carbon-nitrogen cycle as the potential energy source for carbon stars. Thus the toxic organic compound cyanogen (which consists of carbon and nitrogen atoms) had sparked his interest, due to its detection in the tail of Halley\x{2019}s comet in 1910. While studying the spectra of molecules in interstellar space to understand their function and origin, McKellar determined that the poisonous cyanogen molecules were extremely cold\x{2014}in fact, <<around three|9:1>> kelvins (\x{2013}270 degrees Celsius or \x{2013}454 degrees Fahrenheit). No one recognized the importance of this absurdly low temperature or that it had any meaning beyond McKellar\x{2019}s apparently esoteric study. The confusions about exactly what they were measuring aside, Kragh argues that Alpher and Herman made another crucial lapse by not discussing or even speculating on how the temperature that they had estimated might be measured. For example, their 1948 Nature paper fails to calculate and present the precise wavelength at which this cosmic temperature could be detected. In fact, it does not even have a plot of the blackbody curve. Kragh contends (and I agree) that omitting to mention that the cosmic temperature would be observable in the microwave band further deterred experimental efforts to detect it. Additionally, this lack of guidance to focus on the microwave band prevented astronomers from connecting the dots. All of Alpher and Herman\x{2019}s calculations appeared in the context of what was seen as an entirely separate field of study, nuclear physics. Cosmologists simply failed to take notice.9",
