There were farmers and graziers of the richer sort, gentlemen of all sizes and shapes and of every age but his own, red-coated officers, periwigged medical men, black lawyers, snuff-coloured merchants and the clergy in cassocks; footmen in liveries of every colour hurried on errands; parties of young men roared through the windows to their acquaintances within; indeed, half Ireland seemed to be in the great room of the Royal George and Harp. But alas it was the half that did not include the one person he really wanted to see; this person, Mr Peregrine FitzGerald, was unknown to Peter except by reputation and name, but he had a clear notion of what to expect and for hours and hours he had been looking for the arrival of a young fellow about his own age and size, a midshipman in the Royal Navy, who would, Peter supposed, come in and gaze about to find his travelling companion, and who, by his looking about and searching, would advertise his presence.",

The master skimmed Peter\x{2019}s slate at his head and hurried below to refresh his spirits in the wardroom, where he had been invited to the feast the first lieutenant was giving to celebrate their true departure. They had sailed from St Helen\x{2019}s nearly a fortnight before, but they had had to convoy the merchantmen, and it was only now that the Turkey fleet had left them, a great mass of vessels, a hundred sail and more straggling down to Gibraltar: now the squadron was alone, free of the responsibility of guarding the slow, vague, wandering merchantmen; they stood away for the south-west with a fair wind, and the squadron was in high spirits. They made a brave show on the grey sea, five men-of-war in line ahead: the Pearl, of forty guns, the Gloucester fifty, the Severn fifty, the Wager of only twenty-eight, but looking more like a ship of the line, being an East-Indiaman bought by the Admiralty to carry stores and land artillery, and the Centurion of sixty, wearing the Commodore\x{2019}s broad pennant. In the middle of the line, but away to windward, sailed the Tryal, eight, a sloop of war; and to the lee the victuallers, the Anna and the Industry, two little chartered pinks that were intended to accompany the squadron part of the way, carrying stores until the men-of-war should have room for them. It was a brave show, and it was a formidable armament as well: some two thousand men were in the ships, more than two hundred guns, and deep down, far below in the carefully laden magazines, each ship carried ton upon ton of black, gritty sharp-smelling and immensely potent gunpowder, every ounce of which was meant to be used, as the Fighting Instructions said, to take, burn, sink or destroy the King\x{2019}s enemies\x{2014}in this case the ships and the cities of the power of Spain.",

Edging up to the north with reborn hope the Centurion, the Gloucester, the Tryal, the Wager and the little Anna pink, shattered, pumping day and night, but still capable of high ambition, sailed day after day.

This is my 3rd birthday at sea: Sean gave me another comforter, which there is not room in the berth to measure exactly. Mr Walter some excellent guavas, preserved.

He could not face small beer and biscuit, nor the unending guess and conjecture of the berth. He moved slowly up to the foretop in the grey light of the declining moon: the dew was wet under his hands, and the rigging fiddle-string tight. The Centurion lay head-on to the Pacific surge, and remotely before her the stars shone low. It was now the morning watch, and somewhere beyond the rim of the sea the sun would have risen. Peter made a quick calculation: yes, the first rays would be coming green through the woods in Tinian now. They would be lighting the blackened keel of the bark they had burnt: and the dawn would be racing westward at an inconceivable speed. Soon\x{2014}in an hour and a half or thereabouts\x{2014}it would have covered the whole tract of sea that had taken them so long to pass, and it would put out the stars.",
