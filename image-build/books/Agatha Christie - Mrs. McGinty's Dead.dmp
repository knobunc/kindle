            "In the early 1960s, a series of four rather poorly made British films featuring Agatha Christie\x{2019}s Miss Marple was released, with the popular English comedy actress Margaret Rutherford as Jane Marple. The first and the best of them, Murder, She Said, was based on <<4.50|5a:0>> From Paddington (see pp. 283\x{2013}7), a Miss Marple adventure. The second, Murder at the Gallop, however, was based on a Poirot novel, After the Funeral, with Poirot transformed into Miss Marple for the film (see p. 266). And the third, Murder Most Foul (1964), is based, very loosely and distantly, on Mrs McGinty\x{2019}s Dead, and again turns Hercule Poirot into Jane Marple! Apart from Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple, who finds herself on a jury and in disagreement with her fellow jurors who think the accused guilty, the cast includes Ron Moody, Charles Tingwell, Megs Jenkins and Margaret Rutherford\x{2019}s husband, Stringer Davis, a mediocre actor who, at his wife\x{2019}s insistence, had a role written into the series for him. The murdered woman is no longer an old charlady but a blackmailing actress. The limp screenplay is by David Pursall and Jack Seddon, who wrote three of the four Miss Marple films, as well as two other Christie film adaptations (Ten Little Indians and The Alphabet Murders, both in 1965), and the director is George Pollock, who was responsible for all of the Margaret Rutherford Miss Marple films and for Ten Little Indians.",
