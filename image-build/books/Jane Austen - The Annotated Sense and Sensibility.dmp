Marianne Dashwood\x{2019}s feelings and ideas exemplify central principles espoused by its advocates, while the miseries she inflicts on herself and others echo those evoked or portrayed by its critics. The years <<after 1800|18:0>>, when Jane Austen was revising the novel, saw explicit discussion of sensibility fade. But the underlying issues remained, for most of the main elements of the doctrine were replicated in Romanticism, which emerged during these years as the dominant force in much of the art, literature, and thought of the Western world. The final version of the novel reveals an awareness of these new trends by mentioning Sir Walter Scott, whose Romantic narrative poems were the greatest sellers of the age, as one of Marianne\x{2019}s favorite writers, and by satirizing the Romantic taste for the cottage, a new fad among the wealthy in England in the years <<after 1800|18:0>>. While it is not certain whether Austen would have set out to write a novel criticizing sensibility during this later period, she undoubtedly sensed, with justification, that the issues it raised and the points it made remained highly pertinent.",

Many took refuge in England, especially in London, and remained there until <<1814|18:0>>\x{2013}1815, when Napoleon was overthrown and the monarchy was restored. Jane Austen had some personal contact with the world of emigrants through Eliza de Feuillide, her cousin who had married an upper-class Frenchman and lived in France for many years before her husband was guillotined during the revolution and she had to flee to England. She lived in London and maintained ties to the community of French exiles, and she eventually married Jane Austen\x{2019}s brother; Jane would stay with them when visiting London. Many of these emigrants were poor, having lost most or all of their property during the revolution, and there were various charitable endeavors to assist them. Buying a needle book would be one logical though modest way to help them: making items like this was a common activity of upper-class women, so the background of many emigrants would make this one means for them to earn a little money.",
