  as Penang Appointment (1934), The Three Friends (1935) and Trinity Town (1936) he was also deputy chairman of the publishers Gollancz, the left\x{2010}wing imprint best known for George Orwell\x{2019}s The Road to Wigan Pier and the Left Book Club series. By <<1941|9u>> Collins could no longer tolerate owner Victor Gollancz\x{2019}s inability to delegate and
  he left for the BBC. He joined at the lower levels as talks assistant but was promoted and by the end of the war was director
  of Overseas Service. From 1945\x{2013}47, soon after London Belongs to Me was published, Collins was in charge of BBC radio\x{2019}s Light Programme, during which time he created the first daily radio serial,
  Dick Barton, a private investigator and sometime special agent who appeared in 711 episodes between 1946 and 1951.",

   train. We don\x{2019}t find out what happens to Hapfel but perhaps Collins contemplated having him shot at the Tower like Josef Jakobs,
   a German spy, who on 15 August 1941 became the last person to be executed there. Jakobs was tied to a Windsor chair, a white
   lint pinned on his chest over his heart, and shot by an eight\x{2010}man firing squad at <<7.12 a.m.|2a>> He was buried in an unmarked grave

  Nothing very spectacular. Nothing exceptionally heroic. Not until <<1940|9c:0>>, that is. Except for the Great Fire and the Black Death
  and the execution of a King not very much has ever happened there. It has just gone on prosperously and independently through
  the centuries \x{2013} wattle one century, timber the next, then brick, then stone, then brick again, then concrete. Building new
  foundations on old ruins. And sprawling out across the fields when there haven\x{2019}t been enough ruins to go round.",

  the only way in which modern Londoners differ from the Londoners who have lived there before them is that all the Londoners
