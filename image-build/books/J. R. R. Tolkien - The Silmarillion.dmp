            "Now as has been told the power of Elw\x{eb} and Melian increased in Middle-earth, and all the Elves of Beleriand, from the mariners of C\x{ed}rdan to the wandering hunters of the Blue Mountains beyond the River Gelion, owned Elw\x{eb} as their lord; Elu Thingol he was called, King Greymantle, in the tongue of his people. They are called the Sindar, the Grey-elves of starlit Beleriand; and although they were Moriquendi, under the lordship of Thingol and the teaching of Melian they became the fairest and the most wise and skilful of all the Elves of Middle-earth. And at the end of the first age of the Chaining of Melkor, when all the Earth had peace and the glory of Valinor was at its <<noon|13>>, there came into the world L\x{fa}thien, the only child of Thingol and Melian. Though Middle-earth lay for the most part in the Sleep of Yavanna, in Beleriand under the power of Melian there was life and joy, and the bright stars shone as silver fires; and there in the forest of Neldoreth L\x{fa}thien was born, and the white flowers of niphredil came forth to greet her as stars from the earth.",

            "In Beleriand in those days the Elves walked, and the rivers flowed, and the stars shone, and the night-flowers gave forth their scents; and the beauty of Melian was as the <<noon|13>>, and the beauty of L\x{fa}thien was as the dawn in spring. In Beleriand King Thingol upon his throne was as the lords of the Maiar, whose power is at rest, whose joy is as an air that they breathe in all their days, whose thought flows in a tide untroubled from the heights to the deeps. In Beleriand still at times rode Orom\x{eb} the great, passing like a wind over the mountains, and the sound of his horn came down the leagues of the starlight, and the Elves feared him for the splendour of his countenance and the great noise of the onrush of Nahar; but when the Valar\x{f3}ma echoed in the hills, they knew well that all evil things were fled far away.",

            "Now after the Dagor Aglareb the unquiet that Ulmo set in his heart returned to him, and he summoned many of the hardiest and most skilled of his people, and led them secretly to the hidden vale, and there they began the building of the city that Turgon had devised; and they set a watch all about it, that none might come upon their work from without, and the power of Ulmo that ran in Sirion protected them. But Turgon dwelt still for the most part in Nevrast, until it came to pass that at last the city was full-wrought, <<after two|9:1>> and fifty years of secret toil. It is said that Turgon appointed its name to be Ondolind\x{eb} in the speech of the Elves of Valinor, the Rock of the Music of Water, for there were fountains upon the hill; but in the Sindarin tongue the name was changed, and it became Gondolin, the Hidden Rock. Then Turgon prepared to depart from Nevrast and leave his halls in Vinyamar beside the sea; and there Ulmo came to him once again, and spoke with him. And he said: \x{2018}Now thou shalt go at last to Gondolin, Turgon; and I will maintain my power in the Vale of Sirion, and in all the waters therein, so that none shall mark thy going, nor shall any find there the hidden entrance against thy will. Longest of all the realms of the Eldali\x{eb} shall Gondolin stand against Melkor. But love not too well the work of thy hands and the devices of thy heart; and remember that the true hope of the Noldor lieth in the West and cometh from the Sea.\x{2019}",

The translation of Carcharoth in the text as \x{2018}Red Maw\x{2019} must depend on association with this word; see carak-. celeb\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}silver\x{2019} (Quenya telep, telp\x{eb}, as in Telperion) in Celeborn, Celebrant, Celebros.

Derived from earlier dome, whence Quenya l\x{f3}m\x{eb}; thus Sindarin d\x{fa}lin \x{2018}nightingale\x{2019} corresponds to l\x{f3}melind\x{eb}. duin\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}(long) river\x{2019} in Anduin, Baranduin, Esgalduin, Malduin, Taur-im-Duinath. d\x{fb}r\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}dark\x{2019} in Barad-d\x{fb}r, Caragd\x{fb}r, Dol Guldur; also in Durthang (a castle in Mordor). \x{eb}ar\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}sea\x{2019} (Quenya) in E\x{e4}rendil, E\x{e4}rr\x{e1}m\x{eb}, and many other names. The Sindarin word gaer (in Belegaer) is apparently derived from the same original stem. echor\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in Echoriath \x{2018}Encircling Mountains\x{2019} and Orfalch Echor; cf. Rammas Echor \x{2018}the great wall of the outer circle\x{2019} about the Pelennor Fields at Minas Tirith. edhel\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}elf\x{2019} (Sindarin) in Adanedhel, Aredhel, Gl\x{f3}redhel, Ost-in-Edhil; also in Peredhil \x{2018}Half-elven\x{2019}. eithel\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}well\x{2019} in Eithel Ivrin, Eithel Sirion, Barad Eithel; also in Mitheithel, the river Hoarwell in Eriador (named from its source). See kel-. \x{ea}l, elen\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}star\x{2019}. According to Elvish legend, ele was a primitive exclamation \x{2018}behold!\x{2019} made by the Elves when they first saw the stars. From this origin derived the ancient words \x{ea}l and elen, meaning \x{2018}star\x{2019}, and the adjectives elda and elena, meaning \x{2018}of the stars\x{2019}. These elements appear in a great many names. For the later use of the name Eldar see the Index. The Sindarin equivalent of Elda was Edhel (plural Edhil), q.v.; but the strictly corresponding form was Eledh, which occurs in Eledhwen. er\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}<<one|9k:0>>, alone\x{2019}, in Amon Ereb (cf. Erebor, the Lonely Mountain), Erchamion, Eress\x{eb}a, Eru. ereg\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}thorn, holly\x{2019} in Eregion, Region. esgal\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}screen, hiding\x{2019} in Esgalduin. falas\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}shore, line of surf\x{2019} (Quenya falass\x{eb}) in Falas, Belfalas; also Anfalas in Gondor. Cf. Falathar, Falathrim. Another derivative from the root was Quenya falma \x{2018}(crested) wave\x{2019}, whence Falmari, Mar-nu-Falmar. faroth\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}is derived from a root meaning \x{2018}hunt, pursue\x{2019}; in the Lay of Leithian the Taur-en-Faroth above Nargothrond are called \x{2018}the Hills of the Hunters\x{2019}. faug-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}gape\x{2019} in Anfauglir, Anfauglith, Dor-nu-Fauglith. f\x{eb}a\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}spirit\x{2019} in F\x{eb}anor, F\x{eb}anturi. fin-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}hair\x{2019} in Finduilas, Fingon, Finrod, Glorfindel. formen\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}north\x{2019} (Quenya) in Formenos; Sindarin forn (also for, forod) in Fornost. fuin\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}gloom, darkness\x{2019} (Quenya huin\x{eb}) in Fuinur, Taur-nu-Fuin. gaer\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}sea\x{2019} in Belegaer (and in Gaerys, Sindarin name of Oss\x{eb}). Said to derive from the stem gaya \x{2018}awe, dread\x{2019}, and to have been the name made for the vast and terrifying Great Sea when the Eldar first came to its shores. gaur\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}werewolf\x{2019} (from a root ngwaw- \x{2018}howl\x{2019}) in Tol-in-Gaurhoth. gil\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}star\x{2019} in Dagor-nuin-Giliath, Osgiliath (giliath \x{2018}host of stars\x{2019}); Gil-Estel, Gil-galad. girith\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}shuddering\x{2019} in Nen Girith; cf. also Girithron, name of the last month of the year in Sindarin (The Lord of the Rings Appendix D). gl\x{ee}n\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}gleam\x{2019} (particularly applied to the eyes) in Maeglin. golodh\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}is the Sindarin form of Quenya Noldo; see g\x{fb}l. Plural Golodhrim, and Gelydh (in Annon-in-Gelydh). gond\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}stone\x{2019} in Gondolin, Gondor, Gonnhirrim, Argonath, seregon. The name of the hidden city of King Turgon was devised by him in Quenya as Ondolind\x{eb} (Quenya ondo = Sindarin gond, and lind\x{eb} \x{2018}singing, song\x{2019}); but it was known always in legend in the Sindarin form Gondolin, which was probably interpreted as gond-dolen \x{2018}Hidden Rock\x{2019}. gor\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}horror, dread\x{2019} in Gorthaur, Gorthol; goroth of the same meaning, with reduplicated gor,in Gorgoroth, Ered Gorgoroth. groth (grod)\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}delving, underground dwelling\x{2019} in Menegroth, Nogrod (probably also in Nimrodel, \x{2018}lady of the white cave\x{2019}). Nogrod was originally Novrod \x{2018}hollow delving\x{2019} (hence the translation Hollowbold), but was altered under the influence of naug \x{2018}dwarf\x{2019}. g\x{fb}l\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}sorcery\x{2019} in Dol Guldur, Minas Morgul. This word was derived from the same ancient stem ngol- that appears in Noldor; cf. Quenya n\x{f3}l\x{eb} \x{2018}long study, lore, knowledge\x{2019}. But the Sindarin word was darkened in sense by its frequent use in the compound morgul \x{2018}black arts\x{2019}. gurth\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}death\x{2019} in Gurthang (see also Melkor in the Index). gwaith\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}people\x{2019} in Gwaith-i-Mirdain; cf. Enedwaith \x{2018}Middle-folk\x{2019}, name of the land between the Greyflood and the Isen. gwath, wath\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}shadow\x{2019} in Deld\x{fa}wath, Ephel D\x{fa}ath; also in Gwathl\x{f3}, the river Greyflood in Eriador. Related forms in Ered Wethrin, Thuringwethil. (This Sindarin word referred to dim light, not to the shadows of objects cast by light: these were called morchaint \x{2018}dark shapes\x{2019}.) hadhod\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in Hadhodrond (translation of Khazad-d\x{fb}m) was a rendering of Khaz\x{e2}d into Sindarin sounds. haudh\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}mound\x{2019} in Haudh-en-Arwen, Haudh-en-Elleth, etc. heru\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}lord\x{2019} in Herumor, Herun\x{fa}men; Sindarin h\x{ee}r in Gonnhirrim, Rohirrim, Barahir; h\x{ed}ril \x{2018}lady\x{2019} in H\x{ed}rilorn. him\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}cool\x{2019} in Himlad (and Himring?). h\x{ed}ni\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}children\x{2019} in Eruh\x{ed}ni \x{2018}Children of Eru\x{2019}; Narn i H\x{ee}n H\x{fa}rin. h\x{ee}th\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}mist\x{2019} in Hithaeglir, Hithlum (also in Nen Hithoel, a lake in Anduin). Hithlum is Sindarin in form, adapted from the Quenya name H\x{ed}sil\x{f3}m\x{eb} given by the Noldorin exiles (Quenya h\x{ed}si\x{eb} \x{2018}mist\x{2019}, cf. H\x{ed}sim\x{eb}, the name of the eleventh month of the year, The Lord of the Rings Appendix D). hoth\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}host, horde\x{2019} (nearly always in a bad sense) in Tol-in-Gaurhoth; also in Loss(h)oth, the Snowmen of Forochel (The Lord of the Rings Appendix A (I, iii)) and Glamhoth \x{2018}din-horde\x{2019}, a name for Orcs. hyarmen\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}south\x{2019} (Quenya) in Hyarmentir; Sindarin har-, harn, harad. i\x{e2}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}void, abyss\x{2019} in Moria. iant\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}bridge\x{2019} in Iant Iaur. i\x{e2}th\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}fence\x{2019} in Doriath. iaur\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}old\x{2019} in Iant Iaur; cf. the Elvish name of Bombadil, Iarwain. ilm-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}This stem appears in Ilmen, Ilmar\x{eb}, and also in Ilmarin\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}(\x{2018}mansion of the high airs\x{2019}, the dwelling of Manw\x{eb} and Varda upon Oioloss\x{eb}). il\x{fa}v\x{eb}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}the whole, the all\x{2019} in Il\x{fa}vatar. kal- (gal-)\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}This root, meaning \x{2018}shine\x{2019}, appears in Calacirya, Calaquendi, Tar-calion; galvorn, Gil-galad, Galadriel. The last two names have no connexion with Sindarin galadh \x{2018}tree\x{2019}, although in the case of Galadriel such a connexion was often made, and the name altered to Galadhriel. In the High-elven speech her name was Al(a)t\x{e1}riel, derived from alata \x{2018}radiance\x{2019} (Sindarin galad) and riel \x{2018}garlanded maiden\x{2019} (from a root rig- \x{2018}twine, wreathe\x{2019}): the whole meaning \x{2018}maiden crowned with a radiant garland\x{2019}, referring to her hair. calen (galen) \x{2018}green\x{2019} is etymologically \x{2018}bright\x{2019}, and derives from this root; see also aglar. k\x{e1}no\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}commander\x{2019}: this Quenya word is the origin of the second element in Fingon and Turgon. kel-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}go away\x{2019}, of water \x{2018}flow away, flow down\x{2019}, in Celon; from et-kele \x{2018}issue of water, spring\x{2019} was derived, with transposition of the consonants, Quenya ehtel\x{eb}, Sindarin eithel. kemen\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}earth\x{2019} in Kement\x{e1}ri; a Quenya word referring to the earth as a flat floor beneath menel, the heavens. khelek-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}ice\x{2019} in Helcar, Helcarax\x{eb} (Quenya helka \x{2018}icy, ice-cold\x{2019}). But in Helevorn the first element is Sindarin heledh \x{2018}glass\x{2019}, taken from Khuzdul kheled (cf. Kheled-z\x{e2}ram \x{2018}Mirrormere\x{2019}); Helevorn means \x{2018}black glass\x{2019} (cf. galvorn). khil-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}follow\x{2019} in Hildor, Hild\x{f3}rien, Eluchil. kir-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}cut, cleave\x{2019} in Calacirya, Cirth, Angerthas, Cirith (Ninniach, Thoronath). From the sense \x{2018}pass swiftly through\x{2019} was derived Quenya c\x{ed}rya \x{2018}sharp-prowed ship\x{2019} (cf. English cutter), and this meaning appears also in C\x{ed}rdan, Tar-Ciryatan, and no doubt in the name of Isildur\x{2019}s son Ciryon. lad\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}plain, valley\x{2019} in Dagorlad, Himlad; imlad a narrow valley with steep sides, in Imladris (cf. also Imlad Morgul in the Ephel D\x{fa}ath). laur\x{eb}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}gold\x{2019} (but of light and colour, not of the metal) in Laurelin; the Sindarin forms in Gl\x{f3}redhel, Glorfindel, Loeg Ningloron, L\x{f3}rindol, Rathl\x{f3}riel. lhach\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}leaping flame\x{2019} in Dagor Bragollach, and probably in Anglachel (the sword made by E\x{f6}l of meteoritic iron). lin (1)\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}pool, mere\x{2019} in Linaewen (which contains aew (Quenya aiw\x{eb}) \x{2018}small bird\x{2019}), Teiglin; cf. aelin. lin- (2)\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}This root, meaning \x{2018}sing, make a musical sound\x{2019}, occurs in Ainulindal\x{eb}, Laurelin, Lindar, Lindon, Ered Lindon, l\x{f3}melindi. lith\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}ash\x{2019} in Anfauglith, Dor-nu-Fauglith; also in Ered Lithui, the Ashen Mountains, forming the northern border of Mordor, and Lithlad \x{2018}Plain of Ashes\x{2019} at the feet of Ered Lithui. lok-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}bend, loop\x{2019} in Urul\x{f3}ki (Quenya (h)l\x{f3}k\x{eb} \x{2018}snake, serpent\x{2019}, Sindarin lh\x{fb}g). l\x{f3}m\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}echo\x{2019} in Dor-l\x{f3}min, Ered L\x{f3}min; related are Lammoth, Lanthir Lamath. l\x{f3}m\x{eb}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}dusk\x{2019} in L\x{f3}mion, l\x{f3}melindi; see d\x{fa}. lond\x{eb}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}land-locked haven\x{2019} in Alqualond\x{eb}; the Sindarin form lond (lonn) in Mithlond. los\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}snow\x{2019} in Oioloss\x{eb} (Quenya oio \x{2018}ever\x{2019} and loss\x{eb} \x{2018}snow, snow-white\x{2019}); Sindarin loss in Amon Uilos and Aeglos. loth\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}flower\x{2019} in Lothl\x{f3}rien, Nimloth; Quenya l\x{f3}t\x{eb} in Ninquel\x{f3}t\x{eb}, Vingil\x{f3}t\x{eb}. luin\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}blue\x{2019} in Ered Luin, Helluin, Luinil, Mindolluin. maeg\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}sharp, piercing\x{2019} (Quenya maika) in Maeglin. mal-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}gold\x{2019} in Malduin, Malinalda; also in mallorn, and in the Field of Cormallen, which means \x{2018}golden circle\x{2019} and was named from the culumalda trees that grew there (see cul-). man-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}good, blessed, unmarred\x{2019} in Aman, Manw\x{eb}; derivatives of Aman in Amandil, Araman,\x{da}manyar. mel-\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}love\x{2019} in Melian (from Melyanna \x{2018}dear gift\x{2019}); this stem is seen also in the Sindarin word mellon \x{2018}friend\x{2019} in the inscription on the West-gate of Moria. men\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}way\x{2019} in N\x{fa}men, Hyarmen, R\x{f3}men, Formen. menel\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}the heavens\x{2019} in Meneldil, Menelmacar, Meneltarma. mereth\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}feast\x{2019} in Mereth Aderthad; also in Merethrond, the Hall of Feasts in Minas Tirith. minas\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}tower\x{2019} in Ann\x{fa}minas, Minas Anor, Minas Tirith, etc. The same stem occurs in other words referring to isolated, prominent, things, e.g. Mindolluin, Mindon; probably related is Quenya minya \x{2018}first\x{2019} (cf. Tar-Minyatur, the name of Elros as first King of N\x{fa}menor). m\x{ee}r\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}jewel\x{2019} (Quenya m\x{ed}r\x{eb})in Elemm\x{ed}r\x{eb}, Gwaith-i-M\x{ed}rdain, M\x{ed}riel, Nauglam\x{ed}r, Tar-Atanamir. mith\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}grey\x{2019} in Mithlond, Mithrandir, Mithrim; also in Mitheithel, the river Hoarwell in Eriador. mor\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}dark\x{2019} in Mordor, Morgoth, Moria, Moriquendi, Mormegil, Morwen, etc. moth\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}dusk\x{2019} in Nan Elmoth. nan(d)\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}valley\x{2019} in Nan Dungortheb, Nan Elmoth, Nan Tathren. n\x{e1}r\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}fire\x{2019} in Narsil, Narya; present also in the original forms of Aegnor (Aikan\x{e1}ro \x{2018}Sharp Flame\x{2019} or \x{2018}Fell Fire\x{2019}) and F\x{eb}anor (F\x{eb}an\x{e1}ro \x{2018}Spirit of Fire\x{2019}). The Sindarin form was naur, as in Sammath Naur, the Chambers of Fire in Orodruin. Derived from the same ancient root (a)nar was the name of the Sun, Quenya Anar (also in An\x{e1}rion), Sindarin Anor (cf. Minas Anor, An\x{f3}rien). naug\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}dwarf\x{2019} in Naugrim; see also Nogrod in entry groth. Related is another Sindarin word for \x{2018}dwarf\x{2019}, nogoth, plural noegyth (Noegyth Nibin \x{2018}Petty-dwarves\x{2019}) and nogothrim. -(n)dil\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}is a very frequent ending of personal names, Amandil, E\x{e4}rendil (shortened E\x{e4}rnil), Elendil, Mardil, etc.; it implies \x{2018}devotion\x{2019}, \x{2018}disinterested love\x{2019} (see Mardil in entry bar). -(n)dur\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}in names such as E\x{e4}rendur (shortened E\x{e4}rnur) is similar in meaning to -(n)dil. neldor\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}beech\x{2019} in Neldoreth; but it seems that this was properly the name of H\x{ed}rilorn, the great beech-tree with three trunks (neld\x{eb} \x{2018}<<three|9k:0>>\x{2019} and orn). nen\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{2018}water\x{2019}, used of lakes, pools, and lesser rivers, in Nen Girith, Nenning, Nenuial, Nenya; Cuivi\x{e9}nen, Uinen; also in many names in The Lord of the Rings,as Nen Hithoel, Bruinen, Emyn Arnen, N\x{fa}rnen.
