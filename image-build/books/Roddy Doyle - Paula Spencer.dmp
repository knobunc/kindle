            '[02:00] Paula Spencer - Roddy Doyle.epub (index_split_009.html) - two in the morning',
            "She's to wait for a minivan outside Tara Street station. She's waiting with the junkies. God love them, and the kids in buggies, their mammies strung out or hurting \x{2013} Paula doesn't know. John Paul did his hurting out of sight. She never got to hit him with tough love.\x{2014}Are you clean now, John Paul?She asked him that the second time they met, a month after she'd answered the door and found him there, a young man in black jeans and a baseball cap. She thought he was looking for the milk money or something and she was going to put him right. But he moved and then she knew. Just the slightest move. He lifted his hand, and John Paul was in front of her. Back from the dead.\x{2014}Alright?Her son.And she'd wondered what he wanted. What he was going to take.\x{2014}Are you clean now, John Paul?That second meeting. He looked at her, across the table. He'd left the baseball cap at home or in his van. She could see him clearly. She watched him remembering the kitchen, putting himself back in it.He looked at her.\x{2014}Yeah, he said. \x{2014}I am. Are you?He knew. He could see the state of her. This was before she'd stopped drinking, this latest time. He was looking around him and it was coming back. He knew where he'd find the bottles.But he didn't sneer.He knew. She knows that now. But she didn't. He knew she was an addict. She didn't. She drank too much. She'd have admitted that. She was an alcoholic. She knew that too. But she didn't know what it meant. She drank too much. The way to deal with it was to drink less. She could give it up any time she wanted.John Paul looked straight at her. And she realised. It made her want to die or kill him \x{2013} he expected her to answer.About time. The minivan stops and the door is slid open. She's climbing in before she feels the heat and she realises that the van is nearly full.She gets in. There's not much room. Her leg is right against another woman's leg.\x{2014}Sorry.No answer.She looks around. She's the only white woman.Someone smiles. She catches herself, smiles back. She turns to face the front. She remembers \x{2013} she finds her seat belt and puts it on. She has to push and shove. She's like a cranky kid.\x{2014}Sorry.She knows. There'll be no crack on the way. And no singsong coming home. No one speaks. It takes about an hour and it stops being familiar after twenty minutes. Ranelagh, Milltown, Windy Arbour. She doesn't know them. Dundrum. She knows the name \x{2013} of course she does \x{2013} but she's never been here before. She looks up at the new bridge for the Luas, where the tram goes right over the road. It's like a different city.She doesn't feel uncomfortable but it's weird. She's the only white woman. And the only Irish woman \x{2013} she supposes. The only one born here. The driver's white but he says nothing. He mightn't be Irish either, although he looks it from where she's sitting \x{2013} his ears are Irish. He doesn't have the radio on, or any music playing. It's so quiet, it's mad. As if they have to stay quiet. As if they're coming up to a border crossing and they'll be caught if they make noise.She looks out at a shopping centre. She knows the name. Nutgrove. She's heard ads for it on the radio. She can't remember the jingle.They're going up a steep hill. She can feel it in the engine; she can hear it. It's like the city has ended and they've come right up to the mountains.She's the only white woman in the van. What would she think if she was outside and the van was passing her now? She doesn't know. She wouldn't make much of it. Just that. The van is full of women and only one of them is white.She's a failure. She shouldn't be in this van. She should be outside, looking at it going by. On her way home from work. Already home \x{2013} on her way out again. Irishwomen don't do this work. Only Paula.That's not true. There's plenty do what she does. Going to work is never failure. Earning the money for her son's computer isn't failure. The money comes from nowhere else.Ten years ago there wouldn't have been one black woman on this bus \x{2013} less than ten years. It would have been Paula and women like Paula. Same age, from the same area, same kids. Where are those women now? Carmel used to do cleaning and now she's buying flats in Bulgaria.Enough.She's grand. She knows how far she's come. She's not ashamed of work.They must be getting near. There are Garda at all the corners and gangs of kids, all walking in the same direction.But it's true. She's been left behind. She knows that. But she's always known it. She was never in front. Except when she first met Charlo and for a while after that. She thought she was winning then. Because she was with Charlo and people got out of his way. He never looked behind him. He never cared what others saw or thought \x{2013} including her, but she didn't know that then. Anyway, that was the time she thought she was ahead of the pack. And, very quickly, she knew it wasn't like that.She sits up.They're going through a gate. They're in the park. She can't hear any music.This is better. It's honest. She puts in the hours. She gets paid.Do women her age go backpacking? Go to Australia and that other place \x{2013} Singapore? Do they go to bed with men whose names they don't want or need to know?It's looking like serious rain out there. The mountains and trees make the clouds look nearer.Singapore. My arse.Honesty. That's what she owns now. She thinks.\x{2014}Are you clean now, John Paul? she'd asked him.\x{2014}Yeah, he'd said. \x{2014}I am. Are you?\x{2014}No.He'd nodded.There were parts of his father sitting there in front of her. The eyes, the forehead, the length of the fingers resting on the table, and the knuckles. But it wasn't Charlo who'd nodded. There was no sneer or triumph. A good man had nodded back at Paula.Her son.She saw him to the door. She went back to the kitchen and she drank a bottle of vodka.The man stops the van. They're in among other vans and buses, on the grass. It'll be desperate later if it rains, when they're going home. They'll be up their arses in muck.\x{2014}Right, says the driver.He's Irish alright. She was right about his ears.He turns around.\x{2014}Ladies. Out you get.He thinks he's great. Just now \x{2013} the power.\x{2014}Will you be bringing us back? says Paula.\x{2014}Haven't a clue, love.He's a rat-faced fella, yellowy teeth. There's nothing on his face she'd like to know.\x{2014}You might have to walk home, love, he says.\x{2014}Fine, she says. \x{2014}I like a nice walk.She finds the handle. She opens the door, slides it back. She climbs out. She's stiff. It's cold. The ground is soft and wet. She can feel it in her feet.She puts on her jacket \x{2013} Jack's jacket. It's a good warm one, black, for school. He never wears it, unless she stands at the door and tells him to. Anyway, there was nothing else. She's here because she needs a coat of her own. And Jack's computer. It's grand. There's no crest on it or anything. It isn't a school jacket.She can hear the music now. That bass sound kids seem to love. She can feel it coming from the ground. She didn't know what bass was in her day. There was a bass player in every band but it didn't seem to matter. It wasn't what she ever heard. Which one of the Beatles played the bass? She still doesn't know.The African women get out after her. They stand behind her. She's the leader. She doesn't want that but she doesn't want to move too soon, to look as if she's trying to get away. She's stuck. She smiles at two women. They smile back.\x{2014}Cold.They smile.What's it like for them? Are yis not freezing? It's a reasonable question. What made you come here? But questions like that must piss them off. There are colder places than Ireland. It's Marlay Park, not fuckin' Siberia.They're not like American black women. The ones you see on the telly and in films. They're blacker; their bodies are a different shape. They're rounder women, bursting with strength. They like wigs, some of them, or bits of wigs \x{2013} extensions. Going to work with purple hair. These girls have style.They're young. She's the oul' one again.\x{2014}Girls, girls. This way.Another man. He's waving at them. He's wrapped for worse weather than this. He's Scott of the fuckin' Antarctic. Or the Irish one, the explorer in the Guinness ad, who came back from his adventures and ran a pub. He has a black bag beside him. It's full \x{2013} she can see that.It's full of more black bags. He's handing out the bags. He'll be paid more than Paula. She'd bet on it. He dips in and gives her two rolls \x{2013} twenty serious, heavy-duty bags. She holds a roll in each hand. Plastic bags always feel warm.He lets go of his own bag and digs into his pockets. He takes out some plastic-covered cards. Laminated \x{2013} that's the word. He holds out his hands to the women. The cards hang from his fingers. Paula takes one. WHITE STRIPES \x{2013} STAFF. It's on a thin rope that goes around your neck. She hopes she gets to keep it. She'll leave it on the kitchen table. That'll show them. It'll give them something to be proud of, or envious. Or a bit of a laugh \x{2013} their groovy ma.Scott of the Bags points at a path that goes into the woods.\x{2014}Down there, girls. That's right. Happy hunting.Jesus Christ, it's a fairy tale for big people. She's going to get lost in the woods. She's still ahead of the Africans. She goes slowly enough but they won't pass her out. She's the first one into the trees.She can hear the music now. There's no sign of a house made of gingerbread.Jack always hated that story. He'd take the book from her and turn the pages till he got to Snow White. Then he'd put the book back into her hands.\x{2014}Read it.On the nights when she could read.Everything seems well organised. There are big lights, like you'd get at a roadworks, for later when it's dark. But they're lit already. It's already dark. There are barriers at the gaps in the trees, where people might stray and get lost. There are men in fat jackets at every corner and swerve.It's not very busy. They're the only ones on the path. She hopes it isn't going to be a disaster, that no one will turn up. There'd be nothing to clean up and she'd still get paid. But she wants the experience. She wants to tell Jack all about it. And Carmel and Denise.And Leanne.The path is wider now. There's a car behind them. They stand aside. Is this the band on their way to the stage? It goes by slowly and it's only a Ford or something, an ordinary car. Being driven by one of the men in the fat jackets.The path widens again and they're in front of a field. There's a fence all around it. She can tell. It wasn't there a few days ago. There are four straight lines, steel barriers, like you'd get at a football match for controlling the flow of people. Paula chooses one line and walks down it. The other women are right behind her. She's Mother fuckin' Goose.A man looks at her staff card. He steps aside.\x{2014}Cold enough for you, love? he says.\x{2014}Ah, stop.She smiles.\x{2014}What happened the summer? she says.\x{2014}What bleedin' summer?She walks on.It's a woman this time, waiting for her. She's staring at Paula's card. She looks at Paula's black bags.\x{2014}Over.She points. She's white but she isn't Irish. She's European or something. One of Carmel's Bulgarians, maybe. She's young. Good-looking but angry \x{2013} skinny because of it.\x{2014}East, she says, still pointing.That proves she isn't Irish. Just as well she's pointing. Paula wouldn't have a clue. Jack told her once, out in the back garden. One of the times she'd decided to make a proper garden out of it. South-facing, it said on the packet of seeds.\x{2014}Jesus, Jack, where's the south?And he knew. He pointed.\x{2014}How do you know?\x{2014}Well, he said. \x{2014}The sea's that way and \x{2014}\x{2014}How do you know?\x{2014}It just is. So that means the south's behind us.He pointed his thumb over his shoulder.\x{2014}But how do you know? she said.She didn't doubt him. She knew he was right.\x{2014}Geography, he said. \x{2014}It's easy.She thought it was great. She watched Jack go to the back door, heading north. She could hear the Dart \x{2013} and that was west. If she wanted a drink she'd have to head south. She couldn't remember the last time she'd learnt something. Carmel's house was that way, west. America was over the wall, a good long way past Carmel's. It all made sense. She was in the world, surrounded by it.She never got round to planting the seeds. They're still in their packet, in the press, behind where she puts the sugar bag. She might plant them next year, in the spring.The woman stops pointing.\x{2014}Bring the bags. To here.Paula is on her own, heading east. There's no one following her now. The field is nearly empty. It would be hard to hide if she wanted to. The stage is huge. She's never seen anything like it. It's like something from a space film. There's no one on it. It's too early for the White Stripes. The crowd is small. It's a mixture of people. Some very young kids with their fathers or mothers \x{2013} no parents together that Paula can see. Some of them are sitting on big inflatable chairs and sofas. A great idea. They must have bought them somewhere. Now she sees, way over at the end of the field, a hill of inflatable furniture. There's always someone with the right idea, there before anyone else. How do they do it? How do they know? Paula hasn't a clue.The music is loud and fuckin' terrible but there's no one up on the stage yet.But there is.She picks up a cup, one of those big waxy paper ones with the plastic lid, for Coke and that. It's going to be dirty work. They should have given her gloves or something. Her hands are sticky already. Thank God it's too cold for the wasps. She picks up the cup and she hears the voice the same time as she sees the young one on the stage. She's singing about someone sucking on her tits and wanting to come \x{2013} something like that, anyway. There's no band, just the young one. And she's not that young either. Paula can see that now on the big screen beside the stage. She's in silver hot pants, and wandering around the stage, like a little animal in a very big cage. She'd be sexy or interesting on the telly but, God love her, she must be fuckin' freezing up there. Whoever she is. She's climbing up the frame at the side of the stage. Anything to stay warm. Paula looks at the parents with their kids. No one's paying much attention to the young one. Imagine being like that and no one cares.Paula picks up a crisp bag. A cigarette butt \x{2013} she puts her hand down for it but she stops herself. She'll leave the butts. She'll never fill the bag if she starts picking up butts. Another cup. It's empty but she smells the lager. She drops it into the bag. The smell is on her hands. Around her nose and face. The field is full of plastic cups. She picks up another.Leanne's there when she gets home. Paula's freezing. She stinks. She's expecting Jack. And it's Leanne.It's grand.She sits down.The telly's on, the sound's down. MTV or something like it. Black ones shaking their arses, fellas with medallions.\x{2014}Turn it off, love, will you. I've had my fill of that shite.\x{2014}What?She hears the click. She sees the screen go dead. Leanne did what she was asked. She's not gunning for a fight. She's been sitting and probably worrying. Where was her mother at this hour?Cleaning the fuckin' mountains.\x{2014}Come into the kitchen with me, Leanne. I'm frozen. I need a cup of tea.\x{2014}Where were you?\x{2014}At a gig.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}A job, she says. \x{2014}Come on. I must have walked miles today, and I went fuckin' nowhere.She makes it; she stands up. Her ears are buzzing. The inner ears, the ones she remembers learning about in school, deep inside her head.\x{2014}Where were you?\x{2014}Marlay Park.\x{2014}Where's that?Leanne follows her out.\x{2014}Up the mountains, says Paula. \x{2014}Miles away; Jesus.She looks at the clock in the kitchen. It's <<two in the morning|5>>.She tells Leanne about her day.\x{2014}They made you clean it up?\x{2014}No one made me do anything, love. It was a job.\x{2014}God though.\x{2014}It's grand.She's getting annoyed. What's wrong with cleaning? Even cleaning a field. But she stops herself. She won't let herself bark. This is good. This is nice.\x{2014}I got paid for it, she says. \x{2014}And I got in for nothing.\x{2014}I suppose, says Leanne.\x{2014}And I have to say. They were brilliant.\x{2014}Who were?\x{2014}The White Stripes.\x{2014}Don't know them.\x{2014}Jack does.\x{2014}What sort of stuff do they do?\x{2014}I don't know what you'd call it, she says.She watches Leanne making the tea for her. The big moves, the energy, even when she's just stirring the cup. There's nothing too wrong with that young one. She'll think that for a while. She smells her hands. They're grand. The drink is off them.It had reminded her of the old stuff. Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Rory Gallagher. Good rock from the 70s. Her time. And Charlo's time.\x{2014}But, God, it was brilliant. I don't think you'd have liked it though.\x{2014}Why wouldn't I of?\x{2014}They were hard.They laugh.\x{2014}You're fuckin' mental, says Leanne.\x{2014}You've never liked hard music, says Paula.\x{2014}Some.\x{2014}You used to hate it when I danced around here, when a good one came on the radio.\x{2014}That wasn't the music, says Leanne.\x{2014}What was it then?\x{2014}I don't know.She does know. And so does Paula. It was the frenzy, the panic, the big fuckin' roar \x{2013} HELP! A woman stopping madness by meeting it halfway. Leanne saw it. Paula dragged her around the kitchen. You're hurting me; it hurts.Leanne brings the tea over to Paula.\x{2014}It was embarrassing, she says.And that's fair enough, a bit like Jack.\x{2014}An oul' one dancing.\x{2014}Jesus, Leanne. I wasn't even forty.She works it out, does her subtraction.\x{2014}About thirty-three, she says. \x{2014}I was thirty-three. Jesus, that's depressing.\x{2014}The tea will help, says Leanne, the wagon.She sits down, beside Paula.\x{2014}Thanks for this, says Paula.She picks up the cup.\x{2014}Were you out?\x{2014}Yeah, says Leanne. \x{2014}Not really. Just for a bit.They don't look at each other.\x{2014}Were they good-looking? says Leanne.\x{2014}Who?Now they can look at each other. They've been at this for years.\x{2014}The White Stripes. Who else?\x{2014}There's only the two of them, says Paula.\x{2014}Are they good-looking?\x{2014}One of them's a girl.\x{2014}Is he good-looking?Paula tries to smell the air between them. But her nose is still full of the mountains. Their faces are close. She can't smell anything.Postpone it. It's late.\x{2014}They're brother and sister, she says.\x{2014}For fuck sake, Ma. Was he good-looking?\x{2014}No, he wasn't. Strictly speaking.\x{2014}Ah, says Leanne. \x{2014}One of those ones.\x{2014}He was just brilliant.\x{2014}And you'd let him have you up against a barbed-wire fence.\x{2014}Ah, Leanne, says Paula.\x{2014}Well, you would. Admit it.\x{2014}Yeah. I would.They laugh.Postpone it.\x{2014}And there was you, says Leanne. \x{2014}Old enough to be his mother.Paula nods.\x{2014}I'm old enough to be most men's mother.\x{2014}I wouldn't let that stop me, says Leanne.She looks at Leanne.The signs are there, the eyes, the skin. She wants to touch Leanne's face. The warmth, and the smoothness she remembers. She wants to feel Leanne.Postpone it.\x{2014}Where were you yourself? she says.She yawns. She doesn't need to. She doesn't even want to.\x{2014}Nowhere, says Leanne.\x{2014}Is that the name of a new pub or something?\x{2014}Ha ha.\x{2014}Leanne.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}I'm worried about you.She wants to run. She wants to turn the table over. To do it before Leanne does.Leanne's still there, still close. She hasn't moved.\x{2014}I've been \x{2014}Paula starts again.\x{2014}I've been a bit worried.No explosion. But nothing else.Leanne is silent, still.How long have they been like this? Leanne sits still but, actually, she's jumping, frantic. She's out of her seat although she's sitting there.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula. \x{2014}So. I've said it. So. Leanne?\x{2014}I know.\x{2014}I'm worried.\x{2014}I know. I heard you. You're worried.She's not looking at Paula.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula.That's all. It's all she can say. She needs Leanne.\x{2014}What about? says Leanne.\x{2014}Well, says Paula. \x{2014}It's \x{2014}Jesus.It's too much.She's losing control. She knows she's shaking. She's dying for a drink. She wants to laugh. She'll tell Leanne \x{2013} the happy ending. Later.She holds the cup with both hands. Something to do; the heat is real.\x{2014}I know you might think I'm a hypocrite or something.Where did that come from?\x{2014}I'd understand it if you do.She puts the cup to her lips.\x{2014}Lovely.That gets nothing.She sips again. She feels the tea. She feels it crawl across her tongue.Too much sugar.\x{2014}I'm an alcoholic, Leanne.Leanne's eyes slide off her.\x{2014}I know, she says.\x{2014}I know you do, love. You've always known. But I've never told you and I should've.She doesn't cry; she doesn't want \x{2013} she doesn't need to.\x{2014}It doesn't matter, says Leanne.\x{2014}It does. But, anyway \x{2014}\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Well, she says. \x{2014}Leanne. Are you?\x{2014}What?\x{2014}An alcoholic.\x{2014}What? Are you mad?She's stiff-solid now, in front of Paula.\x{2014}I am not.Still there, furious \x{2013} terrified.\x{2014}Good, says Paula.Leanne says nothing. She doesn't move.\x{2014}So, says Paula.She sips again.\x{2014}It's my imagination.She doesn't want to accuse Leanne. She already has.\x{2014}Leanne?\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Am I imagining it?\x{2014}Imagine what you like.\x{2014}I've been there, Leanne. I \x{2014}\x{2014}I've been there, Le-annnne \x{2014}She fires it back, and it hits. They'd laugh if they saw it on telly.\x{2014}Sorry, says Paula.Leanne's still there.\x{2014}Can I ask you something, Leanne?Another bad line \x{2013} they're all bad.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}How \x{2014}She goes for the cup \x{2013} she stops.\x{2014}How do you feel when you wake up in the mornings? Most mornings?Leanne cocks her head. It's not good. She's acting.She speaks.\x{2014}Remember when I woke up once and you were beside me and you were asleep? And your face was stuck to my pillow with your vomit. Do you remember that?Paula nods.\x{2014}Yes, I do.\x{2014}Do you? Great. Because I don't feel nearly as bad as that when I wake up in \x{2013} the mornings. I feel fuckin' great, actually.Leanne moves. Every part of her jumps, like a puppet whose strings have been tapped. She raises her hand.And Paula does too, to her face, quickly.She tries to stop.She puts her hands down.\x{2014}Why did you do that? says Leanne.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Did you think I was going to hit you or something?\x{2014}No.\x{2014}You did.She raises her hand, fast \x{2014}It doesn't happen. Leanne doesn't hit her.Paula takes her hand from her face.Leanne stands up. Paula can hear her breathe.You're your father's daughter. She doesn't say it.She has to look. It's gone if she doesn't.She looks up at Leanne. Leanne is looking across at the back door, that direction.But she looks at Paula now. She looks down at her. Her face is blotched. Her eyes are dirty.She was never beautiful. Paula can't help thinking that.She looks at Leanne. She sees the mouth.\x{2014}You thought I was going to hit you.\x{2014}It was just a reaction. When you raised your hand \x{2014}\x{2014}Like this?The fingers fly past Paula's eyes.\x{2014}Leanne. Stop.\x{2014}What? This?The fingernail stings her nose. She's cut \x{2013} she must be.Paula stands \x{2013} she's not going to be caught.\x{2014}What are you doing?Leanne doesn't answer.\x{2014}What gives you the right to do that?\x{2014}What gives you the right?\x{2014}I didn't hit you.\x{2014}Not now.\x{2014}I never hit you.Leanne doesn't answer.\x{2014}I never hit you. When did I ever hit you?\x{2014}He did.\x{2014}He hit us all.\x{2014}Yeah well, you fuckin' married him.Paula's fault.\x{2014}Ah, for God's sake, she says. \x{2014}What's this got to do with anything?\x{2014}And you did.\x{2014}What? Hit you?Leanne nods. Like a headbutt. Her bottom lip is in her teeth.\x{2014}When did I?\x{2014}When you were drunk.She has her; there's no answer.\x{2014}You've no fuckin' right to lecture me, says Leanne.\x{2014}I know.\x{2014}You've no right.\x{2014}I know.\x{2014}Just, fuck off.Why should she listen to that? When you were drunk. Why should she have to listen?If one of them would cry now \x{2014}\x{2014}Is Jack upstairs?\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Jack. I don't want him to hear this.\x{2014}Who fuckin' started it? Accusing me. Of being like you. You.\x{2014}Stop, Leanne.\x{2014}'Cos Jack will hear? Poor Jack. Jack, Jack, it's always fuckin' Jack!Leanne loves Jack. She always looked after him for Paula. His little mammy. Paula always called her that and she'd loved it.Leanne's hands are rolling over each other. Her nails are digging into skin.\x{2014}What do you know about me? she says. \x{2014}What do you fuckin' care?\x{2014}You know I \x{2014}\x{2014}I know nothing. Except that you haven't a fuckin' clue. I know that much. And it's more than you fuckin' know. And then you want to tell me I'm an alcoholic?\x{2014}And that gives you the right to hit me?\x{2014}I'm an alcoholic? Join the fuckin' club. Have a drink, Leanne.\x{2014}I never did that, says Paula.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}I never made you drink with me.\x{2014}Well, take a bow. Saint Paula of the alcos. She never made us drink with her.\x{2014}Ah, shut up, Leanne.She could kill the little bitch. Paula's proud of how far she's come. But Leanne is mocking her and it seems so stupid. I never made her drink with me. Come up and get your medal. She wants to drink \x{2013} her head is hopping. She'd break the bottle over Leanne's head. And the little cunt drones on.\x{2014}She made us go to school hungry, she made us wear clothes so that other kids threw twopences at us.\x{2014}Shut up.\x{2014}She made people move away from us when we sat down in the back of the church because we were late. For my Holy Communion. Because she couldn't get up on time, even though I tried to get you up and even brought you up a cup of tea and got a stain on my dress because of it.Leanne is giving it all to her. And Paula just wants to slap her. What about now? she wants to yell. What about now? I'm sick of feeling guilty.Leanne's still at it. Shifting her weight from foot to foot. It's only her hips are moving. And her mouth.Paula's not listening. Get over it! she wants to yell. Grow up and get out of my house. If it's all that fuckin' bad. Get the fuck out, so I don't have to face you every day and feel guilty all over again.She knows what her life has been like and what she's had to do to stay alive. And this bitch is kicking away at it, with her stampy little feet.She's gone. She's not even in the kitchen.Paula's alone.It's <<three in the morning|5>>. Three minutes after. Has Leanne been yelling at her for an hour? It's not impossible.I never made you drink with me.Pathetic. If that's all she could use to defend herself. When she finally had the chance to take her punishment and listen, then admit and ask forgiveness; all the conversations she's dreamed about and planned. But all she could say was that. I never.So.What's the point?She won't sit down.It's all so fuckin' dreadful. She doesn't know what to do. Can she even go to bed? The charge of a drink, the sprint to her head and pain \x{2013} she'd love it. With ice from the freezer. She'd do it in style. She can taste it \x{2013} she doesn't need to remember. Then she'd lie down.But there's nothing in the house. She remembers throwing out the last bottle. Actually, she just dropped it over the back wall. Into someone's garden. It used to be Kellys' but there are other people there now. She doesn't know who. She hasn't seen them. Leanne probably has a bottle hidden. There's a charming thought. Two hours ago she'd have been upset. Now she wants the bottle. They can fight for it and reconcile, in the spill and broken glass.She's not going to drink. She knows. Even if she found a bottle she'd forgotten about or if Leanne came down with a bottle of Smirnoff and threw the cap in the corner, she wouldn't drink. Not even to win back Leanne.Win her back? She never had her. She gave her away years ago. She threw Leanne away.It's one of the interesting discoveries. Sentimentality doesn't have to be soft. She threw Leanne away. An old alco's sentimental shite. She threw Leanne nowhere. She held her tight and slobbered all over her. Your mammy loves you SOOOOOO much.But it's dreadful. That's rock solid honest. It's fuckin' dreadful. There's no sleeping on this. It's just dreadful.So why does she feel so good?She goes up to bed. She leaves the White Stripes staff card on the table.
She's in the cafe.The coat will have to wait. Women like Paula don't wear real coats any more. Working-class women. They wear anoraks, snorkel jackets, padded shiny sexless things. That's why she can get away with wearing Jack's. No one knows. Not even Jack. Especially not Jack.Where would she wear a good coat? She doesn't go out anywhere. She doesn't go to Mass. She doesn't go to the pictures. She's never been in a theatre. Work and the shops \x{2013} that's it. Her sisters have given up on her. Her last text from Carmel was ages ago and it wasn't a party invitation. She was offering Paula a chicken. Spare chkn. Wnt? Paula didn't answer.Shve it up yr arse.She'll get the coat when Christmas is out of the way. A long one with a big collar. Soft \x{2013} cashmere, or something like that. A coat that Melanie Griffith would wear, letting it slide off her shoulders to the rug, showing she's wearing nothing underneath. What film was that in? She doesn't know but she can see the coat. She can see Melanie Griffith's shoulders. She'd kiss them.Where's Melanie Griffith these days? Paula always liked her.The vegetable place across the way didn't last long. It's all closed up again. It'll be someone else's bright idea in a month or two.She's here. But she doesn't remember getting here.That's too dramatic. She remembers deciding to come here. It's not like she woke up in the place. She was over in the supermarket and she decided she'd come here on her way home. Because she was after buying a little notebook, and a biro. Because she wanted to make a list of the things she'd need for Christmas. Different lists. The food she'd need, presents, things to be done. She'd start on the lists and look out the window. So it's not as if she's losing her mind or anything. Going mad. She's been daydreaming. And that's nothing new.She was miles away when she noticed the girl at the counter. The nice Italian young one. Smiling at her.There's nothing wrong.There's a mad one she sees on the Dart some nights. She wears colours that hurt Paula's eyes. Pink and orange DayGlo. Her eye shadow is always a half-inch to the left or right of her eyes. It's always red or purple. She wears stripy, odd socks. Pink ear-muffs, all year. And she whispers along to her Walkman. Paula sat near enough to hear her once. WE WILL BE TRUE TO THEE TILL DEATH. She was singing a fuckin' hymn. She must be well into her thirties. Listening to hymns on her pink Walkman. She's mad and she doesn't know it. She doesn't see what Paula and the others see.Is Paula like that? Like, today. She's the woman they see every couple of days. The women in the supermarket, the girl here, people along the way. The woman Paula looked at in the bathroom mirror before she left \x{2013} is that who they see too? Or do they see a mad one? The woman with the SuperValu bags. She's not wearing eye shadow or pink ear-muffs. If she had a Walkman she'd listen to Van Morrison or Deep Purple. Or the White Stripes.She's tired.She has the notebook on the table. She has her new pen. Jesus, it's some sort of sparkly thing. She thought it was just a biro when she bought it. But it's a madwoman's biro. She draws a line \x{2013} pink.She might as well use it. She has nothing else.She's waiting on her coffee.She hasn't seen the pizza fella since, the one she took a shine to in the summer. He seems to be gone. And she can't ask. Not today anyway, after what's just happened.She was just suddenly there. Awake \x{2013} she hadn't a clue. With a bag in each hand, standing at the counter.She remembers being in the supermarket, at the till. She thinks she remembers taking things out of her basket. The feel of the chicken, cold from the fridge. Afraid her fingers would burst the plastic covering. She thinks that was today. But she thinks that every time she picks up a chicken in a supermarket. She's always afraid the blood will come through the plastic. She can feel the cold in the fingers of her left hand, picking it out of the basket.And then she was here. The woman behind the counter was smiling at her \x{2013} the usual way. Waiting for Paula to ask for her coffee and maybe a cake. The usual.What did she look like? What do they see when they look at her?She mutters to herself a bit at home, in the kitchen, wandering around.Enough. She's grand.She opens the notebook. She writes the names down the page. With her madwoman's pen. She can hardly read the pink ink. She definitely needs her eyes tested. Carmel and Denise need glasses for reading.She writes the names. Jack, Nicola, Leanne.She stops.She tears out the page. The page says it all, the order she's written the names in \x{2013} Jack, Nicola, Leanne. She puts the page in her jacket pocket.She'll get a handbag too, when she's buying the coat. She might as well, go the whole hog. She heard a woman this morning, on Marian Finnucane. I just love a nice bag, Marian. I'm addicted to them. Fuckin' eejit. Spending thousands on handbags.She starts again. The grandkids' names. John Paul's first. Then Nicola's two. Then Jack \x{2013} he's still a kid. Then Leanne. Nicola. John Paul. Carmel. Denise. Nieces, nephews. The big, happy family. She can't remember them all. Denise's second lad. The one who did well in his Leaving. All sorts of honours. What's his bloody name? She knew it yesterday. Is that why she's suddenly keen on lists, because it's all slipping away?She just wants to be organised. She wants to know what she has to do. How far she can get with the money she'll have.Here's the coffee.Kieran.The girl puts it on the table, and the little jug of milk.\x{2014}Thanks very much.\x{2014}Are welcome.Kieran.She writes it down. It's a big list. It's taken two pages. And now she remembers, she left out two. Tony. That's Nicola's fella. And John Paul's partner. No-Arse.The girl has a name and it's Carol. Except she calls herself Star. It's tattooed on the knuckles of her right hand. She did it herself. Paula will never need reading glasses to see those letters.Are reading glasses expensive? Depends on the glasses. She supposes. She'll ask Carmel. She'll text her. Glses exps? She'll get the reply. Spare pr. Wnt?Thank God for selection boxes. That's what most of these kids will be getting. And thank God for Rita Kavanagh, three doors up from her. It's 23 November and Rita has been up to Newry twice already, doing her Christmas shopping. Paula met Rita getting out of her car last week and the car was stuffed with bags, mostly filled with selection boxes. The whole back of the car was full of chocolate.\x{2014}I'm after saving a fortune, Paula, she told her. \x{2014} It's a great day out. You should come with us. There's a convoy of us going up to Enniskillen next week. Jesus, the crack.Paula's never been to the North. She suggested it to Jack last summer, a day in the train to Belfast. A big breakfast on the train, shopping for a few hours, maybe that tour of the black spots she heard about on the radio, and back to Dublin on the train. She'd have liked that, the day out with Jack, and the walk home through the estate with the Belfast shopping bags. But he wouldn't go. She didn't ask Nicola, because Nicola would have spent too much. And she never thought of asking Leanne.That's a lie. She didn't want a long day with Leanne. Especially the journey home. Jesus, Ma, you'd need a drink after all that walking around.She isn't going to Enniskillen. But Rita has promised to get her as much stuff as she wants.\x{2014}We're being robbed down here, Paula. And I'll tell you another nice thing about up there. The girls in all the shops and cafes and that. They're Irish. It's great. They know what you're talking about.Those girls must be great if they know what Rita Kavanagh is talking about. Five minutes in the car with Rita would drive Paula fuckin' demented. She'd be writing on the car window with her mad one's pen. Let Me Out! But Rita's going to get her all the selection boxes.She puts lines through the grown-up nieces and nephews. It'd be mad getting them anything. Carmel and Denise won't be getting anything for her older ones. Just Jack. Maybe Leanne.She hates Christmas. She always has \x{2013} or since she was a few years married and she realised she was poor and she was always going to be. She hadn't liked it much before then either. It always seemed a bit much for just one day. It was always a bit of a strain. She remembers going through the supermarket with a trolley full of six-packs and mixers and the rest. She couldn't make the trolley go straight. Jack was in the carrier part. She was afraid the whole thing was going to topple over. Leanne was pulling on the other side of it, asking for every biscuit and family pack they passed. And she actually \x{2013} did she? \x{2013} she smacked Leanne, until she let go of the trolley. She tried to smile through the whole thing, piling the stuff onto the conveyor. She threw a few bars of chocolate onto the pile, to make it look more normal, the expensive black chocolate kids don't even like, and Jack was trying to climb out and Leanne was snuffling and refusing to look at her. A chicken instead of a turkey and four bottles of vodka on the table. That was Christmas.There were good ones too. But they were always a surprise.Do Carmel and Denise know about Leanne?Carmel knows everything. Denise knows nothing. They're a strange pair.She told them about John Paul. It was hard to start but she doesn't think she was too embarrassed or ashamed. Heroin was so foreign. It had nothing to do with her. She'd thought that then. He'd walked into the house and he'd walked straight back out with the television. And that was how she'd started to tell Carmel and Denise. It was so mad. Her own son. He was only sixteen. She hadn't seen him in weeks. She opened the door, he pushed right past her. Don't say Hello or anything. She watched him walk down the path, down the street. She didn't follow. As for the telly, she couldn't have cared less. It was only later, when Jack wanted to watch his cartoons, she realised what a pain in the neck not having a telly was.\x{2014}He's a heroin addict.They'd probably known already. A lot of families had one \x{2013} more than one. It was like an alien invasion. Nothing to do with them, but coming up the path. Junkies even look a bit like aliens. Like someone made a human but left out something \x{2013} blood, colouring, something vital. It was devastating but safe. An accident. Nothing to do with her.She looks at the coffee. She puts down the pink pen. She picks up the cup. She tastes the coffee. She hears the little voice inside her \x{2013} this is me drinking a nice cup of coffee. She puts the cup down \x{2013} this is me putting the cup down. She picks up the pink pen. She'll show it to Leanne when she gets home. Will you look what I bought today by accident.She hasn't spoken a real word to Leanne in weeks.Leanne hasn't spoken to her.She picks up the menu. She has to hold it quite close to her eyes. There's a bit in small print at the bottom that she can't read at all, about vegetarians. It's in that slanting italic print. Even looking at it \x{2013} it seems to shimmer \x{2013} it makes her feel a bit sick.The list.She feels something coming. Something big and bad. She's dragging it to her.The list.She hasn't a clue what to get Leanne. Does Leanne still like music? She has no idea. Barbie was always a safe bet in the old days. Leanne and Nicola's room was full of Barbies, all of them sitting up and staring at Paula whenever she went into the room. She could still get her one, for the laugh. Melt the ice. Boozer Barbie \x{2013} little bottles, one little shoe with a broken heel. Smashed-Ankle Barbie. The little medical card, the little tracksuit.That's what's waiting for Paula at home. Smashed-Ankle Barbie herself. Leanne on the couch, in a dirty tracksuit, firing bullets at the telly with the remote control. She's been there for three weeks. It's no wonder Paula's going mad. Not one friend has come near Leanne. It's as if there's never been a previous life. Even work \x{2013} Paula doesn't know if Leanne's job will be waiting for her when her foot is mended. She's afraid to ask too often.Leanne called Paula. She was crying, not able to make proper words. She was in hospital, or on her way \x{2013} something.\x{2014}What hospital, Leanne?She didn't know; she wouldn't tell her.\x{2014}What hospital, love? I'll come and get you.Leanne just cried. Paula was in the hall now, putting on her jacket, looking for the money to get her a taxi \x{2013} where? \x{2013} and back. She had enough. She'd been paid the day before.\x{2014}What hospital, Leanne?\x{2014}I'm sohhh-ry.Paula tried to hear beyond Leanne's tears and gasps. A friend's voice, an ambulance fella \x{2013} a word or hint that might tell her where to go. She ran out of the house. She headed for the main road. It was raining. She couldn't zip up the jacket and keep the phone to her ear.\x{2014}Mammy?\x{2014}Yes, love?\x{2014}Ma?\x{2014}I'm here, Leanne.\x{2014}Where?\x{2014}Coming to get you, don't worry. Where are you?Eventually \x{2013} Jesus \x{2013} she got the name out of Leanne and she told her she'd be there in a minute. She turned off the phone and looked out for a taxi. She saw one coming. She put up her hand. The taxi slowed and did a U-turn.\x{2014}Where to, love?\x{2014}Beaumont.\x{2014}The hossy?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Are you alright?\x{2014}I'm grand, yeah. It's my daughter.She was there quickly. The taxi driver was nice. He talked about his own kids and the dashes to hospital.\x{2014}I went to Temple Street twice in the one day. With two different children.\x{2014}God.\x{2014}I had a season ticket for that place.\x{2014}What was wrong with them?She could tell that he loved his kids.\x{2014}Well, the eldest gashed his leg on a nail. That was in the morning. And the other lad started vomiting and he wouldn't stop. During the meningitis scare; are you with me? Straight back in.\x{2014}Was he alright?\x{2014}Ah, he was grand. They kept him in for the night just. As a precautionary measure. Put him on a drip. That's a horrible thing to see.She texted Leanne. On way.She was alone when Paula got there. She was calmer, but strange and far away. The young one who had wanted her mammy was gone. Paula never really found out what had happened. She sat with her. She held her hand. Leanne's hard, cracked hand. She watched women alone. She tried to smile at them. She watched men guard their women. She saw arms around shoulders. But who was she to judge? What did she know? An arm around her shoulders would have been nice. The pizza man's arm. Charlo's arm.She sat all night while Leanne slept, and woke, and slept. It was a long time since Paula had been one of the women alone or John Paul had been one of the unconscious young lads. But the place was still the same. A war zone \x{2013} worse now, when she was sober. She'd been hearing people on the radio, on Joe Duffy, giving out about people having to lie on trolleys for days because there were no beds. Now she saw it when she went to the toilet. All along the corridor, women, old men, people who might have been injured at work earlier that day, the day before, on trolleys. In rows, like a weird queue for the bus. There was a smell of smoke in the jacks, dirty toilet paper on the floor.She took Leanne home three days after, in another taxi. She helped her up to her room and she helped her down again. She brought her food and treats and gave her the remote when she dropped it. She said Thanks at first. Then that stopped. Getting her to talk was hopeless.Then she made the mistake.\x{2014}I'm just going down to the shops, Leanne. Can I get you anything?The face lit up. She sat up on the couch. She smiled \x{2013} grinned; the little girl who'd danced around the kitchen, trying to distract her father, trying to charm him away from her mother's broken body.\x{2014}Bottle of something would be nice, she said.Paula tried to laugh it away.\x{2014}You're joking.Still, the grin. Can I have an ice-cream, Ma? The little head bobbing. Can I? Can I?\x{2014}For fuck sake, Leanne.The child's big eyes.\x{2014}Don't ask me, Leanne. Please.She walked out of the room.Leanne did it herself. She got up the next day and went to the off-licence. She used only one crutch. The other one was lying in the hall. Paula watched her struggle down the street. No coat or jacket on her. Using the neighbours' walls and gates. It was like she was climbing a cliff. Paula couldn't go with her. She couldn't go after her.She went to work.No one has come near Leanne, or phoned, as far as Paula knows. There are no names written on her cast.It's not fuckin' fair.She can't go home. She can't face the sight of her on the couch, the sound of the telly sliding from channel to channel, the bits of broken noise that do her head in. She'll go straight to work, with the shopping bags. She'll wander around town a bit. She can go to Smyth's, have a look at the toys for the grandkids. There's plenty she can be doing.She's losing her fuckin' mind. She can feel it. She can put her hands on the cracks.The list.Jack.She writes the word. She prints it. COMPUTER.It's bought, hiding in Nicola's attic. In its big box.She takes the last of her coffee. She holds it in her mouth. She knocks it back.She found the extra hours. She worked. She went into the AIB and opened her own account. She chose a branch that wasn't the closest to home. It's about two miles away. The money that goes in stays in, unless she's prepared to walk. She isn't going to waste it. She wastes nothing. She's a rock of sense. She doesn't have a bank card yet. She didn't want one. She didn't want to touch the money until it was there, the exact amount. She didn't want to relax.She trusts herself. She'll get herself a bank card after Christmas.Does she, trust herself?Not today.It's not about money. It's about being careful. She has to be careful. For the rest of her life. It's killing her. She can feel it. Every word, every little decision. Chipping away. She wants to put her head on the table here. She wants to just give up. Not give up \x{2013} but take a break. Not have to ignore Leanne. Not have to worry about Jack. To sit down and feel comfortable. To sleep. And wake up like she's rested.She can't go on.Why should she? Who's thanking her?She's feeling sorry for herself. Fuckin' right she is. The blinkers she has to wear. She can't look left or right. Straight ahead, but never too far ahead. And no loitering \x{2013} keep going, keep moving.She's out of the cafe. She's heading for the Dart.Leanne is coming at her. Going sideways on her crutch. She's hanging over the road. White-faced from the cold. And coming straight at Paula.She stabs the path with the crutch. She was told not to put weight on the ankle. Paula was there. She heard the doctor tell her. But she's moving as if she has to keep the good foot off the ground. Like she's punishing herself.\x{2014}Leanne.Leanne sees her and stops. Starts again, and stops. Paula makes sure she's not in her way. The street is empty. There's no one looking. She cares about that. It surprises her.Leanne is skin and bone. Paula sees that, out of the house, out in the open. Leanne is dying.\x{2014}Where are you off to?Leanne shrugs. She rubs her nose.\x{2014}Come home, love.Leanne's knuckles are cracked and red.\x{2014}Will you come home?She wants to reach out \x{2013} she's put down her bags.Leanne moves away. She doesn't look at Paula.Paula picks up her bags. She can hear the crutch on the path. She goes home.She pushes the door. She looks into Leanne's room. She goes in. She stays near the door. She stands there.It's the Boyzone poster that does it. She sees it \x{2013} it's been there, it must be ten years \x{2013} and she's bending down, picking up the dirty clothes. Knickers, socks, a bra gone grey, she sweeps them all up in her arms. She throws them out, onto the landing.She attacks the bed, gets the cover off the duvet. She bought the duvet three weeks ago, when Leanne came home from the hospital. She bought three of them.The sheet \x{2013} she pulls. It's worn, she can see the rubber sheet through it. She yanks it off. She hears it rip but she doesn't care. She feels it. It's damp, and stained. She'll throw it out.She leans over the bed \x{2013} she gets up on it and opens the window. The cold climbs around her.She'll get new sheets today.She gathers up the clothes on the landing, and the duvet cover and pillowcase. She looks into Jack's room. She throws the duvet over his bed. She flattens it out. She picks up one of his socks. She goes into her own room. She pulls back the curtains. She opens her window. She feels the cold come from behind her. The toilet door slams. There's fresh air running through the place. She takes her own jeans off the floor, a pair of socks, heels worn to nothing. She'll throw them out too.She goes down the stairs. The cold air follows her. She'll put in a wash. Then she's going to make soup. She'll fill the house with the smell of soup. It'll smack Jack when he comes in from school. It'll get Leanne too, when she comes back.She feels good. She feels calm. She feels hungry.",

            '[ap > 05:00] Paula Spencer - Roddy Doyle.epub (index_split_011.html) - after five o\'clock',
            "She slept; she must have. There was potato in her mouth, muck. Her mouth was dry \x{2013} she wanted to shout. There were fingers at her, fingers hurting her, between her legs. She wanted to scream; she couldn't move. The fingers were hard, they tried to cut straight through her. She screamed \x{2013} she couldn't. There were fingers in her mouth, pulling out clumps of white dryness. Her mouth was full of it.Leanne was rubbing her shoulder.She was awake. Definitely awake. Her mouth was dry, horrible. Her body was soaking. She could even feel the slickness on her ankles.Leanne's face was close to hers. Her chin was on the duvet.\x{2014}Okay? said Leanne.Then there was water, a cup. She sat up. The cup was at her lip. Water in her mouth \x{2013} the dryness broke away. Drops fell from the cup and burnt her neck. Then it was nice. She didn't want to cry.\x{2014}Okay?\x{2014}Thanks, love. Jesus, though.The sheet was hard under her. It was curled and lumpy and she was caught in the duvet. The hard fingers were still there, just beyond her.\x{2014}You were dreaming.Leanne's face was back, close to hers.\x{2014}It wasn't dreaming.\x{2014}I was here, said Leanne. \x{2014}You're grand.\x{2014}Yeah.She sat up a bit more to get out of the tangle. To get away from the fingers.\x{2014}Yeah, she said again.\x{2014}Can you get out for a sec?\x{2014}Why?\x{2014}I'll straighten the sheets for you.The air attacked her as she stood beside the bed. She rubbed her arms. She watched Leanne patting the sheet flat.\x{2014}God, it's wet.\x{2014}I didn't \x{2013} ?\x{2014}Sweat.Leanne pulled the sheet off the bed. The duvet was on the floor. Paula bent down. She felt her head follow her. She took the duvet in her hands. It was heavy. She got it around her shoulders. She still shivered but she felt the circles under her skin getting smaller. Leanne came back with a sheet. The landing light was on outside. Leanne was limping. She stopped and lifted her hands. She disappeared behind the sheet. The sheet was the room. Then it rose, lifted. Then she saw Leanne looking up at the sheet, holding it, waiting for it to drop.That was yesterday. She's lost a bit of weight. She went out to the toilet a while ago. She stood on the scales. Her Christmas present from Denise. What sort of a fuckin' present is that?\x{2014}I got it for the colour, said Denise.Paula has lost four pounds, in only a couple of days. According to her slate-grey scales. She leans sideways, lifts her T-shirt. Her arse looks the same. It's red, from where she's been lying. That'd be lovely now, bedsores. She's thinking too much. She must be getting better.Someone's laughing. It could be next door. That sometimes happens. Paula's often thought there's someone in the house, but it's someone next door coming down their own stairs. She doesn't know the neighbours, either side. She's only seen them a few times. The crowd on the other side of her bedroom wall, they've only been there a few months. She's not sure how many. They're all young. Leanne thinks they're Russian. Jack says they're Polish. Three tall girls. Leanne says they're prostitutes or lap-dancers. Jack says one of them works for Google.\x{2014}How d'you know? she asked him.\x{2014}She told me, he said.She watched the colour rise up over his face.\x{2014}What's Google?He showed her. They went up to his room. She sat on the side of his bed. He sat at his desk. He had to go over the bed, around Paula, to get to it. The desk came from Nicola's husband, Tony. That's what Tony does, supplies office equipment. There was a scratch across the top; a customer refused to accept delivery. So it's Jack's. The computer's right on top of the scratch.He went on-line. She watched him. It looked easy enough. Then he typed in something \x{2013} she leaned closer to the screen \x{2013} www.google.ie.\x{2014}It's a search engine, he said. \x{2014}A bit like a library.He didn't look at her.\x{2014}What do you want to know about? he said.\x{2014}Jesus, Jack. Where would I start?He hated when she spoke like that. She was supposed to be his mother.\x{2014}You choose, she said.\x{2014}No, he said. \x{2014}You do.It was nice, the way he said it. But she couldn't think of anything.\x{2014}Look, he said.He typed in Thin Lizzy.Her favourite group. He clicked the Google Search button. The screen was blank for a second, then a new page appeared.\x{2014}See? he said.He pointed.\x{2014}There are 317,000 different sites.\x{2014}All about Thin Lizzy?\x{2014}Most of them, he said. \x{2014}A lot of them would be just CD prices and catalogue stuff. But look at this one.She watched him click thinlizzyfan.com.\x{2014}This is brilliant, she said.\x{2014}Yeah, he said. \x{2014}Sometimes. A lot of it's just shit.\x{2014}Look at this though, Jack.It was a photograph of Phil Lynott playing chess. She'd never seen this one before. It was a long time since she'd seen any photo of Phil Lynott. It appeared gradually, scrolled down. He looked great. Philip Parris Lynott. August 20, 1949-January 4, 1986.\x{2014}Jesus, said Paula. \x{2014}He's been dead for nearly twenty years.\x{2014}Yeah.There was a cartoon flame under the photograph, flickering like the Olympic torch. And the words, Eternal Flame.\x{2014}There was no one like him, she said.\x{2014}D'you want to see anything else? said Jack.\x{2014}Put me in it, she said.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Type in my name, she said. \x{2014}Just to see.\x{2014}Okay, he said.She watched him type. He was fast. She watched her name grow in the box. She watched him click the button. The page disappeared. It was blank for a second, then the new page was there.She wanted to get away. She couldn't sit there.Jack was laughing. He pointed.\x{2014}575,000 hits, he said. \x{2014}More than Thin Lizzy.She stood up to see better.\x{2014}What're they about? she asked. \x{2014}They're not about me.She couldn't make sense of the list.\x{2014}I think they're about a woman who writes baby books, said Jack.\x{2014}Called Paula Spencer?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}All of them?\x{2014}I think so, he said.He clicked again, at other pages. She saw her name again, in heavy black. She was all down the page. She sat down. It was safe now; she knew what it was. She sat back. But she couldn't read. She had to get her eyes close to the screen.\x{2014}Parenting Guide to Pregnancy and Childbirth, she read. \x{2014}I don't remember writing that one.She put her hand on Jack's shoulder. He stayed still. He didn't try to escape.\x{2014}The Happiest Toddler on the Block, she read. \x{2014}Can you get more, Jack?He did the clicky thing. The screen was blank, then she saw a book cover. A smiling kid, American-looking, gleaming, confident. And she read the full title of the book.\x{2014}The New Way to Stop the Daily Battle of Wills and Raise a Secure and Well-Behaved One-to-Four-Year-Old. For fuck sake.There was a Paula Spencer out there who thought she could do all that.\x{2014}I actually did meet another woman called Paula Spencer once, she said.\x{2014}Yeah?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Cool.\x{2014}At a funeral. She was my cousin or something.\x{2014}Whose funeral?\x{2014}I can't remember. One of my uncles, I think. I'm not sure. Your granny would know. I could ask her.She saw another name. She pointed.\x{2014}Let's see that one.'The Mom Next Door'.\x{2014}That's me, Jack. The mom next door.\x{2014}Hi, Mom, said Jack.\x{2014}Hi, sweetie. Want some pie?\x{2014}Shove it up your arse, Mom.They laughed. She put her arm around his neck. She couldn't feel an objection. He didn't stiffen or shudder. She let go and sat back a little bit.There was a photo of a woman, this other Paula.\x{2014}That must be her.She looked okay but kind of mad, her eyes wide-big, like the skin around them had been pulled back. Maybe it had. There was a photo of her children. And that was it. She looked like one of them. She looked like a child, kind of a withered girl, grinning. Trying too hard to please.\x{2014}Seen enough? said Jack.\x{2014}Yeah, she said. \x{2014}It's brilliant though, isn't it? The Net and that?\x{2014}It's grand; yeah.There's no more noise from next door. She heard them in bed one night. She heard the bed, when she was falling asleep. She didn't know what it was \x{2013} it was something far off, barely intruding \x{2013} and then she did know. A couple making love. She'd recognised the sound, the rhythm of the bed. She'd been pleased with herself, the mystery solved.More laughing from downstairs. It sounds like a man. It isn't Jack. He doesn't have it yet, that deep sound. It could be Tony, Nicola's husband. But he isn't really a laugher. It annoys her, not knowing. She must be getting better.The News is on the radio. It's <<after five o'clock|6>>. She can't hear it properly. That's fine. She'll turn it up when she hears the Angelus at <<six|9c:1>>. She'll get the headlines. It's what she does. She stays informed. Sinn Fein are acting the maggot. There's a child gone missing in Cork.She remembers the other Paula Spencer, the one she met at the funeral. She was a good bit older than Paula, but younger, probably, than Paula is now. It was years ago. It was the only thing they had in common. The name. It was a good one, though. They'd both married men called Spencer. She wore a headscarf in the church, the other Paula. They all went back to the house \x{2013} whose house? \x{2013} and Paula's mother introduced them to each other. They'd laughed. They were both drinking tea. She remembers holding the saucer. She wouldn't drink anything stronger in front of her mother, or her father.It clicks \x{2013} her Uncle Eamon. He was the one who'd died. Her father's brother. She won't have to ask her mother. That'll save her half an hour. Her mother's memory only works when she wants it to.The door's opening. She hadn't heard the stairs. She tries to sink without moving. She pretends she's waking. It's Jack. She sees the silhouette.\x{2014}Alright?It's John Paul.That's twice she gotten them wrong. Nicola was Leanne and now Jack becomes John Paul. They're knitting together, her children; they're coming back to her. That's what it feels like.\x{2014}John Paul, she says.\x{2014}Feeling any better?\x{2014}I'm grand, she says. \x{2014}Much better. Was that you I heard laughing?\x{2014}Don't think so, he says.\x{2014}I heard someone laughing.He says nothing.She sits up. She doesn't make a meal of it. It's not Nicola or Leanne. She doesn't want John Paul leaning over, punching her pillows. She's sitting right up before she thinks about it. He's a man. He's a stranger.\x{2014}There, she says. \x{2014}That's better. Who told you?\x{2014}What?\x{2014}About me.\x{2014}No one. I mean, downstairs. They told me. At the door, like.\x{2014}I didn't hear the bell.\x{2014}I didn't ring it.He hasn't moved.Now he does. He closes the door over a bit. He talks as he does it.\x{2014}I know, he says. \x{2014}You don't like the bell.She's stunned.\x{2014}God, she says.It's true. She used to hate the sound of the doorbell. It lifted her off the floor, every time it rang. It was always the Guards or some butty of Charlo's \x{2013} bad news. It was reality, the end, trying to get in at her, taking away her children.\x{2014}That's long ago, she says.She still can't see him properly, now the door's closed over. It's dark at the curtains. It's night-time. But the shape, his silhouette, it could never be Jack.He moves. Slowly.\x{2014}One of the kids saw me.He touches the bed. He sits.\x{2014}Nicola's. She was looking out the window.His weight pulls the mattress down.\x{2014}What're their names? he says.\x{2014}Who?But she knows who he means as she says it.\x{2014}Vanessa's six. And Gillian. She's nearly four.\x{2014}Must've been Vanessa, he says. \x{2014}Strange.\x{2014}Not knowing their names?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}You know them now.She cries. She tries to stop, not start\x{2014}\x{2014}Sorry.He says nothing. He doesn't move.She wishes he'd go, he'd get the fuck out of her room. She shouldn't have woken up, or pretended to. She feels exposed. The guilt rips through her \x{2013} it never lets up.\x{2014}You're alright, he says. \x{2014}Must get them together with my gang.Nicola and Star. Jesus.\x{2014}That'd be nice, she says. \x{2014}I'd like that.\x{2014}Yeah.She wipes her eyes and her nose. She uses the duvet. She doesn't care.\x{2014}I'd really like that, John Paul.He stands up slowly. She feels the weight go off the bed before she sees him move.\x{2014}We'll see, he says. \x{2014}You know yourself.She doesn't.\x{2014}Nicola's a wagon.\x{2014}She's great, says Paula.\x{2014}I know.\x{2014}She's been great to me.\x{2014}Yeah.He moves to the door.\x{2014}Good luck, he says.He's good. She knows that.\x{2014}Bye, love, she says.Too late, it's out \x{2013} love.But he's still there.\x{2014}Thanks for coming, she says.\x{2014}No problem.He opens the door. She doesn't want the light.\x{2014}There wasn't a reason why you wanted to see me, was there? she says.\x{2014}Leanne.\x{2014}What about Leanne?\x{2014}Came to see her.\x{2014}Oh. Grand. Great. Bye.He closes the door.Things are happening because she's out of the way. If she gets up now and goes downstairs, she'll wreck it. They're all down there because she's up here. She's at her own fuckin' funeral. They're having her wake downstairs.She poisons everything good that happens. She was sick and they came to help out. They've been lovely. They're all downstairs. Her family.What's he doing with Leanne?Helping her, you fuckin' clown.\x{2014}What did he want?She's awake again and Nicola's in the room. She's ready to go home. She has her jacket buttoned, and that lovely scarf with the red in it that makes Nicola's face look radiant. She doesn't know what time it is. She's really been asleep.Her mouth is dry again. It's the worst feeling. Waking up old.\x{2014}What did he want? Nicola had said.\x{2014}John Paul? says Paula.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Well, she says.She tries to sit up. She can't manage it.\x{2014}Here.Nicola leans over, helps her up. Paula's not messing. She's heavy with sleep; she wants to fall back. She's not hot now, though.\x{2014}He came to see Leanne, she says.\x{2014}Did he? says Nicola.\x{2014}Yeah. He did. Is there any water left in that glass, love?\x{2014}I'll get you some fresh. Did he ask you for anything?\x{2014}Ah Nicola. No. No, he didn't.She grabs Nicola's hand when she leans down for the glass beside the bed. She doesn't grab. She puts her hand on Nicola's hand.\x{2014}He's not like that now, she says.\x{2014}Maybe, says Nicola.Paula pats the hand. It's a lovely hand. Paula can't see it properly, but she knows. The fingers are long and her nails are always perfect, never a scratch or a cracked nail. Nicola has never let work or age get into her hands. That's the most amazing thing about Nicola, Paula thinks. Or what it stands for \x{2013} they stand for, her hands. Nicola is in control. Nicola can manage. Nicola is much, much more than she's supposed to be. Paula adores her.\x{2014}He's changed, she says. \x{2014}He has.He's a lot like you, she wants to say.\x{2014}Just, be careful, says Nicola.Nicola's right. Paula must be careful. About John Paul, about Leanne, about Nicola and Jack, about herself and everything. Nicola knows all about taking care. She's been looking after them all for years. They hate her for it. They hate her and they hold her beautiful hand. She's had her problems and they haven't cared. They don't want to know. She's been their mother, and mothers can't have problems.Paula wants to be Nicola's mother.She understands why John Paul's arrival worries Nicola. Nicola knows. One cracked nail and it's over.She'll get up tomorrow.
Rita is getting something out of her car. Paula can see her, leaning right in. Her arse fills most of the open door.Paula keeps walking.\x{2014}You're better, Paula.Paula stops. She smiles. Rita's standing beside the car.\x{2014}I am, yeah, Rita. I'm grand.\x{2014}Your Jack was telling me you weren't well.Poor Jack.\x{2014}It was just the flu, she says.\x{2014}It's everywhere, says Rita.They stand there. It's cold. Rita's wearing a purple fleece thing.She speaks.\x{2014}Wasn't that desperate about that poor boy in Cork?\x{2014}Dreadful, says Paula.The missing boy has been found, murdered.\x{2014}The poor parents, says Rita.Paula nods\x{2014}Desperate.They say nothing for a while.Rita sighs.\x{2014}We're lucky, Paula, she says.This morning, Paula agrees with her.Rita nods at her front door.\x{2014}The kettle's on.Paula follows her, past the car, into the hall. Over the white carpet \x{2013} Paula's sure she can hear it breathing. She follows Rita into the kitchen.\x{2014}We'll crack open a tin of biscuits, says Rita. \x{2014}I've a few tins of those Fox's Assortment left over.Paula puts down her SuperValu bag. She takes off her jacket. She watches Rita tear the tape off the lid of the biscuit tin.\x{2014}Jesus, says Rita. \x{2014}They're fierce generous with the tape.Paula can't help it; she's excited.\x{2014}I could hold onto them till next Christmas, I suppose, says Rita.She pulls the lid off the tin.\x{2014}Too late now, says you.She puts the tin in front of Paula.\x{2014}The guest goes first, she says.Paula hesitates.\x{2014}Go on.\x{2014}I'm making me mind up, Rita. Take it easy.Rita's not the worst. She knew Charlo. She's seen Paula with her arm in a sling, with stitches in her lip. She's seen Leanne struggling down the street. She's watched Paula go through it all and she still smiles at her. And Paula's seen her share. She saw Rita's son getting himself into trouble. She saw the squad car. She saw him being walked out to the car, his hands cuffed, two Guards holding his arms. That's Raymond. He's the same age as Nicola. Paula can ask about him, how he's getting on. She knows that the girl who calls Rita Mammy is actually Rita's daughter's child. Her name is Shelley, a lovely kid. She's a few years younger than Jack. It's no big deal. Everyone knows, including Shelley. But Paula knew. Paula and Rita can look straight at each other. She admits it. She likes Rita. The biscuits help.Leanne's in the kitchen when Paula gets home. Her cheeks are still red from the shower and her hair is wet. She's making a sandwich for herself.\x{2014}Want a bit? she says.\x{2014}No; you're grand.The cast is off her foot but she's limping. She's going back to work next Monday. So she says.She's up and down. And Paula's up and down with her, dipping and rising as she watches and waits. She tries not to be. She knows it's no help. She's thinking of phoning John Paul. She's not sure if she should.Leanne's still drinking. That's the thing. It hasn't been the happy ending. But it's not the long binge on the couch. Leanne saw that; she disgusted herself. She's back to normal. There's space between the binges. But the spaces are hard to measure. There's no such thing as a casual remark. It'll be better when Leanne goes back to work. Leanne has always worked. She'll be getting up, going to bed early. They'll be able to talk to each other during the week.That's the plan.She's in Rita's again. It's two days later. She's had three biscuits from the tin. That's her limit. She's not sure why \x{2013} it's not her tin. Two chocolate ones and a plain. They're in the front room, sitting back. The gas fire's on. It looks like real coal; it really does. Paula could stare at it for ever.\x{2014}I wouldn't move from here, Paula, says Rita.\x{2014}No, says Paula.\x{2014}Paddy talks about it, says Rita. \x{2014}He'd like something a bit bigger. But I say to him, what would we do with the extra space?Fill it, says Paula, to herself.She looks around. The fire, the flat-screen telly, the three-in-one. Rita isn't boasting, or she doesn't know she is. She's just content \x{2013} Paula thinks. And that's fine. Good luck to her. She begrudges Rita nothing. And anyway, Paula's fridge is bigger than Rita's.Rita has no sisters.\x{2014}None, she says, when Paula asks her. \x{2014}I'd have liked one or two.\x{2014}You can have mine, says Paula.\x{2014}Ah, now.Paula had three sisters but Wendy died in a motorbike crash. She was the passenger, behind her boyfriend. They went into a wall in Wicklow, somewhere near Glendalough. That was years ago. She was six years younger than Paula.\x{2014}Who have you got? says Rita. \x{2014}There's Carmel. And who's the other one?\x{2014}Denise.\x{2014}That's right, says Rita. \x{2014}Well, I have to say now, you can keep Carmel.They laugh.\x{2014}She'd be a bit too much for me, says Rita.\x{2014}Ah, she's not too bad, says Paula.It dawned on Paula, when she was sick. Carmel and Nicola are very alike. She'd never put them together before. She was sick and afraid to go to bed. She heard Carmel's voice on the phone and she heard Nicola talking to her little ones as they walked up to her door. And she knew. She could be sick now. Carmel and Nicola were there. They were coming to the rescue.Paula loves them for that, and resents and sometimes hates them for it.Has she ever hated Nicola?She's alone now, at home. Leanne's out \x{2013} where? \x{2013} and Jack's at school. She's on the couch, so she can look out the window at the sky above the roofs across the road. She decided to sit here more often, after sitting in Rita's front room. The telly's off. She has her coffee. She'll be getting up soon, off to work.Hate's something you don't come back from. That's the way she sees it. You don't slip in and out of it. It builds up. You cross some sort of a line. It's permanent.She's never hated Nicola.But there's Charlo. She hated him. Her body is a map of his abuse. She just has to look at the bones in her right hand, or feel her shoulder when she knows it's going to rain.But it seems like a different world, and different people \x{2013} all that happened then. It's the same house. She still hates the hall. She thinks back \x{2013} she doesn't have to \x{2013} she sees herself, lying on the kitchen floor, or lying on the floor here, under the window, the telly on loud, a baby crying \x{2013} Leanne \x{2013} and it's not her. It is, but she's different. She could get up and go over to the exact spot where she lay after Charlo had given her a hiding. She could lie down and put her legs and arms in the right places, as if her outline had been chalked on the carpet. She could do that now, and she'd feel nothing.Maybe it's age. And it's definitely the drink. She's not sure. Maybe it's the way the brain works to protect itself. It invents a new woman who can look back and wonder, instead of look back and howl. Maybe it happens to everyone. But it's definitely the drink, or life without it. It's a different world. She's not sure she likes it that much. But she's a new-old woman, learning how to live.What a load of shite. She's the same woman. And she knows. She hated the man who put her on the floor, who kicked her as she tried to roll away. She hated him; it's still hot in her gut. She hated him. She still hates him, the bastard, the fuckin' cunt. But she loved him too. If he walked in now she'd love him. He'd save her life, just walking in. He'd lift her out of this existence.She's never hated Nicola. Or Carmel. They've annoyed her and they've made her feel useless and so guilty she's wanted to maim herself, to push the guilt in under her skin so no one can see it or smell it. But she knows. Without them she'd be dead. She's glad she's not dead and it's a good while since she felt different. She's not stupid; she'll feel that way again. But she'll know. She'll recognise it. She'll be able to deal with it.That's the plan.She wants a drink. Now. She can feel it, here, still fresh. She sits because she tells herself to. She'd rather be busy. She's better off moving. It's harder to feel it when she has things to do. She'd like to relax. She'd like to learn to. But relaxation's a bit of a trap. She sits back and it sits beside her. The need, the thirst \x{2013} it's there, here.She has to move. She goes into the kitchen. She empties the kettle. She fills it again. She sees herself doing it. She watches herself.She's so alone.Where's Leanne?But her sisters. Carmel is older than Paula and Denise is younger, but they've always been the pals, Carmel and Denise. The allies, rivals, the sistery stuff. They bypassed Paula.It goes back. She cut herself off. The drink did that. And there was Charlo.Her sisters drink like fish. Paula's shocked when she watches them. They lower the stuff. Especially Denise. It used to be Carmel who was first to refill her glass. But the last time she was with them, in Denise's house, Denise was pissed when Paula arrived. Paula would swear she was.But she's not sure. Everyone's an alco these days. Everyone who's pale or too red, or limping, or scruffy, or too well made-up. She sniffs, everywhere she goes. She comes home from work on the Dart on Thursday nights, on Fridays, surrounded by gin fumes, Guinness fumes. She's the only solid citizen on the train. It's how she copes. If you can't join them, beat them. She quite likes it, feeling superior. She sits on the Dart and tut-tut-tuts.Her sisters.Where's bloody Leanne?She'll have to go to work. She goes to the hall and gets her jacket \x{2013} Jack's. She goes back into the kitchen. She drinks the last of her tea. She sips it standing up.Her sisters. They're all in Carmel's kitchen. Paula goes there straight from work. Denise is after joining a gym. She tells them this as she leans over to get the wine bottle. Denise and Carmel drink wine these days.\x{2014}Why? says Carmel.\x{2014}Why what? says Denise.\x{2014}Why have you joined a gym?\x{2014}To get fit, says Denise.\x{2014}What age are you? says Carmel.\x{2014}What's that got to do with it?\x{2014}You're, what? Forty-eight?\x{2014}Forty-seven.\x{2014}So? says Paula.\x{2014}What's the point? says Carmel. \x{2014}She was never fit.\x{2014}I used to run, says Denise.\x{2014}You stopped that when you were twelve.\x{2014}Thirteen.Denise doesn't smile. It's not funny yet. But Paula thinks it's hilarious.\x{2014}So, says Carmel. \x{2014}Thirty-four years later you've decided to get fit. Are you not a bit late? I don't like this one much, by the way, she says, nodding at her glass.That's allowed because the wine came out of her own bottle. She hasn't opened Denise's yet. Paula brought a large bottle of Ballygowan. She had to bring something. And she brought as well \x{2013} she feels a bit of a wagon for doing it \x{2013} three peeled carrots, in a plastic bag.\x{2014}One each? Carmel had said.\x{2014}Not really, said Paula. \x{2014}They're kind of for me.\x{2014}They look interesting, said Carmel. \x{2014}What are they called?\x{2014}Fuck off, Carmel.\x{2014}Carrots. Isn't that it? I've a bag of them in the fridge over there. I knew I'd seen them before.Now Carmel is still at Denise.\x{2014}Well? she says. \x{2014}You are a bit late, Denise. Aren't you?\x{2014}You're never too late, says Denise.That's real Denise; she can be hopeless.\x{2014}Sure, Jesus, Denise, you'll be dead before you're fit. Even if you go to the gym every day. If you live in the fuckin' place. Which one is it anyway?\x{2014}Lay off her, says Paula.\x{2014}Let's be fuckin' realistic here, says Carmel.Paula watches her. Carmel mightn't think much of the wine but she's fairly knocking it back. Tut-tut.\x{2014}Get real, ladies, says Carmel. \x{2014}We're finished.\x{2014}Speak for yourself.\x{2014}Our get-fit days are over. We're falling apart.And she holds up her glass.\x{2014}Cheers.She looks at Paula.\x{2014}And you with your fuckin' carrots. Between the pair of yis; Jesus.She nods at Denise.\x{2014}Have you met Ms Midlife?\x{2014}You're just jealous, says Denise.That's another real Denise line.\x{2014}Of what?That's a real Carmel one.Denise looks at the kitchen door, making sure it's closed. She moves her chair an inch closer to the table. She looks at the door again. The house is empty. It's just the three of them.When Denise speaks she's not looking at Paula or Carmel.\x{2014}Just because I've met someone, she says.Paula watches Denise redden before she really understands what she's just heard. Denise's face \x{2013} excitement, fear.Jesus Christ, she's having a fling.Paula looks at Carmel. It's news to Carmel too.\x{2014}What's this? says Carmel.Denise shrugs.Paula's stunned. She hasn't felt this way \x{2013} slow, stupid, outside the meaning \x{2013} since she stopped drinking.Her sister is having an affair.Denise still hasn't spoken. Neither has Carmel.Her sister, whose husband isn't dead, is having an affair.She looks at Denise. Denise is coming down from the shrug. Her hand goes for her glass. She's shaking a bit.Paula decides to get in before Carmel. It'll be easier for Denise.\x{2014}You're seeing someone?Denise nods. She gulps. She hides behind the glass. Then she puts it down on the table. She still holds it.\x{2014}A fella? says Carmel.Paula can't help it; she laughs. But it's not fair. Carmel makes it sound so silly. Fella. Denise is running around with some sixteen-year-old. They're snogging behind the chipper. He has his hand up her jumper.It's cruel.But Denise is wise this time. She just nods.Carmel looks at Paula. Paula can tell. Carmel needs to know if Paula knew about this before her. She'd love to cheat \x{2013}Yes! I did! I fuckin' introduced them! She'd love to break Carmel's heart.She shrugs.Carmel looks at Denise.\x{2014}So, she says.Denise giggles. She does. It's the only word to describe the noise that comes out of Denise. Paula could kill her; she's not sure why. She'd love to be Denise right now and she wouldn't be fuckin' giggling.Carmel sighs.\x{2014}Tongues and all, yeah? she says.Paula doesn't laugh this time. She looks at Denise.\x{2014}Tongues and all, says Denise.And the tongues have just gone across her eyes. That's what it looks like to Paula. Or a hand, fingers have gone down Denise's back. She sits up \x{2013} she arches, the bitch \x{2013} in the kitchen chair. She looks as if she's going to lick her lips.\x{2014}Well, says Carmel. \x{2014}We'd better hear it. Tell your Auntie Carmel.\x{2014}Where do I start? says Denise.For fuck sake.\x{2014}Your eyes met, says Carmel.\x{2014}Sneer away, says Denise.Paula hasn't seen Denise like this before. She's dangling it all in front of Carmel. Carmel bites; she always has. And Denise doesn't care.\x{2014}In the gym? says Carmel.Denise shakes her head.\x{2014}Wrong, she says.\x{2014}Look it, Denise, says Carmel. \x{2014}We're not going to spend the rest of the night guessing.\x{2014}Parent-teacher meeting, says Denise.\x{2014}There's romance, says Carmel.But Paula thinks it's lovely.\x{2014}He sat\x{2014}, Denise starts.She sits up, nearly acting it out.\x{2014}We were sitting beside each other.All those years, Paula didn't go to those parent-teacher meetings. She'd been too afraid to go. Afraid of what she'd hear, of how she looked. Too busy; otherwise engaged. She'll go to the next one.\x{2014}A teacher?\x{2014}No! says Denise. \x{2014}A parent. A father, like. A dad.\x{2014}We know what a father is, Denise.\x{2014}There was a queue at the English teacher's desk and I'd seen all the other ones. The other teachers, like. And Anthony's very good in school \x{2014}Anthony's her youngest, a few years younger than Jack. A nice kid, but a bit thick \x{2013} Paula thinks.\x{2014}So I didn't mind waiting. I knew that whatever she\x{2013} his teacher \x{2013} was going to say about him would be good and I'd go home on a high.\x{2014}And you did, says Carmel.\x{2014}I didn't go home at all, says Denise.She giggles again.\x{2014}Well, I did.\x{2014}You're not a complete slut, so, says Carmel.\x{2014}Yes, I am, says Denise.What the fuck is happening here?Denise sits up again; she keeps sliding. And Paula sits up. And \x{2013} Paula watches her \x{2013} so does Carmel. There's a man in the room.\x{2014}But I was bit late, says Denise. \x{2014}Home. But not that late. We went for a drink, just.Anthony doesn't go to the local school, the same school as Jack. They sent him to the Christian Brothers, even though there aren't any Brothers left in the school. They're all dead or in jail. Paula remembers Denise saying about it being better suited to Anthony's abilities. Paula knows the school. She goes past it every Wednesday, on the bus, on her way to her Wednesday house. She tries to remember, to see, the nearest pub to the school. She tries to see its inside. The lounge. A corner. A lounge girl, the tray.\x{2014}How'd it happen? she asks.Denise looks at her, surprised, disappointed it's Paula asking and not Carmel. Then she realises that Paula is serious.\x{2014}Well, says Denise. \x{2014}He said \x{2014}\x{2014}D'you come here often? says Carmel.Denise looks caught, confused \x{2013} ashamed.\x{2014}He didn't, did he?Denise nods.\x{2014}Yeah. But it wasn't \x{2014} . It was the way he said it. He was funny.\x{2014}It's a great line.\x{2014}Feck off, Carmel.\x{2014}He was being ironic, says Paula.\x{2014}Yeah, says Denise. \x{2014}And it really was funny. And anyway, we just got talking.\x{2014}What about?\x{2014}I'm not sure.\x{2014}Yes, you are.\x{2014}Our boys.\x{2014}Lovely.\x{2014}Just at the start. Anyway, what else would we have talked about?\x{2014}Football, the Peace Process, Charles and Camilla.\x{2014}I didn't go there for it to happen, Carmel, says Denise. \x{2014}It just \x{2014}\x{2014}You weren't on the prowl, no?\x{2014}No.\x{2014}How long was the queue?\x{2014}Long enough, says Denise.Good girl.\x{2014}He was just \x{2014}She looks at Paula.\x{2014}Nice.Paula nods.\x{2014}We just chatted. And he was in front of me \x{2014}\x{2014}Nice one.\x{2014}And he went to the seat at the teacher's desk and I must say now \x{2014}But she doesn't say now. She doesn't say anything. She holds her glass. Paula thinks she's going to smash it, her fingers are so stiff. Paula's going to lean over and take it from her. But Denise breathes out.\x{2014}I liked the look of him, she says.\x{2014}The look of him, says Carmel.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}What? His \x{2014}\x{2014}Don't cheapen it, Carmel, says Denise. \x{2014}Use your fuckin' imagination.And Paula sees it; they all sit up again. The synchronised fuckin' sisters.\x{2014}And he had his few minutes with the teacher. Miss Murray. She's very nice. And he got up and I sat in the place where he'd been.\x{2014}Nice.\x{2014}And Miss Murray said her bit. He's doing really well. She says he'll sail through his Junior Cert.\x{2014}Good, says Paula.\x{2014}Yeah. And I said thank you very much. I was thrilled, you know yourself.Paula nods.\x{2014}And I got up and I was finished then. I'd seen them all. And all the teachers were in the one big room, at tables. The assembly hall, I think they call it. And I was going to the door. And there he was.\x{2014}At the door.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Blocking your way.\x{2014}Yeah. No. Just there. I could've walked past him. I was going to. I mean. I was on my way home. But I \x{2014}She stops. She puts both her hands on the table. She moves her glass.\x{2014}Something, she says. \x{2014}I slowed down, I suppose. I didn't stop. But I slowed down a bit. I didn't decide to. Not exactly.She isn't drunk at all. Paula can see that.\x{2014}But I did slow down. So I'd go by him slowly. He smiled. Like, a goodbye smile, you know. See you next time. Who'd be a parent? You know, like?Paula nods.\x{2014}And I smiled back. And he opened his mouth, like he was going to say something. And I said, What? And I stopped. And he said, Sorry? Like that, you know. And we laughed.\x{2014}Ah.\x{2014}And I was blushing; Jesus.She's blushing now. Paula wants to hug her. And kill her.\x{2014}And he said would we go for a drink. But, like. Hesitantly. Like, only if you want, if you have the time. He wasn't used to it. You could tell.\x{2014}Used to what? says Carmel.\x{2014}Going for drinks with women. Asking them.\x{2014}That's nice.\x{2014}Well, it was.\x{2014}You're his first slut, so.The timing's perfect. The oven goes ping. It's the bell, the timer. They laugh. Paula leans across and pats Denise's hand.Carmel stands up.\x{2014}Here we go.She puts her face down to Denise's.\x{2014}Finger food.And that sets them off again. Denise takes her glasses off; they're steaming. She wipes her eyes. She smiles at Paula.\x{2014}She's a wagon.Carmel bends down, opens the oven door.\x{2014}Jesus.The heat \x{2013} Paula can see it \x{2013} sails out, up, past Carmel's face. Carmel steps back. The smoke alarm goes off. It's on the ceiling, over the oven. Paula doesn't have a smoke alarm at home.\x{2014}Give us the brush, there, says Carmel.It's a horrible noise. Paula wouldn't have it. She'd rather burn to death.\x{2014}That's the only bad thing about this alarm, says Carmel. \x{2014}It fuckin' works.Paula finds the brush. It's beside the back door.\x{2014}Open the door while you're there, says Carmel. \x{2014} Get some air in.Paula does. The cold air goes past and around her. The alarm is still going. It's a good brush. A blue handle, electric blue. And grey bristles, but not the usual shape.\x{2014}Hurry!Carmel takes the brush. She holds it by the working end. She stretches, and stabs at the alarm with the handle. Paula looks. There's a button on the side of the alarm. It's like a little spaceship stuck to the ceiling. The handle hits the button. One last yip \x{2013} the noise stops.\x{2014}Oh, thank God.The brush falls out of Carmel's hand. Paula catches it, before it hits the table. She's pleased; it was easy. She could do it again.\x{2014}Now, says Carmel.She bends down again.\x{2014}These look grand; I wasn't sure.She pulls out the oven tray. She puts it on top of the hot plates; they're all off.Carmel stands back.Paula shuts the back door.Carmel takes a fag from the packet on the counter and she lights up. And Paula realises. Denise is off them. She hasn't smoked all night. She's a forty-a-day woman \x{2013} was. It must be serious, whatever's happening to her.Carmel exhales. She nods at the oven tray.\x{2014}I got these in the new Tesco's, she says. \x{2014}The Darndale Opera House.\x{2014}Is it any good? says Paula.\x{2014}It's open twenty-four hours a day, says Carmel.\x{2014}Jesus.\x{2014}Things taste better if you buy them at <<five in the morning|5>>.Paula's starving. She loves the look of the prawns wrapped in pastry, like little spring rolls, and the miniature quiches and the little sausages wrapped in bits of rasher.\x{2014}And they all take the same time to cook? says Paula.\x{2014}That's right, says Carmel.\x{2014}That's brilliant, isn't it?\x{2014}Dips and all, says Carmel. \x{2014}There's nothing to it. Just throw them on the tray and take the lids off the dips.She throws her cigarette into the sink. Paula hears the hiss.\x{2014}Mind you, says Carmel. \x{2014}They always look much better on the packet.\x{2014}These look lovely, but.\x{2014}We'll see. Sit down.Carmel puts on oven gloves. They're tartan. They're clean. She shakes the oven tray.\x{2014}Grand.Paula looks at Denise. She looks a bit impatient. She wants to get on with her story. Maybe she's just hungry. Paula smiles at her.Adultery, though. It's a good one. And Denise. It's a surprise. She'd kind of expect it of Carmel. She'll probably find someone now; she won't be outdone by Denise.That's not fair.Yes, it is. Stand back and watch.She hears the scrape. Carmel is hoisting the food onto a couple of plates, with a spatula.Denise smiles at Paula.\x{2014}Can I borrow some of your water?\x{2014}What's wrong with the tap? says Carmel. \x{2014}The alco here needs her bubbles.She's standing beside Paula now, and Paula whacks her on the leg.\x{2014}Fire away, she tells Denise.Carmel puts the first white plate onto the table.\x{2014}Don't dare touch them yet.Denise pours some of the Ballygowan into her wine glass. She's over the hump, Paula guesses. Now she's just thirsty. Paula's thirsty all the time. She lowers the water, day and night. She brings a plastic bottle with her, with tap water, whenever she thinks of it; when she remembers. And it's the thing that's there when the situation is tricky, with Leanne, or John Paul or even Nicola. When the talk is awkward, the past or the present \x{2013} it's the roaring thirst. The dry throat that actually takes over her whole body. And it's not alcohol; that's not what she needs \x{2013} that's a different one. It's just water \x{2013} dehydration. But it's nearly the same need. She can't cope until she feels the water crawling down through her, and up to the place behind her forehead, the pain there, and the joints right below her ears. Like oil. Calming her, softening the dry edges. It's even had an impact on her skin. She looks at the back of her hand. It's not as dry; there are no open cracks. It's the skin of a hard-working woman. She's seen a lot worse.Leanne's hands are desperate. Scratched raw, especially the wrists. Paula hates to see those scratches, self-inflicted \x{2013} all her life. They remind her of the little girl, holding onto Paula, clinging, getting between Paula and Charlo. Protecting her. Leave my mammy alone. The skinny little wrists, the little red fingers, the nails bitten to blood and nothing.But Leanne's creaming her hands again. She carries a tube of E45. Paula bought it for her. And she's going back to work. I'm proud of you. Paula can't say that. She'd wear the words out; they'd mean nothing. Leanne puts on eye shadow. She puts on a skirt. She puts her key in the door without falling over. I'm so, so proud of you.Paula's having a great time but she wants to be at home. It's where she should be. She doesn't know if Leanne's at home. She can't phone. She can't do anything. It's depressing, if she lets it be. It'll never end. If Denise's man had been talking to Paula \x{2013} Who'd be a parent, eh? \x{2013} she'd have put her head on his shoulder and started to bawl.Carmel puts the second plate on the table, and smaller plates for each of them.Paula stretches her hand. She rubs the lower knuckle of her thumb. She doesn't think it's swollen. It doesn't look it. On the bad days, the soreness goes to her wrist, to her elbow. Like a disease, spreading. She doesn't want to know.She loads her plate, two of each thing. She loves this stuff. She can taste it. She promises herself \x{2013} she did before, but she forgot \x{2013} she'll get some of this for a Friday night, herself and Jack. Leanne. And a video. Jack says that videos are on their way out. There'll soon be none to rent or buy. So that's another thing on her list, between Coat and Year Off \x{2013} Maybe Australia. A DVD player.It's back to business.\x{2014}So, says Carmel. \x{2014}Where were we?\x{2014}In the pub, says Paula.\x{2014}It's not really a pub, says Denise. \x{2014}Hotel.\x{2014}Already? says Carmel. \x{2014}You were quick off the fuckin' mark.\x{2014}No, says Denise. \x{2014}The bar, Carmel; stop messing. It's in a hotel.Paula knows the one. She hasn't been in it.\x{2014}Go on, says Carmel.\x{2014}We just chatted.\x{2014}Is he married? says Paula.\x{2014}Yeah, of course. He was at the parent-teacher meeting.\x{2014}He's not separated, no? Divorced?\x{2014}No. But he's not happy, Paula.\x{2014}Ah, God love him, says Carmel. \x{2014}Are you happy, Paula?\x{2014}No.\x{2014}I'm not either. Are you happy, Denise?And fair play to Denise.\x{2014}I'm very happy, Carmel. I was in bed with a complete stranger a couple of hours ago. Why wouldn't I be happy?Carmel's mobile goes off \x{2013} the text buzz \x{2013} while they're laughing.\x{2014}Just to be clear, says Paula.She'd like to touch Denise right now. Just to prove to herself that she's real. To see if she could feel what's happening to her.\x{2014}Is the complete stranger the same fella you met at the parent-teacher meeting?\x{2014}Ah, yeah, says Denise.But it needn't be; it doesn't matter. That's what Denise is parading in front of them.Carmel's jabbing at the mobile. She holds it in one hand and presses the keys with a finger of the other. She brings the screen closer to her face. Then she stabs the Send button.\x{2014}So, she says. \x{2014}Denise?\x{2014}Yes, Carmel?Carmel's mobile buzzes again. It rattles on the table. She picks it up, brings it closer. She puts it back down.\x{2014}So. After you chatted.\x{2014}We said goodbye, just. He has a nice voice. Oh, and we swapped mobile numbers.\x{2014}What's his name?\x{2014}Thomas.\x{2014}Is that what you put in your phone book?\x{2014}Yeah, says Denise.She sits up.\x{2014}But I changed it after. In case.\x{2014}It fell into the wrong hands.\x{2014}Right; yeah.\x{2014}What did you change it to?\x{2014}School.It wouldn't have been Paula's choice. She could do much better than that. But then, she wouldn't have to hide the name. She'd have it, in lights, on her roof.Carmel shakes her head.\x{2014}What if Harry has to phone the school and he decides to use your phone?Harry is Denise's husband.Denise shrugs. It's very dramatic. A girl, to another girl. A lucky girl to a plain one.\x{2014}He'll find out, she says.\x{2014}Did he phone you the next time? says Paula. \x{2014}Your fella.She bites into a little quiche. They're nice, but too filling. Too \x{2013} a word Paula got from the radio \x{2013} toxic.They're still nice, though.\x{2014}Well, says Denise. \x{2014}I'm not actually finished with the first time.\x{2014}S, 1, u, t.\x{2014}We left at the same time. To the car park. Together, like. There was no reason not to.She looks at Paula.\x{2014}I was kind of hoping we'd be seen. Just to prove there was nothing. To myself, like.Paula nods. She understands. She knows all about fooling yourself.\x{2014}And we were parked near each other. And I was looking at his car.\x{2014}What is it?\x{2014}Honda Civic.\x{2014}Nice.\x{2014}Yeah. Grey. But he's changed it since.\x{2014}How long have you \x{2014} ?\x{2014}Three months, says Denise.\x{2014}Jesus, Denise. Why didn't you tell us?Denise shrugs.\x{2014}I'm not sure.That's fair enough, Paula thinks. I'm not sure. It's what Paula thinks a lot these days.\x{2014}Oh, I knew all along, says Carmel.It's another surprise. Carmel doesn't seem to care too much, all this going on without her approval. Maybe her sisters aren't as easily read as Paula thought. Maybe you have to be drunk to think you can understand other people, and yourself.\x{2014}So, anyway, she says. \x{2014}What happened?\x{2014}What? says Denise.\x{2014}The car park.\x{2014}Oh, says Denise. \x{2014}Yeah. Well. He put his hand on my shoulder and he kissed me.Carmel turns to Paula.\x{2014}Have you tried the little sausages, Paula?\x{2014}Delicious.\x{2014}And it was great, says Denise.She looks a bit annoyed now \x{2013} the interruptions.\x{2014}What then? says Carmel.\x{2014}Well\x{2014}\x{2014}Let me guess, says Carmel. \x{2014}It was love.\x{2014}Lay off, Carmel.\x{2014}You gave up the smokes there and then.\x{2014}No.\x{2014}And you joined the gym on your way home. So Thomas wouldn't lose his hands in the cheeks of your arse.She's hilarious. But there's an edge there now, in Carmel's voice. She's swinging away; she's had enough. The text message seems to have knocked her, whatever it was.\x{2014}Ha ha, says Denise.She sits up. Carmel sits up.Paula's annoyed. She wants to know what happened then, but she mightn't find out now.\x{2014}What about Harry? says Carmel.\x{2014}What about him? says Denise.The bitch. Harry's a bit of a dose but they've been married for twenty-five years. They suit each other. Paula's always thought that. He's reliable, kind, safe as a fuckin' house. They were made for each other.The bitch, Denise. She hasn't a clue.\x{2014}Does he know?Denise shrugs.\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Sure?\x{2014}Yeah. I don't \x{2013} nearly sure. I don't care.\x{2014}Yes, you do.\x{2014}I don't. I don't care.Carmel stands up. She goes to the kettle.\x{2014}What's wrong with poor Harry?Poor Harry. Carmel can't stand poor Harry.\x{2014}Nothing, says Denise.She looks at Paula.\x{2014}He's old.\x{2014}For fuck sake.\x{2014}In his head, I mean, says Denise. \x{2014}He's old.\x{2014}What age is he? says Carmel. \x{2014}Fifty what?The water drums the sink. Paula hears the kettle fill, the hiss, gush, water on water.\x{2014}Three, says Denise.\x{2014}Fifty-three's too old, is it?\x{2014}I told you. It's his head. He's boring. We never went anywhere.\x{2014}Went? Are you leaving him?\x{2014}Go; lay off. And no, I'm not leaving him. I don't know.\x{2014}And what age is the other fella?\x{2014}Fifty-one.\x{2014}A fuckin' toyboy.The kettle hits the counter like a hammer. Paula hears Carmel switch it on.\x{2014}He's great, says Denise, to Paula. \x{2014}He's different.\x{2014}Where were you? says Paula.Denise looks at her.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Earlier. You said. The complete stranger and that.\x{2014}Oh. Bewley's.\x{2014}Did he ride you on one of the tables?That's Carmel.The Bewley's cafes closed down months ago.\x{2014}The hotel, says Denise. \x{2014}Bewley's Hotel.Paula nods.\x{2014}Newland's Cross, says Denise.Paula doesn't know where that is. She's heard of it, on the radio; the young one with the traffic news, in the mornings. But she hasn't been there. It could be south or west. She doesn't know.\x{2014}What do you do? she says. \x{2014}Not \x{2013} I mean, that's your own business. But I mean, do you just go in and book a room?\x{2014}Jesus, Paula, says Carmel.\x{2014}I want to know, says Paula.\x{2014}Why?Because it's a brilliant thing to do and I've never fuckin' done it.\x{2014}I just do, she says.She looks at Denise.\x{2014}Over the phone, says Denise. \x{2014}That's the way I do it.\x{2014}For the night? Or a few hours?\x{2014}Oh, the night.\x{2014}Waste of money, says Carmel. \x{2014}Tea or coffee? Come on.\x{2014}Nothing for me, says Denise.\x{2014}The same, says Paula. \x{2014}I'm grand.\x{2014}For fuck sake, says Carmel.\x{2014}I couldn't just ask for a couple of hours, says Denise. \x{2014}I don't know if you can, anyway. I'd be too embarrassed.Paula nods.Carmel sits. She picks up her mobile. She looks at it.\x{2014}Are you going to tell Harry? says Paula.She'll ask the questions. It might keep Carmel off Denise; there's something going on there.\x{2014}I don't know, says Denise. \x{2014}I'm not in love with him or anything.\x{2014}Harry?\x{2014}No. Thomas.\x{2014}Oh.\x{2014}He's great and all.Paula nods. She feels it. She's racing against Carmel. She doesn't look at her.\x{2014}It's an adventure, says Denise.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula.Fuck you and your adventure.\x{2014}Nothing serious, so? she says.\x{2014}Oh, it's serious, says Denise. \x{2014}You can't do this and not be serious, Paula. D'you know what I mean?And Paula looks at Carmel.Carmel is crying.\x{2014}What's wrong?\x{2014}Oh, nothing, says Carmel. \x{2014}Sorry for interrupting you.\x{2014}What's wrong?\x{2014}Honest, Paula, says Carmel.She rubs the back of her hand across her eyes. She sighs, and rubs her eyes again.\x{2014}Honest to God now. I'd much rather listen to Denise than listen to myself just now.She looks at Denise.",

            "\x{2014}You're right, you know. It's an adventure. I could do with one. Where's the corkscrew?She's not crying now. She's Carmel again. She picks up the corkscrew.\x{2014}What's happened? says Paula.It's her turn. She can listen, maybe say something. She can help. She puts her hand on Carmel's shoulder.\x{2014}Hang on, says Carmel. \x{2014}Let me get the cork out here and then you can hug me.Carmel again. Hard, sarcastic, loving; the tough nut with the heart of gold. She'll need no help from Paula.\x{2014}I wasn't going to hug you.She's Paula again. There'll be no change. She's the one who needs the help. She doesn't give it. That's not what Paula does.Carmel fills her glass. Paula loves the sound. It would be lovely on a tape or CD.\x{2014}So, says Carmel. \x{2014}Poor Harry.Jack's in the kitchen when Paula gets home.\x{2014}Not in bed, Jack?Why does she say these stupid things? But it's <<after midnight|13>>. It's not stupid at all. She's asking him, gently, why he isn't in bed yet. Exactly what she should be asking, and exactly how.Jack doesn't answer. He's eating a bowl of cornflakes.They have the milk. They have the cornflakes, one of the huge boxes, nearly full. And it's two days to payday.\x{2014}Nothing wrong, no?\x{2014}No, says Jack.She looks at him. She believes him.\x{2014}Just hungry, he says.There's nothing wrong with one of her children. There's no need for concern or worry. He's healthy \x{2013} it's there, in his skin. He's content \x{2013} look at the way he's holding his spoon. He's hopping his foot. There's a song going on in his head as he eats. She'd love to ask him which one it is.He's self-aware. He's bright. He's gorgeous.She looks at Jack. She doesn't feel guilt. She'll never have to beg forgiveness.She'll lose him. He'll crumble away on her.Jesus, it's terrible.She remembers. She has asked him to forgive her. More than once. More than twice. They all come tumbling, all the times, one over another. Drunk and sober.It's fuckin' terrible. And it's funny. She sees that.\x{2014}Is Leanne in?\x{2014}Don't know.\x{2014}Fine.
She looks at the clock. She's in the kitchen. A minute left. She waits.It's <<ten-past four|10>>.She picks up the \x{e9}clair. She licks the cream out of it.She watches herself. It's fuckin' stupid.But.She bites into the chocolate, and the pastry that's been softened by the cream.Jack's not home yet. Leanne's at work. Paula will be leaving, herself, in a bit.She's a year off the drink. Exactly a year.She looks at the clock.A year and a minute.
She likes to start in the kitchen. Especially in the winter. She's not supposed to. Dympna told her to start at the top of the house and work her way down. But she doesn't. Dympna plays golf or something when Paula's in the house. Paula has her own key.\x{2014}Dympna?Paula stands in the hall. She closes the door.\x{2014}Dympna?She listens. She hears nothing. She's alone.The kitchen is warm. The radio's on. Marian Finnucane. She's interviewing some women when Paula comes in and starts listening. They're the McCartney women, the sisters of the man who was murdered by the IRA in Belfast a few weeks ago. There's a note on the table. Hi Paula. Any chance of defrosting fridge? Many thanks. D. The money is under the note. Seventy euro. Paula puts it away, into her pocket. She puts on the kettle. She unplugs the fridge. It's an old one, much smaller than her own. She empties it. She puts everything on the table. It's not too bad. There's not much in it. Nothing gooey or half-alive. There are a few old vegetables in the bottom. Old carrots, spuds with hair. She drags the bin over and dirows them in. There's a compost heap out the back but it's cold out there and it's warm in here.They've three coffee plungers. Four-cup, two-cup, one-cup. In a row, on the counter, against the wall tiles. The handles all point the same way, a bit like the cranes she sees every day from the window of the Dart. She takes the one-cup. She pours in some of the hot water from the kettle. She rolls it around in the plunger. She has all the moves. She pours out the water. There's a black plastic scoop in the coffee jar. She gives herself two scoops, into the plunger. She fills it with the water. She puts the plunger itself on the top, like a lid. The smell takes over the room. The outside cold is out of her nose.The McCartney women are great. She hadn't noticed their brother's murder when it happened. There are so many murders. A murder in Limerick, a murder in Cork. Every day, it seems like. A murder in Dublin \x{2013} she'll listen, to see if she knows the place where it happened. She heard Charlo's name on one of those news reports, when he murdered a woman and then got himself shot by the Guards. She's been through it. She used to listen out for John Paul's name. A young boy out there, with junkies, gangsters, unfortunates. Found dead. By the river, down a lane. She'd relax, she'd move again when they started on the sports results or the weather. But a murder in Belfast. The first part of the word \x{2013} Bel \x{2013} she's not listening any more. Only the really awful murders get through, like that child in Cork or the girl, Rachel, in north Dublin, whose husband was arrested and let go. She's not sure what happened there. And that just proves it. Five miles from her house, she doesn't know what happened.She didn't see Leanne this morning. She'd had to get out of the house early, to do a job, a once-off, in Sutton. A family moving back in, after the builders had moved out. Paula cleaned their new extension. She washed the floors and walls. It was cushy enough, just cement dust. She left when the removals truck arrived.She can still feel the cement in her mouth. She pats her shoulder. She watches the dust. She's taken it out of one house, and dumped it in another. Cleaning the same dust twice in one morning. It's mad.She has to know where Leanne is. All the time. She's on her own here, but she's never alone. And it's not just Leanne. Her children are all around her, all their different ages and faces. She has four, divided into thousands. There are so many Leannes. She sees and feels hundreds of her, every day \x{2013} it's no exaggeration. The little girl clutching Paula's leg. The teenager painting nail varnish onto bleeding skin. The baby crying while her mammy tries to crawl under the cot. The wreck on the couch. The young woman hobbling to work. The little girl who never sits still, who makes everyone laugh. The little girl who wets the bed. The teenager who wets the bed. The woman who wets the bed. They're all there, all day. The young woman she'll see tomorrow morning. The skinny monster she might see tomorrow morning. The girl who hugs her. The woman who hit her. Jesus.And John Paul. The little boy in his communion gear, counting his money. The boy with the flu, with a pair of cold, wet underpants on his forehead, to cool him out of the fever, water trickling into his eyes; the two of them laughing about it. The boy on the hospital trolley. The boy at the table, doing his homework. The baby, just born, lowered to her breast \x{2013} We've a boy here, Mrs Spencer. The boy who didn't come home. The hole there, the cancer; the fuckin' little bastard. The junkie. The waster. The hope; the absence. The stranger at the door. The man. The father. The recovering addict. The boy who flew around, shouting and roaring. The man who stays still. The boy she couldn't ever stop hugging. The man she hasn't touched.It's fuckin' exhausting.There are other Nicolas. There are other Jacks. All there, too. Climbing all over her, prodding and patting and biting.She knows nothing about Leanne. She used to. She's sure she did. The happy ache, watching her move and think and eat, and all of it. Two years ago. Less. It was there, the love. She could lean in closer. Even when there was drink on the breath. It was harmless; she was growing up.What happened?What happens?The McCartney murder won't go away. Paula knows all about it now. She's seen pictures of the pub where it started. She's seen the lane beside the pub where he was killed. He was from the Short Strand area, in Belfast. She hears the name. She's not sure if she knew it before. It sounds like North Strand, in Dublin. That makes it seem familiar. She's seen pictures of Robert McCartney's kids. She's seen his partner. She's there with the sisters, with Marian Finnucane.There's hardly anything in the freezer. A couple of bits of \x{2013} it looks like salmon, in a plastic bag; salmon steaks. She's never had salmon that way, only smoked. She's had that a few times, at weddings. She's not mad about fish. It's good for you but she doesn't like it. She remembers her mother gutting mackerel. She'd haul the guts out with her finger. It frightened Paula. That was why she watched. She thought her mother was amazing. Paula will never do it. But she might give salmon steaks a go. She rubs ice off the plastic. These steaks look solid and meaty. She could like them, she thinks. She's seen them in the supermarket. She knows where to find them.There's a pizza and half a bag of garden peas. And fish fingers, way at the back. They don't put up much of a fight. It's just the ice she has to hack. Paula's fridge at home defrosts automatically. She'll tell Dympna about it the next time she sees her.She presses down the coffee plunger. Her thumb aches, all the bones on that side of her hand. But she kind of likes this one. She can worry it without going back through the years. The pain is new, like the duvets and Jack's computer. She earned it. She knows that as she works. She can feel it charge and recede as she holds brush and mop handles, as she gets the lid off the disinfectant.A thought drops through her. Richie Massey will be getting out of jail.Richie Massey is the man who did the job with Charlo. Paula doesn't know him. She'd never heard of him until she began to find out what had happened that day. She's never even seen him, except on the telly, going into court. Even then, he had a jacket over his head.She chooses a white mug.What if he comes looking for her?Another ring on the bell.She pours. She gets the milk from where she left it on the table. It's a lovely table, very light wood. Blond, she thinks it's called. It's the centre of the kitchen. You can't help looking at it all the time. There's always stuff lying on it. Bills, schoolbooks, toys. She likes the mess. They must just shove the stuff out of the way when they're eating. Dympna never leaves the breakfast things for Paula. They're always in the dishwasher.Richard 'Richie' Massey. That's the way his name was given in the Herald and the other papers. He'll be out soon; he'd have to be. He didn't kill anyone, he wasn't armed \x{2013} it's twelve years ago. But there's no reason why he'd come after Paula. Charlo wasn't living at home when it happened. He'd been gone for more than a year. And it's not like they've been sharing a cell. Drop in on the missis, Richie. Make sure she's behaving herself. There's no story there at all. Charlo died immediately. Tell her I love her, Richie.She sniffs the milk. It's grand. Dympna would be fuckin' stunned if she saw Paula sniffing her milk.He might be out already. There's no real reason why she'd know. There's no one to tell her. He could walk past her today and she wouldn't recognise him.She pours. Her hand is steady. Brown sugar. There's no other kind here. Paula doesn't use the brown at home. It hardens too quickly. It's like breaking cement.She stirs. She sips. That's great.She goes back to the freezer. She listens as she hacks. The women are talking about living in their part of Belfast. A Padre Pio is a bullet through the hand. Or the knee. She's not sure; it's been said before she fully takes it in. Probably the hand. Jesus though \x{2013} enough.But she doesn't turn off the radio. It would be too violent, turning off those voices. She leaves them on. She thinks, They'd listen to me. It's true. They probably would.In another of her houses, they've a huge freezer, as well as the one that comes on top of the fridge. It's colossal, like a supermarket shelf stretched out on its back. She looks in it now and again. But she's never been asked to defrost it. She wouldn't anyway. It'd be too big a job, way beyond the call of duty. She always thinks of Christopher Lee when she lifts the lid. The cold lifts up, around her. It's like a tangle of bodies. Legs of lamb \x{2013} she thinks. Huge slabs of darker meat. Deer, maybe \x{2013} she's never had it. All packed in thick plastic. It's like forensic evidence, put there till the trial. It's too much, really. Paula wouldn't have it.Charlo and Richie Massey went to a house in Malahide. The house belonged to a bank manager, Kevin Fleming, and his wife, Gwen.Paula's been there, where the house is. She went out on the bus, just to see. To kind of \x{2013} she doesn't know. She's never been really sure why she went. Mr Fleming was fifty-three when it happened. He's probably retired now, maybe married again. Living in Spain, or somewhere. That's why Paula went that time. To see that life went on, that her husband hadn't torn it away completely.They pushed their way into the house, with a shotgun and balaclavas. It was <<eight o'clock in the morning|6>>. Richie Massey and Mr Fleming then went in Mr Fleming's car. They were going to Mr Fleming's bank while Charlo held Mrs Fleming, with the shotgun.He shot her. He killed her.The Guards were onto them. There was a roadblock waiting for Richie Massey. And they came over the back wall of the house, for Charlo. He shot her. He ran. He ran to the stolen car Richie Massey had parked across the green from the Flemings' house. He jumped in. He remembered \x{2013} did he? Was he that thick? It dawned on him. He couldn't drive. He tried to get out of the car. Holding the shotgun. Aiming it. They shot him.She sits at the table. She takes out her notebook. Soap, washing liquid.She sees her children in a list. Jack, Nicola, Leanne, John Paul. In that order, down the page. It's wrong. It's reasonable, but it's wrong. What she wants to do is change the list. The names in the same order, but across the page. That's how she wants it. Like a horse race, about to begin. Starter's orders. But there'll be no winner, because the race won't start.Can she do that?Yes.No.Yes \x{2013} she doesn't know. She wants to. More than anything. That's true.But today. That's where it's hard. Where it's horrible. She dragged them all through shite, for years, all four of them. So there's a kind of equality there. But today she can point at Jack and she can say, That's my son. And she can point at Nicola and say, Over there. That's my daughter. You should see her children. See the car? It came with her job. She passed the test the first time. Paula could go on for hours. You wouldn't think it, would you? She's my daughter.Paula gave birth to Nicola. She's her mother's daughter. It's thrilling. Despite the circumstances, the drink, the beatings, a big part of Paula survived \x{2013} there, every time she sees Nicola. And Jack. It's not just love. It is love. She loves them; she loves herself. She made them.She was walking past a kids' clothes shop, a few weeks ago. In one of the shopping centres. She went with Rita Kavanagh. She didn't buy anything. She'd no money. Thirteen euro, sixty cent was what she had. They were walking past, and they stopped. They pointed at what they liked, what they'd like to get for their grandchildren. But what hit Paula was the name of the shop, Pride and Joy. Those words, together. It was exactly what she felt when she saw Jack or Nicola.They didn't go into the shop. Rita knows the story. They were just there to look.\x{2014}It's the first thing I noticed, Rita said that day. \x{2014} The first sign that the country was changing.\x{2014}What was that? said Paula.\x{2014}The clothes shops for kids, said Rita.Paula nodded.\x{2014}They were the proof, said Rita. \x{2014}People had more money than they needed. It's great.Paula nodded. She agreed.\x{2014}I noticed them before all the new cars, said Rita. \x{2014} And the talk about house prices. Even all the cranes.\x{2014}Jesus, Rita, said Paula. \x{2014}All I noticed was the price of vodka going up.She can say that to Rita. She can joke and be serious.The kitchen's done. She's turned off the radio. Marian Finnucane is over. Pat Kenny was talking to Des Cahill, about the sports. Two men trying to outdo each other. It's too early in the day for that.She'll finish her list, then get going on the bedrooms. Butter, plain flour, eggs. She's making pancakes for tomorrow's tea. Tomorrow's tea. She's thinking ahead. Chicken pieces \x{2013} for Jack's sandwiches. Bananas, apples, carrots. Salmon steaks \x{2013} she'll have a look at them. Mince \x{2013} for Leanne. She loves spaghetti bolognaise. Spaghetti, tin toms, onions.Can she point at Leanne and say, That's my daughter? Or at John Paul. That's my son.Pride and joy. Shame and fear.She has to put the biro down. She rubs her hand. It's hurting her. She thinks of her mother's hands and swollen legs.She loves her children.That's easy to think. Easy to believe and say. Of course, she does. She loves them.But she has to be able to point. That's my daughter. That's my son. There has to be pride.Who'd want to point at Paula and shout, That's my mother? There's no reason why any of her kids would do that. She has no right to expect it.She doesn't expect it. It's the world that goes on in her head. The conversations she has, the situations she makes up. It's in her head she needs to say, That's my daughter. To someone she might not know, who might not even exist. She needs to feel the honesty, when she's alone. It's herself she has to fight against, not Leanne or John Paul. They're innocent. Leanne doesn't have to pass any tests. She doesn't have to do anything. Leanne is Leanne. That's what Paula has to accept and love. The Leanne she'll meet later today. Or the Leanne who might not come home. Leanne tomorrow morning. That's my daughter.Maybe Leanne has John Paul's strength. Whatever it is that John Paul has. He's been talking to Leanne; she knows that. Two years ago \x{2013} last year \x{2013} she'd have thought he was supplying her with heroin or something. She doesn't know him.She's changed all the beds. She's put the first wash into the machine. Dympna's well ahead of her there. Her washing machine is much better than Paula's. But that's not saying much. Paula's should be on top of the dump, in County Meath or wherever they throw those things. Dympna's is a space-age job. It's almost silent. And the powder doesn't congeal in the tray. Dympna's dryer is the real thing though, even better than the washing machine. It knows when the clothes are dry. It keeps going until they are. And it's always right. Paula has tried to catch it out. She threw in a wet pillowcase, just when the other bedclothes were dry. The machine kept going, the pillowcase was dry when it stopped and Paula took it out and ironed it.That's my daughter. That's my son.They're fighting, and losing. They're fighting and winning. Like Paula.Leanne loves bolognaise. The salmon can wait. Paula will do bolognaise for tonight. She'll leave it for Leanne. She'll leave a note with it.Love, Mammy.Love, Paula.X, Mammy.X x, Paula.Xxxxxxx, P.Something like that. Just a little note. Dinner's in the pot. I'll eat with you, if you can wait till I get home. If not, fire away.Xxxxxx, P.Leanne sitting at the kitchen table. Ruling her page with a red biro. Only a red biro would do. She wouldn't make do with a blue one or a pencil. Paula had to give her the money to get one. About twenty pence back then. The line was perfectly straight. Behind all the giddiness, the restlessness, that was Leanne. Slogging away. Working hard. Concentrating. It was funny and lovely. And brilliant. That was Leanne.That's Leanne.That's my daughter.
\x{2014}Mammy says you don't drink.\x{2014}Does she?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Did she tell you that?\x{2014}No. I heard her.\x{2014}Did you?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Who was she talking to, pet?\x{2014}My daddy.\x{2014}Grand.\x{2014}Do you not?\x{2014}Do I not drink?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}No. I don't.\x{2014}How do you not die?\x{2014}Oh. I drink. I drink plenty of things.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Water and coffee and \x{2014}\x{2014}Coke?\x{2014}Sometimes.\x{2014}I seen you drinking Coke.\x{2014}I'm sure you did, love. Do you like this one?\x{2014}It's alright. I don't like the colour.\x{2014}I thought all girls loved pink.\x{2014}Not all pink. It's alright. It's a bit not nice. Gillian's.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}You drank her Coke.\x{2014}This one then? It's nicer.\x{2014}No. Why did you drink it?\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Gillian's Coke.\x{2014}At the party?\x{2014}Yeah. Gillian's party.\x{2014}I drank Gillian's Coke at Gillian's party. I shouldn't have, should I?\x{2014}No. You didn't ask.\x{2014}I just took a little bit. There was loads more left.\x{2014}You didn't ask.\x{2014}I'm really sorry.\x{2014}It wasn't mine.\x{2014}Will I say sorry to Gillian?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Was she upset when I drank it?\x{2014}No. She didn't know.\x{2014}Ah well \x{2014}\x{2014}I seen you.\x{2014}Fair enough. I must have been thirsty. Grannies are, sometimes.\x{2014}Why did Mammy say that?\x{2014}Well \x{2014}\x{2014}I know.\x{2014}I knew you would, Vanessa.\x{2014}You don't drink beer and that.\x{2014}That's right.\x{2014}It's called alcohol.\x{2014}That's right.\x{2014}I knew.\x{2014}Of course, you did. What about this? It's nice, isn't it?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Do you want it?\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Why not?\x{2014}Don't like it.\x{2014}Okay. Your choice. Some people shouldn't drink beer and alcohol.\x{2014}Why not?\x{2014}Because it's bad for them. They become addicted to it. D'you know what that means?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Of course, you do.\x{2014}You can't do without it.\x{2014}That's right.\x{2014}You become ob-sessed.\x{2014}Oh, very good.\x{2014}Like chocolate.\x{2014}A bit like that.\x{2014}Yeah. Some people are addicted to chocolate.\x{2014}That's right.\x{2014}And sex.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}I seen that. A man in a programme.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}They said he was addicted to sex.\x{2014}Oh. Before you ask, Vanessa. I'm not.\x{2014}Addicted to sex?\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Sex is stupid.\x{2014}Bang on. But I am addicted to alcohol. That's what your mammy meant.\x{2014}I know.\x{2014}I love you, Vanessa, d'you know that?\x{2014}They all do.\x{2014}They're alright. It's a nice feeling, I'd say, is it?\x{2014}It's alright.\x{2014}Tell us. Do you know everything?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Everything?\x{2014}Yeah. Nearly.\x{2014}Look it. I want to buy you something. It's getting late. Choose something.\x{2014}These.\x{2014}Socks?\x{2014}They're brilliant.\x{2014}They're only socks.\x{2014}I like them.\x{2014}Okay.\x{2014}That's stupid.\x{2014}What is?\x{2014}What you said.\x{2014}What did I say?\x{2014}They're only socks.\x{2014}Why is that stupid?\x{2014}Socks aren't supposed to be anything.\x{2014}Except socks.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}You'll go far, love.\x{2014}Where?\x{2014}Oh, anywhere you want.\x{2014}Australia?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}I don't want to go there.\x{2014}Wherever.\x{2014}Granny?

She leans against the wall. It's cold.She's waiting for her bus.The house was empty. The minute she opened the door, she knew there was something wrong. The door didn't drag across the rug.There was no rug. There was nothing. Everything was gone. Everything.She'd kept going. Down to the kitchen.This is Paula's Tuesday house, in Clontarf.There wasn't a trace of anything. The emptiness was spotless. The thought hit Paula. They'd had cleaners in, to clean up after them. The fuckers.Gone.It's that time of day. The buses seem to hide. She wants to get home.It's cold.They didn't owe her anything. It's not that. The money had been on the kitchen table for her last week. She hardly knew them. She hardly ever saw them. She was American, the wife; that bouncy type of way about her. She'd never seen the husband. But she'd ironed his shirts and sorted his socks.Three years. Near enough.There's no For Sale sign. There's no sign of anything.She has the key.She could move in.She feels like she's been sacked. It's not fair.It's a good story though. She'll enjoy telling it. She won't add anything. It's weird enough.She needs the money. Sixty euro a week, always on the table.There's no table there now.For fuck sake.She still has the key, and the alarm code.She gets away from the wall. She looks up the road. She can see as far as the wooden bridge. No bus.She walks back to the house. It's not far. Just around the corner. She walks up the drive. It feels strange, now that she knows the house is empty. Like she's doing something she shouldn't be doing. Her feet on the gravel. She gets to the door. She takes out the keys. She puts them through the letterbox. She hears them hit the floor.
Leanne's asleep. She's quiet. She's not snoring. She's on her side. Her head is on the pillow.Paula leans over, a little more. She kisses Leanne's temple. She feels the warmth, and the slight wetness. The sweat she'd had when she was a little girl, after running or dancing. Not drops, just a glow.She straightens up. Her back is at her. She goes across to her own room.
She looks at Nicola. She doesn't look great.She does. She looks lovely. But behind it, the face she wears when she's out in the world, she looks very tired. There are small wrinkles at her eyes.Paula's the mother of a child with wrinkles.\x{2014}Did you get my message? says Nicola.She has that voice \x{2013} you're going to disappoint me. Paula could do without it.\x{2014}No, she says. \x{2014}I forgot the mobile this morning. It's up beside the bed.Nicola sighs.Paula knows. She's expected to say Sorry. But she's not going to. It's only a fuckin' phone, and she has wrinkles of her own.\x{2014}What did it say? she asks.\x{2014}I just wanted to know if you'd be here.Nicola hangs her bag from the back of the chair.\x{2014}Well, there's no need for me to leg it upstairs, so.\x{2014}No.Nicola sits down.\x{2014}Are you alright, love?The edge is gone out of Paula. It's a long time since she looked down at Nicola's head. It's a long time since Nicola let her.\x{2014}I'm fine, she says.\x{2014}You don't look fine.Nicola looks at Paula. She looks up at her.\x{2014}You look tired, says Paula.\x{2014}I'm always tired.\x{2014}I know, says Paula. \x{2014}The kids, your job.Nicola shrugs.\x{2014}It's life, she says.\x{2014}You're right, says Paula.She pulls back a chair, so she can face Nicola. She sits.\x{2014}Anything else?Nicola shakes her head, once.\x{2014}No.She doesn't look away. She looks straight back at Paula \x{2013} go no further.Paula smiles.She's not to be trusted. Nicola looks after Paula, not the other way round.She puts her hand on Nicola's. Her hand is cool, beautiful. She squeezes gently.
She wakes up. She's out of bed. She's downstairs. She's picking up the kettle. It's a ton \x{2013} she feels it in her wrist. It's not even that, the pain in her thumb, her hand, beginning to eat further along her arm.It's not that.It's \x{2014}She doesn't know.She doesn't sit. She has to move.It's a day to skip. But that's no cure \x{2013} go back to bed, go back to sleep, wake up feeling better. It's on her already.It's drink-pain. Half-seven in the morning. A drink would help. Just the one.That's the worst part. The honesty of it. A drink would help. There's no arguing. Thirteen months, two days \x{2013} she can feel die certainty.Leanne wakes up.\x{2014}What're you doing? Ma?She's looking under Leanne's bed. She's stretching, hoping her fingers will touch a bottle, a can.\x{2014}Ma?Her fingers expect it.She hears the creak. She doesn't look or stop. Leanne's getting out of the bed. She has to step over Paula.\x{2014}What are you doing there?She feels the hands on her shoulders. She shrugs them off. She pushes an elbow back. She pushes her other hand further under the bed. Her face is pressed into the side of the mattress.\x{2014}Mammy?She feels something. It goes from her fingers. She's pushed it away. She stretches further. It hurts. Her face cuts into the bed frame. She has it. A can. She has it.She has it.She pushes back, against Leanne's legs. She makes space for herself. She puts the can to her mouth. She knows, but she does it.It's empty.She can taste it, dried, on the lip of the can. She can taste \x{2013} it's nothing. Nothing there to lick.She pushes back, into Leanne. She wants to hurt her, to knock her over. Get her throat, get at her eyes.\x{2014}Have you anything else?\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Fuckin' liar.\x{2014}I don't.She grabs Leanne's legs. She feels them bend, Leanne's weight falling on her. She's shouting. No words \x{2013} she's grunting. Leanne falls over her head. She's stuck between the bed and Paula, half on Paula's lap. She's hissing, gasping. She's terrified. The bitch. The selfish \x{2014}Light.A change; the angle.The door has moved.It's Jack.She tries to stand. Paula's stuck. Leanne is on her lap. Her feet under her arse \x{2013} they're twisted, and numb.It screams through her now.Jack \x{2014}It's always there but sometimes \x{2013} now \x{2013} the shame is enough to kill her.She hits Leanne. She thumps her; she feels it in her hand.\x{2014}Get off me!He's outside, on the landing. He might be \x{2013} he is.She pushes.The shame.She pushes Leanne off her lap. There's no weight in Leanne. She isn't fighting back. Paula doesn't care. She has to get up. And downstairs. She can start again. Put on the kettle. Start the day.She feels wet on her hand. She feels teeth.Leanne bites her. Nips her. Like a pup they once had, before Jack was born. Like a warning.The teeth are gone. Leanne is coughing. Paula can't see her. She's right under the bed.Paula puts her hands on the bed and pushes back. She gets her feet from under her. She watches Leanne crawl out. She can't see her face.She leans to the side. She can see out to the landing. Jack isn't there. There's no shadow or breath.\x{2014}Jack?God, God, let him be asleep. He's such a deep sleeper. If a drink was put in front of her now she wouldn't want it. She wouldn't take it.She's over it. She's grand. She's embarrassed \x{2013} Leanne is sitting up \x{2013} she's mortified. But she's grand. Her breath, she's puffing \x{2013} she's sweating \x{2013} her forehead is soaking, her neck. Just give her a second chance.They're knee to knee, like two little sisters, playing on the bedroom floor. It's ridiculous.\x{2014}Sorry.\x{2014}Okay.\x{2014}Sorry.She means it. She thinks she does. She'll get up in a sec. She'll look into Jack's room. He'll be asleep. She'll go back downstairs. She'll put his waffles in the toaster. She'll make her coffee. She'll make tea for Leanne.The can is beside them on the floor. A can of Dutch Gold. The shine is off the tin. She can see a dent. It's been empty a long time.\x{2014}Are you drinking again? says Leanne.Again.Paula hates that fuckin' word.\x{2014}No, she says.\x{2014}But \x{2014} ?Leanne nods at the can.\x{2014}You got there before me, love, says Paula. \x{2014}Thanks.If that sounds malicious she couldn't care less. She knows what's happening.Her mammy's protector. Leave my mammy alone.Can a child ever stop? Paula can't face it. It's so fuckin' horrible. The shame; sweet Jesus.Leanne will stop drinking now. She won't touch another drop, so she can look after her mammy. She has Paula where she wants her. Where she knows her.The house isn't big enough for two alcoholic women. One needs to look at the other, from a height, from a depth. They both need the love that's given to those who hate themselves. Jesus, it's poison. It's only beginning.She breathes in. She breathes out.Is this the way she'll save Leanne? Find a bottle and put it to her mouth. Pull back her head. And Leanne will be saved.\x{2014}Leanne, she says.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}I'm not going back.Leanne says nothing.\x{2014}You woke up in time, says Paula.\x{2014}It was empty, an'anyway.\x{2014}I'd've kept looking. I'd have gone out.\x{2014}There's nowhere open at this hour.\x{2014}You know what I mean, love.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}It's not going to happen.She wants to see Jack.She stays where she is. She makes sure her knees are touching Leanne's.\x{2014}Mad, wha'.Leanne nods.\x{2014}I'm grand, says Paula.Leanne nods.\x{2014}Thanks, says Paula.Her legs are killing her. She hasn't sat like this in years.\x{2014}I'm fine, she says. \x{2014}Do you believe me?What happens now?Leanne nods, two sharp nods.Will Leanne go on the rampage? Jesus, the shame. It swims through her all day. A shark. Waiting for blood. Relaxed and smug, never hungry for long.\x{2014}I have to get up, says Paula. \x{2014}My arse is killing me. Jack must think we're mad.\x{2014}Nothing new there, says Leanne.It hurts. It's not meant to, but it does. Jack knows. Jack knows. Jack has grown up knowing. Jack smells her breath, every day. Every morning, every lunchtime. Jack checks. Always on his best behaviour, always at the ready.\x{2014}Anyway, says Paula.She gets ready to stand.\x{2014}Jesus.She can't get up. One of her legs is dead. She's so confused, she doesn't know which one. She laughs; it's not funny. She puts out her hand.\x{2014}Give us a hand.She feels Leanne's hand. She feels the pull, the strength, the rough skin.She's on her feet. She shakes the leg. The left. She laughs.\x{2014}Yoga, Leanne.\x{2014}What about it?\x{2014}What's it like?\x{2014}How would I know?\x{2014}Would you be into it?\x{2014}Don't know, says Leanne. \x{2014}Maybe.\x{2014}There might be classes, says Paula. \x{2014}Will I find out?Leanne shrugs.\x{2014}I suppose so; yeah.\x{2014}Mad, isn't it? says Paula.Leanne nods.\x{2014}One minute I want a drink. The next, I want to go to fuckin' India.\x{2014}I'm sure there are classes nearer than that.\x{2014}Will I put the kettle on for you?\x{2014}Yeah; thanks.\x{2014}This is mad, says Paula. \x{2014}I can't cope with it. Pretending. I'm sorry I hit you. I'm sorry.Leanne gets it right. She says nothing.\x{2014}Can we talk about it later? says Paula.Leanne nods.\x{2014}Okay; yeah. Will I stay at home?\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Okay.\x{2014}I'm grand.Jesus. She's grand. Nothing to it.\x{2014}See you downstairs.\x{2014}Okay; yeah.Jack isn't asleep. He isn't in bed. He isn't in his room.He heard it all. He must have. She can still feel Leanne's skin in her hand.She hears a footstep. He's in the kitchen.\x{2014}Hiya, Jack.\x{2014}Hi.He's having his cornflakes standing up. He doesn't look at her. The elbows of his jumper are nearly gone. She can see the white of his shirt.\x{2014}D'you want your waffles?\x{2014}I'm grand, he says.Jesus Christ, they're all fuckin' grand.\x{2014}Won't take a minute, she says.Please, please God.\x{2014}Okay.He's in no hurry to escape. He mustn't have heard. The day has started. She'll run to work. She'll run all the way.But there's no work. It's Tuesday. That empty house in Clontarf; it's not hers to go to. She doesn't have a new one yet.She takes the waffles from the freezer. There are eight left in the box, and three more days to payday. She's two waffles ahead. She'll leave them to Jack in her will.She drops them into the toaster. One of them sticks to her finger, the cold. She has to shake it off. She puts the finger into her mouth. She presses down the toaster's lever.\x{2014}There, she says. \x{2014}What sort of a day have you, Jack?He shrugs. She takes back one of the spare waffles and puts it aside for Leanne. To my loving daughter, Leanne, I also leave a waffle. There'll be no fighting at the funeral.\x{2014}The usual, says Jack. \x{2014}Nothing much.\x{2014}Same ol' shite, she says.She's trying too hard.He smiles. He shrugs.\x{2014}Did I tell you about that house being empty, when I went there a few weeks ago? she says.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Did I?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Mad.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Can you imagine it? Coming home from work or something. And finding the house empty.Of course, he can. He probably expects it, every day of his life.\x{2014}Maybe you'd like it that way, she says.He smiles \x{2013} he shrugs.\x{2014}You'd cope, she says.Why is she doing this? Leave him alone.\x{2014}Did you hear Leanne and myself up there?Leanne and myself. Not Myself and Leanne. She's blaming Leanne.\x{2014}It was my fault, she says.He says nothing.\x{2014}It was stupid, she says. \x{2014}It was nothing.She hears Leanne on the stairs.\x{2014}It's grand, she says.The toaster pops. Jack's looking at his bowl.\x{2014}Okay?He nods; he doesn't look.\x{2014}I'm fine, she says. \x{2014}Okay?\x{2014}Okay.It's horrible, cornering him like this. But it's the only \x{2013} it's the right way. She's sure of that. No hiding.\x{2014}It's hard, she says.He nods. He still isn't looking.She puts the waffles on a plate.\x{2014}But I'm grand, she says.Leanne walks in.She's forgotten the kettle, Leanne's tea.It's hard.Leanne looks twitchy. She's pulling at her top, pulling her hair. She's never still.Paula says nothing. She gets the kettle and brings it to the tap. She empties the old water, fills it with new. She brings it back and turns it on.\x{2014}Did you hear about that woman? she asks the two of them.\x{2014}What woman? says Leanne.\x{2014}In America, says Paula. \x{2014}It was on the News.\x{2014}What about her?\x{2014}She's on a life-support machine.\x{2014}I know how she feels.Jack laughs.What a strange fuckin' day. It's swinging all over the place.\x{2014}And she's been like that for fifteen years.\x{2014}Jesus.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula. \x{2014}Anyway. D'you want a waffle, Leanne?\x{2014}No; thanks.\x{2014}Sure?\x{2014}Don't like them.\x{2014}Did you hear about it, Jack?\x{2014}Yeah, he says. \x{2014}We did it in Religion.\x{2014}What do you think?Leanne rescues Jack.\x{2014}What does he think about what?\x{2014}Well, her husband wants the machine turned off.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}But her parents want her kept on it.\x{2014}After fifteen years?\x{2014}Yeah, I know. But it must be hard. Anyway, it's gone to the courts and everything.\x{2014}And what happened?\x{2014}Well, the Congress or something, the Senate, passed an emergency law and I'm not sure what that's about. But it's real American. You know. All over the telly. People with placards, screaming and roaring.\x{2014}It'd be the same here, says Leanne.\x{2014}Would it?\x{2014}Yeah. The Pro-Lifers and that. They're mad cunts.\x{2014}Ah, Leanne.\x{2014}Well, they are.\x{2014}What do you think, Jack?He looks at the clock. He's afraid of being wrong. He doesn't want to upset her. It's why he's such a good kid. He's afraid to be anything else. He's grown up minding Paula. He's her slave. She knows it now.\x{2014}Well, says Paula. \x{2014}All I'll say, if it happens to me I want you to turn off the machine.\x{2014}Where's the fuckin' plug?That's Leanne.Paula laughs. They're all laughing, all able to look at one another. It's mad. It's the best moment of her life. It probably is. She looks at Jack and Leanne, still laughing. She can wipe her eyes. It's all fuckin' mad.
Her mother's hands are twisted and savage. It's the same at every corner of her body. She's shaking. She never stops shaking. And she's shrunk. She's a small woman now, much smaller than she used to be. She sleeps in a bed downstairs. She hasn't gone upstairs in more than a year. She never goes out. She can't. She won't.But it's not her body. It's the whinge. It was never there before. Paula can't stand it. This is the first time she's seen her since just after Christmas.Her mother is furious, but not at Paula \x{2013} not just at Paula. She's spitting at everything. Young people, old people, the country, the world. Her daughters, her sons. She smacks the huge, red knuckle of her wrist. She wants to hurt herself.There are clear moments, like now. They're longer than moments. They're long enough to fool Paula. She wonders if her mother is playing with them. Fooling them all.\x{2014}That's a lovely-looking day out there, says her mother.She's looking out the window.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula. \x{2014}It's a real spring day.Whatever that is.\x{2014}The flowers coming up.\x{2014}That's right, says Paula.\x{2014}It's my favourite, says her mother. \x{2014}I was never mad about the summers. But spring. I often thought it would have been great to live somewhere where it was really cold in the winter. Russia or Canada. Just to wait for the spring. The heat and the flowers. Wouldn't that be nice, Paula?\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula. \x{2014}It would. The winter, though.\x{2014}Oh, I know, says her mother. \x{2014}But that mightn't be too bad either.Her hands are forgotten, the pain, the rubbing. They're on her lap. She's not an old woman. Not these days. She was only a kid when she was having her own kids.\x{2014}The snow and that, she says. \x{2014}That would be lovely too. Chestnuts. Isn't it chestnuts they eat?\x{2014}Yeah, I think so.\x{2014}Did you ever eat a chestnut, Carmel?There's nothing in her face. She's talking to Carmel; she's talking to Paula.\x{2014}No, says Paula. \x{2014}I don't think I'd like them.\x{2014}No, says her mother. \x{2014}It's hard to imagine. Conkers. Do boys still play with conkers?She looks at the window again. She moves her head slightly, as if she's listening to children outside. Paula can't hear anything.\x{2014}No, says Paula. \x{2014}I don't think so.\x{2014}Your Jack. He doesn't?\x{2014}He'd be too old.\x{2014}Would he?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}I never see him, of course. Did you come in your car?\x{2014}I don't have a car.\x{2014}I thought you had a car.\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Who has the car?Fuckin' everyone.\x{2014}That's probably Carmel.\x{2014}Yes. Carmel.She doesn't look, to check who she's talking to.\x{2014}And Denise.\x{2014}Yes.Your daughter, Mammy. She goes to hotels in her car and fucks men.\x{2014}And Wendy.\x{2014}Wendy's dead, Mammy.\x{2014}I know that. I know well she's dead.The hands are moving again.\x{2014}She was the best of you.Paula nods. She doesn't disagree.The window's gone. Her mother isn't looking at it any more.\x{2014}Would you be interested in going outside, Mammy?She's too late. She knows.\x{2014}For a few minutes, just? she says.\x{2014}They put their rubbish in the bin, says her mother.\x{2014}Who?\x{2014}The foreigners.\x{2014}What foreigners?She doesn't know why she's asking. It keeps the flak off her. The foreigners can take their share for a while. She looks at her mother's legs. They're full of hard weight, right down past her ankles.\x{2014}They eat goats and all, says her mother.\x{2014}I'm sure they don't, says Paula.\x{2014}Her husband beat her.It's like a slap. When Paula arrived with black eyes or splinted fingers, her mother never commented. Not once. All those years.\x{2014}You fuckin' oul' cow, says Paula.\x{2014}Beat her to a pulp, says her mother.Paula's not sure if she spoke out loud. Her mother didn't notice, if she did. She's rubbing that knuckle. It's raw. She looks around, to see if her skin cream is near. What is it about the people close to Paula? They're all cracking open. They all have to baste themselves.She can't see any. The place is filthy. Carmel comes over on Mondays, and Denise on the Thursdays, but they're fighting a losing battle \x{2013} if they're fighting at all.She looks, and her mother is looking at her.\x{2014}You're looking lovely, she says.\x{2014}Thanks very much, says Paula.\x{2014}You haven't had it easy.\x{2014}Ah. I'm fine.\x{2014}Good.Her hands are on her lap again. That's her mother now, the woman sitting there.\x{2014}I always liked Charles.\x{2014}No, you didn't.\x{2014}Ah, I did.\x{2014}You didn't, Mammy. You were frightened of him.\x{2014}I don't remember that. Being frightened.\x{2014}We were all frightened of him, Mammy.\x{2014}Were we?\x{2014}Yes. Will I make us more tea?\x{2014}I'm frightened all the time, says her mother.\x{2014}D'you want more tea?\x{2014}I'll only have to go to the toilet.She wants her mother, but not this version. She's here; she wishes to fuck she wasn't.But she's here.\x{2014}What has you frightened? she asks.And she knows. She sounds exactly like her mother used to. What has you frightened? What made you do that? But she looks at her now, and that's her mother. She loved her. She loves her. That's true.\x{2014}I'm afraid I'll fall, says her mother.\x{2014}You won't if you're careful, says Paula.\x{2014}It's not being careful, says her mother.She hits her leg, hard.\x{2014}I'd love to be careful. I can't bloody well move.She groans. It's not pain.\x{2014}I liked getting old, she says. \x{2014}Up until \x{2014}She rubs her leg where she hit it. She can hardly manage that. The side of her hand rasps against her skirt. The skirt isn't clean.\x{2014}It was lovely, she says.Her hand is on the table now. It looks like something dead, a fish, thrown there.Paula remembers her mother's hands. She remembers watching her work. Peeling apples, wringing clothes. Taking her rings off before she put her hands in the sink. Cutting bread, combing hair with the lice-comb. Paula remembers the feel of the comb, of her mother's hand on her neck. She remembers the newspaper on the floor, right under her face, the little tappy sound when anything landed on the paper. She remembers her mother laughing when Paula read the headline that was below her.\x{2014}Bishop Deplores Seaside Behaviour.\x{2014}The poor bishop, her mother said.In this kitchen.Paula looks down at the chair she's sitting on. It's the same chair. In the same place. It must be forty years ago. Even longer.She'll ask her mother if she remembers it, the headline that made her laugh.But she won't.She'll visit more often.\x{2014}I can't manage the bin, says her mother. \x{2014}With my hands.\x{2014}Never mind the bin, says Paula.She hates herself as she listens. Her mother wants to talk about bins. So, let her.\x{2014}And they put the goats into it if I don't get it out on time. The bits they don't eat.\x{2014}That's terrible, says Paula.\x{2014}The girls are useless.Paula nods.
She has one speaker on the floor, at the door, and the other at the window, as far from the sink as she can get it. She pushes the wire on the floor closer to the wall. She'll get tacks or something, to keep the wire in place. The player itself is where the bread-bin was.The bread-bin is out in the hall. She'll put it up in the attic. It's an old tin one. She never used it. Jack used to put his little toys into it. He'd drag a chair to the counter and climb up with the toys, cars and Lego things, one at a time. He'd refuse help \x{2013} always.\x{2014}It's my work to do.It was like a fort, or a stage. She'd sit and watch him for hours, and listen to his little serious voice.She's looking at her new stereo \x{2013} \x{20ac}199. She got it in Power City. Rita Kavanagh drove her up. She took her time choosing it. She touched everything. She pressed buttons, watched doors pop up, slide open.She went for the slider. Panasonic. A name she knows. A CD player and radio. It's silver. The speakers are wood, a nice light colour. They look great, like furniture.She takes the plastic off her new CD. It's hard work, the packaging. It's fuckin' ridiculous.There were bargain CDs in Power City. But they were all old stuff \x{2013} Smokie, the Carpenters. That's not what Paula wants. Not yet. Rita bought five of them.\x{2014}You have to.But Paula had already bought her first CD. She's had it for weeks.She has the plastic off it. She needs to let her nails grow. They're nearly as bad as Leanne's. Anyway, she has it open. She loves the red and black circles on the disc. She takes it out. It resists a bit. The teeth things in the centre of the box are holding it tight. She presses the teeth down with her finger and the disc lifts. It's ridiculous, really. It's not the first time she's handled a CD. But it feels that way. Maybe it's just ownership. She bought this disc. She bought the player. She worked for these things. For herself. For the house. Jack will play his discs in the kitchen, if he wants. And Leanne \x{2013} if she wants. Leanne doesn't play music. She has a blaster in her room. Paula got it for her, years ago \x{2013} a birthday present. She was fourteen, and mad into Boyzone. She doesn't know if the blaster still works. She hasn't seen any CDs up there.She presses a button, CD 1. There's a short whirr, and the holder slides out and stops. She lowers the disc onto it. It slides back in.She's not even sure if she'll like it.She presses Play. She barely has to touch it.It was just, when she saw the cover, the four lads, not much younger than herself, but sitting together like teenagers, lads she'd like to see Jack with, if she was walking back from the shops or something. There was just something about the photograph, the sunshine, their shoes. But mostly, it was the four of them together, friends, pals at their age \x{2013} nearly her age. She thought it was lovely.How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.She knows nothing about them. U2 \x{2013} she's never liked the name. They come from her part of the city, but she missed them. She was being hammered, battered to the floor, while they were becoming famous. Nicola and John Paul weren't into them. Or Leanne, or Jack \x{2013} she thinks.She wants it loud. She wants to ignore the fact that her left ear isn't good. There's a dial for the volume. She turns it, clockwise, with just one finger, the way she's seen women in films turning cars, just one finger on the steering wheel. She's always loved the way they can do that.And it's at her. The music.She's grinning.LIGHTS \x{2013} GO DOWN. IT'S DARK.It's exactly what she wanted.THE JUNGLE IS YOUR HEAD.It's modern. It reminds her of nothing. It's not an oul' one crying into her glass. It's Paula Spencer, looking ahead.HELLO HELLO \x{2014}She'll fill the house with it. This is what will welcome the kids when they come home from school and work.I'M AT A PLACE CALLED VERTIGO.It's everywhere in the kitchen, with her.THE GIRL WITH CRIM-SON NAILS.She can spin in it.HAS JESUS ROUND HER NECK.That's how she feels. She could nearly spin. She knows, she'd go on her arse. But it's the way she feels, the way this music makes her feel. She's been brave. She's jumped right in.She turns on the water. She bends down. She drinks straight from the tap.
They're alone. It's Friday night. Leanne is just in. She's eating. She has the plate on her lap.Paula watches her.She has the telly on, Sky News. The sound is down. She's been watching the pictures from Rome. She'd love to be there.",

            '[04:00] Paula Spencer - Roddy Doyle.epub (index_split_014.html) - four in the morning',
            "She's being stupid.She's not.She's not. This is all disgusting. The coldness of it. You can't just click these things and throw them at a screen. The doctor removes. Just like that. The doctor removes the entire prick and bollix.She's at it again. Making it up. Fighting the facts. Because she can't understand what she's trying to read. Because she won't accept it. The doctor removes. It's happening in a couple of weeks. And the doctor's a woman. Carmel told her \x{2013} she's lovely. In a subcutaneous mastectomy, the doctor removes the breast tissue but leaves the nipple intact. Tissue is another of the dictionary words. She doesn't click. Her breasts aren't tissue; they never fuckin' will be.She's stupid. She's lying in bed. She'll try again tomorrow. She can do it in the morning, after she gets back from cleaning the Killester house. She won't give up.She won't sleep.Getting angry at words. It's just stupid. Hiding her ignorance. She's no help to Carmel. Just running away again.She swings from side to side, even in the bed \x{2013} she can feel herself. She'd get up now and go into Jack's room and turn on the computer and drag her eyes over and across those words again. She'd do it \x{2013} and she'd feel sick and furious before she was even sitting down. She knows what's happening. She knows what she's up to. And that's not fair \x{2013} she's not up to anything. John Paul was right. She isn't running away. She did, this afternoon. But she knew already, as she cursed the computer and tried to slam Jack's door; the carpet square in his room is new, like fuckin' grass, so she couldn't slam it properly. She knew she'd be coming back.She's not going to sleep. She could get up. But she won't. She could read. But that would mean getting up and turning on the light. She doesn't have a light beside the bed \x{2013} that's something else for her list. And she doesn't want to read. She'd be sick if she saw words packed onto a page. She can feel it, just thinking about it. In her stomach, in her throat. Nipple.She thinks of Carmel being cut. It's hard to imagine, Carmel asleep, letting it happen. But it's going to happen.\x{2014}I might bring me own knife, Carmel said, when they were talking, the last time, three nights ago. \x{2014}It's a very good one.\x{2014}Stop, said Denise.\x{2014}It is, said Carmel. \x{2014}You should see what it does to chicken.She's sure Carmel's asleep. Snoring away, keeping everyone else awake.Why would she think that? She's joking. But why would she think it? Denise is the thick. Carmel's the joker. That's the way. Paula's the alco. It's been that way for years, was that way. Denise is gormless. Carmel's bitter. Paula's hopeless.Carmel isn't asleep. Paula isn't hopeless. Denise is having the time of her life.Paula sits up.Her mobile is on the floor. She leans out and down, and gets it. She hears herself groan \x{2013} she keeps forgetting; it's just a habit.She selects Text Messages. She taps the keys. Hw r u? She fires it off to Carmel. She lies back. She puts the phone beside her. She turns the pillow. She lies back again. She puts her hands outside the duvet.The mobile buzzes. She finds it under the duvet. She was right. Carmel's awake. Go 2 slp u fuckn eejt.She laughs.She replies. Thnkng of u.Carmel's straight back. Thnx.She puts the phone back on the floor. She lets it drop.She'll sleep now. She might.
\x{2014}How's Carmel?\x{2014}She's grand, says Paula. \x{2014}Yeah; she's great. You know.They're in Rita's sitting room.\x{2014}It's a terrible thing, says Rita.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Hanging over her like that.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}And it could happen to any of us, Paula.\x{2014}For fuck sake, Rita.\x{2014}Don't mind me, says Rita.\x{2014}No, I was rude, says Paula. \x{2014}Sorry.\x{2014}She's your sister, Paula, says Rita. \x{2014}You can be as rude as you like. Will you tell her she's in my prayers?\x{2014}I will, says Paula. \x{2014}She'll like that.\x{2014}She can shove her fuckin' prayers, says Carmel.It's the same day, later. They're in Paula's kitchen.\x{2014}Rita's sound enough, says Paula.\x{2014}I know, says Carmel. \x{2014}I know. And I shouldn't be fussy where the prayers come from.Carmel has the date. She knows when she's going into the hospital. The beginning of June.\x{2014}Will you be able to wait?\x{2014}I don't have much of a choice, says Carmel. \x{2014}It's not like the fuckin' hairdresser's. I can't go up the road to the next one.\x{2014}Okay, says Paula. \x{2014}Okay.They're alone, together. There's no Denise.\x{2014}She'll be off riding some dark handsome stranger, says Carmel.\x{2014}She's actually gone to the doctor with Harry, says Paula. \x{2014}He's having his ears syringed.\x{2014}Lovely.\x{2014}He was afraid to drive the car after. Something about his balance.\x{2014}You couldn't make it up, says Carmel. \x{2014}Could you?\x{2014}No, says Paula. \x{2014}She'll be here later.\x{2014}He'll probably keep the fuckin' wax, says Carmel.\x{2014}Ah Jesus.\x{2014}Make earrings for his loving wife.Paula has Marks and Spencer's stuff for them. She bought it today, before going on to work. And three new plates, three glasses, two bottles of wine. The red for Carmel, and Denise prefers the white. It's in the fridge. When Denise goes over and opens it, she'll see it's nicely filled. It's Friday night. There's a chicken. There's mince, and a box of eggs. There's yoghurt. There's ice-cream, in the freezer. And pizzas. And, back on the table, there's a brand new corkscrew. Paula bought it today. She got the cork out of Carmel's bottle with it, no bother. The bottle's on Carmel's side of the table.\x{2014}You must be nervous, a bit, says Paula. \x{2014}Are you?\x{2014}A bit, yeah, says Carmel. \x{2014}I'm fuckin' terrified.Paula gets up and hugs her. Carmel's arms go around Paula. They stay that way for a good while.\x{2014}I'm an eejit, says Carmel.Paula lets go of Carmel.\x{2014}Stop that, she says. \x{2014}Why are you?\x{2014}It's only an operation, says Carmel.\x{2014}It isn't only anything, says Paula.\x{2014}D'you know what it reminds me of? says Carmel. \x{2014} And it's weird.\x{2014}What? says Paula.\x{2014}Being pregnant.\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Yeah, says Carmel. \x{2014}The waiting. Knowing it's going to happen but not knowing exactly when.\x{2014}But you know now, says Paula.\x{2014}But it still feels a bit the same. I've even packed a fuckin' bag. I have it at the door of the bedroom. Jesus, Paula, what's that shite Jack's playing?\x{2014}It's not Jack's, says Paula.\x{2014}What is it?\x{2014}It's the White Stripes. I'll turn it off. I'll change it.\x{2014}Is it yours? says Carmel.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula.\x{2014}For fuck sake.\x{2014}Ah, lay off, Carmel. I like it.She puts the CD into its box. Carmel comes over and picks up more boxes.\x{2014}Are all these yours?\x{2014}No, says Paula. \x{2014}Some of them.\x{2014}Have you no good stuff?\x{2014}Like what?\x{2014}Stop being thick. The 70s.\x{2014}That's thirty years ago.\x{2014}It feels like fuckin' yesterday. What's going on, Paula? Is this something menopausal, or what?She's holding up Queens of the Stone Age.\x{2014}That's Jack's.Paula's blushing. She can feel her face burn. She'd wanted Carmel to notice the stereo. But she hadn't. It's no big deal. Every house has one, or two or three of them.Carmel holds up another one.\x{2014}Jack's? she says.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula.How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb.\x{2014}Like shite, says Carmel. \x{2014}It's yours.\x{2014}Yeah.Carmel hands it to her.\x{2014}Stick it on, she says.She goes over to the table, sits down again.\x{2014}I've never really listened to music, she says. \x{2014}Even the old stuff. I don't really care. The first couple of seconds is enough.\x{2014}I was like that, says Paula.\x{2014}No, says Carmel. \x{2014}You weren't.'Vertigo' starts. Paula turns the sound down.\x{2014}I've heard that one, says Carmel.\x{2014}It's all over the place, says Paula.She sits down.\x{2014}I love it, says Paula.Carmel nods.\x{2014}D'you ever think of Wendy?\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula.\x{2014}Me too, says Carmel.\x{2014}She was lovely.Carmel nods.\x{2014}What would she be like now? says Paula. \x{2014}D'you ever wonder?\x{2014}Still lovely.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula.\x{2014}She'd be, what?\x{2014}Forty-four, I think.\x{2014}Jesus, says Carmel.They laugh.\x{2014}Wendy liked her music too, says Carmel. \x{2014}Didn't she?\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula.\x{2014}The bedroom wall, says Carmel. \x{2014}The pictures she stuck up. It wasn't just Donny Osmond and them.\x{2014}She loved Led Zeppelin, says Paula.\x{2014}D'you have any of theirs?\x{2014}No, says Paula. \x{2014}Jack might.\x{2014}Really? says Carmel. \x{2014}Are they still big?\x{2014}I think so, yeah, says Paula.She doesn't think they've talked like this before. They're like two people getting to know each other \x{2013} their first date. Or two old friends who haven't seen each other in years.\x{2014}That was your man, Ozzy Osbourne, wasn't it?\x{2014}Led Zeppelin? says Paula.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Well, that's sorted, says Carmel. \x{2014}I won't go under the knife thinking that Ozzy Osbourne was in Led Zeppelin.\x{2014}Stop.\x{2014}I didn't really know her, says Carmel. \x{2014}The age gap, you know.\x{2014}That's only natural, says Paula. \x{2014}In a big family.\x{2014}I was gone before she was really a teenager. And I stayed away.Paula says nothing.\x{2014}Fuckin' regrets, Paula, says Carmel. \x{2014}That's the worst part of this.\x{2014}We all have regrets.\x{2014}Just \x{2013} look it. Listen.\x{2014}Sorry, says Paula. \x{2014}Go on.\x{2014}I'm not being morbid, says Carmel. \x{2014}I'm trying not to be, anyway. And I know my chances are good. And even if the operation isn't, what's it \x{2013} it's too late \x{2013}1 know I won't be dying there and then, on the table.Paula says nothing.\x{2014}Unless something goes really wrong. There's a power cut, or the doctor has a game of golf she has to get to, or something.Carmel sits up.\x{2014}But anyway. I'm optimistic. I am. But fuck it, I'm not stupid.She stops. Paula knows. She isn't finished.\x{2014}Dead, says Carmel. \x{2014}That's the word. You have to get used to it. And you can't help looking back. It seems to be natural, you know.Paula nods.\x{2014}Yeah, says Carmel. \x{2014}And the good things kind of glide past you. You can take them for granted. But the bad things, the regrets. They fuckin' sting.\x{2014}I know, says Paula.Carmel is looking at her.\x{2014}Yeah, she says. \x{2014}You know exactly what I mean. Sorry, Paula. You become a bit full of yourself when you're dying.They should cry. But they don't. Carmel nods at the stereo.\x{2014}It's shite.\x{2014}Fuck off.Carmel pours some more of the wine.\x{2014}So, says Paula. \x{2014}What stings?\x{2014}Things I said, says Carmel.She shrugs.\x{2014}It's stupid, she says. \x{2014}You can't be going around regretting every fuckin' word. And if I wasn't sick I wouldn't even be thinking about it. But I was a bitch, wasn't I?\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Sometimes.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}See?\x{2014}We all are, says Paula.\x{2014}Yeah, but I'm good at it, says Carmel.\x{2014}That's true.\x{2014}But that's not really it, says Carmel. \x{2014}Not really what I mean. I don't think I'm a bad person.\x{2014}God, no.Carmel saved Paula's life, before Paula knew she wanted to be saved.\x{2014}No, I'm grand about it, says Carmel. \x{2014}But I'm going to be nicer.Paula laughs.\x{2014}Fuck off, says Carmel. \x{2014}I am. Regardless, you know. But it's other things I really regret.\x{2014}Like?\x{2014}The things I didn't do.\x{2014}Like?\x{2014}I just wish I'd done more.She slaps her stomach.\x{2014}I got old too fuckin' early. I let myself. Look at me.She slaps herself again. She lifts her jumper, grabs hold of the flab. And Jack walks in. He's immediately very red. His face is blotched and glowing. It's too much for him. He knows about her cancer, her breast. And Carmel's always been good to him.\x{2014}Hi, he says.He says it to the floor.\x{2014}Howyeh, Jack, says Carmel.\x{2014}Hi.\x{2014}Hungry, Jack? says Paula.\x{2014}No, I'm grand.He turns. He's gone.\x{2014}Poor Jack, says Carmel, after they've stopped laughing. \x{2014}He's probably starving.\x{2014}You were saying about regrets, says Paula.She's at the tap. She's filling her glass.\x{2014}There's not much to say, says Carmel, \x{2014}that isn't obvious. I wish I'd lived a bit more.\x{2014}Like Denise.\x{2014}No, not like Denise.She takes a drink. She lowers the glass.\x{2014}Okay, she says. \x{2014}A bit like Denise. But, not really. No real regrets there.She's started to peel the label off the wine bottle.\x{2014}Nothing dramatic, she says. \x{2014}Just, things. Like, I never go into town. I decided I didn't like it, years ago. And I don't know why. Because I did like it. D'you know what I mean?\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula. \x{2014}I think so.\x{2014}You go into town.\x{2014}I have to, says Paula. \x{2014}To work.\x{2014}I know, says Carmel. \x{2014}But you still go in. And it's not just town. It's not even town. It's \x{2013} I don't know. It's the attitude. You know. There's nothing good. There's something wrong with everything. I'm not really like that at all.\x{2014}I know.\x{2014}But it's the way I've been. Nothing worth seeing, nothing worth doing. I go to nothing. And now I'm afraid to.\x{2014}Why?\x{2014}I don't know. I want to be close to home. In case.\x{2014}What about Bulgaria? says Paula.\x{2014}What about it?\x{2014}You said you don't like going into town.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}But you go to Bulgaria. It's not on the Dart, Carmel.\x{2014}Yeah, but that's different, says Carmel. \x{2014}We did that because everyone else is doing it. It is a good investment, though.\x{2014}But you've been there and other places, says Paula. \x{2014}I don't even have a passport yet.\x{2014}Yet, says Carmel. \x{2014}You see, that's it. You said Yet. You're going to get one. We know you are. You're fuckin' amazing, by the way.Paula says nothing; it's happened too fast. She's not sure she heard it.\x{2014}If it was me, says Carmel, \x{2014}I wouldn't bother getting a passport. I'd think of reasons not to.She nods at the stereo.\x{2014}It's not too bad, she says.Paula smiles.\x{2014}Will I stick in the food or wait for Denise?\x{2014}Don't wait for that one. She's probably riding Harry's doctor.\x{2014}The new you, yeah?\x{2014}I forgot.She takes a sip.\x{2014}Yes, she says. \x{2014}Let's wait for Denise. She'll probably be starving.\x{2014}After all the exercise.\x{2014}Exactly.\x{2014}I've a few things in the fridge that don't need cooking.Paula stands up. She hears a key in the front door. She hopes it's Leanne. She hopes it isn't. She doesn't know \x{2013} it's dreadful. Shame sweeps across her, and she can't stop it. She shouldn't have asked Carmel and Denise here. There's too much to show them. Leanne's in the hall \x{2013} and it could be anything; she could be in any state. Paula wants to shout, to run out there and slam the door.\x{2014}That's Leanne, I think, she says.Carmel sits up a bit. She's still a wagon. But that's not fair. Carmel knows. Paula's seen Carmel ripped apart by her own children.She goes to the fridge. She opens the door. She hides behind it.She doesn't.She's getting the dips, and carrots. She's trusting Leanne; she's letting it happen. And the cold from the fridge is good. It knocks the sweat off her face. She'd love to climb in, just for a minute.She shuts the door with her elbow.Leanne's there. She's already sitting at the table.Paula's afraid to talk. Every word will betray Leanne \x{2013} she knows it. And Leanne will know it. Carmel doesn't matter. It's not about shame; she doesn't care. It's about her voice, what Leanne will hear.\x{2014}Jesus, Leanne, she says. \x{2014}You must've heard me going to the fridge.Leanne shrugs and does a face.\x{2014}I wouldn't eat that muck, she says. \x{2014}What is it, an'anyway?\x{2014}Food for oul' ones, says Paula.She puts the box on the table, and the carrot sticks.\x{2014}Ah Jesus, says Carmel.\x{2014}I'm getting you crackers, says Paula. \x{2014}Shut up.She smiles at Leanne. She doesn't look at the bottle, at Leanne's hands, at the little bits of label paper on the table, around the bottle.She opens the press. She gets down the crackers. She throws them across to Carmel.Leanne has the glass Paula left on the table for Denise.She stands up. She brings the glass with her. She goes to the tap.
She feels it when she picks up the bucket. Her back. She's already walking crooked, to give it room, avoid admitting it.She's not sure.It was nothing dramatic. She just picked up the bucket and felt it, at the bottom of her spine, to the side there.It's happened before. It goes away. Like a threat, something that'll come back when it wants to. A nerve, just gently tapped. It's horrible. It's playing with her.She feels like a cripple already. The last time, it hurt every time she put her foot on the stairs. She can feel herself now, shifting all her weight away from the twinge. She feels fat and breakable; her belly is sticking out. The pain lights up every other pain. Every wound and break she's had, going on and off. Reminding her. Catching up.It's Wednesday night. She has to work. It's a good while since she's been afraid that the fridge won't be filled. She's earning more than she ever did. But the back is there, the twinge. I can do this. I can bring you down.She shifts the bucket to her other hand. It's full of water. It's always heavy \x{2013} it's going to make her snap. It's up into her breath.She stops. She bends her knees. She puts down the bucket. Now, she bends her fuckin' knees. Forty years too late.There's no tax, no stamps. It's money into her hand. If she stops working, she never worked. She's never been happy with it, but it's all there ever was. And all there is. If she doesn't do it, other people will. She knows, she sees them. It's why they're here. Go back to your own fuckin' country. That's not her; that's not Paula. There's plenty of work. She won't be waiting long. But she doesn't want to lose the extra money for supervising, or the name, and the years that went into getting it. She's near the bottom of the heap. Tonight, she knows it. She feels it.She leans the mop against the wall. She opens the top button of her jeans. That's a bit better.It's like the wiring, across and up her back, through her ribs and up, to the back of her neck \x{2013} it's like the wire has been tapped and the pain is singing through the wires, humming, loudly, softly. A bird has landed on the wire. It won't get off. It keeps opening and closing its claws.Opening, and closing.She picks up the bucket. She can't stand straight. The bucket's too full. She gets it to the lip of the sink. She empties it. She dips the bucket slowly. She doesn't want to spill the water.A week on her back and the job is gone. The house jobs aren't enough.There's other work. There's real work, with stamps and pensions. But how does she get one of those jobs; how does she explain? She hasn't worked since 1975? What does she say? She doesn't know.She wipes the sink. There's grit from the water around the sides. She rinses the cloth. She squeezes it. The action, from her hands, arms, shoulders \x{2013} there's no quick jab.She wipes the sink again. It shines; it's grand.She steps away from the sink. She picks up the bucket. She bends her knees. A tap, on her nerve. It's there. A claw. She tries not to be too nervous.Everything is hopping. Everything is sweating. Every hole and dent. Every thump and kick. All of Paula's past is in her back. It's there, ready, breathing. One last kick from a man who died twelve years ago.She has to put the buffer away. She'd forgotten; she wants to cry. She has to balance the bucket and mop on top of it. She pushes from her left side \x{2013} she tries to save the right.She feels it when she presses the button for the lift. Just lifting her arm, she feels it stab, and go. She's into the lift. She presses for the basement. She lifts her arm \x{2013} it's fine. The door closes. She feels the movement, the shake, drop. She adjusts the bucket, resettles it on the buffer.The lift stops. The door opens. She has to pull the buffer out. There's no room to turn it and push. The door starts to close. She does it before she thinks \x{2013} she shoves the door back with her shoulder.It's fine. She's okay.She pulls the buffer. She starts to pull. She feels it; it's there. But she has to pull.She's out of the lift.Her mobile rings.She digs into her pocket. Right side \x{2013} the pain shoots up, but stops before it really starts. Her hand is shaking.\x{2014}Hello?\x{2014}It's me.Nicola.\x{2014}What, love?\x{2014}Did you hear? says Nicola.\x{2014}Hear what?\x{2014}About Kylie Minogue, says Nicola.\x{2014}Ah, lovely, says Paula. \x{2014}I'd love to go. With the girls, is it?Will she leave her alone now?\x{2014}What? says Nicola.\x{2014}The Kylie concert, says Paula.\x{2014}What concert? It's not a concert.\x{2014}I've to go for the Dart, love.\x{2014}She has breast cancer, says Nicola. \x{2014}Did you not hear?\x{2014}Kylie?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}That's terrible.She's always liked Kylie Minogue.The bird lands \x{2013} she puts her hand to her back.She remembers one morning, dancing in the kitchen with Nicola \x{2013} I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY \x{2013} LUCKY, LUCKY, LUCKY \x{2013} and she held up John Paul, a couple of inches, so he'd be the same height \x{2013} I SHOULD BE SO LUCKY IN LOVE \x{2013} around and around the kitchen. Her arms ached \x{2013} she remembers. And when it was over Nicola asked her what was the stuff on her sleeve. It was blood. She hadn't noticed it. She'd gone to bed in her clothes the night before. She'd fallen asleep holding a wet cloth to her face.Nicola just said something.\x{2014}Sorry, love. I lost you there.\x{2014}I said, will Carmel be okay? says Nicola.Paula can hear Nicola's impatience \x{2013} her mother, the eejit.Go away, Nicola.\x{2014}About Kylie, you mean? says Paula.\x{2014}Yes!\x{2014}I'm not sure she even likes Kylie, says Paula.She feels the claws.\x{2014}I have to go.She presses the red button. She leans on the buffer. She tries to lean out of the pain, to get under it. The mobile goes again. She doesn't answer. The ringing stops.She tries not to let Nicola annoy her. But it's been happening. Nicola's the one who's furthest from her. It didn't feel like that before, but now it does. Nicola reared the younger ones as much as Paula ever did. She picked up Paula and washed her. She fed Leanne and Jack. And after she left she still looked after Paula.She puts the mobile back in her pocket.She stands away from the buffer. She pushes. She's fine. She hears and feels the double buzz. Nicola's text. She'll read it when she's finished.She pushes the buffer around the corner. There's the corridor, and the storeroom. She could leave the buffer outside. She won't \x{2013} she can't. She's the boss. It's her job, putting away the buffers and buckets that the other cleaners leave outside the door. She's last out, for \x{20ac}30 a week extra. She knows exactly what that can buy, and what not having it will mean.The metal double-doors need a pull. The lock's a bastard. She's never sure when she has it. It's just luck; there's never a click. It gives tonight. She feels it come.She turns on the light. She stands there for a while.She feels bad about Nicola. But it's hard. Nicola sees no difference between Paula now and Paula the way she was ten years ago, five years, last year. Nicola was never a child; she never could be. Paula's fault \x{2013} she knows, she feels it. It's in her back there, too. She could never feel guilty enough.There are five buffers. They're in a line, like dodgems, against the corridor wall. Paula rolls her own in first. She feels the dust against her face. It's funny. No one cleans the room that holds the cleaning stuff. She goes out, and brings in the next. She pushes with both hands. She straightens her back, a bit.One more buffer. Then the hoovers and the wheelie-buckets. She's not puffing now. She's not afraid to breathe. It's still there, though. The bird creeps along the wire.Nicola will never trust her. She'll always be checking. Paula doesn't drink. She's nearly ready to make that claim. But she can't say that to Nicola. Because she'll see Nicola's face. Not disbelief, or sarcasm. Just sadness. And she'll keep checking the shelves. She'll keep looking in the fridge when she comes into the kitchen. That's why she bought the fridge for Paula, although she doesn't know it. She can walk right in and open it. She's not looking for alcohol. She knows it won't be there. She's looking for the mixers. Can I have a cup of mixers, Mammy? Paula will always be helpless, and hopeless. There's nothing she can ever do about it.It's hard to take. It's hard not to hope. Leanne has seen the change in Paula. Jack has seen it. He's a bit afraid, but he's seen. She thinks John Paul has. Carmel, Denise, Rita Kavanagh. Even her mother, the last time Paula went to see her \x{2013} Did you do something to your hair? \x{2013} before she shut down again and stared across Paula's shoulder. Paula had done nothing to her hair. It suits you.Paula is one of Nicola's children. It'll never be different.She hates it.She shuts the storeroom door. She's careful. She caught her skin in the door a few months ago. It took a chunk right off the side of her hand. She checks \x{2013} she pulls the handle. It's locked. She can go home.She remembers Nicola's text. She'll read it on the Dart.She's happier than Nicola. That's probably true. Alcoholics can stop drinking but what is there for the children of alcoholics? Is it always too late? Probably. She doesn't know.She's outside the building. She feels each step as she goes down. There's a jab, waiting \x{2013} the little claws. She can't relax her body. She can't walk evenly. Her stomach is pushing out again. She sees the bridge at Tara Street. She's in trouble if the escalator isn't working. She can't face all those steps.The Kylie Minogue thing. God love her, she's gorgeous. She's always liked Kylie. It's kind of heart-breaking. But Nicola phoning, she was letting Paula know that she hadn't thought of it. It'll be all over the papers, and on the telly, pictures of Kylie, her famous arse, experts going on about her chances of recovery, diagrams of mastectomies, other famous girls who survived or didn't. Carmel won't be able to avoid it. Nicola thought of it \x{2013} Paula didn't.Sitting down on the train, bending her back \x{2013} what'll happen? It's one of the newer carriages. The seats aren't nice; you can't sit back. She's better off sitting up straight. She takes the mobile from her pocket. She sits. She's fine.She phones Carmel.\x{2014}Are you coming home from work? says Carmel.\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}On the Dart?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Well, if you mention Kylie Minogue, I'll be waiting at the station and I'll smack the face off you.\x{2014}People are worried about you, says Paula.\x{2014}Oh, I know, says Carmel. \x{2014}And I've had to cancel my tour of Asia and Australia. For fuck sake.\x{2014}They mean well.\x{2014}Ah, I know, says Carmel. \x{2014}How're things with yourself?\x{2014}Not too bad. My back's at me.\x{2014}I'll swap with you, says Carmel.\x{2014}No sympathy for me tonight, Carmel, no?\x{2014}Hang on, says Carmel. \x{2014}I need a bowl. My heart is fuckin' bleeding.\x{2014}Fuck off.\x{2014}Is it bad?\x{2014}It's thinking about it, says Paula.\x{2014}Take it easy, says Carmel.\x{2014}Yeah. Did my Nicola phone you?\x{2014}No. Why?\x{2014}I just thought.\x{2014}No.\x{2014}Grand.She sees Nicola's car outside the house. She's not in the mood. The back's enough to be dealing with. She doesn't need Nicola. The guilt, the uselessness.Leanne's in the front room.Paula speaks softly.\x{2014}Where is she?\x{2014}Kitchen, says Leanne.\x{2014}By herself?\x{2014}Yeah.Leanne's watching one of those reality things. Celebrity Fuckin' Eejits. Paula stands there for a while. Leanne points at the screen.\x{2014}He wants to get off with \x{2013} not her. Her.\x{2014}Oh.Paula goes into the kitchen.\x{2014}On your own?Nicola's sitting at the table. There's a mug at her elbow. She's filling out forms or something. She's always working.\x{2014}Yeah, she says.She doesn't look up.\x{2014}Where're the kids?\x{2014}At home, says Nicola. \x{2014}With Tony.\x{2014}Ah, yeah.\x{2014}He is their father, says Nicola.Paula looks at her. She puts her jacket on a chair.\x{2014}Is everything okay?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Nicola?\x{2014}What?\x{2014}Is everything okay?\x{2014}Yeah.She'd love Nicola to say No. It would do so much. The vulnerability, and the trust. She'd be Nicola's mother. She could rest. Her back wouldn't matter.Nicola picks up her forms and papers. She taps them on the table. She slips them into a plastic folder. She stands up. She stretches, a long time, her arms way up. She's gorgeous. Her tummy there, where her blouse has come up out of her trousers. The little mark where she once had her belly-button pierced.\x{2014}Tired?\x{2014}Yeah.\x{2014}Me too. More tea?\x{2014}No, says Nicola.Paula picks up the kettle. It's warm but light. It needs more water. She waits for the twinge; she half expects.She fills the kettle. She talks to the window.\x{2014}So, what has you here?\x{2014}Well, if I'm not welcome \x{2014}\x{2014}Lay off, Nicola. You're always welcome. But it's night and Leanne's in there and I think Jack's upstairs \x{2014}\x{2014}He is.\x{2014}And you're in here on your own. Why?\x{2014}I just thought, says Nicola. \x{2014}On the phone, earlier.\x{2014}What?\x{2014}You sounded a bit strange.\x{2014}It's my back, says Paula.She's annoyed, too late. She jumped in too quickly with her excuse. She's done what Nicola does; she's killed it.She puts the kettle down. She presses the switch.She turns.\x{2014}I thought the back was going on me again, she says. \x{2014}Like before. When you phoned.\x{2014}Is it alright?\x{2014}I think so.\x{2014}You didn't answer my text.\x{2014}My back; sorry.Nicola moves towards her.\x{2014}Let's have a look.\x{2014}Carmel's grand about Kylie, by the way.\x{2014}Take off your top. Did you phone her?\x{2014}Yeah, she's grand.\x{2014}You're all twisted.\x{2014}I know, says Paula.She feels Nicola's fingers on her back.\x{2014}Where's it sore?\x{2014}Lower. Right. Yeah, there.\x{2014}Will I rub it?\x{2014}It can't do any harm, says Paula.\x{2014}You can lie on the couch.\x{2014}I don't want to disturb Leanne.\x{2014}She can sit on your head, says Nicola. \x{2014}Go on in. I'll make the tea.\x{2014}No, says Paula. \x{2014}I'll make my own tea. I'm not a total cripple.She puts her hand on Nicola's shoulder. She feels a jab as she lifts her hand. She doesn't let it stop her. She doesn't let it run across her face.She feels Nicola tighten, under her fingers. She sees Nicola staring at her arm \x{2013} as if they're getting into a fight. She feels her bones relax. She sees her look at Paula now, and smile. They're both trying. They're trying to meet. And they know it.\x{2014}You're not to come running every time you think there's something wrong, says Paula.Nicola fights back the objection; Paula can see it.\x{2014}D'you understand? she says.\x{2014}Yeah. I do.\x{2014}I'm grand, says Paula. \x{2014}D'you believe me?\x{2014}Yeah.She doesn't, but Paula won't say that.
She's tired. She's heavy. The pain is still threatening. She woke up with it, the minute she moved and knew she was awake. It's been there all day.She didn't really sleep. She feels that now, around her eyes, and in her lungs.She woke up low. There's nothing she can do about it. She walked to the shop earlier. It's a lovely day; that much got through. She bought herself a Bounty. She smiled at the East European young one in the shop.She can't remember eating it. She did eat it. The wrapper's in the bin. She runs her tongue behind her teeth. There's no chocolate there, no taste.She lies on her bed.She came up for something. It doesn't matter.She's in the hall. She's holding her jacket.She's in the back garden. She's in the grass. It's nearly up to her knees. She bends down; she's careful. She grabs some grass. It feels hard in her hand. Her wrist is sore, her whole arm. She lets go of the grass.She sees the wine bottles. Beside the step, at the back door. She remembers. Carmel and Denise, the red and the white. She doesn't remember putting them there.She's in the kitchen. She hears the kettle. She hears rain on the window. Her mobile is ringing.She's in bed. It's dark outside. She sits up \x{2013} did she go to work? She can't breathe. She gets up, she turns on the light. She remembers. She went to work. She came home. She turns off the light. She gets back into bed. She's wide awake.She wakes up. She's on the couch. It's bright \x{2013} the street light. The curtains are open. She tastes drink \x{2013} dry and sour \x{2013} in her mouth. She swallows \x{2013} it's gone. She hasn't been drinking; she's awake. The telly's off. She came down to watch it. She thinks she did. She's cold.She's in the garden. The wine bottles are empty. She puts one to her mouth. She must have rinsed it. And washed it. No taste on the glass.She goes back in. She shuts the door. She locks it. She still has the bottle. She looks at the clock. It's <<four in the morning|5>>, just after. She puts the bottle on the table. She picks it up. She can't leave it there. Jack will see it, and Leanne. She goes back to the door. She unlocks it. She puts the bottle back out, beside the other one. She bends down.She goes back in. She locks the door.
The smell, the stale drink \x{2013} the dead air is around her. She'd climb in. She'd lick every broken piece and bleed happily to death. Especially the green glass. She'd bleed green and lie down.There's a man talking to her.\x{2014}The wasps are a curse, aren't they?He's beside her.\x{2014}They are, yeah, she says.He leans across her, so he can drop a bottle into the green hole.\x{2014}Sorry; excuse me.She looks at his bottles. They're in a cardboard box he's able to hold in one arm. A couple of wine bottles, and four beer ones, she thinks. A Dolmio sauce bottle, not properly rinsed. Two little brown medicine bottles. No cans.\x{2014}It's a sign of the summer, he says. \x{2014}I suppose.\x{2014}Yeah, says Paula.He gets out of her way. She drops Carmel's bottle into the hole. She drops Denise's. She scrunches up the plastic bag and puts in it in her pocket.She doesn't know why \x{2013} she takes the brown medicine bottles from his box.\x{2014}Oh, he says. \x{2014}Thank you.\x{2014}No problem, she says.He's nice.He's right about the wasps. They're zipping around, or just hanging there; they're nearly in her breath. She goes across to the brown bin. She feels the broken glass under her feet.He's wearing nice shoes. They're black and they're polished.She drops in the brown bottles. They don't break; she can hear that.\x{2014}Any more? she says.\x{2014}No, he says.He turns over the box.\x{2014}I'm not drinking enough.\x{2014}D'you drink coffee? she says.Jesus Christ.He's about sixty, she'd say. He shaved himself this morning. He's blushing. So is she. What sort of a knacker is she? She hasn't even washed yet. It's a fuckin' bottle bank.\x{2014}Yes, he says. \x{2014}I do.His name is Joe. He has four children and three grandchildren. He worked in the Department of Health. He took early retirement. He's thinking of doing a degree next year, in politics or Greek. His Nike hoodie belongs to his son. He left it behind when he visited last Sunday with the grandchild, a girl. Sorcha. He has a mobile home in Wexford.\x{2014}Courtown?\x{2014}Not far. Cahore.\x{2014}Lovely.He'll go down there a good bit, now that it's looking like summer. His children use it most of the time. Three of them are married. The other one's a bit wild. He came to this bottle bank because the one nearer his house was full. He didn't want to leave the bottles there in the box. They'd have ended up being broken. The coffee is excellent. His wife left him eight years ago.\x{2014}And you, Paula?\x{2014}Well, she says. \x{2014}My husband's dead.\x{2014}Oh.\x{2014}Ten years. Actually, eleven.\x{2014}That's hard.What is she fuckin' doing?\x{2014}I've four children as well, she says. \x{2014}Two married, two still with me at home. One in school, doing his Leaving next year. And I've four little grandchildren. I'm ahead of you there, Joe. Three little girls and a boy.She likes his hair. It's a bright kind of grey and it's longer than it should be, and it looks strong. His tie looks stupid with the hoodie.\x{2014}And do you work, yourself, Paula?\x{2014}Yes, I do, Joe, she says. \x{2014}I clean some offices. I'm kind of in charge.She can tell. He's not put off. He's quite excited.No, he's not. She is.She's not. But she likes him.\x{2014}Where's your wife? she says. \x{2014}Ex-wife; sorry. Are yis \x{2013} are you divorced?\x{2014}No, he says. \x{2014}Not formally.He doesn't mind the question.\x{2014}She lives in Kerry now, he says. \x{2014}We're the best of friends.You are in your bollix.She smiles.\x{2014}That's good.\x{2014}And your husband, he says. \x{2014}How did it \x{2014} ?\x{2014}He got shot, says Paula.\x{2014}Oh, God.\x{2014}By the Guards.He's not so relaxed now. But he's not running away.\x{2014}An accident? he says.He doesn't believe that; she can see it.\x{2014}No, she says. \x{2014}It was deliberate.She picks up her coffee.\x{2014}He wasn't a nice man, Joe, unfortunately.She likes the way she's talking. Unfortunately. But it's a bit mad.She takes a sip of her coffee. She's careful. She's being watched.He isn't good-looking. He probably never was. But he's nice. There's something steady about him. She can see it, even in the way he's sitting. He's lonely. She can see that. And a bit awkward.He's brave enough. He asks her another one.\x{2014}Was it, sorry \x{2013} was it robbery?\x{2014}Yes, she says. \x{2014}Well. No. It was worse, really. Kidnapping.\x{2014}Oh, dear.\x{2014}And it got even worse, Joe. He killed a woman.That's it, anyway. It's out in the open. She's not shaking too badly.\x{2014}That must have been difficult, he says.He even smiles.\x{2014}I'm sorry, he says. \x{2014}That must sound a bit feeble.\x{2014}No, no, she says. \x{2014}It was. Difficult.She wants to run. This is mad.\x{2014}We weren't living together at the time, she says. \x{2014} But it was terrible.\x{2014}I can imagine.No, you can't, Joe.\x{2014}Yeah, she says.\x{2014}This was eleven years ago?\x{2014}That's right.\x{2014}I think I remember something \x{2014}\x{2014}It was on the News. And in the papers and that.\x{2014}It must have been.\x{2014}Yeah, she says. \x{2014}Outside the house and all. Even though he didn't live there.\x{2014}I hope you had the grass cut, Paula.He is a nice man. She laughs. He laughs.\x{2014}I'm only joking, he says.\x{2014}I know, she says. \x{2014}And, no. The garden was a bit of a mess, so it was.He has no fuckin' idea.\x{2014}So, she says. \x{2014}What about you? Was your grass cut when your wife walked out on you?Jesus.\x{2014}God, sorry.That sounded vicious. She's taking over from Carmel.\x{2014}Well, he says. \x{2014}I was actually cutting the grass. As it happens.He laughs \x{2013} he makes himself.\x{2014}Somebody had to, he says. \x{2014}But she didn't like it, apparently. And I thought that was a bit unfair.\x{2014}Hang on, says Paula. \x{2014}She left you because you were cutting the grass?\x{2014}No, he says. \x{2014}That would be ridiculous. I actually went in for a glass of water. It was a hot day.He's still angry. She can hear it. We're the best of friends. Yeah; maybe.He picks up his cup.\x{2014}She'd packed a bag, he says.\x{2014}What's her name?\x{2014}Oh. Mary.\x{2014}Sorry, she says. \x{2014}Go on.He puts the cup on the table.\x{2014}Isn't this a little bit strange, Paula?\x{2014}I suppose it is, she says.For fuck sake.\x{2014}But go on, anyway, she says.\x{2014}I probably misled you when I mentioned that I was cutting the grass.\x{2014}I don't know, she says.\x{2014}A minute ago you told me that your husband murdered someone. And now I'm telling you about my wife's departure. What's your surname, Paula?\x{2014}Spencer, says Paula.They laugh.\x{2014}It's because we don't know each other, she says. \x{2014} That's why. It's easy.\x{2014}You might be right, he says.\x{2014}What's yours?\x{2014}Sorry?\x{2014}Your surname.\x{2014}Oh, yes. Prescott.\x{2014}Like the dry cleaners.\x{2014}No relation, he says. \x{2014}But I have been told I'm a bit dry.\x{2014}She told you.\x{2014}Yes.Get over it.She'll give him another minute.\x{2014}Anyway, he says. \x{2014}Dry or not. She was going.\x{2014}Another man, says Paula.\x{2014}No, he says. \x{2014}A woman.\x{2014}What? You and \x{2014}\x{2014}She left me for a woman.\x{2014}Fuck off.The words shock him; she sees it.\x{2014}Sorry, she says.This is fuckin' ridiculous.\x{2014}It's just, she says. \x{2014}I'd never have guessed that.He nods.\x{2014}Yes, well, he says. \x{2014}Neither would I. I'd still be standing there. But, luckily \x{2014}He snorts. She half expects to see snot on his top lip.\x{2014}She put me out of my misery.\x{2014}Jesus.She'd never have guessed. She's not sure why not, because she's often thought about women and women. It's never seemed wrong or even strange. She's often thought how easy it would be.But this is weird, the whole set-up here.\x{2014}Tell us, she says. \x{2014}Why are you telling me this?\x{2014}Well, he says. \x{2014}I have to say. It's the most interesting thing about me.\x{2014}Fair enough, she says. \x{2014}My husband was shot. Your wife ran off with another bird. We're fuckin' fascinating.\x{2014}We are, he says. \x{2014}We are.She's dying to tell people, Carmel, Leanne, even poor Jack. Not about his wife; that's nobody's business. Just that she's met him. I've met someone, by the way. She can hear herself. Just a friend, like. Nothing serious. She gave him her mobile number. He doesn't have one. They're meeting again. They're going for a walk. They're meeting at the Causeway Road. She'll walk there. It's not that far.She keeps thinking about him in his kitchen, and his wife walking out the door. Mary. And she keeps following Mary to her car \x{2013} she'd have a car \x{2013} and she puts the case in the boot and she drives off to Kerry. And Paula's in the back, trying to see her in the rear-view mirror. Why is she leaving? Why did she leave? How do you become a lesbian when you're fifty? She was the same age Paula is now, or thereabouts. He'd have mentioned it if she'd been much younger.She's not mad about walking. It's never made much sense. It was his idea. And that's fine. It's safe. His hand won't go for her leg. She laughs at that, alone. She'd noticed his hands. They were small. No dirt in the nails when he picked up his cup. They were cleaner than hers.But the wife. It can't have been out of the blue. He comes in from the garden for a glass of water and his wife's turned into a lezzer. What kind of a man has that effect? What does he have to do?She's married to a dead man and she's day-dreaming about a man who'll be dead in a few years. He's sixty, for fuck sake. She doesn't fancy him. Not at all. There are old men she could fall for, no bother. Not old, just a good bit older than her. Sean Connery, Leonard Cohen \x{2013} she saw a picture of him in the paper a few months ago; he was seventy. She likes that old footballer, Frank McLintock. And there's Paul Newman. And Proinsias De Rossa. She saw the King of Spain on telly and he looked lovely. She hasn't told anyone, but she thinks the new Pope is a ride. She watched Sky News for a few days after he was elected, just to see if there'd be more about him.There's the bus crash the day before they meet. A school bus, on a road in Meath. Five girls are killed. Four of them from the same school, all from the same little place. A close-knit community, the man on the radio says. She watches it on the <<Nine O'Clock|6>> News, when she gets in from work. The bus is overturned, on a straight stretch of road. There are two other cars, crashed into each other. There's a picture of some schoolbags, thrown from the bus, on the side of the road. One of them looks like Jack's \x{2013} she tries not to be stupid. There'll be piles of flowers there soon, and teddy bears. People in the village talk to the reporter. They try not to cry as they speak. One woman blesses herself. They heard about the crash on the radio. Other kids called home on their mobiles. Jesus, the thought. Your children on the bus. Coming home for their tea, says a man on the News. To do their homework.It's another of the cold days. She wear Jack's jacket. He gets out of his car when he sees her coming. She doesn't know what make the car is. It's green. He takes a big umbrella out of the boot.\x{2014}I should have called for you, he says.\x{2014}No, she says. \x{2014}It's grand.They walk towards Sutton and Howth. The rain stays off. It was belting down all last night. It's still on the ground. They talk about the crash.\x{2014}There was a man on the television last night, he says.He talks as he looks ahead. She looks at the side of his face. His wrinkles look deliberate. The skin on his neck is looser than hers. His shirt is clean. He must have ironed it himself.\x{2014}He mentioned the children coming home for their tea.\x{2014}I saw him, says Paula. \x{2014}He was \x{2013} what he said really brought it home.\x{2014}Yes, he says. \x{2014}I thought so.He looks at her. He's not as tall as Charlo.\x{2014}A nightmare, he says.\x{2014}Yeah.They say nothing for a while. They just walk. She'd prefer to be at home. She thinks she would. They go past the palm trees. The tide's out. He's looking across at the island.\x{2014}Do you play golf, Paula?\x{2014}No.For fuck sake.\x{2014}Do you?\x{2014}Occasionally, he says.\x{2014}That means you're no good at it.He smiles. That's nice.\x{2014}There you have it, he says.He's got a plain jumper on, under his North Face jacket. He's wearing a tie under his jumper.He points the umbrella.\x{2014}There's a couple of oystercatchers.\x{2014}The birds?\x{2014}You're not interested?\x{2014}Not really.\x{2014}Well, look, he says.And he points again.\x{2014}There's an old shopping trolley.She laughs.\x{2014}I know the names of virtually all the birds that inhabit Dublin Bay and you're not impressed.\x{2014}No.They're both a bit lost. He's blushing.\x{2014}Well, she says. \x{2014}I know the names of all the household bleaches and floor cleaners. D'you want to know them?He laughs. He looks at her. He laughs again.\x{2014}How far do we go? she asks.\x{2014}Sutton?\x{2014}Okay. And back?\x{2014}Well, my car's back that way.\x{2014}Okay.Jesus.\x{2014}What's your wife's partner like?\x{2014}What \x{2013} sorry?\x{2014}Did you ever meet her?He's pretending he's slow.\x{2014}Ah, he says. \x{2014}Yes. I did. She's very attractive.\x{2014}Is she middle-aged as well?\x{2014}Yes, he says. \x{2014}I suppose so.She points at the houses across the James Larkin Road, up the embankment.\x{2014}I clean one of them, she says.\x{2014}Really?\x{2014}Yeah. Mondays. It's gas, she says. \x{2014}Your wife and that. You never know what's happening, really. Behind closed doors.\x{2014}Charlie Rich, he says.\x{2014}Who?\x{2014}Charlie Rich sang 'Behind Closed Doors'.\x{2014}You like the music, Joe?\x{2014}I haven't listened to much music in years. I used to. I went to gigs.He grins.\x{2014}D'you know the White Stripes? she says.\x{2014}No.\x{2014}None of your kids?He shrugs.\x{2014}Maybe your wife likes them.He eventually smiles.\x{2014}I went to them last summer, she says. \x{2014}Up in Marlay Park.\x{2014}An outdoor gig.\x{2014}Yep.\x{2014}You're a great girl altogether.She eventually smiles.\x{2014}They were brilliant.\x{2014}Did it not rain?\x{2014}No, she says. \x{2014}It wouldn't have mattered. I'm going to Coldplay in a couple of weeks.Will he want to go too? Is that what he thinks, that she's asking him? She can't see him filling black bags. Squashed into the minibus with the African women.\x{2014}I've heard of them, he says.\x{2014}They're good, she says. \x{2014}But they're not as hard as the White Stripes. Do you get to see her much?\x{2014}I told you, he says.\x{2014}No, you didn't.\x{2014}Yes, I did.He looks at her.\x{2014}No, she says. \x{2014}When?\x{2014}I told you. The most interesting thing about me is the fact that my wife ran away with another woman.\x{2014}Oh. Yeah. Sorry.They get to Sutton. It doesn't rain. They turn back. She'd like a coffee \x{2013} she'd love a gin and tonic, four or five of them \x{2013} but she's not sure she wants to stay with him for that long. She wants to get home. He doesn't suggest it, anyway, a coffee and a bun or anything.They chat. Or they don't. They say nothing. It rains a bit and that's good, because they talk about it. And he gets to hold up his umbrella. She walks under it, beside him.She lets him drive her to the house. She's not fuckin' walking. He stops the car. He turns off the engine. She doesn't invite him in. She can tell, she thinks \x{2013} he wants to get away.\x{2014}Well, she says. \x{2014}That was nice. Thanks.\x{2014}Yes, he says. \x{2014}Thank you.\x{2014}Well\x{2014}\x{2014}Can I phone you?\x{2014}Yeah, she says. \x{2014}That'd be great.She opens the door. He doesn't lean across to kiss her. Thank God \x{2013} she doesn't want that. His hand is on the keys. He's ready to start the car.\x{2014}Bye, she says.\x{2014}Goodbye, he says.She closes the door. It doesn't shut properly. The seat belt's stuck. She does it again.He's gone.She watches the car turn the corner. She kind of misses him, although she's glad she's on her own. She'd like to see him again. It's hard, after so long alone. But he's nice. He is a bit dry \x{2013} Mary's spot-on. His birds of Dublin Bay. Pointing his umbrella. He likes her, though. He listened to her. He laughed. He looked at her once, and she could tell; he wanted to hold her, probably grab her. He wanted to fuck her \x{2013} ta-dah. That's kind of nice, although it's weird as well.She mightn't see him again. But Denise is right. The ocean's full of fish. She'll start hanging around the bottle bank. All she needs is more bottles. There's all sorts of bottles \x{2013} sauce, medicine. She's not looking. She's not desperate. He likes her, though. She saw that.It's ridiculous.It's nice, though.She turns on the radio. It's the end of Joe Duffy. It's a young voice, a girl. And Paula remembers \x{2013} the crash yesterday, in Meath. The girl is talking about her best friend, who's dead. She's on a mobile, Paula thinks \x{2013} she can hear voices and noise behind her. She's probably at the school. The girl talks about them laughing, at the school sports last week. They did the three-legged race together. They fell over. She's clear, she's lovely; she knows her friend is dead. It's heart-breaking but it makes Paula smile. The kid on the radio is just so brilliant and alive.It's over. She turns off the radio.
Leanne looks rough. Paula says nothing. She tries not to look too carefully. She tries not to smell the air. There's nothing she can do.She has to wait. That's all.She has to hope.You were late in last night. She'll say nothing. I didn't hear you come in.Leanne is dressed for work. That's something to clutch. She's going to work. She got up. She'll be going out the door.She's scratching her arms. Paula watches her as she stands looking out the window, waiting for the kettle.\x{2014}I'm going to the doctor tonight.Leanne has turned. Her face is blotched. Her eyes are wet and red.Paula catches up with Leanne's words.\x{2014}Why? she says.\x{2014}Hay fever, says Leanne.Paula tries not to sound too happy.\x{2014}God love you. Is it back?",

            "Every year since she was little. Pollen, dust-mites \x{2013} they all go for Leanne.\x{2014}I thought with all the rain, says Paula. \x{2014}It isn't even warm.Leanne shrugs. She's miserable. Her eyes are full.\x{2014}Those Zirtek tablets worked last year, says Paula. \x{2014} Didn't they?Leanne shrugs.Paula says it \x{2013} she can't stop.\x{2014}I didn't hear you come in last night.Leanne stares at her. Wet, red eyes.\x{2014}Why? she says. \x{2014}Were you passed out?\x{2014}Sorry.\x{2014}Yeah, says Leanne.She picks up her bag as the kettle clicks. She walks past Paula. She doesn't slam the door. Paula hears her heels on the path outside.She knew she was going to say it. She could feel it; she wouldn't resist. She just had to say it. I don't trust you.Ah, Jesus.You've let me down.She watches the steam from the kettle. She makes herself move. She goes to the sink. There's nothing to wash.Nicola rings. It's later. Paula's on the bus. They chat for a bit. Nicola wants to say something. Paula always thinks that.\x{2014}How are the girls?\x{2014}Grand; yeah.\x{2014}Not long now to the holidays.\x{2014}Yeah; Jesus. Still more than a month, though. Look it, I have to go.\x{2014}Okay. Bye, love.\x{2014}Talk to you.Paula puts the phone back in her pocket. She smiles at the Chinese young one who's looking across at her. She's upstairs. She likes what you can see from up here. Behind the garden walls, through upstairs windows.It's three days. Joe hasn't rung her. That's grand. It's a bit disappointing.The bollocks.Her phone rings again. She looks at the name on the screen.John Paul.The jungle drums are out. He's going to give out to her.She's sick of her fuckin' children.\x{2014}Hello, love.\x{2014}Alright?\x{2014}I'm grand. And yourself?Calm down, calm down.\x{2014}Good; yeah. D'you want to come to the house?\x{2014}I'd love to.\x{2014}Cool. We've moved.\x{2014}Cool.Did she just say that? She's falling apart, but this is lovely.\x{2014}Where to? she says. \x{2014}I don't have a pen.\x{2014}I'll come and get you, he says. \x{2014}It's not far from where we were. Sunday; yeah?\x{2014}Lovely, she says.\x{2014}<<Three o'clock|6>>, about.\x{2014}Lovely.It's later; lunchtime. She's home again. She texts Leanne. What's the text for Sorry? Sy? Sry? She writes the full word. Sorry. Xx M. She fires it off. She waits for the buzz. The bitch won't answer. She leaves the phone on the table.She hears the key. Jack walks in. He walks back out.She puts on U2. She turns it up. She'll impress the Poles next door, although they probably won't be there. They come home late. They go off early. Sunday's the only day she really hears them. She sees them go out on the street, in their good clothes. They're the only ones heading off to Mass. She plays it loud anyway. It'll kill everything \x{2013} the guilt, her deafness. She can go to the table and check her phone, because she can't hear it.She picks it up. No text.She's at the press, looking for sugar. She finds the packet of seeds. Empress of India. The flowers look gorgeous. Vibrant flowers on deeply coloured foliage. The planting instructions are on the back. She throws it in the bin.She lies on the bed for an hour. She doesn't close the curtains. She isn't going to sleep.She goes to work. It rains on her. She doesn't care. Only, her feet. They're cold \x{2013} they're wet. There's a leak in her left shoe. More money she doesn't have.Her back is fine. She's grand again. She remembers \x{2013} her thumb. It's gone too, that pain. It's been gone for a while. She's been flinging the buffer around the place. She'd forgotten about it. She looks at the thumb, and she feels her wrist. There's no pain there now; nothing.It's payday. They'll have a takeaway. Leanne could be home by now; it's <<after seven|9f>>. She checks the time on her mobile screen. No text. She's not sure if Jack's working tonight. She could phone Leanne. She should. But it could backfire on her. Are you checking up on me? Leanne was going to the doctor. Paula could text her. Hw doc go? She's not sure. What's the rule? Can you text someone again if they haven't answered the first time? She'll have the Kung Po King Prawn. She likes that. Leanne always has the chicken curry, with chips. She hates rice. Tkaway 2nite? More checking up. One fuckin' mistake. One worry, said out loud.She's not being honest.She unplugs the buffer. She hears herself grunt when she bends. She winds the flex around the handle.She was vicious. There was something there. She wanted to hurt Leanne, to let her know. I don't trust you. She wanted the smell on Leanne's breath. It would have been a relief. The inevitable, out of the way. It's what she expects, for herself. It's a matter of time. It'll happen to Paula. It'll happen to Leanne. She was always there for me.She pushes the buffer to the lift.She hates herself. It's true. She's shit. She's useless.Fuck that. She can beat it away.But it's true.There's chewing gum on the floor of the Ladies. She'll have to get down on her knees. Some slut just dropped it straight out of her mouth. A woman in an office \x{2013} for fuck sake. She gets it up with her house key. She drops the grey gum into her black bag. She washes the key. She washes her hands.She's on the Dart. She holds her mobile. She's hungry. A man gets on at Connolly. Paula gets her knees out of his way. He sits across from her. He reads the Herald. He holds it up to his head. She sees the back page. Liverpool have won that European Cup. CHAMPIONS. They won it last night. John Paul will be delighted. She'll text him. He didn't mention it when he phoned earlier. And he obviously didn't go to Istanbul. But he'll be delighted. Flashing his tattoo. Euro cp, wll dne. XxM. She fires it off. At least some things are working out. She puts the mobile into her pocket. She can take it out when he texts her back. She needs the drama.It's only in her pocket when it rings. The music from Miami Vice. Vanessa, Nicola's little one, did it for her \x{2013} Paula hasn't a clue how. She looks at the screen. It's not John Paul. It's a private number.\x{2014}Paula?\x{2014}Yes.\x{2014}It's Joe.\x{2014}Hello.She feels the heat in her face.\x{2014}How are you?\x{2014}Grand, she says. \x{2014}On my way home from work.\x{2014}Were you working late?\x{2014}No, she says. \x{2014}It's my normal time.\x{2014}Of course, he says. \x{2014}I didn't think.The train stops at Clontarf Road. The man with the Herald gets off. She can stretch her legs. She can slump.\x{2014}So, he says. \x{2014}I was wondering. Should we meet? For a drink, perhaps?\x{2014}I'm an alcoholic, Joe, she says.The train's moving again.It's what she's wanted to say. It's all she's wanted to say. The carriage isn't empty and she couldn't care less. There's no shame.\x{2014}Are you still there, Joe? she says.\x{2014}Yes, he says. \x{2014}I'm here. I've a glass in my hand, actually. I was looking for somewhere to hide it.She laughs.\x{2014}There's no need, she says. \x{2014}I'm fine.\x{2014}You're, is it, recovering?\x{2014}Yeah, she says. \x{2014}Kind of.\x{2014}Good.\x{2014}I haven't had a drink in a good while, she says. \x{2014} Well over a year.\x{2014}Good, he says. \x{2014}A walk.\x{2014}Ah, look it, she says. \x{2014}I work hard, Joe. A walk is too like more work.\x{2014}The pictures. Last offer.\x{2014}Lovely.\x{2014}There's a German one on in the UGC, about the last days of Hitler \x{2014}\x{2014}I hope you enjoy it, Joe, she says. \x{2014}I'm going to The Interpreter.\x{2014}Alright, he says.\x{2014}I like Sean Penn, she says.\x{2014}Fine.\x{2014}He reminds me of my husband.The train's at Killester.\x{2014}Still there, Joe?\x{2014}Just about, he says.\x{2014}Just so you know.The train's moving again.\x{2014}Sunday? he says.\x{2014}Can't, she says. \x{2014}I'm going to my son's.She loves the sound of that. And it's happening.\x{2014}Monday? he says.\x{2014}Grand, she says. \x{2014}After work.There's the little envelope on the screen when she stops talking to Joe. It's from John Paul. Ta. Jp.The house is empty. The telly's off. She takes off her jacket. She goes upstairs. She has a look in Jack's room. His jeans are on the floor, and a T-shirt. He's gone to work. She goes to Leanne's door. She stands there. She wants to go in. She wants to get down and look under the bed. Pull back the duvet, feel the sheet and mattress. But she doesn't.She goes downstairs. She waits for Leanne.
She's walking up Marlborough Street. It's <<about four o'clock|6>>. She's on her way to see Carmel, in the Mater Private. Carmel had her operation yesterday. The mastectomy. Denise phoned Paula last night. Carmel was grand; she was comfortable.She's a bit hot, walking. She comes to a Spar. She takes out her mobile. Nd anythng? She sends it to Carmel. But she doesn't wait. Carmel might be asleep. There'll be more shops on the way. She keeps going.She gets to Parnell Street. She crosses, to Hill Street.Comfortable. It means nothing. She's heard them say it on the News. It means that whoever's been shot isn't dead. She'll be happier when she sees Carmel. She's sure she will. It's gas to think, her sister's in a private hospital. She can't help it; she wants to see what it's like. She'll tell Carmel about Joe. She might. What is there to tell? They went to the pictures. They're going for a drive next Saturday, up the mountains. She can hear Carmel, if she tells her. Bring your condoms, Paula.She'll tell Carmel. A bit of excitement. A bit of crack.She's on Temple Street when she hears and feels the mobile. A text. She opens it. 1 tit. Hpy Brthdy.She laughs. She won't delete this one. She can't wait to see Carmel now. She goes across Dorset Street at the lights \x{2013} they're changing. She runs. A car honks, twice. She doesn't look. It's only some messer.It's her birthday. She's forty-nine. She bought a cake earlier. It's in the fridge. They'll have it when she gets home.",
