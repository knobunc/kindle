The sail was struck, and five men leaped onto the shore with tow lines around their waists.

They strain, leaning forward, and almost imperceptibly the sixty-foot junk begins to move upstream. There is no level towpath. The trackers are rock climbers; they scamper from boulder to boulder, moving higher until the boulders give out, and then dropping down, pulling and climbing until there is a reach on the river where the junk can sail again. The only difference\x{2014}but it is a fairly large one\x{2014}between trackers long ago and trackers today is that they are no longer whipped. \"Often our men have to climb or jump like monkeys,\" wrote a Yangtze traveler, in the middle of the nineteenth century, of his trackers, \"and their backs are lashed by the two chiefs, to urge them to work at critical moments. This new spectacle at first revolts and angers us, but when we see that the men do not complain about the lashings we realize that it is the custom of the country, justified by the exceptional difficulties along the route.\" Captain Little saw a tracker chief strip his clothes off, jump into the river, and roll himself in sand until he looked half human, like a gritty ape.

            'The night before the second H-bomb test, the Kiribati (pronounced "Kiribass") men were taken to a ship that was anchored offshore and shown cowboy movies, cartoons, and British films, one after the other, from <<seven in the evening|5>> until <<four-thirty|5k:0>> the next morning, when suddenly the same searing ear pain returned ("much worse than when you are in an airplane"). The ship shuddered so violently that rust flaked from the ceiling and walls of the cramped cabin in which the 140 islanders sat goggling at the movie screen. The men went up on deck and saw again the aftermath of a thermonuclear explosion. "Like a big flower opening," Ambo said, "the color of clouds, with flames inside."',

            'Those descriptions resonated at the back of Christmas Island\'s lagoon, where it was dark at <<6:20|2>>, and then everything went black: too ambitious a walk or a paddle meant my having to grope back to camp in moon shadow. For four days I saw no other people, and would have stayed longer in the bush but for running low on drinking water. Even so, an old-timer told me that I was only the second person who had ever gone camping on the island.',

            "Shortly after the book was published in the United States, in 1982, the Allie Factor became evident again. The film rights were sold, not as an option or a development deal, but as an outright sale, Jerome Hellman putting all his money down, the way Allie bought Jeronimo. Soon Hellman (the producer of <<Midnight|13>> Cowboy and Coming Home) began to exhibit Allie characteristics: he raved a little, became very stubborn and embattled. When it was suggested by a studio that the movie might be made in Mexico or Jamaica, Hellman insisted that it had to be shot, no matter what the cost, on the actual Mosquito Coast. Off his own bat, Hellman hired Paul Schrader to write the script. It was the most faithful script I had ever read\x{2014}and I thought that was its weakness. When I made a few suggestions, declaring my reluctance to influence him, Schrader said in an Allie-like way, \"I'm not influenceable.\" I said, Isn't the whole point of a good movie that it takes liberties? No movie can be very faithful to the meandering complexities of a long novel, and so it must be good on its own terms\x{2014}a movie has to be true to itself.",

            'Scenes like these disturbed his editor at Putnam\'s, George William Curtis, who felt that Thoreau was belittling Cape Codders. And he found Thoreau\'s religious discussions "heretical." Thoreau sent the articles to Curtis in 1852, but Curtis was obviously fussed by them, because he demanded cuts and dithered until <<1855|9c:0>> before starting publication. When Thoreau saw that Curtis had made further cuts on his own initiative, he reacted snappishly and withdrew the balance of the pieces. Only three installments had appeared. Nevertheless, he had partly fulfilled his intention: his Cape Cod lectures were among his funniest and best received. We have Emerson\'s word on that: "The Concord people laughed till they cried."',
