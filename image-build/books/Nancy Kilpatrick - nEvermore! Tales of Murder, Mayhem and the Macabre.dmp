True, I\x{2019}d stayed up some nights with her until <<two in the morning|5>>, chatting with her on Facebook while she asked me increasingly personal questions about my body and my sexual urges. I\x{2019}d pull back slightly when the questions got too inappropriate, assuming that she was looking for a father figure and didn\x{2019}t know how to go about getting one in a healthy way, or maybe she was just stoned or a little drunk or both. But now I can see what Naomi was after, confirmation that we were not the same, she and I. I was gay; she\x{2019}d been born in the wrong body. Once my answers to her prying questions made this clear, she\x{2019}d pulled away on her own. Stupidly, I had assumed she\x{2019}d gone looking for help from someone else, and I had also, just as stupidly, assumed my sister\x{2019}s stories about being clean and sober for three years now were the truth. Meanwhile, Naomi had done the worst thing a kid in her position could do; she\x{2019}d gone to school.",

Just before graduation, one of my friends had told me about how much he\x{2019}d enjoyed being a volunteer in his home town search and rescue team, so I signed up when I came back from college. By the end of my fifth week, I\x{2019}d been involved with finding a runaway kid who was hiding out in a cave on Mount Yaanek, I\x{2019}d rescued a family dog from a bear trap, and I\x{2019}d tracked down a grandfather with Alzheimer\x{2019}s who\x{2019}d wandered away from home one night. It was <<mid-day|3b>> when I located Grandpa Henry, so the poor old guy had spent the long October night there, turning this way and that, with no idea where he was or why he was there. When I spotted him, he was standing beneath the shade of a sycamore, facing the trunk, chattering. I made out part of it before he knew I was there. \x{201c}\x{2026}they\x{2019}re all here, I seen \x{2018}em but goddamnit I can\x{2019}t remember the names, but I knowed every goddamn one of \x{2018}em, and\x{2014}\x{201d}",
