The arson specialist notes that the fire was started at <<about eight a.m.|9h>>, which is unusual\x{2014}most arsonists like the cover of darkness\x{2014}and even though it was a gloomy winter morning, there was still far more risk of being seen than most serial arsonists would like. The report states that no suspects were detected on any of the local public cams on the streets around the warehouse, but when I dig deeper I can\x{2019}t find any evidence of the footage being pulled together for review. It takes me only ten minutes to isolate a picture of a petite individual wearing a dark hat and black clothes approaching one of the windows of the warehouse, holding something that looks like a bottle with a rag stuffed into it. I would bet a month\x{2019}s allocation that it was Arlington.",
