            'A blurred and flickering black-and-white picture of the centre of the square, captured from a camera mounted on one of the surrounding buildings, presented itself to Harry\'s view. A couple of people were moving across the square, using it as a short-cut to their places of work, but there were two stationary figures, one seated on a bench, reading a newspaper, the other bending over something at the side of the path. The picture was far too fuzzy for any details of clothing or appearance to emerge. But it was only <<a few minutes short of eight o\'clock|10>>. Harry supposed they both had to be candidates.',

            "The bedside telephone roused Harry <<shortly before eight o'clock|6>> the following morning. It had been a late night \x{2014} and a delightfully energetic one. A long lie-in was what Harry's sluggish thought processes told him he needed. But the telephone did not stop ringing. A glance at Donna revealed her to be out for the count. He grabbed the receiver. 'Hello?' he said in a sandpapery sotto voice.",

            'Harry had spent the previous night at the Heathbank Hotel, close to the airport and diplomatically distant from Castlebay. They stopped there to collect his bag. The cycle of the tides had shifted flights to and from Barra into the afternoon since his last visit. The plane was not due to depart for Glasgow until <<4.15|9c:1>>, leaving him with time on his hands. Ailsa was in no hurry to return to Vatersay. It was clear to Harry, indeed, that she was glad of any excuse not to. She drove him out past the airport to a beach at the far northern end of the island, where they strolled across an empty expanse of white sand beneath a wide blue sky mirrored in the glassy plane of the ocean.',

            'The final farewell promised in its way to be the most poignant, manfully though both he and Chipchase would strive to disguise the fact. Harry stayed overnight with Mrs Tandy following his late return to London from Barra and took the train to Swindon the following morning. It had been arranged that he and Chipchase would fit in a couple of hours in the Glue Pot before Jackie drove Harry to Heathrow for his <<4.30|5a:1>> flight to Vancouver.',

It was barely <<past noon|13>> and there were only a few other customers. A tranquil atmosphere prevailed, sunlight shafting hazily through the windows, the past readily conjurable in surroundings that were for Harry instantly and intimately familiar.',
