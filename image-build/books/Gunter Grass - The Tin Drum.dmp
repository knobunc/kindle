You could have seen how expertly my grandmother raked the limp potato tops into tidy piles that morning, ate a hunk of bread at <<noon|13>> smeared with dripping and sweetened with syrup, dug through the field one last time, and sat at last in her skirts between two nearly full baskets. Before the upturned and inwardly tilted soles of her boots, flaring up asthmatically from time to time and sending a flat layer of troubled smoke across the slightly tilted crust of the soil, smoldered a potato-top fire. The year was eighteen ninety-nine, she sat in the heart of Kashubia, near Bissau, nearer still to the brickworks, this side of Ramkau she sat, beyond Viereck, facing the road to Brentau, between Dirschau and Karthaus, with her back toward the black forest of Goldkrug she sat, shoving potatoes under the hot ashes with the charred tip of a hazel stick.',

Twelve raftsmen in all, they steamed upriver on the tugboat Radaune, operated by the sawmill, from Westlich Neuf\x{e4}hr along the Dead Vistula as far as Einlage, then up the Vistula past K\x{e4}semark, Letzkau, Czattkau, Dirschau, and Pieckel, and tied up that evening at Thorn.

The carved green fig ure was barely mounted beneath the bowsprit of the galleon when the maiden, as was customary back then, was tried for witchcraft.

While the trials were still under way in Bruges and causing a stir, since Portinari was a rich man, the galleon with its figurehead fell into the piratical hands of Paul Beneke. Signore Tani, the second merchant, fell beneath a pirate\x{2019}s grappling iron, Paul Beneke was next: a few years later he fell out of favor with the patricians of his native city and was drowned in the courtyard of the Stockturm.

            "Early in the summer of thirty-nine it became clear that in the course of his weekly Party meetings Matzerath had found less compromising skat partners than Polish postal clerks and former scoutmasters. Jan Bronski was forced to recall what camp he was in, and stuck with the post office staff, the lame janitor Kobyella for instance, who, since his service in Marsza\x{142}ek Pi\x{142}sudski\x{2019}s legendary legion, stood an inch or two short on one leg. In spite of his limp, Kobyella was an excellent janitor and thus also a skilled craftsman, who, I hoped, might eventually be kind enough to fix my ailing drum. So it was that every afternoon about six, even in the most oppressive August heat, simply because I could only reach Kobyella through him, I would stand near the Polish settlement waiting for Jan, who normally quit right on time and headed home. He didn\x{2019}t arrive. Without actually asking myself, what is your presumptive father doing after closing time?, I waited, as I often did, <<till seven|9:1>> or <<seven-thirty|20a:1>>. But he didn\x{2019}t arrive. I could have gone to Aunt Hedwig. Jan might be ill, running a fever, or nursing a broken leg in a plaster cast. Oskar stayed where he was and made do with staring now and then at the window and curtains of the postal clerk\x{2019}s flat. A strange shyness kept Oskar from visiting his aunt, whose warm, motherly, bovine eyes saddened him. Nor did he particularly like the children the Bronski marriage had produced, who were his presumptive half brother and half sister. They treated him like a doll. They wanted to play with him, use him as a toy. Why did fifteen-year-old Stephan, who was almost the same age as Oskar, think he had the right to act like a father, always lecturing and talking down to him? And ten-year-old Marga with her pigtails and a face in which the moon was always rising fat and full: did she think Oskar was a spineless doll she could dress, comb, brush, pat into place, and instruct for hours on end? Of course they both saw me as an abnormal, pitiful midget and themselves as healthy, highly promising children who were indeed the darlings of my grandmother Koljaiczek, who, given the way I acted, found it hard to see in me a darling. I had no real interest in fairy tales and picture books. What I wanted from my grandmother, what I picture even today in broad and pleasurable brushstrokes, was quite clear-cut and thus rarely achieved: the moment Oskar saw her he wished, in eager emulation of his grandfather Koljaiczek, to dive beneath her and, if possible, never draw another breath outside her sheltered lee.",

Maria\x{2019}s dress and slip had rolled up over her bra to her armpits. Her panties were dangling from her right foot, which, along with her leg, hung twisted at an ugly angle from the sofa. Her left leg lay hooked over the backrest, as if it weren\x{2019}t involved. Between her legs Matzerath. With his right hand he turned her head aside, the other widened her opening to guide him on his way. Through Matzerath\x{2019}s spread fingers Maria stared sideways at the carpet and seemed to follow its pattern under the table. He\x{2019}d bitten down on a velvet-covered cushion and only let up on the velvet when they talked. For sometimes they talked, without interrupting their labors. Only when the clock struck <<three|11>>-quarters did they both hesitate for as long as it took the chimes to do their duty, and he said, working away as he had before the chimes began, \x{201c}It\x{2019}s a quarter of.\x{201d} And then he wanted to know from her if it was good that way, how he was doing it. She said yes several times and asked him to be careful. He promised her he would. She told him again, urged him to watch it this time. Then he asked if she was nearly there. And she said: I\x{2019}m nearly there. Then she must have had a cramp in the foot hanging from the sofa, for she thrust it into the air, with her panties still clinging to it. Then he bit into the velvet cushion again and she cried out go away, and he tried to but could not, because before he was away Oskar was on top of them both, because I\x{2019}d plunked my drum down on the small of his back and my drumsticks on the tin, because I could no longer stand to hear go away, because my drum drowned out her words, because I could not let him leave as Jan Bronski always left Mama; for Mama too had always cried to Jan to go away, had cried to Matzerath, go away. Then they would fall apart and let the snot splat down somewhere, onto a towel they\x{2019}d brought, or if they couldn\x{2019}t reach that, onto the sofa or even on the carpet. But I couldn\x{2019}t bear to see that. After all, I hadn\x{2019}t gone away. And I was the first one not to, so I\x{2019}m the father and not Matzerath, who believed to the very end he was my father. And yet Jan Bronski was. And that\x{2019}s something I inherited from Jan, that I was there before Matzerath and didn\x{2019}t go away, that I stayed in, let go inside; and what came out was my son, not his. He didn\x{2019}t have a son. He was no real father. Even if he married my poor mama ten times over and married Maria too, because she was pregnant. And that\x{2019}s what people in our building and on our street will surely think. Of course they thought: Matzerath\x{2019}s knocked up Maria and now he\x{2019}s marrying her, with her only seventeen and a half and him forty-five. But she\x{2019}s a hard worker for her age, and as for little Oskar, he should be happy to have her for a stepmother, Maria\x{2019}s more than a stepmother to the poor child, she\x{2019}s like a real mother, though Oskar\x{2019}s not quite right in the head and should really be in an institution, like Silberhammer or the one in Tapiau.",

And Herr Fajngold could confirm this, for he had sprinkled the dead with Lysol, not just one corpse, no, but the dead, why bother with numbers, the dead. And named names for so long it grew tedious, since for me, floating in Lysol, the question of the life and death of a hundred thousand names was less important than the question of whether life, and if not life, then death, had been disinfected in time and thoroughly enough with Herr Fajngold\x{2019}s disinfectants.",
