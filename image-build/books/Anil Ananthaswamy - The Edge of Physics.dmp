            "While the Brashear spectrograph was being installed at the Lowell Observatory, a young astronomer named Vesto Melvin Slipher joined the team, and Lowell tapped him to study the spectra of spiral nebulae. By <<1914|9n:0>>, Slipher had finished observing many nebulae with the new spectrograph, and what he discovered sent shock waves through the astronomical community. Nearly all the spiral nebulae were moving away from us. One particular nebula\x{2014}now called the Sombrero galaxy\x{2014}was speeding away at a stupendous 1,100 kilometers per second. When Slipher announced at the August 1914 meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Evanston, Illinois, that eleven out of fifteen nebulae he observed were redshifted\x{2014}that is, moving away from us\x{2014}he received a standing ovation. It was years before another young astronomer, Edwin Hubble, would use the 100-inch on Mount Wilson to determine the distance to these nebulae, and decades before astronomers figured out the exact implications, but on that August day everyone knew they were hearing something astonishing.",

            'Hubble made an instant impression on Humason. Night assistants, who really run the telescopes at observatories, are notorious for being hard on astronomers, making sure that astronomers earn the respect of the staff. Hubble had passed the test. But the two couldn\'t have been less alike. Hubble\'s pretentious refinements contrasted sharply with Humason\'s earthiness. Humason enjoyed the company of the observatory\'s technicians and workers. An inveterate gambler, he played a mean hand in poker, and often disappeared from the mountain to watch horse races at the Santa Anita racetrack. But Hubble was impressed by Humason\'s skill at working the telescopes and set him on an unlikely path to fame. Having dropped out of school after eighth grade, Humason had become a pack-mule driver for the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1915. Soon he joined the janitorial staff on the mountain, and as a janitor he started helping out with the telescope operations, showing such adeptness that he was promoted to night assistant in 1919 and then to assistant astronomer. He would work with Hubble until <<1953|9c:1>>, and along the way he picked up an honorary doctorate from Sweden\'s Lund University, "making him history\'s only scientist ever to skip from eighth grade to a Ph.D." One of the duo\'s first tasks was to determine the distance to Andromeda, a prominent spiral nebula. But the method Hubble used was not his. Its discoverer was an unassuming woman who often went unmentioned and whose gender would have barred her from observing at Mount Wilson.',

Somewhere up on the summit, inside the Keck II dome, a slitmask moved into position. Once the telescope was locked and tracking, DEIMOS started moving with it. An image of the sky as seen by DEIMOS appeared on the computer screen in Waimea. Four known stars could be seen in square holes at the edges of the slitmask. These were the alignment stars, and they were slightly offcenter. Yan sent commands to the telescope, fine-tuning its position, and checked again. The alignment was better, but not perfect. One more command. A less experienced team might have checked again to see if the stars were centered in their boxes, but Faber and Yan moved on to observing the galaxies. And sure enough, not just the four alignment stars but each one of the <<nearly 140|18:0>> galaxies had lined up with their respective slits. Inside DEIMOS, a grating moved into place. The light from each galaxy was now being split into a spectrum. Three exposures followed. Taking three spectra meant that for each pixel they would have three readings. If any pixel were hit by a cosmic ray, making it brighter than usual, it would be discarded (a cosmic ray is unlikely to hit the same pixel twice in three exposures), and the average of the two dimmer readings would be used.',

            'The apartheid-era government recognized unions for white workers and workers of mixed race (mainly Indians and so-called Coloured, the descendants of marriages between white settlers and Malay slaves or native Khoisans). But unions for black South Africans got no such recognition, leaving them with little or no recourse when things went wrong. A white foreman could fire a black worker because he didn\'t like the man\'s face, or because he was wearing the wrong color shirt. A firing could mean dislocation, for black workers were allowed to stay in "white" urban areas only if they had a job. "Once you lost your job, you were kicked out, and you had to go back to some godforsaken hole in the Transkei or Kwazulu, which many of these guys had never seen in their lives, let alone had a place to go to," Fanaroff recalled over dinner in Johannesburg. All black South Africans had to carry passbooks, endorsed by the authorities, which allowed them to stay in the white areas. A domestic worker, for instance, had such a passbook, and he or she could stay in the backyard of the white family\'s home. Often, the worker\'s spouse and children would sneak in and sleep together in the backyard. "But the police used to raid, at <<three|9:1>> or <<four o\'clock in the morning|6>>, and inspect the backyards," Fanaroff said. "And if they found people there, they\'d arrest them and put them in jail."',

            'One of the odd things about the Square Kilometre Array is that it might become the last giant radio telescope operating at centimeter and meter wavelengths to be built. Its sheer size means that the best way to build a bigger telescope will be to just add antennas to the SKA. Or build telescopes that look entirely different from the Square Kilometre Array, using technologies that are unimaginable today. The SKA will be magnificent in scale. After years of wrangling, astronomers have settled on using about three thousand small-diameter dishes to receive signals of frequencies ranging from <<1 to 10|10a:0>> gigahertz, with the hope of someday extending the upper limit to 35 gigahertz. For lower frequencies, going down from 1 gigahertz to <<about 100|18:0>> megahertz, and possibly even down to 70 megahertz, the SKA will most likely use what are called phased arrays.',

I opted to sleep in a snow trench, and in a moment of misguided adventurism I decided to dig the trench myself. Shovel in hand, I gouged out a coffinlike cavity about three feet deep, narrow at the top and wider at the bottom. It was just roomy enough to accommodate an insulating mat and sleeping bag.

            "Fermilab's Dan Hooper has identified another possible test for IceCube, and it has to do with cosmic rays. Normally, cosmic rays are composed of charged particles, which are deflected by intervening magnetic fields, so it's difficult to work out their source. But if astronomers can find cosmic rays coming directly from some source, it will most likely be made of neutral particles, mainly neutrons. (There is speculation of just such a source in the Cygnus region of the Milky Way, but it remains controversial.) When neutrons decay, they produce electron neutrinos. These neutrinos will oscillate as they travel through space, and some of them will have turned into tau and muon neutrinos by the time they reach Earth. Hooper's calculations for a potential source in the Cygnus region show that the neutrinos are expected in ratios of 56:<<24:20|2>>\x{2014}for electron, muon, and tau neutrinos, respectively. But if spacetime is foamy, then these neutrino types should interact with the fabric of spacetime and \"decohere,\" leading to an equal mix of all three types. So, if IceCube were to see an equal split of neutrino types from the Cygnus region instead of the 56:<<24:20|2>> ratio expected of smooth spacetime, it would be hard to explain without invoking quantum gravity. But Hooper is aware that such a measurement is a long way off, given that we have yet to see even a single neutrino from such distant sources. Also, the source has to be distant enough for quantum decoherence to become a factor\x{2014}and theories are of no help at this time in predicting just how far away a source of electron neutrinos needs to be to allow us to observe this effect. It will take some luck for IceCube to stumble on the right source at the right distance. \"Stars have to align a little bit, and sometimes they do,\" said Hooper, somewhat wistfully.",

The beams are not a continuous stream of particles; rather, each beam is made up of bunches of protons. Going around the tunnel will be 2,808 such bunches in each direction. When they cross paths, at <<four|9:0>> specific points, only about twenty of the 200 billion protons that make up the two bunches will collide; the rest will continue their journey around the accelerator unimpeded.

When the LHC is running, there's a new sound: the roar of the proton beams themselves entering the cavern\x{2014}and the thunderclap of protons smashing into each other. In 2004, engineers tested a prototype proton beam slamming into a target. The test was necessary to develop the technology to stop the real beam in a hurry in case it went awry. This is an accelerator physicist's nightmare. A lost beam\x{2014}essentially, particles that cannot be kept on the straight and narrow as they go around the tunnel\x{2014}is dangerous. When running at full throttle, each of the LHC's counterrotating proton beams has an energy of <<about 360|18:1>> megajoules, equivalent to the energy of a 400-ton high-speed train traveling at 150 kilometers per hour. Such an errant beam, which is capable of melting a 500-kilogram block of copper, has to be stopped instantly, or it can wreak havoc on the delicate instruments, literally liquefying anything directly in its path. It can take weeks if not months or years to repair the damage. In the 2004 test, physicists redirected a 450 GeV beam into an auxiliary tunnel and dumped it into a target. Microphones picked up the gunshot-like bang. If the two LHC beams, each at 7 TeV, have to be dumped, they will smash into their target with the sound of 150 kilograms of TNT.",
