            "Right: fucking bastards. Except to Adrian, who listened to our denunciations, but rarely joined in. And yet, it seemed to us, he had more cause than most. His mother had walked out years before, leaving his dad to cope with Adrian and his sister. This was long before the term \x{201c}single-parent family\x{201d} came into use; back then it was \x{201c}a broken home,\x{201d} and Adrian was the only person we knew who came from <<one|9c:0>>. This ought to have given him a whole storetank of existential rage, but somehow it didn\x{2019}t; he said he loved his mother and respected his father. Privately, the three of us examined his case and came up with a theory: that the key to a happy family life was for there not to be a family\x{2014}or at least, not one living together. Having made this analysis, we envied Adrian the more.",

            "I don\x{2019}t want to give the impression that all I did at Bristol was work and see Veronica. But few other memories come back to me. One that does\x{2014}one single, distinct event\x{2014}was the night I witnessed the Severn Bore. The local paper used to print a timetable, indicating where best to catch it and when. But the first occasion I tried, the water didn\x{2019}t seem to be obeying its instructions. Then, one evening at Minsterworth, a group of us waited on the riverbank until <<after midnight|13>> and were eventually rewarded. For an hour or two we observed the river flowing gently down to the sea as all good rivers do. The moon\x{2019}s intermittent lighting was assisted by the occasional explorations of a few powerful torches. Then there was a whisper, and a craning of necks, and all thoughts of damp and cold vanished as the river simply seemed to change its mind, and a wave, two or three feet high, was heading towards us, the water breaking across its whole width, from bank to bank. This heaving swell came level with us, surged past, and curved off into the distance; some of my mates gave chase, shouting and cursing and falling over as it outpaced them; I stayed on the bank by myself. I don\x{2019}t think I can properly convey the effect that moment had on me. It wasn\x{2019}t like a tornado or an earthquake (not that I\x{2019}d witnessed either)\x{2014}nature being violent and destructive, putting us in our place. It was more unsettling because it looked and felt quietly wrong, as if some small lever of the universe had been pressed, and here, just for these minutes, nature was reversed, and time with it. And to see this phenomenon after dark made it the more mysterious, the more otherworldly.",

            "How did people in the old days bear it when letters took so long to arrive? I suppose three weeks waiting for the postman then must equate to three days waiting for an email. How long can three days feel? Long enough for a full sense of reward. Veronica hadn\x{2019}t even deleted my heading\x{2014}\x{201c}Hello again?\x{201d}\x{2014}which now struck me as rather winsome. But she can\x{2019}t have taken offence, because she was giving me a rendezvous, a week hence, at <<five in the afternoon|9a>>, at an unfamiliar Tube station in north London.",

            "I\x{2019}d noticed\x{2014}well, I would\x{2014}that parking restrictions only applied between the hours of <<ten|20>> and <<midday|13>>. Probably to discourage commuters from driving this far into town, dumping their cars for the day, and carrying on in by Tube. So I decided to take my car this time: a VW Polo whose tyres would last a lot longer than Veronica\x{2019}s. After a purgatorial hour or so on the North Circular, I found myself in position, parked where we had been before, facing up the slight incline of a suburban street, with the late-afternoon sun catching the dust on a privet hedge. Bands of schoolchildren were on their way home, boys with shirts out of their trousers, girls with provocatively high skirts; many on mobile phones, some eating, a few smoking. When I\x{2019}d been at school we were told that as long as you were in the uniform you had to behave in a way that reflected well on the institution. So no eating or drinking in the street; while anyone caught smoking would be beaten. Nor was fraternisation with the opposite sex allowed: the girls\x{2019} school linked to ours and quartered nearby used to let its pupils out fifteen minutes before the boys were freed, giving them time to get well clear of their predatory and priapic male counterparts. I sat there remembering all this, registering the differences, without coming to any conclusions. I neither applauded nor disapproved. I was indifferent; I had suspended my right to thoughts and judgements. All I cared about was why I had been brought to this street a couple of weeks previously. So I sat with my window down and waited.",
