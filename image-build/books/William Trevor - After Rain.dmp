It was absurd to spend all morning looking after children in a nursery school and all afternoon neglecting your own. That Jason and Ben had been sent back early that day, that she had been informed of this beforehand and had forgotten, that she would naturally have been there had she remembered: all this was mere verbiage apparently, not worth listening to, much less considering. Mrs Sleet left the house at <<one o\x{2019}clock|6>> on the dot, and Francesca was almost always back by three, long before the boys returned.

Not wishing to become involved in what he described as \x{2018}obviously something tacky\x{2019}, the window-cleaner remounted his bicycle and rode on; an hour later schoolchildren reported a dead body in the bushes in Old Engine Way.

At <<midday|13>> on that same day, in broadcasting news of the tragedy, a radio announcer drew attention to this fact, stating that a man was helping the police with their enquiries.

            'At <<fifteen minutes past five|10>>, fear sets in, the same fear there was on the terrace of the Hotel St-Georges when the letter was still between her fingers. He will go from her; it is pity that keeps him with a barren woman; he will find the courage, and with it will come the hardness of heart that is not naturally his. Then he will go.',

            'Once, not long ago - or maybe it was a year or so ago, hard to be accurate now - she said on an impulse that she had been wrong to resist the adoption of an unwanted child, wrong to say a child for them must only be his and hers. In response he shook his head. Adoption would not be easy now, he said, in their middle age, and that was that. Some other day, on the television, there was a woman who took an infant from a pram, and she felt sympathy for that woman then, though no one else did. Whenever she saw a baby in a pram she thought of the woman taking it, and at other times she thought of that girl who walked away with the baby she was meant to be looking after, and the woman who took one from a hospital ward. When she told him she felt sympathy he put his arms around her and wiped away her tears. This afternoon, the fear lasts for half an hour; then, at a <<quarter to six|10>>, it is so much nonsense. Never in a thousand years would he develop that hardness of heart.',

            "At <<five to seven|10>>, acting instinctively as she does every evening at about this time, Mrs Lethwes washes the blue plastic beaker and replaces it in the bathroom. Twice, before she hears the car wheels on the tarmac, she raises the gin bottle directly to her lips, then pours herself, conventionally, a cocktail of Gordon\x{2019}s and Martini. She knows it will happen tonight. She knows he will enter with a worry in his features and stand by the door, not coming forward for a moment, that then he\x{2019}ll pour himself a drink, too, and sit down slowly and begin to tell her. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m sorry,\x{2019} is probably how he\x{2019}ll put it, and she\x{2019}ll stop him, telling him she can guess. And after he has spoken for twenty minutes, covering all the ground that has been lost, she\x{2019}ll say, of course: \x{2018}The child must come here.\x{2019}",

Over the years he had arrived in all seasons and at varying times of day, once rousing us at <<two o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>. Invariably he brought with him details of a personal disaster which had left him with the need to borrow a little money. These loans were not paid back; even as he accepted them he made no pretence that they would be.",
