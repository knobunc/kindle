            "There is a clear biological basis to this, and perhaps unsurprisingly, it\x{2019}s all down to genes and chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells, and inherited one of each pair from each parent. Twenty-two of these pairs (imaginatively named chromosomes <<1 to 22|10a:0>>) are called autosomes and each member of a specific pair of autosomes looks very similar. By \x{2018}looks\x{2019} we mean exactly that. At a certain stage in cell division the DNA in chromosomes becomes exceptionally tightly coiled up. If we use the right techniques we can actually see chromosomes down a microscope. These chromosomes can be photographed. In pre-digital days, clinical geneticists literally used to cut out the pictures of the individual chromosomes with a pair of scissors and rearrange them in pairs to create a nice orderly picture. These days the image processing can be carried out by a computer, but in either case the result is a picture of all the chromosomes in a cell. This picture is called a karyotype.",

            "Sometimes the match from <<2|20b>> to <<8|20a>> is not perfect, but it\x{2019}s still close enough for the two molecules to pair up. In these cases, binding of the miRNA prevents translation of the mRNA into protein (this is what happened in the case shown in Figure 10.3). If, however, the match is perfect, the binding of miRNA to mRNA triggers destruction of the mRNA, by enzymes that attach to the miRNA19. It\x{2019}s not yet clear if positions <<9 to 21|10a:0>> on the miRNAs also influence in a less direct way how these small molecules are targeted, or what the consequences of their targeting are. One thing we do know, however, is that a single miRNA can regulate more than one mRNA molecule. We saw in Chapter 3 how one gene could encode lots of different protein molecules, by altering the way in which messenger RNA is spliced. A single miRNA can influence many of these differently spliced versions simultaneously. Alternatively, a single miRNA can also influence quite unrelated proteins that are encoded by different genes but have similar 3\x{2032} UTR sequences.",

Once an ncRNA has been produced, human cells use various mechanisms to modify it yet further. In particular, they will often change the base\x{a0}<<A to one|10>> called I (inosine). Base\x{a0}A can bind to T in DNA, or U in RNA. But base\x{a0}I can pair with A, C or G. This alters the sequences to which an ncRNA can bind and hence regulate.",

It\x{2019}s difficult to get definitive costs for how much clinical trials cost, but based on data from <<2007|9c:0>>, a value of \$20,000 per patient is probably a conservative estimate24.

Ninety-five per cent of people who have a form of cancer called chronic myeloid leukaemia have the Philadelphia chromosome in their cancer cells. This abnormal chromosome causes this cancer in the cells of the immune system because of where the breaking and rejoining happen in the genome. The fusion of the two chromosome regions results in the creation of a hybrid gene called Bcr-Abl. The protein encoded by this hybrid gene drives cell proliferation forwards very aggressively.",

It concerns a rare genetic disease called hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy, which causes premature death through strokes. In the Icelandic families in which some people suffer from the disease, the patients carry a particular mutation in the key gene. Because of the relatively isolated nature of Icelandic societies, and the country\x{2019}s excellent record keeping, researchers were able to trace this disease back through the affected families. What they found was quite remarkable. Until <<about 1820|9c:0>>, people with this mutation lived until around the age of 60 before they succumbed to the disease. Between 1820 and 1900, the life expectancy for those with the same disorder dropped to about 30 years of age, which is where it has remained. The scientists speculated in their original paper that an environmental change in the period from 1820 onwards altered the way that cells respond to and control the effects of the mutation11.",
