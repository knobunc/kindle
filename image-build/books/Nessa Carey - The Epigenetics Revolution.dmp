            "That\x{2019}s why there was such a furore in 1996 when Keith Campbell and Ian Wilmut at the Roslin Institute created the first mammalian clone, Dolly the sheep6. Like John Gurdon, they used SCNT. In the case of Dolly, the scientists transferred the nucleus from a cell in the mammary gland of an adult ewe into an unfertilised sheep egg from which they had removed the original nucleus. Then they transplanted this into the uterus of a recipient ewe. Pioneers of cloning were nothing if not obsessively persistent. Campbell and Wilmut performed <<nearly 300|18:0>> nuclear transfers before they obtained that one iconic animal, which now revolves in a glass case in the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh. Even today, when all sorts of animals have been cloned, from racehorses to prize cattle and even pet dogs and cats, the process is incredibly inefficient. Two questions have remained remarkably pertinent since Dolly tottered on her soon to be prematurely arthritic legs into the pages of history. The first is why is cloning animals so inefficient? The second is why are the animals so often less healthy than \x{2018}natural\x{2019} offspring? The answer in both cases is epigenetics, and the molecular explanations will become apparent as we move through our exploration of the field. But before we do, we\x{2019}re going to take our cue from H. G. Wells\x{2019}s time traveller and fast-forward over thirty years from John Gurdon in Cambridge to a laboratory in Japan, where an equally obsessive scientist has found a completely new way of cloning animals from adult cells.",

A methyl group is very small. It\x{2019}s just one carbon atom linked to three hydrogen atoms. Chemists describe atoms and molecules by their \x{2018}molecular weight\x{2019}, where the atom of each element has a different weight. The average molecular weight of a base-pair is <<around 600|18:0>> Da (the Da stands for Daltons, the unit that is used for molecular weight). A methyl group only weighs 15 Da. By adding a methyl group the weight of the base-pair is only increased by 2.5 per cent. A bit like sticking a grape on a tennis ball.",

Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes in their cells, and inherited one of each pair from each parent. Twenty-two of these pairs (imaginatively named chromosomes <<1 to 22|10a:0>>) are called autosomes and each member of a specific pair of autosomes looks very similar. By \x{2018}looks\x{2019} we mean exactly that. At a certain stage in cell division the DNA in chromosomes becomes exceptionally tightly coiled up. If we use the right techniques we can actually see chromosomes down a microscope. These chromosomes can be photographed. In pre-digital days, clinical geneticists literally used to cut out the pictures of the individual chromosomes with a pair of scissors and rearrange them in pairs to create a nice orderly picture. These days the image processing can be carried out by a computer, but in either case the result is a picture of all the chromosomes in a cell. This picture is called a karyotype.",

            "Sometimes the match from <<2 to 8|10a:0>> is not perfect, but it\x{2019}s still close enough for the two molecules to pair up. In these cases, binding of the miRNA prevents translation of the mRNA into protein (this is what happened in the case shown in Figure 10.3). If, however, the match is perfect, the binding of miRNA to mRNA triggers destruction of the mRNA, by enzymes that attach to the miRNA19. It\x{2019}s not yet clear if positions <<9 to 21|10a:0>> on the miRNAs also influence in a less direct way how these small molecules are targeted, or what the consequences of their targeting are. One thing we do know, however, is that a single miRNA can regulate more than one mRNA molecule. We saw in Chapter 3 how one gene could encode lots of different protein molecules, by altering the way in which messenger RNA is spliced. A single miRNA can influence many of these differently spliced versions simultaneously. Alternatively, a single miRNA can also influence quite unrelated proteins that are encoded by different genes but have similar 3\x{2032} UTR sequences.",

Once an ncRNA has been produced, human cells use various mechanisms to modify it yet further. In particular, they will often change the base\x{a0}<<A to one|10>> called I (inosine). Base\x{a0}A can bind to T in DNA, or U in RNA. But base\x{a0}I can pair with A, C or G. This alters the sequences to which an ncRNA can bind and hence regulate.",

Ninety-five per cent of people who have a form of cancer called chronic myeloid leukaemia have the Philadelphia chromosome in their cancer cells.

Between 1820 and 1900, the life expectancy for those with the same disorder dropped to about 30 years of age, which is where it has remained.
