            "Miles smiled at her and she waved, but when he motioned for her to join him, she shook her head. It was unseasonably warm, and all around her, people were partying in that intensely determined way that happened only on New Year\x{2019}s Eve <<after midnight|13>>: This will be the most fun we\x{2019}ve ever had; we will do and say outrageous things; we are loving our lives and everyone around us. The massive hot tub was packed with a dozen revelers, all with drinks in hand, and another group sat around the perimeter, content to dangle their feet while they waited for a few inches of space to free up. On the deck above the pool a DJ blasted remixed hip-hop, and dancers everywhere\x{2014}on the patio, in the pool, on the pool deck, streaming in and out of the house\x{2014}all moved happily to his playlist. On the chair to Emily\x{2019}s left, a young girl wearing only bikini bottoms straddled a guy and massaged his shoulders while her bare breasts dangled freely. She worked her way down his back and began a rather aggressive handling of his glutes. She was twenty-three, twenty-five at most, and while her body was far from perfect\x{2014}slightly rounded belly and overly curvy thighs\x{2014}her arms didn\x{2019}t jiggle and her neck didn\x{2019}t sag. No crepey anything. Just youth. None of the small indignities of Emily\x{2019}s own body at thirty-six: light stretch marks on her hips; cleavage with just the smallest hint of sag; some errant dark hairs along her bikini line that just seemed to sprout now willy-nilly, indifferent to Emily\x{2019}s indefatigable waxing schedule. It wasn\x{2019}t a horror show, exactly\x{2014}she still looked thin and tan, maybe even downright hot in her elegant Eres two-piece\x{2014}but it was getting harder with every passing year.",

Every thirty seconds or so he would lift his head and look directly at Emily and give her that smile, the one that confirmed she was the only one in the room. Which of course she was, because she was riding on Karolina\x{2019}s Peloton, and the hot instructor was on the screen, and his direct eye contact with Emily was actually shared with 1,294 other home riders. No matter. She could sweat with him and his alt-country playlist all night long. She had no idea what had inspired her to get off her ass in this beautiful, empty house and get on the bike at <<ten o\x{2019}clock in the evening|6>>, but she was going with it. This beat SoulCycle any day of the week: no people, no socializing, and she could spin in her sports bra and a pair of ripped spandex shorts.
