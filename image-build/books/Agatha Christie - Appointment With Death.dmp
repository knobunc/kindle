We can suppose that he killed his mother at <<ten minutes to six|10>> when he went up to speak to her. There were boys about the camp, true, but the light was fading. It might have been managed, but it then follows that Miss King lied. Remember, she came back to the camp only five minutes after Raymond. From the distance she would see him go up to his mother.

According to Lady Westholme and Miss Pierce, she was alive at <<four-sixteen|3b>> when they started on their walk. That leaves exactly twenty minutes unaccounted for.

Therefore it is perfectly possible for Dr Gerard to have committed the crime. Being a doctor, he could easily counterfeit the appearance of malaria. There is, I should say, a possible motive.
