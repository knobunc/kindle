Like many male employees here, he wears open-toed slippers over socks.

In the aftermath, the hatch between the two modules was shut, the Japanese crew member quit, and Lapierre complained to IBMP and to the Canadian Space Agency.

The brain compressed enough into the top of the skull that it separated from the spinal cord. That should have happened to me.\x{201d} He could also have died from redout, wherein blood is spun into the brain with enough force to rupture vessels.
