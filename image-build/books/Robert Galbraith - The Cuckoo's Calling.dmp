In the giddy relief following her acceptance, he confessed that he had been planning to pop the question in the Thai restaurant where they just had eaten dinner, but that he had reckoned without the silent couple beside them, who had eavesdropped on their entire conversation. He had therefore suggested a walk through the darkening streets, in spite of Robin\x{2019}s protests that they both needed to be up early, and finally inspiration had seized him, and he had led her, bewildered, to the steps of the statue. There, flinging discretion to the chilly wind (in a most un-Matthew-like way), he had proposed, on one knee, in front of three down-and-outs huddled on the steps, sharing what looked like a bottle of meths.",

The first, at <<9.15 in the morning|2a>>, had been to Evan Duffield; the second, at <<9.35|9e>>, to Ciara Porter. There followed a gap of hours, in which she had spoken to nobody on the mobile, and then, at <<1.21|9e>>, she had begun a positive frenzy of telephoning two numbers, almost alternately. One of these was Duffield\x{2019}s; the other belonged, according to the crabbed scribble beside the number\x{2019}s first appearance, to Tony Landry. Again and again she had telephoned these two men. Here and there were gaps of twenty minutes or so, during which she made no calls; then she would begin telephoning again, doubtless hitting \x{2018}redial\x{2019}.
