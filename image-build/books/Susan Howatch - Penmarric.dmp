Even though I was comparatively inactive sweat was pouring off my body and dust was pricking my nose and making me uncomfortable.

Other guests began to appear, and, glancing over my shoulder, I saw Mariana and Lizzie with the Carnforths; they were both staying at Carnforth Hall with Sir Justin and Alice, who were just home from their honeymoon, Mariana\x{2019}s husband, now a chronic invalid, had once again been left behind in Scotland. Rebecca came with my nephew Jonas, a tough two-year-old with Hugh\x{2019}s eyes and Rebecca\x{2019}s wide sullen mouth; Jonas\x{2019}s sister Deborah, who was the youngest bridesmaid, was by that time at Polzillan House with Esmond, the page, and the two adult bridesmaids, Jeanne and a friend of Helena\x{2019}s from Warwickshire called Charlotte. After Rebecca\x{2019}s arrival I saw Helena\x{2019}s other friends from Warwickshire enter the church; I had met them the week before while they had been staying at Polzillan House and now recognized each one in turn. The St. Enedocs came from St. Ives, the Trehearnes from Helston, the Kehellands from Lelant, the Tregothas from St. Erth; I lost count of the county faces I knew so well. The Penmarric and Polzillan servants, stiffly dressed in their Sunday best, tiptoed into the back pews, and at the far end of the church beneath the bell tower sat a few of the miners from Sennen Garth, the ones who had been successful in the lottery held to decide who should have the limited number of temporary seats available. Trevose by his own choice was not among them.",
