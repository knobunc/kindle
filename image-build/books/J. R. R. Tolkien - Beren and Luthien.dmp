            "But one night a dream of the Valar came to Tin\x{fa}viel and she dreamt of Beren, and her heart said: \x{2018}Let me be gone to seek him whom all others have forgot\x{2019}; and waking, the moon was shining through the trees, and she pondered very deeply how she might escape. Now Tin\x{fa}viel daughter of Gwendeling was not ignorant of magics or of spells, as may well be believed, and after much thought she devised a plan. The next day she asked those who came to her to bring, if they would, some of the clearest water of the stream below, \x{2018}but this,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}must be drawn at <<midnight|13>> in a silver bowl, and brought to my hand with no word spoken,\x{2019} and after that she desired wine to be brought, \x{2018}but this,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}must be borne hither in a flagon of gold at <<noon|13>>, and he who brings it must sing as he comes,\x{2019} and they did as they were bid, but Tinwelint was not told.",

Here doth it widen out and fare down narrow channels filled with boulders atween long spits of shingle and stones less great. Now did Naugladur slip from his burdened horse and prepare to get him over, for the armed host of the vanguard had climbed already the further bank, and it was great and sheer and thick with trees, and the bearers of the gold were some already stepped thereon and some amidmost of the stream, but the armed men of the rear were resting awhile.',
