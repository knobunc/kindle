            "These people, in other words, had more than the subjection of Satan on their minds. Beginning in the sixteenth century, a great epistemological shift had taken place in which knowledge of every kind was transferred to, and made manifest through, the printed page. \x{201c}More than any other device,\x{201d} Lewis Mumford wrote of this shift, \x{201c}the printed book released people from the domination of the immediate and the local; ... print made a greater impression than actual events.... To exist was to exist in print: the rest of the world tended gradually to become more shadowy. Learning became book-leaming.\x{201d} 9 In light of this, we may assume that the schooling of the young was understood by the colonists not only as a moral duty but as an intellectual imperative. (The England from which they came was an island of schools. By <<1660|9n:0>>, for example, there were 444 schools in England, one school approximately every twelve miles.10) And it is clear that growth in literacy was closely connected to schooling. Where schooling was not required (as in Rhode Island) or weak school laws prevailed (as in New Hampshire), literacy rates increased more slowly than elsewhere.",

            "One significant implication of this situation is that no literary aristocracy emerged in Colonial America. Reading was not regarded as an elitist activity, and printed matter was spread evenly among all kinds of people. A thriving, classless reading culture developed because, as Daniel Boorstin writes, \x{201c}It was diffuse. Its center was everywhere because it was nowhere: Every man was close to what [printed matter] talked about. Everyone could speak the same language. It was the product of a busy, mobile, public society.\x{201d}<<13|5g:0>> By 1772, Jacob Duch\x{e9} could write: \x{201c}The poorest labourer upon the shore of the Delaware thinks himself entitled to deliver his sentiment in matters of religion or politics with as much freedom as the gentleman or scholar.... Such is the prevailing taste for books of every kind, that almost every man is a reader.\x{201d} 14",

            "Yet by the late seventeenth century, there was a beginning to a native literature that turned out to have as much to do with the typographic bias of American culture as books. I refer, of course, to the newspaper, at which Americans first tried their hand on September 25,1690, in Boston, when Benjamin Harris printed the first edition of a three-page paper he called Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick. Before he came to America, Harris had played a role in \x{201c}exposing\x{201d} a nonexistent conspiracy of Catholics to slaughter Protestants and burn London. His London newspaper, Domestick Intelligence, revealed the \x{201c}Popish plot,\x{201d} with the result that Catholics were harshly persecuted. 20 Harris, no stranger to mendacity, indicated in his prospectus for Publick Occurrences that a newspaper was necessary to combat the spirit of lying which then prevailed in Boston and, I am told, still does. He concluded his prospectus with the following sentence: \x{201c}It is suppos\x{2019}d that none will dislike this Proposal but such as intend to be guilty of so villainous a crime.\x{201d} Harris was right about who would dislike his proposal. The second issue of Publick Occurrences never appeared. The Governor and Council suppressed it, complaining that Harris had printed \x{201c}reflections of a very high nature,\x{201d}<<21|5g:0>> by which they meant that they had no intention of admitting any impediments to whatever villainy they wished to pursue. Thus, in the New World began the struggle for freedom of information which, in the Old, had begun a century before.",

            "Harris\x{2019} abortive effort inspired other attempts at newspaper publication: for example, the Boston News-Letter, published in 1704, generally regarded as the first continuously published American newspaper. This was followed by the Boston Gazette  (in 1719) and the New-England Courant (in 1721), whose editor, James Franklin, was the older brother of Benjamin. By <<1730|9n:0>>, there were seven newspapers published regularly in four colonies, and by <<1800|9n:0>> there were more than 180. In 1770, the New  York Gazette congratulated itself and other papers by writing (in part):\x{2018}Tis truth (with deference to the college)  
Newspapers are the spring of Knowledge,  
The general source throughout the nation,  
Of every modern conversation.22",

            'At the time Tocqueville was making his observations of America, printing had already spread to all the regions of the country. The South had lagged behind the North not only in the formation of schools (almost all of which were private rather than public) but in its uses of the printing press. Virginia, for example, did not get its first regularly published newspaper, the  Virginia Gazette, until <<1736|9n:0>>. But toward the end of the eighteenth century, the movement of ideas via the printed word was relatively rapid, and something approximating a national conversation emerged. For example, the Federalist Papers, an outpouring of eighty-five, essays written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay (all under the name of Publius) originally appeared in a New York newspaper during 1787 and 1788 but were read almost as widely in the South as the North.',

            "As America moved into the nineteenth century, it did so as a fully print-based culture in all of its regions. Between 1825 and 1850, the number of subscription libraries trebled.27 What were called \x{201c}mechanics\x{2019} and apprentices\x{2019} libraries\x{201d}\x{2014}that is, libraries intended for the working class\x{2014}also emerged as a force for literacy. In 1829, the New York Apprentices\x{2019} Library housed ten thousand volumes, of which 1,600 apprentices drew books. By <<1857|9n:0>>, the same library served three-quarters of a million people. 28 Aided by Congress\x{2019} lowering of the postal rates in 1851, the penny newspaper, the periodical, the Sunday school tract, and the cheaply bound book were abundantly available. Between 1836 and 1890, 107 million copies of the McGuffey Reader  were distributed to the schools.29 And although the reading of novels was not considered an altogether reputable use of time, Americans devoured them. Of Walter Scott\x{2019}s novels, published  between 1814 and 1832, Samuel Goodrich wrote: \x{201c}The appearance of a new novel from his pen caused a greater sensation in the United States than did some of the battles of Napoleon. ... Everybody read these works; everybody\x{2014}the refined and the simple.\x{201d} 30 Publishers were so anxious to make prospective best sellers available, they would sometimes dispatch messengers to incoming packet boats and \x{201c}within a single day set up, printed and bound in paper covers the most recent novel of Bulwer or Dickens.\x{201d} 31 There being no international copyright laws, \x{201c}pirated\x{201d} editions abounded, with no complaint from the public, or much from authors, who were lionized. When Charles Dickens visited America in 1842, his reception equaled the adulation we offer today to television stars, quarterbacks, and Michael Jackson. \x{201c}I can give you no conception of my welcome,\x{201d} Dickens wrote to a friend. \x{201c}There never was a King or Emperor upon earth so cheered and followed by the crowds, and entertained at splendid balls and dinners and waited upon by public bodies of all kinds.... If I go out in a carriage, the crowd surrounds it and escorts me home; if I go to the theater, the whole house ... rises as one man and the timbers ring again.\x{201d}32 A native daughter, Harriet Beecher Stowe, was not offered the same kind of adoring attention\x{2014}and, of course, in the South, had her carriage been surrounded, it would not have been for the purpose of escorting her home\x{2014}but her Uncle Tom\x{2019}s Cabin sold 305,000 copies in its first year, the equivalent of four million in today\x{2019}s America.",

            "In addition, they were astounded by the near universality of lecture halls in which stylized oral performance provided a continuous reinforcement of the print tradition. Many of these lecture halls originated as a result of the Lyceum Movement, a form of adult education. Usually associated with the efforts of Josiah Holbrook, a New England farmer, the Lyceum Movement had as its purpose the diffusion of knowledge, the promotion of common schools, the creation of libraries and, especially, the establishment of lecture halls. By <<1835|9n:0>>, there were more than three thousand Lyceums in fifteen states.34  Most of these were located east of the Alleghenies, but by 1840, they were to be found at the edges of the frontier, as far west as Iowa and Minnesota. Alfred Bunn, an Englishman on an extensive tour through America, reported in 1853 that \x{201c}practically every village had its lecture hall.\x{201d} 35 He added: \x{201c}It is a matter of wonderment ... to witness the youthful workmen, the over-tired artisan, the worn-out factory girl ... rushing ... after the toil of the day is over, into the hot atmosphere of a crowded lecture room.\x{201d}36 Bunn\x{2019}s countryman J. F. W. Johnston attended lectures at this time at the Smithsonian Institution and \x{201c}found the lecture halls jammed with capacity audiences of 1200 and 1500 people.\x{201d}37 Among the lecturers these audiences could hear were the leading intellectuals, writers and humorists (who were also writers) of their time, including Henry Ward Beecher, Horace Greeley, Louis Agassiz and Ralph Waldo Emerson (whose fee for a lecture was fifty dollars).38 In his autobiography, Mark Twain devotes two chapters to his experiences as a lecturer on the Lyceum circuit. \x{201c}I began as a lecturer in 1866 in California arid Nevada,\x{201d} he wrote. \x{201c}[I] lectured in New York once and in the Mississippi Valley a few times; in 1868 [I] made the whole Western circuit; and in the two or three following seasons added the Eastern circuit to my route.\x{201d}39 Apparently, Emerson was underpaid since Twain remarks that some lecturers charged as much as \$250 when they spoke in towns and \$400 when they spoke in cities (which is almost as much, in today\x{2019}s terms, as the going price for a lecture by a retired television newscaster).",

            "The first of the seven famous debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas took place on August 21, 1858, in Ottowa, Illinois. Their arrangement provided that Douglas would speak first, for one hour; Lincoln would take an hour and a half to reply; Douglas, a half hour to rebut Lincoln\x{2019}s reply. This debate was considerably shorter than those to which the two men were accustomed. In fact, they had tangled several times before, and all of their encounters had been much lengthier and more exhausting. For example, on October 16, 1854, in Peoria, Illinois, Douglas delivered a three-hour address to which Lincoln, by agreement, was to respond. When Lincoln\x{2019}s turn came, he reminded the audience that it was already <<5 p.m.|5>>, that he would probably require as much time as Douglas and that Douglas was still scheduled for a rebuttal. He proposed, therefore, that the audience go home, have dinner, and return refreshed for four more hours of talk. 1 The audience amiably agreed, and matters proceeded as Lincoln had outlined.",

It should be noted, by the way, that Lincoln and Douglas were not presidential candidates; at the time of their encounter in Peoria they were not even candidates for the United States Senate. But their audiences were not especially concerned with their official status. These were people who regarded such events as essential to their political education, who took them to be an integral part of their social lives, and who  were quite accustomed to extended oratorical performances. Typically at county or state fairs, programs included many speakers, most of whom were allotted three hours for their arguments.
