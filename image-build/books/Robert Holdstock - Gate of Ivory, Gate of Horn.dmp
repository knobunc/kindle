I had stayed in the village, sleeping on a couch at the crowded local hotel, but woke at <<six|9b>>, made tea, then gratefully accepted a lift on a passing truck as far as Ryhope Manor. The main pathways on the estate had already been swept clear of snow, right down to the farm, and from there I followed the tracks of the tractors that had been out at dawn with hay for the animals.',

He certainly seemed confused, however, standing there with the river flowing and soaking him, and the ten small boats shifting restlessly in his wake.

The forest began to echo with the screaming of the wooden gods in their sanctuaries, and these two began to wrestle and scream until I was deafened. They staggered about the glade, tearing at the bark on their faces, clubbing at each other so that splinters and strips of wood flew like spears around me. At <<midnight|13>> they released each other and prowled the glade, pulling back the trees, prodding at the bushes, calling in their strange tongue. I cowered back as Cernunnos leaned towards me, gape-mouthed and slack-eyed, but the monstrous horned head moved away. It hadn\x{2019}t seen me.",
