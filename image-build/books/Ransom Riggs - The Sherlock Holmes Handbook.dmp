            "\x{2022} Measure the length of the foot and stride. In A Study in Scarlet, Holmes judges a suspect to be quite tall by measuring the unusual distance between the left and right footprints, that is, the stride. Height can be corroborated by measuring the length of the foot impression: Generally, the foot composes about fifteen percent of an individual\x{2019}s height. Dividing the length of the bare foot by <<0.15|3:1>> gives a rough estimate of its owner\x{2019}s stature. (For shoe impressions, which add a bit of length, divide by <<0.16|3:1>>.) What\x{2019}s more, the angle of the feet relative to each other can be significant: \x{201c}That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place,\x{201d} Holmes tells Inspector Lestrade while investigating a crime scene in \x{201c}The Boscombe Valley Mystery.\x{201d}",

            "n the forensic study of fingerprints, Sherlock Holmes was well before his time. He recognized their importance as early as his 1894 \x{201c}Norwood Builder\x{201d} case, in which he proves that Scotland Yard\x{2019}s investigators have been duped by a print falsely planted to incriminate an innocent person. (In reality, Scotland Yard didn\x{2019}t establish its Fingerprint Branch until <<1901|9c:0>>, even though the science of fingerprinting had existed for some twenty years.) Despite great leaps forward in forensic science during the ensuing century, there is still little evidence more damning than a fingerprint. This is due to the simple fact that no two fingerprints are alike, and the properties of one\x{2019}s digital skin furrows are unchanging. When prints are clear and visually contrasted from the surface upon which they sit, it is a relatively simple task to identify matching finger impressions or distinguish between dissimilar ones\x{2014}though a first-rate magnifying glass helps immensely.",

            "In reality, there never was a 221B Baker Street; when Doyle wrote the stories, Baker Street\x{2019}s numbers stopped at <<100|9c:0>>. German bombs destroyed much of the neighborhood during World War II, and though today the modern renumbered Baker Street goes well into the 200s, there is no 221B; a large art deco building was assigned the odd numbers from 219 to 229 in the 1930s. Still, that did not stop its tenants, the Abbey National Building Society, from receiving Holmes\x{2019}s mail\x{2014}so much so that they were forced to appoint an employee to act as Holmes\x{2019}s personal secretary. Nikki Caparn, who served in this role in the late 1980s, told the New York Times that most of the detective\x{2019}s correspondents \x{201c}just want to know what Mr. Holmes is doing now or where he is and they hope he is well,\x{201d} and she often responds in Holmes\x{2019}s own words, explaining that he has retired to the countryside and \x{201c}given himself up entirely to that soothing life of nature for which I had so often yearned during the long years amid the gloom of London.\x{201d}",

            "Team sports were loved by the Victorians, especially cricket, soccer, and rugby. Watson was a devoted rugby player\x{2014}Holmes\x{2019}s client in \x{201c}The Sussex Vampire\x{201d} knew Watson from their youthful days as amateur players\x{2014}and the sport figures prominently in \x{201c}The Missing Three-Quarter\x{201d} mystery. It hinges on a star rugby player, Godfrey Staunton (the titular \x{201c}three-quarter\x{201d}), who disappears just prior to an important match. The fact that Holmes has never heard of Staunton (nor, presumably, any other prominent rugby player) led one pair of astonished Sherlockian critics to propose that the great detective was actually a woman in disguise. Such ignorance on the part of any male who had attended public school in nineteenth-century England was unfathomable, they argue. Descended from soccer, rugby captured the popular imagination from the time players began to pick up the ball and run with it <<around 1830|18:0>>; and by 1872, when Cambridge officially institutionalized its rugby club as a sport distinct from soccer, it had become an inescapable part of the fabric of English society. Then again, perhaps Holmes, whose spirit rebelled against the gentlemanly values of selfless team play it was thought to instill in impressionable young men, simply blocked the whole business from his mind.",

            "\x{2022} The Mafia. By <<1900|9n:0>>, the Mafia controlled much of Sicily\x{2019}s economy but lacked a significant toehold in London. In the \x{201c}Red Circle\x{201d} adventure, Holmes runs across a young Italian couple who have betrayed the Mafia and are seeking refuge from a vicious hit man. \x{201c}The Three Napoleons\x{201d} also features a cadre of Mafia-connected villains, one of which Holmes calls \x{201c}the greatest cut-throat in London.\x{201d} He goes on to explain that the Mafia \x{201c}is a secret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder,\x{201d} a fact that would not have been as widely known to Conan Doyle\x{2019}s readers as it is to readers today. At that time, the Mafia was only just beginning to emerge as a force to be reckoned with in the Italian neighborhoods of American cities; previously Mafioso had been endemic only to Sicily. (Similar criminal organizations, including the Camorra in Naples, operated in other parts of Italy. In American parlance, however, Mafia has become a catch-all.)",
