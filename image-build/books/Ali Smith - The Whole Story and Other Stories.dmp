            "<<One|9k:0>>. It is early evening. I am lying on the couch watching  TV while you come home from London on the train.  There\x{2019}s a programme on about a woman who has sent her  mother off for the night to pick up the woman\x{2019}s husband,  her son-in-law, in Dorset, while some people from the BBC  come and secretly remake the mother\x{2019}s back garden. The  garden is huge and as they dig up the long green lawn and  start laying the slabs that are going to replace it, the TV  people keep shaking their heads at the camera about how  difficult it will be to do this week\x{2019}s episode in such a short  amount of time, especially with the weather being so bad. It  rains and rains. There are lots of shots of the TV people  and the woman whose mother\x{2019}s garden it is, sheltering  under a big old tree. They decide the tree is diseased. In the  next shower break they saw through the tree with chainsaws  and dig up its roots with a JCB. By the end of the  programme the TV people are excited, hiding behind a new  pagoda as the woman brings her mother through and shows  her the garden, which looks like a modern cemetery. She  looks round, bewildered. When the TV people jump out  and surprise her she bursts into tears. I can\x{2019}t believe it\x{2019}s  really you, she says. I can\x{2019}t believe it\x{2019}s really them. There\x{2019}s a  montage of shots of before, during and after. Champagne is  opened. The TV people affectionately jostle the woman, the husband and the mother. The mother is still shaking her  head, wiping her eyes and staring at the TV people.",
