jerking flame created, still speaking softly, still smoking, still
sipping coffee and gin; watching the top soften and the first little
drop of wax seep to the edge and stagger down the side of the candle,
the wick glowing brighter and redder in the middle of the flame . . .
then another drop rolled to the first; and another started a new
stream as the flame bent and the edge sloped away and soon many
little drops were rolling down and piling up and flowing down the
side of the candle and everyone relaxed even more, calmed by the new
flame and slightly enervated by the laughing, and they sat deeper in
their seats and the guys stretched their legs even more and the girls
became softer and more coy; and their eyes eventually strayed from
the flame and everything seemed softer and even Lee felt she was a
part of the group and turned in her seat and faced the others and
started telling little tidbits about backstage life and soon they all
joined in and when someone was not talking they were listening to two
or three stories being told at once. Lee told them about how almost
all actors are gay (and even most of the church officials\x{2014}and you
know who honey), and how the cast of one of the revues she was
starring in were pickedup and the club closed because they were all
blasting backstage\x{2014} and their hands fluttered about and the guys
flipped their ashes\x{2014}and I am telling you it was a scream. Caldonia

refilled her glass with gin, smiling at Goldie; nodded, smiled,
laughed, still trying to think of something funny, even slightly

            "Wilson looked at Harry and decided that it wouldnt do
to try the arm around the shoulder routine again. Now look Harry, I
understand and respect your position. I have known and have had the
pleasure of working with you for quite a few years now and I know,
just as Mike here knows, and everyone in the plant knows, that youre
a good and honest worker, and that you always have the interest of
the organization and the men at heart. Isnt that right Mike? Mike
nodded automatically. Like I say Harry, we all know you are a good
man and that no one else could have done the job you have in keeping
the union affairs of this plant functioning as they have been and we
all respect and admire you for this. And we all respect and admire
your intelligence and ability. And believe me when I say this,
because I say this not as an executive of the organization, but as a
man who works with the other men here, I say this as a fellow worker:
I would be the last person in the world to ask anyone to make even
the slightest breach in the union rules and regulations. To me a
contract is a sacred instrument and I will stand by it come hell or
high water . . . but, and I say this as a worker and an executive . .
. look, its like this: its just like in the union itself. You have
your constitution and bylaws. Right? I am certain you are familiar
with them. And I am also certain that you follow them to the letter,
but there are times when you might have to make a slight exception.
Now wait a minute\x{2014}Harry leaning forward and starting to speak-just
hear me out. Now look, suppose the rules say a meeting should start
at <<8|9g>> oclock, but suddenly theres a big snow storm and it takes the
men 30 minutes or an hour longer to get to the meeting. Now, you
either will have to wait and start the meeting late or you will have
to start it on time without the proper number of members present.
Wilson smiled, relaxed and took a drag of his cigarette, satisfied
with his cleverness, thinking that Harrys position was untenable.
Harry took a drag of his cigarette, blew the smoke in Wilsons
direction, dropped the butt on the floor and squashed it under his
shoe. What we do at the union meet-ins is none of your business
unless we want ta tellya about it. O, I know that Harry, I certainly
didnt mean to imply otherwise. All I am trying to say is that this
organization, like your union, is like any other organization in that
it is a team and everyone connected with the organization from the
President to the elevator operators are a member of that team and we
all have to pull together. Everyones job is equally important. The
Presidents job is no more important than yours in that if you dont
cooperate, just as he must cooperate, we can not get the job done.
That is what I am trying to say. We all have to get behind the wheel,
just like in the union. Now, we have a job that must be done and it
must be done now. This new man is the only man available to do it at
this time. That is the only reason he is doing it. We certainly had
no intention of being instrumental in asking anyone to do anything
that might even be considered a breach of union rules, but the job
has to be done\x{2014}look, this guys a new man and aint cuttin no
stainless so just stop the shit. If ya put him back on the job I/ll
call the whole goddamn plant out, Harrys face becoming redder, his
eyes glaring, ya get that? I/ll stand by that fuckin bench all day if
I have ta and if ya try to putim back on that job I swear ta krist
the whole fuckin plantll be out on the street in two fuckin seconds
and you and no ballbreakin fuck in the jointll stop me. Ya getit? If
ya want a strike I/ll giveya one. He walked out of the room, slamned
the door and walked back to the bench. He said nothing to the man who
was leaning impatiently against the bench, but simply stood at the
other end.",

refrigerator, stove and large coffee urn. There were many folding

rubber stamp and a stamp pad. He pulled the big drawer all the way
out. Looked. Yeah, there it was. He took them out. I guess I might as
well do it now. Bring your books over here. The men with the signs
went over and Harry stamped their books. Any sonofabitch that dont

had just come in asked what was going on. Ya gotta get ya book
stamped before ya go out. He came over to the desk with his book out.

years, 6 in October, October the 23rd, she still laid out a pair of
pajamas every night, though now she used the same pair each night,
washing them once a month, ironing them and putting them back on the
bed. ) Then she tidied up the apartment, sweeping the kitchen floor
and adjusting the furniture, before wiping the dishes and putting
them away with the other dairy dishes. The humming evolved into light
singing as she put on her sweater and coat and readied herself to go
downstairs. She looked around the apartment, making certain the stove
was off and all the lights out, before closing the door and going
out. Near the entrance to the building was a small area bordered with
benches and a few young trees. Here Ada sat whenever the weather
permitted. She sat on a bench on the near side as she knew it would
be in the sun longer than any of the others. This was her bench and
here she sat and watched the children, the people passing or sitting,
and enjoying the warmth of the sunshine. She closed her eyes and
faced the sun, lifting her face, and sat thus for many minutes
feeling the heat on her forehead, her eyelids, her cheeks, feeling
the suns rays penetrating her chest, warming her heart, making her
feel almost happy. She breathed deeply, sighing inaudibly, and
lowered her head and opened her eyes, then raised her feet slightly
and wiggled her toes in her shoes. Her poor feet had such a burden to
carry and they suffered so in the winter, but now even they were
alive and relieved. It would be many, many wonderfully warm and sunny
months before her feet would have to be tortured with thick heavy
socks and forced to feel the cold. Soon she could go one day to Coney
Island and sit on the Boardwalk and watch the swimmers or maybe she
could even walk in the surf, but she wasnt sure if she should. She
might slip, or someone might knock her over. Anyway, the beach was
nice even just sitting on a bench getting the sun. She watched a
small child ride by on his tricycle then watched a group of children
running after each other and yelling. Occasionally she would be able
to distinguish the words they were yelling and she blushed and
immediately pushed it from her mind (this too would be remembered
next winter) then turned abruptly as she heard a baby crying, seeing
the overturned carriage, hearing the voice from a window, seeing a
blur as 2 children ran away; trying to locate the baby, getting up
from the bench when she finally saw it lying on the ground, but
sitting down when she saw a woman coming out of the building. Those
children really should be more careful. She watched the mother pick
up the child and drop him in the carriage and shove a bottle in his
mouth and go upstairs. I hope it wasnt hurt. The baby eventually
stopped crying and Ada turned away and once more watched the child
circling the benches on its tricycle. She saw a woman passing with
her children and shopping cart. The woman smiled, nodded and said
Hello. Ada returned her greeting but didnt smile. She was a nice lady
but her husband was a no good. He always looked at Ada funny like he
was going to hurt her. Not like her Hymie. Her Hymie was always
friendly. Such a good man. They would have been married 43 years this
summer, July 29th, if he was still alive. Hymie used to help her all
the time. And he too loved the beach. But so seldom they could go.
Only on Mondays when they closed the store and then sometimes it
wouldnt be so nice. But many times they would go and she would make
sandwiches and a thermos of a cold drink and Hymie always got for her
a beach chair and umbrella. He always insisted. I want you should be
comfortable and enjoy yourself. Thats what he said. She would always
say no, dont bother. Who needs it? and they would laugh. But always
Hymie insisted she should have the umbrella in case she might want to
sit in the shade, but she never did and they would sit on the beach
chairs getting the sun and once, maybe twice, during the day they
would go down to the surf and splash around. He was so good her
Hymie. And sometimes when her Ira got older he would tell them to go
to the beach, he would mind the store and they would go an extra day
to the beach. Her Ira was the best boy any Mother could have.
(Everynight before going to bed she kissed their pictures.) Still
only a boy already when they killed him. Just a boy. Not even
married. Not even married when the Army took him. And he was such a
good boy. When he was still just a little one he would come home from
school and tell her to take a nap, hed help papa in the store and
Hymie would smile so big and rub little Iras head and say yes, take a
nap, Iras a big boy now and he will help me and Ira would smile up at
his father and Ada would go back to the small rooms behind the candy
store and lie down. And sometimes, when maybe it wasnt too busy,
Hymie would fix the supper while Ira watched the store and then Ira
would come back and wake her up and say suppers ready Mommy. See? And
everything would be on the table and they would eat and she would go
out and take care of the store while Hymie ate. And Hymie worked so
hard. Opening the store at <<6 in the morning|5>> and going out and getting
the papers off the street, and sometimes it would be cold and
raining, and he would carry in the big bundles of papers all by
himself ( he would never let her help him with that) and cut the
cords and arrange them on the stand and she would lie in bed,
pretending to be asleep, and all the years they were married Hymie
got out of bed so quietly so she should sleeplonger and every morning
she would wake up but she never let him know she was awake so he
wouldnt worry about her. Then he would come back at <<8 oclock|6>> and she
would pretend to wake up when he touched her, and she would get up
and fix the breakfast. For 20 years they had that store and they were
so happy\x{2014}the child ran his tricycle into a tree and toppled off,
but got right up and started riding again\x{2014}maybe they didnt always
have so much, but they were happy and she could still smell the soda
fountain; the sweet smell of ice cream, syrups, mixed fruits, hot
fudge, marshmallow, whipped cream and the fudgicles, popsicles and
ices and the candy and chewing gum on the counter and the candy
shelves on the opposite side of the store, the sliding glass doors
smeared by the smudgy hands of thousands of children. She used to
lean on the counter and watch them look at the candies pointing with
their fingers pressed against the glass. Many times each day this
would happen and Ada would wonder why they had to lean against the
glass with their hands and why it took them so long to make up their
minds what candy they wanted. And then when Ira came, late in her
life, it didnt annoy her as much. They were young like her Ira. But
when they get older they werent so nice and said bad things to you.
But Ira was always such a good boy. And they had to kill him. And
they didnt even see his body. Just a telegram and many years later a
sealed coffin. My poor Ira. So young. Not even a father and now dead.
Dead already 15 years\x{2014}a few other children joined the one with the
tricycle and they took turns riding it, laughing and running around
in circles. Ada smiled as she watched them. Dead 15 years and not
even children to remember you. I dont know why they did this to me.
Even dead before Hymie, his father. And even Hymie left me. Such a
good man. Worked so hard his back bent\x{2014}someone passed and Ada
smiled, but they just walked past not noticing Ada and Ada almost
yelled at them, but stopped as she noticed that now women were coming
down and people were going to the store and children were running and
laughing and the sun was getting brighter and warmer and a few men
straddled a bench with a checker board between them and maybe someone
would sit down next to her and they would talk.",

            'The Welfare checks were cashed and there were long
lines outside the Liquor Store across the street from the Project.
The owner had his 2 sons and a brother helping him as he did every
Saturday night. The store was in the middle of the street and the two
lines went out of sight around each corner, and the cop on the beat
stood near the entrance so a fight wouldnt start as people pushed
their way into the store. Yet even with the cop there there was much
pushing and cursing. The clerks in the store worked as fast as they
could and wrapped the bottles quickly, but still the lines were out
of sight around both corners. Those at the end of the line would step
out occasionally and look to the front wondering how much longer they
would have to wait and then finally they would turn the corner and
eventually they would come in sight of the lighted window and then
they could at least look at all the bottles on display and then the
time seemed to pass faster with their goal in sight. Someone tried to
get in ahead of time, but someone else pulled him out of the doorway
and an argument started and everyone yelled for them to clear the
front of the store so they could get in and the owner came out and
frantically yelled at them to stop (the people in the store becoming
nervous when the owner left the counter fearing something would
happen to prevent them from getting their bottles after having waited
on line for so many hours) and finally the cop came over and yanked
them both out and told them to beat it. They pleaded to be allowed to
get their bottles or at least to get on the end of the line (
offering the cop money ), but the cop refused (not wanting to louse
up the beautiful deal he had with the owner) and they finally walked
off, sneaking back and giving money to friends to get them a bottle.
Before the last customer was taken care of the clerks were soaked
with perspiration and completely knocked out, but soon the last few
customers were in the store. Many parties had already started and as
the last customers bought their bottles and walked happily toward
home the bells in a nearby church tolled <<midnight|13>>.',
