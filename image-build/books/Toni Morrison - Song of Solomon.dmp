At that time of day, during the middle of the week, word-of-mouth news just lumbered along. Children were in school; men were at work; and most of the women were fastening their corsets and getting ready to go see what tails or entrails the butcher might be giving away. Only the unemployed, the self-employed, and the very young were available\x{2014}deliberately available because they\x{2019}d heard about it, or accidentally available because they happened to be walking at that exact moment in the shore end of Not Doctor Street, a name the post office did not recognize. Town maps registered the street as Mains Avenue, but the only colored doctor in the city had lived and died on that street, and when he moved there in 1896 his patients took to calling the street, which none of them lived in or near, Doctor Street. Later, when other Negroes moved there, and when the postal service became a popular means of transferring messages among them, envelopes from Louisiana, Virginia, Alabama, and Georgia began to arrive addressed to people at house numbers on Doctor Street. The post office workers returned these envelopes or passed them on to the Dead Letter Office. Then in 1918, when colored men were being drafted, a few gave their address at the recruitment office as Doctor Street. In that way, the name acquired a quasi-official status. But not for long. Some of the city legislators, whose concern for appropriate names and the maintenance of the city\x{2019}s landmarks was the principal part of their political life, saw to it that \x{201c}Doctor Street\x{201d} was never used in any official capacity. And since they knew that only Southside residents kept it up, they had notices posted in the stores, barbershops, and restaurants in that part of the city saying that the avenue running northerly and southerly from Shore Road fronting the lake to the junction of routes 6 and 2 leading to Pennsylvania, and also running parallel to and between Rutherford Avenue and Broadway, had always been and would always be known as Mains Avenue and not Doctor Street.",

The reason for the hospital\x{2019}s generosity to that particular woman was not the fact that she was the only child of this Negro doctor, for during his entire professional life he had never been granted hospital privileges and only two of his patients were ever admitted to Mercy, both white. Besides, the doctor had been dead a long time by 1931. It must have been Mr. Smith\x{2019}s leap from the roof over their heads that made them admit her.

            'Corinthians was naive, but she was not a complete fool. She never let her mistress know she had ever been to college or Europe or could recognize one word of French that Miss Graham had not taught her (entrez, for example). Actually, the work Corinthians did was good for her. In that house she had what she never had in her own: responsibility. She flourished in a way, and exchanged arrogance occasionally for confidence. The humiliation of wearing a uniform, even if it was blue, and deceiving people was tempered by the genuine lift which came of having her own money rather than receiving an allowance like a child. And she was surprised to discover that the amount of neatly folded bills Michael-Mary handed her each Saturday at <<noon|13>> was within two dollars of the amount real secretaries took home each week.',

            "Other than scrubbing the kitchen tile and keeping a hard shine on the wooden floors, the work was not hard. The poetess lived alone and shaped her time and activities carefully in order to meet the heavy demands of artistic responsibility. Being a poet she could, of course, do little else. Marriage, children\x{2014}all had been sacrificed to the Great Agony and her home was a tribute to the fastidiousness of her dedication (and the generosity of her father\x{2019}s will). Colors, furnishings, and appointments had been selected for their inspirational value. And she was fond of saying, in deprecating some item, \x{201c}I couldn\x{2019}t write a line with that in the house.\x{201d} That might be a vase, the new toilet bowl the plumbers hauled in, a plant, or even the Christmas wreath St. John\x{2019}s third-grade class presented to her in gratitude for the moving reading she\x{2019}d given at their holiday assembly. Every morning between <<ten|20>> and <<noon|13>> she wrote, and every afternoon between <<three|20>> and <<four-fifteen|5k:1>>. Evenings were often given over to discussions and meetings with local poets, painters, musicians, and writers of fiction, at which they praised or condemned other artists, scorned the marketplace and courted it. Of this group Michael-Mary Graham was the queen, for her poetry had been published\x{2014}first in 1938, in a volume called Seasons of My Soul; there was a second collection in 1941, called Farther Shores. What was more, her poems had appeared in at least twenty small literary magazines, two \x{201c}slicks,\x{201d} six college journals, and the Sunday supplements of countless newspapers. She was also the winner, between 1938 and 1958, of nine Poet of the Year awards, culminating finally in the much-coveted State Poet Laureateship. At the ceremony, her most famous poem, \x{201c}Watchword,\x{201d} was performed by the Choral Speech Society of St. John\x{2019}s High School. None of that, however, had mitigated the reluctance of her publishers to bring out her complete collected works (tentatively called The Farthest Shore). But there was no question in her mind that they would come around.",

He sat on there in the kitchen, wishing for more coffee, but too tired to get up and fix it. In a minute his mother would be downstairs; she had got up when he and Macon had come in, but Macon sent her back upstairs. Milkman fished for another cigarette and watched dawn eclipse the electric light over the sink. It was a cheery sun, which suggested another hot day. But the stronger it got, the more desolate he became. Alone, without Macon, he let the events of the night come back to him\x{2014}he remembered little things, details, and yet he wasn\x{2019}t sure these details had really happened. Perhaps he made them up. Pilate had been shorter. As she stood there in the receiving room of the jail, she didn\x{2019}t even come up to the sergeant\x{2019}s shoulder\x{2014}and the sergeant\x{2019}s head barely reached Milkman\x{2019}s own chin. But Pilate was as tall as he was. When she whined to the policeman, verifying Milkman\x{2019}s and Guitar\x{2019}s lie that they had ripped off the sack as a joke on an old lady, she had to look up at him. And her hands were shaking as she described how she didn\x{2019}t know the sack was gone until the officer woke her up; that she couldn\x{2019}t imagine why anybody would want to run off with her husband\x{2019}s bones; that her husband had been lynched in Mississippi fifteen years ago, and that they wouldn\x{2019}t let her cut him down, and that she left town then and that when she went back the body had dropped off the rope of its own accord, so she collected it and tried to bury it, but the \x{201c}funeral peoples\x{201d} wanted fifty dollars for a coffin, and the carpenter wanted <<twelve-fifty|5k:1>> for a pine box and she just didn\x{2019}t have no twelve dollars and fifty cents so she just carried what was left of Mr. Solomon (she always called him Mr. Solomon cause he was such a dignified colored man) and put it in a sack and kept it with her. \x{201c}Bible say what so e\x{2019}er the Lord hath brought together, let no man put asunder\x{2014}Matthew Twenty-one: <<Two|9k:0>>.

            "Milkman woke at <<noon|9b>>. Somebody had come into his room and placed a small fan on the floor near the foot of his bed. He listened to the whirring for a long time before he got up and went into the bathroom to fill the tub. He lay there in lukewarm water, still sweating, too hot and tired to soap himself. Every now and then he flicked water on his face, letting it wet his two-day-old beard. He wondered if he could shave without slicing his chin open. The tub was uncomfortable, too short for him to stretch out, though he remembered when he could almost swim in it. Now he looked down at his legs. The left one looked just as long as the other. His eyes traveled up his body. The touch of the policeman\x{2019}s hand was still there\x{2014}a touch that made his flesh jump like the tremor of a horse\x{2019}s flank when flies light on it. And something more. Something like shame stuck to his skin. Shame at being spread-eagled, fingered, and handcuffed. Shame at having stolen a skeleton, like a kid on a Halloween trick-or-treat prank rather than a grown man making a hit. Shame at needing both his father and his aunt to get him off. Then more shame at seeing his father\x{2014}with an accommodating \x{201c}we all understand how it is\x{201d} smile\x{2014}buckle before the policemen. But nothing was like the shame he felt as he watched and listened to Pilate. Not just her Aunt Jemima act, but the fact that she was both adept at it and willing to do it\x{2014}for him. For the one who had just left her house carrying what he believed was her inheritance. It didn\x{2019}t matter that he also believed she had \x{201c}stolen\x{201d} it\x{2026}. From whom? From a dead man? From his father, who was also stealing it? Then and now? He had stolen it too, and what\x{2019}s more, he had been prepared\x{2014}at least he told himself he had been prepared\x{2014}to knock her down if she had come into the room while he was in the act of stealing it. To knock down an old black lady who had cooked him his first perfect egg, who had shown him the sky, the blue of it, which was like her mother\x{2019}s ribbons, so that from then on when he looked at it, it had no distance, no remoteness, but was intimate, familiar, like a room that he lived in, a place where he belonged. She had told him stories, sung him songs, fed him bananas and corn bread and, on the first cold day of the year, hot nut soup. And if his mother was right, this old black lady\x{2014}in her late sixties, but with the skin and agility of a teen-aged girl\x{2014}had brought him into the world when only a miracle could have. It was this woman, whom he would have knocked senseless, who shuffled into the police station and did a little number for the cops\x{2014}opening herself up wide for their amusement, their pity, their scorn, their mockery, their disbelief, their meanness, their whimsy, their annoyance, their power, their anger, their boredom\x{2014}whatever would be useful to her and to himself.",

Five hundred dollars, his driver\x{2019}s license, phone numbers on slips of paper, social security card, airline ticket stub, cleaners receipts. He looked up and down the road.
