Not that it\x{2019}s against the rules to have Saff over. In fact, I\x{2019}m pretty sure Mom would be delighted, which is precisely why I don\x{2019}t want her to find Saff here. It\x{2019}s too hard to have Mom hoping things about me. She got home before me yesterday, when I was at the park with Saff.

Carter lifted her gently, then, on impulse, extended his arms, holding her above his head. Her eyes gleamed, dark and depthless, whole galaxies stretching out behind them. She pounded her fists in the air as she always did when she was airborne. Carter lowered her, pressing her fat belly to his face, then he lowered both of them until he was curled over her in the middle of his bedroom carpet.',

One blogger thought it was an indictment of capitalism. Another a rejection of the physical body. The only review Elliot had liked was the one where most of the screen was given over to a hand-drawn illustration of a vicuna. So it seemed Midas would not be lucrative after all. Irony. It was <<midday|13>> on a Tuesday. The gallery was near empty. Nita gave him a sharp look and did not rise from her seat at the desk to greet him.",

After her call to Rhett, she\x{2019}d stayed in her guest suite for a couple of hours, unsure if she was welcome to move around the house. When dinnertime came, she\x{2019}d wandered downstairs and found the first floor empty, though all the lights had been left on. On the kitchen counter she\x{2019}d discovered a covered tray marked with her name, underneath its lid a salad of strange leaves, cheeses, and fruits, as delicious as anything she\x{2019}d ever eaten. Also, bread and wine. When she\x{2019}d finished, Pearl had washed her dinner plate in the sink and taken the remainder of the bottle up to her room, where she\x{2019}d continued her Calla Pax marathon. During the opening credits of Death Drop, Pearl\x{2019}s screen had lit with a request from Marilee for a meeting the next morning at <<eleven|9c:1>>, and then, during Skin Scythe\x{2019}s infamous peeling scene, a second alert from Calla saying that they needed to move the meeting up to ten. When Pearl had come downstairs this morning at <<half past nine|10>>, she\x{2019}d found Calla already waiting in the front sitting room, a coffee service and basket of muffins set out on the table before her.",

Pearl woke early and took her breakfast tray (delivered by a posh catering service, she discovered on day two) to the garden out back and ate on the bench near the koi pond, attended by lacy trees, no neighbors in view. Marilee had told Pearl that she had the run of the first floor, but when on the second floor to keep to her guest suite. And stay away from the east wing!
