            "\x{2018}Yes, I had a hand in this from the outset,\x{2019} Waterlow confirmed, and his voice took on the compelling tone of the anecdotist with a good tale to tell. \x{2018}It was a Monday afternoon in March, <<towards five o\x{2019}clock|6>>, a fine day, as I remember, still light. I was clipping my front hedge. I have my own house in Maze Road, if you follow, and I generally take Monday afternoon to catch up on my gardening. The station is not continuously manned, thank Heaven. There I was, then, tidying up the privet, when a girl in servant\x{2019}s dress came running up the road and told me I was wanted urgently at Park Lodge. Fortunately Dr Eagle knows my habits and sent the girl direct to my house with the news that the man Perceval was dead. It\x{2019}s a matter of two or three minutes from Maze Road to Kew Green, so I was there directly. When I arrived, Eagle was attending to Mrs Cromer in her room. It seems she had passed out from the shock. I went straight to the processing room where the body was. All in all, Cribb, my career has not brought me face to face with death too often, but I saw at once that Perceval had not gone peacefully. The poor fellow had kicked off a shoe and torn his clothes in his agony, besides rucking up the carpet and knocking over a chair. I found a wine glass lying on its side on the floor, so the possibility of poison suggested itself to me even before Dr Eagle came in and gave his diagnosis. He\x{2019}s an old stager, you know, sharp as a winkle-pin. \x{201c}Hold on to that glass,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll stake my reputation there\x{2019}s cyanide in it.\x{201d} He took me to the poison cabinet and showed me the bottle of the stuff, more than half empty.\x{2019}",
