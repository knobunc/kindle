            'Night came. The festivities continued under the light of torches. The humans fought their desire to vent their frustration and boredom. At last, long <<past midnight|13>>, Krazb, slurring his words, announced that it was time for all to go to bed. The drums and the horns ceased their "music," and the merrymakers who had not passed out staggered off to their huts. A minor official, Wigshab, led the humans to a hut, told them that they were to spend the night there on a pile of blankets, and wobbled off.',

Presently, Eleth left the campsite, seemingly for the same reason he had left it. Instead of selecting a tree behind which to squat, she went deeper into the forest. He followed her at a distance. When he saw her stop in a small clearing, he hid behind a bush.',

Suddenly, a heavy rain fell upon them. Whips of lightning exploded near them. A few minutes later, water spilled over the edges of the pit. The water rose to Kickaha\'s ankles.',

It showed <<three|11b:0>> tunnel openings in the walls. Kickaha undid the string on the bag and removed most of its contents. Though he was wet, he donned the snug jockey shorts and long-sleeved shirt. After drying his feet with the short kilt, he put that on and then the socks and the shoes. These were much like tennis shoes. It did not take him long to fasten the belt around his waist, sheath the beamer and knife, and attach the bag to the belt.',

Though he was theoretically immune to any disease, he did not want to chance the local food or the water. After a long time, <<midnight|13>> came. By then, the sky was overcast. But he wore the headband and its attached night-vision device. He worked uphill through the trees some distance from the road until he came to the wall.

But deep within him, the multitudinous perils, one after the other, had demanded high payment. The latest and worst of the shocks.

Pick four trusted women servants to gate food and water and other necessary supplies to her and Red Orc while we\'re gone. Send all but fifty guards off on a paid vacation. Those left-and they must be the most trusted men you know-will continue the twenty-four-hour patrol. After that\'s done, close up the palace, bar all gates, lock all lowerstory windows.
