            "The premonition was ominously similar to Spofford\x{2019}s warning to Congress more than twenty years earlier, when he worried that the old Library in the Capitol was rapidly running out of space for its collection. Could the sheer number of catalog cards lead to a similar dilemma? The new Library was built with the bigger collection of books in mind, but the on-site card catalog and the distribution program were now growing by leaps and bounds too. In the early 1900s, the Library added numerous steel storage cases for the cards that were sold to other libraries. Stacked three stories high, this addition forced the cataloging staff to carry the boxes of new cards up to the narrow catwalks amid intolerable temperatures, as the staggering inventory of index cards towered above them. By <<1916|9:0>>, the Library could no longer mince words, admitting in its annual report that \x{201c}the expansion of the card catalogue is a subject of concern requiring immediate attention.\x{201d}",

            "Henriette Avram\x{2019}s work in developing MARC (Machine-Readable Cataloging) during the 1960s enabled discrete bits of structured data to be encoded and transmitted across long distances, an important advancement in the birth of the Internet. But the Internet also owes its existence, in part, to those who came even earlier and envisioned and implemented standardized index card catalogs. Paul Otlet was one of those visionaries. Born in Belgium in 1868, Otlet, a lawyer, was fascinated by bibliographic techniques and the potential for organizing information using standard index cards. Although he operated on the periphery of the library community and was drawn to various classification schemes, he developed an idea of bringing together the entire world\x{2019}s knowledge into a searchable system. Around the turn of the twentieth century, Otlet, along with international lawyer and future Nobel Peace Prize\x{2013}winner Henri La Fontaine, began to build an archive of facts on millions of 3-by-5-in (7.5-by-12-cm) index cards. They called this collection the Mundaneum\x{2014}a virtual analog Internet that users could search. This staggering collection of classified world knowledge was housed in Brussels until <<1940|9c:0>>, when Nazi Germany invaded Belgium and destroyed part of the Mundaneum.",
