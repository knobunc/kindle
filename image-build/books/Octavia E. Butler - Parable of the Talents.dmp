This is untrue. The Pox has been a much longer torment. It began well before <<2015|9c:0>>, perhaps even before the turn of the millennium. It has not ended.",

            "It\x{2019}s <<three in the morning|5>> now, but last night, just after dark, some group, some gang, perhaps, attacked the Dovetree place just north of us. There were, yesterday at this time, 22 people living at Dovetree\x{2014}the old man, his wife, and his two youngest daughters; his five married sons, their wives and their kids. All of these people are gone except for the two youngest wives and the three little children they were able to grab as they ran. Two of the kids are hurt, and one of the women has had a heart attack, of all things. Bankole has treated her before. He says she was born with a heart defect that should have been taken care of when she was a baby. But she\x{2019}s only twenty, and around the time she was born, her family, like most people, had little or no money. They worked hard themselves and put the strongest of their kids to work at ages eight or ten. Their daughter\x{2019}s heart problem was always either going to kill her or let her live. It wasn\x{2019}t going to be fixed.",

            "\x{201c}What are head and footstones?\x{201d} he asked me. He meant it. He\x{2019}s 18 and an escapee from the Los Angeles area like I am, but his experience has been very different. While I was being cared for and educated by educated parents, he was on his own. He speaks Spanish and a little remembered Korean, but no English. He was seven when his mother died of flu and twelve when an earthquake killed his father. It collapsed the old brick building in which the family had been squatting. So at <<12|9c:0>>, Jorge alone was responsible for his younger sister and brother. He took care of them, somehow, and taught himself to read and write Spanish with occasional help from an old wino acquaintance. He worked at hard, dangerous, often illegal jobs; he salvaged; and when necessary, he stole. He and his sister and brother, three Korean kids in a poor neighborhood of Mexican and Central American refugees, managed to survive, but they had no time to learn nonessentials. Now we\x{2019}re teaching them to read, write, and speak English because that will enable them to communicate with more people. And we\x{2019}re teaching them history, farming, carpentry, and incidental things\x{2014}like what head and footstones are.",

The roads were mud and water, and it was unlikely that anyone would try to drive up today, but we needed to get a good start. In particular, I wanted to go to our secret caches where we had not only the necessities but copies of records, journals, and in two places, the hand and foot prints of some of our children. Bankole took hand and foot prints of every child he delivered. He labeled them, gave a copy to the parents, and kept a copy. I had distributed these copies among two of our caches\x{2014}the two that only a few of us knew about. I don\x{2019}t know whether the prints will help us get our children back. When I let myself think about it, I have to admit that I don\x{2019}t know even whether our children are alive. I only know that now I have to get to those two caches. They are back in the mountains toward the sea, not toward the road. We can disappear in that country. There are places there where we can shelter and decide what to do. It\x{2019}s one thing to say that we must find our children, and another to figure out how to do that, how to begin. Who to trust?",

She made me watch while she dug a hole in our backyard, put the doll in, covered it with cooking oil and old papers, and burned it. This, she said, was what would happen to me if I went on defying God and working for Satan. I would go down to hell, and what she had done to the doll, the devil would do to me. I remember she made me look at the shapeless blackened plastic lump that the doll had become. She made me hold it, and I cried because it was still hot, and it burned my hand.",

She\x{2019}s a woman who should have been rich and secure with her family down in Mendocino County, but, according to her, her family didn\x{2019}t want her. They wanted her brother, but they\x{2019}d never wanted her. She was born from the body of a hired surrogate back when that was still unusual, and although she looks much like her mother and nothing like the surrogate, her parents never quite accepted her\x{2014}especially after her brother was born the old-fashioned way from the body of his own mother. At <<18|9e>>, she was kidnapped for ransom, but no ransom was ever paid. She knew her parents had the money, but they never paid. Her brother was the prince, but somehow, she was never the princess. Her captors had kept her for a while for sex. Then, she got the idea to make herself seem sick. She would put her finger down her throat whenever they weren\x{2019}t looking. Then she\x{2019}d throw up all over everything. At last, in disgust and fear, her captors abandoned her down near Clear Lake. When she tried to go home, she discovered that just before the Al-Can War began, her family left the area, moved to Alaska. Now, more than a year after her kidnapping, she was on her way to Alaska to find them. The fact that the war was not yet officially over didn\x{2019}t faze her. She had nothing and no one except her family, and she was going north. Allie had told her to go with me, at least as far as Portland. \x{201c}Watch one another\x{2019}s backs,\x{201d} she said when she brought us together. \x{201c}Maybe you\x{2019}ll both manage to live for a while longer.\x{201d}",
