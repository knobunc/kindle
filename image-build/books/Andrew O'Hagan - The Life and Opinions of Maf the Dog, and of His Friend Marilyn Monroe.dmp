            "Apart from his genius in the arts of imprisonment, the jailer made a strong impression with his love of stars and planets, which he talked about incessantly while feeding the dogs. He often knocked off at <<2.30|9c:1>> and made his way to the Griffith Observatory, where he liked to fall asleep in the planetarium beneath the whirling cosmos. He was a twenty-six-year-old part-time employee with a good sense of what was visible and not visible to the naked eye. He was especially fascinated by the cool, distant, impervious stars and I\x{2019}d say he was my first American friend. He worried about proximity, judging everything by how near or how far it was from him. Animals and outer space are excellent hobbies for such a person, for each is useful and comforting to humans with more than a passing interest in loneliness. Much of his conversation was about space animals, the poor beasts regularly sent into the sky as part of the respective space programmes of the United States and the Soviet Union. He enjoyed spending his afternoons thinking about those legions of chimps, monkeys, and macaques floating about the solar system, fulfilling man\x{2019}s need to discover. The jailer\x{2019}s natural patriotism led him to stress the American side of things: it was all happening in those years, so we heard a lot about Able and Miss Baker, the two monkeys who were the first creatures to travel into space and return, but there were many others \x{2013} Sams, Hams, Enoses, Goliaths \x{2013} shooting into the sky on Little Joe 2 as part of the Mercury programme, dozens of profoundly reluctant beasts gaining altitude, going sub-orbital, lost in space.",

            "Up on the landing, Nick Gurdin was already shouting at his wife. I would soon discover that Nick spent most of his time upstairs, where he kept the bottles, and where the television was never off. I\x{2019}m afraid Nick was a buffoon of long standing. He was always pasty-faced, the sort of man who sweated gently, like a girl crying. Everything in his life was to do with respect or rather its absence: he inspired none and he got none, he didn\x{2019}t know why, and the situation drove him backwards into his deepest hollows, where he drank by himself in San Fernando bars and thought of new ways to deploy his growing hatred. If he\x{2019}d lived in New York and worked in an office, he might have thrived as the typical, over-martini\x{2019}d, cheating husband, leaving every night on the <<7.14|3c>> to White Plains, a smudge of lipstick high on his neck and a tide of lies to see him through to the next day. But Nick was with Muddah and Muddah was in Hollywood. And in Hollywood Nicky Boy was forced to take early retirement. Upstairs, I could hear him berating his wife for leaving him without sufficient funds to see him through the day. She mentioned something about work at the studio. Carpentry work. A candle flickered in the alcove as he shouted again. I pulled myself up with my paws in an effort to inspect the gaudy seats of the chairs in the hall.",

            "Vince was the doorman of the building at <<444|9c:0>>. A pigeon was pecking a low brass grille beside the door as we walked up. \x{2018}Hey buddy,\x{2019} said the pigeon. \x{2018}Listen up. This guy\x{2019}s the nuts. Are you gonna be hanging around here? This guy\x{2019}s the business.\x{2019} Vince came out of the lobby smiling like a benighted failure. Vince had qualities few of us have: I admired the guy. The great comedy about most people is they think this life is the only one they\x{2019}re going to live: they stock it up with panic, pain, worth, and glory; they fly a metal bird from Los Angeles to New York, but they haven\x{2019}t yet grasped the basic facts. God is not in his place of work and is not answering his phone \x{2013} get it? You don\x{2019}t get saved, brothers and sisters, you get reassigned. The only person I ever met who acted like they knew this was Vince, who must have lived some other life as a pig in shit. None of us really remembers where we\x{2019}ve been. We don\x{2019}t know. He laughed easily at events and slapped his big fat thigh, eating donuts and laughing like every day was a holiday, which it is \x{2013} it\x{2019}s a holiday from being somebody else. Vince was the first man I met who didn\x{2019}t think he owned himself.",

            "So I was Mafia Honey \x{2013} Maf for short. The days just drifted into one another on the East Side. For the first time since leaving England, I felt I might be on solid ground, in safe company every day with the same maid and the same housekeeper. It seems I was destined always to enjoy the briefest of stays wherever I landed, but in many ways I will always consider the apartment at <<444|3:0>> to have been my home. Marilyn was a strange and unhappy creature, but at the same time she had more natural comedy to her than anybody I would ever know. More comedy and more art. Not for her the stern refusal of life\x{2019}s absurdities: Marilyn had a sensitivity to jokes and moral drama that would have delighted the chiefs of psychoanalytic Vienna. It didn\x{2019}t take long for her to become my best friend.",

            "She wanted out at the corner of 44th and Broadway. The pharmacy was open all hours and we skipped into its methylated environs, the car going on a block to wait for us. We were way off course, but that was always part of the excitement. In the pharmacy, Marilyn caused looks you wouldn\x{2019}t believe: she thought it would help to wear sunglasses but they only picked her out and made a show of her. I walked past the toothpaste and the mouthwash, sniffing out the perfumes. But after a minute I took my chance and ran out the door again. There was lots going on, especially at the theatres. The St James: Becket starring Laurence Olivier and Anthony Quinn. The Hudson: Toys in the Attic, a new play by Lillian Hellman, with Maureen Stapleton, Robert Loggia, and the long-serving Irene Worth. The Majestic: Camelot with Richard Burton and Julie Andrews, \x{2018}the hit musical of the season\x{2019}, an explosion down there of bright lamps and what I imagined were deep Arthurian greens. It must have been <<after 11 p.m.|5>> because the theatres were closed and the people who passed were sealed in their overcoats and a little high on cocktails.",

            "A week later, she travelled to Mexico to divorce Arthur. At first Victor the doorman was going to look after me, then his wife got a temperature and he was forced to spend the week boiling kettles in Queens. Then May Reis, Marilyn\x{2019}s secretary, said she would stay at <<444|9c:0>>, but Marilyn needed her on the trip, she needed May\x{2019}s professional loyalty as well as her loyally disapproving face, so in the end the three of us headed south on an extremely bumpy plane. As we boarded, the navigator chucked my chin: I had begun to think of myself as one of those fluffy companions, those charming vertebrates that are known to chaperone elegant individuals across the glo Like Leoncico, for instance, the yellow hound that belonged to Vasco N\x{fa}\x{f1}ez de Balboa and sniffed along at his side as he discovered the Isthmus of Panama. Leoncico\x{2019}s voice had a similar background to mine, though history fails to record whether there was anything Scottish in his pedigree. There was more tolerance in his moral character than there was in his master\x{2019}s. The dog protected him against everything except his own viciousness. (Typical problem, I have to say.) He even climbed into a barrel with Balboa to escape his owner\x{2019}s enemies. Maud Gonne\x{2019}s chaperone was actually called Chaperone, nicely enough, a grey marmoset filled with Celtic lore and Hellenic rhymes, poems, for the most part, to the impotence of human passion.* Alas, the little primate was not set to cavort with his owner through the years of her national widowhood. Gonne took him on a spying trip to St Petersburg where the cold put a quick end to his life. Thinking of marmosets as companions, there was also poor Mitz, \x{2018}that horrid little monkey\x{2019} as Vanessa Bell used to call the animal, who accompanied Virginia and Leonard Woolf through Germany in 1935. According to Vanessa, the rise of the Nazis was nothing compared to the increasing power of Mitz, who made the Woolfs quite ill with parental angst. Vanessa was always happy to report how jealous her sister had been of the little beast\x{2019}s powers of concentration. \x{2018}He always behaved as if the world were a question,\x{2019} said Virginia.",

There was also a sense that the humid day might give way at any moment to annihilation, not Gaulish arrows but Russian missiles, raining down on the scene of enjoyment from a perfect blue sky. The palm trees shivered in the <<midday|13>> sun.

            "We arrived at the party <<around 11 p.m.|5>>, too late for supper but in very good time for scraps. It was a stand-up thing anyhow, which dogs understand, and Marilyn\x{2019}s arrival caused no fuss. Kim Novak smiled from the corner and said \x{2018}hi\x{2019} with a pretty cascade of fingers. Lawford had that preposterous, theatrical, very English way of greeting old friends, where he pretended he had been waiting the whole night just for you. It was a trick he had learned from his father, Sir Sydney Lawford: how to exude passionate interest without a scintilla of real personal involvement. They say Peter\x{2019}s mother dressed her boy as a girl for the first ten years of his life, which explained a number of things about Peter quite neatly and sympathetically. He spent his life devising scenes of great moment that he could preside over whilst enjoying a secret absence. He beamed and took Marilyn by the hand. Someone gave her a glass of champagne and I stared up at Lawford with admiration. I loved him in Son of Lassie, the RAF pilot helped to safety across the snows of Norway by a dog whose eyes blazed with the strange existentialist thinking of Martin Heidegger. The dog was living for the moment, unsure whose side to be on, but Lawford made himself a likeable project and convinced the dog to gain its freedom by throwing off reason and morality. I gather this is not how the film is usually described, but I think Lawford must have agreed with my memory of it because he lifted me out of Marilyn\x{2019}s arms with a whoosh of recognition. \x{2018}Good Lord,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}You\x{2019}ve brought the dog.

That is often the way with human struggles, I\x{2019}ve noticed: they start in barrios and rowdy cafes and they end in the grand rooms of plush hotels, or in fetid palaces, bordered by guards and grey sofas. The contradiction seemed very earthy at the Grand Hotel, very much at home, jungle vegetation and overhead fans working together to stir the air. \x{2018}Of course!\x{2019} the manager seemed to say, there is a necessary distinction between the glorious masses and the chosen few.
