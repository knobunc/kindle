From then on, for many years, I always hoped that the long succession of hot days would be repeated, but unless my memory betrays me it never was, in England at any rate, until <<1959|9n:0>>. It became for me a kind of Golden Age\x{2014}almost literally, for I think of it as being the colour of gold.

The frightful feeling of being marked out for ridicule came back in all its strength. I don\x{2019}t think I was unduly sensitive; in my experience most people mind being laughed at more than anything else.

We came to a road between the trees and followed it, and then scrambled down a steep tree-lined bank and over a stile into a meadow. Another stage nearer the experience!

The chairs were drawn back and ranged round the walls; they were all alike, I think, but I had my favourite chair, which I could distinguish by certain signs, and I always tried to get it. After the gong had gone, the servants filed in, headed by the butler wearing his most solemn air. I always counted them but could never make them more than ten, though there were said to be twelve in the house. The family were less regular in attendance. Mrs. Maudsley was always there; Marcus and I made it a point of honour; Denys came from time to time and Marian, who was seldom there at the opening, sometimes came in half-way through. On the whole, rather more than half the guests used to attend. It was in no way compulsory, Marcus told me; but most households that were not \x{201c}fast\x{201d} had family prayers (I dared not tell him that ours hadn\x{2019}t).

Perhaps it was a record, a record at any rate for England, where I believed the shade temperature had never reached a hundred. It was my ambition that it should. Only six degrees to go! A mere trifle, the sun could easily accomplish that; perhaps it would tomorrow. As I stood musing, I seemed to feel within me the world\x{2019}s tremendous meteorological effort to excel itself, to pass into a region of being which it had never attained before. I was myself the mercury (had I not been called Mercury, I thought confusedly) soaring ever to new heights; and Brandham Hall with its still unexplored altitudes of feeling was the mountain on which my experience would be won. I felt intoxicated and light-headed, as though some miraculous boon had been granted to me, something that took me outside myself and the limitations of my normal personality. Yet it was not a solitary experience, it was linked inseparably with the expectation that I saw reflected in the faces round me.

            'At his public school, Harrow, Hartley was the only boy from a family with Liberal political sympathies in his house, and his background in Wesleyan Methodism would have made his origins very clear to both his teachers and fellow students. Thus in his early teens he was handed a great gift for a novelist, something that may have made him personally unhappy but that allowed him to study the world as an outsider with a need to watch and learn and never feel comfortable. Hartley did not, however, enjoy his outsider status. By <<1911|9n:0>> he was going for confirmation classes, and he subsequently became a member of the established church, the religion of his fellow Harrovians, the Church of England. All his life he felt this need to join the tribe, the upper class in England, with its extraordinary rules and snobberies. He put so much energy into moving himself, his whole being, from one class to another that it seemed to leave him exhausted. Thus when the English class system came under attack in the years after the First World War, Hartley was left defenseless. He never ceased to long for a Platonic England that he was sure had existed in his childhood and early youth, and his novels and stories play out the drama between his own uncertain status and his love and longing for a time of certainty, a world waiting to be broken, uncertainty made flesh.',

In one year he entertained forty-eight groups of houseguests. His homosexuality was known to most of those close to him, but he did not have a lover or companion. His mother, who lived until <<1948|9c:0>>, longed for his company and never ceased to want him to return to live in the family home. As time went by, Hartley drank more and began to dislike the filthy modern tide. He deplored jazz and motorcycles and swans (which impeded his boating activities) and the working class.
