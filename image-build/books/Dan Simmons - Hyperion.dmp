In the morning he had breakfast at a local cafe and then farcast to Renaissance Vector where he worked for about five hours, evidently gathering research of some sort in the print archives, followed by a light lunch at a courtyard vendor\x{2019}s stand, another hour or two in the library, and then \x{2019}cast home to Lusus or to some favorite eating spot on another world. In his cubby by <<2200 hours|1>>. More farcasting than the average Lusian middle-class drone, but an otherwise uninspiring schedule. The credit flimsies confirmed that he had held to the agenda on the week he was murdered, with the addition of a few extra purchases\x{2014}shoes one day, groceries the next\x{2014}and one stop at a bar on Renaissance V on the day of his \x{201c}murder.\x{201d}",

For the last course the audience viewing pod was farcast to some godforsaken world\x{2026}Armaghast, I think\x{2026}and a FORCE:ground recon platoon fired a clean tactical nuke at a pretend adversary some nine klicks away. The viewing pod was shielded with a class ten containment field, polarized, the nuke only a fifty-kiloton field tactical, but I\x{2019}ll never forget the blast, the shock wave rocking the eighty-ton pod like a leaf on its repellers, the physical shock of light so obscenely bright that it polarized our field to <<midnight|13>> and still brought tears to our eyes and clamored to get in.",

Johnny\x{2019}s power gauntlets were massive and a bright red. I wore osmosis gloves with killing trim. Johnny carried an Ouster hellwhip captured on Bressia and had tucked a laser wand in his belt. Along with Dad\x{2019}s automatic, I now carried a Steiner-Ginn mini-gun on a gyroed waist brace. It was slaved to my command visor and I could keep both hands free while firing.",
