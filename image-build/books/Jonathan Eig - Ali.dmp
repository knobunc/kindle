Clay started by measuring Jawish with jabs, then began throwing quick hooks. He kept them coming so swiftly and with such forward momentum that Jawish lost the ability to hit back.

After saying throughout most of 1973 that his retirement was imminent, he continued fighting through 1974 at a pace usually reserved for up-and-comers. These one-sided bouts were no good for boxing. They turned the sport into a mockery. They undercut the democratic idea that fighters could work their way to a shot at the title. The mismatches were no good for Ali, either. He was older, slower, and heavier now. He gulped down Coca-Cola like it was water. He could pour six packets of sugar into one cup of coffee.

But for this fight, a new option became available, if only for the 100,000 or so American homeowners who subscribed to Home Box Office, the fledgling cable TV station. On the night of the fight, HBO became the first network to broadcast nationally via satellite. To make it work, a transmitter in the Philippines bounced a signal across the Pacific Ocean via satellite to a station in Jamesburg, California. The station in Jamesburg transmitted the signal by AT&T land lines to a telephone switching center in Manhattan, where it was rerouted to the HBO studios on 23rd Street, and then relayed by satellite to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; beamed to a station in Fort Pierce, Florida; and delivered by microwave link to cable providers.
