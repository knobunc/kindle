            "From age <<4 to 15|10a:1>>, Alice Sheldon\x{2019}s childhood was dominated by the experience of accompanying her parents on their (widely reported) explorations and trips. . . . She found herself interacting with adults of every size, color, shape, and condition \x{2013} lepers, black royalty in lionskins, white royalty in tweeds, Arab slavers, functional saints and madmen in power . . . and above all, women: chattel-women deliberately starved, deformed, blinded and enslaved; women in nuns\x{2019} habits saving the world; women in high heels saving the world, and women in low heels shooting little birds; an Englishwoman in bloomers riding out from her castle at the head of her personal Moslem army; women, from the routinely tortured, obscenely mutilated slave-wives of the \x{2018}advanced\x{2019} Kibuyu, to the free, propertied, Sumarran matriarchs who ran the economy and brought six hundred years of peaceful prosperity to the Menang-Kabau; all these were known before she had a friend or playmate of her own age.She worked as an artist and illustrator before World War II, and then joined the US Army from <<1942|9c:0>>. She became the first female US photo-intelligence officer. While working in occupied France, she met and subsequently married Colonel Huntingdon D Sheldon. Huntingdon Sheldon subsequently became one of the founding officers of the nascent CIA, and Alice Sheldon continued to do work for it, particularly around photo-intelligence. Judging by her own testimony, she became sceptical of the value and efficacy of intelligence work as practised by the CIA, especially around the Bay of Pigs fiasco. But she was also fond of emphasising her connection with this world. One of her editors, David Hartwell, once told me that she was fond of dropping into conversation tantalising snippets like, \x{201c}You have no idea how tough it was in the 1960s when we were trying to get hold of a sample of Fidel Castro\x{2019}s urine.\x{201d} In the late 1950s she had a hiatus for taking stock, which led to another change of career. She took degrees in psychology, concentrating on the workings of visual perception. This culminated in a PhD in 1967.",
