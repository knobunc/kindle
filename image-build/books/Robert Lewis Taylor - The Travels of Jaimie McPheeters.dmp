As you know, Willie delivered us in the rig to Portland; dawn was breaking as we arrived. The boat I\x{2019}d booked stateroom passage on, the Courier\x{2014}a packet for St. Louis\x{2014}was lying in the canal, though far from ready to go, despite the advertised sailing time of <<8 A.M.|5>> It was nearer 11 when our cargo was aboard and the plank taken in. You may imagine what a fever of anxiety I generated during this delay; we alternated between disposing our luggage in the astonishingly small cabin assigned us (a mere closet, with wooden bunks one above the other, next to the ladies\x{2019} quarters in the stern) and pacing the upper deck, myself watching the communicating roads, as the morning wore on.",

The hour was <<nearly midnight|3b>> when Streeter went to his reward in the wheelhouse of the Courier, with Jaimie among the horrified onlookers peering through the glass. The accident had occurred at <<nine|9c:1>>, as he and I were preparing to leave for bed. When finally we got into our bunks, we were, I am sure, distressed and wakeful. I fell into a sleep disturbed by visions of that grotesque shape in the paddle wheel (some of Streeter\x{2019}s clothes were even torn from his body, such was the violence of the blades) and I awoke early, at the first streaks of sunrise. I sensed rather than noticed that Jaimie was not in his bunk. Springing down, I verified that this was the case, and with agitated heart, flung on some clothes and searched the deck, thinking to surprise him in an early morning stroll. He was nowhere to be seen. Frantically, now, I rushed through the ship\x{2014}into the saloon, the engine room\x{2014}room by courtesy only; it was all but exposed to the elements\x{2014}through the lower deck, and at last to the Captain\x{2019}s cabin.

About the first thing that turned up was that the old gentleman, who went by the name of John, claimed to be John Murrel, the pirate and outlaw. I was acquainted with this Murrel, or leastways with the real article. He had been written up in a paper-backed book I\x{2019}d got off a shantyboater for two stringy rabbits from my traps. According to the reports, he had ended up by going around trying to coax all the slaves to rise up against their masters and kill them with axes and hoes, upon which he would run a \x{201c}southern empire,\x{201d} with whiskey and women for all. It might have worked, too, but one of his partners named Steward told on him, and the people around Natchez charged forward and placed Murrel in jail, where they hoped he would be less of a nuisance. After that they had a kind of picnic, going overboard on the other side, as reformers generally do, and hung all his friends, and some of his acquaintances, and several strangers, including a number who were just passing through, and wound up by flogging everybody else in sight.

            'A brief medical note: Assembled, ready to move, on the opposite bank, we found many of our people ill. The influence of the alkali has affected us all. As senior physician present, I gave a lecture on health, advising a low diet and cooling aperients, stating in addition that I had decided against bleeding, and suggesting that those ill suck linen rags soaked in vinegar. Green goggles were found for a few suffering from opthalmic irritation of dust and sun, and cambric mouth veils were provided for those with coughs. I concluded with advices on bathing: Cleanliness and frequent baths, I said, are your best preventives of sickness, but I cautioned against bathing if fatigued and recommended as the best hour for this exercise around nine or <<ten in the morning|5>>; one is stronger then than at other times of day. My further directions were, heed not the coldness of the water if it is soft; and after leaving the water, begin an active rubbing with a coarse towel, until a reaction takes place in the skin; dress rapidly, drink a long draught of pure water, and commence a smart walk until perspiration ensues; then cool gradually and fix the mind on subjects of pleasant good cheer.',
