And no one was thinking about the library when the Orion group, still at the Barnard Street School, established the basic dimensions of the ship. \"Something with a gross weight of 4,000 tons was the way all of us were thinking about Orion at the very beginning,\" Ted explains. \"A 4,000-ton vehicle, how big is that? Well, <<about 100|9:0>> to 150 feet across. How much does 150 feet mean to somebody\x{2014}me in particular? Nothing without comparing it to something else. It turned out, when I went out and paced the distance, to be the diameter of the General Atomic library. This was after the general scale of the thing was determined, while we were still at the schoolhouse. How did the transfer of attention happen? The library was obviously something to point at if one wanted to say roughly how big the thing was\x{2014}or could be. Once having done that it was easy to visualize shrinking down this dimension closer to a delivery shaft for warheads. The shock absorber distances were about right if you just went from floor to floor. It was easier to me than pointing at a blackboard to say here's this building and just imagine that there are nitrogen-filled shock absorbers directly attached to pneumatic tirelike things at one end. You get a sense of how the shock absorbers looked. Were they spindly? No, they weren't. The columns that are out there are roughly half the diameter they should be. It was a very helpful way to think about the project as a whole.",

What I like about gliding is that most of the time when you are not flying there are lots of jobs to do and it is a friendly group of people. Of course the best part of the day was the two flights. One lasted 15 minutes and the other ten. We fly up on a wire which is pulled by a winch, then let go of the wire and sail around in the wind where it rises over the cliffs.

Best known as the place where Albert Einstein spent his later years, it is less known for its contributions to digital computing and the hydrogen bomb. This was no coincidence. The Institute was also home to John von Neumann, who in November of 1945 persuaded the Institute trustees to break their rule of supporting only pure science and allow him to build what became the archetype of the modern digital computer, inoculating its 5,000 bytes of high-speed memory with the order codes and subroutines out of which the rudiments of an operating system and the beginnings of the software industry evolved. In 1950 and 1951, even before the machine was fully operational, von Neumann set it to work, once for as many as sixty days nonstop, on a series of calculations that led directly to the first thermonuclear bomb.',

            'The Super was, as Oppenheimer put it in 1949, "singularly proof against any form of experimental approach." How do you begin to build a hydrogen bomb, when you have no idea whether it is possible or not? You build it numerically, neutron by neutron and nanosecond by nanosecond, in the memory of a computer, first. Ulam, von Neumann, and Nick Metropolis developed the "Monte Carlo Method" of statistical approximation whereby a random sampling of events in an otherwise intractable branching process is followed through a series of representative slices in time, answering the otherwise incalculable question of whether a given configuration would go thermonuclear or not. Computers led to bombs, and bombs led to computers. Although kept largely secret, the push to develop the Super drove the initial development of the digital computers then adapted to other purposes by companies like IBM. Ralph Slutz, who worked with von Neumann on the Institute for Advanced Study computer project, remembers "a couple of people from Los Alamos" showing up as soon as the machine was provisionally operational, "with a program which they were terribly eager to run on the machine... starting at <<midnight|9g>>, if we would let them have the time."[22]',

            'Project Orion\'s plans, at the end of 1958, were to start off by launching a 50-foot-high, dome-shaped, 50- to 100-ton unmanned "recoverable test vehicle," with a 40-foot-diameter pusher plate, propelled to an altitude of 125,000 feet by <<100|3:0>> to 200 explosions ranging from .003 to .5 kiloton in yield. An "orbital test vehicle" was to weigh 880 tons and would be 80 feet in diameter and 120 feet in height, propelled into a 300-mile orbit by <<800|3:0>> bombs of .03 to 3-kiloton yield. This trial-sized Orion was still estimated to be capable of carrying 80 tons to Mars orbit with a 300-mile Earth-orbit return. By the end of the first year it was evident that the leap to 50- and 880-ton test vehicles was too ambitious and "a step by step progression to the full scale 4,000-ton vehicle" was in the works.[243] The first step, as proposed to ARPA in the spring of 1959, would be "a small scale model with a pusher about 10 feet in diameter and the whole model weighing about 5 tons. The model would be taken up to high altitude by airplane or balloons in order to reduce drag effects where it would be released. Propulsion would be by a few high explosive shots culminating, perhaps, in 3 or 4 very small atomic shots."[244] Plans called for launching this model by June 1960. The next step would be an unmanned 40-foot-diameter model weighing 400 tons, "which will carry a useful payload of 60 tons into orbit using 500 one-hundred-ton atomic shots."[245] This was scheduled for completion early in 1962.',

Tests were being conducted on the ground, in the air, underwater, and, at Bikini and Eniwetok, aboard barges, since if tests on low coral islands were continued there might not be enough of them left to constitute an atoll when testing stopped. Bombs were being placed at the tops of towers, dropped from aircraft, shot from guns, lofted by balloons, and launched into space by rockets. "In those days they were really fooling around," says Freeman. "It was just like a fireworks show, you could shoot up almost anything you wanted!"

These missions ranged from an eight-man orbital exploration mission carrying only 1,650 pounds of destination payload, requiring an Earth-orbit departure weight of 600 tons, to a twenty-man mission carrying a 330,000-pound destination payload, with an Earth-orbit departure weight of 1,200 tons.
