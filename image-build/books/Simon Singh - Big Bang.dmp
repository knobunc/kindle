            "Pythagoras of Samos helped to reinforce the foundations of this new rationalist movement from around 540 BC. As part of his philosophy, he developed a passion for mathematics and demonstrated how numbers and equations could be used to help formulate scientific theories. One of his first breakthroughs was to explain the harmony of music via the harmony of numbers. The most important instrument in early Hellenic music was the tetrachord, or four-stringed lyre, but Pythagoras developed his theory by experimenting with the single-stringed monochord. The string was kept under a fixed tension, but the length of the string could be altered. Plucking a particular length of string generated a particular note, and Pythagoras realised that halving the length of the same string created a note that was one octave higher and in harmony with the note from the plucking of the original string. In fact, changing the string\x{2019}s length by any simple fraction or ratio would create a note harmonious with the first (e.g. a ratio of 3:2, now called a musical fifth), but changing the length by an awkward ratio (e.g. <<15:37|2>>) would lead to a discord.",

            'While at the library, Eratosthenes learned of a well with remarkable properties, situated near the town of Syene in southern Egypt, near modern-day Aswan. At <<noon|13>> on 21 June each year, the day of the summer solstice, the Sun shone directly into the well and illuminated it all the way to the bottom. Eratosthenes realised that on that particular day the Sun must be directly overhead, something that never happened in Alexandria, which was several hundred kilometres north of Syene. Today we know that Syene lies close to the Tropic of Cancer, the most northerly latitude from which the Sun can appear overhead.',

            "Aware that the Earth\x{2019}s curvature was the reason why the Sun could not be overhead at both Syene and Alexandria simultaneously, Eratosthenes wondered if he could exploit this to measure the circumference of the Earth. He would not necessarily have thought about the problem in the same way we would, as his interpretation of geometry and his notation would have been different, but here is a modern explanation of his approach. Figure 1 shows how parallel rays of light from the Sun hit the Earth at <<noon|13>> on 21 June. At exactly the same moment that sunlight was plunging straight down the well at Syene, Eratosthenes stuck a stick vertically in the ground at Alexandria and measured the angle between the Sun\x{2019}s rays and the stick. Crucially, this angle is equivalent to the angle between two radial lines drawn from Alexandria and Syene to the centre of the Earth. He measured the angle to be 7.2\x{b0}.",

            "Whether he was accurate to 2% or 15% is irrelevant. The important point is that Eratosthenes had worked out how to reckon the size of the Earth scientifically. Any inaccuracy was merely the result of poor angular measurement, an error in the Syene\x{2014}Alexandria distance, the timing of <<noon|13>> on the solstice, and the fact that Alexandria was not quite due north of Syene. Before Eratosthenes, nobody knew if the circumference was 4,000 km or 4,000,000,000 km, so nailing it down to roughly 40,000 km was a huge achievement. It proved that all that was required to measure the planet was a man with a stick and a brain.

If you try this you will notice that you can cover the Moon with the end of your forefinger. Figure 3 shows that your fingernail forms a triangle with your eye. The Moon forms a similar triangle, with a vastly greater size but identical proportions.

            "The geometry of the ellipse had been studied since ancient Greek times, so why had nobody ever before suggested ellipses as the shape of the planetary orbits? One reason, as we have seen, was the enduring belief in the sacred perfection of circles, which seemed to blinker astronomers to all other possibilities. But another reason was that most of the planetary ellipses are only very slightly elliptical, so under all but the closest scrutiny they appear to be circular. For example, the length of the minor axis divided by the length of the major axis (see Figure 13) is a good indication of how close an ellipse is to a circle. The ratio equals 1.0 for a circle, but the Earth\x{2019}s orbit has a ratio of 0.99986. Mars, the planet that had given Rheticus nightmares, was so problematic because its orbit is more squashed, but the ratio of the two axes is still very close to 1, at <<0|9:0>>.99566. In short, the Martian orbit was only slightly elliptical, so it duped astronomers into thinking it was circular, but the orbit was elliptical enough to cause real problems for anybody who tried to model it in terms of circles.",

This was the first and only time that a scientist had made a prediction using the anthropic principle and had been proved right. It was an instance of extreme genius.",

            "Jansky mentioned the curious time interval to his colleague Melvin Skellet, who had a Ph.D. in astronomy and who was able to point out the significance of the missing four minutes. Each year the Earth spins on its axis 365/4 times, and each day lasts 24 hours, so one year consists of 365/4 \x{d7} 24 = 8,766 hours. However, as well as spinning on its own axis 365/4 times, the Earth effectively makes one extra spin each year by going once around the Sun. Therefore, the Earth actually makes 366/4 rotations in 8,766 hours (one year), so each rotation takes <<23 hours and 56 minutes|14>>, which is known as the sidereal day. The significance of the sidereal day is that it is the duration of our rotation with respect to the entire universe, as opposed to our provincial 24-hour day.",
