Lunch, a not very big meal, was served at <<one|9c:0>>, and there were a few more jobs to do, and then at <<three|9c:0>>, sharp bells rang up and down the passages and all the Wombles, Great Uncle Bulgaria included, went to their beds and slept, or tried to. At <<ten|9m>> the bells were rung again, and up and down the burrow Wombles stirred and brushed themselves and cleaned their teeth and looked at their excited reflections in mirrors.
