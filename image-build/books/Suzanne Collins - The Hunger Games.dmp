color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy
yellow coat matched the bright flower. I le hates me. Or at least distrusts me.
Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown
him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with
worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed.
But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It turned out okay.
My mother got rid of the vermin and he\x{2019}s a born mouser. Even catches the occasional
rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has

ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters,
the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so
much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The
result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought
peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising of
the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth
obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and,
