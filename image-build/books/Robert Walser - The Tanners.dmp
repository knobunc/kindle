            "Simon went on: \x{201c}When I\x{2019}m on my way to work at <<eight in the morning|5>>, I feel so beautifully connected to all the others who must also report to work at <<eight|9c:1>>. What a great barracks modern life is! And yet how beautiful and contemplative all this uniformity. Constantly you long for something that might be approaching, something you ought to encounter. You\x{2019}re so utterly bereft of possessions, so very much the poor devil, and you find yourself utterly at sea amid all this erudite, orderly precision. I ascend the four flights of stairs, go in, say \x{201c}Good morning\x{201d} and begin my work. Good God, how little is being asked of me, how little knowledge they expect. How little those around me seem to suspect I might be capable of quite different things. But this charming lack of demandingness on the part of my employers suits me perfectly. I can think while I am working\x{2014}I have great prospects of becoming a thinker. I often think of you!\x{201d}",

            "It was <<about two in the afternoon|9h>> when Simon arrived by train in the metropolis he\x{2019}d left behind around three months before. The station was full of people and completely black, filled with that train station odor that\x{2019}s absent only from small, rural stations. Simon was trembling as he got off; he was hungry, stiff, exhausted, sad and sapped of all courage, besides which he couldn\x{2019}t shake off a certain trepidation, though he kept telling himself his trepidation was utterly foolish. Like most travelers, he checked his luggage at the luggage window and lost himself in the crowd. As soon as he was able to move freely again, he immediately felt better and once more was conscious of his effortless good health\x{2014}now in top form owing to his time in the country. He ate something at one of those odd public establishments. So here he was eating again, without much appetite; for the food was meager and poor, good enough for a down-at-the-heels city-dweller, but not for a spoiled denizen of the countryside. The people looked at him attentively, as if they could tell he\x{2019}d just arrived from the country. Simon thought: \x{201c}These people must surely sense that I\x{2019}m used to better food; something of the sort can be discerned in my approach to this meal.\x{201d} In fact he left half of it behind on his plate, paid his bill and couldn\x{2019}t help remarking airily to the waitress how far from tasty he\x{2019}d found it. The waitress gazed at the scornful customer contemptuously, amicably contemptuously, just ever so slightly, as if she had no need to feel indignant at the affront, seeing it was a person of this sort who\x{2019}d complained and not another. If it had been someone else, well then, certainly, but on account of such a one!\x{2014} Simon walked out. He was feeling happy, the second-rate meal and the girl\x{2019}s insulting glance notwithstanding. The sky was a pale blue. Simon gazed at it: Yes, here too he had a sky. In this respect it was perfectly silly to be so partial to the countryside at the city\x{2019}s expense. He resolved to stop thinking back on the countryside now and to acclimatize himself to this new world. He saw how people went walking on before him, going much faster than he did; for in the country he\x{2019}d grown accustomed to an ambling, deliberate gait, as though he were afraid of advancing too quickly. Well, for today he decided to permit himself to go on walking like a peasant, but from tomorrow on he\x{2019}d stride forward in a different manner. He observed people affectionately, however, with no trace of shyness, he met their eyes and looked at their legs to see how they were moving them, at their hats to observe the progress of fashion, and at their clothes to be able to judge his own outfit still good enough compared with the many unlovely garments he was now industriously scrutinizing. How hurriedly they walked, these people. He would have liked to stop one of them and address to him the words: What\x{2019}s the rush? But then he seemed to lack the courage for such a foolish undertaking. He felt fine, though he was also a bit weary and tense. A tiny, undeniable mournfulness held him in its grasp, but that harmonized well with the light, happy, somewhat overcast sky. It also harmonized with the city, where to wear too sunny an expression was all but unseemly. Simon had to confess to himself that he was walking there looking for nothing, but he nonetheless found it expedient to assume the bearing of a seeker, someone pressing rapidly forward like all the others, for he had no wish to play the role of the idle newcomer. He preferred not to call attention to himself, and it did him good to see his behavior wasn\x{2019}t attracting notice. From this he concluded that he was still capable of city life, and so he carried himself a bit more upright than before and acted as though he were carrying around with him a small, elegant intention, one that he was imperturbably pursuing, but which elicited from him no worry, only interest, and would not dirty his shoes or tire his hands. He was just now walking through a beautiful affluent street planted on both sides with blossoming trees, a street in which, given how broad it was, you had the sky more freely before your eyes. It was truly a splendid bright street, just the sort to conjure up the most pleasant existences and inspire dreams. Simon now completely forgot his plan of walking through this street with a deliberate air. He let himself go, allowed himself to drift, looking now at the ground, now up above, now to the side into one of the many shop windows, before one of which he finally remained standing, without actually looking at anything. He found it agreeable to have the noise of the beautiful lively street at his back and yet also in his ears. His perceptions distinguished the footsteps of individual passers-by, all of whom no doubt could only assume he was standing there taking a good look at something on display in the shop window. Suddenly he heard someone addressing him. He turned around and beheld a lady demanding that he carry a package she was holding out to him all the way to her home. This lady was not particularly beautiful, but at this moment Simon\x{2019}s task was not to lose himself in reflections concerning the degree of her beauty but rather, as an inner voice cried out to him, to step lively and do as she instructed. He took the package, which wasn\x{2019}t at all heavy, and carried it, following behind the lady as she cut across the street with small, measured steps without turning even once to look back at the young man. Having arrived before an, as it appeared, distinguished building the woman commanded him to come upstairs with her, and so he did. He saw no reason why he should refuse to comply. Accompanying this lady into her home felt perfectly natural, and obeying her voice was quite appropriate for his situation, which was so undefined. He would perhaps still have been standing before the shop window gaping, he thought as he climbed the stairs. When they reached the top, the woman invited him inside. She went on ahead and gestured him into a room whose door she opened. To Simon the room appeared quite splendid. The woman came in, sat down on one of the chairs, cleared her throat a little, looked at the one standing before her and asked whether he might make up his mind to enter her service. The impression she had of him, she went on, was that of an individual standing idly about in the world, a person one would be doing a favor by offering him work. As for the rest, she found him quite passable, and would he please tell her whether he was inclined to accept her offer?",

            "He walked down the street, falling in love with its sweet tableau of rising stars, of dense trees that stretched in long straight rows, and the peacefully ambulating people, the evening\x{2019}s splendor, the deep, restless inklings of night. He too was walking peacefully, almost dreamily. In the evening it was no disgrace to put on a dreamy appearance when all were involuntarily compelled to dream in this atmosphere filled with the scent of the early summer twilight. Many women were strolling about with small elegant little bags in their gloved hands, with eyes in which the evening light went on glowing, in narrow dresses cut in the English style or voluminous dragging skirts and robes that filled the streets with their marvelous breadth. Woman, Simon mused, how she glorifies the image of the city street. A woman is made to promenade. You can feel her parading, enjoying her own swaying, beautiful gait. At sunset, women determine the tone of the evening, their figures being well suited to this with these arms full of melancholy and ampleness and these breasts full of breathing mobility. Their hands in gloves look like children wearing masks, hands with which they beckon, and in which they are invariably holding something. Their entire bearing translates the evening world into sonorous music. If you now, as I am just doing, go walking along behind women, you already belong to them in your thoughts, in sentient oscillations, in breaking waves that crash against your heart. They do not beckon, and yet they do beckon you. Though they carry no fans, you can see fans in their hands, flashing and glinting like embossed silver in the fading, blurred evening light. Mature, voluptuous women go particularly well with such an evening, just as gray-haired old women go with winter, and blossoming girls with the newly arisen day, as children go with dawn and young wives with the heat of <<midday|13>> when the sun shows itself to the world at its most glowing.",

            "Three weeks later, liberated from all obligations, Simon stood in a narrow, steep, hot alleyway before a building, deliberating whether or not to go in. The <<noonday|13>> sun was blazing down, making the walls release their unsavory odors. Not the slightest breeze was stirring. Where in this alley could a breeze have slipped in? Out in the modern streets there might be breezes wafting, but in here it felt as if centuries had passed since a breath of air last breezed and blew. Simon had a small sum of money in his pocket. Should he board a train and travel to the mountains? Everyone was traveling to the mountains these days. Strange unfamiliar people, men and women, moved singly, in pairs, or little groups through the white bright streets. From the hats of the ladies, amusing veils fluttered down, and the men were going about in knee-length trousers and light-colored summer shoes. Oughtn\x{2019}t he decide to follow these strangers to the mountains? Surely it would be cooler up there, and in a hotel perched high up on a peak he would surely find work. He might even play the role of tour guide, he was rugged enough for this, and also clever enough to say at the appropriate time: \x{201c}Observe, ladies and gentlemen, this waterfall, or this scree, or this village, or this cliff face, or this blue shimmering river.\x{201d} He\x{2019}d have what it takes to depict a landscape in words for his traveling guests. He could also, should the circumstance arise, carry a fatigued and fearful Englishwoman in his arms when it came time to cross a pass just three shoe-lengths wide. Certainly he had a desire to do so. Oh yes, those American girls and Englishwomen: He\x{2019}d learn to speak English, which to his mind was a sweet language that sounded like whispers and sighing, both gruff and soft.",

            "For the entire rest of that week, Simon carried on this otiose social intercourse with the nurse, with whom he\x{2019}d get into arguments and then make up again. He played cards like someone who\x{2019}d been doing so for years, and rolled billiard balls around in the middle of the warm day while everyone possessed of hands was working. He saw streets filled with sunlight and alleyways in rainy weather, but always through a windowpane, with a glass of beer in his hand; made long, useless, wild speeches morning, <<noon|13>> and night among all manner of strangers, until finally he saw he had nothing more to live on. And one morning he didn\x{2019}t go to visit Heinrich but instead made his way to a room where any number of young and old men sat at desks writing. This was the Copyists Office for the Unemployed, where people came who, owing to their particular life circumstances, found themselves in such a position that securing employment in a regular place of business was out of the question. Individuals of this sort worked for meager day-wages here, copying out addresses with hasty fingers beneath the strict supervision of a supervisor or secretary\x{2014}business addresses for the most part, in lots of one thousand, for which large firms contracted with the office. Writers brought in their scribbled manuscripts, and female students their all but illegible dissertations so as to have them either typed out on the typewriter or copied in a smooth clean hand. People who didn\x{2019}t know how to write but had something they needed written down brought their documents here, where the work was quickly seen to. Cake-counter ladies, waitresses, laundresses and chambermaids had their letters of recommendation copied out tidily before proffering them for examination. Benevolent associations turned in thousands of yearly reports that had to be addressed and disseminated. The Association for Natural Healing had multiple copies made of the invitations to their folksy lectures, and professors had no end of work for the copyists, who in turn were happy to have the work. This entire copying enterprise was supported by yearly subventions from the local government and headed by an administrator\x{2014}himself formerly unemployed\x{2014}for whom the post had been created to give him a suitable occupation for his old days. He was the scion, so to speak, of an old patrician family and had wealthy relatives on the city council who didn\x{2019}t want to sit back and watch one of their family members go to ruin under shameful circumstances. And so this man became the king and protector of all the vagabonds, lost souls and hard-luck cases, and he discharged these duties with a casual dignity, as if he\x{2019}d never in all his wild days, some of which he\x{2019}d spent on the road in America, tasted the bitterness of deprivation.",

These were all people who at some point in their lives had succumbed to some form of dissolution and lost the ground under their unsteady feet. There were people there who because of some serious offense committed years before had spent time in jail. An old, very handsome man was known to have spent years in prison because of a heinous crime against morality he\x{2019}d committed against his own flesh and blood: his daughter, who denounced him to the judge. In all the time Simon observed him, his silent strange face remained free of all expression, as though silence and listening were native to that face and had become a necessity. He worked calmly, peacefully and slowly, was handsome, looked at you calmly when you looked at him, and appeared to be not in the least conscious of some tormenting memory. His heart seemed to be beating as quietly as his old hand was working. No trace of a grimace could be remarked in any of his features. He appeared to have atoned for and washed away everything that might ever have disfigured or soiled him. His clothes were tidier than those of the administrator, although he must have been poor. His teeth and hands were curiously well groomed, as were his shoes and clothes. His soul appeared to be calm and unusually pure. Simon thought of him: \x{201c}Why not? Can\x{2019}t sins be washed away, and should a jail sentence destroy an entire life? No, one sees neither a sin once committed nor a jail term served when one looks at this man.

            "Embezzlement, theft, fraud and vagrancy all had their representatives in the Copyists Office. Present as well were the merely unfortunate, greenhorns who\x{2019}d been duped by life and foreigners from abroad who simply found themselves without a bite to eat because their hopes had been dashed. Surely there were also notorious idlers and eternal malcontents. Every combination of culpability and bad luck could be found there, along with that sort of frivolity which takes pleasure in being so out-of-pocket. Simon might have used this opportunity to make the acquaintance of man in his various guises, but he wasn\x{2019}t much thinking about observing other people, as he himself was kept as busy as all the others filling out forms and sinking as if in a river amid the life and bustle of the Copyists Office with all its cares, labors, little incidents and questions. Someone who\x{2019}s sunk beneath the surface of a thing doesn\x{2019}t think so much about the thing itself as about his own physical needs, just like all the others. Everyone here was copying away to earn what they would soon have to invest in food and drink if they wished to go on living. Their earnings flowed down their throats, from hand to mouth. Simon also managed to buy himself a straw hat and a pair of cheap shoes. But when he thought of the rent for his room, he had to confess to himself that he wasn\x{2019}t in a position to find the cash for this as well. Yet he was always tired and happy in the evenings when he\x{2019}d finished writing. He\x{2019}d go walking then, in the company of one of his fellow scribes, through the city streets with his head held high, absentmindedly smiling at the people walking past. He didn\x{2019}t even have to make an effort to achieve a beautiful proud posture; he stood up straight without even trying, his chest broadened and stretched like a tightly-drawn bow the moment he walked out the door of the Office and into the air. He suddenly felt he was the born lord and master of his limbs and consciously attended to each of his own footsteps. He now no longer kept his hands in his trouser pockets, that would have struck him as undignified. In fact, he no longer slouched at all but rather strolled with measured attentiveness, as if he were only just now, in his twenty-first year of life, beginning to cultivate a beautiful firm gait. Looking at him, a person was not to think of poverty; he was merely to sense that this was a young man who was just coming from work and now permitting himself an evening stroll. The swift, bustling world of the street enchanted his eye. When a carriage with a pair of dancing, delicate horses passed by, he fixed his gaze on the gait of the trotting animals, not deigning to cast even a brief glance at the gentlefolk sitting in the wagon, as though he were a connoisseur of horses, interested only in them. \x{201c}How agreeable this is,\x{201d} he thought. \x{201c}A person really must learn to master his gaze and send it only to places where it is seemly and manly for his eyes to rest.\x{201d} He cast sidelong glances at a number of women and had to laugh inside to see the sort of impression this made. And all the while he was daydreaming, as always! Except that now he gritted his teeth while dreaming, no longer allowing himself an indolent weary posture: \x{201c}Even if I\x{2019}m one of the poorest devils, it wouldn\x{2019}t occur to me to let this be evident in my person; on the contrary, financial woes practically oblige one to assume a proud comportment. If I were rich, I might possibly allow myself a certain negligence. But under these circumstances, it\x{2019}s out of the question, as a person must be conscious of maintaining an equilibrium. I\x{2019}m dog-tired, but I cannot help thinking: Others have cause to feel weary as well. A person doesn\x{2019}t live merely for himself, but for others as well. You have an obligation to cut a stalwart exemplary figure as long as you\x{2019}re being observed, so that those of lesser courage can take you as a model. You should give the impression of carefree solidity, even if your knees are trembling and your stomach is warbling up into your throat out of emptiness. Such things are a source of pleasure to a young man who\x{2019}s just growing up! The clock has not yet struck <<twelve|11>>, not for any of us; after all, any person lying on the ground impoverished enjoys the prospect of rising up again. I\x{2019}ve a hunch that a proud free bearing can itself draw life happiness to a person like an electrical current, and it\x{2019}s certainly true that you feel richer and more exalted when you walk about with dignity. Should you happen to be in the company of a second ill-dressed poor devil, as is presently the case, all the more cause to walk with head erect, thereby gently and vigorously apologizing, as it were, for the other\x{2019}s inferior hairstyle and posture before people who may be taken aback to see two individuals who comport themselves so differently strolling along as cozy as can be, clearly intimate friends, in this elegant street. A thing like this brings you respect, fleeting as it might be. Certainly it\x{2019}s charming to think you stand out agreeably from a companion who doesn\x{2019}t yet quite have what it takes or never will. Incidentally my companion is an older, unfortunate man, the former owner of a basket-weaving shop, who has sunk in life thanks to all sorts of adversity and now is a copyist for daily hire, just like me, except that I don\x{2019}t look entirely like a copyist and day laborer but rather more like a mad Englishman, whereas my comrade looks like someone painfully longing to return to former better days. His gait and the way his head is constantly, sweetly, touchingly wobbling speak of his misfortunate in quite shameless words. He\x{2019}s an older man and no longer wishes to impress; all he wants is to hold himself a little bit upright. Me he impresses; for I know his pain and understand what a heavy burden he carries. I feel proud to be walking beside him through an elegant part of town, and press myself impertinently close to him to demonstrate my unabashed affection for his paltry suit. I\x{2019}m receiving many astonished glances, many a splendid eye is looking at me in a strangely quizzical way, which can only amuse me\x{2014}to so-and-so with all that! I speak loudly, emphatically. The evening is so beautifully suited to speaking. I worked all day long. It\x{2019}s a splendid thing to have worked all day and then in the evening be so beautifully weary and at peace with all things. To have not a worry, scarcely even a thought. To be allowed to stroll along so frivolously, with a sense of having done no harm to any man. To look around to see if you\x{2019}re meeting with approval. To feel you\x{2019}re now a bit more deserving of love and respect than before, when you were just a malingerer whose days sank one behind the other into an abyss and drifted away on the air like smoke. To feel much, so very much, on a gift of an evening such as this! To see the evening as a gift, for this is what it is to those who sacrifice their days to work. Thus one gives and receives in turn\x{2014}\x{201d}",

Envy and ambitions, hate and love, preferential treatment and honesty, vehement and modest natures manifested themselves here in microcosm, where only the pettiest advantages were at stake, just as clearly and unmistakably as anywhere people struggled to make a living. There were no sentiments or urges that could not find themselves actualized here, if only on a paltry scale. Glorious troves of knowledge, to be sure, were of little use in the Office. A bearer of such knowledge could put it to use here at most improvisatorially, it could boost his standing, but it wouldn\x{2019}t help him to acquire a better suit. Several members of the copyists fraternity spoke and wrote three languages to perfection. They were put to work translating, but doing so didn\x{2019}t earn them any more than the loutish address writers and manuscript copiers received\x{2014}the Copyists Office did not allow any one individual to rise within its ranks, that would have contradicted its own goals and purpose.

            "Popping the money he\x{2019}d received into his vest pocket, he walked over to the window and beheld, down below in the narrow alleyway, a woman dressed all in black who seemed to be looking for something, for she kept tilting her head to look up, and in one such moment her eyes met those of Simon. These were large, dark eyes, true female eyes, and Simon involuntarily thought of Klara, whom he hadn\x{2019}t seen in such a long time now; indeed he\x{2019}d almost forgotten her. But it wasn\x{2019}t Klara. This beautiful creature in the deep alley with her elegant, opulent dress offered a strange contrast to the dismal filthy walls between which she was slowly walking. Simon would have liked to call out to her: \x{201c}Is it you, Klara?\x{201d} But already the figure was vanishing around a corner, and nothing of her remained in the alleyway except the faint scent of melancholy that beauty always leaves behind in dismal places. \x{201c}How beautiful it would have been, and how fitting, just at the moment when she looked up, to have thrown her a large dark red rose that she would have bent down to pick up.

            "\x{201c}My name is Tanner, Simon Tanner, and I have four siblings, I am the youngest and the one who occasions the fewest hopes. One brother is a painter, he lives in Paris, and he lives there more quietly and reclusively than in a village, for he is painting. He must have changed a bit by now, it\x{2019}s been over a year since I last saw him, but I think if you were to meet him the impression you\x{2019}d have is of an important and utterly autonomous person. Getting close to him is not without its perils: He captivates people in such a way that one can commit foolhardy acts for his sake. He\x{2019}s a consummate artist, and if I, his brother, understand something about art, it\x{2019}s to his credit rather than my own understanding, which only developed a little as it was drawn to him. I think he must be wearing long curls now, but on him the curls look as natural as a closely shorn head on an officer, they aren\x{2019}t obtrusive. He disappears in the crowd, and it\x{2019}s his wish to disappear so he can work in peace. Once in a letter to me he wrote something about an eagle that spreads its pinions above rocky crags and feels most at home hovering above chasms, and another time he wrote to me that a man and artist must work like a horse\x{2014}collapsing from exhaustion meant nothing at all, it was necessary to collapse and get back up again at once to return to work. He was still just a boy then, and now he paints pictures. If some day he ceases to be able to paint, he\x{2019}ll scarcely be alive any longer. His name is Kaspar, and as a schoolboy he was always considered a lazybones both at school and in the parental home, take my word for it, and this was only because his general manner was so placid, so mild. He was taken out of school at an early age since he wasn\x{2019}t doing well there, and had to carry about boxes and crates, and then he escaped from his homeland, and outside it learned to compel people to give him the respect he deserved. He\x{2019}s one of my brothers, and another is named Klaus. Klaus is the oldest, and I consider him the best and most thoughtful person in all the world. His very gaze bespeaks his forbearance, scrupulousness and consideration. He\x{2019}s an able man, so very able that his modest, discreet abilities will always remain hidden. He watched us younger ones grow up and devote ourselves to our desires and passions, he observed this all in silence and waited, occasionally speaking a word of concern or advice, but always he saw that everyone must tread his own path, he merely did what he could to avert misfortune, and his uncanny acuity of vision always let him discern what was good in a person. This brother is secretly worried about me, I know this quite well, for he loves me, in fact he loves all people and has a strangely shy esteem for them that we younger ones lack. Although he holds a position of prominence in the scholarly world, I am nonetheless convinced that only his scrupulousness\x{2014}which is tempered always with shyness\x{2014}is to blame for his not yet occupying an even higher one, because he deserves the very highest position, the one of greatest responsibility. I have a third brother as well who is unfortunate and nothing more; all that remains of him is what memories of his earlier days can tell a person. He\x{2019}s in the madhouse\x{2014}shouldn\x{2019}t I be permitted to state this candidly? Given that you\x{2019}re sitting here listening to me with such an attentively harkening ear, I assume you\x{2019}re interested in hearing all there is to tell in its most truthful form or else nothing at all, isn\x{2019}t that right? You nod, which says to me I already know you rather well if I make bold to assume you to be a simultaneously kind-hearted and courageous woman. Please keep listening. This unfortunate brother was surely, and I may say so without hesitation, the ideal of a young beautiful man, and he had talents that would have been better suited to the gallant, charming eighteenth century than our times, whose demands are so much harder and drier. Allow me to pass over his misfortune in silence; for in the first place talk of it might dishearten you, and secondly and thirdly, and as far as I\x{2019}m concerned sixthly, it isn\x{2019}t proper to tug apart all the folds of misfortune and cast aside all ceremony, all lovely veiled mourning, which can exist only when one keeps silent on such matters. I\x{2019}ve now given you a tentative, sketchy portrait of my brothers, and now a girl will appear, a lonely schoolmistress sequestered in a little village with thatched roofs, my sister Hedwig. Would you like to make her acquaintance? You and all your sensibilities would be delighted by this girl. There is no prouder creature on all the planet. I lived a full three months with her in idleness in the countryside; she wept when I arrived and laughed at me when, suitcase in hand, I tried to bid her a tender farewell. She threw me out, and at the same time gave me a kiss. She said to me that all she felt for me was a faint, insuppressible contempt, but she said that so sweetly I couldn\x{2019}t help but feel it as a caress. Just imagine, she gave me shelter in her home when I came to her with more beggarly, more importunate demands than the most insolent vagabond who only remembered his sister because it occurred to him: \x{201c}You can go there until you\x{2019}re standing on your own two feet again.\x{201d} \x{2014}But then we lived for three entire months as if in a gay pleasure garden filled with bower-lined paths. Such a thing can never be forgotten. When I went out and took walks in the woods, finding myself too indolent to know whether to scratch my chin or behind my ears, I dreamed of her, of her alone, as if wanting to dream of what was simultaneously closest and farthest away. She was far from me out of reverence and close out of love. She was so proud, I\x{2019}ll have you know, that she never allowed me to feel how very shabby I must have appeared to her. She just felt glad when I made myself at home and settled in with her. This persisted until the very last hour, and then she simply cut my farewell off before it left my lips, in the presentiment that I would say only hurtful, stupid things. When I\x{2019}d left, I turned to look back down the hill behind me and saw her waving at me amicably and simply, as if I were just heading off to the nearest village cobbler and would return in an hour\x{2019}s time. And yet she knew she was being left behind, alone with her isolation, and would be faced with the task of adjusting to the absence of a companion\x{2014}and this certainly was a task, an internal labor. When we sat together in the evenings, we\x{2019}d tell each other stories about our lives, and we heard the wings of childhood beating once more, just as our mother\x{2019}s dress would rustle on the floor of the room when she came toward her children. My mother and my sister Hedwig always comprise in my head an intimately conjoined and interwoven image. When our mother fell ill, it was Hedwig who cared for and tended her, as one must tend a little child. Just imagine: A child must watch her own mother become a child, and becomes a mother to her own mother. What a strange displacement of feelings. My mother was a highly respected woman, and the esteem she received from all sides was pure and heartfelt. The impression she made was always at once rural and refined. Simultaneously unassuming and dismissive, she could quickly put a damper on disobedience and unkindness. Her expression could ask and command at one and the same time. How the ladies in our town would cluster about her when she went for a walk, how many gentlemen\x{2019}s hats were doffed before her. Then, when she fell ill, she was forgotten and became an object of worry and shame. For one feels ashamed when a family member is ill and is almost enraged to remember the days when a healthy woman commanded the respect of all who knew her. Shortly before her death\x{2014}I was fourteen years old at the time\x{2014}she sat down at <<noon|3b>> one day to write a letter: \x{201c}My beloved son.\x{201d} But do you imagine her whimsically slender handwriting continued any further than this salutation? No, she just gave a weary confused smile, murmured something and was compelled to lay down the pen once more. There she sat, there lay the beginning of a letter to her son, there the pen, and the sun was shining out of doors, and I observed all these things. One night Hedwig then knocked at the door of my room, telling me to get up, Mother had died. A thin ray of light fell through the crack of the door as I leapt out of bed. As a girl, my mother had been unhappy, born into unfavorable circumstances. She left the distant mountains and came to live in town with her sister, my aunt\x{2014}where she was forced to work as a maid practically. As a child she walked a long road deeply covered in snow to get to school, and she did her homework in a tiny little room by the light of a paltry candle stub that made her eyes hurt because she could scarcely read the letters in her book. Her parents were unkind to her, and so she became acquainted with melancholy at an early age, and one day, when she was a girl, she stood leaning against the railings of a bridge, wondering whether it wouldn\x{2019}t be better to leap down into the river. She must have been neglected, shunted back and forth and in this way maltreated. When as a boy I once heard about her wicked childhood, I trembled with indignation, rage shot into my face, and from then on I hated the unknown figures of my grandparents. For her children, our mother had, when she was still healthy, something almost majestic about her that frightened and intimidated us; when she became ill in her mind, we pitied her. It was a crazy leap to make: from fearful, mystical awe to pity. All that lay between\x{2014}tenderness and trust\x{2014}remained unknown to us. And so it happened that our pity was strongly intermingled with an unspeakable regret over all we\x{2019}d never felt, which then caused us to pity her all the more deeply. I remembered all my boyish pranks, all my disrespectful behavior\x{2014}and then the sound of our mother\x{2019}s voice, with which she meted out punishments even at a distance, so that the actual physical punishment that followed was sweet, laughable sugar-candy by comparison. She employed just the right tone of voice to make you instantly regret the error you\x{2019}d committed and desire to see her outrage mollified as quickly as possible. There was something so wonderfully mild about her mildness, and seeing it was like receiving a present; we didn\x{2019}t receive it often. Oversensitive irritability was my mother\x{2019}s usual state. We weren\x{2019}t nearly as frightened of our father as of her, we feared only that he might say or do something that would cause Mother to fly into a rage. He was powerless before her\x{2014}it was in his nature to prize vigor far less than relaxation. He was a boon companion, and as such well-loved, but when it came to difficult matters, he wasn\x{2019}t the one to take things in hand. Now he\x{2019}s eighty years old, and when he dies, a piece of town history will die along with him; the old people will shake their heads more pensively and wearily when they no longer see the old man going about his business, which he still does today, and on fairly spry legs. In his youth he was rather a wild fellow who was gradually polished by city life, but this life also gave him a taste for luxury. Both Mother and Father came from rugged, secluded, mountainous regions and then found themselves in a town that even at the time was known, if not notorious, for its liberal vitality. Industry was flourishing in those days like a fiery plant, permitting an easy, carefree lifestyle\x{2014}much money was earned, and much spent. When five or six days a week were workdays, this was considered industriousness. Workers lay for days at a time upon the sunny riverbank, catching fish, when they weren\x{2019}t getting up to mischief. And whenever they needed more money to finance this life, they\x{2019}d go work a few days more, earning enough to return to their leisure. The craftsmen were making money off the workers, for when even the poor have money, how much more prosperous must the well-to-do be. The city appeared to have acquired an additional ten thousand inhabitants overnight, everyone came streaming in from the surrounding countryside into buildings that were occupied and filled the moment they looked on the outside as though they might be finished, never mind how damp and dirty the inside might still be. Construction firms were having a heyday, all they had to do was keep producing buildings, which they did as shoddily as could be managed. Factory owners rode around on horseback, and their ladies traveled in barouches while the town\x{2019}s old nobility observed these activities and sniffed. On festival days the town went all out, surpassing all rivals, and left no stone unturned in its bid to be celebrated everywhere as the best town for revelries. The merchants had nothing to complain about under these circumstances, nor did the schoolchildren; the only ones who felt uneasy were a handful of insightful individuals who couldn\x{2019}t find the courage to join their neighbors on the unsteady, rose-strewn pleasure ground of superficial amusements. Into such surroundings my parents now came, Mother with her irritable sensitivities and her taste for simple refinement, and Father with his talent for assimilating everything around him. For children, every region is lovely and charming, but this particular place, thanks to its setting, was made for children who love to pursue their games amid lairs such as rocks, caves, riverbanks, meadows, hollows, gorges and wooded ravines. And so we enjoyed this entire landscape for our games and inventions until we left school. When Mother died, I was sent to a bank as an apprentice. During the first year I acquitted myself splendidly; for the novelty of what I encountered in this world filled me with timidity and fear. The second year found me a model apprentice, but in the third year of my apprenticeship the director cursed me to the devil, keeping me on only as an act of mercy, in deference to my father, whose close acquaintance he\x{2019}d been for many years. I\x{2019}d lost all gusto for work of any sort and spoke insolently to my superiors, whom I considered unworthy of ordering me around. There was something in me that I now find incomprehensible\x{2014}I recall that everything, every piece of furniture, every object, every word caused me pain. Eventually, I became so timid that the time had come to send me away, and that\x{2019}s what they did. They found me a job in a far-off town just to get rid of me, as I had proved myself utterly useless. And so I left.\x{2014}But now I don\x{2019}t want to think of the past any longer, nor speak of it. There\x{2019}s something wonderful about having escaped one\x{2019}s early youth, for youth is by no means always beautiful, lovely and easy; often it\x{2019}s harder and more filled with worries than the life of many an old man. The more one has lived, the more gently one lives. A person with a tempestuous youth may well in later years rarely or\x{2014}preferably\x{2014}never again behave in a tempestuous manner. When I think of how we children, each of us in turn, had to go through all these things, the years of error and violent emotion, and that all children on earth must do this at their own youthful peril, well then I don\x{2019}t wish to be overhasty in praising the sweetness of childhood, and yet I will praise it, for childhood remains a precious memory all the same. How difficult it often is for parents to be good protective parents; and as for being a well-behaved obedient child\x{2014}how can this be more than a cheap empty phrase for most children? As a woman, by the way, you know this better than I do. To this day I\x{2019}ve remained the least capable of human beings. I don\x{2019}t even have a suit to my name that might bear witness to my having put my life more or less in order. Looking at me, you can\x{2019}t see anything that might point to my having made a certain choice in life. I\x{2019}m still standing at the door of life, knocking and knocking, though admittedly none too forcefully, and breathlessly listening to see whether someone will decide to open the bolt and let me in. A bolt like this is rather heavy, and people don\x{2019}t like to come to the door if they have the feeling it\x{2019}s just a beggar standing outside knocking. I\x{2019}m good at nothing but listening and waiting, though in these capacities I\x{2019}ve achieved perfection, for I\x{2019}ve learned how to dream while waiting. These two things go hand in hand, and dreaming does a person good and preserves respectability. Might I have missed the chance to find my true profession? This is a question I no longer ask myself; a youth might ask such a thing, but not a man. Any profession would have brought me exactly as far as I am now. And why should I concern myself with that! I\x{2019}m quite conscious of my virtues and weaknesses, and take pains to avoid boasting about either. To every person I offer my knowledge, strength, thoughts, achievements and love if he has any use for them. Anyone who wants need only stick out a finger and beckon, and though many a one would thereupon just come hobbling up, not me\x{2014}I come leaping and bounding, do you see, the way the wind whistles, and I skip over and tread heedlessly upon memories of all sorts if that lets me run unhindered. And the entire world comes rushing along with me\x{2014}all of life! That\x{2019}s how it must be, just like that! Nothing in this world is mine, but I no longer yearn for anything. Longing has become a stranger to me. When I still felt certain longings, I found people a matter of indifference, mere hindrances, I sometimes even despised them, but now I love them because I need them and I offer myself to them to be put to use. That\x{2019}s what we\x{2019}re here for. Let\x{2019}s say someone appears and says to me: \x{201c}Hey there, you, come here! I need you. I can give you work!\x{201d} This person makes me happy. Then I know what happiness is! Happiness and pain are completely transformed, they become clearer and more comprehensible to me, they elucidate themselves to me, they permit me to woo them in love and anguish, to court them. Whenever I must submit a letter of application to someone offering my services, I always draw attention to my brothers and point out that since they have both proven to be useful productive individuals, I too might perhaps also be of use, which makes me laugh every time. I\x{2019}m not at all worried that I myself might not, some day, take on some form, but I want to put off forming myself as long as possible. And then it would be best if this came about of its own accord, unintentionally. Now, for starters, I\x{2019}ve had myself measured for a pair of sturdy broad shoes with which I shall tread more firmly and show people with my very footsteps that I am a person with a purpose and no doubt abilities as well. To be put to the test is a pleasure for me! I scarcely know any higher pleasure. That I am poor at the moment, what does that signify? It needn\x{2019}t mean anything at all, it\x{2019}s merely the tiniest slip in the overall composition that can be erased again with a few vigorous strokes. It might at most cause a healthy person a moment of embarrassment, perhaps even worry, but certainly not alarm. You\x{2019}re laughing. No? You\x{2019}re saying you weren\x{2019}t? What a shame that would be, for your laughter is a beautiful thing. For a time it was always my idea that I could become a soldier, but I no longer quite trust this romantic notion. Why not remain where one is? If it\x{2019}s my intention to perish, can it be that no suitable opportunities are available to me in this country? I should be able to find a more worthy occasion here for putting my health, strength and joie de vivre on the line. For the moment, I\x{2019}m delighted about my health and the joy of being able to move my legs and arms at will, then about my mind, which I still find quite lively, and finally about the thrilling recognition that I stand here before the world as a deeply burdened debtor who has every reason to finally take a deep breath and start working himself back into the world\x{2019}s good graces. I adore being a debtor! If I had no choice but to tell myself that humankind had insulted me, I\x{2019}d be inconsolable. Then I\x{2019}d have to withdraw into apathy, antipathy and bitterness. No, things stand quite differently, they stand brilliantly, they couldn\x{2019}t possibly stand any more brilliantly for a person just becoming a man: It is I\x{2014}I\x{2014}who have insulted the world. The world stands before me like an infuriated, offended mother: that wonderful face I\x{2019}m so in love with: the face of Mother Earth, demanding atonement! I tally up everything I\x{2019}ve neglected, squandered, dreamed away, overlooked and transgressed. I shall satisfy the one I\x{2019}ve offended, and then some day, in some beautiful, intimate evening hour, I\x{2019}ll tell my siblings all about how I managed to make things turn out in such a way that I can hold my head high. It might take years, but after all, I find a task all the more delightful the longer and more difficult the exertions it requires. Now you know me a little.\x{201d}",

            "One day Simon rang the bell rather shyly\x{2014}it was <<noon|13>>\x{2014}before an elegant house standing off on its own in a garden. The bell sounded to him as if a beggar had rung it. If he himself were sitting inside the house just now, as its owner for instance who was perhaps eating lunch, he would have turned indolently to his wife and asked: Who could be ringing the bell just now, surely a beggar! \x{201c}When you think of elegant people,\x{201d} he thought as he waited, \x{201c}you always picture them at the dinner table, or in a carriage, or getting dressed with the help of male or female servants, while you always imagine a poor man standing outside in the cold with his coat collar drawn up, as mine is now, waiting before a garden gate with a pounding heart. Poor people have, as a rule, rapid, pounding, ardent hearts, while those of the rich are cold, roomy, upholstered, well-heated, and nailed shut! Oh, if only someone would rush fleet-footed to the door, what a relief that would be. There\x{2019}s something constricting about standing and waiting at a wealthy portal. Despite my little bit of worldly experience what weak legs I am standing on.\x{201d} \x{2014}And indeed he was trembling when a girl came hurrying up to open the door for the one standing outside. Simon always had to smile when someone opened the door and invited him in, and now, too, this smile was in evidence, a smile that resembled a timid appeal and perhaps could be seen on many other faces as well.",

            "What odd fish we are, the two of us. The way we drift about this earth, it\x{2019}s as if only you and I were alive, and no one else. What a crazy sort of friendship the two of us have forged, it\x{2019}s as though among all mankind no one else could be found who might be worthy of the designation \x{201c}friend.\x{201d} We\x{2019}re not really brothers at all, we\x{2019}re just friends, two people who find themselves companions in this world. I\x{2019}m not truly made for friendship, and can\x{2019}t understand what it is about you I find so splendid that I\x{2019}m forced constantly to imagine myself at your side, pressed against your back as it were. I\x{2019}ll soon be thinking your head is my own, for you\x{2019}re so very often in my head already; and if things go on like this, perhaps I\x{2019}ll soon be seizing things with your hands, walking with your legs and eating with your mouth. Truly there is something mysterious about our friendship when I say to you I consider it quite possible that our hearts have been trying to draw apart from one another, but they\x{2019}re incapable of separating. I\x{2019}m overjoyed I have to admit that you still can\x{2019}t quite manage this, for your letters sound so nice and for the time being I also wish to remain under this mystery\x{2019}s spell. For us this is good, but how can I be speaking in such a horribly dry tone: I find it simply, not to tell a lie, enchanting. And why shouldn\x{2019}t two brothers overdo things a little? We fit together quite well\x{2014}and we did even back in the days of still hating one another when we nearly beat each other to a pulp. Do you remember? This appeal, with a dash of healthy laughter, is all that\x{2019}s needed to stir up within you, to glue together, paste, and draw pictures that are truly more than worth remembering. We had become, for reasons I can no longer recall, mortal enemies. Oh, how accomplished we were at hating\x{2014}our hatred was decidedly resourceful in inventing torments and humiliations to inflict on one another. Once at the dinner table, just to provide a single example of this lamentable and childish state of affairs, you threw a platter of sauerkraut at me, because you couldn\x{2019}t resist, saying: \x{201c}Here, catch!\x{201d} I have to tell you, at the time I was trembling with fury even if only for the fact that here was this lovely opportunity for you to insult me so cruelly, and there was nothing I could do about it. I caught the platter, but was stupid enough to savor the pain of this mortification all up and down my gullet. And do you remember how, one <<noon|13>>\x{2014}it was a quiet, a deathly quiet summer-hot Sunday afternoon mad with this deathly silence\x{2014}someone came creeping up to you in the kitchen and asked you to be friends with me again. It was an incredible feat of self-control, let me tell you, to overcome those feelings of shame and defiance to reach out to you, the very figure of an enemy inclined to scornfully reject me. I did this and to this day am grateful to myself for doing so. Whether you\x{2019}re grateful as well is a matter of the most joyous and fragrant indifference. I can only guess. Go away, I hear you trying to get a word in. Sorry, not possible. Desist! \x{2014}How many delightful hours I thereafter enjoyed in your company. All at once I found you tender, loving, considerate. I think blissful feelings of joy burned on our cheeks. We wandered, you as painter and I as observer and commentator, through the meadows on the broad mountain slopes, wading in the scent of the grass, in the wetness of cool mornings, under the heat of <<midday|13>> and with the damp, infatuated setting of the sun. The trees watched what we were doing there, and the clouds balled themselves up, no doubt in anger at possessing no power to break our newly forged love. In the evenings we would come home horribly broken, dusty, starved and exhausted, and then suddenly you went off one day. The devil knows I helped you leave, as though I\x{2019}d bound myself to do so for some sort of retainer, or as though I were in a hurry to see you depart. Certainly it was an unheard-of pleasure for me to see you setting off, for you were traveling out into the wide world. How far from wide this world is, brother.",

            "This firm was a bank that enjoyed international significance, a large building with a palatial look to it in which hundreds of young and old, male and female people were employed. They all wrote with diligent fingers, made calculations using calculating machines and also sometimes their memories, thought using their thoughts and made themselves useful with their knowledge. There were any number of young, elegant letter-writing clerks who could speak <<four to seven|10a:1>> languages. These clerks stood out from the rest of the calculating pack by virtue of their refined foreign airs. They had traveled on ocean liners, attended the theater in Paris and New York, visited tea houses in Yokohama and knew how to amuse themselves in Cairo. Now they were handling the bank\x{2019}s correspondence and waited for their salaries to increase while casting aspersions on their homeland, which they found tiny and dingy. The calculating pack consisted for the most part of older individuals who clung to their posts large and small as if to beams and stakes. All of them had long noses from years of calculations and went about in threadbare, shabby, abraded, creased and crumpled garments. But among them were a number of intelligent individuals who perhaps secretly pursued strange exotic hobbies and thus led lives that, while quiet and isolated, were nonetheless dignified. Many of the younger clerks, however, were incapable of spending their free time in refined ways; mostly they were the offspring of rural landowners, innkeepers, farmers and craftsmen, who, the moment they arrived in the city, did all they could to cultivate a refined urban air, though they never quite succeeded, and so they failed to advance beyond a certain clodhopperish coarseness. Meanwhile there were also quiet characters with delicate manners who stood out oddly amid the louts. The bank\x{2019}s director was an old quiet man whom no one ever saw. It seemed that the threads and roots of the entire monstrous enterprise lay in a tangle inside his head. As a painter thinks in colors, a musician in notes, a sculptor in stone, a baker in flour, a poet in words, and a farmer in patches of land, this man appeared to think in money. One good thought of his, thought at just the right moment, could bring in half a million in the space of half an hour. Possibly! Possibly more, possibly less, possibly nothing at all, and to be sure, this man must secretly have lost money now and then without his subordinates being any the wiser: They went off to lunch when the church-bell rang at <<noon|13>>, returned at <<two|9c:1>>, worked another four hours, went away, slept, awoke, got up for breakfast, went back into the building just like before, resumed their labors, and no one knew a thing, for no one had time to learn anything at all about these mysterious goings-on. And the morose quiet old man went on thinking in his private office. For matters pertaining to his employees he had only a weak half-smile. This smile had something poetic, exalted, plan-hatching and legislative about it. Simon often tried to imagine himself in the director\x{2019}s shoes. But this image generally vanished before his eyes, and every last concept receded from him when he thought about this: \x{201c}There is something proud and exalted about him, but also something incomprehensible and almost inhuman. Why in the world do all these people, copyists and calculators, indeed even girls in the bloom of youth, go through the selfsame entryway into the selfsame building just in order to scribble away, try out pens, calculate and wave their arms about, study and blow their noses, sharpen pencils and carry papers about in their hands? Do they do so out of pleasure or under duress, and are they conscious of performing some sensible fruitful activity? All of them come from quite different directions, some even arrive by train from distant regions, pricking up their ears to see whether they still have time to run a private errand before work: They are as patient as a herd of lambs, and when evening arrives they scatter, each on his own particular trajectory, and tomorrow they\x{2019}ll all be back again at the same time. They see one another, recognize each other by gait, voice and way of opening a door, but they have very little to do with one another. They are all alike and yet are strangers to each other, and when one of them dies or embezzles something, they puzzle about it for the space of a morning, and then things go on as before. It\x{2019}s been known to happen that in the middle of his copy-work one of them has a stroke. Does it help him that he was employed at this firm for a good fifty years? For fifty years on end he went in and out the selfsame door, employed the selfsame turns of phrase in business letters a thousand times over, went through several new suits and often felt surprised how long each pair of boots lasted. And now? Can one say this man has lived? And don\x{2019}t thousands of people live just like this? Were perhaps his children the thing that mattered most to him in life, was his wife the joy of his existence? Yes, that could be. I don\x{2019}t want to pretend to be an expert in these matters, for this would appear quite appropriate to me, given my youth. Outside it is spring, and I could spring right out the window, that\x{2019}s how painful I find this long, long not-being-allowed-to-move-one\x{2019}s-limbs. A bank is a foolish thing in springtime. How would a banking establishment look standing, say, upon a lush green meadow? Perhaps my pen would look to me like a young flower freshly sprouted from the earth. But no, I\x{2019}ve no desire to make fun. Perhaps this is all exactly as it has to be, perhaps everything has a purpose. I just can\x{2019}t make out the big picture because the view itself I see too intensely. This view is somewhat discouraging: this sky outside the windows, and in my ear this sweet singing. The white clouds are out walking in the sky, and I have to sit here writing. Why do I have an eye for the clouds? If I were a cobbler, at least I\x{2019}d be making shoes for children, men and ladies, and then all these people could go walking in the streets on spring days wearing my shoes. I would experience spring when I saw my shoes on their feet. Here I cannot feel the springtime\x{2014}the springtime is disturbing me.\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}I\x{2019}m perfectly happy things have come to an end. Do you perhaps suppose you\x{2019}re striking me a blow by sending me away\x{2014}robbing me of courage, destroying me or anything of the sort? On the contrary, I\x{2019}m being raised up and flattered, at long last I\x{2019}m being infused with new hope. I was never made to be a writing and calculating machine. I like to write, I like doing calculations and find it desirable to behave in a decorous manner towards my fellow men, I enjoy being industrious, and as long as it does my heart no injury, I passionately love to obey. I\x{2019}d also be perfectly capable of submitting to certain laws if this were important, but it\x{2019}s been some time now since such things had any importance for me here. When I found myself running late today, I merely felt angry and annoyed, I was by no means filled with honest conscientious concern, nor did I reproach myself, or if I did so, it was only for still being such a cowardly fool that I leap to my feet at the stroke of <<eight|12>> and start running like a wind-up clock that runs whenever it\x{2019}s wound. I thank you for having the energy to dismiss me and request that you think of me however you please. You are surely an admirable, commendable, great man, but, you see, I too wish to be one, and that\x{2019}s why it\x{2019}s good you\x{2019}re sending me away, why it was so advantageous for me to comport myself today in a manner one might call unseemly. In your offices, which are so highly touted and where anyone at all would be delighted to find employment, there can be no question of a young man developing and growing. I don\x{2019}t care a whit about enjoying the benefits associated with receiving a fixed monthly income. While receiving it, I degenerate, becoming addlepated and lily-livered, I ossify. You may be surprised to hear me making use of such expressions, but you must admit I am speaking the complete truth. Only one person can be a man here: you! \x{2014}Doesn\x{2019}t it ever occur to you that among your poor subordinates there might be some who feel the urge to be men themselves: effective, productive, respect-inspiring men. I can\x{2019}t possibly find it agreeable to stand off to one side in this world just to avoid acquiring a reputation as a malcontent and therefore a scarcely employable person. How great is the temptation here to feel afraid\x{2014}and how faint the appeal of extricating oneself from this miserable fear. My having set in motion this all but impossible development on this day is something I cannot help appreciating in myself, let people say what they will. You, Herr Direktor, have barricaded yourself in here, you\x{2019}re never visible, no one knows whose orders they are following, and in fact one isn\x{2019}t following orders at all but rather merely stagnating according to one\x{2019}s own bad habits, which turn out to be perfectly appropriate. What a trap for young people with a tendency to be indolent and sluggish. Here nothing is demanded of all the strength that might animate a young man\x{2019}s spirit, nothing is required that might distinguish a man and human being. Neither courage nor wit, neither loyalty nor industry, neither creative drive nor the desire for challenges can help a person to advance himself here: Indeed, displaying strength and capabilities is even looked down upon. Naturally, how could it not be looked down upon in such a slow, sluggish, dry, miserable system? Farewell, sir, I leave in order to work myself back to health, even if this means shoveling dirt or carrying endless sacks of coal on my back. I love all sorts of work, excepting the sort whose performance does not require the exertion of all one\x{2019}s faculties.\x{201d}",

            "That same morning Kaspar and Klara took a small brightly colored boat out on the lake. The lake was utterly placid, a gleaming motionless mirror. Now and then a steamer crossed before them, creating for a brief while broad gentle waves, and they sliced through these waves. Klara was clad in a snow-white dress; wide sleeves hung languidly from her beautiful arms and hands. She\x{2019}d removed her hat: Absentmindedly, with a lovely gesture, she\x{2019}d let her hair down. Her mouth was smiling across to the mouth of the young man. She didn\x{2019}t know what to say, had no wish to say anything. \x{201c}How beautiful the water is, it looks like a sky,\x{201d} she said. Her forehead was as serene as their surroundings\x{2014}lake, shore and cloudless sky. The blue of the sky had streaks of fragrant shimmering white in it. The white sullied the blue a little, seasoned it, made it more yearning and faltering and milder. The sun was half shining through, like sunshine in dreams. There was a certain hesitancy to everything, the air fluttered about their hair and faces\x{2014}Kaspar\x{2019}s face was solemn but serene. For a while he rowed with powerful strokes, then let the oars sink, and the boat bobbed on unguided. He turned around to look at the receding city, saw its towers and rooftops glittering faintly in the half-sun, saw industrious people hurrying across the bridges. Carts and wagons followed, the electrical tram jolted past making its peculiar sound. Wires were humming, whips were cracking, one could hear whistles and great resounding dins from somewhere or other. All at once the <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> bells rang out amid all the silence and distant trembling sounds. Both of them were feeling indescribable joy at this day, this morning, the sounds and colors. Everything was dissolving into perception and sound. Being lovers, they heard all things melded as a single sound. A simple bouquet lay in Klara\x{2019}s lap. Kaspar had taken off his jacket and was now rowing again. Then came the stroke of <<noon|12>>, and all these working and professional people dispersed like a trampled anthill into all the streets and directions. The white bridge was swarming with nimble black dots. And when you considered that each dot had a mouth with which it was now planning to eat lunch, you couldn\x{2019}t help bursting into laughter. What a singular image of life, the two of them felt, laughing. They now turned back as well; after all, they too were human and beginning to get hungry; and the closer they drew to shore, the larger the ants became; and then they disembarked and were dots themselves, just like the others. But they kept strolling blissfully up and down beneath the light-green trees. Many curious people turned to look at this strange pair: the woman in her long white gown whose train swept the ground and the churl of a lad who didn\x{2019}t even have on clean trousers, who stood in such insolent contrast to the lady he accompanied. Thus do people wax indignant and form false judgments about their fellow man. All at once someone came striding quickly up to Kaspar. Indeed, it was someone who had every reason to greet him in this fashion, namely Klaus, who hadn\x{2019}t seen his brother in years. Behind him came their sister and another gentleman, and now there was a general exchange of greetings. The stranger\x{2019}s name was Sebastian.",

            "Klara felt divine. Dressed in a dark-blue morning coat that flowed loosely about her body in opulent folds, she sat upon the balcony, which provided a view of fir trees whose tips bobbed gently to and fro in the light morning breeze. How glorious the forest is, she thought, leaning out toward it over the delicately worked railing to have its fragrance closer. \x{201c}How it lies there, the forest, as though already slumbering its way closer to night. When you walk into a forest during the daytime, in broad sunlight, it\x{2019}s as if you\x{2019}re walking into an evening where the sounds are piercing and fainter, the scents moist and more tender, where a person can rest and pray. In the forest you pray involuntarily, and it\x{2019}s also the only place in the world where God is near; God seems to have created forests so we can pray in them as if in sacred temples; one person prays in one way, another in another, but everyone prays. When you lie beneath a fir tree reading a book, you are praying, if praying is the same as being lost in thought. Let God be where He will, in the forest you can sense Him, and you offer up your little bit of belief with silent rapture. God doesn\x{2019}t want us to believe in Him so terribly much, He wants us to forget Him, it even makes Him happy to be scorned, for He is benevolent and great beyond all measure; God is the most pliant thing in the universe. He insists on nothing, wants nothing, requires nothing. Wanting things might be something for us humans, but not for Him. Nothing is for Him. He is happy when people pray to Him. Oh, this God is enraptured and cannot contain His bliss when I go and thank Him, thank Him only just a little. Even if my thanks are superficial, God is so grateful. I\x{2019}d like to know who could be more grateful than He. He has given us everything, He\x{2019}s so incautious and kind, and the way things are with Him, He cannot help being happy when the beings He\x{2019}s created think of him a little. This is the unique thing about our God, that He wants to be God only when it pleases us to elevate Him as our God. Who teaches humility better than He does? Who is more prescient and still? Perhaps God merely has inklings of us, as we do of Him, and all I\x{2019}m doing, just now for instance, is giving voice to my own inklings. Does He also sense that I\x{2019}m sitting here on the balcony, admiring His splendid forest? If only He knew how beautiful His forest is. But I think God has forgotten His Creation, not out of bitterness\x{2014}how could He be capable of bitterness\x{2014}no, He\x{2019}s simply forgotten, or at least it looks as if He\x{2019}s forgotten us. You can feel many different things about God\x{2014}He permits all sorts of thoughts. But when you think of Him, you can easily lose Him: that\x{2019}s why we pray. Great God, lead us not into temptation: That\x{2019}s how I prayed as a child, lying in my little bed, and I always felt pleased with myself when I prayed. How happy I feel today, how glad; my entire being is a smile, a blissful smile. My whole heart is smiling, the air is so fresh, I think it must be Sunday, people will come from the city to go walking in the forest, and I shall pick out some child, ask the parents to entrust it to me for a little while and then we\x{2019}ll play. How I can just sit here like this, feeling joy at my very existence, at my sitting here and leaning over the railing! How beautiful I find myself\x{2014}I could almost forget Kaspar, forget everything. How could I possibly ever have cried over anything, felt perturbed over anything? How imperturbable the forest is, and yet also so flexible, warm, alive and sweet. What a respiration comes from the fir trees, what rustling! The rustling of the trees makes all music superfluous. Indeed, I like to hear music only at night, never in the morning, the morning is too sacred. How strangely refreshed I feel. How mysterious it is to lie down to sleep, no, first to be tired and then lie down, and then wake up again and feel newborn. Every day is our birthday. It\x{2019}s like getting into the bath when one climbs out of the veils of nighttime into the waves of the blue day. Now the blaze of <<noon|13>> will soon come, until the sun longingly sinks down again. What longing, what a miracle from eve to morn, from <<noon|13>> to eve, from night to morn again. We\x{2019}d find everything miraculous if we were sensible of it all, for how could one thing be miraculous and another not? I think I must have been ill yesterday and no one\x{2019}s telling me. How beautiful and innocent my hands look still. If they had eyes, I\x{2019}d hold up a mirror to show them how beautiful they are. How fortunate any man is whom I caress with my hands. What peculiar thoughts I\x{2019}m having. If Kaspar were to come now, I\x{2019}d have to weep at letting him see me like this. I haven\x{2019}t been thinking about him, and he\x{2019}d sense I hadn\x{2019}t given him a thought. All at once I feel so wretched\x{2014}the thought that I\x{2019}ve neglected him. But am I his slave? What is he to me?\x{201d}",

            "The next morning Simon stepped out of the house wearing a short, dark blue coat, with a delicate, useless little stick in his hand. A thick heavy fog received him, and it was still blackest night. An hour later, though, the sky began to lighten as he stood on a hilltop gazing back at the metropolis beneath him. It was cold, but the sun rising fiery-red above the snowy bushes and fields promised a glorious day. He remained transfixed by the sight of this red ball that kept soaring higher and higher and said to himself that the sun in winter was three times again as beautiful as a midsummer sun. The snow was soon blazing with this peculiarly bright-red warm hue, and this warming sight and the actual frostiness of the air all around had an invigorating, stimulating effect on the wanderer, who, not allowing himself to be delayed any longer, went striding stalwartly on. The path was the same one Simon had taken that night in autumn; he practically could have found it in his sleep by now. In this way he walked all day long. At <<midday|13>>, the sun poured beautiful warmth down on the region, the snow was on the verge of melting again, and there were bits of green peeping out damply in several spots. The trickling streams reinforced the impression of warmth, but toward evening, as the sky showed itself resplendently dark blue and the sun\x{2019}s red rays were vanishing over the mountain ridge, it at once turned bitter cold again. Simon was once more ascending the mountain he\x{2019}d climbed before, that autumn night, though in more frantic haste; the snow crunched beneath his footsteps. Heavily laden with snow, the fir trees\x{2019} thick branches arched down splendidly to the earth. When he was approximately halfway to the top, Simon suddenly saw a young man lying in the snow in the middle of the path. There was still enough last light in the forest that he could observe the sleeper well. What had possessed this man to lie down here in the bitter cold, in such a secluded part of the forest? The man\x{2019}s broad hat lay across his face, just as one often sees on a hot, shadeless summer day, when a person lying down to rest will shield himself from the sun\x{2019}s rays to be able to fall asleep. There was something unsettling about this covered face in the middle of winter, a season when it could hardly be considered pleasurable to settle down for a rest in the snow. The man lay there motionless, and already it was beginning to get darker in the forest. Simon studied the man\x{2019}s legs, shoes, clothes. His outfit was pale yellow, it was a summer suit, a quite thin, threadbare one. Simon took the hat from the man\x{2019}s face, it was rigid and looked terrifying, and now all at once he recognized this face, it was Sebastian\x{2019}s face, no two ways about it\x{2014}these were Sebastian\x{2019}s features, this was his mouth, his beard, his rather broad flat nose, his eyes and eyebrows, his forehead and hair. And he\x{2019}d frozen to death here, without a doubt, and he must have been lying here on the path for a while. The snow displayed no footprints; it was conceivable he\x{2019}d been here for a considerable length of time. His face and hands had long since turned rigid, and the clothes were stuck to his frozen torso. Sebastian must have sunk to the ground here with an immense, no longer endurable weariness. He\x{2019}d never been particularly robust. He always stooped over, as though he couldn\x{2019}t bear to walk upright, as though it caused him pain to hold his back and head straight. Looking at him, one couldn\x{2019}t help feeling he hadn\x{2019}t been strong enough for life and its cold demands. Simon cut some branches from a fir tree and covered the body with them, but first he drew a small, thin notebook from the dead man\x{2019}s jacket pocket where it had been sticking out. It appeared to contain poems, though Simon could no longer make out the letters. Night had fallen. Stars were sparkling through the gaps between the fir trees, and the moon, a fine delicate hoop, observed the scene: \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t have time,\x{201d} Simon said silently to himself, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve got to hurry to reach the next town, otherwise it wouldn\x{2019}t frighten me at all to spend a bit more time with this poor devil of a dead man, a poet and dreamer. How noble a grave he chose for himself. His resting place lies amid splendid green snow-covered firs. I shall not report this to anyone. Nature gazes down upon her dead man, the stars are quietly singing at his head, and the night birds are squawking\x{2014}this is the best music for a person who no longer feels or hears. Your poems, dear Sebastian, I shall bring to a publisher, where they will perhaps be read and consigned to print, so that at least your poor, sparkling, melodious name will remain to the world. What splendid peace: reposing and growing stiff beneath fir branches in the snow. You couldn\x{2019}t have chosen anything better. People tend to inflict harm on the eccentric\x{2014}and this is what you were\x{2014}and then laugh at their pain. Give my greetings to the dear, silent dead beneath the earth and don\x{2019}t get too badly scorched in the eternal fires of nonexistence. You are elsewhere. Surely you\x{2019}re somewhere splendid, you\x{2019}re a rich fellow now, and publishing the poems of a rich elegant fellow is certainly worthwhile. Farewell. If I had flowers, I\x{2019}d strew them over you. For a poet one never has flowers enough. You had too few. You were expecting some, but you never heard the flutter of their petals above you, nor did they alight upon your shoulders as you dreamed they might. I too am a dreamer, you see, as are many, many people you\x{2019}d never suspect, but you believed dreaming to be your prerogative, whereas the rest of us dream only when we fancy ourselves utterly miserable, and are happy to be able to stop at will. You despised your fellow creatures, Sebastian! But this, my dear man, is something only a strong individual may allow himself, and you were weak! But now that I have found your hallowed grave, let me not heap scorn upon it. I cannot know what you have suffered. Your death beneath the open stars is beautiful, I shall not soon forget it. I shall tell Hedwig of your grave beneath these noble firs and make her weep with my description. At least people will still be able to read your poems, even if they didn\x{2019}t have much use for you before.\x{201d} \x{2014}Simon strode away from the dead man, casting one last glance back at the little pile of fir branches beneath which the poet now slept, then turning away from this image with a rapid twist of his supple body, he hastened further up the mountain, moving as fast as he could in the snow. And so he was having to ascend this mountain at night for a second time, but this time life and death were shooting through his entire body in feverish shudderings. In this icy, star-resplendent night he felt like crying out exultantly. The fire of life bore him tempestuously away from that gentle, pale image of death. He no longer felt any legs, just veins and tendons, and these pliantly obeyed his forward-striding will. High up on the open mountain meadow he had his first full, sublime view of the glorious night and laughed out loud, like a boy who\x{2019}s never seen a dead man before. What was a dead man? What else but a reminder to live. This and nothing more. A delightful memory calling one back, and at the same time a being-driven-on into the uncertain, lovely future. If he was able to face the dead so calmly, Simon felt that his future must still be spread out broad and wide before him. He was overjoyed that he\x{2019}d been able to see this poor, unhappy person one last time and that he\x{2019}d found him in so mysterious a guise, so silent, so eloquent, so dark and peaceful and so graciously at an end. Now, praise God, there was nothing remaining about this poet that you could smile or turn up your nose at, just something you could feel.\x{2014}Simon slept splendidly in his bed at an inn, the very same inn whose ballroom had been painted by his brother. He used the following day for more walking on grueling roads full of snow. He beheld always a blue sky above him, houses to either side of the road\x{2014}beautiful large homes that led one to assume the rural population here was prosperous and proud, hills covered with black, bedraggled trees into which the blue sky was creeping, and people who walked past him and others who were walking in his direction but who were soon overtaken, for he was striding along while the others were comfortably strolling. When night fell, he was walking through a silent, narrow, strange valley entirely encircled by forest and filled with twists and turns and odd glimpses of high-up villages where the evening lights were burning and very few people could be seen out-of-doors. But as he was now starting to be tormented by serious exhaustion, he stopped at the next inn. The pub downstairs was filled with people, and the innkeeper\x{2019}s wife looked more like an elegant lady of good lineage than a waitress with the duty of serving patrons. He shyly made his wishes known, whereupon the beautiful woman looked him up and down strangely. But he was so weary, so worn-out that he felt only pleasure when, a short while later, he was led to his room, where he blissfully lay down in an ice-cold bed and at once fell asleep. The third day brought him to a vast, beautiful city where he had only one piece of business: finding an editor to whom he could entrust Sebastian\x{2019}s poems. When he\x{2019}d reached the building that had been described to him, he realized it would be incautious to go in himself and present the poems of a man who\x{2019}d been found dead. And so he inscribed the cover of the blue notebook with the title: \x{201c}The Poems of a Young Man Found Frozen to Death in the Fir Forest, for Publication If Possible,\x{201d} and he dropped the notebook into the big, stocky mailbox with a loud clunk. Having accomplished this, Simon took himself off again. The weather had grown milder, snow was spiraling in large wet flakes down upon the roads now drawing him on. The people in this city, which he didn\x{2019}t know at all, looked at him with such odd expressions of surprise that he almost couldn\x{2019}t help imagining they knew him, a perfect stranger. Soon he\x{2019}d left the actual city behind and was walking through an elegant villa district, then he abandoned this too and passed through a forest, a field, another field, then a smaller forest, then a village, then a second and a third, until night fell.",

            "It was early spring. Already you could leave windows standing open with less hesitation, and the stoves scarcely needed stoking. The children brought Hedwig entire bouquets of snowdrops, so that soon they were at a loss what to do with them all, as there weren\x{2019}t enough small containers in the schoolroom. The air in the village was heady with the first fragrant hints of spring. People were already taking walks in the sunshine. Imperceptibly, as if in passing, Simon had become known among these simple folk, no one asked many questions about who he was, people said he was one of the teacher\x{2019}s brothers, and this was enough here to gain him respect. He\x{2019}d be staying a little while, as a visitor, they thought. Simon walked around looking fairly tattered, but with a certain offhand elegance that became him and attractively concealed the squalor of the fabrics he wore. His torn shoes didn\x{2019}t attract much notice. Simon found it enchanting to walk about the countryside in faulty shoes; he felt this to be one of the greatest advantages of country living. If he were to get some money, he might begin to consider whether to have his footwear set to rights, but these would be only the faintest, most unhurried deliberations. Perhaps he\x{2019}d hesitate for a fortnight first; for what is a fortnight in the country? Back in the city you always had to do everything right away, but here you had the lovely obligation to defer everything from one day to the next, indeed, things deferred themselves of their own accord; for the days arrived so softly, and before you could even think about it, it would be evening already, followed by a fervent night, a veritable slumber of a night, which was then quietly woken again by the day, woken gently and with tenderness. Simon also loved the more often than not muddy village roads, the narrow ones that led you over hillocks of debris, and the wide ones where you sank into the muck if you didn\x{2019}t watch your step. But that was what he liked about it! Walking on these roads gave you the opportunity to watch your step, you could show off as a city slicker who was accustomed to picking his way with great attentiveness and a slightly trumped-up look of horror when presented with mud. The old farmwives could then think to themselves what a tidy, cautious young man he was, and the girls could laugh at the great leaps Simon executed to avoid the moats and puddles. The sky was frequently encircled with clouds, dark puffy fat clouds, and delightful storms were often blowing, agitating the forest and hurtling across the moss where people were at work cutting sod, their horses patiently standing by. Oftentimes too the sky would be smiling so that all who saw it were instantly compelled to smile as well. Hedwig\x{2019}s face would take on a joyous expression, and the teacher who lived on the upper floor would poke his glasses inquisitively out the window, in his way enjoying the exquisite treat of this balmy sky. Simon had gone into a little shop to buy himself an inexpensive pipe and some tobacco. It appeared to him beautiful and fitting to smoke only pipes in the country, for a pipe could be filled, and filling the pipe was a gesture that accorded well with the open fields and the forest where he spent almost the entire livelong day. In the warm <<midday|13>> sun, he would lie in the pale yellow grass beneath the splendidly gentle sky, stretched out on the riverbank, and was not merely allowed to dream, he was compelled to. But he didn\x{2019}t dream of far-off, distant, beauteous things but rather contented himself with contemplations and daydreams pertaining to his immediate surroundings; for he knew nothing more beautiful. Hedwig, the one closest to him, was the object of his dreams. He had forgotten the entire rest of the world, and the pipe tobacco he was smoking only served to bring him back to the village, the schoolhouse, Hedwig. Of her he imagined:",

            "Simon brought his letter to the post office. The following Sunday, Klaus came to visit, the older brother. It was drizzling, and the sight of the cold raindrops slapping the already wide-awake blossoms was enough to give you the shivers. Klaus looked not a little astonished to discover Simon living with his sister\x{2014}he\x{2019}d assumed he was abroad somewhere\x{2014}but he remained as amicable as he was able, not wishing to spoil their Sunday. All three of them remained rather quiet, often standing there <<before one|9b>> another without speaking; they appeared to be hunting for words. Klaus brought a certain contemplative alienation to Hedwig\x{2019}s home. Upon closer examination, all sorts of things here proved, in fact, to be out of place. The main object, of course, being Simon\x{2019}s presence. Klaus was determined not to utter any reproaches today, though in truth he felt sorely tempted; but he avoided all divisive remarks. He gazed at his brother questioningly and significantly, as though to say: \x{201c}I am astonished at your behavior. How can you be considered an adult? Is it honorable to take advantage of your sister\x{2019}s position to live in idleness? It\x{2019}s truly dishonorable! I\x{2019}d be saying this to you quite openly, but I wish to spare Hedwig, who would be hurt by such remarks. Far be it from me to spoil our Sunday!\x{201d} Simon understood nonetheless. He knew quite well what was meant by this expression, this stiff unnatural warmth as they greeted one another, this silence and discomfiture. He was just glad Klaus held his tongue; for otherwise he\x{2019}d have to respond with something he was already finding abhorrent as a justification. Certainly, certainly! His position was deplorable for a young man like him, there was no excuse for his behavior. But it was so lovely to be here\x{2014}lovely, lovely! Gripped suddenly by emotion, he said to Klaus: \x{201c}I know perfectly well what you think of me, but I swear to you this will end soon. I think you know me a little. Do you believe me?\x{201d} Klaus pressed his hand, and their Sunday was saved. Soon it was time for lunch, and Hedwig no doubt noted with a secret smile the changed situation between the brothers. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s a good man, Klaus. Klaus is good,\x{201d} she thought, and with even greater pleasure served the delicious meal. There was a splendid soup, in whose exquisite preparation Hedwig was highly skilled, followed by pork with sauerkraut and finally a roast rich with fat. Simon chatted unrestrainedly about heaven and earth, drawing his brother into all sorts of conversations and then returning again and again to praise the splendid meal with such comical enthusiasm that each time Hedwig burst out laughing until she was filled with good cheer and forgot everything that might have been considered worrisome. In the afternoon, the dismal weather notwithstanding, they took a short walk. The field through which they trudged was so wet they soon turned back again. All of them that evening were quiet once more. Simon tried to read a newspaper, Klaus spoke as if intentionally about the most trivial matters, with Hedwig replying distractedly. Before he took his leave, Klaus said a few words to the girl, whom he\x{2019}d summoned to the kitchen, words on which the one standing in the other room preferred not to eavesdrop. What could it be. Let it be whatever it was. Then Klaus departed. When they both\x{2014}having accompanied their guest on the first leg of his return journey\x{2014}were back at home again, just the two of them, their hearts involuntarily felt gayer, like schoolchildren after the stern inspector has left. They breathed more freely, feeling they could be themselves again. Hedwig now began to speak, and the apprehensiveness inspired by what she was about to say made her voice sound more intimate and raised its pitch: \x{201c}Klaus is just the same as ever. There\x{2019}s always a tiny bit of fear to contend with in his presence. Being with him involuntarily turns a person into a guilty schoolgirl awaiting her scolding for having been imprudent. In his eyes, you\x{2019}ve always been imprudent, even when you think you\x{2019}ve been acting in a serious way. His eyes see things so differently\x{2014}they look at the world in such a strangely alarming manner, as if there\x{2019}s always something to fear. He\x{2019}s constantly worrying both himself and others. That tone issuing from his mouth is assembled out of a thousand well-intentioned misgivings\x{2014}he has so little trust in the world and the threads that bind us to it of their own accord. He looks as if he wants to lecture you like a schoolmaster and at the same time sees perfectly clearly that he is lecturing unawares\x{2014}he doesn\x{2019}t wish to lecture, but that\x{2019}s just what he does, despite his best intentions, because of his innermost nature, for which we can\x{2019}t hold him responsible. He is so unquestionably kind and affectionate, but he cannot stop questioning whether it\x{2019}s appropriate to be gentle and kind. Severity ill becomes him, and yet he believes he can accomplish with severity what he\x{2019}s failed to achieve by means of kindness. He thinks of kindness as incautious, and yet he\x{2019}s so very kind! He forbids himself to be artless and kind, which is what he\x{2019}d most dearly love to be, because he\x{2019}s so afraid of spoiling something in this way, and then appearing imprudent in the eyes of the world. He sees only eyes observing him, never eyes wishing to gaze peacefully into his. You can\x{2019}t gaze peacefully into his eyes, since it\x{2019}s quite palpable how nervous this makes him. He always thinks people are thinking something about him and he needs to get to the bottom of those thoughts. If he can\x{2019}t find anything wrong with you to carp about, he seems ill at ease. And yet he is kind! Happy he is not. If he were, he\x{2019}d start speaking differently in a instant, I know he would. And it isn\x{2019}t that he begrudges others their happiness, but he\x{2019}s constantly inclined to criticize the happiness and carefree spirits of those around him, which I\x{2019}m sure must cause him pain. He doesn\x{2019}t like to hear talk of happiness, and I can understand why. It\x{2019}s quite obvious, any child can understand it: Yourself joyless, you hate the joy of others. How often this must pain him, for he\x{2019}s noble enough to feel what injustices he\x{2019}s committing. He is absolutely noble, but\x{2014}how shall I say this\x{2014}also a bit corrupted on the inside, just a tiny bit, because of having been neglected and then always struggling to shrug off this neglect. Yes, fate has most certainly given him the cold shoulder\x{2014}he\x{2019}s far too worthy for its frostiness and whims. That\x{2019}s how I\x{2019}d like to put it; for I feel pain on his account! You, for instance, Simon. My God. For you one feels quite different things, my eternally jolly brother! Do you know, thinking of you, one always says to oneself: He ought to get a beating, a really sound beating, that\x{2019}s what he deserves! You make a person feel astonished with wonder\x{2014}why haven\x{2019}t you yet plunged into an abyss? It would never occur to anyone to feel pity for you. Generally people consider you a carefree, impudent, happy fellow. Is it true?\x{201d}",
