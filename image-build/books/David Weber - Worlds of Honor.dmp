            "What was true for them was twice as true for their kids, however. There simply weren\x{2019}t many children on Unicorn Eleven, and that was one area in which the invention of the prolong anti-aging treatments didn\x{2019}t help a lot, either. Prolong was tending to erase a lot of the age-based divisions which had always been humankind\x{2019}s lot, which would probably be a good thing once civilization fully adjusted to the consequences. Of course, first they\x{2019}d have to have prolong long enough to figure out what all those consequences were, Ranjit supposed. It had been available in the Star Kingdom for only sixty-four years. To someone his age, that seemed like forever, but it was less than an eye-blink in terms of a culture\x{2019}s adjustment to so monumental a change. One immediate effect was readily apparent, however: people were waiting considerably longer, on average, to have children. His own parents had rushed things more than many of their contemporaries in that regard, because both of them loved children and they\x{2019}d wanted to get started early, but that was increasingly rare. Which meant that, despite a total population on the order of eight thousand, there were less than three hundred kids on Unicorn Eleven, and those who were present tended to be the children of the senior personnel and so, on average, older themselves. At seventeen, Ranjit himself was below the median age of the children aboard the station, whereas Susan, at <<twelve|9e>>, was actually the youngest one of all.",

            "It had to be something genetic, Ranjit mused. Some previously unsuspected mutation which had been nurtured by the Star Kingdom\x{2019}s ongoing military buildup against the People\x{2019}s Republic of Haven. Certainly no one else in the family had ever been especially interested in a military career, and if Susan simply had to be bitten by the military bug, why couldn\x{2019}t she at least have decided she hungered for the Navy? The Marines, even more than the Royal Army, were one of the areas of military service in which size and physical strength still mattered, and Susan was never going to be a big woman. Kalindi Hibson was wiry and muscular, but he also stood just under a hundred and sixty-three centimeters tall. Ranjit, who favored their mother\x{2019}s side of the family more than Susan did, was already over one-eighty, but Susan took very much after her father when it came to size and bulk, and he doubted she would ever break <<one-fifty-five|5k:1>>. Yet where Ranjit had no particular desire to embrace the rigors of a military lifestyle-especially not if, as the alarmists insisted was likely in light of the Peeps\x{2019} expansion in the Star Kingdom\x{2019}s direction, he might also someday get to enjoy the experience of having ill-intentioned strangers actually shooting at him-and found the very thought of boot camp revolting, Susan actually looked forward to the experience.",
