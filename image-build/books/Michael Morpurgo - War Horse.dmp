            "AUTHOR\x{2019}S NOTE
IN THE OLD school they use now for the Village Hall, below the clock that has stood always at <<one minute past ten|10>>, hangs a small dusty painting of a horse. He stands, a splendid red bay with a remarkable white cross emblazoned on his forehead and with four perfectly matched white socks. He looks wistfully out of the picture, his ears pricked forward, his head turned as if he has just noticed us standing there.",

            "One hot summer evening, after a long and dusty day in the fields, I was deep into my mash and oats, with Albert still rubbing me down with straw and talking on about the abundance of good straw they\x{2019}d have for the winter months, and about how good the wheat straw would be for the thatching they would be doing, when I heard his father\x{2019}s heavy steps coming across the yard  towards us. He was calling out as he came. \x{2018}Mother,\x{2019} he shouted. \x{2018}Mother, come out Mother.\x{2019} It was his sane voice, his sober voice and was a voice that held no fear for me. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s war, Mother. I\x{2019}ve just heard it in the village. Postman came in this afternoon with the news. The devils have marched into Belgium. It\x{2019}s certain for sure now. We declared war yesterday at <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>>. We\x{2019}re at war with the Germans. We\x{2019}ll give them such a hiding as they won\x{2019}t ever raise their fists again to anyone. Be over in a few months. It\x{2019}s always been the same. Just because the British lion\x{2019}s sleeping they think he\x{2019}s dead. We\x{2019}ll teach them a thing or two, Mother \x{2013} we\x{2019}ll teach them a lesson they\x{2019}ll never forget.\x{2019}",

            'CHAPTER 14
SO FRIEDRICH RODE with us that autumn day when we went to war again. The gun troop was resting at <<midday|13>> under the welcome shade of a large chestnut wood that covered both banks of a silver glinting river that was full of splashing, laughing men. As we moved in amongst the trees and the guns were unhitched, I saw that the entire wood was crowded with resting soldiers, their helmets, packs and rifles lying beside them. They sat back against the trees smoking, or lay out flat on their backs and slept.',

            "When the end of the war did come, it came swiftly, almost unexpectedly it seemed to the men around me. There was little joy, little celebration of victory, only a sense of profound relief that at last it was finished and done with. Albert left the happy cluster of men gathered together in the yard that cold November morning and strolled over to talk to me. \x{2018}Five minutes time and it\x{2019}ll be finished, Joey, all over. Jerry\x{2019}s had about enough of it, and so have we. No one really wants to go on any more. At <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>> the guns will stop and then that will be that. Only wish that David could have been here to see it.\x{2019}",

            "Morning parade took place as usual every morning in the centre of the cobbled yard, followed by Major  Martin\x{2019}s inspection of the horses and stables. But one dreary, drizzling morning, with the wet cobbles shining grey in the early morning light, Major Martin did not inspect the stables as usual. Sergeant Thunder stood the men at ease and Major Martin announced the re-embarkation plans for the unit. He was finishing his short speech; \x{2018}So we shall be at Victoria station by <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> on Saturday evening \x{2013} with any luck. Chances are you\x{2019}ll all be home by Christmas.\x{2019}",

            "I was clearly much in demand for the bidding was swift to start with, but as the price rose I could see more heads shaking and very soon there seemed to be only two bidders left. One was old Thunder himself, who would touch the corner of his cap with his stick, almost like a salute, to make his bid; and the other was a thin, wiry little man with weasel eyes who wore on his face a smile so full of consummate greed and evil that I could hardly bear to look at him. Still the price moved up. \x{2018}At <<twenty-five|9e:0>>, twenty-six. At <<twenty-seven|9:0>>. Twenty-seven I\x{2019}m bid. On my right. Twenty-seven I\x{2019}m bid. Any more please? It\x{2019}s against the sergeant there, at <<twenty-seven|9:0>>. Any more please? He\x{2019}s a fine young animal, as you see. Got to be worth a lot more than this. Any more please?\x{2019} But the sergeant was shaking his head now, his eyes looked down and acknowledged defeat.",
