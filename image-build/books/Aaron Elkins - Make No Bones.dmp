 Esteemed Fellow Body-Snatchers:

 June <<16-22|5a:0>>, the week of our eagerly anticipated bone bash and weenie roast, is fast approaching. As this year\x{2019}s host I hereby bid you a genial welcome.

 Fittingly enough, this year\x{2019}s enlightenment and jollification will be held where it all started: the decaying but still scenic Whitebark Lodge\x{2026}",
