            'Hubert woke early, with a sharp ache above his left eye, where a number of oppressive thoughts seemed to have gathered and knotted. His pyjamas were twisted and damp with sweat. Social life, though it had its importance, often left him confused and even physically out of sorts. The rain on the roof had got him off to sleep, and then woken him again to his own heat. He had a muddled apprehension of people moving about, his mother had restless nights, and now, as he dozed and woke again, his worries about her wove their way through his uneasy recall of moments at dinner and afterwards. Then the sun rose with merciless brilliance. Like Cecil Valance, Hubert hated to waste time, but unlike Cecil he was sometimes at a loss to know quite what to do with it. He decided he must go to early Communion, and leave the rest of the party to go to <<Matins|13>> without him. Twenty minutes later he closed the front gate and set off down the hill with an air of sulky rectitude. It had turned into a fresh, still morning; the great vale of northern Middlesex lay before him, with the answering heights of Muswell Hill rising mistily beyond, but he searched in vain for his usual sober pleasure in belonging here.',

After that, and a further helpless three minutes of gaping sleep, she found she had attuned to something, to the loss of something she was amazed to find she had already grown used to, the noise of Cecil in the house. Of course he had gone! There was a thinness in the air that told her, in the tone of the morning, the texture of the servants\x{2019} movements and fragments of talk. And all her plans for him were thwarted, the witty thing she was going to say to him, as he climbed into Horner\x{2019}s van . . . It would be weeks, perhaps months, before she saw him again. Moaning with a lover\x{2019}s pangs, as well as with a certain sulky relief at this tragic postponement, she thrust herself out of bed, and on to her instantly tender right foot.",

            "She talked for a while determinedly to Flo, whom she liked very much, about the forthcoming fair at Fernham, and an exhibition that Mark was having in London, but with a slight sense she was turning her back on other responsibilities. She glanced round: it was all right, Corinna was being charming to the Colonel, Wilfie was discussing the miners\x{2019} strike with George and Sebby Stokes. She introduced Flo to her mother, and they quickly got on to the Ring; Flo had been last year to Bayreuth, and Daphne watched her mother warm to the unexpected pleasure of the subject. \x{2018}I wish you could meet my dear friend Mrs Kalbeck,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}she\x{2019}s just upstairs! We went to Bayreuth together before the War.\x{2019} In a moment they were naming singers, Freda doubting them as soon as she said them. \x{2018}We had the great thrill of meeting Madame Schumann-Heink,\x{2019} she said, \x{2018}who sang one of the Norns, I think it was.\x{2019}At which point they all heard a quiet but momentous arpeggio from the piano across the room. And following, but with the accidental quality still of a rehearsal, the maddening little tune that Daphne had been pretending for days to greatly admire. \x{2018}Oh, no . . . !\x{2019} said Dudley, crisply but gaily, like a good sport, over the general noise of the talk. There was an amused, half-distracted turning of heads. Wilfie had gone to stand beside the piano, with his back to the room, tellingly like a child being punished. Madeleine and George, whose special treat this was, stood close by, with the look almost of parents who have sent their own child up on to the stage; but the others had no idea of the plans and promises coming inexorably into play. Louisa had put on a comical sour face, shaking her head, and telling Colonel Fountain in his good ear about how sensitive Sir Edwin was to music. The talk regained confidence, with a certain sense of relief. For forty years, after all, the piano had been untouched, disguised beneath a long-fringed velour shawl, a sturdy platform for all manner of useful or decorative objects, and if anyone after dinner had uncovered the keys and facetiously picked out a phrase the noise that came forth, from under the heaped-up folios and potted plants and the arena of framed photographs, was so jangled by time and neglect as to discourage any further idea of music. Now, however, Corinna was playing the start of the piece, the misleadingly peaceful prologue . . . \x{2018}Not tonight, old girl,\x{2019} called Dudley from across the room, still humorously, but emphatically, and expecting to be understood \x{2013} he gave Mark a matey grin. Wilfrid had cleared a little space in front of the piano, asking people in the preoccupied way of some official or commissionaire to stand back. There was a moment of silence, in which it seemed their father\x{2019}s order had been understood, but which Corinna, with a touch of self-righteousness, took as proper expectancy for their performance, and pitched vigorously into \x{2018}The Happy Wallaby\x{2019}. <<After three|9:0>> bars, Wilfrid, with a look of selfless submission to order and fate, took the first few steps of his dance, which of course involved crouching and then jumping as far forward as he could. The guests shifted back, shielding their drinks, with little cries of friendly alarm, some clearly thinking this shouldn\x{2019}t be allowed to happen. Stinker carried on talking loudly as if he hadn\x{2019}t noticed \x{2013} \x{2018}One awfully clever thing he said was . . .\x{2019} \x{2013} but Dudley had put down his drink and stomped across the room, his face already square and staring with ungovernable emotion.

            "Then for twenty minutes the world belonged to the birds. Thickly in the woods, and out on the High Ground, all through the gardens, on benches and bushes, and high up here among the roofs and chimneys, finches and thrushes, starlings and blackbirds were singing their songs to the daybreak all at once. Wilfrid opened his eyes, and in the greyish light he saw his sister, sitting up in bed, peering at her book. With a cautious turn of the head and a little steady concentration he worked out that it was <<half past six|10>>. There was something strange on the bedside table, that held his attention for a minute, with its shadowy glimmer, but he didn\x{2019}t want to think about it. It made no sense, like a window where no window could ever be. He let his eyes close. The birdsong was so loud that after it had woken you it drove you back to sleep. Then, when you woke again, it was really day, and the birds by now were further off and much less important. You forgot all about them. He saw the door was half-open: Corinna had already gone to wash and he needed to ask her one or two things about the night, about the noises and music and coming and going that were tangled up with it like dreams. He turned over and there on the mantelpiece, propped up by the Toby jug, was Uncle Revel\x{2019}s flamingo, standing on one leg, and giving him a crafty smile. A bit of the dream had stayed in the solid world, as a proof or a promise, and he slipped out of bed and took it down. Uncle Revel had been here, with his mother, laughing and joking, and he had done a drawing, very quickly, like a magic trick. Wilfrid took the drawing back to bed with him \x{2013} of course the strange thing on the table, misleading him before with its magic gleam, was his mother\x{2019}s wineglass, with the last bit of dark red wine still in it, and bits of black rust in the wine. He peered into the glass, and confusingly the sour smell was the smell of his mother\x{2019}s latest kisses. He heard Nanny in her bedroom next door, the worrying creak of her floorboards, rattle of curtain-rings. She was talking to someone, it sounded like the maid Sarah. They came on to the landing. \x{2018}Another of their wild nights,\x{2019} Nanny was saying. \x{2018}God knows what they\x{2019}ll be like this morning.\x{2019} Sarah groaned and laughed. \x{2018}Duffel up here at god knows what time, with her young artist friend, to have a look at the little ones sleeping, she said.

Still, the small muscular contractions of pleasure and politeness remained almost unconsciously on his face as he swung and scuffed along the lane. He smiled at the view over the hedge, at the other front gardens, at the approaching Rover and then its driver, squinting in a rictus of his own against the evening sun, and making Paul feel again like an intruder, or now perhaps an absconder. The sun was still hot on his back. Among the trees the church clock chimed the quarter-hour once more \x{2013} he checked his watch: 7.15 of course; the hour just gone had taken about twenty minutes, and some compensating sense made him wonder if it shouldn\x{2019}t in fact be <<8.15|5a:1>>. Here he was in Church Walk. Here was the marketplace. He had never really touched spirits before, and the second gin-and-tonic, as wildly drinkable as the first, had brought him to a state of grinning elation just touched by notes of worry and confusion. He\x{2019}d been talking and telling himself not to talk, things he normally avoided saying, about his father\x{2019}s plane being shot down, and his mother\x{2019}s illness, and even his exploits at school, things that must have made him sound childish and simple. But no one had seemed to mind. Now he wondered if Mr Keeping, who said very little, hadn\x{2019}t thought him a fool \x{2013} it was actually rather creepy of him to get Paul drunk and just sit there watching, with his unnerving smile. He imagined some sarcasm about it, in the office tomorrow. On the other hand, he felt he\x{2019}d been quite a success with old Daphne Jacobs, who seemed grateful for a new listener, and he\x{2019}d laughed and winced sympathetically at her stories without necessarily following them. He often found, when he concentrated really hard on what someone was saying, that nothing much went in. The intoxication was partly that of being in the home of people who knew writers, in this case quite famous ones. He was barely aware of Dudley Valance, but he quoted whole verses of Cecil Valance\x{2019}s to the old lady, who smiled indulgently and then began to look slightly impatient.

In Vale Street he looked through the windows of the International Stores, closed and shadowy.

The classrooms at Corley Court occupied six rooms on the ground floor, but the room with the piano was isolated, with the sick-bay, in the rambling far end of the floor above. Boys with temperatures or infectious diseases were harassed through the wall by ragged bursts of folksong or the torturous practice of scales. He passed the Headmaster\x{2019}s sitting-room, which must once have been a principal bedroom of the house: its high Gothic oriel looked out down the axis of the formal gardens, which now survived only in photographs but had once been a dazzling floral maze.

Someone called Mr Young, a \x{2018}manipulative therapist\x{2019}, could visit between <<10.45|5a:1>> and 3 in north-west London only. Paul felt he would be rather intimidated by Mr Young, even if he managed to be in the area at the specified time. His eye worked through the tiny type of \x{2018}For Sale and Wanted\x{2019}, the ads all looking alike, so that you could lose one and find it again with a slightly magical sense of significance. Mainly it was magazines and films. There were hysterical pleas: \x{2018}Stills, Photos, Articles, Magazines, ANYTHING dealing with Cliff Richard\x{2019}. An unnamed \x{2018}studio\x{2019} offered \x{2018}physique and glamour movies\x{2019} for \x{2018}artists, students and connoisseurs\x{2019}, someone else sold \x{2018}50-foot action films\x{2019}, however long that was. Paul imagined the reel going round on a projector . . . he didn\x{2019}t think you could get much action into fifty feet, it would surely be over in no time. Anyway, he didn\x{2019}t have a projector; and couldn\x{2019}t see himself getting one on his present salary. Not that there would really be room in here . . . and then he\x{2019}d need a screen as well . . . Quite a few people were fans of something called \x{2018}tapespond-ing\x{2019}, where it seemed you recorded a message and sent it through the post, which might be romantic, but then he didn\x{2019}t have a tape-recorder either, and even if he did Mrs Marsh would think he\x{2019}d gone mad, talking away for hours on end in his room. He wasn\x{2019}t a very confident talker, and couldn\x{2019}t imagine how he\x{2019}d fill up a tape.",

In between cars he finished his drink, and the tipsy rush was followed by a less pleasant state of dry-mouthed impatience, as he found himself saying the same thing over and over. Jenny had gone in to find Julian and hadn\x{2019}t come back \x{2013} anyway they were only kids, even if Jenny treated Paul as somehow younger than herself. Roger wandered out for a sniff around the verge and pissed concisely at four different spots, but made no further sign of solidarity. The arrivals grew fewer. The dreaded Sir Dudley perhaps wasn\x{2019}t coming \x{2013} thus far Paul had let only one small car, which was virtually an invalid carriage, on to the drive itself. He thought of Peter\x{2019}s smile, and the little throb in his voice as he said \x{2018}Absolutely not!\x{2019} \x{2013} there was a giddy sense of an understanding, like the kick and lift of the booze itself, undamaged, stronger in fact since their first meeting, that made Paul\x{2019}s heart race again. It was almost as though Peter knew what he\x{2019}d done in Paul\x{2019}s daydreams, knew all about the bath and the bachelor flat. And now this vaguely headachy thirst, and a little doubt, like the cooling and quickening of the air, pushing among the hedge-tops in front of him and then leaving off. He could hear the cheery, faintly contentious noise of fifty or sixty people talking, on the big lawn at the back of the house, where tables and chairs had been set out. Peter was in there somewhere, among the family and friends, happily getting drunk, Peter Rowe-my-dear, rather full of himself. Certain things Paul didn\x{2019}t quite like about him came dully to the light. Did he truly fancy him, now he\x{2019}d seen him again? Could he really imagine getting undressed with that heavy-footed prep-school master? He thought of Geoff\x{2019}s tight zip, and then of beautiful Dennis Flowers, at King Alfred\x{2019}s in Wantage, Captain of Cricket, not a master but a boy. Paul stared in a kind of abstruse distress at the stretch of the lane by the gate, its chalky potholes, the parched grass and tough, half-pretty groundsel, knotty and yellow-flowered, that grew along its crown. Then the church clock struck <<8.30|11>>, the two bright notes with their unusual interval that seemed to tell him, in their complete indifference, to get in to the house at once.",

These glowing and darting boys coming out of the gym and the sauna had no idea of her interest. He spoke to her loudly and charmingly to show them she was worth it. She was a Victorian, she had seen two wars, and she was the sister-in-law, in a strange posthumous way, of the poet he was writing about. To Paul her natural habitat was an English garden, not a gusty defile off the Tottenham Court Road. Poems had been written for her, and set to music.

The fact was that all the interesting and decisive things in her adult life had happened when she was more or less tight: she had little recall of anything that occurred after <<about 6.45|5a:1>>, and the blur of the evenings, for the past sixty years and more, had leaked into the days as well. Her first problem, in doing her book, had been to recall what anyone said; in fact she had made up all the conversations, based (if one was strictly truthful) on odd words the person almost certainly had said, and within about five, or at the outside ten, years of the incident recorded. Was this just her failing? Now and then people gave her the most astonishing reports of what she had said, drolleries they would never forget, and rather gratifying to her \x{2013} though perhaps these should be treated with comparable suspicion?

            "When he got back to Olga, <<just before two o\x{2019}clock|10>>, he found the front door open and heard Wilfrid\x{2019}s voice coming from the kitchen, speaking more regularly and emphatically than usual. Even so, he couldn\x{2019}t make out at first what he was saying. He felt he\x{2019}d chanced on something awkwardly private. There was a sense of possible crisis. Rather than ring the bell, Paul stepped into the hall and gripping his briefcase stood leaning forward with an apologetic expression. It dawned on him that Wilfrid was reading to his mother. \x{2018} \x{201c}Ah hammer . . . dryers ever seen\x{201d},\x{2019} he seemed to say. For a dislocated second Paul couldn\x{2019}t place it; then of course he knew. Are Hamadryads ever seen / Between the dancing veils of green . . . ? He was reading \x{2018}Two Acres\x{2019} for her, and she was making a grumbling noise or coming in on the words herself as if to say the reading was hardly necessary; it was a sort of briefing perhaps for her second day\x{2019}s interview, and Paul found something reassuring in that \x{2013} and something oddly touching in the reversal of roles, son reading to mother. \x{2018} \x{201c}Or pause, then take the hidden turn, The path amid\x{2014}\x{201d} \x{2019} \x{2018} \x{201c}The path amid the hip-high fern\x{201d},\x{2019} Daphne came in. \x{2018}You don\x{2019}t read it at all well.\x{2019}",

            "There were no photos of Cecil in the album, which since he\x{2019}d only spent six nights of his life at \x{2018}Two Acres\x{2019} was hardly surprising, but of course disappointing. Paul looked closely at George whenever he appeared, from sailor-suited six-year-old to boatered Cambridge man, and with less and less doubt that whatever warmth this cold fish had felt had been directed at other young men. He asked Daphne if she would let him reproduce two photos of the house and garden, and she said she didn\x{2019}t see why not, but she fidgeted until she was sure that Wilfrid had returned the album to its hiding-place. When they were all sitting down again, Paul cleared his throat and looked at her more narrowly than before, and with a greater cumulative sense that it didn\x{2019}t matter how he looked at her, she wasn\x{2019}t going to see him. He said airily, \x{2018}There\x{2019}s one thing\x{2014}\x{2019} just as Daphne, with a little chuckle, almost grinning, as if at some great mutual satisfaction, said, \x{2018}Well! I\x{2019}m sorry to say that I\x{2019}ve promised to be at my friend Caroline\x{2019}s by <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>, so alas we\x{2019}ll have to bring the meeting to a conclusion, with a vote of thanks to Wilfrid Valance for the refreshments!\x{2019}",

Her black hat had an inch of veil at the front, and a mauve silk flower over her right ear. No wedding-ring, but several other fine old rings, heirlooms perhaps, on other fingers. Her clothes were soft crumpled velvet and silk, black and deep red, stylish but not exactly fashionable. She smiled at him again, and he wasn\x{2019}t sure if she thought she knew him, or thought quite naturally that she didn\x{2019}t need to know him to speak to him. Her firm, clipped voice had a hint of mischief. \x{2018}I fear a number of these people are going to have to stand.\x{2019} She looked round with satisfaction at the embarrassed struggles of the latest arrivals, as they clambered along the rows, or sat down abruptly and as if they didn\x{2019}t mind on some impossible ledge or radiator; one old man had perched like a tennis umpire at the top of the library steps. It was still only <<ten to two|10a:0>>, but events like this brought out a strange zeal in people. Rob had been lucky to find this seat, at the end of a row, but near the front. \x{2018}Did you go to the funeral?\x{2019}",

Inevitably, out of emotion, inexperience or sheer self-importance, almost all of them would go on too long, and the glinting wineglasses and shrouded buffet just visible at the far end of the library would not be reached till <<about four o\x{2019}clock|6>>. The library itself was funereally splendid \x{2013} Rob gazed at the tiers of leather-bound books with the sceptical, secretive eye of a professional. A broad arc of chairs filled the space and a low podium had been set up, with a lectern and a microphone. The servants, in their black jackets, were growing flustered, more chairs were brought in. An event like this must be a challenge to the routine of a club, the automatic deference due to a deceased member stretched a little thinner over this very mixed crowd. A couple of youngsters had been made to put on ties, but one group of men in leather were too far outside the dress-code for any such remedial action and had been let in unchallenged. The only other man without a tie was a lilac-vested bishop.",

The huge brass chandeliers had been switched on, and the room was thinning. It seemed the blond man had already left, and at this Rob felt almost relieved. And really this wasn\x{2019}t the moment . . . and with the eager young Gareth to see in an hour, at the Style Bar . . .
