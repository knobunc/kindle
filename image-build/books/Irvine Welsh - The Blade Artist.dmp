            "They meet in the Elephant House cafe on George IV Bridge, close to where he\x{2019}d started out yesterday, at the Central Library. His impression is that John Dick looks well; longish face, dark-framed glasses, black hair cut short, a permanent <<five-o\x{2019}clock|6>> shadow, and baggy clothes which conceal a wiry but muscular build. Franco recalls that when they first met, Dick had the relaxed bearing around him that he knew came from possessing a physical confidence. Amid all the other chunky, aggressive screws, John Dick seemed like a prisoner whisperer, his soft voice having the gift of turning down the volume in others. With the exception of Melanie, he probably listened to nobody in his life like he did to this prison officer.",

            "When I got down to the docks, it was <<4.20 p.m.|2a>> on the cheapo digital watch I\x{2019}d bought from the garage, but dark, drizzly and shite, the way Scotland often is at that time of the year. The orange sodium lamps were already on and splashing their reflections across the wet pavements and streets. The first weird thing was that the security bam, John, wasn\x{2019}t on the gate. I cycled right through, over that jarring strip of cobblestone, then across the iron rails of the cattle grid. I pedalled in the near-dark, heading for that imposing brick bothy. The old dry dock was barely lit by the overhead lamps. As I drew closer I heard voices; urgent, threatening sounds, carrying in the still night. I stopped and carefully climbed off the bike, and pushed it slowly and silently forward, resting it against the back of the bothy. At first it seemed as if the voices were coming from inside, but then I worked out that their source was the front of the howf.",

            "Franco stays silent. He recalls that time, the irritating fuss Elspeth and his mother had made. The bairn this, the bairn that. The bitterly resented implication that his life was now over, that he would live by proxy through this child. And he realised that he\x{2019}d been manipulated, that the pregnancy and the birth of the kid had represented a (forlorn) hope by June and his mother that he would change. Thinking of the latter, he wishes that he could have taken Val Begbie to Santa Barbara, had her meet his daughters. Shown her how it had worked out fine after all, like he\x{2019}d always assured her it would, throughout those decades of <<midnight|13>> police raids, calls from the cells, court appearances, and grim, ritual trips to prisons. But all Val \x{2013} by then in the advanced stages of cancer \x{2013} got was a brief meeting with Mel, and some pictures of Grace as a newborn.",

            "\x{2014} Are you paying too much interest on your loans? a robot voice enquires. Franco snaps it off, June looking at him in her old-school wounded way. Then it\x{2019}s time for everybody to leave. He sees Kate, another of his exes, who looks well, with her two sons, Chris, about fourteen, and River, <<around twelve|9e>>, who is his own. More than any of Franco\x{2019}s offspring, the kid, whom he\x{2019}s never seen outside some infant pictures she\x{2019}d sent him in prison, looks disconcertingly like him. He shakes the boy\x{2019}s hand, asks him about school, tells him to work hard at it, and be good to his mum. It\x{2019}s about all he can run to, and he\x{2019}s relieved to be interrupted by his old neighbour, Stevie Duncan, and his wife Julie. He hasn\x{2019}t seen them for years, and is delighted to hear that Stevie\x{2019}s mum, old Mrs Duncan, is still alive and living in the sheltered housing complex at Gordon Court. It is the same one his grandad Jock died in. He recalls that she\x{2019}d knitted him his first ever green-and-white Hibs scarf. They are good people. \x{2014} She would have been along, Frank, Stevie tells him, as they file outside into the cold. \x{2014} It\x{2019}s her legs, she cannae stand about for long.",

When she next bats into consciousness, she is horrified that it\x{2019}s <<almost ten|9f>> and she feels more exhausted than ever.
