            "It was not dark yet and the road meandered on, very white, deep between high walls. As they came out of the Salina property they passed on the left the half-ruined Falconeri villa, owned by Tancredi, his nephew and ward. A spendthrift father, married to the Prince\x{2019}s sister, had squandered his whole fortune and then died. It had been one of those total ruins which included even the gold braid on the lackeys\x{2019} liveries, and when the widow died the King had conferred the guardianship of her son, then aged fourteen, on his uncle Salina. The lad, scarcely known before, had become very dear to the irascible Prince, who perceived in him a riotous zest for life and a frivolous temperament contradicted by sudden serious moods. Though the Prince never admitted it to himself, he would have preferred the lad as his heir to that booby Paolo. Now, at <<twenty-one|9:0>>, Tancredi was enjoying life on the money which his uncle never grudged him, even from his own pocket. \x{201c}I wonder what the silly boy is up to now,\x{201d} thought the Prince as they drove past Villa Falconeri, whose huge bougainvilleas cascaded over the gates like swags of episcopal silk, lending a deceptive air of gaiety to the dark.",

An atmosphere of unusual relaxation had spread over the house. The <<midday|13>> meal was the chief one of the day, and went, God be thanked, quite smoothly. This in spite of one of the ringlets framing the face of the twenty-year-old Carolina, the eldest daughter, dropping into her soup plate because, apparently, of an ill-secured pin. Another day the incident might have had dreadful consequences, but now it only heightened the gaiety; and when her brother, sitting next to her, took the lock of hair and pinned it on his neckerchief, where it hung like a scapular, even the Prince allowed himself a smile. Tancredi\x{2019}s departure, destination, and reasons were now known to all, and everyone talked of them, except Paolo, who went on eating in silence. No one was really worrying about him, in fact, but the Prince, who showed no signs of the anxiety he still felt deep down, and Concetta, who was the only one with a shadow on her pretty forehead. \x{201c}The girl must have her eye on the young rascal. They\x{2019}d make a fine couple. But I fear Tancredi will have to aim higher, by which of course I mean lower.\x{201d}",

But they were also the first seen by the Salina family since leaving Bisacquino at <<six that morning|9a>>. It was now eleven, and for the last five hours all they had set eyes on were bare hillsides flaming yellow under the sun. Trots over level ground had alternated briefly with long, slow trudges uphill and then careful shuffles down; both trudge and trot merging, anyway, into the constant jingle of harness bells, imperceptible, now, to the dazed senses, except as sound equivalent of the blazing landscape. They had passed through crazed-looking villages washed in palest blue; crossed dry river beds over fantastic bridges; skirted sheer precipices which no sage and broom could temper. Never a tree, never a drop of water; just sun and dust. Inside the carriages, tightly shut against that sun and dust, the temperature must have been well over 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Those desiccated trees yearning away under bleached sky bore many a message: that they were now within a couple of hours of their journey\x{2019}s end; that they were coming into the family estates; that they could lunch, and perhaps even wash their faces in the verminous waters of the well.",

But now love had overcome his reserve, and he was begging his dearly beloved uncle to deign to request Signorina Angelica\x{2019}s \x{201c}most esteemed father\x{201d} for her hand, in his name and on his behalf. \x{201c}You know, Uncle, that all I can offer to the object of my affection is my love, my name, and my sword.\x{201d} After this phrase, in connection with which it should not be forgotten that romanticism was then at <<high noon|13>>, Tancredi went on to long considerations of the expediency, nay the necessity, of unions between families such as the Falconeris and the Sed\x{e0}ras (once he even dared write \x{201c}The House of Sed\x{e0}ra\x{201d}) being encouraged in order to bring new blood into old families, and also to level out classes, aims of the current political movement in Italy. This was the only part of the letter that Don Fabrizio read with any pleasure; and not just because it confirmed his own previsions and crowned him with the laurels of a prophet, but also (it would be harsh to say \x{201c}above all\x{201d}) because the style, with its hints of subdued irony, magically evoked his nephew\x{2019}s image: the jesting nasal tone, the sparkling malice in his blue eyes, the mockingly polite smile. And when he realized that this little Jacobin sally was written out on exactly one single sheet of paper so that if he wanted he could let others read the letter while subtracting this revolutionary chapter, his admiration for Tancredi\x{2019}s tact knew no bounds. After a brief r\x{e9}sum\x{e9} of recent operations and an expression of the conviction that within a year they would be in Rome, \x{201c}predestined capital of the new Italy,\x{201d} he thanked his uncle for the care and affection given him in the past, and ended by excusing himself for daring to confide him with this charge, \x{201c}on which my future happiness depends.\x{201d} Then came greetings (for Don Fabrizio only).",

He was wearing the same black frock coat in which two years before he had gone to pay his respects at Caserta to poor King Ferdinand, who had been lucky enough to die in time to avoid this day of dirty wind, when the seal would be set on his incapacity. But had it really been incapacity? One might as well say that a person succumbing to typhus dies from incapacity.

Angelica arrived at <<six in the evening|9a>>, dressed in pink and white; her soft black tresses were shadowed by a big autumnal straw hat on which bunches of artificial grapes and golden ears of wheat discreetly evoked the vineyards of Gibildolce and the granaries of Settesoli. She sloughed off her father in the entrance hall, then with a swirl of wide skirts floated lightly up the many steps of the inner staircase and flung herself into the arms of Don Fabrizio; on his whiskers she implanted two big kisses which were returned with genuine affection; the Prince paused perhaps just a second longer than necessary to breathe in the scent of gardenia on adolescent cheeks. After this Angelica blushed, took half a step back: \x{201c}I\x{2019}m so, so happy\x{a0}\x{2026},\x{201d} then came close again, stood on tiptoe, and murmured into his ear, \x{201c}Uncle mine!\x{201d}; a highly successful line, comparable in its perfect timing almost to Eisenstein\x{2019}s baby carriage, and which, explicit and secret as it was, set the Prince\x{2019}s simple heart aflutter and yoked him to the lovely girl for ever. Meanwhile Don Calogero was coming up the stairs, and said how very sorry his wife was she could not be present, but the night before she had slipped at home and twisted her left foot, which was most painful. \x{201c}Her ankle\x{2019}s like an eggplant, Prince.\x{201d} Don Fabrizio, exhilarated by the verbal caress, and forewarned by Tumeo\x{2019}s revelations that his offer would never be put to the proof, said that he would give himself the pleasure of calling upon the Signora Sed\x{e0}ra at once, a suggestion which dismayed Don Calogero and made him, in order to reject it, think up a second indisposition of his spouse\x{2019}s, this time a violent headache which forced the poor woman to remain in the dark.",

One wall was ennobled by a high, narrow bookcase, crammed full of back numbers of mathematical reviews. Above the great armchair meant for visitors hung a constellation of family miniatures: Don Fabrizio\x{2019}s father, Prince Paolo, heavy in face and sensual in lip as a Moor, with the ribbon of St. Januarius diagonally across his black Court uniform; Princess Carolina as a widow, her fair hair heaped into a towering coiffure, and with severe blue eyes; the Prince\x{2019}s sister, Giulia, Princess of Falconeri, sitting on a bench in a garden, with the crimson splotch of a small parasol laid on the ground to her right and to her left the yellow splotch of Tancredi at three years old offering her wild flowers (Don Fabrizio had thrust this miniature into his pocket secretly while the bailiffs were making their inventory for the sale at Villa Falconeri). Beneath that was his eldest son, Paolo, in tight white leather breeches, just about to mount an arrogant horse with a curving neck and flashing eyes; various unidentifiable uncles and aunts, covered with jewels or pointing sorrowfully at the bust of some extinct dear one.

            "Till that moment accumulated irritation had given him energy; now with relaxed nerves he was overcome by tiredness; it was already <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>>. He looked around for a place where he could sit down quietly, far from men, lovers and brothers, all right in their way, but always tiresome. He soon found it: the library, small, silent, lit, and empty. He sat down, then got up to drink some water which he found on a side table. \x{201c}Only water is really good,\x{201d} he thought like a true Sicilian, and did not dry the drops left on his lips. He sat down again; he liked the library and soon felt at his ease there; it put up no opposition to him because it was impersonal, as are rooms which are little used; Ponteleone was not a type to waste time in there. He began looking at a picture opposite him, a good copy of Greuze\x{2019}s Death of the Just Man; the old man was expiring on his bed, amid welters of clean linen, surrounded by afflicted grandsons and granddaughters raising arms toward the ceiling. The girls were pretty, provoking, and the disorder of their clothes suggested sex more than sorrow; they, it was obvious at once, were the real subject of the picture. Even so, Don Fabrizio was surprised for a second at Diego always having this melancholy scene before his eyes; then he reassured himself by thinking that the other probably entered that room only once or twice a year.",

It was <<midday|13>> on a Monday at the end of July, and away in front of him spread the sea of Palermo, compact, oily, inert, improbably motionless, crouching like a dog trying to make itself invisible at its master\x{2019}s threats; but up there the static perpendicular sun was straddling it and lashing at it pitilessly. The silence was absolute. Under the high, high light Don Fabrizio heard no other sound than that inner one of life gushing from him.",

Soon the seats were bereft of hats, and the ecclesiastics climbed into the three carriages from the Archbishopric with their near-black horses which had awaited them in the courtyard. Monsignor made a point of asking the chaplain, Father Titta, to share his own carriage, much to the latter\x{2019}s solace. The carriages moved off, and Monsignor was silent; they drove by the sumptuous Villa Falconeri, with its flowering bougainvilleas hanging over the walls of the splendidly kept garden; when they reached the slope down to Palermo amid the orange groves, Monsignor spoke. \x{201c}And so you, Father Titta, have actually said Mass for years in front of the picture of that girl? Of that girl with a rendezvous waiting for her lover? Now don\x{2019}t tell me you too believed it was a holy image.\x{201d}",

            "Lampedusa had written the occasional article on French literature and history for a Genoese cultural monthly, Le Opere e i Giorni, around <<about 1926|18:0>>\x{2013}27, but he did not take up his pen again until <<1954|9c:0>>. The author\x{2019}s lethargy had lasted until a meeting in the summer of that year at San Pellegrino Terme. He had gone to accompany his cousin Lucio Piccolo to the Kursaal salon, where Piccolo was presented to the literary world by Eugenio Montale. Seen at close quarters, said world did not impress Lampedusa very much. To work as a writer can come to the same thing as being a writer, and not many of the geniuses gathered at San Pellegrino had all that much to show. Lucio Piccolo\x{2019}s poetic activities and his success, a couple of days at San Pellegrino wresting him from his solitude, the afternoon lessons he gave to Francesco Orlando, a poet and narrator himself in those days: all provided a spur to action. At the end of 1954 he was already at work, and in the last thirty months he had to live, Lampedusa was writing on an almost daily basis, heedless of success, which it was his fate not to achieve in his lifetime. When he died in July 1957 he was preparing a second novel, I Gattini ciechi. He might also have added another chapter or two to his Leopard.",
