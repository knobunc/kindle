            "This had the effect of making Hippolyte turn and look at me. The expression in his face made me wonder, for the first time, what H\x{e9}lo\x{ef}se had been telling him about me on the way from Geneva. From the look on his face it had been nothing to my credit. As Raoul went on to speak of the <<midnight|13>> feast with Philippe I saw the expression deepen \x{2013} as if Hippolyte were being given a very different picture of me from the one he had got from H\x{e9}lo\x{ef}se. \x{2018}And there was something so odd about H\x{e9}lo\x{ef}se that night,\x{2019} said Raoul. \x{2018}She seemed frightened, if that were possible, and then there was Miss Martin\x{2019}s talk of nightmares \x{2026} But it was really the second accident that shook me. I went straight to the telephone in the small hours, and eventually got hold of you. It seemed the best thing to do, for us to tackle him together and find out what was going on and force him to \x{2026} see reason. I thought you might also hand the child over to my care if you had to leave again. I\x{2019}ve no authority at all where Philippe\x{2019}s concerned, and for obvious reasons I preferred not to enlist official help at that point. Hence the S.O.S. to you.\x{2019} He gave his uncle that fleeting, joyless smile. \x{2018}In any case, as far as the police were concerned, my father still held the winning card, which was that nothing had happened. He had, and has, committed no provable crime. But I thought that if you cabled you were coming home it would put paid to whatever he might be planning. If even then,\x{2019} he finished very wearily, \x{2018}he really was planning anything.\x{2019}",
