            "THE BEAR, LIKE MANY BEARS, had led a brief and vivid life. Born in the late winter of 1918 in a stump den, he was the oldest of two cubs. In personality he was quarrelsome and insensitive to the subtle implications of new things. He ate the remains of a poisoned eagle and nearly died. In his second autumn, from the height of a cliff, he saw his mother and sister backed against an angle in the rock by lean bear hounds. They went down in squalling that drew nothing but dry rifle fire. He was hunted himself the same year but escaped death and injury until <<1922|18:0>> when a coffin maker\x{2019}s charge of broken screws swept up from the shop floor smashed his upper left canine teeth, leaving him unbalanced in mind and with chronic abscesses.",

            'Then all at once the awkwardness was gone. Stories of things he had seen began to pour out, the words firing from between his loosened and gapped teeth. He told her about Cucumber drowning in a mine, <<midnight|13>> driving with Bullet over dangerous passes when the headlights failed, the mountain lion. He, who had talked little, talked much, swelled to a glowing huckster selling stories of his life. At <<two in the morning|9a>>, Starr nodding off, wanting nothing but sleep and silence, he stopped. They were tired of each other, each longed for the relief of solitude. He said he would sleep on the daybed beside the stove. The kitchen sunk of cigarettes.',

            "He kept peculiar time. Sometimes weeded his potatoes at <<ten o\x{2019}clock at night|6>>, the trouble light he used to illumine the oily guts of the engine hanging on a post in the garden, casting enormous shadows of potato leaves on the bleached sod and throwing down the shapes of gargoyles from his hunched shoulders and cowboy hat. While he worked the dog watched him like a new apprentice, snapping moths out of the air with a wet chop.",

Everything was gone. All except the goddamn camp. Here he was. He didn\x{2019}t know what to do. Why had he come up here? He hated the camp. And down in the trailer park the skirl of motorcycle wheelies in dirt. Busted-muffler trucks. The fucking trailer church with its tin steeple. Morning <<noon|13>> and night loudspeaker serenade of carillon tapes. Noise was driving him crazy. Let\x{2019}s see now, let me count the ways the noise annoys me.",

The electric shaver. The roaring gurgle of the toilet. The water coming out of the faucets. The pump. The pump was bad. The freezer. The fan. The computer\x{2019}s sickening hum and its chirping alarm. The clock by the bed. Tick. Tick. The energy-conserving automatic switch at <<5:00 P.M.|2a>> The flies knocking against the ceiling. The birds that smashed into their own reflections in the windows. The wind. No, the wind was an outside noise. Mice in the walls. Sounded like a western town, Mice-in-the-Walls, Montana.
