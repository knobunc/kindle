Perhaps there\x{2019}s a huge blizzard ten miles ahead. Or it may be something else, but it\x{2019}s surely some social or natural event of the type that induces large numbers of people all to do the same thing as one another. No amount of expertise in car mechanics will help you to grasp the essence of such a situation; what is needed is knowledge of the abstract forces that can act on freeways and traffic. Cars are just pawns in the bigger game and, aside from the fact that they can\x{2019}t pass through each other and emerge intact post-crossing (as do ripples and other waves), their physical nature plays no significant role in traffic jams. We are in a situation analogous to that in which the global, abstract, math-level answer \x{201c}641 is prime\x{201d} is far superior to a local, physical, domino-level answer.",

            "The roots of my fascination with such loops go very far back. When I was but a tyke, around four or five years old, I figured out, or was told, that  two twos made four. This catchy phrase \x{2014} \x{201c}two twos\x{201d} \x{2014} sent thrills up and down my spine, because I realized that it involved applying the notion of \x{201c}two\x{201d} to itself. It was a kind of self-referential operation, the twisting-back of a concept on itself. Just like a daredevil pilot or rock-climber, I craved more such experiences and riskier ones as well, so I quite naturally asked myself what three threes made. Being too small to figure this mystery out for myself (by making a square with three rows of three dots each, for instance), I asked my mother, that Font of Wisdom, for the answer, and she calmly informed me that it was <<nine|9f>>.",

The time we made it onto the train but our friend missed it by a hair. The time it was sweltering hot in the train and we had to stand up in the corridor all the way for four hours.

For instance, 41 is the sum of 16 and 25, and there are infinitely many other integers that can be made by summing two squares. Call them members of Class A. On the other hand, 43 is not the sum of any pair of squares, and likewise, there are infinitely many other integers that cannot be made by summing two squares. Call them members of Class B. (Which class is 109 in? What <<about 133|18:0>>?)

After all, the prime number 101, being the sum of the two squares 1 and 100, and thus belonging to Class A, has to be  written in boldface, and so our alleged boldface pair 89\x{2013}97 turns out to be a boldface triplet instead.

Words that apply to Pomponnette\x{2019}s straying also apply, as it happens, to Aur\x{e9}lie\x{2019}s straying, and neither interpretation is truer than the other, even if one of them was the originally intended one.

As long as each one is a correct description of what\x{2019}s happening, none of them is privileged. The reason we call computers \x{201c}computers\x{201d}, then, is historic. They originated as integer-calculation machines, and they are still of course validly describable as such \x{2014} but we now realize, as Kurt G\x{f6}del first did back in 1931, that such devices can be equally validly perceived and talked about in terms that are fantastically different from what their originators intended.",
