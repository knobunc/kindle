If I\x{2019}d known, I could have joined him. Tomorrow. Or the next day. I\x{2019}d been afraid of being left to the dogs. I\x{2019}d gone to Mrs. Freid\x{2019}s stone setting at Pinelawn, and it had seemed like a nice place. A Mr. Simchik showed me around and gave me a pamphlet. I\x{2019}d been imagining something under a tree, a weeping willow perhaps, maybe a little bench. But. When he told me the price my heart sank. He showed me my options, a few plots that were either too close to the road or where the grass was balding. Nothing at all with a tree? I asked. Simchik shook his head. A bush? He licked a finger and rustled through his papers. He hemmed and hawed, but finally he gave in. We may have something, he said, it\x{2019}s more than you were planning to spend but you can pay in installments. It was at the far end, in the suburbs of the Jewish part. It wasn\x{2019}t exactly under a tree but it was <<near one|9f>>, near enough that during the fall some of its leaves might drift down on me. I thought it over. Simchik told me to take my time and went back to the office. I stood in the sunlight. Then I got down on the grass and rolled onto my back. The ground was hard and cold under my raincoat. I watched the clouds pass above. Maybe I fell asleep. The next thing I knew, Simchik was standing above me. Nu? You\x{2019}ll take it?",

She opened a drawer, then closed it. \x{201c}Actually,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}you could say you\x{2019}re three-quarters Polish and one-quarter Hungarian, since Bubbe\x{2019}s parents were from Poland before they moved to Nuremberg, and Grandma Sasha\x{2019}s town was originally in Belarus, or White Russia, before it became part of Poland.\x{201d} She opened another cabinet stuffed with plastic bags and started rooting around in it. I turned to go. \x{201c}Now that I\x{2019}m thinking about it,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}I suppose you could also say you\x{2019}re three-quarters Polish and one-quarter Czech, because the town Zeyde came from was in Hungary before <<1918|9c:0>>, and in Czechoslavakia after, although the Hungarians continued to consider themselves Hungarian, and briefly even became Hungarian again during the Second World War. Of course, you could always just say you\x{2019}re half Polish, one-quarter Hungarian, and one-quarter English, since Grandpa Simon left Poland and moved to London when he was nine.\x{201d} She grabbed a piece of paper from the pad by the telephone and started to write vigorously. A minute passed while she scratched away at the page. \x{201c}Look!\x{201d} she said, pushing the paper over so I could see it. \x{201c}You can actually make sixteen different pie charts, each of them accurate!\x{201d} I looked at the paper.

My mother waved to me from the car. I shivered in the cold. A tall boy with dark fuzz on his upper lip came out. \x{201c}Alma?\x{201d} he asked. I nodded. \x{201c}Welcome, my friend!\x{201d} he said. I waved to my mother and followed him inside. The lobby smelled like sour cabbage. Upstairs, the apartment was packed with people eating and shouting in Russian. There was a band set up in a corner of the dining room, and people kept trying to dance even though there was no room. Misha was busy talking to everyone and stuffing envelopes in his pocket, so I spent most of the party sitting in the corner of the couch with a plate of giant shrimp. I don\x{2019}t even eat shrimp but it was the only thing I recognized. If anyone talked to me, I had to explain that I didn\x{2019}t speak Russian. An old man offered me some vodka. Just then Misha rushed out of the kitchen strapped into his accordion, which was plugged into an amplifier, and broke into song. \x{201c}You say it\x{2019}s your birthday!\x{201d} he shouted. The crowd looked nervous. \x{201c}Well it\x{2019}s my birthday, too!\x{201d} he yelled, and the accordion shrieked to life. This led into \x{201c}Sgt.

When the music finally stopped, Misha came to find me, his face pink and sweaty. He grabbed my hand, and I followed him out of the apartment, down the hall, up five flights of stairs, through a door, and out onto the roof. You could see the ocean in the distance, the lights of Coney Island, and after that an abandoned roller coaster. My teeth started to chatter, and Misha took off his jacket and put it around my shoulders. It was warm and smelled of sweat.",

How are you?\x{201d} \x{201c}Finethankyouhowareyou?\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}OK, I guess.\x{201d} He turned the page of a magazine and added, \x{201c}A little tired, you know, and I think I might be getting a cold, and this morning I woke up and my cat had puked, which wouldn\x{2019}t be so bad if she hadn\x{2019}t done it on my shoe.\x{201d} \x{201c}Oh,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}On top of which, I just found out that they\x{2019}re cutting off my cable because I happened to be a little late paying the bill, which means I\x{2019}m going to miss all of my shows, plus the plant my mother gave me for Christmas is going a little brown, and if it dies I\x{2019}ll never hear the end of it.\x{201d} I waited in case he was going to continue, but he didn\x{2019}t, so I said: \x{201c}Maybe she got married.\x{201d} \x{201c}Who?\x{201d} \x{201c}Alma Mereminski.\x{201d} He closed the magazine and looked at me. \x{201c}You don\x{2019}t know if your own great-grandmother got married?\x{201d} I considered my options. \x{201c}She\x{2019}s wasn\x{2019}t really my great-grandmother,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}I thought you said\x{2014}\x{201d} \x{201c}We\x{2019}re actually not even related.\x{201d} He looked confused and a little upset. \x{201c}Sorry. It\x{2019}s a long story,\x{201d} I said, and part of me wanted him to ask me why I was looking for her, so I could tell him the truth: that I wasn\x{2019}t really sure, that I had started out looking for someone to make my mother happy again, and even though I hadn\x{2019}t given up on finding him yet, along the way I began to look for something else, too, which was connected to the first search, but also different, because it had to do with me. But he just sighed and said, \x{201c}Would she have gotten married before <<1937|9c:0>>?\x{201d} \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not sure.\x{201d} He sighed and pushed his glasses up his nose, and told me they only had records in Room 103 for marriages up until <<1937|9c:0>>.",

I turned and called to him. \x{201c}Darling, the wind has dropped!\x{201d} And he said, \x{201c}Then I can go, and you won\x{2019}t trouble about me?\x{201d} I thought my heart would stop.

Once he climbed up a rock that was, like, two hundred feet tall. Somewhere in the Negev, I think.\x{201d} Bird breathed his hot breath on my neck. \x{201c}Masada?\x{201d} he asked. \x{201c}Could be,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}He just liked it. It was a hobby,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}Did he like to dance?\x{201d} Bird asked. I had no idea if he liked to dance, but I said, \x{201c}He loved it. He could even do the tango. He learned it in Buenos Aires. He and Mom danced all the time. He\x{2019}d move the coffee table against the wall and use the whole room. He used to lift her and dip her and sing in her ear.\x{201d} \x{201c}Was I there?\x{201d} \x{201c}Sure you were,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}He used to throw you up in the air and catch you.\x{201d} \x{201c}How\x{2019}d he know he wouldn\x{2019}t drop me?\x{201d} \x{201c}He just knew.\x{201d} \x{201c}What did he call me?\x{201d} \x{201c}Lots of things.

I didn\x{2019}t say anything. \x{201c}There are always thirty-six at any time,\x{201d} he whispered. \x{201c}No one knows who they are. Only their prayers reach God\x{2019}s ear. That\x{2019}s what Mr. Goldstein says.\x{201d} \x{201c}And you think you might be one of them,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}What else does Mr. Goldstein say?\x{201d} \x{201c}He says that when the Messiah comes, he\x{2019}s going to be one of the lamed vovniks. In every generation there\x{2019}s one person who has the potential to be the Messiah. Maybe he lives up to it, or maybe he doesn\x{2019}t. Maybe the world is ready for him, or maybe it isn\x{2019}t.
