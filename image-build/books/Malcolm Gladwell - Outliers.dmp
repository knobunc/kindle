            "In 1896, a dynamic young priest by the name of Father Pasquale de Nisco took over at Our Lady of Mount Carmel. De Nisco set
         up spiritual societies and organized festivals. He encouraged the townsfolk to clear the land and plant onions, beans, potatoes,
         melons, and fruit trees in the long backyards behind their houses. He gave out seeds and bulbs. The town came to life. The
         Rosetans began raising pigs in their backyards and growing grapes for homemade wine. Schools, a park, a convent, and a cemetery
         were built. Small shops and bakeries and restaurants and bars opened along Garibaldi Avenue. More than a dozen factories sprang
         up making blouses for the garment trade. Neighboring Bangor was largely Welsh and English, and the next town over was overwhelmingly
         German, which meant\x{2014}given the fractious relationships between the English and Germans and Italians in those years\x{2014}that Roseto
         stayed strictly for Rosetans. If you had wandered up and down the streets of Roseto in Pennsylvania in the first few decades
         <<after 1900|18:0>>, you would have heard only Italian, and not just any Italian but the precise southern Foggian dialect spoken back
         in the Italian Roseto. Roseto, Pennsylvania, was its own tiny, self-sufficient world\x{2014}all but unknown by the society around
