Around AD 350 St John Chrysostom deduced from the Bible that the Earth floated on the waters below the firmament of heaven, a view shared by St Athanasius at much the same time. In about AD 400 Bishop Severian of Gabala considered the Earth to be flat. Unusually, he also believed that the Sun did not travel beneath it during the hours of darkness, but instead nipped back round to the north, hidden from view. By <<550|9n:1>> Cosmas Indicopleustes, an Egyptian monk, was doggedly following Egyptian tradition and offered theological arguments for a flat Earth, but with a new twist: the shape was that of a parallelogram surrounded by four oceans.',

Until <<2003|9n:0>>.
That year, Joseph Dwyer was in Florida, on the ground, measuring x-rays from lightning, and he observed a huge burst of gamma rays from the storm clouds overhead. The burst had exactly the same energy spectrum as those that were thought to come from much higher. Even so, no one really imagined that the rays that CGRO was detecting came from thunderclouds: they were much too energetic. The energy needed to propel the rays through an atmosphere was too large to be credible.',

The mirrors are the top and bottom of the cloud, but instead of bouncing photons to and fro, the cloud sends electrons up and positrons down. By <<2005|9n:0>> this theory was pretty much firm.

Discworld inventors developed the clacks, a mechanical telegraph with repeaters at limit-of-sight, aided by telescopes, while we used a signal-box and mechanical linkages to signal to trains miles from the box. With electricity came the ability to send signals via cables, and the telegraph was born. Several different coding systems for commercial transactions, and a primitive fax machine, were in commercial use before <<1900|9c:1>>. All these were rocket-ships. Then came the telephone, which uses sound waves to modulate an electrical signal. Much capital investment went into wiring the countryside and undersea cables to connect the continents. These heroic ventures were comparable, in technical difficulty, with putting up a space bolas now. Meanwhile \x{2018}wireless\x{2019} began to be used: radio, and later television.

In order to derive a formula for how the shape and size of the universe changes over time, the mathematical physicists of the early twentieth century looked only for spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein\x{2019}s field equations. This assumption reduces the spatial variables from <<three to one|10a:0>>: the distance from the centre. As a bonus, it simplifies the Einstein field equations, which can now be solved by an explicit formula. Although there is a hand-waving justification of spherical symmetry, \x{2018}the universe should be the same everywhere\x{2019}, it doesn\x{2019}t have a solid basis. Einstein had insisted that the laws should be the same everywhere, but that doesn\x{2019}t imply the same behaviour everywhere. Both planets and the vacuum obey the same laws, for example.",
