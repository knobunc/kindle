Paradoxically, the new spirit of scientific enquiry was encouraging some people to question well-established observations of the shape of our planet. It is worth remembering that this was also a period when belief in the spirit world flourished. It wasn\x{2019}t just Biblical creation that was coming under fire from science. Although no reputable scientists seem to have reverted to believing in a flat Earth, several prominent figures in society did. What motivated them was often a fundamentalist attitude to the Bible, coupled with naive or idiosyncratic interpretations of its contents.",

Until <<2003|9c:0>>.
That year, Joseph Dwyer was in Florida, on the ground, measuring x-rays from lightning, and he observed a huge burst of gamma rays from the storm clouds overhead. The burst had exactly the same energy spectrum as those that were thought to come from much higher. Even so, no one really imagined that the rays that CGRO was detecting came from thunderclouds: they were much too energetic. The energy needed to propel the rays through an atmosphere was too large to be credible.',

            "Communication at a distance started with semaphore and chains of watch-fires on hilltops. Navies developed coded systems of flags for communication between ships. Discworld inventors developed the clacks, a mechanical telegraph with repeaters at limit-of-sight, aided by telescopes, while we used a signal-box and mechanical linkages to signal to trains miles from the box. With electricity came the ability to send signals via cables, and the telegraph was born. Several different coding systems for commercial transactions, and a primitive fax machine, were in commercial use before <<1900|9c:0>>. All these were rocket-ships. Then came the telephone, which uses sound waves to modulate an electrical signal. Much capital investment went into wiring the countryside and undersea cables to connect the continents. These heroic ventures were comparable, in technical difficulty, with putting up a space bolas now. Meanwhile \x{2018}wireless\x{2019} began to be used: radio, and later television. With mobile phone technology, depending upon billions of pounds of investment in immensely sophisticated base stations and in research to improve and develop the handsets, we are now beginning the space elevator stage of telephone technology.",

            "Well \x{2026} that\x{2019}s the standard story, but it requires an unstated assumption. In order to derive a formula for how the shape and size of the universe changes over time, the mathematical physicists of the early twentieth century looked only for spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein\x{2019}s field equations. This assumption reduces the spatial variables from <<three|20b>> to one: the distance from the centre. As a bonus, it simplifies the Einstein field equations, which can now be solved by an explicit formula. Although there is a hand-waving justification of spherical symmetry, \x{2018}the universe should be the same everywhere\x{2019}, it doesn\x{2019}t have a solid basis. Einstein had insisted that the laws should be the same everywhere, but that doesn\x{2019}t imply the same behaviour everywhere. Both planets and the vacuum obey the same laws, for example.",

The first is inflation, in which the entire universe expanded to a huge size in an extraordinarily short time. The figures are shocking: between <<10-36|5a:0>> and <<10|91:0>>-32 seconds after the Big Bang the volume of the universe multiplied by a factor of at least 1078. The cause of this rapid growth \x{2013} an explosion far more impressive than the wimpy Big Bang that started it all \x{2013} is, we are told, an inflaton field. (Not \x{2018}inflation field\x{2019}: an inflaton is \x{2013} well, a quantum field that causes inflation.) This theory fits many observations very well.

They believed that the material world was essentially evil, and that only the spiritual world was good.

Fish was all right: they didn\x{2019}t know about underwater sex \x{2013} or plant sex, for that matter. They were totally celibate, and deplored sex even in marriage. There was a ceremony, prescribed for attainment of the perfectus state, a single sacrament, the consolamentum or consolation. It involved a brief spiritual ceremony to remove all sin from the credente, or believer, and induct them into the next higher level as a perfectus. It was commonly performed as death approached, so that the believer was not condemned. Belief in its effectiveness, however, was by no means universal.",

Change any parameter (alone) by more than that, and life becomes impossible. It is then argued that the probability of all thirty parameters being in the right range is 1/10 raised to the power 30.
