            '\'Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this Golden Ticket, from Mr Willy Wonka! I shake you warmly by the hand! Tremendous things are in store for you! Many wonderful surprises await you! For now, I do invite you to come to my factory and be my guest for one whole day - you and all others who are lucky enough to find my Golden Tickets. I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself, showing you everything that there is to see, and afterwards, when it is time to leave, you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks. These trucks, I can promise you, will be loaded with enough delicious eatables to last you and your entire household for many years. If, at any time thereafter, you should run out of supplies, you have only to come back to the factory and show this Golden Ticket, and I shall be happy to refill your cupboard with whatever you want. In this way, you will be able to keep yourself supplied with tasty morsels for the rest of your life. But this is by no means the most exciting thing that will happen on the day of your visit. I am preparing other surprises that are even more marvellous and more fantastic for you and for all my beloved Golden Ticket holders - mystic and marvellous surprises that will entrance, delight, intrigue, astonish, and perplex you beyond measure. In your wildest dreams you could not imagine that such things could happen to you! Just wait and see! And now, here are your instructions: the day I have chosen for the visit is the first day in the month of February. On this day, and on no other, you must come to the factory gates at <<ten o\'clock|6>> sharp in the morning. Don\'t be late! And you are allowed to bring with you either one or two members of your own family to look after you and to ensure that you don\'t get into mischief. One more thing - be certain to have this ticket with you, otherwise you will not be admitted.',

            'At that point, there came a loud knock on the front door. Mr Bucket went to open it, and the next moment, swarms of newspapermen and photographers were pouring into the house. They had tracked down the finder of the fifth Golden Ticket, and now they all wanted to get the full story for the front pages of the morning papers. For several hours, there was complete pandemonium in the little house, and it must have been <<nearly midnight|13>> before Mr Bucket was able to get rid of them so that Charlie could go to bed.',

            'Outside the gates of Wonka\'s factory, enormous crowds of people had gathered to watch the five lucky ticket holders going in. The excitement was tremendous. It was <<just before ten o\'clock|10>>. The crowds were pushing and shouting, and policemen with arms linked were trying to hold them back from the gates.',

            'All the children, except Charlie, had both their mothers and fathers with them, and it was a good thing that they had, otherwise the whole party might have got out of hand. They were so eager to get going that their parents were having to hold them back by force to prevent them from climbing over the gates. \'Be patient!\' cried the fathers. \'Be still! It\'s not time yet! It\'s not <<ten o\'clock|6>>!\'',

Somewhere in the distance, a church clock began striking <<ten|11>>.
Very slowly, with a loud creaking of rusty hinges, the great iron gates of the factory began to swing open.',
