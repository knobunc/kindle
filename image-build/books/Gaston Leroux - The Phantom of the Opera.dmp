            "Leroux\x{2019}s skills impressed the editors at the popular daily Le Matin, and they hired him in 1894 as a roving correspondent and investigative reporter. Adventurous, even fearless, Leroux would stop at nothing to get the best take on a story and sometimes donned disguises to pursue promising leads. He relished work on location in Africa, Europe, and Asia, and was a first-hand witness to the Russian Revolution of 1905. His personal life was unconventional; estranged from his wife, he lived for many years with Jeanne Cayatte, a woman he met in 1902 but did not marry until <<1917|9c:0>>. The couple had two children.",

I was only surprised that she had not heard me walking behind her, for my footsteps were quite audible on the hard snow. But she must have been taken up with her intentions and I resolved not to disturb her. She knelt down by her father\x{2019}s grave, made the sign of the cross and began to pray.

Christine and I knew that music; we had heard it as children. But it had never been executed with such divine art, even by M. Daa\x{e9}. I remembered all that Christine had told me of the Angel of Music. The air was The Resurrection of Lazarus, which old Mr. Daa\x{e9} used to play to us in his hours of melancholy and of faith. If Christine\x{2019}s Angel had existed, he could not have played better, that night, on the late musician\x{2019}s violin.
