            "I always catch the all-night bus, six days out of the week. I walk to Marble Arch and get the two-nine-four, that takes me to Fleet Street. I never speak to the men on the all-night buses. Then I go into the Black and White at Fleet Street and sometimes my friend comes. I have a cup of tea. She is taller than me but thinner. Sometimes she comes and we sit at the top table. I always keep her place but you can\x{2019}t always keep it. I never speak to them when they take it. Some remarks I never listen to. A man slips me the morning paper sometimes, the first one. He told me what he was once. I never go down to the place near the Embankment. I did go down there once. You can see what goes on from the window by the top table if you look. Mostly it\x{2019}s vans. They\x{2019}re always rushing. Mostly they\x{2019}re the same van-drivers, sometimes they\x{2019}re different. My brother was the same. He used to be in on it. But I can do better without the night, when it\x{2019}s dark, it\x{2019}s always light in the Black and White, sometimes it\x{2019}s blue, I can\x{2019}t see much. But I can do better without the cold when it\x{2019}s cold. It\x{2019}s always warm in the Black and White, sometimes it\x{2019}s draughty, I don\x{2019}t kip. <<Five o\x{2019}clock|6>> they close down to give it a scrub round. I always wear my grey skirt and my red scarf, you never see me without lipstick. Sometimes my friend comes, she always brings over two teas. If there\x{2019}s someone taken her place she tells him. She\x{2019}s older than me but thinner. If it\x{2019}s cold I might have soup. You get a good bowl. They give you the slice of bread. They won\x{2019}t do that with tea but they do it with soup. So I might have soup, if it\x{2019}s cold. Now and again you can see the all-night buses going down. They all run down there. I\x{2019}ve never been the other way, not the way some of them go. I\x{2019}ve been down to Liverpool Street. That\x{2019}s where some of them end up. She\x{2019}s greyer than me. The lights get you down a bit. Once a man stood up and made a speech. A copper came in. They got him out. Then the copper came over to us. We soon told him off, my friend did. I never seen him since, either of them. They don\x{2019}t get many coppers. I\x{2019}m a bit old for that, my friend told him. Are you, he said. Too old for you, she said. He went. I don\x{2019}t mind, there\x{2019}s not too much noise, there\x{2019}s always a bit of noise. Young people in cabs come in once. She didn\x{2019}t like the coffee. I\x{2019}ve never had the coffee. I had coffee up at Euston, a time or two, going back. I like the vegetable soup better than the tomato. I was having a bowl then and this man was leaning from across the table, dead asleep, but sitting on his elbows, scratching his head. He was pulling the hairs out of his head into my soup, dead asleep. I pulled my bowl away. But at <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>> they close down to give it a scrub round. They don\x{2019}t let you stay. My friend never stays, if she\x{2019}s there. You can\x{2019}t buy a cup of tea. I\x{2019}ve asked but they won\x{2019}t let you sit, not even with your feet up. Still, you can get about four hours out of it. They only shut hour and a half. You could go down to that one near the Embankment, but I\x{2019}ve only been down there once. I\x{2019}ve always got my red scarf. I\x{2019}m never without lipstick. I give them a look. They never pick me up. They took my friend away in the wagon once. They didn\x{2019}t keep her. She said they took a fancy to her. I\x{2019}ve never gone in for that. You keep yourself clean. Still, she won\x{2019}t stand for any of it in the Black and White. But they don\x{2019}t try much. I see them look. Mostly nobody looks. I don\x{2019}t know many, some I\x{2019}ve seen about. One woman in a big black hat and big black boots comes in. I never make out what she has. He slips her the morning paper. It\x{2019}s not long. You can go along, then come back. When it\x{2019}s light I go. My friend won\x{2019}t wait. She goes. I don\x{2019}t mind. One got me sick. Came in a fur coat once. They give you injections, she said, it\x{2019}s all Whitehall, they got it all worked out, she said, they can tap your breath, they inject you in the ears. My friend came later. She was a bit nervy. I got her quiet. They\x{2019}d take her in. When it\x{2019}s light I walk up to the Aldwych. They\x{2019}re selling the papers. I\x{2019}ve read it. One morning I went a bit over Waterloo Bridge. I saw the last two-nine-six. It must have been the last. It didn\x{2019}t look like an all-night bus, in daylight.",
