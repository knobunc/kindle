            "The one thing the Pilgrims certainly didn\x{2019}t do was step ashore on Plymouth Rock. Quite apart from the consideration that it may have stood well above the high-water mark in 1620, no prudent mariner would try to bring a ship alongside a boulder on a heaving December sea when a sheltered inlet beckoned from near by. Indeed, it is doubtful that the Pilgrims even noticed Plymouth Rock. No mention of the rock is found among any of the surviving documents and letters of the age, and it doesn\x{2019}t make its first recorded appearance until <<1715|9c:0>>, almost a century later. Not until about the time Ms Hemans wrote her swooping epic did Plymouth Rock become indelibly associated with the landing of the Pilgrims.",

            "Even the Vikings didn\x{2019}t think themselves the first. Their sagas record that when they first arrived in the New World they were chased from the beach by a group of wild white people. They subsequently heard stories from natives of a settlement of Caucasians who \x{2018}wore white garments and ... carried poles before them to which rags were attached\x{2019} \x{2013} precisely how an Irish religious procession would have looked to the uninitiated. (Intriguingly, five centuries later Columbus\x{2019}s men would hear a similar story in the Caribbean.) Whether by Irish or Vikings \x{2013} or Italians or Welsh or Bretons or any of the other many groups for whom credit has been sought \x{2013} crossing the Atlantic in the Middle Ages was not quite as daring a feat as it would at first appear, even allowing for the fact that it was done in small, open boats. The North Atlantic is conveniently scattered with islands that could serve as stepping-stones \x{2013} the Shetland Islands, Faeroes, Iceland, Greenland and Baffin. It would be possible to sail from Scandinavia to Canada without once crossing more than 250 miles of open sea. We know beyond doubt that Greenland \x{2013} and thus, technically, North America \x{2013} was discovered in 982 by one Eric the Red, father of Leif Ericson (or Leif Er\x{ed}ksson), and that he and his followers began settling it in 986. Anyone who has ever flown over the frozen wastes of Greenland could be excused for wondering what they saw in the place. But in fact Greenland\x{2019}s southern fringes are further south than Oslo and offer an area of grassy lowlands as big as the whole of Britain. Certainly it suited the Vikings. For nearly five hundred years they kept a thriving colony there, which at its peak boasted sixteen churches, two monasteries, some 300 farms and a population of 4,000. But the one thing Greenland lacked was wood with which to build new ships and repair old ones \x{2013} a somewhat vital consideration for a sea-going people. Iceland, the nearest land mass to the east, was known to be barren. The most natural thing would be to head west to see what was out there. In <<about 1000|18:0>>, according to the sagas, Leif Ericson did just that. His expedition discovered a new land mass, probably Baffin Island, far up in northern Canada, over a thousand miles north of the present-day United States, and many other places, most notably the region they called Vinland.",

            "Kn-, which was always sounded in Middle English, was at the time of the Pilgrims going through a transitional phase in which it was commonly pronounced tn. Where the Pilgrims\x{2019} parents or grandparents would have pronounced knee as \x{2018}kuh-nee,\x{2019} they themselves would have been more likely to say \x{2018}t\x{2019}nee.\x{2019}
The interior gh in words like night and light had been silent for about a generation, but on or near the end of words \x{2013} in laugh, nought, enough, plough \x{2013} it was still sometimes pronounced, sometimes left silent and sometimes given an f sound.
There was no sound equivalent to the ah in the modern father and calm. Father would have rhymed with the present-day gather and calm with ram.
Was was pronounced not \x{2018}woz\x{2019} but \x{2018}wass\x{2019}, and remained so, in some circles at least, long enough for Byron to rhyme it with pass. Conversely, kiss was often rhymed with is.
War rhymed with car or care. It didn\x{2019}t gain its modem pronunciation until sometime after the turn of the nineteenth century.
Home was commonly spelled \x{2018}whome\x{2019} and pronounced, by at least some speakers, as it was spelled, with a distinct wh- sound.
The various o and u sounds were, to put it mildly, confused and unsettled. Many people rhymed cut with put, plough with screw, book with moon, blood with load. Dryden, as late as the second half of the seventeenth century, made no distinction between flood, mood and good, though quite how he intended them to be pronounced is anybody\x{2019}s guess. The vicissitudes of the wandering oo sound are evident both in its multiplicity of modern pronunciations (for example, flood, wood, mood) and the number of such words in which the pronunciation is not fixed even now, notably roof, soot and hoof.
Oi was sounded with a long i, so that coin\x{2019}d sounded like kind and voice like vice. The modern oi sound was sometimes heard, but was considered a mark of vulgarity until about the time of the American Revolution.
Words that now have a short e were often pronounced and sometimes spelled with a short i. Shakespeare commonly wrote \x{2018}bin\x{2019} for been, and as late as the tail-end of the eighteenth century Benjamin Franklin was defending a short i pronunciation for get, yet, steady, chest, kettle and the second syllable of instead \x{2013} though by this time he was fighting a losing battle.
Speech was in general much broader, with stresses and a greater rounding of rs. A word like never would have been pronounced more like \x{2019}nev-arrr\x{2019}. Interior vowels and consonants were more frequently suppressed, so that nimbly became \x{2018}nimly\x{2019}, fault and salt became \x{2018}faut\x{2019} and \x{2018}saut\x{2019}, somewhat was \x{2018}summat\x{2019}. Other letter combinations were pronounced in ways strikingly at variance with their modern forms. In his Special Help to Orthographie or the True-writing of English (1643), a popular book of the day, Richard Hodges listed the following pairs of words as being \x{2018}so neer alike in sound ... that they are sometimes taken one for another\x{2019}: ream and realm, shoot and suit, room and Rome, were and wear, poles and Paul\x{2019}s, flea and flay, eat and ate, copies and coppice, person and parson, Easter and Hester, Pierce and parse, least and lest. The spellings \x{2013} and misspellings \x{2013} of names in the earliest records of towns like Plymouth and Dedham give us some idea of how much more fluid early colonial pronunciation was. These show a man named Parson sometimes referred to as Passon and sometimes as Passen; a Barsham as Barsum or Bassum; a Garfield as Garfill; a Parkhurst as Parkis; a Holmes as Holums; a Pickering as Pickram; a St John as Senchion; a Seymour as Seamer; and many others.
Differences in idiom abounded, notably with the use of definite and indefinite articles. As Baugh and Cable note, Shakespeare commonly discarded articles where we would think them necessary \x{2013} \x{2018}creeping like snail\x{2019}, \x{2018}with as big heart as thou\x{2019} and so on \x{2013} but at the same time he employed them where we would not, so that where we say \x{2018}at length\x{2019} and \x{2018}at last\x{2019}, he wrote \x{2018}at the length\x{2019} and \x{2018}at the last\x{2019}. The preposition of was also much more freely employed. Shakespeare used it in many places where we would require another: \x{2018}it was well done of [by] you\x{2019}, \x{2018}I brought him up of [from] a puppy\x{2019}, \x{2018}I have no mind of [for] feasting\x{2019}, \x{2018}That did but show thee of [as] a fool\x{2019}, and so on. One relic of this practice survives in American English in the way we tell time. Where Americans commonly say that it is \x{2018}<<ten of three|10>>\x{2019} or \x{2018}<<twenty of four|10>>\x{2019}, the British only say \x{2018}ten to\x{2019} or \x{2018}twenty to\x{2019}.
Er and ear combinations were frequently, if not invariably, pronounced \x{2018}ar\x{2019}, so that convert became \x{2018}convart\x{2019}, heard was \x{2018}hard\x{2019} (though also \x{2018}heerd\x{2019}), and serve was \x{2018}sarve\x{2019}. Merchant was pronounced and often spelled \x{2018}marchant\x{2019}. The British preserve the practice in several words today \x{2013} as with clerk and derby, for instance \x{2013} but in America the custom was long ago abandoned but for a few well-established exceptions like heart, hearth and sergeant, or else the spelling was amended, as with making sherds into shards or Hertford, Connecticut, into Hartford.
Generally, words containing ea combinations \x{2013} tea, meat, deal and so on \x{2013} were pronounced with a long a sound (and of course many still are: great, break, steak, for instance), so that, for example, meal and mail were homonyms. The modern ee pronunciation was just emerging, so that Shakespeare could, as his whim took him, rhyme please with either grace or knees. Among more conservative users the old style persisted well into the eighteenth century, as in the well-known lines by the poet William Cowper:


I am monarch of all I survey ...",

The name comes from an earlier sense of passenger as one that passes by, and passenger pigeons certainly did that in almost inconceivably vast numbers. One early observer estimated a passing flock as being a mile wide and 240 miles long. They literally darkened the sky. At the time of the Mayflower landing there were perhaps nine billion passenger pigeons in North America, more than twice the number of all the birds found on the continent today. With such numbers they were absurdly easy to hunt. One account from 1770 reported that a hunter brought down 125 with a single shot from a blunderbuss. Some people ate them, but most were fed to pigs. Millions more were slaughtered for the sport of it. By <<1800|9n:0>> their numbers had been roughly halved and by 1900 they were all but gone.

One of seventeen children of a Boston soap and candle maker, he had left home as a boy after receiving barely two years of schooling, and established himself as a printer in Philadelphia. By dint of hard work and steady application he had made himself into one of the most respected thinkers and wealthiest businessmen in the colonies. His experiments with electricity, unfairly diminished in the popular mind to inventing the lightning rod and nearly killing himself by foolishly flying a kite in a thunderstorm, were among the most exciting scientific achievements of the eighteenth century and made him one of the celebrated scientists of the day (though he was never called a scientist in his lifetime, the word not being coined until <<1840|9c:0>>; in the 1700s scientists were natural philosophers). The terms he created in the course of his experiments \x{2013} battery, armature, positive, negative and condenser, among others \x{2013} show that he was a good deal more than a mildly quizzical fellow who just wanted to see what would happen if he nudged a kite into some storm clouds.

He invented countless useful objects (which we shall discuss in a later chapter), helped to found America\x{2019}s first volunteer fire department, its first fire insurance company (the Hand-in-Hand), one of Philadelphia\x{2019}s first libraries, and the respected if somewhat overnamed American Philosophical Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge to be Held at Philadelphia. He created an eternal literary character, the Richard of Poor Richard\x{2019}s Almanack, filled the world with maxims and bons mots, corresponded endlessly with the leading minds of Europe and America, wrote essays on everything from how to select a mistress (take an older woman) to how to avoid flatulence (drink perfume), and in 1737 drew up the first list of American slang terms for drunkenness. (He came up with 228.) He represented America overseas with intelligence and skill and, of course, was one of the shapers of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. He dabbled in property speculation and ran a printing business with holdings as far afield as Jamaica and Antigua. He became the largest dealer in paper in the colonies and made Poor Richard\x{2019}s Almanack such an indispensable part of almost every American household that it was for twenty-five years the country\x{2019}s second best-selling publication (the Bible was first).

Because a bit was worth twelve and a half cents, a quarter dollar naturally became known as two bits, a half dollar as four bits, particularly west of the Mississippi. Ten cents was a short bit; a long bit was fifteen cents.

In the thirty years that lay either side of Garfield\x{2019}s death America enjoyed a period of growth unlike that seen anywhere in history. In almost every area of economic activity, America rose like a giant, producing quantities of raw materials and finished products that dwarfed the output of other countries \x{2013} sometimes dwarfed the output of all other countries put together.

Though we tend to associate the Spanish with the south-west, Spain\x{2019}s American dominions stretched at one time across most of the continent, from the Florida Keys as far north as Alaska. Memphis was once known as San Fernando and Vicksburg as Nogales. But, preoccupied with their holdings in Central and South America and convinced that North America was mostly worthless desert, the Spanish never made much of the lands to the north. By <<1821|9n:0>>, when Spain withdrew from North America, its estate north of the border consisted of only a few scattered garrisons and just three towns worthy of the name \x{2013} Santa Fe, San Antonio and St Augustine, though even they couldn\x{2019}t muster 10,000 citizens between them. (Mexico City by contrast had a population comfortably above 150,000.) Even so, as I need hardly tell you, the Spanish left hundreds of names on the American landscape, including the oldest non-Amerindian place name in the United States \x{2013} Florida, or \x{2018}place of flowers\x{2019}, so dubbed by Juan Ponce de Le\x{f3}n when he became the first known European to set foot on what would eventually become US soil, on 2 April 1513. Missions and other small settlements soon followed, among them Tortugas (the second oldest European place name in North America), St Augustine and Apalchen. This last named was never anything more than a hamlet, but the name somehow came to be applied to the vaguely defined mountainous interior. Eventually it attached itself to the mountain themselves \x{2013} hence, Appalachians.",

In the ten years that Dodge City was the biggest, rowdiest cow town in the world, only thirty-four people were buried in the infamous Boot Hill Cemetery, and almost all of them had died of natural causes. Incidents like the shoot-out at the OK Corral or the murder of Wild Bill Hickock became famous by dint of their being so unusual. Those who were shot seldom got up again. Scarcely a western movie has been made in which at least one character hasn\x{2019}t taken a bullet in the thigh or shoulder but shrugged it off with a manly wince and continued firing. As one observer has put it: \x{2018}One would think that the human shoulder was made of some self-healing material, rather like a puncture-proof tire.\x{2018} In fact, nineteenth-century bullets were so slow, relatively speaking, and so soft that they almost never moved cleanly through the victim\x{2019}s body. Instead, they bounced around like a pinball and exited through a hole like that created by a fist punched through paper. Even if a bullet miraculously missed the victim\x{2019}s vital organs, he would almost invariably suffer deep and incapacitating shock and bleed to death within minutes. For the most part, trust and goodwill were no more lacking in the lawless environment of the West than elsewhere. As Boorstin notes, it is no accident that the term pardner \x{2013} originally conveying a sense much deeper and more trusting than that of a casual friendship \x{2013} entered the language in the gold fields of California <<around 1850|18:1>>. Justice was often peremptory and swift \x{2013} thieves and cheats on riverboats were generally put down on the nearest sand-bar and left to make their way back to civilization, if they could \x{2013} but at least justice there was. Land-based miscreants were often dealt with by kangaroo courts \x{2013} impromptu convocations that seldom bothered with the niceties of due process. This rather odd and interesting term has been traced to Texas, a place notably deficient in antipodean marsupials, and was first recorded in 1849. It appears to have no connection to Australia \x{2013} the expression was unknown there until introduced from America \x{2013} and may derive from the idea of a criminal being bounced like a kangaroo to the gallows, but that is no more than conjecture.",

Others have linked it to various African or Creole sources. In any case, its first use, among both southern blacks and whites, was to describe sexual intercourse. It wasn\x{2019}t until after World War I that it entered the wider world conveying the idea of a type of music. Quite a number of Afro-American terms contain some forgotten sexual association.

            "By <<1912|9n:0>>, just four years after its introduction, three-quarters of the cars on American roads were Model Ts. Ford is often credited with introducing the world to the concept of the moving \x{2018}assembly line\x{2019} in 1913. Though the word may be his, the idea wasn\x{2019}t. For decades scores of other industries, from vegetable canning to meat wholesaling, had used assembly line methods, but had referred to them as \x{2018}continuous process manufacturing\x{2019} or \x{2018}flow production\x{2019}. Ford simply adapted the idea to a much larger manufacturing process. With his revolutionary methods and by keeping the car basic \x{2013} \x{2018}You can have any colour you want as long as it\x{2019}s black\x{2019} was his oft-repeated quip \x{2013} Ford cut the time it took to produce a Model T from fourteen man-hours in 1910 to just two man-hours in 1913, and with it of course the price fell. The first Model T cost \$850 and rose the next year to \$950, but after that, with Ford\x{2019}s novel and wondrously efficient production lines and increasing economies of scale, the price fell continuously. By <<1916|9n:0>> a new Model T cost as little as \$345. Even so, that was far more money than most people could get their hands on. A new system of financing arose and with it came a raft of ominous new expressions: instalment plan, time payments, one-third down, downpayment and that perennial invitation to ruin, buy now, pay later.",

            "A month before the first Model T was produced, another great name of the industry was born: General Motors. The company, which had begun life as the Flint Road Cart Company, was founded by William Crapo \x{2018}Billy\x{2019} Durant, a mercurial figure described by one friend as \x{2018}a child in emotions, in temperament and in mental balance\x{2019}. Durant knew nothing of engineering and was not a gifted innovator. Indeed he wasn\x{2019}t even a particularly astute businessman. He was simply a great accumulator. He bought companies indiscriminately, not just car makers, but enterprises that were involved with the automobile business only tangentially, if at all \x{2013} companies like the Samson Sieve-Grip Tractor Company (which built tractors steered by reins on the dubious grounds that farmers would find them more horse-like) and a one-man refrigerator company that would eventually become Frigidaire. Many of his automotive acquisitions became great names \x{2013} Buick, Oldsmobile, Cadillac, Chevrolet \x{2013} but many others, like Cartercar, Sheridan, Scripps-Booth and Oakland, were never more than highly dubious. His strategy, as he put it, was to \x{2018}get every kind of car in sight\x{2019} in the hope that the successes would outweigh the failures. They didn\x{2019}t always. He lost control of General Motors in 1910, got it back in 1916, lost it again in 1920. By <<1936|9n:0>>, after more bad investments, he was bankrupt with debts of nearly \$ 1 million and assets of just \$250.",

North-south highways were given odd numbers, and east-west highways were given even numbers (with major transcontinental routes ending in multiples of ten). Names were ruthlessly abandoned. At a stroke, highways lost much of their romance. The Lincoln Highway, completed only two years before, became US Route 30. The great Dixie Highway became the uninspiring Route 25. The William Penn became Route 22. Probably the most famous highway of them all, Route 66, never suffered the indignity of being stripped of its name for the simple reason that it never had one. It was not begun until <<1926|9c:0>>, in the post-name era. Its humiliation would have to wait until 1985, when the federal highway department removed all the Route 66 shield signs along its 2,200 miles from Michigan Avenue in Chicago to Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica.

In 1929 a young drugstore owner in Massachusetts named Howard Johnson decided that what America\x{2019}s motorists craved was a safe, reliable uniformity of eating. He hit on the idea of franchising as a quicker, less risky way of building a chain. By <<1940|9n:0>>, 125 Howard Johnson\x{2019}s restaurants stood along the eastern seaboard, two-thirds of them owned by franchisees, or agents as Johnson called them.

Carefully avoiding the seedy connotations inherent in motel, he called it a Holiday Inn. Before long, Holiday Inns were going up at the rate of one every two and a half days.

Corn began as a wild grass, probably in the Tehuac\x{e1}n Valley of central Mexico. Converting a straggly wild grass into the plump and nutritious foodstuff we know today was possibly the greatest of all precolonial achievements. Corn will grow almost anywhere, and by <<1620|9n:0>> was a well-established crop throughout the New World. To the original colonists, \x{2018}corn\x{2019} signified any common grain, as it still does in Britain. So they adopted the Spanish name maize (after a West Indian Taino word, mahiz). Since maize was in effect the only type of grain there was, \x{2018}corn\x{2019} gradually came to signify it alone. Corn has been domesticated for so long \x{2013} some seven thousand years \x{2013} that it is now totally dependent on humankind for its continued existence. Left on its own, the kernels of each cob \x{2013} its seeds \x{2013} would be strangled by the husk. Even in colonial times it was a far more demanding plant than the colonists were used to. With their usual vexing ineptitude the first colonists tried sowing it by broadcast method, as they did with other grains, and were baffled that it didn\x{2019}t grow.

Another suggestion is that it is a corruption of Shawnee cake. As Ciardi notes, in New England it was called jonakin or jonikin long before it was called johnnycake, suggesting that johnnycake is a folk etymology based on some earlier, forgotten Indian term. Two other travelling foods known to early Americans were pemmican and jerked beef. Despite the name, nothing is jerked to make jerked beef.

A typical meal might consist of salted beef with potatoes and peas, followed by baked or fried eggs, fish and salad, with a variety of sweets, puddings, cheeses and pastries to finish, all washed down with quantities of alcohol that would leave most of us today unable to rise from the table. Meat was consumed in quantities that left European observers slack-jawed in astonishment. By the early 1800s the average American was eating almost 180 lb. of meat a year, 48 lb. more than people were consuming a century later, but fresh meat remained largely unknown because of the difficulty of keeping it fresh. Even city people often had chickens in the yard and a hog or two left to scavenge in the street. Until well into the nineteenth century visitors to New York remarked on the hazard to traffic presented by wandering hogs along Broadway. Even in the more temperate north, meat would go off in a day in summer, and milk would curdle in as little as an hour. Spoiled food was a daily hazard for the wealthy as much as for the poor. One guest at a dinner party given by the Washingtons noted with a certain vicious relish that the General discreetly pushed his plate of sherry trifle to one side when he discovered that the cream was distinctly iffy but that the less discerning Martha continued shovelling it away with gusto.

By the 1920s several companies were mass-producing shiny, purpose-built restaurants known everywhere as diners. From a business point of view diners were an appealing proposition. They were cheap to buy and maintain. You could set them up in hours on any level piece of ground, and if trade didn\x{2019}t materialize you loaded them on to a flat-bed truck and moved them elsewhere.

            'Saloon, in the sense of a place to drink, is not recorded until <<1848|9c:0>>, though, oddly, saloon-keeper goes back to the eighteenth century. From the French salon, it originally signified any large hall or other public gathering place. Bootleg, first used in 1855, comes from the American West. According to Dillard, enterprising traders sold liquor illegally to the Indians by putting it in a flat bottle that they could slip into their boot.I have no grounds to dispute this, but it does seem to me evident that the amount of liquor one could transport in this way would be hardly worth the bother. Certainly there must have been more commodious places to hide illicit alcohol on any wagon. I suspect the term may be metaphorical.',

            'Rotgut, often shortened to rot, dates from <<1819|9c:0>>. Those who drank too much would get the jitters, or shakes. For a time strong drink was known as jitter sauce, and one who took to it too heartily was a jitterbug, a sense resurrected by Cab Calloway in 1934 for a type of dance music. Chronic drinkers faced the prospect of ending up on skid road, a term that comes from western logging camps, where logs were slid down a track called a skid road. Eventually the word was transferred to the shanty towns that grew up near by and, misheard by easterners, was transliterated into skid row.',

            "Wine growers to their dismay were reduced to producing harmless grape concentrate, which of course almost no one wanted. They recovered their composure, and their fortunes, when they discovered that there was nothing illegal about pasting a prominent label on each bottle announcing boldly, \x{2018}WARNING: WILL FERMENT AND TURN INTO WINE\x{2019}, and providing step-by-step instructions on how a careless consumer might inadvertently convert this healthful beverage into something with the power to make his legs wobble. Sacramental wine, excluded ftom the strictures of the Eighteenth Amendment, also showed a curious leap in sales, with some cynics suggesting that not all of it \x{2013} or even much of it \x{2013} was ending up in devout stomachs. In the years 1925 to 1939 American wine consumption actually trebled, and California\x{2019}s vineyards expanded from less than 100,000 acres before Prohibition to almost 700,000 acres afterwards. Seldom has any law anywhere led to greater hypocrisy or been more widely flouted. People not only continued to drink, but in greater numbers than ever. Before Prohibition New York had 15,000 legal saloons; by the end of Prohibition it had over 30,000 illegal ones. Detroit had no fewer than 20,000 speakeasies, as illegal drinking establishments became rather curiously known. Boston was rather primmer with just 4,000 illicit watering holes, but that was four times the number of legal saloons in the whole of Massachusetts before Prohibition. Hardly anyone took the law seriously. In 1930, a journalist testified to the House Judiciary Committee that he had attended a lively party at a Detroit roadhouse where he had seen the Governor of Michigan, the chief of police of Detroit, and four circuit court judges drinking lavishly and enjoying the entertainment of a troupe of young ladies who were dancing the hootchy-kootchy (another new word of the age, based on the earlier coochee-coochee) without benefit of clothing. They couldn\x{2019}t even have been wearing G-strings since this device of minimal attire would not become known to strippers until <<1936|9c:0>>. Although the term is often said to have arisen as a jocular allusion to the thinness of the G-string on a violin, it actually has a more noble pedigree. In the nineteenth century it described the leather string Indians employed to hold up their loincloths and was spelled geestring (probably a folk translation of a more complicated, and now forgotten, Indian term).",

However, Cullen did offer several features that would become standard in the business \x{2013} evening opening, self-service, strident advertising, and a practically irresistible impulse to put a misspelled word in the title. He called it King Kullen. The first company to use the word supermarket in its title appears to have been Albers Super Mkts., Inc., of Cincinnati, which registered the name in 1933. The same decade saw the development of an appliance to help shoppers deal with the increasing volume of goods on offer: the shopping trolley. Although a grocery store in Houston had for years been offering its customers the use of children\x{2019}s wagons with a basket attached to help them manage their purchases, it wasn\x{2019}t until <<1936|18:0>> when a store owner in Oklahoma City named Sylvan Goldman invented the modern shopping trolley which he called a basket carrier that bulk-buying became a possibility.

Not until <<1910|18:0>> did it come to signify a warm-up area for pitchers. Fans in the sense of enthusiasts is presumed to be a shortening of fanatics, but the conclusion is only speculative.

            "At the time that football was rising to eminence in colleges, another perennially popular sport was taking shape. In the fall of 1891, a young Canadian named James Naismith had just joined the staff of the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he was instructed to devise an indoor game that didn\x{2019}t involve bodily contact, would not result in damage to the gym, and in which every player had a chance to get in on the action. The game he invented was basketball \x{2013} or basket ball as it was called until <<about 1912|9c:0>>. Naismith hung peach baskets at either end of the gym and used a soccer ball for play. The first game, in December 1891, involved two teams of nine men each and was not exactly a barn burner. The final score was 1-0.",

Within three years, a company was producing balls specifically for the sport and many of the nuances of play had already evolved. For instance, in 1893 came the free throw \x{2013} or free trial for goal as it was at first called. Five players to a side became standard in 1895, but the names of the positions \x{2013} centre, two forwards and two guards \x{2013} weren\x{2019}t fixed until the 1920s.

They were largely self-contained communities, and often the sites of noxious enterprises that were ill suited to the confined spaces of cities.",

Only by taking exacting measurements were the police able to discover, after six hours of searching, a cavity behind an upstairs wall. There they found nine goose-pimpled, mostly naked women.
