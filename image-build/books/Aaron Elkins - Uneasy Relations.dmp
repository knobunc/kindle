In a leather-clad, stainless-steel flask in his attach\x{e9} case, Gideon knew, was a pint of Tullamore Dew Irish whiskey, the day\x{2019}s (but not the evening\x{2019}s) supply. Gideon had never seen him drunk, nor heard tales of binges from others (and academics are eager tale-tellers), but he\x{2019}d never seen him wholly sober either. He drank from the time he got up\x{2014}Gideon had been at a <<seven A.M.|5>> conference breakfast with him once, and the flask was already in use, spicing up his coffee\x{2014}until he went to bed. But he did it only a very little at a time, just a few drops, so that there was always alcohol in his system, but never enough to make him even close to tipsy. Whether his typical good humor was whiskey-induced there was no way of knowing, since he was never without the flask.",

Another cruise ship was in port and the streets were again mobbed, but, at <<four o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>>, the restaurant was relatively uncrowded.

            "THE Paleoanthropological Society cocktail reception-cum-book launch party had gotten off to an early start. The Eliott Hotel\x{2019}s rooftop terrace, bathed in mellow, late-afternoon sunshine, was hopping by the time they got there, with knots of attendees chattering away on the wide patio surrounding the outdoor swimming pool. Most had a drink in one hand and a plastic plate piled with food in the other. Those that didn\x{2019}t were either in line at one of the two portable bars, or gathered around food tables near each end of the pool. At <<one|9m:0>>, a blonde woman in a tall white chef\x{2019}s toque carved slices off a giant hunk of roast beef. At the other, an ice swan, dripping wings outstretched, hung over dozens of plates of quintessential ye olde English appetizers: sausage rolls, Scotch eggs, potted cheese toast triangles, miniature Cornish pasties. Waistcoated, bowtied waiters threaded their way smoothly through the crowd with trays of champagne and hors d\x{2019}oeuvres. And in an out-of-the-way corner of the terrace a tuxedoed quartet, sans amplification, was unobtrusively, almost apologetically, tinkling out Boccherini\x{2019}s Minuet in C.",
