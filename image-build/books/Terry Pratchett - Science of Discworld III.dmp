A crucial influence was Thomas Malthus, whose 1826 Essay on the Principle of Population pointed out that the unchecked growth of organisms is exponential (or \x{2018}geometric\x{2019}, in the old-fashioned phrase of the time), whereas that of resources is linear (\x{2018}arithmetic\x{2019}). Exponential growth occurs when each step multiplies the size by some fixed amount, for example 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, where each number is twice the previous one. Linear growth adds some fixed amount at each step, for instance 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, where each number exceeds the previous one by 2. However small the multiplier is in exponential growth, provided it is bigger than 1, and however large the number added in linear growth may be, it turns out that in the long run exponential growth always beats linear. Though it does take some time if the multiplier is close to 1 and the number being added is huge.",

In a population of <<about 1000|18:0>> organisms, they believed, only about a third of the breeding population could be \x{2018}lost\x{2019} to bad gene variants, or could be ousted by organisms carrying better versions, without the population moving towards extinction. They calculated that only about ten genes could have variants (known as \x{2018}alleles\x{2019}) that were increasing or decreasing as proportions of the population. Perhaps twenty genes might be changing in this way if they were not very different in \x{2018}fitness\x{2019} from the regular alleles. This picture of the population implied that almost all organisms in a given species must have pretty much the same genetic make-up, except for a few which carried the good alleles coming in, and winning, or the bad alleles on the way out.1 These exceptions were mutants, famously and stupidly portrayed in many SF films.",
