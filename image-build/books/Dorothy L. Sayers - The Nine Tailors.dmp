            "\x{201c}Not at all, Bunter. It is quite logical. To begin with, it is a fixed idea with the French that the majority of letters tend to be lost in the post. They put no faith in Government departments, and I think they are perfectly right. They hope, however, that, if the post-office fails to deliver the letter to the addressee it may, in time, return it to the sender. It seems a forlorn hope, but they are again perfectly right. One must explore every stone and leave no avenue unturned. The Englishman, in his bluff, hearty way, is content that under such circumstances the post-office should violate his seals, peruse his correspondence, extract his signature and address from the surrounding verbiage, supply a fresh envelope and return the whole to him under the blushing pseudonym of \x{2018}Hubbykins\x{2019} or \x{2018}Dogsbody\x{2019} for the entertainment of his local postman. But the Frenchman, being decorous, not to say secretive, by nature, thinks it better to preserve his privacy by providing, on the exterior of the missive, all the necessary details for the proper functioning of this transaction. I do not say he is wrong, though I do think it would be better if he wrote the address in both places. But the fact that this particular letter provides no address for return does perhaps suggest that the sender was not precisely out for publicity. And the devil of it is, Bunter, that <<ten to one|10a:0>> there will be no address on the inside, either. No matter. This is very excellent port.

Soup and tea were being served in the Lady chapel, babies were crying, the churchyard resounded with the forlorn lowing of cattle and the terrified bleating of sheep. Sides of bacon were being carried in, and thirty waggon-loads of hay and corn were ranged under the church wall. In the only clear space amid the confusion the Rector stood behind the rails of the Sanctuary. And over all, the bells tumbled and wrangled, shouting their alarm across the country.

Wimsey, knowing that the Rector was well set for the next quarter of an hour, was seized with a fancy to listen to the peal from outside. He slipped down the winding stair and groped his way through the south porch. As he emerged into the night, the clamour of the bells smote on his ears like a blow. The snow was falling less heavily now. He turned to his right, knowing that it is unlucky to walk about a church widdershins, and followed the path close beneath the wall till he found himself standing by the west door. Sheltered by the towering bulk of the masonry, he lit a sacrilegious cigarette, and, thus fortified, turned right again. Beyond the foot of the tower, the pathway ended, and he stumbled among grass and tombstones for the whole length of the aisle, which, on this side, was prolonged to the extreme east end of the church. Midway between the last two buttresses on the north side he came upon a path leading to a small door; this he tried, but found it locked, and so passed on, encountering the full violence of the wind as he rounded the east end. Pausing a moment to get his breath, he looked out over the Fen. All was darkness, except for a dim stationary light which might have been shining from some cottage window. Wimsey reckoned that the cottage must lie somewhere along the solitary road by which they had reached the Rectory, and wondered why anybody should be awake at <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>> on New Year\x{2019}s morning. But the night was bitter and he was wanted back at his job. He completed his circuit, re-entered by the south porch and returned to the belfry. The Rector resigned the rope to him, warning him that he had now to make his two blows behind and not to forget to dodge back into eight\x{2019}s place before hunting down.",

Still, there the station is; moreover, there is a church with a respectable fourteenth-century tower, a rather remarkable rood-screen, a Norman apse and a ring of <<eight bells|15>>. Fenchurch St. Paul is the smallest village, and has neither river nor railway; it is, however, the oldest; its church is by far the largest and the noblest, and its bells beyond question the finest.

Fortunately the man before us was conscientious and did his repairs properly, but he was very Low and allowed all manner of things that quite shocked us. This beautiful chapel, for instance, would you believe that he allowed it to be used for furnace-coke? Of course, we had all that cleared out. Theodore would like a lady-altar here, but we\x{2019}re afraid the parishioners would think it popish. Yes\x{2014}it\x{2019}s a magnificent window, isn\x{2019}t it? Later than the rest, of course, but so fortunate that it\x{2019}s kept its old glass. We were so afraid when the Zeppelins came over. You know, they dropped a bomb at Walbeach, only twenty miles off, and it might just as easily have been here. Isn\x{2019}t the parclose lovely? Like lace, I always think. The tombs belong to the Gaudy family. They lived here up to Queen Elizabeth\x{2019}s time, but they\x{2019}ve all died out now. You\x{2019}ll find the name on the Treble bell: GAUDE, GAUDY, DOMINI IN LAUDE. There used to be a chantry on the north side, corresponding to this: Abbot Thomas\x{2019} chantry, it was, and that\x{2019}s his tomb. Batty Thomas is named after him\x{2014}a corruption of \x{2018}Abbot,\x{2019} of course. Some vandal in the nineteenth century tore down the screen behind the choir stalls to put the organ in. It\x{2019}s a hideous thing, isn\x{2019}t it? We put in a new set of pipes a few years ago, and now the bellows want enlarging. Poor Potty has his work cut out to keep the windchest filled when Miss Snoot is using the full organ. They all call him Potty Peake, but he\x{2019}s not really potty, only a little lacking, you know. Of course, the angel-roof is our great show-piece\x{2014}I think myself it\x{2019}s even lovelier than the ones at March or Needham Market, because it has all the original colouring. At least, we had it touched up here and there about twelve years back, but we didn\x{2019}t add anything. It took ten years to persuade the churchwardens that we could put a little fresh gold-leaf on the angels without going straight over to Rome, but they\x{2019}re proud of it now. We hope to do the chancel roof too, one day. All these ribs ought to be painted, you can still see traces of colour, and the bosses ought to be gilt. The east window is Theodore\x{2019}s b\x{ea}te noire. That dreadful crude glass\x{2014}<<about 1840|18:0>>, I think it is. Quite the worst period, Theodore says. The glass in the nave has all gone, of course\x{2014}Cromwell\x{2019}s men. Thank goodness they left part of the clerestory. I suppose it was rather a job to get up there. The pews are modern; Theodore got them done ten years ago. He\x{2019}d have preferred chairs, but the congregation wouldn\x{2019}t have liked it, being used to pews, and he had them copied from a nice old design that wasn\x{2019}t too offensive. The old ones were terrible\x{2014}like bathrooms\x{2014}and there was a frightful gallery along both sides, blocking the aisle windows completely and ruining the look of the pillars. We had that taken down at the same time. It wasn\x{2019}t needed, and the school-children would drop hymn-books and things on people\x{2019}s heads. Now, the choir-stalls are different. They are the original monks\x{2019} stalls, with misereres. Isn\x{2019}t the carving fine? There\x{2019}s a piscina in the sanctuary, but not a very exciting one.\x{201d}",
