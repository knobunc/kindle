            'The question, paradoxically, made it easier to keep going. "It\'s true I can lift a passenger or maybe a hundred pounds of cargo, sir, but dropping stuff-anything I drop means taking a hand off the controls and changing the center of gravity, and that\'s just asking for trouble. I can dump a well-packaged box of paper off the passenger seat and hit a courtyard, sure, but a twohundred-pound bomb? That\'s a different matter. Even if I could figure out a way to rig it so I could drop it without tearing the wing off or stalling, I\'d have to be high enough up that the shrapnel doesn\'t reach me, and fast enough to clear the blast radius, and the Saber\'s got a top speed of only fifty-five, so I\'d have to drop it from high up, so I\'d need some kind of bombsight-and they don\'t sell them down at Wal-Mart. Sorry. I can drop grenades or flares, and given a tool shop and some help we might even be able to bolt an M249 to the trike, but that\'s all. In terms of military aviation we\'re somewhere round <<about 1913|18:0>>, unless you\'ve got something squirreled away somewhere that I don\'t know about."',

It's like, <<after 1945|9:0>>, the government pretended for a few years that making nuclear weapons was some kind of big secret. Then the Russians got the bomb, and the Brits, and the Chinese, and before you can blink we're worrying about the North Koreans, or the Iranians. What the Clan Council needs to worry about is the US government-who they've spent the past few decades systematically getting mad at them-and who now know we exist. What do you think?\"",

The occasional crack of heavy-caliber gunfire, punctuated by the boom of a black-powder cannon, split the nighttime quiet outside the castle walls.

Mike passed it by, continuing his search. It would be perfectly obvious what he was doing, and there was no point in showing any sign of having discovered the camera.

He leaned towards the latter case (keeping a watch on an apartment was an expensive business, requiring at least six full-time agents on rotation) but he had to assume the former, especially if Dr. James considered him unsound. He could have farmed it out to Internal Affairs, told them I\'m suspected of espionage, he thought bleakly.
