And evere the hyer that he is in ordre, the gretter is the synne. / The thynges that gretly agreggen hire synne is the brekynge of hire avow of chastitee, whan they receyved the ordre. / And fortherover, sooth is that hooly ordre is chief of al the tresorie of God, and his especial signe and mark of chastitee, to shewe that they been joyned to chastitee, which that is moost precious lyf that is. / And thise ordred folk been specially titled to God, and of the special meignee of God, for which whan they doon deedly synne, they been the special traytours of God and of his peple; for they lyven of the peple to preye for the peple, and whyle they been suche traitours hire preyers availen nat to the peple. / Preestes been aungeles, as by the dignitee of hir mysterye, but for sothe, Seint Paul seith that Sathanas transformeth hym in an aungel of light. / Soothly, the preest that haunteth deedly synne, he may be likned to the aungel of derknesse transformed in the aungel of light \x{2013} he semeth aungel of light but for sothe he is aungel of derknesse. / Swiche preestes been the sones of Helie, as sheweth in the Book of Kynges that they weren the sones of Belial, that is the devel. / Belial is to seyn \x{203a}withouten juge,\x{2039} and so faren they. Hem thynketh they been free and han no juge, namore than hath a free bole that taketh which cow that hym liketh in the town. / So faren they by wommen. For right as a free bole is ynough for al a town, right so is a wikked preest corrupcioun ynough for al a parisshe or for al a contree. / Thise preestes, as seith the book, ne konne nat the mysterie of preesthode to the peple, ne God ne knowe they nat. They ne holde hem nat apayd, as seith the book, of soden flesh that was to hem offred but they tooke by force the flessh that is rawe. / Certes, so thise shrewes ne holden hem nat apayed of roosted flessh and sode flessh with which the peple fedden hem in greet reverence, but they wole have raw flessh of folkes wyves and hir doghtres. / And certes, thise wommen that consenten to hire harlotrie doon greet wrong to Crist and to Hooly Chirche and alle halwes and to alle soules, for they bireven alle thise hym that sholde worshipe Crist and Hooly Chirche and preye for Cristene soules. / And therfore han swiche preestes, and hire lemmanes eek that consenten to hir leccherie, the malisoun of al the court Cristiene, til they come to amendement. / The thridde spece of avowtrie is somtyme bitwixe a man and his wyf; and that is whan they take no reward in hire assemblynge, but oonly to hire flesshly delit, as seith Seint Jerome, / and ne rekken of nothyng but that they been assembled.

This synne maketh hem lyk to houndes that taken no kepe to kynrede. /And certes, parentele is in two maneres, outher goostly or flesshly. Goostly as for to deelen with his godsibbes, / for right so as he that engendreth a child is his flesshly fader, right so is his godfader his fader espiritueel. For which a womman may in no lasse synne assemblen with hire godsib than with hir owene flesshly brother. / The fifthe spece is thilke abhomynable synne of which that no man unnethe oghte speke ne write, nathelees it is openly reherced in hooly writ. / This cursednesse doon men and wommen in diverse entente and in diverse manere. But though that hooly writ speke of horrible synne, certes, hooly writ may nat been defouled namore than the sonne that shyneth on the mixne. / Another synne aperteneth to leccherie that comth in slepynge, and this synne cometh ofte to hem that been maydenes, and eek to hem that been corrupt, and this synne men clepen polucioun, that comth in foure maneres. /Somtyme of langwissynge of body, for the humours been to ranke and habundaunt in the body of man.
