There is no truth, for example, in the widely held belief that it was once used to hide the taste of putrefying meat; this charming thought perhaps derives from the equally delightful notion, still recognized by pharmacists today, that pepper can be used as a carminative, a potion that expels entrapped flatulence. But it was very much used as a preservative, and more commonly still as a seasoning. By the tenth century it was being imported into England; the Guild of Pepperers, one of the most ancient of London's city guilds, was established at least before 1180, which was when the body was first recorded (they were in court for some minor infraction); by <<1328|9:0>> the Guild had been formally registered as an importer of spices in large, or gross, amounts: its members were called grossarii, from which comes the modern word \x{2018}grocer\x{2019}.

On 26 November, for example, he painted the aftermath of the sun's disappearance once every ten minutes between <<4.10 p.m.|2a>> and <<5.15 p.m.|2a>>, catching a sequence of fiery purples and oranges with all the fleet-footed accuracy of a film camera. He wrote lengthy notes and analyses of what he saw \x{2013} \x{2018}Blood Afterglows' and \x{2018}Amber Afterglows\x{2019} among them \x{2013} and examples of the beaming coronas that often surrounded the setting sun itself and which were named, after the Hawaiian naturalist * who first spotted them, \x{2018}Bishop's Rings\x{2019}. All 500 of his paintings later went on show at an exhibition in a museum in South Kensington. They remain today inside what is now the Natural History Museum, locked away and half forgotten.",

            "This idea, that volcanoes were the consequence of the steady burning of a finite store of earthly combustibles, exerted a grip on the scientific mind for centuries. Then, as chemistry developed as a science, so its innumerable secrets offered themselves as the favoured sources for all the necessary heat, and were widely accepted as doing so. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a great many seers \x{2013} Isaac Newton among them \x{2013} believed that so-called exothermic chemical reactions were the answer. By <<1807|9:0>>, when the Geological Society of London, the world's oldest such body, was founded, the oxidation of newly discovered alkaline metals, such as sodium and potassium, was thought to be an answer.",

There is a grave of a sultan in north Sumatra that dates from <<1211|9c:0>>. There is another, at Gresik in east Java, which sports designs indicating that it was carved by masons from India in 1419. A late-fifteenth-century mosque in Demak, on the north coast of Java about 300 miles east of Batavia, was clearly the result of architectural compromises between Javanese and Arab builders. It had a holiness to it that the local mullahs regarded as both profound and ineffable, and they declared that to visit it seven times \x{2013} though there is no spiritual explanation for the number \x{2013} had the spiritual worth of the single haj pilgrimage to Mecca.",
