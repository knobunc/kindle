            "It was the dead center of winter when I left New York; in Naples it was warm and gummy, and from my plane I could see thick thunderclouds trolling along the edge of the sky. I checked into a big hotel on the beach, and that evening I stood on my balcony and watched the storm explode over the water. The hearing was the next morning at <<nine|9c:1>>. As I pulled out of the hotel garage the parking attendant warned me to drive carefully. \x{201c}See, in Naples you got to be careful,\x{201d} he said, leaning in my window. He smelled like daiquiris. It was probably suntan lotion. \x{201c}When it rains here,\x{201d} he added, \x{201c}cars start to fly.\x{201d} There are more golf courses per person in Naples than anywhere else in the world, and in spite of the hot, angry weather everyone around the hotel was dressed to play, their cleated shoes tapping out a clickety-clickety-clickety tattoo on the sidewalks.",

            "People live in the Fakahatchee and around it, but it is an unmistakably inhospitable place. In 1872 a surveyor made this entry in his field notes: \x{201c}A pond, surrounded by bay and cypress swamp, impracticable. Pond full of monstrous alligators. Counted fifty and stopped.\x{201d} In fact, the hours I spent in the Fakahatchee retracing Laroche\x{2019}s footsteps were probably the most miserable I have spent in my entire life. The swampy part of the Fakahatchee is hot and wet and buggy and full of cottonmouth snakes and diamondback rattlers and alligators and snapping turtles and poisonous plants and wild hogs and things that stick into you and on you and fly into your nose and eyes. Crossing the swamp is a battle. You can walk through about as easily as you could walk through a car wash. The sinkholes are filled with as much as seven feet of standing water, and around them the air has the slack, drapey weight of wet velvet. Sides of trees look sweaty. Leaves are slick from the humidity. The mud sucks your feet and tries to keep ahold of them; if it fails it will settle for your shoes. The water in the swamp is stained black with tannin from the bark of cypress trees that is so corrosive it can cure leather. Whatever isn\x{2019}t wet in the Fakahatchee is blasted. The sun pounds the treeless prairies. The grass gets so dry that the friction from a car can set it on fire, and the burning grass can engulf the car in flames. The Fakahatchee used to be littered with burned-up cars that had been abandoned by panfried adventurers\x{2014}a botanist who traveled through in the 1940s recalled in an interview that he was most impressed by the area\x{2019}s variety of squirrels and the number of charred Model T\x{2019}s. The swamp\x{2019}s stillness and darkness and thickness can rattle your nerves. In 1885 a sailor on a plume-collecting expedition wrote in his diary: \x{201c}The place looked wild and lonely. <<About three o\x{2019}clock|6>> it seemed to get on Henry\x{2019}s nerves and we saw him crying, he could not tell us why he was just plain scared.\x{201d}",

            "In 1838 James Boott of London sent a tropical orchid to his brother John Wright Boott of Boston. John Boott liked the orchid so much that he asked his brother to send him more. His brother obliged, and over the next few years Boott built a substantial collection in his Boston home. When he died he willed his collection to John Amory Lowell of Roxbury, Massachusetts, who added even more plants to it, and then in 1853 Lowell sold the whole collection to the tenant in his country residence. The tenant let most of the orchids die. The few survivors were divided among a Miss Pratt of Watertown, Massachusetts, and a Boston man named Edward Rand, who expanded the collection once again, cultivated a cattleya reportedly as large as a small washtub, and then in 1865 sold his estate and donated the collection to Harvard College. This is how tropical orchids came to America. Right off the bat, they had admirers as zealous as their admirers in Europe, and American collectors soon rivaled the English. A collector named Cornelius Van Voorst, of Jersey City, New Jersey, bought his first orchid in 1855, and by <<1857|9e:1>> he had amassed almost three hundred species, including an Ansellia africana that was so large that two men could hardly lift it. General John Rathbone of Albany, New York, started his collection in 1866. He wrote to a friend in 1868: \x{201c}I was so delighted with the plant and flowers that I caught the Orchid fever, which I am happy to say is now prevailing to considerable extent in this country, and which I trust will become epidemic. In 1867, so that I might successfully grow this charming family of plants, I built a house exclusively for Orchids.\x{201d}",

I had gotten to know him well enough by then to know exactly how he\x{2019}d sound and what he\x{2019}d say. No matter the time of day\x{2014}that day I happened to be calling <<around noon|13>>\x{2014}Laroche always answered the phone sounding as if he\x{2019}d been woken up after falling asleep on a couch watching a game show. I don\x{2019}t think I ever actually woke him up. It was just his low, slushy voice and his manner\x{2014}drowsy, cross, suspicious as a tax examiner\x{2019}s. Then, once he would establish that it was me on the phone, his voice would amplify in one blast and he would immediately start complaining that I had broken some promise to call him or see him or meet him somewhere. The complaints were never true. I had nothing else to do while I was in Florida except to follow him around, and besides the obvious fact that he was the whole point of my being in Florida I was very homesick a lot of the time and was always excited and conscientious when I had plans. In fact, Laroche was the one who was always leaving me in the lurch. When I first met him his accusations rattled me, but I had finally persuaded myself to ignore them. That day when I called he managed a muffled hello and then began chiding me for not calling earlier, and when he was done, I told him about the Orchid Society party, and when I was done, he cleared his throat and said, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m going to a little orchid show in Fort Lauderdale this afternoon, if you want to come. It\x{2019}s just a little show, but there will probably be some cute things there,\x{201d} and then he gave me directions to War Memorial Auditorium, where it was being held.",

            "It was illuminating to be with Laroche in a place like this. People noticed him. In appearance he was arresting. He had possibly the most untanned complexion in the state of Florida, and his thinness made his body look as if it stuck in more than out. At the Fort Lauderdale show he was wearing overalls faded almost white that hung off him like laundry on a line. His nearly colorless eyes and toothlessness made him look spectral. People seemed to take to him anyway. He chatted his way around the auditorium. Some people recognized him from the photograph that ran with the story I wrote about him in The New Yorker, so they approached him and said something friendly about it, which pleased him\x{2014}he\x{2019}d answer, \x{201c}Yep, that was me, I\x{2019}m the one who stole all those orchids,\x{201d} and talk proudly about the case. Or he\x{2019}d volunteer comments to the dealers or the spectators, or declare something loudly and profanely, which always got him a look and usually started a conversation. He talked constantly, he knew something about everything or he was very good at faking that he did, he reeled off Latin names and botanical facts and took professorial interest in my learning as we went along. He was an endless puzzlement. I was always surprised by how much people liked him. They liked him in spite of the fact that he is a confirmed misanthrope, and that he has none of the usual traits of popularity\x{2014}conventional good looks, smooth manners, an agreeable temperament\x{2014}and that he has a challenging, slightly obscene sense of humor and the habit of lateness and that he constantly over-promises. They liked him, I think, because he could be as earnest about their concerns as he was about his own, and because his self-confidence was contagious\x{2014}he made people feel that they were innately able to do the right thing. He could even persuade you that the wrong thing was the right thing if it was the only option you had. A few weeks before the Fort Lauderdale show I was staying in West Palm Beach at my parents\x{2019} condominium and wanted to talk to Laroche, so we arranged to meet halfway between West Palm and his house in North Miami. I told him I had to meet early because my mother was in Florida with me and I needed to borrow her car and didn\x{2019}t want to leave her stranded for the day. Laroche insisted that he was always up at dawn and could meet me at <<7:30 A.M.|2a>> or so. He also promised that he would figure out an easy place for our rendezvous and call me in the morning with directions. He even offered to give me a wake-up call. I woke up on my own at <<6:30 A.M.|2a>> and went for a short run around the golf course. I came back and showered and got dressed. At <<10:00 A.M.|2a>> I still hadn\x{2019}t heard from him, so I finally called his house. His dad answered and said John was sleeping and would probably be mad if he woke him up. By the time Laroche called me back it was <<almost 11:00|2>>. Before I had a chance to bawl him out, he announced that he had decided that getting together wasn\x{2019}t a good idea since I was visiting with my mom. \x{201c}I mean, she\x{2019}s your mom and all that,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I mean, that\x{2019}s important. You don\x{2019}t see your mom every day, you know? Look, look, here\x{2019}s what we\x{2019}ll do. I think you should go hang out with your mom, take her out for a nice lunch or brunch, enjoy the day, you call me tomorrow, I\x{2019}ll let you know what\x{2019}s going on, we\x{2019}ll talk, everything will be fine.\x{201d} He was so sure it was the right plan that he convinced me that it was the right plan and probably what I\x{2019}d wanted to do all along.",

            "Fred Fuchs was as good a baker as his father and occasionally helped out at Holsum, but he really preferred to work outside. As soon as he was on his own he became a farmer and an outdoorsman. He raised hogs and grew okra and developed a hardy and delicious species of avocado called the Fuchs Avocado. He liked to hunt in the Everglades with the Seminoles who lived nearby. He was big and strong and fond of eating raw deer meat. He and a few other men\x{2014}Tom Fennell, Sr., Bill Osment, Captain C. C. von Paulsen, Raleigh Burney\x{2014}were the great swamp explorers of their generation and the last generation to have so much of south Florida left to penetrate. Now, especially when I am sitting in line at a tollbooth on the Florida Turnpike, and the tile-roofed town houses spread in every direction look like the world\x{2019}s biggest casserole of scalloped potatoes, I am astounded by the lives of Fred Fuchs and his fellow adventurers\x{2014}that they had lives in which they slept on regular mattresses, had cars, and went to the movies, and yet still could walk just a few miles into the swamps behind their houses and find things never before seen or imagined. In the swamps Fred found many unusual things. In the Fakahatchee he found the cannonball that supposedly killed Chief Tallahassee. In the Everglades he found a recording of \x{201c}Yes, We Have No Bananas\x{201d} in an old Indian camp in an abandoned grove of sugarcane and banana trees. He began collecting orchids <<around 1935|18:0>> and took probably tens of thousands from the swamps, including fifteen or twenty new species. He found and named dozens of new air plant species. He also collected tree snails and trees. He was particularly impressed by royal palm trees, the Fakahatchee\x{2019}s tufty-topped palm that is seen in this country only in south Florida. Because royal palms hardly ever fall down, Fred decided to plant a row of fourteen on his property. In the hurricane of 1945 most of Fred\x{2019}s farm was blown away. He and his wife survived by tying themselves to one of those royal palm trees. In 1947, which came to be known in south Florida as the Year It Wouldn\x{2019}t Stop Raining, gallons of rain fell and washed his farm clean, but Fred didn\x{2019}t lose a single tree.",

            "Instead I went to watch the end of the rodeo. The first night\x{2019}s rodeo had been restricted to Indians, but Saturday night was open to any kind of cowboy or cowgirl, and a lot of the roping teams were made up of one Seminole and one non-Seminole. I watched the team of Wildcat Jumper and Sean John storm around after a thick-necked bull named Jimmy Lee while the sun fell behind the palm trees. I had a long drive ahead of me and it was late, so I watched one more team try to rope a bull named Risky Business and then I walked back to my car. I passed the Seminole Casino on the way, the acres of parking lots with guard towers raised like hackles here and there, the plain gray facade of the casino building. There was not one empty parking spot in the place. It was <<nearly midnight|13>>, but people were still streaming in\x{2014}couples in dinner clothes, a broad-backed older woman with an aluminum walker, a pair of white-blond big-breasted girls in cowboy shirts and boots, a man with thick plastic glasses and the heedful face of a night watchman. The casino wasn\x{2019}t much to look at inside, except for the painting of Chief Billie on the wall with the Seminole greeting \x{201c}Sho-naa-bish\x{201d} in giant script beside him. Otherwise it was a big, quiet cavern with tables and tables of men playing Texas Hold-Em and 7-Card Stud beside a sign that said POKER IS FUN AND RELAXING. The only sound was the clicking of poker chips. It was a room filled with a million precise, intense, noiseless movements, like an operating theater during brain surgery. In another room, hundreds of people seated at long tables were playing bingo. Many of them had collections of lucky totems next to their bingo cards\x{2014}rabbits\x{2019} feet, plastic elephants, statuettes of the Virgin Mary, snapshots, small plush toys, rosaries\x{2014}and they were silent, too, until the man at the head of the room called out \x{201c}B-twenty-three\x{201d} or \x{201c}O-seven,\x{201d} and then there would be a murmur and a shifting, like the sound of water running out of a tub, and when someone yelled out \x{201c}Bingo!\x{201d} there was the sound of hands slapping down on cardboard game cards as the exasperated losers swept their chips away so they could start again. The waiters and the waitresses and the poker dealers and the bingo callers and the valet parkers and the casino cashiers were all white people, all with fluorescent-tinted skin and stiff hairdos, and all the customers were white and some had tourist tans and bloodshot eyes, and even though the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Seminole tribe\x{2019}s annual powwow was being celebrated only a few yards away and the chief of the Seminole tribe was peering down on every single table of Texas Hold-Em and 7-Card Stud, you felt nothing of that world at all in here\x{2014}you felt only the fever and focus of the games and the hard heat of people wanting to win.",

He described his new computer work to me and some new software he was writing that he was convinced would make him rich. As he was talking he saw a car coming in the other direction that reminded him of his mother\x{2019}s car, so he began reminiscing about slogging around the swamp with her and recalled the time they walked through a charred prairie in the Fakahatchee and came upon a single snowy Polyrrhiza lindenii in bloom. The way he recited this made it sound like a fairy tale or Bible story\x{2014}the bleak journey with the radiant finale, the hopeful journey through darkness into light. A more conventional, more comfortable story wouldn\x{2019}t have this rhythm of struggle and victory, and instead it would have had the unswinging tempo of usualness and habit, a kind of deadly incessancy.
