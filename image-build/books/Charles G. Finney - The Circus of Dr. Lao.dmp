            "In the Abalone (Arizona) Morning Tribune for August third there appeared on page five an advertisement eight columns wide and twenty-one inches long. In type faces grading from small pica to ninety-six point the advertisement told of a circus to be held in Abalone that day, the tents to be spread upon a vacant field on the banks of the Santa Ana River, a bald spot in the city's growth surrounded by all manner of houses and habitations.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Floridly worded, the advertisement made claims which even Phineas Taylor Barnum might have hedged at advancing. It alleged for the show's female personnel a pulchritude impossible to equal in any golden age of beauty or physical culture. The mind of man could not conceive of women more beautiful than were the charmers of this circus. Though the whole race of man were bred for feminine beauty as the whole race of Jersey cattle is bred for butterfat, even then lovelier women could not be produced than the ones who graced this show. . . . Nay, these were the most beautiful women of the world; the whole world, not just the world of today, but the world since time began and the world as long as time shall run.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Nor were the wild animals on display at the circus any less sensational than were the girls. Not elephants or tigers or hyenas or monkeys or polar bears or hippopotami; anyone and everyone had seen such as those time after time. The sight of an African lion was as banal today as that of an airplane. But here were animals no man had ever seen before; beasts fierce beyond all dreams of ferocity; serpents cunning beyond all comprehension of guile; hybrids strange beyond all nightmares of fantasy.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Furthermore, the midway of the circus was replete with sideshows wherein were curious beings of the netherworld on display, macabre trophies of ancient conquests, resurrected supermen of antiquity. No glass-blowers, cigarette fiends, or frogboys, but real honest-to-goodness freaks that had been born of hysterical brains rather than diseased wombs.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Likewise, the midway would house a fortuneteller. Not an ungrammatical gypsy, not a fat blonde mumbling silly things about dark men in your life, not a turbaned mystic canting of the constellations; no, this fortuneteller would not even be visible to you, much less take your hand and voice generalities concerning your life lines. Anonymous behind the veil of his mystery he would speak to you and tell you of foreordained things which would come into your life as the years unfolded. And you were warned not to enter his tent unless you truly wanted to know the truth about your future, for never under any conditions did he lie about what was going to happen; nor was it possible for you after learning your future to avert in any way its unpleasant features. He absolutely would not, however, forecast anything of an international or political nature. He was perfectly capable of so doing, of course, but the management had found that such prophecies, inasmuch as they were invariably true, had in the past been used to unfair and dishonorable advantage by unscrupulous financiers and politicians: that which had been meant for mankind had been converted to personal gain \x{2014} which was not ethical.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}And for men only there was a peepshow. It was educational rather than pornographic. It held no promise of hermaphroditic goats or randy pony stallions lusting after women. Nor any rubberstamp striptease act. But out of the erotic dramas and dreams of long-dead times had been culled a figure here, an episode there, a fugitive vision elsewhere, all of which in combination produced an effect that no ordinary man for a long series of days would forget or, for that matter, care to remember too vividly. Because of the unique character of this segment of the circus, attendance would be limited to men over twenty-one, married men preferred; and absolutely no admittance to any man under the influence of liquor.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}In the main tent the circus performance proper, itself diverting beyond description with colorful acts and remarkable scenes, would end with a formidable spectacle. Before your eyes would be erected the long-dead city of Woldercan and the terrible temple of its fearful god Yottle. And before your eyes the ceremony of the living sacrifice to Yottle would be enacted: a virgin would be sanctified and slain to propitiate this deity who had endured before Bel-Marduk even, and was the first and mightiest and least forgiving of all the gods. Eleven thousand people would take part in the spectacle, all of them dressed in the garb of ancient Woldercan. Yottle himself would appear, while his worshipers sang the music of the spheres. Thunder and lightning would attend the ceremonies, and possibly a slight earthquake would be felt. All in all it was the most tremendous thing ever to be staged under canvas.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Admission 10\x{a2} to the circus grounds proper, 25\x{a2} admission to the big top; children in arms free. l0\x{a2} admission to the sideshows, 50\x{a2} admission to the peepshow. Parade at <<11 A.M.|5>> Midway open at <<2 P.M.|5>> Main show starts at <<2:45|9g>>. Evening performance at <<8|9c:0>>. Come one, come all. The greatest show on earth.",

Behind one of his ears a pimple loomed temptingly, ripe for a squeezing. His hair was dryish and thinnish and untidy and brownish and needed further combing. His flesh was the flesh of one neither young nor old, but more old than young, more repulsive than tempting. Cannibals might have eaten him; shipwrecked mariners never. An undiscerning woman might have loved him; a cinema queen never. He wasn't a very good traffic officer; he might have made a failure of the insurance business. Heaven perhaps could comfort him; this world never. His two young sons sometimes would wonder how his hands would look in handcuffs, his feet in ballet slippers, his nose in a stein of beer. He read the ad uneasily, remarking to his wife petulantly:

            "At <<quarter to eleven|10>> Miss Agnes Birdsong, high-school English teacher, was down on Main Street waiting for the parade and feeling a little foolish. She felt even more foolish when she saw what a silly little parade it turned out to be. But she looked pretty standing in the shade in her flimsy summer dress; she looked pretty, and she knew it, and she kept on standing there and watching.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}She couldn't quite identify the animals at first. Then she said to herself: \"Of course, that thing's a unicorn.\" Then she remembered that unicorns were figments of the imagination. \"It's a fake,\" she corrected herself.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}She regarded the snake with a slight feeling of illness. She hated snakes anyway; this huge grey yellow-tongued worm with scarlet throat and jeweled eyes bothered her and frightened her. Suppose it should get loose. Of course, it was penned in there, but suppose it should get loose. How terrible. The grinning old Chinaman, noting her concern, reached around behind him with his whip handle and prodded the serpent. It hissed like a truck tire going flat and shifted its slimy coils.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Miss Agnes shuddered.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Then she saw the sphinx and the old bearded man driving it and the man in the cage on the wagon. The old bearded man was wool-gathering; the reins lay listless in his hands; his thoughts, far away from Abalone and the business of driving in the parade, played gently in some stray corner of the universe of his mind. The sphinx, noting its driver's inattention, took the bit in its teeth, gave a sluggish leap, and almost snapped the reins from the old fellow's grasp.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Pay attention to your business, Apollonius,\" snarled the sphinx.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Miss Agnes Birdsong nearly sat down on the sidewalk in amazement. She looked at the people around her, but they seemed not to have heard a word. Miss Agnes touched her pulse and her brow. \"I am a calm, intelligent girl,\" she said firmly. \"I am a calm, intelligent girl.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Then the last wagon came along drawn by the golden ass, driven by the clovenfooted satyr. A little gold ring was in the satyr's nose; beside him on the seat was his syrinx. To Miss Agnes he smelled like a goat. His torso was lean as a marathon runner's; his hoofs were stained grass-green. A grape leaf was caught in his hair. He leered at Miss Agnes; he shielded his eyes with his hand and leered at her. He turned in his seat and stared back at her, staring and staring as though out of his accumulation of years he could remember nothing to compare with her.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I am a calm, intelligent girl,\" Miss Agnes reassured herself. \"I am a calm, intelligent girl, and I have not seen Pan on Main Street. Nevertheless, I will go to the circus and make sure.\"",

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The city editor gave him one. \"Old Chink brought 'em in this morning. Funny old bird. Spoke good English. Didn't want any free publicity for his show or anything. Said he understood it was customary for newspaper men to get in at all the shows and entertainments for nothing anyway, so he was bringing around a few passes to save trouble out at the grounds. Oh, by the way, Etaoin, did you see the parade this morning? I missed it, but from what I've heard it was a kinda screwy thing.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"It was unusual rather than screwy,\" said Etaoin. \"Did you hear anything about a bear that looked like a man?\"

He had a pass good for everything anyway; there was no profit in not using it to the uttermost; no sense in not squeezing from it everything gratis that could be squeezed. Money was made to buy things with, but passes were designed to take you places for nothing. The freedom of the press.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}It was hot as he walked through the streets of Abalone. Etaoin reflected how much better it was to have it so hot rather than correspondingly cold \x{2014} it would be way below zero. Overcoats. Mufflers. Overshoes. Eartabs.

The only snow he ever wanted to see again was the snow in newsreels. He wiped the perspiration from his brow and crossed to the shady side of the street. On the telephone wires birds perched, their bills hanging open in the terrific heat. Heat waves like cellophane contours writhed from building roofs.

            "Miss Agnes Birdsong, high-school English teacher, arrived at the circus grounds <<ten minutes after two|10>>. She neatly parked her neat little coup\x{e9} alongside the curb on the opposite side of the street, raised the windows, got out, locked the doors, and walked across the street to the multitude of tents.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}On a platform in front of one of the tents the old bearded man who had been wool-gathering while he drove in the parade that morning was doing the ballyhooing. It was the poorest ballyhoo speech Miss Agnes had ever heard in all her life, and she had heard some terrible ones. The old man spoke in a thin, weak voice, apparently extemporaneously, for he often had to stop and think what to say next. He was talking about the sideshows:

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\". . . 'nd in that tent over there, the third one after the big one, you people will see the chimera, a very curious beast. I don't suppose any of you people know what a chimera is, but it doesn't matter; go and look at him anyway. He can't hurt you, of course; being penned up that way for so long has gentled his nature. I think he's shedding now, that is, the lion part of him is shedding, so he won't look so glossy, but you can still tell what he is, of course. And Doctor Lao will be around there somewhere to answer any questions you may want to ask regarding the chimera. A very curious beast. I understand they are very nearly extinct. I can't think where the doctor got this one. In the next tent is the werewolf, I believe; yes, the werewolf is in the next tent to the chimera. You all know what a werewolf is, I assume. Very interesting beast, indeed. Later on, in the month of October, it becomes a woman for six weeks. Period of metamorphosis is curious to watch. Too bad it isn't changing form now. Know you people would like to see a wolf change into a woman. We feed it lamb chops as a rule. However, Doctor Lao will tell you all about it over in the tent. He has a very interesting lecture on the werewolf, I understand. Really must listen to it myself sometime. I don't know a great deal about the beast, to be perfectly frank. Then, in another tent is the medusa. I myself perform magic tricks in the tent across the way. And, let me see, I'm sure you people would be interested in seeing the mermaid, because in this desert country away from the sea, these ocean-dwelling creatures are bound to be unusual. Then, too, there is the hound of the hedges, which probably you have never seen, because it is indigenous to grasslands and weed patches and hedgerows and the like. The show for men only is in the last tent. I imagine the fertility dance of the Negro priests will start presently. Of course, that tent is for men only.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"So glad to see so many of you people here this afternoon, and I am sure that Doctor Lao is likewise pleased. He went to a great deal of trouble to collect all these animals, and I know you will all be interested in the strange animals. Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you about the roc's egg. It's in another tent back there, I'm not sure just which one. It's a great big egg, big as a house almost, and sweats salt water. I'm sure you good people will be interested in seeing the roc's egg. Doctor Lao will give a lecture on it in the tent. I think it's the third tent there, but I'm not sure. I really must, I suppose, familiarize myself more with the position of the various exhibits. Well, I suppose you are all tired of hearing me talk and want to go look at the shows. Remember, I perform my magic in the tent just across the way.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The old man climbed painfully and slowly off the platform and pushed his way through the crowd to the tent where he did his magic. A few people followed in after him. Miss Agnes Birdsong stood undecided. Then out of the corner of her right eye she saw the old Chinaman scuttling along with a pot of tea in his hand and a pipe of opium in his mouth. She halted him.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Doctor Lao?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Yes, lady.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Where is the tent with Pan?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"We do not have Pan in this circus, lady. What you are thinking of, no doubt, is the satyr who drove for us in the parade this morning. He is in that tent over there. Admission is ten cents. If you wish to see him, just pay me here and go right in. We are a little short-handed on ticket-takers at present.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Miss Agnes gave the Chinaman two nickels and, assuring herself she was a calm, intelligent girl, entered the tent to see the satyr.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}He lay scratching himself on a rack of grapevines, his thin, wispy beard all messy with wine lees. His hoofs were incrusted with manure, and his hands were bony, gnarled and twisted, brown and rough and long-nailed. Between his horns was a bald spot surrounded by greying curly hair. His ears were sharp-pointed, and lean, thin muscles crawled over his arms. The goat hair hid the muscles of his legs. His ribs stuck out. His shoulders hunched about his ears.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}He grinned at Miss Agnes, took up his syrinx, and started to play. Thin reedy piping music danced in the dull air in the dark tent. He arose and danced to his own music, his goat tail jerking shortly, prodding stiffly, wagging and snapping. His feet did a jig, the clicking hoofs keeping time to his piping, pounding the dirt floor, clacking, clicking, clucking. The goaty smell grew stronger.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Miss Agnes stood there assuring herself she was a calm, intelligent girl. The satyr capered around her, tossing his pipes, tossing his head, wriggling his hips, waggling his elbows. The syrinx peep, peep, peepled. The door of the tent fell shut. Around Miss Agnes the aged goat man galloped. His petulant piping screeched in her ears like the beating of tinny bells; it brought a nervousness that shook her and made her blood pump. Her veins jumping with racing blood, she trembled as Grecian nymphs had trembled when the same satyr, twenty centuries younger, had danced and played for them. She shook and watched him. And the syrinx peep, peep, peepled.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}He danced closer, his whirling elbows touching with their points her fair bare arms, his shaggy thighs brushing against her dress. Behind his horns little musk sacs swelled and opened, thick oily scented stuff oozing out \x{2014} a prelude to the rut. He trod on her toe with one hoof; the pain welled up to her eyes, and tears came. He pinched her thigh as he scampered around her. The pinch hurt, but she found that pain and passion were akin. The smell of him was maddening. The tent reeked with his musk. She knew that she was sweating, that globules of sweat ran down from under her arms and dampened her bodice. She knew that her legs were shiny with sweat. The satyr danced on stiff legs about her, his bony chest swelling and collapsing with his blowing. He bounded on stiff legs; he threw the syrinx away in a far corner; and then he seized her. He bit her shoulders, and his nails dug into her thighs. The spittle on his lips mingled with the perspiration around her mouth, and she felt that she was yielding, dropping, swooning, that the world was spinning slower and slower, that gravity was weakening, that life was beginning.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Then the door of the tent opened and Doctor Lao came in.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"The satyr,\" he said, \"is perhaps the most charming figure in the old Greek polytheistic mythology. Combining the forms of both man and goat, its make-up suggests fertility, inasmuch as both men and goats are animals outstanding in concupiscent activities. To the Greeks satyrs were, indeed, a sort of deification of lust, woodland deities, sylvan demigods. And, as a matter of fact, groves and woodlots are today favorite trysting places for lovers intent on escaping censorious eyes.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"We caught this fellow near the town of Tu-jeng in North China close to the Great Wall. We caught him in a net by a little waterfall, a net which we had set for a chimera. Incidentally, although we did not know it at that time, it is impossible to catch a chimera in a net by reason of its fiery breath, which burns up the meshes. But more of that later.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Satyrs are not omnivorous like man, but rather herbivorous like the goat. We feed this fellow nuts and berries and herbs. He will also eat lettuces and some cabbage. He has always refused onions and garlic seed, however. And he drinks nothing but wine.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Notice that he has a gold ring in his nose. I cannot account for it. It was there when we first captured him, but I do not know how it got there.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Note also that this satyr is a very old one. I doubt not that he is one of the original satyrs of ancient Hellas. Obviously, being half-gods, satyrs live a long, long time. I place this fellow's age at nearly two thousand three hundred years, although Apollonius, my colleague, is inclined to grant him even more. If he could talk, he might tell us some very curious things about his existence. How the encroachment of the hostile Christian deity drove him and his kind out of the Hellenic hills to seek refuge in unamiable lands. How some of his relatives went north into Europe to become strange gods, like Adonis becoming Balder, or Circe becoming one of the Lorelei, or the Lares Domestici becoming cuckoo clocks and mantel statuettes. Yes, he could tell much, I fancy.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"But most interesting of all would be the narration of his own journey into China, his bewilderment at the lacquer temples and prayer wheels, his disgust at the hot spiced Chinese wines, and his sadness at the footbound Chinese maidens who could not dance to his piping. Hey, the forlorn, lost demigod.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Satyrs originated, I fancy, back in the old pastoral days when men stayed out in the hills with their flocks for long periods of time. Among other things, to amuse themselves and soothe their flocks, the shepherds would play on pipes such as this fellow has here with him. And, doubtless too, on the hills at night by their fires the shepherds would dream of love. Men do dream of love, you know; lonely men do. Well, they would dream of love, and their dreams would be of such potency that their very flocks would be colored by them. In the moonlight's magic, perhaps, a she-goat would be transformed into a charming girl. . . . And then in lambing time a strange, wee fellow would be seen cavorting among the woolly babies. On his brow he bears his mother's horns; his feet are hoofed like hers; but for the rest he is a man. He grows up to become scornful of the stodgy sheep and goats and shy of man. He steals his father's lute and skips away. Simple folk see him at dusk by a lakeside, and a new pastoral god is born. . . .

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"The satyr sits by some mirrored lake and plays, and even the little fishes swarm about and mimic a dance, for the music of the satyr's pipes is irresistible. He plays on his pipes, and the leaves on the trees dance, and the worms stick their heads out of their holes and writhe, and under the rocks scorpion hugs scorpion in hot, orgiastic bliss. . . . And, by and by, a nymph comes shyly to peep through the vines. . . .

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"But that was a long time ago, and this is an old, old satyr. I doubt if he could do anything like that now. Let us go on to the next tent and see the sea serpent. This way, please.\"",

            '[> 14:00] The Circus of Dr. Lao - Charles G. Finney.epub (OEBPS/Text/Section002.xhtml) - a little after two that afternoon',
            "The whole Rogers family came to the circus grounds <<a little after two that afternoon|9h>>. The children were excited because they were about to see the circus; the mother was buoyant because her husband had a job again.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Now I ain't got a heck of a lot of money,\" said Papa, \"but we can see a sideshow or two, I reckon, and then go on into the main show. What sideshow do you kids want to see first?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Unable to make up their minds, the children wrangled peevishly among themselves.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Tell you what,\" said Mrs. Rogers after listening to them for a while; \"let's go see that bear or man or Russian or whatever it is. I really would like to see it just to find out why it causes so many arguments.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Plumber John agreed; the family went in search of the bear tent. They couldn't find it. Then Doctor Lao came out on the platform again, recited his poem again, and started to talk about the show again.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}John Rogers went up beside the platform and called to him: \"Say, doc, where do you all keep the big bear at? We want to see it again. The one that was in the parade this morning.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Me no savvee bear business,\" said the doctor and plunged on in his speech:

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"In the tent to the right, ladies and gentlemen, you will find that world-famous thaumaturgist, Apollonius of Tyana, born contemporary with Christ. 'Socrates,' they used to say, 'leaves men on the earth, Apollonius transports them to heaven; Socrates is but a sage. Apollonius is a god.' Well, he's over there in the next tent ready to perform a miracle or two for your edification. You will find him an old, old man. He has been alive since the Christian era began, and his years are beginning to show on him. Also, he has but recently learned English; bear with him there and do not laugh at his mistakes. Remember, he is the man who remained silent for five whole years listening to the counsel of his heart, the man who conversed with the astrologers of Chaldea and told them things they had never dreamed, the man who prophesied the death of the Emperor Domitian, the man who underwent the eighty tests of Mithra. In the tent to the right, ladies and gentlemen. Ten cents admission. Children in arms free.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Hey, doc,\" said Plumber Rogers again, \"whereabouts is the big bear? We all wanta see it again.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Me no savvee bear business,\" said Doctor Lao and continued:

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"In this tent to my left, good people, is one of those startling women, a medusa. One look out of her eyes and you turn to stone.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The doctor opened the tent door behind him and revealed a stone figure.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"This is what is left of a person in the last town where we showed. He would not heed my warning to look only at the medusa's reflection in a mirror. Instead he sneaked behind the canvas guardrail and stared her straight in the face. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is what is left of him. He doesn't make a very good statue, does he? Let me implore you, ladies and gentlemen, when you go into that tent, for your own good, look at her only in the mirror. It is very distressing for us always to have one or two customers turned to stone at every performance, besides being very difficult to explain to the police. So, once again, I ask you to look only at the medusa's reflection, not at the lady herself.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}John Rogers tweaked the hem of the doctor's gown. \"We wanta see the big bear, doc, me and the wife and the kids. Which tent is it in?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Doctor Lao frowned down on the plumber. \"Whatsa mattah allee time talkee talk bear business? Me no savvee bear business. You no like this Gloddam show, you go somewhere else.\" The doctor spread wide his arms and swept on in his discourse:

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Possibly the strangest of all the animals in this menagerie, and certainly one which none of you should miss seeing, is that most unique of all beasts, the hound of the hedges. Evolved among the hedgerows and grassplots of North China this animal is the living, breathing symbol of greenness, of fecund, perennial plant life, of the transitional stage between vegetable and animal. The greatest scientists of the world have studied this hound and cannot decide whether he is fauna or flora. Your guess, ladies and gentlemen, is as good as the next. When you examine him, you will notice that, although his form is that of the usual dog, his various bodily parts are those of plants. His teeth, for instance, are stiff, thick thorns; his tail is a plait of ferns; his fur is grass; his claws are burrs; his blood is chlorophyll. Surely this is the weirdest beast under the casual canopy of heaven. We feed him hedge apples and green walnuts. Sometimes, too, though not often, he will eat persimmons. Let me advise you, good people, to see the hound of the hedges even though you must forgo seeing the mermaid or the werewolf. The hound is unique.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I can't seem to get much information out of the old boy,\" said the plumber to his wife. \"Let's look at something else first; then maybe we can find the bear later.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well,\" said Mrs. Rogers, \"suppose we watch the magician. I think the children would like that.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}So the plumber and his family went into the tent to the right to watch Apollonius perform. Except for the mage they were the only ones in the tent.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Apollonius looked at them dreamily as they filed in. \"It will be ten cents apiece,\" he said. John Rogers handed him a half-dollar. The thaumaturge put the coin in an old cigar box and scratched his head thoughtfully. \"Now what sort of magic would you be wanting to see?\" he asked.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I want to see you take a pig out of this bag,\" said Alice, holding up to him her little sack of candy.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Elementary, my child, elementary,\" said Apollonius. He inserted two fingers into the mouth of the candy sack and drew out a Poland China shoat. It squealed and writhed and kicked its little legs. The magician handed it to Willie. \"You keep this, lad. Feed it well. It ought to make good sidemeat some day.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, goodness,\" said Mrs. Rogers, \"we haven't room for a pig, really. Our place is so small, you know.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Um,\" said Apollonius. \"What a pity.\" He took the pig away from Willie and shoved it back in the sack. \"It was such a nice pig, too. What do you want me to do now?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Know any card tricks?\" asked Mr. Rogers.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"A multitude of them,\" said Apollonius. He reached into a pocket of his gown, took out a pack of cards and shuffled them with one hand. The cards climbed and fell in graceful spirals and parabolas, pyramiding and mixing and disintegrating, but always returning into a neat square-sided pack.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"This is not magic,\" commented the wizard. \"This is only manual dexterity. Shall I convert some wine into water for you?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Why not change water into wine?\" asked the plumber.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I can do that as readily,\" said the magician. He took up a beaker of water and mumbled over it. It changed color; a soft vinous odor was diffused in the air. He handed the beaker to Mr. Rogers. \"Try a sip.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}John tasted it. \"Sherry,\" he said.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Apollonius tasted it. \"I'd call it muscatel,\" he corrected. \"What do you say it is, madam?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Mrs. Rogers tried the wine. \"It's a little like that in church,\" she said thoughtfully. \"Of course, that's the only wine I ever drank before, so I don't know how to compare it.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, it's not sacramental wine,\" said Apollonius. \"I'm sure of that. But drink it up before Doctor Lao sees it. He doesn't like to have alcohol on the grounds.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Edna Rogers tugged at her mother.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Mother, have him do something we like,\" she pouted.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Do you care for flowers?\" asked Apollonius.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"A little,\" said Edna.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Naw, we don't like 'em,\" said Willie.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, yes, make some flowers for the children,\" said Mrs. Rogers.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The thaumaturge made passes in the air, and pink rose petals fell all about the family and on their shabby shoulders. He made more passes, and violets grew about their feet. Black flowers, yellow edged, climbed the sides of the tent. Mauve flowers with fuzzy tops and thin green leaves sprang up among the violets. A great grey flower on a hairy stalk floated up over their heads. It had a beard like a goat. Spikes and spines clustered the edges of its uneven petals.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Apollonius regarded the big blossom in wonderment. \"Goodness,\" he said, \"I never made a flower like that one before in all my life. I wonder what kind it could be. Do you know, mister?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Naw,\" said the plumber. \"I don't know a whole lot of flowers. Just the common kinds like dandelions and all.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well,\" said Apollonius, \"it's a big brute, whatever it is.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I think you do the cleverest tricks,\" said Mrs. Rogers. \"Don't you, children?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Touched to the quick, the mage said: \"Oh, these aren't tricks, madam. Tricks are things that fool people. In the last analysis tricks are lies. But these are real flowers, and that was real wine, and that was a real pig. I don't do tricks. I do magic. I create; I transpose; I color; I transubstantiate; I break up; I recombine; but I never trick. Would you like to see a turtle? I can create a very superior turtle.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I do,\" said Willie. \"I want to see a turtle.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The magician kicked away some of the violets until he came to the bare soil. Enough of this he scraped up to fill both hands. He molded the earth between his fingers, smoothing it and shaping it and patting it and rubbing it. It became yellow and thick and malleable.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, oh!\" said Alice. \"Look, it's changing into a turtle. Gee, that's a wonderful trick.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Apollonius placed the turtle on the ground. Its head was withdrawn into its shell. He tapped on its back with a twig. \"That generally makes them stick their heads out,\" he explained.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}After a moment or so of being tapped the turtle did stick its head out. But instead of a single head it produced two. The heads were side by side, joined to the neck like the forks of a stick. The two heads opened their four eyes and two mouths and yawned. Then each head tried to start in a different direction.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, goodness,\" said Apollonius disgustedly, \"I would botch the job just when I wanted to do a really neat piece of magic for you. Imagine making such a freak of a thing! Two heads! Really, I apologize. I'm ashamed at my ineptitude.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, that's all right,\" said the plumber. \"I guess them things are kinda hard to make right anyway.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Some more people came crowding into the tent, Doctor Lao following them.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Uh, Apollonius,\" whispered the doctor, \"I promised these folks you would resurrect a man from the dead for them. You'll do it, won't you? They all expressed themselves as being very much interested in watching you at it.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Why, certainly,\" the wizard whispered back. \"But, doctor, have we got a corpse?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I'll go and see,\" said the old Chinaman.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The crowd of people milled around on the flowers and frightened the turtle so that it pulled its heads back into its shell again. A big fat woman stepped on it. She looked down to see what was under her foot.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Good God Almighty, Luther, there's a turtle in here!\" she screeched.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Where? Where?\" asked Luther nervously. \"Where the hell is it, Kate?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Right under my feet,\" sobbed Kate.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"It won't hurt you,\" said Mr. Rogers. \"It's a real tame turtle, I think.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Luther pulled Kate aside and stared down at the chelonian. \"It don't look tame to me.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"It's got two heads; hasn't it, mother?\" said Willie.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"By God, I knew there was something queer about it,\" said Luther.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Doctor Lao came back in the tent with a big bundle in his arms.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I got one,\" he whispered to Apollonius.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Now stand back, all you people, around the edges of the tent,\" directed the doctor. \"Apollonius of Tyana is about to perform the greatest piece of magic in several centuries. Before your very eyes he will restore life to a lifeless corpse.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Before your very eyes the dead will become quick again. And at no further cost to you than what you paid to enter this tent. Stand aside, ladies and gentlemen; stand aside, please! Give the man all the room he needs.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Apollonius stooped over and unrolled the bundle. A little shrivelled dead man, one who had been a laborer of some sort, was disclosed. He had on overalls, old worn army shoes with leather laces in them, a blue hickory shirt, and an old worn-out cowboy hat. In the leather sweat band of the hat were the initials \"R.K.\" floridly delineated in indelible pencil. One of the leather shoestrings in the man's old worn-out army shoes had been broken and retied in several places. The knots looked as if they might have been done by a seafaring man. Apollonius placed the cadaver on its side, drawing the arms up above the head. He bent the knees and slightly spread the legs. The corpse looked as if it was sleeping in a very uncomfortable position.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Apollonius began to pray a low, thick prayer. His eyeballs turned dead green; thin, hazy stuff floated out of his ears. He prayed and prayed and prayed. To the subtle spirit of life he sent his terrible invocation.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Then all of a sudden, when everyone was most expecting it, the dead man came to life, sat up, coughed, and rubbed his eyes.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Where the devil am I?\" he wanted to know.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"You're at the circus,\" said the doctor.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, lemme outa here,\" said the man. \"I got business to attend to.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}He got to his feet and started off with a slight limp. Luther caught his arm as he made for the door. \"Listen, mister,\" he asked, \"was you really dead?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Deader than hell, brother,\" said the man and hurried on out of the tent.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}At <<about two-thirty two|5k:1>> policemen arrived at the circus grounds to look the show over and see that nothing inimical to the public interest took place. One of the cops was a big fat jolly ignorant-looking guy; the other was a tall thin ugly man. They wore uniforms, Sam Browne belts, sidearms and shiny, brass badges. Doctor Lao spotted them from afar and slipped up behind them.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Whatsah mattah? Chase crook? Somebody steal? Whatsah mattah cops come this Gloddam place? This my show, by Glod!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Now don't get all excited,\" said the fat cop. \"We just come out to look around a little. Jest keep yer shirt on, slant-eye. We ain't gonna arrest nobody unless they needs it. We're officers; how about us takin' in a few of these here sideshows?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Make yourselves at home, gentlemen,\" said Doctor Lao. \"Go where you please when you please. I shall instruct the ticket-takers to let you in wherever you may choose to go.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"That's the way to talk,\" said the policeman. \"Whattayah got that's hot right now?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"The sideshows are all open. Go anywhere you please,\" said the doctor. \"You must excuse me now; I must go and give my lecture on the medusa.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The cops wandered around a little, peering in tents and staring at people and nodding to their friends. They caught a little boy sneaking in under a tent, pulled him back, bawled him out, and sent him home in tears. Then they decided to see a sideshow or two.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"We'll jest go in one right after another so's not to miss anything,\" said the thin ugly cop.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Right,\" said the fat ignorant-looking cop. \"Ever see such a goofy circus?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Never,\" said his buddy. \"Let's go in here.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}They went in the medusa tent. The interior was tinted a creamy yellow, and pale silver stars spangled the yellowness. A big mirror hung on the far wall. Before the mirror was a canvas cubicle, the interior of which was reflected in the mirror. One could not see into the cubicle unless one looked in the mirror. Mirror and cubicle both were roped off so that no one could approach very near to either.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Sitting on a couch in the cubicle was the medusa paring her nails. Her youth was surprising. Her beauty was startling. The grace of her limbs was arousing. The scantiness of her clothing was embarrassing. A lizard ran up the canvas side of her enclosure. One of the snakes on her head struck like a whiplash and seized it. The other snakes fought with the captor for the lizard. That was bewildering.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"What in the devil kind of a woman is that?\" demanded the big fat ignorant-looking cop.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Doctor Lao, \"this is the medusa. She is a Sonoran medusa from Northern Mexico. Like her Gorgon sisters, she has the power to turn you into stone if you look her in the eye. Hence, we have this mirror arrangement to safeguard our customers. Let me beg of you, good people, to be satisfied with a reflected vision of her and not go peeking around the edge of the canvas at her. If anybody does that, I forecast lamentable results.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"First of all, however, look at her snakes. You will notice that most of them are tantillas, those little brown fellows with black rings about their necks. Towards the rear of her head, though, you can see some grey snakes with black spots on them. Those are night snakes, Hypsiglena ochrorhyncus, as they are called in Latin. And her bangs are faded snakes, Arizona elegans, no less. One of the faded snakes just now caught a lizard which some of you may have seen. Her night snakes also eat small lizards, but the tantillas eat nothing but grubs and similar small worms; the feeding of them is sometimes difficult in colder climes.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"It was a doctor from Belvedere, I believe, who first pointed out that the snakes of a medusa were invariably the commoner snakes of the locality in which she was born; that they were never poisonous; that they embraced several different species; that they fed independent of the woman they adorned. This Belvederian doctor was interested primarily in the snakes and only secondarily in the medusa, so his observations, as far as sideshow purposes are concerned, leave much to be desired. However, I have made a study of this and several other medusas and, hence, am able to tell you a little about them.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"The origination of medusas is a puzzle to science. Their place in the evolutionary scale is a mystery. Their task in the great balance of life is a secret. For they belong to that weird netherworld of unbiological beings, salient members of which are the chimera, the unicorn, the sphinx, the werewolf, and the hound of the hedges and the sea serpent. An unbiological order, I call it, because it obeys none of the natural laws of hereditary and environmental change, pays no attention to the survival of the fittest, positively sneers at any attempt on the part of man to work out a rational life cycle, is possibly immortal, unquestionably immoral, evidences anabolism but not katabolism, ruts, spawns, and breeds but does not reproduce, lays no eggs, builds no nests, seeks but does not find, wanders but does not rest. Nor does it toil or spin. The members of this order are the animals the Lord of the Hebrews did not create to grace His Eden; they are not among the products of the six days' labor. These are the sports, the offthrows, of the universe instead of the species; these are the weird children of the lust of the spheres.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Mysticism explains them where science cannot. Listen: When that great mysterious fecundity that peopled the worlds at the command of the gods had done with its birth-giving, when the celestial midwives all had left, when life had begun in the universe, the primal womb-thing found itself still unexhausted, its loins still potent. So that awful fertility tossed on its couch in a final fierce outbreak of life-giving and gave birth to these nightmare beings, these abortions of the world. Ancient man feebly represented this first procreation with his figurine of the Ephesian Diana, who had strange animals wandering about her robe and sheath and over her shoulders, suckling at her numerous bosoms, quarreling among the locks of her hair. Nature herself probably was dreaming of that first maternity when she evolved the Surinam toad of the isthmian countries to the south of here, that fantastic toad which bears its babes through the skin of its back. Yes! Perhaps through the skin of the back of the mighty mother of life these antibiological beings came forth. I do not know.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Now this medusa here is a young one. I should place her age at less than one hundred years. Judges of women have told me she is unusually attractive, that she possesses beauty far more lovely than that possessed by the average human girl. And I concede that in the litheness of her arms, the swelling of her breasts, the contours of her face, there is doubtless much that would appeal to the artistic in man. But she is a moody medusa. Sometimes I try to talk to her, to find out what she thinks about sitting there regarding all the world reflected in a mirror, potentially capable of depopulating a city merely by walking down the streets looking at the passers-by.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"But she will not talk to me. She only glances at me in the mirror with boredom \x{2014} or is it pity or amusement? \x{2014} on her face and fondles her snakes, dreaming, doubtless, of the last man she has slain.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I recall an incident of some years ago when we were showing in the Chinese city of Shanhaikwan, which is situated at the northern extremity of the Great Wall. The medusa and some of the other exhibits in my circus were slightly ill from a long sea voyage, and the whole circus had a droopy air about it that was simply devastating to the business. Well, we put up our tents in Shanhaikwan and thought to stay there awhile until our animals had recovered. It was summer; the mountain breeze from Manchuria was refreshing. There was no war in progress thereabouts for a wonder, for that is the most war-ridden spot in the whole world; and we decided to stay there awhile and try to regain our customary equanimity.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Sailors were in the city, sailors from foreign countries who were off their warships on shore leave; and they came to see my circus. They were a gang of drunken swine, but they paid the money, and I let them in. They saw the medusa and, being asses, thought she was just a girl I had fitted out with a cap of snakes in order to fool people. As if one had to go to all that trouble to fool people! However, as I was saying, they thought the medusa was an imposture; but they were enamored of her beauty and, for a boyish lark, they planned among themselves to kidnap her one night, take her down on the beach, rape her, and then cast her aside.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"So one black night, when the moon was behind a cloud-bank, these sailors came sneaking up to the circus grounds and with their knives sliced a hole in the medusa's tent and went in after her. The night being so dark that they could not see her face, they were safe enough for the time being, at least.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Apollonius and I were returning from a wineshop and realized what they were doing as we came staggering and arguing to our tent. I was very angry and would have loosed the sea serpent upon the ravishers; but Apollonius said not to, that the moon would be out presently, and then matters would take care of themselves. So I quieted down, and we watched and waited.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"There were ten drunken sailors in the mob. Pale as ghost-flesh were their white uniforms in the black darkness. As I say, they split the tent with their knives, seized the medusa, gagged her, and carried her down to the beach. Just when they got her past the dunes, the moon came out from behind its veil. And I assume the sailors were standing in a semicircle about the medusa, for next morning, when Apollonius and I went down there, ten stone sailors were careening in the sand just as she had left them after looking at them; and the drunken leers were still on their silly, drunken faces. And still are for aught I know, for those leers were graved in the living stone.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I tell you, it does not pay to fool with a medusa. Are there any questions anyone would like to ask? If not, I suggest we go and look at the sphinx.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}A big fat woman in the crowd said: \"Well, I don't believe a word you say. I never heard so much nonsense in all my living days. Turning people to stone! The idee!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}A little man beside her said: \"Now, Kate, don't go sounding off that way in front of all these people.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Kate said: \"You shut up, Luther; I'll say what I darn good and well please!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Doctor Lao said: \"Madam, the r\x{f4}le of skeptic becomes you not; there are things in the world not even the experience of a whole life spent in Abalone, Arizona, could conceive of.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Kate said: \"Well, I'll show you! I'll make a liar out of you in front of all these people, I will!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}And Kate shouldered her way through the onlookers to the roped-in canvas cubicle where lounged the medusa.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"In the name of the Buddha, stop her!\" screamed Doctor Lao.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}But Kate bent under the guard rope and stuck her face around the edge of the cubicle. \"Hussy,\" she started to say. And before she could utter a third syllable, she was frozen into stone.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Later on, while everybody was stewing around wondering what to do about it, a geologist from the university examined Kate. \"Solid chalcedony,\" he said. \"Never saw a prettier variegation of color in all my life. Carnelian chalcedony. Makes mighty fine building stone.\"",

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well,\" said Martha, \"I never did see such a funny-looking circus in all my life. Are you sure we're at the right place, Ed?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, then, I suppose we better look at some of the sideshows. Here's a tent with a mermaid in it. Let's go in here.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, I'll tell you, Martha, I hate to spend money on anything that's so obviously a fake. We both know there ain't any such thing as a mermaid. Let's look around a little more. I don't mind being fooled if I don't know at the time that I am being fooled, but the very idea of spending money to see something I know good and well is a fake is somehow repugnant to me.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Maybe it ain't a fake, Papa,\" offered Ed junior.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Don't say 'ain't,' dear,\" corrected Mama patiently.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Let's go look at the snake,\" suggested little Howard.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oooh, snakes make mother so nervous.\" Mama shuddered.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, whatta we gonna do? Just stand around all the time?\" asked Howard.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Now don't go talking to your mother that way, or father'll switch some politeness into you when we get home,\" threatened the traffic officer.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Howard began to cry.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"And don't go turning on the weeps, either, or you'll get switched right now.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Howard ceased crying.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Perhaps this hound of the hedges would be interesting,\" said Martha, looking at the legend on a banner streaming from a near-by tent.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"No,\" said Ed, \"there's nothing to it. Only a dog painted green. I saw it in the parade this morning.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Aw, gee, Papa, let's look at something,\" begged Ed junior.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Frankly, Martha,\" said Ed, \"I don't believe there's anything here we want to see. We shouldn't have come. I never dreamed anyone would try to palm off on the public such a collection of foolishness.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Doctor Lao came by headed for the medusa exhibit.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Whatsah mattah? You tink someblody makeum fool allah time. I no fool you. You come this place looky look; you looky look. By Glod, I no charge you nothing. You go in flor nothing; takeum whole dam family flor nothing. You see: I no fool you. This place no catchum fake. This my show, by Glod!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}He pushed the traffic officer and his family into the tent with the roc's egg and dashed on about his business.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"He's the boss of this circus,\" explained Ed embarrassedly to his wife. \"I guess he got sore about what I said about everything being a fake. What in the world is this thing here?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"The sign said it was the roc's egg,\" said Martha.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The egg loomed like a monolith before them. Pockmarks in its shell were as big as golf balls. They oozed a thin watery secretion.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"It looks like an egg all right,\" agreed Ed. \"But it's preposterous that any egg could be so big.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, it is that big, isn't it, Papa?\" asked Howard.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I guess so, my boy; I guess so.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, what do we do? Just stand here and look at it?\" asked Ed junior.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Now, don't be impatient, dear,\" said Mama.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I tell you what,\" said the traffic officer; \"I've got it figured out, I believe. It's not an egg at all. It's made of concrete or something, and it is a fake. There couldn't be an egg that big.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, it looks that big, Papa,\" said Howard.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Now, Howard,\" cautioned Mama.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, why does all the water run out of it?\" asked Ed junior.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, lots of times concrete'll sweat in hot weather, if it's poorly made,\" said Papa. \"It's porous, see, and soaks up moisture on cool nights. Then when it gets hot like this afternoon, the moisture collects and runs out. Kinda like a water pitcher. Capillary action, they call it.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Gee, Papa, you know everything, don't you, Papa?\"' said Howard.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, I can tell a lump of concrete from an egg when I see it,\" admitted the traffic officer.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The egg began to emit creaking sounds. It seemed to move a little, and from its apex a noise of tapping came. \"It's the heat expanding it,\" said Papa.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The tapping became louder. An irritating scratching accompanied it. The egg shook and rolled a little. \"Back up a little, everybody,\" said Papa. \"Looks like the thing was going to turn over.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}A grating, tearing sound came from the top of the egg, and a hunk of shell fell off at their feet. A yellow bill the size of a plowshare stuck out of the egg.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"My God, it's hatching,\" said Mama.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Stand back, everybody,\" ordered Papa.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The top of the egg splintered and crackled, and out of the ruptured opening a baby roc stuck its frowzy head and looked down at them. Silly pinfeathers, big as ostrich plumes, adorned its grey skin, and the yellow at the corners of its mouth was as yellow as butter. Then the egg fell all apart, and the roc chick stood weeping in the litter of eggshell. It opened its mouth and wailed with horrible hunger.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Come on, let's get out of here,\" said the traffic officer.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"It wasn't really concrete, was it, Papa?\" asked Howard.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Now, Howard, please don't ask any more questions,\" said Mama.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Papa said: \"Let's go on home, Martha. I don't like this place.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"All right,\" said Martha, smiling.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}At the curb near the edge of the circus grounds a big truck prevented them from getting into their own car. Some rough-looking men were loading a big hunk of stone onto the body of the truck. The traffic officer recognized a man standing near the truck. He hailed him:

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Hello there, Luther! What did you do, buy a statue at the circus?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Luther looked at him sourly. \"That ain't no statue,\" he said. \"That's Kate.\"",

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"No,\" she said, \"but I advise you to go and take another good long look at that man you thought was a bear. Then maybe you'll realize how easy it is for people to see one thing and swear they saw something totally different when they get on the witness stand.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Aw, honey,\" said Frank, \"what the hell do you want to be nasty for? I thought you had forgotten all about that by this time. I said it was a man, didn't I?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Yes, but you said it just to humor me. And if there's anything I hate, it's being humored, especially when I know I'm right.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"My God, Frank, I know perfectly well it was a man! I see no necessity for going out to that hot circus just to convince myself all over again. But you go, and I will be very gracious about it when you come home and apologize to me for sneering at me the way you did this morning.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"You are being very unreasonable, darling.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"On the contrary, I conceive myself as being the acme of reasonableness, considering the way you cackled at me, and all those horrid things you said about my needing glasses. If I had acted according to the promptings of my indignation I would have caused a scene that might have ended only in the divorce courts.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Listen, honey, are you really still sore about that parade, or are you just kidding me?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"No, I'm not sore, Frank. But neither am I kidding.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, I wish you'd change your mind and go.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"No, Frank, really I don't care about seeing it. You go on by yourself and have a good time, dear.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well . . . good-by.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Good-by.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}So Frank told his stenographer to tell any of his clients who might call on him that he would be back in half an hour, and he went out and got in his sedan and drove down Main Street to the circus grounds.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}A man of many artificial parts was Lawyer Frank Tull. His teeth had been fashioned for him and fitted to his jaws by a doctor of dental surgery. His eyes, weak and wretched, saw the world through bifocal lenses, so distorted that only through them could the distortion of Frank's own eyes perceive things aright. He had a silver plate in his skull to guard a hole from which a brain tumor had been removed. One of his legs was made of metal and fiber; it took the place of the flesh-and-blood leg his mother had given him in her womb. Around his belly was an apparatus that fitted mouth-like over his double hernia and prevented his guts from falling out. A suspensory kept his scrotum from dangling unduly. In his left arm a platinum wire took the place of the humerus. Once every alternating week he went to the clinic and was injected either with salvarsan or mercury according to the antepenultimate week's dose to prevent the Spiroch\x{e6}ta pallida from holding too much power over his soul. Odd times he suffered prostate massages and subjected himself to deep irrigations to rectify another chronic fault in his machinery. Now and then, to keep his good one going, they flattened his rotten lung with gas. On one ear was strapped an arrangement designed to make ordinary sounds more audible. In the shoe of his good foot an arch supporter kept that foot from splaying out. A wig covered the silver plate in his skull. His tonsils had been taken from him, and so had his appendix and his adenoids. Stones had been carved from his gall, and a cancer burnt from his nose. His piles had been removed, and water had been drained from his knee. Sometimes they fed him with enemas; and they punched a hole in his throat so that he could breathe when his noseholes clogged. He carried his head in a steel brace, for his neck was broken; currently also his toenails ingrew. As a member of the finest species life had yet produced he could not wrest a living from the plants of the field, nor could he compete with the beasts thereof. As a member of the society into which he had been born he was respected and taken care of and lived on, surviving, no doubt, because he was fit. He was a husband but not a father, a married man but not a lover. One hundred years after he died they opened up his coffin. All they found were strings and wires.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}He parked his car, got out of it, and walked across the street to the circus to look at its freaks.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The chimera lay sleeping on a pile of freshly turned clay, and it coughed in its sleep; and the fetor of its belching, wafting upwards, asphyxiated the gnats that swarmed about its head. Little dead denizens of the lower air strata, they fell like floating flakes of powder, and no requiem accompanied their falling. The sleeping chimera kicked in his sleep, following the dictates of some action-filled dream; and the great claws of his paws lacerated the clay upon which he slept. His eagle wings half spread, their pinions expanding fanwise, and, all rumpled, they drew together again, the feathers tangled and fluffy. His dragon tail stirred snakelike, and the metal barb of its tip plowed up little furrows in the clay. His whiskers were singed where his fire-breath had scorched them. Some of the scales on his tail were gangrened and sloughing off where a colony of parasites bred and pullulated. He was shedding; great loose patches of fur, like hunks of felt, hung from his hide. Ticks crawled about in and over those patches. He had a nasty minkish smell, keenly sweetish, fattily pukish, vile and penetrating.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Frank Tull, the lawyer, stood there and stared at the chimera and was horrified to perceive that it was not a fake after all.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"By Gawd!\" said one of the quarantine inspectors, \"I never thought there was no sech animal.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The sleeping chimera gave a great snort; sparks, soot, smoke, and flame frothed out of his nostrils.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"That's why we have to bed him down on clay,\" said Doctor Lao. \"If we let him sleep on hay, he'd burn it all up. Do you know how he manages that fire-breathing trick? Well, sir, it's simple when you understand his metabolism. You see, the chimera, like Arizona's outstanding citizen, the Gila monster, has no elimination system in the sense that ordinary animals have. Instead of expelling waste matter through the bowels, he burns it up within him, and he snorts out the smoke and ashes. Yes, a chimera is its own incinerator plant. Very unusual beast.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"What makes you think Gila monsters have no elimination system?\" asked Mr. Etaoin.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, that's what everybody around here claims,\" said the doctor. \"A hell of a lot of people have told me that. Seems that's how the Gila monsters get their poison: the waste matter in them having no outlet, it concentrates and intensifies and putrefies and works into their saliva so that when one of the big lizards bites anyone he thereby poisons him. Quite an interesting theory, I think. I much prefer its piquancy to a more rational explanation of Heloderma's venomous attributes.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, however did you ketch this here shimmerra, doctor?\" a country lass wanted to know.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, we got him years ago in Asia Minor. Chimeras have one frailty: they are enamored of the moon. So we took a mirror, placed it on a mountain top where it reflected the <<midnight|13>> moonlight, and the lunar-loving monster thought his bright silver ball was in reach at last. Well, sir, he came soaring and screaming down out of the heavens, crashed into the mirror, and us boys we jumps out, and over his shoulders we flings a golden chain. We had him!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, Doctor Lao!\" said a woman reporter from the Abalone Tribune, \"I do so hope you will give me an interview sometime and tell me all about your wonderful adventures!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"They'd make front-page news all right in a hick town like this,\" affirmed Doctor Lao.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}An old-like, wealthy-looking party in golf pants and sport shirt and plaid socks probed at the chimera with his walking cane. The monster peevishly switched his tail like a horse switching at flies, raking the cane out of the old-like party's hand and sloughing him across the shins with the metal-barbed tip.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Don't be foolin' with that animal, mister,\" warned Doctor Lao.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"What do you feed him?\" somebody asked.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Rattlesnakes,\" said the doctor.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Lots of rattlers around Abalone here,\" said one of the quarantine inspectors. \"I killed a hellbellin' big sidewinder down towards Beeswax last spring.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"You must be mistaken, friend,\" said Doctor Lao. \"Sidewinders do not attain to any great size. In fact, they are among the smallest of the crotaline snakes.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, this one was bigger than hell, by God,\" asserted the quarantine inspector.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"What I can't understand,\" said the old-like party in the golf pants, \"is how in the world one animal can combine in itself the attributes of a lizard, an eagle, and a lion, as does this chimera, and have them all so perfectly blended together. Now, I cannot tell where the lion leaves off in this beast and where the lizard begins, nor where the eagle starts in; yet there they all three are in a balanced combination. What sort of lizard would you say is incorporated in the monster's make-up, Doctor Lao? Could it be one of those Central American monitors, or iguanas as they are called?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Me no savvee lizard talk,\" said the old Chinaman.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Maybe it's the beast of the Apocalypse,\" remarked Lawyer Frank Tull, who felt that he should remark something and not stand there forever silent like an idiot or a damn fool.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Nothing of the sort,\" replied the old-like party in the golf pants. \"We all know there never was such a thing. Biblical baloney, if you will permit me to say so, my dear sir. Biblical baloney. Sheer and unadulterated biblical baloney. Yes, sir, biblical baloney. You'll find lots of it in the old book.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, my daddy claims the Bible's a mighty fine book,\" said the country lass.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"The chimera,\" said Doctor Lao, \"flies high on tireless pinions; so high, indeed, that mortal man is rarely vouchsafed a glimpse of him. Years ago, in the Asia Minor campaigns of the great Iskander, one of the Macedonian captains killed a chimera with his longbow. He took it back with him to the museum at Alexandria, and there, to preserve it for posterity, it was mounted by some forgotten Egyptian taxidermist. Years later, a monk from Tibet saw it in the museum and, on returning to his lamasery, made a statue of it in porcelain and set it out to decorate the yard. Still later, a Chinese, corning to that part of the country from the Northern Capital, saw the strange figure and took measurements of its proportions. Returning to his home, he fashioned another statue in bronze and presented it to Kublai, then great khan of all the Mongols. Then, when Kublai had the Tatar wall constructed in a square about the Northern Capital, he also ordered an astronomical tower built upon its eminence. In the tower were placed various instruments, yardstick arrangements for measuring the stars. And for the decorative motif to be worked into the design of these instruments, Kublai ordained that the figure of the chimera be used. This was done. Nowadays, one may still see chimeras in bronze writhing around celestial globes and holding in their claws celestial computing rods.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Other Chinese kings, coming there from time to time, saw these chimeras, wondered at them, understood their significance not, and went away thinking that somehow the beasts symbolized the power of the great khan. Then the petty Chinese princes commenced using the chimera motif themselves and had it worked into the designs of their own royal decorations. About that time the misleading name of dragon was coined to designate this royal emblem, and wrongly, of course, the dragon was taken to mean ferocity. But the chimera of Kublai was a benevolent beast, a patron of the arts of contemplation and study; and it must have been surprised when later it found itself spraddled on a banner, going to war.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Afterwards, when other lesser kings supplanted Kublai, one of them decided that his particular dragon should have five toes and that the dragons of other kings might have three toes, four toes, or even six or seven toes, but not five. A rival king disobeyed this edict, and war ensued. I forget how the war came out. You will notice that this chimera of mine, however, has four toes on his front feet and three on his rear, so the dogmatic king, if he supposed he had authenticity to back his claims, was very much mistaken. I never thought to count the toes on Kublai's chimeras in Peking, so I can't say whether the ancient sculptors were accurate.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Will chimeras breed in captivity?\" asked the lawyer.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, certainly,\" said the doctor. \"They'll breed any time. This fellow here is always trying to get at the sphinx.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, that isn't exactly what I mean, though, of course, it's interesting to know. I meant will they reproduce?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"How can they, when they all are males?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"What? Are there no female chimeras?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Not a single one, and very few males either, for that matter. You are looking at a rare animal, mister.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, if there are no females, then where do they come from?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"This one came from Asia Minor, as I already said a moment ago.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, hell! I mean how are they born?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Your question is unanswerable. No one knows the least detail of the life cycle of the chimera.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Could it not be that the female chimera, like the females of several insect species, is of an entirely different bodily make-up from the male and, so far, has not been identified as such by science?\" asked the old-like party in the golf pants.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Science does not even recognize the existence of the male chimera, let alone search for its mate,\" said Doctor Lao.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"What is science, anyway?\" asked the country lass.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Science?\" said the doctor. \"Why, science is nothing but classification. Science is just tagging a name to everything.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The chimera awoke. The mists of sleep glazed his green eyes, and reflections of strange dreams swam and receded in his brain. Raising a hind foot he scratched at his tick-crawling hide and, done with the scratching, sniffed at the claw that had scourged the ticks. Doctor Lao took a rattlesnake from a large canister and tossed it to the chimera. The rattler fell in a heap, arched its head, whirred and buzzed and shifted its coils and defied the monster.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}The chimera regarded the rattler as intently as a scullion maid regards a cockroach she is about to step on. Then he flung his tail high up over his back, as does a scorpion, and leaning forward, still as does a scorpion, struck the viper a smart blow on its head with the metal tip of his tail, also as would a scorpion. The rattler died. The chimera picked it up in his forepaws and, sitting kangaroo-like on his haunches, devoured the snake, nipping off the rattles with his front teeth and nicely spitting them aside. He ate the rattler a bite at a time as a child eats a banana and with every whit as much satisfaction. Done with the meal, the monster groveled before Doctor Lao, snorting smoke rings and begging for more food.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"No, my pretty thing; one snake a day is all you get in this hot weather,\" said the aged Chinese.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"You know,\" he continued to his audience, \"it is very necessary to watch our animals' diet down here in Arizona. I think it is because of the lack of humidity or something. Although it may very well be nothing but the dust. Anyhow, if we overfeed them, they invariably have colic or, what is worse, worms. This chimera, of course, with his peculiar interior incinerating system burns the worms up as fast as they attack him. But take our sphinx, for instance. It is a homeric task to worm a sphinx. Ordinary vermifuges won't do at all. It takes a profoundly powerful purgative in large, incessant doses. The last time I wormed the sphinx it voided some of the strangest-looking worms I ever saw in my life. Just like enormous noodles they were. And now every time I look at noodles I think of those wretched tapeworms, and every time I look at tapeworms I think of noodles. It's very distressing.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"The noodle is a favorite Chinese dish, too, is it not?\" asked the old-like party in the golf pants.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I prefer shark fins,\" said Doctor Lao.",

            '[19:19] The Circus of Dr. Lao - Charles G. Finney.epub (OEBPS/Text/Section002.xhtml) - nineteen nineteen',
            "Pleasantly saturated with Harry Martinez's good beer, Larry Kamper and his companion sat at the bar conversing and sipping and smoking. They had found interest and friendship each in the other, and had watered the seeds of their camaraderie with plentiful drenches of cool, mellow beer. Weather, hard times, and the parade having been talked out thin, the matter of Larry's career in the Orient in the service of his country's flag was now attacked.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Man and boy,\" said Larry, \"I put in six goddam years among the heathen and I come home to get civilized all over again. Jees, I was like a little farmer kid in a city fer the first time when I got to Frisco.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Whereabouts was you in China, Larry?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Up in Tientsin most of the time. That's where the Fifteenth is stationed. Course we did a lot of chasing around, too.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Wot kinda beer they got over there?\" asked Harry Martinez.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, Asahi an' Sakura an' Gold Bottle an' Five Star an' Kupper an' Chess an' Spatenbrau an' Munchen an' a hell of a lot of other kinds. The Kupper was the best, though. Gawd, I drunk enough of it to float a battleship. Sure was fine beer.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, wot kinda women was there?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, there was all kinds \x{2014} Koreans an' Manchurians an' Japs an' Russians an' Cantonese an' Annamites an' Jews an' Latvians an' Slavs an' French an' Alsatians an' Filipinos. Hell of a lot of women. The Manchurians was the best, though. Big old cowlike girls with soft eyes an' big feet what they didn't never bind. They wore trousers an' jackets like men; and their hair was like black smoke, black, greasy smoke.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I always heard,\" said his friend, \"that them Chinese women was made different. Is that a fack?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Nah,\" said Larry, \"they're just like any other women. Funny thing, though, a lot of Chink men think the same thing about white women. Wonder how that damn idea started, anyhow?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}Neither his friend nor Harry Martinez could help him in his bewilderment.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Lord God,\" Larry's friend said, \"I sure would like to travel around over the world and see funny people and queer places like you have. I all time wanted to travel, but I never will, I reckon; I'll just stick here in Abalone with the wife an' the kids and scratch along till I die. I was just thinking the other day why couldn't I slip off an' beat my way to the coast an' stow away on a boat goin' to Australia, maybe; anywhere so long as it was a hell of a ways off. And when I got there I could change my name an' start in all over again an' maybe have some fun some more. But I reckon I'll just stay here in Abalone with the wife an' kids till I rot.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Ever see 'em do any beheading over there, Larry?\" asked Harry Martinez.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, sure. Back in '27 they done a lot of it when the bandits got so bad. Us guys used to go to the native city every time there'd be an execution an' take pictures of the goddam thing. I got some good ones in my trunk what's in hock back in Frisco.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"One time down at a burg called Tongshan where we were doing guard while a revolution was going on, the Chink soldiers rounded up a bunch of deserters an' took a notion to have a public killing. They staged it in a rock quarry, an' all us guys went down to watch.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"They shot 'em that time instead of using the big knife. They'd take a guy out an' make him kneel down, an' then one of the Chink non-coms would come up with a big Mauser pistol an' let him have it between the horns.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"There was a hell of a big crowd of people standing around watching. Looking at executions was about the only thing there was to do in Tongshan anyway, except dig coal.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, the Chinks they haul out the last guy, a great big bozo, an' fixes to bump him off an' call it a day. The non-com he snaps back the slide of his Mauser an' sees he's got a live shell in the chamber, an' then he steps over to plug the big boy. Well, the big guy he's awful nervous, an' he watches that Mauser out of the corner of his eye, an' just about the time the non-com pulls the trigger, the big boy jerks his head to one side, an' the non-com misses. It was the first time he'd missed a shot all day, too.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"But that doggone Mauser bullet it wanted blood, an' it hits a flat rock an' ricochets up into the crowd of onlookers an' smacks a little kid right in the temple an' drops him in his tracks.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"An', damn me, if them Chinks didn't think that was a hell of a good joke. Why, they laughed an' laughed till they like to bust a gut. Sure are screwy people.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"I seen Pancho Villa 'dobe wall a bunch of guys once,\" said Harry Martinez. \"But there didn't nobody laugh.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, sir, the Chinese are a great outfit, all right,\" said Larry. \"I kinda like 'em at that. Hey! Ain't that circus run by a Chink?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Yeah.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Well, come on; let's go. It oughtta be good.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}All the way down Main Street Larry kept shuffling his feet, trying to keep step with his companion.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Look at this damn town,\" mourned his friend. \"I been stuck here since <<nineteen nineteen|5k:1>>. Come here fer the wife's health, an' I reckon I'll always be stuck here. Good Gawd! The rest of my life in Abalone. Damn place was dead when I got here, an' it's been getting deader. You been to China an' Japan an' the Philippines an' all them places, but I ain't been nowhere 'cept Abalone, Arizona. Good Gawd!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Yeah, it's tough, all right,\" said Larry.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"What are you figgering on doing, Larry, when you pull out of this place?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Oh, I reckon I'll hunt up a recruiting station somewhere and enlist for the 11th Engineers in Panama. That's supposed to be a good outfit, an' it'll be a change from the infantry at any rate. After I get done with that hitch, I reckon I'll try the coast artillery in Hawaii, an' after that the air corps in the Islands, an' then maybe I'll go back to China. I dunno; there's a hell of a lot of places I want to see yet.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"You don't believe in settlin' down in one spot, do you?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Hell, no! I never did see the layout I didn't get sick of inside of a few years. That's the good thing about the army. When yer time's up you can get to hell out an' go somewhere else. 'Taint like holdin' down a civilian job.\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"No,\" said his friend, \"by God, I'll say it ain't!\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}They reached the circus grounds just as the two college youths landed on their ears in the middle of Main Street. Larry and his friend went over and helped them up.

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"What's the matter, boys; get bounced?\"

  \x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\"Something of the sort,\" said Paul Conrad. \"No matter; it's a lousy circus, anyway.\" He and Slick climbed into their old automobile, ground on the starter awhile and then swept away. On the back of the car was a painted legend:",
