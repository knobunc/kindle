Caresse Crosby the editoress wrote me: \x{201c}a most unusual and wonderful story. who ARE you?\x{201d} and I wrote back, \x{201c}Dear Mrs. Crosby: I don\x{2019}t know who I am. sincerely yours, Charles Bukowski.\x{201d} it was right after that that I quit writing for ten years. but first a night in the rain with PORTFOLIO, a very strong wind, the pages flying down the street, people running after them, myself standing drunk watching; a big window washer who always ate six eggs for breakfast put a big foot in the center of one of the pages: \x{201c}here! hey! I got one!\x{201d} \x{201c}fuck it, let it go, let all the pages go!\x{201d} I told them, and we went back inside. I had won some sort of bet. that was enough.",
