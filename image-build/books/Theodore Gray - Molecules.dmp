            "These are cotton fibers after they have been processed in a cotton gin, which separates the fibers from the seeds. <<Before 1800|9n:0>>, separating seeds from fiber required around a day\x{2019}s human labor per pound. The cotton gin reduced that labor by a factor of fifteen. If you ever catch yourself thinking that humans are clever and progress inevitable, consider that all the technology to build a cotton gin existed for at least a thousand years before anyone actually made one. During all that time, people sat around picking the seeds out by hand, one by one, day after day, year after year, century after century.",

You can sell your cats because you won\x{2019}t be needing them anymore. I\x{2019}m not sure which is more remarkable: that an acrylic engineered fiber can feel this close to real fur or, given that acrylic polymers have been known for quite some time, that it took until <<2013|18:0>> for fake fur manufacturers to achieve this level of purr-fection.",

            "It may surprise you to learn that metal, even iron, burns quite easily under the right conditions. This <<0000|18:1>> grade (very fine) steel wool was simply hung up and lit with a cigarette lighter. Iron burning is the same chemical process as rusting, just happening much, much faster. Iron pots don\x{2019}t burn only because their large mass keeps the temperature at the surface well below the ignition point. A truly massive amount of heat could cause them to burn, but this wouldn\x{2019}t happen on an ordinary stove or camp fire. There\x{2019}s a fascinating thing to notice about how metal burns: there is no \x{201c}flame\x{201d} in the conventional sense. When organic materials burn, you see glowing fire well away from the material itself; this is the burning of gases that have been liberated from the material by the heat of the fire. These flammable gases rise and mix with air before burning, resulting in pretty, flickering flames. When metal burns, there is nothing to be liberated, so all the burning happens directly on the surface of the metal. (Any smoke you see is from a bit of oil left over from the making of the wires.) The tiny, glowing beads of flame chasing each other along these fine strands of steel are both remarkable and beautiful to watch.",

            "When coal burns, you get energy from two reactions: carbon atoms burning into carbon dioxide and hydrogen atoms burning into water. The water is fine; it\x{2019}s the carbon dioxide that is going to cause massive upheaval in the global order. Coal is mostly made of fairly long-chain hydrocarbons with, on average, <<about two|9:0>> hydrogen atoms per carbon atom. In terms of the ratio of carbon to hydrogen, and thus the ratio of energy you get per unit of carbon emitted, coal is the worst fuel to burn.",
