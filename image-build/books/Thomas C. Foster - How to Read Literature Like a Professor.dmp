            "If they can, it\x{2019}s not symbolism, it\x{2019}s allegory. Here\x{2019}s how allegory works: things stand for other things on a one-for-one basis. Back in 1678, John Bunyan wrote an allegory called The Pilgrim\x{2019}s Progress. In it, the main character, Christian, is trying to journey to the Celestial City, while along the way he encounters such distractions as the Slough of Despond, the Primrose Path, Vanity Fair, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Other characters have names like Faithful, Evangelist, and the Giant Despair. Their names indicate their qualities, and in the case of Despair, his size as well. Allegories have one mission to accomplish\x{2014}convey a certain message, in this case, the quest of the devout Christian to reach heaven. If there is ambiguity or a lack of clarity regarding that <<one-to-one|10a:0>> correspondence between the emblem\x{2014}the figurative construct\x{2014}and the thing it represents, then the allegory fails because the message is blurred. Such simplicity of purpose has its advantages. George Orwell\x{2019}s Animal Farm (1945) is popular among many readers precisely because it\x{2019}s relatively easy to figure out what it all means. Orwell is desperate for us to get the point, not a point. Revolutions inevitably fail, he tells us, because those who come to power are corrupted by it and reject the values and principles they initially embraced.",

            "Flash-forward a millennium or so. Hang a left at New York and go to Hollywood. There\x{2019}s a moment in The Maltese Falcon (1941) when Humphrey Bogart\x{2019}s Sam Spade, at night, is leaning over Mary Astor\x{2019}s Brigid O\x{2019}Shaughnessy, kissing her by a window, and then the next moment we\x{2019}re looking at the curtains of the window blowing gently in the morning sunlight. No Sam. No Brigid. Young viewers sometimes don\x{2019}t notice those curtains, so they want to know what happened between Sam and Brigid. It may seem a small detail, but it matters greatly that we understand so that we see how much Sam Spade\x{2019}s judgment may be compromised, and how difficult turning her in at the end is going to be. For those who remember a time when the movies not only didn\x{2019}t show people \x{201c}doing it,\x{201d} they also didn\x{2019}t show people having done it or talking about having done it, those curtains might as well bear the following printed legend: yes, they did. And they enjoyed it. For people of that age, one of the sexiest shots in film consists of waves breaking on a beach. When the director cut to the waves on the beach, somebody was getting lucky. These abstractions were necessary under the Hayes Code, which controlled content in Hollywood films from <<around 1935|18:1>> until 1965, more or less, throughout the height of the studio system. The Hayes Code said a lot of different things, but the one we\x{2019}re interested in was that you could stack bodies like cordwood if they were dead (although usually without blood), but living bodies couldn\x{2019}t get horizontal together. Husbands and wives were nearly always shown in separate beds. I noticed this once more the other night when I watched Hitchcock\x{2019}s Notorious (1946), where Claude Rains and Ingrid Bergman have twin beds. The man has never been born who, finding himself married to Ingrid Bergman, would assent to sleeping in twin beds. Even an evil Nazi like Claude Rains. But in the movies in 1946, that\x{2019}s what happened. So film directors resorted to anything they could think of: waves, curtains, campfires, fireworks, you name it. And sometimes the results were dirtier than showing the real thing. At the end of Hitchcock\x{2019}s North by Northwest (1959), Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint find themselves rescued from the face of Mount Rushmore when the good guys kill Martin Landau before he can send our heroes to their deaths. In one of the truly great cuts, Grant, who is struggling to hold Miss Saint on the rock face, is suddenly pulling her up into the sleeping compartment of the train (and referring to her as Mrs. Thornhill); this shot is followed by an equally famous one\x{2014}the last shot of the film\x{2014}of the train entering a tunnel. No need to comment on that one.",

            "When Henry James has had enough of Daisy Miller and decides to kill her off, he gives her Roman fever or what we would now call malaria. If you read that beautiful little novella and neither of these names suggests anything to you, you really need to pay more attention. Malaria works great, metaphorically: it translates as \x{201c}bad air.\x{201d} Daisy has suffered from figurative bad air\x{2014}malicious gossip and hostile public opinion\x{2014}throughout her stay in Rome. As the name implies, it was formerly thought that the illness was contracted from harmful vapors in hot, moist night air; no one suspected that the problem might lie with those darned mosquitoes that were biting them on those hot, moist nights. So the notion of poisonous vapors would work nicely. Still, the older name used by James, Roman fever, is even better. Daisy does indeed suffer from Roman fever, from the overheated state that makes her frantic to join the elite (\x{201c}We\x{2019}re dying to be exclusive,\x{201d} she says early on) while at the same time causing the disapproval of the Europeanized Americans who reside permanently in Rome at every turn. When she makes her fatal <<midnight|13>> trip to the Colosseum and she sees the object of, if not her affections, then at least her interests, Winterbourne, he ignores her, prompting her to say, \x{201c}He cuts me dead.\x{201d} And the next thing we know, she is dead. Does the manner of her death matter? Of course. Roman fever perfectly captures what happens to Daisy, this fresh young thing from the wilds of Schenectady who is destroyed by the clash between her own vitality and the rotten atmosphere of this oldest of Old World cities. James is a literary realist, hardly the most flamboyantly symbolic of writers, but when he can kill off a character in a highly lifelike way while employing an apt metaphor for her demise, he doesn\x{2019}t hesitate.",

            "Of course, some writers make it hard. I mentioned Yeats and a fairly public symbol earlier, but he is notorious for his capacity to employ very private images and symbols. One of his favorites involves a tower. And not just any tower, not the ivory tower of popular clich\x{e9}, but a very specific example. His tower. <<Around 1915|9n:1>> or 1916 he bought a fifteenth- or sixteenth-century (dates on these matters are a little fuzzy) Anglo-Norman tower, a sort of bastion-minus-its-castle, although it was called Ballylee Castle. Using the Gaelic word for tower, he rechristened it Thoor Ballylee, a curious affectation given the poet\x{2019}s signature inability to master the old language. But then, Yeats was a funny guy. Once he acquires the tower from his great friend Lady Gregory, it quickly dominates his poetry. Sometimes it merely stands for being rooted in the soil of Co. Galway, which was a great desire of his. At others, it can be an emblem of imperfect art, as when he goes up to the roof and leans on a broken stone crenel. Frequently, it is most significantly itself, the place from which he can, in relative safety, watch the competing military forces move up and down the road during the Irish Civil War (\x{201c}Meditations in Time of Civil War\x{201d}). Or it is the building on which he intends to have a dedicatory poem inscribed (\x{201c}To Be Carved on a Stone at Thoor Ballylee\x{201d}). It is a retreat from the modern world, a refuge, a connection to an aristocratic past, an object of great solidity. It becomes the title of successive books, such as The Tower (1928) and The Winding Stair (1933), after its most notable interior feature. And then there are the gyres.",

            "This principle also applies to other scary favorites, such as ghosts and doppelg\x{e4}ngers (ghost doubles or evil twins). We can take it almost as an act of faith that ghosts are about something besides themselves. That may not be true in naive ghost stories, but most literary ghosts\x{2014}the kind that occur in stories of lasting interest\x{2014}have to do with things beyond themselves. Think of the ghost of Hamlet\x{2019}s father when he takes to appearing on the castle ramparts at <<midnight|13>>. He\x{2019}s not there simply to haunt his son; he\x{2019}s there to point out something drastically wrong in Denmark\x{2019}s royal household. Or consider Marley\x{2019}s ghost in A Christmas Carol (1843), who is really a walking, clanking, moaning lesson in ethics for Scrooge. In fact, Dickens\x{2019}s ghosts are always up to something besides scaring the audience. Or take Dr. Jekyll\x{2019}s other half. The hideous Edward Hyde exists to demonstrate to readers that even a respectable man has a dark side; like many Victorians, Robert Louis Stevenson believed in the dual nature of humans, and in more than one work he finds ways of showing that duality quite literally. In The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1886) he has Dr. J. drink a potion and become his evil half, while in his now largely ignored short novel The Master of Ballantrae (1889), he uses twins locked in fatal conflict to convey the same sense. You\x{2019}ll notice, by the way, that many of these examples come from Victorian writers: Stevenson, Dickens, Stoker, J. S. Le Fanu, Henry James. Why? Because there was so much the Victorians couldn\x{2019}t write about directly, chiefly sex and sexuality, they found ways of transforming those taboo subjects and issues into other forms. The Victorians were masters of sublimation. But even today, when there are no limits on subject matter or treatment, writers still use ghosts, vampires, werewolves, and all manner of scary things to symbolize various aspects of our more common reality.",

            "Here\x{2019}s where it gets a little tricky, though: the ghosts and vampires don\x{2019}t always have to appear in visible forms. Sometimes the really scary bloodsuckers are entirely human. Let\x{2019}s look at another Victorian with experience in ghost and nonghost genres, Henry James. James is known, of course, as a master, perhaps the master, of psychological realism; if you want massive novels with sentences as long and convoluted as the Missouri River, James is your man. At the same time, though, he has some shorter works that feature ghosts and demonic possession, and those are fun in their own way, as well as a good deal more accessible. His novella The Turn of the Screw (1898) is about a governess who tries, without success, to protect the two children in her care from a particularly nasty ghost who seeks to take possession of them. Either that or it\x{2019}s about an insane governess who fantasizes that a ghost is taking over the children in her care, and in her delusion literally smothers them with protectiveness. Or just possibly it\x{2019}s about an insane governess who is dealing with a particularly nasty ghost who tries to take possession of her wards. Or possibly\x{2008}.\x{2008}.\x{2008}.\x{2008}\x{200b}well, let\x{2019}s just say that the plot calculus is tricky and that much depends on the perspective of the reader. So we have a story in which a ghost features prominently even if we\x{2019}re never sure whether he\x{2019}s really there or not, in which the psychological state of the governess matters greatly, and in which the life of a child, a little boy, is consumed. Between the two of them, the governess and the \x{201c}specter\x{201d} destroy him. One might say that the story is about fatherly neglect (the stand-in for the father simply abandons the children to the governess\x{2019}s care) and smothering maternal concern. Those two thematic elements are encoded into the plot of the novella. The particulars of the encoding are carried by the details of the ghost story. It just so happens that James has another famous story, \x{201c}Daisy Miller\x{201d} (1878), in which there are no ghosts, no demonic possession, and nothing more mysterious than a <<midnight|13>> trip to the Colosseum in Rome. Daisy is a young American woman who does as she pleases, thus upsetting the rigid social customs of the European society she desperately wants to approve of her. Winterbourne, the man whose attention she desires, while both attracted to and repulsed by her, ultimately proves too fearful of the disapproval of his established expatriate American community to pursue her further. After numerous misadventures, Daisy dies, ostensibly by contracting malaria on her <<midnight|13>> jaunt. But you know what really kills her? Vampires.",

            "One of my favorite novels is Tim O\x{2019}Brien\x{2019}s Going After Cacciato (1978). Lay readers and students generally like it, too, which explains why it has become a perennial strong seller. Although the violence of the Vietnam War scenes may turn some readers off, many find themselves totally engrossed by something they initially figured would just be gross. What readers sometimes don\x{2019}t notice in their involvement with the story (and it is a great story) is that virtually everything in there is cribbed from somewhere else. Lest you conclude with dismay that the novel is somehow plagiarized or less than original, let me add that I find the book wildly original, that everything O\x{2019}Brien borrows makes perfect sense in the context of the story he\x{2019}s telling, even more so once we understand that he has repurposed materials from older sources to accomplish his own ends. The novel divides into three interwoven parts: <<one|9k:0>>, the actual story of the war experience of the main character, Paul Berlin, up to the point where his fellow soldier Cacciato runs away from the war; <<two|9k:0>>, the imagined trip on which the squad follows Cacciato to Paris; and three, the long night watch on a tower near the South China Sea where Berlin manages these two very impressive mental feats of memory on the one hand and invention on the other. The actual war, because it really happened, he can\x{2019}t do much about. Oh, he gets some facts wrong and some events out of order, but mostly, reality has imposed a certain structure on memory. The trip to Paris, though, is another story. Actually, it\x{2019}s all stories, or all those Paul has read in his young lifetime. He creates events and people out of the novels, stories, histories he knows, his own included, all of which is quite unwitting on his part, the pieces just appearing out of his memory. O\x{2019}Brien provides us with a wonderful glimpse into the creative process, a view of how stories get written, and a big part of that process is that you can\x{2019}t create stories in a vacuum. Instead the mind flashes bits and pieces of childhood experiences, past reading, every movie the writer/creator has ever seen, last week\x{2019}s argument with a phone solicitor\x{2014}in short, everything that lurks in the recesses of the mind. Some of this may be unconscious, as it is in the case of O\x{2019}Brien\x{2019}s protagonist. Generally, though, writers use prior texts quite consciously and purposefully, as O\x{2019}Brien himself does; unlike Paul Berlin, he is aware that he\x{2019}s drawing from Lewis Carroll or Ernest Hemingway. O\x{2019}Brien signals the difference between novelist and character in the structuring of the two narrative frames.",
