It overpowered the bite of the handrolled cigarette Adolfo Alcazar was smoking as well as the strong, distinctive, damp-rubber odor of the wetsuit that hung on a hook behind the closed door.

Today, one hundred seventy-seven nations provide information to the organization, which has offices in most of the major cities of the world.

The familia is an institution that dates back to the late nineteenth century. It is part of the same Mediterranean culture that gave rise to crime families in Sicily, Turkey, and Greece. The variation created by the Spanish was that a member\x{2019}s loyalty was to a legitimate employer, usually the owner of a plant or labor group like bricklayers or icemen. To keep the employer\x{2019}s hands unsullied, a cadre of employees was selected and trained to perform or protect the owner against acts of violence or sabotage and to execute the same against rivals. The targets were almost always business sites; attacks against home and members of one\x{2019}s personal family were considered uncivilized.

Word of Adolfo Alcazar\x{2019}s brutal death traveled quickly from Mar\x{ed}a Corneja to Luis Garc\x{ed}a de la Vega to Darrell McCaskey. As he was required to do by law, Luis conveyed news of the homicide to the Ministry of Justice in Madrid. There, a high-ranking officer on the night staff quietly passed the information to General Amadori\x{2019}s longtime personal aide, Antonio Aguirre. Aguirre\x{2014}a former staff officer to Francisco Franco\x{2014}personally went to the General\x{2019}s office, knocked once on the door, and waited until he was invited in. Then he gave the news to the General himself.",

Once the soldiers had secured the Ramirez boat factory, they lined up the three dozen surviving employees and checked their IDs. As she watched the soldiers pick out people, Mar\x{ed}a realized that all of the core leaders of the familia were still alive. The factory guard and other informants must have kept careful records, including photographs. Amadori would have the cream of the familia for show-trials.
