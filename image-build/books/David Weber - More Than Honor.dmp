The original starships used fairly straightforward reaction drives with hydrogen catcher fields to sustain boost after the initial onboard reaction mass was exhausted. Later generations attempted more esoteric propulsion systems, but though they graduated to fusion and photon drives, they remained locked into the sublight reaction principle until <<725|3:0>> pd, when the first crude hyper drive was tested in the Solar System.',

            "Navigation, communication, and observation all are rendered difficult by the nature of hyper-space. Formed by gravitational distortion, hyper-space itself acts as a focusing glass, producing a cascade effect of ever more tightly warped space. The laws of relativistic physics apply at any given point in that space, but as a hypothetical observer looks \x{201c}outward\x{201d} in hyper-space, his instruments show a rapidly increasing distortion. At ranges above about 20 LM (359,751,000 km.) that distortion becomes so pronounced that accurate observations are impossible. One says \x{201c}<<about 20|9:0>> LM\x{201d} because, depending on local conditions, that range may vary up or down by as much as 12%-that is, from 17.6 LM (316,580,880 km.) to 22.4 LM (or 402,921,120 km.). A hypership thus travels at the center of a bubble of observation from 633,161,760 to 805,842,240 km. in diameter. Even within that sphere, observations and measurements can be highly suspect; in effect, the \x{201c}bubble\x{201d} may be thought of as the region in which an observer can tell something is out there and very roughly where. Exact, precise observations and measurements are all but impossible above ranges of 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 km., which would make navigational fixes impossible even if there were anything to take fixes on.",

            "Of course, there wasn\x{2019}t always a grav wave going the direction a starship needed, but with the grav detector to keep a ship clear of naturally occurring grav waves impeller drive could, at last, be used in hyper-space. In addition, it was possible for a Warshawski Sail ship to \x{201c}reach\x{201d} across a wave (which might be thought of as sailing with a \x{201c}quartering breeze\x{201d}) at angles of up to about 60\x{fffd} before the sails began losing drive and up to approximately 85\x{fffd} before all drive was lost. By the same token, a hypership could sail \x{201c}close-hauled,\x{201d} or into a grav wave, at approach angles of 45\x{fffd}. At angles above 45\x{fffd}, it was necessary to \x{201c}tack into the wave,\x{201d} which naturally meant that return passages would be slower than outgoing passages through the same region of prevailing grav waves. Thus the old \x{201c}windjammer\x{201d} technology of Earth\x{2019}s seas had reemerged in the interstellar age, transmuted into the intricacies of hyper-space and FTL travel. By <<1750|9n:0>> pd, however, sail tuners had been upgraded to a point which permitted the \x{201c}grab factor\x{201d} of a sail to be manipulated with far more sophistication than Dr. Warshawski\x{2019}s original technology had permitted. Indeed, it became possible to create a negative grab factor which, in effect, permitted a starship to sail directly \x{201c}into the wind,\x{201d} although with a marginally greater danger of sail failure.",

The mechanism of the junction is still imperfectly understood, but for all intents and purposes a junction is a \x{201c}gravity fault,\x{201d} or a gravitic distortion so powerful as to fold hyper-space and breach the interface between it and normal-space. The result is a direct point-to-point congruence between points in normal-space which are seldom separated by less than 100 light-years and may be separated by several thousand. A hyper drive is required to utilize them, and ships cannot maintain stability or course control through a wormhole junction without Warshawski Sails. Nonetheless, the movement from normal-space to normal-space is effectively instantaneous, regardless of the distance traversed, and the energy cost is negligible.",

Gryphon, the least congenial of the three habitable planets of the Manticore System, has by far the smallest share of First Shareholder families, as its first outpost was not placed until fifteen years after the Plague. The bulk of its aristocracy came from the Second Shareholders, who, for the most part, had substantially less credit than First Shareholders and, accordingly, received smaller \x{201c}Clear Grants\x{201d} (that is, land to which clear title was granted prior to improvements by the owner/tenant). The Crown, however, had established the principle of \x{201c}Crown Range\x{201d} (land in the public domain and free for the use of any individual) to encourage emigration to Gryphon, and by <<1715|9n:0>>, the population of Gryphon had grown to the level set under the Crown Range Charter of 1490. At that point, as the charter required, the Crown began phasing out the Crown Range, granting title on the basis of improvements made, and the trouble began.
