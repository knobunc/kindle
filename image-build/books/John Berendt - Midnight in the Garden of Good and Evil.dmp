They selected Monterey Square for an important outdoor scene, but naturally we were not consulted. The night before filming was to begin, the police went around and abruptly ordered all of us to move our cars out of the square and not to enter or exit our houses between <<ten in the morning|5>> and <<five that afternoon|5>>. The film crew then dumped eight truck-loads of dirt onto the street and spread it around to make it look like the unpaved streets of 1865. The next morning we awoke to find the square full of horses and wagons and ladies in hoop-skirts and a thick coating of dust all over everything. It was intolerable. The cameras were in the middle of the square aimed directly at this house.",

Rural labor was being drawn away to the industrialized North; years of growing nothing but cotton had leached the soil of nutrients, and the center of the Cotton Belt had moved westward. In the financial panic of 1892, the price of a pound of cotton dropped from a dollar to nine cents. By <<1920|9:0>>, the boll weevil had wiped out what little cotton activity was left. From that time onward, Savannah slipped into decline. Many of its once-great houses fell into disrepair. Lady Astor, passing through in 1946, remarked that Savannah was like \x{201c}a beautiful woman with a dirty face.\x{201d} Stung by the criticism, a group of concerned citizens began in the 1950s to restore Savannah\x{2019}s downtown.

            "The Alpha ball was to be a more modest affair than the Cotillion ball the next night: There would be two cash bars instead of five open bars; there would be a breakfast served at <<1:00 A.M.|2a>> instead of both a dinner and a breakfast, and there would be minimal decorations. Nonetheless, the impending affair was not going unnoticed in the hotel. During the dress rehearsal, a cluster of curious onlookers peered through the door, captivated by the sight of so many young black girls in flowing white ballgowns. One of the observers, a man in a gray suit and tan shoes, called attention to the cases of wine and liquor being unpacked at the far end of the ballroom. \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t kid yourself,\x{201d} he said with a knowing air. \x{201c}Blacks drink better whiskey than whites do. Dewar\x{2019}s, Johnnie Walker, Seagram\x{2019}s, Hennessy. All the high-priced brands. I have a theory about why that is.\x{201d} The man cupped the elbow of his pipe-holding arm and rocked back on his heels, glancing to his right and left to satisfy himself that the people standing in his immediate vicinity were paying sufficient attention. He then delivered himself of a peculiarly home spun theory: \x{201c}Remember when the black athletes at the Mexico City Olympics won a lot of medals and raised their fists in the black-power salute? Well, that\x{2019}s when blacks in Savannah started drinking Dewar\x{2019}s scotch, Seagram\x{2019}s gin, and Smirnoff vodka. If you look at those bottles, you\x{2019}ll notice that all the labels have medals on them. Blacks had suddenly begun to identify with medals because of the Olympics, and that\x{2019}s why they bought those brands. At about the same time, they also started drinking Hennessy cognac. The Hennessy label has a picture of a hand holding a mace\x{2014}something like the black-power salute. Johnnie Walker scotch has a man with riding breeches and a top hat, which represents the \x{2018}good life.\x{2019} It all has to do with the symbol on the label. The best example of that was when school integration was taking place. That\x{2019}s when blacks started drinking Teacher\x{2019}s scotch, which has a label showing a professor wearing a mortarboard. They go for the symbol, y\x{2019}see. At least that\x{2019}s the way I figure it.\x{201d}",

            "Downtown residents did not respond happily to Rowan\x{2019}s announcement. While the students did contribute something to the local economy, and they did bring a little life to the otherwise empty streets, they were becoming in the eyes of some people a blight on the landscape with their green hair, their odd clothes, their skateboards, and their tendency to play loud music on their stereos well into the night. In reaction, a group of downtown residents formed a Quality of Life Committee to deal with the situation. Joe Webster, who headed the committee, could be seen each day at <<noontime|13>> walking stiffly with the aid of a cane from his office in the C&S Bank building to the Oglethorpe Club for lunch. His route took him down Bull Street past the main entrance of SCAD, where he would invariably make his way through a small cluster of students and point silently with his cane at some offending object\x{2014}a crumpled candy wrapper or a motorcycle idling noisily at the curb. On one occasion, Mr. Webster and his committee stopped in to see Richard Rowan in his office to express their concern that the fragile human ecology of downtown Savannah might not survive two thousand students.
