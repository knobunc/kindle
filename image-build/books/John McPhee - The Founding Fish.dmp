It comes with its own nutty butter\x{2014}the fat it is living on while eating nothing on the spawning run. That\x{2019}s why it is sapidissima. To a large extent it is self-seasoned. And it will baste itself. Amazingly, for such a fish, it can be successfully frozen, retaining most of its flavor. But eat it all up before Christmas. For variety, I sometimes spoon over the fillets a <<two-to-one|10a:0>> mixture of soy sauce and sesame oil full of chopped scallions. I put it on before broiling and add a little toward the end. Sometimes I include lemon juice, and incorporate bits of fresh ginger instead of the scallions. You can decide whether the sesame-soy concoction deepens the taste or disguises it.

angle. His wrist flicks almost imperceptibly at a consistent rate of about once a second. He says he can feel the shad bump the dart in the center of the current, bump it again, and then go for it.

In the nineteen-eighties, an attempt was made to plant adult shad from the Hudson River in the uppermost Susquehanna, near Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, and Owego, New York. In two days, the fish were out of the Susquehanna, swimming two hundred miles and tumbling down the spillways of four dams. \x{201c}We\x{2019}ve seen fish move a hundred miles a day in the Susquehanna in the wrong direction,\x{201d} St. Pierre acknowledges. \x{201c}If you put an adult shad in a strange river, the fish knows it\x{2019}s in the wrong place and takes off.

Toward the end of the century, two-thirds of Canadian shad landings belonged to the Bay of Fundy. The damming and the pollution of American rivers severely cut the numbers <<after 1900|18:0>>.

At Long Ford on the Schuylkill, near Valley Forge, settlers in the early seventeen-hundreds fenced the river in various ways to intercept the spring migration of American shad. They constructed rock dams, V-shaped weirs of piled stones, and fish racks. A rack was an underwater picket fence with gaps narrow enough to stop shad and wide enough to accommodate the current. Shad piled up against the racks like driftwood. Shad that got past the racks were driven back into them by men on horseback beating the water with bushes. Weir, rack, or fish dam, the methods were so effective that farmers upstream complained. Fresh shad in spring and salt shad the rest of the year were basics in a farm\x{2019}s economy. In 1724 and 1730, the colonial legislature passed acts forbidding such obstructions and calling for removal of the ones that existed. The fishermen of Long Ford ignored these laws.

By the eighteen-twenties, according to his ledgers, his catch was down ninety-six per cent, the result of overfishing. By <<1838|9n:0>>, New York was buying shad from other rivers. On January 17, 1807, the New York Commercial Advertiser reported: \x{201c}A shad weighing five pounds was caught this morning at the Narrows, and sold in our market for one dollar and twelve sents!\x{201d} The exclamation point may have had something to do with the price but more with the date.

            "One Memorial Day weekend at <<nine in the morning|9a>>, I was fishing in a pool far upriver when a canoe overturned in rapids above me. A boy about seven years old, his father, two paddles, a cooler, a thermos, and other buoyant cargo spilled into the river. The boy was wearing a life jacket with a wide collar that reached above his head like a coif. He bobbed upright in the swirling currents, screaming, \x{201c}Daddy! Daddy! Save me! Save me! Daddy, save me!\x{201d} His father struggled to move toward him. Slowly, though, like an opening flower, the boy, the father, the paddles, the thermos, and the cooler were being spread farther apart as they were swept downstream. The father, helpless, could not swim across the current. The little boy\x{2019}s jacket was doing its job, but he kept on screaming. \x{201c}Daddy! Daddy! I\x{2019}m going to die!\x{201d} Standing about fifty
yards from him in my neoprene space suit and my cleated heavy boots, I was helpless, too, as were other wading fishermen. Walking down to the river that day, I happened to glimpse a canoe stashed behind someone\x{2019}s cabin. To leave the river, climb a bluff to the cabin, locate a paddle, and return with the canoe would take so long that the effort seemed pointless, but I started wading toward the bank anyway. Then I noticed that the boy was being swept toward an anchored boat. Two shad fishermen were in it with four rods. The boy was fast approaching them, still screaming, \x{201c}Daddy! I\x{2019}m going to die!\x{201d} They would end his panic. They would pull up their anchor and go into mid-stream to intercept him. As he went by them, they watched, and did not stir.",

I was standing on an underwater boulder, but evidently not a well-chosen boulder, and also not a very large boulder. <<A little after four|9e>>, I slipped. I slid down the rock into the river.

was in large part anecdotal.

This was, of course, the Pickett of the charge\x{2014}the Confederate general, fifty-ninth in his West Point
class of fifty-nine, who helped end the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania when he ordered his troops to scramble up Cemetery Ridge under heavy Union fire on July 3, 1863, at Gettysburg. Pickett followed the charge, while two thousand seven hundred of his soldiers fell. That was not, however, the scene reminiscent of the Concord militia. On April 1, 1865, in Virginia, Pickett was defending an intersection known as Five Forks, six miles south of the Appomattox River and a good bit closer to the Southside Railroad, the last remaining supply line to Richmond. While thirty thousand Union troops led by Little Phil Sheridan approached from the southeast, Pickett\x{2019}s twelve thousand, spread two miles wide behind fences and in ditches, braced to meet them. Pickett\x{2019}s supreme commander, Robert E. Lee, was headquartered ten miles away, near Petersburg. Should Pickett fall to Sheridan, Lee would be forced from Petersburg, the Federals would capture Richmond, and the Confederate cause would be lost. Someone mentioned shad. The spring spawning run was in full penetration of the continent. The fish were in the rivers. Tom Rosser, another Confederate general, had caught some, and on the morning of April 1st ordered them baked for his <<midday|13>> dinner, near Hatcher\x{2019}s Run, several miles from Five Forks. He invited Pickett and Major General Fitzhugh Lee, nephew of Robert E. Lee, to join him. Pickett readily accepted, and rode off from his battle station with Lee. The historian Shelby Foote continues the narrative (\x{201c}The Civil War,\x{201d} vol. 3, p. 870): \x{201c}Neither told any subordinate where he was going or why, perhaps to keep from dividing the succulent fish too many ways; with the result that when the attack exploded\x{2014}damped from their hearing, as it was, by a heavy stand of pines along Hatcher\x{2019}s Run\x{2014}no one knew where to find them. Pickett only made it back to his division after half its members had been shot or captured, a sad last act for a man who gave his name to the most famous charge in a war whose end was hastened by his threehour absence at a shad bake.\x{201d}",

In the Hudson River, shad were taken commercially from Troy to the sea\x{2014}with drift nets down to Catskill, anchored nets to the Tappan Zee, and, on the New Jersey side opposite 125th Street, nets fastened to poles set in the bottom of the river. A similar sequence filled the Connecticut to Saybrook, where nets were fastened to poles set in the bottom of the river. A hundred years later, as the twentieth century ended, most shad marketed in the Northeast were being shipped from Georgia and the Carolinas. The number of commercial shad fishermen on the
Hudson and the Connecticut was down to a remnant few. On the Delaware, of the tens of dozens of commercial fisheries in the hundred and twenty miles between tidewater and Port Jervis, only the one in Lambertville survived. Richard Holcombe began it in 1771, on the small New Jersey island just north of the New Hope bridge. William Lewis took it over in 1888, and was on the island more than seventy years. His son, Fred Lewis, long in years, runs the fishery now. He remembers fishing fifty-two hours nonstop in one of the fishery\x{2019}s banner years. He calls it \x{201c}the longest day I ever put in.\x{201d} The day started at <<midnight|3b>> Sunday and finished on Wednesday at <<four A.M.|5>> When his crew today starts a typical haul, they walk up the riverbank some two thousand feet, lining a U.S. Army assault boat of the type that crossed the Rhine. They carry the net. A crewman stays ashore, holding one end, while the others row much of the way to Pennsylvania, and then drift downstream before rowing back to New Jersey, making inches per sweep. Two are at oars, a third is poling. They wear hip boots, sweatshirts, watch caps. Only the assault boat would look different to Thomas Eakins. And maybe Sue Meserve, pulling in the haul. She is Lewis\x{2019}s granddaughter-in-law. His grandson Steve Meserve is in the boat, too.
