The office was tidy, piles of papers arranged across the desk.

What if Claire and Ben were still sleeping together? Maybe she was calling him now, warning him. She suspects, she might be saying. Be careful.I remembered reading my journal earlier. Dr Nash had told me that I had once shown symptoms of paranoia. Claiming the doctors were conspiring against you, he\x{2019}d said. A tendency to confabulate. To invent things.What if that\x{2019}s all happening again? What if I am inventing this, all of it? Everything in my journal might be fantasy. Paranoia.I thought of what they\x{2019}d told me on the ward, and Ben in his letter. You were occasionally violent. I realized it might have been me who caused the fight on Friday night. Did I lash out at Ben? Perhaps he hit back and then, upstairs in the bathroom, I took a pen and explained it all away with a fiction.What if all this journal means is that I\x{2019}m getting worse again? That soon it really will be time for me to go back to Waring House?I went cold, suddenly convinced that this was why Dr Nash had wanted to take me there.
