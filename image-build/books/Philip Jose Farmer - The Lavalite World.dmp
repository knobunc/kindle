He pressed the minute stud on its side, and four glowing figures appeared briefly on the face. They were the numerical signs of the Lords. In Earth numerals, <<15:12|2>>. They did not mean anything here. There was no sun; the sky provided light and some heat. In any event, this planet had no steady rotation on any one plane, and there were no stars. The great reddish mass that had moved slowly across the sky, becoming larger every day, was no genuine moon. It was a temporary satellite, and it was falling.',

After filling his belly and washing his body, he slogged through knee-deep water along the base of the mountain. In an hour he\'d gotten by that and was walking on a plain. About "<<noon|13>>" the plain was tilting to one side, about ten degrees to the horizontal, and the water was running down it. Three hours later, it was beginning to tilt the other way. He ate the rest of the mud puppy and threw the bones, with much meat attached, on the ground. Scarlet crows settled down on it to dispute about the tidbits.',

Philea did not remarry until <<1916|9c:0>>. She had met in London a handsome well-to-do man from Indiana, Park Joseph Finnegan. The Foggs didn\'t like him because, one, he was of Irish descent, two, he was not an Episcopalian, and three, he had been seen with various ladies of the evening in gambling halls before he\'d asked Philea to marry him. She married him anyway and went to Terre Haute, which her relatives thought was still subject to raids by the redskins.',

They stopped only to excrete or to drink from the sea and to allow their beasts to quench their thirst. At dusk they went into the woods.
