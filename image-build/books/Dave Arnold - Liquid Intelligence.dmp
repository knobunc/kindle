            "Drinks should be measured by volume. I am a big believer in cooking by weight, but I mix drinks by volume, and so should you. Pouring out small volumes is much faster than weighing a bunch of small ingredients. Furthermore, the densities of cocktail ingredients vary wildly, from about .94 grams per millileter for straight booze to <<1.33|5a:0>> grams per millileter for maple syrup. For the bartender, the weight of the finished beverage isn\x{2019}t important, but the volume is. The volume determines how close the top of the finished drink will be to the rim of the glass. This liquid line is called the wash line, and maintaining a proper wash line is essential to good bartending. In a professional setting, it is essential that your drinks be consistent. Having standard wash lines for each drink you prepare gives you an instant visual check that everything is okay. If your wash line is wrong, something is wrong with the drink. Consistent wash lines are also important to your guests\x{2019} well-being. Two people get the same drink, but one drink sits higher in the glass: do you like the person with the taller pour more, or are your techniques just a bit shaky?",

In blind taste tests, people universally preferred the juice from a hand press over that obtained from the Sunkist, probably because the spinning reamer scrapes bitterness out of the white pith, or albedo, of the fruit.

Ten years ago there were two main options available for carbonation: soda siphons (which work poorly) and commercial carbonation rigs (for making soda in bars). <<Around 2005|9n:0>> I became aware of the carbonator cap made by the Liquid Bread company. Liquid Bread was started by home-brew nuts who wanted a way to take samples of home-brewed beer to competitions and their buddies without losing carbonation. They developed a plastic cap that fits on ordinary soda bottles and easily hooks up to a CO2 line via a cheap ball-lock connector obtainable from any home-brew shop. I started using that cap to carbonate cocktails, and it changed my world. There are now tons of options for carbonating at homes and at bars, and I have used many of them. None beats the carbonator cap. Other systems look better and use nicer-looking containers, but I\x{2019}ve never had bubbles that I really liked out of any other system.

Ball-lock connectors are special doodads that were designed in the 1950s to pressurize and dispense from 5-gallon soda kegs (<<one of two|10>> such systems; the other is known as pin-lock). Soda suppliers would ship the soda, known as premix soda, to bars and restaurants in those kegs. The competing system, also designed in the 1950s, is called bag-in-box. With a bag-in-box system, syrup is added to carbonated water at the last minute, just before the drink enters the glass. The two systems existed side-by-side for a while, but bag-in-box eventually won out and rendered soda kegs and their connectors obsolete. In the 1990s and early years of this century, while bag-in-box was consolidating its hegemony over the fountain soda world, the market was flooded with surplus premix soda kegs and connectors. Home brewers snatched them up. Buying surplus, home brewers (yep, I was one) could brew, keg, and tap their beers in convenient 5-gallon quantities, almost for free. Those were good times.
