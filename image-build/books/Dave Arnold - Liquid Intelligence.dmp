            "Carbon dioxide is the gas used to carbonate drinks. Ten years ago there were two main options available for carbonation: soda siphons (which work poorly) and commercial carbonation rigs (for making soda in bars). <<Around 2005|9n:0>> I became aware of the carbonator cap made by the Liquid Bread company. Liquid Bread was started by home-brew nuts who wanted a way to take samples of home-brewed beer to competitions and their buddies without losing carbonation. They developed a plastic cap that fits on ordinary soda bottles and easily hooks up to a CO2 line via a cheap ball-lock connector obtainable from any home-brew shop. I started using that cap to carbonate cocktails, and it changed my world. There are now tons of options for carbonating at homes and at bars, and I have used many of them. None beats the carbonator cap. Other systems look better and use nicer-looking containers, but I\x{2019}ve never had bubbles that I really liked out of any other system. As you\x{2019}ll see later in the Carbonation section, I\x{2019}m a bit of a bubble nut.",

            "The end result of all the experimentation isn\x{2019}t super-rosy, however, because even the 500-watters always break eventually; they just last a lot longer. Occasionally the insulation inside the heater cracks and fails from the incessant thermal cycling, which leads to arcs and sparks. This is rare in a 500-watt poker, and not dangerous like an arcing scenario with a 1500-watt poker, but it is startling. The most common mode of failure is the fadeaway. Over time the resistance wire inside the heater oxidizes. As it oxidizes the resistance goes up, the amount of power it produces goes down, and the drinks no longer ignite. The poker just fades away. A poker that lives in a busy bar and is turned on seven days a week from <<6 p.m.|5>> to 1 or <<2 a.m.|5>> has a lifetime of about a month before it fades. At home they would last a lot longer, but I\x{2019}ll never sell them. Imagine the insurance.

            "Grapefruit juice is characteristically bitter, mainly owing to the compound naringin. The bitterness of the naringin in grapefruit is counteracted by sugar (10.4%) and high acidity (<<2.40|5a:0>>%). To my taste, grapefruit juice balances perfectly in still drinks. In carbonated drinks, especially with gin, the bitterness becomes too much. Luckily, clarification removes some of grapefruit\x{2019}s bitterness. How much bitterness remains in the juice depends on the clarification technique you use. Most people making this recipe will clarify their juice using the seaweed gel agar (see the section on clarification, here). Agar strips a lot of bitterness from the juice and is a fantastic clarification technique for this drink.",

Many russeted apples share a pearlike note, but with more acid; Ashmead\x{2019}s has a bit of that but is more full-bodied than usual. The Brix can approach 18, which is very high, and it has a high acid to match. I don\x{2019}t have any hard data on the sugar-to-acid ratio, but I\x{2019}d guess it\x{2019}s <<around 14|9c:0>>.",
