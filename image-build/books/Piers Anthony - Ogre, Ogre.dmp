It was a long way away, so she rode the Diggle-worm, who could tunnel through rock without leaving a hole. They would be back <<after midnight|13>>. That meant several more hours, and Tandy was afraid.',

            'Tandy saw the creature clearly in her dream: a <<midnight|13>>-colored equine with faintly glowing eyes--there was the demon stigma!--set amidst a flaring forelock. The mane was glossy black, and the tail dark ebony; even the hooves were dusky. Yet she was a handsome animal, with fine features and good musculature. The black ears perked forward, the black nostrils flared, and the dark neck arched splendidly. Tandy knew this was an excellent representative of the species.',

John became very quiet; obviously she missed her own patterned wings. There were deerflies and horseflies and dragonflies, looking like winged miniatures of their species; the deerflies nibbled blades of grass, the horseflies kicked up their heels as they galloped, and the dragonflies even jetted small lances of fire. At <<one|9m>> spot there was music; fiddler flies were playing for damselflies to dance. It seemed to be a real fly ball.',
