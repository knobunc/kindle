At <<one-thirty|5b>>, the time of the job call, action would take place at the window. Job sheets, if any, would be posted on a corkboard. Meanwhile, there was a clipboard with a sheaf of papers headed \x{201c}OFFSHORE JOBS,\x{201d} showing positions that had been picked up in recent weeks and the age of the cards that had won them. Some of the runs were \x{201c}Coastwise,\x{201d} \x{201c}Far East,\x{201d} \x{201c}South America,\x{201d} \x{201c}N. Europe,\x{201d} \x{201c}R/World , \x{201c}W.

To make unexpected replacements, owners will fly people to foreign ports. In extremes, they have used the Concorde. Andy once turned up for a job call at the New York hall and that night was on a flight to Athens. On each offshore-job sheet was a \x{201c}Reason\x{201d} column, explaining why the job had come open: \x{201c}LOA\x{201d} (leave of absence), \x{201c}Quit,\x{201d} \x{201c}Fired.\x{201d} One sheet had called for a mariner to fly off at once on Iberia to Gibraltar. \x{201c}Rotary\x{201d} was the reason.

Sometimes you\x{2019}re right up on them before they turn on their lights.\x{201d} Mac remembers when the lookout rang a bell if he saw something to starboard, rang it twice if to port, and three times if an object was dead ahead. He even remembers when lookouts shouted, \x{201c}Lights are bright, sir!\x{201d} and the mate on the bridge shouted back, \x{201c}Aye, aye!\x{201d} On this ship, it would have to be some shout.

When we got off the Stella Lykes in Valparaiso, we were ashore scarcely six hours before the longshoremen had loaded the button-down shirts, and the ship was preparing to go. The crew members do not see much of the countries they come to. Andy, who was so pleased to be making a run for the first time to the west coast of South America, could not get off in Cartagena or in Guayaquil and had time in Balboa only for a short walk with me. In Guayaquil, the ship was moved from one berth to another at <<noon|13>>, and he had to be aboard for that, and then at <<four|3f>> he went on watch, and then we sailed. In the old days of the stick ships, turnaround time was long. A ship would sit in port a week or two. With the innovation of container ships and heavy-lift sheer-leg dockside cranes, the handling of cargo became intensely efficient. Our port visits are so brief that we often stay on sea watches. If port watches were set, a mate, for example, would be eight hours on and eight off, then eight more on and eight off, and then have thirty-two hours to himself. By that time, the Stella Lykes would be at least halfway to the next country. In the forty-two days of a voyage, J. Peter Fritz, the chief mate, who is in charge of cargo, usually goes ashore twice,
and only briefly. The captain goes ashore even more rarely. When he comes up the gangway in Charleston to begin his routine of two voyages, he figures that the next time he sets foot on land will be eighty-four days later, in the same place. Andy was once on a dry-cargo ship that was in port a week at a time, but since then he has seldom been in any port more than twenty-four hours. Join the merchant navy and glimpse the world. Glimpse, in fact, only the seaports of the world. I heard a crewman say, \x{201c}You get to Haifa, you can\x{2019}t get to Jerusalem. You get to Alexandria, you can\x{2019}t get to Cairo.\x{201d}",

wine. Ordinarily, he shoots the stars as an academic exercise, a way of keeping fresh his celestial navigation, which he figures out with his calculator and his dividers in the chartroom. As second mate, he enjoys his role as the ship\x{2019}s \x{201c}navigator\x{201d}\x{2014}laying out courses on charts. However, the essence of the navigation has been purloined by the computer SatNav, which receives its intelligence from satellites. Some days ago, Andy said, \x{201c}I almost wish the SatNav would bust down, so I could do something more challenging.\x{201d} This morning, he\x{2019}s got his wish. The SatNav\x{2019}s digital clock reads <<10:08|2>>:19 Greenwich mean time. It has read <<10:08|2>>:19 Greenwich mean time for two hours. As successive satellites have passed overhead, the SatNav has not accepted a fix. By taking fixes about once an hour, it ordinarily tells us, among other things, how far our next programmed way point is and where we are at the moment. In some places, such as the North Atlantic, there are redundant systems of electronic navigation\x{2014}Decca, for example, in North Europe, in addition to loran and SatNav. A nervous ship may be using them all. Down here in the Southeast Pacific, SatNav is alone. Other electronic systems are not in place here, or anywhere near here. The SatNav includes a feature called automatic heading, but in fact it doesn\x{2019}t know what your heading is unless you tell it. Having shot the stars and now the rising sun, Andy knows where we are. He wants to tell SatNav, but he is unable to. Like a person whose cursor has ceased to blink, he is locked out of SatNav\x{2019}s keyboard. He has never before faced such a problem. He is speed-reading the SatNav manual. He, too, is impervious
to the ship\x{2019}s roll. With his sextant, Andy could fix the horizon and shoot the sun from the bar of a flying trapeze.",

Like his lifelong friend Clayton Babineau, he coveted a job that would take him on short runs from his home port. Every ten days, the Marine Electric went out of Providence for Hampton Roads, and nine days later she came back. She went right past Peter\x{2019}s house. He night-mated her.

Biscay. The container ship Tuxpan disappears at <<noon|13>> in the middle of the North Atlantic with twenty-seven Mexicans aboard. A container from inside the hold is found on the surface.

In the Gulf of Mexico, off the mouth of the Rio Grande, fifteen Mexican shark-fishing vessels sink in one squall. In a fog near the entrance to the Baltic Sea, the Swedish freighter Syderfjord is cut in two in a collision and sinks in forty seconds. About a hundred miles off South Africa, the Arctic Career leaves an oil slick, some scattered debris, and no other clues. The Icelandic freighter Sudurland goes down in the Norwegian Sea. The Cathy Sea Trade, with twenty-seven, is last heard from off the Canary Islands. Off Portugal, the Testarossa sinks with thirty. Off eastern Spain, in the same storm, the cargo shifts on the Kyretha Star, and she sinks with eighteen or twenty. The Tina, a bulk carrier under the Cypriot flag, vanishes without a trace somewhere in the Sulu Sea. In a fog in the Formosa Strait, the Quatsino Sound goes down after colliding with the Ever Linking. In the English Channel, the Herald of Free Enterprise overturns with a loss of two hundred.

Off the Kentish coast with a hundred and thirty-seven thousand tons of crude, the tanker Skyron, of Liberian registry, plows a Polish freighter. The tanker bursts into flames. The fire is put out before it can reach the crude. Fifty-seven crewmen abandon two bulk carriers in the Indian Ocean. The Hybur Trader loses seventeen containers in a storm off Miami Beach.

At <<eight|9e>>, he had breakfast. At <<nine|9e>>, he turned to for deck maintenance, chipping and painting forward of the house. He greased the topping lifts on the No. 2 and No. 3 cranes.

This may not have been New York, but the Ecuadorian sun was hot. After lunch, he chipped and painted from <<one|20>> until <<four|9c:1>>, when he resumed walking the foredeck, on patrol.
