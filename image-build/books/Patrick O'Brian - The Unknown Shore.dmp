            "He crossed the bowling-green, hurried through the kitchen-garden into the park and along his private path towards the outer paling. During his absence at sea the path had almost vanished in the grass, but he knew it so well that he could follow it at <<midnight|13>> without a moon. He came to the pollard hornbeam that had always served as his ladder to get out of the park: there were rounded knobs on its gnarled old trunk that allowed one to reach the pointed ends of the pales, there to poise for the downward leap over the ditch and on to the soft bank that ran along the side of the lane below \x{2013} the lane that separated Plashey\x{2019}s land from Medenham\x{2019}s. Jack and his nearest cousin Georgiana had used this route from their most tender infancy; in those days the ascent of the tree had been a matter of tears, blood, barked shins and childish oaths, but now Jack swung up it with the ease of one to whom the maintopgallant masthead of a man-of-war is as easy and familiar as a pulpit to a parson, and he was just about to spring down when he saw Mr Elwes in the meadow over the way, gathering simples in a sky-blue coat and scarlet breeches. He was a man past the middle age, with a large yellow-grey face; he had a very great deal of energy, and as he sprang about the field he sang odd snatches, gesticulated, and harangued the yak that stood in the far corner. Jack shrank back into the leaves. Mr Elwes picked dittander, middle confound and stinking arrach; he picked nigwort, figwort and liriconfancy, adding thereto polypody of the oak, pellitory of Spain and herb true-love, and he offered a blade of the last to the yak as it stood panting in the shade of the ragged hedge. This monolithic beast had been imported by Mr Elwes, at vast expense, under the impression that it was the aurochs of antiquity \x{2013} it was supposed to improve the local breed of cattle out of all recognition, but it did nothing but lurk in the shade, gasping, and it was evident that the race of Nottinghamshire aurochs would soon die out. This was not the case with all his importations, however, and it was almost impossible to keep servants at Plashey, because of the salamanders. Salamanders in the library, salamanders that had to be rescued from the ashes of the drawing-room grate, the gentle plop of salamanders falling from stair to stair as they tried to mount to the attic to hibernate in the servants\x{2019} beds, but above all, salamanders multiplying in their thousands in the cellars that were Mr Elwes\x{2019} pride and joy. It was not as cellars that they delighted him, because he drank no wine, but as Saxon relics: he was a virtuoso, for whom anything old was better than anything new \x{2013} anything to do with the arts, that is to say, for in other respects he was wonderfully advanced, and he farmed his land upon the newest philosophical principles, designed great schemes for the improvement of mankind, and had invented several machines, including a musical treadmill and a hydraulic rack.",

Slowly Tobias looked from the slippers to Jack, and from Jack to the slippers.

I dare say his mates will invite you to mess with them.\x{2019} With these words he walked off, followed by his attendant, leaving Tobias in the cockpit; leaving him, too, in a state of confusion. He sat in the gloom, repeating \x{2018}abaft the foremast\x{2019} in an undertone, and trying to reconcile his ideas of the healthiness of a sea-going life \x{2013} unlimited fresh open air, and light \x{2013} with this appallingly fetid den in the darkness. He tried to remember the way by which he had been led into the cockpit; he wondered whether it would be improper to leave it, whether he would ever be fed, and if so, where. A little later there was a strange drumming noise, followed by an unrestrained bawling and hallooing: a body of men rushed along the deck, lit now by occasional gleams and the opening of ports, and the canvas walls of Tobias\x{2019} berth bulged inwards as human forms blundered past it, to vanish as suddenly as they had come, with a spirited howl.",

            "\x{2018}Not the same by no means,\x{2019} said Rose emphatically; and after he had shown Jack the hold and some of the finer points of stowing a very heavy and dangerously movable cargo, he returned to this subject. The dear old Pembroke might have been a pig in a cross-sea, he said, and she might have had the narrowest cruel hatches known in creation; there was certainly no room in her for a man to spit, as he might say, in a manner of speaking; she was an unhealthy ship, with mould three fingers deep on the beams, and the dear old Pembroke was obliged to be pumped morning, <<noon|13>> and night; but he would rather have the old Pembroke than a dozen Wagers, however dry and well found. Because why? Because the Pembroke\x{2019}s crew, though an ill-faced parcel of thieves to be sure, were men-of-war\x{2019}s men. You knew what to expect. With the people of this ship you did not know what to expect: he had never seen anything like it. In thirty-one years odd months of service he had never seen anything like it. \x{2018}It is not that they are pressed men,\x{2019} he said \x{2013} \x{2018}we are all pressed men, more or less. But I tell \x{2018}ee, Mr Byron, if anything untoward or nasty, as I might say in a manner of speaking \x{2013} if anything should happen, with such a pack aboard, why, mark my words \x{2013}\x{2019} Here he raised the lantern to give solemnity to his foreboding, uttered a terrible scream, clawed the air past Jack\x{2019}s left ear, struck his head against an upper-futtock rider and fell trembling in the bilge.",

But it was wonderful to see how this cloud of depression lifted from off the ship at the cry of land: it was just at two bells in the morning watch, at <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>> in the first grey of the dawn, when one can see farthest \x{2013} and although this is ordinarily a time when even the hardened mariner is feeling a little jaded, within a minute of the look-out\x{2019}s cry the decks were alive with the watch below, all looking as bright and pleased as the watch on duty.",

He made a brief appearance in the cabin to fetch his tarpaulin hat and jacket, remarked, with a grin, that \x{2018}it would be coming on to blow quite hearty, soon \x{2013} growing precious cold,\x{2019} and vanished, while a surge of sea-water slopped through the door as he opened it.",

The big tarpaulined form of Cozens blundered into him, and said, \x{2018}It\x{2019}s blowing up, mate. It\x{2019}s blowing up.\x{2019} It was indeed: by the light of the top-lantern Jack could see that they had set the fore, main and mizzen staysails, and he wondered they had dared to do it, for the Wager was lying down, and the shrieking of the wind in the rigging was higher than he had ever heard it. She was up as close to the wind as ever she would come, and a wicked cross-sea kept hammering her a little aft of her larboard bow; the torn spray and the rain drove in sideways so thick and hard that the poop-lantern was no more than a dim white blur. She was shipping a great deal of water; the waist of the ship was swirling deep, and it seemed to Jack that she was much heavier, much longer in coming up from her roll.",

Jack said \x{2018}Yes, ma\x{2019}am,\x{2019} and \x{2018}No, ma\x{2019}am,\x{2019} and \x{2018}Upon my word, ma\x{2019}am, you do not say so?\x{2019} at decent intervals and watched the sea-urchins pile up and walk slowly about on their purple prickles. At length the young woman climbed back in: her natural colour was brown, but with the cold she had gone a dismal purple, and her lips were bluish grey; she trembled violently, uncontrollably, and for some time she was too perished even to smile. The old woman chuckled tolerantly, slapped her with a paddle and they rowed off towards the east after the other canoes. In a quarter of an hour the young woman was quite recovered, and she talked away with never a pause until <<noon|13>>, when they all landed on a low, sheltered point, where the sea ran into various shallow creeks. Here they set up their wigwams. At one time Jack had esteemed himself reasonably good at withstanding the cold and the wet (he already had the nickname of Foulweather Jack in the Navy), but the young woman\x{2019}s performance had disabused him of this idea: and he had once thought himself tolerably handy, but now the old woman\x{2019}s expert erection of the wigwam set him right again. He tried to help, but it was no good: they gave him a couple of sea-urchins to keep him quiet and made him go and sit among the dogs: he had rarely felt humbler. Indeed, the dogs were far more useful than ever he could be, for presently the entire body, dogs and all, moved off to a sandy inlet; the dogs knew very well what was afoot, and when the women had all walked in about neck-deep, so that a line of them held a net across the narrowest part of the water, the dogs with one accord dived in at the far end \x{2013} dived, like so many otters \x{2013} and drove the fish that were in the creek towards the net. From time to time they came up, yapping, to breathe and to take their bearings, and, with extraordinary intelligence, they combined their efforts to beat the entire shoal into the extended net. It was an unusually numerous shoal, and it was an unusually fortunate day; they left barely a fish in this creek nor in the next, and before sunset they had taken as many as they could carry.",

They hurtled down the river with destruction on either hand, at a terrifying, lurching speed that brought them to the sea that night. The Indians hauled up on a stony beach and vanished into the woods, no doubt to an encampment that they knew. It was too dark to look for any food, and as they dared not wander away from the canoe, Jack and Tobias lay by it, on the stones under the sheeting rain. At <<about three in the morning|9h>> Jack made an attempt at joining the Indians by the fire that they had at last succeeded in lighting \x{2013} it glowed through the trees \x{2013} but this gave great offence, and they kicked and beat him away.",

But by then there was no remedy: the wind was strong behind them, and the canoe ran at a furious speed under a little, messy lug-sail made of bits of skin, blanket and the remains of the captain\x{2019}s canvas, sewn together with supplejack and suspended on a tripod of wigwam poles. Once they were out of the shelter of the cape the wind increased to such a pitch that they would have broached-to at the slightest attempt to alter their course; and shortly after this became evident, the bottom plank of the canoe split from stem to stern. The water rushed in, but the canoe did not fall apart; it held together by the fourteen stitches of quartered supplejack at each end, and, with all hands baling madly, it just kept afloat until Campbell managed to pass a twisted net about it and draw all taut with a tourniquet. This gave a certain amount of support, but it did little for the leak; with each rise and fall of the long canoe the split opened and the water from below joined the water that poured in over the side. The hardest baling could never get her clear, but so long as they never slackened for a moment the canoe would not sink. Hours and hours went by, and steadily the wind increased, driving the half-foundered boat on from wave to wave: at <<about four|3j>> the sky darkened with a leaden darkness, and then the snow came hissing down on the sea \x{2013} it fell so thick and fast that it settled on their shoulders as they worked, for ever baling with all their might, and often the canoe showed all white before the spray wiped it off again. The snow deadened the sea and the wind a little and this was fortunate for them, for it gave them fair warning of the thunderous surf right ahead in the darkness of the early night.",
