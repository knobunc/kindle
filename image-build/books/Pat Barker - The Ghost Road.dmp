Prior was being histrionic. And perhaps I was, Prior
thought, staring into the glass at the row of empty cubicles behind him,
feeling \'the worst things\' crowd in behind him, jostling for the privilege of
breathing down his neck. He\'d even, coming to himself at <<four|90>> or <<five o\'clock
in the morning|6>> with no idea of how the night had been spent,
thought it possible he might have killed somebody. And yet, why should that be
\'the worst thing\'? His reflection stared back at him, hollow-eyed. Murder was
only killing in the wrong place.',

the house. One was a vast carved oak sideboard that must surely have been built
in the dining-room, for it could never have been brought in through the door;
the other was a child\'s painted rocking-horse on the top floor of the house, in
a room with bars at the window. Everything else they found for themselves.

watched the movement of muscles in the back ahead of him, as they toiled and
sweated up the slope. Before them was a massive rock-wall with a cave set into
it, like a dark mouth. They slipped and slithered up towards it, sending
showers of small pebbles peppering down behind them. The final slope was
encumbered with big rocks and boulders, and other, flatter stones, some of them
sharp. It was <<near noon|13>>, and their shadows had dwindled to ragged black shapes
fluttering around their moving feet. One of the men picked up a stone and threw
it at the cave mouth to scare away the ghosts. Rivers and Hocart were the only
people there never to have visited the cave before, and they were not allowed
to approach until Njiru had prayed that they might be protected from disease.
While the prayer went on they watched the others bob down and disappear under
the hanging wall of rock.',

out a billeting problem. The woman who runs the farm had accused some of the
men in 'C' company of stealing eggs. They denied it vociferously, but I'm sure
she's right. After calming her down and paying her more for the eggs than they
were worth, I noticed a boy with red hair staring at me. Not staring exactly,
but his eyes met mine longer than was strictly necessary. <<About sixteen|9k:0>>, I
suppose. Perhaps a bit older. He was walking across
the yard clanking a bucket of pig swill, and after I'd taken leave of Madame
(his mother, I
think) I followed him into the fetid darkness, full of snuffling
and munching, pigs rooting round with moist quivering nostrils, trotting
towards him on delicate pink feet. After he poured the swill in they squealed and guzzled for a bit, then raised their
heads, watching us calmly from under long fine white eyelashes as they munched.
I scratched their backs and tried to talk to him. Chinks of sunlight came in
through gaps in the tiles, a smelly greenish wetness under foot. He spoke
rapidly and I got very little of it\x{2014}schoolboy French no use at all. I spun
back-scratching out as long as I could, then departed, wondering how much of
that initial look I'd imagined.",
