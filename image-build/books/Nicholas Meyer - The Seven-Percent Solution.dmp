            "For many years it was my good fortune to witness, chronicle, and in some instances to assist my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, in a number of the cases which were submitted to him in his unique capacity as a consulting detective. Indeed, in 1881,* when I committed to paper the substance of our first case together, Mr. Holmes was, as he said, the world's  only consulting detective. The ensuing years have seen that situation remedied to the satisfactory degree that today, in <<1939|9o>>, consulting detectives (if not actually known by that name) flourish both within and without the police contingent of nearly every country in the so-called civilized world. Many of them, I am gratified to see, employ the methods and techniques first developed by my singular friend so long ago\x{2014}though not all of them are gracious enough to give his genius the wealth of credit it deserves.",

It was raw and damp, and I went to the public house down the road for some brandy to warm my insides. While I was gone, two men came to see him. What they said I have no way of knowing, but I don\'t doubt that they were spies in his pay, come to tell him of my nets closing upon him. When I returned they had gone, and all was as I had left it. Then, this morning at <<eleven|9c:1>>, I received a wire from Wiggins. Sometime between the time I left and he assumed my place, the professor departed. How or where we have yet to discover. I came here as you saw me lest his friends should lie in ambush."',

It was an operation that lasted some minutes, and a good deal of steam escaped into the predawn air with a shriek and a shower of sparks, but the engineer was considerably relieved to have done it, and we gathered speed once more, contenting ourselves with the stationmaster\'s assurance that the Baron had no doubt encountered worse obstacles negotiating the big terminus at Linz.',
