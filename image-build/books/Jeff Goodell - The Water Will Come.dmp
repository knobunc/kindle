            "The first is the time required to design and build the barrier. After the 1966 flood, it took more than fifty years to settle on a plan to protect the city, then get it approved, funded, designed, and partially built. That kind of time scale might not be important if you are building, say, a new city hall. But when you\x{2019}re constructing something that has to adapt to climate change, fifty years is like fifty centuries. In 1966, sea-level rise was something that only a few scientists thought about: today, it\x{2019}s an existential threat to cities around the world. But even though the design for MOSE was not finalized until <<2000|9c:0>>, the estimates for sea-level rise were still woefully out of date. According to a UNESCO report, during the project planning phase, three sea-level rise scenarios for 2100 were considered. The estimate cited as \x{201c}most probable\x{201d} was 16 centimeters (about 6 inches); the one cited as most \x{201c}prudent\x{201d} was 22 centimeters (about 8 inches); the third scenario, labeled \x{201c}pessimistic,\x{201d} was 31.4 centimeters (about a foot). Planners recommended using the prudent scenario for design purposes. In a world where respected scientists are now suggesting that sea-level rise by 2100 could be six feet or more, designing a barrier for eight inches of sea-level rise looks, in retrospect, either like startling na\x{ef}vet\x{e9} or startling incompetence.",
