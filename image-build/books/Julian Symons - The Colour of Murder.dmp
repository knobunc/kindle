It is suggested by the prosecution that she met John Wilkins, accepted his invitation to walk by the sea, that there she resisted his attempts to make love to her, and that he killed her in a fit of passion. It is my duty to tell you that in this case there can be no question of any other verdict than that of wilful murder. The possibility that Wilkins is not competent to plead has not been raised by the defence, and no evidence has been offered in relation to it. This in spite of the fact that Wilkins can give no explanation of his movements between <<just after six-thirty that night|5>> and the next morning. Such brief periods of amnesia \x{2013} or, as they are commonly called, blackouts \x{2013} are not unknown after periods of heavy drinking, or under some mental stress, and although they might be used to suggest that the prisoner was not responsible for his actions, that suggestion has not been made by the defence.

Mr Fanum, you will remember, said that he saw a man come up from the beach to the promenade at <<twenty minutes to twelve|10>>, and identified that man as Wilkins. In his cross-examination Mr Newton made great play with a phrase the witness had used about a cry he heard on the beach, a cry which had in it, he said, \x{2018}the colour of murder\x{2019}. It is a fanciful phrase, and you may think that Mr Fanum is prone to such flights of fancy. He said the man\x{2019}s face was pale, and Mr Newton pointed out that all faces look pale under sodium lighting of the kind installed at this point on the beach. He suggested that Mr Fanum might have seen a photograph of the prisoner and was influenced by that in making his identification. You will have to decide how much significance to attach to Mr Fanum\x{2019}s evidence. Is he merely fanciful, or was it really the prisoner he saw coming up from the beach?",

On the other hand Mrs Wilkins, who looked at her bedside clock when the prisoner came into the bedroom, says it was then <<twenty-five minutes to twelve|10>>. Clearly they cannot both be correct. It is suggested by the defence that Shaddock was misled because he was reading the time only by a reflection of the clock in the hall. It is suggested by the prosecution that Mrs Wilkins was deceived by a clock outside, which struck the three-quarters when she thought it struck the half-hour. You will make up your minds which of these witnesses was mistaken. I must point out, however, that if you believe Mrs Wilkins, you will necessarily discount Mr Fanum\x{2019}s evidence, since if Wilkins entered his bedroom at <<twenty-five minutes to twelve|10>> he cannot possibly have been seen on the promenade five minutes later. I must point out, too, that the usual distrust felt of evidence given by a wife in her husband\x{2019}s defence has little application here. Much of what Mrs Wilkins had to say, under cross-examination, was so damaging to her husband, and it was evidence given with such remarkable composure, that she may be acquitted of any desire to shield him.",

She is a prostitute and one, as you will have gathered, who is not ashamed of her calling. Her evidence, taken alone, does not establish the prisoner\x{2019}s innocence. It does, however, place him in her house from roughly <<nine-thirty|5k:1>> to <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>>. It would have taken him some fifteen minutes to walk back to the spot where Sheila Morton was murdered, and that would mean he did not meet her until, say, a <<quarter past eleven|10>> or a little later. Mr Newton argued very forcibly that this left him little time to murder Miss Morton and be back in his room at the hotel at <<twenty-five minutes to twelve|10>>. This argument, of course, only has validity if you accept Mrs Wilkins\x{2019} evidence about the time of his return. Mr Newton also argued that if we accept Miss Prenton\x{2019}s story which places the time of meeting no earlier than <<eleven fifteen|5k:1>>, Miss Morton must have been out walking for more than an hour when she met Wilkins. He said that this was most unlikely, since her father was ill, and she had said she would not be very long. Does this argument seem to you conclusive? Bear in mind that she knew a night nurse was installed, that there was nothing she could do for her father, and that she had been with him continuously since his heart attack on Saturday evening.
