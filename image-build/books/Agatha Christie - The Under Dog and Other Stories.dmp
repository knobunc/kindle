While he was doing this, the Admiral and I strolled up and down the terrace, smoking cigars and enjoying the warm June air. We finished our smoke and our chat, and decided to get down to business. Just as we turned at the far end of the terrace, I fancied I saw a shadow slip out of the french window here, cross the terrace, and disappear. I paid very little attention, however.

            "\x{201c} \x{2018}Shall I have to lose all the money?\x{2019} I said, anxious like. He thought for a minute or two. \x{2018}There are always ways of getting round the law, Miss Dunn,\x{2019} he said at last. \x{2018}We as lawyers know that. The way out here is for you to have left your employment this afternoon.\x{2019} \x{2018}But my month?\x{2019} I said. \x{2018}My dear Miss Dunn,\x{2019} he said with a smile. \x{2018}You can leave an employer any minute by forfeiting a month\x{2019}s wages. Your mistress will understand in view of the circumstances. The difficulty is time! It is imperative that you should catch the <<11.05|5a:1>> from King\x{2019}s Cross to the north. I can advance you ten pounds or so for the fare, and you can write a note at the station to your employer. I will take it to her myself and explain the whole circumstances.\x{2019} I agreed, of course, and an hour later I was in the train, so flustered that I didn\x{2019}t know whether I was on my head or heels. Indeed by the time I got to Carlisle, I was half inclined to think the whole thing was one of those confidence tricks you read about. But I went to the address he had given me\x{2014}solicitors they were, and it was all right. A nice little house, and an income of three hundred a year. These lawyers knew very little, they\x{2019}d just got a letter from a gentleman in London instructing them to hand over the house to me and \x{a3}150 for the first six months. Mr. Crotchet sent up my things to me, but there was no word from Missus. I supposed she was angry and grudged me my bit of luck. She kept back my box too, and sent my clothes in paper parcels. But there, of course if she never had my letter, she might think it a bit cool of me.\x{201d}",
