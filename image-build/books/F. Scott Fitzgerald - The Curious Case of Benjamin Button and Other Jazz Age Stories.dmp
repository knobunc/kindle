            "One afternoon six months after his death she was sitting on the porch, in a black dress which took away the faintest suggestion of plumpness from her figure. It was Indian summer\x{2014}golden brown all about her; a hush broken by the sighing of leaves; westward a <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> sun dripping streaks of red and yellow over a flaming sky. Most of the birds had gone\x{2014}only a sparrow that had built itself a nest on the cornice of a pillar kept up an intermittent cheeping varied by occasional fluttering sallies overhead. Roxanne moved her chair to where she could watch him and her mind idled drowsily on the bosom of the afternoon.",

            "It is true that Fitzgerald earned his living writing stories: by <<1929|9n:0>>, he could command \$4,000 per story from The Saturday Evening Post  (perhaps equivalent to as much as \$50,000 in today\x{2019}s currency), and over the length of his career between 1919 and 1940, Fitzgerald earned more than \$240,000 from the publication of his stories, while he earned less than \$100,000 from advances and royalties on his novels. But the fact that story writing was Fitzgerald\x{2019}s financial mainstay should not overshadow his accomplishments as an author of short fiction. Fitzgerald wrote stories from the time he was an adolescent until he died at the age of forty-four; during his career he assembled four collections of stories that he carefully edited and revised for book publication. Even though he often disparaged and misjudged the quality of his stories, it is clear that Fitzgerald was as serious about the craft of story writing as he was about becoming a novelist; moreover, Fitzgerald\x{2019}s stories are not merely the pretexts for his novels\x{2014}many of them stand alone as the discrete productions of a major writer who used the form of the short story to experiment with new styles, innovative narrative strategies, and emerging concepts. For Fitzgerald, the short story also offered to a form in which he could try out his artistry, and in which he could capture in kaleidoscopic  fashion scenes of American life and culture as they passed by with the increasing velocity of what has come to be known as \x{201c}the Jazz Age.\x{201d}",
