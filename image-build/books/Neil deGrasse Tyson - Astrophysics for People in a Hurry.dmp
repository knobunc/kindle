            "In any reliably surveyed volume of space, dwarf galaxies outnumber large galaxies by more than <<ten to one|10a:0>>. The first essay I ever wrote on the universe, in the early 1980s, was titled \x{201c}The Galaxy and the Seven Dwarfs,\x{201d} referring to the Milky Way\x{2019}s diminutive nearby family. Since then, the tally of local dwarf galaxies has been counted in the dozens. While full-blooded galaxies contain hundreds of billions of stars, dwarf galaxies can have as few as a million, which renders them a hundred thousand times harder to detect. No wonder they are still being discovered in front of our noses.",

            "One of the most powerful and far-reaching theoretical models ever devised, already introduced in these pages, is Einstein\x{2019}s general theory of relativity\x{2014}but you can call it GR after you get to know it better. Published in 1916, GR outlines the relevant mathematical details of how everything in the universe moves under the influence of gravity. Every few years, lab scientists devise ever more precise experiments to test the theory, only to further extend the envelope of the theory\x{2019}s accuracy. A modern example of this stunning knowledge of nature that Einstein has gifted us, comes from <<2016|9c:0>>, when gravitational waves were discovered by a specially designed observatory tuned for just this purpose.\x{2020} These waves, predicted by Einstein, are ripples moving at the speed of light across the fabric of space-time, and are generated by severe gravitational disturbances, such as the collision of two black holes.",

            'Meanwhile, beginning in 1979, the American physicist Alan H. Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and others, advanced an adjustment to the big bang theory that cleared up some nagging problems with getting a universe to be as smoothly filled with matter and energy as ours is known to be. A fundamental by-product of this update to the big bang was that it drives omega toward one. Not toward a half. Not toward two. Not toward a million. <<Toward one|9k:0>>.',

            "Aluminum occupies nearly ten percent of Earth\x{2019}s crust yet was unknown to the ancients and unfamiliar to our great-grandparents. The element was not isolated and identified until <<1827|9c:0>> and did not enter common household use until the late 1960s, when tin cans and tin foil yielded to aluminum cans and, of course, aluminum foil. (I\x{2019}d bet most old people you know still call the stuff tin foil.) Polished aluminum makes a near-perfect reflector of visible light and is the coating of choice for nearly all telescope mirrors today.",

            "<<Before 1800|9n:0>> the word \x{201c}light,\x{201d} apart from its use as a verb and an adjective, referred just to visible light. But early that year the English astronomer William Herschel observed some warming that could only have been caused by a form of light invisible to the human eye. Already an accomplished observer, Herschel had discovered the planet Uranus in 1781 and was now exploring the relation between sunlight, color, and heat. He began by placing a prism in the path of a sunbeam. Nothing new there. Sir Isaac Newton had done that back in the 1600s, leading him to name the familiar seven colors of the visible spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. (Yes, the colors do indeed spell Roy G. Biv.) But Herschel was inquisitive enough to wonder what the temperature of each color might be. So he placed thermometers in various regions of the rainbow and showed, as he suspected, that different colors registered different temperatures.\x{2020}",

            "By spending a couple of years painstakingly tracking and timing the static hiss that registered on his jury-rigged antenna, Jansky had discovered that radio waves emanate not just from local thunderstorms and other known terrestrial sources, but also from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. That region of the sky swung by the telescope\x{2019}s field of view every <<twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes|14>>: exactly the period of Earth\x{2019}s rotation in space and thus exactly the time needed to return the galactic center to the same angle and elevation on the sky.
