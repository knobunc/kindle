The curb check was something that Lucky Dragon's parent corporation, back in Singapore, had instituted on the advice of an in-house team of American cultural anthropologists. Mr. Park, the night manager, had explained this to Rydell, ticking off points on his notebook. He'd tapped each paragraph on the screen for emphasis, sounding thoroughly bored with the whole thing, but Rydell had supposed it was part of the job, and Mr. Park was a definite stickler. \x{201c}In order to demonstrate Lucky Dragon's concern with neighborhood safety, security personnel will patrol curb in front of location on a nightly basis.\x{2019}\x{201d} Rydell had nodded. \x{201c}You not out of store too long,\x{201d} Mr. Park added, by way of clarification. \x{201c}Five minute.

There were a couple of Universal square badges controlling entry, a firm that mostly did low-level industrial security.
