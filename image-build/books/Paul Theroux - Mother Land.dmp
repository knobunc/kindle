The paint cans, the jars of nails, the rope, the coils of wire, the rusty screwdrivers, the ball of string, the stack of folded brown grocery bags. The yellowed newspaper clippings went. They had been nailed to the wall, and some of them were very old: one said WAR IS OVER, another said PEACE AT LAST, the Boston papers from <<1945|9c:0>>. Some were newspaper pictures of us. Floyd shooting a basket in a high school gym. Fred bundled up in a hockey uniform, his stick poised, pretending to slap a puck. Me holding a trophy from the science fair. Hubby in a group of serious-faced Boy Scouts en route to a jamboree. Clipped-out mentions of events, such as band concerts and ball games. Others were snapshots. Of Franny and her terrified prom date. Of Franny when she was a nun, draped in her penguin outfit. Of Rose, a pretty child in a white dress, hands folded: first communion. Of Gilbert smiling across the bridge of his violin. Several were attempts at family photos, but they were amateurish and awkward\x{2014}there were too many of us, the camera was cheap, we looked like a discontented mob.",
