            "Any semiautomatic pistol was a technological antique, but this one was more so than most. In point of fact, its design was over two thousand T-years old, for it was an exact replica of what had once been known as a \x{201c}Model 1911A1\x{201d} firing a \x{201c}.45 ACP\x{201d} cartridge. It was quite a handful, with an unloaded weight of just under 1.3 kilograms in Grayson\x{2019}s <<1.17|5a:0>> standard gravities, and the recoil was formidable. Its antiquity didn\x{2019}t make it any less noisy, either, and despite their ear protectors, more than one of the armsmen on the neighboring firing lanes winced as the 11.43-millimeter slug rumbled down range at a mere 275 MPS. That was a paltry velocity, even beside the auto-loaders to which the Grayson tech base had been limited before the Yeltsin System joined the Alliance, much less the 2,000-plus MPS at which a modern pulser punched out its darts, but the massive fifteen-gram bullet still reached the end of its fifteen-meter journey with formidable kinetic energy. The jacketed slug exploded through the equally anachronistic paper target\x{2019}s \x{201c}X\x{201d} ring in a shower of small white fragments, then vanished in a fiery flash as it plowed into the focused grav wall \x{201c}backstop\x{201d} and vaporized.",

The repair ship\x{2019}s crew was obviously frightened at having those grim, heavily armed and armored troopers aboard their ship, but there was nothing they could have done to prevent them from boarding. The most cursory examination showed the ship was even slower than Honor had anticipated, a big, lumbering mobile repair yard, capable of a maximum acceleration of no more than <<1.37|5a:0>> KPS2. Nor was it armed in any way. It didn\x{2019}t even mount point defense, which turned it into a target waiting to be killed whenever one of Harmon\x{2019}s skippers decided to press his firing key, and its crew knew it.",
