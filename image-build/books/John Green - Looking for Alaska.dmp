We asked Lara and Takumi to come along, but they were tired of chasing ghosts, and besides, finals were coming.',

            "You've mostly figured this out, but the truth is that I saw her that night. I'd stayed up late with Lara and some people, and then I was falling asleep and I heard her crying outside my back window. It was like <<3:15 that morning|2a>>, maybe, and I walked out there and saw her walking through the soccer field. I tried to talk to her, but she was in a hurry. She told me that her mother was dead eight years that day, and that she always put flowers on her mother's grave on the anniversary, but she forgot that year. She was out there looking for flowers, but it was too early\x{2014}too wintry. That's how I knew about January 10. I still have no idea whether it was suicide.",
