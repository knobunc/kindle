It was called, I understand, the Three Horned Lady. Each person in turn uttered the following phrase, \x{2018}I went to Paris and bought\x{2014}\x{2019} adding some article. The next person repeated that and added a further article and the object of the game was to memorise in their proper order the articles thus enumerated, some of them, I may say, of a most monstrous and ridiculous nature. A piece of soap, a white elephant, a gate-legged table and a Muscovy duck were, I remember, some of the items. The difficulty of memorisation lay, of course, in the totally unrelated nature of the objects\x{2014}the lack of sequence, so to speak. As in the list you have just shown me. By the time that, say, twelve objects had been mentioned, to enumerate them in their proper order became almost impossible. A failure to do so resulted in a paper horn being handed to the competitor and he or she had to continue the recitation next time in the terms, \x{2018}I, a one horned lady, went to Paris,\x{2019} etc. <<After three|9:0>> horns had been acquired, retirement was compulsory, the last left in was the winner.\x{201d}",
