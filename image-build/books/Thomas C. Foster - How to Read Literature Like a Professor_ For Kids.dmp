            "Still, the old name, the one James actually uses, works even better. Daisy does indeed suffer from Roman fever. She\x{2019}s in an overheated, frantic state of eagerness to join the snobby upper class. (\x{201c}We\x{2019}re dying to be exclusive,\x{201d} she says early on.) When she makes her fatal <<midnight|13>> trip to the Colosseum and is ignored by Winterbourne, she says, \x{201c}He cuts me dead.\x{201d} And the next thing we know, she is dead. Roman fever perfectly captures what happens to Daisy, this fresh young thing from the wilds of America (Schenectady, actually). She\x{2019}s killed by the clash between her own lively youth and the rotten atmosphere of Europe, the Old World.",
