These airborne molecules can enter our upper nasal passages, either directly through the nose or through the back of the mouth when we eat the spice. In the upper nasal passages the molecules lock onto olfactory receptors, which fire nerve cells to generate a smell signal. These signals are interpreted in the cortex of the brain, along with taste signals received from our taste buds, to produce the overall sensation of what we call flavor. Although we habitually localize flavor in the mouth, anywhere between 70 and 85 percent of the flavor of our foods is contributed by our sense of smell.',
