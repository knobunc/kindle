A normal-sized wine cork is 24 mm (about 0.94 in.) in diameter; it is compressed and inserted into an 18 mm (0.71 in.) bottle neck by a \x{201c}corker\x{201d} machine. (Cork is quite compressible.) Champagne corks, on the other hand, are 31 mm (<<1.22|5a:0>> in.) in diameter and are squeezed into a 17.5 mm (0.69 in.) neck, with the top third of the cork sticking out as a \x{201c}head\x{201d} that can be grasped for opening. As soon as it is liberated from confinement, the bottom portion, which is soft and wet, expands back to its original diameter. (Cork is also quite elastic.)",
