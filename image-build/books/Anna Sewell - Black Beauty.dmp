            "There was before us a long piece of level road by the river side; John said to me, \"Now, Beauty, do your best,\" and so I did; I wanted no whip nor spur, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could lay my feet to the ground; I don't believe that my old grandfather, who won the race at Newmarket, could have gone faster. When we came to the bridge John pulled me up a little and patted my neck. \"Well done, Beauty! good old fellow,\" he said. He would have let me go slower, but my spirit was up, and I was off again as fast as before. The air was frosty, the moon was bright; it was very pleasant. We came through a village, then through a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, till after eight miles' run we came to the town, through the streets and into the market\x{2013}place. It was all quite still except the clatter of my feet on the stones\x{2014}everybody was asleep. The church clock struck <<three|11>> as we drew up at Dr.\x{a0}White's door. John rang the bell twice, and then knocked at the door like thunder. A window was thrown up, and Dr.\x{a0}White, in his nightcap, put his head out and said, \"What do you want?\"",

It was all very grand, and three or four times as large as the old house at Birtwick, but not half so pleasant, if a horse may have an opinion. Two footmen were standing ready, dressed in drab livery, with scarlet breeches and white stockings. Presently we heard the rustling sound of silk as my lady came down the flight of stone steps. She stepped round to look at us; she was a tall, proud\x{2013}looking woman, and did not seem pleased about something, but she said nothing, and got into the carriage. This was the first time of wearing a check\x{2013}rein, and I must say, though it certainly was a nuisance not to be able to get my head down now and then, it did not pull my head higher than I was accustomed to carry it. I felt anxious about Ginger, but she seemed to be quiet and content.",
