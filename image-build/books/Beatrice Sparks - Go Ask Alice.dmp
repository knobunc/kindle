Something went wrong and the lights haven\x{2019}t been turned on and I think even Dad is about ready to turn around and go back home. Mom had made a diagram of where she wanted the movers to put everything and they got it all fouled up. So we\x{2019}re all just going to roll up in bedding and sleep in whichever bed is handy. I\x{2019}m glad I\x{2019}ve got my little pocket flashlight, at least I can see to write.
