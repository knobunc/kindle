         our heels and get to the real meat of the story. Sometimes these programs are based upon the novels written by many of your

         our daily newspapers, contacting the survivors or perpetrators, and buying their stories, which are then adapted by any number
         of our skilled writers. This was the case with \x{201c}The Boiling of Sister Katherine,\x{201d} a tragic event which I think we explored
