            "When I was six or seven, I learned something about my father I\x{2019}d never known. One day I asked him, \x{201c}Daddy, why are you so old?\x{201d} He hoisted up his eyebrows at this, so that they formed little sagging umbrellas over his eyes. And he let out a long breath, and shook his head and said, \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t know.\x{201d} When I turned to my mother, she gave me a look meaning she would answer the question for me another time. The following day without saying a word, she walked me down the hill toward the village and turned at a path into a graveyard in the woods. She led me to three graves in the corner, with three white marker posts much taller than I was. They had stern-looking black characters written top to bottom on them, but I hadn\x{2019}t attended the school in our little village long enough to know where one ended and the next began. My mother pointed to them and said, \x{201c}Natsu, wife of Sakamoto Minoru.\x{201d} Sakamoto Minoru was the name of my father. \x{201c}Died age twenty-four, in the nineteenth year of Meiji.\x{201d} Then she pointed to the next one: \x{201c}Jinichiro, son of Sakamoto Minoru, died age six, in the nineteenth year of Meiji,\x{201d} and to the next one, which was identical except for the name, Masao, and the age, which was <<three|9f>>. It took me a while to understand that my father had been married before, a long time ago, and that his whole family had died. I went back to those graves not long afterward and found as I stood there that sadness was a very heavy thing. My body weighed twice what it had only a moment earlier, as if those graves were pulling me down toward them.",

She acted like a dog around him. When he went somewhere, he looked back over his shoulder to signal that she should follow, and she always did. I didn\x{2019}t expect to see her again until dinnertime, but as I neared the house I caught sight of her on the path ahead of me, leaning against a tree. If you\x{2019}d seen what was happening, you might have understood it right away; but I was only a little girl.

And being an empress she would have been very displeased, upon returning late at night, to find her palace dark and all the servants asleep. That is to say, when she came home too drunk to unbutton her socks, someone had to unbutton them for her; and if she felt hungry, she certainly wasn\x{2019}t going to stroll into the kitchen to prepare something by herself\x{2014}such as an umeboshi ochazuke, which was a favorite snack of hers, made with leftover rice and pickled sour plums, soaked in hot tea. Actually, our okiya wasn\x{2019}t at all unusual in this respect. The job of waiting up to bow and welcome the geisha home almost always fell to the most junior of the \x{201c}cocoons\x{201d}\x{2014}as the young geisha-in-training were often called. And from the moment I began taking lessons at the school, the most junior cocoon in our okiya was me. <<Long before midnight|13>>, Pumpkin and the two elderly maids were sound asleep on their futons only a meter or so away on the wood floor of the entrance hall; but I had to go on kneeling there, struggling to stay awake until sometimes as late as <<two o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>. Granny\x{2019}s room was nearby, and she slept with her light on and her door opened a crack. The bar of light that fell across my empty futon made me think of a day, not long before Satsu and I were taken away from our village, when I\x{2019}d peered into the back room of our house to see my mother asleep there. My father had draped fishing nets across the paper screens to darken the room, but it looked so gloomy I decided to open one of the windows; and when I did, a strip of bright sunlight fell across my mother\x{2019}s futon and showed her hand so pale and bony.

The day wasn\x{2019}t especially hot, and I didn\x{2019}t care for shaved ice; but eating it would make my encounter with the Chairman linger. So I bought a paper cone of shaved ice with cherry syrup on it, and went to sit again on the same stone wall. The taste of the syrup seemed startling and complex, I think only because my senses were so heightened. If I were a geisha like the one named Izuko, I thought, a man like the Chairman might spend time with me. I\x{2019}d never imagined myself envying a geisha. I\x{2019}d been brought to Kyoto for the purpose of becoming one, of course; but up until now I\x{2019}d have run away in an instant if I could have.

I think of myself as an obedient woman; up until this time I\x{2019}d generally done the things told to me by Mother, or Mameha, or even Hatsumomo when I\x{2019}d had no other choice; but I felt such a combination of anger at Mother and longing for Yasuda-san that I made up my mind right then to do the very thing Mother had ordered me most explicitly not to do. I asked him to meet me in that very teahouse at <<midnight|13>>, and I left him there alone.",

            "<<Just before midnight|10>> I came back and spoke to a young maid. I promised her an indecent sum of money if she would see to it that no one disturbed Yasuda-san and me in one of the upstairs rooms for half an hour. I was already there, waiting in the dark, when the maid slid open the door and Yasuda-san stepped inside. He dropped his fedora onto the mats and pulled me to my feet even before the door was closed. To press my body against his felt so satisfying, like a meal after a long spell of hunger. No matter how hard he pressed himself against me, I pressed back harder. Somehow I wasn\x{2019}t shocked to see how expertly his hands slipped through the seams in my clothing to find my skin. I won\x{2019}t pretend I experienced none of the clumsy moments I was accustomed to with the General, but I certainly didn\x{2019}t notice them in the same way. My encounters with the General reminded me of a time as a child when I\x{2019}d struggled to climb a tree and pluck away a certain leaf at the top. It was all a matter of careful movements, bearing the discomfort until I finally reached my goal. But with Yasuda-san I felt like a child running freely down a hill. Sometime later when we lay exhausted upon the mats together, I moved his shirttail aside and put my hand on his stomach to feel his breathing. I had never in my life been so close to another human being before, though we hadn\x{2019}t spoken a word.",

            "I set to work that very afternoon carrying my things through the hall. I wish I could say I\x{2019}d accumulated a collection of beautiful objects as Mameha probably had by my age; but the mood of the nation had changed greatly. Cosmetics and permanents had recently been banned as luxuries by the military government\x{2014}though of course those of us in Gion, as playthings of the men in power, still did more or less as we pleased. Lavish gifts, however, were almost unheard of, so I\x{2019}d accumulated nothing more over the years than a few scrolls, inkstones, and bowls, as well as a collection of stereoscopic photos of famous views, with a lovely viewer made of sterling silver, which the Kabuki actor Onoe Yoegoro XVII had given to me. In any case, I carried these things across the hall\x{2014}along with my makeup, undergarments, books, and magazines\x{2014}and piled them in the corner of the room. But as late as the following evening, Hatsumomo and Pumpkin still hadn\x{2019}t begun moving their things out. On the way back from my lessons at <<noon|13>> on the third day, I made up my mind that if Hatsumomo\x{2019}s bottles and ointments were still crowded together on the makeup stand, I would go ask Auntie to help me.",

            "In any case, <<around nine o\x{2019}clock that night|6>>, we crossed the river to the Pontocho district. Unlike Gion, which sprawls over many blocks, Pontocho is just a single long alleyway stretched out along one bank of the river. People call it an \x{201c}eel\x{2019}s bed\x{201d} because of its shape. The autumn air was a bit chilly that night, but Shojiro\x{2019}s party was outdoors anyway, on a wooden verandah standing on stilts above the water. No one paid us much attention when we stepped out through the glass doors. The verandah was beautifully lit with paper lanterns, and the river shimmered gold from the lights of a restaurant on the opposite bank. Everyone was listening to Shojiro, who was in the middle of telling a story in his singsong voice; but you should have seen the way Hatsumomo\x{2019}s expression soured when she caught sight of us. I couldn\x{2019}t help remembering a damaged pear I\x{2019}d held in my hand the day before, because amid the cheerful faces, Hatsumomo\x{2019}s expression was like a terrible bruise.",

            "On Saturday morning I awakened early and slid back the paper screen over my window to find a cold rain falling against the glass. In the little alleyway below, a young maid was just climbing to her feet again after slipping on the icy cobblestones. It was a drab, miserable day, and I was afraid even to read my almanac. By <<noon|13>> the temperature had dropped still further, and I could see my breath as I ate lunch in the reception room, with the sound of icy rain tapping against the window. Any number of parties that evening were canceled because the streets were too hazardous, and at nightfall Auntie telephoned the Ichiriki to be sure Iwamura Electric\x{2019}s party was still on. The mistress told us the telephone lines to Osaka were down, and she couldn\x{2019}t be sure. So I bathed and dressed, and walked over to the Ichiriki on the arm of Mr. Bekku, who wore a pair of rubber overshoes he\x{2019}d borrowed from his younger brother, a dresser in the Pontocho district.",

            "In any case, as I say, the Chairman permitted me to accompany him on his second trip to America. I traveled alone by rail to Tokyo, and from there we flew together on an airplane bound for Hawaii, where we spent a few remarkable days. The Chairman bought me a bathing suit\x{2014}the first I\x{2019}d ever owned\x{2014}and I sat wearing it on the beach with my hair hanging neatly at my shoulders just like other women around me. Hawaii reminded me strangely of Amami; I worried that the same thought might occur to the Chairman, but if it did, he said nothing about it. From Hawaii, we continued to Los Angeles and finally to New York. I knew nothing about the United States except what I\x{2019}d seen in movies; I don\x{2019}t think I quite believed that the great buildings of New York City really existed. And when I settled at last into my room at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, and looked out the window at the mountainous buildings around me and the smooth, clean streets below, I had the feeling I was seeing a world in which anything was possible. I confess I\x{2019}d expected to feel like a baby who has been taken away from its mother; for I had never before left Japan, and couldn\x{2019}t imagine that a setting as alien as New York City would make me anything but fearful. Perhaps it was the Chairman\x{2019}s enthusiasm that helped me to approach my visit there with such goodwill. He\x{2019}d taken a separate room, which he used mostly for business; but every night he came to stay with me in the suite he\x{2019}d arranged. Often I awoke in that strange bed and turned to see him there in the dark, sitting in a chair by the window holding the sheer curtain open, staring at Park Avenue below. One time <<after two o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>, he took me by the hand and pulled me to the window to see a young couple dressed as if they\x{2019}d come from a ball, kissing under the street lamp on the corner.",
