Peter, who has not seen the toothsome Tess for weeks, has finally managed to construct a means of communication. They leave notes for each other behind a loose brick of an old gatepost. He is trying to arrange a rendezvous as far away from Abbey as possible and together we have come up with the idea that it might be best achieved during the night exercise which, according to Tozer, is due to take place in the woodland around Ringford. Ben quizzed a school gardener who lived in Heringham and he said there was a nice pub in Ringford called the Lamb and Flag.

I bumped into Marius Leeping on Madison Avenue today. He was coming out of a hotel and looked flushed and unsteady on his feet \x{2013} too many cocktails. It was <<4.00 in the afternoon|2a>>. I smiled politely, nodded hello and tried to pass by but he grabbed my arm. He called me a \x{2018}petit connard\x{2019} and a \x{2018}goddam creep\x{2019} who was trying to come between him and his father. I said that if anything was going to come between a son and his father, then the son stealing \$30,000 from his father might explain it. He took a swing at me and missed. I pushed him away. I\x{2019}m fifty years old and can\x{2019}t be brawling with young men in the streets of New York any more. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m gonna get you, you fucking prick!\x{2019} he yelled at me. \x{2018}Yeah, yeah, yeah,\x{2019} I said and wandered off.

We had one tricky experience at a lonely roadblock where young soldiers, beer heavy on their breath, ordered us out of the car, waving their guns theatrically. I gave them some money and cigarettes, which calmed them down, and they told us that the other journalists were at the Roundabout Hotel near a town called Manjo, just south of Aba.

I sleep well and breakfast late on the terrace. Then I wander about the town, buy a newspaper and at lunchtime usually make my way up through the dunes to the beach and have a beer and a sandwich at one or other of the beach shacks. Dinner at <<8.00|3:1>> sharp Chez Yvette: invariably oysters, grilled fish, tarte du jour and a bottle of wine. The wine could be better, so I asked Yvette if she would mind if I supplied my own \x{2013} no problem, she said, as long as I didn\x{2019}t object to paying un petit suppl\x{e9}ment.",

            "This afternoon I found an ideal place behind a thick clump of brambles that gave me a good view of the gates, about thirty yards away across the road. I laid down a plastic groundsheet and hid half a bottle of brandy under a fallen tree. It\x{2019}s dark by <<9.30|3:1>> or <<10.00|20a>> at this time of the year3 and the minimal temperature is forecast to be about 8 or 9 degrees. I\x{2019}ll wrap up well.",

            "The first night \x{2013} nothing to report. In fact it was rather magical being out in the woods <<after midnight|13>>. It was a cool night but I stayed warm with the help of little burning sips of Cognac from time to time. I felt no tiredness: the adrenalin keeping me awake and alert. As a rudimentary weapon I had an old poker with me from the fire at home \x{2013} not that I intended to use it, but it was reassuring, none the less. The woods were full of movement \x{2013} crunchings, rustlings \x{2013} and at one stage I was convinced there was someone walking around somewhere behind me. I was aware of a large presence parting the branches, pushing through the undergrowth, but I realized after a while it must have been a deer. Between <<midnight|13>> and <<2 o\x{2019}clock|6>> I counted seven cars and two motorbikes and the last half-hour was dead quiet. I could feel my old heart leap with excitement every time I saw the wash of lights from a car illuminate the trees. I remembered when I had felt like this before: my night drop into Switzerland in \x{2018}44 \x{2013} a few months before Benoit Verdel liberated Sainte-Sabine.",

            "It happened <<just after 1 a.m.|10>> I was beginning to feel tired \x{2013} three late nights in a row was too much for me and I felt my body stiffening up in protest. Suddenly I saw a flare of headlights from a car moving unusually slowly. Then it stopped and I heard the sound of a diesel engine idling for a few seconds and then it cut out and the lights were switched off. Soon I heard a mutter of voices and the sound of footsteps coming along the road towards the gate. It was not a dark night \x{2013} there was enough moonglow to cast a faint shadow. I saw two men walking along the road, one of them carrying a bulky object in his hand. The first man took up a position of guard in the middle of the road, watching for oncoming lights, while the second approached the plaque. Too late, I realized what he was going to do, but I rose to my feet, poker in hand, and blundered out of the bushes, switching on my torch and shouting, \x{2018}Right! I\x{2019}ve got you! Stop what you\x{2019}re doing! I\x{2019}m calling the police!\x{2019} The one on the road began to advance on me threateningly but the man by the plaque said, \x{2018}Stop. Leave him.\x{2019} I shone my torch in his face \x{2013} I thought I recognized the voice. It was Lucien Gorce, my friend and neighbour. He had just painted a black swastika on Benoit Verdel\x{2019}s memorial.",

A cold beer on a pavement table of the Caf\x{e9} de France \x{2013} Marie Th\x{e9}r\x{e8}se inside making me a sandwich au camembert. Munching the knob off a fresh baguette as I wander back from Sainte-Sabine. The farinaceous smell of the white dust raised by a breeze from the driveway. A cuckoo sounding in the perfectly silent woods beyond the meadow. The huge grey, cerise, pink, orange and washed-out blue of a sunset seen from my rear terrace. The drilling of the cicadas at <<noon|13>> \x{2013} the soft dialling-tone of the crickets as dusk slowly gathers. A good book, a hammock and a cold, beaded bottle of blanc sec. A rough red wine and steak frites. The cool, dark, shuttered silence of my bedroom \x{2013} and, as I go to sleep, the prospect that all this will be available to me again, unchanged, tomorrow.",
