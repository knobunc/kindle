            "For a time, Lizzie rallied. However, a year after the initial infection, Alcott told her journal, \x{201c}I fear she may slip away, for she never seemed to care much for the world beyond home.\x{201d}44 By September 1857, Lizzie was failing fast. In the midst of her illness, Bronson Alcott chose again to move the family, this time back again for a third sojourn in Concord. This time, for the grand sum of \$945, he purchased a hundred-fifty-year-old house on Lexington Road, a short walk westward from the Hillside house that had housed his family a decade earlier. Because the property featured at least forty apple trees, he christened his new home Orchard House. The structure was too dilapidated for immediate occupancy. Thus the Alcotts settled briefly into a house on Bedford Street to wait for the needed repairs to be done. Lizzie did not survive the wait. In early March 1858, she set aside her sewing needle, saying it was \x{201c}too heavy\x{201d} for her.45 On the fourteenth, at <<three in the morning|9a>>, Lizzie Alcott passed away. She was not yet twenty-three.",

            "Alcott\x{2019}s zeal for literary success did not prevent her from enjoying an active life around Concord, one that sowed more and more ideas in her mind for the writing of Little Women. By <<1858|9n:0>>, Alcott and her sister Anna had graduated from performing the melodramatic plays that they themselves had written, but they remained quite active in local theater. In a production of Dickens\x{2019}s The Haunted Man, Louisa played Sophy, the wife of \x{2019}Dolphus Tetterby, who was portrayed by a sixteen-year-old boy named Alf Whitman. Whitman, who had lost his mother some time earlier, impressed Louisa as \x{201c}proud and cold and shy to other people, sad and serious when his good heart and tender conscience showed him his short-comings, but so grateful for sympathy and a kind word.\x{201d}55 Rehearsal by rehearsal, Alcott melted Whitman\x{2019}s reserve. Though he lived in Concord less than a year, the two became fast friends, and Alcott continued to write to him until 1869. Early in that year, she confided to him that he had supplied \x{201c}the sober half\x{201d} of Laurie in Little Women and that she had put him \x{201c}into my story as one of the best & dearest lads I ever knew.\x{201d}56",

            "The gradual diminution of Alcott\x{2019}s family circle was reflected in her fictions concerning the March family. Little Men tells of the death of John Bridge Pratt\x{2019}s alter ego John Brooke. Jo\x{2019}s Boys begins by announcing the death of the fictional Marmee. Yet there was one loss too painful for Alcott to reproduce in that novel. Alcott\x{2019}s younger sister May, <<after two|9:0>> earlier visits to Europe, left America in 1876 for a longer sojourn to advance her studies in painting. She was never to return. In March 1878, she married a young Swiss businessman named Ernest Nieriker. In November the following year, she gave birth to a girl, whom she named Louisa May. The family\x{2019}s joy did not last. Weakened by an infection she contracted during childbirth, May Alcott died on December 29, 1879. The baby, who acquired the nickname Lulu, was sent to America, and Alcott became her guardian. In the fall of 1882, Bronson Alcott suffered a debilitating stroke, and Alcott\x{2019}s familial duties increased once more. Ideas for books still came in abundance, but writing was harder now. Years of using uncomfortable steel pens had crippled her right hand; she taught herself to write with her left. Even so, chronic illness and a constant cycle of daily cares slowed her production to a painful crawl. In spite of it all, she set herself about one task that she was determined to see through to the end: she would finish her Little Women trilogy.",
