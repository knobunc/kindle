It was nearing <<midnight|13>> before Mina climbed above decks in anticipation of her first glimpse of the Market, prudently leaving her short uniform coat behind in favor of a less conspicuous black waistcoat that buckled tightly over her shirtsleeves and armor. Trahaearn had already joined Yasmeen at the quarterdeck, and she knew they were discussing whether to wait until morning before attempting to find Colbert. That decision was made for them, however, when the notorious settlement finally came into view as an unmistakable orange glow against the dark sky.",

On the airship, they\x{2019}d been able to spend a full day in bed. Here, stealing more than a few minutes during the day was all but impossible. Though the crew changed shifts several times, Rhys stood over them from before dawn until <<well after midnight|13>>. He broke to eat dinner with Mina and Scarsdale, but even then he worked, describing the upcoming stretches of water to the navigator, relaying what the crew needed to accomplish during their shifts, and poring over maps and ledgers.",

            "And <<long after midnight|13>>, she did, pushing him onto his back and climbing over him\x{2014}but there was no rest. With her lips, she explored, and wrecked him with the heat of her mouth and the stroke of her tongue. She kissed him into desperate need, until they were both rigid and panting. And when her fingers smoothed the sheath over his cock, when her thighs parted over him, when she took him deep into her wet passage, the tightness and the friction held him in a mad grip. Insensate with pleasure, but not resting, no\x{2014}she moved upon him, and he met her with heavy upward thrusts, seeking oblivion within her hot depths. But there was only exquisite awareness, of her every sigh and gasp as she rode him. Of the warmth and softness of her hands and mouth. Of Mina taking him all, kissing, biting, and losing control as he finally came deep inside her. Stiffening, she breathed his name on a shudder, then again on a hoarse cry.",

The giddy relief lasted through endless questions as Bellerophon \x{2019}s rear admiral and the van squadron\x{2019}s vice admiral boarded the ship. Vitruvian was lost, and although much of her crew had been rescued, Mina wasn\x{2019}t surprised to learn that Burnett had gone down with the ship. But even with a king\x{2019}s decree in hand, an admiral\x{2019}s death couldn\x{2019}t be pardoned without rigorous examination. When the admirals opted to continue their questioning on Bellerophon, Rhys left with them on Seymour\x{2019}s airship. Mina spent the rest of the afternoon writing out a long report to Hale. At sunset, Yasmeen and Scarsdale joined her for dinner at the captain\x{2019}s table\x{2014}and as they\x{2019}d made an early start on their celebratory drinking, Mina was well entertained until <<midnight|13>> approached, and Rhys finally returned.",
