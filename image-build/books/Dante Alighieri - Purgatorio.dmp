We and Dante are introduced to the valley and its inhabitants (identified in the headnote to Canto VII) by Sordello (c. 1200\x{2013}1269), the most famous of the Italian troubadours, who wrote in Proven\x{e7}al and served as courtier in Italy, Provence, and then again\x{2014}under Charles of Anjou\x{2014}in Italy. It is Sordello\x{2019}s greeting of his fellow-Mantuan, Virgil, in Canto VI, 71\x{2013}75, that spurs Dante\x{2019}s polemical \x{201c}digression\x{201d} against Italy and Florence, well-placed in this canto of Sordello, a poet whose own achievements in political and didactic poetry were notable. Sordello\x{2019}s review of the presences in the valley (VII, 91\x{2013}136) is complemented in the next canto by the direct encounter with a political figure whom Dante knew well, the Guelph Nino Visconti\x{2014}grandson of the Ugolino of Canto XXXIII of the Inferno\x{2014}who died in 1296, after serving as animator of Guelph Genoa, Florence, and Lucca against Pisa. (Visconti\x{2019}s only daughter, Giovanna, died in poverty in Florence before <<1339|9c:0>>; in 1300, his widow married Galeazzo Visconti, lord of Milan, who then fell on hard times. The serpent was emblem of the Milanese Visconti, the rooster of the Pisan Visconti: VIII, 67\x{2013}81.)

Thus, Jerusalem\x{2019}s sunset coincides with sunrise in Purgatory.

His Earth clock thus has four principal stations: Jerusalem, the Ganges River, Purgatory, the Straits of Gibraltar. With Jerusalem at <<6 P.M.|5>>, it is <<midnight|13>> at the Ganges, <<6 A.M.|5>> in Purgatory, and <<noon|13>> over the Straits of Gibraltar.

For the Church, the four daytime hours listed above (tierce, <<sext|13>>, none, and <<vespers|13>>) would be supplemented by three additional predaylight or postdaylight hours: matins with <<lauds|13>> (see Purg. I, 115\x{2013}117, note); prime, the hour of sunrise; and <<compline|13>> (see Purg. VIII, 1\x{2013}6 and 13, note).
