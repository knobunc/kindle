Thus, Jerusalem\x{2019}s sunset coincides with sunrise in Purgatory.

His Earth clock thus has four principal stations: Jerusalem, the Ganges River, Purgatory, the Straits of Gibraltar. With Jerusalem at <<6 P.M.|5>>, it is <<midnight|13>> at the Ganges, <<6 A.M.|5>> in Purgatory, and <<noon|13>> over the Straits of Gibraltar.

Nor are the classifications of the powers of the soul, powers to which Dante refers, fully chartable. But his purport is clear: The \x{201c}error\x{201d} of line 6 is Plato\x{2019}s, whom Dante held to believe in a plurality of souls in man, a doctrine refuted by Aristotle in the De Anima III, 9. (Dante, in his Convivio III, ii, <<11\x{2013}16|5a:0>>, refers to Book II of the De Anima for the principal \x{201c}powers\x{201d} of the soul: life, sensation, intellection, though Dante includes the Aristotelian category of locomotion in that of sensation.) If the \x{201c}powers\x{201d} of the soul were not subordinate to one soul but were separate, autonomized, unsubordinated souls, each with its separate presence in the body of an individual human, then while one soul was bent on something, it would not absorb all of a man\x{2019}s attention: he would still be free to notice something else. But if the soul is one, then when one of its subordinate powers is fully engaged (as Dante\x{2019}s power of sensation-perception is by Manfred), all the other powers of the soul would be immobilized (and the intellective power of Dante\x{2019}s soul, whose judgment would note the passage of time, would be inoperative). In sum, the fact of undivided attention is proof that, despite its multiple powers, the soul is indivisible: when a part of us is engaged, we are fully engaged. [return to English / Italian]",

Philomela was raped by her brother-in-law Tereus, who cut out her tongue to prevent her telling what had happened. Philomela, however, managed to convey the story to her sister, Procne, by weaving it into a piece of cloth. The two took revenge on Tereus by serving up his son\x{2019}s flesh for Tereus to eat. After realizing what he had fed on, Tereus tried to murder the two, but as he pursued them, Philomela was changed into a nightingale, Procne into a swallow, and Tereus into a hoopoe. But here Dante seems to have Philomela as the swallow, and in XVII, <<19\x{2013}21|5a:0>>, Procne as the nightingale.

In Homer (Odyssey XII, 39\x{2013}54 and 158\x{2013}200) Ulysses is a potential victim of the sirens, who lured men from their sea-paths and sang them to enraptured death. But Ulysses is forewarned by Circe. Nearing the island of the sirens, he stuffs the ears of his men with beeswax and has himself (his ears are left open) firmly lashed to the mast. He also orders his crew to ignore any sign he gives asking to be released. With those elaborate precautions, Ulysses steers free of the sirens. Dante, however, did not know Homer\x{2019}s tale directly, and Dante\x{2019}s siren (one, not several) claims that she had \x{201c}turned aside\x{201d} (22) Ulysses. If Dante knew Cicero\x{2019}s De officiis (V, xviii), which includes a translation into Latin of the sirens\x{2019} song but omits any unambiguous word on the success or failure of their temptation of Ulysses, then Cicero\x{2019}s account could have led Dante astray. However, the ancient myth was widely and variously transmitted down to Dante\x{2019}s time, and on so long a journey, confusions may easily have arisen. Also, there is some cogency in Bosco-Reggio\x{2019}s observation that Dante\x{2019}s siren claims, not to have thwarted Ulysses\x{2019} journey, but to have turned him \x{201c}aside,\x{201d} to have diverted him to listening to her song\x{2014}and, even in Homer, Ulysses did listen.

Forese was the son of Simone Donati (see Inf. XXX, 32\x{2013}45, note), and brother of the fair Piccarda (see Purg. XXIV, <<10\x{2013}16|5a:0>>, note) and of Corso Donati (see XXIV, 82\x{2013}87, note); he was also a distant relative of Dante\x{2019}s wife, Gemma Donati. Among his other talents, Forese seems to have been an accomplished amateur poet, judging from the spiritedness of three vituperative sonnets he wrote in reply to three Dante addressed to him. (For the importance of Forese\x{2019}s poetic exchange with Dante, see Intro, For a look at these vilifying sonnets, see Kenelm Foster and Patrick Boyde, Dante\x{2019}s Lyric Poetry, Oxford, 1976, vol. I). The ongoing poetic tenzome, \x{201c}quarrel,\x{201d} in epistolary poems, sometimes containing scurrilous insults, was a traditional late medieval genre. In spite of their stylization, such poetic exchanges, when vulgarly realistic (as in the case of Dante and Forese), would be more consonant with the quarrelsome divisiveness of the Infernal Malebolge (see Virgil\x{2019}s reproof to Dante for listening to the reciprocal vilification of Master Adam and Sinon, in Inf. XXX, 148: \x{201c}to want to hear such bickering is base\x{201d}) than with the affectionate fellowship of Purgatory. [return to English / Italian]",

Many years and many adventures later, Meleager killed two of his maternal uncles for contesting his right to dispose as he chose to of the spoils of the Calydonian Boar.

The tree, which, like the legendary trees of the forests of India, grows to an amazing height, has the same form as the inaccessible trees we saw on the terrace of the gluttonous (XXII, 131\x{2013}135, and XXIV, 103\x{2013}117). In fact it provided the seeds from which those trees sprang (see XXIV, 115\x{2013}119 and note). In the next canto (XXXIII, 70\x{2013}72) Dante will point out that on the level of moral interpretation the tree signifies divine justice. Those commentators, many of them modern, who read the tree as an allegorical figure of the Empire, have to explain away the fact that, in the \x{201c}dumb show\x{201d} (Singleton) that is to follow, the Empire is represented by \x{201c}the bird of Jove\x{201d} (112), the imperial eagle.

Her words may, as some suggest, refer to the 14th-century transferral of the seat of the papacy from Rome to Avignon (the so-called Babylonian Captivity, still in the future in 1300, but begun before Purgatorio was composed) and its eventual return to Rome (see XXXII, 157\x{2013}160, note). In John\x{2019}s Gospel, too, Christ\x{2019}s words are not immediately understood by his disciples, because, as He Himself admits, they are spoken in figurative language, in what He calls \x{201c}proverbs\x{201d} (though the precise meaning of this term is debated). This mode of biblical discourse will be imitated at length in Beatrice\x{2019}s hermetic oracular pronouncements in lines 31\x{2013}78 of this canto. [return to English / Italian]",
