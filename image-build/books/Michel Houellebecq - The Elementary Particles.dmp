It had all ended there, however, presumably the result of climatic changes that made reproduction increasingly difficult to sustain, until eventually it ceased entirely. The story of life on Mars was a modest one. However (and Bruno Masure did not seem to understand this), this brief, feeble misfire brutally refuted all the mythological and religious constructs in which the human race delights. There had been no unique, wondrous act of creation; no chosen people; no chosen species or planet; simply a series of tentative attempts, flawed for the most part, scattered across the universe. It was all so distressingly banal. The DNA of the Martian bacteria seemed identical to that of terrestrial bacteria. More than anything this saddened him, in itself a sign of depression. In normal circumstances a scientist, any scientist in good form, would be excited by the similarities, and see in them the promise of a unifying synthesis.

As he wandered through the aisles he thought about Aristotle\x{2019}s claim that small women were of a different species. A small man still seems to me to be a man, he wrote, whereas a small woman appears to me to belong to a new type of animal. How could you square such a strange assertion with the habitual good sense of the Stagirite? Bruno bought a bottle of whiskey, a box of ravioli and a pack of ginger snaps. By the time he got back, the Lieu was dark. Passing the Jacuzzi, he heard whispering and a muffled laugh. He stopped and peeked through the branches, plastic bag in hand. There were two or three couples; they were quiet now, the only sound the rippling of the water. The moon came out from behind the clouds. At that moment another couple arrived and began to undress. The whispering began again. Bruno put the bag down, took out his penis and started to masturbate. He ejaculated quickly, just as the woman slipped into the warm water.",

He was the archetypal old hippie: long gray beard, Indian vest and an ankh on a chain around his neck. At fifty-five this old wreck lived a peaceful life. He would get up at dawn to go bird-watching in the hills, then sit down to a bowl of coffee and Calvados, and roll a cigarette amid the human bustle.

At <<about eleven o\x{2019}clock that evening|6>> he went down to the Jacuzzi. A delicate haze rose above the gentle rumble of the water, lit by the full moon. He approached soundlessly. A couple were entwined on the far side of the pool; it looked as if she had mounted him like a horse. I have as much right as they have, thought Bruno furiously. He undressed quickly and slipped into the Jacuzzi. The night air was cool, the water, by contrast, deliciously warm. Between the twisted branches of the pine trees he could see the stars, and felt himself relax a little. The couple paid no attention to him; the girl continued to pump up and down on the guy, now starting to whimper. It was impossible to see her face. The man began to breathe heavily too. The woman\x{2019}s rhythm began to pick up tempo; she threw her head back and, for a moment, the moon lit up her breasts, her face still hidden behind a dark mass of hair. Then she crushed herself against her partner and wrapped herself around him; his breathing was heavier now, then he let out a long moan and was silent.",

            "Just before he started university in October 1975, Bruno moved into the studio his father had bought for him. He felt a whole new life was beginning for him. He was quickly disappointed. There were girls, of course, in fact rather a lot of girls enrolled in liberal arts at Censier, but they all seemed to be taken; or if they weren\x{2019}t, they weren\x{2019}t prepared to be taken by him. In an attempt to make friends he went to every lecture, every tutorial, and quickly became a good student. He watched the girls in the cafeteria, listened to them chatting about going out, meeting friends, inviting each other to parties. He started to eat. His diet quickly settled into a nutritious trip down the boulevard Saint-Michel. He would start with a hot dog from the stand on the corner of the rue Gay-Lussac; farther down, he would have a slice of pizza or a kebab. At McDonald\x{2019}s on the boulevard Saint-Germain, he\x{2019}d devour several cheeseburgers washed down with coke and a banana milk shake before staggering down the rue de la Harpe to finish off with some Tunisian pastries. On his way home he would stop in front of the Cin\x{e9}ma Latin, which showed porn double features. Sometimes he would stand for half an hour pretending to look at the bus timetable in the always vain hope of seeing a woman or a couple go inside. More often than not, he would end up buying a ticket. He always felt better once he was inside; the usherette was the soul of discretion. The men sat far apart, always leaving several seats between them. He would quietly jerk off watching Naughty Nurses, The Hitchhiker Always Comes Twice, Teacher Spreads Her Legs, The Wild Bunch, whatever was on. He had to be careful as he left: the cinema was right on the boulevard Saint-Michel, and he could easily bump into a girl from college. Usually he waited for someone else to leave and walked just behind him; it seemed less humiliating that he might have gone to a porn movie with a friend. He usually got back <<around midnight|13>> and read for a while: Chateaubriand or Rousseau. He decided to change his life once or twice a week, to take some radical new direction. This is how it went: first he would take off his clothes and look at himself in the mirror. He had to go to the limit of self-abasement, to face up to the humiliating sight of his fat belly, his flabby cheeks and his sagging buttocks. Then he would turn out the lights and, feet together, arms folded across his chest, he would drop his head forward, the better to go into himself. Then he would breathe slowly, deeply, expanding his revolting belly as far as he could before exhaling slowly, mentally saying a number as he did so. It was essential not to let his concentration waver; every number was important, but the most significant were four, eight and, of course, sixteen, the last one. He would exhale with all his might as he reached the final number; when he raised his head he would be a radically new man, finally ready to live, to swim with the tide of existence. He would no longer feel guilty or ashamed; he would eat normally and behave normally around girls. \x{201c}Today is the first day of the rest of your life.\x{201d}",

His uncle was practically deaf; a kindhearted man, he had voted Communist all his life and refused to go to <<midnight|13>> mass, which always started an argument. Michel listened as the old man talked about emancipating the workingman and sipped gentian tea; from time to time, he would yell something banal in response. Then the others arrived. Michel was fond of his cousin Brigitte; he wanted her to be happy, but the fact that her husband was a bastard made that rather unlikely. He was a sales rep with Bayer and cheated on his wife whenever he had the opportunity; as he was a handsome man and traveled a lot, he had quite a lot of opportunities.

Everything that\x{2019}s happened since simply brings Western society closer to the social model he described. Control of reproduction is more precise and eventually will be completely disassociated from sex altogether, and procreation will take place in tightly guarded laboratories where perfect genetic conditions are ensured. Once that happens, any sense of family, of father-son bonds, will disappear. Pharmaceutical companies will break down the distinction between youth and age. In Huxley\x{2019}s world, a sixty-year-old man is as healthy as a man of twenty, looks as young and has the same desires. When we get to the point that life can\x{2019}t be prolonged any further, we\x{2019}ll be killed off by voluntary euthanasia; quick, discreet, emotionless. The society Huxley describes in Brave New World is happy; tragedy and extremes of human emotion have disappeared. Sexual liberation is total\x{2014}nothing stands in the way of instant gratification. Oh, there are little moments of depression, of sadness or doubt, but they\x{2019}re easily dealt with using advances in antidepressants and tranquilizers. \x{2018}One cubic centimeter cures ten gloomy sentiments.\x{2019} This is exactly the sort of world we\x{2019}re trying to create, the world we want to live in.",

When she crossed her legs under her desk I thought I\x{2019}d pass out. She was sitting beside a fat blonde who ran off as soon as the bell rang. I went over and put a hand on her books. She just sat there, and didn\x{2019}t seem to be in any hurry. All the other kids left and the classroom was quiet again. Holding her exercise book in my hand, I could make out a word or two: Remember .\x{a0}.\x{a0}. hell .\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I sat next to her and put the book down on the desk, but I couldn\x{2019}t manage to say anything to her. We sat there in silence for more than a minute. I stared into her big black eyes, but I was aware of every little movement of her body, the rise and fall of her breasts. She had turned halfway toward me and then she parted her legs. I don\x{2019}t remember doing what I did next\x{2014}I think it was half-involuntary\x{2014}but the next thing I knew I felt her thigh against the palm of my left hand, then it\x{2019}s all a blur. I remembered Caroline Yessayan and froze with shame. I had made the same mistake\x{2014}twenty years later, I had made the same mistake. Just like Caroline Yessayan twenty years earlier, she did nothing for a second; she blushed a little. Then, very gently, she moved my hand away, but she didn\x{2019}t get up, didn\x{2019}t make any move to leave. Through the bars on the windows I could see a girl in the playground racing off to the station. With my right hand I opened my fly. Her eyes widened and she looked at my penis. Her eyes on me felt like hot vibrations\x{2014}I nearly came just from her watching me, but I knew that she had to actually do something if this were to be mutual. I moved my right hand toward hers but couldn\x{2019}t go through with it; imploringly, I took my cock in my hand as if to offer it to her. She burst out laughing; I think I laughed, too, as I started to masturbate. I went on laughing and jerking off as she got her things together, as she got up to leave. When she got to the door, she turned around and looked at me one last time; I ejaculated, then everything went black. I heard the door close and her footsteps dying away. I was stunned, as though I\x{2019}d been struck like a gong. Still, I managed to phone Azoulay from the station. I don\x{2019}t remember the train back to Paris, or the metro; Azoulay saw me at <<eight|9c:1>>. I couldn\x{2019}t stop shaking, and he had to give me an injection to calm me down.",

He walked back quickly, almost breaking into a run, and bounded up the stairs to the door of his neighbor\x{2019}s apartment. He rang the doorbell three times. No one answered. Flustered, he retreated to his own building; as he waited for the elevator, he questioned himself. Was he depressed, and did such a question have any meaning? For years he had seen posters appear in the area, asking people to be vigilant and warning them about the National Front. The fact that he had no opinion on such a subject one way or the other was already a worrying sign. Depressive lucidity, usually described as a radical withdrawal from ordinary human concerns, generally manifests itself by a profound indifference to things which are genuinely of minor interest.

            "Bruno drove back along the expressway, arriving at the p\x{e9}riph\x{e9}rique at <<about eleven|9c:1>>. He had taken the day off; it hadn\x{2019}t occurred to him that the ceremony would be so brief. He took the Porte de Ch\x{e2}tillon exit and found a place to park on the rue Albert-Sorel just opposite his ex-wife\x{2019}s apartment. He did not have to wait long. Ten minutes later, his son turned the corner of the avenue Ernest-Reyer, his satchel on his back. He seemed worried, and was talking to himself as he walked. What could he be thinking about? Anne had told him that Victor was a solitary boy; he would come home at lunchtime and heat up something she\x{2019}d left out for him rather than eat with his classmates at school. Had he missed Bruno? Probably, though he had never said anything. Children suffer the world that adults create for them and try their best to adapt to it; in time, usually, they will replicate it. Victor reached the door, keyed in the security code; he was only a couple of meters from the car, but he hadn\x{2019}t noticed his father. Bruno sat up in his seat and put his hand on the handle. The door to the building closed behind the boy; Bruno remained motionless for a few seconds, then sat back heavily in his seat. What could he possibly say to his son, what message did he have to give? Nothing. There was nothing. He knew his life was over, but he didn\x{2019}t understand the ending. Everything was dark, indistinct and painful.",

            "\x{201c}Oh, here\x{2019}s Twat!\x{201d} said Bruno sharply, his tone completely changed as he nodded to a young man who had just come into the caf\x{e9}. <<About twenty-two|9:0>>, dressed in fatigues and a Greenpeace T-shirt, he had a dark complexion and wore his black hair in dreadlocks. In short, he was doing the Rasta thing. \x{201c}Hi, Twat,\x{201d} Bruno said cheerfully. \x{201c}This is my brother. On your way to see the old bitch?\x{201d} The boy nodded without saying anything; for some reason or other he had decided not to let Bruno get to him.",

            'Michel looked at his watch and glanced around. His mother was quiet. It was <<almost noon|13>>; everything seemed too calm. He got up and went back into the other room. Gray-Hippie had disappeared, leaving his carrots on the table. Michel poured himself a beer and walked over to the window. He could see for kilometers across pine-covered hills. Between the snow-capped peaks it was just possible to see the shimmering blue of a lake. The air was warm and full of fragrance; it was a beautiful spring morning.',

            "At <<about three a.m.|9h>> she got up, put on a dressing gown and went down to the kitchen. She rummaged in the dresser and found the bowl, inscribed with her name, that her godmother had given her for her tenth birthday. She emptied the contents of a tube of Rohypnol into the bowl, then added a little sugar and water. She didn\x{2019}t feel anything, unless perhaps a very general, almost metaphysical sadness. That was life, she thought; her body had taken a turn which was unfair and unexpected, and now could no longer be a source of joy or pleasure. On the contrary, it would gradually but quite quickly become another source of pain and embarrassment to her and others. And so she would have to destroy her body. A big wooden clock loudly counted off the seconds; her mother had been given it by her mother, and she\x{2019}d had it since before she got married. It was the oldest piece of furniture in the house. Annabelle added some more sugar to the bowl. She was far from accepting; life seemed to her like a bad joke, an unacceptable joke, but acceptable or not, that was what it was. In a few short weeks her illness had brought her to the feeling so common in the elderly: she did not want to be a burden to others. Toward the end of her adolescence, her life had speeded up, then there had been a long dull period. Now, at the end, everything was speeding up again.",

            "<<Toward noon|13>>, Michel pushed open the door to her room. Her breathing was very shallow, the sheet covering her chest almost still\x{2014}though, according to the doctor, it was sufficient for oxygenation. If her respiratory rate dropped further, they intended to put her on a respirator. For the time being, a drip was hooked up to her arm just above the elbow and an electrode fixed to her temple, that was all. A ray of sunlight crossed the immaculate sheet and lit a lock of her magnificent blonde hair. A little paler than usual, her face, eyes closed, seemed completely at peace. All fear seemed to have disappeared; to Michel, she had never looked so happy. It is true that he\x{2019}d always had a tendency to confuse happiness with coma; nonetheless she seemed to him completely happy. He stroked her hair, kissed her forehead and her warm lips. It was too late, of course, but it was nice. He stayed in the room with her until nightfall. Back in the corridor, he opened a book of Buddhist meditations compiled by Dr. Evans-Wentz (the book had been in his pocket for some weeks; a small book with a dark red cover).",

            'He had no intention of returning to France, but in the first weeks he had to go to Paris a number of times to arrange the sale of his apartment and the transfer of his bank accounts. He would take the <<11:50 a.m.|2a>> from Shannon. The plane flew over the sea, the sun blistering white on the water, the waves snaking and twisting like worms far below. Beneath this writhing mass, he knew, mollusks were breeding, and fish with sharp, fine teeth fed on the mollusks only to be devoured by bigger fish. Often, he slept; he had nightmares. When he woke, the plane was flying over the countryside. Half-awake, he would stare in astonishment at the uniform color of the fields. The fields were brown, sometimes green, but the tones always muted. The suburbs of Paris were gray. The plane fell slowly, gently nosing its way down, irresistibly drawn to this life, to the beating of millions of lives.',
