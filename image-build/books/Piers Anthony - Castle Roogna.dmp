The local sticks and stones were as helpful as usual, and they located Castle Roogna without difficulty <<about noon|13>>. Dor was able to recognize the general lay of the land, but the vegetation was all different. There was no orchard; instead there were a number of predaceous plants. And\x{2014}the Castle was only half complete.",

            'They returned to their stations. Almost immediately the trouble arrived. From the south the dusky banners of the great goblin army came, marching in a gathering tread that shook the Castle foundations. Dor stood atop the northeast corner tower and looked over the ramparts to spy it in the distance. Drums beat, horns tooted, keeping the cadence. Like a monstrous black carpet the army spread across the field beyond the Castle. Light sparkled from the points of the goblins\' small weapons, and a low half-melody carried under the clamor, like muted thunder: the goblins were chanting, "<<One two|5l:0>> <<three four|5l:0>>, Kill <<two three|5l:0>> four, <<One two|5l:0>> <<three four|5l:0>>, Kill <<two three|5l:0>> four," on and on endlessly. There was not much imagination to it, but plenty of feeling, and the effect expanded cumulatively, hammering into the mind.',
