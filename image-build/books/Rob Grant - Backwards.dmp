It had taken them just over five hours to hike down from the spot where they had concealed the rebuilt Starbug. It would take even longer to get back, travelling uphill. They had until <<midnight|13>> to effect their take-off. After that, the conjunction of the planets would render their journey out of this solar system impossible for some considerable time.
