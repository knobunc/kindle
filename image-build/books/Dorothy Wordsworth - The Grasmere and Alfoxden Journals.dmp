            "DOROTHY WORDSWORTH was born on Christmas Day 1771 at Cockermouth on the edge of the Lake District, the third of five children. Her father was law-agent to Sir James Lowther. When she was 6 her mother died and a cousin of her mother brought her up in Halifax, Yorkshire. Here she had a kindly non-conformist home until, at <<15|9e:1>>, she went to her grandparents in Penrith. Her father had died when she was 12. In Penrith she met her brothers again, and also met the Hutchinson orphans. From 17 to 22, she lived with Uncle William Cookson\x{2019}s family at Forncett Rectory, Norfolk, leaving in 1794 to give support to her out-of-favour brother, the poet William Wordsworth (b. 1770). With him she met Raisley Calvert in Keswick and was included in Calvert\x{2019}s bequest to her brother. Her life thereafter was with Wordsworth, first at Racedown, Dorset, 1795\x{2013}7, then, having met Coleridge, at Alfoxden, Somerset, 1797\x{2013}8. She wrote her brief Alfoxden Journal, and was integral to the talking and observing that led to Lyrical Ballads, 1798. A winter in Germany with Wordsworth followed, and from Christmas 1799, Grasmere, the Lake District, became home. Her Grasmere Journal 1800\x{2013}3 vividly depicts the valley, their daily life, and Dorothy\x{2019}s feelings on Wordsworth\x{2019}s marriage to Mary Hutchinson in 1802. No publication was ever envisaged. Pedestrian tours, excursions, travel\x{2014}and late sporadic private\x{2014}journals, long visits south, and the final move to nearby Rydal in 1813 punctuated the years of busy family life. Mental illness, possibly originating in thiamin deficiency, was almost constant from <<1835|9c:0>>. Dorothy received loving care, outlived Wordsworth, and died at Rydal Mount in 1855. Interest in both Journals and in Dorothy\x{2019}s distinctive imagination has grown steadily since the first edition of 1897.",

            "The experience Grasmere gave her was that of living with a favourite elder brother in her own home, her first real home since she was 6. On the death of her mother there began for Dorothy a long separation from her brothers. Certainly she was happy enough in Halifax, looked after by her mother\x{2019}s cousin, Elizabeth Threlkeld, and with her bosom friend Jane Pollard across the way; she was less happy in Penrith at her grandmother\x{2019}s house between the ages of 15 and almost 17, for her grandmother was often \x{2018}in a very bad humour\x{2019} and Dorothy would \x{2018}sit for whole hours without saying anything excepting that I have an old shirt to mend, then, my Grandmr and I have to set our heads together and contrive the most notable way of doing it\x{2019}; she was happier again at Forncett Rectory, Norfolk, where her mother\x{2019}s brother, her uncle William Cookson, took her, on his own marriage in October 1788, from the narrow life at Penrith to his new living near Norwich. Here Dorothy, at least until the several children came, lived a proper young lady\x{2019}s life\x{2014}prayers at nine (in winter), then reading, writing, and \x{2018}am to improve myself in French till <<twelve o\x{2019}clock|6>>, when we are to walk or visit our sick and poor neighbours till <<three|9f>>\x{2019}. Dorothy was with her uncle and his young family until the winter of 1793/4. After that she stayed in various places: in Halifax with Elizabeth Threlkeld, now Mrs Rawson; in Newcastle with other cousins of her mother, the Miss Griffiths; at Sockburn with the Hutchinson family, friends from Penrith days; at Rampside, Furness, for a few weeks probably, with cousins on her father\x{2019}s side; at Armathwaite to visit the Spedding family; at Newbiggin to stay with her other maternal uncle, Christopher; but best of all at Windy Brow, Keswick, a house belonging to William Calvert, to live for a few weeks in spring 1794 with her brother William. This was managed again, at Racedown, Dorset, in a house lent to Wordsworth by the Pinney brothers from late September 1795. From here, in July 1797, Dorothy and Wordsworth went to Alfoxden to be nearer Coleridge. From there all three went to Germany, Wordsworth and Dorothy living in lodgings in Goslar, and Coleridge for the most part in the University city of G\x{f6}ttingen. On their return, from May 1799, Dorothy stayed with the Hutchinsons at Sockburn until, on 20 December, when she was almost 29, she and Wordsworth moved into the \x{2018}small house at Grasmere empty\x{2019} and to rent.",

I have chosen a bank where I have room to spare for a resting-place for each of you. I hear you point out a spot where, if we could erect a little cottage and call it our own we should be the happiest of human beings. I see my Brother fired with the idea of leading his sister to such a retreat as Fancy ever ready at our call hastens to assist us in painting; our parlour is in a moment furnished; our garden is adorned by magic; the roses and honeysuckles spring at our command, the wood behind the house lifts at once its head and furnishes us with a winter\x{2019}s shelter and a summer\x{2019}s <<noonday|13>> shade.",

            "Dorothy\x{2019}s care was for William. One evening, having left him on the fell by Mr Olliff\x{2019}s, Dorothy came home and wrote out poems: \x{2018}grew alarmed & went to seek him.\x{2019} The alarm was not for herself. Her concern was totally for him: at the stress, illness almost, that composing and altering poems gave him, at his neglect of meals in order to write, above all at his sleeplessness\x{2014} \x{2018}William has not slept all night. It wants only <<10 minutes of 10|10>> & he is in bed yet.\x{2019} Again, with forethought she threw a cloak out of the window one mild and sweet night so that he might sit \x{2018}a few minutes in the orchard\x{2019}. When he \x{2018}came in sleepy & hurried to bed\x{2019} Dorothy carried his bread and butter to him there. This kind of care is a mother\x{2019}s care; the early loss of their own mother must be an element here. Dorothy unstintingly looked after her brother. And certainly Wordsworth understood such feeling. In 1804, with his own first child still under 1, but having been with Dorothy when little Basil Montagu from the ages of 2 to 5 was with her in the West Country in 1795\x{2014}8 and having himself experienced her care for him, Wordsworth was able to catch so surely, in a very different context, the pull of loving protective feeling:",

I have employed myself in writing this journal & reading newspapers till now (\x{bd} <<past 1 o\x{2019}clock|6>>) we are going to walk, & I am ready & waiting by the kitchen fire for Wm. We set forward, intending to go into Easedale but the wind being rather loudish, & blowing down Easedale we turned under Silver How for a sheltered walk. We went a little beyond the Wyke\x{2014}Then up to John\x{2019}s Grove, where the storm of Thursday has made sad ravages, two of the finest trees are uprooted one lying with the turf about its root as if the whole together had been pared by a knife. The other is a larch, several others are blown aside, one is snapped in two. We gathered together a faggot. William had tired himself with working\x{2014}he resolved to do better. We received a letter from Mary by Fletcher with an account of C\x{2019}s arrival in London\x{2014}I wrote to Mary before bed-time. We sate nicely together & talked by the fire till we were both tired, for Wm wrote out part of his poem & endeavoured to alter it, & so made himself ill. I copied out the rest for him. We went late to bed. Wm wrote to Annette.",

            "Monday Morning 8th February 1802. It was very windy & rained very hard all the morning. William worked at his poem & I read a little in Lessing & the Grammar. A chaise came past to fetch Ellis the Carrier who had hurt his head. After dinner (i.e we set off at about \x{bd} past 4) we went towards Rydale for letters it was a cold \x{2018}Cauld Clash\x{2019} \x{2014}the Rain had been so cold that it hardly melted the snow. We stopped at Park\x{2019}s to get some straw in William\x{2019}s shoes. The young mother was sitting by a bright wood fire with her youngest child upon her lap & the other two sate on each side of the chimney. The light of the fire made them a beautiful sight, with their innocent countenances, their rosy cheeks & glossy curling hair. We sate & talked about poor Ellis, & our journey over the Hawes. It had been reported that we came over in the night. Willy told us of 3 men who were once lost in crossing that way in the night, they had carried a lantern with them\x{2014} the lantern went out at the Tarn & they all perished. Willy had seen their cloaks drying at the public house in Patterdale the day before their funeral. We walked on very wet through the clashy cold roads in bad spirits at the idea of having to go as far as Rydale, but before we had come again to the shore of the Lake, we met our patient, bow-bent Friend with his little wooden box at his Back. \x{2018}Where are you going?\x{2019} said he, \x{2018}To Rydale for letters\x{2019}\x{2014}\x{2019}I have two for you in my Box.\x{2019} We lifted up the Lid & there they lay\x{2014}Poor Fellow, he straddled & pushed on with all his might but we soon out-stripped him far away when we had turned back with our letters. We were very thankful that we had not to go on, for we should have been sadly tired. In thinking of this I could not help comparing lots with him! he goes at that slow pace every morning, & after having wrought a hard days work returns at night, however weary he may be, takes it all quietly, & though perhaps he neither feels thankfulness, nor pleasure when he eats his supper, & has no luxury to look forward to but falling asleep in bed, yet I daresay he neither murmurs nor thinks it hard. He seems mechanized to labour. We broke the seal of Coleridge\x{2019}s letter, & I had light enough just to see that he was not ill. I put it in my pocket but at the top of the White Moss I took it to my bosom, a safer place for it. The night was wild. There was a strange Mountain lightness when we were at the top of the White Moss. I have often observed it there in the evenings, being between the two valleys. There is more of the sky there than any other place. It has a strange effect sometimes along with the obscurity of evening or night. It seems almost like a peculiar sort of light. There was not much wind till we came to John\x{2019}s Grove, then it roared right out of the grove, all the trees were tossing about. C\x{2019}s letter somewhat damped us, it spoke with less confidence about France. William wrote to him. The other letter was from Montagu with 8\x{a3}. William was very unwell, tired when he had written, he went to bed, & left me to write to MH, Montagu & Calvert, & Mrs Coleridge. I had written in his letter to Coleridge. We wrote to Calvert to beg him not to fetch us on Sunday. Wm left me with a little peat fire\x{2014}it grew less\x{2014}I wrote on & was starved. At <<2|9m:1>> o clock I went to put my letters under Fletcher\x{2019}s door. I never felt such a cold night. There was a strong wind & it froze very hard. I collected together all the clothes I could find (for I durst not go into the pantry for fear of waking William). At first when I went to bed I seemed to be warm, I suppose because the cold air which I had just left no longer touched my body, but I soon found that I was mistaken. I could not sleep from sheer cold. I had baked pies & bread in the morning. Coleridge\x{2019}s letter contained prescriptions.",

William still poorly\x{2014}we made up a good fire after dinner, & William brought his Mattrass out, & lay down on the floor I read to him the life of Ben Johnson & some short Poems of his which were too interesting for him, & would not let him go to sleep. I had begun with Fletcher, but he was too dull for me. Fuller says in his life of Jonson, (speaking of his plays) \x{2018}If his latter be not so spriteful & vigorous as his first pieces all that are old, & all who desire to be old, should excuse him therein\x{2019}. He says he had \x{2018}beheld\x{2019} wit combats between Shakespeare & Jonson, & compares Shakespeare to an English man of war, Jonson to a Spanish great Galleon. There is one affecting line in Jonson\x{2019}s Epitaph on his first Daughter",

            "Saturday 19th. The Swallows were very busy under my window this morning\x{2014}I slept pretty well, but William has got no sleep. It is <<after 11|9:1>> & he is still in bed\x{2014}a fine morning\x{2014} Coleridge when he was last here, told us that for many years there being no quaker meeting held at Keswick, a single old quaker woman used to go regularly alone every Sunday, to attend the meeting-house & there used to sit & perform her worship, alone, in that beautiful place among those fir-trees, in that spacious vale, under the great mountain Skiddaw!!! Poor old Willy\x{2014}we never pass by his grave close to the churchyard gate without thinking of him & having his figure brought back to our minds. He formerly was an ostler at Hawkshead having spent a little estate. In his old age he was boarded or as they say let by the parish. A Boy of the house that hired him was riding one morning pretty briskly beside John Fisher\x{2019}s, \x{2018}Hallo! has aught particular happened\x{2019}, said John to the Boy \x{2018}Nay naught at aw nobbut auld Willy\x{2019}s dead.\x{2019} He was going to order the passing bell to be told.\x{2014}On Thursday morning Miss Hudson of Workington called. She said \x{2018}O! I love flowers! I sow flowers in the Parks several miles from home & my mother & I visit them & watch them how they grow.\x{2019} This may show that Botanists may be often deceived when they find rare flowers growing far from houses. This was a very ordinary young woman, such as in any town in the North of England one may find a score. I sate up a while after William\x{2014}he then called me down to him. (I was writing to Mary H.) I read Churchills Rosciad returned again to my writing & did not go to bed till he called to me. The shutters were closed, but I heard the Birds singing. There was our own Thrush shouting with an impatient shout\x{2014}so it sounded to me. The morning was still, the twittering of the little Birds was very gloomy. The owls had hooted a \x{bc} of an hour before. Now the cocks were crowing. It was near daylight. I put out my candle & went to bed. In a little time I thought I heard William snoring, so I composed myself to sleep\x{2014}Charles Lloyd called\x{2014}\x{2019}Smiling at my sweet Brother\x{2019}.",

I parted from my Beloved in the Green Lane above the Blacksmiths, then went to dinner at Mr Simpsons. We walked afterwards in the garden. Betty Towers & her son & daughter came to tea. The little Lad is 4 years old almost as little a thing as Hartley & as sharp too, they say, but I saw nothing of this, being a stranger, except in his bonny eyes, which had such a sweet brightness in them when any thing was said to him that made him ashamed & draw his chin into his neck, while he sent his eyes upwards to look at you. His Mother is a delicate woman. She said she thought that both she & her husband were so tender in their health that they must be obliged to sell their Land.

As soon as the nest was broad enough, a sort of ledge for them they sate both mornings & evenings, but they did not pass the night there.

            "We spent Tuesday the 13th of July at Eusemere, & on Wednesday morning, the 13th [14th], we walked to Emont Bridge & mounted the Coach between Bird\x{2019}s Nest & Hartshorn tree. Mr Clarkson\x{2019}s Bitch followed us so far. A soldier & his young wife wanted to be taken up by the Coachman but there was no Room. We had a chearful ride though cold, till we got on to Stanemoor, & then a heavy shower came on, but we buttoned ourselves up, both together in the Guard\x{2019}s coat & we liked the hills & the Rain the better for bringing [us] so close to one another\x{2014}I never rode more snugly. At last, however, it grew so very rainy that I was obliged to go into the Coach at Bowes. Lough of Penrith was there, & very impertinent\x{2014}I was right glad to get out again to my own dear Brother at Greta Bridge, the sun shone chearfully & a glorious ride we had over Gaterly Moor. Every Building was bathed in golden light\x{2014}The trees were more bright than earthly trees, & we saw round us miles beyond miles\x{2014}Darlington Spire, &c &c\x{2014}We reached Leming Lane at about 9 o clock, supped comfortably & enjoyed our fire. On Thursday morning, at <<a little before 7|9c:1>>, being the 14th [15th] July we got into a post Chaise & went to Thirsk to Breakfast. We were well treated but when the Landlady understood that we were going to walk off & leave our luggage behind she threw out some saucy words in our hearing. The day was very hot & we rested often & long before we reached the foot of the Ham[b]leton Hills, & while we were climbing them still oftener. We had a Sandwich in our pockets which we finished when we had climbed part of the hill, & we were almost overpowered with thirst when I heard the trickling of a little stream of water. I was before William & I stopped till he came up to me\x{2014}We sate a long time by this water, & climbed the hill slowly\x{2014}I was foot-sore, the Sun shone hot, the little Scotch cattle panted & tossed fretfully about. The view was hazy and we could see nothing from the top of the hill but an indistinct wide-spreading country, full of trees, but the Buildings, towns & houses were lost. We stopped to examine their curious stone, then walked along the flat common, it was now cooler, but I was still foot-sore, & could not walk quick so I left Wm sitting 2 or three times, and when he followed me he took a Sheep for me, & then me for a Sheep. I rested opposite the sign of the Sportsman & was questioned by the Landlady. Arrived very hungry at Ryvaux. Nothing to eat at the Millers, as we expected but, at an exquisitely neat farmhouse we got some boiled milk & bread\x{2014}this strengthened us, & I went down to look at the Ruins\x{2014}thrushes were singing, Cattle feeding among green grown hillocks about the Ruins. These hillocks were scattered over with grovelets of wild roses & other shrubs, & covered with wild flowers\x{2014}I could have stayed in this solemn quiet spot till Evening without a thought of moving but William was waiting for me, so in a quarter of an hour I went away. We walked upon Mr Duncombe\x{2019}s terrace & looked down upon the abbey. It stands in a larger valley among a Brotherhood of valleys of different lengths & breadths all woody, & running up into the hills in all directions. We reached Helmsly just at Dusk\x{2014}we had a beautiful view of the Castle from the top of the hill. Slept at a very nice Inn & were well treated\x{2014}bright bellows, & floors as smooth as ice. On Friday morning the 16th July we walked to Kirby. Met people coming to Helmsly fair\x{2014}were misdirected & walked a mile out of our way\x{2014}met a double horse at Kirby.

            "On Thursday morning, 29th, we arrived in London. Wm left me at the Inn\x{2014}I went to bed &c &c &c\x{2014}After various troubles & disasters we left London on Saturday morning at \x{bd} past 5 or 6, the 31st of July (I have forgot which) we mounted the Dover Coach at Charing Cross. It was a beautiful morning. The City, St pauls, with the River & a multitude of little Boats, made a most beautiful sight as we crossed Westminster Bridge. The houses were not overhung by their cloud of smoke & they were spread out endlessly, yet the sun shone so brightly with such a pure light that there was even something like the purity of one of nature\x{2019}s own grand Spectacles. We rode on chearfully now with the Paris Diligence before us, now behind\x{2014}we walked up the steep hills, beautiful prospects everywhere, till we even reached Dover. At first the rich populous wide spreading woody country about London, then the River Thames, ships sailing, chalk cliffs, trees, little villages. Afterwards Canterbury, situated on a plain, rich & woody, but the City & Cathedral disappointed me. Hop grounds on each side of the road some miles from Canterbury, then we came to a common, the race ground, an elevated plain, villages among trees in the bed of a valley at our right, & rising above this valley, green hills scattered over with wood\x{2014}neat gentlemen\x{2019}s houses\x{2014}one white house almost hid with green trees which we longed for & the parsons house as neat a place as could be which would just have suited Coleridge. No doubt we might have found one for Tom Hutchinson & Sara & a good farm too. We halted at a halfway house\x{2014}fruit carts under the shade of trees, seats for guests, a tempting place to the weary traveller. Still as we went along the country was beautiful, hilly, with cottages lurking under the hills & their little plots of hop ground like vineyards. It was a bad hop-year\x{2014}a woman on the top of the coach said to me \x{2018}it is a sad thing for the poor people for the hop-gathering is the women\x{2019}s harvest, there is employment about the hops both for women & children\x{2019}. We saw the Castle of Dover & the sea beyond 4 or 5 miles before we reached D. We looked at it through a long vale, the castle being upon an eminence, as it seemed at the end of this vale which opened to the Sea. The country now became less fertile but near Dover it seemed more rich again. Many buildings stand on the flat fields, sheltered with tall trees. There is one old chapel that might have been there just in the same state in which it now is, when this vale was as retired and as little known to travellers, as our own Cumberland mountain wilds 30 years ago. There was also a very old Building on the other side of the road which had a strange effect among the many new ones that are springing up everywhere. It seemed odd that it could have kept itself pure in its ancientry among so many upstarts. It was near dark when we reached Dover. We were told that the packet was about to sail, so we went down to the Customhouse in half an hour, had our luggage examined &c &c & then we drank tea, with the honorable Mr Knox & his Tutor. We arrived at Calais at <<4 o\x{2019}clock|6>> on Sunday morning the 31st of July [1 Aug]. We stayed in the vessel till \x{bd} past 7. Then Wm went for Letters, at about \x{bd} past 8 or 9. We found out Annette & C chez Madame Avril dans la Rue de la T\x{ea}te d\x{2019}or. We lodged opposite two Ladies in tolerably decent-sized rooms but badly furnished, & with large store of bad smells & dirt in the yard, & all about. The weather was very hot. We walked by the sea-shore almost every Evening with Annette & Caroline or Wm & I alone. I had a bad cold & could not bathe at first but William did. It was a pretty sight to see as we walked upon the Sands when the tide was low, perhaps a hundred people bathing about \x{bc} of a mile distant from us, and we had delightful walks after the heat of the day was passed away\x{2014}seeing far off in the west the Coast of England like a cloud crested with Dover Castle, which was but like the summit of the cloud\x{2014}the Evening star & the glory of the sky. The Reflections in the water were more beautiful than the sky itself, purple waves brighter than precious stones for ever melting away upon the sands. The fort, a wooden Building, at the Entrance of the harbour at Calais, when the Evening twilight was coming on, & we could not see anything of the building but its shape which was far more distinct than in perfect daylight, seemed to be reared upon pillars of Ebony, between which pillars the sea was seen in the most beautiful colours that can be conceived. Nothing in Romance was ever half so beautiful. Now came in view as the Evening star sank down & the colours of the west faded away the two lights of England, lighted up by Englishmen in our Country, to warn vessels of rocks or sands. These we used to see from the Pier when we could see no other distant objects but the Clouds the Sky & the Sea itself. All was dark behind. The town of Calais seemed deserted of the light of heaven, but there was always light, & life, & joy upon the Sea.\x{2014}One night, though, I shall never forget, the day had been very hot, & William & I walked alone together upon the pier\x{2014}the sea was gloomy for there was a blackness over all the sky except when it was overspread with lightning which often revealed to us a distant vessel. Near us the waves roared & broke against the pier, & as they broke & as they travelled towards us, they were interfused with greenish fiery light. The more distant sea always black & gloomy. It was, also beautiful on the calm hot nights to see the little Boats row out of harbour with wings of fire & the sail boats with the fiery track which they cut as they went along & which closed up after them with a hundred thousand sparkles balls shootings, & streams of glowworm light. Caroline was delighted.",

            "On Sunday the 29th of August we left Calais at <<12 o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>> & landed at Dover at <<1|3b>> on Monday the 30th. I was sick all the way. It was very pleasant to me when we were in harbour at Dover to breathe the fresh air, & to look up and see the stars among the Ropes of the vessel. The next day was very hot. We both bathed & sate upon the Dover Cliffs & looked upon France with many a melancholy & tender thought. We could see the shores almost as plain as if it were but an English Lake.\x{2014}We mounted the coach at \x{bd} past 4 & arrived in London at <<6|3j>> the 30th August [31st]. It was misty & we could see nothing. We stayed in London till Wednesday the 22nd of September, & arrived at Gallow Hill on Friday 24th September. Mary first met us in the avenue. She looked so fat & well that we were made very happy by the sight of her\x{2014}then came Sara, & last of all Joanna. Tom was forking corn standing upon the corn cart. We dressed ourselves immediately & got tea\x{2014}the garden looked gay with asters & sweet peas\x{2014}I looked at everything with tranquillity & happiness but I was ill both on Saturday & Sunday & continued to be poorly most of the time of our stay. Jack & George came on Friday Evening 1st October. On Saturday 2nd we rode to Hackness, William Jack George & Sara single, I behind Tom. On Sunday 3rd Mary & Sara were busy packing. On Monday 4th October 1802, my Brother William was married to Mary Hutchinson. I slept a good deal of the night & rose fresh & well in the morning\x{2014}at a little after 8 o clock I saw them go down the avenue towards the Church. William had parted from me up stairs. I gave him the wedding ring\x{2014} with how deep a blessing! I took it from my forefinger where I had worn it the whole of the night before\x{2014}he slipped it again onto my finger and blessed me fervently. When they were absent my dear little Sara prepared the breakfast. I kept myself as quiet as I could, but when I saw the two men running up the walk, coming to tell us it was over, I could stand it no longer & threw myself on the bed where I lay in stillness, neither hearing or seeing any thing, till Sara came upstairs to me & said \x{2018}They are coming\x{2019}. This forced me from the bed where I lay & I moved I knew not how straight forward, faster than my strength could carry me till I met my beloved William & fell upon his bosom. He & John Hutchinson led me to the house & there I stayed to welcome my dear Mary. As soon as we had breakfasted we departed. It rained when we set off. Poor Mary was much agitated when she parted from her Brothers & Sisters & her home. Nothing particular occurred till we reached Kirby. We had sunshine & showers, pleasant talk, love & chearfulness. We were obliged to stay two hours at K. while the horses were feeding. We wrote a few lines to Sara & then walked out, the sun shone & we went to the Church-yard, after we had put a Letter into the Post office for the York Herald. We sauntered about & read the Grave-stones. There was one to the memory of 5 Children, who had all died within 5 years, & the longest lived had only lived 4 years. There was another Stone erected to the memory of an unfortunate woman (as we supposed, by a stranger). The verses engraved upon it expressed that she had been neglected by her Relations & counselled the Readers of those words to look within & recollect their own frailties. We left Kirby at about \x{bd} past 2. There is not much variety of prospect from K. to Helmsely but the country is very pleasant, being rich & woody, & Helmsely itself stands very sweetly at the foot of the rising grounds of Duncombe Park which is scattered over with tall woods & lifting itself above the common buildings of the Town stands Helmsely Castle, now a Ruin, formerly inhabited by the gay Duke of Buckingham. Every foot of the Road was, of itself interesting to us, for we had travelled along it on foot Wm & I when we went to fetch our dear Mary, & had sate upon the Turf by the roadside more than once. Before we reached Helmsely our Driver told us that he could not take us any further, so we stopped at the same Inn where we had slept before. My heart danced at the sight of its cleanly outside, bright yellow walls, casements overshadowed with jasmine & its low, double gavel-ended front. We were not shewn into the same parlour where Wm & I were, it was a small room with a drawing over the chimney piece which the woman told us had been bought at a sale. Mary & I warmed ourselves at the kitchen fire we then walked into the garden, & looked over a gate up to the old ruin which stands at the top of a mount, & round about it the moats are grown up into soft green cradles, hollows surrounded with green grassy hillocks & these are overshadowed by old trees, chiefly ashes. I prevailed upon William to go up with me to the ruins we left Mary sitting by the kitchen fire. The sun shone, it was warm & very pleasant. One part of the castle seems to be inhabited. There was a man mowing nettles in the open space which had most likely once been the Castle Court. There is one gateway exceedingly beautiful\x{2014}Children were playing upon the sloping ground. We came home by the Street. After about an hour\x{2019}s delay we set forward again, had an excellent Driver who opened the gates so dexterously that the horses never stopped. Mary was very much delighted with the view of the Castle from the point where we had seen it before. I was pleased to see again the little path which we had walked upon, the gate I had climbed over, & the Road down which we had seen the two little Boys drag a log of wood, & a team of horses struggle under the weight of a great load of timber. We had felt compassion for the poor horses that were under the governance of oppressive & ill-judging drivers, & for the poor Boys who seemed of an age to have been able to have dragged the log of wood merely out of the love of their own activity, but from poverty & bad food they panted for weakness & were obliged to fetch their father from the town to help them. Duncombe House looks well from the Road\x{2014}a large Building, though I believe only 2 thirds of the original design are completed. We rode down a very steep hill to Ryvaux valley, with woods all round us. We stopped upon the Bridge to look at the Abbey & again when we had crossed it. Dear Mary had never seen a ruined Abbey before except Whitby. We recognized the Cottages, houses, & the little valleys as we went along. We walked up a long hill, the Road carrying us up the cleft or valley with woody hills on each side of us. When we went to GH I had walked down this valley alone. Wm followed me. It was not dark evening when we passed the little publick house, but before we had crossed the Hambledon hills & reached the point overlooking Yorkshire it was quite dark. We had not wanted, however, fair prospects before us, as we drove along the flat plain of the high hill, far far off us, in the western sky, we saw shapes of Castles, Ruins among groves, a great, spreading wood, rocks, &single trees, a minster with its tower unusually distinct, minarets in another quarter, & a round Grecian Temple also\x{2014}the colours of the sky of a bright grey & the forms of a sober grey, with a dome. As we descended the hill there was no distinct view, but of a great space, only near us, we saw the wild & (as the people say) bottomless Tarn in the hollow at the side of the hill. It seemed to be made visible to us only by its own light, for all the hill about us was dark. Before we reached Thirsk we saw a light before us which we at first thought was the moon, then Lime kilns, but when we drove into the market place it proved a large Bonfire with Lads dancing round it, which is a sight I dearly love. The Inn was like an illuminated house\x{2014}every Room full. We asked the cause, & were told by the Girl that it was \x{2018}Mr John Bell\x{2019}s Birthday, that he had heired his Estate.\x{2019} The Landlady was very civil. She did not recognise the despised foot-travellers. We rode nicely in the dark, & reached Leming Lane at <<11 o\x{2019}clock|6>>. I am always sorry to get out of a Chaise when it is night. The people of the house were going to bed & we were not very well treated though we got a hot supper. We breakfasted the next morning & set off at about \x{bd} past 8 o clock. It was a chearful sunny morning. We soon turned out of Leming Lane & passed a nice village with a beautiful church. We had a few showers, but when we came to the green fields of Wensley, the sun shone upon them all, & the Eure in its many windings glittered as it flowed along under the green slopes of Middleham & Middleham Castle. Mary looked about for her friend Mr Place, & thought she had him sure on the contrary side of the vale from that on which we afterwards found that he lived. We went to a new built house at Leyburn, the same village where Wm & I had dined with George Hutchinson on our Road to Grasmere 2 years & \x{be} ago, but not the same house. The Landlady was very civil, giving us cake and wine but the horses being out we were detained at least 2 hours & did not set off till <<2 o\x{2019}clock|6>>. We paid for 35 miles, ie to Sedbergh, but the Landlady did not encourage us to hope to get beyond Hawes. A shower came on just after we left the Inn while the Rain beat against the Windows we ate our dinners which M & W heartily enjoyed\x{2014}I was not quite well. When we passed thro\x{2019} the village of Wensly my heart was melted away with dear recollections, the Bridge, the little waterspout the steep hill the Church\x{2014}They are among the most vivid of my own inner visions, for they were the first objects that I saw after we were left to ourselves, & had turned our whole hearts to Grasmere as a home in which we were to rest. The Vale looked most beautiful each way. To the left the bright silver Stream inlaid the flat & very green meadows, winding like a serpent. To the Right we did not see it so far, it was lost among trees & little hills. I could not help observing as we went along how much more varied the prospects of Wensly Dale are in the summer time than I could have thought possible in the winter. This seemed to be in great measure owing to the trees being in leaf, & forming groves, & screens, & thence little openings upon recesses & concealed retreats which in winter only made a part of the one great Vale. The beauty of the Summer time here as much excels that of the winter as the variety, owing to the excessive greenness of the fields, & the trees in leaf half concealing, & where they do not conceal, softening the hard bareness of the limey white Roofs. One of our horses seemed to grow a little restive as we went through the first village, a long village on the side of a hill. It grew worse & worse, & at last we durst not go on any longer. We walked a while, & then the Post-Boy was obliged to take the horse out & go back for another. We seated ourselves again snugly in the Post Chaise. The wind struggled about us & rattled the window & gave a gentle motion to the chaise, but we were warm & at our ease within. Our station was at the Top of a hill, opposite Bolton Castle, the Eure flowing beneath. William has since wrote a sonnet on this our imprisonment\x{2014}Hard was thy Durance Queen compared with ours. Poor Mary! Wm fell asleep, lying upon my breast & I upon Mary. I lay motionless for a long time, but I was at last obliged to move. I became very sick & continued so for some time after the Boy brought the horse to us. Mary had been a little sick but it soon went off.\x{2014}We had a sweet ride till we came to a public house on the side of a hill where we alighted & walked down to see the waterfalls. The sun was not set, & the woods & fields were spread over with the yellow light of Evening, which made their greenness a thousand times more green. There was too much water in the River for the beauty of the falls, & even the Banks were less interesting than in Winter. Nature had entirely got the better in her struggles against the giants who first cast the mould of these works; for indeed it is a place that did not in winter remind one of God, but one could not help feeling as if there had been the agency of some \x{2018}Mortal Instruments\x{2019} which Nature had been struggling against without making a perfect conquest. There was something so wild & new in this feeling, knowing as we did in the inner man that God alone had laid his hand upon it that I could not help regretting the want of it, besides it is a pleasure to a real lover of Nature to give winter all the glory he can, for summer will make its own way, & speak its own praises. We saw the pathway which Wm & I took at the close of Evening, the path leading to the Rabbit Warren where we lost ourselves. The farm with its holly hedges was lost among the green hills & hedgerows in general, but we found it out & were glad to look at it again. When William had left us to seek the waterfalls Mary & I were frightened by a Cow. At our return to the Inn we found new horses & a new Driver, & we went on nicely to Hawes where we arrived before it was quite dark. Mary & I got tea, & William had a partridge & mutton chops & tarts for his supper. Mary sate down with him. We had also a shilling\x{2019}s worth of negus & Mary made me some Broth for all which supper we were only charged 2/-. I could not sit up long. I vomited, & took the Broth & then slept sweetly. We rose at 6 o clock\x{2014}a rainy morning. We had a good Breakfast & then departed. There was a very pretty view about a mile from Hawes, where we crossed a Bridge, bare, & very green fields with cattle, a glittering stream cottages, a few ill-grown trees, & high hills. The sun shone now. Before we got upon the bare hills there was a hunting lodge on our right exactly like Greta Hill, with fir plantations about it. We were very fortunate in the day, gleams of sunshine passing clouds, that travelled with their shadows below them. Mary was much pleased with Garsdale. It was a dear place to William & me. We noted well the publick-house (Garsdale Hall) where we had baited & drunk our pint of ale, & afterwards the mountain which had been adorned by Jupiter in his glory when we were here before. It was <<mid-day|3b>> when we reached Sedbergh, & market day. We were in the same Room where we had spent the Evening together in our road to Grasmere. We had a pleasant Ride to Kendal, where we arrived at <<about 2 o\x{2019}clock|6>>\x{2014}the day favored us\x{2014}M & I went to see the house where dear Sara had lived, then went to seek Mr Bousfield\x{2019}s shop but we found him not\x{2014}he had sold all his goods the Day before. We then went to the Pot woman\x{2019}s & bought 2 jugs & a Dish, & some paper at Pennington\x{2019}s. When we came to the Inn William was almost ready for us. The afternoon was not chearful but it did not rain till we came near Windermere. I am always glad to see Stavely it is a place I dearly love to think of\x{2014}the first mountain village that I came to with Wm when we first began our pilgrimage together. Here we drank a Bason of milk at a publick house, & here I washed my feet in the Brook & put on a pair of silk stockings by Wm\x{2019}s advice.\x{2014} Nothing particular occurred till we reached Ing\x{2019}s chapel\x{2014}the door was open & we went in. It is a neat little place, with a marble floor & marble communion Table with a painting over it of the last supper, & Moses & Aaron on each side. The woman told us that \x{2018}they had painted them as near as they could by the dresses as they are described in the Bible\x{2019}, & gay enough they are. The Marble had been sent by Richard Bateman from Leghorn. The woman told us that a Man had been at her house a few days before who told her he had helped to bring it down the Red Sea & she had believed him gladly. It rained very hard when we reached Windermere. We sate in the rain at Wilcocks to change horses, & arrived at Grasmere at about 6 o clock on Wednesday Evening, the 6th of October 1802. Molly was overjoyed to see us,\x{2014}for my part I cannot describe what I felt, & our dear Mary\x{2019}s feelings would I dare say not be easy to speak of. We went by candle light into the garden & were astonished at the growth of the Brooms, Portugal Laurels, &c &c &\x{2014}The next day, Thursday, we unpacked the Boxes. On Friday 8th we baked Bread, & Mary & I walked, first upon the Hill side, & then in John\x{2019}s Grove, then in view of Rydale, the first walk that I had taken with my Sister.",

I have been beside him ever since tea running the heel of a stocking, repeating some of his sonnets to him, listening to his own repeating, reading some of Milton\x{2019}s & the Allegro & Penseroso. It is a quiet keen frost. Mary is in the parlour below attending to the baking of cakes & Jenny Fletcher\x{2019}s pies. Sara is in bed in the tooth ache, & so we are\x{2014} beloved William is turning over the leaves of Charlotte Smith\x{2019}s sonnets, but he keeps his hand to his poor chest pushing aside his breastplate. Mary is well & I am well, & Molly is as blithe as last year at this time. Coleridge came this morning with Wedgwood. We all turned out of Wm\x{2019}s bedroom one by one to meet him\x{2014}he looked well. We had to tell him of the Birth of his little Girl, born yesterday morning at 6 o clock. W went with them to Wytheburn in the Chaise, & M & I met Wm on the Rays. It was not an unpleasant morning to the feelings\x{2014}far from it\x{2014}the sun shone now & then, & there was no wind, but all things looked chearless & distinct, no meltings of sky into mountains\x{2014}the mountains like stone-work wrought up with huge hammers.\x{2014}Last Sunday was as mild a day as I ever remember\x{2014}We all set off together to walk. I went to Rydale & Wm returned with me. M & S went round the Lakes. There were flowers of various kinds the topmost bell of a fox-glove, geraniums, daisies\x{2014}a buttercup in the water (but this I saw two or three days before) small yellow flowers (I do not know their name) in the turf a large bunch of strawberry blossoms. Wm sate a while with me, then went to meet M. & S.\x{2014}Last Saturday I dined at Mr Simpsons also a beautiful mild day. Monday was a frosty day, & it has been frost ever since.

The sound of the pattering shower, and the gusts of wind, very grand. Left the wood when nothing remained of the storm but the driving wind, and a few scattering drops of rain. Presently all clear, Venus first showing herself between the struggling clouds; afterwards Jupiter appeared. The hawthorn hedges black and pointed, glittering with millions of diamond drops; the hollies shining with broader patches of light. The road to the village of Holford glittered like another stream.

I never saw such a union of earth, sky, and sea. The clouds beneath our feet spread themselves to the water, and the clouds of the sky almost joined them.

The First Notebook: Grasmere Journal, 14 May 1800\x{2013}22 December 1800 (DC MS 20)
This, the first of the four notebooks containing the Grasmere Journal, is a book of less than 4\x{201d} X 6\x{201d}, its boards covered in mottled brown paper. On the first page are the words \x{2018}May\x{2014}1800. Wm & John set off into Yorkshire\x{2019}, and with this plain fact, <<after two|9:0>> or <<three|20a:0>> preliminary \x{2018}amens\x{2019} to test the sharpened end of her quill pen, D launched into her great Journal. She drew a full line across the page after each entry.",

            "It had not been a completely empty notebook when D picked it up in May; she had first used it in the German winter of 1798\x{2013}9 when she and W stayed in Goslar. We know this from the jottings and sums on both inside covers: these are lists of clothes that range from shirts, nightcaps, and handkerchiefs to the more expensive fur items that were needed in that cold winter, see 14 Mar. 1802 n.; there is also a list of groceries\x{2014}bread, milk, sugar, rum. There are prices in German currency against the items, and scattered conversion sums: 16d. to the mark, D tells us in her Hamburg Journal. There are random phrases of German and English, written and re-written in a small elaborate hand; D was clearly practising the formal 18th\x{2013}c. German script. The phrase \x{2018}with Peter\x{2019} is in this tiny script (W had been \x{2018}employed in hewing down Peter Bell\x{2019}, EY, p. 256); so is the unlikely word, \x{2018}industry\x{2019}, and the repeatedly written name, \x{2018}Madama Deppermann\x{2019}; this lady was the \x{2018}good kind of a respectable woman\x{2026} a widow with 5 children and keeps a linen draper\x{2019}s shop\x{2019} (EY, p. 245) with whom the Ws lodged at <<107|3:0>> Breitstrasse in Goslar. There is a list of clothes without prices\x{2014}as though of garments to be packed; D, having no maid, takes an apron as well as a gown. Whatever else the notebook contained of that time in Goslar is lost, because 6 pages have been cut out at the front and 5 at the back, and some of these, as the remains indicate, contained lists and accounts. D had next used the notebook, from the back, on their return from Germany, when, from the early summer of 1799, she and W stayed with their friends the Hutchinsons at Sockburn in Co. Durham. She copied out 4 epitaphs: 2 from a Life of Benjamin Franklin (1st edn., 1793), one from Hutchinson\x{2019}s History of Durham (1794), and one taken from the Churchyard at Marske, Yorkshire (30 miles from Sockburn). Alongside the first epitaph (the first 5 pages having gone), and filling up small spaces amongst the heterogeneous items on the back cover, are two tiny drawings of a church, one complete with churchyard and tombstones. After the epitaphs D has written out 5 verses for the \x{2018}Complaint of the Forsaken Indian Woman\x{2019}, verses not however used for the 2nd edn. of LB (1800) (see PW ii. 475\x{2013}6). These verses meet the Dec. end of the Grasmere Journal as it comes from the front of the book.",

He and his half-brother Thomas were old friends of the Ws\x{2019} uncle, the Revd William Cookson. The Ws at some point took Mr Twining\x{2019}s advice in the Encyclopaedia note (under \x{2018}Tea\x{2019}) not to buy cheap tea at, say, 41/4d. or even 9d. per lb. (often adulterated with sheep\x{2019}s dung) but to purchase \x{2018}from persons of character\x{2019}. There was a heavy tax on tea and it could cost up to \x{a3}1 per lb. (see 21 June 1802 for the excessively disastrous consequences of drinking tea). In the early DC years John might send an occasional, \x{2018}Box of Tea\x{2019} (EY, p. 385); later the Ws bought from Richard Twining and from his son Richard.

Thomas Myers (1764\x{2014}1835), the son, was assisted in his career by his mother\x{2019}s cousin, John Robinson of Appleby, the influential MP for Harwich; at <<17|9e>>, like John W, he joined the East India Company and in 1796 became Accountant-General of Bengal.

The ship did not leave Portsmouth for China until mid-May 1801, and docked back into Gravesend, London, in Sept. 1802. D and W were themselves in London at that time after their visit to Annette Vallon in France, and they spent some days with John. It was their last time together. Between May 1803 and Aug. 1804 John W made another voyage to China, and was again setting out, in early 1805, this time for Bengal as well as for China, when on 5 Feb. the ship struck rocks off Portland and Captain W was among the 232 people to be drowned.

Through these Volumes I became first familiar with Chaucer, and so little money had I then to spare for books, that, in all probability, but for this same work, I should have known little of Drayton, Daniel, and other distinguished poets of the Elizabethan age, and their immediate successors, till a much later period of my life\x{2019} (Fenwick Note, PW iii. 450\x{2013}1). W\x{2019}s tribute to Anderson is just and John did indeed send him his set of Anderson (13 vols., now in WL), but not until more than a year after D and W\x{2019}s 1801 reading of Chaucer, Spenser, Daniel, etc. John, in May 1801 and ready to sail, had \x{2018}got Anderson\x{2019}s poets\x{2019}, though was \x{2018}at a loss where to begin\x{2019} and asked W\x{2019}s advice; 18 months later, back in England, he packed the books up for Grasmere in Dec. 1802. In 1801 and 1802, therefore, W must have had another set of Anderson, and this must have come from Greta Hall.

But the Rock could not withstand the Manchester Water Authority. In the late 1880s the water level of Thirlmere was raised, the old road blasted, and the Rock with it, to make way for a higher road and to find rubble for the dam. Fragments of the Rock of Names were gathered up by Canon H. D. Rawnsley, cemented into a small pyramid of stone, and placed above the new road. In 1984 there were new fears for the safety of the initials and they were fixed into natural slate in their original configuration (as early photographs make clear) and embedded into a rock-face behind the W Museum at Grasmere.",

The Pedlar was based also on the packman W had known as a schoolboy in Hawkshead, and he was freshly based on James Patrick (27 Jan. 1802 n.). This meant alterations and additions. Further, some passages were removed and placed in the growing Prelude. There were several plans for the poem.

Copper-mines were opened in 1784 under land originally belonging to the Dodingtons of Dodington Hall, not far east of the Castle of Comfort. The land and mines in the late 18th c. were in the hands of the Marquis of Buckingham. According to an 1801 plan of the Stowey Mine, as it was called, there were \x{2018}a powder-house, two charging-houses, two pumping-houses, an account-house, blacksmith\x{2019}s shop, miners\x{2019} cottages, and an ore floor\x{2019} (quoted, Berta Lawrence, Quantock Country, London, 1952, p. 186). The mines were worked until <<1820|9c:0>>. C, in Germany in May 1799, remembered a visit he had made to the Stowey mines: \x{2018}\x{2026} we came to Clausthal, a large Town with a number of mines around it, one of which all but myself descended. I had before read a most minute Description of the said Mine; & from the same concluded that I should see nothing new after what I had seen at Stowey \x{2026}\x{2019} (CL, i. 514). Perhaps C also recalled that an experience of mines need not be entirely pleasurable: D, walking through the flooded ways of the Harz forest in Feb. 1799, reported that \x{2018}we were often obliged to walk as in the mines at Stowey, above the ankles in water \x{2026}\x{2019} (EY, p. 252).",
