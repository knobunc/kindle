That was the year Liliuokalani, the last queen of Hawaii, was born in Honolulu; by century\x{2019}s end, she would be ousted in a coup d\x{2019}\x{e9}tat by the white sons of New England missionaries; eventually, her kingdom became the fiftieth of the fifty states. <<Eighteen thirty-eight|5k:1>> was also the year my Cherokee great-something grandparents were trudging west at gunpoint so the white citizens of Georgia, the Carolinas, and Tennessee could take their land.",

            "The first time I read that I wondered where I had seen it before. Then I realized it was at the end of The Great Gatsby,  the great novel of ambition. After the striving title character meets his tragic end, his father arrives from Minnesota for the funeral, bringing with him a book in which his son had inscribed a list of his ambitions as a youth. There is a rigid schedule that begins with getting up early, and filling the day with work, exercise, and study. From five until <<six p.m.|5>>, he is to \x{201c}Practice elocution, poise and how to attain it.\x{201d} Then, in a list of \x{201c}general resolves,\x{201d} he orders himself to quit smoking and wasting time, \x{201c}read one improving book or magazine per week,\x{201d} set money aside, and \x{201c}be better to parents.\x{201d} Gatsby\x{2019}s father tells Gatsby\x{2019}s friend the list proves that his boy \x{201c}was bound to get ahead.\x{201d} Sure, his son had just died in a swimming pool, but at least it was a very fancy pool.",

Some Salem men, including John Endecott, came out in boats to fetch them. Endecott was the Massachusetts Bay Company\x{2019}s advance man. He had led a small group of pioneers to America two years earlier to prepare the way for large-scale settlement. So that evening, Endecott and his fellows fed Winthrop supper in Salem, \x{201c}a good venison pasty and good beer.\x{201d}",

            "The New England Puritans are not remembered for their sweetness, and yet there was much sweetness in them. This is especially true of Winthrop. For instance, he sailed to Massachusetts alone to get settled. Until he could send for his wife, Margaret, he wrote her a letter proposing that they think of each other at a specific time twice a week, a sort of steady date on the astral plane. He promised, \x{201c}Mondays and Fridays, at <<five of the clock at night|6>>, we shall meet in spirit till we meet in person.\x{201d} But Winthrop is so busy his first few months in Massachusetts he sends Margaret a letter confessing he\x{2019}s been standing her up on their mental dates. \x{201c}I own with sorrow that much business hath made me too often forget Mondays and Fridays,\x{201d} he wrote.",

As a good Calvinist, he will continue to write in his journal things like \x{201c}the devil would never cease to disturb our peace.\x{201d} But still, by <<1638|9n:0>>, the troublemakers were gone. Williams had been banished and yet still served as Winthrop\x{2019}s toady in dealing with the Indians. Hutchinson was not only banished but giving birth to the monster babies she deserved in godforsaken Rhode Island. The Pequot were done for. That swanky crybaby Henry Vane had sniffled his way back to England, and Winthrop with his God-given tallness was governor again. Even the ship that was supposed to bring a new governor commissioned by Archbishop Laud had literally broken apart\x{2014}\x{2019}twas by God\x{2019}s providence, for sure. And anyway, the king had so many  problems back home as the English Civil War starts to simmer, he couldn\x{2019}t be bothered about a few scruffy religious fanatics in Massachusetts.",
