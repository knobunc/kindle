But now Simplicity was holding his arm and he was aware that she needed his support, which slowed him down, and that somehow also slowed his thinking so that the bits came together neatly, instead of in a hurry. He turned and looked at Mrs Sharples, walking behind them. It was early afternoon and around here it was pleasant to walk, and in this bright light he felt curiously happy and at home with the girl on his arm. She kept in step, and every time he glanced at her she smiled at him and there was a peace that you didn\x{2019}t get in the rookeries until <<one in the morning|5>> when the dead had stopped screaming and the living were too drunk to care. Suddenly it didn\x{2019}t seem to matter whether Simplicity recognized anything important or not; it was enough that they were out for this walk together.",

So I\x{2019}ll do a little walk around there early in the day to make sure there ain\x{2019}t going to be any problems because you never know.
