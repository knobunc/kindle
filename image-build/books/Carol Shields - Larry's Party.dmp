He switched on the light one night, <<four a.m.|5>>, motorbikes squealing in the distance - shouldn\x{2019}t that be church bells? - and stared at Beth, sleep-drugged by his side. What to do? He fumbled in the drawer of the night table for the Gideon Bible, thinking he might try a page or two to see if its tight dull print would lull him to sleep.",

            "After the break-up with his first wife he grew a beard. It started with a lazy feeling of sadness - too sad to move around much or talk, too sad to shave. His friends, hesitant about offering sympathy or advice, were given the opportunity, instead, to comment on Larry\x{2019}s beard, how well it was coming along, how there were glints of surprising red amongst the brown, how some men could wear a beard and others couldn\x{2019}t. \x{201c}Jesus Christ himself,\x{201d} his father commented. Finally, the hay-fever season did Larry in; ragweed pollen moved into his beard and drove him crazy at night. He rose one September morning at <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>> and shaved himself clean. \x{201c}Hello there,\x{201d} he said to the young chin in the mirror, and made a face.",

What  is this paradise? Touching. Being touched. The unburdened self, half-conscious once again of primitive melodies playing offstage. The unearned privilege of a human hand on his human body. A willing caress, that leaping increment of knowledge locked in the skin, yes, oh, yes. His throttled, misshapen, and discontinuous life might yet be rescued. As it was this very minute by a woman called Charlotte Angus. When he least deserved it.",

            "Larry, slicing through the pink lamb and serving second helpings on  to still-warm dinner plates, is struck by a thought. That he\x{2019}s hardly ever given a party before. He grew up in a house that, except for family dinners, never once resonated with the chimes of party noise and festivity. No children\x{2019}s birthday parties, nothing happening on New Year\x{2019}s Eve except the TV, Times Square, New York City, and a glass of sweet sherry at <<midnight|13>>. Had his mother and father simply lacked the gene for hospitality? Or, and this is more likely, had they been too shy, or else ignorant of the shaping impulse that blows a party into being? It should be such a simple, natural thing, really, the gathering of a few friends under a roof, the offering of food and drink and warmth and also that curious tensile and sometimes dangerous platform of opportunity for something to happen.",

Never mind, though. I expect you\x{2019}re sound asleep and can\x{2019}t hear the phone ringing. Or don\x{2019}t want to hear the phone ringing. Just thought I\x{2019}d say thanks for the great party. Marcia McCord is a very naughty girl, isn\x{2019}t she? Actually, she\x{2019}s a mess. Poor Garth. Why are men such sops? And by the way, this question does not require an answer. Ian and I thought your soup was a smash - and naturally he wants the recipe. Also you get points for your roast lamb and the dessert, which I\x{2019}m damn sure did not come out of La Cuisine Weller. An interesting evening. Your stone guest was - hmmmm \x{2014} a bit stony, playing his role of visiting foreigner so straight and tight and hand-kissingly charming. But somehow I warmed to him in the end. Maybe because he was nice to Charlotte, who was looking a little - baffled. Or did you notice? What idiots women are! Yours truly included. Beth was - how shall I put this? - herself. Full of herself. Full of baby and self. One compacted self-referential sphere of  flesh. She\x{2019}ll be fine. Hope you\x{2019}ve figured that much out. And Dorrie. I always wondered what would happen if you and Dorrie got together again. Well, I had a hunch she was waiting for a second ride on the merry-go-round, even if she didn\x{2019}t know it herself. So long, kiddo. Talk to you later.",

Just great. Great food and company. Marcia slept right through the night - no sedative or anything. First time in ages. Great sign. Sorry about rough bumps. But it was great. Marcia says thanks.
