            "\x{201c}The Satanic Verses has all the excellences that made [<<Midnight|13>>\x{2019}s Children] a publishing event: an epic sweep and feel for the larger currents of history reminiscent of Tolstoy, a comic genius for idiosyncratic characterization in polyphonic voices worthy of Dickens, together with the imaginative freedom of fabulation characteristic of Latin American fiction and its magical realism. The Satanic Verses [is] a wider ranging novel. Not since Gravity\x{2019}s Rainbow has any novel so successfully captured the cosmopolitan texture of modern life.\x{2026} Finally, The Satanic Verses confronts the problem of religion and modern life in such a direct and profound way that it has been banned in India, Pakistan, South Africa, and all the Arab countries.\x{2026} If you want to find out why Rushdie is arguably the most talented and significant author writing in the English language today, by all means read this book.\x{201d}",

Or something very like it; for had not that outsize face, suspended over its devotees in the artificial cinematic night, shone like that of some supernal Entity that had its being at least halfway between the mortal and the divine? More than halfway, many would have argued, for Gibreel had spent the greater part of his unique career incarnating, with absolute conviction, the countless deities of the subcontinent in the popular genre movies known as \x{2018}theologicals\x{2019}. It was part of the magic of his persona that he succeeded in crossing religious boundaries without giving offence. Blue-skinned as Krishna he danced, flute in hand, amongst the beauteous gopis and their udder-heavy cows; with upturned palms, serene, he meditated (as Gautama) upon humanity\x{2019}s suffering beneath a studio-rickety bodhi-tree. On those infrequent occasions when he descended from the heavens he never went too far, playing, for example, both the Grand Mughal and his famously wily minister in the classic Akbar and Birbal. For over a decade and a half he had represented, to hundreds of millions of believers in that country in which, to this day, the human population outnumbers the divine by less than <<three to one|10a:0>>, the most acceptable, and instantly recognizable, face of the Supreme. For many of his fans, the boundary separating the performer and his roles had longago ceased to exist.",

Once the formula of making films based on the puranas, and adding the usual mixture of songs, dances, funny uncles etc., had paid off, every god in the pantheon got his or her chance to be a star. When D. W. Rama scheduled a production based on the story of Ganesh, none of the leading box-office names of the time were willing to spend an entire movie concealed inside an elephant\x{2019}s head.

That was his first hit, Ganpati Baba, and suddenly he was a superstar, but only with the trunk and ears on. <<After six|9:0>> movies playing the elephant-headed god he was permitted to remove the thick, pendulous, grey mask and put on, instead, a long, hairy tail, in order to play Hanuman the monkey king in a sequence of adventure movies that owed more to a certain cheap television series emanating from Hong Kong than it did to the Ramayana. This series proved so popular that monkey-tails became de rigueur for the city\x{2019}s young bucks at the kind of parties frequented by convent girls known as \x{2018}firecrackers\x{2019} because of their readiness to go off with a bang.",

            "\x{2013} From the air, the camera watches the entrance to Club Hot Wax. Now the police have finished with wax effigies and are bringing out real human beings. The camera homes in on the arrested persons: a tall albino man; a man in an Armani suit, looking like a dark mirror-image of de Niro; a young girl of \x{2013} what? \x{2013} <<fourteen|9k:0>>, <<fifteen|9k:0>>? \x{2013} a sullen young man of twenty or thereabouts. No names are titled; the camera does not know these faces. Gradually, however, the facts emerge. The club DJ, Sewsunker Ram, known as \x{2018}Pinkwalla\x{2019}, and its proprietor, Mr John Maslama, are to be charged with running a large-scale narcotics operation \x{2013} crack, brown sugar, hashish, cocaine. The man arrested with them, an employee at Maslama\x{2019}s nearby \x{2018}Fair Winds\x{2019} music store, is the registered owner of a van in which an unspecified quantity of \x{2018}hard drugs\x{2019} has been discovered; also numbers of \x{2018}hot\x{2019} video recorders. The young girl\x{2019}s name is Anahita Sufyan; she is under-age, is said to have been drinking heavily, and, it is hinted, having sex with at least one of the three arrested men. She is further reported to have a history of truancy and association with known criminal types: a delinquent, clearly. \x{2013} An illuminated journalist will offer the nation these titbits many hours after the event, but the news is already running wild in the streets: Pinkwalla! \x{2013} And the Wax: they smashed the place up \x{2013} totalled it! \x{2013} Now it\x{2019}s war.",

We leave it to you to select the individuals best suited to the trip. Then, truly, you will have performed a miracle for some instead of for none. And in my view the pilgrimage itself has been a miracle, in a way. So you will have done very much.\x{2019}",

            "That night, Salahuddin forced Nasreen and Kasturba to sleep comfortably in their own beds while he kept watch over Changez from a mattress on the floor. After his <<midnight|13>> dose of Isosorbide, the dying man slept for three hours, and then needed to go to the toilet. Salahuddin virtually lifted him to his feet, and was astonished at Changez\x{2019}s lightness. This had always been a weighty man, but now he was a living lunch for the advancing cancer cells\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}in the toilet, Changez refused all help. \x{2018}He won\x{2019}t let you do one thing,\x{2019} Kasturba had complained lovingly. \x{2018}Such a shy fellow that he is.\x{2019} On his way back to bed he leaned lightly on Salahuddin\x{2019}s arm, and shuffled along flat-footed in old, worn bedroom slippers, his remaining hairs sticking out at comical angles, his head stuck beakily forward on its scrawny, fragile neck. Salahuddin suddenly longed to pick the old man up, to cradle him in his arms and sing soft, comforting songs. Instead, he blurted out, at this least appropriate of moments, an appeal for reconciliation. \x{2018}Abba, I came because I didn\x{2019}t want there to be trouble between us any more \x{2026}\x{2019} Fucking idiot. The Devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac\x{2019}d loon. In the middle of the bloody night! And if he hasn\x{2019}t guessed he\x{2019}s dying, that little deathbed speech will certainly have let him know. Changez continued to shuffle along; his grip on his son\x{2019}s arm tightened very slightly. \x{2018}That doesn\x{2019}t matter any more,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s forgotten, whatever it was.\x{2019}",

The specialist, Panikkar (a name the English would mispronounce and giggle over, Salahuddin thought, like the Muslim \x{2018}Fakhar\x{2019}), arrived at <<ten|9c:1>>, shining with self-esteem. \x{2018}I should tell him,\x{2019} he said, taking control. \x{2018}Most patients feel ashamed to let their loved ones see their fear.\x{2019} \x{2018}The hell you will,\x{2019} Salahuddin said with a vehemence that took him by surprise. \x{2018}Well, in that case,\x{2019} Panikkar shrugged, making as if to leave; which won the argument, because now Nasreen and Kasturba pleaded with Salahuddin: \x{2018}Please, let\x{2019}s not fight.\x{2019} Salahuddin, defeated, ushered the doctor into his father\x{2019}s presence; and shut the study door.",

It didn\x{2019}t help. At <<seven pm|5>> the risk of dehydration was growing, and Changez was too weak to sit up for his food.

Now.\x{2019} The proof of Changez\x{2019}s decline was that, this last time, he permitted his son to help him out. \x{2018}Black shit is bad,\x{2019} he said, panting for breath. His lungs had filled up alarmingly; the breath was like bubbles pushing through glue. \x{2018}Some cancers are slow, but I think this is very fast. Deterioration is very rapid.\x{2019} And Salahuddin, the apostle of truth, told comforting lies: Abba, don\x{2019}t worry. You\x{2019}ll be fine. Changez Chamchawala shook his head. \x{2018}I\x{2019}m going, son,\x{2019} he said. His chest heaved; Salahuddin grabbed a large plastic mug and held it under Changez\x{2019}s mouth. The dying man vomited up more than a pint of phlegm mixed up with blood: and after that was too weak to talk. This time Salahuddin did have to carry him, to the back seat of the Mercedes, where he sat between Nasreen and Kasturba while Salahuddin drove at top speed to Breach Candy Hospital, half a mile down the road. \x{2018}Shall I open the window, Abba?\x{2019} he asked at one point, and Changez shook his head and bubbled: \x{2018}No.\x{2019} Much later, Salahuddin realized this had been his father\x{2019}s last word.",

The order to join hands had been given by the organizers \x{2013} Swatilekha prominent among them, riding on the back of a jeep, megaphone in hand \x{2013} at <<eight am|5>> precisely; one hour later, as the city\x{2019}s rush-hour traffic reached its blaring peak, the crowd began to disperse.
