The heart of his breakfast was a plenitude of sourdough biscuits, which he cooked in a Dutch oven out in the backyard.

The rest of the breakfast was secondary, just a matter of whacking off a few slabs of bacon and frying a panful of pullet eggs. Bolivar could generally be trusted to deal with the coffee.",
