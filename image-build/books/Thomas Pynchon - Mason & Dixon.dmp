            "At first, and then upon re-reading, he could make no more sense of the Letter than Bradley had done. One of Mason\x{2019}s chores as Assistant was to review just such Correspondence. Since the Longitude Act of 1714, which offer\x{2019}d Prizes up to twenty thousand Pounds for a reliable way to find the true Longitude at Sea, the Observatory had become a Target for Suggestions, Schemes, Rants, Sermons, full-length Books, all directed to Bradley\x{2019}s Attention, upon the Problem of the Longitude. Though some were cagy, hinting at Amazing Simplicity and Ingenious Devising, whilst giving no details, most of the letters were all-out philosophick confessions, showing either an unhealthy na\x{ef}vet\x{e9}, or an inner certainty that the Scheme would never work anyway. For many, it was at least a chance to Rattle at length to a World that was ignoring them. Others were more passionate as to the worth of their Inventions, though employing Arts more of the Actor-Projector than of the Geometer. Occasionally Insanity roll\x{2019}d a sly Eye-ball into the picture. Treatises on \x{201c}Para-geography\x{201d} arriv\x{2019}d, with alternative Maps of the World superimpos\x{2019}d upon the more familiar ones. Many,\x{2014} as had the elder Cabot upon his deathbed,\x{2014} claim\x{2019}d to\x{2019}ve been told the Secrets of the Longitude by God (or, as some preferr\x{2019}d, Thatwhichever Created Earth and her Rate of Spin).

Many who have been to Rooms forbidden the others, report seeing, inside these, a Door to at least one Room further, which may not be opened.

The Madmen are of every race, condition, and degree of Affliction, from the amiably delusionary to the remorselessly homicidal. Some of them hate women, some desire them, some know hate and desire as but minor aspects of a greater, Oceanick Impulse, in which, report those who survive, it is unquestionably better not to be included.
