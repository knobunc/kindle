            "Suppose that a car starts from a stationary position. When the stopwatch starts, the driver slams his foot on the accelerator. Suppose that we record that after t seconds the driver has covered t x t meters. How fast is the car going after ten seconds? We get an approximation of the speed by looking at how far the car has traveled in the period from <<ten to eleven|10a:0>> seconds. The average speed during this time is (11 x 11 \x{2212} 10 x 10)/1 = 21 meters per second.",

            "Slightly slower, of course, because the car is accelerating, so on average it is going faster in the second half second. But what if we take an even smaller snapshot. What about halving the window of time again:
(<<10.25|5a:0>> x <<10.25|5a:0>> \x{2212} 10 x 10)/0.25 = 20.25 meters per second.
I hope the mathematician in you has spotted the pattern. If I take a window of time that is x seconds, the average speed over this time will be 20 + x meters per second. The speed as I take smaller and smaller windows of time is getting closer and closer to twenty meters per second. So, although to calculate the speed at 10 seconds looks like I have to figure out the calculation 0/0, the calculus makes sense of what this should mean.",

By <<1825|9n:0>>, it was way ahead of its predicted position, but then it started to slow down, and by 1832 it had fallen behind the point where scientists had predicted it should be. Was there some mysterious substance out there causing resistance? Did Newton\x{2019}s laws of gravitation break down at such a great distance from the sun? Some suggested that just as Jupiter and Saturn were exerting a gravitational pull on Uranus, perhaps there was another planet out there pushing and pulling it around.

The rubber band gets stretched only after each second, and it will be an instantaneous stretch. So after one second the ant has traveled one centimeter, which is <<1|9d>>/100,000 of the total distance. Then the band expands. The point to note is that although the distance that the ant needs to travel has increased, it has at least still covered 1/100,000 of the distance between the star and Earth, because the stretch has also helped push the ant on a little from its starting position.',

Tiny cogs inside the watch are driven by a tiny electric motor that in turn is driven by one-second pulses that have their origin in the oscillations of a tiny quartz crystal. The battery that sits inside the watch sets up a voltage across the crystal that makes it vibrate like a bell with a frequency tuned to 32,768 vibrations per second. This number is chosen for its mathematical properties. It is <<2|9d>> to the power of 15. Digital technology likes powers of 2 because computer circuitry can quickly convert this into a mechanical pulse to drive the cogs every second. Importantly, this frequency is not greatly affected by the surrounding temperature, air pressure, or altitude (factors that affect a pendulum, for example). And this vibrating, the repetition of motion, is key to marking the passage of time. But is this sufficient to describe the idea of time?",
