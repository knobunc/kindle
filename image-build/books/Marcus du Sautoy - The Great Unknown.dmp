            "Slightly slower, of course, because the car is accelerating, so on average it is going faster in the second half second. But what if we take an even smaller snapshot. What about halving the window of time again:
(<<10.25|5a:0>> x <<10.25|5a:0>> \x{2212} 10 x 10)/0.25 = 20.25 meters per second.
I hope the mathematician in you has spotted the pattern. If I take a window of time that is x seconds, the average speed over this time will be 20 + x meters per second. The speed as I take smaller and smaller windows of time is getting closer and closer to twenty meters per second. So, although to calculate the speed at 10 seconds looks like I have to figure out the calculation 0/0, the calculus makes sense of what this should mean.",

Tiny cogs inside the watch are driven by a tiny electric motor that in turn is driven by one-second pulses that have their origin in the oscillations of a tiny quartz crystal. The battery that sits inside the watch sets up a voltage across the crystal that makes it vibrate like a bell with a frequency tuned to 32,768 vibrations per second. This number is chosen for its mathematical properties. It is 2 to the power of 15. Digital technology likes powers of 2 because computer circuitry can quickly convert this into a mechanical pulse to drive the cogs every second. Importantly, this frequency is not greatly affected by the surrounding temperature, air pressure, or altitude (factors that affect a pendulum, for example). And this vibrating, the repetition of motion, is key to marking the passage of time. But is this sufficient to describe the idea of time?",
