            "\x{201c}I will start at the beginning. When Miss Ackroyd asked me to investigate the case, I went up to Fernly Park with the good Doctor Sheppard. I walked with him along the terrace, where I was shown the footprints on the windowsill. From there Inspector Raglan took me along the path which leads to the drive. My eye was caught by a little summerhouse, and I searched it thoroughly. I found two things\x{2014}a scrap of starched cambric and an empty goose quill. The scrap of cambric immediately suggested to me a maid\x{2019}s apron. When Inspector Raglan showed me his list of the people in the house, I noticed at once that one of the maids\x{2014}Ursula Bourne, the parlourmaid\x{2014}had no real alibi. According to her own story, she was in her bedroom from <<nine-thirty|5k:0>> until <<ten|9c:0>>. But supposing that instead she was in the summerhouse? If so, she must have gone there to meet someone. Now we know from Dr. Sheppard that someone from outside did come to the house that night\x{2014}the stranger whom he met just by the gate. At first glance it would seem that our problem was solved, and that the stranger went to the summerhouse to meet Ursula Bourne. It was fairly certain that he did go to the summerhouse because of the goose quill. That suggested at once to my mind a taker of drugs\x{2014}and one who had acquired the habit on the other side of the Atlantic where sniffing \x{2018}snow\x{2019} is more common than in this country. The man whom Dr. Sheppard met had an American accent, which fitted in with that supposition.",

Ursula Bourne could certainly not have gone to the summerhouse before <<nine-thirty|9c:1>>, whereas the man must have got there by <<a few minutes past nine|10>>. I could, of course, assume that he waited there for half an hour. The only alternative supposition was that there had been two separate meetings in the summerhouse that night. Eh bien, as soon as I went into that alternative I found several significant facts. I discovered that Miss Russell, the housekeeper, had visited Dr. Sheppard that morning, and had displayed a good deal of interest in cures for victims of the drug habit. Taking that in conjunction with the goose quill, I assumed that the man in question came to Fernly to meet the housekeeper, and not Ursula Bourne. Who, then, did Ursula Bourne come to the rendezvous to meet? I was not long in doubt. First I found a ring\x{2014}a wedding ring\x{2014}with \x{2018}From R.\x{2019} and a date inside it. Then I learnt that Ralph Paton had been seen coming up the path which led to the summerhouse at <<twenty-five minutes past nine|10>>, and I also heard of a certain conversation which had taken place in the wood near the village that very afternoon\x{2014}a conversation between Ralph Paton and some unknown girl. So I had my facts succeeding each other in a neat and orderly manner.

            "\x{201c}But yes. You will remember that everyone agreed\x{2014}you yourself included\x{2014}that it took five minutes to walk from the lodge to the house\x{2014}less if you took the short cut to the terrace. But you left the house at <<ten minutes to nine|10>>\x{2014}both by your own statement and that of Parker, and yet it was <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>> when you passed through the lodge gates. It was a chilly night\x{2014}not an evening a man would be inclined to dawdle; why had you taken ten minutes to do a five minutes\x{2019} walk? All along I realized that we had only your statement for it that the study window was ever fastened. Ackroyd asked you if you had done so\x{2014}he never looked to see. Supposing, then, that the study window was unfastened? Would there be time in that ten minutes for you to run round the outside of the house, change your shoes, climb in through the window, kill Ackroyd, and get to the gate by <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>? I decided against that theory since in all probability a man as nervous as Ackroyd was that night would hear you climbing in, and then there would have been a struggle. But supposing that you killed Ackroyd before you left\x{2014}as you were standing beside his chair? Then you go out of the front door, run round to the summerhouse, take Ralph Paton\x{2019}s shoes out of the bag you brought up with you that night, slip them on, walk through the mud in them, and leave prints on the window ledge, you climb in, lock the study door on the inside, run back to the summerhouse, change back into your own shoes, and race down to the gate. (I went through similar actions the other day, when you were with Mrs. Ackroyd\x{2014}it took ten minutes exactly.)
