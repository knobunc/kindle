Bilbo must live, then, after the introduction of a postal service \x{2013} our familiar system dates, in England, from <<1837|9c:0>>.

            "The author\x{2019}s voice

    The two sides of The Hobbit are, then, fairly clear: on the one side there is modern middle-class English Bilbo, on the other the archaic world which lies behind both vulgar folk-tale and its aristocratic, indeed heroic ancestors. The former is represented by clocks and fussiness \x{2013} Bilbo gasping out, \x{2018}I didn\x{2019}t get your note till <<after 10.45|3:1>> to be precise\x{2019}, and feeling he cannot leave home without a pocket-handkerchief. The latter is created by poetry and the Misty Mountains and Bilbo feeling how grand it would be to \x{2018}wear a sword instead of a walking-stick\x{2019}. Naturally the two sides are going to clash, and much of The Hobbit is about the clash of styles, attitudes, behaviour patterns \x{2013} though in the end one might conclude that they are not as far apart as they first seemed, and that Bilbo has just as much right to the archaic world and its treasures as Thorin or Bard. However the pressing problem for Tolkien was perhaps not to introduce the archaic world \x{2013} much of which, as has been said above, has long been familiar at least in its personnel even to child readers \x{2013} as to give it intellectual coherence, to make the reader feel that it had a sort of existence outside the immediate narrative. Tolkien solved this problem, in The Hobbit, if quite differently in The Lord of the Rings, by flexible and intrusive use of the authorial voice.",

            "A sidelight on his methods and interests at this stage is cast by Tolkien\x{2019}s short story Farmer Giles of Ham. This was not published till <<1949|9c:0>>, but we know (see Bibliography) that it was heavily rewritten at about this time, and read to an Oxford college literary society in January 1938, a month after Tolkien began The Lord of the Rings. In it one can see Tolkien brooding, not only over nursery-rhyme, but also over the place-names of Oxfordshire and the neighbouring counties. The fictional \x{2018}Ham\x{2019} of the title is the real village of Thame. Why should it be called Thame? Why is there an -h- in Thame, as in Thames, which no one ever pronounces? Should it not be Tame, and if so, what does Tame mean? Not far away from Thame is the equally real village of Worminghall, which seems on the face of it to mean \x{2018}the hall of the Wormings\x{2019}. But what are Wormings? If \x{2018}worm\x{2019} means dragon (as it often does in Old English), then might Wormings have something to do with a dragon \x{2013} conceivably a tame dragon, since Tame is so close by? From thoughts like this Tolkien constructed his story of the wicked dragon Chrysophylax, who is bested by Farmer Giles with his sword Tailbiter, or Caudimordax, and who enables Farmer Giles to escape from the tyranny of the king of the Middle Kingdom, Augustus Bonifacius Ambrosius Aurelianus Antoninus. The whole story is set in an imaginary past, the past of the \x{2018}Brutus books\x{2019} referred to by the author of Sir Gawain (which Tolkien had co-edited thirteen years before), but its geography is perfectly realistic. The villages of Thame and Worminghall, and Oakley, which had its parson eaten, can all still be found close together on the map of Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire \x{2013} Thame is in Oxfordshire, the other two in Buckinghamshire; and the same map will show the small town of Brill in Buckinghamshire, once *Bree-hill \x{2013} it was to be reshaped in The Lord of the Rings as Bree. The capital of the Middle Kingdom is not named, but is said to be \x{2018}twenty leagues\x{2019} away, or sixty miles; it must be Tamworth, the ancient capital of Mercia, sixty-eight miles from Thame as the crow flies. The village of Farthingho, where we are told Farmer Giles\x{2019}s Little Kingdom maintained \x{2018}an outpost against the Middle Kingdom\x{2019}, is almost exactly on a line between them, one-third of the way measured from Thame. When Farmer Giles grumbles about the strange people who live far away, \x{2018}beyond the Standing Stones and all\x{2019}, he must mean the inhabitants of Warwickshire as opposed to his own Oxfordshire: the boundary between the two counties runs by the famous Rollright Stones. In Farmer Giles Tolkien was using place-names in a way which he had avoided in The Hobbit, but which he was to rely on in The Lord of the Rings (names like Brill, or Bree, or T(h)ame, or Farthingho, are on the face of it very different from The Hill or The Water, if not always so different historically). He was moreover taking a close interest in locality.",

            "Generalizing successfully about this mass of heterogeneous material, a \x{2018}fixed tradition\x{2019}, as Christopher Tolkien notes, but never a \x{2018}fixed text\x{2019}, may seem to be impossible: but some shafts, one hopes of light, may be driven into it. <<One|5g:0>> by this time predictable point is that Tolkien derived some part of his invention, and a vital part, from an entirely novel solution to an old mythological problem. There was no doubt that a belief in \x{2018}elves\x{2019} (Old Norse \x{e1}lfar, Old English ylfe) was widespread in Germanic antiquity: but the words used about them seemed curiously contradictory. The Icelander Snorri Sturluson, whose prose account of Norse mythology remains our only half-coherent account, was aware of both \x{2018}Light-elves\x{2019} (ljos\x{e1}lfar) and \x{2018}Dark-elves\x{2019} (d\x{f6}kk\x{e1}lfar), but he also recognized \x{2018}Swart-elves\x{2019} (svart\x{e1}lfar), though the place they lived, \x{2018}Swart-elf-home\x{2019} (Svart\x{e1}lfaheim) was also the home of the dwarves. Meanwhile Old English uses words like \x{2018}Wood-elf\x{2019} (wudu\x{e6}lf) and \x{2018}Water-elf (w\x{e6}ter\x{e6}lf). How are all these fragments to be fitted together? Are \x{2018}Swart-elves\x{2019} the same as \x{2018}Dark-elves\x{2019}, and both perhaps the same as dwarves? The OED seems to accept this solution, cross-referring \x{2018}dwarf\x{2019} and \x{2018}elf\x{2019} rather vaguely to each other, but it is a feeble notion. Early accounts distinguish the two species from each other perfectly clearly, the dwarves being associated with mining, smithcraft, and a world underground, the elves with beauty, allure, dancing, and the woodland. Tolkien\x{2019}s great predecessor, Jacob Grimm, also pondered the problem, but in his Deutsche Mythologie (translated into English in 1884 as Teutonic Mythology) could come to no conclusion, ending another rather vague discussion with the once-more feeble remark that maybe \x{2018}Dark-elves\x{2019} were sort of in between \x{2018}Light-elves\x{2019} and \x{2018}Swart-elves\x{2019}, \x{2018}not so much downright black, as dim, dingy\x{2019}.

The academic works are considered briefly below, but one may say even more briefly here that apart from the collaborative 1925 edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (which probably got him his first Oxford Chair), and the admittedly groundbreaking and field-defining essay on Beowulf eleven years later, Tolkien published less academically than most of his colleagues, and especially little after <<about 1940|18:0>>. From an early period, though, he had kept on publishing individual poems, sometimes pseudonymously, and nearly always in relatively obscure locations \x{2013} college and university magazines, small or privately-printed collections. A list of these is given in Humphrey Carpenter\x{2019}s Biography, and extended in Hammond and Anderson\x{2019}s Bibliography. The count comes to about thirty, though the exact total may vary depending on how one deals with Tolkien\x{2019}s habit of reprinting poems in different places, but also rewriting them more or less extensively. The count further excludes both his contributions to the 1936 collection (again privately-printed and little-circulated) Songs for the Philologists, and the sixteen poems in the 1962 collection The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, nearly all of them reprints or rewritings, as also the many poems in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (themselves in their turn often rewritings).",

In particular he has a house, a garden, many visitors, and an annoying neighbour, Mr Parish. What, one has to wonder, if one accepts that this story is in fact an allegory, and therefore dependent on the making of equations (see pp. 162-4 above), are these supposed to represent? A good deal fits together if one remembers the particular circumstances of Tolkien\x{2019}s job. He was a Professor, and an Oxford Professor. The capital letter is significant, for (as is not the case in the USA), not all faculty members at Oxford University were or are Professors: indeed few of them are, and even fewer in Tolkien\x{2019}s time. A Professor is the holder of a University Chair, and in Tolkien\x{2019}s time the English Faculty at Oxford had precisely three of them, the Rawlinson and Bosworth Chair of Anglo-Saxon which Tolkien held from 1925 to 1945, and the two Merton Chairs, by convention one for literature and one for language, the latter of which Tolkien held from <<1945|9c:1>> till his retirement in 1959. These three Chairs are valuable and (it is fair to say) coveted by the very much larger number of college fellows and university lecturers \x{2013} in Tolkien\x{2019}s day some thirty or forty \x{2013} who compete for them. (One might note that C.S. Lewis, despite the distinction of his scholarship, was one of the thirty or forty who never got one at Oxford, moving to Cambridge to take one up in 1954 when he was fifty-five.) The Chairs are valuable primarily because they are University appointments, not college appointments, and release their holders from the very time-consuming task of responsibility for providing undergraduate tutorials in colleges (in my day, some twelve to sixteen teaching hours a week). In return for this relative freedom Chairs are required to give a certain number of open lectures for undergraduates (Carpenter\x{2019}s Biography says thirty-six a year, which I think should be thirty-five, five sets of seven), to teach graduate students (there were relatively few of these in Tolkien\x{2019}s time), but above all to advance scholarship in their subject-areas, primarily by publication.",

            "Tolkien may well have felt increasingly uneasy about this. By <<1939|9n:0>>, when \x{2018}Leaf by Niggle\x{2019} was written, he had had two major academic \x{2018}hits\x{2019}, as said above, in the 1925 Gawain edition and the 1936 Beowulf lecture \x{2013} and that is two more than most academics ever manage, and bears comparison with most Professors. But they were not being followed up: the projected Pearl edition appeared without his name on it (see p. 197 above), and the only sequel to the Beowulf lecture was the posthumous Finn and Hengest edition (and in a way the edition of the Old English poem Exodus, also appearing only posthumously, in 1981). Furthermore Tolkien had made a very considerable mark on Middle English studies with a 1929 article on the dialect of a group of early texts from Herefordshire (another of his favourite West Midland counties). He was certainly expected to follow this up with a major book-length study, or sequence of studies, but did not do so. His edition of one of the texts, Ancrene Wisse, did appear in 1962, after he had retired, but it is only a transcript: no notes, no glossary, and an introduction written by another scholar. Tolkien could have framed a defence against accusations of misuse of his time and favoured Professorial position. Carpenter\x{2019}s Biography points out that in his second year as Professor, Tolkien gave not thirty-six \x{2018}lectures and classes\x{2019} but \x{2018}one hundred and thirty-six\x{2019}, though that is still not a heavy teaching load. More significantly, Tolkien had several students and collaborators like Mary Salu and Simone D\x{2019}Ardenne who were extremely grateful to him and who continued his work, especially on the Herefordshire texts. Just the same, the accusations were certainly being made, if not in 1940, then before many years had passed. One hears an echo of them in J.I.M.
