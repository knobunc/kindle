            "There is a peculiar joy in writing about children for children. One naturally goes back to one\x{2019}s own childhood to find things. To me, the astonishing thing is in the way one took life during those years. It was as though a thin, but tough, membrane had not yet grown between oneself and the rest of the world. A child sees everything sharp and radiant; each object with its shadow beside it. Happiness is more truly happiness than it will ever be again, and is caused by such little things. The first day of spring, for instance, when it was warm enough to go without a coat; or the time you stayed up till <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and someone showed you Scorpio, and the Pleiades, and Cassiopeia\x{2019}s Chair. Happiness came from the smell of a Christmas tree, or roast chicken on Sunday; it came from the first snowfall of the season, or learning to hang by your knees from a trapeze, or going barefoot in summer. I remember very well the glow of magic that illuminated the world for months after my mother had taken me to see Pavlowa dance; I remember the moment when my grandmother opened a book, and began to read me the first chapter of a story called Treasure Island.",
