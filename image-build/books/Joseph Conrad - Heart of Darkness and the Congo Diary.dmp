            "\x{2018}Heart of Darkness,\x{2019} to present its theme bluntly, is an impression, taken from life, of the conquest by the European whites of a certain portion of Africa, an impression in particular of the civilising methods of a certain great European Trading Company face to face with the \x{2018}nigger.\x{2019} We say this much because the English reader likes to know where he is going before he takes art seriously, and we add that he will find the human life, black and white, in \x{2018}Heart of Darkness\x{2019} an uncommonly and uncannily serious affair. If the ordinary reader, however, insists on taking the subject of a tale very seriously, the artist takes his method of presentation more seriously still, and rightly so. For the art of \x{2018}Heart of Darkness\x{2019}\x{2014}as in every psychological masterpiece\x{2014}lies in the relation of the things of the spirit to the things of the flesh, of the invisible life to the visible, of the sub-conscious life within us, our obscure motives and instincts, to our conscious actions, feelings and outlook. Just as landscape art implies the artist catching the exact relation of a tree to the earth from which it springs, and of the earth to the sky, so the art of \x{2018}Heart of Darkness\x{2019} implies the catching of infinite shades of the white man\x{2019}s uneasy, disconcerted, and fantastic relations with the exploited barbarism of Africa; it implies the acutest analysis of the deterioration of the white man\x{2019}s morale, when he is let loose from European restraint, and planted down in the tropics as an \x{2018}emissary of light\x{2019} armed to the teeth, to make trade profits out of the \x{2018}subject races.\x{2019} The weirdness, the brilliance, the psychological truth of this masterly analysis of two Continents in conflict, of the abysmal gulf between the white man\x{2019}s system and the black man\x{2019}s comprehension of its results, is conveyed in a rapidly rushing narrative which calls for close attention on the reader\x{2019}s part. But the attention once surrendered, the pages of the narrative are as enthralling as the pages of Dostoevsky\x{2019}s Crime and Punishment. The stillness of the sombre African forests, the glare of sunshine, the feeling of dawn, of <<noon|13>>, of night on the tropical rivers, the isolation of the unnerved, degenerating whites staring all day and every day at the Heart of Darkness which is alike meaningless and threatening to their own creed and conceptions of life, the helpless bewilderment of the unhappy savages in the grasp of their flabby and rapacious conquerors\x{2014}all this is a page torn from the life of the Dark Continent\x{2014}a page which has been hitherto carefully blurred and kept away from European eyes. There is no \x{2018}intention\x{2019} in the story, no parti pris, no prejudice one way or the other; it is simply a piece of art, fascinating and remorseless, and the artist is but intent on presenting his sensations in that sequence and arrangement whereby the meaning or the meaninglessness of the white man in uncivilised Africa can be felt in its really significant aspects. If the story is too strong meat for the ordinary reader, let him turn to \x{2018}Youth,\x{2019} wherein the song of every man\x{2019}s youth is indeed sung. [\x{2026}] Mr. Conrad is easily among the first writers of to-day. His special individual gift, as an artist, is of so placing a whole scene before the reader that the air, the landscape, the moving people, the houses on the quays, the ships in the harbour, the sounds, the scents, the voices in the air, all fuse in the perfect and dream-like illusion of an unforgettable reality.",

While I stood horror-struck, one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards the river to drink.

            "\x{201c}Towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz\x{2019}s station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we were till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in daylight\x{2014}not at dusk, or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight miles meant nearly three hours\x{2019} steaming for us, and I could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably too, since one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we had plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep\x{2014}it seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself of being deaf\x{2014}then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as well. <<About three in the morning|9h>> some large fish leaped, and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round you like something solid. At <<eight|9t:1>> or <<nine|20a:1>>, perhaps, it lifted as a shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it\x{2014}all perfectly still\x{2014}and then the white shutter came down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A complaining clamour, modulated in savage discords, filled our ears. The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I don\x{2019}t know how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short, leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. \x{2018}Good God! What is the meaning\x{2014}\x{2014}?\x{2019} stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims\x{2014}a little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore side-spring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. Two others remained open-mouthed a whole minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters12 at \x{2018}ready\x{2019} in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around her\x{2014}and that was all. The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind.",

            "\x{201c}I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie,\x{201d} he began suddenly. \x{201c}Girl! What? Did I mention a girl? Oh, she is out of it\x{2014}completely. They\x{2014}the women I mean\x{2014}are out of it\x{2014}should be out of it. We must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours gets worse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr Kurtz saying, \x{2018}My Intended.\x{2019} You would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the lofty frontal bone of Mr Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing19 sometimes, but this\x{2014}ah\x{2014}specimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had patted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball\x{2014}an ivory ball; it had caressed him, and\x{2014}lo!\x{2014}he had withered; it had taken him, loved him, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite. Ivory? I should think so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting with it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above or below ground in the whole country. \x{2018}Mostly fossil,\x{2019} the manager had remarked disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they call it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury the tusks sometimes\x{2014}but evidently they couldn\x{2019}t bury this parcel deep enough to save the gifted Mr Kurtz from his fate. We filled the steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. Thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this favour had remained with him to the last. You should have heard him say, \x{2018}My ivory.\x{2019} Oh yes, I heard him. \x{2018}My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my\x{2014}\x{2014}\x{2019} Everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything belonged to him\x{2014}but that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. That was the reflection that made you creepy all over. It was impossible\x{2014}it was not good for one either\x{2014}trying to imagine. He had taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land\x{2014}I mean literally. You can\x{2019}t understand. How could you?\x{2014}with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums\x{2014}how can you imagine what particular region of the first ages a man\x{2019}s untrammelled feet may take him into by the way of solitude\x{2014}utter solitude without a policeman\x{2014}by the way of silence\x{2014}utter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public opinion? These little things make all the great difference. When they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrong\x{2014}too dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil: the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too much of a devil\x{2014}I don\x{2019}t know which. Or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds. Then the earth for you is only a standing place\x{2014}and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain I won\x{2019}t pretend to say. But most of us are neither one nor the other. The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with smells too, by Jove!\x{2014}breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be contaminated.e10 And there, don\x{2019}t you see? your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in\x{2014}your power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And that\x{2019}s difficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explain\x{2014}I am trying to account to myself for\x{2014}for\x{2014}Mr Kurtz\x{2014}for the shade of Mr Kurtz. This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether. This was because it could speak English to me. The original Kurtz had been educated partly in England, and\x{2014}as he was good enough to say himself\x{2014}his sympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his father was half-French.20 All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz; and by and bye I learned that, most appropriately, the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs21 had entrusted him with the making of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it too. I\x{2019}ve seen it. I\x{2019}ve read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for! But this must have been before his\x{2014}let us say\x{2014}nerves, went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain <<midnight|13>> dances ending with unspeakable rites, which\x{2014}as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I heard at various times\x{2014}were offered up to him\x{2014}do you understand?\x{2014}to Mr Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece of writing. The opening paragraph, however, in the light of later information, strikes me now as ominous. He began with the argument that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, \x{2018}must necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural beings\x{2014}we approach them with the might as of a deity,\x{2019} and so on, and so on. \x{2018}By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded,\x{2019} etc., etc.e11 From that point he soared and took me with him. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember, you know. It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the unbounded power of eloquence\x{2014}of words\x{2014}of burning noble words. There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases, unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: \x{2018}Exterminate all the brutes!\x{2019}22 The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of \x{2018}my pamphlet\x{2019} (he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career. I had full information about all these things, and, besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. I\x{2019}ve done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst all the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of civilisation. But then, you see, I can\x{2019}t choose. He won\x{2019}t be forgotten. Whatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his honour; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings:e12 he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking. No; I can\x{2019}t forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I missed my late helmsman awfully\x{2014}I missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black Sahara. Well, don\x{2019}t you see, he had done something, he had steered; for months I had him at my back\x{2014}a help\x{2014}an instrument. It was a kind of partnership. He steered for me\x{2014}I had to look after him, I worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory\x{2014}like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment.",

            "\x{201c}On the contrary. It appears their intercourse had been very much broken by various causes. He had, as he informed me proudly, managed to nurse Kurtz through two illnesses (he alluded to it as you would to some risky feat), but as a rule Kurtz wandered alone, far in the depths of the forest. \x{2018}Very often coming to this station, I had to wait days and days before he would turn up,\x{2019} he said. \x{2018}Ah, it was worth waiting for!\x{2014}sometimes.\x{2019} \x{2018}What was he doing? exploring or what?\x{2019} I asked. \x{2018}Oh yes, of course\x{2019}; he had discovered lots of villages, a lake too\x{2014}he did not know exactly in what direction; it was dangerous to inquire too much\x{2014}but mostly his expeditions had been for ivory. \x{2018}But he had no goods to trade with by that time,\x{2019} I objected. \x{2018}There\x{2019}s a good lot of cartridges left even yet,\x{2019} he answered, looking away. \x{2018}To speak plainly, he raided the country,\x{2019} I said. He nodded. \x{2018}Not alone, surely!\x{2019} He muttered something about the villages round that lake. \x{2018}Kurtz got the tribe to follow him, did he?\x{2019} I suggested. He fidgeted a little. \x{2018}They adored him,\x{2019} he said. The tone of these words was so extraordinary that I looked at him searchingly. It was curious to see his mingled eagerness and reluctance to speak of Kurtz. The man filled his life, occupied his thoughts, swayed his emotions. \x{2018}What can you expect?\x{2019} he burst out; \x{2018}he came to them with thunder and lightning, you know\x{2014}and they had never seen anything like it\x{2014}and very terrible.e1 He could be very terrible. You can\x{2019}t judge Mr Kurtz as you would an ordinary man. No, no, no! Now\x{2014}just to give you an idea\x{2014}I don\x{2019}t mind telling you, he wanted to shoot me too one day\x{2014}but I don\x{2019}t judge him.\x{2019} \x{2018}Shoot you!\x{2019} I cried. \x{2018}What for?\x{2019} \x{2018}Well, I had a small lot of ivory the chief of that village near my house gave me. You see I used to shoot game for them. Well, he wanted it, and wouldn\x{2019}t hear reason. He declared he would shoot me unless I gave him the ivory and then cleared out of the country, because he could do so, and had a fancy for it, and there was nothing on earth to prevent him killing whom he jolly well pleased. And it was true too. I gave him the ivory. What did I care! But I didn\x{2019}t clear out. No, no. I couldn\x{2019}t leave him. I had to be careful, of course, till we got friendly again for a time. He had his second illness then. Afterwards I had to keep out of the way; but I didn\x{2019}t mind. He was living for the most part in those villages on the lake. When he came down to the river, sometimes he would talk to me, and sometimes it was better for me to be careful. This man suffered too much. He hated all this, and somehow he couldn\x{2019}t get away. When I had a chance I begged him to try and leave while there was time; I offered to go back with him. And he would say yes, and then he would remain; go off on another ivory hunt; disappear for weeks; forget himself amongst these people\x{2014}forget himself\x{2014}you know.\x{2019} \x{2018}Why! he\x{2019}s mad,\x{2019} I said. He protested indignantly. Mr Kurtz couldn\x{2019}t be mad. If I had heard him talk, only two days ago, I wouldn\x{2019}t dare hint at such a thing\x{2026}. I had taken up my binoculars while we talked, and was looking at the shore, sweeping the limit of the forest at each side and at the back of the house. The consciousness of there being people in that bush, so silent, so quiet\x{2014}as silent and quiet as the ruined house on the hill\x{2014}made me uneasy. There was no sign on the face of nature of this amazing tale that was not so much told as suggested to me in desolate exclamations, completed by shrugs, in interrupted phrases, in hints ending in deep sighs. The woods were unmoved, like a mask\x{2014}heavy, like the closed door of a prison\x{2014}they looked with their air of hidden knowledge, of patient expectation, of unapproachable silence. The Russian was explaining to me that it was only lately that Mr Kurtz had come down to the river, bringing along with him all the fighting men of that lake tribe. He had been absent for several months\x{2014}getting himself adored, I suppose\x{2014}and had come down unexpectedly, with the intention to all appearance of making a raid either across the river or down stream. Evidently the appetite for more ivory had got the better of the\x{2014}what shall I say?\x{2014}less material aspirations. However he had got much worse suddenly. \x{2018}I heard he was lying here helpless, and so I came up\x{2014}took my chance,\x{2019} said the Russian. \x{2018}Oh, he is bad, very bad.\x{2019} I directed my glass to the house. There were no signs of life, but there was the ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with three little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all this brought within reach of my hand, as it were. And then I made a brusque movement, and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field of my glass. You remember I told you I had been struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place. Now I had suddenly a nearer view, and its first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow. Then I went carefully from post to post with my glass, and I saw my mistake. These round knobs were not ornamental but symbolic; they were expressive and puzzling, striking and disturbing\x{2014}food for thought and also for the vultures if there had been any looking down from the sky; but at all events for such ants as were industrious enough to ascend the pole. They would have been even more impressive, those heads on the stakes,1 if their faces had not been turned to the house. Only <<one|9k:0>>, the first I had made out, was facing my way. I was not so shocked as you may think. The start back I had given was really nothing but a movement of surprise. I had expected to see a knob of wood there, you know. I returned deliberately to the first I had seen\x{2014}and there it was, black, dried, sunken, with closed eyelids\x{2014}a head that seemed to sleep at the top of that pole, and, with the shrunken dry lips showing a narrow white line of the teeth, was smiling too, smiling continuously at some endless and jocose dream of that eternal slumber.",

On the hill a big fire burned, illuminating fitfully a crooked corner of the station-house. One of the agents with a picket of a few of our blacks, armed for the purpose, was keeping guard over the ivory; but deep within the forest, red gleams that wavered, that seemed to sink and rise from the ground amongst confused columnar shapes of intense blackness, showed the exact position of the camp where Mr Kurtz\x{2019}s adorers were keeping their uneasy vigil. The monotonous beating of a big drum filled the air with muffled shocks and a lingering vibration. A steady droning sound of many men chanting each to himself some weird incantation came out from the black, flat wall of the woods as the humming of bees comes out of a hive, and had a strange narcotic effect upon my half-awake senses. I believe I dozed off leaning over the rail, till an abrupt burst of yells, an overwhelming outbreak of a pent-up and mysterious frenzy, woke me up in a bewildered wonder. It was cut short all at once, and the low droning went on with an effect of audible and soothing silence. I glanced casually into the little cabin. A light was burning within, but Mr Kurtz was not there.",

I steamed up a bit, then swung down-stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping, fiery river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air.e6 In front of the first rank, along the river, three men, plastered with bright red earth from head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly. When we came abreast again, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned heads, swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendant tail\x{2014}something that looked like a dried gourd; they shouted periodically together strings of amazing words that resembled no sounds of human language; and the deep murmurs of the crowd, interrupted suddenly, were like the responses of some satanic litany.",

His first novels, Almayer\x{2019}s Folly (1895) and An Outcast of the Islands (1896), were immediately hailed as the work of a significant new talent. He produced his major fiction from about 1897 to 1911, a period that saw the publication of The Nigger of the \x{2018}Narcissus\x{2019} (1897), Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900), and the political novels Nostromo (1904), The Secret Agent (1907), and Under Western Eyes (1911). Considered \x{201c}difficult,\x{201d} his writing received considerable critical acclaim, but not until <<1914|18:0>> after the appearance of Chance did it win a wide public. The dazzling narrative experiments and thematic complexities of Conrad\x{2019}s earlier fiction are largely absent from his later writings, which are pitched to a more popular audience.",
