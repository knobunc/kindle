She made sure to pack lots of hairpins, as they had always had a way of playing hide-and-seek with her, and she knew that if this happened in a foreign country it would undermine her mood. She packed shoes, and gloves, and underwear (silk, she thought, would not gather dust, nor conduct changes in temperature), and a nightdress and dressing gown, and slippers as well, and toiletries of all sorts, and a sewing case for necessary repairs along the way, and a traveling inkstand for the writing she planned to do, and a supply of books and paper. For colder weather she packed a heavy wool overcoat and a travel rug to wrap herself in while aboard ships and trains; for wet weather, a pair of rubber overshoes and an umbrella.

The waiters ladled out the soup; Bly discovered that she had an overwhelming desire not to see, smell, or taste food at least until they had reached land. The passengers began to introduce themselves. To Bly\x{2019}s embarrassment, the others at the table turned out to be old hands at ocean crossings, and she thought she saw indulgent smiles on all their faces when, feeling another attack coming on, she put a handkerchief over her mouth and did her best to excuse herself politely from the table. \x{201c}Miss Bly,\x{201d} said Captain Albers, \x{201c}you must come back every time.\x{201d} One of the stewards helped her to a secluded spot on the deck, where again she was sick. Back inside the dining room, she was greeted with a hearty round of congratulations for her fortitude\x{2014}\x{201c}The only way to conquer seasickness is by forcing oneself to eat,\x{201d} the captain noted approvingly\x{2014}but the bravos of her tablemates only made her more conscious of her precarious condition, and when the fish course was placed before her she felt her stomach start to turn, and, choking behind her handkerchief, she was forced to excuse herself to the deck for a second time.",

For sheer luxury the meals rivaled anything to be found at Delmonico\x{2019}s or the Brunswick, the dishes prepared in the ornate style of the period, strongly French in influence and often named for generals and heads of state. A typical bill of fare for a dinner served on one of the oceangoing steamships of the period offered choices from twenty-nine separate dishes in nine courses, literally from soup to nuts. There was turtle soup to start, and blanquettes de poulet aux champignons, and filets de boeuf \x{e0} la Bordelaise, and saddle of mutton with jelly, and ham in champagne sauce, and roast turkey with truffles, and pommes de terre Duchesse, and Marlborough pudding, and a great deal more, ending with a selection of fruits and nuts served with the caf\x{e9} noir.

A near battalion of uniformed household staff was in constant attendance, cooks and stewards and laundresses and chambermaids, transforming the modern steamship, in the much-used phrase of the day, into a floating palace, where guests could live for a week like royalty, with servants who appeared at the press of an ivory button, with a perpetually groaning board, a well-stocked library and an equally well-stocked bar, and a band of ready musicians: all of it helping to divert attention from the dark, churning water outside, from the too-real prospect of lurking icebergs, from the very absurdity of the notion, if one dwelled on it too long, of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a boat.",

            "At precisely <<12:55 A.M.|2a>>, Cyclone Bill pulled out the throttle and the train lurched into motion. Using every pound of steam the engine could handle, the train climbed the eastern slope of the Wasatch mountain range, its speed increasing as it neared the summit, where it paused momentarily and then, with a stomach-lurching plunge, began its race downhill. The train careened wildly around the mountain passes, swept across plateaus, shot through tunnel after tunnel, going faster and faster; still the engineer did not ease up on the throttle. The local superintendent for the Railway Mail Service, James E. White, tried to joke that Downing was straightening out all the curves on the line, but there was no laughter in the car. Someone murmured that it would be a terrible thing to run off the track. No one said anything to that\x{2014}derailments happened more often than anyone in the car cared to think about, and particularly at high rates of speed. An isolated mountain pass late at night, it didn\x{2019}t need saying, would be the worst possible place to derail. To Elizabeth Bisland the train felt like a runaway horse; one of the reporters compared it to \x{201c}some insane monster striving to free himself.\x{201d} Its roar reverberated like a cannonade off the rocky sides of the canyons. At Devil\x{2019}s Gate, where the track was not as crooked, the train seemed, impossibly, to pick up speed. The car rocked side to side like a ship in a storm, and some of the passengers actually became seasick, turning, in their urgency, to the nearby cuspidors. The warm, crowded car took on an unpleasant aroma. One man began to writhe on the floor in terror and was handed a flask of brandy to calm himself. From the rear platform of the car the passengers could see a shower of sparks trailing behind them; the tracks looked like two lines of fire in the night. \x{201c}The telegraph poles,\x{201d} Bisland wrote, \x{201c}reeled backwards from our course and the land fled from under us with horrible nightmare weirdness.\x{201d} She was not sick, but she could feel her nerves beginning to give way. Everyone sitting down held tight to the armrests; those who had mistakenly imagined they might sleep clutched the sides of their berths to keep from falling out. The train passed into the longest tunnel on the road, more than seven hundred feet cut out of hard red clay and sandstone; for endless seconds the blackness outside the windows seemed to grow still blacker. Just beyond the tunnel was the approach to Echo Canyon, where the declivity was 250 feet per mile and the road was said to be as crooked as a ram\x{2019}s horn. Here the tracks hugged close to the hillsides, running along a narrow strip of earth high above the canyon. They could hear the steel wheels grinding on the curves; behind them the double stream of fire was almost continuous. James White got up to check the speed indicator that had been installed in the car and gasped at what he read there. Incredibly, a mile through Echo Canyon had been run in fifty-two seconds. Ahead lay an even more treacherous bit of road, the reverse loop at Antelope Gap. The train hit the first curve at full speed, and as it did, one side of the car was lifted into the air, so that only one set of wheels still clung to the tracks; there was an awful moment of suspense and then the car managed to right itself, the wheels landing down with a bump, before the train hit the reverse turn and the other set of wheels went up. Finally General Manager Edward Dickinson could take no more. \x{201c}Let the schedule go!\x{201d} he shouted to C. E. Brown, the Union Pacific press agent. \x{201c}Pull the bell rope, Brown, then run forward and tell Downing to stop this if he wants us to reach Ogden alive.\x{201d}",

            "Indeed, time itself had been forever changed by the railroads. Until the latter decades of the nineteenth century, communities had the power to establish their own time zones in what was known as \x{201c}local mean time,\x{201d} determined by the position of the sun as it passed overhead. The state of Illinois contained twenty-seven different time zones, Wisconsin thirty-eight. In Pittsburgh the train station had six clocks, and each one showed a different time. When a clock struck <<noon|11>> in Washington, D.C., the time was <<12:08|2>> in Philadelphia, <<12:12|2>> in New York, and <<12:24|2>> in Boston. Local mean time was a perfectly fine standard when a day\x{2019}s travel brought one only to a nearby town, but far less so when trains could cover a mile in a single minute and railroad companies operated in several states at once. The B&O Railroad, for instance, ran its eastern trains by Baltimore time, its Ohio trains by Columbus time, and those out west by the time of Vincennes, Indiana. Trains were moving at speeds never before seen, with the ever-present risk of catastrophe if one collided with another, and the widespread confusion about the exact times of arrivals and departures was, if nothing else, a major safety issue (particularly as railroads frequently ran trains in opposite directions on the same stretch of track). In October 1883, representatives of the largest railroad companies met at a General Time Convention in Chicago, at which it was decided to divide the country into four time zones, corresponding to the mean sun time at the meridians near Philadelphia, Memphis, Denver, and Fresno. This action had been taken without the consent of the president, the Congress, or the courts, but almost immediately it became the de facto law of the land. On Sunday, November 18, 1883, clocks across the country were changed to the new railroad standard; that Sunday became known as \x{201c}the day of two noons.\x{201d} Local mean time was gone; now everyone was living by railroad time. As one Indianapolis newspaper observed in a widely quoted editorial: \x{201c}People will have to marry by railroad time, and die by railroad time. Ministers will be required to preach by railroad time, banks will open and close by railroad time; in fact the Railroad Convention has taken charge of the time business, and the people may as well set about adjusting their affairs in accordance with its decree.\x{201d}",

The sky had now grown cloudy, the light filtered and low across the horizon. She opened the window wider and was startled to see the distinctive spreading canopy of live oaks, unexpected but absolutely unmistakable, and wonderfully reminiscent of her home places of Louisiana and Mississippi. The western edge of America seemed almost to be echoing the eastern, another sign that her cross-country journey was nearing its end. Just after breakfast the train rolled into the Oakland Mole, a pier built fully two miles out into the bay, where the train passengers boarded the ferry to San Francisco. The boat made its way through the choppy waters of the bay toward the narrower strait of the Golden Gate, passing the lighthouse at Alcatraz, the Army barracks of Angel Island, the island itself ringed by cannons. Through the rain and the mist San Francisco rose into view, a vision in white, lines of elegant frame houses spread out over the steep hills, broad streets running up and down between them. Just ahead was the ferry house at the foot of Market Street, a low wooden building on which stood a single clock tower. At a <<quarter past nine|10>> on Tuesday, November 19, the ferry bumped up against the San Francisco wharf: Elizabeth Bisland had traveled coast to coast in only four days, fifteen hours, and fifteen minutes. The mail, too, had arrived on time, and the railroad officials cheered and clasped hands in jubilation and then went to deliver their statements to the reporters. Bisland made her way to the terminal, through the rain and the oozing mud, feeling great pleasure in walking with long strides and swinging arms after days of confinement on the train, delighted to be rid of the roar of the engine in her ears.',

Ever the English empiricist, Fogg wagers twenty thousand pounds\x{2014}half his fortune\x{2014}that he can complete the trip in eighty days or less (\x{201c}i.e., in 1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes,\x{201d} he elucidates mathematically).

            "The novel contains several subplots; <<one|9k:0>>, for instance, involves the pursuit of Fogg around the world by a detective named Fix (who mistakenly believes that Fogg is fleeing the country after robbing a bank of fifty-five thousand pounds), and another the rescue of a widowed Indian princess named Aouda, the intended victim of suttee at her husband\x{2019}s funeral, who will remain with Fogg and Passepartout for the remainder of the trip. (Aouda eventually becomes Fogg\x{2019}s wife, making him, the narrator reports, \x{201c}the happiest of men.\x{201d}) But the heart of Around the World in Eighty Days is the contest between time and distance: Phileas Fogg\x{2019}s quest to maintain his rigidly plotted-out schedule as the clock grinds relentlessly on. Fogg is a literary expression of the solid Victorian virtues: he is honest, he is rational, he is patriotic, he is courageous, he is chaste. More than anything, though, he is unflappable, and much of the pleasure of the book comes from watching him maintain his composure in the face of the seemingly insuperable obstacles that Verne places in his path. When there turns out to be a fifty-mile break in the Indian railway, Fogg finds an elephant to carry them on to Allahabad; when Fogg and Passepartout are arrested on a trumped-up charge in Calcutta and sentenced to seven days in jail, he pays the \x{a3}2,000 bail (equivalent to nearly a quarter of a million dollars today) so that they are not late for their China Sea steamship; when a Sioux attack in Nebraska causes them to miss their train, Fogg and the others set out on a sail-borne sled speeding along the railroad tracks to Omaha. When the merchant steamer they have hired runs out of coal before reaching Liverpool, Fogg calmly purchases the ship from its owner and orders that its upper works be hacked apart and the wood used for fuel; eventually the cabins, the masts, the rails, and most of the deck find their way into the furnace, and by the time the ship reaches port it is little more than a floating iron hull.",

            "Indeed, though later Verne would complain that he had received much less than his fair share for the play, and moreover that he had sold the novel for \x{201c}a tenth of its value,\x{201d} it was his tale of the circumnavigator Phileas Fogg that finally secured his fortune, and transformed him from a popular adventure novelist into a literary celebrity, an author who could no longer stroll unnoticed amid the Parisian crowds, whose name appeared in society columns and who was deluged with love letters containing locks of his female admirers\x{2019} hair. Verne already owned a yacht, the Saint-Michel, but now he traded it in for a new, larger one, and then another (Saint-Michel II and III), on which he made tours of northern Africa and Scandinavia. The boat was one of his few indulgences; the mansion in the northern city of Amiens had been purchased at the behest of his wife, who enjoyed far more than he did the bourgeois life of the French provincial city. Verne\x{2019}s own daily routine was near monastic: he slept where he worked, in his little study decorated only with busts of Shakespeare and Moli\x{e8}re and a watercolor of the Saint-Michel on the wall. Each morning at <<five o\x{2019}clock|6>> he rose from his narrow iron bed and sat down at the plain writing desk, where he worked through the morning, stopping only briefly to eat the breakfast that Honorine had placed by the door exactly at <<seven|9c:1>>. He was in bed again by <<eight-thirty|5b>> each night, often having politely excused himself from one of his wife\x{2019}s many social engagements. And so the novels kept coming, sometimes at a rate of two per year. In 1886 Verne\x{2019}s brilliant but mentally ill nephew unaccountably shot him; he was hit twice, one of the bullets lodging in his ankle. Surgeons were unable to remove the bullet, and for the rest of his life Verne walked with a limp and often suffered a good deal of pain. No longer was he able to sail his yacht; now, as he had promised his mother long before, he could travel only in imagination. The next year he entered local politics, winning a seat on the Amiens city council as a member of the Radical Republican party (both politically and theologically he was a thoroughgoing nonconformist), a position to which he would be re-elected three times.",

This warmly furnished sitting room was where, in the evenings, Honorine entertained guests in whom her husband had no interest, where she had given interviews to journalists that ended up embarrassing or upsetting him, as, for instance, when she pointed out how few women characters he had included in his books. Over time it had become clear to him that she did not understand his literary ambitions. At <<eleven|9m:1>> each morning they had lunch together in the small breakfast room next to the kitchen, usually eating in silence while Jules brooded about his latest book. He was increasingly withdrawn; his wife frequently burst into tears, often for reasons he did not comprehend. She resented that he did not like to take her into Amiens society, and complained to friends that \x{201c}he piles the problems produced by his discouragement onto me.\x{201d} Always on Sundays she wanted him to accompany her to Mass; he had gone at first to appease her and then, after a while, he gave it up for good.

Upstairs, above the frail-looking balconies, windowsills held jars of chrysanthemums, the blossoms yellow and ragged around the edges like old newspaper. An off-duty detective had been enlisted to show them some of the sights; he led them down rickety, greasy stairs through back corridors hidden from the street, past open doorways that revealed steaming restaurant kitchens where white-aproned cooks barked and cackled at each other, their pots hissing on the stove. Old men squatted on their heels smoking cigarettes. The night air was chill and damp, rank with mysterious, vaguely suggestive smells that seemed to emanate from every grate and doorway.

Crowds streamed around the line of jinrikishas; from everywhere came the clacking of wooden clogs.

In the residential areas the houses were long and low, made of wood or bamboo with tiled roofs; from the eaves hung soft bubbles of tinted light, lanterns of every shape and size.

Later she would write in an essay for female travelers, \x{201c}If one refuses to adapt one\x{2019}s self to this custom, and insists upon doing in Rome as the Americans do, the result will be a feeling of great exhaustion after dressing that robs one of appetite for breakfast and spoils the day.\x{201d} She could spend hours at a time on one of the ship\x{2019}s bamboo lounging chairs, with perhaps a book or some sewing in her lap, watching the sea quiver under the blinding sky.

An hour later the ship was steaming along the palm-fringed coast when up on deck Elizabeth Bisland heard a sudden cry and the sounds of a struggle. She caught a glimpse of the naked back of a young Chinese man with hands manacled behind him; the man tried to wrest himself from a sailor\x{2019}s grip, and then suddenly, shockingly, he darted to the side of the ship and threw himself overboard. He was a Chinese prisoner, Bisland learned, convicted of forgery, who was being transported to Penang to face the punishment of the native authorities. (In Penang\x{2019}s prisons inmates received no food, and had to depend on the charity of loved ones to keep from starving to death. \x{201c}If I feed them,\x{201d} the local sultan was said to have remarked, \x{201c}my whole country will want to go to jail.\x{201d}) Almost as soon as the prisoner plunged into the sea the ship\x{2019}s engines were reversed and a life buoy thrown overboard, but he did not reappear. Long seconds ticked by, the Thames\x{2019}s crew scanning the horizon like seamen on a whaler watching for the telltale plume of spray. Finally a cry went up: in the distance one of the sailors had seen the faint outline of a head bobbing up from the surface and moving rapidly toward the shoreline some four miles in the distance. Evidently the prisoner was a very strong swimmer, and something of a magician besides, for he had managed, while in the water, to slip his handcuffs. A lifeboat full of cheering Lascar sailors, under the command of a \x{201c}calm and dominant\x{201d} third officer, was lowered into the water and sent out in pursuit. The sailors rowed in unison, their oars cutting through the placid sea; from the deck of the Thames, Bisland watched the dash of the lifeboat slowly converge with the dot of the swimmer. In the distance she could make out some doubling back and forth by the lifeboat, presumably as the officer shouted commands at the man in the water, and then an oar raised menacingly overhead, until at last the fugitive submitted to being pulled into the boat. The trip back to the Thames took a good deal longer than the trip out, lacking, as it did, the thrill of the chase.",

The Powan was a broad white-painted ship with the multiple arcaded decks of an American riverboat, flying the Union Jack and the white St. Andrew\x{2019}s cross of the Hong Kong, Canton & Macao house flag. Bly visited below decks, where hundreds of Chinese passengers shared a single cabin. The room was large and noisy and reeked of the distinctive smell of opium, something like gunpowder and flowers and the sweaty musk of a horse after a run. Thick clouds of gray smoke hung above the passengers who sat cross-legged and crouching on the floor, reading, talking, playing fan-tan, cooking rice, and brewing tea; some of them even managed to stretch out and sleep amid the clamor. Like immigrants in the steerage of transatlantic steamships, the Chinese passengers had to supply their own beds (really little more than bits of straw matting) and their own food as well. An English traveler on the Powan would later write: \x{201c}These ships carry, each trip, from five hundred to two thousand Chinamen, and the monthly circulation between Hongkong and Canton amounts to over one hundred thousand pigtails.

The days on the water were long and, other than the occasional cricket match on the afterdeck, uneventful. The sea rose and fell not in waves, but in steady, almost imperceptible exhalations. Sometimes, toward the end of the day, rosy clouds floated up from the horizon. They were sailing now in the regions that early mapmakers had believed were inhabited by dragons; as far as she could tell, none lurked in these waters, though sometimes a whale surfaced to send up a jet of shining spray, leaving a long green ribbon of wake behind it.

Though the Tanks were the product of unimaginable labor, knowledge of their builders had been lost long ago; the idea for their creation was variously attributed to King Solomon, the Queen of Sheba, the Himyarites, the Phoenicians, the Persians. A broad stone aqueduct conducted rainwater from the surrounding hills down to the cisterns, which were built as a system of terraces so that the overflow from the upper level would fall and be collected by a lower one, and then another, and another; set into the clefts at the foot of the rocks, irregularly shaped masonry bowls stretched enormous thirsty mouths up to the rainless sky. The immense rock wall extended in a sinuous curve, like the belly of some ancient fertility goddess.

The bucket was unloaded into the ship\x{2019}s hold, where trimmers delivered the coal in wheelbarrows to bunkers distributed around the ship, and then, when it was needed for burning, brought it from the bunkers to the fire room, in the lowest depths of the ship.",

In Paris a special train had been arranged to take her the 142 miles to Le Havre; the Western Railroad of France estimated that its chartered train could cover the distance in three hours, about twice as fast as a regular train. If the French Line could be induced to hold La Champagne for even an hour, Bisland would have a real chance of making the connection. Bisland rose from her sleeping berth and dressed quietly, so as not to disturb her fellow passengers; she wrote notes of farewell to those who had been \x{201c}especially courteous\x{201d} and then found her seat in the darkness of the car. At <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>> she was waiting with her veil and gloves on when the train stopped at Villeneuve\x{2013}St. Georges.",

She was already dressed, too confused and jangled to go back to sleep, so there was nothing to do but throw herself down on her seat and wait for the coming of day. When next the sun went down, she told herself, she would be in London. From London it was but a five-hour train ride to Southampton, where she could catch the fast steamship Ems the next day; the Ems was due into New York on January 27, making for an around-the-world trip of just under seventy-four days. Outside the sky slowly turned from black to gray. Here and there a thin plume of smoke curled up against the sky from the chimney of a thatched cottage. Peasants who seemed to have stepped out of a Millet canvas trudged along the road in heavy boots and homespun clothing, carrying sticks or baskets of potatoes and turnips. A cart full of milk jugs was being pulled, incongruously, by a large dog, while a woman wearing a cap and tucked-up skirts walked alongside, blowing on her fingers to keep them warm.',

As she set out on the afternoon ferry the Channel was gray and stormy, the wind brisk, a spatter of rain splashing down every now and again. Some of the passengers, defying the rain, spread themselves out in chaise longues; others turned up the collars of their long coats, thrust their hands in the pockets, and strode along the rolling deck. Later the sun broke through the clouds, turning the sea a stormy gray-green\x{2014}and there before her, appearing through the mists, were the cliffs of Dover. For a moment she stood transfixed, dazzled by the unexpected whiteness of the stone. The chalk cliffs jutted straight up from the water, as solid and immovable as the sea was restless and shifting, grand and dignified as any national monument. Nothing on this trip had moved her quite as much as that sight; it was worth a journey around the world, she told herself, just to have seen it. Two months earlier she had started out from a continent that English people had claimed as their own, where the English language, English laws and customs reigned from sea to sea; as far as she traveled she had heard that same language, seen the same laws, found the same people. Now at last she was seeing the tiny island that had sprung, as she thought of it, this race of kings. \x{201c}It fills my soul with a passion of pride,\x{201d} she wrote, \x{201c}that I, too, am an Anglo-Saxon.\x{201d}",

A reporter from the Paris News Association came to the table to talk to her. Elizabeth Bisland, he would later write, \x{201c}was very much annoyed to learn that the fast steamer, Ems, which she had expected to meet at Southampton for home, had been taken off.

Filmy mists swept across the land like phantoms, the countryside a lush green even in January. It was Sunday now, she realized, watching the peasants tramp the muddy roads to church. These were faces, broad and ruddy, that she recognized from back home. She gazed at the sturdy young men, wondering idly how soon they would be mayors in New York or aldermen in Chicago, at the girls in their bunchy provincial dresses, whose daughters might someday be Washington society ladies wearing gowns made by Worth. The train kept up its incessant rattle. She tried reading one of her books, but the words danced on the page. Her hunger was making it difficult to concentrate. She had not eaten since the previous morning in Calais, nearly twenty-four hours before. She still had the spice cake, but it was very dry and she had nothing to wash it down with except a bit of brandy in a flask; after a few bites she choked on the cake and set it aside. Due to the late arrival of the Holyhead boat the train was running late and stopped only for the shortest possible time at each station, not long enough for her to get anything to eat. The train passed the beautiful city of Cork, with its fine old mansions and crumbling castles covered with ivy; half an hour later, at <<noon|13>>, it arrived at the railway station, dockside in Queenstown. The Bothnia, thankfully, had not yet arrived, the bad weather having delayed it as well, but the steamship was expected in just a few minutes. From the train Bisland\x{2019}s luggage was sent down to the tender, and she went off quickly in search of food. The large and stately Queen\x{2019}s Hotel was not far from the landing, but the bad luck that had followed her for the better part of two days required that the hotel kitchen should be undergoing repairs, and only by \x{201c}frantic protest\x{201d} did she manage to obtain from a kitchen worker a cup of cold, bitter tea and a bit of bread as limp and dingy as a scrub rag. Back at the terminal, one of the porters warned her that she should be ready at a moment\x{2019}s notice to be summoned to the tender, for when the steamship was signaled offshore there would be no time to waste. Bisland found the ladies\x{2019} room and made her toilet as best she could\x{2014}her toiletries case was in her Gladstone bag, aboard the tender\x{2014}and then took a seat on a bench in the damp, chilly waiting room.",

            "Hour after hour passed with no summons to the tender. The rain drummed on the roof; the wind whistled through the thin glass of the windows. In her exhaustion, the walls themselves seemed slightly to tremble. In the previous two days she had been in Italy, France, England, Wales, and now Ireland. This was not traveling, as Jules Verne had once observed about Phileas Fogg; it was only describing a circumference. All afternoon Bisland sat in the waiting room, as she later recalled it, \x{201c}hopeless, helpless, overwhelmed with hunger, lack of sleep, and fatigue.\x{201d} She closed her eyes and tried to summon her strength. Her wool overcoat hung heavily on her shoulders, soaked from the rain and the spray. She felt chilled to the bone; it would take time, she knew, to recover from her night on the Irish Sea, and now she was about to cross the Atlantic Ocean. In those two days she had been on a train, a boat, another train, another boat, and still another train. It was best not to think about those meals on the India mail train, the warming soup, the fresh bread and butter, especially the strong hot coffee. From the window a line of hills rose an irresolute gray, seeming to blend into the sky churning with low clouds. The gray and beamless atmosphere, Shelley had written of days like this one. Outside the station she could hear the cries of beggars imploring newly arrived travelers for pennies; here was the poverty of Ireland that had brought so many to New York. There had been beggars at the train stations of the American West, beggars in the harbors of Singapore and Aden, beggars outside the temples in Colombo. On this trip, as Scripture said, the poor had always been with her. Slowly the room darkened. Finally, <<near six o\x{2019}clock|6>>, when her patience was at an end and she was demanding food from one of the station clerks, the long-awaited notice came: the Bothnia had been signaled, and the tender must be off.",

The Southern Pacific sent telegrams up and down the route instructing local companies to have the fastest engines and best men available as needed; extra engines were placed on side tracks, ready to be called into service in case of an emergency. Bly\x{2019}s train was given a \x{201c}regardless order,\x{201d} which meant that it would have the right of way over everything else on the road.

            "At <<five o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>> of the fifth day, January 20, John Jennings received a telegram with instructions from The World: Nellie Bly\x{2019}s steamship was about to arrive in Oakland, and he should get there by the following morning and spare no expense in doing so. No train, he knew, would be able to reach them for two days at least; the only way out now was on skis (or, as they were called in the mountains of the American West, \x{201c}snowshoes,\x{201d} the term \x{201c}ski\x{201d} not yet being in wide circulation). The nearest station that a train could reach was in the town of Alta, fifteen miles away. Jennings himself had no experience in the mountains\x{2014}he had grown up in St. Louis and was a drama critic by trade\x{2014}but a local miner named J. W. Deuel, who had lived in the Sierra for twenty-five years, agreed to guide him to Alta for a price of twenty-five dollars. At the Western Union office by the train station, Jennings sent a telegram to the division superintendent of the railroad asking that an engine be made available for a trip to Colfax or farther; almost immediately the superintendent cabled back granting the request. The telegraph operators warned Jennings that he was facing a desperate trek across the mountains at night. The summit had received twenty to thirty feet of snow, they reminded him, and there was a risk of snowslide at any time. A telegraph lineman had started out the night before from the nearby town of Summit and was thought to be lost in the snow; a Chinese laborer had perished in Towles, near Alta, within fifty feet of the train station. John Jennings was forty-six years old and had never been on skis in his life, but he would not be dissuaded; Deuel had said that he could get to Alta by <<two A.M.|5>>, and Jennings had confidence in his guide and in himself. He returned to the train to get ready, where two other passengers volunteered to join the expedition. At <<six-fifteen|5b>>, seventy-five minutes after receiving the telegram from New York, Jennings and the three others set out for Alta to the cheers of the passengers who remained behind.",

Earlier that day a rotary plow had dug out the railroad track from Emigrant Gap almost to Blue Canyon, five miles away, and the men walked in the cuts that the plow had made. The cuts ranged from eight to sixteen feet deep, making high walls of snow as smooth and solid as plaster; it was like walking down a narrow windowless corridor with no end. The great danger, of course, was that a train would come through and the men would be trapped on the track with no way to escape. This was a form of death not unheard of in the mountains. Each man, as he walked, listened for a distant whistle. The only light came from the orange glow of the lantern, which reflected eerily off the walls of snow. The amount of snowfall was almost unimaginable: only the very tops of the pine trees peeked above the snow lines, and the telegraph poles were buried up to their top arms. Once they passed an abandoned two-story house, covered in snow to the chimney. Above them the sky was blue-black; the snow crunched loudly underfoot. <<Just past midnight|10>> they arrived at Shady Run, two miles west of Blue Canyon.

Bly was thrilled by the unexpected opportunity and took it for all it was worth, pushing the throttle as far as the engineer would allow; sometimes, when he wasn\x{2019}t looking, she nudged it just a bit further, and on the straight stretches of road she pushed it open as far as it would go, until she was sure that nothing had ever run so fast over the Atlantic and Pacific line.

The Navajo reservation was about twenty miles south of the railroad tracks, near the town of Gallup, and Bly saw many Indians on horseback riding nearby. The Rand McNally guide to the area advised travelers that the Navajos \x{201c}display their only interest in civilization by looking at the trains. There is no telling what they think of the innovation.\x{201d} Just east of Gallup, railroad men were repairing a bridge that spanned a deep ravine. While the repairs were in progress the bridge was held up only by jackscrews, without the girders that normally helped to support it. Hearing Bly\x{2019}s unscheduled train coming, the workmen frantically tried to flag it down before it reached the bridge, but they were too late and they watched helplessly as it thundered past at fifty miles an hour, over the weakened bridge and safely across to the other side. \x{201c}The escape is a miraculous one,\x{201d} The World marveled the next day, \x{201c}and section men who witnessed the train flash past on the frail structure regard the escape as one of the most miraculous in railway history.\x{201d}",

The icebergs were tinted the bluish-green of a tropical sea; the tallest rose some two hundred feet above the waterline, its sides as intricately faceted as a square-cut diamond. On board the passengers marveled at the shifting effects of light and shade as the ship slowly plowed its way through the ice field until the icebergs were out of sight.

Hard work at the beginning of the day, she had found, brought better sleep at the end, and in the meantime it kept her from thinking too much about her own sorrows and those of the wider world. She read every night, turning out the light only reluctantly at <<midnight|13>>, resentful at not being able to plunge into the next chapter. Reading had always been for her a doorway into another world, but now it became something more, an anodyne that dulled aches, an opiate that stilled the incessant turning over of questions that had no answers. She described herself, in those days, as a clock with a broken mainspring. \x{201c}If you shake me hard I tick for a few moments, but soon relapse into silence and uselessness.\x{201d}",

            "ON THE MORNING OF NOVEMBER 14, as Nellie Bly made her way to the Hoboken docks, a man named John Brisben Walker was on a ferry headed in the opposite direction, bound from Jersey City to Cortlandt Street in lower Manhattan. Walker was the wealthy publisher of a high-toned monthly magazine called The Cosmopolitan (in later years it would be purchased by Joseph Pulitzer\x{2019}s rival William Randolph Hearst and subsequently assume a very different character), and as the ferry crossed the river he read The World\x{2019}s front-page article revealing Nellie Bly\x{2019}s plan to race around the world. Instantly he recognized the publicity value of such a scheme, even as it occurred to him that a world traveler might do better by heading west rather than east as Bly was planning to do. At once an idea suggested itself: The Cosmopolitan would sponsor its own competitor in the around-the-world race, traveling in the opposite direction. Of course, The Cosmopolitan\x{2019}s circumnavigator would have to be, like Bly, a young woman\x{2014}there was a pleasing symmetry to the notion, and in any case a man racing against a woman would never win anyone\x{2019}s sympathy\x{2014}and she would have to leave immediately, if she was to have any chance at all of returning to New York before Nellie Bly. After a quick conference at the office with his business manager, John Brisben Walker sent him off to a travel agency to prepare an itinerary, and at <<half past ten|10>> he sent a message to Elizabeth Bisland\x{2019}s apartment, only a few blocks away in Murray Hill.

Her head felt suddenly dizzy, and her heart, she would say later, felt as if it were about to burst. Her friends moved slowly away, joining the line of other well-dressed people making their way down the gangplank. From the railing of the ship she could see for miles; out toward the horizon the water turned imperceptibly from blue to gray.
