            "\x{201c}Mrs. Protheroe and her husband had just started for the village. And\x{2014}a very curious thing (though no one happened to think of it that way)\x{2014}Mrs. Protheroe took no handbag with her. Really a most unusual thing for a woman to do. <<Just before twenty past six|10>> she passes my garden and stops and speaks, so as to give me every opportunity of noticing that she has no weapon with her and also that she is quite her normal self. They realized, you see, that I am a noticing kind of person. She disappears round the corner of the house to the study window. The poor Colonel is sitting at the desk writing his letter to you. He is deaf, as we all know. She takes the pistol from the bowl where it is waiting for her, comes up behind him and shoots him through the head, throws down the pistol and is out again like a flash, and going down the garden to the studio. Nearly anyone would swear that there couldn\x{2019}t have been time!\x{201d}",

It was absolutely necessary that a shot should be heard\x{2014}otherwise suspicion of Mrs. Protheroe might have continued. How Mr. Redding arranged it, I don\x{2019}t quite know. But I understand that picric acid explodes if you drop a weight on it, and you will remember, dear Vicar, that you met Mr. Redding carrying a large stone just in the part of the wood where you picked up that crystal later. Gentlemen are so clever at arranging things\x{2014}the stone suspended above the crystals and then a time fuse\x{2014}or do I mean a slow match? Something that would take about twenty minutes to burn through\x{2014}so that the explosion would come <<about 6:30|2>> when he and Mrs. Protheroe had come out of the studio and were in full view. A very safe device because what would there be to find afterwards\x{2014}only a big stone! But even that he tried to remove\x{2014}when you came upon him.\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}But mother is not the sort to give in. She thought it only decent to go to father first, but when he turned her down so brutally she sent a note to me, and I arranged to leave the tennis party early and meet her at the end of the footpath at a <<quarter past six|10>>. We just had a hurried meeting and arranged when to meet again. We left each other before <<half past six|10>>. Afterwards I was terrified that she would be suspected of having killed father. After all, she had got a grudge against him. That\x{2019}s why I got hold of that old picture of her up in the attic and slashed it about. I was afraid the police might go nosing about and get hold of it and recognize it. Dr. Haydock was frightened too. Sometimes, I believe, he really thought she had done it! Mother is rather a\x{2014}desperate kind of person. She doesn\x{2019}t count consequences.\x{201d}",
