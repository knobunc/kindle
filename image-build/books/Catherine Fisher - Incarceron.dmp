  They stared up at it. A narrow, faintly blue light, falling on the chair and nothing else. Barely bright enough to read by. A cold thought chilled her.
  
  \x{201c}Master \x{2026} this is not a place of torture, is it?\x{201d}
  
  He didn\x{2019}t answer at first, then she was grateful for his measured tone.
  
  \x{201c}I doubt it. There are no restraints, no signs of violence. Do you think your father would need to use such devices?\x{201d}

  \x{201c}Jared. That\x{2019}s enough.\x{201d}
  
  She crossed to the gate and stepped through. The cellars were still and gloomy. All the alarms were safely in place. And yet she was suddenly shaken by terrors; that dark figures were watching, that Fax was there, that her father stood in the shadows where she had stood, that the bronze gate would slam suddenly and trap Jared inside.

Faint bells chimed <<eleven|11>> in the clock towers and stables of the Palace. In one hour her wedding day would dawn. She would not give up. Not yet.
