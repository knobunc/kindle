CRYSTAL EAGLE, DARK SWAN
Who can chart the vastness of Incarceron?

Its halls and viaducts, its chasms?

Only the man who has known freedom

Can define his prison.

***

Finn had been flung on his face and chained to the stone slabs of the transitway. His
arms, spread wide, were weighted with links so heavy, he could barely drag his wrists off
the ground. His ankles were tangled in a slithering mass of metal, bolted through a ring in
the pavement. He couldn't raise his chest to get enough air. He lay exhausted, the stone
icy against his cheek. But the Civicry were coming at last.

He felt them before he heard them; vibrations in the ground, starting tiny and growing until
they shivered in his teeth and nerves. Then noises in the darkness, the rumble of
migration trucks, the slow hollow clang of wheel rims. Dragging his head around, he
shook dirty hair out of his eyes and saw how the parallel grooves in the floor arrowed
straight under his body. He was chained directly across the tracks.

Sweat slicked his forehead. Gripping the frosted links with

6
one glove he hauled his chest up and gasped in a breath. The air was acrid and smelled
of oil.


It was no use yelling yet. They were too far off and wouldn't hear him over the clamor of the
wheels until they were well into the vast hall. He would have to time it exactly. Too late, and
the trucks couldn't be stopped, and he would be crushed. Desperately, he tried to avoid
the other thought. That they might see him and hear him and not even care.

Lights.

Small, bobbing, handheld lights. Concentrating, he counted nine, eleven, twelve; then
counted them again to have a number that was firm, that would stand against the nausea
choking his throat.

Nuzzling his face against the torn sleeve for some comfort he thought of Keiro, his grin,
the last mocking little slap as he'd checked the lock and stepped back into the dark. He
whispered the name, a bitter whisper: \"Keiro.\"

Vast halls and invisible galleries swallowed it. Fog hung in the metallic air. The trucks
clanged and groaned.

He could see people now, trudging. They emerged from the darkness so muffled against
the cold, it was hard to tell if they were children or old, bent women. Probably children--the
aged, if they kept any, would ride on the trams, with the goods. A black-and-white ragged
flag draped the leading truck; he could see its design, a heraldic bird with a silver bolt in
its beak.

\"Stop!\" he called. \"Look! Down here!\"

7
The grinding of machinery shuddered the floor. It whined in his bones. He clenched his
hands as the sheer weight and impetus of the trucks came home to him, the smell of
sweat from the massed ranks of men pushing them, the rattle and slither of piled goods.
He waited, forcing his terror down, second by second testing his nerve against death, not
breathing, not letting himself break, because he was Finn the Starseer, he could do this.
Until from nowhere a sweating panic erupted and he heaved himself up and screamed,
\"Did you hear me! Stop! Stop?

They came on.

The noise was unbearable. Now he howled and kicked and struggled, because the
terrible momentum of the loaded trucks would slide relentlessly, loom over him, darken
him, crush his bones and body in slow inevitable agony.

Until he remembered the flashlight.


It was tiny but he still had it. Keiro had made sure of that. Dragging the weight of the
chain, he rolled and wriggled his hand inside his coat, wrist muscles twisting in spasm.
His fingers slid on the slim cold tube.

Vibrations shuddered through his body. He jerked the flashlight out and dropped it and it
rolled, just out of reach. He cursed, squirmed, pressed it on with his chin.

Light beamed.

He was gasping with relief, but the trucks still came on. Surely the Civicry could see him.
They must be able to see him!

8
The flashlight was a star in the immense rumbling darkness of the hall, and in that
moment, through all its stairs and galleries and thousands of labyrinthine chambers he
knew Incarceron had sensed his peril, and the crash of the trucks was its harsh
amusement, that the Prison watched him and would not interfere.

\"I know you can see me!\" he screamed.

The wheels were man-high. They shrieked in the grooves; sparks fountained across the
paving. A child called, a high shout, and Finn groaned and huddled tight, knowing none of
it had worked, knowing it was finished, and then the wail of the brakes hit him, the
screech in his bones and fingers.

The wheels loomed. They were high above. They were over him.

They were still.

He couldn't move. His body was a limp rag of terror. The flashlight illuminated nothing but
a fist-thick rivet in an oily flange.

Then, beyond it, a voice demanded, \"What's your name, Prisoner?\"

They were gathered in the darkness. He managed to lift his head and saw shapes,
hooded.

\"Finn. My name's Finn.\" His voice was a whisper; he had to swallow. \"I didn't think you
were going to stop ...\"

A grunt. Someone else said, \"Looks like Scum to me.\"


\"No! Please! Please get me up.\" They were silent and no one

9
moved, so he took a breath and said tightly, \"The Scum raided our Wing. They killed my
father and they left me like this for anyone who passed.\" He tried to ease the agony in his
chest, clenching his fingers on the rusty chain. \"Please. I'm begging you.\"

Someone came close. The toe of a boot halted next to his eye; dirty, with one patched
hole.

\"What sort of Scum?\"

\"The Comitatus. Their leader called himself Jormanric the Winglord.\"

The man spat, close to Finn's ear. \"That one! He's a crazed thug.\"

Why was nothing happening? Finn squirmed, desperate. \"Please! They may come
back!\"

\"I say we ride over him. Why interfere?\"

\"Because we're Civicry, not Scum.\" To Finn's surprise, a woman. He heard the rustle of
her silk clothes under the coarse travelcoat. She knelt and he saw her gloved hand tug at
the chains. His wrist was bleeding; rust made powdery loops on his grimy skin.

The man said uneasily, \"Maestra, listen ...\"

\"Get bolt-cutters, Sim. Now.\"

Her face was close to Finn's. \"Don't worry, Finn. I won't leave you here.\"

Painfully, he looked up, saw a woman of about twenty, her hair red, her eyes dark. For a
moment he smelled her; a drift of soap and soft wool, a heart-stabbing scent that broke
into his

10

memory, into that black locked box inside him. A room. A room with an applewood fire. A
cake on a china plate.

The shock must have shown on his face; from the shadow of her hood she looked at him
thoughtfully. \"Y be safe with us.\"
                ou'll


Finn stared back. He couldn't breathe.

A nursery. The walls stone. The hangings rich and red.

A man came hastily and slid the cutter under the chain. \"Watch your eyes,\" he growled.
Finn dropped his head on his sleeve, sensing people crowding around. For a moment he
thought one of the fits he dreaded was coming over him; he closed his eyes and felt the
familiar dizzying heat sweep his body. He fought it, swallowing saliva, gripping the chains
as the massive cutters sheared them open. The memory was fading; the room and the
fire, the cake with tiny silver balls on a gold-bordered plate. Even as he tried to keep it, it
was gone, and the icy darkness of Incarceron was back, the sour metallic stench of oily
wheels.

Links slid and rattled. He heaved himself upright in relief, dragging in deep breaths. The
woman took his wrist and turned it over. \"This will need dressing.\"

He froze. He couldn't move. Her fingers were cool and clean, and she had touched him on
his skin, between the torn sleeve and the glove, and she was looking at the tiny tattoo of
the crowned bird.

She frowned. \"That's not a Civicry mark. It looks like ...\"

11
\"What?\" He was alert at once. \"Like what?\"

A rumble miles off in the hall. The chains at his feet slithered. Bending over them the man
with the cutters hesitated. \"That's odd. This bolt. It's loose ...\"

The Maestra stared at the bird. \"Like the crystal.\"

A shout, behind them.

\"What crystal?\" Finn said.

\"A strange object. We found it.\"

\"And the bird is the same? You're sure?\"

\"Yes.\" Distracted, she turned and looked at the bolt. \"Y weren't really--\"
                                                        ou

He had to know about this. He had to keep her alive. He grabbed her and pulled her to


the floor. \"Get down,\" he whispered. And then, angrily, \"Don't you understand? It's all a
trap!'

For a moment her eyes stared into his and he saw their surprise fractured into horror. She
jerked out of his grip; with one twist was up and screaming, \"Run! Everyone run!\" But the
grids in the floor were crashing open; arms came out, bodies were heaved up, weapons
slammed down on the stone.

Finn moved. He flung the man with the cutters back, kicked the false bolt off, and wriggled
out of the chains. Keiro was yelling at him; a cutlass flashed past his head and he threw
himself down, rolled, and looked up.

The hall was black with smoke. The Civicry were screaming, racing for the shelter of the
vast pillars, but already the

12
Scum were on the wagons, firing indiscriminately, red flashes from the clumsy firelocks
turning the hall acrid.

He couldn't see her. She might be dead, she might be running. Someone shoved him and
thrust a weapon into his hand; he thought it was Lis, but the Scum all wore their dark
helms and he couldn't tell.

Then he saw the woman. She was pushing children under the first wagon; a small boy
was sobbing and she grabbed him and flung him in front of her. But gas was hissing from
the small spheres that fell and cracked like eggs, its sting making Finn's eyes water. He
pulled out his helm and dragged it on, the soaked pads over nose and mouth magnifying
his breathing. Through its eye grid the hall was red, the figures clear.

She had a weapon and was firing with it.

\"Finn!\"

It was Keiro, but Finn ignored the shout. He ran for the first truck, dived under it, and
grabbed the Maestra's arm; as she turned he knocked the weapon aside and she
screamed in anger and went for his face with her nailed gloves, the spines clawing at his
helm. As he dragged her out, the children kicked and struggled with him, and a cascade
of foodstuffs was tossed down around them, caught, stowed, slid efficiently into chutes
down the grids.

An alarm howled.


Incarceron stirred.

Smooth panels slid aside in the walls; with a click, spotlights

13
of brilliant light stabbed down from the invisible roof, roaming back and forth over the
distant floor, picking out the Scum as they scattered like rats, their stark shadows
enormous. \"Evacuate!\" Keiro yelled.

Finn pushed the woman on. Next to them a running figure was drilled with light and
evaporated soundlessly, caught in mid-panic. Children wailed.

The woman turned, breathless with shock, staring back at the remnants of her people.
Then Finn dragged her to the chute.

Through the mask his eyes met hers.

\"Down there,\" he gasped. \"Or you'll die.\"

For a moment he almost thought she wouldn't.

Then she spat at him, snatched herself out of his hands, and jumped into the chute.

A spark of white fire scorched over the stones; instantly, Finn jumped after her.

The chute was of white silk, strong and taut. He slid down it in a breathlessness that
tipped him out at the other end onto a pile of stolen furs and bruising metal components.

Already hauled to one side, a weapon at her head, the Maestra watched in scorn.

Finn picked himself up painfully. All around, the Scum were sliding into the tunnel,
encumbered with plunder, some hobbling, some barely conscious. Last of all, landing
lightly on his feet, came Keiro.

The grids slammed shut.

14
The chutes fell away.

Dim shapes gasped and coughed and tore off masks.


Keiro removed his slowly, revealing his handsome face smeared with dust. Finn swung
on him in fury. \"What happened? I was panicked out there! What rook you so long?\"

Keiro smiled. \"Calm down. Aklo couldn't get the gas to work. Y kept them talking well
                                                              ou
enough.\" He looked at the woman. \"Why bother with her?\"

Finn shrugged, still simmering. \"She's a hostage.\"

Keiro raised an eyebrow. \"Too much trouble.\" He jerked his head at the man holding the
weapon; the man snicked back the trigger. The Maestra's face was white.

\"So I don't get anything extra for risking my life up there.\" Finn's voice was steady . He
didn't move, but Keiro looked over at him. For a moment they stared at each other. Then
his oath-brother said coolly , \"If she's what you want.\"

\"She's what I want.\"

Keiro glanced at the woman again, and shrugged. \"No accounting for taste.\" He nodded,
and the weapon was lowered. Then he slapped Finn on the shoulder, so that a cloud of
dust rose from his clothes. \"Well done, brother,\" he said.

We will choose an Era from the past and re-create it.

We will make a world free from the anxiety of change!

It will be Paradise!

--King Endor's Decree

***

The oak tree looked genuine, but it had been genetically aged. The boughs were so huge
that climbing them was easy; as she hitched up her skirt and scrambled higher, twigs
snapped and green lichen dusted her hands. \"Claudia! It's <<four o'clock|6>>!\"

Alys's screech came from somewhere in the rose garden. Claudia ignored it, parted the


leaves, and looked out.

From this height she could see the whole estate; the kitchen garden, glasshouses, and
orangery, the gnarled apple trees in the orchard, the barns where the dances were held in
winter. She could see the long green lawns that sloped down to the lake and the
beechwoods hiding the lane to Hithercross. Farther to the west the chimneys of Altan
Farm smoked, and the old church steeple crowned Harmer Hill, its weathercock glinting
in the sun. Beyond, for miles and miles, the countryside of the Wardenry lay open before
her, meadows and villages and lanes, a blue-green patchwork smudged with mist above
the rivers.

16
She sighed and leaned back against the trunk. It looked so peaceful. So perfect in its
deception. She would hate to leave it.

\"Claudia! Hurry!\"

The call was fainter. Her nurse must have run back toward the house, because a scatter
of pigeons flapped up, as if someone was climbing the steps by their cote. As Claudia
listened, the clock on the stables began to strike the hour, slow chimes sliding out into the
hot afternoon.

The countryside shimmered.

Far off, on the high road, she saw the coach.

Her lips tightened. He was early.

It was a black carriage, and even from here she could make out the cloud of dust its
wheels raised from the road. Four black horses pulled it, and outriders flanked it; she
counted eight of them and snorted a silent laugh. The Warden of Incarceron was traveling
in style. The blazon of his office was painted on the coach doors, and a long pennant
streamed out in the wind. On the box a driver in black and gold livery wrestled with the
reins; she heard the rattle of a whip clear on the breeze.

Above her a bird cheeped and fluttered from branch to branch; she kept very still and it
perched in the leaf cover near her face. Then it sang; a brief creamy warble. Some sort of
finch, perhaps.

The coach had reached the village. She saw the blacksmith

17


come to his door, a few children run out of a barn. As the riders thundered through, dogs
barked and the horses bunched together between the narrow overhanging houses.

Claudia reached into her pocket and took out the visor. It was non-Era and illegal, but she
didn't care. Slipping it over her eyes she felt the dizzying second as the lens adjusted to
her optic nerve; then the scene magnified and she saw the features of the men clearly: her
fathers steward, Garrh, on the roan horse; the dark secretary, Lucas Medlicote; the men-
at-arms with their pied coats.

The visor was so efficient she could almost lip-read as the coachman swore; then the
posts of the bridge flashed past and she realized they had reached the river and the
lodge. Mistress Simmy was running out to open the gates with a dishcloth still in her
hands, hens panicking before her.

Claudia frowned. She took off the visor and the movement made the bird fly; the world slid
back and the coach was small. Alys wailed, \"Claudia! They're here! Will you come and
get dressed!\"

For a moment she thought she wouldn't. She toyed with the idea of letting the carriage
rumble in and climbing down from the tree and strolling over, opening the door, and
standing there in front of him, with her hair in a tangle and the old green dress with the
tear in its hem. Her father's displeasure would be stiff, but he wouldn't say anything. If she
turned up naked he probably wouldn't say anything. Just \"Claudia. My dear.\" And the cold
kiss printed under her ear.

18
She swung over the bough and climbed down, wondering if there would be a present.
There usually was. Expensive and pretty and chosen for him by one of the ladies of the
Court. Last time it had been a crystal bird in a gold cage that trilled a shrill whistle. Even
though the whole estate was full of birds, mostly real ones, which flew and squabbled and
chirruped outside the casements.

Jumping off, she ran across the lawn to the wide stone steps; as she descended them,
the manor house rose in front of her, its warm stone glowing in the heat, the wisteria
hanging purple over its turrets and crooked corners, the deep moat dark under three
elegant swans. On the roof doves had settled, cooing and strutting; some of them flew to
the corner turrets and tucked themselves into loopholes and arrow slits, on heaps of straw
that had taken generations to gather. Or so you'd think.

A casement unclicked; Alys's hot face gasped, \"Where have you been! Can't you hear
them?\"


\"I can hear them. Stop panicking.\"

As she raced up the steps the carriage was rumbling over the timbers of the bridge; she
saw its blackness flicker through the balustrade; then the cool dimness of the house was
around her, with its scents of rosemary and lavender. A serving girl came out of the
kitchens, dropped a hasty curtsy, and disappeared. Claudia hurtled up the stairs.

In her room Alys was dragging clothes out of the closet. A silken petticoat, the blue and
gold dress over it, the bodice

19
quickly laced. Claudia stood there and let herself be strapped and fastened into it, the
hated cage she was kept in. Over her nurse's shoulder she saw the crystal bird in the tiny
prison, its beak agape, and scowled at it.

\"Keep still.\"

\"I am still!\"

\"I suppose you were with Jared.\"

Claudia shrugged. Gloom was settling over her. She couldn't be bothered to explain.

The bodice was too tight, but she was used to it. Her hair was fiercely brushed and the
pearl net pinned into it; it crackled with static on the velvet of her shoulders. Breathless,
the old woman stepped back. \"Y     ou'd look better if you weren't scowling.

\"I'll scowl if I want to.\" Claudia turned to the door, feeling the whole dress sway. \"One day
I'll howl and scream and yell in his face.\"

\"I don't think so.\" Alys stuffed the old green dress into the chest. She glanced in the mirror
and tucked the gray hairs back under her wimple, took a laser skinwand out, unscrewed
it, and skillfully eliminated a wrinkle under her eye.

\"If I'm going to be Queen, who's to stop me?\"

\"He is.\" Her nurse's retort followed her through the door. \"And you're just as terrified of
him as everyone else.\"

It was true. Walking sedately down the stairs, she knew it had always been true. Her life
was fractured into two; the time


20
when her father was here, and the time he was away. She lived two lives, and so did the
servants, the whole house, the estate, the world.

As she crossed the wooden floor between the breathless, sweating double row of
gardeners and dairywomen, lackeys and link-men, toward the coach that had rumbled to
a halt in the cobbled courtyard, she wondered if he had any idea of that. Probably. He
didn't miss much.

On the steps she waited. Horses snorted; the clatter of their hooves was huge in the
enclosed space. Someone shouted, old Ralph hurried forward; two powdered men in
livery leaped from the back of the coach, opened the door, snapped down the steps.

For a moment the doorway was dark.

Then his hand grasped the coachwork; his dark hat came out, his shoulders, a boot,
black knee breeches.

John Arlex, Warden of Incarceron, stood upright and flicked dust off himself with his
gloves.

He was a tall, straight man, his beard carefully trimmed, his frockcoat and waistcoat of the
finest brocade. It had been six months since she had seen him, but he looked exactly the
same. No one of his status need show signs of age, but he didn't even seem to use a
skinwand. He looked at her and smiled graciously; his dark hair, tied in the black ribbon,
was elegantly silvered.

\"Claudia. How well you look, my dear.\"

She stepped forward and dropped a low curtsy, then his hand

21
raised her and she felt the cold kiss. His fingers were always cool and slightly clammy,
unpleasant to touch; as if he was aware of it, he usually wore gloves, even in warm
weather. She wondered if he thought she had changed. \"As do you, Father,\" she
muttered.

For a moment he remained looking at her, the calm gray gaze hard and clear as ever.
Then he turned.

\"Allow me to present our guest. The Queen's Chancellor. Lord Evian.\"


The carriage rocked. An extremely fat man unfurled from it, and with him a wave of scent
that seemed to roll almost visibly up the steps. Behind her Claudia sensed the servants'
collective interest. She felt only dismay.

The Chancellor wore a blue silk suit with an elaborate ruffle at the neck, so high she
wondered how he could breathe. He was certainly red in the face, but his bow was
assured and his smile carefully pleasant. \"My lady Claudia. The last time I saw you, you
were no more than a baby in arms. How delightful to see you again.\"

She hadn't expected a visitor. The main guestroom was heaped with the half-sewn train of
her wedding dress all over its unmade bed. She'd have to use delaying tactics.

\"The honor is ours,\" she said. \"Perhaps you'd like to come into the parlor. We have cider
and newly baked cakes as refreshment after your journey.\" Well, she hoped they did.
Turning, she saw three of the servants had gone and the gaps in the line had

22
closed swiftly behind them. Her father gave her a cool look, then walked up the steps,
nodding graciously along the row of faces that curtsied and bobbed and dropped their
eyes before him.

Smiling tightly, Claudia thought fast. Evian was the Queen's man. The witch must have
sent him to look the bride over. Well, that was fine by her. She'd been preparing for this for
years.

At the door her father stopped. \"No Jared?\" he said lightly.

\"I hope he's well?\"

\"I think he's working on a very delicate process. He probably hasn't even noticed you've
arrived.\" It was true, but it sounded like an excuse. Annoyed at his wintry smile she led
them, her skirts sweeping the bare boards, into the parlor. It was a wood-paneled room
dark with a great mahogany sideboard, carved chairs, and a trestle table. She was
relieved to see cider jugs and a platter of the cook's honeycakes among a scatter of
lavender and rosemary.

Lord Evian sniffed the sweet scents. \"Wonderful,\" he said. \"Even the Court couldn't match
the authenticity.\"

Probably because most of the Courts backdrop was computer-generated, she thought
sweetly, and said, \"At the Wardenry, my lord, we pride ourselves that everything is in Era.
The house is truly old. It was restored fully after the Years of Rage.\"


Her father was silent. He sat in the carved chair at the head of the table and watched
gravely as Ralph poured the cider into

23
silver goblets. The old man's hand shook as he lifted the tray. \"Welcome home, sir.\"

\"Good to see you, Ralph. A little more gray about the eyebrows, I think. And your wig fuller,
with more powder.\"

Ralph bowed. \"I'll have it seen to, Warden, immediately.\"

The Warden's eyes surveyed the room. She knew he wouldn't miss the single pane of
Plastiglas in the corner of the casement, or the prefabricated spiderwebs on the pargeted
ceiling. So she said hastily, \"How is Her Gracious Majesty, my lord?\"

\"The Queen's in excellent health.\" Evian spoke through a mouthful of cake. \"She's very
busy with arrangements for your wedding. It will be a great spectacle.\"

Claudia frowned. \"But surely ...\"

He waved a plump hand. \"Of course your father hasn't had time to tell you about the
change of plans.\"

Something inside her went cold. \"Change of plans?\"

\"Nothing terrible, child. Nothing to concern yourself about. An alteration of dates, that's all.
Because of the Earl's return horn the Academy.\"

She cleared her face and tried to allow none of her anxiety to show itself. But her lips must
have tightened or her knuckles gone white, because her father stood smoothly and said,
\"Show His Lordship to his room, Ralph.\"

The old retainer bowed, went to the door, and creaked it open. Evian struggled up, a
shower of crumbs cascading from his suit. As they hit the floor, they evaporated with
minute flashes.

24
Claudia swore silently. Something else to get seen to.

They listened to the heavy footsteps up the creaking stairs, to Ralph's respectful murmurs
and the rumble of the fat man's hearty enjoyment of the staircase, the paintings, the urns


from China, the damask hangings. When his voice had finally faded in the sunlit distances
of the house Claudia looked at her father. Then she said, \"Y ou've brought the wedding
forward.\"

He raised an eyebrow. \"Next year, this year, what's the difference? Y knew it would
                                                                     ou
come.\" \"I'm not ready ...\"

\"You've been ready for a long time.\"

He took a step toward her, the silver cube on his watch chain catching the light. She
stepped back. If he should drop the formal stiffness of the Era, it would be unbearable; the
threat of his unveiled personality turned her cold. But he kept the smooth courtesy. \"Let
me explain. Last month a message came from the Sapienti. They've had enough of your
fianc\x{fffd}. They've ... asked him to leave the Academy.\"

She frowned. \"For what?\"

\"The usual vices. Drink, drugs, violence, getting serving girls pregnant. Sins of stupid
young men throughout the centuries. He has no interest in education. Why should he?
He's the Earl of Steen and when he is eighteen he will be King.\"

He walked to the paneled wall and looked up at the portrait there. A freckled cheeky-
faced boy of seven looked down at

25
them. He was dressed in a ruffled brown silk suit, and leaning against a tree.

\"Caspar, Earl of Steen. Crown Prince of the Realm. Fine titles. His face hasn't changed,
has it? He was merely impudent then. Now he's feckless, brutal, and thinks he is beyond
control.\" He looked at her. \"A challenge, your future husband.\"

She shrugged, making the dress rustle. \"I can deal with him.\"

\"Of course you can. I've made sure of that.\" He came over to her and stood before her,
and his gray gaze appraised her. She stared straight back.

\"I created you for this marriage, Claudia. Gave you taste, intelligence, ruthlessness. Your
education has been more rigorous than anyone's in the Realm. Languages, music,
swordplay, riding, every talent you even hinted at possessing I have nurtured. Expense is
nothing to the Warden of Incarceron. Y are an heiress of great estates. I've bred you as
                                       ou
a queen and Queen you will be. In every marriage, one leads, one follows. Though this is
merely a dynastic arrangement, it will be so here.\"


She looked up at the portrait. \"I can handle Caspar. But his mother ...\"

\"Leave the Queen to me. She and I understand each other.\" He took her hand, holding her
ring finger lightly between two of his; tense, she held herself still.

\"It will be easy,\" he breathed.

26
In the stillness of the warm room a wood pigeon cooed outside the casement.

Carefully, she took her hand from his and drew herself up. \"So, when?\"

\"Next week.\"

\"Next week!\"

\"The Queen has already begun preparations. In two days we set off for Court. Make sure
you're ready.\"

Claudia said nothing. She felt empty, and stunned.

John Arlex turned toward the door. \"You've done well here. The Era is impeccable, except
for that window. Get it changed.\"

Without moving she said quietly, \"How was your time at Court?\"

\"Wearisome.\"

\"And your work? How is Incarceron?\"

For a fraction of a second he paused. Her heart thudded. Then he turned and his voice
was cold and curious. \"The Prison is in excellent order. Why do you ask?\"

\"No reason.\" She tried to smile, wanting to know how he monitored the Prison, where it
was, because all her spies had told her he never left the Court. But the mysteries of
Incarceron were the least of her worries now.

\"Ah yes. I nearly forgot.\" He crossed to a leather bag on the table and tugged it open. \"I
bring a gift from your future mother-in-law.\" He pulled it out and set it down.

27


They both looked at it.

A sandalwood box, tied with ribbon.

Reluctant, Claudia reached out for the tiny bow, but he said, \"Wait,\" took out a small
scanning wand, and moved it over the box. Images flashed down its stem. \"Harmless.\"
He folded the wand. \"Open it.\"

She lifted the lid. Inside, in a frame of gold and pearls, was an enameled miniature of a
black swan on a lake, the emblem of her house. She took it out and smiled, pleased
despite herself by the delicate blue of the water, the bird's long elegant neck. It's pretty.

\"Y but watch.\"
  es,

The swan was moving. It seemed to glide, peacefully at first; then it reared up, flapping its
great wings, and she saw how an arrow came slowly out of the trees and pierced its
breast. It opened its golden beak and sang, an eerie, terrible music. Then it sank under
the water and vanished.

Her father's smile was acid. \"How very charming,\" he said.

The experiment will be a bold one and there

Incarceron will be a system of great complexity and intelligence. There could be no
kinder or more compassionate guardian for its inmates.

--Project report; Martor Sapiens

***

It was a long way back to the shaft, and the tunnels were low. The Maestra walked with her
head bent; she was silent , her arms hugging herself. Keiro had put Big Arko to watch her,
Finn stayed right at the back behind the wounded.


In this part of the wing, Incarceron was dark and mostly uninhabited. Here the Prison
rarely bothered itself to stir, putting its lights on infrequently and sending few Beetles out.
Unlike the stone transitway above, these floors were made of a metallic mesh that gave
slightly underfoot; as Finn walked he saw the gleam of a rat's eyes where it crouched,
dust falling on its metal scales.

He was stiff and sore, and as always after an ambush, angry. For everyone else the pent-
up tension had burst; even the injured chattered as they stumbled, and their loud laughter
had the energy of relief in it. He turned his head and looked back. Behind them the tunnel
was windblown and echoing. Incarceron would be listening.

29
He couldn't talk and he didn't want to laugh. A bleak stare at a few joking remarks warned
the others off; he saw Lis nudge Amoz and raise her eyebrows. Finn didn't care. The
anger was inside, at himself, and it was mixed with fear and a hot, scorching pride,
because no one else had had the guts to be chained like that, to lie there in all that
silence and wait for death to come rolling over him.

In his mind he felt the huge wheels again, high above his head.

And he was angry with the Maestra.

The Comitatus took no prisoners. It was one of the rules. Keiro was one thing, but when
they got back to the Den he'd have to explain her to Jormanric, and that turned him cold.
But the woman knew something about the tattoo on his wrist, and he had to find out what
that was. He might never have another chance.

Walking, he thought about that flash of vision. As always it had hurt, as if the memory--if it
was one--had sparked and struggled up from some deep, sore place, a lost pit of the
past. And it was hard to keep it clear; already he had forgotten most of it, except the cake
on a plate, decorated with silver balls. Stupid and useless. Telling him nothing about who
he was, or where he had come from.

The shaft had a ladder down its side; the scouts swarmed over first, then the Prisoners
and the warband, lowering goods and the wounded. Last of all Finn climbed down,
noticing how

30
the smooth sides were cracked here and there where shriveled black ferns broke out.
Those would have to be cleared, otherwise the Prison might sense them, seal off this
duct, and reabsorb the whole tunnel, as it had last year when they'd come back from a
raid to find the old Den gone, and only a wide white passageway decorated with abstract


images of red and gold.

\"Incarceron has shrugged its shoulders,\" Gildas had said grimly.

That was the first time he had heard the Prison laugh.

He shivered, remembering it now, a cold, amused chuckle that had echoed down the
corridors. It had silenced Jormanric in mid-fury, had made the hairs on his own skin
prickle with terror. The Prison was alive. It was cruel and careless, and he was inside it.

He leaped down the last rungs into the Den. The great chamber was as noisy and untidy
as ever, the warmth of its blazing fires overwhelming. As people clustered anxiously
around the plunder, pulling the grain sacks open, tugging out food, he pushed through the
crowd and made straight for the tiny cell he shared with Keiro. No one stopped him.

Inside, he latched the flimsy door and sat on the bed. The room was cold and smelled of
unwashed clothes, but it was quiet. Slowly, he let himself lie back.

He breathed in, and inhaled terror. It came over him in a wave, appalling; he knew the
hammering of his heart would kill him, felt cold sweat ice his back and upper lip. Until now

31
he had kept it at bay, but these shuddering heartbeats were the vibrations of the giant
wheels; as he jammed his palms into his closed eyes he saw the metal rims looming
above him, lay in a screeching fountain of sparks.

He could have been killed. Or, worse still, crushed and maimed. Why had he said he
would do it? Why did he always have to live up to their stupid, reckless reputation?

\"Finn?\"

He opened his eyes.

After a moment, he rolled over.

Keiro was standing with his back to the door.

\"How long have you been there?\" Finns voice cracked; he cleared his throat hastily.

\"Long enough.\" His oathbrother came and sat on the other bed. \"Tired?\"

\"That's one word for it.\"


Keiro nodded. Then he said, \"There's always a price to pay. Any Prisoner knows that.\" He
looked at the door. \"None of them out there could have done what you did.\"

\"I'm not a Prisoner.\"

\"Y are now.\"
  ou

Finn sat up and rubbed his dirty hair. \"Y could have done
                                         ou

it.\"

\"Well, yes, I could.\" Keiro smiled. \"But then, I'm extraordinary, Finn, an artist of theft.
Devastatingly handsome, utterly ruthless, totally fearless.\" He tipped his head sideways,
as if

32
waiting for the snort of scorn; when it didn't come he laughed and pulled off his dark coat
and jerkin. Unlocking the chest, he dropped the sword and firelock in, then searched
among the heap of clothes and dragged out a red shirt flamboyantly laced with black.

Finn said, \"Next time you, then.\"

\"Have you ever known me not take my turn, brother? The Comitatus have to have our
reputation pounded into their thick heads. Keiro and Finn. The fearless. The best.\" He
poured water from the jug and washed. Finn watched wearily. Keiro had smooth skin, lithe
muscles. In all this hell of deformed and starved people, of halfmen and pock-beggars, his
oathbrother was perfect. And he took great care to stay that way. Now, pulling the red shirt
on, Keiro threaded a stolen trinket into his mane of hair and looked at himself carefully in
the fragment of mirror. Without turning he said, \"Jormanric wants you.\"

Finn had been expecting it; even so it chilled him. \"Now?\"

\"Right now. You'd better clean up.\"

He didn't want to. But after a moment he poured out fresh water and rubbed at the grease
and oil on his arms.

Keiro said, \"I'll back you about the woman. On one condition.\"

Finn paused. \"What?\"


\"That you tell me what this is really all about.\"

\"There's nothing ...\"

Keiro threw the ragged towel at him. \"Finn Starseer doesn't

33
sell women or children. Amoz yes, or any of the hard cases. Not you.\"

Finn looked up; Keiro's blue eyes gazed straight back.

\"Maybe I'm just getting like the rest of you.\" He dried his face in the gritty rag, then, not
bothering to change, headed for the door. Halfway there Keiro's voice stopped him.

\"Y think she knows something about you.\"
  ou

Ruefully, Finn turned. \"Sometimes I wish I'd picked someone less sharp to watch my
back. All right. Y There was something she said ... that might ... that I need to ask her
                  es.
about. I need her alive.\"

Keiro moved past him to the door. \"Well, don't sound too keen or he'll kill her in front of
your face. Let me do most of the talking.\" He checked for listeners outside and looked
back over his shoulder. \"Scowl, and stay silent, brother. It's what you're good at.\"

***

THE DOOR to Jormanric's cell had the usual two bodyguards in front of it, but a wide grin
from Keiro made the nearer grunt and step aside. Following his oathbrother in, Finn
almost choked on the familiar sweet stench of ket, its intoxicating fumes heavy in the air. It
caught in his throat; he swallowed, trying not to breathe too deeply.

Keiro elbowed through the pairs of oathbrothers, right to the front, and Finn trailed after
his flashy red coat among the drab crowd.

34
Most of them were halfmen. Some had metallic claws for hands, or plastic tissue in
patches where the skin had gone. One had a false eye that looked exactly like a real one,
except that it was blind, the iris a sapphire. They were the lowest of the low, enslaved and
despised by the pure; men whom the Prison had repaired, sometimes cruelly, sometimes
just on a whim. <<One|9k:0>>, a dwarfish, bent man with wiry hair, didn't step out of the way fast
enough. Keiro floored him with one blow.


Keiro had a peculiar hatred for the halfmen. He never spoke to them, and barely
acknowledged they existed, rather like the dogs that infested the Den. As if, Finn thought,
his own perfection was insulted by their existence.

The crowd fell back, and they were among the warband. The Comitatus of Jormanric was
a shambling and feckless army, fearless only in its own imagination. Big and Little Arko;
Amoz and his twin, Zoma; the frail girl Lis, who went berserk in fights; and her oathsister,
Ramill, who never said a word. A crowd of old lags and brash big-mouthed boys, sly
cutthroats, and a few women expert in poisons. And, surrounded by his muscle-bound
bodyguard, the man himself.

Jormanric, as always, was chewing ket. His few teeth worked automatically, scarlet with
the sweet juice that stained his lips and beard. Behind him his bodyguard chewed in
unison.

He must be totally immune to the drug, Finn thought. Even if he couldn't do without it.

35
\"Keiro!\" The Winglord's voice was a drawl. \"And Finn the Starseer.\"

The last word was heavy with irony. Finn scowled. He pushed past Amoz and stood
shoulder to shoulder with his oathbrother.

Jormanric sat sprawled in his chair. He was a big man, and the carved throne had been
made especially for him; its arms were notched with raid tallies and stained with ket. A
slave known as the dog-slave was chained to it; he used them to taste his food for
poison, and none of them ever lasted long. This one was new, taken on the last raid, a
huddle of rags and tangled hair. The Winglord wore a metallic warcoat and his hair was
long and greasy, plaited and knotted with charms. Seven heavy skull-head rings were
squeezed on his thick fingers.

He eyed the Comitatus with a hooded glare.

\"A good raid, people. Food and raw metal. Enough for everyone's share to be plentiful.\"

A buzz from the room. But everyone meant only the Comitatus; the hangers-on would live
on the scraps.

\"And yet not as profitable as it might have been. Some fool annoyed the Prison.\" He spat
out the ket and took another piece from the ivory box at his elbow, folding it carefully into
his cheek. \"Two men were killed.\" He chewed slowly, eyes fixed on Finn. \"And a hostage
was taken.\"


Finn opened his mouth, but Keiro trod firmly on his foot. It was never a good idea to
interrupt Jormanric. He spoke slowly,

36
with irritating pauses, but his appearance of stupidity was deceptive.

A thin sliver of red spittle hung on Jormanric's beard. He said, \"Explain, Finn.\"

Finn swallowed, but Keiro answered, his voice cool. \"Wing-lord, my oathbrother took a
great risk back there. The Civics could easily not have stopped or even slowed. Because
of him we have enough food for days. The woman was a whim of the moment, a small
reward. But of course the Comitatus is yours, the decision yours. She means nothing, one
way or the other.\"

The of course was a silken sarcasm. Jormanric didn't stop chewing; Finn couldn't tell
whether the needle-stab of such a veiled threat had even registered.

Then he saw the Maestra. She was standing at the side, guarded, chains linking her
hands. There was dirt on her face, and her hair was coming undone. She must have been
terrified, but she stood tall, her gaze on Keiro and then, icily, on him. He couldn't meet that
scorn. He looked down, but Keiro nudged him and at once he forced himself upright,
outstaring them all. To seem weak, to look doubtful here, was to be finished. He could
never trust any of them, except Keiro. And then only because of the oath.

Standing arrogantly he returned Jormanric's glare.

\"How long have you been with us?\" the Winglord demanded.

\"Three years.\"

\"Not an innocent anymore, then. The blankness has gone

37
from your eyes. Y no longer jump at screams. Y no longer sob when the lights go out.\"
                 ou                           ou

The Comitatus tittered. Someone said, \"He hasn't killed anyone yet.\"

\"About time he did,\" Amoz muttered.

Jormanric nodded, the metal in his hair clinking. \"Maybe that's so.\" His eyes watched


Finn, and Finn stared straight back, because this was a bleary mask the Winglord wore,
a bloated, slow disguise over his shrewd cruelty. He knew what was coming now; when
Jormanric said, almost sleepily, \"Y could kill this woman,\" he didn't even blink.
                                   ou

\"I could, lord. But I'd rather make some profit. I heard them call her Maestra.\"

Jormanric raised a ket-red eyebrow. \"Ransom?\"

\"I'm sure they'd pay. Those trucks were heavy with goods.\" He paused, not needing Keiro
to tell him not to say too much. For a moment the fear shivered back, but he fought it
down. Any ransom would mean Jormanric would take a share. Surely it would sway him.
His greed was legendary.

The cell was dim, its candles guttering. Jormanric poured a cup of wine, tipped a splash
down for the small dog-creature, and watched it lap. Not until the slave sat back,
unharmed, did he drink himself. Then he raised his hand and turned it outward to show
the seven rings. \"Do you see these, boy? These rings contain lives. Lives I stole. Each
one of them was once an enemy, killed slowly, tormented in agony. Each one of them is

38
trapped here in a loop around my fingers. Their breath, their energy, their strength, drawn
out of them and held for me, until I need it. Nine lives a man can live, Finn, moving from
one to another, fending off death. My father did it, I'll do it. But as yet I only have seven.\"

The Comitatus eyed one another. At the back women whispered; some strained to see
the rings over the heads of the crowd. The silver skulls shimmered in the drug-laden air;
one winked at Finn, crookedly. He bit his dry lips and tasted ket; it was salty as blood,
made blurs swim in the corners of his eyes. Sweat soaked his back. The chamber was
unbearably hot; high in the rafters rats peered down, and a bat flicked out and back into
the darkness. Unnoticed, in one corner, three children dug in the pile of grain.

Jormanric heaved himself up. He was a huge man, a head higher than anyone else. He
looked down at Finn. \"A loyal man would offer this woman's life to his leader.\"

Silence.

There was no way out. Finn knew he would have to do it. He glanced at the Maestra. She
looked back, pale, her face gaunt.

But Keiro's cool voice broke the tension. \"A woman's life, lord? A creature of moods and
folly, a frail, helpless thing?\"


She didn't look helpless. She looked furious, and Finn cursed her for it. Why couldn't she
sob and beg and whimper! As if she sensed him, she dropped her head, but every inch of
her was stiff with pride.

39
Keiro waved a graceful hand. \"Not much strength for a man to covet, but if you want it, its
yours.\"

This was too dangerous. Finn was appalled. No one teased Jormanric. No one made him
look ridiculous. He wouldn't be so far gone on ket not to feel that thrust. If you want it. If
you're that desperate. Some of the warband understood. Zoma and Amoz exchanged
covert smiles.

Jormanric glowered. He looked at the woman and she glared back. Then he spat out the
red weed and reached for his sword.

\"I'm not as choosy as preening boys,\" he snarled.

Finn stepped forward. For a moment he wanted only to drag the woman away, but Keiro
had his arm in a grip of iron and Jormanric had turned to the Maestra; his sword was at
her neck, the sharp point whitening the delicate skin under her chin, straining her head
upward. It was over. Whatever she knew, Finn thought bitterly, he would never find it out
now.

A door slammed at the back.

An acid voice snapped, \"Her life is worthless, man. Give her to the boy. Anyone who lies
down before death is either a fool or a visionary. Either way, he deserves his reward.\"

The crowd parted hastily. A small man strode through, his clothes the dark green of the
Sapienti. He was old but upright, and even the Comitatus moved aside for him. He came
and stood by Finn; Jormanric looked down at him heavily.

40
\"Gildas. What does it matter to you?\"

\"Do as I say.\" The old man's voice was harsh; he spoke as if to a child. \"Y get your last
                                                                           ou'll
two lives soon enough. But she\"--he jerked his thumb at the woman--\"won't be one of
them.\"

Anyone else would be dead. Anyone else would have been hauled out and hung down the


shaft by his heels while rats ate his insides. But after a second Jormanric lowered the
sword. \"Y promise me.\"
         ou

\"I promise you.\"

\"The promises of the Wise should not be broken.\" The old man said, \"They won't be.\"

Jormanric looked at him. Then he sheathed the sword. \"Take her.\"

The woman gasped.

Gildas stared at her irritably. When she didn't move, he grabbed her arm and pulled her
near. \"Get her out of here,\" he muttered.

Finn hesitated, but Keiro moved at once, pushing the woman hastily through the crowd.

The old mans grip, fast as a claw, caught Finn's arm. \"Was there a vision?\"

\"Nothing important.\"

\"I'll be the judge of that.\" Gildas looked after Keiro, then back. His small black eyes were
alert; they moved with a restless intelligence. \"I want every detail, boy.\" He glanced down
at the bird-mark on Finn's wrist. Then he let go.

41
Instantly Finn pushed through the crowd and out.

The woman was waiting out in the Den, ignoring Keiro. She turned and stalked in front of
Finn back to the tiny cell in the corner and he motioned the guard away with one jerk of his
head.

The Maestra turned. \"What sort of Scum hole is this?\" she hissed.

\"Listen. You're alive ...\"

\"No thanks to you.\" She drew herself up; she was taller than he was, and her anger was
venomous. \"Whatever you want from me, you can forget it. Y murderers can rot in hell.\"
                                                           ou

Behind him, Keiro leaned on the doorframe, grinning. \"Some people have absolutely no
gratitude,\" he said.

Finally, when all was ready, Manor convened the council of the Sapienti and asked for
volunteers. They must be prepared to leave

family and friends forever. To turn their backs on the green grass, the trees, the light of the
sun.

Never again to see the stars. I

\"We are the Wise,\" he said. \"The responsibility for success is ours. We must send our

his fear that it would be empty. I He opened the door. Seventy men and women were
waiting for him. In great ceremony, they

entered the Prison.

They were never seen again.

--Tales of the Steel Wolf

***

That evening the Warden held a dinner for his honored guest.

The long table was dressed with a magnificent service of silver, the goblets and plates
engraved with linked swans. Claudia wore a dress of red silk with a lace bodice and sat
opposite Lord

43
Evian, while her father at the head of the table ate sparingly and spoke quietly, his calm
gaze moving over the nervous guests.

All their neighbors and tenants had obeyed the summons. And that's what it was, Claudia
thought grimly, because when the Warden of Incarceron invited, there was no refusal.
Even Mistress Sylvia, who must be nearly two hundred, flirted and made mincing
conversation with the bored young lord next to her.


As Claudia watched, the young lord carefully stifled a yawn. He caught her eye. She
smiled at him sweetly. Then she winked and he stared. She knew she shouldn't tease
him; he was one of her father's attendants, and the Wardens daughter would be far above
him. Still, she was bored too.

After the endless courses of fish and peacock and roast boar and sweetmeats, there was
dancing, the musicians up in a candlelit gallery above the smoky hall. Ducking under the
raised arms of the long line of dancers she wondered suddenly if the instruments were
accurate--surely violas were from a later period? That came of leaving details to Ralph.
The old retainer was an excellent servant, but his research was sometimes hurried. When
her father wasn't here, she didn't care. But the Warden was precise about detail.

It was <<well after midnight|13>> when she finally saw the last guests to their carriage and stood
alone on the steps of the manor. Behind her, two link-boys waited sleepily, their torches
guttering in the breeze.

44
\"Go to bed,\" she said without turning. The glimmer and crackle of the flames faded. The
night was quiet.

As soon as they were gone, she ran down the steps and under the arch of the gatehouse
to the bridge over the moat, breathing the deep stillness of the warm night. Bats flitted
over the sky; watching them, she tugged off the stiff ruff and the necklaces, and from
under the dress she stepped out of the stiffened petticoats and dumped them with relief
into the old disused privy below the bank.

Much better! They could stay there till tomorrow.

Her father had retired earlier. He had taken Lord Evian up to the library; perhaps they
were still there, talking money and settlements and discussing her future. And afterward,
when his guest was gone and all the house was silent, her father would pull back the black
velvet curtain at the end of the corridor and open the door of his study with its secret
combination, the one she had tried for months to work out. He would disappear in there
for hours, perhaps for days. As far as she knew, no one else ever entered the room. No
servant, no technician, not even Medlicote, the secretary. She herself had never been in.

Well, not yet.

Glancing up at the north turret she saw, as she'd expected, a tiny flame in the window of
the topmost room. She walked quickly to the door in the wall, opened it, and climbed the
stairs in the dark.


45
He thought of her as a tool. A thing he had made ... bred, was his word. She tightened her
lips, her fingers groping over the cold greasy wall. Long ago she had come to know his
ruthlessness was so complete that to survive she would have to match it.

Did her father love her? As she slowed for breath on a stone landing she laughed, a quiet
amusement. She had no idea. Did she love him? She certainly feared him. He smiled at
her, had sometimes picked her up when she was small, held her hand on grand
occasions, admired her dresses. He had never denied her anything, had never struck her
or been angry, even when she'd had tantrums and broken the string of pearls he'd given
her, or ridden off for days to the mountains. And yet as far back as she could remember
the calmness of his cold gray eyes had terrified her, the dread of his displeasure hung
over her.

Beyond the third landing the stairs were cluttered with bird droppings. They were certainly
real. She picked her way through, groped along the corridor to the bend, climbed another
three steps, and came to the iron-barred door. Grasping the ring, she turned it softly and
peered in. \"Jared? It's me.\"

The room was dark. A solitary candle burned on the sill, its flame guttering in the draft. All
around the turret, the windows had been rolled back, in a disregard of protocol that would
have given Ralph kittens.

The observatory roof rose on steel beams so narrow, it

46
appeared to float. A great telescope had been wheeled to face the south; it bristled with
finderscopes and infrared readers and a small flickering monitor screen. Claudia shook
her head. \"Look at this! If the Queen's spy sees this, the fines will cripple us.

\"He won't. Not after the amount of cider he sank tonight.\"

At first she couldn't even find him. Then a shadow at the window moved and the darkness
resolved into a slender shape that straightened from the viewfinder. \"Take a look at this,
Claudia.\"

She felt her way across the room, between the cluttered tables, the astrolabe, the hanging
globes. Disturbed, a fox cub streaked to the sill.

He caught her arm and guided her to the telescope. \"Nebula f345. They call it the Rose.\"

When she looked in, she could see why. The creamy explosion of stars that filled the dim


circle of sky opened like the petals of a vast flower, millennia of light-years across. A
flower of stars and quasars, worlds and black holes, its molten heart pulsing with gaseous
clouds.

\"How far away is it?\" she murmured.

\"A thousand light-years.\"

\"So what I'm looking at is a thousand years old?\"

\"Maybe more.\"

Dazzled, she withdrew her eye from the lens. When she turned to face him, tiny flickers of
light blurred her sight,

47
played, over his tangle of dark hair, his narrow face and spare figure, the unlaced tunic
under his robe.

\"He's brought the wedding forward,\" she said.

Her tutor frowned. \"Y Of course.\"
                     es.

\"Y knew?\"
  ou

\"I knew the Earl had been expelled from the Academy.\" He moved into the candlelight and
she saw his green eyes catch the glimmer. \"They sent me a message this morning. I
guessed this might be the result.\"

Annoyed, she brushed a pile of papers off the couch onto the floor and sat wearily,
swinging her feet up. \"Well, you were right. We've got two days. Its not going to be
enough, is it?\"

He came and sat opposite her. \"To finalize tests on the device, no.\"

\"Y look tired, Jared Sapiens,\" she said.
  ou

\"So do you, Claudia Arlexa.\"

There were shadows under his eyes and his skin was pale. Gently she said, \"Y should
                                                                            ou
get more sleep.\"


He shook his head. \"While the universe is out there wheeling over me? Impossible, lady.\"

She knew it was the pain that kept him awake. Now he called the fox cub and it came and
jumped on his lap, rubbing and butting his chest and face. Absently he stroked its tawny
back.

\"Claudia, I've been thinking about your theory. I want you to tell me about how your
engagement was arranged.\"

48
\"Well, you were here, weren't you?\"

He smiled his gentle smile. \"It may seem to you as if I've been here forever, but I actually
came just after your fifth birthday. The Warden sent to the Academy for the best Sapient
available. His daughter's tutor could be nothing less.\"

Reminded of her father's words, she frowned. Jared looked at her sideways. \"Did I say
something?\"

\"Not you.\" She reached out to the fox but it turned away from her, tucking itself tidily into
Jared's arm. So she said sourly, \"Well, it depends which engagement you mean. I've had
two.\"

\"The first.\"

\"I can't. I was five. I don't remember it.\"

\"But they betrothed you to the King's son. To Giles.\"

\"As you said, the Warden's daughter doesn't get second best.\" She jumped up and
prowled around the observatory, picking up papers restlessly.

His green eyes watched her. \"He was a handsome little boy, I remember.\"

Her back to him, she said, \"Y Every year after that the Court painter would send a little

sturdy face. He would have been a fine man.\" She turned. \"I only really met him once.
When we went to his seventh birthday party at Court. I remember a boy sitting on a throne
too big for him. They had to put a box for his feet. He had big brown eyes. He was
allowed to kiss me on the cheek, and he was so

embarrassed.\" She smiled, remembering. \"Y know how boys go really red. Well, he

bunch of roses. I kept them till they fell to pieces.\"

She went to the telescope and sat astride the stool, hitching her dress up to her knees.

The Sapient stroked the cub, watching Claudia adjust the eyepiece and gaze through it.
\"Y liked him.\"
  ou

She shrugged. \"You'd never have thought he was the Heir. He was just like any other boy.
Y I liked him. We could have gotten along.\"

\"But not his brother, the Earl? Not even then?\"

Her fingers turned the fine dials. \"Oh him! That twisted grin. No, I knew what he was like
straightaway. He cheated at chess and tipped the board over if he was losing. He
screamed at the servants, and some of the other girls told me things. When my ... when
the Warden came home and told me Giles had died so suddenly ... that all the plans
would have to be changed, I was furious.\" She sat up and turned quickly. \"What I swore to
you then still goes. Master, I can't marry Caspar. I won't marry him. I detest him.\"

\"Calm down, Claudia.\"

\"How can I!\" She was on her feet now, pacing. \"I feel as though everything's crashed in on
me! I thought we'd have time, but a few days! We have to act, Jared. I have to get into the
study, even if your machine is untested.\"

50
He nodded. Then he lifted the cub off and dumped it on the floor, ignoring its snarl of
dismay. \"Come and look at this.\"

Beside the telescope the monitor nickered. He touched the control and the screen rippled
with words in the Sapient tongue of which he had never, for all her pleading, taught her a
word. As he scrolled through in a bat whipped through the opened room and vanished
back into the night. Claudia glanced around. \"We should be careful.\"

''I'll shut the windows in a moment.\" Absently Jared stopped the text. \"Here.\" His delicate
fingers touched a key and the translation appeared. \"Look. This is a fragment of a burned
draft of a letter written by the Queen, retrieved and copied by a Sapient spy in the Palace,
three years ago. Y asked me to find anything that might support your absurd theory--\"
                     ou

\"Its not absurd.\"


\"Well, your unlikely theory, then, that Giles's death was--\"

\"Murder.\"

\"Suspiciously sudden. Anyway, I found this.\" She almost pushed him aside in her
eagerness. \"How did you get it?\"

He raised an eyebrow. \"Secrets of the Wise, Claudia. Let's just say a friend in the
Academy went searching in the archives.\" As he went to the windows she read the text
eagerly.

.. As for the arrangement we spoke of before, it is unfortunate, but great changes often
require great sacrifices. G has been kept aloof from others since

51
his father died; the people's grief will be real but short-lived and we can contain it. It barely
needs saying that your part will be beyond value to us. When my son is King I can
promise you all I...

She hissed in annoyance. \"Is that it?\"

\"The Queen has always been very careful. We have at least seventeen people in the
Palace, but evidence for anything is rare.\" He slid the last window down, closing out the
stars. \"That took a lot of finding.\"

\"But it's so clear!\" Eagerly she read it again. \"I mean ... grief will be real ... When my son
is King ...\"

As he came over and lit the lamp she looked up at him and her eyes were bright with
excitement. \"Master, it proves she killed him. She murdered the King's Heir, the last of the
Havaarna dynasty, so that his half brother, her own son, could have the throne.\"

For a moment he was still. Then the flame steadied and he looked up at her. Her heart
sank. \"Y don't think so.\"
        ou

\"I thought I taught you better than that, Claudia. Be rigorous in your argument. All this
proves is that she intended her son to be King. Not that she did anything about it.\"

\"But this G--\"

\"Could be anyone with that initial.\" Remorselessly he stared her down.


\"Y don't think that! Y can't...\"
  ou                  ou

\"It's not what I think that matters, Claudia. If you make an

52
accusation like this, you need proof so complete, there can be no question of any doubt.\"
He eased himself into a chair and winced. \"The Prince died in a fall from his horse.
Doctors certified it. His body lay in state in the Great Hall of the Palace for three days.
Thousands filed past it. Y own father ...\"
                          our

\"She must have had him killed. She was jealous of him.\"

\"She never showed any sign of that. And the body was cremated. There's no way of telling
now.\" He sighed. \"Don't you see how this will look, Claudia? Y  ou'll just be a spoiled girl
who doesn't like her arranged marriage and is willing to rake up any sort of scandal to get
out of it.\"

She snapped, \"I don't care! What--\"

He sat up. \"Quiet!\"

She froze. The fox cub was on its feet, ears pricked. A whisper of draft gusted under the
door.

Instantly they both moved. Claudia was at the window in seconds, darkening the glass;
turning, she saw Jared's fingers on the control panel for the sensors and alarms he had
fitted on the stairs. Small red lights danced.

\"What?\" she whispered. \"What was it?\"

For a moment he didn't answer. Then his voice was low. \"Something was there. Tiny.
Perhaps an eavesdropping device.\"

Her heart thudded. \"My father?\"

\"Who knows? Maybe Lord Evian. Maybe Medlicote.\"

They stood a long time in the dimness, listening. The night was still. Somewhere a distant
dog barked. They could hear the

53


faint baas of the sheep in the meadow beyond the moat, and an owl, hunting. After a while
a rustle in the room told them the cub had curled back up to sleep. The candle guttered
and went out. In the silence she said, \"I'm going into the study tomorrow. If I can't find out
about Giles, at least I can learn something about Incarceron.\"

\"With him in the house ...\"

\"It's my last chance.\"

Jared ran long fingers through his untidy hair. \"Claudia, you must go. We'll talk about this
tomorrow.\" Then all at once his face was white, his hands flat on the table. He leaned over
and breathed hard.

She came around the telescope quietly. \"Master?\"

\"My medication. Please.\"

She grabbed the candle, shook it back into light and cursed the Era for the hundredth
time. \"Where ... I can't find it...\"

\"The blue box. By the astrolabe.\"

She groped, grabbing pens, papers, books, the box. Inside was the small syringe and the
ampules; fitting one on carefully, she brought it to him. \"Shall I ...?\"

He smiled gently. \"No. I can manage.\"

She brought the lamp closer; he rolled his sleeve up and she saw the innumerable scars
around the vein. He made the injection carefully, the microinfuser barely touching the skin,
and as he replaced it in the box, his voice was calm and steadier.

54
\"Thank you, Claudia. And don't look so scared. This condition has been killing me for ten
years and it's in no hurry. It will probably take another ten to finish me off.\"

She couldn't smile. Times like this terrified her. She said, \"Shall I send someone ...?\"

\"No, no. I'll go to bed and sleep.\" Handing her the candle, he said, \"Be careful how you go
down the stairs.\"

She nodded, reluctant, and crossed the room. At the door she stopped and turned. He
stood as if he had been waiting for that, closing the box, the dark green of the Sapient


coat with its high collar glinting with strange iridescence.

\"Master, that letter. Do you know who it was written to?\"

He looked up unhappily. \"Y And it makes it even more urgent that we get into his study.\"
                          es.

The candle flickered as she breathed in dismay. \"Y mean ...\"
                                                  ou

\"I'm afraid so, Claudia. The Queen's letter was addressed to your father.\"

***

There was a man and his name was Sapphique. Where he came from is a mystery.
Some say he was born of the Prison, grown from its stored components. Some say he
came from Outside, because he alone of men returned there. Some say he was not a
man at all, but a creature from those shining sparks lunatics see in dreams and name
the stars. Some say he was a liar and a fool.

Legends of Sapphique

***

\"Y have to eat something.\" Finn scowled down at the woman. She sat facing resolutely
  ou
away from him, her hood over her face.

She didn't say a word.

He dumped the plate and sat on the wooden bench next to her, rubbing his tired eyes with
the palms of his hands. Around them the noise of the Comitatus at breakfast rang and
clattered. It was an hour after Lightson when the doors that were not broken had sprung
open with that great crack of sound it had taken him years to grow used to. He looked up
at the rafters and saw one of the Prison's Eyes watching curiously; the small red light
stared unblinkingly down.

56
Finn frowned. No one else took any notice of the Eyes, but he loathed them. Getting up,
he turned his back on it. \"Come with me,\" he snapped. \"Somewhere quieter.\"


He walked quickly, not turning to see if she followed. He couldn't wait any longer for Keiro.
Keiro had gone to see about their share of the plunder because Keiro always saw to
those things. Finn had realized long ago that his oathbrother was almost certainly
cheating him, but he could never bring himself to care that much. Now, ducking under an
archway, he came out at the top of a wide staircase that curved elegantly down into
darkness.

Out here the noise was muted and echoed strangely in the cavernous spaces. A few
scrawny slave girls hurried past, looking terrified, as they always did when one of the
Comitatus even glanced at them. From the invisible roof vast chains hung in loops like
great bridges, each link thicker than a man. In some of them the uber-spiders had nested,
creaming the metal with sticky web. Half a desiccated dog hung head-down from one
cocoon.

When he turned, the Maestra was there.

He stepped forward, his voice low. \"Listen to me. I had to bring you. I don't want to hurt
you. But back there, in the transitway, you said something. Y said you recognized this.\"
                                                             ou

Dragging back his sleeve, he held his wrist out to her.

She flicked one disdainful glance at it. \"I was stupid to feel sorry for you.\"

57
Anger rose in him but he held it down. \"I need to know. I have no idea who I am or what
this mark means. I don't remember anything. \"

Now she did look at him. \"You're a cell-born?\"

The name annoyed him. \"That's what they call it.\"

She said, \"I have heard of them but have never seen one before.\"

Finn glanced away. Talking about himself disturbed him. But he sensed her interest; it
might be his only chance. He sat down on the top step, feeling the cold chipped stone
under his hands. Staring out into the dark, he said, \"I just woke up. That was all. It was
black and silent and my mind was totally empty and I had no idea who or where I was.\"

He couldn't tell her about the panic, the terrible screaming panic that had surged up and
made him beat and bruise himself against the walls of the tiny airless cell.

Couldn't say that he had sobbed himself into a vomiting fit; that he had cowered in the


corner shaking for days--the corner of his mind, the corner of the cell, because each was
the same and each was empty.

Perhaps she guessed; she came and sat by him, her dress rustling.

\"How old were you?\"

He shrugged. \"How do I know? It was three years ago.\"

\"About fifteen then. Young enough. I've heard some of them are born insane, and already
aged. Y were lucky.\"
       ou

58
The barest sympathy. He caught it despite the harshness of her voice, remembered her
concern before the ambush. She was a woman who felt for other people. That was her
weakness and he would have to play on it. As Keiro had taught him.

\"I was insane, Maestra. Sometimes I still am. Y can't imagine how it is to have no past,
                                                 ou
no idea of your name, where you came from, where you are, what you are. I found I was
dressed in a gray overall with a name printed on it, and a number. The name was FINN,
the number 0087/2314.I read those numbers over and over. I learned them, scratched
them on the stones with sharp fragments, cut them in letters of blood on my arms. I
crawled around the floor like an animal, filthy, my hair growing long. Day and night were
lights that came on and went off. Food slid in on a tray through the wall; waste went out the
same way. Once or twice I made an effort and tried to scrabble through the hole, but it
snapped shut too quickly. Most of the time I lay in a sort of stupor. And when I slept, I
dreamed terrible dreams.\"

She was watching him. He sensed she was wondering how much was true. Her hands
were strong and capable; she worked hard with them, he could see, but she had
reddened the nails too. Quietly he said, \"I don't know your name.\"

My name doesn't matter.\" She kept her gaze level. \"I've heard of these cells. The Sapienti
call them the Wombs of Incarceron. In them the Prison creates new people; they emerge
as infants or adults, whole, not like the halfmen. But only the young ones survive. The
Children of Incarceron.\"

59
\"Something survived. I'm not sure it was me.\" He wanted to tell her about the nightmares
of fractured images, the times he woke even now in a panic of forgetfulness, groping for
his name, where he was, until Keiro's quiet breathing reassured him. Instead he said,
\"And there was always the Eye. At first I didn't know what it was, only noticed it in the


night, a tiny red point glowing near the ceiling. Slowly I realized it was there all the time,
came to imagine it was watching me, that there was no escape from it. I began to think
there was an intelligence behind it, curious and cruel. I hated it, squirmed away, curled up
with my face against the damp stones not to see it. After a while, though, I couldn't stop
glancing around to check it was still there. It became a sort of comfort. I got scared it
would go away, couldn't stand the thought of it leaving me. That was when I started to talk
to it.\"

He had not told even Keiro this. Her quietness, her closeness, that smell of soap and
comfort, he must have known something like them once, because they drew out his
words, hard now, reluctant.

\"Have you ever talked to Incarceron, Maestra? In the darkest night when everyone else is
asleep? Prayed and whispered to it? Begged it to end the nightmare of nothingness?
That's what the cell-born do. Because there is no one else in the world. It is the world.\"

His voice choked. Careful not to look at him she said, \"I have never been that alone. I
have a husband. I have children.\"

60
He swallowed, feeling her anger puncture his self-pity. Perhaps she was working on him
too. He bit his lip and pushed the hair from his eyes, knowing they were wet and not
caring. \"Well, you are lucky, Maestra, because I had no one but the Prison, and the Prison
has a heart of stone. But gradually I began to understand that it was huge and that I lived
inside it, that I was a tiny, lost creature, that it had eaten me. I was its child and it was my
father, vast beyond understanding. And when I was sure of that, so sure that I was numb
with silence, the door opened.\"

\"So there was a door!\" Her voice was edged with sarcasm.

\"There was. All the time. It was tiny and it had been invisible in the gray wall. For a long
time, hours perhaps, I just watched the rectangle of darkness, fearing what might come in,
the faint sounds and smells from beyond. Finally I summoned up the courage to crawl to it
and peer out.\" He knew she was looking at him now. He gripped his hands together and
went on steadily. \"The only thing outside the door was a tubular white corridor lit from
above. It ran straight in either direction, and there were no openings in it, and no end. It
narrowed eternally into dimness. I dragged myself up--\"

\"Y could manage to walk, then?\"
  ou

\"Barely. I had little strength\"

She smiled, humorless. He hurried on. \"I stumbled on till my legs wouldn't hold me, but the


corridor was as straight and featureless as before. The lights went out and only the Eyes

61
watched me. When I left one behind I found another ahead, and that comforted me,
because stupidly I thought Incarceron was watching over me, leading me to safety. I slept
where I fell that night. At Lightson there was a plateful of some bland white food by my
head. I ate it and walked on. For two days I followed that corridor until I grew convinced I
was walking on the spot, getting nowhere, that it was the corridor that was moving,
streaming past me, that I was on some terrible treadmill and would walk forever. Then I
slammed into a stone wall. I beat on it in despair. It opened, and I fell out. Into dark-ness.\"

He was silent so long she said, \"And found yourself here?\"

She was fascinated, despite herself. Finn shrugged. \"When I came around I was lying on
my back in a wagon with a pile of grain and a few dozen rats. The Comitatus had picked
me up on one of their patrols. They could have enslaved me or cut my throat. The Sapient
was the one who talked them out of it. Though Keiro takes the credit.\"

She laughed harshly. \"I'm sure he does. And you never tried to find this tunnel again?\"

\"I tried. I've never succeeded.\"

\"But to stay with these ... animals.\"

\"There was no one else. And Keiro needed an oathbrother; you can't survive here without
one. He thought my... visions ... -might be useful, and maybe he recognized I was reckless
enough for him. We cut our hands and mixed blood and crawled under

62
an arch of chains together. It's what they do here--a sacred bond. We guard each other. If
one dies, the other takes revenge for him. It can never be broken.\"

She glanced around. \"He's not a brother I would choose. And the Sapient?\"

Finn shrugged. \"He believes my flashes of memory are sent by Sapphique. To help us
find the way out.\" She was silent. Quietly he said, \"Now you know my story, tell me about
the skin-mark. Y spoke of a crystal...\"
                ou

\"I offered you kindness.\" Her lips were tight. \"In return I'm kidnapped and likely to be
murdered by a thug who believes he can store lives up for himself. In silver rings!\"


\"Don't joke about that,\" Finn said uneasily. \"It's dangerous.

\"Y believe it?\" She sounded astonished.
  ou

\"It's true. His father lived for two hundred years ...\"

\"Total rubbish!\" Her scorn was absolute. \"His father may well have lived to old age, but
probably because he always took the best of the food and clothing, and left any danger to
his stupid followers. Like you.\" She turned and glared at him. \"Y played on my
                                                                      ou
compassion. Y  ou're still doing it.\"

\"I'm not. I put myself at risk to save you. Y saw that.\"
                                             ou

The Maestra shook her head. Then she caught his arm and before he could pull away,
pushed the ragged sleeve up.

His dirty skin was bruised but unscarred.

\"What happened to the cuts you made?\"

63
\"They healed,\" he said quietly.


She let go of his sleeve in disgust and turned away. \"What will happen to me?\"

\"Jormanric will send a messenger to your people. The ransom will be your weight in
treasure.\"

\"And if they won't pay it?\"

\"Surely they will.\"

\"If they won't?\" She turned. \"What then?\"

Unhappy, he shrugged. \"Y end up a slave here. Processing the ore, making weapons.
                            ou
It's dangerous. Little food. He works them to death.\"

She nodded. Looking straight out into the dark emptiness of the stairway, she took a
breath and he saw its mistiness in the cold air. Then she said, \"In that case we make a
deal. I get them to bring the crystal and you release me. Tonight.\"

His heart thumped. But he said, \"It's not that easy ...\"

\"It is that easy. Otherwise I give you nothing, Finn Cell-born. Nothing. Ever.\"

She turned and her dark eyes watched him steadily. \"I am the Maestra of my people and
will never submit to Scum.\"

She was brave, he thought, but she had no idea. In less than an hour Jormanric could
have her screaming to give him any-thing he wanted. But Finn had seen that too often,
and it sickened him.

\"They must bring it with the ransom.\"

\"I don't want them to have to. I want you to take me back

64
to where you found me, today, before lockup. Once we get there--\"

\"I can't.\" He stood up abruptly. Behind them the clang of the signal bell sent a flock of the
sooty doves that infested the Den flapping out into the dark. \"They'd skin me alive!\"

\"Y problem.\" She smiled sourly. \"I'm sure you can invent some story. Y
  our                                                                 ou're an expert.\"

\"All I've told you is true.\" Suddenly he needed her to believe him.


She put her face close to him and her eyes were fierce. \"Like the hard-luck tale at the
ambush?\"

Finn stared back. Then he dropped his gaze. \"I can't just free you. But I swear, if you get
me this crystal, you'll get home safely.\"

For a moment the silence was icy. She turned her back on him and hugged herself. He
knew she was about to tell him. Her voice was grim.

\"All right. A while ago my people broke into a deserted hall. It had been bricked up from
the inside, maybe for centuries. The air was foul. When we crawled in we found some
clothes gone to dust, some jewelry, a skeleton of a man.\"

\"So?\" He waited, intent.

She looked at him sidelong. \"In his hand was a small cylindrical artifact made of crystal or
heavy glass. Inside it is a hologram of an eagle with open wings. In one claw it holds a
sphere. Around its neck, like yours, it wears a crown.\"

65
For a moment he couldn't speak. Before he could draw breath she said, \"Y must swear
                                                                        ou
my safety.\"

He wanted to grab her hand and run with her, now, back to the shaft and climb up and up
to the transitway. But he said, \"They have to pay the ransom. I can't do anything now if we
tried, we'd both be killed. Keiro too.\"

The Maestra nodded wearily. \"It will cost everything we have to make my weight in
treasure.\"

He swallowed. \"Then I swear to you--on my life, on Keiro's life--that if they do, no harm will
come to you. That I'll make certain the exchange is honest. That's all I can do.\"

The Maestra drew herself up. \"Even if you were once cell-born,\" she breathed, \"you are
fast becoming Scum. And you're as much a prisoner here as I am.\"

Without waiting for his answer, she turned and swept back into the Den. Slowly, Finn
rubbed a hand around the back of his neck, feeling the damp of sweat. He realized his
body was a knot of tension; he made himself breathe out. Then he froze.

A dark figure was sitting ten steps down the dark stairs, lounging against the balustrade.


Finn scowled. \"Don't you trust me?\"

\"Y ou're a child, Finn. An innocent.\" Keiro turned a gold coin over thoughtfully between his
fingers. Then he said, \"Don't swear on my life again.\"

\"I didn't mean ...\"

\"Didn't you?\" With a sudden jerk his oathbrother stood,

66
strode up the steps, and stood face-to-face with him. \"Fine. But remember this. Y and I ou
are joined by sworn contract. If Jormanric finds out you're double-crossing him in any way,
we both end up as the last of his pretty little rings. But I don't intend or die, Finn. And you
owe me. I brought you into this warband, when your head was empty and you were stupid
with fear.\" He shrugged. \"Sometimes I wonder why I bothered.\"

Finn swallowed. \"Y bothered because no one else would put up with your pride, your
                  ou
arrogance, and your thieving ways. Y bothered because you saw I would be as reckless
                                    ou
as you. And when you take on Jormanric you'll need me at your back.\"

Keiro raised a sardonic eyebrow. \"What makes you think--\"

\"Y will one day. Maybe soon. So help me in this, brother, and I'll help you.\" He frowned.
  ou
\"Please. It means a lot to me.\"

\"You're obsessed with this stupid idea that you came from Outside.\"

\"Not stupid. Not to me.\"

\"Y and the Sapient. A pair of fools together.\" When he didn't answer, Keiro laughed
  ou
harshly. \"Y were born in Incarceron, Finn. Accept it. No one comes in from Outside. No
            ou
one Escapes! Incarceron is sealed. We were all born here and we'll all die here. Y  our
mother dumped you and you can't remember her. The bird-scar is just some tribemark.
Forget it.\"

He wouldn't. He couldn't. He said stubbornly, \"I wasn't born here. I can't remember being a
child, but I was one. I

67
can't remember how I got here, but I wasn't bred out of some artificial womb of wires and
chemicals. And this\"--he held up his wrist--\"will prove it.\"


Keiro shrugged. \"Sometimes I think you're still out of your head.\"

Finn scowled. Then he stalked back up the stairs. At the top he had to step over
something crouched there in the dark. It looked like Jormanric's dog-slave, straining at
the end of its chain to reach a bowl of water that some joker had placed just out of reach.
Finn kicked the bowl nearer and strode on.

The slave's chain clanked.

Through its tangle of hair, its small eyes watched him walk away.

It was decided from the beginning that the location of Incarceron should be known only
to the Warden. All criminals, undesirables, political extremists, degenerates, lunatics
would

be transported there. The Gate would be sealed and the Experiment commence. It was
vital

that nothing should disturb the delicate balance of Incarceron's programming, which
would

provide everything needed--education, balanced

diet, exercise, spiritual welfare, and purposeful

work--to create a paradise. ;

One hundred and fifty years have passed.

The Warden reports that progress is excellent.

\"That was so delicious!\" Lord Evian wiped his plump lips with a white napkin. \"Y really
                                                                                ou
must let me have the receipt, my dear.\"

Claudia stopped tapping her nails on the cloth and smiled brightly. \"I'll have someone
copy it for you, my lord.\"

Her father was watching from the head of the table, the crumbs of his ascetic breakfast of
two dry rolls gathered nearly in a pile on the side of his plate. Like her he had finished at

69
least half an hour ago, but his impatience was hidden with iron control. If he was
impatient. She didn't even know.

Now he said, \"His Lordship and I will ride out this morning, Claudia, and take a brief lunch
at <<one p.m.|5>> exactly. Afterward we will resume our negotiations.\"

Over my future, she thought, but only nodded, noticing the fat lord's dismay. He couldn't
be such a fool as he seemed or the Queen wouldn't have sent him, and though he tried
hard, a few shrewd comments had slipped out. But he was hardly a rider.

The Warden was aware of that. Her father had a grim humor.

As she stood he rose with her, meticulously polite, and drew the small gold watch from his
pocket. The timepiece gleamed. It was beautiful, digitally accurate, and totally out of Era.
It was his one eccentricity, the watch and the chain and the tiny silver cube that hung from
it.

He said, \"Perhaps you'd touch the bell, Claudia. I'm afraid we've kept you long enough
from your studies.\"

She went quickly to the green tassel by the hearth and he added without raising his head,
\"I spoke to Master Jared in the garden earlier. He looked very pale. How is his health
these days?\"

Her fingers froze a fraction from the bell. Then she pulled it firmly. \"He's well, sir. Very
well.\"

He put the watch away. \"I've been considering. Y won't need a tutor after your marriage,
                                                ou
and, besides, there are several

70


Sapienti at Court. Perhaps we should allow Jared to return to the Academy.\"

She wanted to stare at him in horror in the dim mirror, but that would have been what he
expected. So she kept her face bright and turned lightly. \"As you wish. I'd miss him, of
course. And we are in the middle of a fascinating study of the Havaarna Kings. He knows
everything there is to be known about them.\"

His gray eyes watched her closely.

If she said another word her dismay would show and it would decide him. A pigeon
fluttered on the tiles outside.

Lord Evian creaked to his feet. \"Well, if you do, Warden, I assure you some other family
will snap him up. Jared Sapiens is renowned through the Realm. He could name his fee.
Poet, philosopher, inventor, genius. Y should hold on to him, sir.\"
                                      ou

Claudia smiled in pleasant agreement but inside she was startled. It was as if the greasy
man in the blue silk suit knew what she couldn't say for herself. He smiled back, his small
eyes bright.

The Warden's lips were tight. \"I'm sure you're right. Shall we go, my lord?\"

Claudia dropped a curtsy. As her father followed Evian out and turned to close the double
doors, he met her eyes. Then the doors clicked shut.

She sighed in relief. Like a cat eyes a mouse, she thought. But all she said was, \"Now,
please.\"

Instantly paneling slid back; maids and men raced out and

71
began removing cups, plates, candelabra, centerpieces, glasses, napkins, kedgeree
dishes, fruit bowls. Windows snapped open and burned-out candles relit; the roaring fire
in the log-filled hearth vanished without a whiff of charred wood. Dust vaporized; curtains
changed color. The air sweetened itself with potpourri.

Leaving them to it, Claudia hurried out. She crossed the hall decorously holding her skirts,
then raced up the curved oak staircase and dived through the concealed door on the
landing, passing instantly from contrived luxury into the chilly gray corridors of the
servants' quarters, bare walls roped with wires and cables and powerpoints, small
camera screens and sonic scanners.


The back stairs were stone; she pattered up and opened the quilted door, and stepped
out into the luxurious, Era-perfect corridor.

Two steps took her across to her own bedroom.

The maids had already cleaned it. She double-locked the door, flipped on all the security
blocks, and crossed to the window.

Green and smooth, the lawns were beautiful in the summer sunshine. The gardener's boy,
Job, was wandering about with a sack and a spiked stick, stabbing stray leaves. She
couldn't make out the tiny music implant in his ear, but his jerky movements and sudden
struts made her grin. Though if the Warden saw him, he'd be sacked.

Turning, she slid back the drawer of her dressing table, took

72
out the minicom, and activated it. It flashed on and showed her a distorted echo of her
own face, grotesque in curved glass. Startled, she said, \"Master?\"

A shadow. Two vast fingers and a thumb came down and lifted the alembic away. Then
Jared sat down before the hidden receiver.

\"I'm here, Claudia.\"

\"Is everything set? They ride out in a few minutes.\"

His thin face darkened. \"I'm concerned about this. The disc may not work. We need trials
...\"

\"No time! I'm going in today. Right now.\"

He sighed. She knew he wanted to argue, but despite all their precautions, someone
might be listening; it was dangerous to say too much. Instead he murmured, \"Please be
careful.\"

\"As you've taught me, Master.\" For a brief second she thought about the Warden's threat
against him, but this wasn't the time. \"Start now,\" she said, and cut the link.

Her bedroom was dark mahogany; the great four-poster hung with red velvet, its tester
embroidered with the black swan singing. Behind it was what looked like a small garde-
robe set into the wall, but as she walked through the illusion it became an en-suite
bathroom with every luxury--there were limits even to the Warden's strictness on Protocol.


As she stood on the toilet seat and peeped out of the narrow window, sunlit dust swirled
in motes about her.

She could see the courtyard. Three horses were saddled; her

73
father was standing by one, both gloved hands resting on the reins, and with a
suppressed whoop of relief she saw that his secretary, the dark watchful man called
Medlicote, was climbing onto the gray mare. Behind, Lord Evian was being heaved into
the saddle by two sweating stable hands. Claudia wondered how much of his comic
awkwardness was an act, and whether he'd been prepared for real horses rather than
cyber-steeds. Evian and her father were playing an elaborate and deadly game of
manners and insults, irritation and etiquette. It bored her, but that was how things were at
Court.

The thought of a future lifetime of it turned her cold.

To hide from it she jumped down, and tugged off the elaborate dress. Underneath she
was wearing a dark jumpsuit. For a moment she glanced at herself in the mirror. Clothes
changed you. Long ago, King Endor had known that. That was why he had stopped Time,
imprisoned everyone in doublets and dresses, stiffed them in conformity and stiffness.

Now Claudia felt lithe and free. Dangerous, even. She stepped back up. They were riding
through the gatehouse. Her father paused and glanced toward Jared's tower. She smiled
secretly. She knew what he could see.

He could see her.

Jared had perfected the holo-image in the long nights of sleeplessness. When he had
shown her herself, sitting, talking, laughing, reading in the window seat of the sunny tower,
she had been fascinated and appalled.

74
\"That's not me!\"

He'd smiled. \"No one likes to see themselves from the outside.\"

She had seen a smug, pert creature, her face a mask of composure, every action
considered, every speech rehearsed. Superior and mocking.

\"Is that really how I am?\"


Jared had shrugged. \"It's an image, Claudia. Let's say its how you can appear.\"

Now, jumping down and running back into the bedroom, she watched the horses pace
elegantly over the mown lawns, Evian talking, her father silent. Job had vanished, and the
blue sky was mottled with high clouds.

They'd be gone at least an hour.

She took the small disc from her pocket, tossed it, caught it, put it back. Then she opened
her bedroom door and peered out.

The Long Gallery ran the length of the house. It was paneled in oak and lined with
portraits, books in cabinets, blue vases on pedestals. Above each door the bust of a
Roman emperor gazed sternly down from its bracket. Far down at the end sunlight made
brilliant slanting lozenges across the wall, and a suit of armor guarded the top of the stairs
like a rigid ghost.

She took a step, and the planks creaked. The boards were old, and she scowled,
because there was no way to turn that

75
off. There was nothing she could do about the busts either, but as she passed each
painting she touched the frame control and darkened them--after all, there were almost
certainly cameras in some of them. She held the disc gently in her hand; only once did it
give a discreet bleep of warning, and she already knew about that, a crisscross of faint
lines outside the study door, easily dissolved.

Claudia glanced back down the corridor. Far off in the house a door banged, a servant
called. Up here in the muffled luxury of the past, the air was fragrant with juniper and
rosemary, pomanders of crisp lavender in the laundry cupboard.

The study door was recessed in shadow. It was black, and looked like ebony; a bare
panel, except for the swan. Huge and malevolent, the bird stared down at her, neck
stretched in spitting defiance, wings wide. Its tiny eye glinted as though it were a diamond
or dark opal.

More likely a spyhole, she thought.

Tense, she lifted Jared's disc and held it carefully to the door; it clamped itself on with a
tiny metallic click.

The device hummed. A small whine emerged from it, changing tone and pitch frequently,


as if it chased the intricate combination of the lock up and down the scales of sound.
Jared had gone into patient explanations as to how it worked, but she hadn't really been
listening.

Impatient, she fidgeted. Then froze.

Footsteps were running up the stairs, lightly pattering.

76
Perhaps one of the maids, despite orders. Claudia flattened herself into the alcove,
cursing silently, barely breathing.

Just behind her ear, the disc gave a soft, satisfied snap.

At once she turned, had the door open, and was inside in seconds, one arm whipping
back out to snatch the disc.

When the maid hurried by with the pile of linen, the study door was as dark and grimly
locked as ever.

Slowly, Claudia withdrew her eye from the spyhole and breathed out in relief. Then she
stiffened, her shoulders tight with tension. A curious, dreadful certainty swept over her that
the room behind her was not empty, that her father was standing at her back, close
enough to touch, his smile bitter. That the horseman she had seen leave had been his
own holo-image, that he had outguessed her as he always did.

She made herself turn.

The room was empty. But it was not what she'd expected. For a start it was too big. It was
totally non-Era. And it was tilted.

At least she thought so for a moment, because the first steps she took into its space were
strangely unsteady, as if the floor sloped, or the perspective of the bare gray walls rose to
odd angles. Something blurred and clicked; then the room seemed to gently even out,
become normal, except for the warmth and the sweet faint scent and a low hum she
couldn't quite identify.

77
The ceiling was high and vaulted. Sleek silver devices lined the walls, each winking with
small red lights. A narrow illumination strip lit only the area directly below it, revealing a
solitary desk, a neatly aligned metal chair.


The rest of the room was empty. The only thing marring the perfect floor was a tiny speck
of black. She bent down and examined it. A scrap of metal, dropped from some device.

Astonished, still not quite sure she was alone, Claudia gazed around. Where were the
windows? There should be two-- both orieled casements. Y could see them from
                                                               ou
outside, and through them a white pargeted ceiling and some bookshelves. Often she'd
wondered about climbing up the ivy to get in. From outside, the room had looked normal.
Not this humming, tilted box too big for its space.

She paced forward, gripping Jared's disc tightly, but it registered no warnings. Reaching
the desk, she touched its smooth, featureless surface and a screen rose up silently with
no visible controls. She searched, but there was nothing, so she assumed it was voice-
operated. \"Begin,\" she said quietly.

Nothing happened.

\"Go. Start. Commence. Initiate.\"

The screen stayed blank. Only the room hummed.

There must be a password. She leaned down, placed both hands on the desk. There was
only one word she could think of, so she said it.

\"Incarceron.\"

78
No image. But under the fingers of her left hand a drawer rolled smoothly open.

Inside, on a bed of black velvet, lay a single key. It was intricate, a spun web of crystal.
Embedded in the heart of it was a crowned eagle; the royal insignia of the Havaarna
Dynasty. Bending closer, she looked at its sharp facets that glittered so brilliantly. Was it
diamond? Glass? Drawn by its heavy beauty she bent so close her breath misted on its
frostiness, her shadow blocking the overhead light so that the rainbow glints went out.
Might it be the key to Incarceron itself? She wanted to lift it. But first she ran Jared's disc
cautiously over its surface.

Nothing.

She glanced around once. Everything was quiet. So she picked up the key.

The room crashed. Alarms howled; rays of laserfire shot up from the floor, ringing her in a
cage of red light. A metal grille slammed over the door; hidden lights burst on and she


stood frozen in the uproar in terror, her heart slamming in her chest, and in that instant the
disc jabbed a pepperpoint of red pain urgently into her thumb.

She glanced down at it. Jared's message was breathless with terror.

He's coming back! Get out, Claudia! Get out!

***

Once Sapphique came to the end of a tunnel and looked down on a vast hall. Its floor was
a poisoned pool of venom. Corrosive steams rose from it. Across the darkness stretched
a taut

wire, and on the far side a doorway was visible, with light beyond it.

The inmates of the Wing tried to dissuade him. \"Many have fallen,\" they said.

\"Their bones rot in the black lake. Why should you be any different?\"

He answered, \"Because I have dreams and in those dreams I see the stars.\" Then he
swung

himself up onto the wire and began to cross. Many times he rested, or hung in pain. Many

times they called on him to return. Finally, after hours, he reached the other side, and they

saw him stagger, and vanish through the door.

He was dark, this Sapphique, and slender. His hair was straight and long. His real name
is only to be guessed at.

--Wanderings of Sapphique

***

Gildas said testily, \"I've told you many times. Outside exists. Sapphique found a way
there. But no one comes. Not even you.\"

80


\"Y don't know that.\"
  ou

The old man laughed, making the floor sway. The metal cage hung high over the chamber
and was barely big enough for both of them to squat in. Books on chains dangled from it,
surgical instruments, a swinging cascade of tin boxes stuffed with festering specimens. It
was padded with old mattresses from which wisps of straw fell like an irritating snow onto
the cooking fires and stewpots far below. A woman looked up to yell in annoyance. Then
she saw Finn and was silent.

\"I know it, fool boy, because the Sapienti have written it.\" Gildas pulled a boot on. \"The
Prison was made to hold the Scum of humanity; to seal them away, to exile them from the
earth. That was centuries ago, in the time of Martor, in the days the Prison spoke to men.
Seventy Sapienti volunteered to enter the Prison to minister to its inmates, and after them
the entrance was sealed forever. They taught their wisdom to their successors. Even
children know this.\"

Finn rubbed the hilt of his sword. He felt tired and resentful.

\"No one has entered since. We know about the Wombs too, though not where they are.
Incarceron is efficient; it was designed to be. It doesn't waste dead matter, but recycles
everything. In those cells it grows new inmates. Perhaps animals too.

\"But I remember things ... bits of things.\" Finn gripped the

81
cage bars as if to hold on to his belief, watching Keiro cross the floor of the hall far below,
arms around two giggling girls.

Gildas's gaze followed his. \"Y don't. Y dream Incarceron's mysteries. Y visions will
                              ou       ou                              our
show us how to Escape.\"

\"No. I remember.\"

The old man looked exasperated. \"Remember what?\"

He felt foolish. \"Well... a cake. With silver balls and seven candles. There were people.
And music ... lots of music ... He hadn't realized that until now. He was oddly pleased, until
he caught the old man's eye.

\"A cake. I suppose it may be a symbol. The number seven is important. The Sapienti
know it as the sigil of Sapphique, because of the time when he met the renegade Beetle.\"


\"I was there!\"

\"Everyone has memories, Finn. Y     our prophecies are what matter. The visions that
descend on you are the great gift and strangeness of the Starseer. They're unique. The
people know that, the slaves and the warband, even Jormanric. It's in the way they look at
you. Sometimes they fear you.\"

Finn was silent. He hated the fits. They came suddenly, dizzy sickness and blackouts that
terrified him, and Gildas's relentless interrogation after each one left him shivering and
sick.

\"One day I'll die from <<one|9c:1>>,\" he said quietly.

\"It is true few cell-born live to be old.\" Gildas's voice was harsh, but he looked away.
Buckling the ornate collar over his green robe he muttered, \"The past is gone; whatever it
was, it

82
doesn't matter anymore. Put it out of your head or it will drive you to madness.\"

Finn said, \"How many other cell-born have you known?\"

\"<<Three|9k:0>>.\" Gildas tugged the plaited end of his beard free irritably. He paused. \"Y   ou're rare
beings. I spent my life searching before I found you. A man rumored to be cell-born used
to beg outside the Hall of Lepers, but when I finally coaxed him to speak I realized his
mind had gone; he babbled about an egg that talked, a cat that faded out to just a smile.
Years later, after many rumors, I found another, a worker of the Civicry in the Ice Wing. She
seemed normal enough; I tried to persuade her to speak to me of her visions. But she
never would. One day I heard she had hanged herself.\"

Finn swallowed. \"Why?\"

\"They told me she had gradually begun to believe a child followed her, an invisible child
that clutched her skirts and called her, woke her at night. Its voice tormented her. She
couldn't shut it out.\"

Finn shivered. He knew that Gildas was watching him. The Sapient said gruffly, \"Finding
you here was a chance in a million, Finn. Only you can guide my Escape.\"

\"I can't ...\"

\"Y can. Y
  ou     ou're my prophet, Finn. My link with Incarceron. Soon now you'll bring me the


vision I've waited a lifetime for, the sign that my time has come, that I must follow
Sapphique and seek the Outside. Every Sapient makes that journey. None

83
have succeeded, but none have had a cell-born to guide them.\"

Finn shook his head. He'd heard this for years and it still scared him. The old man was
obsessed with Escape, but how could Finn help him? How could flashes of memory and
the skin-tingling, choking lapses into unconsciousness help anyone?

Gildas pushed past him and grasped the metal ladder. \"Don't talk about this. Not even to
Keiro.\"

He climbed down and his eyes were on a level with Finns feet before Finn muttered,
\"Jormanric will never just let you go.\"

Gildas glared up through the rungs. \"I go where I want.\"

\"He needs you. He rules the Wing because of you. On his own he--\"

\"He'll manage. He's good at fear and violence.\"

Gildas descended one rung, then pulled himself up, his small wizened face lit with sudden
joy. \"Can you imagine how it will be, Finn, one day, to open a hatch and climb out of
darkness, out of Incarceron? To see the stars? To see the sun!\"

For a moment Finn was silent; then he swung down on a rope past the Sapient. \"I've seen
it.\"

Gildas laughed sourly. \"Only in visions, fool boy. Only in dreams.\"

He clambered with surprising agility down the diagonal of lashed ladders. Finn followed
more slowly, the rope's friction warm through his gloves.

Escape.

84
It was a word that stung him like a wasp, a sharpness that pierced his mind, a longing that
promised everything and meant nothing. The Sapienti taught that Sapphique had once
found a way out, that he had Escaped. Finn wasn't sure if he believed that. The stories
about Sapphique grew in the telling; every itinerant storyteller and poet had a new one. If


a single man could have had all those adventures, tricked all those Winglord's, made that
epic journey through the Thousand Wings of Incarceron, he must have lived for
generations. The Prison was said to be vast and unknowable, a labyrinth of halls and
stairs and chambers and towers beyond number. Or so the Sapienti taught.

His feet hit the ground. Glimpsing the snake-green iridescence of Gildas's robe as the old
man hurried out of the Den, Finn ran after him, making sure that his foil was in its sheath
and that he had both daggers in his belt.

The Maestra's crystal was what concerned him now.

And getting it was not going to be easy.

The Chasm of Ransom was only three halls away, and he crossed the dark empty spaces
quickly, alert for spiders or the inbred shadowhawks that swooped high in the rafters.
Everyone else seemed to be there already. He heard the Comitatus before he came
through the last archway; they were shouting and howling Insults across the abyss, their
scorn ringing back from the smooth unclimbable slabs.

On the far side the Civicry waited, a line of shadows.

85
The Chasm was a jagged crack across the floor, a sheer face of black obsidian. If a
stone was dropped down it, no sound ever came up. The Comitatus considered it
bottomless; some even said that if you fell into its depths, you fell right through Incarceron
into the molten heart of the earth, and certainly heat rose from it, a miasma that made the
air shimmer. In the center, split off by whatever Prisonquake had formed the abyss, rose a
needle-thin rock called the Spike, its flat platform cracked and worn. From each side a
bridge of scorched metal rusted and dark with pig-grease led there. It was a neutral place
that belonged to no one, a place for truces and parleys, of hesitant exchange among the
hostile tribes of the Wing.

At the unfenced edge, from which he often had troublesome slaves thrown screaming
down, Jormanric lounged on his throne, the Comitatus around him, the small dog-slave
crouched at the end of its chain.

\"Look at him,\" Keiro's voice whispered in Finn's ear. \"Big and thick.\"

\"And as vain as you.\"

His oathbrother snorted. \"At least I've got something to be vain about.\"


But Finn was watching the Maestra. As they led her in, her eyes glanced quickly at the
crowd, the rickety bridges, her people waiting in the shimmering air beyond. Over there,
just for a moment a man cried out, and at the sound her face lost its

86
composure; she tugged away from her guards and screamed, \"Sim!\"

Finn wondered if that was her husband. \"Come on,\" he said to Keiro, and pushed
forward.

Seeing them, the crowd moved back. It's in the way they look at you, Finn thought
bitterly. Knowing that the old man was right made him angry. He came up behind the
Maestra and grabbed her arm. \"Remember what I said. No harm will come to you. But
are you sure they'll bring this thing?\"

She glared at him. \"They won't hold anything back. Some people know about love.\"

The jibe stung him. \"Maybe I did once.\"

Jormanric was watching them, his dull eyes barely focused. He jabbed a ringed finger at
the bridge and yelled, \"Get her ready!\"

Keiro pulled the woman's hands behind her and shackled them. Watching, Finn muttered,
\"Look. I'm sorry.\"

She held his gaze. \"Not as sorry as I am for you.\"

Keiro smiled archly. Then he looked to Jormanric.

The Winglord heaved himself up and strode to the Chasm edge, glaring out at the Civicry.
The greasy chainmesh creaked as he folded his great arms across his chest. \"Listen,
over there!\" he thundered. \"Y get her back for her weight in treasure. No more, no less.
                             ou
And that means no alloy and no junk.\"

His words rang in the steaming heat.

87
\"First, your word there'll be no treachery.\" The reply was cold with fury.

Jormanric grinned. Ket-juice glistened on his teeth. \"Y want my word! I haven't kept my
                                                       ou
word since I was ten and knifed my own brother. You're welcome to it.\"


The Comitatus sniggered. Behind them, half in shadow, Finn saw Gildas, his face sour.

Silence.

Then, from deep in the shimmering heat haze came a clang and a thud. The Civicry were
hauling their treasure across to the Spike. Finn wondered what they had--ore certainly, but
Jormanric would be hoping for gold and platinum and most precious of all, micro-circuitry.
After all, the Civicry were one of the richest groups in the Wing. That had been the reason
for the ambush.

The bridge shuddered. The Maestra grasped the rail to steady herself.

Finn said quietly, \"Let's go.\" He glanced behind himself. Keiro had drawn his sword.

\"I'm here, brother.\"

\"Don't let the bitch go till you get every last ounce,\" Jormanric rasped.

Finn scowled. Pushing the Maestra in front, he began the crossing.

The bridge was a web of woven chainwork; it swung with every step. Twice he slipped,
once so hard that the whole

88
structure swayed crazily and nearly tipped the three of them into the abyss. Keiro swore;
the Maestra's fingers gripping the metal links were white-knuckled.

Finn did not look down. He knew what was below nothing bur blackness and heat that
rose and scorched your face, bringing strange drowsy fumes it was unwise to breathe.

As she inched forward, the Maestra's voice came back to him, hard and cold. \"If they
don't bring ... the crystal? What then?\"

\"What crystal?\" Keiro asked slyly.

Finn said, \"Shut up.\" Ahead in the dimness he could see the Civicry--three men, as
agreed, waiting by the weighing platform. He edged up close behind the Maestra. \"Don't
even try to make a run for it. Jormanric will have twenty weapons trained on you.\"

\"I'm not a fool,\" she snapped. Then she stepped onto the Spike.


Finn followed, taking a deep breath of relief. It was a mistake. The fumes of the heat haze
choked his throat; he coughed.

Keiro pushed past him, sword drawn, and grabbed the woman's arm. \"On this.\"

He shoved her onto the weighing platform. It was a vast aluminum construction, dragged
here in pieces and reassembled with immense difficulty for occasions like this, though in
all Finn's time with the Comitatus he had never seen it used. Jormanric didn't usually
bother with ransoms.

89
\"Look hard at the marker, friend.\" Keiro turned silkily to the Civic leader. \"Not such a
lightweight, is she?\" He grinned.

\"Perhaps you should have kept her on a stricter diet.\"

The man was stocky, muffled in a striped coat, bulky with concealed weapons. Ignoring
Keiro's taunt he came and glanced at the needle on the rusting dial, exchanging a swift,
snatched look with the Maestra. Finn recognized him from the ambush. The one she'd
called Sim.

The man gave Finn a filthy glare. Taking no chances, Keiro pulled the Maestra back and
held his dagger to her neck. \"Now pile it on. And don't try anything.\"

In the moment before the treasure began to be poured, Finn wiped sweat from his eyes.
He swallowed again, trying not to breathe too hard, wishing desperately he had tied
something over his mouth and nose. Faint, horribly familiar, the spots of redness began to
swim before his eyes. Not now, he thought frantically. Please.

Not now.

Gold was slithering and rattling. Rings, cups, plates, elaborate candlesticks. A bag was
upended and silver coins cascaded out, forged probably from the ore smuggled by
traders; then a deluge of delicate components robbed from dark and unfrequented parts
of the Wing--broken Beetles, Eye-lenses, a Sweeper with its radar mangled.

The needle began to move. Watching it, the Civicry dumped a sack of ket and two small
pieces of the precious ebony wood

90
that grew somewhere in a stunted forest even Gildas had only-heard rumors of.


Keiro grinned at Finn.

As the red needle edged across, a heap of copper wire and Plastiglas went on, a handful
of crystal filaments, a patched helm, and three rusted foils that would certainly snap at the
first good blow.

The men worked hurriedly, but it was clear they were running out of goods. The Maestra
watched tight-lipped, Keiro's knifepoint whitening the skin under her ear.

Finn's breath was ragged. Prickles of pain sparked behind his eyes. He swallowed and
tried to whisper to Keiro, but he had no breath and his oathbrother was watching the last
sack--of useless tinware--being placed on the heap.

The needle swung over.

It stopped short.

\"More,\" Keiro said quietly.

\"There's nothing more.\"

Keiro laughed. \"Y love the coat you're wearing better than her?\"
                 ou

Sim tore the coat off and flung it on. Then, with a glance at the Maestra he tossed his
sword and firelock after it. The other two men did the same. They stood empty-handed
and each of them watched the needle quiver.

It didn't quite make the mark.

\"More,\" Keiro said.

91
\"For God's sake!\" Sim's voice was harsh. \"Just let her go!\" Keiro glanced at Finn. \"This
crystal. Is it there?\" Dizzy, he shook his head.

Keiro smiled icily at the men. He pressed the blade; a glistening trickle of dark blood
edged it. \"Beg, lady.\"

She was very calm. She said, \"They want the crystal, Sim. The one you found in the lost
hall.\"

\"Maestra ...\"


\"Give it to them.\"

Sim hesitated. It was only for a second, though through his nausea Finn saw it strike the
Maestra like a blow. Then the man put his hand into his shirt and pulled out an object that
caught a glimmer of light, so that a brief rainbow rippled in his fingers. 'We've found out
something,\" he said. \"Something it does ...\"

She stopped him with a look. He tossed the crystal slowly down onto the pile.

The needle touched the mark.

At once Keiro shoved the woman away. Sim grabbed her arm and pulled her onto the
second bridge. \"Run!\" he yelled.

Finn crouched. Saliva welled in his throat as he picked up the crystal. Inside it an eagle
spread wide wings. It was the same as the mark on his wrist. Finn.

He looked up.

The Maestra had stopped and turned, her face white. \"I hope it destroys you.\"

92
\"Maestra!\" Sim had her arm but she shook him off. Gripping the chains of the second
bridge, she faced Finn and spat words at him.

\"I curse the crystal, and I curse you.\"

\"There's no time,\" he said hoarsely. \"Just go.\"

\"You've destroyed my trust. My compassion. I thought I could tell truth from lies. Now I'll
never dare show kindness to a stranger again. For that I can never forgive you!\"

Her hatred scorched him. Then, as she turned away, the bridge lurched.

The abyss swung crazily. In a second of frozen horror the Maestra screamed and he
gasped, \"No!\" staggering one step toward her. Then Keiro had hold of him and was
shouting and something was cracking and as if the pain in his head had slowed them
down he saw the chains and rivets that held the bridge snapping and jerking out, heard
Jormanric's great howl of laughter and knew this was treachery.

The Maestra must have realized too. She stood upright.


She gave him one look, her eyes to his; then she was gone, she and Sim and the others
were gone, down and down, and the bridge was a crazy contraption slamming and
shedding wrecked ironware in a clattering uproar against the side of the cliff.

Screaming echoes faded.

Crumpling to his knees, Finn stared, appalled. A wave of nausea shuddered through him.
He clutched the crystal, and through the roaring in his ears heard Keiro say calmly, \"I

93
should have guessed the old rogue would do that. And a lump of glass doesn't look much
for all your trouble. What is it?\"

Then Finn knew, in a second of sour clarity, that he was right, that he must have been born
Outside; knew it because he held in his hand the one object that no one in Incarceron for
generations had ever seen or would even guess the purpose of, and yet it was familiar to
him, he had a word for it, he knew what it was.

It was a key.

Darkness and pain roared up and swallowed him. He fell into Keiro's firm grip.

The Years of Rage are ended and nothing can be the same. The war has hollowed the
moon and stilled the tides. We must find a simpler way of life. We must retreat into the
past, everyone and everything, in its place, in order. Freedom is a small price to pay for
survival.

---King Endor's Decree


***

Finn felt himself fall for a thousand miles down the abyss before he crashed onto a ledge.
Breathless, he raised his head. All around, darkness roared. Beside him, leaning back
against the rock, someone was sitting. Finn said instantly,

\"The Key ...\"

\"At your side.\"

He groped for it in the rubble, felt its smooth heaviness. Then he turned.

A stranger sat there. He was young and had long dark hair. He wore a high-collared coat
like a Sapient s, but it was ragged and patched. He pointed to the rock face and said,
\"Look, inn.

In the rock was a keyhole. Light shone through it. And Finn saw that the rock was a door,
tiny and black, and in its transparency stars and galaxies were embedded.

98
\"This is Time. This is what you must unlock,\" Sapphique said.

Finn tried to lift the Key, but it was so heavy he needed both hands, and even then it
shook in his grasp. \"Help me,\" he gasped.

But the hole was closing, swiftly, and by the time he got the Key steady, there was nothing
left but a pinhole of light.

\"So many have tried,\" Sapphique whispered in his ear. \"Have died trying,\"

***

FOR A second Claudia was stock-still with despair.

Then she moved. She shoved the crystal key into her pocket, used Jared's disc to make
a perfect holocopy of it nestled in the black velvet and slammed the drawer shut. Fingers
hot with sweat she took out the box prepared just for this emergency and flipped out the
ladybugs. They flew, landing on the control panel and the floor. Then she clicked the blue
switch on the disc to red, swung, and aimed it at the door.

Three of the laserlights fizzed and died. She slid through the gap they left, flinching from


imaginary bolts of weaponry. The grille was a nightmare; the disc chuntered and clicked,
and she howled at it in desperation, sure it would break down, run out of power, but slowly
a white-hot hole melted in the metal as the atoms scrambled and re-formed.

In seconds she was through it, had the door open, was in the corridor.

It was silent.

99
Amazed, she listened. As the study door clicked shut behind her, the panic alarms were
sliced off as if they rang in some other world.

The house was peaceful. Doves cooed. And below, she heard voices.

She ran. Up the back stairs, right to the attics, then down a passageway through the
servants' garrets to the tiny storeroom at the end; it stank of wormwood and cloves.
Diving in she groped hastily for the mechanism that opened the ancient priesthole, her
fingernails scraping grime and spiderwebs and then, yes, there! The latch barely wide
enough for her thumb.

As she jabbed it, the panel grated; she flung her weight on it, heaved it, swearing, and it
shuddered open and she fell in.

Once she had it shut and her back against it, she could breathe.

Before her, the tunnel to Jared's tower ran into darkness.

***

FINN LAY crookedly on his bed.

He lay there a long while, gradually becoming aware of the noises of the Den outside, of
someone running, of the clatter of dishes. Finally, groping with his hand, he found that a
blanket had been laid carefully over him. His shoulders and neck ached; cold sweat
chilled him.

He rolled over and looked up at the filthy ceiling. Echoes of a long scream were ringing in
his ears, the tingling of alarms and panicking, flashing lights. For a sickening moment he
had

100


the sense that his vision had stretched into a long dark tunnel leading away from him, that
he could step into it and grope his way toward the light.

Then Keiro said, \"About time.\"

Blurred and distorted, his oathbrother came and sat on the bed. He made a face. \"You
look rough.\"

Finn's voice, when he tried it out, was hoarse. \"Y don't\"
                                                  ou

Slowly he focused. Keiro's mane of blond hair was tied back. He wore Sim's striped coat
with far more panache than its owner ever had, a wide studded belt slung around his hips,
a jeweled dagger strapped to it. He spread his arms. \"Suits me, don't you think?\"

Finn didn't answer. A wave of anger and shame was rising somewhere in him; his mind
squirmed away from it. If he let it in, it would drown him. He croaked, \"How long? How
bad?\"

\"Two hours. You've missed the shareout. Again.\"

Carefully Finn sat up. The seizures left him dizzy and dry-mouthed.

Keiro said, \"It was a bit more severe than usual. Convulsions. Y jerked and struggled,
                                                                ou
but I held you down and Gildas made sure you didn't injure yourself. No one else took
much notice; they were too busy gloating over the treasure. We carried you back.\"

Finn flushed with despair. The blackouts were impossible to predict, and Gildas knew of
no cure, or so he said. Finn had no idea what happened after the hot, roaring darkness
engulfed

101
him, and he didn't want to know. It was a weakness and he was bitterly ashamed of it,
even if the Comitatus held him in awe. Now he felt as if he had left his body and had come
back to find it sore and empty, that he was aslant inside it. \"I didn't have them Outside. I'm
sure of it.\"

Keiro shrugged. \"Gildas is desperate to hear about your vision.\"

Finn looked up. \"He can wait.\" There was an awkward silence. Into it he said, \"Jormanric
ordered her death?\"

\"Who else? It's the sort of thing that amuses him. And it's a warning to us.\"


Grim, Finn nodded. He swung his feet off the bed and stared down at his worn boots. \"I'm
going to kill him for that.\"

Keiro raised an elegant eyebrow. \"Brother, why bother? Y got what you wanted.\"
                                                        ou

\"I gave her my word. I told her she'd be safe.\"

Keiro watched him a moment, then said, \"We're Scum, Finn. Our word means nothing.
She knew that. She was a hostage; if they'd gotten hold of you, the Civicry would probably
have done the same, so think no more about it. I've told you before, you brood over things
too much. It makes you weak. There's no room for weakness in Incarceron. No mercy for
a fatal flaw. Here it's kill or be killed.\" He was staring straight ahead and there was an odd
sourness in his voice that was new to Finn. But when he turned his smile was sharp. \"So.
What's a key, then?\"

Finn's heart thumped. \"The Key! Where is it?\"

102
Keiro shook his head in mock wonder. \"What would you do without me?\" He held up his
hand and Finn saw that the crystal was dangling from one hooked finger.

He snatched at it, but Keiro jerked it away. \"I said, what's a key?\"

Finn licked paper-dry lips. \"A key is a device that opens.\"

\"Opens?\"

\"Unlocks.\"

Keiro was alert. \"The Winglocks? Any door?\"

\"I don't know! I just... recognize it.\" He reached out hastily and grabbed it, and this time,
reluctantly, Keiro let it go. The artifact was heavy, woven of strange glassy filaments, and
the holographic eagle in its heart glared at Finn majestically. He saw that it wore a fine
collar shaped like a crown around its neck, and tugging back his sleeve he compared it
with the fading blue marks in his skin.

Over his shoulder Keiro said, \"It looks the same.\"

\"It's identical.\"


\"But it means nothing. In fact, if anything, it means you were born Inside.\"

\"This didn't come from Inside.\" Finn nursed it in both hands. \"Look at it. What material do
we have like this? The workmanship ...\"

\"The Prison could have made it.\"

Finn said nothing.

But at that moment, just as if it had been listening, the Prison turned all the lights off.

103

***

WHEN THE Warden softly opened the observatory door the wall-screen was lit with
images of the Havaarna Kings of the Eighteenth Dynasty, those effete generations whose
social policies had led directly to the Years of Rage. Jared was sitting on the desk, one
foot propped on the back of Claudia's chair, the fox cub in his arms; she was leaning
forward and reading from a pad in her hand.

\"... Alexander the Sixth, Restorer of the Realm. Created the Contract of Duality.
Closed all theatres and public forms of entertainment... Why did he do that?\"

\"Fear,\" Jared said dryly. \"By that time any crowd of people was seen as a threat to order.\"

Claudia smiled, her throat dry. This is what her father must see; his daughter and her
beloved tutor. Of course he would know perfectly well that they knew he was here.

\"Ahem.\"

Claudia jumped; Jared looked around. Their surprise was masterly.

The Warden smiled a cold smile, as if he admired it.

\"Sir?\" Claudia stood up, her silk dress uncreasing. \"Are you back already? I thought you
said one.\"

\"That was indeed what I said. May I come in, Master?\"

Jared said, \"Of course,\" and the cub streaked from his hands and jumped up the
bookshelves. \"Were honored, Warden.\"


The Warden walked to the table littered with apparatus

104
and touched an alembic. \"Y Era detail is a little ... eccentric, Jared. But the Sapienti
                             our
are not so bound by Protocol, of course.\" He lifted the delicate glassware and raised it so
that his left eye, hugely magnified, gazed at them through it. \"The Sapienti do as they will.
They invent, they experiment, they keep the mind of mankind active even in the tyranny of
the past. Always searching for new sources of energy, new cures. Admirable. But tell me,
how is my daughter progressing?\"

Jared linked his frail fingers. Carefully he said, \"Claudia is always a remarkable pupil.\"

\"A scholar.\"

\"Indeed.\"

\"Intelligent and able?\" The Warden lowered the glass. His eyes were fixed on her; she
looked up and gazed calmly back at him.

\"I'm sure,\" Jared murmured, \"that she'll be a success in everything she attempts.\"

\"And she would attempt anything.\" The Warden opened his fingers and the flask fell. It hit
the corner of the desk and smashed, an explosion of glass slivers, sending a raven
screeching out through the window.

Jared had leaped back; now he froze. Claudia stood behind him, quite still.

\"I am so sorry!\" The Warden surveyed the wreckage calmly, then took out a handkerchief
and wiped his fingers. \"The clumsiness of age, I'm afraid. I hope it didn't contain anything
vital?\"

105
Jared shook his head; Claudia caught the faintest glimmer of sweat on his forehead. She
knew her own face was pale. Her father said, \"Claudia, you'll be pleased to know that
Lord Evian and I have finalized the dowry arrangements. Y had better begin gathering
                                                          ou
your trousseau, my dear.\"

At the door he paused. Jared had crouched and was picking up the sharp, curved
fragments of glass. Claudia did not move. She watched the Warden, and his look
reminded her, for a moment, of her own reflection as she stared at it in the looking glass
each morning. He said, \"I won't take lunch after all. I have a lot of work to do. In my study.


We seem to have an insect problem.\"

When the door closed behind him, neither of them spoke. Claudia sat, and Jared
dumped the glass into a disposer and switched the monitor on for the tower stairs.
Together they watched the Warders dark angular figure pick a fastidious way through the
mouse droppings and hanging webs.

Finally Jared said, \"He knows.\"

\"Of course he knows.\" Claudia realized she was shivering; she pulled an old coat of
Jared's around her shoulders. She had the jumpsuit on under her dress, her shoes were
on the wrong feet, and her hair was scrunched back in a sweaty tangle. \"He came here
just to show us that.\"

\"He doesn't believe the ladybugs set the alarms off.\"

\"I told you. The room has no windows. But he won't admit that I got the better of him, and
he never will. So we play the game.\"

\"But the Key ... to bring it away ...\"

106
\"He won't know if he just opens the drawer and looks at it. Only when he tries to pick it up.
I can put the original back before then.\"

Jared wiped his face with one hand. He sat shakily. \"A Sapient should not say this, but he
terrifies me.\"

\"Are you all right?\"

He turned his dark eyes to her, and the fox cub jumped back down and pawed at his
knee.

\"Y But then you terrify me equally, Claudia. Why on earth did you steal it? Did you want
  es.
him to know it was you?\"

She frowned. Sometimes he was too acute. \"Where is it?\"

Jared looked at her a moment, then made a rueful face. He took the lid from an
earthenware crock and dipping a hook in, lifted the Key out of the formaldehyde. The
acrid smell of the chemical filled the chamber; Claudia pulled the coat sleeve over her
face. \"God. Wasn't there anywhere else?\"


She had thrust it into his hand and had been too busy dressing to see where he put it.
Now he unwrapped it carefully from the protective seal and laid it on the gnarled, singed
wood of the workbench. They stared down at it.

It was beautiful. She could see that clearly, its facets catching the sunlight from the window
in brilliant rainbow glints. Embedded in its heart the crowned eagle glared out proudly.

But it seemed too fragile to turn in any lock, and its transparency showed no circuitry. She
said, \"The password to open the drawer was Incarceron!'

107
Jared raised an eyebrow. \"So you thought...\"

\"It's obvious, isn't it? What else could such a key unlock? Nothing in this house has a key
like that.\"

\"We have no idea where Incarceron is. And if we did we couldn't use it.\"

She frowned. \"I intend to find out.\"

For a moment Jared considered. Then, as she watched, he placed the Key on a small
scale and weighed it accurately, took its mass and length, noting the results in his precise
script. \"It's not glass. A crystal silicate. Also\"--he adjusted the scale--\"it has a very peculiar
electromagnetic field. I would say its not a key in a strictly mechanical sense but some
very complex technology, very pre-Era. It won't just unlock a prison door, Claudia.\"

She'd guessed that. She sat down again and said thoughtfully, \"I used to be jealous of the
Prison.\"

Astonished, he turned, and she laughed.

\"Y Really. When I was tiny and we were at Court. People flocked to see him--the
  es.
Warden of Incarceron, the Guardian of the Inmates, Protector of the Realm. I didn't know
what the words meant, but I hated them. I thought Incarceron was a person, another
daughter, a secret spiteful twin. I hated her.\" She picked up a pair of compasses from the
table and opened them. \"When I found out it was a prison, I imagined him going down into
the cellars here with a lantern and a huge key--a rusty, ancient key. There would be an
enormous door, studded and nailed with the dried flesh of criminals.\"

108
Jared shook his head. \"Too many gothic novels.\"


She balanced the compasses on one point and spun them. \"For a while I dreamed of the
Prison, imagined the thieves and murderers deep under the house, banging on the doors,
struggling to get out, and I used to wake up scared, thinking I could hear them coming for
me. And then I realized it wasn't that simple.\" She looked up. \"That screen in the study. He
must be able to monitor it from there.\"

Jared nodded and folded his arms. \"Incarceron, all the records say, was made and
sealed. No one enters or leaves. Only the Warden oversees its progress. Only he knows
its location. There is a theory, a very old one, that it lies underground, many miles below
the earth's surface, a vast labyrinth. After the Y ears of Rage half the populations were
removed there. A great injustice, Claudia.\"

She touched the Key lightly. \"Y But none of this helps me. I needed some proof of the
                               es.
murder, not...\" A flicker.

A dissolving of light.

She jerked her finger away.

\"Amazing!\" Jared breathed.

A fingerprint of darkness remained there in the crystal, a circular black opening, like an
eye.

Inside it, far off, they saw two glimmers of moving light, tiny as stars.

***

Keiro lifted his lantern. \"Where are you, Wise One?\" Gildas had not been in his sleeping
cage or anywhere in the main chamber, where the Comitatus had defiantly lit flares in
every brazier and were celebrating their victory with raucous song and boasting. It had
taken a few clouts of Keiro's fist among the slaves to find someone who had seen the old
man, heading for the hovels. Now they had tracked him down to a small cell; he was
bandaging a suppurating sore on a slave-child's leg, his mother holding a feeble candle
and waiting anxiously.

\"I'm here.\" Gildas glared around. \"Bring that lantern closer. I can't see a thing.\"

Finn came in and saw the light glimmer on the boy, noticing how sickly he looked.

\"Cheer up,\" he said gruffly.

The boy smiled, terrified.

110
\"If you'd only touch him, sir,\" the mother murmured.

Finn turned. She might once have been pretty; now she was haggard and thin.

\"The touch of a Starseer cures, they say.\"

\"Superstitious bloody nonsense,\" Gildas snorted, tying the knot, but Finn did it anyway,
putting his fingers lightly to the boy's hot forehead.

\"Not so different to yours, Wise One,\" Keiro said silkily.

Gildas straightened, wiped his fingers on his coat, and ignored the taunt. \"Well, that's the
best I can do. The wound needs to drain. Keep it clean.\"

As they followed him out he growled, \"Always more infections, more disease. We need
antibiotics, not gold and tinware.\"

Finn knew him in this mood; the dark gloom that kept him sometimes for days in his cage,
reading, sleeping, speaking to no one. The Maestra's death would be tormenting the old
man. So, abruptly he said, \"I saw Sapphique.\"

\"What!\" Gildas stopped dead. Even Keiro looked interested.


\"He said--\"

\"Wait.\" The Sapient looked around hastily. \"In here.\"

It was a dark archway and it led to one of the vast chains that hung in loops from the Den
roof. Gildas put his foot in the links and climbed until the darkness hid him; when Finn
clambered after him he found the old man on a narrow shelf high in the wall, shoving
ancient birdmuck and nests aside.

\"I'm not sitting in that,\" Keiro said.

111
\"Stand then.\" Gildas took the lantern from Finn and propped it on the chain. \"Now. Tell me
everything. Each word, exactly.\"

Finn put his feet over the edge and looked down. \"It was a place like this, high up. He was
there with me, and I had the Key.\"

\"That crystal? He called it a key?\" Gildas looked stunned; he rubbed his stubbly white
chin. \"That is a Sapient word, Finn, a magic word. A device for unlocking.\"

\"I know what a key is.\" His voice was angry; he tried to be calm. \"Sapphique told me to
use it to unlock Time; there was a keyhole in some black, shining rock, but the Key was
so heavy I couldn't manage it. I felt... devastated.\"

The old man gripped Finns wrist, a hard, fierce grip. \"What did he look like?\"

\"Young. Long dark hair. Like the stories.\"

\"And the door?\"

\"Very small. The rock had light inside, like stars.\"

Keiro propped himself elegantly against the wall. \"Strange dreams, brother.\"

\"Not dreams.\" Gildas released him; the old man looked incredulous with joy. \"I know that
door. It has never been opened. It lies about a mile from here, up in Civicry land.\" He
rubbed his face with both hands and said, \"Where is this Key?\"

Finn hesitated. He had strung it on an old piece of string around his neck, but that had
been too heavy, so now it was belted inside his shirt. Reluctantly, he tugged it out.


The Sapient took it reverently. His small hands with their

112
raised veins explored it; he brought it close to his eyes and gazed at the eagle. \"This is
what I've been waiting for. 1 ' His voice was choked with emotion.\"The sign from
Sapphique.\" He looked up. \"It decides everything. We leave at once, tonight, before
Jormanric gets to know what this thing is. Sudden and swift, Finn, we begin our Escape.\"

\"Now wait a minute!\" Keiro peeled himself off the wall. \"He's not going anywhere. He's
sworn to me.\"

Gildas looked at him in distaste. \"Only because he's useful to you.\"

\"And not to you?\" Keiro laughed in scorn. \"Y ou're a hypocrite, old man. A glass trinket and
a few ravings when he's off his head are all you're interested in.\"

Gildas stood. He barely came to Keiro's shoulder, but his glare was malevolent, his wiry
body tense.

\"I would be careful, boy. Very careful.

\"Or what? Y turn me into a snake?\"
           ou'll

\"You're already doing that to yourself.\"

With a shiver of steel Keiro drew his sword. His eyes were blue and icy.

Finn said, \"Stop this.\" Neither of them even looked at him.

\"I've never liked you, boy. I've never trusted you,\" Gildas said grimly. \"You're a preening,
arrogant thief who considers only his own pleasures, who would murder if it suited him--as
it certainly already has. And you'd like nothing more than to make Finn your twin.\"

113
Keiro's face was flushed. He raised the sword so that the sharp tip menaced the old
man's eyes. \"Finn needs me to protect him from you. I'm the one who looks after him,
holds his head when he's sick, watches his back. If we're speaking home truths, I could
say that the Sapienti are old fools clutching rags of sorcery--\"

\"I said that's enough!\" Finn stepped between them and shoved the blade aside.


Glowering, Keiro whipped it away. \"You're going with him? Why?\"

\"What's there to stay for?\"

\"For God's sake, Finn! We're well in here--food, girls, all we want! We're feared,
respected--powerful enough to tackle Jormanric any time now. Then we'll be Winglords,
both of us!

\"And how long,\" Gildas sneered, \"<<before two|9:1>> is one too many?\"

\"Shut up!\" Finn turned, furious. \"Look at you both! The only friends I have in this hell and all
you can do is fight over me. Do either of you care about me? Not the seer, the fighter, the
fool who takes all the risks, but me, Finn?\" He stood shivering, suddenly bone-weary, and
as they stared at him he crouched, hands to his head, his voice breaking. \"I can't stand
this anymore. I'm dying here, terrified, living between seizures, dreading the next one, I
can't bear it anymore, I've got to get out, find out who I am! I have to Escape.\"

114
They were silent. Dust fell slowly through the beam of the lantern. Then Keiro sheathed his
sword.

Finn tried to stop shivering. He looked up, dreading to see the mockery in Keiro's eyes,
but his oathbrother held out a hand and pulled Finn up until they were face-to-face.

Gildas growled, \"I care for you, you fool boy.\"

Keiro's eyes were sharp and blue. \"Be quiet, old man. Can't you see he's manipulating us
both, as ever? You're so good at that, Finn. Y did it to the Maestra and you do it to us.\"
                                              ou
He released Finns arm and stepped back. \"All right. Let's say we try to get out. Have you
forgotten how she cursed you? A dying curse, Finn. Can we go up against that?\"

\"Leave that to me,\" Gildas snapped.

\"Ah yes. Sorcery.\" Keiro shook his head in disbelief. \"And how do we know the Key will
open this door? Doors only open if Incarceron wants it.\"

Finn rubbed his chin. He made himself stand upright. \"I need to try.\"

Keiro sighed. He turned away, gazing down at the fires of the Comitatus, and Gildas
caught Finn's eyes and nodded. He seemed quietly triumphant.

Keiro swung back. \"All right. But secretly. Then if we fail no one will know.\"


\"Y don't have to come,\" Gildas said.
  ou

\"If he goes, I go.\"

As he said it his foot dislodged a scatter of birdmuck from

115
the ledge; watching it fall, Finn thought he saw a shadow flicker below. He grabbed the
chain. \"Someone was there.\"

Keiro stared down. \"Are you sure?\"

\"I thought so.\"

The Sapient pulled himself to his feet. He looked dismayed. \"If it was a spy, if he heard
about the Key, we're in trouble. Get weapons and food and meet me in ten minutes at the
foot of the shaft.\" He looked at the Key, its rainbow shimmer. \"I'll keep this.\"

\"No you won't.\" Finn took it back firmly. \"It stays with me.

As he turned away with it, he felt a sudden strange warmth in its heaviness, and glanced
down. Under the eagle's claw a circle of paleness was fading. Inside it he thought he saw,
just for a moment, the shadow of a face, staring at him.

A girl's face.

***

\"I HAVE to confess that I detest riding.\" Lord Evian walked between the flowerbeds
examining the dahlias attentively. \"It all seems such an unnecessarily long way from the
ground.\" He sat next to her on the bench and gazed out at the sunny countryside, the
church steeple shimmering in the heat haze. \"And then your father wanting to come home
so abruptly! I do hope it wasn't some sudden illness?\"

\"I suppose he must have remembered something,\" Claudia said carefully.

116
The afternoon light warmed the honey-colored stone of the manor; it glinted on the dark
gold waters of the moat. Ducks arrowed toward the floating bread; she threw more for
them, shredding it in her fingers.


Evian's reflection showed his smooth face as he leaned over. His mouth said, \"Y must
                                                                               ou
be a little anxious, as well as eager, about this marriage.\"

She tossed a crust to a moorhen. \"Sometimes.\"

\"I assure you, everyone says you'll manage the Earl of Steen without any problems. His
mother dotes on him.\"

Claudia had no doubt of that. Suddenly she felt weary, as if the whole effort of acting her
part was overtaking her. She stood, her shadow darkening the water. \"If you'll excuse me,
my lord, I have so much to see to.\"

He didn't look up, reaching his plump fingers to the ducks. But he said, \"Sit down, Claudia
Arlexa.\"

His voice. She stared in astonishment at the back of his head. The nasal whine was
gone. Instead he sounded strong and commanding. He looked up.

She sat, silent.

\"This will come as a shock, I'm sure. I enjoy my disguise, but it can be tiresome.\" The oily
smile was gone too, and that made him look different, his heavily lidded eyes a little tired.
Older.

\"Disguise?\" she said.

\"Assumed persona. We all have them, don't we, in this tyranny of Time? Claudia, can we
be overheard here?\"

117
\"It's safer than the house.\"

\"Yes.\" He turned on the bench, the pale silk suit rustling, and she caught a waft of the
exquisite perfume he doused himself with. \"Listen to me now. I have to speak with you,
and this may be the only chance. Have you ever heard of the Steel Wolves?\"

Danger. There was danger here and she had to be very careful. She said, \"Jared is a
thorough teacher. The Steel Wolf was the heraldic symbol of Lord Calliston, who was
found guilty of plotting treason against the Realm, and was the first Prisoner to enter
Incarceron. But that was centuries ago.\"

\"A hundred and sixty years,\" Evian murmured. \"And that's all you know?\"


\"Yes.\" It was true.

He glanced quickly across the lawns. \"Then let me tell you that the Steel Wolf is also the
name of a secret organization of courtiers and ... shall we say ... malcontents who long for
release from the endless playing at an idealized past. From the tyranny of the Havaarnas.
They ... we ... would have the Realm ruled by a queen who cared for her people, who
would let us live as we want. Who would open Incarceron.\"

Her heart thudded with fear.

\"Do you understand what I'm saying, Claudia?\"

She had no idea how to deal with this. Biting her lip she watched Medlicote come out of
the gatehouse and look around for them. \"I think so. You're one of this group?\"

118
He had seen the secretary too. He said swiftly, \"I may be. I'm taking a great chance
talking to you. But I think you're not so much your father's daughter.\"

The secretary's dark figure crossed the drawbridge and strode toward them. Evian
waved limply. He said, \"Think about it. There are not many who would mourn the Earl of
Steen.\" He stood. \"Are you looking for me, sir?\"

John Medlicote was a tall man of few words. He bowed to Claudia and said, \"I was, my
lord. The Warden sends his compliments and begs me to inform you that these
dispatches have arrived from Court.\" He held out a leather satchel.

Evian smiled and took it daintily. \"Then I must go and read them. Excuse me, my dear.\"

Claudia dropped an awkward curtsy, watching the small man stroll beside the grave
servant, talking lightly of the prospects for the harvest, tugging documents out to read.
She crumbled bread between her fingers in silent disbelief.

There are not many who would mourn the Earl of Steen.

Was he talking about assassination? Was he sincere, or was it some plan of the Queen's
to trap her, to test her loyalty? If she reported it or kept silent, either way might be a
mistake.

She tossed the bread on the dark water, watching the bigger mallards with their green-
sheened necks peck and bully the smaller ones aside. Her life was a labyrinth of plots


and pretense, and the only person she could trust in all of it was Jared.

119
She dusted her fingers together, cold in the sun. Because he might be dying.

\"Claudia.\" Evian had returned; he held a letter up between plump fingers. \"Good news,
my dear, of your fianc\x{fffd}.\" He looked at her, his face unreadable. \"Caspar is traveling
nearby. He will be here tomorrow.\"

It shook her. She smiled rigidly and threw the last crumbs onto the water. They floated for
seconds. Then they were snatched away.

***

KEIRO HAD stuffed a pack with plunder--fine clothes, gold, jewels, a firelock. It must have
been heavy, but he wouldn't be complaining; Finn knew it would hurt him far more to leave
any of it behind. For himself, he had brought one spare set of clothes, some food, a
sword, and the Key. That was all he wanted. Looking down at his share of the
accumulated riches in the chest had filled him with self-loathing, brought back the
Maestra's scorching stare of scorn. He had shut the lid with a bang.

Seeing Gildas's lantern ahead, he ran behind his oathbrother, glancing back anxiously.

Incarceron's night was inky. But the Prison never slept. One of its small red Eyes opened,
turned, and clicked as he raced below it, and the sound swept a small shiver of dismay
through his skin. But the Prison would watch curiously. It played with its inmates, allowed
them to kill, wander, fight, and love until

<<120|3:1>>
it grew tired and tormented them with Lockdowns, with twisting the very shape of itself.
They were its only amusement, and maybe it knew there was no Escape.

\"Hurry.\" Gildas was waiting impatiently. He had brought nothing but a satchel of food and
medicines and his staff; he strapped that to his back and glanced up the ladder into the
shaft. \"We get up to the transitway; the top may be guarded, so I'll go first. From there it's
two hours to the door.\"

\"Through Civicry territory,\" Keiro muttered.


Gildas eyed him coldly. \"Y can still go back.\"
                          ou

\"No he can't, old man.\"

Finn spun, Keiro at his side.

From the sides and shadows of the tunnels the Comitatus swaggered; red-eyed, ket-high,
crossbows drawn, firelocks in their hands. Finn saw Big Arko flex his shoulders and grin;
Amoz swung his fearsome axe.

Among his bodyguards, glowering and huge, Jormanric stood. Red juice stained his
beard like blood.

\"No one's going anywhere,\" he growled. \"Neither is that Key.\"

121

10
***

The eyes in the corridor were dark and watchful and there were many of them.

\"Come out,\" he said.

They came out. They were children. They wore rags and their skin was livid with sores.

Their veins were tubes, their hair wire. Sapphique reached out and touched them.

\"You are the ones who will save us,\" he said.

--Sapphique and the Children

***

No one spoke. Finn stepped away from the ladder; he drew his sword and realized Keiro
was already armed, but what use were two blades against so many?

Big Arko broke the tension. \"Never thought you'd run out on us, Finn.\"

Keiro's smile was steely. \"Who says we are?\"


\"The sword in your hand says it.\"

He lumbered toward them, but Jormanric stopped him with the back of a mailed glove
against his chest. Then the Winglord looked beyond Finn and Keiro. \"Can there really be
a device that will open every lock?\" His voice was slurred but his eyes

122
were intent. Finn felt Gildas step down from the ladder.

\"I believe so. It was sent to me from Sapphique.\" The old man tried to push past, but Finn
caught hold of his belt and stopped him. Annoyed, Gildas jerked free and pointed a bony
finger. \"Listen to me, Jormanric. I have given you excellent advice for many years. I've
healed your wounded and tried to bring some sort of order into this hellhole you've
created. But I come and go when I choose and my time with you is over.\"

\"Oh yes,\" the big man said grimly. \"That's true enough.\"

The Comitatus exchanged grins. They moved closer. Finn caught Keiro's eye; together
they closed around Gildas.

Gildas folded his arms. His voice was rich with contempt. \"Do you think I fear you?\"

\"I do, old man. Under all that bluster, you fear me. And you have cause.\" Jormanric rolled
ket around his tongue. \"Y    ou've stood behind me at enough hand loppings, tongue
splittings, seen enough men's heads spitted on pikes to know what I will do.\" He
shrugged. \"And your voice has grated on me of late. I'm sick of being lectured and
berated. So here's a proposition for you. Get lost before I cut your tongue out myself.
Climb the ladder and join the Civicry. We won't miss you.\"

That wasn't true, Finn thought. Half the Comitatus owed life and limbs to Gildas. He'd
patched them and sewn their wounds after too many fights, and they knew it.

Gildas laughed sourly. \"And the Key?\"

123
\"Ah.\" Jormanric's eyes narrowed. \"The magic Key and the Starseer. I can't let them go.
And no one ever deserts the Comitatus.\" He turned his stare on Keiro. \"Finn will be
useful, but you, deserter, the only Escape you'll make is through Death's Door.\"

Keiro didn't flinch. He stood tall, his handsome face flushed with controlled anger, though
Finn sensed the finest tremble in the hand that held the sword. \"Is that a challenge?\" he


snapped. \"Because if its not, I make it <<one|9f>>.\" He looked around, at all of them. \"This isn't
about some crystal trinket, or about the Sapient. This is about you and me, Winglord, and
it's been coming a long time now. I've seen you betray anyone who's threatened you, send
them into ambushes, poison them, bribe their oathbrothers, make your warband a sludge
of ket-heads without a brain cell between them. But not me. I call you a coward,
Jormanric. A fat coward, a murderer, a liar. Worn out, finished. Old?

Silence.

In the dark shaft the words rang as if the Prison whispered them mockingly around and
around. Finn's grip on his sword was so tight, the cords scorched him; his heart
hammered. Keiro was crazy. Keiro had finished them. Big Arko glowered; the girls Lis
and Ramill watched avidly.

Behind them he saw the dog-slave, creeping closer on its chain.

Everyone looked at Jormanric.

124
He moved instantly. He pulled a thick ugly knife and the sword from his back, and was on
Keiro before anyone could yell.

Finn leaped away; Keiro's sword flashed up by instinct and the blades clanged.

Jormanric's face was red with rage, the blood pulsing in the thick veins of his neck. Right
into Keiro's face he spat, \"You're dead, boy.\" Then he attacked.

The Comitatus howled with delight; they whooped and closed around in a tight ring,
clashing weapons, stamping in unison. They loved to see bloodshed and most of them
had felt the whiplash of Keiro's arrogance; now they'd see him brought down. Finn was
shoved heedlessly aside; he tried to slash a space, but Gildas hauled him away. \"Stay
back!\"

\"Hell be killed!\"

\"If he is, it's no loss.\"

Keiro was fighting for his life. He was young and fit, but Jormanric was twice his weight,
old in warcraft, berserk with a battle frenzy that came on him rarely. He hacked at Keiro's
face, at his arms, following up with quick slashes of the knife. Keiro staggered back,
colliding with one of the Comitatus, who shoved him heartlessly again into the ring; off
balance, he nailed forward, and Jormanric struck.


\"No!\" Finn yelled.

The blade sliced across Keiro's chest; he whipped his face aside with a gasp. A spatter
of blood hit the crowd.

Finn had his own knife ready to throw, but there was no

125
chance; the fighters were too far and Keiro concentrating too hard to glance away. A hand
caught Finns arm; in his ear Gildas murmured, \"Back off toward the shaft. No one will see
us go.\"

Finn was too dismayed to answer. Instead he pulled away and tried to shove into the
center of the ring, but a great arm slid around his neck. \"No cheating, brother.\" Arko's
breath stank of ket.

Despairing, Finn watched. Keiro could never survive this. He was already cut on the leg
and wrist; shallow nicks but bleeding freely. Jormanric's eyes were glazed, his ket-stained
teeth set in a bared grin. His onslaught was a barrage of violence; he fought without fear
or self-awareness, sparks clashing from the blades.

Breathless, Keiro flicked one look of terror sideways; Finn struggled and kicked to get to
him. Jormanric roared, a howl of savagery that set all his men yelling encouragement; he
took one step forward and swung his sword in an arc of whipping steel.

And staggered.

For a moment, just a second, he was off balance. Then he fell, a crashing, inexplicable
fall, his feet whipped behind him, tangled in a chain that slid between the feet of the
crowd, looped around a pair of filthy hands muffled in rags.

Keiro leaped on him. He slammed a bone-crunching blow down on the Winglord's mailed
back; Jormanric howled in fury and pain.

126
The shouts of the Comitatus died abruptly. Arko let go of Finn.

Keiro was white with strain but he didn't stop. As Jormanric rolled, he stamped on the
Winglord's left arm; it cracked, an ominous sound. The knife spilled onto the floor.
Jormanric heaved himself up to his knees, head down, groaning over his shattered arm,
swaying.


From the corner of his eye Finn saw a commotion in the crowd; the dog-creature was
being hauled out. He squirmed toward it as it was kicked and cursed, but even as he got
there one of its tormentors fell, doubled up by a blow from Gildas's staff. \"I'll deal with
this,\" the Sapient roared. \"Stop them before someone dies!\"

Finn swung back, in time to see Keiro kick Jormanric full in the face.

The Winglord still clung to his sword, but another callous blow to the head laid him out; he
crashed spread-eagle, a pool of blood at nose and mouth.

The crowd was silent.

Keiro flung his head back and screamed with triumph.

Finn stared. His oathbrother was transformed. His eyes were bright, his hair sweat-dark
and slicked to his scalp, his hands streaked with blood. He seemed taller, glowing with a
sleek and concentrated energy that scorched away all weariness; he raised his head and
stared around at them all, a raw, blind unrecognizable stare, seeing nothing, challenging
everything.

127
Then, deliberately, he turned back, put the point of his blade to the vein in Jormanric's
neck, and pushed.

\"Keiro,\" Finns voice was sharp. \"Don't.\"

Keiro's eyes swung to him. For a moment it seemed as if he had to struggle to recognize
who had spoken. Then he said hoarsely, \"He's finished. I'm Winglord now.\"

\"Don't kill him. Y don't want his pitiful little kingdom.\" Finn held his gaze steadily. \"Y
                  ou                                                                      ou
never did. Outside, that's what you want. Nowhere else is big enough for us.\"

Down the shaft, as if in answer, a warm breeze drifted.

For a moment Keiro stared at Finn, then at Jormanric. \"Give this up?\"

\"For more. For everything.\"

\"A lot to ask, brother.\" Looking down, he lifted the sword blade away, slowly. The Winglord
took a deep ragged breath. And then with one vicious jerk Keiro stabbed the sword down
into Jormanric's open palm.


The Winglord howled and flailed. Pinned to the ground he convulsed with agony and
wrath, but Keiro knelt and began to tug the liferings from his fingers, the thick skull-faced
bands.

\"Leave them!\" Gildas's yell came from behind them. \"The Prison!\"

Finn looked up. Lights exploded on around him, flared red. A thousand Eyes winked
open. Alarms broke out into a terrible ululating scream.

128
It was a Lockdown.

The Comitatus split, pushed, fragmented into a panicking mob, and as the wall slots slid
open and light cannon flashed, they were fleeing, Jormanric's bleeding agony ignored.
Finn hauled Keiro away. \"Forget them!\"

Keiro shook his head, shoved three rings inside his jerkin. \"Go! Go!\"

A croak from behind. \"Did you think I killed the woman, Finn?\"

Finn turned.

Jormanric squirmed in pain. He spat the words like venom. \"Not true. Ask your brother.
Y stinking, treacherous brother. Ask him why she died.\"
 our

Laserfire flickered like steel rods between them. For a second Finn couldn't move; then
Keiro was back, yanking him down. Sprawled on the filthy floor they crawled toward the
shaft. The corridor was a sparking grid of energy; efficiently Incarceron restored order,
slammed down grilles and doors, emitted a hiss of foul-smelling yellow gas into the
enclosed tunnels.

\"Where is he?\"

\"There.\" Finn saw Gildas scrambling over bodies; he was dragging the dog-slave, its
chains swaying and tripping him. Snatching the sword from Keiro, Finn pulled the
creature toward him and hacked at the rusty manacles. The sharp blade severed them
instantly. He looked up and saw brown eyes, bright in the ragged bindings around the
face.

129
\"Leave it! It's diseased.\" Keiro shouldered past, flinched at a burst of fire that seared the


roof, and jumped for the ladder. In seconds he was racing up the darkness of the shaft.

\"He's right,\" Gildas said heavily. \"It will slow us.\"

Finn hesitated. In the uproar and crashing alarms and falling steel he looked back and the
eyes of the leprous slave watched him. But it was the Maestra's eyes he saw, her voice
that spoke inside his mind.

I will never dare show kindness to a stranger again.

Instantly he stooped, hauled the creature onto his back, and climbed.

Keiro was clattering above, Gildas a wheezing mutter below. As he dragged himself up
the rungs, Finn was soon breathless with the weight on his back; the creatures muffled
paws gripped him tight, its heels dug into his stomach. He slowed; after thirty rungs he
had to stop, breathless, arms like lead. He clung on, gasping.

In his ear, a voice whispered, \"Let me go. I can climb.\"

Astonished, he felt the creature crawl from him, skitter onto the ladder, and scramble up in
the dark. Below, Gildas thumped his foot. \"Get on! Quickly!\"

Dust billowed up the shaft, and the eerie hiss of gas. He hauled himself on, higher and
higher until the muscles in his calves and thighs were weak, his shoulders aching with
grabbing upward and raising his own weight.

And then without warning he was in wider space, half

130
falling onto the transitway, Keiro yanking him out. They hoisted Gildas up, and
speechless, stared down. Stabs of light flickered far below. Red alarms rang; tendrils of
gas made Finn cough. Through watering eyes he saw a panel shoot sideways across the
shaft, sealing it with a clang. And then, silence.

***

THEY DIDN'Tspeak. Gildas took the creature's hand and Finn stumbled behind with
Keiro, because now the climb and the fight were taking their toll, and Keiro was suddenly
exhausted, his cuts dripping a telltale trail of blood on the metallic walkways. They hurried
without stopping through the labyrinth of tunnels, past doorways with Civicry markings,
barred entrances, squeezing through a portcullis with vast, useless squares. And always
they were listening, because if the Civicry found them, they would stand no chance. Finn


found himself sweating at each turn of the passage, at each distant clang or echoing
whisper, straining his ears at shadows and a scurrying Beetle, sweeping a small chamber
in endless circles.

After an hour, limping with weariness, Gildas led them into a passageway that became a
sloping gallery lit by rows of alert Eyes, and at its top, far up in the dark, he stopped and
slid down against a tiny locked door.

Finn helped Keiro to sit and collapsed beside him. The dog-creature was a huddle on the
floor. For a moment the narrow

131
space was racked with painful breathing. Then Gildas roused himself.

\"The Key,\" he croaked. \"Before they find us.\" Finn took it out. There was a single crack in
the door, hexagonal, ringed with speckles of quartz. He put the Key in the lock and turned
it.

\"Why here?\" Claudia trailed after him, between the hedges. \"Obviously,\" Jared
murmured, \"because no one else can find the way through.\"

Nor could she. The yew maze was ancient and complex, the thick hedges impenetrable.
Once when she was small, she had been lost in here for a whole long summers day,
wandering and sobbing with anger, and the nurse and Ralph had organized a search and
been almost hysterical with panic before she'd been found sleeping under the astrolabe
in the central glade. She didn't remember getting there, but sometimes now, at the edge


of her dreams, the drowsy heat came back to her, the bees, the brass sphere against the
sun.

\"Claudia. You've missed the turn.\"

She backtracked, and found him waiting, patiently. \"Sorry. Miles away.\"

133
Jared knew the way well. The maze was one of his favorite haunts; he came here to read
and study and discreetly test various forbidden devices. Today it was peaceful after the
frantic packing and panic in the house. Threading the mown paths after his shadow,
Claudia breathed in the rose-scents, fingering the Key in her pocket.

It was a perfect day, not too hot, a few delicate clouds. A shower of rain was scheduled for
<<three fifteen|5k:1>>, but they should be finished by then. As she turned a corner and came
suddenly to the central glade, she looked around in surprise.

\"It's smaller than I remembered.\"

Jared raised an eyebrow. \"Things always are.\"

The astrolabe was blue-green copper and apparently decorative; beside it a wrought-iron
seat sank elegantly into the turf, a bush of bloodred roses rambling over its back. Daisies
studded the grass.

Claudia sat, knees up under her silk dress. \"Well?\"

Jared put his scanner away. \"Seems safe.\" He turned and sat on the bench, leaning
forward, his frail hands nervously folding together. \"So. Tell me.\"

She repeated Evian's conversation quickly, and he listened, frowning. When she'd
finished she said, \"It may be a trap, of course.\"

\"Possible.\"

She watched him. \"What do you know about these Steel

Wolves? Why wasn't I told?\"

134
He didn't look up, and that was a bad sign; she felt a thread of fear unwind down her


spine.

Then he said, 'I've heard of them. There have been rumors, but no one's sure who is
involved, or how real the conspiracy is. Last year an explosive device was discovered in
the Palace, in a room where the Queen was expected. Nothing new there, but a small
emblem was found too, hanging from the window catch, a small metal wolf.\" He watched
a ladybug scaling a blade of grass. \"What will you do?\"

\"Nothing. Y She took the Key out and held it in both hands, letting the sunlight catch its
            et.\"
facets. \"I'm not an assassin.\"

He nodded, but seemed preoccupied, staring hard at the crystal.

\"Master?\"

\"Something's happening.\" Absorbed, he reached out for the Key and took it from her.
\"Look at it, Claudia.\"

The tiny lights were back, this time moving deep, a rapid, repeated pattern. Jared placed
the artifact quickly on the bench. \"It's getting warm.\"

Not only that, but there were sounds coming from it. She brought her face nearer, heard a
clatter and a ripple of musical notes.

Then the Key spoke.

\"Nothings happening'' it said.

Claudia gasped and jerked away; wide-eyed she stared at Jared. \"Did you ...?\"

135
\"Quiet. Listen!\"

Another voice, older, rasping. \"Look closer, fool boy. There are lights inside it.\"

Claudia knelt, fascinated. Jared's delicate fingers slid silently into his pocket. He took the
scanner out and placed it beside the Key, recording.

The Key chimed, a soft sound. The first voice came again, oddly distant and excited. \"It's
opening. Get back!\"

And then a sound came out of the artifact, a heavy clang, ominous and hollow, so that she


took a moment to register it, to recognize what it was.

A door. Unlocking.

A heavy, metallic door, perhaps ancient, because it groaned on its hinges, and there was
a clatter and smash, as if rust fell, or debris shuddered from its lintel.

Then silence.

The lights in the Key reversed, changed to green, went out. Only the rooks in the elms by
the moat karked. A blackbird landed in the rosebush and flicked its tail. \"Well,\" Jared said
softly.

He adjusted the scanner and ran it over the Key again. Claudia reached out and touched
the crystal. It was cold. \"What happened? Who were they?\"

Jared turned the scanner to show her. \"It was a fragment of conversation. Real-time. A
phonic link opened and closed very briefly. Whether you initiated it or they did I'm not
sure.\"

136
\"They didn't know we were listening.\"

\"Apparently not.\"

\"One of them said, 'There are lights inside it.'\"

The Sapient's dark eyes met hers. \"You're thinking they may have a similar device?\"

\"Yes!\" She scrambled up, too excited to sit, and the blackbird flew off in alarm. \"Listen,
Master, as you said, this isn't just a key to Incarceron. Maybe it's also a device to
communicate!\"

\"With the Prison?\"

\"The inmates.\"

\"Claudia ...\"

\"Think about it! No one can go there. How else does he monitor the Experiment?
Overhear what's happening?\"


He nodded, his hair in his eyes. \"It's possible.\"

\"Only...\" She frowned, knotting her fingers together. Then she turned on him. \"They
sounded wrong.\"

\"Y must be more precise in speech, Claudia. How, wrong?\"
  ou

She searched for the word. When it came, it surprised her. \"They sounded scared.\"

Jared considered. \"Y ... they did.\"
                    es

\"And what would they be scared of? There's nothing to fear in a perfect world, is there?\"

Doubtfully, he said, \"We may have overheard some form of drama. A broadcast.\"

\"But if they have that ... plays, films, then they have to know about danger, and risk, and
terror. Is that possible? Can

137
you do that if your world is perfect? Would they even be able to create such a story?\"

The Sapient smiled. \"That is a point we could debate, Claudia. Some people would say
your own world is perfect, and yet you know those things.\"

She scowled. \"All right. There's something else too.\" She tapped the wide-winged eagle.
\"Is this just for listening? Or can we use it to speak to them?\"

He sighed. \"Even if we can, we shouldn't. Conditions in Incarceron are strictly controlled;
everything was carefully calculated. If we introduce variables, if we open even a tiny
keyhole into that place, we may ruin everything. We can't admit germs into Paradise,
Claudia.\"

Claudia turned. \"Y but...\"
                  es,

She froze.

Behind Jared, in the gap in the hedges, her father was standing. He was watching her.
For a moment her heart leaped with the terrible shock; then she let the practiced smile
slip gracefully over her face. Sir!

Jared stiffened. The Key lay on the bench; he slid out his hand, but it was just out of reach.


\"I've been looking everywhere for you both.\" The Warden's voice was soft, his dark velvet
coat an emptiness at the heart of the sunlit glade. Jared looked up at Claudia, white-
faced. If he saw the Key ....

138
The Warden smiled calmly. \"I have some news, Claudia. The Earl of Steen has arrived.
Y fianc\x{fffd} is looking for you.\"
 our

For one cold moment she stared at him. Then she stood, slowly.

\"Lord Evian is entertaining him but will only bore him. Are you pleased, my dear?\"

He came to take her hand; she wanted to step aside to hide the glittering crystal from
him, but she couldn't move. Then Jared gave a murmur and slumped forward slightly.

\"Master?\" Alarmed, she broke from her father's grip. \"Are you in pain?\"

Jared's voice was hoarse. \"I ... No ... Just faint, for a moment. Nothing to worry about.\"

She helped him to sit up. The Warden stood above them, his face a mask of concern. He
said, \"I'm afraid you're overdoing things lately, Jared. Sitting out in the sun is not good for
you. And so much study, at all hours of the night.\"

Jared stood shakily. \"Y Thank you, Claudia. I'm fine now. Really.\"
                       es.

\"Perhaps you should get some rest,\" she said.

\"I will. I'll go up to my tower, I think. Please excuse me, sir.\"

He stumbled up. For one terrible second Claudia thought her father would not move. He
and Jared stood face-to-face. Then the Warden stepped back, his smile wry. \"If you'd like
supper sent up, we'll have it seen to.\"

Jared just nodded.

139
Claudia watched her tutor walk carefully between the yew hedges. She dared not look at
the bench, but she knew it would be empty.

The Warden went and sat down, stretching out his legs and crossing them at the ankles.
\"A remarkable man, the Sapient.\"


She said, \"Y How did you get in here?\"
            es.

He laughed. \"Oh Claudia. I designed this maze before you were born. No one knows its
secrets as I do, not even your precious Jared.\" He turned, one arm over the back of the
bench. Quietly he said, \"I think you have done something to disobey me, Claudia.\"

She swallowed. \"Have I?\"

Her father nodded gravely. Their eyes met.

He was doing what he always did, teasing her, playing games with her. Quite suddenly
she couldn't bear it anymore, the plotting, the stupid game. She stood, furious. \"All right! It
was me who broke into your study.\" She faced him, her face hot with anger. \"Y know ou
that, you've known it since you went in there, so why are we pretending! I wanted to see
inside, arid you never let me. Y never let me in. So I broke in. I'm sorry, all right? I'm
                                 ou
sorry!\"

He stared at her. Was he shaken? She couldn't tell. But she was shaking, all the pent-up
fear and rage of years bursting out, the fury that he made her life so false, and Jared's
too.

He held up a hand hastily. \"Claudia, please! Of course I knew. I'm not angry. Rather, I
admire your ingenuity. It will come in useful in your life at the Palace.\"

140
She stared. For a moment he had been startled. More than that. Dismayed.

And he had not mentioned the Key.

The breeze rippled the rosebush, bringing a waft of its cloying scent, a silent surprise that
he had revealed so much. When he spoke again his voice had its normal acid tone. \"I
hope you and Jared enjoyed the challenge.\" He stood abruptly. \"The Earl is waiting.\"

She scowled. \"I don't want to see him.\"

\"Y have no choice.\" He bowed and strode toward the gap in the hedge, and she swung
  ou
around and glared at his back. Then she said, \"Why are there no pictures of my mother in
the house?\"

She had no idea she was going to say it. It came out in a harsh demand quite unlike her
own voice.


He stopped dead.

Her heart thudded; she was appalled at herself. She didn't want him to turn, to answer,
didn't want to see his face. Because if he showed weakness, she would be terrified; his
controlled poise was hateful and yet if it broke, she had no idea what might be
underneath.

But he spoke without turning. \"Don't go too far, Claudia. Don't try my patience.\"

***

WHEN HE was gone she found she was sitting on the bench in a huddle, the muscles of
her back and shoulders tight with tension, her hands clenched on the silk of her skirt. She
made herself take a slow breath.

141
Then another.

Her lips were salty with sweat.

Why had she asked him that? Where had it come from? Her mother was someone she
never thought of, never even imagined. It was as if she had never existed. Even when
she'd been small, looking at the other girls at Court with their fussing mamas, she had
had no curiosity about her own.

She gnawed the bitten nails on her fingers. It had been a deadly mistake. She should
never, never have said that.

\"Claudia!\"

A loud, demanding voice. She closed her eyes.

\"Claudia, it's no good hiding in all these hedges.\" Branches swished and cracked. \"Talk
to me! I can't find the right way!\"

She sighed. \"So you've finally arrived. And how is my husband-to-be?\"

\"Hot and irritable. Not that you care. Look, there are five paths here at a meeting point.
Which do I take?\"

His voice was close; she could smell the expensive cologne he used. Not splashed on,
like Evian, but just enough. \"The one that looks least likely,\" she said. \"Toward the house.\"


The peevish mutter became more distant. \"Like our engagement, many would say.
Claudia, get me out of here!\"

She scowled. He was worse than she remembered.

Y thrashed and snapped.
 ew

She stood quickly, brushing down her dress, hoping her face was not as pale as she felt.
On her left the hedge shuddered. A

142
sword came through and hacked an opening, and his big silent bodyguard, Fax, stepped
through, looked quickly around, then held open the branches. Through them came a thin
youth, his mouth sour with dissatisfaction. He glared at her crossly. \"Look at my clothes,
Claudia. They re ruined. Quite ruined.\"

He kissed her coldly on one cheek. \"Anyone would think you were avoiding me.\"

\"So you've been expelled,\" she said calmly.

\"I left.\" He shrugged. \"Too boring. My mother sends you this.\"

It was a note, on white thick paper, sealed with the Queen's white rose. Claudia opened it
and read.

My dear,

You will have heard the good news that your

wedding is imminent. After waiting all these

years, am sure yours excitement is as intense as my own! Caspar insisted on coming
to escort you

here--such a romantic. What a handsome couple

you will make. From now on, my dear you must

think of me as your loving mother.


Sia Regina.

Claudia folded it. \"Did you insist?\"

\"No. She sent me.\" He kicked the astrolabe. \"What a bore getting married is going to be,
Claudia. Don't you think?\" She nodded, silent.

143

***

The decay was gradual and we were slow to recognize it. Then, one day, I had been
talking with the Prison, and as I left the room I heard it laugh. A low mocking chuckle.
                                                                       ,

The sound turned me cold. I stood in the corridor and the thought came to me of an
ancient image I had once seen in a fragmented manuscript, of the enormous mouth of
Hell devouring sinners.

It was then I knew we had created a demon that would destroy us.

--Lord Calliston's Diary

***

The sound of the unlocking was painful, as if the Prison sighed. As if this was a door that
had not been opened for centuries. But no alarms howled. Perhaps Incarceron knew no
door could lead them out.

Gildas stepped back at Finn's warning; chunks of debris and a red rain of rust clattered.
The door shuddered inward, and stuck.

For a moment they waited, because the narrow slit was dark and a cool, oddly sweet-
smelling air moved beyond. Then Finn kicked the rubble aside and put his shoulder to the
door. He

144
heaved, and rammed it until it stuck again. But now there was room to squeeze through.

Gildas nudged him. \"Take a look. Be careful.\"


Finn glanced back at Keiro, sitting slumped and weary. He drew his sword and slipped
sideways through the gap.

It was colder. His breath frosted. The ground was uneven, and ran downhill. As he took a
few steps a strange tinny litter rustled around his ankles; putting a hand down, he felt drifts
of crisp stuff, cold and wet, sharp against his fingertips. As his eyes grew used to the
deeper gloom, he thought he was standing in a sloping hall of columns; tall black pillars
rose to a tangle overhead. Groping to the nearest one, he felt it over with his hands,
puzzled. It was icy cold and hard, but not smooth. A mass of fissures and cracks seamed
it, knots and swelling growths, and branches of intricate mesh.

\"Finn?\"

Gildas was a shadow at the door.

\"Wait.\" Finn listened. The breeze moved in the tangle, making a faint silvery tinkle that
seemed to stretch for miles. After a moment he said, \"There's no one here. Come
through.\"

A few rustles and stirrings. Then Gildas said, \"Bring the Key, Keiro. We need to shut this.\"

\"If we do, can we get back?\" Keiro sounded worn.

\"What's to get back for? Give me a hand.\" As soon as the dog-slave had slipped through,
Finn and the old man shoved and forced the tiny door back into its frame. It clicked quietly
shut.

145
A rustle. A scrape of sound. Light, steadying, in a lantern.

\"Someone might see it,\" Keiro snapped.

But Finn said, \"I told you. We're alone.\"

As Gildas held the lantern high, they looked around at the ominous enclosing pillars.
Finally Keiro said, \"What are they?\"

Behind him, the dog-creature crouched down. Finn glanced at it, and knew it was looking
at him.

\"Metal trees.\" The light caught the Sapient's plaited beard, the gleam of satisfaction in his
eye. \"A forest where the species are iron, and steel, and copper, where the leaves are


thin as foil, where fruits grow gold and silver.\" He turned. \"There are stories, from the old
times, of such places. Apples of gold guarded by monsters. It seems they're true.\"

The air was cold and still. It held an alien sense of distance. It was Keiro who asked the
question Finn didn't dare to.

\"Are we Outside?\"

Gildas snorted. \"Do you think it's that easy? Now sit before you fall.\" He glanced at Finn.
'I'll deal with his wounds. This is as good a place as any to wait for Lightson. We can rest.
Even eat.\"

But Finn turned and faced Keiro. He felt cold and sick, but he spoke the words stubbornly.
\"Before we go any further I want to know what Jormanric meant. About the Maestra's
death.\"

There was a second of silence. In the ghostly light Keiro gave

146
Finn one exasperated glare and crumpled wearily in the rustling leaves, pushing back his
hair with blood-streaked hands. \"For God's sake, Finn, do you really think I know? Y ou
saw him. He was finished. He would have said anything! It was just lies. Forget it.\"

Finn looked down at him. For a second he wanted to insist, ask again, to silence the
nagging fear inside him, but Gildas eased him aside. \"Make yourself useful. Find
something to eat.

While the Sapient poured water, Finn tipped out a few packages of dried meat and fruit
from his pack and another lantern, which he lit from the first. Then he trampled down the
icy metal leaves into a clotted mass, spread some blankets on them, and sat. In the
shadowed forest beyond the pool of light, small rustles and scrapings disturbed him; he
tried to ignore them. Keiro swore viciously as Gildas cleaned his cuts, stripped his jacket
and shirt, and rubbed chewed-up herbs of a disgusting pungency onto the wound across
his chest.

In the shadows the dog-slave crouched, barely visible. Finn took one of the food packets,
opened it, and held some out.

\"Take it,\" he whispered.

A rag-bound hand, crusted with sores, snatched it from him. While the creature ate he
watched, remembering the voice that had answered him, a low, urgent voice. Now he


whispered, \"Who are you?\"

\"Is that thing still here?\" Sore and irritable, Keiro pulled his

147
jacket back on and laced it, scowling at the slashes and tears. Finn shrugged.

\"We dump it.\" Keiro sat, wolfed down the meat, and looked around for more. \"It's poxed.\"

\"Y owe that thing your life,\" Gildas remarked.
  ou

Hot, Keiro glared up. \"I don't think so! I had Jormanric where I wanted him.\" His eyes
turned to the creature; then they widened in sudden fury and he leaped up, strode to
where it crouched, and snatched away something dark. \"This is mine!\"

It was his bag. A green tunic and a jeweled dagger spilled out. \"Stinking thief.\" Keiro
aimed a kick at the creature; it jerked away. Then, to their astonishment, it said in a girl's
voice, \"Y should be grateful to me for bringing it.\"
         ou

Gildas turned on his heel and stared at the shadow of rags. Then he stabbed a bony
finger at it. \"Show yourself,\" he said.

The ragged hood was pushed back, the wrapped paws unwound bandages and gray
strips of binding. Slowly, out of the crippled huddle a small figure emerged, crouched up
on its knees, a dark cropped head of dirty hair, a narrow face with watchful, suspicious
eyes. She was layered with clothes strapped and tied to make humps and bulges; as she
tugged the clotted wrappings from her hands, Finn stepped back in disgust at the open
sores, the running ulcers. Until Gildas snorted. \"Fake.\"

He strode forward. \"No wonder you didn't want me near you.\"

In the dimness of the metal forest the dog-slave had become a small thin girl, the sores
clever messes of color. She stood

148
upright slowly, as if she had almost forgotten how. Then she stretched and groaned. The
ends of the chain around her neck clattered and swung.

Keiro laughed harshly. \"Well, well. Jormanric was slyer than I thought.\"

\"He didn't know.\" The girl looked at him boldly. \"None of them knew. When they caught me


I was with a group--one old woman died that night. I stole these rags from her body and
made the sores out of rust, rubbed muck all over myself, hacked off my hair. I knew I had
to be clever, very clever, to stay alive.\"

She looked scared, and defiant. It was hard to tell her age; the brutal haircut made her
seem like a scrawny child, but Finn guessed she was not so much younger than himself.
He said, \"It didn't turn out to be such a good idea.\"

She shrugged. \"I didn't know I'd end up as his slave.\"

\"And tasting his food?\"

She laughed then, a bitter amusement. \"He ate well. It kept me alive.\"

Finn glanced at Keiro. His oathbrother watched the girl, then turned away and curled up in
the blankets. \"We dump her in the morning.\"

\"It's not up to you.\" Her voice was quiet but firm. \"I'm the servant of the Starseer now.\"

Keiro rolled and stared. Finn said, \"Me?\"

\"Y brought me out of that place. No one else would have
  ou

149
done that. Leave me, and I'll follow you. Like a dog .\" She stepped forward, \"I want to
Escape. I want to find the Outside, if there is one. And they said in the slavehall that you
see the stars in your dreams, that Sapphique talks to you. That the Prison will show you
the way out because you're its son.\"

He stared at her in dismay. Gildas shook his head. He looked at Finn and Finn looked
back.

\"Up to you,\" the old man muttered.

He had no idea what to do, so he cleared his throat and said to the girl, \"What's your
name?\" \"Attia.\"

\"Well, look, Attia. I don't want a servant. But ... you can come with us.\"

\"She has no food. That means we have to feed her,\" Keiro said.

\"Neither do you.\" Finn nudged the pack of clothes. \"Or me, now.\"


\"Then she shares your catch, brother. Not mine.\"

Gildas leaned back against one of the metal trees. \"Sleep,\" he said. \"We'll discuss it
when the lights come on. But someone has to keep watch, so first it can be you, girl.\"

She nodded, and as Finn curled up uneasily in the blankets, he saw her slip into the
shadows and vanish.

Keiro yawned like a cat. \"She'll probably slit our throats,\" he muttered.

150
***

CLAUDIA SAID, \"I said good night, Alys,\" and watched in her dressing table mirror as
her nurse fussed over silk garments strewn on the floor.

\"Look at this, Claudia, it's ruined with mud ...\"

\"Put it through the washing machine. I know you've got one somewhere.\"

Alys gave her a glare. They both knew the endless archaic scrubbing and beating and
starching of clothes was so wearing that the staff had secretly abandoned Protocol long
ago. It was probably the same even at Court, Claudia thought.

As soon as the door was closed she jumped up and went over and locked it, turning the
wrought-iron key and clicking on all the secrecy systems. Then she leaned her back
against it and considered.

Jared had not been at supper. That didn't mean anything; he would have wanted to keep
up the pretense, and he hated the Ear's stupidity. For a moment she wondered if he really
had been ill in the maze, and whether she should call him, but he had warned her to keep
the minicom for emergencies, especially with the Warden in the house.

She tied the belt of her dressing gown and jumped on the bed, reaching up to grope in
the canopy of the four-poster.

Not there.

The house was quiet now. Caspar had talked and drunk his way through supper; fourteen
courses of fish and finches,


151
capons and swan, eels and sweetmeats. He had talked loudly and peevishly about
tournaments, his new horse, a castle he was having built on the coast, the sums he had
lost at gambling. His new passion seemed to be boar-hunting, or at least staying well
back while his servants trussed a wounded boar for him to kill. He had described his
spear, the kills he had made, the tusked heads that adorned the corridors of the Court.
And all the time he had drunk and refilled and his voice had grown more and more
hectoring and slurred.

She had listened with a fixed smile and had teased him with odd, barbed questions that
he had barely understood. And all the time her father had sat opposite and toyed with the
stem of his wineglass, turning it on the white cloth between his thin fingers, looking at her.
Now, as she jumped down and went over to the dressing table, searching through all the
drawers, she remembered that cool look, how it appraised her sitting there, beside the
fool she would have to marry.

It wasn't in any of the drawers.

Suddenly chilled, she went to the window and unlatched it, letting the casement swing
open, curling herself up in a miserable huddle on the cushions of the window seat. If he
loved her, how could he do this to her? Couldn't he see the misery it would be?

The summer evening was warm and smelled sweetly of stocks and honeysuckle and the
hedge of musk-roses that

152
curved around the moat. From far over the fields the bell of Hornsely church softly tolled
twelve chimes. She watched as a moth fluttered in and swooped recklessly around the
flame of the candles; its shadow briefly huge on the ceiling.

Had there been a new edge in his smile? Had that stupid blurted question about her
mother sharpened the danger?

Her mother had died. That's what Alys had said, but Alys hadn't been working here then,
nor had any of the servants except Medlicote, her father's secretary, a man she rarely
spoke to. But maybe she should. Because that question had gone in like a knife, through
the Warden's studied armor of grave smiles and cold Period decorum. She had stabbed
him and he had felt it.

She smiled, her face hot.

It had never happened before.


Could there be something strange about her mother's death? Illness was rife, but for the
rich, illegal drugs could be found. Medicines too modern for this Era. Her father was strict,
but surely if he had loved his wife he would have done anything, however illegal, to save
her. Could he have sacrificed his wife just because of Protocol? Or was it worse than
that?

The moth scuttered on the ceiling. Leaning forward, she looked out of the window at the
sky.

The summer stars were bright. They lit the roofs and gables of the manor house with a
faint, ghostly glimmer, an

153
owl-light, reflecting the black and silver ripples of the moat.

Her father was implicated in Giles's death. Could he have killed before?

A touch on her cheek made her jump. The moth wings brushed her, whispered, \"In the
window seat\" and were gone, fluttering out toward the faint light in Jared's tower.

Claudia grinned.

She pushed herself up, groped under the cushions, and touched the cold edge of crystal.
Carefully, she pulled it out.

The Key took the light of the stars and held it. It seemed to shine with a faint
luminescence, and the eagle within it held a sliver of light in its beak.

Jared must have brought it here while everyone was at supper.

She took the precaution of blowing the candles out and closing the window. Tugging the
heavy quilt from her bed, she wrapped herself in it and propped the Key on her knees.
Then she touched it, rubbed it, breathed on it.

\"Speak to me,\" she said.

***

FINN WAS so cold he barely had the energy even to shiver.

The metal forest was utterly black; the lantern threw only a tiny pool of light, on Keiro's


sprawled hand, on the huddle that was Gildas. The girl was a shadow under a tree; she
made no sound and he wondered if she was even asleep.

He reached out cautiously for Keiro's pack. He would pull

154
one of his oathbrother's fancy jackets over his own. <<Two|9k:0>>, maybe, and if they split Keiro
could put up with it.

Tugging the pack over, he put his hand in, and touched the Key.

It was warm.

He lifted it out, very gently, and let his fingers close over it, so that the heat it was
generating comforted his cramped fingers. Quietly it said, \"Speak to me.\"

Wide-eyed, Finn glanced at the others.

No one moved.

Carefully, his leather belt creaking in the stillness, he stood up and turned. He managed
three steps before the rustling crunch of the metal leaves made Keiro mutter and turn
over.

Behind the tree, Finn froze.

He brought the Key up to his ear. It was silent. He touched it, all over, shook it. Then he
whispered to it, \"Sapphique. Lord Sapphique. Is that you?\"

CLAUDIA GASPED.

The answer had come so clearly. She looked wildly around for anything to record this on,
saw nothing and cursed. Then she said, \"No! No. My name's Claudia. Who are you?\"

\"Quiet! They'll wake up.\"

\"Who will?\"

There was a pause. Then he said, \"My friends.\" He sounded breathless, oddly terrified.

155


\"Who are you?\" she said. \"Where are you? Are you a Prisoner? Are you in Incarceron?\"

HE JERKED his head back and stared at the Key in disbelief.

There was a small blue light in the heart of it; he bent closer so that it lit his skin. \"Of
course I am. Do you mean ... Are you ... Outside?\"

There was silence. It lasted so long he thought the link had been broken; he said hurriedly,
\"Did you hear me?\" and at the same time the girl said, \"Are you still there?\" in awkward
collision.

Then she said, \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't be speaking to you. Jared warned me about this.\"

\"Jared?\"

\"My tutor.\"

He shook his head, and his breath frosted the crystal.

\"But look,\" she said, \"it's too late now and I can't believe a few words can damage a
centuries-old experiment, do you?\"

He had no idea what she was talking about. \"Y are Outside, aren't you? Outside exists?
                                             ou
The stars are there, aren't they?\"

He was terrified she wouldn't answer, but after a moment she said, \"Y I'm looking at
                                                                     es.
them.\"

He breathed out in amazement; the crystal furred instantly with frost.

\"Y didn't tell me your name,\" she said.
  ou

\"Finn. Just Finn.\"

156
Silence. A self-conscious stillness, the Key clumsy in his hands. There was so much he
wanted to ask, to know, that he didn't know where to begin. And then she said, \"How are
you speaking to me, Finn? Is it a crystal key, with the hologram of an eagle inside?\"

He swallowed. \"Y A key.\"
                es.

A rustle, behind him. He looked around the tree, saw Gildas snore and grunt.


\"Then we each have a replica of the same device.\" She sounded quick, thoughtful, as if
she was used to solving problems, working out solutions; a clear voice that made him
remember suddenly, with the tiniest spark of pain, candles. The seven candles on the
cake.

At that moment, with their usual abruptness, the lights of Incarceron came on.

He gasped, saw that he was standing in a landscape of copper and gilt and tawny
redness. The forest stretched for miles, sloping down, far down into a wide, undulating
landscape. He stared at it in astonishment.

\"What was that? What happened? Finn?\"

\"The lights went on. I ... I'm in a new place, a different Wing. A metal forest.\"

She said oddly, \"I envy you. It must be fascinating.\"

\"Finn?\" Gildas was on his feet, looking around. For a moment Finn wanted to call him
over, and then caution set in. This was his secret. He needed to keep it.

157
\"I have to go,\" he said hurriedly. \"1'll try and speak to you again ... now we know... that is, if
you want to. But you have to,\" he added urgently. \"Y have to help me.\"
                                                        ou

The girl's answer surprised him. \"How can I help you? What can be wrong in a perfect
world?\"

Finn's hand tightened as the blue light faded. Desperately he whispered, \"Please. You
have to help me Escape.\"

158
***

Walls have ears.

Doors have eyes.

Trees have voices.

Beasts tell lies.


Beware the rain.

Beware the snow.

Beware the man

You think you know.

--Songs of Sapphique

***

Finn's voice. As she pulled on the gauntlet and flexed the foil, his voice whispered again
inside her mask.

You have to help me Escape....

\"En garde, please, Claudia.\" The swordmaster was a small gray man who sweated
profusely. His sword crossed hers; he gave signals with the tiny precise movements of a
skilled fencer. Automatically she responded, practicing lunges, parries--sixte, septime,
octave--as she had done since she was six.

There had been something familiar about the boy's voice. Inside the warm darkness of
the mask she bit her lip,

159
attacked, took quarte, riposted, hitting the maestro's padded jacket with a satisfying thud.

The accent, the slightly slow vowels. It was how they spoke at Court.

\"Feint of straight thrust, disengage, please.\"

She obeyed, hot now, the glove already softened with sweat, the foil whipping, the small
clicks of the familiar exercise comforting, the control of the sword forcing her mind to
speed.

You have to help me Escape.

Fear. Fear in the whispering, of being overheard, of saying what he said. And the word
Escape like a holy thing, forbidden, full of awe.


\"Quarte counter quarte, please, Claudia. And keep your hand high.\"

She took the parries absently, the blades of the foils sliding past her body. Behind the
maestro Lord Evian came out of the main door into the courtyard and stood on the steps,
taking snuff. He watched her, elegantly poised.

Claudia frowned.

She had so much to think about. The fencing lesson was her own escape. In the house it
was chaos; her clothes being packed, the last measurements for the wedding dress, the
books she refused to leave behind, the pets she insisted came with her. And now this.
One thing--Jared would have to carry the Key. It wouldn't be safe in her baggage.

They were fighting now. She let all thoughts go,

160
concentrated on the hits, the clicked parries, the bending of the foil as she hit once, again,
again.

Until finally he stepped back. \"Very good, my lady. Y point control remains excellent.\"
                                                     our

Slowly she took off her mask and shook his hand. Close up, he looked older, and a little
sad.

\"I'll be sorry to lose such a pupil.\"

Her hand clenched on his. \"Lose?\"

He stepped back. \"I... it seems... after your wedding ...\"

Claudia restrained her anger. She released his hand and drew herself up. \"After my
marriage I will still require your services. Please disregard anything my father has said
about this. Y will travel with us to the Court.\"
             ou

He smiled, and bowed. His doubt showed; as she turned away and took the cup of water
from Alys, she felt the heat of humiliation scorch her face.

They were trying to isolate her. She had expected this; Jared had warned her of it. At
Queen Sia's court they wanted her alone with no one to trust, no one to plot with. But she
was having none of that.

Lord Evian had waddled over. \"Quite wonderful, my dear.\" His small eyes enjoyed her


figure in the fencing breeches.

\"Don't patronize me,\" she snapped, \"waving Alys away, she took the cup and jug and
stalked to a bench that stood at the edge of the green lawn. After a moment Evian came
after her. She turned on him. \"I need to talk to you.\"

161
\"The house overlooks us,\" he said quietly. \"Anyone can see.\"

\"Then wave your handkerchief and laugh. Or whatever it is spies do.\"

His fingers closed the snuffbox. \"Y are angry, Lady Claudia. But not, I think, with me.\"
                                   ou

That was true. But still she glared at him. \"What do you want from me?\"

He smiled serenely at the ducks on the lake, the small black moorhens in the rushes. \"As
yet, nothing. Obviously we will make no move until after the wedding. But then, we will
need your help. The Queen must be dealt with first--she is the most dangerous. And then,
when you are safely Queen, your husband will meet with some accident...\"

She drank the cold water. Upside-down in the cup she saw Jared's tower reflected, the
blue sky behind it, the tiny windows in perfect Protocol.

\"How do I know this isn't a trap?\"

He smiled. \"Does the Queen doubt you? She has no reason.

Claudia shrugged. She only met the Queen at festivals. The first rime had been at her
betrothal, and that had been years ago. She remembered a slim blond woman in a white
dress, sitting on a throne that had seemed to have hundreds of steps up to it, and she had
had to climb every one, concentrating, carrying the basket of flowers that was almost as
big as she had been.

162
The Queen's hands, the nails a glossy red.

The cool palm on her forehead.

The words. \"How charming, Warden. How sweet.\"

\"Y could be recording this,\" she said. \"Y could be testing me ... my loyalty.\"
  ou                                     ou


Evian sighed, a tiny sound. \"I assure you ...\"

\"Assure all you like, it could be true.\" She dumped the cup and picked up the towel Alys
had left, wiping her face with its softness. Then she turned. \"What do you know about
Giles's death?\"

It startled him. His pale eyes widened slightly. But he was practiced at deception; he
answered without giving anything away. \"Prince Giles? He fell from his horse.\"

\"Was it an accident? Or was he murdered?\"

If he was recording this, she knew she was finished now.

His stubby fingers folded together. \"Really, my dear ...\"

\"Tell me. I need to know. Of all people it concerns me most. Giles was ... we were
betrothed. I liked him.\"

\"Yes.\" Evian looked at her shrewdly. \"I see.\" He seemed uncertain, then, as if he'd made
up his mind, he said, \"There was something strange about the death.\"

\"I knew it! I told Jared--\"

\"The Sapient knows about this?\" He looked up in alarm. \"About me?\"

\"I would trust Jared with my life.\"

\"Those are the most dangerous people.\" Evian turned,

163
watching the house. One of the ducks meandered toward him; he gave a flurried wave
and it padded away, quacking.

\"We never know where the listeners are,\" he said quietly, staring after it. \"That is what the
Havaarna have done to us, Claudia. They have riddled us with fear.\"

For a moment he seemed almost shaken; then he brushed an invisible crease from his
silk suit and said in his changed voice, \"Prince Giles rode out that morning without any of
his usual attendants. It was a fine spring morning; he was well, in good health, a laughing
boy of fifteen years. Two hours later a messenger thundered in on a horse white with
sweat; he leaped from it and raced into the hall of the Court, ran up the steps, and threw


himself at the Queens feet. I was there, Claudia. I saw her face when they told her of the
accident. She is a pale woman, as they all are, but then she was white. If it was an act, it
was expert. They brought the boy back on a hastily made bier of boughs, their coats laid
over his face. Grown men were weeping.\"

Impatient, Claudia said, \"Go on.\"

\"They laid him in state. Wearing a great gold robe and a tunic of white silk embroidered
with the crowned eagle. Thousands filed past him. Women sobbed. Children brought
flowers. How beautiful he was, they said. How young.\"

He watched the house.

\"But there was something odd. A man. His name was Bartlett. A man who had looked
after the boy from his earliest

164
years. He was old now, retired and feeble. They allowed him in to see the body late one
afternoon, when the people had left. They brought him through the pillars and shadows of
the Chamber of State and he climbed the steps with difficulty and looked down at Giles.
They thought he would weep and wail and howl with grief. They thought he would tear his
clothes with agony. But he didn't.\"

Evian looked up and she saw his small eyes were shrewd. \"He laughed, Claudia. The old
man laughed.\"

***

AFTER TWO hours walking through the metallic forest the snow began.

Stumbling over a root of copper and out of a daydream, Finn realized it had been falling
for some time; it was already coating the leaf-litter with a fine frost. He looked back, his
breath smoking.

Gildas was a little way behind, talking to the girl. But where was Keiro?

Finn turned quickly. All morning he had been unable to stop thinking of that voice, the
voice from Outside, where the stars were. Claudia. How had she been able to speak to
him? He felt the cold lump of the Key inside his shirt; its awkwardness comforted him.
\"Where's Keiro?\" he said.

Gildas stopped. He planted his staff in the ground and leaned on it. \"Scouting ahead.


Didn't you hear him tell you?\" Suddenly he strode forward and looked hard at Finn, the
blue

165
eyes clear as crystal in his small lined face. \"Are you well? Is this a vision coming on you,
Finn?\"

Tm fine. Sorry to disappoint you.\" Sickened by the eagerness in the Sapient's voice Finn
looked at the girl. \"We need to get that chain off you.\"

She had wrapped it around her like a necklace to stop it swinging. He could see the raw
skin under the collar where she had padded it with cloth. She said quietly, \"I can manage.
But where are we?\"

Turning, he stared over the miles of forest. A wind was rising, the metallic leaves meshing
and rustling. Far below, the wood was lost under snow clouds, and high above the roof of
the Prison was a distant oppression, its lights misted and faint.

\"Sapphique came this way.\" Gildas sounded tense with excitement. \"In this forest he
defeated his first doubts, the dark despairs that told him there was no way on. Here he
began the climb out.\"

\"But the way leads down,\" Attia said quietly.

Finn looked at her. Beneath the dirt and hacked hair her face was lit with a strange joy.
\"Have you been here before?\" he asked.

\"No. I was from a small Civicry group back there. We never left the Wing. This is so ...
wonderful.\"

The word made him think of the Maestra, and the chill of guilt struck through him, but
Gildas pushed past and strode on. \"It may appear to lead downhill, but if the theory that

166
Incarceron is underground is true, we must climb eventually. Perhaps beyond the wood.\"

Appalled, Finn gazed at the forested leagues. How could Incarceron be so vast? He had
never imagined it would be like this. Then the girl said, \"Is that smoke?\"

They followed her pointing finger. Far oft, in the distant mists, a thin column rose and
dissipated. It looked like the smoke from a fire, he thought.


\"Finn! Give me a hand!\"

They turned. Keiro was dragging something out from the thickets of copper and steel; as
they ran over to him Finn saw that it was a small sheep, one of its legs crudely repaired,
the circuits exposed.

\"Y re still thieves then,\" Gildas said acidly.
  ou

\"Y know the rule of the Comitatus.\" Keiro sounded cheerful. \"Everything belongs to the
  ou
Prison, and the Prison is our Enemy.\"

He had already cut its throat. Now he looked around. \"We can butcher it here. Well, she
can. She may as well make herself useful.\"

None of them moved. Gildas said, \"It was stupid. We have no idea of what inmates are
here. Or of their strength.\"

\"We have to eat!\" Keiro was angry now, his face darkening. He threw the sheep down.
\"But if you don't want it, fine!\"

There was an awkward silence. Then Attia said simply,

\"Finn?\"

167
He realized she would do it if he asked her to. He didn't want to have that power. But
Keiro was glowering, so he said, \"All right. I'll help you.\"

Side by side, they knelt and cut the sheep up. She borrowed Gildas's knife and worked
efficiently; he realized she had done it often before, and when he was clumsy, she pushed
him aside and dissected the raw flesh. They took only a little; they had no way of carrying
more or any tinder to cook it on as yet. Only half the beast was organic; the rest was a
patchwork of metal, ingeniously put together. Gildas raked over the remains with his stick.
\"The Prison breeds its beasts less well these days.\"

He sounded grave. Keiro said, \"What do you mean, old man:

\"What I say. I can remember when the creatures were all flesh. Then circuits began to
appear, tiny things, threaded instead of vein, of cartilage. The Sapienti have always
studied and dissected any tissue we could find. At one time I offered rewards for
carcasses brought to me, though the Prison was usually too quick.\"


Finn nodded. They all knew that the remains of any dead creature vanished overnight; that
Incarceron sent its Beetles out instantly and collected the raw material for recycling.
Nothing was ever buried here, nothing burned. Even those of the Comitatus who had
been killed were left, wrapped in their favorite possessions, decked with flowers, in a
place by the abyss. In the morning, they were always gone.

168
To their surprise Attia spoke. \"My people knew this. For a long time now the lambs have
been like this, and the dogs. Last year, in our group, a child was born. Its left foot was
made of metal.\"

\"What happened to it?\" Keiro asked quietly.

\"The child?\" She shrugged. \"They killed it. Such things can't be allowed to live.\"

\"The Scum were kinder. We let all sorts of freaks live.\"

Finn glanced at him. Keiro's voice was acid; he turned and led the way through the wood.
But Gildas didn't move. Instead he said, \"Don't you see what it means, fool boy? It means
the Prison is running out of organic matter ...\"

But Keiro wasn't listening. He lifted his hand, alert.

A sound was rising in the wood. A low whisper, a rustling breeze. Tiny at first, barely
raising the leaves, it stirred Finn's hair, Gildas's robe.

Finn turned. \"What is it?\"

The Sapient moved, pushing him on. \"Hurry. We must find shelter. Hurry!\"

They ran between the trees, Attia always at Finn's heels. The wind grew rapidly. Leaves
began to lift, swirl, fly past them. One nicked Finn's cheek; putting his hand up to the
sudden sting he felt a cut, saw blood. Attia gasped, her hand protecting her eyes.

And all at once they were in a blizzard of metal slivers, the leaves of copper and steel and
silver a razor-sharp whirlwind in

169
the sudden storm. The wood groaned and bent, twigs cracked with snaps that rang in the
invisible roof.


As he ran, ducking and breathless, Finn heard the roar of the storm like a great voice. It
raged at him, picked him up and threw him; its anger crashed him against the metal
trees, it bruised him and beat at him. Stumbling, he knew the leaves were its words,
arrows of spite, that Incatceron was taunting him, its son, born from its cells, and he
stopped, bent over, gasping, \"I hear you! I hear you! Stop!\"

\"Finn!\" Keiro yanked him down. He slid, the ground giving way, crumpling into a hollow
between the tangled roots of some vast oak.

He landed on Gildas, who shoved him off. For a moment each of them caught breath,
listening to the deadly leaves slicing the air outside, the whine and hum. Then Attia's
muffled voice came from behind.

\"What is this place?\"

Finn turned. Behind them he saw a dull rounded hollow, seamed deep under the steel
oak. Too low to stand up in, it extended back into darkness. The girl, on hands and knees,
crept inside. Foil leaves crackled under her; he smelled a musty, odd tang, saw that the
walls sprouted fungi, contorted, spore-dusted masses of flabby growth.

\"It's a hole,\" Keiro said sourly. He drew his knees up, brushed litter from his coat, and then
looked at Finn. \"Is the Key safe, brother?\"

170
\"Of course it is,\" Finn muttered.

Keiro's blue eyes were hard. \"Well, show me.\"

Oddly reluctant, Finn put his hand into his shirt. He drew the Key out, and they saw the
crystal glimmer in the dimness. It was cold, and to Finn's relief, silent.

Attia's eyes went wide.

\"Sapphique's Key!\"

Gildas turned on her. \"What did you say?\"

But she wasn't looking at the crystal. She was staring at the picture scratched
meticulously onto the back wall of the tree, smeared by centuries of dirt and overgrown by
green lichen, the image of a tall, slim, dark-haired man sitting on a throne, in his upheld
hands a hexagonal slot of darkness.


Gildas took the Key from Finn. He slotted it into the aperture. Instantly it began to glow;
light and heat burned from it, showing them one another's dirty faces, the slanting cuts,
brightening the furthest recesses of the hollow.

Keiro nodded. \"We seem to be going the right way,\" he muttered.

Finn didn't answer. He was watching the Sapient; the glow of awe and joy on the old
man's face. The obsession. It chilled him to the bone.

\"I don't think you'll be wanting all this junk.\" Caspar picked a book out of the pile and
opened it. He gazed idly at the bright illuminated letters. \"We have books at the Palace. I
never bother with them.\"

\"Y do surprise me.\" Claudia sat on the bed and gazed around hopelessly at the chaos.
  ou
How could she have so many possessions? And so little time!

\"And the Sapienti have thousands.\" He tossed it aside. \"Y are so lucky, Claudia, that
                                                               ou
you never had to go to the Academy. I thought I'd die of dullness. Anyway, aren't we going
out with the hawks? The servants can do all this. It's what they're for.\"

\"Yes.\" Claudia was biting her nail; she realized, and stopped.

\"Are you trying to get rid of me, Claudia?\"

She looked up. He was watching her, his small eyes fixed

172
in that nerveless stare. \"I know you don't want to marry me,\" he said.


\"Caspar ...\"

\"It's all right, I don't mind. It's a dynastic thing, that's all. My mother's explained it. Y can
                                                                                             ou
have any lovers you like, after we've had an heir. I certainly will.\"

She stared at him in disbelief. She couldn't sit still; she jumped up and paced the
disrupted room. \"Caspar, listen to yourself!\" Have you ever thought about what sort of life
we'll have together, in that marble mausoleum you call a palace? Living a lie, a pretense,
keeping false smiles on our faces, wearing clothes from a time that never existed, posing
and preening and aping manners that should only be in books? Have you thought about
that?\"

He was surprised. \"It's always been like that.\"

She sat next to him. \"Have you never wanted to be free, Caspar? To be able to ride out
alone one spring morning and set off to see the world? To find adventure, and someone
you can love?\"

It was too much. She knew it as soon as she had said it. Too much for him. She felt him
stiffen and frown, and he glared at her. \"I know what all this is about.\" His voice was harsh.
\"It's because you'd have rather had my brother. The saintly Giles. Well, he's dead,
Claudia, so forget about him.\" Then his smile came back, sly and narrow. \"Or is this about
Jared?\"

\"Jared?\"

173
\"Well, it's obvious, isn't it? He's older, but some girls like that.\"

She wanted to slap him, to get up and slap his sniggering little face. He grinned at her.
\"I've seen how you look at him, Claudia. Like I said, I don't mind.\"

She stood, stiff with anger. \"Y evil little toad.\"
                               ou

\"You're angry. That proves it's true. Does your father know about you and Jared, Claudia?
Should I tell him, do you think?\"

He was poison. He was a lizard with a flicking tongue. His smirk was acid. She bent and
put her face into his and he moved back.

\"If you mention this again, to me, to anyone, I will kill you. Do you understand, my lord


Steen? Myself personally, with a dagger through your weak little body. I will kill you like
they killed Giles.\"


Trembling with wrath she marched outside and slammed the door with a clap that rang
down the corridor. Fax, the bodyguard, was lounging outside. As she passed him he
stood, with an insolent slowness, and as she ran beneath the portraits to the stairs, she
felt his eyes on her back, the cold smile.

She hated them.

All of them.

How could he say that!

How could he even think it! Thundering down the stairs, she crashed through the double
doors, maids scattering before her,

174
her mood like thunder. Such a filthy lie! Against Jared! Jared, who would never dream,
never even think of such a thing!

She screamed for Alys, who came running. \"What's wrong, lady?\"

\"My riding coat. Now!\"

While she waited she fumed, pacing, staring through the open front door at the eternal
perfection of the lawns, the blue sky, the peacocks practicing their eerie cries.

Her anger was warm and a comfort. When the coat came she flung it around her,
snapped, \"I'm riding out.\"

\"Claudia ... There's so much to do! We leave tomorrow.\"

\"Y do it.\"
  ou

\"The wedding dress ... the final fitting.\"

\"Y can tear it to shreds as far as I'm concerned.\" Then she was gone, running down the
  ou
steps and across the courtyard, and as she ran, she looked up and saw her father,
standing in the impossible window of his study that didn't exist, wasn't even there.

He had his back to her, was talking to someone. Someone in the study with him? But no
one ever went in there.

Slowing, she watched for a moment, puzzled. Then, afraid he'd turn around, she hurried to


the stables and found Marcus already saddled, pawing the ground with impatience.
Jared's horse was ready too, a lean rangy creature called Tam Lin, which was probably
some secret Sapient jest she'd never understood.

175
She looked around. \"Where's the Wise One?\" she asked Job.

The boy, always tongue-tied, muttered, \"Gone back to the tower, lady. He forgot
something.\"

She stared at him. \"Job, listen to me. Y know everyone on the estate?\"
                                        ou

\"Pretty much.\" He swept the floor hastily, raising clouds of dust. She wanted to tell him to
stop, but that would have made him even more nervous, so she said, \"An old man called
Bartlett. Pensioned off, a retainer of the Court. Is he still alive?\"

He raised his head. \"Y my lady. He has a cottage out on Hewelsfield. Just down the
                      es,
lane from the mill.\"

Her heart thudded. \"Is he ... Is his mind still clear?\"

Job nodded, and managed a smile. \"He's razor-sharp, that one. But he doesn't say much,
not about his days at Court. He just stares if you ask him.\"

Jared's shadow darkened the doorway and he came in slightly breathlessly. \"Sorry,
Claudia.\"

He swung himself up into the saddle, and as she put her foot in Job's linked hands, she
said quietly, \"What did you forget?\"

His dark eyes met hers. \"A certain object that I didn't want to leave unguarded.\" His hand
moved discreetly to his coat, the high-necked Sapient robe of dark green.

She nodded, knowing it was the Key.

As they rode off she wondered why she felt so oddly ashamed.

176
***

THEY MADE a fire from the dried fungi and some snapping powder from Gildas's pack


and cooked the meat while the whirlwind raged outside. No one spoke much. Finn was
shivering with cold, and the cuts on his face stung; he sensed that Keiro was still weary
too. It was hard to tell about the girl. She sat slightly apart, eating quickly, her eyes
watching and missing nothing.

Finally Gildas wiped greasy hands on his robe. \"Were there any signs of the inmates?\"

\"The sheep were roaming,\" Keiro said carelessly. \"Not even a fence.\"

\"And the Prison?\"

\"How should I know? Eyes in the trees probably.\"

Finn shivered. His head felt echoey and strange. He wanted them to sleep, to fall asleep
so he could get the Key out again and talk to it. To her. The girl Outside. He said, \"We
can't move on, so we may as well rest. Don't you think?\"

\"Sounds good,\" Keiro said lazily. He arranged his pack against the back of the hollow.
But Gildas was staring at the image carved in the tree trunk. He crawled closer, reached
out, and began to rub at it with his veined hands. Curls of lichen fell. The narrow face
seemed to emerge from dinginess and the green fur of moss, its hands holding the Key
so carefully drawn, they seemed real. Finn realized that the Key must be linking into some
circuitry in the tree itself and for a moment

177
a blur of vision caught him off guard, a sense that the whole of Incarceron was a great
creature in whose entrails of wire and bone they crept.

He blinked.

No one seemed to have noticed, though the girl was staring at him. Gildas was saying,
\"He's leading us along the way he took. Like a thread through the labyrinth.\"

\"So he left his own picture?\" Keiro drawled.

Gildas frowned. \"Obviously not. This is a shrine, created by the Sapienti who have
followed him. We should find other signs on the way.\"

\"I can't wait.\" Keiro rolled himself over and curled up.

Gildas glared at his back. Then he said to Finn, \"Take the Key out. We need to take care
of it. The way may be longer than we think.\"


Thinking of the vast forest outside, Finn wondered if they would wander in it forever.
Carefully he reached up and removed the Key from the hexagon; it came away with a
slight click, and instantly the hollow was dim and the whistling splinters of foil blurred the
distant Prison lights.

Finn was stiff and uncomfortable, but he kept still, listening. After a long while he knew by
the old mans harsh breathing that Gildas was sleeping. He wasn't sure about the others.
Keiro had his face turned away. Attia always seemed silent, as if she had learned that
keeping still and being overlooked kept her alive. Outside, the forest roared with the
storm. He heard

178
the cracking of its branches, the turmoil of its contempt surge from far distances, felt the
strength of the wind batter the trees, shudder the iron trunk above him.

They had angered Incarceron. They had opened one of its forbidden doors and crossed
some boundary. Perhaps it would trap them here forever, before they had barely begun.

At last, he couldn't wait any longer.

Cautiously, taking infinite pains to keep the rustle of the leaf-litter down, he tugged the Key
from his pocket. It was cold, frosted with cold. His ringers left smeared imprints on it, and
even the eagle inside was hard to see until he had rubbed condensation from its surface.

He held it tight. \"Claudia\" he breathed.

The Key was cold and dead.

No lights moved in it. He dared not speak louder.

But just then Gildas muttered, so he took the chance and curled up, bringing k closer.
\"Can you hear me?\" he said to it. \"Are you there? Please, answer.\"

The storm raged. It whined in his teeth and nerves. He closed his eyes and felt despair,
that he had imagined all of it, that the girl did not exist, that he was indeed born in some
Womb here.

And then, as if out of his own fear, came a voice, a soft remark. \"Laughed? Are you sure
that's what he said?\"

Finn's eyes snapped open. A man's voice. Calm and considering.


179
He glanced around wildly, afraid the others had heard, and then a girl said, \"... Of course
I'm sure. \"Why should the old man laugh, Master, if Giles was dead?\"

\"Claudia.\" Finn whispered the name before he could stop himself.

Instantly Gildas turned; Keiro sat up. Cursing, Finn shoved the Key into his coat and rolled
over to see Attia staring at him. He knew at once that she'd seen everything.

Keiro had his knife out. \"Did you hear that? Someone outside.\" His blue eyes were alert.

\"No.\" Finn swallowed. \"It was me.\"

\"Talking in your sleep?\"

\"He was talking to me,\" Attia said quietly.

For a moment Keiro looked at them both. Then he leaned back, but Finn knew he was not
convinced. \"Was he now?\" his oathbrother said softly. \"So who's Claudia?\"

***

THEY CANTERED quickly up the lane, the deep green leaves of the oaks a tunnel over
their heads. \"And you believe Evian?\"

\"On this I do.\" She looked ahead at the mill rising at the foot of the hill. \"The old man's
reaction was all wrong, Master. He must have loved Giles.\"

\"Grief affects people strangely, Claudia.\" Jared seemed worried. \"Did you tell Evian you
would find this Bartlett?\"

\"No. He--\"

\"Did you tell anyone? Alys?\"

180
She snorted. \"Tell Alys and it's around the servants' hall in minutes.\" That reminded her.
She slowed the breathless horse. \"My father paid off the swordmaster. Or tried to. Has he
said anything more to you?\"

\"No. Not yet.\"


They were silent while he leaned down and unlatched the gate, easing the horse back to
drag it wide. On the other side the lane was rutted, lined by hedgerows, dog-roses twined
among nettles and willow-herb, the white umbels of cow-parsley.

Jared sucked at a sting on his finger. Then he said, \"That must be the place.\"

It was a low cottage half obscured by a great chestnut that grew beside it. As they rode
closer Claudia scowled at its perfect Protocol, the thatch with holes in it, the damp walls,
the gnarled trees of the orchard. \"A hovel for the poor.\"

Jared smiled his sad smile. \"I'm afraid so. In this Era only the rich know comfort.\"

They left the horses tied, cropping lush long grass from the verge. The gate was broken,
hanging wide; Claudia saw how it had recently been forced, how the grass blades were
dragged back under it, still wet with dew.

Jared stopped. \"The doors open,\" he said.

She went to step past him, but he said, \"A moment, Claudia.\" He took out the small
scanner and let it hum. \"Nothing.

No one here.\"

181
\"Then we go in and wait for him. I've only got today.\" She strode up the cracked path;
Jared followed quickly.

Claudia pushed the door wider; it creaked and she thought something shuffled inside.
\"Hello?\" she said quietly.

Silence.

She put her head around the door.

The room was dark and smelled of smoke. A low window lit it, the shutter off and leaning
against the wall. The fire was out in the hearth; as she came in she saw the blackened
cooking pot on its chains, the spit, ashes drifting in the draft down the great chimney.

Two small benches lined the chimney corner; near the window stood a table and chair
and a dresser with some battered pewter plates and a jug on it. She picked the jug up
and sniffed the milk inside.


\"Fresh.\"

There was a small doorway into the cow byre. Jared crossed to it and looked through,
stooping under the lintel.

His back was to her, but she knew, from his sudden, intent stillness, something was
wrong. \"What?\" she said.

He turned, and his face was so pale, she thought he was ill. He said, \"I'm afraid we're too
late.\"

She came over. He stayed, blocking her way. \"I want to see,\" she muttered.

\"Claudia...\"

\"Let me see, Master.\" She ducked under his arm.

182
The old man lay sprawled on the floor of the byre. It was quite obvious that his neck was
broken. He lay on his back, arms flung out, one hand buried in the straw. His eyes were
open.

The byre smelled of old dung. Flies buzzed endlessly and wasps came in and out through
the open doorway; a small goat bleated outside.

Cold with awe and anger she said, \"They killed him.\"

\"We don't know that.\" Jared seemed to come to life all at once. He knelt by the old man,
touched neck and wrist, ran the scanner over him.

\"They killed him. He knew something about Giles, about the murder. They realized we
were coming here!\"

\"Who could have realized?\" He stood quickly, stepped back into the living room.

\"Evian knew. My talk with him must have been bugged. Then there's Job. I asked him ...\"

\"Job's a child.\"

\"He's scared of my father.\"


\"Claudia, I'm scared of your father,\"

She looked again at the small figure in the straw, letting her anger loose, clutching her
arms around herself, \"Y can see the marks,\" she breathed.
                       ou

Hand marks. Two bruises like the dark traces of thumbs, deep in the mottled flesh.
\"Someone big. Very strong.\"

Jared jerked open the cupboard in the dresser and pulled out plates. \"Certainly he didn't
fall.\"

183
She turned.

He slammed the drawer, went to the chimney, and stared up. Then to her astonishment he
climbed on one of the benches and reached into the darkness, groping blindly. Soot fell in
showers.

\"Master?\"

\"He lived at Court, Claudia. He must have been literate.\"

For a moment she didn't understand. Then she turned and gazed hurriedly around, found
the bed, tipped the mattress up, tore open the lice-ridden straw.

Outside, a blackbird shrieked and flapped.

Claudia stared. \"Are they coming back?\"

\"Maybe. Keep looking.\"

But as she moved her foot caught on a board that creaked, and when she knelt and pulled
at it, it swung up on a pivot with the ease of constant use.

\"Jared!\"

It was the old man's store of treasures. A battered purse with some copper coins, a
broken necklace with most of the stones pried out, two quills, a fold of parchment, and,
carefully hidden right at the bottom, a blue velvet drawstring bag, small as her palm.

Jared took the parchment and riffled through it. \"Looks like some sort of testament. I knew
he would have written it down! If he'd been taught by Sapienti, it's only ...\" He glanced


over. She had opened the blue bag. Out of it she slid a small oval of

184
gold, its back engraved with the crowned eagle. She turned it over.

A boy's face looked up at them, his smile shy and direct, his eyes brown.

Claudia smiled back at him, bitter. She looked up at her tutor. \"It must be worth a fortune,
but he never sold it. He must have loved him very much.\"

Gently he said, \"Are you sure ...?\"

\"Oh yes, I'm sure. It's Giles.\"

***

Sapphique rode out of the Tanglewood and saw the Fortress of Bronze. People were
streaming into its walls from all around.

\"Come inside,\" they urged him. \"Hurry! Before it attacks!\"

He looked around. The world was metal and the sky was metal. The people were ants
on the plains of the Prison.

\"Have you forgotten he said, \"that you are already Inside?\"

But they hurried past and said he was deranged.

***

The storm had raged all night before dying away so abruptly that Finn had been woken at
once by the silence. It seemed eerie after the wind, but at least it meant they could move
now, before the Prison changed its mind. Keiro had scrambled outside and stretched,
groaning with cramp. After a minute his voice had come back, unusually muted. \"Look at
this.\"

When Finn had pulled himself up, he had seen that the forest was bare. Every leaf, every
thin metallic curl of foliage lay heaped in immense drifts.

188
The trees had broken out into flower. Copper blossoms, scarlet and gold, glimmered up
hill and down dale as far as he could see.

Behind him, Attia had laughed. \"It's beautiful.\"

He had turned, surprised, realizing he saw it only as an obstacle. \"Is it?\"

\"Oh yes. But you ... you're used to color. Coming from Outside\"

\"Y believe me?\"
  ou

She nodded slowly. \"Y There's something different about you. Y don't fit. And the
                       es.                                        ou
name you called out in your sleep, this Claudia. Y remember her?\"
                                                  ou

It was what he had told them. He looked up. \"Listen, Attia, I need your help. It's just... I
need sometimes to be alone. The Key ... it helps the visions. Sometimes I need to be
away from Keiro and Gildas. Do you understand?\"

She had nodded gravely, her bright eyes fixed on him. \"I told you, I'm your servant. Just tell
me when, Finn.\"

He had felt ashamed. Looking at his face, she had said nothing more.

Since then they had hurried through a landscape of jewel-bright color, between
plantations of trees that had marched downhill, the forest floor broken and seamed with
streams in strange insulated beds, riven with cracks. Insects Finn had never imagined
crawled in great drifts of leaves that blocked the path; finding detours around these lost
them hours. And

189


high, in the bare branches jackdaws hopped and karked in flocks, following the travelers
with beady curiosity till Gildas cursed them and waved a fist at them. Then, silently, they all
flew away.

Keiro nodded. \"So the Sapienti still have some magic after all.\"

Breathless, the old man glared at him. \"I wish it worked on you.\"

Keiro grinned at Finn,

Finn allowed himself a smile. He felt lighter somehow, and as he trudged after Gildas
down the aisles of the wood, he began to sense something that must be like happiness.
The Escape had begun. The Comitatus was far behind; all that life of brutal infighting, of
murder and lies and fear was over. Things would be different now. Sapphique would show
him the way out.

Stepping over a tangle of root he almost felt like laughing aloud, but instead he put his
hand inside his shirt and touched the Key.

He jerked his hand away at once.

It was warm.

He glanced at Keiro, pacing ahead. Then he turned. Attia was where she always walked.
At his heels.

Annoyed, he stopped. \"I don't want a slave.\"

She stopped too. \"Whatever you say.\" Her eyes watched him with that bruised look.

190
He said, \"There's a stream here, I can hear it. Tell the others I'm getting some water.\"

Without waiting, he strode off the path deep into a thicket of platinum thorns, then
crouched among the undergrowth. Umbels of pliant wire rose around him, hollow reeds
where microBeetles worked busily.

Hurriedly he took out the Key.

It was a risk. Keiro might come. But it was hot now in his fingers, and there were the
familiar small blue lights deep in the crystal. \"Claudia?\" he whispered anxiously. \"Can you
hear me?


\"Finn! At last!\"

Her voice was so loud it made him swallow; he glanced around. \"Quiet! Be quick please.
They'll come looking for me.\"

\"Who will?\" She sounded fascinated.

\"Keiro.\"

\"Who's he?\"

\"My oathbrother ...\"

\"All right. Now listen. There's a small finger panel at the base of the Key. It's invisible but
the surface is slightly raised. Can you find it?\"

His fingers groped, leaving dirty smudges. \"No,\" he said, flustered.

\"Try! Do you think he has a different artifact?\" The question wasn't for Finn. The other
voice answered her, the one he remembered as Jared. \"It's almost certainly

191
identical. Finn, use your fingertips. Search the edge, the facets near the edge.\"

What did they think he was! He scrabbled, his hands sore.

\"Finn!\" Keiro's murmur was right behind him. He jumped up, shoving the Key back,
gasped, \"For God's sake! Can't I take a drink in peace?\"

His brother's hand shoved him back down into the leaf drift. \"Get down and shut up.
We've got visitors.\"

CLAUDIA SAT back on her heels and swore with frustration. \"He's gone! Why is he
gone?\"

Jared went to the window and gazed out at the utter chaos in the courtyard. \"It's just as
well. The Warden is coming up the steps.\"

\"Did you hear the way he sounded? Again, it was so ... panicky.\"

\"I know how he feels.\" Jared tugged a small pad from the pocket of his riding coat and


thrust it at her. \"This is the full draft of the old man's testament. Read it while we travel.\"

Doors slamming. Voices outside. Her father's. Caspar's.

\"Delete it straight afterward, Claudia. I have a copy.\"

\"We should do something. About the body.\"

\"We weren't there, remember?\"

He barely had the words out before the door opened. Claudia calmly slipped the pad
down her dress.

\"My dear.\" Her father came in and stood before her. She

192
stood up to meet him. He wore his usual black frockcoat, the scarf at his neck silkily
expensive, his boots the finest leather. But today he wore a small white flower in his
buttonhole, as if to mark the occasion, and that was so unlike him she stared at it in
surprise.

\"Are you ready?\" he asked.

She nodded. She was wearing a dark blue traveling dress and cloak, with a special
pocket sewn into it for the Key.

\"A great morning for the House of Arlex, Claudia. The beginning of a new life for you, for
us all.\" His hair with its streak of silver was tied severely back, his eyes dark with
satisfaction. He pulled on his gloves before he took her hand. She looked at him without
smiling, and the old dead man in the straw was in her mind, his eyes open.

She smiled and dropped a curtsy. \"I'm ready, sir.\"

He nodded. \"I always knew you would be. I always knew you'd never let me down.\"

Like my mother did? she wondered acidly. But she said nothing, and her father gave
Jared the briefest nod and led her out. They swept into the great hall, over the lavender-
strewn floor, down between the rows of fascinated servants, the Warden of Incarceron and
his proud daughter, setting out for the marriage that would make her a queen. And on a
signal from Ralph the staff cheered and applauded and threw sweet irises underfoot; they
rang tiny silver bells in honor of the wedding they would never see.


193
Jared walked behind, a satchel of books under one arm. He shook hands with the
servants, and the maids moped over him, pushing tiny packets of sweetmeats at him,
promising to keep the tower safe, not to touch any of his precious instruments, feed the
fox cub and the birds.

As Claudia took her seat in the coach and looked back, she felt a rueful lump in the back
of her throat. They would all miss Jared, his gentle ways, his fragile good looks, his
willingness to dose their coughing children and advise their wayward sons. None of them
seemed at all sorry to see her go.

But then whose fault was that? She had played the game. She was the mistress, the
Warden's daughter.

Cold as ice. Hard as nails.

She raised her head and smiled across at Alys. \"Four days' traveling. I intend to ride for at
least half of it.\"

Her nurse frowned. \"I doubt the Earl will. And he'll probably want you to sit in his coach for
some of the time.\"

\"Well, I'm not married to him yet. When I am, he'll soon find out it's what I want that counts.\"
If they thought her hard, she would be hard. And yet, as the horses were mounted and the
outriders gathered and the coaches began the slow turn to the gatehouse, all she wanted
was to be staying here, in the house where she had lived since she was born, and she
leaned out of the window and waved and called out all their names, her eyes stinging with
sudden tears. \"Ralph! Job! Mary-Ellen!\"

194
And they waved back, a storm of handkerchiefs and the white doves rising from the
gables and the bees in the honey-suckle buzzing as the carriage rumbled over the
wooden drawbridge. In the dark green waters of the moat she saw the house reflected,
saw moorhens and swans arrow over it, and behind her in a great procession the wagons
and coaches and riders and hounds and falconers of her entourage, of the household of
the \"warden of Incarceron, on the day his plans began to come to fruition.

Windblown, she threw herself back in the leather seat and blew hair from her eyes. Well,
maybe.

***


THEY WEREmen and yet how could they be?

They were at least eight feet tall. They walked with an odd angular gait, stalking like
herons, ignoring the vast drifts of sharp leaves, crunching straight through them.

Finn felt Keiro's hand grip so tight on his arm it hurt. Then his brother breathed a single
syllable in his ear.

\"Stilts?

Of course. As one of them paced by he saw them up close, knee-high metallic calipers,
and the men walked on them expertly, taking long strides, and he saw too that they used
the height to touch certain points of the trees, small knots in the trunks, and that the trees
instantly sprouted semi-organic fruits that the men harvested.

195
Turning his head he looked for Gildas, but wherever the Sapient and the girl were hidden,
they were invisible to him.

He watched the line of men work down through the trees. As they moved down the hillside
they seemed to shrink, and Finn distinctly saw the man on the end shimmer, as if he
passed through some disturbance in the air.

After a while only their heads and shoulders showed. Then they were gone.

Keiro waited a long moment before getting up. He gave a soft whistle and a heap of
leaves convulsed nearby. Gildas's silvery head came up. He said, \"Gone?\"

\"Far enough.\"

Keiro watched Attia scramble hurriedly out, then he turned. Taking one look at his
oathbrother he said quietly, \"Finn?\"

It was happening. Looking at the shimmer in the air had done it. Finn's skin crawled with
itches, his mouth was dry, his tongue felt stiff. He rubbed his hand over his mouth. \"No,\"
he mumbled.

\"Get hold of him,\" Gildas snapped.

From somewhere distant Keiro said, \"Wait.\"

And then Finn was walking. Walking straight to the place, the emptiness between two


great boughs of copper where the air had moved as if dust fell through a column of light
there, as if a slot in Time opened there. And when he came to k he stopped, stretching
both arms before himself as if he were blind. It was a keyhole out of the world.

196
Through it, a draft blew.

Small flashes of pain stung him. He struggled through them, feeling, touching the edges,
bringing his face close, putting his eye to the sliver of light, gazing through.

He saw a shimmer of color. It was so bright it made his eyes water, made him gasp.
Shapes moved there, a green world, a sky as blue as in his dreams, a great buzzing
creature of black and amber hurtling toward him.

He cried out and staggered back, felt Keiro grab both arms from behind. \"Keep looking,
brother. What do you see? What is it, Finn?\"

He crumpled. All the strength went from his legs and he collapsed in the leaf-litter. Attia
shoved Keiro away. Quickly she poured water into a cup and held it out to Finn; blindly he
took it and gulped it down, then closed his eyes and put his head in his hands, dizzy and
sick. He retched. Then vomited.

Above him, voices raged. When he could hear, he realized one of them was Attia's,

.. treating him like that! Don't you see he's sick!\"

Keiro's laugh was scornful. \"He'll get over it. He's a seer. He sees things. Things we need
to know.\"

\"Don't you care about him at all?\"

Finn dragged his head up. The girl was facing up to Keiro, her hands gripped into fists at
her sides. Her eyes had lost their bruised look; now they blazed with anger.

197
Keiro kept his mocking grin. \"He's my brother. Of course I care about him.\"

\"Y only care about yourself.\" She turned to Gildas. \"And you too. Master. Y ..
  ou                                                                       ou

She stopped. Gildas obviously wasn't listening. He stood leaning one arm on a metal
tree, staring ahead. \"Come here,\" he said quietly.


Keiro put his hand out and Finn took it, pulling himself groggily to his feet. They crossed to
the Sapient and stood behind him; looking out, they saw what he saw.

The forest ended here. Ahead a narrow road ran down to a City. It stood behind walls in a
fiery landscape of bare plains. Houses clustered together, constructed of patches of
metal, towers and battlements built of strange dark wood, thatched with tin and copper
leaves.

All along the road to it, in long noisy streams of laughter and shouting and song, in crowds
and wagons, carrying children and driving flocks of sheep, hundreds and hundreds of
people were streaming.

***

HER KNEES up on the carriage seat, Claudia read the small pad while Alys slept. The
carriage bounced; outside, the green woods and fields of the Wardenry rattled by in a
cloud of dust and flies.

My name is Gregor Bartlett. This is my testament. I pray those who find it to keep it
safe, and when the time comes, to use it,

198
because a great injustice has been done and only I am alive to know about it.

I worked in the Palace from my early years. I was a stable boy and a postillion, then a
house servant. I became trusted, rose to be important. I was Valet of the Chamber to the
late King, and I remember his first wife, the frail pretty woman from Overseas that he
married when they both were young. When his first son, Giles, was born I was given
charge of him. I arranged the wet nurse, appointed maids of the nursery. He was the Heir;
nothing was spared for his comfort. As the boy grew I came to love him like my own. He
was a happy child. Even when his mother died and the King remarried, he lived in his own
wing of the Palace, surrounded by his precious toys and pets, his own household. I have
no children of my own. The boy became my life. Y must believe that.
                                                 ou

Gradually, I sensed a change. As he grew, his father came to him less and less. There
was a second son now, the Earl Caspar, a squalling noisy baby petted over by the women
of the Court. And there was the new Queen.

Sia is a strange, remote woman. They say the King looked out of his carriage once as he
was being driven along a forest road, and there she stood, at the crossroads. They say
that as he drove past her he saw her eyes--they are strange eyes, with pale irises--and
after that moment he could not stop thinking about her. He sent messengers back, but no


one was there. He had the nearby villages and estates searched, issued proclamations,
offered rewards to his

199
noblemen, but no one could find her. And then, weeks later, as he walked in the gardens
of the Palace, he looked up and she was there, sitting by the fountain.

No one knows her parentage, or where she comes from. I believe her to be a sorceress.
What became clear soon after her son was born was her hatred for Giles. She never
showed it to the King or his Court; to them she was careful to honor the Heir. But I saw it.

He was betrothed at seven years old to the daughter of the Warden of Incarceron. A
haughty little girl, but he seemed to like her...

Claudia smiled. Glancing at Alys she leaned out of the window. Her father's carriage was
behind; he must be sharing it with Evian. She scrolled the text down.

... the happiness of his birthday party, a night when we rowed on the lake under the stars
and he told me how happy he was. I will never forget his words to me.

The death of his father affected him badly. He became solitary. Did not attend the dances
and games. He studied hard. I wonder now if he had begun to fear the Queen. He never
said so. Now I will pass to the end. The day before the riding accident I received a
message that my sister, who lived at Casa, was sick. I asked Giles for leave to go to her;
the dear boy was most concerned, and insisted the kitchens make me up a parcel of
delicacies to take her. He also made sure I had a carriage. He waved me off on the steps
of the Outer Court. That was the last time I ever saw him.

When I arrived, my sister was in excellent health. She had no knowledge of who had sent
the message.

200
My heart misgave me. I thought of the Queen. I wanted to return at once, but the
coachman, who may have been the Queens man, refused, saying the horses were
exhausted. I am no longer a rider, but I saddled a horse from the inn and I rode back,
galloping hard, all through the night. I will not try to write the agonies of worry I felt. I came
over the hill and saw the thousand pinnacles of the Court, and I saw that from every one of
them a black pennant flew.

I remember little after that.

They had laid his body on a bier in the Great Council Chamber, and after it was ready, I


asked leave to approach him. A message came from the Queen, with a man to escort
me. He was the secretary of the Warden, a tall silent man called Medlicote ...

Claudia was so surprised she whistled. Alys snored and turned.

... I climbed the steps like a broken creature. My boy lay there and they had made him
beautiful. I bent to kiss his face with tears blinding my eyes. And then I paused.

Oh, they had made a good job of it. Whoever the boy was he was the right age and
coloring, and the skinwand had been carefully used. But I knew, I knew.

It was not Giles.

I think I laughed. One gasp of joy. I pray no one noticed, that no one knows. I sobbed,
retired, played the heartbroken retainer, the broken old man. And yet I know the secret
that the

201

Queen, and perhaps the Warden, wish no one to know.

That Giles is alive.

And where else can he be but in Incarceron?

Alys grunted and yawned and opened her eyes. \"Are we nearly at the inn yet?\" she asked
sleepily.

Claudia stared at the small pad, eyes wide. She looked up at her nurse as if she'd never
seen her before. Then she glanced down and read the last sentence again.

And again.

202

***

Don't defy me, John. And be on your guard.

There are plots in the Court, and conspiracies against us. As for Claudia, from what you
say she has already seen what she searches for. How amusing that she did not even


recognize it.

--Queen Sia to the Warden; private letter

***

It was hours before she could get Jared alone. There was the fuss of finding their rooms,
the innkeeper bowing and scraping, the supper, endless small talk from Evian, her
father's calm watchfulness, Caspar's complaints about his horse.

But finally, <<well after midnight|13>>, she tapped on the door of his attic and slipped in.

He was sitting at the window looking at the stars, a bird pecking bread from his hands.
She said, \"Don't you ever sleep?\"

Jared smiled. \"Claudia, this is folly. If they catch you here, you know what they'd think.\"

She said, \"I'm bringing you into danger, I know. But we have to talk about what he wrote.\"

He was silent a moment. Then he released the bird, closed the window, and turned, and
she saw the shadows under his eyes. \"Yes.\"

203
They looked at each other. Finally she said, \"They didn't kill Giles. They imprisoned him.\"
\"Claudia...\"

\"They wouldn't spill Havaarna blood! Or perhaps the Queen was afraid to. Or my father ...\"
She looked up. \"It's true. My father must know.\"

The bleakness in her voice shocked them both. She sat on a chair. \"And there's
something else. This boy Finn. The Prisoner. His voice ... seems familiar.\"

\"Familiar?\" He looked sharply at her.

\"I've heard it before, Master.\"

\"Y imagine that. Don't make this assumption, Claudia.\"
  ou

She was still a moment. Then she shrugged. \"In any case we need to try again.\"

Jared nodded. He went over and locked the door, clipped a small device to its back and
adjusted it. Then he turned.


Claudia had the Key ready. She activated the speech channel, and then the small visual
circuit that they had discovered. He stood behind her, watching the hologram of the eagle
flap silent wings.

\"Did you delete the pad?\"

\"Of course. Completely.\"

As the Key began to glow, he said quietly, \"They had no problem spilling the old man's
blood, Claudia. They may already know we searched his house. They must fear what we
found.\"

204

\"By they you mean my father.\" She looked up. \"He won't hurt me. If he loses me, he loses
the throne. And I'll protect you, Master, I swear.\"

His smile was rueful. She knew he didn't believe she could.

Very quietly, the Key spoke. \"Can you hear me?\"

Claudia said, \"It's him! Touch the panel, Finn. Touch it! Have you found it?\"

\"Yes.\" He sounded hesitant. \"What will happen if I do?\"

\"We'll be able to see each other, we think. It won't hurt you. Try k, please.\"

There was a second of dead air, a few crackles. And then Claudia almost jumped back.
Out of the key a beam projected silently. It opened to a square, and crouched in the
square, startled and dirty, was a boy.

He was tall and very thin, his face famished and anxious. His hair was lank and long, tied
back in a knot of string, and his clothes were the drabbest she had ever seen, muddy
grays and greens, badly worn. A sword and a rusty knife were stuck in his belt.

He stared at her in astonishment.

FINN SAW a queen, a princess.

Her face was clean and clear, her hair shone. She wore a dress of some lustrous silk, and
a pearl necklace that would be worth a fortune if a buyer could ever be found rich enough.
He saw at once that she had never been hungry, that her mind was clear


205
and intelligent. Behind her a grave dark-haired man watched, wearing a Sapient's coat
that put Gildas's rag to shame.

Claudia was silent so long, Jared glanced at her. He saw she was stricken, probably by
the boy's condition, so he said softly, \"It seems Incarceron is no paradise then.\"

The boy glared at him. \"Are you mocking me, Master?\"

Jared shook his head sadly. \"No indeed. Tell us how you came to have this artifact.\"

Finn glanced around. The ruin was silent and black; Attia's shadow crouched in the
doorway, watching the darkness outside. She gave him a small nod of reassurance. He
looked back at the holoscreen, afraid that its light would give them away.

As he told them about the eagle on his wrist, he watched Claudia. He was good at
reading faces, but hers was difficult, so controlled, so unrevealing, though the faintest
widening of her eyes told him she was fascinated. Then he slipped into lies, about finding
the Key in a deserted tunnel, obliterating the Maestra, her death, his shame, as if none of
it had ever happened. Attia glanced over, but he kept his face away. He told them about
the Comitatus, about the terrible fight he had fought with Jormanric, how he had defeated
the giant in single combat, stolen three skull-rings from his hands, led his friends out of
that hell. About how they were following a sacred trail out of the Prison.

She listened intently, asking brief questions. He had no idea

206

if she believed any of it. The Sapient was silent , once only raising an eyebrow, when Finn
talked of Gildas.

\"So the Sapienti still survive? But what happened to the Experiment, the social structures,
the food supply? How did it all break down?\"

\"Never mind that,\" Claudia said impatiently. \"Don't you see what the eagle mark means,
Master. Don't you see?\" She leaned forward eagerly. \"Finn. How long have you been in
Incarceron?\"

\"I don't know.\" He scowled. \"I ... only remember ...\"

\"What?\"


\"The last three years. I get... memories, but--\" He stopped. He didn't want to tell her about
the seizures.

She nodded. Her hands were clasped in her lap, he saw. A diamond ring gleamed on one
finger. \"Listen, Finn. Do I look familiar to you? Do you recognize me?\"

His heart leaped. \"No. Should I?\"

She was biting her lip. He felt her tension. \"Finn, listen to me. I think you may be ...\"

\"FINN!\"

Attia's scream was stifled. A hand grabbed her and clamped down on her mouth. \"Too
late,\" Keiro said gleefully.

Out of the darkness Gildas strode in and looked into the holoscreen. For a second he and
Jared shared a startled stare.

Then the screen went blank.

The Sapient breathed a prayer. He turned and looked at

<<207|3:1>>
Finn and the obsession was back in his hard blue eyes. \"I saw! I saw Sapphique!\"

Finn suddenly felt very tired. \"No,\" he said, watching Attia struggle wildly out of Keiro's
grip. \"It wasn't.\"

\"I saw, fool boy! I saw him!\" The old man knelt painfully before the Key. He reached out
and touched it. \"What did he say, Finn? What was his message to us?\"

\"And why didn't you tell us you could see people with it?\" Keiro snapped. \"Don't you trust
us?\"

Finn shrugged. He, not Claudia, had done most of the talking, he realized. But he had to
keep them guessing, so he said, \"Sapphique ... warns us.\"

\"Of what?\" Nursing his bitten hand Keiro gave the girl a sour look. \"Bitch,\" he muttered.

\"Of danger.\"


\"What sort? The whole place is--\"

\"From above.\" Finn muttered it at random. \"Danger from above.\"

Together, they looked up.

Instantly Attia screamed and threw herself aside; Gildas swore. The net collapsed like the
web of an uber-spider, each end weighted; it crashed down on Finn, flattening him under
its impact, a crumpling of dust and screeching bats. For a moment the breath was
knocked right out of him, then he realized Gildas was struggling and tangling next to him,
that the two of them were meshed in heavy ropes sticky with an oozing resin.

208
\"Finn!\" Attia knelt and pulled at the net; her hand stuck and she pulled it hastily away.

Keiro had his sword out; he pushed her aside and slashed at the cables, but they were
threaded with metal and the blade clanged. At the same time a shrill alarm in the ruin
began to whine, a high, wailing note.

\"Don't waste your time,\" Gildas muttered. Then, furiously, \"Get out of here!\"

Keiro stared at Finn. \"I don't leave my brother.\"

Finn struggled to get up but couldn't. For a moment the whole nightmare of being chained
before the trucks of the Civicry crashed back into his mind; then he gasped, \"Do as he
says.\"

\"We can get that thing off you.\" Keiro looked around wildly. \"If we had some sort of pivot.\"

Attia grabbed a metal strut from the wall. It fell to rust in her hands and she flung it down
with a wail.

Keiro hauled at the net. The dark oil blackened his hands and coat; he swore bur kept
pulling, and Finn heaved from below, but after a second they all collapsed, defeated by
the weight.

Keiro crouched at the net. \"I'll find you. I'll rescue you. Give me the Key.\"

\"What?\"

\"Give it to me. Or they'll find it on you and take it.\"


Finn's fingers closed on the warm crystal. For a moment he saw Gildas's startled gaze
through the mesh; the Sapient said, \"Finn, no. We'll never see him again.\"

209

\"Shut your mouth, old man.\" Furious, Keiro turned. \"Give it to me, Finn. Now.\"

Voices outside. The barking of dogs down the track.

Finn wriggled. He squeezed the Key between the oily mesh; Keiro grabbed it and pulled
it out, his fingers smearing oil on the perfect eagle. He shoved it inside his jacket, then
tugged off one of Jormanric's rings and jammed it on Finn's finger. \"One for you. Two for
me.\"

The alarm stopped.

Keiro backed, glancing around, but Attia had already vanished. \"I'll find you, I swear.\"

Finn didn't move. But just as Keiro faded into the night of the Prison, he gripped the
chains and whispered, \"It will only work for me. Sapphique speaks only to me.\"

If Keiro heard him, he didn't know. Because just then the doors crashed in, lights were
beamed in his eyes, the teeth of dogs were snapping and growling at his hands and face.

***

JARED LOOKED at her aghast. \"Claudia, this is madness ...\"

\"It could be him. It could be Giles. Oh yes, he looks different. Thinner. More worn. Older.
But it could easily be him. Right age, right build. Hair.\" She smiled. \"Right eyes.\"

She paced the room, consumed with restlessness. She didn't want to say how the boy's
condition had appalled her. She knew that the failure of the Incarceron Experiment was a
terrible blow, that all the Sapienti would be rocked by it.

210
Crouching suddenly by the dying fire, she said, \"Master, you need to sleep and so do I.
Tomorrow I'll insist you travel with me. We can read Alegon's Histories till Alys falls asleep
and then we can talk. Tonight, I'll just say this. If he isn't Giles, he could be. We could make
a case out that he is. With the old man's testament and the mark on the boy's wrist, there
would be doubt. Enough doubt to stop the marriage.\"


\"His DNA...\"

\"Not Protocol. Y know that.\"
                ou

He shook his head. \"Claudia, I can't believe ... This is impossible ...\"

\"Think about it.\" She got up and crossed to the door. \"Because even if this boy is not
Giles, Giles is in there somewhere. Caspar's not the Heir, Jared. And I intend to prove
that. If it means taking on the Queen and my father, I'll do it.\"

At the door she paused, not wanting to leave him in this pain, wanting to say something
that would ease his distress. \"We have to help him. We have to help all of them in that
hell.\"

He had his back to her, but he nodded. Bleakly he said, \"Go to bed, Claudia.\"

She slipped out into the dim corridor. One candle burned far down in an alcove. As she
walked her dress swished the dry rushes on the floor, and at her door she paused and
looked back.

The inn seemed silent. But outside the door that must be

211
Caspar's, a sudden small movement made her stare, and she bit her lip in dismay.

The big man, Fax, was lying there across two chairs.

He was looking straight at her. Ironically, with a leer that chilled her, he waved the tankard
in his hand.

212

In ancient statutes Justice was always blind. But what if it sees, sees everything, and its
Eye is cold and without Mercy? Who would be safe from such a gaze?

Year by year Incarceron tightened its grip. It made a hell of what should have been
Heaven.


The Gate is locked; those Outside cannot hear our cries. So, in secret, I began to
fashion a key.

--Lord Calliston's Diary

***

As he passed under the gate of the City, Finn saw it had teeth.

It was designed like a mouth, gaping wide, fanged with metal incisors that looked razor-
sharp. He guessed there was some mechanism that closed it in emergencies, creating
an impassible interlocking bite.

He glanced at Gildas, leaning wearily on the wagon. The old man was bruised and his lip
swollen from the blow they had given him. Finn said, \"There must be some of your people
here.\"

The Sapient scratched his face with his tied hands and said dryly, \"If so, they don't
command much respect.\"

Finn frowned. This was all Keiro's fault. The first thing the

213
Crane-men had done after dragging them out of the trap had been to search Gildas's
pack. They had tipped out the powders and ointments, the carefully wrapped quills, the
book of the Songs of Sapphique he always carried. None of those mattered. But when
they had found the packets of meat, they had looked at one another. One of them, a thin
scrawny man, had turned on his stilts and snapped, \"So you're the thieves.\"

\"Listen, friend,\" Gildas had said darkly, \"we had no idea the sheep was yours. Everyone
has to eat. I'll pay you, with my learning. I am a Sapient of some skill.\"

\"Oh, you'll pay, old man.\" The man's stare had been level. He had looked at his
comrades; they had seemed amused. \"With your hands, I would think, when the Justices
see this.\"

Finn had been tied up, so tightly, the cords burned his skin. Dragged outside, he had
seen a small cart harnessed to a donkey; the Crane-men leaped up onto it, sliding
expertly out of the strange metal calipers.

Roped behind, Finn had stumbled beside the old man along the road that led to the City.
Twice he had glanced back, hoping to see Keiro or perhaps Attia, just a glimpse, a brief


wave, but the forest was far away now, a distant glimmering of impossible colors, and the
road ran straight as an arrow down the long metallic slope, the ground on each side
studded with spikes and jagged with chasms.

Amazed at such defenses, he muttered, \"What are they so scared of?\"

214
Gildas scowled. \"Attack, clearly. They're anxious to be in before Lightsout.\"

More than anxious. Almost all of the great crowds they had seen earlier were already
inside the wall; as they hurried to the gate, a horn rang out in the citadel, and the Crane-
men had urged the donkey on fiercely, so that Gildas was breathless with the pace, and
almost fell.

Now, safe inside, Finn heard the clang of a portcullis and the rattle of chains. Had Keiro
and Attia gotten here too? Or were they out there in the wood? He knew the Crane-men
would have found the Key if he'd kept it, but the thought of Keiro having it, perhaps
speaking to Claudia with it, made him nervous. And there was another thought that
nagged at him, but he would not think of that. Not yet.

\"Come on.\" The leader of the foraging party pulled him upright. \"We have to do this
tonight. Before the Festival.\"

As he trudged through the streets, Finn thought he had never seen such a hive of people.
The lanes and alleyways were festooned with small lanterns; when the Prison lights went
off the world was transformed instantly into a network of tiny twinkling silver sparks,
beautiful and brilliant. There were thousands of inmates, setting up tents, bargaining in
vast bazaars, searching for shelter, herding sheep and cyber-horses into corrals and
market squares. He saw beggars without hands, blinded, missing lips and ears. He saw
disfiguring diseases that made him gasp and turn away. And yet no

215
half-men. Here too it seemed, that abomination was restricted to animals.

The noise of clattering hooves was deafening; the stink of dung and sweat, of crushed
straw and the sudden, vivid sweetness of sandalwood, of lemons. Dogs ran everywhere,
tugging over food sacks, rummaging in drains, and slyly behind them the small copper-
scaled rats that bred so fast slunk into cracks and doorways, their tiny eyes red.

And he saw that images of Sapphique were on every corner, mounted above doorways
and windows, a Sapphique who held out his right hand to show the missing finger, who
held in the left what Finn recognized, with a silent leap of his heart, as a crystal Key.


\"Do you see that?\"

\"I see it.\" Gildas sat breathlessly on a step while one of their captors moved into the
crowd. \"This is obviously some sort of festival. Perhaps in Sapphique's honor.\"

\"These Justices ...\"

\"Leave the talking to me.\" Gildas straightened, tried to adjust his robe. \"Don't say a word.
Once they know what I am, we'll be released and this whole mess will be sorted. A
Sapient will be listened to.\"

Finn scowled. \"I hope so.\"

\"What else did you see, back there in the ruin? What else did Sapphique say?\"

\"Nothing.\" He had run out of lies, and his arms ached from

216
being tied in front of him. Fear was threading into his mind like a cold trickle.

\"Not that we'll see the Key again,\" Gildas said bitterly. \"Or that liar Keiro.\"

\"I trust him,\" Finn said between gritted teeth.

\"More fool you.\"

The men came back. They tugged their prisoners to one side, pushed them through an
archway in a wall and up a broad dim staircase that curved to the left. At the top a great
wooden door confronted them; by the light of the two lanterns that guarded it, Finn saw
that an enormous eye had been carved deep in the black wood; the eye stared out at him
and he thought for a moment that it was alive, that it watched him, that it was the Eye of
Incarceron that had studied him curiously all his life.

Then the Crane-man rapped on the wood and the door opened. Finn and Gildas were led
inside, a man on each side of them.

The room, if it was a room, was pitch-black.

Finn stopped instantly. He breathed hard, hearing echoes, a strange rustle. His senses
warned him of a great emptiness, before him, or perhaps to the side; he was terrified of
taking another step in case he plummeted into some unknown depths. A faint memory


stirred in his mind, a whisper of someplace without light, without air. He pulled himself
upright. He had to keep alert.

217
The men stepped away, and he felt isolated, seeing nothing, touching no one.

Then, not very far in front of him, a voice spoke.

\"We are all criminals here. Is that not so?\"

It was a low, quiet question, modulated. He had no idea if the speaker was male or
female.

Gildas said immediately, \"Not so. I am not a criminal, nor were my forebears. I am Gildas
Sapiens, son of Amos, son of Gildas, who entered Incarceron on the Day of Closure.\"

Silence. Then, \"I did not think any of you were left.\" The same voice. Or was it? It came
from slightly to the left now; Finn stared in that direction, but saw nothing.

\"Neither I nor the boy have stolen from you,\" Gildas snapped. \"Another of our companions
killed the animal. It was a mistake but--\"

\"Be silent.\"

Finn gasped. The third voice, identical to the first two, came from the right. There must be
three of them.

Gildas drew in a breath of annoyance. His very silence was angry.

The central voice said heavily, \"We are all criminals here. We are all guilty. Even
Sapphique, who Escaped, had to pay the debt to Incarceron. Y too will pay the debt in
                                                            ou
your flesh and with your blood. Both of you.\"

Perhaps the light was growing, or perhaps Finn's eyes were adjusting. Because now he
could make them out; three

218
shadows seated before him, dressed in robes of black that covered their whole bodies,
wearing strange headdresses of black that he realized all at once were wigs. Wigs of
raven-dark, straight hair. The effect was grotesque because the speakers were ancient.
He had never seen women so old.


Their skin was leathery with wrinkles, their eyes milky white. Each of them had her head
lowered; as his foot scraped uneasily he saw how their faces turned to follow the sound,
and he realized they were blind.

\"Please ...\" he muttered.

\"There is no appeal. That is the sentence.\"

He glanced at Gildas. The Sapient was staring at some objects at the women's feet. On
the steps in front of the first lay a rough wooden spindle, and from it a thread spilled, a fine
silvery weave. It coiled and tangled around the feet of the second woman, as if she never
moved from the stool where she sat, and hidden in its skein was a measuring stick. The
thread, dirty by now and frayed, ran under the chair of the third, to where a sharp pair of
shears leaned.

Gildas looked stricken. \"I have heard of you,\" he whispered.

\"Then you will know we are the Three Without Mercy, the Implacable Ones. Our justice is
blind and deals only in facts. Y have stolen from these men, the evidence is presented.\"
                                ou
The middle crone tipped her head. \"Y agree, my sisters?\"
                                    ou

One each side, identical voices whispered, \"We agree.\"

219
\"Then let the punishment for thieves be carried out.\"

The men came forward, grabbed Gildas, and forced him to his knees. In the dimness
Finn saw the outline of a wooden block; the old man's arms were pulled down and held
across it at the wrist. \"No!\" he gasped. \"Listen to me ...\"

\"It wasn't us!\" Finn tried to struggle. \"This is wrong!\"

The three identical faces seemed deaf as well as blind. The central one raised a thin
finger; a knife blade glimmered in the darkness.

\"I am a Sapient of the Academy.\" Gildas's voice was raw and terrified. Drops of sweat
stood out on his forehead. \"I will not be treated like a thief. Y have no right...\"
                                                                 ou

He was held in a rigid grip; one man at his back, another grasping his tied wrists. The
knife blade was lifted. \"Shut up, old fool,\" one of them muttered.

\"We can pay. We have money. I can cure illnesses. The boy ... the boy is a seer. He


speaks to Sapphique. He has seen the stars!\"

It came out like a cry of desperation. At once the man with the knife paused; his gaze
flashed to the crones.

Together they said, \"The stars?\" The words were an overlapping murmur, a wondering
whisper. Gildas, gasping for breath, saw his chance. \"The stars, Wise Women. The lights
Sapphique speaks of. Ask him! He's a cell-born, a son of Incarceron.\"

They were silent now. Their blind faces turned toward Finn; the central one held out her
hand, beckoning, and the

220
Crane-man shoved him forward so that she touched his arm and grabbed it. Finn kept
very still. The old woman's hands were bony and dried the fingernails long and broken.
She groped down his arms, over his chest, reached up to his face. He wanted to break
away, to shudder, but he kept still, enduring the cool, rough fingers on his forehead, over
his eyes.

The other women faced him, as if one felt for them all. Then, both hands pressed against
his chest, the central Justice murmured, \"I feel his heart. It beats boldly, flesh of the Prison,
bone of the Prison. I feel the emptiness in him, the torn skies of the mind.\"

\"We feel the sorrow.\"

\"We feel the loss.\"

\"He serves me.\" Gildas heaved himself up and stood hastily. \"Only me. But I give him to
you, sisters, I offer him to you in reparation for our crime. A fair exchange.\"

Finn glared at him, astonished. \"No! Y can't do that!\"
                                      ou

Gildas turned. He was a small shrunken shape in the darkness, but his eyes were hard
and crafty with sudden inspiration, his breathing ragged. He looked meaningfully at the
ring on Finn's finger. \"I have no choice.\"

The three crones turned to one another. They did not speak, bur some knowledge
seemed to pass between them. One cackled a sudden laugh that made Finn sweat and
the man behind him mutter with terror.

\"Shall we?\"


221
\"Should we?\"

\"Could we?\"

\"We accept.\" They spoke it in unison. Then the crone on the left bent and picked up the
spindle. Her cracked fingers spun it; she took the thread and pulled it out between finger
and thumb. \"He will be the One. He will be the Tribute.\"

Finn swallowed. He felt weak, his back sheened with cold sweat. \"What tribute?\"

The second sister measured the thread, a short span. The third crone took the shears.
Carefully she cut the thread and it fell silently in the dust.

\"The Tribute we owe,\" she whispered, \"to the Beast.\"

***

KEIRO AND Attia reached the City just before Lightsout, the last league on the back of a
wagon whose driver never even noticed them. Outside the gate they jumped off.

\"Now what?\" she whispered.

\"We go straight in. Everyone else is.\"

He strode off and she glared at his back, then ran after him.

There was a smaller gate, and to the left a narrow slit in the wall. She wondered what it
was for, then she saw that the guards were making everyone walk through it.

She looked back. The road was empty. Far out in the silent plain the defenses waited;
high above, what might have been a bird circled like a silver spark in the dim mists.

222
Keiro pushed her forward. \"Y first.\"
                            ou

As they walked up, the guard ran a practiced eye over them, then jerked his head toward
the slit. Attia walked through. It was a dim, smelly passageway, and she emerged in the
cobbled street of the City.

Keiro took one step after her.


Instantly, an alarm rang. Keiro turned. A soft, urgent bleep in the wall. Just above,
Incarceron opened an Eye and stared.

The guard, who had been closing the gate, stopped. He spun around, drawing his sword.
\"Well, you don't look like ...\"

With one blow to the stomach Keiro doubled him up; another sent him crashing against
the wall. He lay crumpled. Keiro took a breath, then crossed to the panel and flicked the
alarm off. When he turned Attia was staring at him. \"Why you? Why not me?\"

\"Who cares?\" He strode quickly past her. \"It probably sensed the Key.\"

She stared at his back, at the rich jerkin and the mane of hair he pushed so carelessly
back. Quietly, so he couldn't hear her, she said, \"So why are you so scared?\"

***

WHEN THE carriage dipped as he climbed in, Claudia sighed with relief. \"I thought you'd
never come.\"

She turned from the window and the words died in her mouth.

\"I'm touched,\" her father said dryly.

223
He pulled off one glove and flicked dust from the seat. Then he laid his stick and a book
beside him, and called, \"Drive on.

The carriage creaked as the horses were whipped up. In a moment of jangling harness
and the swaying turn in the inn-yard Claudia tried to stop herself falling into his trap. But
the anxiety was too much. \"Where's Jared? I thought...\"

\"I asked him to travel with Alys in the third coach this morning. I felt we should talk.\"

It was an insult, of course, though Jared wouldn't care and Alys would be thrilled to have
him to herself. But to treat a Sapient like a servant... She was rigid with fury.

Her father watched her a moment, then gazed out of the window, and she saw that he had
allowed a little more gray into his beard, so that his look of grave distinction was stronger
than ever.


He said, \"Claudia, a few days ago you asked me about your mother.\"

If he had struck her, she couldn't have been more astonished. Then, instantly, she was on
the alert. It was just like him to take the initiative, to turn the game around, to attack. He
was a master chess player at the Court. She was a pawn on his board, a pawn he would
make a queen, despite everything.

Outside, a soft summer rain was drenching the fields. It smelled sweet and fresh. She
said, \"Y I did.\"
        es

He gazed out at the countryside, his fingers playing with

224
the black gloves. \"It is very hard for me to speak about her, but today, on this journey
toward everything I have always worked for, perhaps the time has come.\" Claudia bit her
lip.

All she felt was fear. And for a moment, just a fragment of time, something she had never
felt before. She felt sorry for him.

225

***

\"I married in middle age.\" John Arlex watched the heavy foliage of summer shadow the
interior of the coach with glints of sunlight. \"I was a wealthy man--our family has always
been part of the Court--and the post of Warden had been mine from youth. A great
responsibility, Claudia. Y have no idea how great.\"
                          ou


He sighed briefly.

The coach jolted over stones. In the pocket of her traveling coat, she felt the crystal Key
tap against her knee, remembered Finns fear, his starved face. Were they all like that, the
Prisoners her father watched over?

\"Helena was a beautiful and elegant woman. Ours was not an arranged marriage, but a
chance meeting at a winter ball at the Court. She was a Lady of the Chamber to the last
Queen, Giles's mother, an orphan, the last of her line.\"

226
He paused, as if he wanted her to say something, but she didn't. She felt that if she spoke
it would break the spell, that he might stop. He didn't look at her. Softly he said, \"I was very
much in love with her.\"

Her hands were clenched together. She made them relax.

\"After a short courtship we were married at Court. A quiet wedding, not like yours will be,
but there was a discreet banquet later, and Helena sat at the head of my table and
laughed. She looked very much like you, Claudia, if a little shorter. Her hair was fair and
smooth. She always wore a black velvet ribbon around her neck, with a portrait of us both
inside it.\"

He smoothed his knee absently.

\"When she told me she was pregnant I was more happy than I can say. Perhaps I had
thought the time was gone, that I would never have an heir. That the care of Incarceron
would pass from the family, that the line of the Arlexi would die out with me. In any case, I
took even greater care of her. She was strong, but the constraints of Protocol had to be
observed.\"

He looked up. \"We had so little time together.\"

Claudia took a breath. \"She died.\"

\"When the child was born.\" He looked away, out of the window. Leaf shadows flashed
over his face. \"We had a midwife and one of the most renowned of the Sapienti in
attendance, but nothing could be done.\"

She had no idea what to say. Nothing had prepared her for this. He had never talked to
her like this before. Her fingers


227
were knotted back together. She said, \"I never saw her then.\"

\"Never.\" His dark glance turned to her. \"And afterward I could not bear to see her image.
There was a portrait, but I had it locked away. Now there is only this.\"

He drew from inside his shirt a small gold locket, tugged the black ribbon over his head
and held it out. For a moment she was almost afraid to take it; when she did, it was warm
from his body heat.

\"Open it,\" he said.

She undid the fastening. Inside, facing each other in two oval frames were two miniatures,
exquisitely painted. On the right, her father, looking grave and younger, his hair a rich
brown. And opposite, in a low-cut gown of crimson silk, a woman with a sweet, delicate
face, smiling, a tiny flower held to her mouth.

Her mother.

Her fingers trembled; glancing up to see if he noticed, she saw he was watching her. He
said, \"I will have a copy made for you at Court. Master Alan the painter is a fine
workman.\"

She wanted him to break down, to cry out. She wanted him to be angry, to be scorched
with grief, something, anything she could respond to. But there was only his grave calm.

She knew he had won this round of the game. Silently she gave the medallion back.

He slid it into his pocket.

Neither of them spoke for a while. The coach rumbled along

228
the high road; they passed through a village of tumbledown cottages and a pond where
geese rose up and flapped white wings in fright. Then the road ran uphill, into the green
shade of a wood.

Claudia felt hot and embarrassed. A wasp blundered through the open window; she
waved it out and wiped her hands and face with a small handkerchief noticing how the
brown dust of the road came off on the white linen.


Finally she said, \"Fm glad you've told me. Why now?\"

\"I am not a demonstrative man, Claudia. But only now am I ready to speak of it.\" His voice
was gravelly and hoarse. \"This wedding will be the pinnacle of my life. Of hers too, had
she lived. We must think of her, of how proud and happy she would have felt.\" He raised
his eyes and they were gray as steel. \"Nothing must be allowed to spoil things, Claudia.
Nothing must get in the way of our success.\"

She met his eyes; he smiled his slow smile. \"Now. I am sure you would prefer Jared's
company to mine.\" There was an edge to the words that she did not miss. He picked up
his stick and thumped on the carriage roof; outside, the coachman gave a low call,
drawing the horses to a restless, stamping, snorting halt. When they were still, the Warden
leaned over and opened the door. He climbed down and stretched. \"What a beautiful
view. Look, my dear.\"

She stepped out beside him.

A great river ran below them, glinting in the summer

229
sunshine. It ran through rich farmlands, the fields golden with the ripening barley, and she
saw that butterflies were rising in clouds from the flowery meadows beside the road. The
sun was hot on her arms; she raised her face to it gratefully, closing her eyes and seeing
only a red heat, smelling the dust and some pungent crushed yarrow in the hedge.

When she opened them again he was gone, walking back to the following coaches,
swishing his stick, speaking a pleasant word to Lord Evian, who climbed out and
mopped perspiration from his red face.

And the Realm stretched before her to the distant misty heat of the horizon, and she
wished for a second that she could run into its summer stillness, escape into the peace of
the empty land. Somewhere no one else would be.

Somewhere she would be free.

A movement at her elbow. Lord Evian stood there, sipping from a small wine flask.
\"Beautiful,\" he breathed. He pointed a plump finger. \"Do you see?\"

She saw a glitter miles away in the distant hills. A brilliant diamond-white reflection. And
she knew it was the sunlight on the roof of the great Glass Court.

***


KEIRO ATE the last scrap of meat and leaned back, replete. He drank the dregs of beer
and looked around for someone to refill the tankard.


Attia was still sitting by the door; he ignored her. The tavern

230
was full; he had to call twice to get attention. Then the alewife came over with a jug and as
she filled said, \"What about your friend? Doesn't she eat?\"

\"She's no friend of mine.\"

\"She came in behind you.\"

He shrugged. \"Can't help being followed by girls. I mean, look at me.\"

The woman laughed and shook her head. \"All right, handsome. Pay up.\"

He counted out a few coins, drank the beer, and stood, stretching. He felt better after the
wash, and the flame-red jerkin had always looked good on him. Striding between the
tables he ignored Attia as she scrambled up to follow and was halfway down the dim
alleyway before her voice made him stop.

\"When are we going to find them?\"

He didn't turn.

\"God knows what's happening to them. Y promised ...\"
                                      ou

Keiro swung around. \"Why don't you get lost?\"

The girl stared back. She was a timid little thing, he'd thought, but this was the second
time she'd confronted him, and it was getting annoying. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" she
said quietly.

Keiro grinned. \"Y think I'm going to desert them, don't your
                 ou

\"Yes.\"

Her directness threw him. It made him angry. He turned

231
and walked on, but she came after him like a shadow. Like a dog.

\"I think you want to, but I won't let you. I won't let you take the Key.\"


He told himself he wouldn't answer her, but the words came out anyway. \"Y have no
                                                                          ou
idea what I'll do. Finn and I are oathbrothers. That means everything. And I keep my
word.\"

\"Do you?\" Her voice slid into a sly copy of Jormanric's. \" I haven't kept my word since I
was ten and knifed my own brother. Is that how it works, Keiro? Is that how the Comitatus
is still with us, inside you?\"

He turned on her then, but she was ready for him. She leaped, scratching his face, kicking
and pushing him so that he staggered and crashed back against the wall. The Key fell
out, a clatter on the filthy cobbles; they both grabbed for it, but she was quicker.

Keiro hissed with anger. He caught her hair, dragged it back savagely. \"Give it to me!\"

She screamed and squirmed.

\"Let go of it!\"

He pulled harder. With a howl of pain Attia threw the Key into the darkness; instantly Keiro
let her go and scrambled after it, but as soon as he picked it up, he dropped it with a yell.

It lay on the ground, small blue lights traveling inside it.

Suddenly, with alarming silence, an image field sprang up around it. They saw a girl
dressed in a sumptuous dress, her

232
back against a tree, lit by a glorious brilliance of light. She stared at them both. When she
spoke, her voice was sharp with suspicion.

\"Where's Finn? Who the hell are you?\"

***

THEY HAD given him a meal of honeycakes and some strange seeds and a hot drink
that bubbled slightly, but he had been afraid to taste it in case it was drugged. Whatever
he was going into, he wanted a clear head.

They had also given him clean clothes and water to wash in. Outside the door of the room
two of the Crane-men stood, leaning against the wall.


He crossed to the window. There was a long drop. Below was a narrow street, crowded
with people even now, begging and selling and setting up makeshift camps in the street,
sleeping under sacks, their animals wandering everywhere. The noise was appalling.

He put his hands on the sill and leaned out, looking up at the roofs. They were mostly
straw, with some metal patched here and there. There was no way he could climb out on
them; the house leaned outward as if it would fall, and he certainly would. For a moment
he wondered if it might not be better to break his neck here than have to face some
nameless creature, but there was still time. Things might change.

He ducked inside and sat on the stool trying to think. Where

233
was Keiro? What was he doing? What plan did he have? Keiro was willful and wild, but
he was a great plotter. The ambush of the Civicry had been his idea. He was bound to
think of something good. Already Finn missed his brashness, his utter self-certainty.

The door opened; Gildas squeezed in.

\"You!\" Finn jumped up. \"You've got a nerve ...\"

The Sapient held up both hands. \"You're angry. Finn, I had no choice. Y saw what would
                                                                       ou
have happened to us.\" He sounded grim, went and sat heavily on the stool. \"Besides, Fm
coming with you.\"

\"They said only me.\"

\"Silver coins do much.\" He grunted tetchily. \"Most people try to bribe their way out of
being taken to the Cave, it seems, not in.\"

There was only one seat in the room; Finn sat on the floor among the straw and wrapped
his arms around his knees. \"I thought I was on my own,\" he said softly.

\"Well, you're not. I am not Keiro, and I will not desert my seer.\"

Finn scowled. Then he said, \"Would you desert me if I saw nothing?\"

Gildas rubbed his dry hands together, making a papery sound. \"Of course not.\"

They were silent a moment, listening to the babble of the street. Then Finn said, \"Tell me
about the Cave.\"


234
\"I thought you knew the story. Sapphique came to the Citadel of the Justices, which must
be where we are. He learned that the people here pay a Tribute every month to a being
they only know as the Beast--the tribute is a young man or woman of the town. They go
into a cave on the mountainside; none ever return.\"

He scratched his beard. \"Sapphique came before the Justices and offered himself in
place of the girl whose life was due. They say she wept at his feet. As he went out all the
people of the town watched him go, in silence. He entered the Cave alone, without
weapons.\"

Finn said, \"And?\"

Gildas was silent a moment. When he went on, his voice was lower. \"For three days
nothing happened. Then, on the fourth, news went around like wildfire that the stranger
had emerged from the Cave. The townspeople lined the walls, threw open the gates.
Sapphique walked slowly up the road. When he reached the gates he lifted up his hand,
and they saw that the index finger on the right was missing, and that the hand bled into the
dust. He said, 'The debt has not been paid. There is not enough of me to pay the debt.
What lives in the Cave is a hunger that can never be satisfied. An emptiness that can
never be filled.' Then he turned and walked away and the people let him go. But the girl,
the one whose life he saved, she ran after him, and traveled with him for a while. She was
the first of his Followers.\"

235
Finn said, \"What--?\" but the door slammed open before he could finish. The Crane-men
beckoned. \"Out. The boy must sleep now. At Lightson we leave.\"

Gildas went, with one swift look. The man threw Finn some blankets; he dragged them
around himself and sat huddled against the wall, listening to the voices and singing and
barking in the street.

He felt cold and utterly alone. He tried to think of Keiro, of Claudia, the girl the Key had
shown him. And Attia, would she forget him? Would they all leave him to his fate?

He rolled over and curled up.

And then he saw the Eye.

It was very tiny, up near the ceiling, half hidden in cobwebs.

It watched him steadily and he stared back, then sat up and faced it. \"Speak to me,\" he


said, his voice soft with anger and scorn. \"Are you too scared to speak to me? If I was
born from you, then talk to me. Tell me what to do. Spring the doors open.\"

The Eye was a red spark, unblinking.

\"I know you're there. I know you can hear me. I've always known. The others forget, but I
don't.\" He was standing now; he came over and reached up, but the Eye was, as always,
too high. \"I told her about you, the Maestra, the woman that was killed, that I killed. Did you
see that? Did you see her fall, did you catch her? Have you got her somewhere, alive?\"

236
His voice was shaking, his mouth was dry; he knew the signs but was too angry and
scared to stop.

\"I will Escape from you. I will, I swear it. There must be somewhere to go. Where you can't
see me. Where you don't exist!

He was sweating, sick. He had to sit down, lie down, let the dizziness sweep over him,
the patchwork of images, a room, a table, a boat on a dark lake. He choked on them,
fought them off, drowned in them. \"No,\" he said. \"No.\" The Eye was a star. A red star. It fell
slowly into his open mouth. And as it burned inside him, he heard it speak in the faintest
of breaths, the murmur of dust in deserted corridors, the scorch of ashes in the heart of
the fire.

\"I am everywhere\" it whispered. \"Everywhere.\"

Claudia stared at the holo-image in dismay. \"What do you mean imprisoned? Y   ou're all in
Prison, aren't you?\" The boy grinned, a soft mockery she already disliked. He sat on the
curb of what looked like some sort of dark alleyway and leaned back, gazing at her with a
considering scrutiny. \"Are we, indeed? And where are you then, Princess?\"

She frowned. In fact she had run into the garderobe of the hostelry where the carriages
had stopped for lunch, a stinking stone chamber too close to Protocol for comfort. But she
wasn't going to waste time explaining. \"Listen to me, whatever your name is--\"

\"Keiro.\"

\"Well, Keiro. It's vital I speak to Finn. How did you get this Key from him anyway? Did you
steal it?\"

He had very blue eyes, and his hair was blond and long. He was handsome and he
certainly knew it. He said, \"Finn and

238
I are oathbrothers, sworn to each other. He gave it to me for safety.\"

\"So he trusts you?\"

\"Of course.\"

Another voice said, \"Well, I don't.\"

A girl stepped up behind him; he glared at her hotly and muttered, \"Will you shut up?\" but
she crouched and spoke hurriedly to Claudia.

\"I'm Attia. I think he's going to leave Finn and the Sapient and try to Escape as Sapphique
did, and he thinks the Key will work for him. Y musn't let him! Finn will die.\"
                                                ou

Bewildered by the names, Claudia said, \"Wait. Slow down! Why will he die?\"

\"They seem to have some sort of ritual in this Wing. He has to face the Beast. Is there
anything you can do? Some magic from the stars? Y have to help us!\"
                                                  ou

The girl had the filthiest clothes Claudia had ever seen; her hair was dark and hacked into
a rough, jagged cut. She was clearly worried sick. Trying to think, Claudia said, \"How can
I do anything? Y have to get him out of it!\"
                ou


\"What makes you think we can?\" Keiro asked calmly.

\"You've got no choice.\" A shout out in the inn-yard made her glance around nervously.
\"Because Finn is the only one I'll talk to.\"

\"Like him, do you? And who are you anyway?\"

She glared. \"The Warden of Incarceron is my father.\"

239
Keiro snorted. \"What Warden?\"

\"He ... oversees the Prison.\" She felt cold. His scorn chilled her. Quickly she went on.
\"Maybe I can find charts of the Prison, a map of its secret ways, its doorways and
corridors that will show you the way out. But I won't tell you a thing until I see Finn.\"

It was a lie that would have made Jared groan, but she had no choice. She didn't trust this
Keiro; he was too arrogant, and the girl seemed angry and scared.

Keiro shrugged. \"What's so special about Finn?\"

She hesitated. Then she said, \"I think ... I think I recognize him. He's older, he looks
different, but there's something about him, his voice ... If I'm right his real name is Giles,
and he's the son of... a fairly important person out here.\" She shouldn't say too much. Just
enough to get him to act.

Keiro stared, astonished. \"Are you telling me all that guff about coming in from Outside is
actually true? That mark on his wrist means something?\"

\"I've got to go. Just get him.\"

He folded his arms. \"If I can't?\"

\"Then forget the magic of the stars.\" She looked at the girl, their eyes meeting briefly.
\"And this Key will just be a useless lump of crystal. But if you're his brother, you'd want to
rescue him.\"

Keiro nodded. \"I do.\" He nodded toward Attia. \"Forget her. She's crazy. She knows
nothing.\" His voice was low and

240


earnest. \"Finn and I are brothers and we watch each other's backs. Always.\"

Attia gazed at Claudia, her face bruised. Doubt moved in her eyes. \"Is he related to you?\"
she asked quietly. \"Y brother? Cousin?\"
                     our

Claudia shrugged. \"Just a friend. A friend, that's all.\" Hurriedly, she switched the field off.

The Key glimmered in the fetid darkness. She shoved it into the pocket in her skirt and
ran out, desperate for fresh air. Alys was loitering anxiously in the passageway, servants
bustling past her with trays and dishes.

\"Oh, there you are, Claudia! Earl Caspar is looking for you.\"

But Claudia could already hear him, the thin annoying bray of his voice, and to her dismay
she saw that it was Jared he was talking to, and Lord Evian, the three of them sitting on
benches in the sunshine, the hostel dogs sprawled in an expectant row at their feet.

She came out and crossed the cobbles.

Evian stood immediately and made an ornate bow; Jared moved quietly to make a space
for her. Caspar said crossly, \"You're always avoiding me, Claudia!\"

\"Of course not. Why on earth would I do that?\" She sat down and smiled. \"How nice. All
my friends together.\"

Caspar scowled. Jared shook his head slightly. Beside them Evian hid a smile with his
lace-edged handkerchief. She wondered how he could sit there so coolly with the Earl, a
boy he

241
was plotting to have murdered. But then, he would probably protest that it wasn't personal,
that this was politics, nothing more. The game, always.

She turned to Jared. \"I want you to travel with me now. I'm so bored! We can discuss
Menessier's Natural History of the Realm?

\"Why not me?\" Caspar tossed a hunk of meat to the dogs and watched them fight over it.
\"I'm not boring.\" His small eyes turned to her. \"Am I?\"

It was a challenge. \"Indeed not, Y Grace.\" She smiled pleasantly. \"And of course I'd
                                  our
love you to join us. Menessier has some excellent passages on the fauna in the
coniferous forests.\"


He stared at her in disgust. \"Claudia, don't try that wide-eyed innocent junk with me. I told
you, I don't care what you get up to. Anyway, I know all about it. Fax told me about last
night.\"

She felt herself go pale, couldn't look at Jared. The dogs growled and fought. One
brushed her skirt and she stamped at it.

Caspar stood up, smugly triumphant. He was wearing a garish collar of gold links and a
frock coat of black velvet, and he kicked the dogs aside till they yelped. \"But I'm warning
you, Claudia, you'd better be more discreet. My mothers not as open-minded as I am. If
she found out, she'd be furious.\" He grinned at Jared. \"Y clever tutor might find that his
                                                         our
illness gets suddenly worse.\"

242
She was so angry, she almost leaped to her feet, but Jared's light touch kept her sitting.
They watched Caspar stride away across the inn-yard, avoiding the puddles and dung
heaps in his expensive boots.

Finally Lord Evian took out his snuffbox. \"Dear me,\" he said quietly. \"Now that was a
threat if ever I heard one.\"

Claudia met Jared's eyes. They were dark and troubled. \"Fax?\" he said.

She shrugged, exasperated with herself. \"He saw me coming out of your room last night.\"

His dismay showed. \"Claudia ...\"

\"I know. I know. It's all my fault.\"

Evian sniffed the snuff delicately. \"If I may be allowed to comment, that was a very
unfortunate thing to happen.\"

\"It's not what you think.\" I'm sure.

\"No. Really. And you can drop the act. I've told Jared about... the Steel Wolves.\"

He glanced around quickly. \"Claudia, not aloud, please.\" His voice lost its affectations. \"I
appreciate you trust your tutor, but--\"

\"Of course she should have told me.\" Jared tapped the table-top with his long fingers.
\"Because the whole plot is foolish, utterly criminal, and almost certain to be betrayed.


How could you even think about bringing her into it!\"

\"Because we can't do it without her.\" The fat man was

243
calm, but a film of sweat glistened on his forehead. \"Y above all, Master Sapient,
                                                           ou
understand what the iron decrees of the Havaarna have done to us. We are rich, some of
us, and live well, but we are not free. We are chained hand and foot by Protocol, enslaved
to a static, empty world where men and women can't read, where the scientific advances
of the ages are the preserve of the rich, where artists and poets are doomed to endless
repetitions and sterile reworkings of past masterpieces. Nothing is new. New does not
exist. Nothing changes, nothing grows, evolves, develops. Time has stopped. Progress is
forbidden.\"

He leaned forward. Claudia had never seen him so grave, so stripped of his effete
disguise, and it chilled her, as if he were someone else entirely, an older, exhausted,
desperate man.

\"We are dying, Claudia. We must break open this cell we have bricked ourselves into,
escape from this endless wheel we tread like rats. I have dedicated myself to freeing us. If
it means my death, I don't care, because even death will be a sort of freedom.\"

In the stillness the rooks cawed around the trees overhead. Horses in the stable yard
were being harnessed, their feet stamping the cobbles.

Claudia licked dry lips. \"Don't do anything yet,\" she whispered. \"I may have ... some
information for you. But not yet.\" She stood quickly, not wanting to say any more, not
wanting to feel the raw anguish he had opened in her like a stab wound.

\"The horses are ready. Let's go.\"

244
***

THE STREETS were full of people, all silent. Their silence terrified Finn; it was so
intense, and the hungry way they looked at him made him stumble, the women and the
scruffy children, the maimed, the old, the soldiers; cold, curious stares that he dared not
meet, so that he looked down, at his feet, at the dirt on the road, anywhere but at them.

The only sound that rang in the steep streets was the steady tramp of the six guards
around him, the crack of their iron-soled boots on the cobbles, and far above, circling like
an omen, a single large bird screeching mournful cries among the clouds and echoing


winds of Incarceron's vault.

Then someone sang back, a single note of lament, and as if it was a signal, all the crowd
picked it up and crooned it softly, their sorrow and their fear in one strange soft song. He
tried to make out the words, but only fragments came to him ... the silver thread that broke
... all down the endless halls of guilt and dreams ... and like a chorus the haunting,
repeated phrase: his fingerbone the key, his blood the oil that smoothes the lock.

Turning a corner, Finn glanced back.

Gildas walked behind, alone. The guards ignored him, but he walked firmly, his head high,
and the peoples eyes moved wonderingly over the green of his Sapient coat.

The old man looked grim and purposeful; he gave Finn a brief nod of encouragement.

245
There was no sign of Keiro or Attia. Desperately Finn stared into the crowds. Had they
found out what was happening to him? Would they wait outside the Cave?

Had they spoken to Claudia? Anxiety tormented him, and he would not let himself think
the thing that he dreaded, that lurked in the dark of his mind like a spider, like Incarceron's
mocking whisper.

That Keiro might have taken the Key and gone.

He shook his head. In the three years of the Comitatus, Keiro had never betrayed him.
Taunted him, yes, laughed at him, stolen from him, fought with him, argued with him. But
he'd always been there. And yet now Finn realized with a sudden coldness how little he
knew about his oathbrother, about where he had come from. Keiro just said his parents
were dead. Finn had never asked any questions. He'd always been too absorbed in his
own agonizing loss, in the memory flashes and the fits.

He should have asked.

He should have cared.

A rain of tiny black petals began to fall on him. Looking up he saw that the people were
throwing them, tossing out handfuls that fell on the cobbles and made a fragrant dark
carpet on the road. And he saw that the petals had a peculiar quality, that as they touched
each other they melted, and that the gutters and streets ran with a sticky, clotted mass that
exuded the sweetest of scents.


246
It made him feel strange. And as if it broke into a dream, it made him remember the voice
he had heard in the night.

I am everywhere. As if the Prison had answered him. He looked up now, as they marched
under the gaping maw of the gate, and saw a single red Eye in the portcullis, its
unblinking gaze fixed on him,

\"Can you see me?\" he breathed. \"Did you speak to me?\"

But the gate was behind him and they were out of the City.

The road led straight and it was deserted. The sticky oil trickled along it; behind he heard
the gates and doors slam, the wooden bolts drawn across, the iron grilles crash down.
Out here under the vault the world seemed empty, the plain swept by icy winds.

The soldiers hastily unshouldered the heavy axes they carried; the one in front also had
some sort of device with a canister attached, a Same-throwing machine, Finn guessed.
He said, \"Let the Sapient catch up.\"

They slowed, as if now he was not their prisoner but their leader, and Gildas strode
breathlessly up and said, \"Y brother hasn't shown himself\"
                            our

\"He'll turn up.\" Saying it helped.

They walked swiftly, closed into a tight group. On either side the ground was seamed with
pits and traps; Finn saw the steel teeth gleam in their depths. Glancing back, he was
surprised at how the City was already far behind, its walls lined with people, watching,
shouting, holding their children up to see.

247
The guard captain said, \"We turn off the road here. Be careful; step only where we step
and don't think of running off. The ground is sewn with fireglobes.\"

Finn had no idea what fireglobes were, but Gildas frowned. \"This Beast must be
fearsome indeed.\"

The man glanced at him. \"I have never seen it, Master, and don't intend to.\"

Once off the smooth road the going was rough. The coppery earth seemed to have been
scored and clawed into vast furrows; in several places it was burned, carbonized to a


charcoal crispness that rose in clouds of dust as they trod on it, or vitrified almost to
glass. Enormous heat would have been needed to do that, Finn thought. It stank too, an
acrid cindery smell. He followed the men closely, watching their steps with nervous
attention; when they paused and he raised his head, he saw that they were far out on the
plain, the Prison lights so high above they were brilliant suns, casting his and Gildas's
shadows behind them.

Far in the mile-high vault the bird still circled. Once it screeched, and the guards looked
up at it. The nearest muttered, \"Looking for carrion.\"

Finn began to wonder how far they would walk. There were no hills out here, no ridges, so
where would they find a cave? He had pictured it as some dark aperture in a metallic cliff.
Now he was filled with a new apprehension, because even his imagination was betraying
him.

248
\"Stop.\" The guard captain held up a hand. \"This is it.\"

There was nothing there. That was Finn's first idea. Relief flooded him. It was all a
pretense. They'd let him go now, run back to the City, spin some gruesome tale about a
monster to keep the people quiet.

Then, as he pushed past the men, he saw the pit in the ground.

And the Cave.

***

JARED SAID, \"Y promised them maps that don't exist! It was a crazy idea, Claudia.
                 ou
Things are getting so dangerous for us!\"

She knew he was deeply worried. She crossed to his side of the carriage and said,
\"Master, I know. But the stakes are so high.\"

He looked up and she saw the pain was back behind his eyes. \"Claudia, tell me you're
not thinking seriously about this folly of Evian's. We are not murderers!\"

\"I'm not. If my plan works, there'll be no need of it.\" But she didn't say what she was
thinking: that if the Queen really did find out, that if he, Jared, was in any danger at all, she
would have them all killed without hesitation, even her father, to save him.

Maybe he knew it. As the carriage jolted he glanced out of the window and his expression


darkened, his black hair brushing the collar of the Sapient coat. \"Here's our prison,\" he
said bleakly.

249
And following his gaze she saw the pinnacles and glass towers of the Palace, the turrets
and towers festooned with flags and bunting, heard that all the bells were ringing to
welcome her, all the doves flapping, all the cannon were being fired in deep booming
salute from every mile-high terrace that rose in splendor into the pure blue sky.

We have put everything that is left into this.

***

\"Take this, and this.\"

The guard captain thrust a small leather bag and a sword into Finn's hands. The bag
seemed so light, it must be empty. \"What's in it?\" he asked nervously.

\"You'll see.\" The man stepped back and glanced at Gildas. Then he said, \"Why not flee,
Master? Why waste your life?\"

\"My life is Sapphique's,\" Gildas snapped. \"His fate is mine.\" The captain shook his head.
\"Suit yourself. But no one else has ever come back.\" He jerked his head at the Cave
entrance.

\"There it is.\"

There was a moment of tense silence. The guards gripped their axes tightly; Finn knew
that this was the moment they expected him to make some sort of break for freedom, now
that he had a sword in his hand and his back to unknown terrors. How many of those
brought as Tribute had screamed and fought in panic here?


Not him. He was Finn.

Reckless, he turned and looked down at the crack.

251
It was very thin, and utterly black. Its edges were burned and scorched, as if the metal of
the Prison's structure had been superheated and melted countless times into grotesque
twistings and taperings. As if whatever crawled out of these metal lips could melt steel
like toffee.

He glanced at Gildas. \"I'll go first.\" Before the Sapient could object, he turned and
lowered himself into the slash of darkness, taking one last rapid look into the distance.
But the scarred plain was empty, the City a remote fortress.

He slithered his boots over the edge, found a foothold, squeezed his body in.

Once he was below ground level, the darkness closed over him. By feeling with hands
and feet he realized that the crack was a horizontal space between tilted strata, and it
sloped down into the ground. He had to spread-eagle himself to fir in it, inching forward
over a dark slab-like surface littered with debris that seemed to be stones and smooth
balls of melted steel that rolled painfully under him. His fingers groped in dust and a lump
of rubble that crumbled away like bone. He dropped it hastily.

The roof was low; twice it grazed his back and he began to fear being stuck. As soon as
the thought touched him with cold terror he stopped.

Sweating, he gulped a deep breath. \"Where are you?\"

\"Right behind.\" Gildas sounded strained. His voice echoed; a small shower of dust fell
from above into Finn's hair and eyes. A hand grabbed his boot. \"Move on.\"

252
\"Why?\" He tried to roll his head to look back. \"Why not wait here till Lightsout, then crawl
back. Don't tell me those men will wait out there until dark. They've probably gone already.
What's to stop us ...?\"

\"Fireglobes are to stop us, fool boy. Acres of them. One wrong step and your foot's blown
off. And you didn't see what I saw last night, how they patrol the City walls, how vast
searchlights sweep the plain all night. We'd be easily seen.\" He laughed, a grim bark in
the darkness. \"I meant what I said to the blind women. Y are a Starseer. If Sapphique
                                                         ou
came here, so must we. Though I fear my theory that the way out leads upward seems
doomed to be proved wrong.\"


Finn shook his head in disbelief. Even in this mess the old man cared more about his
theories than anything else. He scrabbled on, digging the toes of his boots in and heaving
himself forward.

For the next few minutes he was sure that the roof was dipping so low that it would meet
the floor and trap him; then, to his relief, the gap began to widen and at the same time tip
leftward and slope more steeply. Finally he could rise to his knees without banging his
head on the roof. \"It opens ahead.\" His voice was hollow.

\"Wait there.\"

Gildas fumbled. There was a loud crack and light hissed; one of the crude, smoking flares
the Comitatus had used to signal distress. It showed Finn the Sapient lying flat on his
stomach

253
dragging a candle from the pack. He lit it from the flare; as the spitting red light died, the
small flames flickered, guttering in a draft from somewhere ahead.

\"I didn't know you'd brought those.\"

\"Some of us,\" Gildas said, \"thought to bring more than garish clothes and useless rings.\"
He cupped his hand around the flame. \"Go quietly. Though whatever it is it will have
already smelled and heard us coming.\"

As if in answer, something rumbled ahead. A low grinding sound, sensed like a vibration
under their splayed hands. Finn tugged the sword out and gripped it tight. He could see
nothing in the blackness.

He moved on, and the tunnel opened, became a space around him. In the flicker of the
tiny candle flame he saw the ridged sides of the metal strata, outcrops of crystal quartzes,
strange furrings of oxides that gleamed in turquoises and orange as the light edged past
them. He pulled himself to hands and knees.

Ahead, something moved. He sensed it rather than heard it, felt a draft of foul air that
caught in the back of his throat. Very still, he listened, every sense straining.

Behind him, Gildas grunted.

\"Keep still!\"


The Sapient cursed. \"Is it here?\"

\"I think so.\"

He was becoming aware of the space. As he grew accustomed to the darkness, edges
and facades of sloping rock began

254
to separate from shadows; he saw a pinnacle of scorched stone and realized with
sudden shock that it was immense, and a long way off, and that the draft was a wind now,
blowing in his face, a warm stench like the breathing of a great creature, a terrible acrid
stink.

And then in an instant of clarity he knew it was curled all around him, that the black,
faceted rock face was its scabbed skin, the vast spurs of stone its fossilized claws, that
he was in a cave formed by the ancient, scaly hide of some smoldering beast.

He turned to yell a warning.

But slowly, with a terrible creaking weight, an eye opened. A red eye, heavily lidded,
bigger than he was.

***

ALL THE way through the streets the noise was deafening. Flowers were flung constantly;
after a while Claudia found herself flinching at the repeated thud and slither of the impact
on the carriage roof and the scent of the crushed stems grew sweet and cloying. The
climb was steep and she was tossed uncomfortably in the seat; beside her Jared looked
pale. She took his arm. \"Are you all right?\"

He smiled wanly. \"I wish we could get out. Throwing up on the Palace steps won't make
much of an impression.\"

She tried to smile. Together they sat in silence as the carriage rumbled and clattered
through the gateways of the Outer Citadel, under its vast defenses, through its courtyards
and cobbled porticoes, and with each twist and turn, she knew

255
she was becoming ensnared deeper and deeper in the life that waited for her here, the
mazes of power, the labyrinth of treachery. Slowly the raucous shouts faded; the wheels
ran smoothly, and peeping around the curtain she saw that the road was lined with red


carpet, expensive swathes of it, and all across the streets garlands of flowers hung and
doves flapped between roofs and gables.

There were more people up here; these were the apartments of the courtiers, the Privy
Council and the Office of the Protocol, and the cheers were more refined, punctuated by
bursts of music from viols and serpents and fife and drum. Somewhere ahead she could
hear roars and clapping--Caspar was obviously leaning from the window of his coach to
acknowledge his welcome home.

\"They'll want to see the bride,\" Jared murmured.

\"She's not here yet.\"

A silence. Then she said, \"Master, I'm afraid.\" She felt his surprise. \"I am, truly. This place
scares me. At home, I know who I am, what to do. I'm the Warden's daughter, I know
where I stand. But this is a dangerous place, full of pitfalls. All my life I've known it was
waiting for me, but now I'm not sure I can face it. They'll want to absorb me, make me one
of them, and I won't change, I won't! I want to stay me.\"

He sighed, and she saw his dark gaze was fixed on the veiled window. \"Claudia, you're
the bravest person I know.\"

\"I'm not...\"

256
\"Y are. And no one will change you. Y will rule here, though k won't be easy. The
  ou                                      ou
Queen is powerful, and she will envy you, because you're young and you'll take her place.
Y power is as great as hers.\"
 our

\"But if they send you away ...\"

He turned. \"I won't go. I am not a brave man, I understand that. Confrontation disturbs me;
one look from your father and I'm chilled to the bone, Sapient or not. But they can't make
me leave you, Claudia.\" He sat upright, away from her. \"I have looked death in the face for
years now, and that gives some sort of recklessness, at least.\"

\"Don't talk about that.\"

He shrugged gently. \"It will come. But we mustn't think so much of ourselves. We should
consider whether we can help Finn. Give me the Key and let me work on it a little more. It
has complexities I've barely guessed at yet.\"


As the coach joked over a threshold she took it from her hidden pocket and gave it to
him, and as she did so the wings of the eagle deep in the crystal flickered, as if it flapped
them and took off. Jared pulled back the curtain quickly, and the sun caught the gleaming
facets.

The bird was flying.

It was flying over a dark landscape, a charred plain. Far below, a chasm gaped in the
earth, and the bird swooped and plummeted inside, twisting sideways into the narrow
crack, making Claudia hiss with fear.

257
The Key went black. One single red light pulsed in it.

But even as they stared at it the coach rumbled to a halt, the horses stamping and
blowing, and the door was flung open. The Warden's shadow darkened the threshold.
\"Come, my dear,\" he said quietly. \"They're all waiting.\"

Without looking at Jared, without even letting herself think, she stepped out of the coach
and drew herself upright, her arm in her father's.

Together, they faced the double row of applauding courtiers, the splendor of silk banners,
the great stairway leading upward to the throne.

Sitting on it, resplendent in a silver gown with vast ruff, sat the Queen. Even from this
distance the redness of her hair and lips were evident, the radiance of the diamonds at
her neck. Behind her shoulder, a scowling presence, stood Caspar.

The Warden said calmly, \"The smile, I think.\"

She put it on. The bright, confident smile, as false as everything in her life, a cloak over
the coldness.

Then they walked steadily up the stairs.

***

IT WASthe ironic stare of his nightmares and he recognized it, his voice hoarse. \" You? \"

Behind, he heard Gildas's gasp. \"Strike at it. Strike, Finn!\"

The Eye was aswirl. Its pupil was a spiral of movement, a scarlet galaxy. All around it,


heaving itself up, the darkness convulsed, and he saw the vast hide of the Beast was
studded with objects,

258
bits of jewelry, bones, fragments of rags, shafts of weapons. They were centuries old; skin
and hide had grown over them. With a tearing and cracking an outcrop of dark faceted
rock became its head and reared up over him; spurs of metal slid out like claws, grasping
the shuddering tilting floor of the cavern.

Finn couldn't move. Dust and fumes clouded over him.

\"Strike!\" Gildas grabbed his arm.

\"Its useless. Can't you see ...?\"

Gildas gave a roar of anger, snatched the sword from him, and thrust it into the clotted
hide of the Beast, leaping back as if he expected blood to cascade out in a great gout.
Then he stared, seeing what Finn had seen.

There was no wound. The hide opened and dissolved, absorbed the blade, reassembled
around it. The Beast was a composite creature, a grinding, swift formation of millions of
beings, of bats and bones and beetles, dark clouds of bees, an ever-changing
kaleidoscope pattern of rock fragments and metal shards. As it turned and rose into the
roof of the chamber, they saw that over the centuries it had absorbed all the terror and the
fear of the City, that all the Tribute sent out to placate it had been absorbed, eaten, had
only made it grow huger. Somewhere inside it were the billions of atoms of the dead, of
the victims and the children dragged out here by decree of the Justices. It was a
magnetized mass of flesh and metal, its crumbling tail studded with fingernails and teeth
and talons.

It stretched out its head above them and leaned down,

259
bringing the great red Eyes close to Finn's face, making his skin scarlet, his shaking
hands look as if they were red with blood.

\"Finn,'' it said, in a voice of deep pleasure, a throaty treacle of huskiness. \"At last.\"

He stepped back, into Gildas. The Sapient's hand gripped his elbow. \"Y know my
                                                                      ou
name.\"


\"I gave you your name.\" Its tongue flickered in the dark cavern of its mouth. \"Gave it long
ago, when you were born in my cells. When you became my son.\"

He was shuddering. He wanted to deny it, shout Out, but no words would come.

The creature tipped its head, studying him. The long muzzle, dripping bees and scales,
fragmented into a cloud of dragonflies and re-formed again. \"I knew you'd come,\" it said.
\"I've been watching you, Finn, because you are so special. In all the entrails and veins
of my body, in all the millions of beings I enclose, there is no one quite like you.\"

The head zoomed closer. Something like a smile formed and broke. \"Do you really think
you can escape from me? Do you forget that I could kill you, shut down light and air,
incinerate you in seconds?\"

\"I don't forget,\" he managed to say.

\"Most men do. Most men are content to live in their prison and think it is the world, but
not you, Finn. You remember about me. You look around and see my Eyes watching
you, in those nights of darkness you called out to me and I heard you ...\"

260
\"Y didn't answer,\" he whispered.
  ou

\"But you knew I was there. You are a Starseer, Finn. How interesting that is.\"

Gildas pushed forward. He was white, his sparse hair wet with sweat. \"Who are you?\" he
growled.

\"I am Incarceron, old man. You should know It was the Sapienti who created me. Your
                                            .
great, towering, overreaching endless failure. Your nemesis.\" I zigzagged closer, its
mouth wide so that they could see the rags of cloth that hung there, smell the oily, oddly
sweet stench of k. \"Ah, the pride of the Wise. And now you dare to seek a way free of
your own folly.\"

It slid back, the red Eyes narrowing to slits. \"Pay me, Finn. Pay me as Sapphique paid.
Give me your flesh, your blood. Give me the old man and his terrible desire for death.
Then perhaps your Key may open doors you do not dream of\"

Finn's mouth was dry as ash. \"This isn't a game.\"

\"No?\" The Beast's laugh was soft and slithering. \"Are you not pieces on a board?\"


\"People.\" His anger was rising. \"People that suffer. People you torment.\"

For a moment the creature dissolved to clouds of insects. Then they clotted in abrupt
gargoyles, a new face, serpentine and sinuous. \"I'm afraid not. They torment each other.
There is no system that can stop that, no place that can wall out evil, because men
bring it in with them, even in the children. Such men are beyond correction, and it is my
task only to

261

contain them. I bold them inside myself. I swallow them whole.\"

A tentacle lashed out and around his wrist. \"Pay me, Finn.\"

Finn jerked back, glanced at Gildas. The Sapient looked shrunken, his face drawn as if all
his dread had fallen on him at once, but he said slowly, \"Let it take me, boy. There's
nothing for me now.\"

\"No.\" Finn stared up at the Beast, its reptilian smile inches from him. \"I've already given
you one life.\"

\"Ah. The woman.\" The smile lengthened. \"How her death tears at you. Conscience and
shame are so rare. They interest me.\"

Something in its smirk made him catch his breath. A jolt of hope hurt him; he gasped,
\"She's not dead! Y caught her, you stopped her fall! Didn't you? Y saved her.\"
                  ou                                              ou

The red spiral winked at him. \"Nothing is wasted here,\" it murmured.

Finn stared, but Gildas's voice was a growl in his ear. \"It's lying, boy.\"

\"Maybe not. Maybe ...\"

\"It's playing with you.\" Sour with disgust, the old man stared at the swirling confusion of
the Eye. \"If it is true we made such a thing as you, then I'm ready to pay for our folly.\"

\"No.\" Finn grabbed him tight. He slid a dull circle of silver from his thumb and held it up, a
glittering spark. \"Take this for your Tribute instead, Father?'

It was the skull-ring. And he was beyond caring.

I have worked for years in secret to make a device that is a copy of the one Outside.
Now it protects me. Timon died last week and Pela is missing in the riots, and even
though

I am hidden here in this lost hall, the Prison searches for me. \"My lord\" it whispers, \"I
feel

you. I feel you crawl on my skin.\"

--Lord Calliston's Diary

***

The Queen rose graciously.

In the porcelain whiteness of her face her strange eyes were clear and cold. \"My dear,
dear, Claudia.\"

Claudia dropped a curtsy, felt the whisper of a kiss on each cheek, and in the tight grip of
the embrace sensed the thin bones of the woman, the small frame inside the boned
corset and huge hooped skirts.

No one knew Queen Sia's age. After all, she was a sorceress. Older than the Warden
perhaps, though beside her he was grave and dark, his silvered beard meticulous.

Brittle or not, her youth was convincing; she looked barely older than her son.

Turning, she led Claudia in, sweeping past Caspar's sullen

263
stare. \"Y look so pretty, my sweet. That dress is wonderful. And your hair! Now tell me,
         ou
is that natural or do you have it colored?\"

Claudia breathed out, already irritated, but there was no need to answer. The Queen was
already talking about something else. \"... and I hope you won't consider that too forward of
me.\"


\"No,\" Claudia said blankly into a second of silence.

The Queen smiled. \"Excellent. This way.\"

It was a double wooden door and was flung open by two footmen, but when Claudia was
inside, the doors closed and the whole tiny chamber moved soundlessly upward.

\"Y I know,\" the Queen murmured, holding her close. \"Such a breach of Protocol. But it's
  es
only for me, so who's to know?\"

The small white hands were so tight on her arm, she could feel the nails digging in. She
was breathless, as if she had been kidnapped. Even her father and Caspar were left
behind.

When the doors opened, the corridor that stretched before her was a vision of gilt and
mirrors; it had to be three times the size of the house at home. The Queen led her along it
by the hand, between vast painted maps that showed every country in the Realm,
adorned in their corners with fantasies of curling waves and mermaids and sea monsters.

\"That's the library. I know you love books. Caspar, unfortunately, is not so studious. Really,
I don't know if he can read at all. We won't go in.\"

264
Escorted firmly past, she looked back. Between each map stood a blue and white china
urn that could have hidden a man, and the mirrors reflected each other in such sunlit
confusion that she suddenly had no idea where the corridor ended or if it ever did. And
the small white figure of the Queen seemed repeated before her and behind and to the
side, so that the dread Claudia had felt in the coach seemed to be concentrated in that
swift, unnaturally young stride, that sharp, confiding voice.

\"And this is your suite. Y father is next door.\"
                          our

Immense.

A carpet her feet sank into, a bed so canopied with saffron silk, she felt it would drown
her.

Suddenly she pulled her hand from the Queen's and stood back, knowing the trap.
Knowing she was caught in it.

Sia was silent. The empty chatter was gone. They faced each other.


Then the Queen smiled. \"Y will not need to be warned, I'm sure, Claudia. John Arlex's
                            ou
daughter will be well trained, but I suppose it won't hurt to tell you that many of the mirrors
are double sided and the listening devices all over the Palace are most efficient.\" She
stepped closer. \"Y see, I have heard you were recently a little curious about dear lost
                  ou
Giles.\"

Claudia kept her face perfectly composed, but her hands were icy. She glanced down.
\"I've thought about him. If things had been different...\"

\"Y And we were all devastated by his death. But even if
  es.

265
the Havaarna Dynasty is over, the Realm must be governed. And I have no doubt,
Claudia, that you will do it very well.\"

\"Me?\"

\"Of course.\" The Queen turned and sat elegantly on a gilt chair. \"Surely you know Caspar
is incapable even of ruling himself? Come and sit here, my sweet. Let me advise you.\"

Surprise was freezing her. She sat.

The Queen leaned forward, her red lips making a coy smile. \"Now, your life here can be a
very pleasant one. Caspar is a child--let him have his toys, horses, palaces, girls, and he
will make no trouble. I have made quite sure he knows nothing about politics. He gets
bored so easily! Y and I can have such a pleasant time, Claudia. Y have no idea how
                   ou                                                 ou
tiresome It gets with just these men.\"

Claudia stared at her hands. Was this real, any of it? How much of it was the game?

\"I thought...\"

\"That I hated you?\" The Queen's giggle was girlish. \"I need you, Claudia! We can rule
together, and you'll be so good at it! And your father will smile his grave smile. So.\" Her
small hands tapped Claudia's. \"No more sad thoughts about Giles. He's in a better place,
my dear.\"

Slowly, she nodded and stood, and the Queen stood too, with a rustle of silk.

\"There's just one thing.\"

One hand on the door, Sia turned. \"Yes?\"


266
\"Jared Sapiens. My tutor. I ...\"

\"Y won't need a tutor. I can teach you everything now.\"
  ou

\"I want him to stay.\" She said it firmly.

The Queen stared straight back. \"He's young for a Sapient. I don't know what your father
was thinking of...\"

\"He will stay.\" She made sure it was a statement, not a question.

The Queen's red lips twitched. Her smile was pleasant. \"Whatever you say, my sweet.
Whatever you want.\"

***

JARED PLACED the scanner on the door frame, opened the tiny casement, and sat on
the bed. The room was sparse, as perhaps the Court thought a Sapient's cell should be,
with wooden floorboards and dark paneling topped with trefoils and crude roses.

It smelled of rushes and damp, and seemed bare enough, but he had already removed
two small listening devices and there might be others. Still, he had to take the chance.

He took out the Key and held it, activating the speechlink.

Nothing but darkness.

He touched it again, concerned: The darkness grew to a wide circle but remained dark.
Then, very faintly, he saw the edge of a crouching figure in it. \"We can't talk,\" it whispered.
\"Not now.\"

\"Then listen.\" Jared kept his voice low. \"This may help. A combination of two, four, three,
one on the touch panel produces a dampening field. Any surveillance system will lose

267
track of you, completely. Y disappear from its scanners. Do you understand, that?\"
                           ou'll

\"I'm not stupid.\" Keiro's scornful whisper barely came through.


\"Have you found Finn?\"

Nothing. They'd switched off.

Jared linked his fingers and swore softly in the Sapient tongue. Outside the window, the
voices of people rose up, some fiddlers in the distant gardens scraping a jig.

There would be dancing tonight to welcome the bride of the Heir.

And yet if the old man Bartlett had been right, the real Heir was still alive, and Claudia
was convinced it was this boy Finn. Jared shook his head, unfastening the collar of his
coat with long fingers. She wanted it so much. His doubts would have to stay silent,
because without this hope, she would have nothing. And after all, it was possible, just
possible, that her instinct was right.

\"wearily, he leaned back against the stiff bolster, took the medication pouch from his
pocket, and prepared the dose. It was three grains stronger now, and had been for the
last week, but the pain that lived deep in his body seemed still to grow slowly, like a living
thing; he sometimes thought that it devoured the drug, that he was feeding its appetite.

He applied the syringe, frowning. These were morbid and foolish ideas.

268
But when he lay back and slept, he dreamed for a moment that an eye, scarlet as
galaxies, had opened in the wall and looked at him.

***

FINN WAS desperate; he held the ring high. \"Take it and let us

The Eye zoomed in, examined it closely. \"Do you believe this object is of some value? \"

\"It contains a life. Trapped inside.\"

\"How apposite. As all your lives are trapped inside me.\"

He was shivering. Surely if Keiro was listening, he would act now. If he was here.

Gildas understood. He must have, because he snapped loudly,

\"Take it! let us go.\"


\"As I took Tribute from Sapphique? As I took this?\" In the clotted hide of the Beast a
glimmer of light opened; they saw a tiny frail bone, embedded deep.

Gildas murmured a prayer of awe.

\"How small it is!\" The Beast considered it. \"And yet how much pain it cost Let me see
this trapped life.\"

It slid the tendril closer. Finn gripped the ring in his fist, his sweat making it slippery. Then
he opened his hand.

At once, the Eye blinked. It widened, contracted, stared around. From the Beast's throat a
whisper slid like oil, a puzzled, fascinated demand.

\"How did you do that? Where are you?\"

269
A hand clamped over Finn's mouth; as he convulsed around he saw Attia, one finger on
her lips in warning. Behind her Keiro stood, the Key held tight in one hand, a flamethrower
in the other.

\"You are invisible!\" The Beast sounded appalled. \"This isn't possible!\"

A mass of tentacles streamed out from it, groping formations of tiny spiders sticky with
thread. Finn stumbled back.

Keiro shouldered the flamethrower. \"If you want us,\" he said calmly, \"here we are.\"

A burst of flame roared across Finn; the Beast howled with rage. In an instant the cavern
was an explosion of panicking, screeching birds and bees and bats released from shape
and order; they arced and flapped and spiraled high into the cavern roof, beating
themselves senselessly against rock.

Keiro whooped with delight. He fired again, a burst of yellow flame, and the Beast was a
clattering cascade of fragments, of scorched skin and tumbling rock, its red Eye nothing
but a tiny explosion of gnats that split in frenzied fear.

The flames sizzled, hit walls, and rebounded in sudden heat. \"Leave it!\" Finn yelled. \"Let's
get out!\"

But the roof and floor were tilting, the crack closing around them.


\"I may not be able to see you, \"the Prison remarked acidly through the uproar, \"but you
re in here, and I will hold you tight, my son.\"

270
Back to back it forced them together, spiraling in, the cave walls falling, slabs of the roof
crashing down. Finn grabbed for Attia's hand in the chaos. \"Stay together!\"

\"Finn.\" Gildas's voice was choked. \"In the wall. Up there.\"

For a moment Finn had no idea what he meant; then he saw it. A fissure sloping up.

Instantly Attia pulled herself free. She ran and leaped; catching at the jutting facets, she
dragged herself above the whipping tentacles, climbing the very scales of the Beast itself.

He shoved Gildas after her; the old man clambered awkwardly but with desperate vigor,
lumps of stone and gems rolling and sliding under his hands.

Finn turned.

Keiro had the weapon ready. \"Go on! It's searching for us!\"

Incarceron was blinded. He saw how parts of the Beast reformed, a claw, a tail, how it
groped and lashed in the darkness. It felt them on its skin, sensed the vibrations of their
movement. He wanted to ask Keiro how he had done this, but there was no time, so he
turned and scrambled after Gildas,

Minute by minute the wall was changing, re-forming and rippling, tilting itself straighter as
if the Beast reared up, twisting itself around to tear them from its back. High into the
cavernous spaces it took them, hanging on, and as Finn stared up he saw cracks of light
up there, pinpricks of brilliance, and for a giddy moment he was among the stars, and
then one swiveled over him and it was a searchlight,

271
silvering his hands and face as he gasped, helplessly exposed.

Attia turned, her face a blur. \"Slow down! We have to stay near the Key!\"

Keiro was climbing far below, the flamethrower cast aside. As the ridged hide rippled he
slipped, one foot scraping into space, and maybe the Beast felt that, because it hissed,
and the air steamed with sudden fumes.


\"Keiro!\" Finn turned. \"I'll have to go back for him.\"

Attia squirmed down. \"No. He can manage.\"

Keiro clung right. He pulled himself back; the Beast quivered. Then it laughed, that
sinister chuckle Finn remembered so well. \"So you have some device to mask
yourselves with. I congratulate you. But I certainly intend to discover what it is.\"

Dust fell; a shaft of light. \"Wait!\" Finn yelled at Gildas; breathlessly the old man shook his
head.

\"I can't hang on anymore.\"

\"Y can!\"
  ou

He gave Attia a desperate look; she hauled Gildas's arm over her shoulders and said', \"I'll
stay with him.\"

He almost fell down to where Keiro hung, grabbed him with one hand and clung to him.
\"It's useless! There's no way out.\"

\"There has to be,\" Keiro gasped. \"Don't we have a Key?\"

He wriggled it out and Finn's hand caught it; for a moment they were both holding it. Then
Finn snatched it and held it away. He pressed every button, jabbed at the eagle, its
sphere, its crown. Nothing. As the Beast lashed under them he shook

272
the Key, swore at it, and felt the warmth of it grow suddenly in his hands, overheating with
an ominous whine. With a yelp he juggled it; it burned him.

\"Use it!\" Keiro yelled. \"Melt the rock!\"

Finn clamped the Key to the cave side. Instantly it hummed and clicked.

Incarceron screamed. A howl of anguish. Rocks clattered down, Atria shouted from
above. As Finn stared, a great white slit unzipped in the wall like a rip in the fabric of the
world.

***

THE WARDEN stood with Claudia at the window and looked down on the torchlit revelry.


\"Y did well,\" he said gravely. \"The Queen is pleased.\"
  ou

\"Good.\" Claudia was so tired, she could barely think.

\"Tomorrow, perhaps we ... He stopped.

A shrill, urgent bleep. Insistent and loud. Startled, Claudia stared around. \"What's that?\"

Her father stood very still. Then he reached into his waistcoat pocket and took out his
watch, and with a click of his thumb, sprang the gold case open. She saw the handsome
dial, the time. <<Quarter to eleven|10>>.

But this was no chime. It was an alarm.

The Warden stared. When he looked up, his eyes were cold and gray. \"I have to go. Good
night, Claudia. Sleep well.\"

Astonished, she watched him stride to the door. \"Is it ... is it the Prison?\" she said.

273
He turned, his gaze sharp. \"What makes you say that?\"

\"The alarm .. , I've never heard it before ...\"

He was watching her. She cursed herself. Then he said, \"Y There seems to be an
                                                         es.
incident. Don't worry. I'll see to it personally.\"

The doors closed after him.

For a moment she stayed there, frozen. She stared at the wooden panels; then, as if the
stillness galvanized her into action, she grabbed a dark shawl, wrapped it around herself,
and flung herself at the door, opening it quickly.

He was well down the gilt corridor, walking fast. As soon as he rounded the corner, she
ran after him, breathless, silent on the soft carpets. Her image flickered in dim mirrors.

At the side of a great china vase a curtain swirled; slipping behind it she found herself at
the top of a dim flight of spiral stairs. She waited, her heart hammering, watching his dark
figure descend below, and she saw he was running, a quick, agitated step. Hurriedly she
edged down after him, around and around, one hand on the damp rail, until the gilt walls
became brick and then stone, the steps hollowed with use, slimed with green lichen.


It was cold down here, and very dark. Her breath clouded. She shivered and wrapped the
shawl tight.

He was going to the Prison.

He was going to Incarceron!

Faint, very far ahead, the alarm was bleeping, loud and urgent, a relentless panic.

274
These were the wine cellars. They were huge chambers, vaulted, piled with barrels and
casks, wiring snaking down their walls, hung with white salts that had oozed from the
brickwork. If it was Protocol, it was very convincing.

Peering around a stack of casks, she made herself keep still.

He had come to a gate.

It was green bronze, set deep in the wall, glistening with snail trails, corroded with age.
Great rivets studded it. Rusted chains hung across it. With a silent leap of her heart she
saw the Havaarna eagle, its outspread wings almost lost under layers of verdigris.

Her father glanced around and she ducked back, breathless. Then he tapped a swift
combination into the globe the eagle held; she heard a click.

Chains slid and swung, crashing down.

In a shower of spiderwebs and snails and dust y the gate juddered open.

She leaned out, desperate to see what lay behind, to see Inside, but there was only
darkness and a smell, a sour, metallic stink, and she had to dive back hastily as he
turned.

When she looked again he was gone, and the gate was closed.

Claudia leaned back on the wet bricks and breathed out a soundless whistle of damp
breath.

At last. Finally.

She had found it.


275

***

THE ALARM screamed in their teeth, in their nerves, in their bones. Finn thought it would
bring on a fit; terrified, he scrambled for the slit, against the icy wind that howled through
it.

The Beast was gone. Even as Keiro climbed over Finn and grabbed Gildas, k dissolved;
suddenly they were all tumbling in a cascade of fragments, and then they slammed
against the wall, a chain of bodies held only by Finn's grip.

He yelled with the agony. \"I can't hold you!\"

\"Y bloody will!\" Keiro gasped.
  ou

Terror stretched him. Keiro's hand slid, an agonizing jerk. He couldn't do it. His hand
scorched.

A shadow fell on him. He thought it was the Beast's head, or a great eagle, but as he
twisted in despair and stared up, he saw k swoop in through the slit, humming with
contained power, a silver ship, an ancient sailing ship, its sails a patchwork of cobweb, its
ropes tangled and dangling over the side.

It loomed above them, and very slowly, a hatch opened in its base. A basket was lowered,
swaying on four immense cables, and above it a face looked over the side of the ship, a
hideous, gargoyle face, deformed by goggles and a bizarre breathing apparatus,

\"Get in,\" it rasped. \"Before I change my mind.\"

How they did it he had no idea, but in seconds Keiro had tumbled into the wildly rocking
basket; Gildas hauled after him. Attia leaped, pausing only for a moment, and then Finn

276
let himself drop, his mind so black with relief that he fell without fear, and didn't feel
himself land, until a welcome silence exploded into Keiro's yell in his ear. \"Get off me,
Finn!\"

He struggled up. Attia was bending over him, concerned. \"Are you all right?\"

\"... Yes.\"


He wasn't, he knew, but he leaned past her to the edge and he looked over, giddy with the
swaying, the icy wind.

They were out of the Cave, above the plain, miles above the City. It lay like a toy on the
plain, and from this height they could see the scorch marks and the fumaroles around it,
as if the land itself was the skin of the Beast that rumbled beneath, fuming with wrath.

Clouds wisped across, vapors of metallic yellow, a rainbow.

Finn felt Gildas grab him, the old man's voice delirious with joy, snatched away by the
wind. \"Look up, boy! Sec! There are Sapienti still, with power!\"

He twisted his head. And saw, as the silver ship spiraled upward, a tower so narrow and
impossibly high that it seemed like a needle balanced upright on a cloud, its top
glimmering with light. He felt his breath frost and condense on the rail, crack and splinter,
each ice shard polarized by the tower, each crystal aligned as if by a magnet. Gasping in
the thin air, he gripped the old man's arm, shaking with cold and fear, not daring to look
down again, seeing only the minure landing place at the needle's tip grow bigger, the
slowly revolving globe at its apex.

277
And yet, high as they were, above them for miles and miles, the night of Incarceron
extended into the freezing sky.

***

THE HAMMERING woke Jared in a cold sweat of fear.

For a moment he had no idea what it was, and then he heard her whisper, \"Jared!
Quickly, it's me!\"

He sat up and stumbled over, tugging the scanner off the frame, fumbling for the latch. As
soon as he lifted it, the door flew open, almost hitting him in the face; then Claudia was
inside, breathless and dust-smeared, a filthy shawl around her silk dress.

\"What is it?\" he gasped. \"Claudia, has he found out? Does he know we have the Key?\"

\"No. No.\" She had no breath; she plumped down on the bed and bent double, clutching
her side.

\"Then what?\"


She raised her hand, making him wait; after a moment, when she could speak and
looked up, he saw her face was lit with triumph.

He stepped back, suddenly wary. \"What have you done, Claudia?\"

Her smile was bitter. \"What I've longed to do for years. I've found the door to his secret.
The entrance to Incarceron.\"

***


Finn carefully touched one of the spheres. It showed him his own face, swollen
grotesquely in delicate lilac glass. Behind him he saw Attia come through the archway
and stare around.

\"\"What is this?\" She stood amazed among the bubbles that hung from the ceiling, and he
saw how clean she was this morning, her hair scrubbed, the new clothes making her
seem younger than ever.

\"His laboratory. Look in here.\"

Some of the spheres contained whole landscapes. In one, a colony of small golden-furred
creatures slumbered peacefully

282
or dug in sandy hillocks. Atria spread her hands on it, flat on the glass. \"It feels warm.\"

He nodded. \"Did you sleep?\"

\"A bit. I kept waking up because it was so quiet. You?\"

He nodded, not wanting to say that his exhaustion had made him fall onto the small white
bed and sleep at once, without even undressing. Though when he had woken this
morning, he had found that someone had wrapped the blankets around him, and laid
clean clothes on the chair in the bare white room. Had it been Keiro?

\"Did you see the man on the ship? Gildas thinks he's a Sapient.\"

She shook her head. \"Not without the facemask. And all he said last night was 'Take
those rooms and we'll talk in the morning.'\" She glanced over. \"It was brave, going back
for Keiro.\"

They were silent for a while. He came around and stood next to her, and as they watched
the animals scratch and roll, they became aware that beyond this globe was a whole
chamber of glass worlds, aqua-green and gold and pale blue, each hanging from a fine
chain, some tinier than a fist, others vast as halls, where birds flew, or fish swam, or
billions of insects clouded and swarmed.

\"It's as if he's made cages for them all,\" she said quietly. \"I hope he hasn't got one for us.\"
Then, catching the sudden jerk of his reflection, \"What is it? Finn?\"

283


\"Nothing.\" His hands left hot smears on the sphere as he leaned on it.

\"Y saw something.\" Attia's eyes were wide. \"Was it the stars, Finn? Are there really
  ou
millions of them? Do they gather and sing in the darkness?\"

Stupidly, he didn't want to disappoint her. He said, \"I saw ... I saw a lake in front of a great
building. It was night. Lanterns were floating on the water, little paper lanterns each with a
candle inside so they looked blue and green and scarlet. There were boats on the lake
and I was in one of them.\" He rubbed his face. \"I was there, Attia. I was leaning over the
side and tried to touch my reflection in the water, and yes, there were stars. And they were
angry because my sleeve got wet.\"

\"The stars?\" She came closer.

\"No. The people.\"

\"What people? Who were they, Finn?\" He tried. There was a scent. A shadow.

\"A woman,\" he said. \"She was angry.\"

It hurt. Remembering hurt. It triggered flashes of light; he closed his eyes against them,
sweating, his mouth dry.

\"Don't.\" Anxious, she reached out to him, the welts red on her wrists where the chains had
chafed the skin. \"Don't upset yourself.\"

He rubbed his face with his sleeve and the room was still with a quiet he had not known
since the cell where he had been born. Awkwardly he muttered, \"Is Keiro still asleep?\"

284
\"Oh him!\" She scowled. \"Who cares?\" He watched her wander between the spheres.
\"Y can't dislike him that much. Y stuck with him in the City.\"
  ou                             ou

She was silent, so he said, \"How did you manage to follow us?\"

\"It wasn't easy\" She tightened her lips. \"We heard rumors about the Tribute, so he said
we should steal a flamethrower. I was the one who had to cause a diversion so he could
get it. Not that I got any thanks.\"

Finn laughed. \"That's Keiro. He never thanks anyone.\" Splaying his hands on the sphere,
he leaned his forehead on it and the reptiles inside stared back impassively. \"I knew he'd
come. Gildas said no, but Keiro would never betray me.\"


She made no answer but he became aware that her silence was charged with an odd
tension; when he looked up, she was watching him with something like anger. It burst out
of her abruptly. \"Y ou're so wrong, Finn! Can't you see what he's like? He would have left
you easily, just taken the Key and gone and not even cared!\"

\"No,\" he said, surprised.

\"Yes!\" She faced up to him, the bruises livid in the white skin of her face. \"Because it was
only the girl's threat that made him stay.\"

He felt cold. \"What girl?\"

\"Claudia.\"

\"He spoke to her!\"

285
\"She threatened him. 'Find Finn,' she said, 'or the Key will be useless to you.' She was
really angry with him.\" Attia shrugged lightly. \"It's her you should thank.\"

He wouldn't believe it.

There was no way he would.

\"Keiro would have come.\" His voice was low and stubborn. \"I know how he seems, that
he doesn't care about anyone, but I know him. We've fought together. We took the oath.\"

She shook her head. \"Y     ou're too trusting, Finn. Y must have been born Outside,
                                                      ou
because you don't fit here.\"

Then, hearing footsteps, she said quickly, \"Ask him for the Key. Ask him. Y see.\"
                                                                           ou'll

Keiro wandered into the room and whistled. He was wearing a doublet of dark blue, his
hair wet, and he was still eating an apple from the plate in their room, the last two skull-
rings gleaming on his fingers. \"So this is where you are!\" He turned a complete circle.
\"And this is a Sapient's tower. Beats the old man's cage.\"

\"I'm glad you think so.\" To Finn's dismay one of the largest spheres clicked open and a
stranger stepped out, followed by Gildas. He wondered how much they had overheard,
and how there could be steps inside the sphere leading down, but before he was sure
about that, it clicked shut and was just a glimmer among the hundreds of others.


Gildas wore a Sapient's robe of iridescent greens. His sharp face was washed, his white
beard trimmed. He looked different,

286
Finn thought. Some of the hunger had gone; when he spoke his voice was not querulous
but had a new gravity.

\"This is Blaize,\" he said. And then, softly, \"Blaize Sapiens.\"

The tall man bowed his head slightly. \"Welcome to my Chamber of Worlds.\"

They stared at him. Without the breathing mask, his face was remarkable, mottled with
sores and spots and acid bums, his thin straggle of hair tied back in a greasy ribbon.

Under the Sapient's coat he wore ancient knee breeches stained with chemicals, and a
ruffled shirt that perhaps had once been white.

For a moment no one spoke. Then, to Finn's surprise it was Attia who said, \"We have to
thank you, Master, for saving us. We would have died.\"

\"Ah ... well. Yes.\" He looked at her, his smile lopsided and awkward. \"That is indeed true. I
thought I had better come down.\"

\"Why?\" Keiro's voice was cool. The Sapient turned. \"I don't quite understand ...?\"

\"Why bother? To save us? Do we have something you need?\"

Gildas frowned. \"This is Keiro, Master. The one with no manners.\"

Keiro snorted. \"Don't tell me he doesn't know about the Key.\" He bit the apple, a loud
crunch in the silence.


Blaize turned to Finn. \"And you must be the Starseer.\" His

287
eyes looked at Finn with unnerving scrutiny. \"My colleague tells me Sapphique sent this
Key to you, and that it will lead you Outside. That you believe you came from Outside.\"

\"I did.\"

\"Y remember?\"
  ou

\"No. I just... believe.\"

For a moment the man gazed at him, one thin hand absently scratching a sore on his
cheek. Then he said, \"Regretfully, I have to tell you that you are mistaken.\"

Gildas turned in astonishment; Attia stared.

Annoyed, Finn said, \"What do you mean?\"

\"I mean you didn't come from Outside. No one has ever come from Outside. Because,
you see, there is no Outside.\"

For a moment the silence in the room was appalled, full of disbelief. Then Keiro laughed
softly and threw the apple core on the stone slabs of the floor. He came over, took out the
Key, and slapped it down next to the glass sphere. \"Ail right, Wise One. If there's no
Outside, what's this for?\"

Blaize reached out and picked it up. He turned it carelessly and calmly. \"Ah yes. I have
heard of such devices. Perhaps the original Sapienti invented them. There is a legend
that Lord Calliston made one in secret and died before he could try it. It renders the user
invisible to the Eyes, and no doubt has other abilities. But it cannot let you out.\"

Gently he placed the crystal on the table. Gildas glared at him. \"Brother, this is folly! We all
know Sapphique himself--\"

288
\"We know nothing about Sapphique but a muddle of tales and legends. Those fools down
there in the City, whose doings I watch to relieve my boredom, they invent new tales of
Sapphique every year.\" He folded his arms, his gray eyes relentless. \"Men love to make
stories, brother. They love to dream. They dream that the world is deep underground, and
if we could journey up we would find the way out, a trapdoor into a land where the sky is


blue and the land breeds corn and honey and there is no pain. Or that there are nine
circles of the Prison surrounding its center, and if we go deep into them we find the heart
of Incarceron, its living being, and we will emerge through it into another world.\" He shook
his head. \"Legends. Nothing more.\"

Finn was shocked. He glanced at Gildas; the old man seemed stricken, then anger burst
out of him. \"How can you say this?\" he snapped. \"Y a Sapient? I thought when I saw
                                                      ou,
what you were, that our struggles would be easier, that you'd understand ...\"

\"I do, believe me.\"

\"Then how can you say there is no Outside?\"

\"Because I have seen.\"

His voice was so somber and heavy with despair that even Keiro stopped pacing up and
down and stared at him. Beside Finn, Attia shivered. \"How?\" she whispered.

The Sapient pointed to a sphere, a black, empty shell. \"There. The experiment took me
decades, but I was determined. My

289
sensors penetrated metal and skin, bone and wire. I felt my way through miles of
Incarceron, its halls and corridors, its seas, its rivers. Like you, I believed.\" He laughed
harshly, biting the worn nails of his hand. \"And yes, I found Outside, in a way.\" He turned
and touched the controls, and the sphere lit. \"I found this.\"

They saw an image in the darkness. A sphere within the sphere, a globe of blue metal. It
hung in the everlasting blackness of space, alone, silent.

\"This is Incarceron.\" Blaize jabbed a ringer at it. \"And we live inside k. A world.
Constructed, or grown, who knows. But alone, in a vastness, a vacuum. In nothing. There
is Nothing outside.\" He shrugged. \"I am sorry. I do not wish to destroy the dreams of your
lifetime. But there is nowhere else to go.\"

Finn couldn't breathe. It was as if the bleak words drew the life out of him. He stared at the
globe and felt Keiro come close behind him, sensed his oathbrother's warmth and
energy, and it comforted him. But it was Gildas who surprised them all.

He laughed. A gruff, throaty roar of scorn. Drawing himself upright, he turned on Blaize
and glared at him. \"And you call yourself Wise! Fooled by the Prison's malice, more like.
It shows you lies and you believe them, and live up here above men and despise them.


Worse than a fool!\" He strode up to the taller man; Finn took a quick step after him. He
knew the old man's temper.

But Gildas stabbed the air with his knotty finger, and his

290
voice was hard and low. \"How dare you stand there and deny me my hope and these their
chance of life. How dare you tell me Sapphique is a dream, that the Prison is all there is!\"

\"Because it's true,\" Blaize said.

Gildas wrenched out of Finn's grip. \"Liar! You're no Sapient. And you forget. We've seen
Outsiders.\"

\"Yes!\" Attia said. \"And spoken to them.\"

Blaize paused. He said, \"Spoken to them?\"

For a moment it almost seemed his certainty was shaken. He linked his fingers together
and his voice was tight. \"Spoken to whom? Who are they?\"

Everyone looked at Finn, so he said, \"A girl called Claudia. And a man. She calls him
Jared.\"

There was a second of silence. Keiro said, \"So explain that.\"

Blaize turned his back. But almost at once he swung around and his face was grave. \"I
have no wish to upset you. But you've seen a girl and a man. How do you know where
they are?\"

Finn said, \"They're not here.\"

\"No?\" Blaize glanced at him quickly, his pocked face tipped sideways. \"How do you
know? Have you not thought that they also may be in Incarceron? In some other Wing,
some distant level where life seems different, where they don't even know they are
imprisoned? Think, boy! This quest for Escape will become a folly that will eat up your life.
Y will spend years in hopeless traveling, searching, and all for nothing! Find a place to
  ou
live, learn peace instead. Forget the stars.\"

291
His voice murmured among the glass spheres, high into the timbered rafters of the roof.


Dismayed, barely hearing Gildas's angry outburst, Finn faced the window and stood
there, staring out through the sealed glass at the drifting clouds of Incarceron's
stratosphere, too high for birds, the icy landscape miles below, the distant hills and dark
slopes that might be walls beyond his sight.

His own fear terrified him.

If this was true, there was no Escape, from here or from himself...

He was Finn and always would be, with no past and no future and there was nowhere to
go back to. No one else that he had once been.

Gildas and Attia were angry; they were arguing, but Keiro's cool comment sliced through
the noise and silenced everyone. \"Why don't we ask them?\" he said. He picked the Key
up and touched the controls; turning quickly, Finn saw how adept at it he was.

\"There's no point,\" Blaize said rapidly. \"For us there is.\"

\"Then I will leave you to speak to your friends.\" Blaize turned. \"I have no wish to do so.
Feel free to treat the tower as your home. Eat, rest. Think about what I've said.\"

He walked between the spheres and out of the door, the robe flapping about his stained
clothes, a faint scent of acid and something else, something sweet, drifting behind him.

292
As soon as he was gone Gildas swore, long and bitterly.

Keiro grinned. \"Y learned something useful from the Comitatus then.\"
                 ou

\"To think that after all these years I should find a Sapient and he should be so weak!\" The
old man sounded sick with disgust. Then he thrust out his hand. \"Give me that Key.\"

\"No need.\" Keiro placed it hastily on the table and stepped back. \"It's working.\"

The familiar hum rose; the holo-image sprang out and cleared to a circle of light. Today it
seemed even brighter than before, as if they were nearer its source, or its power had
grown. Into it, as close as if she were among them, Claudia stepped. Her eyes were
bright, her face alert. Finn almost felt he could reach out and touch her.

\"They found you,\" she said.

\"Yes,\" he whispered.


\"I'm so pleased.\"

Jared was with her, one arm leaning against what seemed like a tree. And suddenly Finn
realized they were sitting in a field , or a garden, and the light in that place was a glorious
gold.

Gildas shouldered past him. \"Master,\" he said curtly. \"Y are a Sapient?\"
                                                        ou

\"I am.\" Jared stood and bowed formally. \"As are you, I see.\"

\"For these fifty years, son. Before you were born. Now answer me three questions and
answer them true. Are you Outside Incarceron?\"

293
Claudia stared. Jared nodded slowly. \"Yes.\"

\"How do you know?\"

\"Because this is a palace, not a prison. Because the sun is above us, and the stars at
night. Because Claudia has discovered the gate that leads to the Prison ...\"

\"Have you?\" Finn gasped.

But before she could answer, Gildas snapped, \"One thing more. If you are Outside, where
is Sapphique? What did he do when he got out there? When will he return to release us?\"

There were flowers in the garden, brilliant red poppies.

Jared looked at Claudia, and in the silence between them a bee buzzed on the petals, a
small murmur that made Finn shiver with lost memory.

Then Jared stood and came forward, so close, he and Gildas were face-to-face.
\"Master,\" he said courteously. \"Forgive me for my ignorance. For my curiosity. Forgive
me if this seems a stupid question. But who is Sapphique?\"

294

23
***


Nothing has changed, or will change.

So we must change it.

--The Steel Wolves

***

Finn thought the bee would come out of the nimbus of gold and land on him. As it buzzed
near his hand, he jerked back and it darted away.

He looked at Gildas. The old man had almost staggered; Attia was helping him sit, and
Jared was reaching his own hand out as if to help, dismay on his face. He glanced at
Claudia; Finn heard his murmur. \"I shouldn't have asked. The Experiment ...\"

\"Sapphique Escaped.\" Keiro pulled a bench over and sat in the hologlow, its light rich on
his red coat. \"He got out. He's the only one that ever did. That's the legend.\"

\"No legend,\" Gildas snapped hoarsely. He looked up. \"Y really don't know? I thought ...
                                                      ou
that out there he would be a great man ... a king.\"

Claudia said, \"No. At least... Well, we could do some research. He may have gone into
hiding. Things here aren't perfect either.\" She stood quickly. \"Perhaps you don't know, but
people here believe Incarceron to be a wonderful place. A paradise.\"

295
They stared at her.

She saw the startled disbelief in their faces, Keiro's changing almost instantly to an
amused, acid grin. \"Fabulous,\" he murmured.

So she told them. She told them about the Experiment, her father, the sealed enigma of
the Prison. And then she told them about Giles. Jared said, \"Claudia ...\" but she waved a
hand at him and went on quickly, pacing on the astonishingly green grass. \"They didn't kill
him, we know that. They hid him. And I think they hid him in there. I think he's you.\"

She turned and faced them, and Keiro said, \"Are you saying ...\" and then stopped and
stared up at his oathbrother. \"Finn? A prince?\" He laughed, wondering. \"Are you crazy?\"

Finn hugged himself. He was shaking, he knew, and that rarely lost bewilderment was
back in the corner of his mind, glimmers of things gone as fast as shadows in dim
mirrors.


\"Y look like him,\" Claudia said firmly. \"There are no photographs allowed now, it's not
  ou
Protocol, but the old man had a painting.\" She held it up, slipping off the blue bag. \"Look.\"

Attia breathed in.

Finn shivered.

The child's hair was shining and his face lit with innocent happiness. Impossible health
radiated from him. His tunic was cloth of gold, his skin chubby and pink. A tiny eagle
seared his wrist.

Finn stepped closer. He reached out and she lifted the

296
miniature to him, and his fingers closed around the gilt frame; for a moment he felt he had
hold of it, that he touched it. And then his fingertips met on nothing and he knew that it was
far away, farther than he could imagine. And long ago.

\"There was an old man,\" Claudia said. \"Bartlett. He looked after you.\"

He stared at her. His emptiness scared them both.

\"Queen Sia then? Y stepmother, she must have hated you. Caspar, your half brother?
                  our
Y father, the King, who died. Y must remember!\"
 our                           ou

He wanted to. He wanted to drag them out of the blackness of his mind, but there was
nothing there. Keiro was standing and Gildas had his arm, but all he could see was
Claudia, her eager, fierce gaze on him, willing him to remember. \"We were betrothed.
When you were seven there was a big feast. A great celebration.\"

\"Leave him alone,\" Attia snapped. \"Leave him.\"

Claudia stepped closer. She stretched her hand out and tried to touch his wrist. \"Look at
it, Finn. They couldn't take it away. It proves who you are.\"

\"It proves nothing!\" Attia turned so suddenly, Claudia jerked back. The girl's fists were
clenched, her bruised face white. \"Stop tormenting him! If you loved him you'd stop! Can't
you see it hurts him and he can't remember? Y don't really care if it's him, if he's Giles.
                                               ou
All you want is not to marry this Caspar!\"

In the shocked silence Finn breathed hard. Keiro pushed


297
him onto the bench; his knees gave way and he sat quickly.

Claudia was pale. She took a step back, but her eyes never left Attia. Then she said,
\"Actually that's not true. I want the real King. The true Heir, even if he is of the Havaarna.
And I want to get you out of that place. All of you.\"

Jared came close and crouched. \"Are you all right?\"

Finn nodded. His mind was fogged; he rubbed his face with his hands.

\"He gets like this,\" Keiro said. \"And worse.\"

\"It may be the treatment they gave him.\" The Sapient's dark eyes met Gildas's. \"They
must have given him drugs to make him forget. Have you tried any antidotes. Master, any
therapies?

\"Our medicines are limited,\" Gildas growled. \"I use powdered tumentine and a decoction
of poppy. And once harestooth, but it made him sick.\"

Jared looked politely appalled. Claudia knew by his face that such things were so
primitive the Sapienti here had all but forgotten them. All at once she felt furious with
frustration; she wanted to reach in and drag Finn out, to break down the invisible barrier.
But that was no use, so she made herself say calmly, \"I've decided what to do. I'm coming
in. Through the gate.\"

\"How does that help us?\" Keiro asked, watching Finn.

It was Jared who answered. \"I've made a careful study of the Key. From what I can see,
our ability to contact each other is changing. The image is becoming clearer and more
focused.

298
This may be because Claudia and I have come to Court; we're nearer to you, and the Key
may register this. It may help you navigate toward the gate.\"

\"I thought there were maps.\" Keiro eyed Claudia. \"The Princess here said so.\"

Claudia sighed, impatient. \"I lied.\"

She looked straight at him; his blue eyes were sharp as ice.


\"But,\" Jared went on hastily, \"there are problems. There is a strange ... discontinuity that
puzzles me. The Key takes too long to show us each other; each time it seems to be
adjusting some physical or temporal parameter ... as if our worlds are somehow
misaligned ...\"

Keiro looked scornful; Finn knew he thought all this was a waste of time. From the bench
he lifted his head and said quietly, \"But you don't think, Master, do you, that Incarceron is
another world? That it floats free in space, far from Earth.\"

Jared stared. Then he said gently, \"No, I don't. A fascinating theory.\"

\"Who told you that?\" Claudia snapped.

\"It doesn't matter.\" Unsteadily, Finn stood. He looked at Claudia. \"In this Court of yours,
there's a lake, isn't there? Where we floated lanterns with candles inside?\"

The poppies around her were red tissue in the sun. \"Yes,\" she said.

\"And on my birthday cake, tiny silver balls.\" Claudia was so still, she could hardly breathe.

299
And then as he stared at her in unbearable tension her eyes went wide; she turned,
yelled, \"Jared! Turn it off! Turn it off!\"

And in the dark room of spheres instantly there was only darkness, and a strange tilted
giddiness, and a scent of roses.

Keiro reached his right hand carefully into the empty space where the holo-image had
been. Sparks spat; he jerked back, swearing.

\"Something scared them,\" Attia breathed. Gildas frowned. \"Not something. Someone.\"

SHE HAD smelled him. A sweet, unmistakable perfume that she realized now had been
there for a long time, that she had known but ignored, caught up in the tension of the
moment. Now, as she faced the blazing border of lavender and delphiniums and roses,
she felt Jared behind her rise slowly to his feet, heard his small breath of dismay as he
registered it too. \"Come out,\" she said icily.

He was behind the rose arch. He stepped from it reluctantly, the peach silk of his suit soft
as petals.


For a moment none of them spoke.

Then Evian smiled an embarrassed smile.

\"How much did you hear?\" Claudia demanded, hands on hips.

He took out a handkerchief and wiped sweat from his face. \"Quite too much, I'm afraid,
my dear.\"

\"Stop the act.\" She was furious.

300
He glanced at Jared and then, curiously at the Key. \"That is an amazing device. If we had
had any idea it existed, we would have moved heaven and earth to find it.\"

She hissed out a breath of anger and turned away. To her back he said shrewdly, \"You
know what it means, if that boy is really Giles.\"

She didn't answer.

\"It means that we have a figurehead for our coup. More than that, a righteous cause. As
you so thrillingly said, the true Heir. I gather this was the information you promised me?\"

\"Y es.\" She turned and saw his fascinated gaze, and it chilled her as it had before. \"But
listen, Evian. We're doing this my way. First of all I'm going through that gate.\"

\"Not alone.\"

\"No,\" Jared said swiftly. \"With me.\"

She shot him a startled look. \"Master ...\"

\"Together, Claudia. Or not at all.\"

A trumpet rang out in the Palace. She glanced toward the building in annoyance. \"All
right. But there's no need for assassinations, don't you see? If the people understand that
Giles is alive, if we show him to them, surely the Queen will never be able to deny it...\"

Her voice trailed off as she looked at them. Jared was playing unhappily with a small
white flower from the grass; rubbing its perfume between his fingers. He wouldn't look at
her. Evian did, but his small eyes were almost pitying. \"Claudia,\"


301
he said, \"are you such an innocent still?\" He came over to her, no taller than she was,
sweating in the warm sun. \"The people will never see Giles. She would not let that
happen. Y and he would be killed mercilessly, like the old man I spoke of. Jared too,
          ou
and anyone else they thought knew about the plot.\"

She folded her arms, feeling her face go hot. She felt humiliated, like a small child being
told off kindly, to make it worse. Because, of course, he was right.

\"They are the ones who must be killed.\" Evian's voice was low and hard. \"They must be
removed. We are decided on that. And we are ready to act.\"

She stared up at him. \"No.\"

\"Y Very soon now.\"
  es.

Jared dropped the flower and turned his head. He looked very pale. \"Y must at least
                                                                     ou
wait until after the wedding.\"

\"The wedding is in two days. As soon as it's over we will move. It's best if neither of you
know any details ...\" He raised a hand to forestall her. \"Please, Claudia, don't even ask
me. If it should go wrong, if you are questioned, this way you can give nothing away. Y  ou
won't know the time, or the place, or the method. Y have no idea who the Steel Wolves
                                                    ou
are. Y cannot be blamed.\"
      ou

By no one but herself, she thought bitterly. Caspar was a greedy little tyrant and would
grow worse. The Queen a silky murderess. They would always enforce Protocol.

302
They would never change. And yet she didn't want their blood on her hands.

The trumpet rang out again, urgent. \"I have to go,\" she said. \"The Queen is hunting and I
have to be there.\"

Evian nodded and turned away, but before he had taken two steps she forced the words
out. \"Wait. One thing.\"

The peach silk shimmered. A butterfly fluttered at his shoulder, curious.

\"My father. What about my father?\"


In the beautiful blue sky a flutter of pigeons rose from one of the Palace's thousand
towers. Evian did not turn and his voice was so quiet she barely heard it. \"He is
dangerous. He is implicated.\"

\"Don't hurt him.\"

\"Claudia ...\"

\"Don't.\" She clenched her fists. \"He is not to be killed. Promise me now. Swear. Or I go to
the Queen this minute and tell her everything.\"

That made him turn, startled. \"Y wouldn't...\"
                                ou

\"Y don't know me.\"
  ou

Iron-cold she faced him. Only her stubbornness would keep a knife out of her father's
heart. She knew he was her enemy, her subtle foe, her cold opponent over the
chessboard. But he was still her father.

Evian flashed a glance at Jared, then breathed out, a long uneasy breath. \"Very well.\"

303
\"Swear.\" She put her hand out and grabbed his and held it tight; it was hot and clammy.
\"With Jared as witness.\"

Reluctant, he let her raise their clasped fingers. Jared put his delicate hand on top.

\"I swear. As I am a lord of the Realm and a devotee of the Nine-Fingered One.\" Lord
Evian's small gray eyes were pale in the sunlight. \"The Warden of Incarceron will not be
killed.\"

She nodded. \"Thank you.\"

They watched him detach his hand and walk away, wiping his fingers fastidiously with a
silk handkerchief, disappearing down the greenness of the lime walk.

As soon as he was gone, Claudia sat on the grass and clutched her knees under the blue
dress. \"Oh, Master. What a mess.\"

Jared seemed barely to be listening. He shifted restlessly about, as if he was stiff. Then
he stopped so abruptly, she thought a bee had stung him. \"Who's the Nine-Fingered
One?\"


\"What?\"

\"That was what Evian said.\" He turned, and there was a tension in his dark eyes she
knew well, like the burning obsessions that sometimes kept him at his experiments for
days and nights. \"Have you ever heard of such a cult before?\"

Brutally, she shrugged. \"No. And I don't have time to care. Listen. Tonight, after the
banquet, the Queen holds a meeting of her Council, a great Synod, to prepare the deeds
of the wedding and the succession. They'll be there, Caspar and the

304
Warden and his secretary and anyone of importance. And they won't be able to leave.\"

\"Not you?\"

She shrugged. \"Who am I, Master? A pawn on the board.\" She laughed, the laugh she
knew he hated, hard and bitter. \"So that's when we go into Incarceron. And this time we
take no chances.\"

Jared nodded mildly. His face had fallen, but the edge of excitement still lingered.

\"I'm glad you said we, Claudia,\" he murmured.

She looked up. \"I'm afraid for you,\" she said simply. \"Whatever happens.\"

He nodded. \"That makes two of us.\" They were silent a moment. \"The Queen will be
waiting.\"

But she made no move to go, and when he looked at her, her face was taut and distant.
\"That girl Attia. She was jealous. She was jealous of me.\"

\"Y They may be close, Finn and his friends.\"
  es.

Claudia shrugged. She stood and brushed pollen from her dress. \"Well. We'll soon find
out.\"

Do you seek the key to Incarceron?

Look inside yourself. It has always been hidden there.

-- The Mirror of Dreams to Sapphique

***

The Sapient's tower was odd, Finn thought. He and Keiro and Attia had taken the man at
his word, and spent the day exploring all over it, and there were things about it that
puzzled them.

\"The food, for instance.\" Keiro picked a small green fruit from the bowl and sniffed it
cautiously. \"This is grown, but where? We re miles in the sky and there's no way down.
Don't tell me he takes his silver ship to market.\"

They knew there was no way down because the basement rooms where the beds were
had been built on the bare rock. Small stalagmites rose up between the furniture, icicles
of calcium hung from the ceiling, sediments laid down over the century and a half of the
Prison's life, though Finn had thought it took longer, millennia even, for such things to form.

As he wandered behind Attia from kitchen to storeroom to observatory he let himself slip
for a moment into a daydream of fascinating horror; that Incarceron was indeed a world,
ancient

306
and alive, that he was a microscopic creature inside it, tiny as a bacterium, and that
Claudia too was here, that even Sapphique was a dream dreamed by Prisoners who
could not face the dread of there being no Escape.

\"And then the books!\" Keiro thrust the door to the library open and gazed at them all in
disgust. \"Who needs so many books? Who could ever be bothered to read them?\"

Finn moved past him. Keiro could hardly read his own name, and was proud of it. He had
once gotten into a fight about some supposed insult about him scribbled on a wall by one
of Jormanric's bullies; Keiro had come out of the fight alive but badly beaten. Finn
remembered being unable to tell him that the graffiti was harmless, even grudgingly
admiring.

Finn could read. He had no idea who taught him, but he could read even better than
Gildas, who muttered the words half aloud and had only seen about a dozen books in his
life. The Sapient was here now, sitting at the desk in the library's heart, his knobbly hands


turning the pages of a great codex bound in leather, his eyes close to the handwritten text.

Around him, on shelves that reached to the shadowy ceiling, Blaize's library was
immense, towers of heavy volumes all numbered in gold and bound in green and maroon.

Gildas raised his head. They had expected him to be in awe, but his voice was acid.
\"Books? There are no books here, boy.\"

Keiro snorted. \"Y eyes are worse than you think.\"
                 our

Impatiently, the old man shook his head. \"These are useless.

307
Look at them. Names, numbers. They tell us nothing.\"

Attia took a book from the nearest shelf and opened it, and Finn looked over her
shoulder. It was thick with dust, and the edges of the pages were eaten away, so dry they
fell into flakes. On the page was a list of names:

MARCION

MASCUS

MASCUS ATTOR

MATTHEUS PRIME

MATTHEUS UMRA

each followed by a number. A long, eight-digit number. \"Prisoners?\" Finn said.

\"Apparently. Lists of names. Volumes of them. For every Wing, every Level, going back
centuries.\"

Beside each name was a small square image of a face. Attia touched one and almost
dropped the book. Finn gave a gasp, which brought Keiro over to the table, kneeling up
behind them.

\"Well, well,\" he said.

For each name a series of images blinked rapidly over the page, appearing and
disappearing in quick succession, until Attia touched one with her small fingertip and it


froze, opening into a full-length picture of a hunchbacked man in a yellow coat that filled
the page. When she let go, the pictures rippled again, hundreds of images of the same
man, in a street, traveling, talking by a fire, asleep, his whole life catalogued there, his

308
body growing gradually older before their eyes, bending, on a stick now, begging, leprous
with some terrible sickness. And then nothing.

Finn said quietly, \"The Eyes. They must record as well as watch.\"

\"So how has this Blaize got all this?\" Keiro raised his head in sudden shock. \"Do you
think I'm in here?\" Without waiting for an answer he crossed to the shelf marked found a
long ladder, and set it against the books, climbing easily up. He began to take the books
out and shove them back, impatient.

Attia had crossed to the A section and Gildas was busy reading, so Finn found the letter
F and looked for himself.

FIMENON

FIMMA

FIMMIA

FIMOS NEPOS

FINARA

His fingers shook as he turned the page, tracing down until he found it. FINN

He stared at it. There were sixteen Finns, but his was the last. The number was there, in
all its black familiarity, the number that had been on his overalls in the cell, that he had
learned by heart. Next to it was a small image, two triangles superimposed, one of them
inverted. A star. Feeling almost sick with anxiety, he touched it.

309
Images rippled. Himself crawling in the white tunnel. He stopped it instantly.

There he was, looking younger, cleaner, his face a mask of fear and tearful determination.
It hurt him to look at it. He tried to turn back, but this was the first image; there was nothing
before.


Nothing.

His heart thudded. He scrolled on slowly.

He and Keiro. Images of the Comitatus. Himself fighting, eating, sleeping. Once,
laughing. Growing, changing. Losing something. He almost thought he could see it going,
the ever-changing images showing himself becoming someone harder, watchful,
scowling, always there in the background of Keiro's quarrels and schemes. One image
showed him in a fit, and he gazed in horrified disgust at his curled, convulsed body, his
contorted face. Quickly he let the pictures run on, almost too fast to see, until he jabbed
down and held them still.

The ambush.

He saw himself frozen, half out of the chains, grabbing the Maestra's arm. She must have
just realized what a trap she was in; her face was caught in a strange, hurt, almost bruised
look, her smile already stiffening.

If there was more he didn't want to see it.

He slapped the book shut, the sound loud in the silent room, making Gildas grunt and
Attia look over.

\"Find anything?\" she said.

310
He shrugged. \"Nothing I didn't know. What about you?\" He noticed she had left the A
section and was up among the C's. \"Why there?\"

\"What Blaize said about no Outside. I thought I'd look up Claudia.\"

He went cold. \"And?\"

She was holding the book, a big green volume. She closed it quickly and turned, shoving
it back into the shelf. \"Nothing. He's wrong. She's not in Incarceron.\"

There was something subdued about her voice, but before he could think about it Keiro's
hiss of wrath jerked him around.

\"He's got everything about me in here! Everything!\"


Finn knew that Keiro had been orphaned as a baby and had grown up in the gang of filthy
urchins that always seemed to be hanging around the Comitatus; warriors' by-blows,
children of women they'd killed, kids who nobody knew. It would have been a tooth-and-
nail struggle to eat and survive and keep a face as unmarked as Keiro's in that ferocious
rabble. Maybe that was why his oathbrother looked so alarmed. He too closed the book
with a clap.

\"Forget your petty histories.\" Gildas looked up, his sharp face lit. \"Come and read a real
book. This is the journal of one Lord Calliston, the one they called the Steel Wolf. He is
said to have been the first Prisoner.\" He turned a page. \"It's all here, the Coming of the
Sapienti, the first convicts, the establishment of the New Order. They seem to have been
relatively

311
few, and they spoke to the Prison in those days as they spoke to each other.\"

Now he did sound awed.

They crowded around and saw that the book was smaller than the others and the text truly
handwritten, with some scratchy pen. Gildas tapped the page. \"The girl was right. They
set the Prison up as a place to dump all their problems, but there was a definite hope of
creating a perfect society. According to this we should have all been serene philosophers
long ago. Look here.\"

He read aloud, in his rasping voice.

\"Everything was prepared for, every eventuality covered. We have nutritious food, free
education, medical care better than Outside, now that the Protocol rules there. We
have the discipline of the Prison, that invisible being that watches and punishes and
rules.

\"And yet.

\"Things decay. Dissident groups are forming; territory is disputed. Marriages and feuds
develop. Already two Sapienti have led their followers away to live in isolation, claiming
they fear the murderers and thieves will never change, that a man has been killed, a
child attacked. Last week two men came to blows over a woman. The Prison
intervened. Since then neither of them has been seen.

\"I believe they are dead and that Incarceron has integrated them into its systems.
There was no provision for the death penalty, but the Prison is in charge now It is
                                                                             .
thinking for itself\"


312
In the silence Keiro said, \"Did they really think it would work?\"

After a moment Gildas turned the page. The whisper was loud in the stillness. \"It seems
so. He is not clear about what went wrong. Perhaps some unplanned element entered
and tipped the balance, by just a remark, a small act, so that the flaw in their perfect
ecosystem gradually grew and destroyed it. Perhaps Incarceron itself malfunctioned,
became a tyrant-- that certainly happened, but was it cause or effect? And then there's
this.\"

He pointed out the words as he read them, and Finn, leaning forward, saw that they were
underlined, the page grubby, as if someone else had fingered them over and over.

\"... or is it that man contains within himself the seeds of evil? That even if he is placed
in a paradise perfectly formed for him he will poison it, slowly, with his own jealousies
and desires? I fear it may be that we blame the Prison for our own corruption. And I do
not except myself, for I too am one who has killed and looked only to my own gain.\"

In the vast silent room only motes of dust fell through the slant of light from the roof.

Gildas closed the book. He looked up at Finn and his face was gray. \"We shouldn't stay
here,\" he said heavily. \"This is a place where dust gathers and doubt enters the heart. We
should go, Finn. This is not a refuge. It's a trap.\"

A footstep in dust made them look up. Blaize stood on

313
the gallery that circled the skylight, gazing down at them, his hands tight on the rail.

\"Y need rest,\" he said calmly. \"Besides, there is no way down from here. Until I decide
  ou
to take you.\"

***

CLAUDIA HAD been meticulous; scanners pre-placed in all the cellars, holo-images of
herself and Jared sleeping peacefully in their beds, a hefty bribe to the under-steward to
learn the duration of the debate, the number of clauses in the marriage treaty, the time it
would all take.

Finally she had seen Evian and told him to argue about anything. As long as her father


remained in the Great Chamber until well <<past midnight|13>>.

Slipping between the casks and barrels in her dark clothes, she felt like a shadow
released from the endless banquet upstairs, the polite banter, the Queen's red-lipped
cloying intimacies, the way she clutched at Claudia's hand and held it so tightly, thrilling
herself with how they would be so happy, the palaces they would build, the hunts, the
dances, the dresses. Caspar had glowered at her, drinking too much wine and escaping
as soon as he could to meet some serving girl. And her father, grave and poised in his
black frockcoat and gleaming boots, had caught her eye once down the long table, a swift
glance between the candles and flowers.

Did he guess she had some plan?

There was no time to fret now. As she ducked under a snag

314
of cobweb she straightened up into a tall figure and nearly screamed with shock.

He grabbed her. \"Sorry, Claudia.\"

Jared wore dark clothes too. She glared at him. \"God, you gave me a fright! Have you got
everything?\"

\"Yes.\" He was pale, his eyes dark-shadowed.

\"Y medication?\"
  our

\"Everything.\" He forced a wan smile. \"Anyone would think I was the pupil here.\"

She smiled back, wanting to cheer him. \"It will be all right. We have to look, Master. We
have to see Inside.\"

He nodded. \"Hurry then.\"

She led him through the vaulted halls. Tonight the bricks seemed damper than before, the
exhalations of the salted walls a fetid air that clouded their breathing.

The gate seemed higher, and as she came near to it, Claudia saw that the chains were
back across, each metal link thicker than her arm. But it was the snails that made her
shiver: fat, large creatures, their silvery trails crisscrossing the condensation on the metal
as if they had bred down here for centuries.


\"Yuck.\" She pulled one off; it came away with a soft plop and she threw it down. \"This is it.
He put a combination into the lock.\"

The Havaarna eagle spread wide wings. In the globe it held were seven small circular
hollows; she was about to touch them when Jared caught her fingers.

315
\"No! If the wrong combination goes in, alarms will go off. Or worse, we may be trapped.
This must be done carefully, Claudia\"

He pulled out the small scanner and began, very gently, to take readings and adjust them,
crouching among the rusted chains.

Impatient, she went back, checked the cellars, returned.

\"Hurry, Master.\"

'T can't hurry this.\" He was absorbed, his fingers moving gently.

After long minutes she was almost sick with impatience. She took the Key out, looked at
it behind his back. \"Do you think ...?\"

\"Wait, Claudia, lm almost certain of the first number.\"

It could take hours. There was a disc on the door; it gleamed greenish bronze, slightly
brighter than the surrounding metal. Over his head, she reached out and slid it aside.

A keyhole.

Shaped like the crystal, hexagonal.

She reached out and fitted the Key into it.

Instantly it leaped out of her fingers.

With a great crack that made her screech and made Jared jump back in terror, the Key
turned by itself. Chains crashed. Rust fell. The gate shuddered ajar.

Scrambling up, Jared was frantically checking all the alarms; he gasped, \"Claudia, that
was so stupid!\" but she didn't care,

316


she was laughing because it was open, the gate, the Prison. She had unlocked
Incarceron.

The last chain slid.

The cellars rang with echoes.

Jared waited until every last whisper of noise was stilled.

\"Well?\" she said.

\"No one coming. Everything up there is normal.\" He wiped sweat from his forehead with
one hand. \"We must be too far down for them to hear. More than we deserve, Claudia.\"

She shrugged. \"I deserve to find Finn. And he deserves to be free.\"

They stared at the dark slit, waiting. She half expected a crowd of Prisoners to burst
through.

But nothing happened, so she stepped forward and opened the gate.

And looked Inside.

317

***

I remember a story of a girl in Paradise who ate an apple once Some wise Sapient

gave it to her. Because of it she saw things differently. What had seemed gold coins
were dead leaves. Rich clothes were rags of cobweb. And she saw there was a wall
around the world, with a locked gate.

I am growing weak. The others are all dead. I have finished the key but no longer

dare to use it.

--Lord Calliston's Diary


***

It was impossible. She stood frozen, felt hope shatter inside her. She had expected dark
corridors, a maze of cells, stone passageways running with rats and damp. Not this.

Behind its oddly tilted entrance the white room was a perfect copy of her father's study. Its
machines hummed efficiently, its single desk and chair stood uncluttered in the strip of
light from the ceiling.

She let out a breath of despair. \"It's exactly the same!\"

Jared was scanning carefully. \"The Warden is a man of

318
meticulous tastes.\" He lowered the device and she saw from his face he was as stunned
as she was. \"Claudia, now the gate is open, I can tell you that there is no Prison below us,
no underground labyrinth. This room is all there is.\"

Appalled, she shook her head. Then she stepped in.

Immediately she felt the same effect as before; that peculiar blurring and clicking, the floor
seeming to even out under her feet, the walls to grow straighten Even the air seemed
different in the room, cooler and drier, not the damp exhalations of the cellars.

Turning back she watched Jared.

\"Now that was very strange,\" he said. \"That was a spatial shift. As I said before, as if the
room and the cellar are not quite ... adjacent.\"

He stepped in after her, and she saw how his dark eyes widened. But she was almost too
sick with disappointment to care.

\"Why make a copy of his study here?\" She stalked over and kicked the desk angrily. \"It
looks no more used than the other one!

Jared stared around, fascinated. \"Is it exactly the same?\"

\"In every single detail.\" She leaned on the desk and said the password Incarceron and
the drawer rolled open. Inside, as she'd expected, was a crystal Key the image of their
own. \"He keeps a Key at home and one here. But the Prison is somewhere else.\"

319


The bitterness in her voice made Jared give her a worried glance and then come to her
side. Quietly he said, \"Don't torment yourself...\"

\"I told Finn I'd found the way in!\" Disgusted, she turned and hugged her arms around
herself. \"And what do we do now? Tomorrow I'll be married to Caspar or executed for
treason.\"

\"Or you'll be Queen,\" he said.

She stared at him. \"Or Queen. After a bloodbath that will haunt me forever.\"

She walked away and glared at the humming silver machines. Behind her, she heard
Jared say, \"Well, at least...\"

He stopped.

When he didn't finish the sentence she turned, saw him bent over the open drawer with
the Key inside. Slowly he straightened and glanced at her sideways. When he spoke his
voice was hoarse with excitement.

\"It isn't a copy. It's the same room.\"

She stared.

\"Look, Claudia. Come and look.\"

The Key. It lay in the black velvet and he reached out and touched it, and to her utter shock
she saw how his fingers passed through the image onto the soft nap below. It was a holo-
image.

The holo-image she had put there.

She stepped back, looked around. Then quickly she dived and scrabbled around the legs
of the chair. \"If it's the same,

320
there was a ...\" She gasped, then jumped up with a mutter of bafflement. She held a very
tiny scrap of metal. \"This was lying just there before! But how? How can it be the same
room? That was at home. Miles away.\" She stared at the open door, the dim cellars of the
Palace beyond.


Jared seemed to have forgotten his fear. His narrow face was lit; he took the metal scrap
and looked at it closely, then slipped a small bag from his pocket and sealed the object
inside. He aimed the scanner at the chair. \"There's something strange just here. The
spatial rift seems stronger.\" He frowned in frustration. \"Ah, if only we had better
instruments, Claudia! If only the Sapienti had not been so hampered by Protocol all these
years!

\"Have you noticed,\" she said, \"how the chair is fixed to the floor?\"

She hadn't seen it before, but there were metal clasps to keep it in position. She walked
around it. \"And why here? It's too far from the desk. There's just that light above.\"

They stared up at it. A narrow, faintly blue light, falling on the chair and nothing else. Barely
bright enough to read by.

A cold thought chilled her. \"Master ... this is not a place of torture, is it?\"

He didn't answer at first, then she was grateful for his measured tone. \"I doubt it. There
are no restraints, no signs of violence. Do you think your father would need to use such
devices?\"

321
She didn't want to answer that. Instead she said, \"We've seen all we can. Let's get out.\" It
was <<past midnight|13>>. Her whole body was listening for footsteps.

He nodded, reluctant. \"And yet this room holds secrets, Claudia, that I would give worlds
to discover. Maybe it is a gateway. Maybe we are not seeing what is here.\"

\"Jared. That's enough.\"

She crossed to the gate and stepped through. The cellars were still and gloomy. All the
alarms were safely in place. And yet she was suddenly shaken by terrors; that dark
figures were watching, that Fax was there, that her father stood in the shadows where she
had stood, that the bronze gate would slam suddenly and trap Jared inside. She dragged
him out so quickly, he almost fell.

Taking the Key, she tugged it out of the keyhole, watched how instantly the gate folded
back with barely a clang, the chains linking themselves into place, the snails continuing
their relentless slimy progress over the worn wings of the eagle.

She was silent as she followed the Sapient's dark figure through the stacked barrels,
silenced by disappointment and bitter failure. What would Finn think of her now?


How Keiro would laugh in scorn and that girl would smirk. And for herself, a day of
freedom left.

At the top of the stairs she stopped Jared with a tug of his sleeve. \"We should go back
separately, Master. We shouldn't be seen together.\"

322
He nodded, and in the dark she thought he flushed a little. \"Y go first. Take care.\"
                                                              ou

She didn't move, her voice bleak. \"It's all over, isn't it? Everything's finished. Finn will rot in
that place forever.\"

Jared leaned back on the pillar and took a deep breath. \"Don't despair, Claudia.
Incarceron is near. I'm sure of that.\" He took something out of his pocket, and to her
surprise she saw it was the tiny flake of metal from the floor in its plastic wrapping.

\"What is that?\"

\"I have no idea. I'll use the Sapients' tower here and try a few investigations tomorrow.\"

\"Lucky you.\" She turned sourly. \"AH I have to try is my wedding dress.\"

She was gone before he could answer, slipping up the stairs into the candlelit corridors,
the <<midnight|13>> silences and whispers of the Palace.

Jared turned the tiny scrap between his fingertips.

He pushed back his damp hair and breathed out slowly.

For a moment the strangeness of the room had made him forget the pain. Now it came
back, worse, as if to punish him.

***

FOR HOURS they saw nothing of Blaize. He seemed to vanish, but Finn had no idea
where.

\"There's a part of this tower we haven't found yet,\" Keiro muttered, \"and that's the way
out.\" He sprawled on the bed

323


looking up at the white ceiling. \"And that guff about the books---I don't believe a word of
it.\"

Blaize had laughed off their questions about the Prison records. \"This tower was empty
and possibly made only for these books to be stored here,\" he had said, passing bread
across the table that evening. \"I found the place and liked it, so I moved in. I assure you I
have no idea how the images come to be stored here, and neither the time nor inclination
to look at them.\"

\"But you feel safe here,\" Gildas muttered.

\"I am safe. No one can reach me. I removed all the Eyes, and the Beetles can't get in. Of
course, Incarceron has many-ways of watching and I'm certainly under observation, as my
images appear in the book like everyone else's. But not at the moment, though, because
of the strange power of your Key. At the moment we are all invisible.\" He had smiled then,
rubbing the scabs on his chin. \"Now, if I had a device like that, I could learn much from it. I
suppose you wouldn't consider parting with it?\"

\"He wants it.\" Keiro sat up now, quickly. \"Y saw how he looked, when Gildas laughed at
                                            ou
him? There was a coldness in his face then, a flicker of something. He wants the Key.\"

Finn sat on the floor, knees up. \"He'll never get it.\"

\"Where is it?\"

\"Safe, brother.\" He tapped his coat.

\"Good.\" Keiro lounged back. \"And keep your sword with you. This scabby Sapient makes
me uneasy. I don't like him.\"

324
\"Attia says we're his prisoners.\"

\"That little bitch.\" But Keiro's remark was preoccupied; as Finn watched, he rolled off the
bed and stood, snatching a quick look at himself in the faceted window glass. \"But don't
fret, brother. Keiro has a plan.\"

He tugged his coat on and went out, peering cautiously around the door.

Alone, Finn pulled the Key out and looked at it. Attia was asleep and Gildas was
restlessly searching the books, as he seemed to have been doing since they came here.
Quietly Finn closed the door and put his back against it. Then he activated the Key.


It lit quickly.

He saw a chamber strewn with clothes, and there was light there that made his eyes sting
; sunlight through a window. Beyond the circle of the Key was a large, heavy wooden bed,
hangings, a wall of carved panels. Then, breathless, Claudia.

\"Y have to give me more warning! They could have seen you!
  ou

\"Who?\" he asked.

\"The maids, the seamstress. For God's sake, Finn!\"

She was red-faced, her hair tousled. He realized she was wearing a white dress, the
bodice elaborate with pearls and lace. A wedding dress.

For a moment he had no idea what to say. Then she sat next to him, crouched on the
rush-strewn floor. \"We failed.

325
We opened the gate, but it didn't lead to Incarceron, Finn. It was all a stupid mistake. All I
found was my father's study.\" She sounded disgusted with herself.

\"But your father is the Warden,\" he said slowly.

\"Whatever that means.\" She scowled.

He shook his head. \"I wish I could remember you, Claudia. Y Outside, all of it.\" He
                                                                   ou,
looked up. \"What if I'm not really Giles? That picture ... I don't look like that. I'm not that
boy.\"

\"Y were once.\" Her voice was stubborn; she squirmed to face him, the silk rustling.
  ou
\"Look, all I want is not to marry Caspar. Once you're rescued, once you're free, then our
engagement ... well, it doesn't have to happen, that's all. Attia was wrong; it's not just
about me being selfish.\" She smiled wryly. \"Where is she?\"

\"Asleep. I think.\"

\"She's fond of you.\"

He shrugged. \"We rescued her. She's grateful.\"


\"Is that what you call it?\" She stared ahead at nothing. \"Do people love each other in
Incarceron, Finn?\"

\"If they do, I haven't seen anything of it.\" But then he thought of the Maestra, and felt
ashamed. There was an awkward silence. Claudia could hear the maids chattering in the
next chamber; could see beyond Finn a small room with a frosty window, through which
glimmered a dim, artificial twilight.

326
And there was a smell. As she realized, she breathed in sharply, so that he looked at her.
A musty, unpleasant smell, metallic and sour, air that was trapped and recycled endlessly.
She scrambled to her knees. \"I can smell the Prison!\"

He stared. \"There is no smell. Besides, how--\"

\"I don't know, but I can!\"

She jumped up, ran out of his sight, came back with a tiny glass bottle that she uncorked
and sprayed lightly into the sunlight.

Minute drops shimmered in dust.

And Finn cried out, because the smell of it was rich and strong and it sliced into his
memory like a knife; he clasped his hands over his mouth and breathed it again and
again, closing his eyes, forcing himself to think.

Roses. A garden of yellow roses.

A knife in the cake and he was pushing down, cutting, and it was easy and he was
laughing. Crumbs on his fingers. The sweet taste.

\"Finn? Finn!\" Claudia's voice swayed him back from endless distance. The dryness was
in his mouth, the warning prickle crawling in his skin. He shuddered, forced himself to be
calm, breathe slower, let the sweat cool his forehead.

She was close to him. \"If you can smell it, the drops must be traveling to you, mustn't they?
Perhaps you can touch me now. Try, Finn.\"

Her hand was close. He put his own around it, closed his fingers.

327


They passed through hers and there was nothing, not a warmth, not a sensation. He sat
back, and they were silent.

Finally he said, \"I have to get out of here, Claudia.\"

\"And you will.\" She knelt up, her face fierce. \"I swear to you, I won't give up. If I have to go
to my father and beg him on my knees, I'll do it.\" She turned. \"Alys is calling. Wait for me.

The circle went dark.

He sat huddled there till he was stiff and the room was unbearably lonely; then he got up,
shoved the Key into his coat, and went out, running down the steps into the library, where
Gildas was pacing irritably forward and back, Blaize watching him across a table spread
with food. When he saw Finn, the thin Sapient stood.

\"Our last meal together,\" he said, spreading a hand.

Suspicious, Finn eyed him. \"Then what?\"

\"Then I take you all to a safe place and let you resume your journey.\"

\"Where's Keiro?\" Gildas snapped.

\"I don't know. So, you're just letting us go?\"

Blaize looked at him, his gray eyes calm. \"Of course. My aim was only ever to help you.
Gildas has persuaded me that you need to travel on.\"

\"And the Key?\"

\"I must do without it.\"

Attia was sitting at the table, her hands clasped together.

328
Catching Finn's eye, she shrugged slightly. Blaize rose. \"I will leave you to make your
plans. Enjoy your meal.\"

In the silence after he was gone Finn said, \"We misjudged him.\"

\"I still think he's dangerous. If he's a Sapient, why doesn't he cure that pox he has?\"


\"What do you know of the Sapienti, ignorant girl?\" Gildas growled.

Attia chewed her fingernail, then as Finn reached out for an apple, snatched it first, and
bit it. \"I taste your food,\" she said indistinctly. \"Remember?\"

He was angry. \"I'm not the Winglord. You're not my slave.\"

\"No, Finn.\" She leaned across the table. \"I'm your friend. That means a lot more.\"

Gildas sat down. \"Any news from Claudia?\"

\"They failed. The gate led nowhere.\"

\"As I thought.\" The old man nodded heavily. \"The girl is clever, but we must expect no help
from them. We must follow Sapphique alone. Now, there is a story that tells how ...\"

His hand reached to the fruit, but Finn grabbed it. His eyes were fixed on Attia; she half
rose, pale, and suddenly choking, the apple stalk dropping from her fingers. As he jerked
forward and caught her she crumpled, her fingers tearing at her throat.

\"The apple,\" she gasped. \"It's burning me!\"

329

***

You chose rashly. I've warned you before.

She is far too clever and you underestimate the Sapient.

--Queen Sia to the Warden; private letter

***

\"It's poisoned!\" Finn clambered over the table and grabbed her; she choked, clutching his
arms. \"Do something!\" Gildas shoved him aside. \"Get my bag of medicines. Hurry!\"

It took him precious seconds to find it, and by the time he got back Gildas had Attia lying
on her side, writhing in pain. The Sapient grabbed the bag and tore through it, then pulled
the cap off a small vial and held it to her lips. Attia struggled.


\"She's choking,\" Finn muttered, but Gildas only swore, forcing it on her so that she drank
it and coughed and convulsed.

Then, with a horrible racking sound she was sick.

\"Good,\" Gildas said quietly. \"That's it.\" He held her tight, his quick fingers feeling her
pulse, the clammy skin of her forehead. She was sick again, and then slumped back, her
face white and mottled.

\"Is it out? Is she all right?\"

But Gildas was still frowning. \"Too cold,\" he muttered. \"Get

330
a blanket.\" Then, \"Close the door and guard it. If Blaize comes, keep him out.\"

\"Why would he...?\"

\"The Key, fool boy. He wants the Key. Who else would have done this?\"

Attia moaned. She was shivering now, a strange blueness on her lips and under her eyes.
He obeyed, slamming the heavy door.

\"Is it out of her?\"

\"I don't know. I don't think so. It might have entered the bloodstream almost immediately.\"

Finn stared at him in dismay. Gildas knew about poisons; the women of the Comitatus
had been experts, and Gildas had not been above learning from them.

\"What else can we do?\"

\"Nothing.\"

The door shuddered; it hit Finn on the shoulder and he turned, drawing the sword with one
fierce slash. Keiro stood still

\"What's ...?\" His quick eyes took in the scene. He said,

\"Poison?\"


\"Some corrosive.\" Gildas watched the girl retching and squirming. He stood slowly,
resigned. \"There is nothing I can do.\"

\"There has to be!\" Finn shoved him aside. \"I could have eaten that! It could have been
me!\" He knelt down next to her, trying to lift her, make her easier, but her mutters of pain

331
made him stop. He felt angry and helpless. \"We have to do something!\"

Gildas crouched by him. His harsh words cut through the moans. \"It's acidic, Finn. Her
internal system may be already burned, her lips, her throat. It will be over very soon.\"

Finn looked at Keiro.

\"We go,\" his brother said. \"Right now. I've found where he keeps the ship.\"

\"Not without her.\"

\"She's dying.\" Gildas forced him to look. \"Nothing can be done. It would take a miracle
and I don't have one.\"

\"So we save ourselves?\"

\"That's what she'd want.\"

They had hold of him, but he shrugged them off and knelt by her. She was still and
seemed to be barely breathing, the faded bruises clear in her skin. He had seen death,
he was used to death, but his whole soul revolted against this, and the shame he had felt
at the Maestra's betrayal came back and swept over him like heat, as if it would
overwhelm him. He choked back words, knew tears were filling his eyes.

If it would take a miracle, Attia would get one.

He leaped up and turned to Keiro, grabbing at his hands. \"A ring. Give me another of the
rings.\"

\"Now wait a minute.\" Keiro jerked back.

\"Give it to me!\" His voice was a rasp; he raised the sword. \"Don't make me use this,
Keiro. Y still have one left.\"
        ou'll

332


Keiro was calm. His blue eyes gave one glance at Attia as she curled in agony. Then he
stared back. \"Y think it will work?\"
               ou

\"I don't know! But we can try.\"

\"She's a girl. She's no one.\"

\"One each, you said. I'm giving her mine.\"

\"You've had yours already.\"

For a moment they faced each other, Gildas watching. Then Keiro tugged one of the rings
over his knuckles and looked down at it. Wordless, he threw it at Finn.

Finn caught it, dropped the sword, and grabbed Attia's fingers, pushing the ring on; it was
far too big for her, so he held it there, praying under his breath, to Sapphique, to the man
whose life was in the ring, to anyone. Gildas crouched beside him, deeply cynical.

\"Nothing's happening. What should happen?\"

The Sapient scowled. \"This is superstition. Y yourself scorned it.\"
                                             ou

\"Her breathing. It's slowing.\"

Gildas felt her pulse, touched the dirty scars where the chains had been. \"Finn. Accept it.
There's no ...\" He stopped. His fingers tightened, felt again.

\"What? What--\"

\"I thought... The pulse seems stronger ...\"

Keiro said, \"Then pick her up! Bring her. But let's go!\"

Finn threw him the sword, crouched, and picked Attia up.

333
She was so light, he could carry her easily, though her head lolled against him. Keiro
already had the door open and was looking out. \"This way. Keep quiet.\"

He led them out.


They ran up a dusty winding stair to a trapdoor; Keiro flung it back and hauled himself into
darkness, dragging Gildas quickly after him. \"The girl.\"

Finn passed her up. Then he looked back.

In the stairwell a strange hum seemed to ripple the air. It rose ominously toward him and
he climbed hastily, scrambling up and slamming the trapdoor down. Keiro was wrestling
with a grid on the wall, Gildas grasping it with his knotted hands.

Attia's eyes flickered, then opened.

Finn stared. \"Y should be dead.\"
               ou

She shook her head, speechless.

The grid came off the wall with a rattling crash; behind it he saw a great dark hall, and in
the center, tethered to the floor by an iron cable, the silver ship, floating free. They ran,
Finn with Attia's arm over his shoulder, tiny figures over the smooth gray floor, vulnerable
and exposed, like mice under the wide stare of an owl, because in the roof above them a
great screen lit, and as Finn stared up it showed him an eye. Not the tiny red Eyes he
knew, but a human eye, gray-irised, magnified enormously, as if it stared into a powerful
microscope.

Then the ripple in the air came through the floor and threw

334
them all off their feet, a Prisonquake that made the thin needle of the Sapient's tower
vibrate to its top.

Keiro rolled and leaped up. \"Over here.\"

A shimmering rope ladder hung down. Gildas grasped it and began to climb, swaying
awkwardly, though Keiro held the end firmly.

Finn said, \"Can you get up there?\"

\"I think so.\" Attia pushed hair from her face. She was still deathly pale, but the blueness
was ebbing. She seemed to be able to breathe.

He looked down at her finger.

The ring was shrunken. A thin brittle hoop, it fractured as she grasped the rope; tiny


fragments fell unnoticed. Finn touched one with his foot. It looked like bone. Ancient, dried
bone.

Behind them, the trapdoor clanged open. Finn whirled; he felt Keiro hand him back the
sword and draw his own.

Together, they faced the dark square of blackness.

***

\"AND SO everything is ready for tomorrow.\" The Queen placed the last of the papers on
the red leather desk and sat back, putting her fingertips together. \"The Warden has been
so generous. Such a dowry, Claudia. Whole estates, a coffer of jewels, twelve black
horses. He must love you very much.\"

Her nails were painted with gold. It was probably real,

335
Claudia thought. She picked up one of the deeds and glanced over it, but all she was
aware of was Caspar, striding up and down on the creaking wooden floor.

Queen Sia looked around. \"Caspar. Be quiet.\"

\"I'm bored rigid.\"

\"Then go riding, dear. Or badger-baiting, or whatever it is you do.\"

He turned. \"Right. Good idea. See you, Claudia.\"

The Queen raised a perfect eyebrow. \"Hardly the way the Heir speaks to his fianc\x{fffd}e, my
lord.\"

Halfway to the door he stopped and came back. \"Protocol is for the serfs, Mother. Not
us.\"

\"Protocol keeps us in power, Caspar. Don't forget that.\"

He grinned and made a low and elaborate bow to Claudia, then kissed her hand. \"See
you at the altar, Claudia.\" She stood and curtsied coldly.

\"Right. Now I'm off.\"


He slammed the door and they could hear the thud of his boots down the corridor.

The Queen leaned across the table. \"Fm so glad we have this little time alone, Claudia,
because I have something to say. I know you won't mind it, my dear.\"

Claudia tried not to frown, but her lips tightened. She wanted to get away, find Jared. They
had so little time!

\"I have changed my mind. I have asked Master Jared to leave the Court.\"

336
\"No!\"

It was said before she could stop herself.

\"Y dear. After the wedding, he will return to the Academy.\"
  es,

\"Y have no right...\" Claudia was on her feet.
  ou

\"I have every right.\" The Queen's smile was sweet and deadly. She leaned forward. \"Let
us understand each other, Claudia. There is only one Queen here. I will teach you, but I will
not tolerate any rival. And you and I need to understand this, because we are alike,
Claudia. Men are weak; even your father can be ruled, but you have been brought up to
be my successor. Wait your time. Y can learn a lot from me.\" She leaned back, her
                                    ou
fingers tapping the papers. \"Sit down, my dear.\"

There was steely threat in the words. Claudia sat slowly. \"Jared is my friend.\"

\"From now on, I will be your friend. I have many spies, Claudia. They tell me much. It really
will be for the best.\"

She stretched out and pulled the bell; a servant came in instantly, in powdered wig and
livery. \"Tell the Warden I await him.\"

When he had gone she opened a box of sweetmeats and took a moment to select one,
then offered them to Claudia with a smile.

Numb, Claudia shook her head. She felt as if she had picked up a pretty flower and found
it rotting away inside, crawling with maggots. She realized she had never seriously
thought of Sia as the danger. Her father had always been the one to fear. Now she
wondered how wrong she was.


337
Sia watched her, her red lips in a small smile. She wiped them with a lace-edged
kerchief. And as the doors were flung open, she leaned back in the chair and dangled her
arm over the side. \"My dear Warden. What kept you?\"

He was flushed.

Claudia noticed it at once, through the whirl of her dismay. He never hurried, yet now his
hair was just a little askew, his dark coat unbuttoned at the top.

He bowed gravely, but his voice had an edge of breathlessness. \"I'm sorry, ma'am.
Something that required my attention.\"


***

NOTHING CAME through the trapdoor.

Finn said, \"Get up the ladder.\"

As Keiro turned, the floor rippled again. Finn stared at it. The quake lifted the flagstones
as if a wave of water roared under them. Before he had rime to move, the whole world
shifted. He fell crashing against the floor, then was rolling downhill, down a slope that
should not be there. Slamming against a pillar he gasped, pain shooting down his side.

The hall was tilting.

With sickening certainty he thought that the Sapient's tower was falling, that it had been
fractured at its spindly base. Then the rope ladder brushed him and he grabbed it. Keiro
was already on board, leaning over the silver timbers of the deck. Finn scrambled up; as
soon as he could reach, they linked hands.

338
\"I've got him. GO!\"

The ship rose. With a howl of fear Finn slid onto the deck; the whole contraption swung
and rocked and then it drifted, ropes snapping one by one below it.

There was an opening in the tower wall ahead, the wide shelf where Blaize had landed
the craft. But as Gildas hauled with all his wiry strength to spin the spoked wheel, the ship
jerked and they all fell, rubble cascading from above onto the deck and sails.

\"Something's holding us down!\" he roared.

Keiro hung over the side. \"God! There's an anchor!\"

He clambered back. \"There must be a winch. Come on!\"

They opened a hatch and scrambled down into the darkness under the deck. Thuds of
falling brickwork crashed overhead.

They found a maze of walkways and galleys . Running down and flinging the doors open,
Finn saw each cabin was empty; there were no stores, no cargo, no crew. Before he had
time to think about it, Keiro yelled from the darkness below.

In the lowest deck it was dark. A circular capstan filled the space; Keiro was jamming the


bar into place. \"Help me.\"

Together, they pushed. Nothing moved; the mechanism was stiff, the anchor chain heavy.

Again they heaved, Finn feeling his back muscles crack, and slowly, with a long reluctant
groan, the capstan creaked into motion.

339
Finn gritted his teeth and heaved again, sweat breaking out on his face; beside him he
heard Keiro gasp and grunt.

Then another body was there. Attia, still pale, laboring on the bar next to him.

\"What... good ... are you?\" Keiro growled.

\"Good enough,\" she snapped back, and Finn saw to his surprise that she was grinning,
her eyes bright under the tangled hair, color back in her face.

The anchor juddered. The ship swayed, then abruptly, lifted.

\"We've got it!\" Keiro dug his heels in and pushed, and quite suddenly the capstan was
turning quickly under their weight, the great chain of the anchor rasping up through the
floor and looping obediently as they forced it around.

When they had it all in and the mechanism ground to a stop Finn raced up the steps of the
companionway, but as he burst out onto the deck he stopped with a yell of fright.

They were sailing in a cloud. It wisped around him, opening to give glimpses of Gildas
swearing at the wheel, the great billowing sails, a bird below them in a patch of light.

\"Where are we?\" Attia muttered behind him.

Then the ship dropped out of the mist, and they saw they were in an ocean of blue air, the
tilted tower of the Sapient already far behind.

Breathless, Keiro leaned on the rail and whooped with delight.

340
Finn stood next to him, looking back. \"Why didn't he try to stop us?\" Reaching into his
jacket, he touched the crystal sharpness of the Key.


\"Who bloody cares!\" his oathbrother said.

And then he turned and punched Finn hard in the stomach.

Attia screamed. Finn collapsed, all breath gone, the pain an amazement inside him, an
airless blackness that loomed over his sight.

From the wheel Gildas yelled something, his words snatched away.

Slowly, the agony ebbed. When Finn could gasp in air he looked up and saw Keiro with
both arms spread on the rail, looking down at him with a grin.

\"What...?\"

Keiro held out a hand and pulled him up, staggering, face-to-face. \"That'll teach you not to
draw a sword on me again,\" he said.

341

Sapphique strapped the wings to his arms and flew over oceans and plains, over glass
                                                 ,

cities and mountains of gold. Animals fled; people pointed up. He flew so far, he saw
the sky above him and the sky said, \"Turn back, my son, for you have climbed too
high\"

Sapphique laughed, as he rarely did. \"Not this time. This time I beat on you until you

open.\"

But Incarceron was angered, and struck him down.

---Legends of Sapphique

***

\"She's said that Jared has to leave.\" She turned and glared at her father, wanting to ask if
it was his doing. \"I told you. It was bound to happen.\" The Warden walked past her and
sat on the chaise near the window of his room, gazing out at the pleasure gardens, where


parties of courtiers walked in the evening cool. \"I think you will have to comply, my dear.
It's a small price to pay to gain a kingdom.\"

She was ready to burst out in temper, but he turned and looked at her, that cold
measuring look she so dreaded.

\"Besides, we have something more important to discuss. Come and sit down.\"

342
She didn't want to. But she crossed to the chair by the gilt table and sat.

He glanced at his watch, then clicked the lid shut and kept it in his hand.

He said quietly, \"Y have something that belongs to me.\"
                   ou

She felt her skin prickle with danger. For a moment she thought she couldn't speak at all,
but then her voice came, surprisingly calm.

\"Do I? What could that be?\"

He smiled. \"Y are truly remarkable, Claudia. Even though I've created you, you always
             ou
surprise me. But I've warned you before about pushing me too far.\" He put the watch in his
pocket and leaned forward. \"Y have my Key.\"
                              ou

She drew in a breath of dismay. He leaned back, crossing one leg over another, the
leather of his boots gleaming. \"Y Y don't deny it, and that's wise. It was ingenious to
                                  es. ou
place an image of the Key in the drawer, quite ingenious. I suppose I have Jared to thank
for that. When I checked my study that day the alarms went off, I rolled the drawer open
and glanced inside; I didn't think to pick up the Key. And the ladybugs-- what a creative
touch What a fool you must both have thought me.

She shook her head, but he stood abruptly and paced to the windows. \"Did you talk about
me with Jared, Claudia? Did you laugh together because you had stolen it from me? I'm
sure you must have enjoyed that.\"

343
\"I cook it because I had to.\" She clutched her hands together. \"Y kept it from me. Y
                                                                 ou                 ou
never told me.\"

He stopped and looked at her. He had smoothed his hair back now, and his gaze was as
calm and considering as ever. \"About what?\"


She stood up slowly, and faced him. \"About Giles,\" she said.

She had expected astonishment, a moment's startled silence. But he was not at all
surprised. She knew, with sudden certainty, that he had been waiting for that name, that
by saying it she had fallen into some trap.

He said, \"Giles is dead.\"

\"No he isn't.\" The jewels around her neck tickled; with a sudden fury, she tugged them off
and flung them on the floor, then folded her arms and all the pent-up words burst out of her.
\"His death was faked. Y and the Queen faked it. Giles is in Incarceron, locked away.
                         ou
Y took his memory so he doesn't even know who he is. How could you do that?\" She
 ou
kicked a footstool aside; it fell and rolled. \"I can understand why she did it, why she
wanted her useless son to be King, but you! I was already engaged to Giles. Y            our
precious plan would have worked out anyway. Why did you do that to us?\"

He raised an eyebrow. \"Us?\"

\"Don't I count? Didn't the fact that I would end up with Caspar mean anything to you? Did
you ever think about me?\" She was trembling. All the anger of her life was coming out,

344
frustration for all the times he had driven away and left her for months, had smiled down at
her and not touched her.

He rubbed his stubbly beard with thumb and forefinger. \"I did think of you.\" His voice was
quiet. \"It was obvious you liked Giles. But he was a stubborn boy, too kind, too honorable.
Caspar is a fool and will make a poor King. Y will be able to rule him far more
                                                    ou
effectively.\"

\"That's not the reason you did it.\"

He looked away. She saw his fingers tapping on the fireplace. He picked up a dainty
china figurine and examined it, then put it down. \"You're right.\"

He was silent ; she wanted him to speak so much, she could have screamed. It seemed
an age before he went back to the chair and sat and said calmly, \"I'm afraid the real
reason is a secret you will never learn from me.\"

Seeing her astonishment, he raised his hand. \"I know you despise me, Claudia. I'm sure
you and your Sapient think me a monster. But you are my daughter and I have always
acted in your interests. Besides, Giles's imprisonment was the Queen's plan, not mine.


She forced me to agree.\"

She snorted in scorn. \"Forced! She has power over you!\"

He whipped his head up and hissed, \"Y And so do you.\"
                                     es.

For a second the venom in his voice stung her. \"Me?\"

His hands were fists on the wooden armrests. He said, \"Let it go, Claudia. Let it be. Don't
ask, because the answer may destroy you. That's all I'm going to say.\" He stood, tall and

345
dark, and his voice was bleak. \"Now, about the Key. Nothing you have done with it has
escaped me. I know about your search for Bartlett, about your communication with
Incarceron. I know about this Prisoner you believe is Giles.\"

She stared in amazement and he laughed his dry laugh. \"There are a thousand million
Prisoners in Incarceron, Claudia, and you believe you've found the right one? Time and
space are different there. This boy could be anyone.\"

\"He has a birthmark.\"

\"Does he now! Let me tell you something about the Prison.\" His voice cruel now, he came
up to her and stared down at her. \"It's a closed system. Nothing enters. Nothing leaves.
When Prisoners die their atoms are reused, their skin, their organs. They are made from
each other. Repaired, recycled, and when the organic tissues are not available, they are
patched with metal and plastic. Finn's eagle means nothing. It may not even be his. The
memories he thinks he sees may not be his.\"

Horrified, she wanted to stop him, but no words would come. \"The boy is a thief and a
liar.\" He went on, remorseless. \"One of a gang of cutthroats that preyed on others. I
suppose he's told you that?\"

\"Yes,\" she snapped.

\"How very honest. Has he told you that in order to get his copy of the Key an innocent
woman was thrown to her death down a precipice? After he had promised her she was
safe?\"

She was silent.

346


\"No,\" he said. \"I thought not.\" He stood back. \"I want all this nonsense to cease. I want the
Key. Now.\" She shook her head.

\"Now, Claudia.\"

\"I haven't got it,\" she whispered.

\"Then Jared--\"

\"Leave Jared out of this!\"

He caught hold of her. His hand was cold and he gripped her wrist like iron. \"I want the
Key or you will regret defying me.\"

She tried to shake him off, but he held tight. She glared at him through her tumbling hair.
\"Y can't hurt me. I'm all you've got to make your plan work and you know it!\"
  ou

For a moment they stared at each other. Then he nodded, and let her go. A white circle of
bloodless skin looped her wrist like the mark of a manacle.

\"I can't hurt you,\" he said hoarsely.

Her eyes widened.

\"But there is this Finn. And there is Jared.\"

She stepped back. She was shaking, her back cold with sweat. For a moment they
looked at each other. Then, not trusting herself to speak, she turned and ran to the door,
but his words caught her there and she had to hear them.

\"There is no way out of the Prison. Bring me the Key, Claudia.\"

She slammed the door behind her. A passing servant stared in surprise. In the mirror
opposite Claudia saw why;

347
her reflection showed a tousled, red-faced creature, scowling with unhappiness. She
wanted to howl with rage. Instead she walked to her room and closed the door, and threw
herself on the bed.

She thumped the pillow and buried her head in it, curling up small, arms hugging her


body. Her mind was a maze of confusion, but as she moved, paper crinkled on the pillow
and she raised her head and saw the note pinned there. It was from Jared. I need to see
you. I've discovered something incredible.

As soon as she'd read it, it dissolved to ash.

She couldn't even smile.

***

PERCHED IN the rigging of the ship, Finn held on tight, seeing far below lakes of
sulfurous yellow liquid, viscous and evil-smelling. On the landscape slopes, animals
grazed, odd gawky creatures from here, the herd splitting and fleeing in terror as the
shadow of the ship fell on them. Beyond were more lakes, small scrubby bushes the only
things that grew near them, and away to the right a desert stretched as far as he could
see into the shadows.

They had been sailing for hours. Gildas had steered first, at random, high and steady until
he had yelled irritably for someone to relieve him and Finn had taken a turn, feeling the
strangeness of the craft below, its buffeting by drafts and breezes. Above him the sails
had flapped; the winds catching and sloughing the white canvas. Twice he had sailed the
ship

348
through cloud. The second time the temperature had dropped alarmingly and by the time
they had emerged from the tingling grayness, the wheel and deck around him had been
frosted with needles of ice that fell and clattered on the boards.

Attia had brought him water. \"Plenty of this,\" she'd said, \"but no food.\"

\"What, nothing?\"

\"No.\"

\"What did he live on?\"

\"There's only some scraps Gildas has.\" As he'd drunk, she'd taken the wheel, her small
hands on the thick spokes. She'd said, \"He told me about the ring.\"

Finn wiped his mouth.

\"It was too much to do for me. I owe you even more now.\"


He'd felt proud and grumpy both at once; he'd taken the wheel back and said, \"We stick
together. Besides, I didn't think it would work.\"

\"I'm amazed Keiro gave it.\"

Finn shrugged. She was watching closely. But then she had looked into the sky. \"Look at
this! This is so wonderful. All my life I lived in a little dark tunnel lined with shanties and
now all this space ...\"

He said, \"Do you have any family?\"

\"Brothers and sisters. All older.\"

\"Parents?\"

\"No.\" She shook her head. \"Y know ...\"
                            ou

349
He knew. Life in the Prison was short and unpredictable.

\"Do you miss them?\"

She was still, gripping the wheel tight. \"Y But ... She smiled. \"It's odd how things work

out. When I was captured, I thought it was the end of my life. Bur instead it led to this.\"

He'd nodded, then said, \"Do you think the ring saved you? Or was it Gildas's emetic?\"

\"The ring,\" she said firmly. \"And you.\"

He hadn't been so sure.

Now, looking down at Keiro lazing on the deck, he grinned. Called to take his turn, his
oathbrother had taken one look at the great wheel and gone below for some rope; then
he'd lashed it and seated himself next to it, feet up. \"What can we possibly hit?\" he'd said
to Gildas.

\"Y fool,\" the Sapient had snarled. \"Just keep your eyes open, that's all.\"
  ou

They had passed over hills of copper and mountains of glass, whole forests of metal
trees. Finn had seen settlements cut off in impenetrable valleys where the inhabitants
lived in isolation; great towns; once a castle with flags flying from its turrets. That had


scared him, thinking of Claudia. Rainbows of spray arched over them; they had flown
through strange atmospheric effects, a reflected island, patches of heat, flickering blurs of
purple and gold fire. An hour ago a flock of long-tailed birds had suddenly squawked and
circled and dive-bombed the deck, making Keiro duck. Then just as

350
suddenly they had vanished, a mere drift of dimness on the horizon. Once, the ship had
drifted very low; Finn had leaned out over mile on mile of stinking hovels, the people
running from haphazard dwellings of tin and wood, lame and diseased, their children
listless. He had been glad when the wind had lifted the ship away. Incarceron was a hell.
And yet he possessed its Key.

He took it out and touched the controls. He'd tried it before, but nothing had happened.
Nothing happened now either, and he wondered if it would ever work again. But it was
warm. Did that mean they were traveling in the right direction, toward Claudia? But if
Incarceron was so vast, how many lifetimes might it take to travel to the exit?

\"Finn!\"

Keiro's yell was sharp. He looked up.

Ahead, something flickered. He thought at first it was the lights; then he saw that the
dimness was not the usual gloom of the Prison but a dark bank of storm clouds, right
across their path. He scrambled down, rasping his palms to heat on the cables.

Keiro was hastily untying the wheel.

\"What is that?\"

\"Weather.\"

It was black. Lightning flickered inside it. And as they sailed closer, thunder, a low rumble,
an amused, dark chuckle. \"The Prison,\" he whispered. \"It's found us.\"

\"Get Gildas,\" Keiro muttered.

351
He found the Sapient below, poring over charts and maps under the creaking lamp. \"Look
at these.\" The old man glanced up, his lined face shadowed in the lamplight.

\"How can it be this vast? How can we hope to follow Sapphique through all this?\"


Appalled, Finn stared at the heap of charts slithering off the table, covering the floor. If
these showed the extent of Incarceron, they could journey through it forever. \"We need
you. There's a storm ahead.\"

Attia ran in. \"Keiro says hurry.\"

As if in response the ship heeled over. Finn grabbed the table as the charts slid and
rolled. Then he climbed back up on deck.

Black clouds reared up over the masts, the silver pennants flapping and snapping. The
ship was almost lying on her side; he had to hang on to the rail and scramble across to
the wheel by grabbing anything within reach.

Keiro was sweating and swearing. \"This is the Sapient's sorcery!\" he yelled.

\"I don't think so. It's Incarceron.\"

The thunder rumbled again. With a scream the gale hit them; they both held the wheel and
hung on, crouching behind its meager shelter. Objects flapped against them, shards of
metal, leaves, fragments of debris rebounding like hail. And then a snow of tiny white grit,
ground glass, bolts, stones that tore through the sails.

352
Finn turned.

He saw Gildas lying flat behind the main mast, clinging on, one arm around Attia. \"Stay
there!\" he yelled.

\"The Key!\" Gildas's yell was snatched away by the wind. \"Let me take it below. If you're
lost...\"

He knew. And yet he hated the thought of parting with it.

\"Do it,\" Keiro growled without turning.

Finn let go of the wheel.

Instantly he was flung back, buffeted, tumbling, over the deck. And the Prison swooped.
He felt it zoom in on him, and rolling over, he screamed in terror.

From the heart of the storm, an eagle plummeted from the sky, black as thunder, its talons
crackling with lightning. It stretched out for the Key, ready to snatch him and it.


Finn threw himself to one side. A tangle of ropes slammed into him; he grabbed the
nearest and whipped it up, whirling it around, the heavy tarred end so close to the bird's
breast that it swerved and swept past, flying high to turn and swoop again.

He dived past Gildas into the shelter of the deck. \"It's coming back!\" Attia screamed.

\"It wants the Key.\" Gildas ducked. Rain lashed them; thunder rumbled again, and this time
it was a great voice, a murmur of anger far away and high above.

The eagle dived. Keiro, exposed by the wheel, curled up small. They saw how it circled
and screeched angrily, its beak

353
wide. Then, quite suddenly, it turned to the east and flew away.

Finn tugged out the Key. He touched it and instantly Claudia was there, wet-eyed, her hair
rumpled, \"Finn,\" she said, \"Listen to me. Eve--\"

\"Y listen,\" He grabbed tight as the ship rolled and swayed. \"We need help, Claudia. Y
  ou                                                                                 ou
have to speak to your father. Y have to get him to stop the storm or we'll all die!\"
                               ou

\"Storm?\" She shook her head. \"He's not ... He won't help. He wants you dead. He's found
out everything, Finn. He knows!\"

\"Then--\"

Keiro yelled. Finn looked up and what he saw made his fingers clutch on the Key, so that
seconds before the image flicked off, Claudia saw it too.

A great solid metal wall. The Wall at the End of the World.

Rising from unknown depths it soared into the hidden reaches of the sky.

And they were heading straight for it.

***

It was late; the bell in the Ebony Tower was chiming <<ten|11>>. In the summer dusk, moths flitted
in the gardens and a distant peacock cried as Claudia hurried down the cloister. Servants
passed her and struggled to bow, loaded down with chairs and tapestries and great
haunches of venison. The whole bustle of the feast preparations had been under way for
hours. She frowned, annoyed, not daring to ask one of them where Jared's room was.

But he was waiting.

As she turned a dank corner by a fountain of four stone swans, his hand came out and
clutched her. Tugged through an archway she stood breathless as he closed the oaken
door almost shut and put his eye to the slit.

A figure strode past. She thought she recognized her father's secretary.

\"Medlicote. Is he following me?\"

Jared put a finger to his lips. He looked paler and more drawn

355
than usual, and there was a nervous energy about him that worried her. He led her down
some stone steps, across a neglected courtyard, into a pathway overarched with yellow
hanging laburnum. Halfway down he paused and whispered, \"There's a folly down here
I've been using. My room is bugged.\"

A great moon hung over the Palace. The scars of the Y    ears of Rage pockmarked its face;
its silvery sheen lit the orchard and glasshouses, reflected on diamond-paned casements
that hung open in the heat. A small burst of music drifted from a room, with voices and
laughter and the chink of plates. Jared's dark figure slipped between two pillars where
stone bears danced, through bushes that smelled of lavender and lemon balm, to a small
structure built into a wall, in the most neglected corner of the walled garden. Claudia
glimpsed a turret, a ruined parapet overgrown with ivy.


He unlocked the door and ushered her in.

It was black, and stank of damp soil. Light flickered over her; Jared had a small torch; he
pointed it at an inner door.

\"Quickly.\"

The door was mildewed with age, the wood so soft it crumbled. Inside the dim room, the
windows had been blocked with ivy; as Jared lit lamps, Claudia stared around. \"Just like
home.\" He had set up his electron microscope on a rickety table, unpacked a few boxes
of instruments and books.

He turned; in the flame light his face was haggard. \"Claudia, you must look at this. It
changes everything. Everything.\"

356
His anguish scared her. \"Calm down,\" she said quietly. \"Are you well?\"

\"Well enough.\" He leaned over the microscope, his long fingers adjusting it deftly. Then he
stepped back. \"Y remember that scrap of metal I took from the study? Take a look at it.\"
                ou

Puzzled, she put her eye to the lens. The image was blurred; she refocused very slightly.
And then she went very still, so rigid that Jared knew she had seen, and in that instant,
had understood.

He went and sat wearily on the floor, among the ivy and nettles, the Sapient robe wrapped
around him, its hem trailing in the dirt. And he watched her as she stared.

***

IT WAS the Wall at the End of the World.

If Sapphique had truly fallen down it from top to bottom, h must have taken years. As Finn
gazed up he felt the wind rebound from its immensity, making a slipstream that roared
before them. Debris from the heart of Incarceron was blasted upward and then
plummeted in an endless maelstrom; once trapped in that wind nothing would escape.

\"We need to turn!\" Gildas was staggering to the wheel; Finn scrambled after him.
Together they squeezed beside Keiro, hauling, trying to make the ship veer before she
struck the updraft.

With the thunder, Lightsout came.


In the blackness Finn heard Keiro swear, felt Gildas

357
struggle around him, holding on tight. \"Finn. Pull the lever! In the deck.\"

His hand groped, found it, and he tugged.

Lights blinked on, two beams of light horizontal from the bow of the ship. He saw how
close the Wall was. The discs of light played on huge rivets, bigger than houses, the
bolted panels immense, battered by the impact of fragments, immeasurably cracked and
scarred and corroded.

\"Can we back out?\" Keiro yelled.

Gildas threw him a glance of scorn. And in that instant they fell. Plunging down, spilling
beams and spars and ropes, the ship dropped down the side of the Wall like a great
silvery angel, the sails its flailing wings, shredding in seconds, until just as they thought
she would break, the slipstream caught them. Mast snapping, the silver craft shot upward
again, spinning uncontrollably, the headlights wheeling on the Wall, darkness, a rivet,
darkness. Tangled in the ropes Finn clung on, grabbing an arm that might have been
Keiro's. The raging wind hurtled them high, the up-current welling from a roaring
darkness, and as they rose the air thinned, the clouds and storm left far below, the Wall a
sheer nightmare that sucked them close. They were so near, Finn could see its pitted
surface was webbed with cracks and tiny doors, openings where bats gusted out and
navigated the gale with ease. Scoured by the collision of a billion atoms the metal
gleamed in the headlights.

The ship rolled. For a long second Finn was sure it would

358
roll right over; he held on to Keiro and closed his eyes, but when he opened them it had
righted, and Keiro was crashing against him, flailing in the ropes.

The stern swung around. There was a great slither, a tremendous jerk.

Gildas roared. \"Attia! She's let the anchor go!\"

Attia must have gone below and pulled the pins from the capstan. The ascent slowed, the
sails shredding. Gildas hauled himself up and pulled Finn close. \"We have to get right into
the Wall, and jump.\"


Finn stared, blank. The Sapient snapped, \"It's the only way out! The ship will fall and rise
and tumble forever! We have to drive her in there!\"

He pointed. Finn saw a dark cube. It jutted out from the beaten metal, a hollow opening of
darkness. It looked tiny; their chance of entering it remote.

\"Sapphique landed on a cube.\" Gildas had to hold on to him. \"That has to be it!\"

Finn glanced at Keiro. Doubt dickered between them. As Attia came up the hatchway and
slid toward them, Finn knew his oathbrother thought the old man was crazy, consumed
with his quest. And yet what choice did they have?

Keiro shrugged. Reckless, he spun the wheel and headed the ship straight at the Wall. In
the headlights the cube waited, a black enigma.

359
***

CLAUDIA COULD not speak. Her astonishment, her dismay were too great. She saw
animals.

Lions.

She counted them numbly; <<six|9k:0>>, <<seven ... three|5l:1>> cubs. A pride. That was the word, wasn't
it...? \"They can't possibly be real,\" she murmured.

Behind her, Jared sighed. \"But they are.\"

Lions. Alive, prowling, one roaring, the rest snoozing in an enclosure of grass, a few trees,
a lake where water birds waded.

She drew back, stared at the microscope, looked again.

One of the cubs scratched another; they rolled and fought. A lioness yawned and lay
down, paws flat.

Claudia turned. She looked at Jared through the mothy lamplight and he looked back,
and for a moment there was nothing to be said, only thoughts she didn't dare to think,
implications she was too horrified to follow through.

Finally she said, \"How small?\"


\"Incredibly small.\" He bit the ends of his long dark hair. \"Miniaturized to about a millionth
of a nanometer ... Infinitesimal.\"

\"They don't... How do they stay ...?\"

\"It's a gravity box. Self-adjusting. I thought the technique was lost. It seems to be an entire
zoo. There are elephants, zebra ...\" His voice trailed off; he shook his head. \"Perhaps it

360
was the prototype ... trying it first on animals. Who knows?\"

\"So this means ...\" She struggled to say it. \"That Incarceron ...\"

\"We've been looking for a huge building, an underground labyrinth. A world.\" He stared
ahead into the darkness. \"How blind we've been, Claudia! In the library of the Academy
there are records that propose that such things--trans-dimensional changes--were once
possible. All that knowledge was lost in the War. Or so we thought.\"

She got up; she couldn't sit still. The thought of the lions tinier than an atom of her skin, the
grass they lay on even smaller, the minute ants they crushed with their paws, the fleas on
their fur ... it was too difficult to take in. But for them the world was normal. And for Finn ...?

She walked in nettles, not noticing. Made herself say,

\"Incarceron is tiny.\"

\"I rear so.\"

\"The Portal...\"

\"A process of entering. Every atom of the body collapsed.\" He glanced up and she saw
how ill he looked. \"Do you see? They made a Prison to hold everything they feared and
diminished it so that its Warden could hold it in the palm of his hand. What an answer to
the problems of an overcrowded system, Claudia. What a way to dismiss a world's
troubles. And it explains much. The spatial anomaly. And there might be a time difference
too, a very tiny one.\"

361
She went back to the microscope and watched the lions roll and play. \"So this is why no
one can come out.\" She looked up. \"Is it reversible, Master?\"


\"How do I know? Without examining every--\" He stopped dead. \"Y realize we have
                                                                        ou
seen the Portal, the gateway? In your father's study there was a chair.\"

She leaned back against the table. \"The light fixture. The ceiling slots.\"

It was terrifying. She had to walk again, pace up and down, think about it hard. Then she
said, \"I have something to tell you too. He knows. He knows we have the Key.\"

Without looking at him, not wanting to see the fear in his eyes, she told him about her
father's anger, his demands. By the time she had finished, she found herself crouched
beside him in the lamplight, her voice down to a whisper. \"I won't give the Key back. I
have to get Finn out.\"

He was silent, the coat collar high around his neck. \"It's not possible,\" he said bleakly.

\"There must be some way ...\"

\"Oh, Claudia.\" Her tutor's voice was soft and bitter. \"How can there be?\"

Voices. Someone laughing, loud.

Instantly she leaped up, blew the lamps out. Jared seemed too dispirited to care. In the
dark they waited, listening to the revelers' drunken shouts, a badly sung ballad fading
away through the orchard. Claudia felt her heart thudding so loudly

362
in the hush, it almost hurt. Faint bells chimed <<eleven|11>> in the clock towers and stables of the
Palace. In one hour her wedding day would dawn. She would not give up. Not yet.

\"Now that we know about the Portal and what it does ... could you operate it?\"

\"Possibly. But there's no way back.\"

\"I could try.\" She said it quickly. \"Go in and look for him. What have I got here? A lifetime
with Caspar ...\"

\"No.\" He sat up and faced her. \"Can you even begin to imagine life in there? A hell of
violence and brutality? And here-- if the wedding doesn't happen, the Steel Wolves will
strike at once. There will be a terrible bloodshed.\" He reached over and took her hands. \"I
hope I've taught you always to face facts.\"

\"Master--\"


\"Y have to go through with the wedding. That's all that's left. There is no way back for
  ou
Giles.\"

She wanted to pull away, but he wouldn't let her. She hadn't known he was so strong.
\"Giles is lost to us. Even if he's alive.\"

She slid her hands down and held his, tight with misery. \"I don't know if I can,\" she
whispered.

\"I know. But you're brave.\"

\"I'll be so alone. They're sending you away.\"

His fingers were cool. \"I told you. Y have far too much to learn.\" In the darkness he
                                     ou
smiled his rare smile. \"I'm going nowhere, Claudia.\"

363

***

THEY COULDN'Tdo it. The ship wouldn't hold steady, even with all of them hauling at the
wheel. Her sails were rags, her rope trailed everywhere, her rails were smashed, and still
she yawed and zigzagged, the anchor swinging and the bow oscillating toward the cube,
away from it, above, below. \"It's impossible,\" Keiro growled.

\"No.\" Gildas seemed lit with joy. \"We can do it. Keep strong.\" He gripped the wheel and
stared ahead.

Suddenly the ship dropped. The headlights picked out the cube's opening; as they closed
on it, Finn saw it was filmed across with a strange viscosity like the surface of a bubble.
Rainbows of iridescence glimmered on it.

\"Giant snails,\" Keiro muttered. Even now he was able to joke, Finn thought.

Nearer, nearer. Now the ship was so close, they could see the reflection of her lights,
swollen and distorted. So close that the bowsprit touched the film, indented it, pierced it
so that it popped with soft abruptness, vanishing into a faint puff of sweet air.

Gradually, fighting the upstream, the ship slewed into the dark cube. The buffeting slowed.
Vast shadows overwhelmed the headlights.

Finn stared up at the square of blackness. As it opened as if to swallow him, he felt that


he was very tiny, was an ant crawling into a fold of cloth, a picnic cloth laid on the grass far
away

364
and long ago, where a birthday cake with seven candles lay half eaten, and a little girl with
brown curly hair was handing him a golden plate, so politely.

He smiled at her and took it.

The ship cracked. The mast splintered, toppled, wood showering around them. Attia fell
against him, scrabbling after a crystal glitter that slid from his shirt. \"Get the Key,\" she
yelled.

But the ship hit the back of the cube and darkness crashed down on him. Like a finger
crushing the ant. Like a main mast falling.

THE LOST PRINCE

367

29
***

Despair is deep. An abyss that swallows dreams.

A wall at the worlds end. Behind it I await death. Because all our work has come to this.

--Lord Calliston's Diary

***

The morning of the wedding dawned hot and fine. Even the weather had been planned;
the trees were in full blossom and the birds sang, the sky was a cloudless blue, the
temperature perfect, the breeze gentle and sweetly scented.

From her window Claudia watched the sweating servants unloading the carriage-loads of
gifts, saw even from up here the glint of diamonds, the dazzle of gold.

She put her chin on the stone sill, felt its gritty warmth. There was a nest just above, a
swallow that dipped in and out regularly with beakfuls of flies. Invisible chicks cheeped
urgently as the parents came and went.


She felt heavy-eyed and bone-weary. All night she had lain awake and looked up into the
crimson hangings of the bed, listening to the silence of the room, her future hanging over
her like a weighty curtain ready to fall. Her old life was finished--the freedom, the studying
with Jared, the long rides

368
and tree-climbing, the carelessness of doing as she liked. Today she would be Countess
of Steen, would enter the war of scheming and treachery that was the life of the Palace. In
an hour they would come to bathe her, do her hair, paint her nails, dress her like a doll.

She looked down.

There was a roof far below, the slope of some turret. For a dreamy moment she thought
that if she tied all the sheets of the bedclothes together, she might let herself down, slowly,
hand over hand till her bare feet touched the hot tiles. She might scramble down and steal
a horse from the stables and ride away, escape just as she was, in her white nightdress,
into the green forests on the far hills.

It was a warming thought. The girl who disappeared. The lost Princess. It made her smile.
But then a call from below jerked her back; she glanced down and saw Lord Evian,
resplendent in blue and ermine, gazing up at her.

He called something; she was too high to hear what, but she smiled and nodded, and he
bowed and walked away, his small heeled shoes clacking.

Watching him, she knew that all the Court was like him, that behind its perfumed and
elaborate facade lurked a web of hatreds and secret murders, and her own part in that
would begin very soon, and to survive it she must be as hard as they were. Finn could
never be rescued. She had to accept that.

369
She got up, sending the swallow off in panic, and walked to the dressing table.

It was laden with flowers, tussy-mussies, nosegays, and bouquets. They had been arriving
all morning, so that the room smelled exquisite and sickly. Behind her, on the bed, the
white gown lay spread in its finery. She looked at herself.

All right. She would marry Caspar and become Queen. If there was a plot, she would be
part of it. If there were killings, she would survive them. She would rule. No one would tell
her what to do ever again.


She opened the dressing table drawer, took out the Key, and placed it on the tabletop. It
glimmered, its crystal facets catching the sunlight, its eagle splendid.

But first she would have to tell Finn. Break it to him that there was no escape.

Tell him their engagement was over.

She reached out to it, but just as she touched it, there was a low knock on the door and
instantly she slid it smoothly into the drawer and picked up a brush. \"Come in, Alys.\"

The door opened. \"Not Alys,\" her father said.

He stood, dark and elegant, framed by the gilt lintel. \"May I come in?\"

\"Yes,\" she said.

His coat was new, a deep black velvet, a white rose in the lapel, his knee breeches satin.
He wore shoes with discreet buckles and his hair was caught in a black ribbon. He sat

370
gracefully, flipping the tails of the coat. \"All this finery is rather a bother. But one has to be
perfect on such a day.\" Glancing at her plain dress, he took his watch out and opened it,
so that the sun caught the silver cube that hung on the chain. \"Y have only two hours,
                                                                          ou
Claudia. Y should dress now.\"
           ou

She leaned her elbow on the table. \"Is that what you came to tell me?\"

\"I came to tell you how proud I am.\" His gray eyes held hers, and the light in them was
keen and sharp. \"Today is the day I have planned and schemed for decades. Long before
you were born. Today the Arlexi come to the heart of power. Nothing must go wrong.\" He
stood up and strode to the window, as if tension would not let him keep still. He smiled. \"I
confess I have not slept, thinking of it.\"

\"You're not the only one.\"

He looked at her closely. \"Y must have no fear, Claudia. Everything is arranged.
                            ou
Everything ready.\"

Something in his tone made her glance up. For a moment she looked at him and saw
under the mask, saw a man driven so fiercely by his dream of power that he would
sacrifice anything to achieve it. And with a cold shiver she saw that he would not share it.
Not with the Queen, or Caspar. \"What do you mean ... everything?\"


\"Just that things will turn out in our favor. Caspar is nothing but a stepping-stone.\"

371
She stood. \"Y know, don't you? About the assassination plan ... the Steel Wolves. Are
              ou
you one of them?\"

He crossed the room in one step and grabbed her arm so tightly, she gasped. \"Keep
quiet,\" he snapped. \"Do you think there aren't listening devices even here?\"

He led her to the window and flung it open. Strains of lute and drum floated upward, the
shouts of a guard commander drilling his men. Under cover of the noise his voice was low
and husky. \"Just do your part, Claudia. That's all.\"

\"And then you kill them.\" She tugged away.

\"What happens after doesn't concern you. Evian had no right to approach you.\"

\"Doesn't it? How long before I'm in your way too? How long before I fall off my horse?\"

She had shocked him. \"That will never happen.\"

\"No?\" Her scorn was acid; she wanted it to burn him. \"Because I'm your daughter?\"

He said, \"Because I have come to love you, Claudia.\"

There was something there that stuck her. Something odd. But he turned away. \"Now. The
Key.\"

She frowned, then went to the dressing table and opened the drawer. The Key gleamed;
she took it out and laid it on the top, among the clustered flowers.

The Warden came and looked down at it. \"Not even your precious Jared could have
discovered all the mysteries of this device.\"

\"I want to say good-bye,\" she said, stubborn. \"To Finn, and

372
the others. To explain to them. Then I'll give you the Key. At the wedding.\"

His eyes were cold and clear. \"Y always have to try my patience, Claudia.\"
                                ou


For a moment she thought he would just take it. But he walked to the door.

\"Don't keep Caspar waiting too long. He gets so ... sulky.\"

She locked the door after him and sat down, holding the Key in both hands. I have come
to love you. Perhaps he even thought that was true.

She switched the field on.

Then she jumped back, so fast that the Key fell with a clatter onto the floor.

Attia was in her room.

\"Y have to help us,\" the girl said at once. \"The ship has crashed. Gildas is hurt.\"
  ou

The field widened; she saw a dark place, heard a distant howling as of wind. Petals blew
off the flowers on her table, as if a gale from that place moved here.

Attia was shoved aside; Finn said, \"Claudia, please. Can Jared help ...?\"

\"Jared's not here.\" Helpless, she saw the wreckage of a strange craft littering the floor.
Keiro was tearing a piece of sail into strips and binding Gildas's arm and shoulder; she
saw blood already seeping through. \"Where are you?\"

\"The Wall.\" Finn looked weary. \"I think we've come as far

373
as we can. This is the End of the World. There's a passageway beyond, but I don't know if
he can travel ...\"

\"Of course I bloody can,\" Gildas snapped.

Finn pulled a face. \"Not for long. We must be close, Claudia, to the gate.\"

\"There is no gate.\" She knew her voice was flat.

He looked at her. \"But you said--\"

\"I was wrong. I'm sorry. It's all over, Finn. There is no gate and there is no way out. Not
ever. Not from Incarceron.\"


***

JARED WALKED into the Great Hall. It was thronged with courtiers and princes,
ambassadors, Sapienti, dukes, and duchesses. It was a bewilderment of colored satins
and the smell of sweat and powerful fragrances, and it made him feel a little weak. There
were seats along the wall; he made for one and sat, leaning his head back against the
cool stone. All around him, the guests at Claudia's wedding chattered and laughed. He
saw the bridegroom, with a gang of his wild young friends, already drinking, laughing
uproariously at some joke. The Queen was not present yet, nor the Warden.

A crinkle of silk beside him made him turn. Lord Evian bowed. \"Y look a little tired,
                                                                ou
Master.\"

Jared stared back. \"A sleepless night, sir.\"

\"Ah yes. But soon now, all our worries will be over.\" The fat man smiled, and fanned
himself with a small black fan. \"Please give Claudia all my best wishes.\"

374
He bowed again and turned. Jared said suddenly, \"One moment, my lord. The other day
... when you made a certain promise ...

\"Yes?\" Evian's smug manner was gone; he looked guarded.

\"Y mentioned the Nine-Fingered One.\"
  ou

Evian glared. He grabbed Jared's arm and hauled him into the crowd, moving so fast,
people stared as they were pushed aside. Out in the corridor he hissed, \"Never say that
name aloud. It is a sacred and a holy name for those who believe.\"

Jared tugged his arm free. \"I have heard of many cults and beliefs. Certainly all the ones
the Queen allows. But this--\"

\"This is not the day to discuss religion.\"

\"Y k is.\" Jared's eyes were sharp and clear. \"And we have very little time. Does he have
  es
another name, this hero of yours?\"

Evian breathed out angrily. \"I really can't say.\"

\"Y will say, my lord,\" Jared said pleasantly, \"or I'll make such an outcry right now about
  ou
your assassination plan that every guard in the Palace will hear it.\"


Evian's brow prickled with sweat. \"I think not.\"

Jared glanced down; the fat man had a dagger in his hand, the blade hard against
Jared's stomach. With an effort, he met the man's eyes. \"Either way, my lord, you would
be discovered. Ail I ask is a name.\"

For a moment they were face-to-face. Then Lord Evian said,

375
\"Y are a brave man, Sapient, but don't cross me again. As for the name, yes, indeed
  ou
there is one, hidden in time, lost in legend. The name of the One who claimed to have
escaped from Incarceron. In the most mysterious of our rites he is known as Sapphique.
Does that satisfy your curiosity?\"

Jared stared at him for a split second. Then he shoved him aside. And ran.

***

KEIRO WAS wild with anger; he and Gildas were yelling at her. \"How can you abandon
us?\" the Sapient scorched. \"Sapphique Escaped! Of course there is a way out!\"

She was silent. She was looking at Finn. He sat huddled up against a smashed angle of
decking, stiff with misery. His jacket was torn and there were cuts on his face, but now
more than ever she was sure he was Giles. Now that it was too late.

\"And you're marrying him,\" he said quietly.

Gildas swore. Keiro gave his oathbrother a scathing look. \"What does it matter who she
marries! Perhaps she decided she likes him better than you.\" He turned, hands on hips,
and faced her arrogantly. \"Is that it, Princess? Was this all a little diversion for you, a pretty
game?\" He jerked his head. \"Such lovely flowers! Such a sweet dress!\"

He came up so close to her that she almost felt he would reach out and grab her, but then
Finn said, \"Shut up, Keiro.\" He got up and faced her. \"Just tell me why. Why is it so
impossible?\"

376
She couldn't. How could she tell them that? \"Jared found some things out. Y have to
                                                                           ou
believe me.\"

\"What things?\"


\"About Incarceron. It's finished, Finn. Please. Make a life for yourself there. Forget the
Outside ...\"

\"And what about me?\" Gildas snapped. \"I've spent sixty years planning my Escape! I
scoured the Prison for a lifetime before I found a Starseer, and I'll never find another! We
have traveled to the End of the World, girl! I will not give up my dreams of a lifetime!\"

She stood up and stalked toward him, furious. \"Y use him like my father uses me. All he
                                                   ou
is to you is a way out; you don't care about him! Any of you!\"

\"That's not true!\" Attia hissed.

Claudia ignored her. Looking hard at Finn she said, \"I'm sorry. I wish things could have
been different. I'm sorry.\"

There was some sort of commotion outside her door; she turned and yelled, \"I won't see
anyone! Send them away!\"

Finn said, \"Do you know what I'm escaping from? From not knowing myself. Having this
darkness inside me, this emptiness. I can't live with that. Don't leave me here, Claudia!\"

She couldn't bear it anymore. Not Keiro's anger, not the fierce old man, not him. He was
hurting her, and none of this was her fault, none of it. She reached out for the Key. \"This is
good-bye, Finn. I have to give up the Key. My father knows about everything. It's over.\"

377
Her fingers closed on the link. Voices argued outside the door.

And then Attia said, \"He's not your father, Claudia.\" They all turned to her.

She was sitting on the floor, arms around her knees. She didn't get up or say anything
more but just sat there in the shocked silence she had created, her narrow face grimy and
calm, her dark hair greasy.

Claudia came right up to her, \"What?\" Her own voice sounded small and unfamiliar.

\"I'm afraid it's true.\" Attia was cool and distant. \"I wouldn't have told you, but now you're
forcing me to, and it's time you knew. The Warden of Incarceron is not your father.\"

\"Y lying little bitch!\"
  ou


\"No, it's true.\"

Keiro grinned.

Claudia felt as if the world had shaken. Suddenly the hubbub outside was too much;
turning her back on them, she hauled open the door. Jared was there, and two guards
holding him back.

\"What is this?\" Her voice was steel. \"Let him through.\"

\"Y father's orders, lady--\"
  our

\"My father,\" she screamed, \"can go to hell!\" Jared pushed her back into the room and
slammed the door. \"Claudia, listen--\"

\"Please, Master! Not now!\"

378
He saw the lightfield. Claudia stalked back to it. \"All right. Tell me,\" she said.

For a moment Attia said nothing. Then she stood up, brushing dirt from her bare arms. \"I
never liked you. Haughty, selfish, spoiled. Y think you're so tough--you wouldn't last ten
                                             ou
minutes in here. And Finn is worth ten of you.\"

\"Attia\" Finn growled, but Claudia said sharply, \"Let her speak.\"

\"Back there in the Sapient's tower we found lists of all the Prisoners who have ever been
in this place. They all looked for their own names, but I didn't.\" Attia came close to
Claudia. \"I looked for yours.\"

Finn turned, chilled. \"Y said it wasn't there.\"
                        ou

\"I said she wasn't in Incarceron. But she has been.\"

He felt so cold. Looking at Claudia, he saw her face was white; it was Jared who said
quietly, \"When?\"

\"She was born here, and she lived here for one week. Then, nothing. She vanishes from
the records. Someone took a week-old baby girl out of the Prison, and there she is, look,
the daughter of the Warden. He must have been very desperate for a daughter. And there
must have been one who died, or he would have chosen a son.\"


Keiro said, \"Y recognize her from a photo of a baby? That's--\"
              ou

\"Not just a baby.\" Attia kept her eyes on Claudia. \"Someone put paintings of her into the
book. Images, just like us. Of

379
her growing up. Of her having everything she wanted, clothes, toys, horses. Of her ...\"

\"Getting betrothed?\" Keiro said slyly.

Finn turned with a gasp. \"Was I there? Was I in that image too? Attia!\"

Her lips set. \"No.\"

\"Are you sure?\"

\"I'd tell you if you were.\" She turned earnestly. \"I would tell you, Finn. It was just her.\"

He looked at Claudia. She seemed stunned with shock. He glanced at Jared, who
muttered, 'T have also found the name of Sapphique here. It seems he truly did Escape.\"

Gildas spun around and the two Sapienti exchanged glances. \"Y see what this means.\"
                                                             ou
The old man was triumphant. He was bleeding and limping, but his whole body was
charged with energy. \"They took her out. Sapphique got out. There is a way. Perhaps if
we brought both the Keys together, we could unlock it.\"

Jared frowned. \"Claudia?\" he said.

She couldn't move for a moment. Then her head jerked up and she looked Finn hard in
the eyes and he saw her gaze was fierce and bitter. \"Keep the Key switched on, all the
time,\" she said. \"When I get Inside, I'll need to find you.\"

All my years to this moment

All my roads to this wall.


All my words to this silence

***

She paced the study floor anxiously, dressed in dark trousers and jacket. \"Well?\"

\"Five minutes.\" Jared worked on the controls without looking up. He had already placed a
handkerchief on the chair and operated the device; the handkerchief had disappeared,
but he couldn't get it back.

Claudia stared at the door.

She had torn up her wedding dress in a fury that had amazed even herself, shredding the
lace and ripping the flouncy skirt wide open. All that was over. Protocol was over. She was
at war now. Racing down here through the dark cellars, she had run through anger and
bewilderment and the emptiness of a wasted past.

\"All right.\" Jared looked up. \"I think I understand what's what, but where this machine will
take you, Claudia ...?\"

\"I know where it takes me. Away from him.\" The knowledge

381
that he was not her father still rang in her head like a great blare of sound, endlessly
echoing, so that she felt she would never hear anything else but that girl's quiet,
devastating words. Jared said, \"Sit in the chair.\"

She grabbed her sword and walked over and stopped. \"What about you? When he finds
out..

\"Don't worry about me.\" He took her arm gently and made her sit. \"It's about time I stood
up to your father. I'm sure it will be good for me.\"

Her face clouded. \"Master ... if he hurts you ...\"

\"All you need to worry about is finding Giles and bringing him back. Justice must be done.
Good luck, Claudia.\" He raised her hand and kissed it formally. For a moment she was
stricken with the thought that she would never see him again; all she wanted to do was


jump up and hug him, but he moved away to the panel of instruments and looked up.
\"Ready?\"

She couldn't speak. She nodded. And then, just before his fingers touched the panel, she
said hurriedly, \"Good-bye, Master.\"

He pressed the blue square, and it happened. From the ceiling slots a cage of white light
fell, so blindingly brilliant and so quick that it was gone as soon as it had come, and all he
could see was the black aftermath imprinted on his retina.

He brought his hands away from his face.

The room was empty. He could smell a faint sweetness.

\"Claudia?\" he whispered.

Nothing. For a long moment he waited in the silence. He

382
wanted to stay, but he had to get out of the study; the Warden must not know what had
happened for as long as possible, and if they found him here ... Hurriedly he slammed the
controls back, slid out through the great bronze door, and locked it behind him.

All the way up through the cellars Jared sweated with fear. There must be some alarm he
had overlooked, some screaming trigger his scanner had failed to detect. At every step
he expected to hurtle into the Warden or a posse of Palace guards, and by the time he
came up to the formal corridors, he was pale and shivering and had to lean in an alcove
and take deep, careful breaths, a passing maid staring at him curiously.

In the Great Hall, the crowd's noise was louder. As he threaded among them he sensed
the growing tension, the expectation heightened almost to hysteria. The staircase that
Claudia should descend was in full view, lined by footmen in powdered wigs. As he
slipped into a seat by the fireplace he saw the Queen, glorious in cloth of gold and a tiara
of diamonds, flicker an irritated glance at it.

But brides were always late.

Jared leaned back and stretched out his legs. He was lightheaded with fear and fatigue
and yet he felt something else that surprised him: a strange peace. He wondered how
long it would last.

Then he saw the Warden.


Tall and grave, the man who was not Claudia's father. Jared

383
watched as the Warden smiled, nodded, exchanged graceful small talk with the waiting
courtiers. Once he took out his watch and glanced at it, held it to his ear as if in all the
hubbub he needed to check it was going. Then he put it away and frowned.

Impatience grew, slowly.

The crowd murmured. Caspar came over and said something to his mother, she spoke to
him sharply, and he went back to his supporters. Jared watched the Queen.

Her hair was swept up elaborately, her lips red in the whitened pallor of her face, but her
eyes were cool and shrewd and he recognized the growing suspicion in them.

She crooked a finger and the Warden moved to her side. They spoke briefly. A servant
was called, a smooth silver-haired steward, and he bowed and vanished discreetly.

Jared rubbed his face.

It must be panic up there in her rooms, the maids searching for her, fingering the dress,
terrified for their own skins. Probably they had all fled. He hoped Alys wouldn't be there--
the old nurse would be blamed.

He leaned back against the wall and tried to summon up all his courage.

He didn't have long to wait.

There was a disturbance on the stairs. Heads turned. Women craned to see, a rustle of
dresses and faint applause that petered out into bewilderment, because the silver-haired
servant was

384
racing down, breathless, and in his hands he had the dress, or rather what was left of it.
Jared wiped sweat from his lip. He had never seen Claudia so furious as when she had
torn it to shreds.

Confusion erupted.

A scream of anger, orders, the clash of weapons. Slowly, Jared stood.


The Queen was white-faced; she turned on the Warden. \"What is this? Where is she?\"

His voice was icy. \"I have no idea, madam. But I suggest ...\"

He stopped. His gray eyes met Jared's through the agitated crowd.

They looked at each other and in the sudden growing hush the crowd noticed and fell
back between them, as if people feared to stand in that corridor of anger.

The Warden said, \"Master Jared. Do you know where my daughter is?\"

Jared managed a small smile. \"I regret I cannot say, sir. But I can say this. She has
decided against the wedding.\" The crowd was utterly silent.

Her eyes glittering with wrath, the Queen said, \"She's jilted my son?\"

He bowed. \"She has changed her mind. It was sudden, and she felt she could not face
either of you. She has left the Palace. She begs your indulgence.\"

385
Claudia would hate that last, he thought, but he had to be so careful. He steeled himself
for the reaction. The Queen gave a laugh of pure venom; she turned on the \"warden.\" My
dear John, what a blow for you! After all your plans and schemes! I have to say I never
thought it a very good idea. She was so ... unsuitable. Y chose your replacement so
                                                          ou
badly.\"

The \"wardens eyes never left Jared's, and the Sapient felt that basilisk stare slowly petrify
his courage.\" Where has she gone?

Jared swallowed. \"Home.\"

\"Alone?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"In a carriage?\"

\"On horseback.\"

The Warden turned. \"A patrol after her. At once!\" Did he believe it? Jared wasn't sure.

\"Of course I pity your domestic troubles,\" the Queen said cruelly, \"but you realize that I will


never suffer an insult like this again. There will be no wedding, Warden, even if she comes
back crawling on her hands and knees.\"

Caspar muttered, \"Scheming ungrateful bitch,\" but his mother silenced him with a look.

\"Clear the chamber,\" she said sharply. \"I want everyone out.\"

As if it was a signal, an uproar of voices burst out, excited questions, shocked whispers.

Through it all Jared stood still, and the Warden stood

386
watching him, and there was a look in those eyes the Sapient could not beat now. He
turned away.

\"Y stay.\" John Arlex's order was hoarse and unrecognizable.
  ou

\"Warden.\" Lord Evian pushed up close to them. \"I have just heard ... such news ... is it
true?\"

His affectations were gone; he was pale with intensity. \"True. She's gone.\" The Warden
spared him one grim glance. It's over.

\"Then ... the Queen?\"

\"Remains the Queen.\"

\"But... our plan ...\"

The Warden silenced him with a flash of anger. \"Enough, man! Don't you hear what I say?
Go back to your puffs and perfumes. It's all we have now.\"

As if he could not understand what had happened, Evian clawed restlessly at his tight
ruffled suit, tugging a button loose. \"We can't let it end like this.\"

\"We have no choice.\"

\"All our dreams. The end of Protocol.\" He reached his hand inside the coat. \"I can t. I
won't.\"

He moved in before Jared realized what was happening, the knife flashing out, slashing
down at the Queen. As she turned, it caught her high on the shoulder; she screamed in


shock. Instantly the cloth of gold was running with blood, small spatterings and trickles that
welled up as she gasped

387
and clawed at Caspar, stumbling into the arms of courtiers. \"Guards!\" the Warden cried.
He whipped out his sword. Jared turned.

Evian was staggering back, the pink suit smeared with blood. He must have seen he had
failed; the Queen was hysterical but not dead, and there was no chance to strike again. At
least not at her. Soldiers ran in, their sharp pikes forcing him back in a ring of steel. He
stared at Jared without seeing him, at the Warden, at Caspar's pale terror.

\"I do this for freedom,\" he said calmly. \"In a world that offers none.\"

With a swift accuracy he turned the knife and with both hands thrust it into his heart. He
crumpled over it, crashed down, juddered a moment and was still. As Jared pushed past
the guards and bent over him, he saw death had been almost instant; blood was still
slowly welling through the silk cloth.

He gazed down, horrified, at the plump face, the staring eyes.

\"Stupid,\" the Warden said behind him. \"And weak.\" He reached down and hauled Jared
up, turning him roughly.

\"Are you weak, Master Sapient? I have always thought so. We'll see now if I was tight.\"
He looked at the guard. \"Take the Master to his room and lock him in. Bring me any
devices that are there. Post two men outside. He is not to leave, and will receive no
visitors.\"

\"Sire.\" The man bowed.

388
The Queen had been hustled out and the crowd scattered; all at once the great Chamber
seemed empty. The garlands of flowers and orange blossom drifted slightly in the breeze
from the open windows. As Jared was led to the door he stepped on spilled petals and
sticky sweetmeats; the detritus of a wedding that would never happen.

Just before they pushed him out, he looked back and saw the Warden standing with both
hands on the high fireplace, leaning over the empty hearth. His hands were clenched fists
on the white marble.


***

NOTHING HAPPENED but a white light. When Claudia opened her eyes, they stung; her
sight was watery, and small dark spots floated there for a minute, dimming the walls of the
cell.

It was certainly a cell. It stank. The smell was so strong, she retched and then tried nor to
breathe again, the reek of damp and urine and rotting bodies and straw.

The straw was all around her; she was sitting in it, and a flea jumped out of it onto her
hand. With a hiss of disgust she jumped up and shook it off, shivering and scratching.

So this was Incarceron.

It was just as she'd expected.

The cell was stone-walled and the stones were carved with ancient names and dates,
filmed with milky lichens and a fur of algae. Above, the groined vault was lost in darkness.
There

389
was one window, high in the wall, but it seemed to be covered. Nothing else. But the cell
door was open.

Claudia took another breath, trying not to cough. The cell was silent, a heavy, oppressive
silence that was cold and clammy. A listening silence. And in the corner of the cell, she
saw an Eye. A small red Eye that watched her impassively.

She felt normal. No tingling or sickness. She looked at herself, her hands clutching the
Key. Was she really so minute? Or was any notion of size relative--was this normality and
the Realm outside a place of giants?

She crossed to the door. It had not been locked for a long time. Chains hung from it, but
they were corroded into a mass with rust, and the hinges were eaten away so that the
door hung at an angle. She ducked under it, into the passageway.

It was stone-flagged and filthy, and k stretched into darkness.

She looked at the Key, operated the imager. \"Finn?\" she whispered. Nothing happened.
Only, far off down the corridor, something hummed. A low-pitched whine, like a machine
being activated. She flicked the Key off hastily, her heart thudding. \"Is that you?\"


Nothing.

She took two steps, then stopped. The sound came again, just ahead, a soft, oddly
questing sound. She saw a red Eye open, turn slowly through a half circle, then stop and
swivel back toward her. She kept very still.

390

\"I see you,\" a voice said softly. \"I recognize you.\" Not Finns. Not anyone she knew.

\"I never forget any of my children. But you haven't been here for a while. I'm not sure I
understand that.\"

Claudia wiped her cheek with a grimy hand. \"Who are you? I can't see you.\"

\"Yes you can. You're standing on me, breathing me.\"

She stepped back, staring down, but there was only the stone floor, the darkness.

The red Eye watched her. She breathed a sickening breath. \"You're the Prison.\"

\"I am.\" It sounded fascinated. \"And you are the Wardens daughter.\"

She couldn't speak. Jared had said it was an intelligence, but she hadn't realized it would
be like this.

\"Shall we help each other, Claudia Arlexa?\" The voice was calm and had a slight echo.
\"You are looking for Finn and his friends. Isn't that right?\"

\"Yes.\" Should she have said that?

\"I will lead you to them.\"

\"The Key will do that.\"

\"Don't use the Key. It interferes with my systems.\"

Was she mistaken, or had that been hurried, almost annoyed? She began to walk on
slowly, into the dark corridor. \"I see. And what do you want in return?\"

A sound. It could have been a sigh, or a soft laugh. \"Not a


391

question I have been asked before. I want you to tell me what is Outside. Sapphique
promised faithfully that he would come back and tell me, but he never has. Your father
does not speak of it. I begin to wonder, in my heart of hearts, if there even is an
Outside, or whether Sapphique passed only into death and you live in a place here I
am unable to detect. I have a billion Eyes and senses, and yet I cannot see out. It is not
only the inmates who dream of Escape, Claudia. But then, how can I escape from
myself?\"

She came to a corner. The passageway forked in two, both dark and dripping, and
identical. She frowned and held the Key tightly. \"I don't know. It's pretty much what I'm
trying to do. All right. Take me to Finn. And as we go I'll tell you what's Outside.\"

Lights flickered on ahead. \"This way.\" She paused. \"Y do really know where they are?
                                                     ou
This isn't a trick?\"

Silence. Then, \"Oh Claudia. How angry your father will be with you. When he finds out.\"

392

31
***

He fell all day and all night. He fell into a pit of darkness. He fell like a stone falls, like a
bird with broken wings, like an angel cast down. His landing bruised the world.


--Legends of Sapphique

***

\"It's changed.\" Keiro looked intently at the Key. \"The colors.\" Finn lifted the crystal into a
glimmer of light. The red lights were humming, flickering into a muted rainbow. The Key
seemed warmer in his hand.

\"Maybe she's Inside.\"

\"Then why doesn't she talk to us?\"

Ahead, Gildas turned, a limping shadow in the darkness. \"Is this the way? Finn?\"

He had no idea. The wreckage of the ship was far behind; the cube had become a funnel,
narrowing as they hurried into it, the sides and roof closing in, becoming black faceted
stone, the familiar obsidian glint of walls.

\"Keep close to me,\" he muttered. \"We don't know how far the protective field goes.\"

Gildas barely heard. Since he had spoken to Jared the feverish possession of his quest
had come over him again; anxiously

393
he limped ahead, examining faint scratches on the walls, muttering to himself. He
seemed to ignore his injuries, but Finn guessed they were more serious than he let on.

\"The old fool's losing it,\" Keiro muttered in disgust. He turned. \"And then there's her.\"

Attia hung back. She seemed to be walking deliberately slowly; in the shadows she
seemed deep in thought.

\"That was some stunt she pulled.\" Keiro walked on. He gave a sharp glance at Finn. \"A
real blow under the belt.\"

Finn nodded. Claudia had gone so still. Like someone stabbed with a deep wound keeps
still, so as not to feel the pain.

\"But,\" Keiro said, \"it means there's a way out. So we can get out too.\"

\"You're heartless. Y only ever think about yourself.\"
                    ou


\"And you, brother.\" His oathbrother glanced around, alert. \"If there is an Outside and
you're some sort of king out there, then I'm guarding you like gold. Prince Keiro sounds
good to me.\"

\"I'm not sure I can do that... be that.\"

\"Y can. It's all pretense. Y
  ou                        ou're a master of lies, Finn.\" Keiro looked at him sidelong.
\"Y be a natural.\"
  ou'll

For a moment they shared a look. Then Finn said, \"Can you hear something?\"

A murmur. It drifted down the corridor, a gust of soft voices. Keiro drew his sword. Attia
closed up. \"What is it?\"

\"Something ahead.\" Keiro listened intently, but the sound

394
did not come again. Standing still, one hand against the wall, Gildas whispered, \"Maybe
it's Claudia. She's found us.\"

\"Then she was very quick about it.\" Keiro walked on softly. \"Stay together. Finn, go at the
back, and keep the Key safe.\"

Gildas snorted but took his place between them.

It was a voice. It was speaking somewhere ahead, and as they crept toward it, the
passageway became cluttered; great chains lay across it, manacles and shackles,
scattered heaps of tools, a broken Beetle on its back. They passed small cells, some with
the doors locked, and through the grille in one Finn saw a tiny dark room with rats
clambering over an empty plate, a filthy pile of rags in one corner that might have been a
body. Everything was still. He felt that this was a place forgotten even by its makers, a
corner of itself even Incarceron had overlooked for centuries. Had it been somewhere like
this that the Maestra's people had found the Key, with the desiccated bones of the man
who had made it, or stolen it?

Stepping around a great pillar he realized he was beginning to forget her. Already it
seemed so long ago, and yet the clatter of the bridge, her single look, were still inside
him, waiting for him to sleep, to think he was safe. And her pity.

Attia grabbed him; he realized he had been walking past them.

\"Stay awake, brother.\" Keiro's hiss was fierce. Heart thudding, he tried to clear his head.


The prickling in his face subsided. He took deep breaths.

395
\"All right?\" Gildas whispered.

He nodded. The fit had nearly crept up on him. It made him feel sick.

Peering around the corner, he stared.

The voice was speaking in a language he had never heard, of clicks and squeaks and
stilted syllables. It was addressing Beetles and Sweepers and Flies, and the metallic rats
that came out of the walls to carry off corpses. Millions of them crouched motionless on
the floor of a great hall, lined ropes and aerial walkways, all of them facing one brilliant
star that shone like a spark in the darkness. Incarceron instructed its creatures and the
words it spoke were a patchwork of sounds, a poetry of cracks and rumbles.

\"Can they hear?\" Keiro whispered.

\"It's not just words.\" It was a vibration too, deep in the heart of the darkness, a sound like
a vast heart beating, a great clock chiming.

The voice stopped. At once the machines turned and filed away, moving in silent rows into
the darkness till the last one was gone, barely making a sound.

Finn moved, but Keiro grabbed him tight.

The Eye still watched. Its light lit the empty hall. Then the voice said softly, \"Have you got
the Key with you, Finn? Shall I take it now?\"

He gasped. He wanted to run, but Keiro's grip said no. Biting his lip, he heard the
Prison's low amused chuckle. ''Claudia

396

is Inside. Did you know that? Of course I intend to keep you both apart. I am so vast, it
will be only too easy. Won't you speak to me, Finn?\"

\"It's not sure we're here,\" Keiro muttered.

\"It sounds sure to me.\"

He had an irrational urge to step out from the Key's protection, to open his arms and go


out. But Keiro wouldn't let go, and wriggled around to Attia. \"Back. Quickly.\"

\"Of course I am only a machine,\" Incarceron said acidly.

\"Unlike you. Or are you? Are you all so pure? Perhaps I should try a little experiment
of my own.\"

Keiro shoved him, panicking. \"Run!\"

It was too late. There was a hiss and a crack. The sword flew out of Keiro's hand and
clanged against the wall, held there upside down.

And Finn was hauled back, slammed against the stones, the Key in his belt pinning him
there, the dagger he held whipping his arm flat with enormous power.

\"Ah. Now I feel you, Finn. Now I feel your fear.\"

He couldn't move. For a moment of terror he thought he was being sucked into the very
fabric of the wall; then Gildas was there tugging at him, and he let go of the knife and his
hand came free, and he realized the wall had become a magnet. Scraps of iron, flakes of
bronze were flying in a fierce horizontal blizzard; the wall became clotted instantly with
tools, chainwork, vast links. Finn ducked, cursing, as one

397
clanged right next to his ear. \"Get me off!\" he screamed.

His body was crushed between the Key and the magnet.

Gildas already had hold of the crystal; the old man dug his heels and gasped, \"Help me,\"
and Attia's small hands grabbed tight. Slowly, as if they were tugging it away from
invisible fingers they pulled the weight of the Key from him and he fell forward, stumbling.

\"Go. Go!\"

Incarceron laughed its deep laugh. \"But you can't go. Not without your brother.\"

Poised to flee, he stopped.

Keiro was standing by the wall. He had one hand oddly propped against it, the back of his
hand to the black surface. For a moment Finn thought he was trying to pry away the sword
and yelled \"Leave that!\" but then Keiro turned and gave him a look of cold fury.


\"It's not the sword.\"

Finn caught his oathbrother's arm and pulled. It was held tight.

\"Let go.\"

\"I'm not holding anything,\" Keiro said. He turned his face away. Finn looked closer.

\"But...\"

His brother twisted to look at him and Finn was shocked by the anger in his eyes. \"It's me,
Finn. Don't you realize? Are you that stupid? Me!\"

398
The fingernail of his right forefinger. It was tight to the wall, and when Finn grabbed his
hand and pulled on it, it stayed there, a small shield held to the magnet with an attraction
nothing could break.

\"Shall I let him go?\" The Prison said slyly.

Finn looked at Keiro and Keiro looked back. \"Yes,\" he whispered.

\"With a violence that made them all wince, every piece of metal fell from the walls in one
resounding crash.

CLAUDIA STOPPED. \"What was that?\"

\"What?\"

\"That noise!\"

\"There are always noises in the Prison. Please do go on about the Queen. She sounds
so--\"

\"It came from down there.\" Claudia stared down the dim archway she was passing. She
saw a low passageway, barely head-high, roped with spiderwebs.

Incarceron laughed, but there was a note of anxiety in its humor. \"To find Finn you must
go straight on.\"

She was silent. Suddenly she sensed its tense presence all around her, as if it did not


breathe, was waiting. She felt small and vulnerable. She said, \"I think you're lying to me.\"

For a moment, nothing. A rat ran up the passage, saw her, and slunk around. Then the
voice said thoughtfully, \"Your idea of Finn is a foolishly romantic one; the lost Prince,
the imprisoned

399
hero. You remember a little boy and want it to be him. But even if Finn is really Giles,
that was a lifetime away and a world ago and he is not the same now I have changed
                                                                      .
him,\"

She stared up into the darkness. \"No.\"

\"Oh yes. Your father was right. To survive here men descend to the depths of their
beings. They become beasts, not caring, not even seeing the pain of others. Finn has
stolen, perhaps killed. How can such a man return to a throne, and govern others? How
can he ever be trusted again? The Sapienti were wise, but they made a system without
release, Claudia. Without forgiveness.\"

Its voice was chilling her. She didn't want to listen, to be drawn into its persuasive doubts.

She activated the Key, turned into the low passage, and began to run.

Her shoes slithered on the rubble that littered the floor, bones and straw, a dead creature
so desiccated, it collapsed as she jumped over it.

\"Claudia. Where are you?\"

It was all around her, before her, under her.

\"Stop. Please. Or I will have to stop you.\"

She didn't answer. Ducking under an arch, she found three tunnels that met, but the Key
was so hot now, it almost scorched her hand, and she plunged into the left-hand tunnel,
racing past cell doors that hung open.

The Prison rumbled. The floor rippled, rose up under her like a carpet. She gasped as it
flung her up; she landed with

400
a cry, one leg bloodied, but picking herself up, she raced on, because it couldn't be sure


where she was, not with the Key.

The world rocked. It tipped from side to side. Darkness closed in, noxious smells seeped
from the walls, bats swirled in clouds. She wouldn't scream. Clawing the stones, she
pulled herself on, even when the passageway lifted itself up and became a hill, a steep,
slippery slope, and all the rubble that lay on it slid down on her.

And then, just as she wanted to let go and slither back, she heard voices.

KEIRO FLEXED his fingers. His face was flushed and his eyes would not meet Finn's. It
was Gildas who broke the silence. \"So I've been traveling with a halfman.\"

Keiro ignored him. He looked at Finn, who said, \"How long have you known?\"

\"All my life.\" His oathbrother's voice was subdued.

\"But you. Y were the one who hated them most. Despised them ...\"
           ou

Keiro shook his head in irritation. \"Y Of course. I hate them. I have more cause to hate
                                       es.
them than you. Don't you see that they scare me stiff?\" He flung a glance at Attia, then
yelled out at the Prison, \"And you! I swear if I could ever find your heart, I'd slice it open!\"

Finn didn't know how he felt. Keiro was so perfect, all he

401
had ever wanted to be. Handsome, bold, without flaw, alive with that zestful confidence he
had always envied.

He was never scared stiff.

\"All my sons think that\" Incarceron said slyly.

Keiro slumped against the wall. A Are seemed to have gone out of him. He said, \"It
scares me because I don't know how far it goes.\" Lifting up his hand, he flexed his finger.
\"It looks real, doesn't it? No one can tell. And how do I know how much more of me is like
that? Inside me, the organs, the heart. How do I know?\" There was a sort of agony in the
question, as if it had been asked silently a million times before, as if behind the bravado
and arrogance was a fear he had never revealed.

Finn looked around. \"The Prison could tell you.\"

\"No. I don't want to know.\"


\"It doesn't matter to me.\" Finn ignored Gildas's snort and glanced at Attia.

Quietly she said, \"So we're all flawed. Even you. I'm sorry.\"

\"Thanks.\" Keiro was scornful. \"The pity of a dog-girl and a Starseer. That really makes me
feel better.\"

\"We're only--\"

\"Save k. I don't need it.\" He brushed away Finn's outstretched hand and pulled himself
upright. \"And don't think it changes me. I'm still me.\"

Gildas limped past. \"Well, you get no pity from me. Let's get on.\"

Keiro stared at his back with a rigidity of hatred that made

402
Finn move in; his oathbrother snatched up the sword from the floor, but as he took one
step after the Sapient, the Prison shivered and shuddered.

Finn grabbed the wall.

When the world stopped moving, the air was thick with dust; it hung like a fog, and there
was a ringing in his ears. Gildas was hissing in pain. Attia scrambled over; she pointed
through the miasma. \"Finn. What's that?\"

For a moment he had no idea. Then he saw it was a face. A face that was oddly clean,
with bright clever eyes and a tangle of hastily tied hair. A face that was staring at him out
of the mists of the past over the tiny flames of candles on a cake that he leaned over and
blew out with one exhausting breath.

\"Is that you?\" she whispered.

He nodded, silent, knowing this was Claudia.

***

The soldiers came after two hours. Jared had been waiting for them; he had lain on the
hard bed in the silent room and listened to the sounds of the Palace through the open
casement; the galloping horses far below, the coaches, the scurry, the shouts. It was as if
Claudia had taken a stick to a nest of ants and now they were in a swarming panic, their
Queen injured and their peace gone.

The Queen. As he sat up stiffly and gazed at the men, he hoped he wouldn't have to face
her fury.

\"Master.\" The liveried servant seemed embarrassed. \"Would you come with us, sir.\"

Always the Protocol. It saved them from facing the truth. As they led him down the stairs,
the guardsmen fell in discreetly behind, their halberds held like staffs of office.

He had already gone through all the emotions. Terror, bluster, despair. Now all that was
left was a sort of dull resignation.

404
Whatever the Warden would do to him had to be borne. Claudia had to have time.

To his surprise they took him past the state rooms, where anxious envoys argued and
messengers ran in and out, down to a small room in the east wing. When they ushered
him in he saw it was one of the Queen's private drawing-rooms, cluttered with fragile gilt
furniture, an elaborate clock on the mantelpiece heaped with cherubs and simpering
shepherdesses.

Only the Warden was here.

He was not sitting at a desk, but standing, facing the door. Two armchairs were arranged
at easy angles by the hearth, where a great bowl of potpourri sat in the empty fireplace.

It still felt like a trap.


\"Master Jared.\" The Warden indicated one chair with a long finger. \"Please sit.\"

He was glad to. He felt breathless and light-headed.

\"A little water.\" The Warden poured it and brought the goblet over. As he drank from it
Jared felt Claudia's father ... no, not her father ... watching him acutely.

\"Thank you.\"

\"Y haven't eaten?\"
  ou

\"No ... I suppose ... in all the fuss ...\"

\"Y should take more care of yourself.\" The voice was hard. \"Too many hours working at
  ou
these forbidden devices.\"

He waved a hand. Jared saw that the table near the

405
window was covered with pieces of his experiments, the scanners, the imagers, the
devices to block alarms. He said nothing. \"Of course you understand that all these are
illegal.\" The Warden's eyes were ice-cold. \"We have always allowed the Sapienti a
certain leeway, but you seem to have been taking great advantage.\" Then he said,
\"Where is Claudia, Master?\"

\"I told you--\"

\"Don't lie to me. She is not at home. There are no horses unaccounted for.\"

\"Perhaps ... she may be on foot.\"

\"I do believe she is.\" The Warden sat opposite him, his black satin breeches creasing
elegantly. \"And perhaps you thought you were not lying when you said home?\"

Jared put the cup down. They faced each other.

\"How did she find out?\" John Arlex said.

Jared decided, quite suddenly, to tell the truth. \"The girl in the Prison told her, Attia, Finn's
friend. From some records she had discovered.\"

The Warden nodded in slow appreciation. \"Ah yes. How did she take it?\"


\"She was ... very shocked.\"

\"Furious?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"I would expect nothing else.\"

\"And upset.\"

The Warden shot him a keen glare, but Jared returned it

406
calmly. \"She had always been so secure as your daughter, sir. Known who she was. She
... cares for you.\"

\"Don't lie to me.\" The sudden snarl shocked him with its anger. The Warden got up and
paced down the room. \"There has only ever been one person Claudia has cared for in
her life, Master Sapient. And that is you.\"

Jared sat still . His heart hammered. \"Sir ...\"

\"Did you think I was blind?\" The Warden turned. \"No indeed. Oh, she had her nurses and
her waiting women, but Claudia is far above their level and she knew it early. Every time I
came home I saw how she and you laughed and talked, how she fussed with your coat if it
was cold, sent for possets and sweetmeats, how you had your private jokes, your shared
studies.\" He folded his arms and stared out of the window. \"With me she was distant,
reserved. She didn't know me. I was a stranger, the Warden, a great man at Court,
someone who came and went. Someone to be wary of. But you, Master Jared, you were
her tutor and her brother and more her father than I have ever been.\"

Jared was cold now. Behind the Warden's iron control was a blazing hatred; he had never
sensed the depth of it before. He tried to breathe calmly.

\"How do you think that felt, Master?\" The Warden swung around. \"Did you think I didn't
feel it? Do you think I didn't suffer, not knowing what to do, how to change it? Aware that
with every word I spoke I was deceiving her;

407
every day, just by being there, by letting her think she was mine.\"


\"She ... that is what she will not forgive.\"

\"Don't tell me how she thinks!\" John Arlex came and stood over him. \"I have always been
jealous of you. Is that not foolish? A dreamer, a man without family, so fragile a few blows
would kill him. And the Warden of Incarceron is sick with envy.\"

Jared managed to say, \"I... am very fond of Claudia ...\"

\"Y know, of course, there are rumors about you.\" The Warden swung away abruptly and
  ou
sat down again. \"I don't believe them; Claudia is willful but not stupid. However, the Queen
does, and let me tell you Jared, at the moment the Queen is screaming for revenge. On
anyone. Evian is dead, but the plot obviously included others. Y for one.\"
                                                                   ou,

He shivered. \"Sir, you know well that is not so.\"

\"Y knew about it. Didn't you?\"
  ou

\"Y but...\"
  es,

\"And you did nothing. Told no one.\" He leaned forward. \"That is treason, Master Sapient,
and could easily have you hanged.\"

In the silence someone called outside. A fly buzzed in and droned around the room, hitting
the glass and fumbling against it.

Jared tried to think, but there was no time. The Warden snapped, \"Where's the Key?\"

408
He wanted to lie. To make something up. Instead he kept silent.

\"She's taken it with her, hasn't she?\"

He didn't answer. The Warden swore. \"The whole world thinks Giles is dead. She could
have had everything, the Realm, the throne. Did she think I would let Caspar get in her
way?\"

\"Y were in the plot?\" Jared said slowly.
  ou

\"Plot! Evian and his naive dreams of a world without Protocol! There has never been a
world without Protocol. I would have let the Steel Wolves deal with the Queen and Caspar,
and then had them executed, simple. But now she has turned against me.\"


He was staring blankly across the room. Jared said gently, \"The story you told her ...
about her mother.\"

\"That was true. But when Helena died the baby was sickly and I knew it would die too.
And what then of my plans? I needed a daughter, Master. And I knew where to get one.\"
He sat in the armchair opposite. \"Incarceron is a failure. A hell. The Wardens have long
known that, but there is no remedy, so we keep it secret. I thought I would rescue one soul
from that, at least. In the depths of the Prison I found a woman who was so desperate she
was willing to part with her newborn girl. I paid well. Her other children survived because
of it.\"

Jared nodded. The Warden's voice had sunk; he seemed to be talking to himself, as if he
had justified this endlessly to himself over the years.

409
\"No one realized, except the Queen. That sorceress took one look at the child and knew.\"

A sudden understanding came to Jared. Fascinated, he said, \"Claudia always wondered
why you agreed to the plot against Giles. \"Was it because the Queen ...\" He stopped, not
knowing the words, but the Warden nodded without looking up.

\"Blackmail, Master Sapient. Her son was to be the one to marry Claudia. If I had not
agreed, she taunted me that she would tell Claudia publicly who she was, disgrace her
before the whole Realm. I could not have borne that.\"

For a moment there was a wistful distance in him, a stillness. Then he raised his head
and saw Jared's look and his face went cold. \"Do not feel sorry for me, Master. That's
something I do not need.\" He stood. \"I know she's gone into Incarceron. For this Finn.
There's nothing for you to betray. And she has taken the Key.\" He laughed bitterly. \"It's as
well she took it. There's no way out without it.\"

Suddenly he stalked to the door. \"Follow me.\"

Startled Jared stood, fighting down a shard of fear, but the Warden stepped out into the
corridor and waved the guards away impatiently. The men looked at each other.

One said uneasily, \"Sir, the Queen has issued orders that we stay with you. For your
protection.\"

The Warden nodded slowly. \"My protection. I see. Then please remain here and guard
this door after I enter. Allow no one to follow us down.\"


410
Before they could argue he had opened a hidden door in the wainscoting and led the way
down some dank steps into the cellars. Halfway down, Jared looked back. The men were
watching curiously through the slit.

\"It appears the Queen suspects me too,\" the Warden said calmly. He took a lantern from
the wall and lit the candle inside it. \"We will have to work quickly. The study, as you've no
doubt realized, is the same room here as at home. A space halfway between this world
and the Prison, a Portal, as the inventor Martor called it.\"

\"Manor's writings are lost,\" Jared said, hurrying after him.

\"I have them. They are classified.\" His dark figure paced down quickly, holding the lantern
high, its shadows flickering down the wall. He glanced back at Jared's astonishment and
allowed himself a smile. \"Y will never see them, Master.\" Between the casks the
                              ou
darkness lay deep; far above, the guards' voices seemed to whisper in confusion.

At the bronze gate he jabbed the combination in swiftly; the gate shuddered open and as
they passed through, Jared felt that odd shiver of displacement he had felt before.

The white room adjusted itself. Everything was exactly as he had left it. He had a sudden
pang of anxiety. What was happening to Claudia? Was she safe?

\"Y sent her through with no idea of the danger.\" The Warden flicked the control panel
  ou
out and touched sensors. \"Entering the Prison is hazardous, physically and
psychologically.\"

411
Shelves slid back. The screen lit.

On it, Jared saw a thousand images. They flickered, a checkerboard of tiny squares, of
empty rooms, bleak oceans, far towers, dusty corners. He saw a street packed with
people, a hideous den of stunted children, a man beating a strange beast, a woman
tenderly breastfeeding a baby. Bewildered, he stepped up below the images, watching
them flicker, the pain, the hunger, the unlikely friendships, the savage bargainings.

'This is the Prison.\" The \"warden leaned against the desk. \"All the images seen by the
Eyes. Its the only way to find Claudia.\"

Jared felt a terrible misery soak him. In the Academy the Experiment was considered one
of the glories of the ancient Sapienti, the noble sacrifice of the world's last reserves of
energy to save the unredeemable, the poor, the despised. And it had ended in this.


The Warden watched him, a silhouette against the rippling images. \"Y see, Master,
                                                                    ou
what only the Warden has ever seen.\"

\"Why didn't... Why weren't we told ...?\"

\"There is not enough power. They can never be brought back, all those thousands of
people. They are lost to us.\" He took out his watch and gave it to Jared, who took it
numbly and then looked down at it. The Warden indicated the silver cube on the chain.

\"Y are like a god, Jared. Y hold Incarceron in your hands.\"
  ou                       ou

He felt the pain inside him throb. His hands shook. He

412
wanted to put it down, to step back, step away. The cube was tiny, he had seen it a
thousand times on the watch chain and barely noticed it, but now it filled him with awe.
Was it possible it contained the mountains he saw, the forests of silver trees, the cities of
ragged people preying on each other's poverty? Sweating, he held it tightly and the
Warden said softly, \"Afraid, Jared? It takes strength to see a whole world. Many of my
predecessors never dared look. They hid their eyes.\" A soft bell.

They both looked up. The screen had stopped flashing; as they stared, the pictures
started to flick off, and one in the bottom right-hand corner grew, pixel by pixel, until it filled
the whole screen.

It was Claudia.

Jared put the watch chain shakily down on the table.

She was talking to the prisoners. He recognized the boy Finn, and the other one, Keiro,
who was leaning back against a stone wall, listening. Gildas crouched nearby; Jared saw
at once that the old man was hurt, Attia standing next to him.

\"Can you speak to them?\"

\"I can,\" the Warden said. \"But first we listen.\"

He flicked a switch.

What use is one key among a billion prisoners?

--Lord Calliston's Diary

***

\"It tried to stop me finding you,\" Claudia said. She walked toward him down the gloomy
corridor. \"Y should never have come Inside.\" Finn felt awed. She was so out of place,
             ou
bringing a scent of roses and strange fresh air that tantalized him. He felt he wanted to
scratch at some itch in his mind; instead he rubbed a hand wearily over his eyes.

\"Come back with me now.\" She held out her hand. \"Come quickly!\"

\"Y just wait a minute.\" Keiro stood. \"He goes nowhere without me.\"
  ou

\"Or me,\" Attia muttered.

\"All of you can come then. It must be possible.\" Then her face fell.

Finn said, \"What is it?\"

Claudia bit her lip. She suddenly realized she had no idea how to do this. There had been
no portal on this side, no chair or control panel; she had simply found herself in that empty
cell. And she didn't know the way back there, even if the place was important.

414
\"She can't do it,\" Keiro said. He came and stared closely at her, and though it annoyed
her, she stared calmly back.

\"At least I have this.\" She took the Key from a pocket and held it out. They saw it was
identical to the one they knew, though its workmanship seemed better, the eagle perfect
in its stillness.

Finn put his hand to his pocket. It was empty. Alarmed, he turned.

\"It's here, fool boy.\" Gildas grabbed at the wall and pulled himself upright. He was gray,
his face clammy. He held the Key so tightly in his knotted hands that the skin around his
knuckles was white as the bone beneath.


\"Are you really from the Outside?\" he breathed.

\"I am, Master.\" She walked toward him and reached out her hand for him to feel. \"And
Sapphique did Escape. Jared discovered that he has followers out there. They call him
the Nine-Fingered One.\"

He nodded, and they saw there were tears in his eyes. \"I know that. I have always known
that he was real. This boy has seen him in visions. Soon I will see him.\"

His voice was gruff but there was a quaver in it Finn had never heard before. Oddly
scared he said, \"We need the Key, Master.\"

For a moment he thought the Sapient would not let go; there was a brief interval when
both his and Gildas's fingers grasped the crystal. The old man looked down. \"I have
always trusted you, Finn. I never believed you were from Outside, and I was

415
wrong in that, but your visions of the stars have led us to Escape, as I knew they would,
ever since the first day I saw you lying curled up on that cart. This is the moment I have
lived for.\"

His fingers opened; Finn felt the weight of the Key.

He looked at Claudia. \"Now what?\"

She took a deep breath, but it was not her voice that answered. Attia was in the shadows
behind Keiro; she did not come forward, but her words were sharp. \"What happened to
the pretty dress?\"

Claudia scowled. \"I shredded it.\"

\"And the wedding?\"

\"Off.\"

Attia's arms were wrapped around her thin body. \"So now you want Finn.\"

\"Giles. His name is Giles. Y I want him. The Realm needs its King. Someone who's
                            es,
seen outside the Palace and the Protocol. Someone who has been right down into the
depths.\" She let her annoyance out in her words, channeled it into anger. \"Isn't that what
you want too? Someone who can end the misery of Incarceron because he knows what


it's like?\"

Attia shrugged. \"It's Finn you should ask. Y might just be taking him out of one prison
                                            ou
into another.\"

Claudia stared at her and Attia stared back. It was Keiro's cool laugh that broke the
silence. \"I suggest we sort all this out in the brave new world Outside. Before the Prison
quakes again.\"

416
Finn said, \"He's right. How do we do this?\"

She swallowed. \"Well ... I suppose we ... use the Keys.\"

\"But where's the gate?\"

\"There is no gate.\" This was hard; they were all staring at her. \"Not... as you think.\"

\"So how did you get here?\" Keiro asked.

\"It's ... difficult to explain.\" As she spoke her fingers moved on the hidden controls of the
Key; it hummed, lights moved inside it.

Keiro jumped forward. \"Oh no, Princess!\" He snatched it from her; she jerked after it, but
he had his sword drawn and pointed at her throat. \"No tricks. We all go together or not at
all.\"

Furious, she said, \"That's the plan.\"

\"Put the weapon down,\" Gildas snapped.

\"She's trying to take him. And leave us here.

\"I'm not--\"

\"Stop talking about me as if I was some object!\" Finn's snarl silenced them all. He rubbed
a hand through his hair; his scalp was wet and his eyes prickled. His breath seemed
short. A fit now would be impossible, but his hands were shaking and he felt it creeping
over him.

And then he knew he was falling into it, he must be, because behind Gildas the wall
shivered away, and looking out of it, huge and shadowy, was Blaize.


The Sapient's gray eyes surveyed them; his image was enormous in a white room of
clean walls. \"I'm afraid,\" he said, \"that

417
Escape is not as easy as my daughter seems to think.\"

They were still. Keiro lowered the sword. \"So that's it,\" he said. \"And look how pleased
she is to see you.\"

Finn watched Claudia turn to the image. He saw now that though the Warden's face was
familiar, the scabs had left it; it was thinner, and there was a refined tension about the
eyes.

Claudia looked up at it. \"Don't call me your daughter.\" Her voice was hard and cold. \"And
don't try to stop me. I'm bringing them all out and you--\"

\"Y can't bring them all out.\" The Warden held her eyes. \"The Key will bring only one
  ou
person out. Their copy, if it works, will do the same. Touch the black eye of the eagle. You
will disappear, and reappear here.\" He smiled calmly. \"That is the gate, Finn.\"

Appalled, she stared at him. \"You're lying. Y brought me out.
                                             ou

\"Y were a baby. Tiny. I took a chance.\" There was a voice in the room; he turned, and
  ou
Claudia saw Jared behind him, standing pale and tired. \"Master! Is it true?\"

\"I have no way of knowing, Claudia.\" He looked unhappy, his dark hair tangled. \"There's
only one way to find out, and that's to try.\"

She looked at Finn.

\"Not you.\" It was Keiro who moved. \"Finn and I are going first, and if it works I'll come
back for the Sapient.\" He whipped

418
up his sword as Claudia drew hers. \"Drop that, Princess, or I'll cut your throat.\"

She gripped the leather hilt tight, but Finn said, \"Do it, Claudia. Please.\"

He was looking at Keiro; as she lowered the blade she saw him step closer and say, \"Do
you really think I'd go and leave them? Give her back the Key.


\"No way.\"

\"Keiro ...\"

\"You're stupid, Finn. Can't you see this is a setup! Y and she would vanish and that
                                                      ou
would be it. No one would bother coming back for the rest of us.\"

\"I would.\"

\"They wouldn't let you.\" Keiro stepped up to him. \"Once they had their lost Prince, why
bother about the criminal Scum? The dog-girl and the halfman? Once you're back in your
palace, why think of us?\"

\"I swear I'd come back.\"

\"Sure. Isn't that what Sapphique said?\"

In the stillness Gildas sat down abruptly, as if his strength had gone. \"Don't leave me here,
Finn,\" he muttered.

Finn shook his head, utterly weary. \"We can't keep Claudia here, whatever the rest of us
decide. She came to rescue us.\"

\"Tough.\" Keiro's blue eyes were relentless. \"She was a Prisoner once--she can be again.
I go first. To find out what's waiting out there. And if it works, like I said, I'll come back.\"

419
\"Liar,\" Attia snapped.

\"Y can't stop me.\"
  ou

The Warden laughed softly. \"Is this the hero you think is Giles, Claudia? The man to
govern the Realm? He can't even control this rabble.\"

Instantly Finn moved. He tossed the Key to Claudia; catching Keiro off guard, he grabbed
for the sword. Anger roared in him; anger at all of them, at the Warden's smirk, at the fear
and weakness in himself. Keiro staggered back; recovering fast, he whipped the blade
up and they both had it; then Finn had torn it from his grip.

Keiro didn't flinch as the blade flickered in his face. \"Y won't use that on me.\"
                                                          ou

Finn's heart pounded. His chest heaved. Behind him Attia hissed, \"Why not, Finn? He


killed the Maestra. Y know that, you've always known it! He had the bridge cut. Not
                     ou
Jormanric.\"

\"Is it true?\" He barely recognized his own whisper.

Keiro smiled. \"Make up your own mind.\"

\"Tell me.\"

\"No.\" His oathbrother held the Key in one fist. \"It's your choice. I don't justify myself to
anyone.\"

His heartbeat was so loud, it hurt. It filled the Prison, thudded down all the corridors, in all
the cells.

He flung the sword down. Keiro dived for it, Finn kicked it away. Suddenly they were
fighting, all Finn's breath gone in a vicious punch to his stomach, Keiro's ruthless skill

420
flooring him. Claudia was shouting, Gildas roaring in anger, but he didn't care now;
scrambling up, he flung himself on Keiro, grabbing for the Key. Hindered by the fragile
crystal Keiro ducked and then punched again; Finn had him around the waist and down,
but as he closed in, Keiro gave a kick that sent him reeling back.

Keiro roiled, picked himself up. Blood welled on his lip. \"Now we'll see, brother,\" he
hissed. He touched the black eye of the bird.

A light.

It was so brilliant, it burned their eyes.

It widened around Keiro, it swallowed him, and there was a noise in it, a whine that was
painful, a sharp discordant note that cut off instantly.

The light spat out.

And Keiro was still there.

In the shattered silence the Warden's laugh was cool and regretful. \"Ah,\" he said. \"I'm
afraid that means it won't work for you. Probably the metal components in your body
render the process invalid. Incarceron is a closed system; its own elements can never
leave.\"


Keiro stood stock-still.

\"Never?\" he breathed.

\"Not unless the components are removed.\"

Keiro nodded. His face was grim and flushed. \"If that's what it takes.\" He stepped toward
Finn and said, \"Get your knife.\"

421
\"What?\"

\"Y heard\"
  ou

\"I can't do that!\"

Keiro laughed sourly- \"Why not? Keiro the Nine-Fingered. I always wondered what
Sapphique's sacrifice was all about.\"

Gildas groaned. \"Boy, are you suggesting--\"

\"Maybe more of us are born of the Prison than we thought. Maybe you are, old man. But I
won't let one finger keep me here. Get the knife.\"

Finn didn't move, but Attia did. She brought a small blade she always wore and held it out
to him. He took it slowly. Keiro laid his hand on the floor, the fingers spread out. The
metallic nail looked just the same as the others. \"Do it now,\" he said.

I can t...

\"Y can. For my sake.\"
  ou

They looked at each other. Finn knelt. His hand was shaking. He put the edge of the blade
to Keiro's skin.

\"Wait,\" Attia snapped. She crouched. \"Think! It may not be enough. As you said, none of
us know what we are made of inside. There must be another way.\"

Keiro's eyes were blue and blank with desperation. He hesitated.

For a long moment he stood there unmoving, and then he closed his hand and nodded


slowly. He looked down at the Key and held it out to Finn.

422
\"Then I'll have to find it. Enjoy your kingdom, brother. Rule well. Watch your back.\"

Finn was too shaken to answer. A distant hammering made them all look up.

\"What's that?\" Claudia asked.

Jared said quickly, \"It's here. Evian made his attempt and is dead. The Queen's guards
are at the door.\"

She stared at her father. He said, \"Y must come back, Claudia. Bring the boy. I need
                                     ou
him now.\"

\"Is he really Giles?\" she asked harshly.

The Warden's smile was wintry. \"He is now.\"

As his words ended the screen went blank. A ripple of movement ran down the corridor;
Finn looked around anxiously. Bricks clattered from the vault.

Then he looked up and saw the tiny red Eye whirr and click on him.

\"Oh yes,\" the voice said softly. \"You have all forgotten about me. And why should I let
any of my children go?\"

423

34
***

He woke and found them all around him. The old, lame, the diseased, the half-made

men. He hid his head and was filled with shame and anger. \"I have failed you,\" he said.

\"I have journeyed so far and I have failed.\"

\"Not so,\" they answered. \"There is a door we know a tiny, secret door. None of us dare
                                                 ,


crawl through, in case we die there. If you promise to come back for us, we will show
you.\"

Sapphique was lithe and slender. He looked at them with his dark eyes. \"Take me
there,\" he whispered.

--Legends of Sapphique

***

\"What happened?\" Jared gasped. \"The Prison has interfered,\" the Warden hissed with
fury. His fingers moved swiftly over the controls.

\"Well, stop it! Order it to--\"

\"I cannot make Incarceron obey me.\" The Warden glared at him. \"No one has done that
for centuries. The Prison rules, Master. I have no power over it.\" Then in a voice so low
Jared barely heard, \"It laughs at me.\"

424
Appalled, Jared stared at the blank screen. Outside, a fist pounded again on the bronze
doors. A voice thundered, \"Warden! Open this! The Queen demands your presence.\"

\"Evian made a poor job of his assassination,\" the Warden said. He glanced up. \"Don't
fear, they won't get in. Even with axes.\"

\"She thinks you were involved.\"

\"Maybe. It is a good excuse to be rid of me. There will be no marriage now.\"

Jared shook his head. \"Then were all finished.\"

\"In that case, Master, I could do with your help.\" The gray eyes were fixed on him. \"For
Claudia's sake we need to work together.\"

Jared nodded slowly. Trying to ignore the furious banging, he came around to the controls
and examined them carefully. \"This is so old. Many of the symbols are in the Sapient
tongue.\" He looked up. \"Let's try talking to Incarceron in the language of its makers.\"

***

THE PRISONQUAKE was swift and sudden. The floor buckled; walls crashed down. Finn


grabbed Keiro; together they fell back against a door that gave under their weight, flinging
them inside.

Claudia scrambled after them, but Attia said, \"Help me with him!\" She had Gildas
doubled up, gasping. Hurriedly Claudia climbed back, wriggled his arm over her
shoulders, and they struggled with him to the cell, where Finn hauled them in and

425
slammed the door tight, he and Keiro wedging it with a split timber.

Outside, rubble cascaded down and they listened to it in dismay. The corridor was surely
blocked.

\"But you do not think you can lock me out, I hope?\" Incarceron laughed its rumbling
laugh. \"No one can do that. I am inescapable. \"

\"Sapphique Escaped.\" Gildas's voice was a rasp of pain, but he spat the words out. His
hands clutched his chest; they shook uncontrollably. \"How did he do that then, without a
Key? Is there another way out, that only he discovered? A way so secret, so amazing, you
can't block it? A way needing no gate and no machinery? Is that it, Incarceron? Is that
what you fear, always watching, always listening?\"

\"I fear nothing.

\"Not what you told me,\" Claudia snapped. She was breathing hard; she glanced at Finn.
\"I must go back. Jared's in trouble. Will you come?\"

\"I can't leave them. Take the old man with you.\"

Gildas laughed: his body convulsed into wheezing gasps. Attia gripped his hands; then
she turned her head. \"He's dying,\" she whispered.-

\"Finn,\" the Sapient croaked.

Finn crouched down, sick with the prickling behind his eyes. Whatever injuries Gildas had
were internal, but the shiver of his hands, the sweat and pallor of his face were only too
clear.

426
The Sapient brought his mouth close to Finns ear. \"Show me the stars,\" he whispered.


Finn looked at the others. \"I can't...\"

\"Then allow me,\" the Prison said. The glimmer of light in the cell went out. One red Eye
was a spark in the corner of the wall. \"Look at this star, old man. This is the only star you
will ever see.\"

\"Stop tormenting him!\" Finn's howl of rage startled them all. And then to Claudia's
amazement he turned back to Gildas and clasped his hand. \"Come with me,\" he said. \"I'll
show you.\"

The dizziness of his mind swept over him and he let it. He walked deliberately into its
darkness and dragged the old man with him, and all around them the lake glimmered
under its floating lanterns, blue and purple and gold, and the boat rocked beneath him as
he lay in it and stated up at the stars.

They blazed in the summer night. Like silver dust they lay across the cosmos as if a great
hand had scattered them, and their mystery enchanted the velvety blackness.

Beside him, Finn felt the old mans awe.

\"These are the stars, Master. Whole worlds, far away, seeming tiny, but really huger than
anything we know.\"

Lake water lapped.

Gildas said, \"So far. So many!\"

A heron rose from the water with a graceful flap. On the shore the music sounded sweet;
voices laughed softly.

The old man said hoarsely, \"I have to go to them now, Finn.

427
I have to go and find Sapphique. He won't have been content, you know, just to be
Outside. Not once he had seen this.\"

Finn nodded. He felt the boat unmoor beneath him, the Hit and slip of the swell. He felt the
old man's fingers loosen in his. And as he stared at them, the stars grew and burned,
became flames, tiny flames on the tips of tiny candles, and he was blowing them out,
blowing at them with his whole breath, all his energy.

They vanished, and he laughed, a great laugh of triumph, and all the people around


laughed with him, the King in his red coat, and Bartlett, and his pale new stepmother, and
all the courtiers and nurses and musicians, and the little girl in the pretty white dress, the
girl who had come that day, that they said would be his special friend.

She was looking at him now. She said, \"Finn. Can you hear me?

Claudia.

***

\" IT'S READY .\" Jared looked up. \"Y speak, and the translation will be instant.\"
                                   ou

The \"warden had been pacing, listening to the voices outside; now he came and stood by
the desk, his arms folded.

\"Incarceron,\" he said.

Silence. Then, on the screen, a small red point of light. It was tiny, like a star. It gazed out
at them. It said, \"Who is this speaking the old tongue?\"

428
The voice was uncertain. It seemed to have lost some of its echoing rumble.

The Warden glanced at Jared. Then he said quietly, \"Y know who this is, my father. This
                                                     ou
is Sapphique.\"

Jared's eyes widened, but he stayed silent.

There was another silence. This time the Warden broke it. \"I speak to you in the language
of the Sapienti. I order you not to harm the boy Finn.\"

\"He has the Key. No prisoner is allowed to Escape.\"

\"But your anger may injure him. And Claudia.\" Had the Warden's voice changed as he
spoke her name? Jared wasn't sure.

A moment of stillness. Then, \"Very well. For you, my son.\"

The Warden made a sign to Jared to cut communications, but as his finger reached out to
the panel, the Prison said softly, \"But if you are indeed Sapphique, we have spoken
often before. You will remember.\"


\"That was long ago,\" the Warden said cautiously.

\"Yes. You gave me the Tribute I required. I hunted you and you thwarted me. You hid in
holes and stole my children's hearts. Tell me, Sapphique, how did you Escape from
me? After I struck you down, after the terrible fall through darkness, what doorway did
you find that I had overlooked? Through what crevice did you crawl? And where are you
now out there in the places I cannot even imagine?\"
   ,

The voice was wistful; the Warden looked up at the steady

429
Eye on the screen. He was hushed as he answered. \"That is a mystery I cannot reveal.\"

\"A pity. You see, they did not give me any way to see outside myself. Can you imagine,
Sapphique, you the wanderer, the great traveler, can you even dream of how it is to live
forever trapped in your own mind, watching only the creatures that inhabit it? They
made me powerful and they made me flawed. And only you, when you return, can help
me.\"

The Warden was still. Dry-mouthed, Jared flicked the switch. His hands were shaky and
damp with sweat. As he watched it, the Eye faded.

***

FINNS SIGHT was blurred and his whole body had emptied. He lay crooked; only Keiro's
arm kept his head off the floor. But for a moment, before the Prison stench crept back,
before the world surged in, he knew he was a prince and the son of a prince, that his
would was golden with sunlight, that he had ridden into a dark forest one morning in a
fairy tale and never ridden out again.

\"Drink some of this.\" Attia gave him water; he managed a swallow and coughed and tried
to sit up.

\"He gets worse,\" Keiro was saying to Claudia. \"This is what your father has done to him.\"

She ignored it and bent over Finn. \"The Prisonquake has stopped. It just went quiet.\"

\"Gildas?\" Finn muttered.

430
\"The old man's gone. He doesn't have to worry about Sapphique anymore.\" Keiro's voice


was gruff. Turning, Finn saw the Sapient lying in the rubble, his eyes closed, his body
curled, as if he slept. On his finger, loose and dull, as if Keiro had pushed it there in some
vain effort to save him, shone the last skull-ring.

\"What did you do?\" Claudia asked. \"He said ... odd things.\"

\"I showed him the way out.\" Finn felt raw, scraped clean. He didn't want to talk about it
now, not to tell them what he thought he had remembered, so he sat up slowly and said,
\"Y tried the ring on him?\"
   ou

\"It didn't work. He was right about that too. Maybe none of them ever worked.\" Keiro
pushed the Key into his hands. \"Go. Get out now. Get the Sapient to design a key to
spring me. And send someone back for the girl.\"

Finn looked at Attia. \"I'll come back myself. I swear.\"

Attia smiled, wan, but Keiro said, \"See you do. I don't want to be stuck with her.\"

\"And for you too. I'll get all the Sapienti in my kingdom on it. We made a vow, brother. Do
you think I've forgotten?\"

Keiro laughed. His handsome face was grimy and bruised, his hair dull with dirt, his fine
coat ruined. But he was the one, Finn thought, who looked like a prince. \"Maybe. Or
maybe this is your chance to be rid of me. Maybe you're afraid I'd kill you and take your
place. If you don't come back, believe me, I'll do it.\"

Finn smiled. For a moment they looked at each other across

431
the tilted cell, across the spilled manacles and shackles. Then Finn turned to Claudia.

\"Y first.\" She said,
  ou

\"Y will come?\"
  ou

\"Yes.\"

She looked at him, then the others. Quickly she touched the eye of the eagle and was
gone, in a brilliance that made them all gasp.

Finn looked down at the Key he held. \"I can't,\" he said. Attia smiled brightly. \"I trust you. I'll
be waiting.\" But his finger didn't move, paused above the eagle's dark eye, so she


reached over and pressed it for him.

CLAUDIA FOUND herself sitting in the chair amidst an uproar of voices and hammering.
Outside the gate Caspar was shouting, \"... under arrest for high treason. Warden! Can
you hear me?\" The bronze resounded to frenzied blows.

Her father took her hand and raised her to her feet. \"My dear. So where is our young
Prince?\"

Jared was watching the bronze gate buckle inward. He flashed a quick, glad glance at
Claudia.

Her hair was tangled, her face dirty. A strange smell hung around her. She said, \"Right
behind me.\"

FINN WAS sitting in a chair too, but this room was dark, a small cell, like the one he
remembered from long ago, ancient, the walls greasy with carved names.

432
Opposite him sat a slim dark-haired man. For a moment he thought this was Jared, and
then he knew who it was.

He looked around, confused. \"Where am I? Is this Outside?\"

Sapphique was sitting against the wall, knees drawn up. He said quietly, \"None of us
have much idea where we are. Perhaps all our lives we are too concerned with where,
and not enough with who.\"

Finn's fingers were tight on the crystal Key. \"Let me go,\" he breathed.

\"It's not me who's stopping you.\" Sapphique watched Finn and his eyes were dark and
the stars were points of light deep inside them. \"Don't forget us, Finn. Don't forget the
ones back there in the dark, the hungry and the broken, the murderers and thugs. There
are prisons within prisons, and they inhabit the deepest.\"

He stretched out his hand and took a length of chain from the wall; it clanked, rust flaking
off. He slipped his hands inside the links. \"Like you, I went out into the Realm. It wasn't
what I'd expected. And I made a promise too.\" He dropped the metal on the floor, an
enormous crash, and Finn saw the maimed finger. \"Maybe that's what's imprisoning you.\"

He turned sideways and beckoned. A shadow rose from behind him and walked forward,
and Finn stifled a cry, because it was the Maestra. She had the same tall, lanky walk, the


red hair, the scornful eyes. She stood looking down at Finn and he felt that a chain bound
him, fine and invisible and she

433
held the end of it, because he could not move hand or foot.

\"How can you be here?\" he whispered. \"Y fell.\"
                                       ou

\"Oh yes, I fell! Through realms and centuries. Like a bird with a broken wing. Like an
angel cast down.\" He could barely tell if it was her whisper or Sapphique's. But the anger
was hers. \"And that was all your fault.\"

\"I ...\" He wanted to blame Keiro, or Jormanric. Anyone. But he said, \"I know.\"

\"Remember it, Prince. Learn from it.\"

\"Are you alive?\" He was struck with the old shame; it made it hard to speak.

\"Incarceron doesn't waste anything. I'm alive in its depths, in its cells, the cells of its body.\"
I'm sorry.

She wrapped her coat about her with the old dignity. \"If you are, that's all I ask.\"

\"Will you keep him here?\" Sapphique murmured.

\"As he kept me?\" She laughed calmly. \"I don't need a ransom for my forgiveness. Good-
bye, scared boy. Guard my crystal Key.\"

The cell blurred and opened. He felt as if he were dragged through a blinding concussion
of stone and flesh; that huge wheels of iron rumbled over him, that he was opened and
closed, riven and mended.

He stood up from the chair and the dark figure held out a hand to steady him.

And this time it was Jared.

***

The gate shuddered.

\"Don't worry. It will never break.\" Calm, the Warden surveyed Finn. \"So this is the one you
think is Giles.\" She glared at him. \"Y should know.\" Finn stared around. The room was
                                        ou
so white it hurt, the glare of the lights making his eyes ache. The man he recognized as
Blaize laughed lightly, folding his arms. \"Actually, it doesn't matter whether he is or not.
Now you have him, you will have to make him Giles. Because only he stands between you
and disaster.\" Curious, he stepped closer to Finn. \"And what do you think, Prisoner? Who
do you think you are?\"

Finn felt shaky and filthy; suddenly he knew that his skin was grimed with dirt, that he
stank in this sterile room. \"I ... think I remember. The betrothal..

\"Are you sure? Or might it not be that these are memories

435
someone else had, that are now buried in you, filaments of thought trapped in borrowed
tissue, that the Prison built into you?\" He smiled his cold smile.

\"Once we could have found out,\" Claudia snapped. \"Before Protocol.\"

\"Yes.\" The Warden turned to her. \"And that problem I will leave to you.\"

Finn saw how pale she was, how angry. She said, \"All my life you let me believe I was
your daughter. And it was all a lie.\"

\"No.\"

\"Y Y selected me, you educated me, you formed me ... you even told me all that!
  es! ou
Created a creature that would be just what you wanted, that would be pliant and marry


whom you said and be what you wanted. What would have happened to me afterward?
Would poor Queen Claudia have met with an accident too, leaving only the Warden to be
Regent? Was that the plan?\"

He met her eyes, and his were clear and gray. \"If it was, I changed it because I grew to
love you.\" \"Liar!\"

Jared said unhappily, \"Claudia, I ...\" but the Warden held up his hand.

\"No Master, let me explain. I chose you, yes, and I freely admit at first you were a means
to an end. A squalling infant that I saw as rarely as possible. But as you grew, I came ... to
look forward to seeing you. To the way you curtsied to me,

436
showed me your work, were shy with me. And you have become dear to me.\"

She stared at him, not wanting to hear this, or believe it. She wanted to keep her anger
bright, newly minted like a coin.

He shrugged. \"I was not a good father. For that I am sorry.\"

In the stillness between them the hammering broke out again, even louder. Jared said
urgently, \"It hardly matters, sir, what you did or who this boy is. We are all condemned
now. There is no escape from death unless we all enter the Prison.\"

Finn muttered, \"I have to go back for Attia.\" He held out his hand to Claudia for the other
Key; she shook her head. \"Not you. I'll go back.\" Reaching out, she took the crystal copy
from him and compared the two. \"Who made this?\"

\"Lord Calliston. The Steel Wolf himself.\" The Warden stared at the crystal. \"I had often
wondered if the rumors were true, whether a copy existed, somewhere in the depths of
the Prison.\"

She moved her finger toward the panel, but he stopped her. \"Wait. First we must ensure
our own safety, or the girl will be better where she is.\"

Claudia looked at him. \"How can I ever trust you again?\"

\"Y must.\" He put a finger to his lips and nodded. Then, striding across the white cell, he
  ou
touched the door control and stood back.

Two soldiers fell headlong into the room. Behind them, the ram on chains swung at empty


air. Swords were drawn, sharp whispers of steel.

437
\"Do please enter,\" the Warden said graciously.

The Queen herself was there, Claudia saw with shock, wearing a dark cloak. Behind his
mother Caspar glared at her. 'I'll never forgive you,\" he snarled.

\"Be quiet.\" His mother stalked past him into the room, paused at the strange shiver of
energy at the threshold, then gazed around. \"Fascinating. So this is the Portal.\"

\"Indeed.\" The Warden bowed. \"I am happy to see you so well.\"

\"I very much doubt that.\" Sia stopped before Finn. She looked him up and down and her
face paled. She pressed her red lips tight.

\"Yes,\" the Warden said softly. \"Unfortunately a Prisoner has escaped.\"

Furious, she turned on him. \"Why have you done this? What treachery are you planning?\"

\"None. We can all come out of this safely. All of us. With no secrets spilled, no
assassinations. Watch me.\"

He strode to the control desk, touched a combination of controls, and stood back.
Claudia stared, because the wall blanked and showed an image that she took a moment
to recognize. In a vast room courtiers crowded in a buzz of scandal. Half-eaten food lay
ignored on huge tables. Servants gossiped in anxious huddles.

It was her wedding feast.

\"What are you doing?\" the Queen snapped, but it was too late. The Warden said,
\"Friends.\" Every head in the room

438
turned. Talk dried into a stillness of astonishment.

After a hundred years of Protocol the vast screen behind the throne had probably been
forgotten; now Finn stared out at the Court through a fringe of cobwebs, a film of grime.

\"Please forgive all the unfortunate confusions of the day,\" the \"warden said gravely. \"And I
beg all of you, ambassadors from Overseas, and courtiers, dukes and Sapienti, ladies


and dowagers all, to overlook this breach of Protocol. But a great day has dawned, and a
great wrong has been righted.\"

The Queen seemed too astounded to speak; Claudia almost felt the same. But she
moved; she grabbed Finns arm and hauled him close to her. They stood together facing
the bewildered, fascinated faces of the Court as her father said, \"Behold. The Prince we
thought was lost, the heir of his father, the hope of the Court, Giles, has returned to us.\"

A thousand eyes stared at Finn. He looked back, seeing in each one the pinpoint of light,
feeling their intense curiosity, their doubt, descend right into his soul. Was this how it
would be, to be King?

\"In her great wisdom the Queen found it necessary to conceal him in safe exile against a
conspiracy against his life,\" the Warden said smoothly. \"But at last, after many years, this
danger is ended. The plotters have failed, and are arrested. Everything is calm again.\"

He glanced once at the Queen; fury was in every inch of her upright back, but when she
spoke, her voice was pleasant

439
with happiness. \"My friends, I am so delighted! The \"warden and I have worked so hard to
counter this threat. I want you to prepare the banquet now, for the Prince's coming. Instead
of a wedding, a great homecoming, but still a wonderful day, just as we planned.\"

The Court was silent. Then, from the back, a ragged cheer began.

She jerked her head; the Warden touched the panel. The screen dimmed.

She took a deep breath. \"I will never, never forgive you for this,\" she said evenly.

\"I know.\" John Arlex flicked another switch idly. He sat, and crossed one leg over another,
his dark brocaded coat shimmering, and then he reached out and took both Keys from
where Claudia had placed them and held them glinting in his hands.

\"Such small bright crystals,\" he murmured. \"And such power contained in them! I
suppose, Claudia, my dear, that if one cannot be the master of one world, one should find
another world to conquer.\" He glanced at Jared. \"I leave her to you, Master. Remember
our talk.\"

Jared's eyes widened; he cried, \"Claudia!\" but she already knew what was happening.
Her father was sitting in the chair of the Portal--she knew she should run forward, dart
forward and snatch the Keys from him, but she couldn't move, as if the power of his


terrible will kept her frozen.

Her father smiled. \"Do excuse me, Majesty. I think I would

440
be a specter at this feast.\" His ringers touched the panel.

A brilliance exploded in the room, making them all flinch; then the chair was empty,
spinning slightly in the white room, and as they stared at it a spark spat in the controls,
then another. Acrid smoke rose; the Queen clenched her fists and screamed at the
emptiness, \"Y can't do this!\"
              ou

Claudia was staring at the chair; as it imploded into flame, Jared tugged her hastily back.
She said bleakly, \"He can. He has.\"

Jared watched her. Her eyes were overbright, her face flushed, but her head was high.
The Queen raged with anger, stabbing every button and causing only explosions. As she
swept out with Caspar running at her heels, Jared said, \"He'll come back, Claudia. I'm
sure ...\"

\"It's nothing to me what he does.\" She turned to Finn, who was staring aghast at her.

\"Attia,\" he whispered. \"What about Attia? I promised to go back for her!\"

\"It's not possible ...\"

He shook his head. \"Y don't understand. I have to! I can't leave them there. Especially
                     ou
not Keiro.\" He was appalled. \"Keiro will never forgive me. I promised.\"

\"We'll find a way. Jared will find one. Even if it takes years. That's my promise to you.\"
She grabbed his hand and pushed the frayed sleeve up to show the eagle mark. \"But you
must think about this now. Y ou're here. You're Outside and you're free. Of them, of all of
that. And we have to

441
make this work, because Sia will always be there, plotting behind our backs.\"

Bewildered, he stared at her and realized she had no idea of what he had lost. \"Keiro is
my brother.\"

\"I'll do all I can,\" Jared said quietly. \"There must be another way. Y father came and
                                                                      our


went as Blaize. And Sapphique found it.\"

Finn raised his head and gave him a strange look. \"Y He did.\"
                                                    es.

Claudia took his arm. \"We have to go out there now,\" she said quietly. \"Y have to lift
                                                                             ou
your head up and be a prince. It won't be like you expect. But everything is acting here. A
game, my father calls it. Are you ready?\"

He felt the old fear wash over him. He felt he was walking into a great ambush that had
been set for him. But he nodded.

Arm in arm, they walked out of the white room, and Claudia led him up through the cellars
and the stairs. He passed through chambers of crowding, staring people. She opened a
door and he cried out in delight, because the world was a garden and above it, brilliant
and blazing, hung the stars, millions of them, higher and higher, above the pinnacles of the
Palace, and the trees, and the sweet beds of flowers.

\"I knew,\" he whispered. \"I always knew.\"

LEFT ALONE, Jared gazed around at the ruins of the Portal. The Wardens sabotage
looked only too thorough. He had

441

442
spoken kindly to the boy, but in his heart he felt a deep dread, because to find a way back
through this destruction would take time, and how much time did he have?

\"Y were too much for us, Warden,\" he murmured aloud.
  ou

He climbed up after them, weary now, his chest aching. Servants ran past him; talk
echoed in every chamber and hall. He hurried, stepping out into the gardens, glad of the
evening cool, the sweet scents.

Claudia and Finn stood on the steps of the building. The boy looked as if he was blind
with the glory of the night, as if its purity was an agony to him.

Beside them, Jared slipped his hand into his pocket and brought out the watch. Claudia
stared. \"Isn't that...?\"

\"Y Y father's.\"
  es. our


\"He gave it to you?\"

\"Y might say that.\" And he held it in his delicate fingers, and she noticed, as if for the
   ou
first time, that there was a tiny silver cube hanging on its chain, a charm that twisted and
glittered in the starlight.

\"But where are they?\" Finn asked, tormented. \"Keiro and Attia and the Prison?\"

Jared gazed at the cube thoughtfully. \"Closer than you think, Finn,\" he said.
