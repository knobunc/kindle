It took scores of tons of manure per acre to grow great crops. Manure gathering and handling grew into a small industry, employing thousands of workers who scoured the countryside for cow and pig excrement, cleared city streets of horse manure, and then sold it by the stinking ton to farmers and gardeners. There was never enough. A heavy application of manure helped for a season or two, but then the fertility of the soil declined and more was needed. In the most intensively cultivated land in Europe\x{2014}the Marais district of Paris\x{2014}owners of small city-garden plots applied dung at rates as high as hundreds of tons per acre, and every year they had to repeat the process. By <<1700|9:0>> or so, hungry Europeans were experimenting with other soil additives in an attempt to increase their yields, trying sea salt, powdered limestone, burned bones, rotting fish, anything that might keep their soils producing.",

After a few days, the number of protesters around the Santa Maria schoolyard grew to somewhere between six thousand and twenty thousand workers and family members, depending on whether you use the figures given by newspapermen, government officials, or labor activists. It appears they were entirely peaceful. A strike committee was set up, and people spent their time talking, educating one another, and planning next steps. There was something of a holiday atmosphere; instead of backbreaking labor, the strikers got to rest, eat, and listen. The strikers were impressed by the power of their own numbers. For a few days there was a sense that the sheer presence of so many workers, plus a firm refusal to leave Iquique until they were heard, would result, finally, in the end to the fichas, or better wages, or some kind of movement by the owners.',

Two-thirds of the income came from Bosch\x{2019}s ammonia plants. There was money to pump into research and development, and money to invest in improving Oppau and Leuna. Every refinement made in the plants led to smoother production, greater automation, and higher profits. It happened just in time. Bosch had the best ammonia plants in the world, but they were no longer the only ones. The French now had a Haber-Bosch plant, the fruits of Bosch\x{2019}s secret negotiations at Versailles, which they were learning how to run without German help. It did not take long for the technology to start working its way to other nations. The British, who had been negotiating with BASF to license the technology, found it more expedient to deal with two Alsatian engineers who had appeared in London in 1920 and approached the London chemical firm of Brunner Mond, claiming that they knew all about Haber-Bosch\x{2014}and were willing to sell what they knew. \x{201c}The legality of their offer was, to say the least of it, doubtful,\x{201d} wrote a historian of British chemistry.

The British chemical company\x{2019}s executives considered their reputations, the legality of what was being offered, and the reliability of K and A.
