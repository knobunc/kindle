He\x{2019}d done equally well there, rising steadily in seniority, only to be shifted back to Treasury when Rob Pierre nominated Avram Turner to drive through his enormous economic reform package. Giancola\x{2019}s new position had brought him back to his old Nouveau Paris neighborhood, where he\x{2019}d prospered despite the pain and economic dislocation involved in the Turner Reforms. He was, after all, an effective administrator who possessed an undeniable talent for attracting the loyalty of his subordinates, and he\x{2019}d done his level best to minimize the reforms\x{2019} traumas for the citizens for whom he was responsible. As a result, he\x{2019}d emerged from the Committee\x{2019}s downfall with a base of genuine popular support-quite a large one, actually-on the Republic\x{2019}s capital (and most populous) planet.",
