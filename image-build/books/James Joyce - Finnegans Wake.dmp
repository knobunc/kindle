            "A zoom-lens shot of world history reveals Irish history. History is a strange object for contemplation since it is both a body of writing that has been formed in very specific ways according to the demands of certain principles \x{2013} objectivity, the need to defend a particular position and so on \x{2013} and yet it is also that unprocessed material that cannot be reached except through the activity of the writing that processes it. Irish historiography is a case in point. The British versions of Irish history and the Irish versions, however different they may be, share the same assumption \x{2013} that there is a story to be told about the people who lived on the island of Ireland and that each \x{2018}age\x{2019} is an unfolding of a chapter in the long saga. The question of periodization is important. It is one of the structuring principles in the Wake and it is the more so because Joyce had seen the transformation of Ireland in the period 1916\x{2013}22 from a colony and a constitutional part of the United Kingdom into two states, the new Irish Free State and the equally new statelet or province of Northern Ireland, still a part of the United Kingdom. In other words, the contemporary period of Irish history, from <<1922|9c:0>>, the date of the Treaty that effected the transformation (and the date of the publication of Ulysses) and the beginning of the Second World War, is coincident with and absorbed deeply into the composition of Finnegans Wake. So arcane a work seems, by virtue of its obscure and hermetic nature, to be far removed from history and politics. Yet this is a deceptive appearance. History and politics, especially in their contemporary forms, provided startling examples of the ways in which a miscellaneous series of events could be converted into an historical pattern and could even be regarded as the final completion of a pattern that had been forming slowly over the centuries. In historical writing, as in literature, there are canonical interpretations. Joyce includes these in order to inspect their authority and give voice to their tacit assumptions. The assurance of historical interpretation is destroyed by the disintegration of the language that was both created by and creator of that assurance. Many of the disputes in the Wake involve assaults on and defences of language; the most important division is that between male, patriarchal language that is always seeking to impose order on diverse materials and female language that revels in heterogeneity and ridicules authority. By transmuting the philosophical problem of historical (or any) writing into a gender division, Joyce finds a point of vantage that includes colonial oppression, the canonization of authority and the authorizing of canonicity, the relationship between fully formed language and the inchoate sounds from which it is derived and over which it is constantly reasserting itself. Ultimately, he also finds here the comprehensive figure for self-division, for a broken world in which the masculine and the feminine are separated, the first made dominant over the second, with the consequent and subsequent neuroses, rebellions, maimings and nightmares. Still, the Wake does not offer a reconciliation between masculine and feminine languages or divisions. Were there to be such, then (the implication would seem to be) there would no longer be history or narrative. For then we would not have to suffer any longer the consequences of the Fall into language. We would be redeemed back to that original directness of knowledge that preceded language, the mark of our inescapable secondariness. The secondariness of language is reproduced in every other form of secondariness that the world knows, most particularly the secondariness of female against male and thereafter all the varieties of oppression of which this is the most basic and enduring.",

            "Balkelly and Patholic cannot be taken as \x{2018}characters\x{2019} in this set piece. Equally, Joyce is not seeking to achieve the sculptured \x{2018}style\x{2019} that had distinguished Dubliners and Portrait. He is authorizing the language but he is opposing the monochromatic \x{2018}Patholic\x{2019} voice of the traditional author who would rinse the world of its colour by authoring it, by making it conform to his doctrinally defined self. The distinction between authorizing and authoring (\x{2018}genuine authorship and holusbolus authoritativeness\x{2019}, FW, 118.3\x{2014}4) is so fine that it often becomes blurred. Joyce is like the deconstructionists of our own time in that he can indicate the virtual existence of a site or condition of otherness that he cannot wholly (or perhaps at all) possess. But this is inescapably a function of the position adopted. Everything is relativized, including the statement that it is so, in an endless, ludic regress. The Wake is the most recognizable of all \x{2018}styles\x{2019} because it has no \x{2018}style\x{2019} as such. Like the Irish material that inseminates so much of its activity, it is \x{2018}a collideorscape!\x{2019} (FW, 143.28). The triteness of the particular that contains the universal, of \x{2018}the same told of all\x{2019} (FW, <<18.19|9p>>\x{2014}20), is the source of the work\x{2019}s extravagance, its mingling of finicky, precise systems of ordering (e.g. the frequent listings of seven items, the variations played on a thousand and one, as in the ten thunderwords that make one word of a thousand and one letters, etc.) and anarchic disorder. The tedium of the book, its frequently announced sameness (\x{2018}one thousand and one stories, all told, of the same\x{2019}, FW, <<5.28|9p>>\x{2014}9) is also part of its fascination. It is both a chaos and a cosmos, \x{2018}the chaosmos of Alle\x{2019} (FW, 118.21).",

            "It is proper that such a book should be concerned so radically with authoring and authority, with origin and repetition, with liberation and repression. From the start \x{2013} if the first page can be called the start, since its opening sentence really begins on the last page \x{2013} we are told that none of the events referred to have yet happened. More precisely, they have not yet happened again. Sir Tristram has not yet again arrived (\x{2018}had passencore rearrived\x{2019}). We are before history and yet within a history that has happened over and over. The hundred letter word, signifying thunder and the Fall, or the double Fall, since there was a war in heaven and a Luciferian Fall before there was a human Fall and war on earth, is a kind of molten Ur-language that will flow into the various mouldings of diverse languages, its noise formed into sounds and the sounds assuming to themselves the property of signification. \x{2018}Bygmester Finnegan, of the Stuttering Hand\x{2019} (FW, <<4.18|5a:1>>), we are told, \x{2018}lived\x{2026} toofarback\x{2019} before the Old Testament was written, before there were documentary records. That is, he lived back in the timeless zone of the unconscious, just as he lived in the back of his house above the pub and as he mimed the advice given to all Irish people by Sir Samuel Ferguson, one of the leaders of the Irish cultural revival of the 1830s, to \x{2018}live back in the country they live in\x{2019} in order to regain their identity. Like Milton at the opening of Paradise Lost, Joyce is confronting the impossibility of writing, an activity that is the product of history (and also the producer of history), about that which is prior to history, even though the idea of priority is, in such a double-bounded context, itself historical. From the \x{2018}beginning\x{2019}, there is no beginning. But even the Wake has to start somewhere. So it starts at the end and by its famous \x{2018}commodius vicus of recirculation\x{2019} leads us into the second sentence in which history has not yet begun to happen twice.",

            "James Joyce was born in Dublin on 2 February 1882. He was the oldest often children in a family which, after brief prosperity, collapsed into poverty. He was none the less educated at the best Jesuit schools and then at University College, Dublin, where he gave proof of his extraordinary talent. In 1902, following his graduation, he went to Paris, thinking he might attend medical school there. But he soon gave up attending lectures and devoted himself to writing poems and prose sketches and formulating an \x{2018}aesthetic system\x{2019}. Recalled to Dublin in April 1903 because of the fatal illness of his mother, he circled slowly towards his literary career. During the summer of 1904 he met a young woman from Galway, Nora Barnacle, and persuaded her to go with him to the Continent, where he planned to teach English. The young couple spent a few months in Pola (now in Croatia), then in 1905 moved to Trieste, where, except for seven months in Rome and three trips to Dublin, they lived until June 1915. They had two children, a son and a daughter. Joyce\x{2019}s first book, the poems of Chamber Music, was published in London in 1907 and Dubliners, a book of stories, in 1914. Italy\x{2019}s entrance into the First World War obliged Joyce to move to Z\x{fc}rich, where he remained until <<1919|9c:0>>. During this period he published A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and Exiles, a play (1918). After a brief return to Trieste following the armistice, Joyce determined to move to Paris so as to arrange more easily for the publication of Ulysses, a book on which he had been working since 1914. It was, in fact, published on his birthday in Paris in 1922 and brought him international fame. The same year he began work on Finnegans Wake, and though much harassed by eye troubles and deeply affected by his daughter\x{2019}s mental illness, he completed and published that book in 1939. After the outbreak of the Second World War, he went to live in unoccupied France, then managed to secure permission, in December 1940, to return to Z\x{fc}rich, where he died on 13 January 1941. He was buried in the Fluntern Cemetery.",

Whalebones and buskbutts may hurt you (thwackaway thwuck!) but never lay bare your breast secret (dickette\x{2019}s place!) to joy a Jonas in the Dolphin\x{2019}s Barncar with your meetual fan, Doveyed Covetfilles, comepulsing paynattention spasms between the averthisment for Ulikah\x{2019}s wine and a pair of pulldoors of the old cupiosity shape. There you\x{2019}ll fix your eyes darkled on the autocart of the bringfast cable but here till youre martimorphysed please sit still face to face. For if the shorth of your skorth falls down to his knees pray how wrong will he look till he rises? Not before Gravesend is commuted. But now reappears Autist Algy, the pulcherman and would-do performer, oleas Mr Smuth, stated by the vice crusaders to be well known to all the dallytaunties in and near the ciudad of Buellas Arias, taking you to the playguehouse to see the Smirching of Venus and asking with whispered offers in a very low bearded voice, with a nice little tiny manner and in a very nice little tony way, won\x{2019}t you be an artist\x{2019}s moral and pose in your nudies as a local esthetic before voluble old masters, introducing you, left to right the party comprises, to hogarths like Bottisilly and Titteretto and Vergognese and Coraggio with their extrahand Mazzaccio, plus the usual bilker\x{2019}s dozen of dowdycameramen. And the volses of lewd Buylan, for innocence! And the phyllisophies of Bussup Bulkeley. O, the frecklessness of the giddies nouveautays. There\x{2019}s many\x{2019}s the icepolled globetopper is haunted by the hottest spot under his equator like Ramrod, the meaty hunter, always jaeger for a thrust. The back beautiful, the undraped divine! And Suzy\x{2019}s Moedl\x{2019}s with their Blue Danuboyes! All blah! Viper\x{2019}s vapid vilest! Put off the old man at the very font and get right on with the nutty sparker round the back. Slip your oval out of touch and let the paravis be your goal. Up leather, Prunella, convert your try! Stick wicks in your earshells when you hear the prompter\x{2019}s voice. Look on a boa in his beauty and you\x{2019}ll never more wear your strawberry leaves. Rely on the relic. What bondman ever you bind on earth I\x{2019}ll be bound \x{2019}twas combined in hemel. Keep airly hores and the worm is yores. Dress the pussy for her nighty and follow her piggytails up their way to Winkyland. See little poupeep she\x{2019}s firsht ashleep. After having sat your poetries and you know what happens when chine throws over jupan. Go to doss with the poulterer, you understand, and shake up with the milchmand. The Sully van vultures are on the prowl. And the hailies fingringmaries. Tobaccos tabu and toboggan\x{2019}s a back seat. Secret satieties and onanymous letters make the great unwatched as bad as their betters. Don\x{2019}t on any account acquire a paunchon for that alltoocommon fagbutt habit of frequenting and chumming together with the braces of couples in Mr Tunnelly\x{2019}s hallways (smash it) wriggling with lowcusses and cockchafers and vamps and rodants, with the end to commit acts of interstipital indecency as between twineties and tapegarters, fingerpats on fondlepets, under the couvrefeu act. It\x{2019}s the thin end; wedge your steps. Your high powered hefty hoyden thinks nothing of ramping through a whole suite of smokeless husbands. Three minutes I\x{2019}m counting you. Woooooon. No triching now! Give me that when I tell you! Ragazza ladra! And is that any place to be smuggling his madam\x{2019}s apples up? Deceitful jade. Gee wedge! Begor, I like the way they\x{2019}re half cooked. Hold, flay, grill, fire that laney feeling for kosenkissing disgenically within the proscribed limits like Population Peg on a hint or twim clandestinely does be doing to Temptation Tom, atkings questions in barely and snakking svarewords like a nursemagd. While there\x{2019}s men-o\x{2019}war on the say there\x{2019}ll be loves-o\x{2019}women on the do. Love through the usual channels, cisternbrothelly, when properly disinfected and taken neat in the generable way upon retiring to roost in the company of a husband-in-law or other respectable relative of an apposite sex, not love that leads by the nose as I foresmellt but canalised love, you understand, does a felon good, suspiciously if he has a slugger\x{2019}s liver but I cannot belabour the point too ardently (and after the lessions of experience I speak from inspiration) that fetid spirits is the thief of prurities, so none of your twenty rod cherrywhisks, me daughter. At the Cat and Coney or the Spotted Dog. And at 2bis Lot\x{2019}s Road. When parties get tight for each other they lose all respect together. By the stench of her fizzle and the glib of her gab know the drunken draggletail Dublin drab. You\x{2019}ll pay for each bally sorraday night every billing sumday morning. When the night is in May and the moon shines might. We won\x{2019}t meeth in Navan till you try to give the Kellsfrieclub the goby. Hill or hollow, Hull or Hague! And beware how you dare of wet cocktails in Kildare or the same may see your wedding driving home from your wake. Mades of ashens when you flirt spoil the lad but spare his shirt. Lay your lilylike long his shoulder but buck back if he buts bolder and just hep your homely hop and heed no horning but if you\x{2019}ve got some brainy notion to raise cancan and rouse commotion I\x{2019}ll be apt to flail that tail for you till it\x{2019}s borning. Let the love ladleliked at the eye girde your gastricks in the gym. Nor must you omit to screw the lid firmly on that jazz jiggery and kick starts. Bumping races on the flat and point to point over obstacles. Ridewheeling that acclivisciously up windy Rutland Rise and insighting rebellious northers before the saunter of the city of Dunlob. Then breretonbiking on the free with your airs of go-be-dee and your heels upon the handlebars. Berrboel brazenness! No, before your corselage rib is decartilaged, that is to mean if you have visceral ptossis, my point is making allowances for the fads of your weak abdominal wall and your liver asprewl, vinvin, vinvin, or should you feel, in shorts, as though you needed healthy physicking exorcise to flush your kidneys, you understand, and move that twelffinger bowel and threadworm inhibitating it, lassy, and perspire freely, lict your lector in the lobby and why out you go by the ostiary on to the dirt track and skip. Be a sportive. Deal with Nature the great greengrocer and pay regularly the monthlies. Your Punt\x{2019}s Perfume\x{2019}s only in the hatpinny shop beside the reek of the rawny. It\x{2019}s more important than air\x{2014}I mean than eats\x{2014}air (Oop, I never open momouth but I pack mefood in it) and promotes that natural emotion. Stamp out bad eggs. Why so many puddings prove disappointing, as Dietician says, in Creature Comforts Causeries, and why so much soup is so muck slop. If we could fatten on the elizabeetons we wouldn\x{2019}t have teeth like the hippopotamians. However. Likewise if I were in your envelope shirt I\x{2019}d keep my weathereye well cocked open for your furnished lodgers paying for their feed on tally with company and piano tunes. Only stuprifying yourself! The too friendly friend sort, Mazourikawitch or some other sukinsin of a vitch, who he\x{2019}s kommen from olt Pannonia on this porpoise whom sue stooderin about the maul and femurl artickles and who mix himself so at home mid the musik and spanks the ivory that lovely for this your Mistro Melosiosus MacShine MacShane may soon prove your undoing and bane through the succeeding years of rain should you, whilst Jaun is from home, get used to basking in his loverslowlap, inordinately clad, moustacheteasing, when closehended together behind locked doors, kissing steadily, (malbongusta, it\x{2019}s not the thing you know) with the calfloving selfseeker, under the influence of woman, inching up to you, disarranging your modesties and fumbling with his forte paws in your bodice after your billy doos twy as a first go off (take care, would you stray and split on me!) and going on doing his idiot every time you gave him his chance to get thick and play piggly-wiggly, making much of you, bilgetalking like a ditherer, gougouzoug, about your glad neck and the round globe and the white milk and the red raspberries (O horrifier!) and prying down furthermore to chance his lucky arm with his pregnant questions up to our past lives. What has that caught to sing with him? The next fling you\x{2019}ll be squitting on the Tubber Nakel, pouring pitchers to the well for old Gloatsdane\x{2019}s glorification and the postequities of the Black Watch, peeping private from the Bush and Rangers. And our local busybody, talker-go-bragk. Worse again! Off of that praying fan on to them priars! It would be a whorable state of affairs altogether for the redcolumnists of presswritten epics, Peter Paragraph and Paulus Puff, (I\x{2019}m keepsoaking them to cover my concerts) to get ahold of for their balloons and shoot you private by surprise, considering the marriage slump that\x{2019}s on this oil age and pulexes three shillings a pint and wives at <<six|9c:1>> and <<seven|91:1>> when domestic calamities belame par and newlaids bellow mar for the twenty twotoosent time thwealthy took thousands in the slack march of civilisation were you, becoming guilty of unleckylike intoxication to have and to hold, to pig and to pay direct connection qua intervener with a prominent married member of the vicereeking squad and in consequence of the therinunder subpenas be flummoxed to the second degree by becoming a detestificated companykeeper on the dammymonde of Lucalamplight. Anything but that, for the fear and love of gold! Once and for all, I\x{2019}ll have no college swankies (you see, I am well voiced in love\x{2019}s arsenal and all its overtures from collion boys to colleen bawns so I have every reason to know that rogues\x{2019} gallery of nightbirds and bitchfanciers, lucky duffs and light lindsays, haughty hamiltons and gay gordons, dosed, doctored and otherwise, messing around skirts and what their fickling intentions look like, you make up your mind to that) trespassing on your danger zone in the dancer years. If ever I catch you at it, mind, it\x{2019}s you that will cocottch it! I\x{2019}ll tackle you to feel if you have a few devils in you. Holy gun, I\x{2019}ll give it to you, hot, high and heavy before you can say sedro! Or may the maledictions of Lousyfear fall like nettlerash on the white friar\x{2019}s father that converted from moonshine the fostermother of the first nancy-free that ran off after the trumpadour that mangled Moore\x{2019}s melodies and so upturned the tubshead of the stardaft journalwriter to inspire the prime finisher to fellhim the firtree out of which Cooper Funnymore planed the flat of the beerbarrel on which my grandydad\x{2019}s lustiest sat his seat of unwisdom with my tante\x{2019}s petted sister for the cause of his joy!

But I\x{2019}m not for forgetting me innerman monophone for I\x{2019}m leaving my darling proxy behind for your consolering, lost Dave the Dancekerl, a squamous runaway and a dear old man pal of mine too. He will arrive incessantly in the fraction of a crust, who, could he quit doubling and stop tippling, he would be the unicorn of his kind. He\x{2019}s the mightiest penumbrella I ever flourished on behond the shadow of a post! Be sure and link him, me O treasauro, as often as you learn provided there\x{2019}s nothing between you but a plain deal table only don\x{2019}t encourage him to cry lessontimes over Leperstown. But soft! Can\x{2019}t be? Do mailstanes mumble? Lumtum lumtum! Now! The froubadour! I fremble! Talk of wolf in a stomach by all that\x{2019}s verminous! Eccolo me! The return of th\x{2019}athlate! Who can secede to his success! Isn\x{2019}t Jaunstown, Ousterrike, the small place after all? I knew I smelt the garlic leek! Why, bless me swits, here he its, darling Dave, like the catoninelives just in time as if he fell out of space, all draped in mufti, coming home to mourn mountains from his old continence and not on one foot either or on two feet aether but on quinquisecular cycles after his French evolution and a blindfold passage by the <<4.32|5a:1>> with the pork\x{2019}s pate in his suicide paw and the gulls laughing lime on his natural skunk, blushing like Pat\x{2019}s pig, begob. He\x{2019}s not too timtom well ashamed to carry out onaglibtograbakelly in his showman\x{2019}s sinister the testymonicals he gave his twenty annis orf, showing the three white feathers, as a home cured emigrant in Paddyouare far below on our sealevel.

That\x{2019}s his little veiniality. And his unpeppeppediment. He has novel ideas I know and he\x{2019}s a jarry queer fish betimes, I grant you, and cantanberous, the poisoner of his word, but lice and all and semicoloured stainedglasses, I\x{2019}m enormously full of that foreigner, I\x{2019}ll say I am! Got by the one goat, suckled by the same nanna, one twitch, one nature makes us oldworld kin. We\x{2019}re as thick and thin now as two tubular jawballs. I hate him about his patent henesy, plasfh it, yet am I amorist. I love him. I love his old portugal\x{2019}s nose. There\x{2019}s the nasturtium for ye now that saved manny a poor sinker from water on the grave. The diasporation of all pirates and quinconcentrum of a fake like Basilius O\x{2019}Cormacan MacArty? To camiflag he turned his shirt. Isn\x{2019}t he after borrowing all before him, making friends with everybody red in Rossya, white in Alba and touching every distinguished Ourishman he could ever distinguish before or behind from a Yourishman for the customary halp of a crown and peace? He is looking aged with his pebbled eyes, and johnnythin too, from livicking on pidgins\x{2019} ifs with puffins\x{2019} ands, he\x{2019}s been slanderising himself, but I pass no remark. Hope he hasn\x{2019}t the cholera. Give him an eyot in the farout. Moseses and Noasies, how are you? He\x{2019}d be as snug as Columbsisle Jonas wrocked in the belly of the whaves, as quotad before.

Sure there\x{2019}s nobody else in touch anysides to hold a chef\x{2019}s cankle to the darling at all for sheer dare with that prison-potstill of Spanish breans on him like the knave of trifles!

It\x{2019}s a pity he can\x{2019}t see it for I\x{2019}m terribly nice about him. Canwyll y Cymry, the marmade\x{2019}s flamme! A leal of the O\x{2019}Looniys, a Brazel aboo! The most omportent man! Shervos! Ho, be the holy, snakes, someone has shaved his rough diamond skull for him as clean as Nuntius\x{2019} piedish! The burnt out mesh and the matting and all! Thunderweather, khyber schinker escapa sansa pagar. He\x{2019}s the spatton spit, so he is, scaly skin and all, with his blackguarded eye, and the goatsbeard in his buttinghole of Shemuel Tulliver, me grandsourd, the old cruxader, when he off with his paudeen! That was to let the crowd of the Flu Flux Fans behind him see me proper. Ah, he\x{2019}s very thoughtful and sympatrico that way is Brother Intelligentius, when he\x{2019}s not absintheminded, with his Paris addresse! He is, really.

Embrace her bashfully by almeans at my frank incensive and tell her in your semiological agglutinative yez, how Idos be asking after her. Let us be holy and evil and let her be peace on the bough. Sure, she fell in line with our tripertight photos as the lyonised mails when we were stablelads together like the corks again brothers, hungry and angry, cavileer grace by roundhered force, or like boyrun to sibster, me and you, shinners true and pinchme, our tertius quiddus, that never talked or listened. Always raving how we had the wrinkles of a snailcharmer, and the slits and sniffers of a fellow that fell foul of the county de Loona and the meattrap of the first vegetarian. To be had for the asking. Have a hug! Take her out of poor tuppeny luck before she goes off in pure treple licquidance. I\x{2019}d give three shillings a pullet to the canon for the conjugation to shadow you kissing her from me leberally all over as if she was a crucifix. It\x{2019}s good for her bilabials, you understand. There\x{2019}s nothing like the mistletouch for finding a queen\x{2019}s earring false. Chink chink.

No martyr where the preature is there\x{2019}s no plagues like rome. It gives up the gripes. Watch the swansway. Take your tiger over it. The leady on the lake and the convict of the forest. Why, they might be Babau and Momie! Yipyip! To pan! To pan! To tinpinnypan. All folly me yap to Curlew. Give us a pin for her and we\x{2019}ll call it a tossup. Can you reverse positions.

All she wants! Could you wheedle a staveling encore out of your imitationer\x{2019}s jubalharp, hey, Mr Jinglejoys? Congregational singing. Rota rota ran the pagoda con dio in capo ed il diavolo in coda. Many a diva devoucha saw her Dauber Dan at the priesty pagoda Rota ran. Uck! He\x{2019}s so sedulous to singe always if prumpted, the mirthprovoker. Grunt unto us, I pray, your foreboden article in our own deas dockandoilish introducing the death of Nelson with coloraturas! Coraio, fra! And I\x{2019}ll string second to harmanize. My loaf and pottage neaheaheahear Rochelle. With your dumpsey diddely dumpsey die, fiddeley fa. Diavoloh!

Begob, there\x{2019}s not so much green in his Ireland\x{2019}s eye! Sweet fellow ovocal, he stones out of stune. But he could be near a colonel with a voice like that. The bark is still there but the molars are gone. The misery billyboots I used to lend him before we split and, be the hole in the year, they were laking like heaven\x{2019}s reflexes. But I told him make your will be done and go to a general and I\x{2019}d pray confessions for him. Areesh! Areesh! And I\x{2019}ll be your intrepider. Ambras! Ruffle her! Bussing was before the blood and bissing will behind the curtain. Triss! Did you note that worrid expressionism on his megalogue? A full octavium below me!

Who gets twickly fullgets twice as allemanden huskers. But the whacker his word the weaker our ears for auracles who paries parses orileys.

The swankysuits was boosting always, sure him, he was like to me fad. But the swaggerest swell off Shackvulle Strutt. And the fiercest freaky ever followed a pining child round the sluppery table with a forkful of fat. But a king of whistlers. Scieoula! When he\x{2019}d prop me atlas against his goose and light our two candles for our singers duohs on the sewingmachine. I\x{2019}m sure he squirted juice in his eyes to make them flash for flightening me. Still and all he was awful fond to me. Who\x{2019}ll search for Find Me Colours now on the hillydroops of Vikloefells? But I read in Tobecontinued\x{2019}s tale that while blubles blows there\x{2019}ll still be sealskers. There\x{2019}ll be others but non so for me. Yed he never knew we seen us before. Night after night. So that I longed to go to. And still with all. One time you\x{2019}d stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of branches for to fan me coolly. And I\x{2019}d lie as quiet as a moss. And one time you\x{2019}d rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black shadow with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I\x{2019}d frozen up and pray for thawe. Three times in all. I was the pet of everyone then. A princeable girl. And you were the pantymammy\x{2019}s Vulking Corsergoth. The invision of Indelond. And, by Thorror, you looked it! My lips went livid for from the joy of fear. Like almost now. How? How you said how you\x{2019}d give me the keys of me heart. And we\x{2019}d be married till delth to uspart. And though dev do espart. O mine! Only, no, now it\x{2019}s me who\x{2019}s got to give. As duv herself div. Inn this linn. And can it be it\x{2019}s nnow fforvell? Illas!

I\x{2019}m getting mixed. Brightening up and tightening down. Yes, you\x{2019}re changing, sonhusband, and you\x{2019}re turning, I can feel you, for a daughterwife from the hills again. Imlamaya. And she is coming. Swimming in my hindmoist. Diveltaking on me tail. Just a whisk brisk sly spry spink spank sprint of a thing theresomere, saultering. Saltarella come to her own. I pity your oldself I was used to. Now a younger\x{2019}s there. Try not to part. Be happy, dear ones! May I be wrong! For she\x{2019}ll be sweet for you as I was sweet when I came down out of me mother. My great blue bedroom, the air so quiet, scarce a cloud. In peace and silence. I could have stayed up there for always only. It\x{2019}s something fails us. First we feel. Then we fall. And let her rain now if she likes. Gently or strongly as she likes. Anyway let her rain for my time is come. I done me best when I was let. Thinking always if I go all goes. A hundred cares, a tithe of troubles and is there one who understands me? One in a thousand of years of the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little warm tricks. And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it\x{2019}s all! And me letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time. I thought you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You\x{2019}re only a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in glory. You\x{2019}re but a puny. Home! My people were not their sort out beyond there so far as I can. For all the bold and bad and bleary they are blamed, the seahags. No! Nor for all our wild dances in all their wild din. I can seen meself among them, allaniuvia pulchrabelled. How she was handsome, the wild Amazia, when she would seize to my other breast! And what is she weird, haughty Niluna, that she will snatch from my ownest hair! For \x{2019}tis they are the stormies. Ho hang! Hang ho! And the clash of our cries till we spring to be free. Auravoles, they says, never heed of your name! But I\x{2019}m loothing them that\x{2019}s here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending! I\x{2019}ll slip away before they\x{2019}re up. They\x{2019}ll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it\x{2019}s old and old it\x{2019}s sad and old it\x{2019}s sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms. I see them rising! Save me from those therrble prongs! Two more. Onetwo moremens more. So. Avelaval. My leaves have drifted from me. All. But one clings still. I\x{2019}ll bear it on me. To remind me of. Lff! So soft this morning ours. Yes. Carry me along, taddy, like you done through the toy fair. If I seen him bearing down on me now under whitespread wings like he\x{2019}d come from Arkangels, I sink I\x{2019}d die down over his feet, humbly dumbly, only to washup. Yes, tid.

The latter, the luciferant not the oriuolate (who, the odds are, is still berting dagabout in the same straw bamer, carryin his overgoat under his schulder, sheepside out, so as to look more like a coumfry gentleman and signing the pledge as gaily as you please) hardily accosted him with: Guinness thaw tool in jew me dinner ouzel fin?
