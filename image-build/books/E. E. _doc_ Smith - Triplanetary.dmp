            "Nevia, the home planet of the marauding space-ship, would have appeared
peculiar indeed to Terrestrial senses. High in the deep red heavens a
fervent blue sun poured down its flood of brilliant purplish light upon
a world of water. Not a cloud was to be seen in that flaming sky, and
through that dustless atmosphere the eye could see the horizon\x{2014}a
horizon three times as distant as the one to which we are
accustomed\x{2014}with a distinctness and clarity impossible in our Terra's
dust-filled air. As that mighty sun dropped below the horizon the sky
would fill suddenly with clouds and rain would fall violently and
steadily until <<midnight|13>>. Then the clouds would vanish as suddenly as
they had come into being, the torrential downpour would cease, and,
through that huge world's wonderfully transparent, gaseous envelope, the
full glory of the firmament would be revealed. Not the firmament as we
know it\x{2014}for that hot blue sun and Nevia, her one planet-child, were
many light-years distant from Old Sol and his numerous brood\x{2014}but a
strange and glorious firmament containing not one constellation familiar
to earthly eyes.",

preliminary or greeting. \"Four vessels gone\x{2014}a freighter and a passenger
