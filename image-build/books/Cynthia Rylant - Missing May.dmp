            "A gifted writer returns to one of her favorite themes \x{2014} love \x{2014} in this case, as it can inform and transform grief. After her mother\x{2019}s death, Summer was handed from one unwilling relative to another, \x{201c}treated like a homework assignment somebody was always having to do.\x{201d} At <<six|9c:1>>, she was taken in by an elderly uncle and aunt. Ob had a game leg (WW II) and enjoyed creating unusual whirligigs; May liked gardening behind their West Virginia trailer. They loved each other with a deep and abiding love, wholeheartedly including Summer. Now, six years later, May has died. In a poetic, ruminative narrative, Summer recounts Ob\x{2019}s mounting depression, his growing conviction that May is still present, and their expedition to find \x{201c}Miriam B. Young: Small Medium at Large.\x{201d} Meanwhile, they\x{2019}ve been befriended by Cletus, an odd, bright boy in Summer\x{2019}s class; she doesn\x{2019}t especially value his company, but is intrigued by his vocabulary (\x{201c}surreal\x{201d}; \x{201c}Renaissance Man\x{201d}) and his offhand characterization of her as a writer. Rylant reveals a great deal about her four characters, deftly dropping telling details from the past into her quiet story \x{2014} including a glimpse of Summer, as seen by a girl in her class, \x{201c}Like some sad welfare case,\x{201d} a description the reader who has read her thoughts will know to be gloriously untrue. A beautifully written, life-affirming book.",

            "Orphaned at <<six|9c:1>>, raised by an elderly West Virginia aunt and uncle with more devotion than money, Summer is twelve years old when Aunt May dies. Summer\x{2019}s grief is profound, but Uncle Ob seems unable to go on living without his beloved companion. The final scene is a triumphant catharsis as they find consolation in their memories and in each other. A haunting first-person narrative.",
