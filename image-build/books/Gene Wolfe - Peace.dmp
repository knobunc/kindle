the elevator, and a glass door for the waiting room where five people sit listening
to Glinka\x{2019}s A Life for the Czar. They
are Margaret Lorn, Ted Singer, Abel Green, and Sherry Gold. And me. We are
reading magazines, and the magazines are Life,
Look, Today\x{2019}s Health, and Water World.
Two of us are reading Life. Different
issues, of course, and I am one of these readers, the other being Margaret
Lorn. There is (as a matter of fact) a whole pile of Lifes before me, and I play the old game of trying to arrange them
chronologically without looking at the dates, and lose. Margaret tosses down
her copy and goes in to see the doctor, and I know, somehow, that this is a
mark of contempt. I pick it up and find an area of the cover that is still warm
(and slightly damp) from her hands. A nurse comes to the window and asks for

Katherine Boyne was born in Boston of Irish immigrant parents \x{2014}probably before
<<1850|9c:0>>. That would have been the period of the potato blight, and it seems quite
probable that the family had just arrived in the United States. Somehow or other, she became a kind of

your reporter visited the hotel, and, with the concurrence of the management,
occupied a room on the fourteenth floor. I found my accommodations as pleasant
and commodious a domicile as the hotel\x{2019}s advertising and that sometimes more
reliable guide, the word-of-mouth report of the city, had led me to expect. Two
windows opened on a capacious air-shaft to admit copious sunlight. The
furniture and carpet were new, the bed was of the most modern design, and the
bath, whose all-enamel tub boasted ball-claw feet and stood upon a floor of
sparkling-white hexagonal tiles, was the most modern I have seen. After a light
supper in one of the hotel\x{2019}s excellent restaurants, I prepared my room for the
vigil I would keep all that night, placing a pair of large candles on the
chiffonier, another pair upon the windowsill of the room, and four upon the
posts of the bed, where I attached them by their own wax to the elegant knobs that
served there as terminals. When all were lit, I made the experiment of turning
out the electric lights, and satisfied myself that at <<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>>\x{2014}when, as its custom is (both for the safety
of its patrons and to encourage regularity of hours), the hotel should
extinguish the electricity\x{2014}I would not want for light. It yet lacked two hours
of that time, and I amused myself with a book (one of cheerful character, the
reader may be assured!) until the preliminary blinking of the electric bulbs
warned me to make haste to relight my candles. I did so, set my volume aside,
and began my watch in earnest.",
