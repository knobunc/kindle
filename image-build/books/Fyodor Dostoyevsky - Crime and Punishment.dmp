            "FYODOR MIKHAILOVICH DOSTOYEVSKY was born in Moscow in 1821 at the Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor, where his father worked as a doctor. His mother died in 1837 and his father two years later, rumoured to have been murdered by his serfs. From 1838 to 1843 he studied at the Academy of Military Engineers in St Petersburg. In 1844 Dostoyevsky resigned his commission and devoted himself fully to literature. His debut, the epistolary novel Poor Folk (1846), made his name, though The Double, published later that year, was greeted with much less enthusiasm, not least by Dostoyevsky\x{2019}s champion, Vissarion Belinsky. His epilepsy, which became increasingly severe, set in at this time. In 1849 he was arrested and sentenced to death for involvement with the politically subversive \x{2018}Petrashevsky circle\x{2019}; his sentence was commuted at the last moment to penal servitude and until <<1854|18:0>> he lived in a convict prison in Omsk, Siberia. From this experience came Notes from the Dead House (1860\x{2013}2), which restored his literary reputation on his return to St Petersburg. In 1861 he and his brother Mikhail launched Time (Vremya), a monthly journal of literary-political affairs. Already married, Dostoyevsky fell in love with one of his contributors, Apollinaria Suslova, eighteen years his junior, and also developed a ruinous passion for roulette. The year 1864 saw the deaths of his wife Maria Dmitrievna and brother Mikhail, and the publication of Notes from Underground. He set to work on Crime and Punishment (1866) the following year. While writing this novel he engaged a young stenographer, Anna Grigoryevna Snitkina, and married her in 1867. The major novels of his late period, written in Russia and abroad, are The Idiot (1868), Demons (1871\x{2013}2) and The Brothers Karamazov (1879\x{2013}80). He died in 1881 at the peak of his fame.",

            "\x{2018}Young man,\x{2019} he continued, raising himself once more, \x{2018}I read, as it were, a certain sorrow in your features. I read it there the moment you walked in, which is why I was so quick to address you. For it is not to disgrace myself before these gentlemen of leisure, who already know it all anyway, that I relate the story of my life to you; rather, I seek a man of feeling and education. You should know that my spouse attended an aristocratic school for daughters of the nobility, and at the leaving ball she danced the pas de ch\x{e2}le20 in the presence of the governor and other persons, for which she received a gold medal and a certificate of distinction. The medal\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. well, the medal was sold\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. long ago now\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. H\x{2019}m!\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. But the certificate of distinction is still in her trunk, and just recently she showed it to our landlady. And though she and the landlady are in perpetual discord, the urge to show off a little before someone\x{a0}\x{2013} anyone\x{a0}\x{2013} and reminisce about better, happier days was too strong to resist. And I do not judge her\x{a0}\x{2013} no, I do not\x{a0}\x{2013} for this is what has remained in her memory, when all else has turned to dust! Yes, yes; a proud lady, proud and unbending. She scrubs the floor herself and gets by on black bread, but she will not be slighted. That is why she could not let Mr Lebezyatnikov\x{2019}s rudeness pass unchallenged, and when Mr Lebezyatnikov gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed less from injury to her body than from injury to her feelings. I married her when she was already a widow, with three children, three tiny little mites. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her father\x{2019}s home. She loved him beyond measure, but he started gambling, ended up in court and promptly died. He beat her towards the end; and though she stood up to him, which I know for a fact, with papers to prove it, she remembers him to this day with tears in her eyes and reproaches me with his example, and I am glad, I am glad, for in her imagination, at least, she once was happy\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. So she was left with three infants in a far-flung, savage district, where I also happened to find myself, and she was left in such hopeless beggary that I, for all that I have seen in my life, am quite incapable of even describing it. Her relations turned their backs on her. And she was proud, too proud\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. So then, my good sir, I, also widowed, with a fourteen-year-old daughter from my first wife, offered my hand in marriage, for I could not bear to look on such suffering. You may judge the depth of her plight from the fact that she, educated, well brought up, the bearer of a famous surname, consented to marry me! She did! Crying and sobbing and wringing her hands\x{a0}\x{2013} but marry me she did! For she had nowhere else to go. Do you understand, my good sir, do you really understand what that means, to have nowhere left to go? No! This you have yet to understand\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. For an entire year I carried out my duty in godly, pious fashion and not a drop did I touch,\x{2019} (he jabbed at his pint-measure of vodka) \x{2018}for I am a man of feeling. Yet even thus I could not please. Then I lost my position, also through no fault of my own: a change of personnel; and then I began to partake!\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. A year and a half must have passed now since we finally found ourselves, after lengthy wanderings and numerous calamities, in this magnificent capital city graced by numerous monuments. And here, I received a position\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Received it and lost it again. Understand, sir? This time it was my own fault; the mark of my character came to the fore\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. So now we occupy a little corner of a house, and Amalia Fyodorovna Lippewechsel is our landlady, and how we get by and how we pay, I do not know. Many others live there, too, of course\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Sodom, sir, of the foulest kind\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. H\x{2019}m\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Yes\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Meanwhile, my girl from my first marriage has grown up and the things she has had to endure from her stepmother along the way\x{a0}\x{2013} well, the less said, the better. For although Katerina Ivanovna\x{2019}s soul overflows with the noblest sentiments, she is fiery and irritable, and quick to slap you down\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Yes sir! But what is the use in remembering? Sonya, as you can well imagine, received no education. I did try, some four years ago, to give her a grounding in geography and world history; but because my own grasp of these fields is uncertain, and due to a lack of decent primers (for what books there were\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. h\x{2019}m!\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. well, they are no longer even around, those books) that was all the teaching she had. Cyrus the Great21 was as far as we got. Later, on reaching maturity, she read several books of a romantic bent, and just recently, through the good offices of Mr Lebezyatnikov, she read with great interest a certain little tome, Lewes\x{2019}s Physiology22\x{a0}\x{2013} perhaps you know it?\x{a0}\x{2013} and even conveyed parts of it to us aloud: and that is the sum of her education. Now let me turn to you, my good sir, with a private question of my own: in your view, can a poor but honest girl earn much through honest labour?\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. She\x{2019}ll not earn fifteen copecks a day, sir, if she is honest and has no particular talents, and even then only if she works herself into the ground! And even then Counsellor Ivan Ivanovich Klopstok\x{a0}\x{2013} are you familiar with the name?\x{a0}\x{2013} not only failed to pay her for sewing half a dozen Holland-cloth shirts, he even insulted her and showed her the door, stamping his feet and calling her all sorts of names, claiming that a collar she\x{2019}d sewn was the wrong size and not straight. Not to mention the little mites going hungry\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. and Katerina Ivanovna wringing her hands and pacing the room, her cheeks coming out in red blotches, as is always the way with this ailment: \x{201c}You\x{2019}re sponging, girl, eating and drinking and keeping yourself warm,\x{201d} but search me how you can drink and eat when even the little ones don\x{2019}t see a crust of bread for three days at a time! I had my feet up at the time\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. well, all right, I was tipsy, sir, and I could hear my Sonya (as tame as they come, with that meek little voice of hers\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. and her fair hair and her little face, always so pale and thin), I could hear her saying: \x{201c}Well then, Katerina Ivanovna, do I really have to do that?\x{201d} Meanwhile Darya Frantsevna, a malicious woman well known to the police, had already made a few enquiries through the landlady. \x{201c}Well then,\x{201d} mocked Katerina Ivanovna, \x{201c}what are you saving exactly? Precious jewels?\x{201d} But blame her not, my good sir, blame her not! This was said not in soundness of mind, but in a tumult of feeling, in sickness and to the crying of unfed children, and it was said more to offend than for its precise meaning\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. For such is Katerina Ivanovna\x{2019}s character, and the moment the children start crying, albeit from hunger, she immediately beats them. Come <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>>, I saw Sonechka get to her feet, cover her head, put on her little burnous and leave the apartment, and by <<nine|9e:1>> she was back again. She went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and laid out thirty roubles on the table without saying a word. Not a word, not even a glance. She just took our big, green drap de dames23 shawl (we have one between us, made of drap de dames), buried her head and face in it and lay down on the bed, her face to the wall, her little shoulders and body a-quivering\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. As for me, sir, I was in the same state as before, with my feet up\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. And that, young man, was when I saw Katerina Ivanovna walk over to Sonechka\x{2019}s little bed, also without saying a word, and kneel at the foot of the bed for the rest of the evening, kissing Sonechka\x{2019}s feet, not wanting to get up, and, in the end, they both fell asleep just like that, in each other\x{2019}s arms\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. both of them\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. both\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. yes, sir\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. and as for me\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I was tipsy and had my feet up.\x{2019}",

            "\x{2018}All this, good sir, happened five weeks ago. Yes\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. The moment those two, Katerina Ivanovna and Sonechka, found out\x{a0}\x{2013} goodness, I thought I\x{2019}d been taken up to heaven. Before, you would lie there like a beast and abuse was all you heard! But now they\x{2019}re going round on tiptoe, hushing the little ones: \x{201c}Semyon Zakharych is tired out from work, he\x{2019}s resting, shhh!\x{201d} I was being served coffee before work\x{a0}\x{2013} and hot cream! Real cream, do you hear! And how they scraped together eleven roubles and fifty copecks to fit me out so nicely, I\x{2019}ll never know! Boots, magnificent cotton shirt fronts, a new uniform, all tip-top, for just <<eleven fifty|5k:1>>. I walked in after my first morning at work and what did I find? Katerina Ivanovna had prepared two courses\x{a0}\x{2013} soup and corned beef with horseradish\x{a0}\x{2013} something we\x{2019}d never even heard of before then. She doesn\x{2019}t have a single dress\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. not a single one, sir, but now here she was, got up as if to go to a party; incredible how she does it; incredible how she makes everything from nothing: the hairdo, a nice clean collar, cuffs, and by the end she looks a completely different person\x{a0}\x{2013} younger, prettier. Sonechka, my precious, only assisted with money. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s not proper,\x{201d} she says, \x{201c}for me to come over to your place too often now, not for a while anyway, maybe only at dusk, so nobody sees me.\x{201d} Do you hear? I came home after lunch for forty winks and just imagine what I heard then: only a week before Katerina Ivanovna had had the most almighty row with Amalia Fyodorovna, but here she was inviting her round for coffee. Two hours they sat together, whispering. \x{201c}So now Semyon Zakharych is working and drawing a salary, and he presented himself before His Excellency, and His Excellency came out in person, told everybody else to wait, took Semyon Zakharych by the hand and led him past everyone to his office.\x{201d} Do you hear? \x{201c}In view of past services, Semyon Zakharych,\x{201d} said His Excellency, \x{201c}and though you succumbed for a time to this frivolous weakness, but as you are now making a promise, and besides we have been doing poorly without you\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{2013} do you hear?\x{a0}\x{2013} \x{201c}then I shall count on your word of honour\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{2013} and she\x{2019}d made the whole thing up, I tell you, and not out of silliness or just to sing my praises! No, sir, she believes it all herself, she amuses herself with her own imaginings, by heaven! And I do not condemn it; no, this I do not condemn!\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. And when, six days ago, I brought home twenty-three roubles and forty copecks\x{a0}\x{2013} my first salary, in its entirety\x{a0}\x{2013} she even called me her little boy: \x{201c}My clever little boy!\x{201d} she says. And in private, understand? After all, I\x{2019}m not much to look at and not much of a husband, am I? But no, she pinched my cheek and said, \x{201c}My clever little boy!\x{201d}\x{2019}",

And yet over there, a dozen paces away, on the far side of the boulevard, a man had stopped and everything about him indicated that he, too, was very keen to approach the girl for reasons of his own. He, too, must have spotted her from a distance and wanted to catch up with her, but Raskolnikov had got in his way. He kept throwing him angry glances, while trying not to let him notice, and was impatiently waiting for this annoying tramp to clear off. The situation was perfectly clear. The gentleman was about thirty years old, thick-set, fat, a picture of health, with pink lips and a moustache, and very foppishly dressed.

            "It was <<about nine|3b>> when he crossed Haymarket. All the traders at the tables and stalls, and in the shops and little stores, were locking up their goods or taking them down and putting them away, and making their way home, as were their customers. In the filthy, stinking courtyards of Haymarket Square, near the eating-houses on the lower floors, and especially outside the drinking dens, thronged traffickers and rag dealers of every kind. Raskolnikov was often drawn to this square, and all the nearby streets, during his aimless wanders. Here his rags attracted no one\x{2019}s disdain and nobody could care less what he looked like. On the corner of K\x{2014}\x{2014} Lane a tradesman and his wife were selling goods at two tables: thread, tape, cotton handkerchiefs and so on. They, too, were packing up for the day, but they\x{2019}d paused to chat to an acquaintance. The acquaintance was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or simply Lizaveta, as everyone called her, the younger sister of that same old woman, Alyona Ivanovna\x{a0}\x{2013} the collegiate registrar\x{2019}s widow and moneylender whom Raskolnikov had visited the day before to pawn the watch and do his test\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. He had long known all there was to know about this Lizaveta, and she even knew him a little. She was a tall, ungainly, timid, meek spinster, thirty-five years old and all but an imbecile; she was completely enslaved to her sister, worked for her day and night, quivered in her presence and even took beatings from her. With a bundle in her hand, she stood in hesitation before the tradesman and his wife, listening to them attentively. They were heatedly trying to explain something to her. When Raskolnikov suddenly caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange sensation resembling the deepest astonishment, even though this encounter had nothing astonishing about it.",

After his meal, he stretched out again on the couch, but he could no longer fall asleep, so he lay without moving, face down, his head buried in the pillow. One daydream followed another, all of them strange. In most of them he found himself somewhere in Africa, in Egypt, at some oasis or other. The caravan is at rest, the camels lie peaceably; palm trees grow around in a circle; everyone\x{2019}s eating. As for him, he drinks and drinks from a stream which flows and bubbles right there beside him. How cool it is and how wonderfully blue the water, and how cold, racing over the many-coloured stones, over the bright clean sand sparkling like gold\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Suddenly he heard a clock strike loud and clear. He came round with a start, raised his head, looked out of the window, worked out the time and suddenly leapt to his feet, wide awake now, as though someone had yanked him off the couch. He walked up to the door on tiptoe, gently opened it a fraction and listened for noises on the stairs below. His heart was thumping uncontrollably. But only silence came from the stairs, as if everyone was asleep\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. How bizarre to think that he could have slept through since the previous evening in such a trance and still hadn\x{2019}t done anything, hadn\x{2019}t prepared anything\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Meanwhile, that clock was probably striking <<six|11>>\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. His sleepiness and torpor suddenly gave way to an unusually feverish and confused burst of activity. There wasn\x{2019}t much to prepare, though. He was doing his utmost to think of everything and forget nothing, but his heart thumped so hard that it became difficult to breathe. First, he had to make a loop and sew it to his coat\x{a0}\x{2013} a moment\x{2019}s work. He rummaged beneath the pillow, where he\x{2019}d stuffed his linen, and retrieved an old unwashed shirt that had all but fallen to pieces. From it he tore a strip about two inches wide and a good foot long. He folded this strip in two, took off his broad, sturdy, coarse-cotton summer coat (his only outer garment) and started sewing both ends of the strip to the inside, just below the left armpit. His hands shook, but he still managed to do it well enough that nothing was visible from the outside when he put his coat back on. He\x{2019}d had needle and thread to hand for a while, inside a scrap of paper in the little table. As for the loop, that was a crafty invention of his own: it was intended for the axe. After all, he could hardly walk along the street brandishing an axe. Hiding it under his coat wouldn\x{2019}t do either\x{a0}\x{2013} he\x{2019}d have to hold it in place, which would be conspicuous. But now that he had the loop, all he needed to do was place the blade in it and the axe would hang nicely, under his armpit inside the coat, all the way there. What was more, by thrusting a hand into the side pocket of his coat he was able to hold the end of the axe handle and stop it moving about; and since the coat was very broad\x{a0}\x{2013} a real sack\x{a0}\x{2013} there was no way of noticing from the outside that he was holding it through the pocket. The loop was another thing he\x{2019}d thought up a couple of weeks before.",

            "\x{2018}So you are! Well, listen to this, then. Precisely two days after the murder, in the morning, when they were all still fussing around with Kokh and Pestryakov\x{a0}\x{2013} even though they could account for their every step: it was blindingly obvious!\x{a0}\x{2013} the most unexpected fact was suddenly announced. Some peasant, name of Dushkin\x{a0}\x{2013} he runs the pothouse opposite that very same building\x{a0}\x{2013} showed up at the bureau with a jewellery case containing some gold earrings and launched into a long story: \x{201c}Evening-time, day before yesterday, <<eight o\x{2019}clock|6>> or thereabouts\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{2013} date and time, see!\x{a0}\x{2013} \x{201c}this decorator comes running in\x{a0}\x{2013} Mikolai\x{2019}s the name, he\x{2019}s already come to see me earlier that day\x{a0}\x{2013} well, he runs in and brings us this \x{2019}ere box with gold earrings and stones, and wants to pawn it for two roubles, and when I ask him, \x{2018}Where d\x{2019}you find \x{2019}em?\x{2019} he says, \x{2018}Lying on the pavement.\x{2019} I don\x{2019}t ask him no more about that\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{2013} this is Dushkin speaking\x{a0}\x{2013} \x{201c}and bring him a nice little note\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{2013} a rouble, that is\x{a0}\x{2013} \x{201c}thinking that if he don\x{2019}t pawn it with me he\x{2019}ll only find someone else, and it\x{2019}ll all go on booze anyway, so it were better off with me: hide and you will find, as they say, and if something comes out or people start talking, I\x{2019}ll bring it out and present it to \x{2019}em.\x{201d} Well, this is all just an old woman\x{2019}s dream, of course, and he\x{2019}s fibbing like a horse. I know this Dushkin: he\x{2019}s in the pawning business himself and hides stolen goods, and he didn\x{2019}t filch a thirty-rouble pledge from Mikolai in order to \x{201c}present it\x{201d}. He got cold feet, simple as that. Anyway, listen to what Dushkin said next: \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve known this \x{2019}ere peasant, Mikolai Dementyev, since we were kids, same province, Ryazan,19 same district, Zaraisk. And Mikolai ain\x{2019}t what you\x{2019}d call a drunkard, but he likes a drink, and I knew for a fact he was working in that there house, decorating, him and Mitrei, the two of \x{2019}em being from the same parts. That rouble burned a hole in his pocket soon enough\x{a0}\x{2013} he poured two vodkas down the hatch, one after the other, took the change and walked off, and there was no Mitrei with him then. Come the next day, what do I hear? Alyona Ivanovna and her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, murdered with an axe, and I knew \x{2019}em both, sir, and I fell to wond\x{2019}ring about them earrings\x{a0}\x{2013} seeing as I knew the deceased lent money for suchlike. So I goes to their home to learn what I can, without giving myself away, and the first thing I ask is: \x{2018}Where\x{2019}s Mikolai?\x{2019} \x{2018}Gone on a bender,\x{2019} says Mitrei. \x{2018}Got home at dawn, drunk as you like, stayed ten minutes and then he was off again,\x{2019} and Mitrei ain\x{2019}t seen him since and he\x{2019}s finishing the job on his own. And that job of theirs is on the same staircase as the murdered women, second floor. When I heard all that, I didn\x{2019}t spill the beans to no one\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{2013} that\x{2019}s Dushkin speaking\x{a0}\x{2013} \x{201c}but found out all I could about the murder and came home still wond\x{2019}ring. Then this morning, <<about eight o\x{2019}clock|6>>\x{201d}\x{a0}\x{2013} that\x{2019}s two days after, understand?\x{a0}\x{2013} \x{201c}there\x{2019}s Mikolai coming through my door, not sober, nor blind-drunk neither, and capable of being spoken to. Sits down on a bench, says nothing. Hardly anyone else in the pothouse at that time\x{a0}\x{2013} one stranger, one regular, sleeping on a bench, and our two boys. \x{2018}Seen Mitrei?\x{2019} I ask. \x{2018}No,\x{2019} he says. \x{2018}And you ain\x{2019}t been back here?\x{2019} \x{2018}Not for two days,\x{2019} he says. \x{2018}So where\x{2019}ve you been sleeping?\x{2019} \x{2018}Over at The Sands,\x{2019}20 he says, \x{2018}with our lot from Zaraisk.\x{2019} \x{2018}And where d\x{2019}you get the earrings, then?\x{2019} I say. \x{2018}Found \x{2019}em on the pavement,\x{2019} he says, as if that weren\x{2019}t bloody likely, and keeping his eyes down. \x{2018}Ain\x{2019}t you heard,\x{2019} I say, \x{2018}that such-and-such a thing happened that same evening, that same time, that same staircase?\x{2019} \x{2018}No,\x{2019} he says, and he listens with eyes all a-goggle and pale as chalk. So I\x{2019}m telling him all this when I see him take his cap and start getting up. I try to keep him, of course. \x{2018}Hang about, Mikolai,\x{2019} I say, \x{2018}have one on me.\x{2019} Meanwhile, I\x{2019}m winking at the boy to watch the door and I\x{2019}m coming out from behind the bar when he makes a bolt for it and vanishes down a lane, and that\x{2019}s the last I see of him. Well, that soon put an end to my wond\x{2019}ring\x{a0}\x{2013} his sin and no mistake\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{201d}\x{2019}",

            "\x{2018}Wait! You haven\x{2019}t heard how it ended! Everyone goes tearing off to look for Mikolai, of course. Dushkin is detained and a search is made, and Mitrei, too.

According to his own calculations someone should have pounced on him straight away. Instead, he just stood there in the reception room, utterly ignored by the people walking past him in both directions. Several clerks were sitting and writing in the next room, which looked like an office, and it was obvious that none of them had even the faintest idea who Raskolnikov was. He scanned the area around him with an anxious, suspicious gaze: wasn\x{2019}t there at least some guard or other, some secret pair of eyes, charged with keeping tabs on him in case he wandered off? But there was nothing of the kind: all he saw were bureaucratic, trivially preoccupied faces, plus a few other people, and no one took the slightest interest in him: he could do what he liked for all they cared. He became ever more convinced that if the mysterious man from yesterday, the phantom from out of the ground, really did know everything, really had seen everything, then would he, Raskolnikov, have been left standing here now, calmly waiting? And would they really have waited for him here until <<eleven o\x{2018}clock|6>>, when he himself saw fit to drop by? Either that man had not yet reported anything or\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. or he simply didn\x{2019}t know anything either, hadn\x{2019}t seen anything with his own eyes (and how could he have done?), so all of that, from yesterday, was, once again, a phantom, exaggerated by his own, Raskolnikov\x{2019}s, sick and overwrought imagination. Even yesterday, during the worst of his panic and despair, this conjecture had begun to take root in his mind. Going over it all again now and readying himself for a new fight, he suddenly realized that he was shaking\x{a0}\x{2013} and even began seething with indignation at the thought that he was shaking with fear before someone as loathsome as Porfiry Petrovich. To meet this man again was for him the most dreadful thing of all: he loathed him beyond measure, infinitely, and was even afraid lest his loathing betray him. So great was his indignation, in fact, that it instantly put a stop to his shaking; he prepared to walk in with a cool and insolent air and promised himself to say as little as possible, to look and listen hard and, at least for this once, to overcome at all costs his morbidly excitable character. At that very moment he was called in to see Porfiry Petrovich.",

            "He stood in the doorway. The service was beginning with quiet, sad decorum. Awareness of death and its presence had always contained for him something oppressive, some mystical dread, ever since childhood; besides, it was a long time since he\x{2019}d last heard a service for the dead. But there was something else as well, something far too dreadful and disturbing. He was looking at the children: they were all by the coffin, on their knees; Polechka was crying. Behind them, weeping softly and almost shyly, Sonya was praying. The thought, \x{2018}She hasn\x{2019}t glanced at me once these past few days, nor spoken a word to me,\x{2019} suddenly struck him. The room was brightly lit by the sun; puffs of smoke floated up from the censer. \x{2018}God rest her soul,\x{2019} read the priest. Raskolnikov stood for the duration of the service. Giving his blessing and taking his leave, the priest looked about him in a strange kind of way. After the service Raskolnikov walked up to Sonya. Suddenly, she took both his hands in hers and inclined her head towards his shoulder. This brief gesture left Raskolnikov bewildered. In fact, it felt strange. What? Not the slightest disgust? Not the slightest revulsion towards him? Not the slightest tremble in her hand? What was this if not some infinity of self-abasement? That, at any rate, was how he understood it. Sonya said nothing. Raskolnikov squeezed her hand and left. He felt dreadful. Had he only been able to go off somewhere there and then and be entirely alone, even if it were for the rest of his life, he\x{2019}d have thought himself lucky. But lately, even though he was almost always alone, he never felt alone. He might walk out of the city and out onto the high road or even, on one occasion, to some little wood; but the more isolated the place, the more strongly he seemed to be aware of someone\x{2019}s close and unsettling presence\x{a0}\x{2013} it wasn\x{2019}t terrifying exactly, just extremely bothersome, so he would hurry back to the city, mix with the crowds, visit the taverns and drinking dens, go to the flea market, to Haymarket. It was as if he somehow felt better there, more isolated. In one eating-house, in the late afternoon, there was singing: he sat and listened for a whole hour and remembered having even enjoyed it. But towards the end he suddenly became anxious again, as if a pang of conscience had suddenly begun to torment him: \x{2018}Look at me sitting here, listening to songs\x{a0}\x{2013} as if there\x{2019}s nothing else I should be doing!\x{2019} was the kind of thought in his mind. But he soon realized that wasn\x{2019}t the only thing troubling him: there was something that demanded to be resolved at once, but it could neither be grasped nor put into words. As if everything were being wound into a ball. \x{2018}No, a fight would be better than this! Porfiry again\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. or Svidrigailov\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I need a challenge, someone to attack me\x{a0}.\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Yes! Yes!\x{2019} He left the eating-house and almost broke into a run. The thought of Dunya and his mother had, for some reason, suddenly thrown him into a kind of panic. That was the night when he woke before dawn in the bushes on Krestovsky Island, shivering to the bone and feverish. He set off home, arriving in the early morning. After several hours\x{2019} sleep the fever passed, but it was already late when he woke: <<two in the afternoon|5>>.",

We read of murders committed by a handsome young man whom it would be difficult to identify precisely with the radicals of the 1860s (though some offended young readers contrived to do so) or with its unhandsome author. Disturbingly, this man is unsure that his gruesome acts were crimes at all; unsure at times that they even happened. For much of the book he even seems to forget one of his murders entirely. The reality of punishment also eludes him for an unreasonably long time, despite his best efforts. In his mind everything begins to merge: past and future, right and wrong, perpetrator and victim, crime and punishment. The opposition stated by the title, so familiar and in its way so comforting, begins to dissolve for the reader, too; a dark joke, perhaps\x{a0}\x{2013} like Dostoyevsky\x{2019}s own \x{2018}execution\x{2019}?\x{a0}\x{2013} yet no less serious for that.",

He\x{2019}d got mixed up with the clerks for no better reason than their crooked noses: one man\x{2019}s curved to the right, the other\x{2019}s to the left. This made a great impression on Svidrigailov. Eventually, they dragged him off to a pleasure garden, where he paid for their admission and drinks. The garden contained a slender, three-year-old fir tree and three little bushes. In addition a \x{2018}Vauxhall\x{2019}28 had been set up\x{a0}\x{2013} essentially a drinking den, though it served tea as well, and there were also several green tables and chairs. A chorus of atrocious singers and a German drunk from Munich\x{a0}\x{2013} a kind of clown, with a red nose, though for some reason utterly miserable\x{a0}\x{2013} were entertaining the public. The clerks got into an argument with some other clerks and were about to start a fight. They\x{2019}d chosen Svidrigailov to arbitrate. He\x{2019}d been doing so for about a quarter of an hour already, but there was so much shouting that it was impossible to make head or tail of it all. The likeliest thing was that one of them had stolen something and had even managed to palm it off on one of the Jews knocking around; but, having sold it, was in no hurry to share the spoils with his friend. The stolen object, it transpired, was a teaspoon belonging to the Vauxhall. Its absence was noticed and the whole business was rapidly getting out of hand. Svidrigailov paid for the spoon, got up and left the garden. It was <<around ten|9f>>. He hadn\x{2019}t touched a drop all this time and had only ordered tea, for the sake of form more than anything. It was a stifling, gloomy evening. By <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> terrible storm clouds had gathered from all sides; there was a clap of thunder and the rain gushed forth like a waterfall. It fell not in drops but in jets, lashing the ground. One flash of lightning followed another and you could count to five before the afterglows faded. Soaked to the skin, he arrived home, locked the door, opened his bureau, took out all his money and ripped up two or three sheets of paper. Then, having pocketed the money, he was on the point of changing his clothes, but, after looking out of the window and bending an ear to the thunder and rain, he dismissed the idea, took his hat and walked out, leaving the apartment unlocked. He went straight over to Sonya\x{2019}s. She was at home.",

            "It later transpired that on that same evening, not <<long before midnight|13>>, he paid one more highly eccentric and unexpected visit. It was still pouring. At <<twenty past eleven|10>>, drenched to the skin, he entered the cramped apartment of his fianc\x{e9}e\x{2019}s parents, on Maly Prospect, Third Line, Vasilyevsky Island. He had to knock a long time before they opened and at first his appearance caused considerable embarrassment; but Arkady Ivanovich could be very charming when the mood took him, so the initial (and extremely perspicacious) conclusion drawn by his fianc\x{e9}e\x{2019}s prudent parents, that Arkady Ivanovich must have got so drunk somewhere that he could no longer think straight, was instantly dismissed. The invalid father was wheeled out in a chair by the tender-hearted and prudent mother, who began, in her usual fashion, with some very far-fetched questions. (This woman never asked anything directly, preferring to limber up with smiles and much rubbing of hands, after which, if concrete information was urgently required, such as \x{201c}When would Arkady Ivanovich care to hold the wedding?\x{201d}, she would begin by asking, with the keenest curiosity, about Paris and life at the Parisian court, and only then, if at all, turn to life on the Third Line of Vasilyevsky Island.) On another day, all this would no doubt have inspired the greatest respect, but on this particular occasion Arkady Ivanovich was unusually impatient and adamant that he wanted to see his fianc\x{e9}e at all costs, despite having been informed right away that she was already in bed. Needless to say, the fianc\x{e9}e appeared. Arkady Ivanovich told her straight out that he had to leave Petersburg for a while on a matter of the gravest importance, which was why he\x{2019}d brought her fifteen thousand roubles in silver, in various denominations, asking her to accept these notes as a gift, seeing as it had long been his intention to give her this trifle before their wedding. A logical connection between the gift, his imminent departure and his urgent need to come visiting in the rain, at <<midnight|13>>, did not thereby emerge, but nonetheless it all went off without a hitch. Even the inevitable oohs and aahs, interrogations and interjections suddenly became unusually moderate and restrained; instead, there followed expressions of the most ardent gratitude, reinforced by the tears of a prudent mother. Arkady Ivanovich got up, laughed, kissed his fianc\x{e9}e, patted her cheek, confirmed he would soon be back and, glimpsing in her eyes a mute, serious question that exceeded purely childish curiosity, thought for a moment, kissed her again and inwardly cursed the fact that his gift would immediately be stowed away under lock and key by this most prudent of mothers. He departed, leaving everyone in a state of extraordinary excitement. But tender-hearted mama, pattering away in a whisper, immediately resolved some of the most pressing uncertainties: \x{2018}Arkady Ivanovich, you see, is an important man, much in demand and well connected, a man of means\x{a0}\x{2013} who\x{2019}s to say what goes through his mind or why he should suddenly up and leave and part with his money? So there\x{2019}s really no cause for wonder. It is rather odd to see him soaking wet, but the English, for example, are even more eccentric, and actually all these sophisticated types are quite indifferent to other people\x{2019}s opinions and they never stand on ceremony. Perhaps he goes about like that on purpose, to show that no one can scare him. But the main thing is, don\x{2019}t breathe a word about this to anyone, because God knows where it\x{2019}ll all end, and do let\x{2019}s put that money away, and thank goodness Feodosya was in the kitchen\x{a0}\x{2013} isn\x{2019}t that a relief?\x{a0}\x{2013} and the main thing is, not a word about this, any of it, to that scheming Resslich woman,\x{2019} and so on and so forth. They sat up whispering until <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>>. The fianc\x{e9}e, though, went to sleep much earlier, surprised and a little saddened.",

            "Meanwhile, on the dot of <<midnight|13>>, Svidrigailov was crossing \x{2014}\x{2014}kov Bridge30 onto Petersburg Side. The rain had stopped, but the wind was gusting. He started to shiver, and for a minute or so he looked with particular curiosity\x{a0}\x{2013} almost questioningly\x{a0}\x{2013} at the black water of the Lesser Neva. But he quickly began to feel very cold standing there above the water; he turned and set off down \x{2014}\x{2014}oy Prospect.31 He\x{2019}d been walking along that dark, endless street for ages, almost half an hour, and had lost his footing more than once on the wooden pavement, but he still carried on looking for something on the right side of street. It was somewhere here, near the end of the street, that he\x{2019}d recently noticed, while travelling past one day, a wooden, yet very sizeable hotel, and its name, as far as he could remember, was Adrianopolis32 or something of the kind. He wasn\x{2019}t mistaken: in this back of beyond the hotel stood out so prominently that it couldn\x{2019}t be missed, even in the dark. It was a long, blackened building in which, despite the late hour, windows were still lit and there were still signs of life. He went in and asked a ragamuffin he met in the corridor for a room. After a quick glance at Svidrigailov, the ragamuffin perked up and immediately showed him to a distant room, stuffy and cramped, right at the very end of the corridor, in a corner, beneath the stairs. It was the only one still going. The ragamuffin looked at him inquiringly.",

            "He lit a candle and inspected the room more closely. It was a cell so small that Svidrigailov almost had to bow his head, with just one window; a filthy bed, a simple painted table and a chair took up nearly all the space. The walls looked as if they had been knocked together from planks, and the wallpaper was so dusty and frayed that only its colour (yellow) could still be discerned: the pattern was utterly obscured. One part of the wall and ceiling were cut at a slant, as in a loft, to make room for the staircase. Svidrigailov put down the candle, sat on the bed and sank into thought. But the strange, continuous whispers from the adjoining cell\x{a0}\x{2013} at times, they were more like shouts\x{a0}\x{2013} eventually captured his attention. The whispering hadn\x{2019}t ceased from the moment he entered. He listened in closely: a man, almost in tears, was cursing and reproaching another, but only one voice could be heard. Svidrigailov got up, shielded the candle with his hand, and immediately saw a glint in the wall; he went over and began looking through the gap. In a room slightly larger than his own were two guests. <<One|9k:0>>, with unusually curly hair and a red, swollen face, had struck a declamatory pose, his frock coat off and his feet wide apart so as to keep his balance. Beating his chest, he was reproaching the other in histrionic fashion for being a beggar with no rank at all; having plucked him from the gutter, he could throw him out at a moment\x{2019}s notice, and the only witness to it all would be the finger of the Almighty. His friend sat in a chair, with the look of a man who desperately wanted to sneeze but couldn\x{2019}t. Every now and then he turned his dull, sheep-like gaze on the orator, but it was clear that he hadn\x{2019}t the faintest idea what he was talking about and probably wasn\x{2019}t even listening. A candle was guttering out on the table, where there was a flask of vodka, now almost empty, shot glasses, bread, tumblers, slices of pickled cucumber, and glasses from which the tea had long been drunk. After giving this scene his careful attention, Svidrigailov stepped back, unmoved, and sat back down on the bed.",
