Looking at the clock, I figured I would get into the lab by <<ten-thirty|5b>>. When I picked up my phone to text Bill that I was on my way, I saw that there were already two texts from him. The first read \x{201c}BRING IPECAC\x{201d} and the second, sent about an hour later, said \x{201c}AND MORE FOOD.\x{201d}",

            "I reached over and picked up a watering can, raining water over the soil covering both our feet. We wiggled our toes and worked the dirt into a nice luxurious mud, and then we leaned back and just sat for a while. Bill eventually broke the silence with \x{201c}So! What should we do now?

Arimura and coauthors showed how VOC production in one plant could affect gene expression within a separate plant upon exposure, and thus demonstrated the mechanism by which the willow trees communicated with one another.',
