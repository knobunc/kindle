of the audience lot slackened in the least. For my part, while my
fingers felt a bit stiff from writer\'s cramp (for you must remember I
was taking down all these stories in short-hand, to be put into the
book, Tales of the Home for Crossbred Dogs), I was still too deeply
absorbed in the history of this strange little terrier to bother about
the time. Neither had it occurred to the Doctor to look at his watch.
And it is quite likely that we would all have sat on there listening
till the cocks crowed if Dab-Dab had not suddenly appeared and told us
that it was <<long after midnight|13>> and high time that the Doctor was abed.',

darkness off to the side of the road and saw a large stone building. At
one end there was a sort of chapel with stained glass windows, dimly
lighted. It was the only habitation in the neighbourhood, standing in
the midst of its own grounds apparently. I went up closer and saw that
there were men dressed in robes solemnly gathering in the little chapel.
It was evidently a monastery. I knew, because there had been one near
our home farm. These monks would be going into <<vespers|13>>, the evening
service.',

hand, no one could call me bigoted or intolerant. Among my friends upon

to a Jewish rabbi. The little chapel looked warm and inviting compared
to the cold night outside. The doors would soon close. I joined the

among the audience and waved a paw or something to attract attention.

sleigh-team; another had done duty as a life-guard at a children\'s
swimming beach; <<one|9k:0>>, a St. Bernard, said he had been employed at the
famous monastery in the Alps and rescued lost travellers from mountain
snow-storms; another got up and told us he had led a blind man through
city streets and helped him earn a living; a funny old veteran of a
blood-hound said he had been employed as a tracker by a prison to hunt
down prisoners who ran away; two others said they had worked in Holland
pulling vegetable barrows around like horses; another had been a
collector for charity, going through the city with a tin box on his back
into which people put pennies for the cause of the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals; several sporting dogs had spent years at the various jobs
dogs do in retrieving, tracking and pointing with the guns. And there
were many more.',

would be able to take to my own wings if necessary. Through this I
nearly froze to death. The rushing of the cold air was terrific. My
goodness, what a speed that duck kept up! I drew back into the inner
shelter of the mud cake. I knew that so long as I could hear that
droning deafening whirl of the duck\'s wings that I was still attached to

the grandfather clock on the stair-landing. Chee-Chee finally fell
asleep under the bushes. I, by pinching myself at five-minute intervals,
managed to carry on till dawn showed over the roof-ridge of the house.
Too-Too of course could always apparently stay awake with more comfort
during night hours than in daylight. He and the Doctor were, I think,

somewhere between <<six|90>> and <<nine in the morning|5>>, was continuing his study
of the strange visitor. He had evidently been trying out various foods,
because great quantities of different edibles lay about the lawn. What
strange instinct had guided the Doctor finally to honey I do not know,
for certainly this giant specimen did not look like any of the
honey-sucking moths with which we were familiar. But certainly John
Dolittle had hit upon a food agreeable to the creature even if it was
not his natural one. When I came up to them he was just setting to on a
new comb while the empty frames of six others lay around him on the

night is very important. Well, to-night happened to be the full

worked the last weeks, I wouldn't wonder if he didn't wake up for a
fortnight. But we're having visitors some more. I don't know what to do

For all sorts of people are peering in at the garden gate. It is now

balloon to go up or something. Bumpo of course is still dead to the

Chee-Chee. I think you ought to get down and take a look at things. It

through the windows of the house as he passed from one room to another.

well down to the horizon and a coolness in the air spoke of coming
darkness, John Dolittle opened the back door and hurried out on to the
