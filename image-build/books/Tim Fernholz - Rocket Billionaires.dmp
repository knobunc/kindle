            'That year, Blackmore began work at the Texas launch range on the SpaceX project called Grasshopper. It, too, was reminiscent of the DC-X, involving a small prototype of a rocket that could launch, hover, and return to earth. The Grasshopper was just a hundred feet tall and mounted on metal struts. In September 2012, it took its first hop into the air; a year later, it flew three-quarters of a mile in its final test. By <<2014|9n:0>>, the reusability engineers were using a 130-foot-tall, full-scale first stage of the Falcon 9, equipped with four space-rated, retractable landing legs. They sent it as high as 3,300 feet in the air to hover before returning to settle gently down on the landing pad. During one test, the landing legs actually caught fire, delivering a biblical image of a flaming sword in the air for any passing eschatologists. During another test, a blocked sensor caused the rocket to veer away from the safe area; automated software blew the rocket up to prevent it from endangering anyone. The explosion attracted local interest and press criticism, but it did not daunt the engineers.',

It raised more money from investors in the Middle East and began to prepare its team for the move to New Mexico to begin normal operations. But, just as the Apollo program had overtaken the work of the rocket plane test pilots in the 1960s, vertical-launching rocket companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin had stolen Virgin Galactic\x{2019}s thunder. The X Prize win that had catalyzed the company seemed as distant as the idea of a spaceline carrying paying passengers around the world.",

            "SpaceX had experimented with different techniques for loading propellant into the Falcon 9 throughout 2016. This led to launches being scrubbed at the last minute when pressures or temperatures were outside nominal levels. It was another shared challenge faced by rocket companies pushing the edges of performance: the technicians behind the computer-controlled plumbing that precisely fueled the Falcon 9 were distant cousins of the X Prize\x{2013}winning flight engineers who awoke at <<2 a.m.|5>> to slosh SpaceShipOne\x{2019}s nitrous oxide around in a tank until it reached the correct temperature. Trial and error eventually left SpaceX with a process that, it seemed, could reliably load the superchilled propellant.",

If any firm had the hubris and the resources to launch its own satellite constellation, it would be the search kings of Mountain View, California. They hired Wyler to explore the possibilities of the scheme, and he worked with Google for months on a plan for a billion-dollar satellite scheme. He left in 2014, in an apparent dispute over the reach of the program and the software-driven company\x{2019}s unwillingness to make the big up-front investments in advanced manufacturing technology needed to produce the satellites.

Even though for years Amazon had plowed almost all of its profits back into expansion, its stock was a Wall Street favorite, because it grew like some terrifying science fiction blob, eating entire industries in a gulp. This led investors to overlook various controversies at the company, like antitrust disputes with book publishers, armies of low-wage temps at its distribution centers, and privacy questions about its always listening home assistants.
