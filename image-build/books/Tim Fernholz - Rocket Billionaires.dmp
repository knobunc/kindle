            "Never one to miss an opportunity for the limelight, Branson began drumming up business for Virgin Galactic with gusto. He sold tickets to space for \$250,000 a seat, which he bought for himself and his family and then hawked to celebrities like Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie, and Stephen Hawking. The first flights were expected to begin in 2007 from a new \x{201c}spaceport\x{201d} in New Mexico. Given the relative speed with which the Ansari X Prize had been won\x{2014}less than eight years of work between announcement and achievement\x{2014}commercializing the design seemed like a fairly trivial engineering problem. It was <<2004|9c:0>>, and the space age that Americans had been promised for decades finally seemed within grasp.",

            "Virgin Galactic\x{2019}s first flight kept being pushed further and further into the future. The same eccentricities that made Rutan the right person to hand-build an experimental spacecraft also brought him difficulty in designing one that could operate with consistent safety and be manufactured efficiently. The nature of a space plane like Rutan\x{2019}s is that it is neither fish nor fowl, perfect for neither atmospheric flight nor the vacuum of space, and it relied on a folding wing and an unusual propulsion system, both of which presented challenges. Its first spacecraft would not even perform a test flight until <<2014|9c:0>>, more than a decade after its prototype flew twice in one week. As of press time, none of its more than seven hundred paying customers have actually climbed into a spacecraft and ventured beyond the atmosphere. This long delay, combined with Branson\x{2019}s nonstop promotional promises, bolstered the reputation of the \x{201c}new space\x{201d} business as one dominated by dilettantes.",

            "In one test cycle, the team ran out of liquid oxygen\x{2014}half of the critical propellant needed to light the engine. A combination of a broken storage valve, unexpected high temperatures, and poor planning left them with nothing to do except charter more planes to fly to Hawaii for tanks of LOX. Another anecdote, relayed in a blog post written by Musk\x{2019}s brother, Kimbal, during a visit to the \x{201c}rocket island,\x{201d} underlines the SpaceX team\x{2019}s Herculean efforts. The electronic circuits that powered the Falcon 1\x{2019}s computer systems were acting up, and the engineers decided to replace them. The rocket was pulled down and the circuit boards were removed and given to an avionics engineer, Bulent Altan, who flew back to California overnight. That same day\x{2014}a Sunday\x{2014}a SpaceX intern was dispatched by plane from California to Minnesota to pick up new components from a supplier. Altan and the intern met at SpaceX headquarters on Monday morning, assembled the circuits, tested them, and packed them up. Altan then flew back to Kwaj, landing at <<6:00 a.m.|2a>> to begin installing the new components and reconstructing the rocket. The total turnaround time for this mission, according to the younger Musk, was eighty hours.",

Obama promised a graduated path from finishing the space station to developing a new spacecraft that would carry astronauts beyond the moon, first to visit an asteroid by 2025 and then to orbit Mars in the 2030s.
