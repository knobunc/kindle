            "\x{2018}Of course the lady knows that, don\x{2019}t she?\x{2019} demanded Mr Blathers. \x{2018}Always interrupting you are, partner. This here Conkey Chickweed, Miss, kept a public-house over Battle-bridge way, and had a cellar where a good many young lords went to see cockfighting, and badger-drawing,1 and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I\x{2019}ve seen \x{2019}em off\x{2019}en. He warn\x{2019}t one of the family at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas-bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and, after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window, which was only a story high. He was wery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too, for he was woke by the noise, and, darting out of bed, fired a blunderbuss2 arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a hue-and-cry directly, and, when they came to look about \x{2019}em, found that Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood all the way to some palings a good distance off, and there they lost \x{2019}em. However he had made off with the blunt, and, consequently, the name of Mr Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette3 among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don\x{2019}t know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets for three or four days, pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day he come up to the office all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a good deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in, (Jem was a active officer,) and tells him to go and assist Mr Chickweed in apprehending the man that robbed his house. \x{201c}I see him, Spyers,\x{201d} said Chickweed, \x{201c}pass my house yesterday morning.\x{201d} \x{2013} \x{201c}Why didn\x{2019}t you up, and collar him?\x{201d} says Spyers. \x{2013} \x{201c}I was so struck all of a heap that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\x{201d} says the poor man; \x{201c}but we\x{2019}re sure to have him, for between <<ten|20>> and <<eleven o\x{2019}clock at night|6>> he passed again.\x{201d} Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind a little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt at a moment\x{2019}s notice. He was smoking his pipe here late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out \x{2013} \x{201c}Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!\x{201d} Jem Spyers dashed out; and there he sees Chickweed tearing down the street full-cry. Away goes Spyers; on keeps Chickweed; round turn the people; everybody roars out \x{201c}Thieves!\x{201d} and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time like mad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner, \x{2013} shoots round \x{2013} sees a little crowd \x{2013} dives in. \x{201c}Which is the man?\x{201d} \x{2013} \x{201c}D \x{2013} me!\x{201d} says Chickweed, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve lost him again!\x{201d}",

1. register stoves\x{2026} This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to \x{2019}prentis: On a register stove metal plates could be opened and closed to regulate the passage of air, heat and smoke. Until <<1842|9n:0>>, when Lord Ashley (later Lord Shaftesbury) and other philanthropists made it illegal to force anyone under 21 to enter a chimney, the longstanding use of young boys as chimney-sweeps (to clean out soot from narrow chimneys) was a glaring abuse, attacked for example by William Blake (1757\x{2013}1827) in the poem \x{2018}The Chimney Sweeper\x{2019} (1794). \x{2018}Climbing Boys\x{2019} might suffocate or be burned, and were liable to a variety of occupational diseases. The 1834 Act for the Better Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and Their Apprentices made the minimum age for apprenticeship as a chimney-sweep ten years (by a householder; Gamfield is in arrears with rent, thus only a tenant, so strictly Oliver should be 14). Since 1788 the minimum had been eight years (in 1840 it became 16). Technically, that is, Oliver is still too young.",

CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN
1. It was late: There had been no instalment of Oliver Twist, nor of The Pickwick Papers, in June 1837, which caused rumours about \x{2018}Boz\x{2019} to abound. Dickens had been stunned by the sudden death on 7 May of his wife\x{2019}s sister, Mary Hogarth (1819\x{2013}37), who had frequently been a member of their household. \x{2018}She went up stairs to bed at <<about one o\x{2019}Clock|6>> in perfect health and her usual delightful spirits; was taken ill before she had undressed; and died in my arms next afternoon at <<3 o\x{2019}Clock|6>>. Everything that could be done was done but nothing could save her. The medical men imagine it was a disease of the heart.\x{2019} In the same letter, Dickens wrote that \x{2018}I have lost the dearest friend I ever had\x{2026} She had not a single fault, and was in life almost as far above the foibles and vanity of her sex and age as she is now in Heaven.\x{2019}",

1. Edmonton\x{2026} Battle-bridge\x{2026} badger-drawing: Edmonton was in 1831 a pleasant little town of 7900 inhabitants on the Lea river, 7 miles north of London. Battle Bridge, in the eighteenth century a small village, was the name for the district (down the hill from Mr Brownlow in Pentonville) now known as King\x{2019}s Cross \x{2013} from the short-lived monument bearing a statue of George IV that was erected in 1836 and removed, having been widely deplored, by <<1845|9n:0>> (see also note 5 to III, 5). The father of one of Dickens\x{2019}s earliest friends, Thomas Mitton, was, like Conkey Chickweed, a publican there. Cockfighting and badger-drawing (both outlawed in 1849) were popular blood sports. In cockfighting two male fowl fought to the death with strapped-on spurs; in badger-drawing a badger was put in a hole, most often a barrel, and a dog was set after it. Spectators would bet on the outcome.",
