            'In the seventh grade they were studying "pi." It was a Greek letter that looked like the architecture at Stonehenge, in England: two vertical pillars with a crossbar at top--?. If you measured the circumference of a circle and then divided it by the diameter of the circle, that was pi. At home, Ellie took the top of a mayonnaise jar, wrapped a string around it, straightened the string out, and with a ruler measured the circle\'s circumference. She did the same with the diameter, and by long division divided the one number by the other. She got <<3.21|5a:0>>. That seemed simple enough.',

As nearly as she could figure out from what she read, her question wasn\'t all that stupid. According to the Bible, the ancient Hebrews had apparently thought that ? was exactly equal to three. The Greeks and Romans, who knew lots of things about mathematics, had no idea that the digits in ? went on forever without repeating. It was a fact that had been discovered only about 250 years ago. How was she expected to know if she couldn\'t ask questions? But Mr. Weisbrod had been right about the first few digits. Pi wasn\'t <<3.21|5a:0>>. Maybe the mayonnaise lid had been a little squashed, not a perfect circle. Or maybe she\'d been sloppy in measuring the string. Even if she\'d been much more careful, though, they couldn\'t expect her to measure an infinite number of decimals.',

            'For decades <<after 1945|18:0>>, the world stockpile of strategic nuclear weapons had steadily grown. Leaders changed, weapons systems changed, strategy changed, but the number of strategic weapons only increased. The time came when there were more than 25,000 of them on the planet, ten for every city. The technology was pushing toward short flight time, incentives for hard-target first strike, and at least de facto launch-on-warning. Only so monumental a danger could undo so monumental a foolishness, endorsed by so many leaders in so many nations for so long a time. but finally the world came to its senses, at least to this extent, and an accord was signed by the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and China. It was not intended to rid the world of nuclear weapons. Few expected it to carry some Utopia in its wake. But the Americans and the Russians undertook to diminish the strategic arsenals down to a thousand nuclear weapons each. The details were carefully designed so that neither superpower was at any significant disadvantage at any stage of the dismantling process. Britain, France, and China agreed to begin reducing their arsenals once the superpowers had gone below the 3,200 mark. The Hiroshima Accords were signed, to worldwide rejoicing, next to the famous commemorative plaque for the victims in the first city ever obliterated by a nuclear weapon: "Rest in peace, for it shall never happen again."',
