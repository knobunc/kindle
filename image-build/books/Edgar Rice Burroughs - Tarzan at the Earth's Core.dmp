I found a very complete exposition of the theory in a book written <<about 1830|18:0>> and in another work of more recent time. Therein I found what seemed to be a reasonable explanation of many well known phenomena that have not been satisfactorily explained by any hypothesis endorsed by science.\x{201d}",

But if any of you has been watching the sun for the last few hours, I think that you will have to agree with me that even though there may be no polar opening into an inner world, there must be a great depression at this point in the earth\x{2019}s crust and that we had gone down into it for a considerable distance, for you will notice that the <<midnight|13>> sun is much lower than it should be and that the further we continue upon this course the lower it drops\x{2013}eventually it will set completely, and if I am not much mistaken we shall soon see the light of the eternal <<noonday|13>> sun of Pellucidar.\x{201d}",
