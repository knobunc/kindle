On the right-hand entrance-wall are, or were, two fine sabres (fig. 53) of Eucalyptus-wood, labelled \x{2018}Schwert von Bowen (Queensland).\x{2019} The Sandwich Islanders, we see, still wield the Sword-club with sharp-cutting edges, like their neighbours of New Ireland. The savage Solomon Archipelago has supplied a two-handed sabre of light and bright-yellow wood; its longitudinal midrib shows direct derivation from the paddle-club. There is also a lozenge-shaped hand-club, which may readily have given a model to metal-workers. It is of hard, dark, and polished wood, and the handle is whipped round with coir (Tafel xx. p. 97): the length is seventy cent. by <<four|9:0>> of maximum breadth. The Swords are unfortunately not figured in the catalogue; but there is a fine wooden knife forty-nine cent. long by six cent. broad, with open handle and highly-worked grip (Tafel xxi. p. 135). It comes from Vanna Lava, Banks Group, New Hebrides, Polynesia (fig. 55).1",

            "The Japanese copper2\x{a0}is of the finest quality, and is used as a standard of comparison. The superiority of the metal, which contains a percentage of gold, enabled the self-taught native workmen to produce those castings which are the admiration and the despair of the European artist. The copper delivered at Nagasaki and Kwashi is from Beshki, Akita, and Nambu ; other places produce the more ordinary kinds. The rich red surface is due to a thin and tenaciously adhering film of dioxide : this has been imitated in England. The famous Satzuma copper, held to be the best in the world, was prepared under Government officials, none being sold privately. The ore was roasted in kilns for ten to twenty days, smelted in large furnaces with charcoal, and cast in water to make the well-known Japanese ingots. These were bars measuring about half an inch on the side, by <<seven|9:0>> to nine inches in length, and weighing some ten taels, nearly equal to one pound. They were packed in boxes each weighing a picul (=125 to 133\x{a0}lbs. avoir.), about the load of a man. The price of course greatly varied. The trade was at first wholly in the hands of the Hollanders, who made a good thing of their monopoly. There was also an old traffic in Japanese copper on the eastern coast of India, especially Coromandel. The opening of the empire has caused revolutionary changes.",

            "Beckmann tells us, in his valuable \x{2018}History of Inventions,\x{2019}4 \x{2018}in the course of time an ore which must have been calamine (carbonate of zinc) or blende5 (sulphuret of zinc), was added to copper, and gave it a yellow colour. The addition made it harder, more fusible and sonorous, easily subject to the lathe, more economical to work, and a worse conductor of heat than the pure metal.\x{2019} We have few specimens of old art-works in \x{2018}brass\x{2019} proper, although zinc was discovered by analysis in an ancient Sword, chiefly copper.6 Gibel assures us that zinc occurs only in Roman alloys, the bronze of the Greeks containing nothing beyond copper, tin, and lead. The Romans also could varnish or lacquer brass, but it is not known whence they derived the art. Percy notes (p. 521) that brass was produced \x{2018}early in the Christian era, if not before its commencement\x{2019} He quotes in proof a large coin of the Cassia Gens (B.C. 20) which contained copper 82.26 and zinc <<17.31|5a:0>>; a Vespasian (Rome, A.D. 71), an imperial Trajan (Caria, cire. A.D. 110), a Geta (Carian Mylasa, A.D.189\x{2013}212), a Greek Caracalla (A.D. 199), and many others. In modern times zinciferous ore was imported by the Portuguese from the East a century before it was common throughout Europe.7 In the early seventeenth century the Dutch captured one of their craft laden with spelter, and the secret became known. Bishop Richard Watson says (1783) the cargo was calaem, \x{2018}which he connects with \x{2018}calamine\x{2019}: the latter, like the German Galmei, derives from cadmia.",

The weapon is to a certain extent North European, and seems to have travelled up the valleys of great rivers : Denmark has yielded two hundred and <<fifty to six|10a:0>> Italian bronze blades.1 They are as a rule of fair length, averaging about seventy-five centimetres : the profile is either leaf-shaped, sub-leaf-shaped, or straight, ending in a bevelled point. The hilt is of two kinds : either tanged or untanged: the tang is broad, long, and pierced, with one or more holes for riveting ; in this case the handle was of wood, bone, or horn. Many hefts, however, as will afterwards appear, are cast in a single piece with or without guard ; and the latter often disappears in a hollow triangular base, a crescent or horse-shoe containing the shoulders with the concavity of the arch towards the point ; this also served in many weapons to receive the rivets. The pommel is of various patterns, frequently a cone, oval, globe, or dome with steps or with melon-like ridges.2 In others, especially amongst the old Kelts and Germans, it ended with a crutch or crescent whose cusps were, in the richer kinds, adorned with spirals.',

            "And as they were advanced in literature and politics, the religion of earth, so they assiduously cultivated religion, the politics of heaven. The Biblical student has found among the tombs of Nile-land the absolute truth of what Celsus said\x{2014}namely, that the Hebrews borrowed their tenets and practices from Egypt. Their date of the creation ex nihilo (B.C. 4004\x{2013}4620) was evidently Manetho\x{2019}s period of the succession of Mena, and it is used even in our day. Their genesitic cosmogony, as Philo Judaeus shows, and as Origen expressly declares, was an adaptation of Nilotic allegories and mysteries which the vulgar understood factually and literally. Their \x{2018}Adam\x{2019} suggests \x{2018}Atum,\x{2019} whence \x{2018}Adima,\x{2019} the First Man amongst the Hindus. Their App or Apap (Apophis), whose determinative is a snake transfixed with four knife-blades,1 is the great old serpent, the ophid-giant, Sin, Sathanas. The \x{2018}Flood\x{2019}2 is the annual Nilotic inundation modified by the Izdubar legends of the Interamnian Plain. Noah, Nuh, N\x{f6}e, is suspiciously like Nu or Nuhu,3 the Sailor of the Waters, the Lord of the Full Nile. Ham suggests Kam, the black race. The ark is the Bahr or Ua (Baris, Argo navis) of Nu, the sacred vessel portrayed in the ruins of Egyptian Elephanta, the boat of Osiris, or Uasur, the man-formed Sun-god; and the floating cradle of Moses is a mere replica of Osiris\x{2019} ark. In that complicated idolatry of deceased ancestors, based upon a system of monotheism,4 or rather the worship of glorified man, which formed the religion of Egypt, the Sun typified human life. He rose as the infant Horus; he was the Lord Ka of the <<mid-day|13>>; as Tum he became old and set; and as Hormakhu (Harmachis) he shone to the under world below the horizon, Night and Death being the forerunners of Light and Life.5",

The flat field is surrounded by a rim () an inch and a half high; the umbo ()2 measured two and one-third by four and one-third across, and this boss was bounded by a furrow () two-fifths of an inch across (p. 324). Thus Antyx and Aulax, suited for mounting a guard of hide, recall Ajax\x{2019}s seven-fold shield, made by Tychius3 (\x{2018}Il.\x{2019} vii. 219\x{2013}223); and Sarpedon\x{2019}s targe, with its round plate of hammered \x{2018}Chalcos,\x{2019} and its hide-covering attached to the inner edge of the rim by gold wires or rivets (\x{2018}Il.\x{2019} xii. 294\x{2013}97). Near the left hand of a Lebes-chauldron, two fragments of a lance and a battle-axe were firmly attached by fusion. There were thirteen copper lances, from nearly seven inches to upwards of a foot long, with <<one and a half to two|10>> and one-third inches of maximum breadth; the shafts had pin-holes for attachment to the handle; the Greeks and Romans inserted the wood into the neck of the metal-head of the lance. There was a common one-edged knife six inches long; and of seven two-edged daggers, the largest measured ten and two-thirds by two inches. The grips averaged <<two to two|10a:0>> and three-quarter inches, and the tang-ends, where the pommels should be, were bent round at a right angle. Doubtless the tang had been encased in a wooden haft; had it been of bone some trace would have remained, and the point, which projected about half an inch, was simply turned to keep the handle in place. This antiquated contrivance is not yet wholly obsolete, especially when the metal is left naked. The only sign of a Sword (p. 332) was a fragmentary blade five inches and two-thirds long by nearly two inches broad, and with a sharp edge at the chisel-like end.
