            lustful dreaming. The date wasn\x{2019}t totally blind\x{2014}\x{201d}just very short-sighted,\x{201d} Catherine Fedden said, when Nick showed her the
            photograph and the letter. She seemed to like the look of the man, who was called Leo, and who she said was so much her type;
            but his handwriting made her jumpy. It was both elaborate and impetuous. Catherine had a paperback called Graphology: The Mind in the Hand, which gave her all sorts of warnings about people\x{2019}s tendencies and repressions (\x{201c}Artist or Madman?\x{201d} \x{201c}Pet or Brute?\x{201d}). \x{201c}It\x{2019}s

            not. He had been excited, and even rather moved, to get this letter from a stranger; but it was true the text itself raised
            few expectations. \x{201c}Nick\x{2014}OK! Ref your letter, am in Personnel (London Borough of Brent). We can meet up, discuss Interests

            them, an oiled click, and they were together in the near-darkness of the shrubbery. Nick wanted to hold Leo and kiss him at
            once; but he wasn\x{2019}t quite certain. Bumshoving was unambiguous, and encouraging, but not romantic exactly \x{2026} They strolled
            cautiously forward, leaning against each other for a step or two as they steered for the path. There was the slightest chill
            in the air now, but Nick shivered wildly in a spasm of excitement. His fingers felt oddly stiff, as though he was wearing
            very tight gloves. Even in the deep shadow he wanted to conceal his weird smirk of apprehension. He did so hope it would be
            him who got to do the shoving, but didn\x{2019}t know how you arranged that, perhaps it all just became clear. Perhaps they both
            had to have a go. He led Leo through on to a wide inner lawn, the bike bouncing out beside them, controlled only by a hand

            beech whose branches plunged to the ground and made a broad bell-tent that was cool and gloomy even at <<midday|13>>. Away to the
            left ran the gravel walk, and beyond it the tall outline of the terrace, and the long, intermitted rhythm of glowing windows.

            stowed the overnight luggage in the Range Rover, and then Gerald drove them out, past blocked-off streets, through gathering
            crowds. Everywhere there were groups of policemen, to whom he nodded and raised his hand authoritatively from the wheel. Nick,
            sitting in the back with Elena, felt foolish and conceited at once. He dreaded seeing Leo, on his bike, and dreaded being
            seen by Leo. He imagined him cruising the carnival, and yearned to belong there in the way that Leo did. He saw him dancing
            happily with strangers in the street, or biding his turn in the dense mutating crowds at the underground urinals. His longing

            was propped up among sprawling friends. He had been given the King\x{2019}s Room, where Edward VII had slept\x{2014}the swags of blue silk
            above the bedhead were gathered into a vaguely comic gilded crown. On the opposite wall hung a comfortable Renoir nude. Nick

            tie undone and his head on the thigh of an attractive drunk girl. The curtains were parted and a window open to carry the
            reek of marijuana far away from the nose of the Home Secretary. Somehow they had re-created the mood of a college room late
            at night, girls\x{2019} stockinged feet stretched out across boyfriends\x{2019} knees, smoke in the air, two or three voices dominating.
            Nick felt the charm as well as the threat of the group. Gareth Lane was holding forth about Hitler and Goebbels, and his lecturing
            drone and yapping laughs at his own puns brought back something dreary from the Oxford days. He was said to be the \x{201c}ablest
            historian of his year,\x{201d} but he had failed to get a first, and seemed now to be acting out some endless redemptive viva. The

            and words were an intrusion \x{2026} and yet left no trace. Several of his other pals were here, but the two months since term
            had distanced them more than he could explain. Some simple but strong and long-prepared change had occurred, they had taken

            was a beautiful effect, so much bigger than the party: the world turning, the bright practical phrases of the first birds.

            heavy thought was just how little any of them cared\x{2014}they could never begin to imagine a date with a waiter, or the disaster

            standing there, smiling cautiously, like someone not on to a joke; but when he looked at the others they seemed equally stilled
            and bemused. It must be some amazingly strong stuff Nick thought his way towards moving his left leg forward, he could coax
            his thought down through the knee to the foot, but it died there with no chance of becoming an action. It was slightly trying
            if he had to stand here for a long time. He looked more boldly round at the others, not easy to name at the moment, some of
            them. Slow blinks, little twitches of smiles. \x{201c}Yah \x{2026} \x{201d} said Nat Hanmer, very measuredly, nodding his head, agreeing with

            \x{201c}I know Liszt enjoyed playing it \x{2026}\x{201d}) From time to time he would break off his pitiless ascent of the keyboard to dash
            out juicy chords and arpeggios, with the air of a frustrated concert pianist, which was even worse than the tuning. Little
            Nina, too, drove them mad with her fragments of Chopin and Schubert, which went on long enough to catch and lull the heart
            before they dropped it again, over and over. She had a lot of temperament and a terrifying left hand. She played the beginning
            of Chopin\x{2019}s Scherzo No. 2 like a courier starting a motorbike. When she\x{2019}d finished Nick helped Elena bring up and arrange
            the old gilt ballroom chairs from the trou de gloire. The sofas were trundled into new alignments, tall flower arrangements mounted the stairs on Elena\x{2019}s legs, and the room took
            on an unnerving appearance of readiness. Nick had one more task to do, which was to phone Ronnie, and he eyed the clock, in
            the run-up to six, as jumpily as if he was giving a recital himself.",

            (A quarter-ounce, seven grams, was the only metric equivalent Nick had yet been able to memorize.) The downside of Ronnie
            was a strange delaying manner that would have seemed sleepy if it hadn\x{2019}t been also a kind of vigilance. He never rushed, he
            was never on time, and he had a puzzled porous memory. Nick had only met him once, when they\x{2019}d driven round the block in his
            red Toyota and he\x{2019}d watched the simple way the exchange was made. Ronnie was a cockneyfied Jamaican, with a tall shaved head
            and doleful eyes. He talked a lot about girlfriend troubles, perhaps just to make things clear. His voice was an intimate
            murmur, and since he was giving them something they wanted he had seemed to Nick both seductive and forgivable.",

            "The Tippers were not natural holidayers. They came beautifully equipped, with four heavy steel-cornered suitcases, and numerous
            other little bags which had to be handled carefully, but something else, unnoticed by them, was missing. They muttered questions
            to each other, and gave an impression of covert anxiety or irritation. When they came down on their first afternoon Sir Maurice
            said a lot of faxes would be coming through for him, and could they be sure there was enough paper in the machine. He was
            clearly looking forward to the arrival of the faxes above all. Wani sucked up to him and said he was expecting some faxes
            too, meaning that he would keep an eye on the machine, but Sir Maurice gave him a sharp look and said he hoped they wouldn\x{2019}t
            impede his own faxes. It was only <<four thirty|5k:1>> but Gerald was marking his guests\x{2019} arrival with a Pimm\x{2019}s, and Lady Partridge,
            with her son as her licence, accompanied him in a gin and Dubonnet. The Tippers asked for tea, and sat under the awning, glancing
            mistrustfully at the view. When Liliane, slow, stoical, and clearly unwell, came out with the tray, Sally Tipper gave her
            instructions about different pillows she needed. Sir Maurice talked to Gerald about a takeover they were both interested in,
            though Gerald didn\x{2019}t look quite serious with a fruit-choked tumbler in his fist. Lady Tipper complained to Rachel about the
            smell of hot dogs in the Royal Festival Hall. Rachel said surely that would all change now they\x{2019}d got rid of Red Ken, but
            Lady Tipper shook her head as if deaf to any such comfort. Nick tried naively to interest Maurice Tipper in local beauty spots
            which he hadn\x{2019}t yet seen himself. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re a fine one to talk!\x{201d} said Sir Maurice\x{2014}grinning quickly at Gerald and Toby to show
            he wasn\x{2019}t so easily taken in. He was used to total deference, and mere pleasantness aroused his suspicion. The democracy of
            house-party life wasn\x{2019}t going to come naturally to him. Nick looked at his smooth clerical face and gold rimmed glasses in
            the light of a new idea, that the ownership of immense wealth might not be associated with pleasure\x{2014}at least as pleasure was
            sought and unconsciously defined by the rest of them here.",

            and the enjoyable phase of remembering it and analysing it could begin. The shrieks and bangs of fireworks sounded from the
            neighbourhood gardens. Sometimes a rocket streaked up over the housetops and shed its stars into the low-hanging cloud. Duffel-coated
            children were hurried through the murk. Nick\x{2019}s route was an improvised zigzag, an intention glimpsed and disowned; no one
