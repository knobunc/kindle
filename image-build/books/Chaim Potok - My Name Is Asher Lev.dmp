In my dark-blue winter coat and hat, and with my thin pale features and red hair and dangling earlocks, I was not exactly a typical New Yorker. At one point in the journey, during a particularly long ride between stations, I opened my Guernica sketchbook and began leafing through the drawings.

I am not doing this as a favor to the Rebbe. I have respect for the Rebbe, but I have passion for my art. The Rebbe asked me to guide you and to keep you from evil ways. Those were his words. I do not know what evil is when it comes to art. I only know what is good art and what is bad art. Those were my words to the Rebbe. The Rebbe trusts me and will rely on my honest heart.

If an artist is not deceitful every so often in the cause of his art, then he is a poor artist. Those were my remarks to the Rebbe. Still, he trusts me. So be it. He trusts me. But it is of no real consequence to me whether the Rebbe does or does not trust me. I am taking you on not as a favor to the Rebbe but because you have greatness. I am selfish. All artists are selfish and self-centered. I am taking you on because I will derive pleasure in molding your greatness, just as I derive pleasure in molding clay and marble. For five years, I will sculpt you and bring out of you what is already inside you. I will work with your faults and flaws and genius, as Michelangelo worked with the flaws and power of the marble that became his David. Are you listening to me, Asher Lev? Do you hear me, Anna?

I did not even know her name. I saw the flowing curve of the breasts. I saw the line of shoulders and hip and thigh and leg. I drew her carefully. My arm felt nerveless, drained of its strength. I felt sweat in my armpits and along my back. My face dripped sweat. Jacob Kahn stood behind me, watching. I finished the drawing. It was very bad. I felt ashamed. I took a deep breath and moved to a clean sheet of paper and began again. The girl sat very still, bathed in sunlight. I looked at her and worked carefully, translating her body into lines, making choices, each curve, each subtle change in the flow of her flesh, necessitating an interpreting choice of line. I started a third drawing. Jacob Kahn signaled to her. She changed her pose, sitting forward on the chair, her face in her hands, her breasts suddenly pendulous. I drew her that way twice. She changed her pose again, sitting with one leg up on the chair, clasping the leg to herself with her arms, her chin resting on her knee, her thighs open. I drew her that way and then drew her again in two more poses before it was time for lunch. I ate the sandwich my aunt had packed for me.

Aren\x{2019}t you well now, Mama? I\x{2019}ll make more birds and flowers for you, Mama.

No, it wasn\x{2019}t enough. They had to be moved into the public arena. You communicate in a public arena; everything else is puerile and cowardly. I could not sleep. I lay awake hours in the dark.

I thought I heard the word \x{201c}museum.\x{201d} They went into their bedroom. I remained awake. There was faint gray light along the rim of my window. Is it morning already? Is it Sunday?

My mother came into the room after a while, glanced through the Times, and sat down at her desk near the window. I sat on an easy chair and watched them. The Venetian blind had been raised. Sunlight streamed into the room, touching my parents, the furniture, the rug, the walls with a faintly shimmering luminosity, with the warm golden light of the Rembrandt world. I sat there a long time, very still, watching them. Then I rose quietly and went to my room. I had to be in the gallery at <<one|9c:1>>. The opening was at <<three|9c:1>>. I dressed quickly, feeling a leaden heaviness in my arms and legs.',

            "I came out of the Rebbe\x{2019}s office and walked past Rav Dorochoff\x{2019}s angry gaze and out of the building. I walked for hours then beneath the naked trees of the parkway along streets that had once been my world but were now cold and gone from me. Sometime during the walking, I stopped in front of a mound of snow and with my finger drew in one continuous line the contour of my face. Asher Lev in snow on a cold Brooklyn parkway. Asher Lev, Hasid. Asher Lev, painter. I looked at my right hand, the hand with which I painted. There was power in that hand. Power to create and destroy. Power to bring pleasure and pain. Power to amuse and horrify. There was in that hand the demonic and the divine at <<one|9c:1>> and the same time. The demonic and the divine were two aspects of the same force. Creation was demonic and divine. Creativity was demonic and divine. Art was demonic and divine. The solitary vision that put new eyes into gouged-out sockets was demonic and divine. I was demonic and divine. Asher Lev, son of Aryeh and Rivkeh Lev, was the child of the Master of the Universe and the Other Side. Asher Lev paints good pictures and hurts people he loves. Then be a great painter, Asher Lev; that will be the only justification for all the pain you will cause. But as a great painter I will cause pain again if I must. Then become a greater painter. But I will cause pain again. Then become a still greater painter. Master of the Universe, will I live this way all the rest of my life? Yes, came the whisper from the branches of the trees. Now journey with me, my Asher. Paint the anguish of all the world. Let people see the pain. But create your own molds and your own play of forms for the pain. We must give a balance to the universe.",
