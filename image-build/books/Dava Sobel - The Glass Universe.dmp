It measured about the same dimensions as a picture frame, eight inches by ten, and no thicker than a windowpane. It was coated on one side with a fine layer of photographic emulsion, which now held several thousand stars fixed in place, like tiny insects trapped in amber. One of the men had stood outside all night, guiding the telescope to capture this image, along with another dozen in the pile of glass plates that awaited her when she reached the observatory at <<9 a.m.|5>> Warm and dry indoors in her long woolen dress, she threaded her way among the stars. She ascertained their positions on the dome of the sky, gauged their relative brightness, studied their light for changes over time, extracted clues to their chemical content, and occasionally made a discovery that got touted in the press. Seated all around her, another twenty women did the same.',

It received no support from the college to pay salaries, purchase supplies, or publish the results of its labors. Aside from interest on its endowment and income from its exact-time service, the observatory depended entirely on private bequests and contributions. A decade had passed since the last solicitation for funds. Pickering soon convinced some seventy astronomy enthusiasts to pledge \$50 to \$200 per year for five years, and while those subscriptions trickled in, he sold the grass cuttings from the six-acre observatory grounds at a small profit. (They brought in about \$30 a year, or enough to cover some <<120 hours|1>>\x{2019} worth of computing time.)",

            "Miss Cannon and Miss Maury, also part of the observatory\x{2019}s old guard, had originally stood out because of their college education in astronomy. By <<1925|9u>> they were flanked by easily a dozen female students, alumnae, and holders of advanced degrees. Margaret Harwood, for one, had gone out West to earn her master\x{2019}s years before Shapley bent the Pickering Fellowship to the purpose of graduate study. Adelaide Ames and Cecilia Payne were currently guiding the research of two master\x{2019}s candidates, Harvia Hastings Wilson from Vassar and Margaret Walton of Swarthmore College. The observatory also embraced a new rank of female guest researcher, in the person of Professor Priscilla Fairfield, Ph.D. Miss Fairfield had earned her doctorate in astronomy in 1921 at the University of California, Berkeley, and since then taught courses in \x{201c}Celestial Mechanics\x{201d} and \x{201c}Measurement and Reduction of Photographic Plates\x{201d} at Smith College in western Massachusetts. When she first came to work at Harvard in the summer of 1923, she asked for only a modest allowance toward local living expenses. In 1925, in addition to her summer stay, she was making the two-hundred-mile round trip between Northampton and Cambridge on any weekend when rain released her from supervisory duty at Smith\x{2019}s student observatory.",

Shapley\x{2019}s strenuous campaigning on behalf of the observatory had brought in \$200,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation\x{2019}s International Education Board and an equal amount from sources within the university\x{2014}enough to transplant the Boyden Station at last from Peru to South Africa. In November 1926 the Parases started packing the equipment for the voyage east. They planned to use the Bruce as the premier telescope at Bloemfontein until a larger, more modern one replaced it. Construction of a 60-inch reflector, destined to be the biggest in the Southern Hemisphere, was already under way in Pittsburgh at the firm of J. W. Fecker.",

When he invited the IAU to Harvard, the director begged to let four years instead of the usual three\x{2014}just this once\x{2014}elapse between meetings. The delay would enable an entertainment comparable to that at past receptions in the capitals of Europe, where potentates of church and state had presided over opulent ceremonies. In place of those trappings, the more homespun Harvard general assembly promised the natural miracle of a total solar eclipse. <<Shortly before four o\x{2019}clock|6>> local time on Wednesday afternoon, August 31, 1932, the Moon would obliterate the Sun, and the skies over New England would go dark. The visiting astronomers could distribute themselves along the path of totality from Quebec through parts of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, then pack up their equipment and repair to Cambridge.",

Wide publicity turned the event into a popular tourist attraction, and although most scientists who made observations were looking at the sky, a few measured the eclipse\x{2019}s effect on terrestrial phenomena such as radio transmissions and animal behavior. William Morton Wheeler, the Harvard myrmecologist, had read historical reports of ants that ceased all activity during eclipses, as though transfixed by the sudden <<midday|13>> darkness. Wheeler felt certain the ants were reacting to the rapid drop in temperature, not the absence of light. Eager to learn more, he put out a call for voluntary reports from interested parties.",

By <<1944|9:0>> the number of observatory staff engaged in full-time war-related work had risen from twenty-five to thirty-two. Meanwhile good weather continued to smile on Bloemfontein, where the quantity of glass plates in storage tested the available space. Shapley yearned to see the fruits of the latest two years\x{2019} labors in the Southern Hemisphere. Given the fairly reliable delivery of mail and supplies from England to Africa, and a sudden drop in insurance rates for international shipments, he asked Dr. Paraskevopoulos to send home some of the plates. About 1,500 photographs, or one-tenth of the accumulation, joined other cargo loaded aboard the Robin Goodfellow, bound from Cape Town to New York.
