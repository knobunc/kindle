It must have made writing difficult (and I would have thought robbed him of writing\'s chief pleasure: imaginative discovery); it makes some of his books lop-sided; and when Graham Greene described Cary\'s method to me he was chuckling rather sadly and shaking his head. On leaving Nigeria, Cary burnt most of his manuscripts. And he could: he had published a number of stories in the Saturday Evening Post, but that success (he was paid very well for them) did not sustain him for very long. The Post lost interest in his stories almost as soon as he took up residence in England. He continued to write, with very small reward, and it was not until <<1932|18:0>> that his first novel, Aissa Saved (begun in 1928), was published. M. M. Mahood\'s Cary\'s Africa (1964) is an illuminating guide to the African novels, but even her highly intelligent appraisal of Aissa does not persuade me that this book is anything but a muddle.',

And dangers: hills and beach-cliffs so steep you either hug them or fall off.

Corte is a bright windblown town on a crag, with at least one fine restaurant (in the Place Paoli). It is the heart of the island's political and cultural identity, and was the capital of the brief republic declared by Pascal Paoli in 1755. At Corte, if one seeks a destination, one has many choices: a short drive to the hunting lodges at Venaco, or the longer drives to Bastia, the quiet promontory of Ile-Rousse, the noisier resorts of Calvi or Porto. I struck out for Ile-Rousse and ended up at the two-hundred-year-old Grand Hotel Napoleon Bonaparte, a bizarrely ramshackle ch\x{e2}teau with a billiard room and a porter who tells you to go to bed when the clock strikes <<eleven|11>>.

I sat inside, deafened by the rain, and studied the Indian Railways Timetable, and after a while I became curious about the route of a certain train out of Amritsar. This particular mail train left Amritsar at <<ten in the evening|5>> and headed south on the main line to Delhi; but halfway there it made a hairpin turn at Ambala and raced north to Kalka where, at dawn, it connected with the railcar to Simla. It was an extraordinary route\x{2014}and a very fast train: instead of going to bed in the hotel, I could reserve a sleeper, and board the train, and more or less wake up in the foothills of the Himalayas, in Simla.",
