            "The family of Henry VIII, painted by an unknown artist. This picture, from <<1545|9c:0>>, depicts Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace with his offspring: his daughters twenty-nine-year-old Mary (left) and twelve-year-old Elizabeth (right), and, close at hand, his eight-year-old son, Edward, around whom Henry has an arm. It is an idealized image: the wife on Henry\x{2019}s left was not his wife in 1545 \x{2013} Kateryn Parr \x{2013} but rather his third wife, Jane Seymour, who gave him his son and heir. Curator Brett Dolman has observed that Henry, Jane and Edward appear very much as a Holy Family, adored by the two princesses. The man in the archway is Will Somer, the king\x{2019}s fool.",

After his accident in January 1536, Henry was never able to joust again, but he could still manage to hunt, as he morphed from an attractive youth into a monstrously obese and prematurely aged man. By <<1541|9:0>>, the French ambassador, Charles de Marillac, noted that the king had grown \x{2018}very stout\x{2019}.

The portrait allegorically depicts Surrey\x{2019}s royal descent from Edward the Confessor and Edward III (implied in his unwise heraldic quartering of the royal arms of Edward the Confessor with his own).

            "Just as with his grandfather Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham (in 1521), and later his son Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk (in 1572), Surrey\x{2019}s display of hubristic conceit in an age of personal monarchy and capital punishment was enough to spell his ruin. Pride, treason \x{2013} and execution \x{2013} seemed to run in the family. Surrey\x{2019}s foolishness now meant not only his own destruction, but that of his father \x{2013} yet it is hard to feel sorry for the old man. On the day before Surrey\x{2019}s trial, Norfolk confessed to concealing \x{2018}high treason\x{2026} most presumptuously committed by my son Henry Howard Earl of Surrey\x{2019}, thereby dictating the judicial outcome for his son.46 At the trial \x{2013} a long and public affair on 13 January 1547, which ran from <<nine in the morning|5>> until <<five at night|5>> \x{2013} Surrey defended himself with wit and courage, but all in vain.47 In fact, in an age when prosecution and the judiciary were one and the same, and where an indictment could create a crime, the result of Surrey\x{2019}s trial was probably never in doubt: he was found guilty. An Act of Attainder passed through Parliament on 24 January and condemned Surrey and Norfolk to forfeit their lands, chattels, titles, and offices \x{2013} and lives \x{2013} to the king.48 This was a mere rubber stamp to secure the Howard lands. On 19 January 1547, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey had already been beheaded.",

In an age of personal kingship, when a monarch needed to rule as well as reign, a minority was a deeply problematic and unstable time: an invitation to civil war, an incitement to noble tussles over position and precedence, and an opportunity for the unprincipled to seize power.7 Little wonder that the text often cited was Ecclesiastes 10, verses <<16\x{2013}17|5a:0>>: \x{2018}Woe to thee, O land, whose king is a boy!\x{2019} It was Henry\x{2019}s hope that a council of sixteen good men and true would steer the young Edward through these precarious years.",
