This picture, from <<1545|9c:0>>, depicts Henry VIII at Whitehall Palace with his offspring: his daughters twenty-nine-year-old Mary (left) and twelve-year-old Elizabeth (right), and, close at hand, his eight-year-old son, Edward, around whom Henry has an arm. It is an idealized image: the wife on Henry\x{2019}s left was not his wife in 1545 \x{2013} Kateryn Parr \x{2013} but rather his third wife, Jane Seymour, who gave him his son and heir.

First, <<around 1526|9e:1>>, Henry met the woman who was to be the love of his life, Anne Boleyn, and he started to imagine the possibility of children by another wife. Second, according to Henry\x{2019}s speech before the papal court at Blackfriars in 1529, which was convened to judge the validity of his marriage to Katherine, \x{2018}a certain scrupulosity\x{2026} pricked my conscience\x{2026} which doubt pricked, vexed and troubled so my mind, and so disquieted me, that I was in great doubt of God\x{2019}s indignation\x{2019}.10 This \x{2018}scrupulosity\x{2019} was the pressing concern that his lack of a male heir was an indication that he was being punished by God, and that the pope should never have given him a dispensation to marry his brother\x{2019}s widow, which was explicitly prohibited by Scripture (Leviticus Chapter 18, Verse 16 and Chapter 20, Verse 21).11 These pricks of conscience seem terribly convenient; but Henry was probably quite genuine in his conviction that his first marriage was a sham. He had an infinite capacity for self-delusion and was a great believer in the letter, rather than the spirit, of the law.",

            "When Henry first broke with the Church of Rome, the Church of England simply constituted a replacement of the pope\x{2019}s authority with that of the king. From 1536 onwards, however, Henry started to add a theological dimension to his political reformation. This was far from Lutheran. Henry had hated Luther ever since the German had been very rude about the king in response to Henry\x{2019}s book Assertio Septum Sacramentorum (The Defence of the Seven Sacraments), which had been a rebuttal of Luther\x{2019}s works. Yet, by <<1536|9e:1>>, Henry was no longer asserting that there were seven sacraments (the Mass, baptism, marriage, penance, confirmation, ordination and extreme unction). Instead, in the first doctrinal statement of the Church of England \x{2013} the Ten Articles, produced in 1536 \x{2013} Henry affirmed that there were only three sacraments (the Mass, baptism and penance). He defined his idiosyncratic religious position as somewhere between Protestantism and Catholicism: justification was by faith, but faith joined with charitable works, not faith alone; the sacrament of penance \x{2013} confession to, and absolution by, priests \x{2013} was essential; and Christ was really present in the bread and wine of the Mass. About Purgatory, he was ambivalent, conceding that it was good to pray for the souls of the dead, but that the place where they were was unknown.3",

Surrey\x{2019}s foolishness now meant not only his own destruction, but that of his father \x{2013} yet it is hard to feel sorry for the old man. On the day before Surrey\x{2019}s trial, Norfolk confessed to concealing \x{2018}high treason\x{2026} most presumptuously committed by my son Henry Howard Earl of Surrey\x{2019}, thereby dictating the judicial outcome for his son.46 At the trial \x{2013} a long and public affair on 13 January 1547, which ran from <<nine in the morning|5>> until <<five at night|5>> \x{2013} Surrey defended himself with wit and courage, but all in vain.47 In fact, in an age when prosecution and the judiciary were one and the same, and where an indictment could create a crime, the result of Surrey\x{2019}s trial was probably never in doubt: he was found guilty. An Act of Attainder passed through Parliament on 24 January and condemned Surrey and Norfolk to forfeit their lands, chattels, titles, and offices \x{2013} and lives \x{2013} to the king.48 This was a mere rubber stamp to secure the Howard lands. On 19 January 1547, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey had already been beheaded.",

            "There is a similar mystery over Henry\x{2019}s sixth succession scenario. If all the above failed \x{2013} if neither Edward, Kateryn Parr, any future wife, Mary nor Elizabeth bore heirs \x{2013} then the crown was to pass to \x{2018}the heirs of the body of Lady Frances, our niece, eldest daughter to our late sister the French Queen\x{2019} (folio 13). Lady Frances Grey was the daughter of Henry\x{2019}s younger sister, Mary Tudor (who had indeed been married to Louis XII of France) and Henry\x{2019}s best friend, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. Frances, in turn, had married Henry Grey, Marquess of Dorset, the grandson of Edward IV\x{2019}s queen, Elizabeth Woodville, and by <<1546|9:0>> had borne him three surviving daughters, the ladies Jane, Katherine and Mary. For some reason, Henry decided to overlook his living niece, Frances, skipping her generation in favour of her offspring. The reason is unclear. Professor Eric Ives suggested that the issue was either something personal to do with Frances, or it may have been a comment on her husband, as it was assumed at this stage that if a woman became queen, her husband would assume the title of king.4 This latter seems most plausible as this high-ranking peer is conspicuous by his absence from either the list of sixteen regency councillors or the twelve assistants named in Henry\x{2019}s will.
