He declined going into academia and opted instead for a field career with Survey. A fair number of postdocs take that route. It means they\x{2019}re less interested in making a reputation for themselves, or in doing serious work in their fields, than they are in simply getting up close to stars and visiting worlds that nobody has ever seen before. You don\x{2019}t usually think of scientific types as being romantics, but these guys seem to qualify. I spent two years piloting Survey ships, and I met a few of them. They are unbridled enthusiasts. Normally a mission is assigned a section of maybe <<eight to ten|10a:0>> stars. You go into each system, do a profile of the central sun, get more information about it than anybody\x{2019}s ever going to care to read, then run a survey of the planets if there are any. And you look especially close at worlds in the biozone.",
