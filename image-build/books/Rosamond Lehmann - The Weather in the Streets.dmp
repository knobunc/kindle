            "What was James? He was a problem. The only male Curtis of this generation was rebellious, not inclined to conform, to settle. After the most brilliant conceit-inducing start at school, he had progressively disappointed; had failed to win the university scholarship which would have enabled him to defer the question of career for a time. Dispatched after this grave set-back to a mill-owning acquaintance of Mr. Curtis in Bristol to learn the business he had left without farewells at the end of six weeks; arriving at the front door at  <<1 a.m.|5>> after three days on the road, blistered, feverish, sullen. Naturally that was the end of the Bristol experiment. Naturally his wounded employer washed his hands. As for James, he explained nothing; and, though briefly bitter, not to say insolent, about mills, voiced no preferences. At home he was disagreeable and spotty, refused all invitations to tennis parties and dances, avoided everybody\x{2019}s eye, burst forth for day-long solitary walks. In the evenings he sat in his bedroom, playing Delius on his portable Decca and reading poetry: perhaps writing it\x{2014}nobody knew for certain: but he was known to possess a thick furtive black copy-book. It was only a phase, of course: boys did go like that. But it had seemed best, while waiting for him to come on again, to send him to a French family for a while. French was always useful; and then there was a dark implication of the advantage of removing him from the neighbourhood of Uncle Oswald, for whose society he now showed an odd mingled distaste and fascination. And then the discreet mixture of foreign emancipation and home influence provided by Monsieur et Madame Latour of Fontainebleau might be just what was needed to soothe and settle him. Certainly madame\x{2019}s elaborately eulogistic, maternally sympathetic, exquisitely penned letters about him appeared to justify such a hope. As for James\x{2019}s own letters, though scanty and reticent, they arrived regularly, contained no disquieting P.SS. and altogether appeared the products of a normal English youth accepting life as it was ordered for him.",

Stockings for the children, jumpers for the children, babies\x{2019} night-vests, coats, bootees\x{2014}there was never an end. Kate had taken on and elaborated the theme unfolded in her own infancy by Mrs. Curtis. The little tables either side of the fireplace were choked now with photographs of the grandchildren at all stages: straight-fringed, neat-featured, hygienic-looking. A number of the more rococo pre-war likenesses of Mrs. Curtis\x{2019}s own young\x{2014}plumes, curls, ribbons, frothing frills\x{2014}had been put away to make room for them. From time to time Kate laid down her needles and studied them closely, with a searching frown. From time to time Mrs. Curtis\x{2019}s hands dropped and she heaved a sigh: her vast unconscious sigh. But nowadays this no longer cast a blight upon her daughters. Olivia smoked, looked at the Illustrated London News.

            "It\x{2019}s funny, after that week-end there seems a gap for a long time. We didn\x{2019}t see each other much, I\x{2019}m sure of that. The problem of where to go got more and more acute. The snatched snips and fragments had become hateful to me\x{2014}though he didn\x{2019}t feel it in the same way, and once or twice went away sulking when I said no, impossible. It was getting on for spring, he gave me freesias, mimosa, tulips. It must have been in early March that Jocelyn sent me his keys as he\x{2019}d promised, with a note saying he was just off to Austria, and wouldn\x{2019}t I try to come out for a bit later. I rang him up and said would he mind if I lived there say for a month, and tried to do some writing after studio hours. He was delighted\x{2014}telling me where he kept his sheets and towels, and about the geyser; and did I want his charwoman to do breakfast for me? I said no, I\x{2019}d look after myself, but she was to come in for an hour every morning while I was out. It\x{2019}s a lot of washing up that gets me down. I explained to Etty, saying I just needed a workroom of my own for a few weeks, I knew a publisher who was interested, she was thrilled of course; she\x{2019}s marvellously uninquisitive and unobservant, I must say. Mother was suspicious at first, but pleased on second thoughts. She always thinks it\x{2019}s such a pity I dropped Writing after being in print so much at Oxford. She thought at last I might be going to settle down and Do Something. Poor Mum; she doesn\x{2019}t trust Etty, or Anna\x{2014}or me either for that matter. So my tangled web was nicely woven. I didn\x{2019}t say a word to Rollo. We lunched together the day I moved in. I said I\x{2019}d something to show him, and directed him where to go in the car after lunch, opened the door with my own latch-key, walked him upstairs, very mystified, and ushered him in. A grand surprise. The sun was streaming in at the window, and he was so beautifully pleased and excited. I thought I\x{2019}d be very happy there. I like that part of London too, off the Fulham road. After he\x{2019}d gone, masses of flowers arrived, and in the evening a great hamper from Fortnum\x{2019}s, full of those delicacies\x{2014}fruits in brandy, foie gras, pickled figs and things\x{2014}that are a bit of a worry really; one never can decide at what meal to eat them, and it seems such a shame to open the jars. A bottle of Calvados too. The sad thing was he couldn\x{2019}t have dinner with me, he\x{2019}d got to dine out, he\x{2019}d come round afterwards, if he possibly could \x{2026} Sometimes I remember what he said that time I got a glimpse of his engagement book: \x{201c}They can all be scrapped.\x{201d} It wasn\x{2019}t often they were \x{2026} He can\x{2019}t help it \x{2026} I couldn\x{2019}t be bothered to cook dinner for myself. I had a banana and a cup of coffee and went out and saw a bad film at the Forum. I came back and sat by the gas fire and waited. <<About midnight|13>> the bell rang, he was there. He stayed with me an hour or two, it was heavenly to feel secure against disturbance. He left and I heard his step go down the uncarpeted stair \x{2026} I felt lonely then and oppressed. The room seemed quite the wrong shape\x{2014}too high\x{2014}square\x{2014}what? \x{2026} I don\x{2019}t like bed-sitting rooms, specially at night. I can\x{2019}t sleep properly. The building seemed utterly empty except for me. A German couple lived on the ground floor, but in between me and them on the first floor, were empty rooms. A painter had one, but he lived in the country and only came up and used it if he had a portrait commission. He didn\x{2019}t have one while I was there \x{2026} And Jocelyn\x{2019}s windows, large, bald, vacant with his long dismal unlined butcher-blue curtains, trailing down like a giant\x{2019}s boiler-suit \x{2026} He hasn\x{2019}t any taste in decoration; not that he\x{2019}s indifferent, he likes his room; he just hasn\x{2019}t any eye. Writing young men often haven\x{2019}t. Not like painters: whatever the mess and squalor their rooms are generally alive. But serious young authors like Jocelyn are apt to live in impersonal apartments with a good deal of brown and blue casement cloth, and oak sideboards, and wicker chairs their mothers have let them have from home. Not uncomfortable, or downright ugly; undeveloped more, student-like. Not puritanical exactly, but, anyway, a hint of a moral attitude \x{2026} Jocelyn being against possessions at the moment, he\x{2019}d given away a good many of his books, and the only things in the way of pictures were two photographs, one of Gaudier-Brzeska, one of D. H. Lawrence, cut out of books and framed in black passe-partout; and one lithograph, quite good\x{2014}a nude. The walls were distempered in fawn, the bed had a Paisley shawl over it by day \x{2026} Even trimmed up with Rollo\x{2019}s flowers, that room never cracked a whole-hearted smile.",

I shall never like cooking, I\x{2019}m not talented enough, but it was nice cooking for him, he appreciated it so. I bought a stylish little new cookery book and dished up all sorts of mixtures. Sometimes when he couldn\x{2019}t have dinner with me, he\x{2019}d ring the bell late, <<about one o\x{2019}clock|6>>. I never stayed out anywhere <<after midnight|13>> in case he did. It was rather wearing, the waiting; often after one had struck, I\x{2019}d listen for the half-hour, then two, then the half-hour again; still keyed up for the door-bell, the telephone, hearing in my brain his car come down the street and stop, sitting frozen in my chair\x{2014}a listening machine \x{2026} I asked him how he explained when he came late. \x{201c}I go to look up old George,\x{201d} he said.

He started off for London <<about midnight|13>> with Adrian and Carl; they had to get back, Kurt was travelling back to Germany next day. They were getting subdued and sleepy, but Colin, who was with us for the week-end, was still going strong.

Tidy the bedroom more or less, dust a bit in the sitting-room, let in what air there was: for Mrs. Banks was on holiday, there was no one to keep one up to the mark, no sharp eye and sharper tongue to brace one or contend against. Prepare to go out for lunch. Rouge, lipstick, powder \x{2026} do what one might, it wasn\x{2019}t one\x{2019}s own face, it wasn\x{2019}t a face at all, it was a shoddy construction, a bad disguise. Walk down two side streets to the Bird Cage: morning coffee, light lunches, dainty teas, controlled by gentlewomen; blue tables, orange chairs.",

At <<twenty-five|9:0>> he had something of the look Simon had had as a young man: the merest superficial resemblance though: the quality wasn\x{2019}t there. There was nobody left in the world like Simon, who had died in September. Naturally one would go on giving parties, going to the ballet, the opera, going abroad, filling the house, filling the days. Life was perfectly full, one saw to that; one could manage without Simon who had never been a practical part of any of it. There was scarcely anything tangible\x{2014}scarcely a letter or a snapshot\x{2014}to remember: anything, that is, of a private nature. His pictures hung on the walls. She had started buying them on Desmond Fellowes\x{2019} advice when Simon was unknown and twenty-one. She now owned the best of them. These would shortly be lent to a memorial exhibition. He wasn\x{2019}t a great painter, but he might have been. It was in his nature, she thought, to be great; never to narrow or to crystallise in mediocrity. It was the richness and variety of his temperament which had hindered a straightforward development; so that at thirty-eight he was still half-promise, half-fulfilment. He hadn\x{2019}t entirely found himself.
