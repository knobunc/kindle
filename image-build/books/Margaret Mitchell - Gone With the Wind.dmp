The big brute\x{2014}he\x{2019}s a grand horse, Scarlett; you must tell your pa to come over and see him right away\x{2014}he\x{2019}d already bitten a hunk out of his groom on the way down here and he\x{2019}d trampled two of Ma\x{2019}s darkies who met the train at Jonesboro. And just before we got home, he\x{2019}d about kicked the stable down and half-killed Strawberry, Ma\x{2019}s old stallion. When we got home, Ma was out in the stable with a sackful of sugar smoothing him down and doing it mighty well, too. The darkies were hanging from the rafters, popeyed, they were so scared, but Ma was talking to the horse like he was folks and he was eating out of her hand. There ain\x{2019}t nobody like Ma with a horse. And when she saw us she said: \x{2018}In Heaven\x{2019}s name, what are you four doing home again? You\x{2019}re worse than the plagues of Egypt!\x{2019} And then the horse began snorting and rearing and she said: \x{2018}Get out of here! Can\x{2019}t you see he\x{2019}s nervous, the big darling?

            "She hated Tony for bringing such trouble upon them. How could he have done such a thing to friends? And how could Ashley have sent Tony to them? Never again would she give aid to anyone if it meant having the Yankees come down on her like a swarm of hornets. No, she would bar the door against anyone needing her help. Except, of course, Ashley. For weeks after Tony\x{2019}s brief visit she woke from uneasy dreams at any sound in the road outside, fearing it might be Ashley trying to make his escape, fleeing to Texas because of the aid he had given Tony. She did not know how matters stood with him, for they did not dare write to Tara about Tony\x{2019}s <<midnight|13>> visit. Their letters might be intercepted by the Yankees and bring trouble upon the plantation as well. But, when weeks went by and they heard no bad news, they knew that Ashley had somehow come clear. And finally, the Yankees ceased annoying them.",

            "Scarlett had found that a drink of neat brandy before supper helped immeasurably and she could always chew coffee or gargle cologne to disguise the smell. Why were people so silly about women drinking, when men could and did get reeling drunk whenever they wanted to? Sometimes when Frank lay snoring beside her and sleep would not come, when she lay tossing, torn with fears of poverty, dreading the Yankees, homesick for Tara and yearning for Ashley, she thought she would go crazy were it not for the brandy bottle. And when the pleasant, familiar warmth stole through her veins, her troubles began to fade. <<After three|9:0>> drinks, she could always say to herself: \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll think of these things tomorrow when I can stand them better.\x{201d}",
