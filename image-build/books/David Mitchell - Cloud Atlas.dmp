Sir E. glanced at us now and then to make sure he was not wearing out his host. \x{201c}Not at all.\x{201d} We smiled back. They fenced over such topics as saxophones in orchestras, whether Webern is Fraudster or Messiah, the patronage and politics of music.

The King might want my baronetcy back.\x{201d} Ayrs went into laughter spasms at this! \x{201c}I always say, Ted, to get the crowd to cry Hosanna, you must first ride into town on an ass.

Napier, more a watcher than a speaker, chisels out his sentences with care. \x{201c}In 1945, I\x{2019}d been a cop for six years at Spinoza District Station. No commendations, no black marks. A regular cop, keeping his nose clean, dating a regular girl in a typing pool. On the fourteenth of August, the radio said the Japs had surrendered and Buenas Yerbas danced one almighty hula.

We were en route when a Code Eight comes through from your father, calling all available cars to Silvaplana Wharf.

But two officers were down, and that ain\x{2019}t the same ball game. It could be your buddy bleeding to death on the tarmac. So we flat-outed and reached the wharf just behind another Spinoza car, Brozman and Harkins. Saw nothing at first. No sign of Lester Rey, no sign of a squad car. The dockside lights were off. We drove between two walls of cargo containers, around the corner into a yard where men were loading up an army truck. I was thinking we were in the wrong zone of the docks. Then the wall of bullets hit us. Brozman and Harkins took the first wave\x{2014}brakes, glass filling the air, our car skidded into theirs, me and my partner rolled out of our car and holed up behind a stack of steel tubes. Brozman\x{2019}s car horn sounds, doesn\x{2019}t stop, and they don\x{2019}t appear. More bullets ack-ack-acking around us, I\x{2019}m shitting myself\x{2014}I\x{2019}d become a cop to avoid war zones. My partner starts firing back. I follow his lead, but our chances of hitting anything are zilch. To be honest with you, I was glad when the truck trundled by. Dumb ass that I was, I broke cover too soon\x{2014}to see if I could get a license plate.\x{201d} The root of Napier\x{2019}s tongue is aching. \x{201c}Then all this happens. A yelling man charges me from across the yard. I fire at him. I miss\x{2014}the luckiest miss of my life, and yours too, Luisa, because if I\x{2019}d shot your father you wouldn\x{2019}t be here. Lester Rey is pointing behind me as he sprints by, and he kicks an object rolling my way, lobbed from the back of the truck. Then a blinding light fries me, a noise axes my head, and a needle of pain shoots through my butt. I lay where I fell, half conscious, until I was hoisted into an ambulance.\x{201d}",

He checks his mirror: a silver Chrysler has been sitting a hundred yards behind him for a mile or two, but now it overtakes and vanishes into the distance. Relax, Napier tells himself, you\x{2019}ve gotten away. Something in his Jeep is rattling. The afternoon reaches its <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>> golden age. The freeway runs alongside the river for mile after mile, slowly climbing. Upcountry\x{2019}s gotten uglier in the last thirty years, but show me a place that hasn\x{2019}t.

Napier revisits the first evening he saw her: she was playing fiddle for Wild Oakum Hokum and His Cowgirls in the Sand. The glances musicians exchange, when music is effortless, that was what he wanted from Milly, that intimacy. Luisa Rey is too a kid. Napier turns off at exit eighteen and takes the old gold miners\x{2019} road up toward Copperline. That rattling isn\x{2019}t getting any better. Fall is licking the mountain woods up here.
