Small, soft-bodied, and sharp-featured (some might say rodent-faced), he had little ability and no great desire to project a command presence. He was fretful, easily intimidated, and prone to nervous stomach upsets. It had never been his aim to be a police chief. It had never been his desire to be a police chief. His desire was to one day be mayor of Teotitl\x{e1}n. But traditions were traditions, and <<before one|9w>> could be considered for that esteemed post, one had to prove one\x{2019}s civic merits in a long-established progression of service positions. For two years he had served as chairman of the school board, for a year before that, as the administrator of the municipal marketplace. In six more months, God willing, he would have finished this grueling, nerve-racking tenure as chief of police with mind and body whole, and would move on to become the executive officer of the village council. And one year after that\x{2014}again, God willing\x{2014}he would be elected as alcalde, from which the step to mayor was virtually assured.",

            "AT <<a few minutes after one|10>>, Gideon stood in front of the small, gated courtyard of the Museo de Curiosidades. The gate was closed and latched, but the padlock had been removed. He lifted the latch and entered the courtyard. Once it had probably been a graceful patio, rich with plants and perhaps a welcoming fountain. Now it looked like the entrance to a junk shop, all weeds, cracked cement paving . . . and junk. On second glance, however, the junk proved to be exhibits, each with a small, faded, foxed, meticulously hand-lettered placard in English and Spanish. To the left of the big oak door of the casa itself was a weathered concrete bust of Kaiser Wilhelm I, complete with spiked helmet: \x{201c}From the residence of Friedrich Pflegholz, German ambassador to Mexico, 1883-1886.\x{201d} To the right was the \x{201c}sacred throne of Axay\x{e1}catl, emperor of the Aztecs,\x{201d} an ugly hunk of basalt that an imaginative mind might have construed as being shaped more or less like a chair. Further along, attached to the casa\x{2019}s wall by a chain, was a wooden \x{201c}Chinese empress\x{2019}s bench.\x{201d}",
