            "To add another instrument to our scientific tool kit, let\x{2019}s consider yet another feature of light. Not only is it swift and bright, it also has colors. These varied hues relate to a property called frequency, or the number of cycles per second. Electromagnetic waves, as they travel through space, oscillate at different rates. The frequency of these waves can vary significantly\x{2014}a palette of possibilities called the electromagnetic spectrum. The most familiar form of electromagnetic radiation, visible light, has a variety of frequencies ranging from <<approximately 400|18:0>> trillion to 750 trillion Hertz (cycles per second). Our eyes perceive these frequencies as a rainbow of colors ranging from red on the low-frequency end to violet on the high-frequency end.",

Its dreamy images of wispy, colorful nebulae and other astronomical marvels adorn countless book covers, calendars, screen savers, dormitory walls, and anywhere needed to be enlivened with spectacular vistas of space. Yet its vital scientific mission greatly transcends its public role in producing stunning photos and serving as a symbol for NASA. It has offered the best evidence of the content, structure, and dynamics of the universe\x{2014}in other words, what is out there, what might be missing, how everything is arranged, and where things are going. Each week, the telescope relays <<approximately 120|18:0>> gigabytes of data down to Earth, the equivalent of many thousands of books. Analysis of the gathered information forms a critical component of modern astronomy and has revolutionized the field.",

            "At first glance, the fact that the vacuum energy naturally introduces a cosmological constant sounds incredibly lucky. It would seem that the vacuum energy, acting with its negative pressure, would supply just the outward push needed to accelerate the universe. The problem is, however, that the theoretical vacuum energy density (amount per volume) is too potent\x{2014}by a factor of 10120 (1 followed by <<120|3:0>> zeros) compared to the measured value! Theory offers a cosmological constant immensely larger than the amount needed to explain cosmic acceleration. Therefore, one is left with the tricky dilemma of explaining why the cosmological constant is so small compared to theoretical predictions\x{2014}but still not zero.",

String theory is blessed\x{2014}or cursed, depending on one\x{2019}s viewpoint\x{2014}with myriad possibilities for its vacuum configuration. Estimates are that there are at least10500 (1 followed by <<500|3:0>> zeros) types of vacuum states, each with its own twisted kind of higher-dimensional geometry, known as a Calabi-Yau manifold. Clearly, if string theory is true, the real physical universe is based on only one of these forms. But what kind of mechanism picks the winner? Is it just a random lottery, or are there selection rules?",

The three familiar dimensions are all at right angles to one another\x{2014}as in the walls and floor at the corner of a room. How can we envision additional directions perpendicular to that trio? While mathematics keeps going, could nature stop at only <<three|9c:1>>? Or are we simply limited in our perceptions? Art historian Linda Dalrymple Henderson has documented the extraordinary attempts by artists and other inspired individuals\x{2014}Marcel Duchamp and Salvador Dal\x{ed}, for example\x{2014}to paint imaginative visions of the imperceptible.2 Dal\x{ed}\x{2019}s rendition of the fourth dimension in the painting Cruxification (Corpus Hypercubus) offers a visually stunning example.",

            "However, let\x{2019}s say you are standing near another school every day of the week during dismissal time. On a Tuesday you see a girl wearing red shoes, on a Wednesday you see a boy with a blue shirt, and on a Thursday you see a boy chasing another boy who has a green corduroy jacket. You try to take into account each of these parameters and concoct an elaborate theory relating days, colors, clothes, and behavior. You develop a hypothesis that if a girl with red shoes and a boy with a shirt other than red leave the school at <<3:00 P.M.|2a>> on consecutive days, there must be at least someone wearing corduroy, of yet another color, running out the door at <<3:05 P.M.|2a>> on the third day. That unjustifiably close level of matching is called overfitting the data. Based on your prior experiences, you would have little basis for adding so many specific factors to your prediction. Therefore the Bayesian approach would advise that the amount of detail you put into the model would make it less likely to be accurate.",
