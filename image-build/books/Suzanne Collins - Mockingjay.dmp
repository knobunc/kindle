But it\x{2019}s an odd place for a tryst, a hanging tree, where a man was hung for murder. The murderer\x{2019}s lover must have had something to do with the killing, or maybe they were just going to punish her anyway, because his corpse called out for her to flee.

You realize the singer of the song is the dead murderer. He\x{2019}s still in the hanging tree. And even though he told his lover to flee, he keeps asking if she\x{2019}s coming to meet him. The phrase Where I told you to run, so we\x{2019}d both be free is the most troubling because at first you think he\x{2019}s talking about when he told her to flee, presumably to safety. But then you wonder if he meant for her to run to him. To death. In the final stanza, it\x{2019}s clear that that\x{2019}s what he\x{2019}s waiting for.
