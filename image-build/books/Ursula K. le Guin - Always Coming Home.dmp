            "At the period this book is concerned with, two engines were in use in the Valley, one owned by the Kesh and the other by the Amaranth people. Both ran only between Kast\x{f3}ha and Sed. They were woodburning steam engines of (my guess) <<about 15 to 20|10>> horsepower. The Kesh engine was built, maintained, and operated by members of the Millers Art in cooperation with other Arts and Lodges that used the train in their commerce with neighboring peoples. They called the engine The Grasshopper for its high-angled pistons, its jointed look, and probably for its habit of starting with a flying leap. It was built of pegged and fitted wood and riveted sheet iron; tubes were rolled up from the flat and seam-welded by hammering over a false core. The firebox and boiler sat up on little bolted legs well away from the carriage, and the high, narrow smokestack was topped with a complicated and unreliable spark baffle. The risk of forest fire in the dry grass and chaparral of the mountains was the main drawback to use of the engines; in dry years they were not run at all between the Water Dance and the beginning of the rains. At such times, and for short runs within the Valley, for single-wain hauls, and for all traffic north from Kast\x{f3}ha over the Mountain, the trains were pulled by oxen or mules: the tracks and roadbed served to make the hauling easier for those who did it.",

            "On those Following Nights the music doesn\x{2019}t come down from the heyimas till late twilight, and usually the musicians go off to bed sometime not too late. Men decide all those things. Men of the Obsidian are in charge of the wakwa; they see that it\x{2019}s performed appropriately and without trouble. People getting drunk are usually the only trouble. It seems like there\x{2019}s always some old hunter who can\x{2019}t keep his penis up, so he drinks wine for lust, but then he can\x{2019}t get it up at all, so he drinks more and gets crazy, and the men in charge of the wakwa have to dip him in the reservoir or shut him into an empty barn till he quiets down. There used to be a woman here in Sinshan, Marigold of the Serpentine, who always drank at the Moon, and didn\x{2019}t stay put like you\x{2019}re supposed to; if there wasn\x{2019}t a man with her, she\x{2019}d go get one. I suppose every boy in Sinshan who was too shy to go to the woman he really wanted, got sucked into that old whirlpool at <<one|3e:0>> Moon or another. But it wasn\x{2019}t any harm to him, and Marigold certainly had a good time! At the Wine, she used to go around saying, \x{201c}I drink all through the Moon, why can\x{2019}t I fuck all through the Wine?\x{201d} And I expect she pretty well did, too. She was old when she stopped dancing the Moon\x{2014}seventy or more. And she died soon after.",

Some Blue Clay people came right out and kept him from going down into the heyimas. At first he acted crazily, but they quietened him, and Ninepoint explained to him that a man may come and go as he likes, and a woman may take him back or not as she likes, but the house is hers, and if she shuts the door he may not open it. People had come to listen because of the noise he had made shouting at first, and some of them I thought it was funny to explain such things to a grown man. Strength, a speaker of the Blood Lodge, scoffed at him. When he said, \x{201c}But she belongs to me\x{2014}the child belongs to me,\x{201d} she began to do the Blood Clown turkey-gobble around him, shouting, \x{201c}The hammer menstruates to me!

            "One made everything out of nothing. One is a person, immortal. He is all-powerful. Human men are imitations of him. One is not the universe; he made it, and gives it orders. Things are not part of him nor is he part of them, so you must not praise things, but only One. The One, however, reflects himself in the Condor; so the Condor is to be praised and obeyed. And the True Condors and One-Warriors, who are all called Sons of the Condor or Sons of the Son, are reflections of the reflection of One, and therefore also to be praised and obeyed. The tyon are very dim and faint reflections far removed from <<One|9c:0>>, but even so they have enough of his power to be called human beings. No other people are human. The hontik, that is women and foreigners and animals, have nothing to do with One at all; they are purutik, unclean, dirt people. They were made by One to obey and serve the Sons. This is what they say; it seemed to me to get a little complicated, since Condor\x{2019}s Daughters gave orders to tyon, and talked about them as if they were dirt people; but that discrepancy is kept out of mind, since the Daughters all live in the City and seldom even see the farmers. It must have all been very different when the Dayao were nomads, but it may have started then, too, as a matter of sexual jealousy, the chief men trying to keep their wives and daughters \x{201c}clean,\x{201d} and the women holding themselves apart from the strangers they met along their way, and finally all of them coming to think that to be a person at all is to be separate from and apart from everyone and everything.",

We three went west across the marshes, then south along the foothills to the place called Utud where the Chiryan Road begins, and came through the hills on that road. That is wild country. Not a human person was on that road but ourselves. Coyotes sang all night, the crazy-old-woman songs and the high-moon songs, up on the high hillsides; the grass was full of mice; deer sprang aside, or watched us from the thickets, all day long; mourning doves called continually, and the air at evening would darken with the vast flocks of pigeons and other birds; always at <<noon|13>> we looked up to see the redwing hawk circling.
