            "A man might say it is strange that the best detective books of this century should have been written by women. In these \x{2018}women\x{2019}s lib\x{2019} days when there is supposed to be no difference between the sexes no woman dare say it. And, in fact, there is nothing strange about it at all. Given education, and inborn ability, the mind of a woman \x{2013} and here I risk being tarred and feathered as a traitor to my sex \x{2013} is more convoluted than a man\x{2019}s, less side-tracked and better able to accept the impossible. I should qualify this by saying that women were only able to use their minds fully when they became generally accepted, early in this century, as worthy of education and as writers doing \x{2018}their own thing\x{2019}. Less than a hundred years before the birth of Dorothy L. Sayers the Bront\x{eb}s and Mary Ann Evans had to publish their works under male sounding names (Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell, and George Eliot), in order to gain acceptance as serious writers. It was all right for women to write homely religious tales, belles-lettres and pretty poetry, but to acknowledge the authorship of anything which smacked of real life, of deep passions or sex, was considered extremely bad form. Society was horrified when it discovered that the author of Frankenstein was a woman, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, wife of the poet. Society had to be considered since it was the only section of the community which could read and therefore buy books. After the universal Education Act of 1870 however, reading was within reach of all, and by <<1900|9:0>> most of the population was literate. And they were not asking for pious homilies, but for books which held their interest: adventure, romance, and for the kind of book pioneered by Wilkie Collins and Conan Doyle \x{2013} detection. So one may say that the world was waiting for Dorothy L. Sayers, Agatha Christie and Ngaio Marsh.",

            "Dorothy Leigh Sayers was born in 1893. Her father was a clergyman and a classical scholar. From him she inherited her love of literature, the classics, and her knowledge of high Anglican procedure. One of her father\x{2019}s parishes had been at Wisbech and it was there she came to love the fens, with their loneliness, beauty and latent terror, which made such a marvellous setting for The Nine Tailors. She was a Gilchrist scholar of Somerville College, Oxford, that nursery of learned ladies, from 1912 to 1915, where she gained Honours in Modern Languages. At that time, although women were able to study for the courses and pass them with honours, the University of Oxford refused to confer degrees on the so-called \x{2018}weaker sex\x{2019}, so she had to wait until <<1920|9c:0>> before receiving her M.A. She was not rich, and going to Oxford even with scholarships had cost money, so it was imperative that she should earn her own living. Like so many educated women of her time, she found very little open to her. Science or medicine would have taken further years of study and, anyway, her gifts did not seem to lie in these directions. The law always fascinated her, but here again, the cost and lack of influence blocked any road to the King\x{2019}s Bench. The obvious career was school teaching which she tried for a year at Hull Grammar School but she found teaching not only soulless but extremely ill-paid. Like so many women of high intelligence she never found it easy to cope with the less mentally well-endowed, into which category all children fall. She has been called a snob, and it is evident that intellectually she was, although it is possible she was quite unaware of it. She returned to Oxford for a time and tried publishing but, as her employer said \x{2018}she was merry, talkative and argumentative, clearly not designed by nature for the routine work of a publisher\x{2019}s office\x{2019}. This same publisher brought out her first two works, slim volumes of verse entitled OP I and Catholic Tales. There are glimpses of her at Oxford at this time. She always had strange fancies as to dress \x{2013} as do the female characters in her books \x{2013} and a fellow writer, Doreen Wallace, remembers drawing for her a large Tudor rose in red material for Miss Sayers to applique to her home-made black dress. Miss Wallace also recollects an embarrassing walk with her down the High, which Miss Sayers took in great loping strides rendering, meanwhile, Bach in loud and not particularly melodious voice to the astonishment of the townsmen.",

Although Lord Peter first sprang to prominence in 1923, this disreputable old uncle does not actually appear until <<1938|9c:0>>, most of his life, if we are to believe him, having been taken up with things French. Mr. Delagardie\x{2019}s contribution to the Wimsey saga is really nothing more than a smoke screen. As Miss Sayers once said the recipe for detective fiction is the art of framing lies. To lead the reader up the garden path and make him believe lies. \x{2018}To believe the real murderer to be innocent, to believe some harmless person to be guilty. To believe the false alibi sound, the present absent, the dead alive, the living dead.\x{2019}*",

            "The Nine Tailors (1934) is generally regarded as the best of all Wimsey stories. The setting is the wild Fens of snow and flood, and the plot is woven round the art of campanology (a word which this book brought into general use) which is the complex science of bell ringing and is peculiarly English. In her forward to the book Miss Sayers asks \x{2018}the indulgence of all change ringers for any errors I may have made in dealing with their ancient craft\x{2019}. Although a pedantic clergyman claims to have found Miss Sayers in error 36 times, whatever these may be they do not detract from the story and one does at least learn a great deal about an art which might have passed one by. I know of at least two young people who were inspired to take up bell ringing solely through reading <<Nine|11>> Tailors.",

The other was a stranger \x{2013} probably the man whom Creech half-expected to call upon him. One lay in wait for Creech and strangled him near the wicket gate as he arrived; fetched your goloshes from the verandah and carried the body down to the Folly. And the other came here in disguise to hold you in play and give you an alibi that no one could believe. The one man is strong in his hands and strong in the back \x{2013} a sturdy, stocky man with feet no bigger than yours.
