He loved the sport, the gallop, the danger, the players\x{2019} athletic skills, the aggressive thrust of the riding-off maneuver, the heavy breathing, the smell of dust and torn grass, even the sight of the spectators, heads bent like those of treasure seekers after coins, replacing divots of turf between chukkas. Polo in Wyoming was not exclusively the sport of the wealthy but also the pleasure of ranch hands and working people. Individual riding skill counted for more than money, but as Sage sometimes remarked, it didn\x{2019}t hurt if you had both. He was handicapped at <<6|9c:0>> and Georgina, who was a ferociously expert horsewoman, at <<7|9:0>>.",
