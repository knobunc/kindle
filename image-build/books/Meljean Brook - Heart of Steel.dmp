All along the Scandinavian coast, rum dives served as a town\x{2019}s only line of defense against mercenaries and pirates\x{2014}and as soon as the sky paled and Lady Corsair became visible on the eastern horizon, lights began appearing in the windows of the public houses alongside the docks. The taverns were opening early, hoping to make a few extra deniers <<before midday|13>> . . . and the good citizens of Fladstrand were probably praying that her crew wouldn\x{2019}t venture beyond the docks and into the town itself.",

She emerged from the dim tavern into the dark and paused to light a cigarillo, studying the boardwalk along the docks. It was just as busy at night as during the day, but the crowd was comprised of more drunks. Some slumped against the buildings or slept beside crates. Groups of sailors laughed and pounded their chests at the aviators\x{2014}some of them women, Yasmeen noted, and not one of them alone.
