            "MARY SHELLEY was born in London in 1797, daughter of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, famous radical writers of the day. Mary\x{2019}s mother died tragically eleven days after the birth. Under Godwin\x{2019}s conscientious and expert tuition, Mary\x{2019}s was an intellectually stimulating childhood though she was emotionally undernourished. In 1814 she met and soon fell in love with the then unknown Percy Bysshe Shelley, and in July they eloped to the Continent. In December 1816, after Shelley\x{2019}s first wife, Harriet, committed suicide, Mary and Percy married. Of the four children she bore Shelley, only Percy Florence survived. They lived in Italy from 1818 until <<1823|9c:0>>, when Percy Shelly drowned, following the capsize of his boat Ariel in a storm. Mary returned with Percy Florence to London, where she continued to live as a professional writer until her death in 1851.",

            "But it proved a wet, ungenial summer, and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories, translated from the German into French, fell into our hands. There was the History of the Inconstant Lover, who, when he thought to clasp the bride to whom he had pledged his vows, found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her whom he had deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his race whose miserable doom it was to bestow the kiss of death on all the younger sons of his fated house, just when they reached the age of promise. His gigantic, shadowy form, clothed like the ghost in Hamlet, in complete armour, but with the beaver up, was seen at <<midnight|13>>, by the moon\x{2019}s fitful beams, to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The shape was lost beneath the shadow of the castle walls; but soon a gate swung back, a step was heard, the door of the chamber opened, and he advanced to the couch of the blooming youths, cradled in healthy sleep. Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as he bent down and kissed the forehead of the boys, who from that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the stalk. I have not seen these stories since then; but their incidents are as fresh in my mind as if I had read them yesterday.",

Sometimes, on the very brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise. One secret which I alone possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon gazed on my <<midnight|13>> labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places. Who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay? My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but then a resistless, and almost frantic impulse, urged me forward; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. It was indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had returned to my old habits. I collected bones from charnel-houses and disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human frame. In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house, and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase, I kept my workshop of filthy creation: my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. The dissecting room and the slaughterhouse furnished many of my materials; and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation, whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I brought my work near to a conclusion.',

I remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would be pursuit?

I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the water.

The field of ice is almost a league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league; and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.

He turned on hearing a noise; and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever before seen, and his flight, somewhat surprised me.

This hovel, however, joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance; but, after my late dearly bought experience, I dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.

Shortly before the creation scene in his laboratory, Victor writes to Elizabeth that he has \x{201c}discovered the secret of life\x{201d} and will create \x{201c}the most perfect human being.\x{201d} The monster (Charles Ogle), who takes on flesh as he rises from a cauldron, appalls Victor, who then returns to Geneva and to Elizabeth, only to be followed by the monster. A series of scenes before and during the wedding night involve a mirror that reflects the comings and goings of Victor and the monster and Elizabeth, preparing us for a doppelg\x{e4}nger moment when Victor sees \x{201c}himself\x{201d} as the monster in the mirror\x{2014}just before the final and equivocally represented (death?) embrace between Victor and Elizabeth.",

            "<<1931|9l>>: Frankenstein (71 minutes, black and white), directed by James Whale, and produced for Universal Pictures by Carl Laemmle Jr. This not-to-be-missed and visually stunning classic film does not follow much of Mary Shelley\x{2019}s text (and changes some of the characters\x{2019} names, apparently following the names used in Peggy Webling\x{2019}s earlier theatrical adaptation), but its narrative and images have become seminal for subsequent Frankenstein films. In a prologue, Edward Van Sloan warns the audience about the horror in this film, which opens with the iconographic shot of a graveyard (with slanted crosses) and closes with an equally iconographic catastrophe in a windmill (its sails recalling the crosses), with the entire movie featuring deep shadows and the play of light against dark. In the first scene, Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) and his hunchbacked and slow-witted assistant, Fritz (Dwight Frye), rob a grave and a gallows for parts to complete the monster (Boris Karloff), which needs only a brain for its reanimation. Fritz retrieves a criminal\x{2019}s \x{201c}abnormal\x{201d} brain from the Goldstadt Medical College that, together with the now standardized electrical equipment for reanimation, brings the monster to life, as Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan) from the University of Goldstadt and Victor Moritz (John Boles, playing the equivalent of Clerval) and Frankenstein\x{2019}s fianc\x{e9}e, Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), look on during an electrical storm. After being created and restrained and terrified by a torch, the inarticulate monster escapes to kill Waldman and Maria (Marilyn Harris, who plays the little girl he throws into the lake) and is then hounded by the torch-carrying townspeople and burned to death (apparently) in the windmill. Henry Frankenstein and Elizabeth survive at the end of the film.",

As Mary Shelley, she appears in an introductory frame to narrate the film to Lord Byron (Gavin Gordon) and Percy Bysshe Shelley (Douglas Walton). We soon learn that the monster survives in the water beneath the windmill, and Henry Frankenstein barely survives to be nursed back to health by Elizabeth (now played by Valerie Hobson). Despite Mary Shelley being the frame narrator, this film drifts further from the original novel by introducing Dr. Pretorius (Ernest Thesiger) as the villain who uses the monster (who learns to speak in this version) to kidnap Elizabeth and thus blackmail Henry Frankenstein to help construct the Bride\x{2014}with the aid of his assistant Karl (once more played by Dwight Frye). After the very well-orchestrated creation scene, the Bride (who is identified by a lightning streak through her hair) rejects the monster, who then in anger destroys the laboratory/tower with himself, the Bride, and Pretorius inside. Henry Frankenstein and Elizabeth live on, but the audience is not returned to the original frame that introduced the tale.",

Heinrich Frankenstein has died, but his son, Baron Wolf von Frankenstein (Basil Rathbone), together with his wife, Elsa (Josephine Hutchinson), and their young son, Peter (Donnie Dunagan), travel from America to the village of Frankenstein to inhabit the family castle, in which lurk both Ygor (Bela Lugosi), with his neck broken from a hanging, and Ygor\x{2019}s patient, the barely alive monster (Boris Karloff), who until recently has still managed to kill villagers (who turn out to be those on the jury that condemned Ygor to death). Much of the film involves confrontations between Frankenstein (who after reading his father\x{2019}s diary decides to bring the monster back to health) and Inspector Krogh (Lionel Atwill), who is investigating the murders of the villagers. At the end, Ygor is shot to death by Frankenstein, the monster is pushed into a boiling sulfur pit, and the Frankenstein family survives but leaves and deeds the castle to the village. Also surviving is Krogh, who with his mechanical forearm (the monster had torn the limb from him) is the inspiration for the more broadly played Inspector Kemp (also with a mechanical forearm) in Mel Brooks\x{2019}s 1974 Young Frankenstein.",

At the end, a madcap pursuit in the island castle (the monster chases Abbott and Costello, and the Wolfman battles Dracula) leads to the monster\x{2019}s predictable immolation on the wharf and the Wolfman leaping from a parapet to follow the bat/Dracula and hurtling to the sea below.

As expected, the brain transfer is not successful, and Karl/the monster kills a young woman and reveals the identity of Dr. Stein as Dr. Frankenstein.

            "1993: Frankenstein, titled Frankenstein: The Real Story in the UK (116 minutes, color), directed and produced by David Wickes for Turner Network Television. This film, which is sometimes judged to offer the most faithful representation of the novel, does begin and end with the frame tale set in the Arctic, in which Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Patrick Bergin) pursues the monster (Randy Quaid, an unlikely choice for the part) and is taken aboard the ship of an unnamed captain (Roger Bizley), to whom he narrates his (and the monster\x{2019}s) story. Although most of the other main characters are present, Felix and Agatha and Safie are not included in the film. Other major departures from the novel include the death of a sixteen-year-old William (Timothy Stark) by a fall from horseback (occasioned by the monster\x{2019}s sudden appearance); the love between Clerval (Lambert Wilson) and Justine (Jacinta Mulcahy), who is Elizabeth\x{2019}s friend rather than servant; the suicide of Justine because no one believes her story of William\x{2019}s death; and Frankenstein\x{2019}s confession to Elizabeth (Fiona Gillies) and his father, Alphonse (Ronald Leigh Hunt), that he had created the monster who was responsible for the death of William. In the monster\x{2019}s story, there is the stock scene in which he is shot after saving the young girl Amy (Amanda Quaid) from drowning, but the equally stock character of the blind De Lacey (John Mills) lives alone in his cottage and is the one who socializes the monster and teaches him to speak. The most interesting adaptation in the film is the very explicit doppelg\x{e4}nger relationship between the morally inclined Frankenstein (in Ingolstadt, he ministers to the sick who are dying from cholera) and the well-meaning monster. Frankenstein attempts to clone and perfect himself by means of an electrical apparatus and a vat of amniotic fluid in his laboratory at the University of Ingolstadt, where he is a professor rather than a student, but the experiment fails. From that point on, Frankenstein physically and emotionally experiences in his own body the pains of the monster he created, and he frequently announces to various characters that he and the monster are \x{201c}<<one|9k:0>>\x{201d}\x{2014}they are \x{201c}two parts of a single man\x{201d} locked in hate and loathing. In another partial cloning, Elizabeth volunteers to be the prototype for the monster\x{2019}s bride, but her pain during the process causes Frankenstein to halt and abort the second creation. Elizabeth, of course, will be killed on her wedding night (together with Clerval and Alphonse) by the monster, who is then pursued to the Arctic wastes by Frankenstein. Their twinlike or symbiotic relationship is emphasized in the final scene as their interlocked bodies descend into the icy depths of the Arctic sea.",

This production, which is the closest yet to Mary Shelley\x{2019}s novel in terms of plot, character, and dialogue, respects the original frame tale and opens in the Arctic ice aboard the ship Prometheus, as Robert Walton (Donald Sutherland) witnesses Victor Frankenstein (Alec Newman) pursuing the creature (Luke Goss) on dogsleds. Frankenstein is brought aboard and narrates his life in Geneva with his father, Alphonse (Mark Jax); his mother, Caroline (Julie Delpy); his adopted sister, Elizabeth (Nicole Lewis); and his best friend, Henry Clerval (Richard Rowlands). He also describes his life in Ingolstadt with Professor Waldman (William Hurt) and the creature\x{2019}s life with a country family (the De Laceys in the novel) consisting of a blind father (Jean Rochefort), Felix (Oliver le Sueur), Agatha (Edita Borsova), and their daughter, Eva (Hannah Van der Westhuysen). Purists will be pleased that the creature reads Milton\x{2019}s Paradise Lost but will be distressed that Agatha and Felix are not brother and sister but are married, that their daughter replaces Felix\x{2019}s Safie, that Ernest is not represented in the Frankenstein family, that Clerval initially accompanies Frankenstein to Ingolstadt (to provide conflict in the film narrative), and that Frankenstein returns to Ingolstadt (rather than journeying through England to Scotland) to create a female for the creature. In the final scene, the creature carries the dead Frankenstein from the Prometheus off into the obscurity of the Arctic seascape. We are reminded by this final scene that the monster will certainly reappear in future films\x{2014}and that Mary Shelley could and probably should have written her own sequel to Frankenstein, for we never see the monster immolate himself as he promises to do in the novel\x{2019}s penultimate paragraph.",
