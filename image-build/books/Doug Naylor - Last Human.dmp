She\'s lost a lot of blood, almost two pints, and she has a severe rupture to her stomach wall caused by laser fire. If she remains in Deep Sleep she could live for two, perhaps three, months. If we move her and try to save her life the medi-scan gives her a <<seven to four|10a:0>> chance of survival. Under ordinary circumstances I would recommend we leave her in Deep Sleep until we are able to get her back to Red Dwarf. The medical facilities aboard Starbug are laughable.\'',
