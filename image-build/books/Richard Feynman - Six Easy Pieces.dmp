            'As it happens, many of the symmetries known to particle physicists were familiar already in classical physics. Chief among these are the symmetries that arise from the homogeneity of space and time. Take time: apart from cosmology, where the big bang marked the beginning of time, there is nothing in physics to distinguish one moment of time from the next. Physicists say that the world is "invariant under time translations," meaning that whether you take <<midnight|13>> or <<mid-day|13>> to be the zero of time in your measurements, it makes no difference to the description of physical phenomena. Physical processes do not depend on an absolute zero of time. It turns out that this symmetry under time translation directly implies one of the most basic, and also most useful, laws of physics: the law of conservation of energy. This law says that you can move energy around and change its form but you can\'t create or destroy it. Feynman makes this law crystal clear with his amusing story of Dennis the Menace who is always mischievously hiding his toy building blocks from his mother (Chapter Four).',

Naturally, his appearances had to be kept secret so there would be room left in the hall for the registered students. At <<one|9m>> such lecture the subject was curved-space time, and Feynman was characteristically brilliant. But the unforgettable moment came at the beginning of the lecture. The supernova of 1987 has just been discovered, and Feynman was very excited about it. He said, "Tycho Brahe had his supernova, and Kepler had his. Then there weren\'t any for 400 years. But now I have mine." The class fell silent, and Feynman continued on. "There are 10 11  stars in the galaxy. That used to be a  huge  number. But it\'s only a hundred billion. It\'s less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers."

Physics <<before 1920|18:0>>

The elements on the stage are  particles,  for example the atoms, which have some  properties. First, the property of inertia: if a particle is moving it keeps on going in the same direction unless  forces  act upon it. The second element, then, is  forces,  which were then thought to be of two varieties: First, an enormously complicated, detailed kind of interaction force which held the various atoms in different combinations in a complicated way, which determined whether salt would dissolve faster or slower when we raise the temperature. The other force that was known was a long-range interaction\x{2014}a smooth and quiet attraction\x{2014}which varied inversely as the square of the distance, and was called  gravitation.  This law was known and was very simple.  Why  things remain in motion when they are moving, or  why there is a law of gravitation was, of course, not known.",

So the  chemical  properties of a substance depend only on a number, the number of electrons.

At higher frequencies they behave much more like  particles!  It is  quantum mechanics,  discovered <<just after 1920|18:0>>, which explains this strange behavior. In the years before <<1920|9c:0>>, the picture of space as a three-dimensional space, and of time as a separate thing, was changed by Einstein, first into a combination which we call space-time, and then still further into a  curved  space-time to represent gravitation. So the \"stage\" is changed into space-time, and gravitation is presumably a modification of space-time. Then it was also found that the rules for the motions of particles were incorrect. The mechanical rules of \"inertia\" and \"forces\" are  wrong \x{2014}Newton's laws are wrong \x{2014}in the world of atoms. Instead, it was discovered that things on a small scale behave  nothing like  things on a large scale. That is what makes physics difficult\x{2014}and very interesting. It is hard because the way things behave on a small scale is so \"unnatural\"; we have no direct experience with it. Here things behave like nothing we know of, so that it is impossible to describe this behavior in any other than analytic ways. It is difficult, and takes a lot of imagination.",

At first, one is quite excited and happy when he \"discovers\" it, but he soon finds that it is not correct. It was first discovered <<about 1750|18:0>>. Suppose there were many particles moving in space at a very high speed in all directions and being only slightly absorbed in going through matter. When they  are absorbed, they give an impulse to the earth. However, since there are as many going one way as another, the impulses all balance. But when the sun is nearby, the particles coming toward the earth through the sun are partially absorbed, so fewer of them are coming from the sun than are coming from the other side. Therefore, the earth feels a net impulse toward the sun and it does not take one long to see that it is inversely as the square of the distance\x{2014}because of the variation of the solid angle that the sun subtends as we vary the distance. What is wrong with that machinery? It involves some new consequences which are  not true.  This particular idea has the",

Where could such a tremendous number come from? Some say that we shall one day find the "universal equation/\' and in it, one of the roots will be this number. It is very difficult to find an equation for which such a fantastic number is a natural root. Other possibilities have been thought of; one is to relate it to the age of the universe. Clearly, we have to find  another  large number somewhere. But do we mean the age of the universe in  years?  No, because years are not "natural"; they were devised by men.
