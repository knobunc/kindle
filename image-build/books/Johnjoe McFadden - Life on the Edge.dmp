            "Part of the answer was provided two centuries later by the Austrian monk and plant scientist Gregor Mendel, who <<around 1850|18:0>> was breeding peas in the garden of the Augustinian abbey at Brno. His observations led him to propose that traits such as flower color or pea shape were controlled by heritable \x{201c}factors\x{201d} that could be transmitted, unchanged, from one generation to the next. Mendel\x{2019}s \x{201c}factors\x{201d} thereby provided a repository of heritable information that allowed peas to retain their character through hundreds of generations\x{2014}or through which \x{201c}the cock and its seed doth mint and coine the chicken out of the egge.\x{201d}",

Today, they constitute the foundation on which much of physics and chemistry are built and give us a remarkably complete picture of the building blocks of the entire universe. Indeed, without the explanatory power of quantum mechanics in describing how everything fits together, much of our modern technological world would simply not be possible.",

            "The following year, Jordan did what any self-respecting young European physicist of his generation would have done if given the chance: he spent time in Copenhagen working with Niels Bohr. Some time <<around 1929|18:0>>, the two men began discussing whether quantum mechanics might have some application in the field of biology. Pascual Jordan returned to Germany, to a post at the University of Rostock, from where over the next couple of years he maintained a correspondence with Bohr about the relationship between physics and biology. Their ideas culminated in what is arguably the first scientific paper on quantum biology, written by Jordan in 1932 for the German journal Die Naturwissenschaften and entitled \x{201c}Die Quantenmechanik und die Grundprobleme der Biologie und Psychologie\x{201d} (\x{201c}Quantum mechanics and the fundamental problems of biology and psychology\x{201d}).",

            "Together, DeVault and Chance designed an experiment in which a ruby laser delivered a brief flash of bright red light for just 30 nanoseconds (30 billionths of a second) to bacterial cells packed full of respiratory enzymes. They found that as they reduced the temperature the rate of electron transfer fell until, at <<about 100|3:0>> K (or \x{2212}173\x{b0}C), the electron transfer reaction time was about a thousand times slower than it was at room temperature. This was to be expected if the process of electron transfer was driven primarily by the amount of thermal energy involved. However, something odd happened when DeVault and Chance reduced the temperature below 100 K. Instead of dropping to lower values, the rate of electron transfer seemed to have reached a plateau, remaining constant despite further reduction in temperature, right down to 35 degrees above absolute zero (\x{2212}238\x{b0}C). This indicated that the electron transfer mechanism cannot be due solely to the \x{201c}classical\x{201d} electron-hopping described earlier. The answer, it seems, lies in the quantum world, specifically in the weird process of quantum tunneling that we met in chapter 1.",

            "Richard Axel was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1948, the first child of immigrant parents who had fled Poland before the Nazi invasion. His childhood was typical for the neighborhood: running errands for his father, a tailor, between playing stickball (a kind of street baseball, with manhole covers as the bases and a broom handle as bat) or basketball in the local roads and courtyards. His first job, aged eleven, was as a messenger, delivering false teeth to dentists; at <<twelve|9e>> he was laying carpets, and at thirteen serving corned beef and pastrami in a local delicatessen. The chef was a Russian who used to recite Shakespeare while slicing cabbage heads, providing the young Richard with his first real exposure to the cultural world beyond delis and basketball courts and inspiring a deep and abiding love of great literature. Axel\x{2019}s intellectual talents were spotted by a local high-school teacher who encouraged him to apply, successfully, for a scholarship to Columbia University in New York to read literature.",

It wasn\x{2019}t until <<1940|18:0>> that they hit upon the solution: a tiny adhesive label similar to those that are so difficult to scrape off newly bought glassware. Armed with this device, they began tagging and releasing hundreds of monarch butterflies, each with an identifying number and the instructions that, if it were found, the finder should \x{201c}Send to Zoology, University of Toronto.\x{201d}",

            "But what has any of this to do with quantum mechanics? The answer has to do with another aspect of animal migration, namely the sense we call \x{201c}magnetoreception\x{201d}\x{2014}the ability to detect the earth\x{2019}s magnetic field. As we saw in chapter 1, it has been known for a while that many creatures, including fruit flies and butterflies, possess this capability, and magnetoreception, particularly in robins, has become the poster child of quantum biology. By <<2008|9n:0>> it was clear that the robin\x{2019}s magnetic sense involved light (more on this later), but the nature of the light receptor was elusive. Steven Reppert wondered whether the cryptochrome that provided flies with the light sensitivity that helped to entrain their circadian rhythms could also be involved in their magnetoreception sense. To test the theory he performed the kind of flume choice experiment that Gabriele Gerlach had used to demonstrate olfactory navigation in clownfish (chapter 5), in which the test animal is forced to use sensory cues to choose between two routes to its food.",
