            "Part of the answer was provided two centuries later by the Austrian monk and plant scientist Gregor Mendel, who <<around 1850|18:0>> was breeding peas in the garden of the Augustinian abbey at Brno. His observations led him to propose that traits such as flower color or pea shape were controlled by heritable \x{201c}factors\x{201d} that could be transmitted, unchanged, from one generation to the next. Mendel\x{2019}s \x{201c}factors\x{201d} thereby provided a repository of heritable information that allowed peas to retain their character through hundreds of generations\x{2014}or through which \x{201c}the cock and its seed doth mint and coine the chicken out of the egge.\x{201d}",

            "The following year, Jordan did what any self-respecting young European physicist of his generation would have done if given the chance: he spent time in Copenhagen working with Niels Bohr. Some time <<around 1929|18:0>>, the two men began discussing whether quantum mechanics might have some application in the field of biology. Pascual Jordan returned to Germany, to a post at the University of Rostock, from where over the next couple of years he maintained a correspondence with Bohr about the relationship between physics and biology. Their ideas culminated in what is arguably the first scientific paper on quantum biology, written by Jordan in 1932 for the German journal Die Naturwissenschaften and entitled \x{201c}Die Quantenmechanik und die Grundprobleme der Biologie und Psychologie\x{201d} (\x{201c}Quantum mechanics and the fundamental problems of biology and psychology\x{201d}).",

            "For example, at the time Schr\x{f6}dinger was writing What Is Life?\x{2014}a time when heredity was known to be governed by genes, while the nature of genes was still a mystery\x{2014}he asked the simple question: Are genes big enough to derive their reproductive accuracy from the statistical \x{201c}order from disorder\x{201d} laws? He arrived at an estimated size for a single gene of no bigger than a cube of sides <<about 300|18:0>> angstroms (an angstrom is 0.0000001 millimeters). Such a cube would contain about one million atoms. That may sound like a lot, but the square root of a million is a thousand, so the level of inaccuracy or \x{201c}noise\x{201d} in heredity should be of the order of one in a thousand, or 0.1 percent. So, if heredity were based on classical statistical laws, then it should generate errors (deviations from the laws) at a level of one in a thousand. Yet it was known that genes could be faithfully transmitted with mutation rates (errors) of less than one in one billion. This extraordinary high degree of fidelity convinced Schr\x{f6}dinger that the laws of heredity could not be founded on the \x{201c}order from disorder\x{201d} classical laws. Instead, he proposed that genes were more like individual atoms or molecules in being subject to the nonclassical but strangely orderly rules of the science he helped to found, quantum mechanics. Schr\x{f6}dinger proposed that heredity was based on the novel principle of \x{201c}order from order.\x{201d}",

            "Together, DeVault and Chance designed an experiment in which a ruby laser delivered a brief flash of bright red light for just 30 nanoseconds (30 billionths of a second) to bacterial cells packed full of respiratory enzymes. They found that as they reduced the temperature the rate of electron transfer fell until, at <<about 100|3:0>> K (or \x{2212}173\x{b0}C), the electron transfer reaction time was about a thousand times slower than it was at room temperature. This was to be expected if the process of electron transfer was driven primarily by the amount of thermal energy involved. However, something odd happened when DeVault and Chance reduced the temperature below 100 K. Instead of dropping to lower values, the rate of electron transfer seemed to have reached a plateau, remaining constant despite further reduction in temperature, right down to 35 degrees above absolute zero (\x{2212}238\x{b0}C). This indicated that the electron transfer mechanism cannot be due solely to the \x{201c}classical\x{201d} electron-hopping described earlier. The answer, it seems, lies in the quantum world, specifically in the weird process of quantum tunneling that we met in chapter 1.",

His childhood was typical for the neighborhood: running errands for his father, a tailor, between playing stickball (a kind of street baseball, with manhole covers as the bases and a broom handle as bat) or basketball in the local roads and courtyards. His first job, aged eleven, was as a messenger, delivering false teeth to dentists; at <<twelve|9m>> he was laying carpets, and at thirteen serving corned beef and pastrami in a local delicatessen. The chef was a Russian who used to recite Shakespeare while slicing cabbage heads, providing the young Richard with his first real exposure to the cultural world beyond delis and basketball courts and inspiring a deep and abiding love of great literature. Axel\x{2019}s intellectual talents were spotted by a local high-school teacher who encouraged him to apply, successfully, for a scholarship to Columbia University in New York to read literature.",

            "But whether there are three hundred or a thousand receptor genes, this is very far from the figure of ten thousand different scents that humans can identify. There clearly wasn\x{2019}t a <<one-to-one|10a:0>> mapping between types of odor receptors and types of odors; so how the signals received by olfactory receptors are transformed into smells remained a mystery. It also wasn\x{2019}t clear how the job of detecting all the variety of odor molecules was shared out between different cells. The genome of each cell has the complete set of olfactory receptor genes, so could potentially detect every odor. Or is there some kind of division of labor? To answer these questions the Columbia University team devised an even more ingenious experiment. They genetically altered mice so that all olfactory neurons expressing one particular odor receptor were dyed blue. If all the cells stained blue, that would indicate that they all expressed this receptor. The answer was clear when the team examined the olfactory cells of the engineered mice: approximately one in every thousand cells was dyed blue. It seemed that each olfactory neuron was not a generalist but a specialist.",

            "But what has any of this to do with quantum mechanics? The answer has to do with another aspect of animal migration, namely the sense we call \x{201c}magnetoreception\x{201d}\x{2014}the ability to detect the earth\x{2019}s magnetic field. As we saw in chapter 1, it has been known for a while that many creatures, including fruit flies and butterflies, possess this capability, and magnetoreception, particularly in robins, has become the poster child of quantum biology. By <<2008|9n:0>> it was clear that the robin\x{2019}s magnetic sense involved light (more on this later), but the nature of the light receptor was elusive. Steven Reppert wondered whether the cryptochrome that provided flies with the light sensitivity that helped to entrain their circadian rhythms could also be involved in their magnetoreception sense. To test the theory he performed the kind of flume choice experiment that Gabriele Gerlach had used to demonstrate olfactory navigation in clownfish (chapter 5), in which the test animal is forced to use sensory cues to choose between two routes to its food.",

            'However, chemists are able to synthesize the RNA bases from simple chemicals by going through a very complex series of carefully controlled reactions in which each desired product from one reaction is isolated and purified before taking it on to the next reaction. The Scottish chemist Graham Cairns-Smith estimated that there are <<about 140|18:0>> steps necessary for the synthesis of an RNA base from simple organic compounds likely to have been present in the primordial soup. For each step there is a minimum of about six alternative reactions that need to be avoided. This makes the chemical synthesis easy to visualize, for you can conceive of each molecule as a kind of molecular die, with each step corresponding to a throw where the number six represents generating the correct product and any other number indicates that the wrong product has been made. So, the odds of any starting molecule eventually being converted into RNA is equivalent to throwing a six 140 times in a row.',
