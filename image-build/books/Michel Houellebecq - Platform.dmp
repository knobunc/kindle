            "I was awoken by a weight on my shoulder, and warm breath. I sat my neighbour upright in his seat without undue manhandling; he groaned softly, but didn't open his eyes. He was a big guy, about thirty, with light brown hair in a bowl cut; he didn't look too unpleasant, nor too clever. In fact, he was rather endearing, wrapped up in the soft blue blanket supplied by the airline, his big manual labourer's hands resting on his knees. I picked up the paperback which had fallen at his feet: a shitty Anglo-Saxon bestseller by one Frederick Forsyth. I had read something by this halfwit, full of heavy-handed eulogies to Margaret Thatcher and ludicrous depictions of the USSR as the evil empire. I'd wondered how he managed after the fall of the Berlin Wall. I leafed through his new opus: apparently, this time, the roles of the bad guys were played by Serb nationalists; here was a man who kept up to date with current affairs. As for his beloved hero, the tedious Jason Monk, he had gone back into service with the CIA, which had formed an alliance of convenience with the Chechen mafia. Well! I thought, replacing the book on my neighbour's knees, what a charming sense of morality bestselling British authors have. The page was marked with a piece of paper folded in three, which I recognised as the Nouvelles Frontieres itinerary: I had, apparently, just met my first tour companion. A fine fellow, I was sure, certainly a lot less egocentric and neurotic than I was. I glanced at the video screen, which was showing the flight path: we had probably passed Chechnya, whether or not we had flown over it; the exterior temperature was \"53\x{b0}C, altitude 10,143 metres, local time <<00.27|5a:0>>. Another screen replaced the first: we were flying directly over Afghanistan. Through the window, you could see nothing but pitch black of course. In any case the Taliban were probably all in bed stewing in their own filth. 'Goodnight, Talibans, good night . . . sweet dreams. . .' I whispered before swallowing a second sleeping pill.",

The group, as yet amorphous, would transform itself into a vibrant community; as of this afternoon I would have to start positioning myself, for now I had to choose a pair of shorts for the trip along the khlongs. I opted for a longish pair in blue denim, not too tight, which I complemented with a Radiohead tee-shirt; then I stuffed some odds and ends into a knapsack.

The sun, at its zenith, harshly emphasised planes and ridges. Directly ahead, reflections multiplied themselves into infinity on a complex structure of cones and pyramids of bluish glass. On the horizon, the colossal concrete cubes of the Grand Plaza President were stacked on top of one another like the levels of a step pyramid.

There were farmers\' protests, marked by a desperate violence; tons of slurry were dumped on the Esplanade des Invalides, a number of pigs were gutted in front of the Palais Bourbon. At the end of 1986, the government announced emergency relief followed by a recovery plan for pig-breeders. In April 1987, Valerie\'s father sold his farm - for a little more than four million francs. With the money from the sale, he bought a large apartment in Saint-Quay-Portrieux, where he planned to live, and three studio flats in Torremolinos. He had a million francs left over which he invested in unit trusts and was even able - it was his childhood dream - to buy a small yacht. Sadly, and with some disgust, he signed the farm bill of sale. The new owner was a young guy, <<about twenty-three|9:0>>, single, from Lannion, just out of agricultural college; he still believed in the plans to revive the industry. Valerie\'s father was forty-eight, his wife, forty-seven; they had dedicated the best years of their lives to a hopeless task. They lived in a country where, compared to speculative investment, investment in production brought little return; he understood that now. In their first year, the rents from the studio flats brought in more money than all his years of work. He took up crosswords, took the yacht out into the bay, sometimes fishing. His wife found it easier to adapt to their new life and was a great support to him; she started to want to read again, to go to the cinema, to go out.',

Babette and Lea walked past wearing shoulder-bags but otherwise they too were completely naked. I registered this information without reacting. By contrast, Valerie\'s eyes followed them for a while with shameless curiosity. They settled themselves not far from the Germans. \'I think I\'ll go for a swim . . .\' I said. \'I\'ll go in later,\' she replied. I entered the water effortlessly. It was warm, translucent, deliciously calm; tiny silver fish swam close to the surface. The slope was very gentle, I could still touch bottom a hundred metres from shore. I slipped my cock out of my trunks, closed my eyes and visualised Valerie\'s vagina as I had seen it that morning, half exposed through her lace panties. I was hard, that in itself was something; it could be considered motive enough in itself. Besides, you have to live, you have to relate to other people; I was generally too uptight, and had been so for far too long. Perhaps I should have taken up some hobby in the evenings - badminton, choral singing or something. Even so, the only women I was still able to remember were the ones I\'d fucked. That\'s not nothing either; we build up memories so that we will feel less alone at the moment of death. I shouldn\'t think like that. \'Think positive\', I murmured in English to myself, panicked, \'think different\'. I made my way back to the beach, stopping every ten strokes, breathing deeply to try and calm myself. The first thing I noticed as I stepped on to the sand was that Valerie had taken off her bikini top. At that moment, she was lying on her stomach, but she would turn over, it was as inexorable as the movement of the planets. Where was I exactly? I sat down on my towel,; hunched over slightly. \'Think different\', I reminded myself. I had seen breasts before, I had stroked them, licked them; nonetheless, I found myself in a state of shock. I was sure that she had magnificent breasts; but it was worse than I had imagined. I couldn\'t tear my eyes from the nipples, the areolas; it was impossible for her not to notice me staring - even so, she said nothing for what seemed to me several long seconds. What exactly does go on in women\'s heads? They adapt to the rules of the game so easily. Sometimes, when they look at themselves naked in a full-length mirror, you can see a sort of realism in their eyes, a dispassionate assessment of their personal powers of seduction which no man could ever achieve.

I devoured half the chicken, the skin was charred and greasy, slightly revolting. <<Shortly after three o\'clock|6>> I phoned Valerie. She answered on the second ring. Yes, she was free this evening; for dinner, yes. I could collect her at <<eight|9c:1>>; she lived on the Avenue Reille, near the Pare Montsouris. She answered the door wearing a pair of white tracksuit bottoms and a short tee-shirt. \'I\'m not ready . . .\' she said, pulling her hair back. The movement raised her breasts; she wasn\'t wearing a bra. I put my hands on her waist, leaned my face closer to hers. She parted her lips, immediately slid her tongue into my mouth. A wave of violent excitement shuddered through me; I almost fainted, immediately got a hard on. Without moving her pubis from mine, she pushed the front door, which closed with a dull thud.',

            'Jean-Yves woke at <<five in the morning|5>>, looked over at his wife who was still sleeping. They had spent a terrible weekend with his parents - his wife couldn\'t stand the countryside. Nicolas, his ten-year-old son, loathed the Loiret too, as he couldn\'t bring his computer there; and he didn\'t like his grandparents, he thought they smelled. It was true that his father was slipping, increasingly, it seemed he was unable to look after himself, scarcely interested in anything apart from his rabbits. The only tolerable aspect of these weekends was his daughter, Angelique: at <<three|9m:1>>, she was still capable of going into raptures over cows or chickens; but she was teething at the moment and had spent the greater part of the nights crying and whimpering. Once they got back, after three hours stuck in traffic jams, Audrey had decided to go out with some friends. He had heated up something from the freezer while he watched some mediocre American film about an autistic serial killer - it was apparently based on a true story. The man had been the first mentally ill person to be executed in the state of Nebraska for more than sixty years. His son hadn\'t wanted any dinner, he had immediately launched himself into a game of Total Annihilation - or maybe it was Mortal Kombat II, he got them mixed up. From time to time, he went into his daughter\'s room to try and quieten her howls. She fell asleep <<around one o\'clock|6>>; Audrey still wasn\'t home.',

She told her story easily, too easily, it didn\'t seem natural: her voice was neutral, her face expressionless, rigid, it was as if she was unthinkingly repeating her police statement. Leaving work at <<10.15 p.m.|2a>>, she had decided to take the <<10.21 p.m.|2a>> train, thinking it would be quicker than waiting for a taxi. The carriage was three-quarters empty. Four guys came up to her and immediately started insulting her. As far as she could tell, they were West Indian. She tried to talk to them, make a joke; for her trouble she got a couple of slaps which knocked her half-unconscious. At that point, they jumped her, two of them holding her down on the floor. Violently, brutally, they penetrated her every orifice. Every time she tried to make a sound, she was punched or slapped. It had gone on for a long time, the train had stopped at several stations; passengers got off, warily changed carriages. As the guys took turns raping her, they continued to taunt and insult her, calling her a slut and a douche-bag. By the end there was no one in the compartment. They ended up in a circle around her, spitting and pissing on her, then they shoved her with their feet, until she was half-hidden under one of the seats, then they calmly got off the train at the Gare de Lyon. Two minutes later, the first passengers to board called the police, who arrived almost immediately. The superintendent wasn\'t really surprised; according to him she\'d been relatively lucky. Quite often when they had used the girl, these guys would end up shoving a piece of wood studded with nails into her vagina or her anus. The line was classed as dangerous.',

There\'s a supplement for massages and for lighting the tennis-courts at night.\' The aim of tourist companies is to make people happy, for a specified price, for a specified period. The task can be an easy one, or it can prove impossible -depending on the nature of the people, the services offered and other factors. Valerie took off her trousers and her blouse. I lay down on the other twin bed. A source of permanent, accessible pleasure, our genitals exist. The god who created our misfortune, who made us short-lived, vain and cruel, has also provided this form of meagre compensation. If we couldn\'t have sex from time to time, what would life be? A futile struggle against joints that stiffen, caries that form. All of which, moreover, is as uninteresting as humanly possible - the collagen which makes muscles stiffen, the appearance of microbic cavities in the gums. Valerie parted her thighs above my mouth. She was wearing a pair of sheer tanga briefs in purple lace. I pushed the fabric aside and wet my fingers in order to stroke her labia. For her part, she undid my trousers and took my penis in the palm of her hand. She began to massage my balls gently, unhurriedly. I grabbed a pillow so my mouth would be at the same level as her pussy. At that moment, I saw a maid sweeping the sand from the terrace. The curtains and the window were wide open. As her eyes met mine, the girl burst out laughing. Valerie sat up and motioned to her to come in. She stayed where she was, hesitant, leaning on her broom. Valerie got up, walked towards her and held out her hands. As soon as the girl was inside, she started to open the buttons of her blouse: she was wearing nothing underneath but a pair of white cotton panties; she must have been about twenty, her body was very brown, almost black, she had a firm little bust and finely curved buttocks. Valerie drew the curtains; I got up in turn. The girl\'s name was Margarita. Valerie took her hand and placed it on my penis. She burst out laughing again, but started to jerk me off. Valerie quickly took off her bra and panties, lay down on the bed and started to stroke herself. Again, Margarita hesitated for a moment, then she took off her panties and knelt between Valerie\'s thighs. First she looked at her pussy, stroking it with her hand, then she brought her mouth closer and began to lick it. Valerie put her hand on',
