Bond had nothing on his mind except the frustration of waiting for Station Z somehow to penetrate the reserves of the Swiss S\x{e9}curit\x{e9} and come up with the exact address of Blofeld. But their \x{2018}friends\x{2019} in Zurich were continuing to prove obtuse, or more probably, obstinate. There was no trace of any man, either tourist or resident, called Blofeld in the whole of Switzerland. Nor was there any evidence of the existence of a reborn SPECTRE on Swiss soil. Yes, they fully realized that Blofeld was still urgently \x{2018}wanted\x{2019} by the governments of the N.A.T.O. alliance. They had carefully filed all the circulars devoted to the apprehension of this man, and for the past year he had been constantly reconfirmed on their \x{2018}watch\x{2019} lists at all frontier posts. They were very sorry, but unless the S.I.S. could come up with further information or evidence about this man, they must assume that the S.I.S. was acting on mistaken evidence. Station Z had asked for an examination of the secret lists at the banks, a search through those anonymous \x{2018}numbered\x{2019} accounts which conceal the owners of most of the fugitive money in the world. This request had been peremptorily refused. Blofeld was certainly a great criminal, but the S\x{e9}curit\x{e9} must point out that such information could only be legally obtained if the criminal in question was guilty of some crime committed on Federal soil and indictable under the Federal Code. It was true that this Blofeld had held up Britain and America to ransom by his illegal possession of atomic weapons. But this could not be considered a crime under the laws of Switzerland, and particularly not having regard to Article 47B of the banking laws. So that was that! The Holy Franc, and the funds which backed it, wherever they came from, must remain untouchable. Wir bitten h\x{f6}flichst um Entschuldigung!",

Then there were minute questions about this Sir Hilary Bray. Photographs were asked for, and, suitably doctored, were provided. His whole career since his schooldays had to be detailed and was sent down from Scotland with a highly amused covering note from the real man. To test the market, more funds were asked for by Sable Basilisk and, with encouraging promptitude, were forthcoming in the shape of a further thousand pounds. When the cheque arrived on December 15th Sable Basilisk telephoned Bond delightedly. \x{2018}We've got him,\x{2019} he said, \x{2018}He's hooked!\x{2019} And, sure enough, the next day came a letter from Z\x{fc}rich to say that their client agreed to a meeting with Sir Hilary.

Sir Hilary could, however, manage the 22nd. By return came a cable agreeing and, to Bond, confirming that the fish had not only swallowed the hook but the line and sinker as well.",

What in hell was the bastard up to? He sat down on the right of Irma Bunt in the same placing as for drinks, with Ruby on his right and Violet, dark, demure, self-effacing, opposite him, and glumly opened his napkin. Blofeld had certainly spent money on his eyrie. Their three tables, in a remote corner by the long, curved, curtained window, occupied only a fraction of the space in the big, low, luxuriously appointed, mock-German baroque room, ornate with candelabra suspended from the of flying cherubs, festooned with heavy gilt plasterwork, solemnized by the dark portraits of anonymous noblemen. Blofeld must be pretty certain he was here to stay. What was the investment? Certainly not less than a million sterling, even assuming a fat mortgage from Swiss banks on the cost of the cable railway. To lease an alp, put up a cable railway on mortgage, with the engineers and the local district council participating\x{a0}\x{2013}\x{a0}that, Bond knew, was one of the latest havens for fugitive funds. If you were successful, if you and the council could bribe or bully the local farmers to allow right-of-way through their pastures, cut swaths through the tree-line for the cable pylons and the ski-runs, the rest was publicity and amenities for the public to eat their sandwiches. Add to that the snob-appeal of a posh, heavily restricted club such as Bond imagined this, during the daytime, to be, the coroneted G, and the mystique of a research institute run by a Count, and you were off to the races. Skiing today, Bond had read, was the most widely practised sport in the world. It sounded unlikely, but then one reckoned the others largely by spectators. Skiers were participants, and bigger spenders on equipment than in other sports. Clothes, boots, skis, bindings, and now the whole \x{2018}apr\x{e8}s-ski\x{2019} routine which took care of the day from <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>, when the sun went, onwards, were a tremendous industry.

            "By a rattling Personenzug to Coire and then by express to Z\x{fc}rich, Bond got to the door of the flat of Head of Station Z in the Bahnhofstrasse at <<two in the morning|5>>. He had had some sleep in the train but he was almost out on his feet, and his whole body felt as if it had been beaten with wooden truncheons. He leaned wearily against the bell ticketed \x{2018}Muir\x{2019} until a tousled man in pyjamas came and opened the door and held it on the chain. \x{2018}Um Gottes Willen! Was ist denn los?\x{2019} he inquired angrily. The English accent came through. Bond said, \x{2018}It\x{2019}s me that\x{2019}s \x{201c}los\x{201d}. It\x{2019}s 007 again, I\x{2019}m afraid.\x{2019}",

Here, come into the cockpit, so to speak.\x{2019} He walked across to the book-lined wall, took out a book and fiddled. There was a click and a small door swung open. \x{2018}Mind your head,\x{2019} said Muir. \x{2018}Old disused lavatory. Just the right size. Gets a bit stuffy when there\x{2019}s a lot of traffic coming or going, but that can\x{2019}t be helped. We can afford to leave the door open.\x{2019} He bent down to a safe on the floor, worked the combination, and brought out what looked like a portable typewriter. He set it on the shelf next to the bulky teleprinter, sat down, and clacked off the prefix and routing instructions, winding a small handle at the side of the machine at the end of each word. \x{2018}O.K. Fire away!\x{2019}",

They would get to Kufstein at <<about one|9c:1>>. There was a splendid Gasthaus up the winding streets towards the great castle. Here was a tiny lane of pleasure, full of the heart-plucking whine of zither music and the gentle melancholy of Tyrolean yodellers. It was here that the German tourist traditionally stopped after his day\x{2019}s outing into cheap Austria, just outside the German frontier, for a last giant meal of Austrian food and wine. Bond put his mouth up close to Tracy\x{2019}s ear and told her about it and about the other attraction at Kufstein\x{a0}\x{2013}\x{a0}the most imaginative war memorial, for the 1914-18 war, ever devised. Punctually at <<midday|13>> every day, the windows of the castle are thrown open and a voluntary is played on the great organ inside. It can be heard for kilometres down the valley between the giant mountain ranges for which Kufstein provides the gateway. \x{2018}But we shall miss it. It\x{2019}s coming up for twelve now.\x{2019}",
