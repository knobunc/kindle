            "I\x{2019}m absorbed in the wonder of it all. \x{201c}Maravilloso,\x{201d} Jairo agrees, looking at my face. He\x{2019}s been up since <<2 am|5>> and seen this many times, and yet he, too, is visibly moved. Marine turtles are usually hidden from us in their underwater world, while we are bound to dry land. I\x{2019}ve seen them close up, rarely, while diving, where they move effortlessly and with surprising grace. It is unusual to see large wild animals up close, and to see so many\x{2014}to be surrounded by so many\x{2014}is incredible. Olive ridley turtles, like all marine turtles, are threatened with extinction because of us.",

            "It is fully light now, <<almost 6 am|5>> . Jairo is tired but smiling. The beach we\x{2019}ve had all to ourselves is about to be invaded. \x{201c}Our\x{201d} turtle has finished laying her eggs\x{2014}she carefully covers them with sand and lumbers down to the shore, returning with the other mothers to the ocean, having each played their part in the continuation of their species. I feel ridiculously proprietorial about this beautiful place, having watched its sands fill with turtles and witnessed the private efforts of a mother birthing the next generation, as night turned to day. From the village end of the beach, I see a band of about forty people approaching, carrying large rice sacks and baskets.",

            "Access tells only part of the story; mobile networks have also shifted patterns of use toward an \x{201c}always on\x{201d} mentality. The so-called Generation Z, who were born in the 1990s and have never known a time that lacked these facilities, is now reaching adulthood, and a 2011 survey of Britons aged <<16 to 24|10a:0>> found that 45 percent felt happiest when they were online. Many businesses now expect employees to be constantly contactable by mobile phone and email; equally, domestic and personal matters can be managed from the work desk, breaking down the barrier between separate identities of work and home.",
