evil which would come to them all from illness to herself, she
could not pass through to her room till she had spoken to her
husband. He was sitting in the one sitting-room on the left side of

light in the room, and hardly more than a spark of fire showed in
the grate. The father was sitting on one side of the hearth, in an
old arm-chair, and there he had sat for the last hour without
speaking. His daughter had been in and out of the room, and had
endeavoured to gain his attention now and again by a word, but he
had never answered her, and had not even noticed her presence. At

            "To this Mrs Crawley made no reply. The idea that the cheque had
been found by her husband,\x{2014}had been picked up as Jane had said,\x{2014}had
occurred also to Jane's mother. Mr Soames was confident that he had
dropped the pocket-book at the parsonage. Mrs Crawley had always
disliked Mr Soames, thinking him to be hard, cruel, and vulgar. She
would not have hesitated to believe him guilty of a falsehood, or
even of direct dishonesty, if by so believing she could in her own
mind have found the means of reconciling her husband's possession
of the cheque with absolute truth on his part. But she could not do
so. Even though Soames had, with devilish premeditated malice,
slipped the cheque into her husband's pocket, his having done so
would not account for her husband's having used the cheque when he
found it there. She was driven to make excuses for him which, valid
as they might be with herself, could not be valid with others. He
had said that Mr Soames had paid the cheque to him. That was
clearly a mistake. He had said that the cheque had been given to
him by the dean. That was clearly another mistake. She knew, or
thought she knew, that he, being such as he was, might make such
blunders as these, and yet be true. She believed that such
statements might be blunders and not falsehoods,\x{2014}so convinced was
she that her husband's mind would not act at all times as do the
minds of other men. But having such a conviction she was driven to
believe also that almost anything might be possible. Soames may
have been right, or he might have dropped, not the book, but the
cheque. She had no difficulty in presuming Soames to be wrong in
any detail, if by so supposing she could make the exculpation of
her husband easier to herself. If villainy on the part of Soames
was needful to her theory, Soames would become to her a villain at
once,\x{2014}of the blackest dye. Might it not be possible that the cheque
having thus fallen into her husband's hands, he had come, after a
while, to think that it had been sent to him by his friend, the
dean? And if it were so, would it be possible to make others so
believe? That there was some mistake which would be easily
explained were her husband's mind lucid at all points, but which
she could not explain because of the darkness of his mind, she was
thoroughly convinced. But were she herself to put forward such a
defence on her husband's part, she would in doing so be driven to
say that he was a lunatic,\x{2014}that he was incapable of managing the
affairs of himself or his family. It seemed to her that she would
be compelled to have him proved to be either a thief or a madman.
And yet she knew that he was neither. That he was not a thief was
as clear to her as the sun at <<noonday|13>>. Could she have lain on this
man's bosom for twenty years, and not yet have learned the secrets
of the heart beneath? The whole mind of the man was, as she told
herself, within her grasp. He might have taken the twenty pounds;
he might have taken it and spent it, though it was not his own; but
yet he was no thief. Nor was he a madman. No man more sane in
preaching the gospel of his Lord, in making intelligible to the
ignorant the promises of his Saviour, ever got into a parish
pulpit, or taught in a parish school. The intellect of the man was
as clear as running water in all things not appertaining to his
daily life and its difficulties. He could be logical with a
vengeance,\x{2014}so logical as to cause infinite trouble to his wife,
who, with all her good sense, was not logical. And he had Greek at
his fingers' ends,\x{2014}as his daughter knew very well. And even to this
day he would sometimes recite to them English poetry, lines after
lines, stanzas upon stanzas, in a sweet low melancholy voice, on
long winter evenings when occasionally the burden of his troubles
would be lighter to him than was usual. Books in Latin and in
French he read with as much ease as in English, and took delight in
such as came to him, when he would condescend to accept such loans
from the deanery. And there was at times a lightness of heart about
the man. In the course of the last winter he had translated into
Greek irregular verse the very noble ballad of Lord Bateman,
maintaining the rhythm and the rhyme, and had repeated it with
uncouth glee till his daughter knew it all by heart. And when there
had come to him a five-pound note from some admiring magazine
editor as the price of the same,\x{2014}still through the dean's hands,\x{2014}he
had brightened up his heart and had thought for an hour or two that
even yet the world would smile upon him. His wife knew well that he
was not mad; but yet she knew that there were dark moments with
him, in which his mind was so much astray that he could not justly
be called to account as to what he might remember and what he might
forget. How would it be possible to explain all this to a judge and
jury, so that they might neither say that he was dishonest, nor yet
that he was mad? \"Perhaps he picked it up, and had forgotten,\" her
daughter said to her. Perhaps it was so, but she might not as yet
admit as much even to her child.",

months of their landing in Bombay. The way in which she gave her

            'On the Sunday the poor man had exerted himself to get through
his Sunday duties, and he had succeeded. He had succeeded so well
that his wife had thought that things might yet come right with
him, that he would remember, before it was too late, the true
history of that unhappy piece of paper, and that he was rising
above that half madness which for months past had afflicted him. On
the Sunday evening, when he was tired with his work, she thought it
best to say nothing to him about the magistrates and the business
of Thursday. But on Monday morning she commenced her task, feeling
that she owed it to Mr Walker to lose no more time. He was very
decided in his manners and made her to understand that he would
employ no lawyer on his own behalf. "Why should I want a lawyer? I
have done nothing wrong," he said. Then she tried to make him
understand that many who may have done nothing wrong require a
lawyer\'s aid. "And who is to pay him?" he asked. To this she
replied, unfortunately, that there would be no need of thinking of
that at once. "And I am to get further into debt!" he said. "I am
to put myself right before the world by incurring debts which I
know I can never pay? When it has been a question of food for the
children I have been weak, but I will not be weak in such a matter
as this. I will have no lawyer." She did not regard this denial on
his part as very material, though she would fain have followed Mr
Walker\'s advice had she been able; but when, later in the day, he
declared that the police should fetch him, then her spirits gave
way. Early in the morning he had seemed to assent to the expedient
of going into Silverbridge on the Thursday, and it was not till
after he had worked himself into a rage about the proposed
attorney, that he utterly refused to make the journey. During the
whole day, however, his state was such as almost to break his
wife\'s heart. He would do nothing. He would not go to the school,
nor even stir beyond the house-door. He would not open a book. He
would not eat, nor would he even sit at table or say the accustomed
grace when the scanty <<mid-day|13>> meal was placed upon the table.
"Nothing is blessed to me," he said, when his wife pressed him to
say the word for their child\'s sake. "Shall I say that I thank God
when my heart is thankless? Shall I serve my child by a lie?" Then
for hours he sat in the same position, in the old arm-chair,
hanging over the fire speechless, sleepless, thinking ever, as she
well knew, of the injustice of the world. She hardly dared to speak
to him, so great was the bitterness of his words when he was goaded
to reply. At last, late in the evening, feeling that it would be
her duty to send to Mr Walker early on the following morning, she
laid her hand gently on his shoulder and asked him for his promise.
"I may tell Mr Walker that you will be there on Thursday?"',

single word, but seemed to clutch at his thin locks more violently
than before. Then she kneeling there, aloud, but with a low voice,
with her thin hands clasped, uttered a prayer in which she asked
her God to remove from her husband the bitterness of that hour. He
listened till she had finished, and then he rose slowly to his
feet. "It is all in vain," said he. "It is all in vain. It is all
in vain." Then he returned back to the parlour, and seating himself
again in the arm-chair, remained there without speaking till <<past

given to Major Grantly. \"If I were you, I'd be at Allington before
<<twelve o'clock|6>> to-morrow.\" That had been Mrs Thorne's advice; and
though Major Grantly had no idea of making the journey so rapidly
as the lady had proposed, still he thought that he would make it
before long, and follow the advice in spirit if not to the letter.
Mrs Thorne had asked him if it was fair that the girl should be
punished because of the father's fault; and the idea had been sweet
to him that the infliction or non-infliction of such punishment
should be in his hands. \"You go and ask her,\" Mrs Thorne had said.
Well;\x{2014}he would go and ask her. If it should turn out at last that
he had married the daughter of a thief, and that he was
disinherited for doing so,\x{2014}an arrangement of circumstances which he
had to teach himself to regard as very probable,\x{2014}he would not love
Grace the less on that account, or allow himself for one moment to
repent what he had done. As he thought of all this he became
somewhat in love with a small income, and imagined to himself what
honours would be done to him by the Mrs Thornes of the county, when
they should come to know in what way he had sacrificed himself to
his love. Yes;\x{2014}they would go and live at Pau. He thought Pau would
do. He would have enough of income for that;\x{2014}and Edith would get
lessons cheaply, and would learn to talk French fluently. He
certainly would do it. He would go down to Allington, and ask Grace
to be his wife; and bid her to understand that if she loved him she
could not be justified in refusing him by the circumstances of her
father's position.",

Allington by the road he had entered it, as he had no wish to
encounter Grace and her friend on their return into the village; so
he crossed a little brook which runs at the bottom of the hill on
which the chief street of Allington is built, and turned into a
field-path to the left as soon as he had got beyond the houses. Not
knowing the geography of the place he did not understand that by
taking that path he was making his way back to the squire\'s house;

crossing back again over the stream, of which he took no notice, he
found himself leaning across a gate, and looking into a paddock on

To avoid this he went on a little further and found himself on a
farm road, and before he could retrace his steps so as not to be

custom; but Major Grantly had not perceived that the house must of

the entrance to the place, as he entered the village on the other

following that on which Miss Demolines had written her note,\x{2014}the
easel was put up and the canvas was placed on it in Mrs Broughton's
room. Mrs Broughton and Clara were both there, and when they had
seen the outlines as far as it had been drawn, they proceeded to
make arrangements for their future operations. The period of work
was to begin always at <<eleven|9c:1>>, and was to be continued for an hour
and a half or for two hours on the days on which they met. I fear
that there was a little improper scheming in this against the two
persons whom the ladies were bound to obey. Mr Dobbs Broughton
invariably left his house soon <<after ten in the morning|9h>>. It would
sometimes happen, though not frequently, that he returned home
early in the day,\x{2014}at four perhaps, or even before that; and should
he chance to do so while the picture was going on, he would catch
them at their work if the work were postponed till after luncheon.
And then again, Mrs Van Siever would often go out in the morning,
and when she did so, would always go without her daughter. On such
occasions she went into the City, or to other resorts of business,
at which, in some manner quite unintelligible to her daughter, she
looked after her money. But when she did not go out in the morning,
she did go out in the afternoon, and she would then require her
daughter's company. There was some place to which she always went
of a Friday morning, and at which she stayed for two or three
hours. Friday therefore was a fitting day on which to begin the
work at Mrs Broughton's house. All this was explained between the
three conspirators. Mrs Dobbs Broughton declared that if she
entertained the slightest idea that her husband would object to the
painting of the picture in her room, nothing on earth would induce
her to lend her countenance to it; but yet it might be well not to
tell him just at first, perhaps not till the sittings were
over,\x{2014}perhaps not till the picture was finished; as, otherwise,
tidings of the picture might get round to ears which were not
intended to hear it. \"Poor dear Dobbs is so careless with a
secret.\" Miss Van Siever explained her motives in a very different
way. \"I know mamma would not let me do it if she knew it; and
therefore I shall not tell her.\" \"My dear Clara,\" said Mrs
Broughton with a smile \"you are so outspoken!\" \"And why not?\" said
Miss Van Siever. \"I am old enough to judge for myself. If mamma
does not want to be deceived, she ought not to treat me like a
child. Of course she'll find it out sooner or later; but I don't
care about that.\" Conway Dalrymple said nothing as the two ladies
were thus excusing themselves. \"How delightful it must be not to
have a master,\" said Mrs Broughton, addressing him. \"But then a man
has to work for his own bread,\" said he. \"I suppose it comes about
equal in the long run.\"",

distinct classes of waiters, and as far as I have been able to
perceive, the special status of the waiter in question cannot be
decided by observation of the class of waiter to which he belongs.

may the dapper waiter. Or you may find both in each, and not know

and I never knew money to be so tight as it is at this moment. The
best commercial bills going can't be done under nine, and any other
kind of paper can't so much as get itself looked at.\" Thus spoke Mr
Musselboro. He was seated in Dobbs Broughton's arm-chair in Dobbs
Broughton's room in Hook Court, on the hind legs of which he was
balancing himself comfortably; and he was communicating his
experience in City matters to our old friend, Adolphus Crosbie,\x{2014}of
whom we may surmise that he would not have been there, at that
moment, in Hook Court, if things had been going well with him. It
was now <<past eleven o'clock|6>>, and he should have been at his office
at the West End. His position in his office was no doubt high
enough to place him beyond the reach of any special inquiry as to
such absences; but it is generally felt that when the Crosbies of
the West End have calls into the City <<about noon|13>>, things in the
world are not going well with them. The man who goes into the City
to look for money is generally one who does not know where to get
money when he wants it. Mr Musselboro on this occasion kept his hat
on his head, and there was something in the way in which he
balanced his chair which was in itself an offence to Mr Crosbie's
personal dignity. It was hardly as yet two months since Mr Dobbs
Broughton had assured him in that very room that there need not be
the slightest anxiety about his bill. Of course it could be
renewed,\x{2014}the commission being duly paid. As Mr Dobbs Broughton
explained on that occasion, that was his business. There was
nothing he liked so much as renewing bills for such customers as Mr
Crosbie; and he was very candid at that meeting, explaining how he
did this branch of his business, raising money on his own credit at
four or five per cent., and lending it on his own judgment at eight
or nine. Mr Crosbie did not feel himself then called upon to
exclaim that what he was called upon to pay was about twelve,
perfectly understanding the comfort and grace of euphony; but he
had turned it over in his mind, considering whether twelve per
cent. was not more than he ought to be mulcted for the
accommodation he wanted. Now, at the moment, he would have been

left Mr Dale and Lily at their lodgings. He had other business in
hand to which he had promised to give attention, and another person
to see who would welcome his coming quite as warmly, though by no
means as pleasantly, as Lily Dale. It was then just <<nine o'clock|6>>,
and as he had told Miss Demolines,\x{2014}Madalina we may as well call her
now,\x{2014}that he would be in Porchester Terrace by nine at the latest,
it was incumbent on him to make haste. He got into a cab, and bid
the cabman drive hard, and lighting a cigar, began to inquire of
himself whether it was well for him to hurry away from the presence
of Lily Dale to that of Madalina Demolines. He felt that he was
half-ashamed of what he was doing. Though he declared to himself
over and over again that he never had said a word, and never
intended to say a word, to Madalina, which all the world might not
hear, yet he knew that he was doing amiss. He was doing amiss, and
half repented it, and yet he was half proud of it. He was most
anxious to be able to give himself credit for his constancy to Lily
Dale; to be able to feel that he was steadfast in his passion; and
yet he liked the idea of amusing himself with his Bayswater
romance, as he would call it, and was not without something of
conceit as he thought of the progress he had made in it. \"Love is
one thing and amusement is another,\" he said to himself as he
puffed the cigar smoke out of his mouth; and in his heart he was
proud of his own capacity for enjoyment. He thought it a fine
thing, although at the same moment he knew it to be an evil
thing\x{2014}this hurrying away from the young lady whom he really loved
to another as to whom he thought it very likely that he should be
called upon to pretend to love her. And he sang a little song as he
went, \"If she be not fair to me, what care I how fair she be.\" That
was intended to apply to Lily, and was used as an excuse for his
fickleness in going to Miss Demolines. And he was, perhaps, too, a
little conceited as to his mission to the Continent. Lily had told
him that she was very glad that he was going; that she thought him
very right to go. The words had been pleasant to his ears, and Lily
had never looked prettier in his eyes than when she had spoken
them. Johnny, therefore, was rather proud of himself as he sat in
the cab smoking his cigar. He had, moreover, beaten his old enemy
Sir Raffle Buffle in another contest, and he felt that the world
was smiling on him;\x{2014}that the world was smiling on him in spite of
his cruel fate in the matter of his real lovesuit.",

As long as Miss Demolines would continue to talk about herself he
could listen with some amount of gratification. Conversation on
that subject was the natural progress of the Bayswater romance. And
if Madalina would only call her friend by her present name, he had
no strong objection to an occasional mention of the lady; but the
combined names of Maria Clutterbuck had come to be absolutely
distasteful to him. He did not believe in the Maria Clutterbuck
friendship,\x{2014}either in its past or present existence, as described
by Madalina. Indeed, he did not put strong faith in anything that
Madalina said to him. In the handsome gentleman with two thousand a
year, he did not believe at all. But the handsome gentleman had
only been mentioned once in the course of his acquaintance with
Miss Demolines, whereas Maria Clutterbuck had come up so often!

            "What was Johnny to do, when he left Tavistock Square? His club
was open to him. Should he go to his club, play a game of
billiards, and have some supper? When he asked himself the question
he knew that he would not go to his club, and yet he pretended to
doubt about it, as he made his way to a cabstand in Tottenham Court
Road. It would be slow, he told himself, to go to his club. He
would have gone to see Lily Dale, only that his intimacy with Mrs
Thorne was not sufficient to justify his calling at her house
between <<nine|90>> and <<ten o'clock at night|6>>. But, as he must go
somewhere,\x{2014}and as his intimacy with Lady Demolines was, he thought,
sufficient to justify almost anything,\x{2014}he would go to Bayswater. I
regret to say that he had written a mysterious note from Paris to
Madalina Demolines, saying that he should be in London on this very
night, and that it was just on the cards that he might make his way
up to Porchester Terrace before he went to bed. The note was
mysterious, because it had neither beginning nor ending. It did not
contain even initials. It was written like a telegraph message, and
was about as long. It was the kind of thing Miss Demolines liked,
Johnny thought; and there could be no reason why he should not
gratify her. It was her favourite game. Some people like whist,
some like croquet, and some like intrigue. Madalina probably would
have called it romance,\x{2014}because by nature she was romantic. John,
who was made of sterner stuff, laughed at this. He knew that there
was no romance in it. He knew that he was only amusing himself, and
gratifying her at the same time, by a little innocent pretence. He
told himself that it was his nature to prefer the society of women
to that of men. He would have liked the society of Lily Dale, no
doubt, much better than that of Miss Demolines; but as the society
of Lily Dale was not to be had at that moment, the society of Miss
Demolines was the best substitute within his reach. So he got into
a cab and had himself driven to Porchester Terrace. \"Is Lady
Demolines at home?\" he said to the servant. He always asked for
Lady Demolines. But the page who was accustomed to open the door
for him was less false, being young, and would now tell him,
without any further fiction, that Miss Madalina was in the
drawing-room. Such was the answer he got from the page on this
evening. What Madalina did with her mother on these occasions he
had never yet discovered. There used to be some little excuses
given about Lady Demolines' state of health, but latterly Madalina
had discontinued her references to her mother's headaches. She was
standing in the centre of the drawing-room when he entered it, with
both her hands raised, and an almost terrible expression of mystery
in her face. Her hair, however, had been very carefully arranged so
as to fall with copious carelessness down her shoulders, and
altogether she was looking her best. \"Oh, John,\" she said. She
called him John by accident in the tumult of the moment. \"Have you
heard what has happened? But of course you have heard it.\"",

together in Holborn. Between them there was no word said about Lily
Dale, and John was glad to have some other subject in his mind for
half an hour. Toogood was full of his triumph about Mr Crawley and
of his successes in Barsetshire. He gave John a long account of his
visit to Plumstead, and expressed his opinion that if all clergymen
were like the archdeacon there would not be so much room for
Dissenters. \"I've seen a good many parsons in my time,\" said
Toogood; \"but I don't think I ever saw such a one as him. You know
he is a clergyman somehow, and he never lets you forget it; but
that's about all. Most of 'em are never contented without choking
you with their white cravats all the time you're with 'em. As for
Crawley himself,\" Mr Toogood continued, \"he's not like anybody else
that ever was born, saint or sinner, parson or layman. I never
heard of such a man in all my experience. Though he knew where he
got the cheque as well I know it now, he wouldn't say so, because
the dean had said it wasn't so. Somebody ought to write a book
about it,\x{2014}indeed they ought.\" Then he told the whole story of Dan
Stringer, and how he had found Dan out, looking at the top of Dan's
hat through the little aperture in the wall of the inn parlour.
\"When I saw the twitch in his hat, John, I knew he had handled the
cheque himself. I don't mean to say that I'm sharper than another
man, and I don't think so; but I do mean to say that when you are
in any difficulty of that sort, you ought to go to a lawyer. It's
his business, and a man does what is his business with patience and
perseverance. It's a pity, though, that the scoundrel should get
off.\" Then Eames gave his uncle an account of his Italian trip, to
and fro, and was congratulated also upon his success. John's great
triumph lay in the fact that he had been only two nights in bed,
and that he would not have so far condescended on those occasions
but for the feminine weakness of his fellow-traveller. \"We shan't
forget it all in a hurry,\x{2014}shall we, John?\" said Mr Toogood, in a

Holborn. Toogood was returning to his office, and John Eames was to

Homer he had declared to himself that he would never go near Miss

to him now. He would simply send her his compliments and say that
he was prevented by business from keeping his engagement. She, of
course, would go on writing to him for a time, but he would simply
leave her letters unanswered, and the thing, of course, would come
to an end at last. He afterwards said something to Boulger about
Miss Demolines,\x{2014}but that was during the jollity of their
supper,\x{2014}and he then declared that he would follow out that little
game. \"I don't see why a fellow isn't to amuse himself, eh,

amusements were dangerous. \"I don't think that there is any danger
there,\" said Johnny. \"I don't believe she is thinking of that kind
of thing herself;\x{2014}not with me at least. What she likes is the
pretence of a mystery; and as it is amusing I don't see why a
fellow shouldn't indulge her.\" But that determination was
pronounced after two mutton chops at \"The Cock\", between <<one|90>> and

wiser. Greek he thought might be tedious as he discovered that he

he would take up the sanitary condition of the poor in London. A
fellow could be of some use in that way. In the meantime he would
