Or Miranda. Or Saffron. Dad\x{2019}s last Christmas before he died, when he staggered out of hospital to go to <<Midnight|13>> Mass in Grafton Underwood; the first Christmas when Mark and I went to church, holding Billy in a little Santa Claus outfit; the Christmas when Billy had his first Nativity Play at nursery school, which was the first Christmas after Mark\x{2019}s brutal, horrible death, when I couldn\x{2019}t believe that Christmas would be so cruel as to actually try to happen.",
