            "Regardless of who the English teacher was, I am not in the habit of throwing my money away. And that, my friends, is what it would have amounted to. Why not hire an expensive private tutor to teach the squirrels to speak in French! It would be no more ridiculous than teaching Khe Sahn English. A person has to want to learn. I know that. Apparently, back in Ho Chi Minh City, Her Majesty was treated like a queen and sees no reason to change her ways!!!! Her Highness rises at <<around noon|13>>, wolfs down a fish or two (all she eats is fish and chicken breasts), and settles herself before the makeup mirror, waiting for her father to return home from work. At the sound of his car in the drive-way she perks up and races to the door like a spaniel, panting and wagging her tail to beat the band! Suddenly she is eager to please and attempt conversation!! Well, I don\x{2019}t know how they behave in Vietnam, but in the United States it is not customary for a half-dressed daughter to offer her father a five-dollar massage!!! After having spent an exhausting day attempting to communicate a list of simple chores, I would stand in amazement at Khe Sahn\x{2019}s sudden grasp of English when faced with my husband.",

            "I can\x{2019}t account for every moment of my afternoon. Never did it occur to me that I would one day be called upon to do so but, that being the case, I will report what I remember. I can comfortably testify that, on the afternoon of December sixteenth, I visited the White Paw Shopping Center, where I spent a brief amount of time in The Slack Heap, searching for a gift for Kyle. I found what he wanted but not in his size. I then left The Slack Heap and walked over to \x{2014} \x{2014} \x{2014} & \x{2014} \x{2014} -, where I bought a \x{2014} \x{2014} \x{2014} for my daughter Jacki. (I\x{2019}m not going to ruin anyone\x{2019}s Christmas surprises here. Why should I?) I stuck my head inside Turtleneck Crossing and searched for candles at Wax and Wane. I bought a gift for Clifford at \x{2014} \x{2014} -, and I suppose I browsed. There are close to a hundred shops at the White Paw Center and you\x{2019}ll have to forgive me if I can\x{2019}t provide a detailed list of how long I spent in this or that store. I shopped until I grew wary of the time. On the way home I stopped at The Food Carnival and bought a few items. It was getting dark, perhaps <<four-thirty|5k:1>>, when I pulled into the driveway of our home on Tiffany Circle. I collected my packages from the car and entered my home, where I was immediately struck by the eerie silence. \x{2018}This doesn\x{2019}t feel right to me,\x{2019} I remember saying to myself. It was an intuition, a mother\x{2019}s intuition, that unexplainable language of the senses. I laid down my bags and was startled by the sound they made \x{2014} the crisp noise of paper bags settling against the floor. The problem was that I could hear the sound at all! Normally I would have heard nothing over the chronic bleating of Baby Don and the incessant blaring radio of Khe Sahn.",

Cherise Clarmont-Shea certainly understands the meaning of the word creep, doesn\x{2019}t she? She\x{2019}s been married to one for so long that she has turned into something of a creep herself!! How many times have I opened the door to Cherise, her face swollen and mustard-colored, suffering another of her husband\x{2019}s violent slugfests! She\x{2019}s been smacked in the face so many times she\x{2019}s lucky if she can see anything through those swollen eyes of hers! If the makeup she applies is any indication of her vision, then I believe it is safe to say she can\x{2019}t see two inches in front of her, much less testify to the identity of someone she might think she\x{2019}s seen crossing her yard. She\x{2019}s on pills, everyone knows that. She\x{2019}s desperate for attention and I might pity her under different circumstances. I did not return home early and creep through the Shea\x{2019}s unkept backyard, but even if I had, what possible motive would I have had? Why would I, as certain people have been suggesting, want to murder my own grandchild? This is madness, pure and simple. It reminds me of a recurring night-mare I often have wherein I am desperately trying to defend my-self against a heavily armed hand puppet. The grotesque puppet angrily accuses me of spray-painting slogans on his car. I have, of course, done no such thing. \x{2018}This is insane, preposterous,\x{2019} I think to myself. \x{2018}This makes no sense,\x{2019} I say, all the while eye-ing the loaded weapon in his small hands and praying for this nightmare to end. Cherise Clarmont-Shea has no more sense than a hand puppet. She has three names!

What are they hiding? I feel it is of utmost importance to consider the source.",

I can see it now: the dean and his spaniels are shoveling forkfuls of red meat while poor Malison just sits there, tuning out their petty conversation and gagging at the sight of the carnage on his plate. Even the vegetables in this town are cooked in blood. I think it\x{2019}s pretty obvious that the English Department knows nothing about Malison. They just see him as another feather in their cap, a name they can use to attract new students. It makes me sick.

He says, \x{2018}I hope it doesn\x{2019}t tire him out,\x{2019} and \x{2018}Folks, you are looking at the original boob tube.\x{2019} I wish that I could see the people\x{2019}s faces as they look in amazement at me, a man made of inner tubes, a dark tornado that can save them from drowning.",

That was bad enough, but to make matters worse I did not live alone but had to share the place with a community of honest-to-God trolls. These were small trolls with full beards and pointy, curled shoes. The trolls were hideously and relentlessly merry. They called me by name, saying, \x{2018}Glen, so glad you could join us! Look, everybody, Glen\x{2019}s here!
