Across the road two fat men sit on rusty folding chairs drinking arak and laughing; a foot or so above their heads a coloured litho Nasser is not amused. In economy-sized cafis behind doors artfully contrived to preserve a dicor of absolute darkness they are serving economy-sized coffees of similar darkness with exotic pastries of honey-smothered nuts and seeds. Clients - young Turks, Greeks dressed like left bank intellectuals - find their seats by the light of a juke box inside which Yves Montand and Sarah Vaughan are crowded. Outside in the blinding sunlight, antiquated trams spew out agile targets for the Mercedes taxis. Dark-skinned young men with long black hair parade along the water\x{2019}s edge in bikinis almost big enough to conceal a comb. Below me in the street two young men on rusty cycles balancing a long tray of unleavened bread between them, are nearly brought down by a frenetic dog which yelps its fear and anger. In the souks men from the desert pass among the moneychangers - the carpet men and the sellers of saddles for horse, camel and bicycle. In Room 624 bars of sunlight lay heavily across the carpet. The hotel intercom hummed with old tapes of Sinatra, but he was losing a battle with the noise of the air-conditioning. Room 624, which the department had booked for me, came complete with private bath, private refrigerator, scales, magnifying mirrors, softened water, phones by bed, phones by bath. I poured another large cup of black coffee and decided to investigate my baggage. The blue wardrobe bag unzipped to reveal - lightweight blue worsted suit, a seersucker jacket, a used overall with zip front and more pockets than I knew how to use. In the bag\x{2019}s side pockets were some new white and plain-coloured cotton shirts, a couple of plain ties, one wool, one silk, a belt, slim leather and Italian, and a pair of red braces; didn\x{2019}t miss a trick, that Alice.

It had the usual employment bureau rubber stamp and 14143/6/0 written in large flomaster lettering. Typewritten on light-green paper, it was yet another file on the man we called Jay. I had never seen a green file before but it had a much higher security clearance than the ordinary white ones. I read of his university progress and his training in Jungian psychology (discontinued after two years) and his unsuccessful excursion into the timber business. It had the usual outline of Jay\x{2019}s career up to June 1942, then instead of the gap in the story I read of Jay, then Christian Stakowski, being recruited into Polish Army Intelligence based in London. He made two very hazardous trips into southern Poland, the second time his air pick-up failing to contact. His next emergence from the unknown was when he appeared in Cairo reporting back to the Polish Army, who gave him the V.M.. [VIRTUTI MILITARI, The Polish V.C.] in December \x{2018}42. He was sent back to England and did the eight month course at the place they had in Horsham. By this time the chain of cells he worked with in Poland had been decimated and a photostat in the file shows that Polish Army counter-intelligence had the possibility that he had done a deal with the Germans added to his papers. Another letter dated May \x{2018}43 points this possibility up by showing that the arrests along his chain were all by the same department of German Investigation.",

I went upstairs. Murray was leaning over a big scrubbed table with the elderly constable, a sergeant and an inspector with a neatly trimmed moustache. I asked the sergeant who the inspector was. It didn\x{2019}t make any of them madly happy, but \x{2018}twice bitten could get to be a habit\x{2019}. Murray had worked out a sensible way of hitting 42 Acacia Drive. He had dug out a photo of the street and had drawn a diagram showing heights of garden walls and deploying twenty-five men. Murray had also implied by unknown subtle means that his rank was considerably higher than sergeant. The inspector was deferring to his suggestions and the police sergeant was saying, \x{2018}Yes sir, good sir, very good, sir.\x{2019} I told the policemen that they could come along if they wished, but explained that since I had put \x{2018}complete blackout\x{2019} on the operation, any leakage would be actionable under the Official Secrets Act.",

The wind had dropped and now the aircraft had passed over it seemed very quiet and still. In the distance I heard a train. I stood there unhappily, my feet were wet and made little sucking sounds. I felt Murray touch my elbow with the cold metal jemmy. Looking round I found him pretending it was an accident. I took the hint. The side window was higher than it had looked from the road. Reaching up with the sticky brown paper I smoothed it across the glass and a little syrup ran down my wrist. Murray stuck the jemmy into the woodwork, but it was locked right enough. The window to the left was barred, so he hit the brown paper covered pane with the iron. A muffled syrupy crunch and then the broken glass fell inwards hinged on the brown paper. Murray was groping for the fastejungs as we did a Charleston in slow motion on the flower-bed. The window swung open and Murray dived head first through.

Snatches of German and small bite-sized pieces of Hungarian ran like strands of a web across the clipped Harvard speech and the drawn-out vowels of men who had been at Oak Ridge for so long that it had become their permanent home. I moved slowly listening with my fingertips. No eye followed me as I entered the lounge where gaunt tubular frames had large floral-patterned plastic padding impaled upon them in relentless discomfort. Near the window I saw Jean; the group of air crew I had noticed at the bar the previous evening were flying close formation on her. I knew they were s.a.c. lead crews. The lead crews were the ones with the higher scores at bombing and navigation. They are raised a rank when they become lead crews, and so these boys were majors and lieutenant-colonels. One of the biannual exams they had, involved the committing to memory of one complete enemy target briefing. If they fail the exam they revert to their old rank. This had been a complicated session in 1944, but now, flying these eight jet B52\x{2019}s at <<600|3:1>> m.p.h. after a thirty minute check over the intercom before take-off, it was cosmic! Finding the tanker aircraft whose crew, one hoped, was similarly skilled in navigation; refuelling in flight while moving at stalling speed behind a tanker only three feet away, and then moving on a town they had never seen except in photographs; to drop a thermo-nuclear bomb, was a test of mathematical skill, dexterity, memory, and of confidence in the judgment of their leaders unparalleled since Constantine\x{2019}s Edict saw the last Christian share a double bill with the lions. Soviet air space was often penetrated at a time when an explosion or a launching was expected. These S.A.C. people were going to observe this one from the air as a comparison. To know which Soviet ground targets these three man crews had committed to memory would be a very valuable \x{2018}intelligence sequence\x{2019}. The chances of Jean unloading such an item from them was remote, but I sat down a few chairs away and busied myself with some old unchecked expense accounts and indents that Alice had slipped into my case at the last moment without my noticing. Jean was doing a thing that men agents have to learn, but most women do naturally. She stood back and let the conversation move between the others, listening or guiding as needed.

A red and yellow butterfly entered the white chalky bars of light from the aperture. Slowly I moved towards the corner position. It was darker and damper there.

He was very quiet, and without looking at me said, \x{2018}Every time some stinking detail comes up I find myself doing it.\x{2019} I thought he was referring to me, but he passed some photographs across his desk. One was a sepia-toned vignette such as any small town photo studio would take for a dollar. The other two were official identity photos, full face and side view. Each was a photograph of a corporal about twenty-two-twenty-four years old, fair-haired, open face. I\x{2019}d guess a mid-west farmer\x{2019}s son. There was a fourth photo, a poor blurred snapshot. This time with a young girl, pretty in a conventional way - they were standing alongside a new Buick. On the back it said, \x{2018}Schultz Drug Store. 24-Hour Foto Service\x{2019}. I handed the pictures back. \x{2018}So?\x{2019} I said, \x{2018}a soldier.\x{2019}",
