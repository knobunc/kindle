Congress was convinced that $300 Billion per year was about right to defend against a Cold War enemy that couldn\'t feed its own people.

            'He thought this hearing was a deep dark secret. A couple of fellow journalists agreed, and the only reason they had found out about the Rickfield hearings was because the CNN producer called them asking if they knew anything about them. Apparently, Scott was told, CNN received an anonymous call, urging them to be part of a blockbuster announcement. When CNN called Rickfield\'s office, his staffers told CNN that there was no big deal, and that they shouldn\'t waste their time. In the news business, that kind of statement from a Congressional power broker is a sure sign that it is worth being there. Just in case. So CNN assigned a novice producer and a small crew to the first day of the hearings. As promised, the morning session was an exercise in terminal boredom. The afternoon session was to begin at <<1:30|2>>, but Senator Rickfield was nowhere to be found, so the Assistant Chairperson of the committee, Junior Senator Nancy Deere assumed control. She was a 44 year old grandmother of two from New England who had never considered entering politics. Nancy Deere was the consummate wife, supporter and stalwart of her husband Morgan Deere, an up and coming national politician who had the unique mixture of honesty, appeal and potential. She had spent full time on the campaign trail with Morgan as he attempted to make the transition from state politics to Washington. Morgan Deere was heavily favored to win after the three term incumbent was named a coconspirator in the rigging of a Defense contract. Despite the pending indictments, the race continued with constant pleadings by the incumbent that the trumped up charges would shortly be dismissed. In the first week after the Grand Jury was convened, the voter polls indicated that Deere led with a 70% support factor.',

He also heard from Kirk on the paper\'s supposedly secure network. Neither he nor the technical network gurus ever figured out how he got in the system. The network administrators installed extra safeguards after Scott tipped them that he had been receiving messages from outside the paper. They added what they called \'audit trails\'. Audit trails are supposed to record and remember every activity on the net-work. The hope was that they could observe Kirk remotely entering the computer and then identify the security breach. Despite their attempts, Kirk continued to enter the Times\' computers at will, but without any apparent disruption of the system. It took Scott some time to convince the network managers that Kirk posed no threat, but they felt that any breach was potentially a serious threat to journalistic privilege. Reporters kept their notes on the computer. Sources, addresses, phone numbers, high level anonymous contacts and identities, all stored within a computer that is presumably protected and secure. In reality, the New York City Times computer, like most computers. is as open as a sieve. Scott could live with it. He merely didn\'t keep any notes on the computer.

            'Eileen Isselbacher had worked at Lotus as a Spreadsheet Customer Service Manager for almost two years. She was well respected and ran a tight ship. Her first concern, one that her management didn\'t necessarily always share, was to the customer. If someone shelled out $500 for a program, they were entitled to impeccable service and assistance. Despite her best efforts, though, Lotus had come to earn a reputation of arrogance and indifference to customer complaints. It was a constant public relations battle; for the salespeople, for customer service, and for the financial people who attempted to insure a good Wall Street image. The service lines are shut down at <<6 P.M.|5>> EST and then Eileen enters the Service Data Base. The SDB is a record of all service calls. The service reps logged the call, the serial #, the type of problem and the resolution. Eileen\'s last task of the day was to compile the data accumulated during the day and issue a daily summation report.',
