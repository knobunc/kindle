Martin was more used to this scale than the one that would have been familiar to his father. The children had converted some of the moms\x{2019} technical terms to more informal language: thus, the closest star was a Buttercup Seven, <<about nine|9:0>> tenths the mass and diameter of Sol, bright yellow, relatively high in metals. The second closest was a Cornflower Two, one and a half times Sol\x{2019}s mass, with a lower percentage of metals. The third star in the group was an aging Firestorm Three, a brilliant bloated red giant. The Buttercup Seven had four planets, two of them peculiar, diminished gas giants.",
