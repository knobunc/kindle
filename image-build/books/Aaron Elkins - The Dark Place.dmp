All told, including a three-hour drive and allowing for a rough trail, it would take him eight or nine hours to get to Finley Creek from where he was sitting. If he left now he\x{2019}d arrive in Yahi territory at about dark. Not the most enchanting idea in the world. It\x{2019}d be better to take the rest of the day to learn some more Yahi, and leave early Wednesday.

No, it would be best to work right where he was all day, go to bed early, and get on his way the next day at <<4:00 a.m.|2a>> or so.
