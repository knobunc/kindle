It is all very splendid: it is all a bit tiring. And so it is fortunate that the neighbouring Corn-market can offer to the visitor its string of snack bars, coffee bars, and burger bars in which to rest his feet and browse through his recently purchased literature about those other colleges and ecclesiastical edifices, their dates and their benefactors, which thus far have fallen outside his rather arbitrary circumambulations.

            "That morning, in Kidlington, his lecture on Homicide Procedures to a group of earnest, newly fledged detectives (Constable Walters amongst them) had been received with a polite lack of enthusiasm, and Morse knew that he had been far from good. How glad he was to have the afternoon free! Furthermore, for the first time in many months he had every reason to be in the precincts of Jericho. As a member of the Oxford Book Association he had recently received advanced notice of a talk (Oct. 3rd, <<8 p.m|5>>.) by Dame Helen Gardner on The New Oxford Book of English Verse; and the prospect of hearing that distinguished Oxford academic was quite sufficient in itself to stir an idle Morse to his first attendance of the year. But, in addition, the Association\x{2019}s committee had appealed to all members for any old books that might be finished with, because before Dame Helen\x{2019}s talk a sale of secondhand books had been arranged in aid of the Association\x{2019}s languishing funds. The previous night, therefore, Morse had decimated his shelves, selecting those thirty or so paperbacks which now lay in a cardboard box in the boot of the Lancia. All books were to be delivered to the Clarendon Press Institute in Walton Street (where the Association held its meetings) between <<3 p.m.|5>> and <<5 p.m.|5>> that day.

            "THE RECENTLY FORMED Summertown Bridge Club had advertised itself (twice already in the Oxford Times and intermittently in the windows of the local newsagents) as the heaven-sent answer to those hundreds of residents in North Oxford who had played the game in the past with infinite enjoyment but with rather less than infinite finesse, and who were now a little reluctant to join one of the city\x{2019}s more prestigious clubs, where conversation invariably hinged on trump-coups and squeezes, where county players could always be expected round the tables, and where even the poorest performers appeared to have the enviable facility of remembering all the fifty-two cards at a time. The club was housed in Middle Way, a road of eminently desirable residences which runs parallel to the Banbury Road and to the west of it, linking Squitchey Lane with South Parade. Specifically, it was housed at a large white-walled residence, with light blue doors and shutters, some half-way down the road, where lived the chairman of the club (who also single-handedly fulfilled the functions of its secretary, treasurer, hostess, and general organizer), a gay and rather gaudy widow of some sixty-five summers who went by the incongruously youthful name of Gwendola Briggs and who greeted Detective Constable Walters effusively under the mistaken impression that she had a new \x{2013} and quite handsome \x{2013} recruit to a clientele that was predominantly (much too predominantly!) female. Never mind, though! A duly identified Walters was anxious, it seemed, to talk about the club, and Gwendola, as publicity agent, was more than glad to talk about it. Ms Scott (\x{2018}She wore a ring, though,\x{2019}) had been a member for about six months. She was quite a promising, serious-minded player (\x{2018}You can never play bridge flippantly, you know, Constable.\x{2019}), and her bidding was improving all the time. What a tragedy it all was! After a few years (who knows?) she might have developed into a very good player indeed. It was her actual playing of the cards that sometimes wasn\x{2019}t quite as sharp as . . . Still, that was neither here nor there, now, was it? As she\x{2019}d said, it was such a tragedy. Dear, oh dear! Who would ever have thought it? Such a surprise. No. She\x{2019}d no idea at all of what the trouble could have been. Tuesday was always their night, and poor Anne (\x{2018}Poor Anne!\x{2019}) had hardly ever missed. They started at <<about 8 p.m.|5>> and very often played through until way <<past midnight|13>> \x{2013} sometimes (the chairman almost smiled) until 3 or <<4 a.m.|5>> Sixteen to twenty of them, usually, although one quite disastrous night they\x{2019}d only had nine. (\x{2018}<<Nine|9k:0>>, Constable!\x{2019}). Anne had moved round the tables a bit, but (Gwendola was almost certain) she must have been playing the last rubber with Mrs Raven (\x{2018}The Ravens of Squitchey Lane, d\x{2019}you know them?\x{2019}), old Mr Parkes (\x{2018}Poor Mr Parkes!\x{2019}) from Woodstock Road, and young Miss Edgeley (\x{2018}Such a scatter-brain!\x{2019}) from Summertown House.",

            "As it happened Walters had been unusually unlucky that day. But life can sometimes be a cussed business, and even a policeman with a considerably greater endowment of nous than Walters possessed must hope for a few lucky breaks here and there. And, indeed, Walters was no one\x{2019}s fool. As he lay beside his young wife in Kidlington that night, there were several points that now appeared clear to him. Bell was quite right \x{2013} there was no doubt about it: the Scott woman had hanged herself, albeit for reasons as yet unapparent. But there were several fishy (fishy?) aspects about the affair. The bridge evening (evening?) had finally finished at <<about 2.45 a.m.|2a>>, and almost certainly Anne Scott had gone home shortly after that. How, though? Got a lift with someone? In a taxi? On a bicycle? (He\x{2019}d forgotten to put the point to the garish Gwendola.) And then something had gone sadly wrong. Time of death could not be firmly established, but the medical report suggested she had been dead at least ten hours before the police arrived, and that meant . . . But Walters wasn\x{2019}t quite sure what it meant. Then again there was the business of the front door being left open. Why? Had she forgotten to lock it? Unlikely, surely. Had someone else unlocked it, then? If so, the key on the inside must first have been removed. Wasn\x{2019}t that much more likely, though? He himself always took the key out of his own front door and placed it by the telephone on the hall table. Come to think of it, he wasn\x{2019}t quite sure why he did it. Just habit, perhaps. Three keys . . . Three keys . . . and one of them must have opened that door. And if it wasn\x{2019}t Anne Scott herself and if it wasn\x{2019}t Mrs Purvis . . . Jackson! What if Jackson had gone in, unlocking the door with his own key, called out for Ms Scott, heard no reply, and so walked through \x{2013} into the kitchen! Jackson would know all about that sticking door because he\x{2019}d been through it at least twice on each of the two previous days. And what if . . . what if he\x{2019}d . . . Yes! The chair must have been in the way and he would almost certainly have knocked it over as he pushed the door inwards . . . would probably have picked it up and placed it by the kitchen table before turning round and\x{2014} Phew! That would explain it all, wouldn\x{2019}t it? Well, most of it. Yet why, if that had happened, hadn\x{2019}t Jackson phoned the police immediately? There was a phone there, in number 9. Had Jackson felt guilty about something? Had there been something \x{2013} money, perhaps? \x{2013} in the kitchen that his greedy soul had coveted? It must have been something like that. Then, of course, there was that other mystery: Morse! For it must have been Morse whom Jackson had seen there that day. What on earth was he doing there earlier in the afternoon? Was he taking German lessons? Walters thought back to those oddly tentative, yet oddly searching questions that Morse had asked that night. \x{2018}Is she \x{2013} is she dead?\x{2019} Morse had asked him. Just a minute! How on earth . . .? Had one of the policemen outside mentioned who it was they\x{2019}d found? But no one could have done, for there was no one else who knew . . . Suddenly Walters shot bolt upright, jumped out of bed, slipped downstairs, and with fingers all thumbs, riffled through the telephone directory until he came to the M\x{2019}s. Rubbing his eyes with disbelief he stared again and again at the entry he\x{2019}d been looking for: \x{2018}Morse, E., 45 The Flats, Banbury Road\x{2019}. Morse! \x{2018}E.M.\x{2019}! Was it Morse who\x{2019}d been expected that afternoon? Steady on, though! There were a thousand and one other people with those initials \x{2013} of course there were. But Morse had been there that afternoon \x{2013} Walters was now quite sure in his own mind of that. It all fitted. Those questions he\x{2019}d asked about doors and locks and lights \x{2013} yes, he\x{2019}d been there, all right. Now if Morse had a key and if he, not Jackson, had found his way through into the kitchen . . . Why hadn\x{2019}t he reported it, then? Money wouldn\x{2019}t fit into the picture now, but what if somehow Morse had . . . what if Morse was frightened he might compromise himself in some strange way if he reported things immediately? He\x{2019}d rung later, of course \x{2013} that would have been his duty as a police officer . . . Walters returned to bed but could not sleep. He was conscious of his eyeballs darting about in their sockets, and it was in vain that he tried to focus them on some imaginary point about six inches in front of his nose. Only in the early hours did he finally drift off into a disturbed sleep, and the most disturbing thought of all was what, if anything, he was to say to Chief Inspector Bell in the morning.",

            "SUNDAY WORKING WAS nothing particularly unusual for Bell, but as he sat in his office the following afternoon he knew that he would have been more gainfully employed if he had stayed at home to rake the autumn leaves from his neglected lawn. Reports were still filtering through to him, but there seemed little prospect of any immediate break in the case. After the initial spurt of blood and splurge of publicity, the murder of George Jackson was stirring no ripples of any cosmic concern. Apart from a few far-flung cousins, the man had left behind him neither any immediate family nor any traceable wake of affection. To those who had known him vaguely, he had been a mean and unloved little man, and to the police the manner of his death had hardly risen to the heights of inglorious wickedness. Yet several facts were fairly clear to Bell. Someone had managed to get into number 10 between <<half past eight|10>> and <<nine that Friday evening|5>>, had probably argued with Jackson in a comparatively pacific way, then threatened and physically intimidated the man, and finally \x{2013} accidentally or deliberately \x{2013} cracked his thinly boned skull against the bed-post in his bedroom. The evidence strongly suggested, too, that Jackson\x{2019}s visitor had been looking for something specific, since the contents of all the drawers and cupboards in the house had been methodically and neatly examined; only in the bedroom were there the signs of frenetic haste and agitation. But of the identity of this visitor, or of the object of his quest, the police as yet had no real ideas at all. No one in the Reach or in the neighbouring streets appeared either to have seen or heard anything or anyone suspicious, and the truth was that only the sudden and disastrous blowing of a TV valve would have caused the majority of Jackson\x{2019}s fellow citizens to look out into the darkened streets that night: for from <<8.30|5a:1>> to <<10.30 p.m.|2a>> that evening, viewing all over Britain was monopolized by the Miss World Competition.

            "AS HE DROVE back to Oxford that lunch-time, Morse thought about Celia Richards. She had told her tale with a courageous honesty and Morse had no doubt whatsoever that it was true. During her husband\x{2019}s earlier liaisons with Anne Scott, Celia had no shred of evidence to corroborate her suspicions, although there had been (she knew) much whispered rumour in the company. She could have been mistaken \x{2013} or so she\x{2019}d told herself repeatedly; and when Anne left she had felt gradually more reassured. At the very least, whatever there might have been between the pair of them had gone for good now \x{2013} surely! Until, that is, that terrible day only a few weeks earlier when, with Charles confined to bed with \x{2019}flu, she had gone into the office to see Conrad, Charles\x{2019}s younger brother and co-partner, who worked on the floor above him. On Charles\x{2019}s desk, beneath a heavy glass paperweight, lay a letter, a letter written in a hand that was known to her, a letter marked \x{2018}Strictly Personal and Private\x{2019}. And even at that very moment she had known, deep inside herself, the hurtful, heart-piercing truth of it all, and she had taken the letter and opened it in her car outside. It was immediately clear that Charles had already seen Anne Scott several times since the move to Abingdon, and the letter begged him to go to see her again \x{2013} quickly, urgently. Anne was in some desperate sort of trouble and he, Charles, was the only person she could turn to. Money was involved \x{2013} and this was stated quite explicitly; but above all she had to see him again. She had kept (she claimed) all the letters he had written to her, and suggested that if he didn\x{2019}t do as she wished she might have (as far as Celia could recall the exact words) \x{2018}to do something off her own bat which would hurt him\x{2019}. She hated herself for doing it, but if threats were the only way, then threats it had to be. Celia had destroyed the letter \x{2013} and taken her decision immediately: she herself would go to visit her husband\x{2019}s former lover. And she had done so. On Wednesday, 3rd October, Charles said he had a meeting and had taken the Mini to work, telling her not to expect him home before <<about 6.30 p.m.|2a>> The Rolls had been almost impossible to park \x{2013} even the double yellow lines were taken up; but finally she had found a space and had walked up Canal Reach, up to number 9, where she found the door unlocked. (\x{2018}Yes, Inspector, I\x{2019}m absolutely sure. I had no key \x{2013} and how else could I have got in?\x{2019}) Inside, there was no one. She had shouted. No one. Upstairs she had found the study immediately, and within a few minutes found, too, a pile of letters tied together in one of the drawers \x{2013} all written to Anne by Charles. Somehow up until that point, she had felt an aggression and a purpose which had swamped all fears of discovery. But now she felt suddenly frightened \x{2013} and then, oh God! the next two minutes were an unbearable nightmare. For someone had come in; had shouted Anne\x{2019}s name; had even stood at the foot of the stairs! Never in the whole of her life had she felt so petrified with fear!",

For much of the time as he lay there he was thinking of his wife, and wondering sadly why it was that now, when she was willing to let him go, his thoughts kept drifting back to her. She had not cried or created any scene when at last the truth of his relations with Anne Scott had been forced into the open. But her eyes had betrayed her hurt and disappointment, and a hardness that made her face seem older and plainer; yet later she had looked so tender and so very vulnerable that he had almost found himself falling in love with her afresh. She had said little, apart from a few practical suggestions about the days immediately ahead: she was proud and wounded. He wondered where exactly she was at that moment.
