            '(1) Begin by counting up the frequencies of all the letters in the ciphertext. <<About five|9:0>> of the letters should have a frequency of less than 1 per cent, and these probably represent j, k, q, x and z. One of the letters should have a frequency greater than 10 per cent, and it probably represents e. If the ciphertext does not obey this distribution of frequencies, then consider the possibility that the original message was not written in English. You can identify the language by analyzing the distribution of frequencies in the ciphertext. For example, typically in Italian there are three letters with a frequency greater than 10 per cent, and nine letters have frequencies less than 1 per cent. In German, the letter e has the extraordinarily high frequency of 19 per cent, so any ciphertext containing one letter with such a high frequency is quite possibly German. Once you have identified the language you should use the appropriate table of frequencies for that language for your frequency analysis. It is often possible to unscramble ciphertexts in an unfamiliar language, as long as you have the appropriate frequency table.',

In England, Sir Charles Wheatstone and William Fothergill Cooke built detectors from magnetized needles, which would be deflected in the presence of an incoming electric current. By <<1839|9:1>>, the Wheatstone-Cooke system was being used to send messages between railway stations in West Drayton and Paddington, a distance of 29 km. The reputation of the telegraph and its remarkable speed of communication soon spread, and nothing did more to popularize its power than the birth of Queen Victoria\x{2019}s second son, Prince Alfred, at Windsor on August 6, 1844. News of the birth was telegraphed to London, and within the hour The Times was on the streets announcing the news.

Although a warehouse fire destroyed most of the pamphlets, those that survived caused quite a stir in Lynchburg. Among the most ardent treasure hunters attracted to the Beale ciphers were the Hart brothers, George and Clayton. For years they pored over the two remaining ciphers, mounting various forms of cryptanalytic attack, occasionally fooling themselves into believing that they had a solution. A false line of attack will sometimes generate a few tantalizing words within a sea of gibberish, which then encourages the cryptanalyst to devise a series of caveats to excuse the gibberish. To an unbiased observer the decipherment is clearly nothing more than wishful thinking, but to the blinkered treasure hunter it makes complete sense. One of the Harts\x{2019} tentative decipherments encouraged them to use dynamite to excavate a particular site; unfortunately, the resulting crater yielded no gold. Although Clayton Hart gave up in 1912, George continued working on the Beale ciphers until <<1952|9c:0>>. An even more persistent Beale fanatic has been Hiram Herbert, Jr., who first became interested in 1923 and whose obsession continued right through to the 1970s.

Viemeister began by asking if there was any evidence that Thomas Beale actually existed.

Viemeister has also attempted to corroborate the other details in the pamphlet, such as Beale\x{2019}s trip to Santa Fe and his discovery of gold.

            "Interest increased still further when Marconi shattered the myth that radio communication was limited by the horizon. Critics had argued that because radio waves could not bend and follow the curvature of the Earth, radio communication would be limited to a hundred kilometers or so. Marconi attempted to prove them wrong by sending a message from Poldhu in Cornwall to St. John\x{2019}s in Newfoundland, a distance of 3,500 km. In December 1901, for three hours each day, the Poldhu transmitter sent the letter S (dot-dot-dot) over and over again, while Marconi stood on the windy cliffs of Newfoundland trying to detect the radio waves. Day after day, he wrestled to raise aloft a giant kite, which in turn hoisted his antenna high into the air. <<A little after midday|13>> on December 12, Marconi detected three faint dots, the first transatlantic radio message. The explanation of Marconi\x{2019}s achievement remained a mystery until <<1924|9c:0>>, when physicists discovered the ionosphere, a layer of the atmosphere whose lower boundary is about 60 km above the Earth. The ionosphere acts as a mirror, allowing radio waves to bounce off it. Radio waves also bounce off the Earth\x{2019}s surface, so radio messages could effectively reach anywhere in the world after a series of reflections between the ionosphere and the Earth.",

Not until <<1916|18:0>> did they set up the Abhorchdienst, an organization devoted to intercepting Allied messages. Part of the reason for their tardiness in establishing the Abhorchdienst was that the German army had advanced into French territory in the early phase of the war. The French, as they retreated, destroyed the landlines, forcing the advancing Germans to rely on radios for communication. While this gave the French a continuous supply of German intercepts, the opposite was not true. As the French were retreating back into their own territory, they still had access to their own landlines, and had no need to communicate by radio. With a lack of French radio communication, the Germans could not make many interceptions, and hence they did not bother to develop their cryptanalytic department until two years into the war.',

Enigma was a mechanical cipher, and the Biuro Szyfr\x{f3}w reasoned that a more scientific mind might stand a better chance of breaking it. The Biuro organized a course on cryptography and invited twenty mathematicians, each of them sworn to an oath of secrecy. The mathematicians were all from the university at Pozn\x{e1}n.

For example, experience showed that the Germans sent a regular enciphered weather report <<shortly after 6 A.M.|5>> each day. So, an encrypted message intercepted at <<6:05 A.M.|2a>> would be almost certain to contain wetter, the German word for \x{201c}weather.\x{201d} The rigorous protocol used by any military organization meant that such messages were highly regimented in style, so Turing could even be confident about the location of wetter within the encrypted message.

Rivest, unable to sleep, lay on his couch reading a mathematics textbook. He began mulling over the question that had been puzzling him for weeks\x{2014}is it possible to build an asymmetric cipher? Is it possible to find a one-way function that can be reversed only if the receiver has some special information? Suddenly, the mists began to clear and he had a revelation. He spent the rest of that night formalizing his idea, effectively writing a complete scientific paper before daybreak. Rivest had made a breakthrough, but it had grown out of a yearlong collaboration with Shamir and Adleman, and it would not have been possible without them. Rivest finished off the paper by listing the authors alphabetically; Adleman, Rivest, Shamir.",

            "This is not a very high level of security, but Bob could have chosen much larger prime numbers and increased the security of his private key. For example, he could have chosen primes that are as big as 10 (this means 1 followed by 65 zeros, or one hundred thousand, million, million, million, million, million, million, million, million, million, million). This would have resulted in a value for N that would have been roughly 10 \x{d7} 10, which is <<10|9c:0>>. A computer could multiply the two primes and generate N in just a second, but if Eve wanted to reverse the process and work out p and q, it would take inordinately longer. Exactly how long depends on the speed of Eve\x{2019}s computer. Security expert Simson Garfinkel estimated that a 100 MHz Intel Pentium computer with 8 MB of RAM would take roughly 50 years to factor a number as big as 10. Cryptographers tend to have a paranoid streak and consider worst-case scenarios, such as a worldwide conspiracy to crack their ciphers. So, Garfinkel considered what would happen if a hundred million personal computers (the number sold in 1995) ganged up together. The result is that a number as big as 10 could be factored in about 15 seconds. Consequently, it is now generally accepted that for genuine security it is necessary to use even larger primes. For important banking transactions, N tends to be at least 10, which is ten million billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion times bigger than 10. The combined efforts of a hundred million personal computers would take more than one thousand years to crack such a cipher. With sufficiently large values of p and q, RSA is impregnable.",

For example, the two types of computer could tackle the problem of finding a number whose square and cube together use all the digits from <<0|20b>> to <<9|20a>> once and only once. If we test the number 19, we find that 19 = 361 and 19 = 6,859. The number 19 does not fit the requirement because its square and cube include only the digits: 1, 3, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, i.e., the digits 0, 2, 4, 7 are missing and the digit 6 is repeated.',
