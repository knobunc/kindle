scholar, as far as I know, had collected all the railway references and laid
them out for inspection. So, since this last chronicle of Blandings adds one
last train to the time-table, I have brought them all together. It was not
difficult, only laborious. But interpreting the references was beyond me. I
could see no pattern, if any existed, in the times and speeds. I could see one
obvious anomaly. In Leave it to Psmith, Psmith says it\x{2019}s roughly a
four-hour journey either way. But, elsewhere in the same book, the narrative
says that the 1250 from Paddington arrived at Market Blandings \x{2018}<<about 3 o\x{2019}clock|6>>\x{2019}
(1500). My guess is now that that \x{2018}3\x{2019} was originally a misprint for \x{2018}5\x{2019} and has
persisted uncorrected through half a century of editions. Otherwise we have a

one railway fact \x{2014} that it is generally a 4-hour journey from Paddington (1923),

above three areas. Bradshaw shows that the through trains only stop at
Wellington (under 3 hours from Paddington) and, excluding Shrewsbury itself,
Gobowen (about <<3 hours 40 minutes|14>>) . This latter puts Blandings Castle eight
miles from the Severn, which means that the river could hardly flow \x{2018}through
its grounds\x{2019} (though it might flow through its land, but that is not the same
thing) . It also puts the castle in the suburbs of Oswestry. This is so

America with Haverley\x{2019}s Minstrels. They sold the club to William Dudley Ward,
father of the Member of Parliament for Southampton (1906-1922). Dudley Ward
