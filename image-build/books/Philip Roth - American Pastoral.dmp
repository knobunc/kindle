            "Carolina\x{2014}where the scuttlebutt was that the marines were to hit the Japanese 
 beaches on March 1, 1946\x{2014}when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. As a 
 result, the Swede got to spend the rest of his hitch as a \x{201c}recreation 
 specialist\x{201d} right there on Parris Island. He ran the calisthenic drill for his 
 battalion for half an hour before breakfast every morning, arranged for the 
 boxing smokers to entertain the recruits a couple of nights a week, and the bulk 
 of the time played for the base team against armed forces teams throughout the 
 South, basketball all winter long, baseball all summer long. He was stationed 
 down in South Carolina about a year when he became engaged to an Irish Catholic 
 girl whose father, a marine major and a one-time Purdue football coach, had 
 procured him the cushy job as drill instructor in order to keep him at Parris 
 Island to play ball. Several months before the Swede\x{2019}s 



 discharge, his own father made a trip to Parris Island, stayed for a full week, 
 near the base at the hotel in Beaufort, and departed only when the engagement to 
 Miss Dunleavy had been broken off. The Swede returned home in \x{2018}47 to enroll at 
 Upsala College, in East Orange, at twenty unencumbered by a Gentile wife and all 
 the more glamorously heroic for having made his mark as a Jewish marine\x{2014}a drill 
 instructor no less, and at arguably the crudest military training camp anywhere 
 in the world. Marines are made at boot camp, and Seymour Irving Levov had helped 
 to make them. 

 We knew all this because the mystique of the Swede lived on in the corridors and 
 classrooms of the high school, where I was by then a student. I remember two or 
 three times one spring trekking out with friends to Viking Field in East Orange 
 to watch the Upsala baseball team play a Saturday home game. Their star cleanup 
 hitter and first baseman was the Swede. Three home runs one day against 
 Muhlenberg. Whenever we saw a man in the stands wearing a suit and a hat we 
 would whisper to one another, \x{201c}A scout, a scout!\x{201d} I was away at college when I 
 heard from a schoolyard pal still living in the neighborhood that the Swede had 
 been offered a contract with a Double A Giant farm club but had turned it down 
 to join his father\x{2019}s company instead. Later I learned through my parents about 
 the Swede\x{2019}s marriage to Miss New Jersey. Before competing at Atlantic City for 
 the 1949 Miss America title, she had been Miss Union County, and before that 
 Spring Queen at Upsala. From Elizabeth. A shiksa. Dawn Dwyer. He\x{2019}d done it. 

 One night in the summer of 1985, while visiting New York, I went out to see the 
 Mets play the Astros, and while circling the stadium with my friends, looking 
 for the gate to our seats, I saw the Swede, thirty-six years older than when I\x{2019}d 
 watched him play ball for Upsala. He wore a white shirt, a striped tie, and a 
 charcoal-gray summer suit, and he was still terrifically handsome. The golden 
 hair was a shade or two darker but not any thinner; no longer was it cut short 
 but fell rather fully over his ears and down to his collar.

 In this suit that fit him so exquisitely he seemed even taller and leaner than I 
 remembered him in the uniform of one sport or another. The woman with us noticed 
 him first. \x{201d} Who is that? That\x{2019}s\x{2014} that\x{2019}s \x{2026} Is that John Lindsay?\x{201d} she asked. 
 \x{201c}No,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}My God. You know who that is? It\x{2019}s Swede Levov.\x{201d} I told my 
 friends, \x{201c}That\x{2019}s the Swede!\x{201d} 

 A skinny, fair-haired boy of about seven or eight was walking alongside the 
 Swede, a kid under a Mets cap pounding away at a first baseman\x{2019}s mitt that 
 dangled, as had the Swede\x{2019}s, from his left hand. The <<two|9k:0>>, clearly a father and 
 his son, were laughing about something together when I approached and introduced 
 myself. \x{201c}I knew your brother at Weequahic.\x{201d}

            "\x{201c}Taxes, corruption, and race. My old man\x{2019}s litany. Anybody at all, people from 
 all over the country who couldn\x{2019}t care less about the fate of Newark, made no 
 difference to him\x{2014}whether it was down in Miami Beach at the condo, on a cruise 
 ship in the Caribbean, they\x{2019}d get an earful about his beloved old Newark, 
 butchered to death by taxes, corruption, and race. My father was one of those 
 Prince Street guys who loved that city all his life. What happened to Newark 
 broke his heart. 

 \x{201c}It\x{2019}s the worst city in the world, Skip,\x{201d} the Swede was telling me. \x{201c}Used to be 
 the city where they manufactured everything. Now it\x{2019}s the car-theft capital of 
 the world. Did you know that? Not the most gruesome of the gruesome developments 
 but it\x{2019}s awful enough. The thieves live mostly in our old neighborhood. Black 
 kids. Forty cars stolen in Newark every twenty-four hours. That\x{2019}s the statistic. 



 Something, isn\x{2019}t it? And they\x{2019}re murder weapons\x{2014}once they\x{2019}re stolen, they\x{2019}re 
 flying missiles. The target is anybody in the street\x{2014} old people, toddlers, 
 doesn\x{2019}t matter. Out in front of our factory was the Indianapolis Speedway to 
 them. That\x{2019}s another reason we left. <<Four|9k:0>>, five kids drooping out the windows, 
 eighty miles an hour\x{2014} right on Central Avenue. When my father bought the 
 factory, there were trolley cars on Central Avenue. Further down were the auto 
 showrooms. Central Cadillac. LaSalle. There was a factory where somebody was 
 making something in every side street. Now there\x{2019}s a liquor store in every 
 street\x{2014}a liquor store, a pizza stand, and a seedy storefront church. Everything 
 else in ruins or boarded up. But when my father bought the factory, a stone\x{2019}s 
 throw away Kiler made watercoolers, Fortgang made fire alarms, Lasky made 
 corsets, Robbins made pillows, Honig made pen points\x{2014}Christ, I sound like my 
 father. But he was right\x{2014}\x{2019}The joint\x{2019}s jumpin\x{2019},\x{2019} he used to say. The major 
 industry now is car theft. Sit at a light in Newark, anywhere in Newark, and all 
 you\x{2019}re doing is looking around you. Bergen near Lyons is where I got rammed. 
 Remember Henry\x{2019}s, \x{2018}the Sweet Shop,\x{2019} next to the Park Theater? Well, right there, 
 where Henry\x{2019}s used to be. Took my first high school date to Henry\x{2019}s for a soda. 
 In a booth there. Arlene Danziger. Took her for a black-and-white soda after the 
 movie. But a black-and-white doesn\x{2019}t mean a soda anymore on Bergen Street. It 
 means the worst kind of hatred in the world. A car coming the wrong way on a 
 one-way street and they ram me. Four kids drooping out the windows. Two of them 
 get out, laughing, joking, and point a gun at my head. I hand over the keys and 
 one of them takes off in my car. Right in front of what used to be Henry\x{2019}s. It\x{2019}s 
 something horrible. They ram cop cars in broad daylight. Front-end collisions. 
 To explode the air bags. Doughnuting. Heard of doughnuting? Doing doughnuts? You 
 haven\x{2019}t heard about this? This is what they steal the cars for. Top speed, they 
 slam on the brakes, yank the emergency brake, twist the steering wheel, and the 
 car starts spinning. Wheeling the car in circles at tremendous speeds. Killing 
 pedestrians means nothing to them. Killing motorists means nothing to them. 
 Killing themselves 



 means nothing to them. The skid marks are enough to frighten you. They killed a 
 woman right out in front of our place, same week my car was stolen. Doing a 
 doughnut. I witnessed this. I was leaving for the day. Tremendous speed. The car 
 groaning. Ungodly screeching. It was terrifying. It made my blood run cold. Just 
 driving her own car out of 2nd Street, and this woman, young black woman, gets 
 it. Mother of three kids. Two days later it\x{2019}s one of my own employees. A black 
 guy. But they don\x{2019}t care, black, white doesn\x{2019}t matter to them. They\x{2019}ll kill 
 anyone. Fellow named Clark Tyler, my shipping guy\x{2014}all he\x{2019}s doing is pulling out 
 of our lot to go home. Twelve hours of surgery, four months in a hospital. 
 Permanent disability. Head injuries, internal injuries, broken pelvis, broken 
 shoulder, fractured spine. A high-speed chase, crazy kid in a stolen car and the 
 cops are chasing him, and the kid plows right into him, crushes the driver\x{2019}s-
 side door, and that\x{2019}s it for Clark. Eighty miles an hour down Central Avenue.

 Newark Maid manufactured now exclusively in Puerto Rico. For a while, after 
 leaving Newark, he\x{2019}d contracted with the Communist government in Czechoslovakia 
 and divided the work between his own factory in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and a Czech 
 glove factory in Brno. However, when a plant that suited him went up for sale in 
 Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, over near Mayagiiez, he\x{2019}d bailed out on the Czechs, 
 whose bureaucracy had been irritating from the start, and unified his 
 manufacturing operation by purchasing a second Puerto Rico facility, another 
 good-sized factory, moved in the machinery, started a training program, and 
 hired an additional three hundred people. By the eighties, though, even Puerto 
 Rico began to grow expensive and about everybody but Newark Maid fled to 
 wherever in the Far East the labor force was abundant and cheap, to the 
 Philippines first, then Korea and Taiwan, and now to China.

 Even baseball gloves, the most American glove of all, which used to be made by 
 friends of his father\x{2019}s, the Denkerts up in Johnstown, New York, for a long time 
 now had been manufactured in Korea. When the first guy left Gloversville, New 
 York, in \x{2018}52 or \x{2018}53 and went to the Philippines to make gloves, they laughed at 
 him, as though he were going to the moon. But when he died, around 1978, he had 
 a factory there with four thousand workers and the whole industry had gone 
 essentially from Gloversville to the Philippines. Up in Gloversville, when the 
 Second World War began, there must have been ninety glove factories, big and 
 small. Today there isn\x{2019}t a one\x{2014}all of them out of business or importers from 
 abroad, \x{201c}people who don\x{2019}t know a fourchette from a thumb,\x{201d} the Swede said. 
 \x{201c}They\x{2019}re business people, they know if they need a hundred thousand pair of this 
 and two hundred thousand pair of that in so many colors and so many sizes, but 
 they don\x{2019}t know the details on how to get it done.\x{201d} \x{201c}What\x{2019}s a fourchette?\x{201d} I 
 asked. \x{201c}The part of the glove between the fingers. Those small oblong pieces 
 between the fingers, they\x{2019}re die-cut along with the thumbs\x{2014}those are the 
 fourchettes. Today you\x{2019}ve got a lot of underqualified people, probably don\x{2019}t 
 know half what I knew when I was five, and they\x{2019}re making some pretty big 
 decisions. A guy buying deerskin, which can run up to maybe three dollars and 
 fifty cents a foot for a garment grade, he\x{2019}s buying this fine garment-grade 
 deerskin to cut a little palm patch to go on a pair of ski gloves. I talked to 
 him just the other day. A novelty part, runs about five inches by one inch, and 
 he pays <<three fifty|5k:1>> a foot where he could have paid a dollar fifty a foot and 
 come out a long, long ways ahead. You multiply this over a large order, you\x{2019}re 
 talking a hundred-thousand-dollar mistake, and he never knew it. He could have 
 put a hundred grand in his pocket.\x{201d} 

 The Swede found himself hanging on in P.R., he explained, the way he had hung on 
 in Newark, in large part because he had trained a lot of good people to do the 
 intricate work of making a glove carefully and meticulously, people who could 
 give him what Newark Maid had demanded in quality going back to his father\x{2019}s 



 days; but also, he had to admit, staying on because his family so much enjoyed 
 the vacation home he\x{2019}d built some fifteen years ago on the Caribbean coast, not 
 very far from the Ponce plant. The life the kids lived there they just loved \x{2026} 
 and off he went again, Kent, Chris, Steve, water-skiing, sailing, scuba diving, 
 catamaraning \x{2026} and though it was clear from all he had just been telling me 
 that this guy could be engaging if he wanted to be, he didn\x{2019}t appear to have any 
 judgment at all as to what was and wasn\x{2019}t interesting about his world. Or, for 
 reasons I couldn\x{2019}t understand, he didn\x{2019}t want his world to be interesting. I 
 would have given anything to get him back to Kiler, Fortgang, Lasky, Robbins,",

            "and Honig, back to the fourchettes and the details of how to get a good glove 
 done, even back to the guy who\x{2019}d paid <<three fifty|5k:1>> a foot for the wrong grade of 
 deerskin for a novelty part, but once he was off and running there was no civil 
 way I could find to shift his focus for a second time from the achievements of 
 his boys on land and sea. 

 While we waited for dessert, the Swede let pass that he was indulging himself in 
 a fattening zabaglione on top of the ziti only because, after having had his 
 prostate removed a couple of months back, he was still some ten pounds 
 underweight. 

 \x{201c}The operation went okay?\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}Just fine,\x{201d} he replied. 

 \x{201c}A couple friends of mine,\x{201d} I said, \x{201c}didn\x{2019}t emerge from that surgery as they\x{2019}d 
 hoped to. That operation can be a real catastrophe for a man, even if they get 
 the cancer out.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}Yes, that happens, I know.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}One wound up impotent,\x{201d} I said. \x{201c}The other\x{2019}s impotent and incontinent. Fellows 
 my age. It\x{2019}s been rough for them. Desolating. It can leave you in diapers.\x{201d} 

 The person I had referred to as \x{201c}the other\x{201d} was me. I\x{2019}d had the surgery in 
 Boston, and\x{2014}except for confiding in a Boston friend who had helped me through 
 the ordeal till I was back on my feet\x{2014}when I returned to the house where I live 
 alone, two and a half hours west of Boston, in the Berkshires, I had thought it 
 best to

 keep to myself both the fact that I\x{2019}d had cancer and the ways it had left me 
 impaired. 

 \x{201c}Well,\x{201d} said the Swede, \x{201c}I got off easy, I guess.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}I\x{2019}d say you did,\x{201d} I replied amiably enough, thinking that this big jeroboam of 
 self-contentment really was in possession of all he ever had wanted. To respect 
 everything one is supposed to respect; to protest nothing; never to be 
 inconvenienced by self-distrust; never to be enmeshed in obsession, tortured by 
 incapacity, poisoned by resentment, driven by anger \x{2026} life just unraveling 
 for the Swede like a fluffy ball of yarn. 

 This line of thinking brought me back to his letter, his request for 
 professional advice about the tribute to his father that he was trying to write. 
 I wasn\x{2019}t myself going to bring up the tribute, and yet the pilzzle remained not 
 only as to why he didn\x{2019}t but as to why, if he didn\x{2019}t, he had written me about it 
 in the first place. I could only conclude\x{2014}given what I now knew of this life 
 neither overly rich in contrasts nor troubled too much by contradiction\x{2014}that the 
 letter and its contents had to do with the operation, with something 
 uncharacteristic that arose in him afterward, some surprising new emotion that 
 had come to the fore. Yes, I thought, the letter grew out of Swede Levov\x{2019}s 
 belated discovery of what it means to be not healthy but sick, to be not strong 
 but weak; what it means to not look great\x{2014}what physical shame is, what 
 humiliation is, what the gruesome is, what extinction is, what it is like to ask 
 \x{201c}Why?\x{201d} Betrayed all at once by a wonderful body that had furnished him only with 
 assurance and had constituted the bulk of his advantage over others, he had 
 momentarily lost his equilibrium and had clutched at me, of all people, as a 
 means of grasping his dead father and calling up the father\x{2019}s power to protect 
 him. For a moment his nerve was shattered, and this man who, as far as I could",

            "Maybe I was and had asked the question out of mischief, to alleviate the 
 boredom. Yet I did happen to be remembering that line the Swede had written me 
 about how much his father \x{201c}suffered because of the shocks that befell his loved 
 ones,\x{201d} which led me to wondering again what he\x{2019}d been alluding to, which 
 spontaneously reminded me of the humiliation Jerry had brought upon himself in 
 our junior year of high school when he attempted to win the heart of a 
 strikingly unexceptional girl in our class who you wouldn\x{2019}t have thought 
 required a production to get her to kiss you. 

 As a Valentine present, Jerry made a coat for her out of hamster skins, a 
 hundred and seventy-five hamster skins that he cured in the sun and then sewed 
 together with a curved sewing needle pilfered from his father\x{2019}s factory, where 
 the idea dawned on him. The high school biology department had been given a gift 
 of some three hundred hamsters for the purpose of dissection, and Jerry 
 diligently finagled to collect the skins from the biology students; his oddness 
 and his genius made credible the story he told about \x{201c}a 



 scientific experiment\x{201d} he was conducting at home. He finagled next to find out 
 the girl\x{2019}s height, he designed a pattern, and then, after he got most of the 
 stink out of the hides\x{2014}or thought he had\x{2014}by drying them in the sun on the roof 
 of his garage, he meticulously sewed the skins together, finishing the coat off 
 with a silk lining made out of a section of a white parachute, an imperfect 
 parachute his brother had sent home to him as a memento from the marine air base 
 in Cherry Point, North Carolina, where the Parris Island team won the last game 
 of the season for the Marine Corps baseball championship. The only person Jerry 
 told about the coat was me, the Ping-Pong stooge. He was going to send it to the 
 girl in a Bamberger\x{2019}s coat box of his mother\x{2019}s, wrapped in lavender tissue paper 
 and tied with velvet ribbon. But when the coat was finished, it was so stiff\x{2014}
 because of the idiotic way he\x{2019}d dried the skins, his father would later explain\x{2014}
 that he couldn\x{2019}t get it to fold up in the box. 

 Across from the Swede in Vincent\x{2019}s restaurant, I suddenly recalled seeing it in 
 the basement: this big thing sitting on the floor with sleeves. Today, I was 
 thinking, it would win all kinds of prizes at the Whitney Museum, but back in 
 Newark in 1949 nobody knew dick about what great art was and Jerry and I racked 
 our brains trying to figure out what he could do to get the coat into the box. 
 He was set on that box because she would think, when she began to open it, that 
 it contained an expensive coat from Barn\x{2019}s. I was thinking of what she would 
 think when she saw that wasn\x{2019}t what it contained; I was thinking that surely it 
 didn\x{2019}t take such hard work to gain the attention of a chubby girl with bad skin 
 and no boyfriend. But I cooperated with Jerry because he had a cyclonic 
 personality you either fled or yielded to and because he was Swede Levov\x{2019}s 
 brother and I was in Swede Levov\x{2019}s house and everywhere you looked were Swede 
 Levov\x{2019}s trophies. Eventually Jerry tore the entire coat apart and resewed it so 
 that the stitching lay straight across the chest, creating a hinge of sorts 
 where the coat could be bent and placed in the box. I helped him\x{2014}it was like 
 sewing a suit of armor. Atop the coat he placed a heart that he cut out of card- 



 board and painted his name on in Gothic letters, and the package was sent parcel 
 post. It had taken him three months to transform an improbable idea into nutty 
 reality. Brief by human standards. 

 She screamed when she opened the box. \x{201c}She had a fit,\x{201d} her girlfriends said. 
 Jerry\x{2019}s father also had a fit. \x{201c}This is what you do with the parachute your 
 brother sent you? You cut it up? You cut up a parachute?\x{201d} Jerry was too 
 humiliated to tell him that it was to get the girl to fall into his arms and 
 kiss him the way Lana Turner kissed Clark Gable. I happened to be there when his 
 father went after him for curing the skins in the <<midday|13>> sun. \x{201c}A skin must be",

 you: has the immersion ever again been so complete as it was in those streets,

 walls, ceilings, doors, and windows of every last friend\x{2019}s family apartment\x{2014}came 
 to be so absolutely individualized? Were we ever again to be such keen recording 
 instruments of the microscopic surface of things close at hand, of the minutest 
 gradations of social position conveyed by linoleum and oilcloth, by yahrzeit 
 candles and cooking smells, by Ronson table lighters and Venetian blinds? About 
 one another, we knew who had what kind of lunch in the bag in his locker and who 
 ordered what on his hot dog at Syd\x{2019}s; we knew one another\x{2019}s every physical 
 attribute\x{2014} who walked pigeon-toed and who had breasts, who smelled of hair oil 
 and who oversalivated when he spoke; we knew who among us was belligerent and 
 who was friendly, who was smart and who was dumb; we knew whose mother had the 
 accent and whose father had the mustache, whose mother worked and whose father 
 was dead; somehow we even dimly grasped how every family\x{2019}s different set of 
 circumstances set each family a distinctive difficult human problem. 

 And, of course, there was the mandatory turbulence 
 born of need, appetite, fantasy, longing, and the fear of 
 disgrace. With only adolescent introspection to light the 
 way, each of us, hopelessly pubescent, alone and in secret, 
 attempted to regulate it\x{2014}and in an era when chastity 
 was still ascendant, a national cause to be embraced by the 
 young like freedom and democracy.

 It\x{2019}s astonishing that everything so immediately visible in our lives as 
 classmates we still remember so precisely. The intensity of feeling that we have 
 seeing one another today is also astonishing. But most astonishing is that we 
 are near-ing the age that our grandparents were when we first went off to be 
 freshmen at the annex on February 1,1946. What is astonishing is that we, who 
 had no idea how anything was going to turn out, now know exactly what happened. 
 That the results are in for the class of January 1950\x{2014}the unanswerable questions 
 answered, the future revealed\x{2014}is that not astonishing? To have lived\x{2014}and in this 
 country, and in our time, and as who we were. Astonishing. 

 This is the speech I didn\x{2019}t give at my forty-fifth high school reunion, a speech 
 to myself masked as a speech to them. I began to compose it only after the 
 reunion, in the dark, in bed, groping to understand what had hit me. The tone\x{2014}
 too ruminative for a country club ballroom and the sort of good time people were 
 looking for there\x{2014}didn\x{2019}t seem at all ill-conceived between <<three|90>> and <<six a.m.|5>>, 
 as I tried, in my overstimulated state, to comprehend the union underlying the 
 reunion, the common experience that had joined us as kids. Despite gradations of

 exclusions the goyim still wished to preserve. And out of what context did these 
 transformations arise\x{2014}out of what historical drama, acted unsuspectingly by its

 and their answers in my bed\x{2014}blurry, insomniac shadows of these questions and 
 their answers\x{2014}some eight hours after I\x{2019}d driven back from New Jersey, where, on 
 a sunny Sunday late in October, at a country club in a Jewish suburb far from 
 the futility prevailing in the streets of our crime-ridden, drug-infested 
 childhood home, the reunion that began at <<eleven in the morning|5>> went ebulliently 
 on all afternoon long. It was held in a ballroom just at the edge of the country 
 club\x{2019}s golf course for a group of elderly adults who, as Weequahic kids of the 
 thirties and forties, would have thought a niblick (which was what in those days 
 they called the nine iron) was a hunk of schmaltz herring. Now I couldn\x{2019}t sleep\x{2014}
 the last thing I could remember was the parking valet bringing my car around to 
 the steps of the portico, and the reunion\x{2019}s commander in chief, Selma Bresloff, 
 kindly asking if I\x{2019}d had a good time, and my telling her, \x{201c}It\x{2019}s like going out 
 to your old outfit after Iwo Jima.\x{201d} 

 <<Around three a.m.|9h>>, I left my bed and went to my desk, my head vibrant with the 
 static of unelaborated thought. I wound up working there until <<six|9b>>, by which 
 time I had got the reunion speech to read as it appears above. Only after I had 
 built to the emotional peroration culminating in the word \x{201c}astonishing\x{201d} was I at 
 last sufficiently unastonished by the force of my feelings to be able to put 
 together a couple of hours of sleep\x{2014}or something resembling sleep, for, even 
 half out of it, I was a biography in perpetual motion, memory to the marrow of 
 my bones. 

 Yes, even from as benign a celebration as a high school reunion it\x{2019}s not so 
 simple to instantaneously resume existence back behind the blindfold of 
 continuity and routine. Perhaps if I were thirty or forty, the reunion would 
 have faded sweetly away in the three hours it took me to drive home. But there 
 is no easy mastery of such events at sixty-two, and only a year beyond cancer 
 surgery. Instead of recapturing time past, I\x{2019}d been captured by it in the 
 present, so that passing seemingly out of the world of time I was, in fact, 
 rocketing through to its secret core. 

 For the hours we were all together, doing nothing more than hugging, kissing, 
 kibitzing, laughing, hovering over one another

 dancing, cheek-to-cheek dancing our outdated dance steps to a \x{201c}one-man band,\x{201d} a 
 bearded boy in a tuxedo, his brow encircled with a red bandanna (a boy born at 
 least two full decades after we\x{2019}d marched together out of the school auditorium 
 to the rousing recessional tempo of Iolanthe), accompanying himself on a 
 synthesizer as he imitated Nat \x{201c}King\x{201d} Cole, Frankie Laine, and Sinatra\x{2014}for those 
 few hours time, the chain of time, the whole damn drift of everything called 
 time, had seemed as easy to understand as the dimensions of the doughnut you 
 effortlessly down with your morning coffee. The one-man band in the bandanna 
 played \x{201c}Mule Train\x{201d} while I thought, The Angel of Time is passing over us and

 Tutty? If his name is Charles, why is he called Tutty?\x{2019} \x{2018}I shouldn\x{2019}t have

 Schrim said to her, \x{2018}nobody can. It\x{2019}s beyond explanation. It just is.\x{201d}\x{2019} 

 And what was Alan now? Raised by a dry cleaner, worked after school for a dry 
 cleaner, himself a dead ringer for a dry cleaner, he was a superior court judge 
 in Pasadena. In his father\x{2019}s pocket-sized dry-cleaning shop there had been a 
 rotogravure picture of FDR framed on the wall above the pressing machine, beside 
 an autographed photo of Mayor Meyer Ellenstein. I remembered these photographs 
 when Alan told me that he had twice been a member of Republican delegations to 
 the presidential convention. When Mendy asked if Alan could get him tickets to 
 the Rose Bowl, Alan Meisner, with whom I used to travel to Brooklyn to see 
 Dodger Sunday doubleheaders the year that Robinson broke in, with whom I\x{2019}d start 
 out at <<eight a.m.|5>> on a bus from our corner, take it downtown to Penn Station,

 Meaningless? Unspectacular? Nothing very enormous going on there? Well, what you 
 make of it would depend on where you grew up and how life got opened up to you. 
 Alan Meisner could not be said to have risen out of nothing; however, 
 remembering him as a little hick obliviously yapping away nonstop in his seat at 
 Ebbets Field, remembering him delivering the dry cleaning through our streets 
 late on a winter afternoon, hatless and in a snow-laden pea jacket, one could 
 easily imagine him destined for something less than the Tournament of Roses.

 especially around the cutters, where they cut the leather, because he wanted to 
 see from the size of the scraps who was losing money for him. I told him early 
 on to fuck off, but Seymour wasn\x{2019}t built like me. He had a big, generous nature 
 and with that they really raked him over the coals, all the impossible ones. Un-
 satisfiable father, unsatisfiable wives, and the little murderer herself, the 
 monster daughter. The monster Merry. The solid thing he once was. At Newark Maid 
 he was an absolute, unequivocal success. Charmed a lot of people into giving 
 their all for Newark Maid. Very adroit businessman. Knew how to cut a glove, 
 knew how to cut a deal. Had an in on Seventh Avenue with the fashion people. The 
 designers there would tell the guy anything. That\x{2019}s how he stayed abreast of the 
 pack. In New York, he was always stopping into the department stores, shopping 
 the competition, looking for something unique about the other guy\x{2019}s product, 
 always in the stores taking a look at the leather, stretching the glove, doing 
 everything just the way my old man taught him. Did most of the selling himself. 
 Handled all the big house accounts. The lady buyers went nuts for Seymour. You 
 can imagine. He\x{2019}d come over to New York, take these tough Jewish broads out to 
 dinner\x{2014}buyers who could make or break you\x{2014}wine and dine them, and they\x{2019}d fall 
 head over heels for the guy. Instead of him buttering them up, by the end of the 
 evening they\x{2019}d be buttering him up. Come Christmastime they\x{2019}d be sending my 
 brother the theater tickets and the case of Scotch rather than the other way 
 around. He knew how to get the confidence of these people just by being himself. 
 He\x{2019}d find out a buyer\x{2019}s favorite charity, get a ticket to the annual dinner at 
 the Waldorf-Astoria, show up like a movie star in his tuxedo, on the spot make a 
 fat donation to cancer, muscular dystrophy, whatever it was, United Jewish 
 Appeal\x{2014}next thing Newark Maid had the account. Knew all the stuff: what colors 
 are going to be next season\x{2019}s colors, whether the length is going to be up or 
 down. Attractive, responsible, hardworking guy. A couple of unpleasant strikes 
 in the sixties, a lot of tension. But his employees are out on the picket line 

 \x{b7} 67 \x{b7} 



 and they see him pull up in the car and the women who sew the gloves start 
 falling all over themselves apologizing for not being at the machines. They were 
 more loyal to my brother than they were to their union. Everybody loved him, a 
 perfectly decent person who could have escaped stupid guilt forever. No reason 
 for him to know anything about anything except gloves. Instead he is plagued 
 with shame and uncertainty and pain for the rest of his life. The incessant 
 questioning of a conscious adulthood was never something that obstructed my 
 brother. He got the meaning for his life some other way. I don\x{2019}t mean he was 
 simple. Some people thought he was simple because all his life he was so kind. 
 But Seymour was never that simple. Simple is never that simple. Still, the self-
 questioning did take some time to reach him. And if there\x{2019}s anything worse than 
 self-questioning coming too early in life, it\x{2019}s self-questioning coming too 
 late. His life was blown up by that bomb. The real victim of that bombing was 
 him.\x{201d}

 killed from this thing, and he did.\x{201d} 

 Jerry said it and it happened. It is Jerry\x{2019}s theory that the Swede is nice, that 
 is to say passive, that is to say trying always to do the right thing, a 
 socially controlled character who doesn\x{2019}t burst out, doesn\x{2019}t yield to rage ever. 
 Will not have the angry quality as his liability, so doesn\x{2019}t get it as an asset 
 either. According to this theory, it\x{2019}s the no-rage that kills him in the end. 
 Whereas aggression is cleansing or curing. 

 It would seem that what kept Jerry going, without uncertainty or remorse and 
 unflaggingly devoted to his own take on things, was that he had a special talent 
 for rage and another special talent for not looking back. Doesn\x{2019}t look back at 
 all, I thought. He\x{2019}s unseared by memory. To him, all looking back is bullshit-
 nostalgia, including even the Swede\x{2019}s looking back, twenty-five years later, at 
 his daughter before that bomb went off, looking back and helplessly weeping for 
 all that went up in that explosion. Righteous anger at the daughter? No doubt 
 that would have helped. Incontestable that nothing is more uplifting in all of 
 life than righteous anger. But given the circumstances, wasn\x{2019}t it asking a lot, 
 asking the Swede to overstep the limits that made him identifiably the Swede? 
 People must have been doing that to him all his life, assuming that because he 
 was once upon a time this mythic character the Swede he had no limits. I\x{2019}d done 
 something like that in Vincent\x{2019}s restaurant, childishly expecting to be wowed by 
 his godliness, only to be confronted by an utterly ordinary humanness. One price 
 you pay for being taken for a god is the unabated dreaminess of your acolytes.

 said. \x{201c}Fatally attracted to responsibility. He could have played ball anywhere 
 he wanted, but he went to Upsala because my father wanted him near home. Giants 
 offered him a Double A contract, might have played one day with Willie Mays\x{2014}
 instead he went down to Central Avenue to work for Newark Maid. My father 



 started him off at a tannery. Puts him for six months working in a tannery on 
 Frelinghuysen Avenue. Up six mornings a week at <<five a.m.|5>> You know what a 
 tannery is? A tannery is a shithole. Remember those days in the summer? A strong 
 wind from the east and the tanning stench wafts over Weequahic Park and covers 
 the whole neighborhood. Well, he gets out of the tannery, Seymour does, strong 
 as an ox, and my father sits him down at a sewing machine for another six months 
 and Seymour doesn\x{2019}t let out a peep. Just masters the fucking machine. Give him 
 the pieces of a glove and he can close it up better than the sewers and in half 
 the time. He could have married any beauty he wanted. Instead he marries the 
 bee-yoo-ti-full Miss Dwyer. You should have seen them. Knockout couple. The two 
 of them all smiles on their outward trip into the USA. She\x{2019}s post-Catholic, he\x{2019}s 
 post-Jewish, together they\x{2019}re going to go out there to Old Rimrock to raise 
 little post-toasties. Instead they get that fucking kid.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}What was wrong with Miss Dwyer?\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}No house they lived in was right. No amount of money in the bank was enough. He 
 set her up in the cattle business. That didn\x{2019}t work. He set her up in the 
 nursery tree business. That didn\x{2019}t work. He took her to Switzerland for the 
 world\x{2019}s best face-lift. Not even into her fifties, still in her forties, but 
 that\x{2019}s what the woman wants, so they schlep to Geneva for a face-lift from the 
 guy who did Princess Grace. He would have been better off spending his life in 
 Double A ball. He would have been better off knocking up some waitress down 
 there in Phoenix and playing first base for the Mud-hens. That fucking kid! She 
 stuttered, you know. So to pay everybody back for her stuttering, she set off 
 the bomb. He took her to speech therapists. He took her to clinics, to 
 psychiatrists. There wasn\x{2019}t enough he could do for her. And the reward? Boom!

 banging heads in a sport whose violence he never really liked, he did it, 
 excelled at it, \x{201c}for the good of the school.\x{201d} 

 But none of what she diligently worked at did Merry an ounce of good. In the 
 quiet, safe cocoon of her speech therapist\x{2019}s office, taken out of her world, she 
 was said to be terrifically at home with herself, to speak flawlessly, make 
 jokes, imitate people, sing. But outside again, she saw it coming, started to go

 signified to her.\x{201d} Or what m or c or g \x{201c}unconsciously signified.\x{201d} And yet 
 nothing of what he surmised meant a goddamn thing. None of his great ideas 
 disposed of a single one of her difficulties. Nothing anybody said meant 
 anything or, in the end, made any sense. The psychiatrist didn\x{2019}t help, the

 to New York. B-b-b-because people there do feel responsible. They feel 
 responsible when America b-blows up Vietnamese villages. They feel responsible 
 when America is b-blowing little b-babies to b-b-b-b-bits. B-but you don\x{2019}t, and 
 neither does Mother. You don\x{2019}t care enough to let it upset a single day of 
 yours. You don\x{2019}t care enough to make you spend another night somewhere. You

 Conversations #24, 25, and 26 about New York. \x{201c}I can\x{2019}t have these conversations,

 Conversation #30 about New York, after Merry returns from staying overnight with

 little comfortable b-b-bour-geois life.\x{201d} \x{201c}They are professors, they are serious 
 academics who are against the war. Did they have any people there?\x{201d} \x{201c}Oh, some 
 English professor against the war, some sociology professor against the war. At 
 least he involves his family against the war. They all march tugu-tugu-tugu-
 together. That\x{2019}s what I call a family. Not these fucking c-c-c-cows.\x{201d} \x{201c}So it 
 went all right there.\x{201d} \x{201c}No. I want to go with my friends. I don\x{2019}t want to go to 
 the Umanoffs at <<eight o\x{2019}clock|6>>. Whatever is happening is happening <<after eight 
 o\x{2019}clock|6>>! If I wanted to be with your friends <<after eight o\x{2019}clock at night|6>>, I 
 could stay here in Rimrock. I want to be with my friends <<after eight o\x{2019}clock|6>>!\x{201d} 
 \x{201c}Nonetheless it worked out. We compromised. You didn\x{2019}t get to be with your 
 friends <<after eight o\x{2019}clock|6>> but you got to spend the day with your friends, 
 which is a lot better than nothing at all. I feel much better about what you 
 have agreed to do. You should too. Are you going to go in next Saturday?\x{201d} \x{201c}I

 from City Hall or the Chamber of Commerce. Though the Swede didn\x{2019}t get nearly 
 the pleasure his father did from being an authority on the glove trade, though 
 he wouldn\x{2019}t claim his father\x{2019}s authority on anything pertaining to the leather 
 industry\x{2014}pertaining to anything else, either\x{2014}occasionally he did assist a 
 student by answering questions over the phone or, if the student struck him as 
 especially serious, by offering a brief tour. 

 Of course, had he known beforehand that this student was no student but his 
 fugitive daughter\x{2019}s emissary, he would never have arranged their meeting to take 
 place at the factory. Why Rita hadn\x{2019}t explained to the Swede whose emissary she 
 was, said nothing about Merry until the tour had been concluded, was undoubtedly 
 so she could size up the Swede first; or maybe she said nothing for so long the 
 better to enjoy toying with him. Maybe she just enjoyed the power. Maybe she was 
 just another politician and the enjoyment of power lay behind much of what she 
 did. 

 Because the Swede\x{2019}s desk was separated from the making department by glass 
 partitions, he and the women at the machines could command a clear view of one 
 another. He had instituted this arrangement so as to wrest relief from the 
 mechanical racket while maintaining access between himself and the floor. His 
 father had refused to be confined to any office, glass-enclosed or otherwise: 
 just planted his desk in the middle of the making room\x{2019}s two hundred sewing 
 machines\x{2014}royalty right at the heart of the overcrowded hive, the swarm around 
 him whining its buzz-saw bee buzz while he talked to his customers and his 
 contractors on the phone and simultaneously plowed through his paperwork. Only 
 from out on the floor, he claimed, could he distinguish within the contrapuntal 
 din the sound of a Singer on the fritz and with his screwdriver be over the 
 machine before the girl had even alerted her forelady to the trouble. Vicky, 
 Newark Maid\x{2019}s elderly black forelady, so testified (with her brand of wry 
 admiration) at his retirement banquet. While everything was running without a 
 hitch, Lou was impatient, fidgety\x{2014}in a word, said Vicky, the insufferable boss\x{2014}
 but when a cutter came around to complain about the fore-

 man, when the foreman came around to complain about a cutter, when skins arrived 
 months late or in damaged condition or were of poor quality, when he discovered 
 a lining contractor cheating him on the yield or a shipping clerk robbing him 
 blind, when he determined that the glove slitter with the red Corvette and the 
 sunglasses was, on the side, a bookie running a numbers game among the 
 employees, then he was in his element and in his inimitable way set out to make 
 things right\x{2014}so that when they were right, said the next-to-last speaker, the 
 proud son, introducing his father in the longest, most laudatory of the 
 evening\x{2019}s jocular encomiums, \x{201c}he could begin driving himself\x{2014}and the rest of us\x{2014}
 nuts with worrying again. But then, always expecting the worst, he was never 
 disappointed for long. Never caught off guard either. All of which goes to show 
 that, like everything else at Newark Maid, worrying works. Ladies and gentlemen, 
 the man who has been my lifelong teacher\x{2014} and not just in the art of worrying\x{2014}
 the man who has made of my life a lifelong education, a difficult education 
 sometimes but always a profitable one, who explained to me when I was a boy of

 went off to begin tanning hides at the age of fourteen, the glover\x{2019}s glover, who

 father, Lou Levov.\x{201d} \x{201c}Look,\x{201d} began Mr. Newark Maid, \x{201c}don\x{2019}t let anybody kid you

 small. I\x{2019}m guessing you\x{2019}re a four.\x{201d} He\x{2019}d already got from the top drawer of his 
 desk a measuring tape with a D ring at one end, and now he put it around her 
 hand, threaded the other end through the D ring, and pulled the tape around her 
 palm. \x{201c}We\x{2019}ll see what kind of guesser I am. Close your hand.\x{201d} She made a fist, 
 causing the hand to slightly expand, and he read the size in French inches. 
 \x{201c}Four it is. In a ladies\x{2019} size that\x{2019}s as small as they come. Anything smaller is 
 a child\x{2019}s. Come on. I\x{2019}ll show you how it\x{2019}s done.\x{201d} 

 He felt as though he\x{2019}d stepped right back into the mouth of the past as they 
 started, side by side, up the wooden steps of the old stairwell. He heard 
 himself telling her (while simultaneously hearing his father telling her), \x{201c}You 
 always sort your skins at the northern side of the factory, where there\x{2019}s no 
 direct sunlight. That way you can really study the skins for quality. Where the 
 sunlight comes in you can\x{2019}t see. The cutting room and the sorting, always on the 
 northern side. Sorting at the top. The second floor the cutting. And 

 124 



 the first floor, where you came, the making. Bottom floor finishing and 
 shipping. We\x{2019}re going to work our way from the top down.\x{201d} 

 That they did. And he was happy. He could not help himself. It was not right. It 
 was not real. Something must be done to stop this. But she was busy taking 
 notes, and he could not stop\x{2014}a girl who knew the value of hard work and paying 
 attention, and interested in the right things, interested in the preparation of 
 leather and the manufacture of gloves, and to stop himself was impossible. 

 When someone is suffering as the Swede was suffering, asking him to be undeluded 
 by a momentary uplifting, however dubious its rationale, is asking an awful lot. 

 In the cutting room, there were twenty-five men at work, <<about six|9:0>> to a table, 
 and the Swede led her over to the oldest of them, whom he introduced as \x{201c}the 
 Master,\x{201d} a small, bald fellow with a hearing aid who continued working at a 
 rectangular piece of leather\x{2014}\x{201d}That\x{2019}s the piece the glove is made from,\x{201d} said the 
 Swede, \x{201c}called a trank\x{201d}\x{2014}working at it with a ruler and shears all the time that 
 the Swede was telling her just who this Master was. With a light heart. Still 
 floating free. Doing nothing to stop it. Letting his father\x{2019}s patter flow. 

 The cutting room was where the Swede had got inspired to follow his father into 
 gloves, the place where he believed he\x{2019}d grown from a boy into a man. The 
 cutting room, up high and full of light, had been his favorite spot in the 
 factory since he was just a kid and the old European cutters came to work 
 identically dressed in three-piece suits, starched white shirts, ties, 
 suspenders, and cuff links. Each cutter would carefully remove the suit coat and 
 hang it in the closet, but no one in the Swede\x{2019}s memory had ever removed the 
 tie, and only a very few descended to the informality of removing the vest, let 
 alone turning up shirtsleeves, before donning a fresh white apron and getting 
 down to the first skin, unrolling it from the dampened muslin cloth and 
 beginning the work of stretching. The wall of big windows to the north 
 illuminated the hardwood cutting tables with the cool, even light you needed for 
 grading and matching and cutting skins. The polished smoothness of the table\x{2019}s 

 125 



 rounded edge, worked smooth over the years from all the animal skins stretched 
 across it and pulled to length, was so provocative to the boy that he always had

 alone a novice in life, but a creature in clandestine harmony with the brutal 
 way of the world, entitled, in the name of historical justice, to be just as 
 sinister as the capitalist oppressor Swede Levov. 

 The unreality of being in the hands of this child! This loathsome kid with a

 not even as much space in the car as the Levov sheepdog, pretending that she was 
 striding on the world stage! This utterly insignificant pebble! What was the 
 whole sick enterprise other than angry, infantile egoism thinly disguised as 
 identification with the oppressed? Her weighty responsibility to the workers of 
 the world! Egoistic pathology bristled out of her like the hair that nuttily 
 proclaimed, \x{201c}I go wherever I want, as far as I want\x{2014}all that matters is what I 
 want!\x{201d} Yes, the nonsensical hair constituted half of their revolutionary 
 ideology, about as sound a justification for her actions as the other half\x{2014}the 
 exaggerated jargon about changing the world. She was twenty-two years old, no 
 more than five feet tall, and off on a reckless adventure with a very potent 
 thing way beyond her comprehension called power. Not the least need of thought. 
 Thought just paled away beside their ignorance. They were omniscient without

 with bombs at the University of Wisconsin. In Chicago a bomb destroys the 
 memorial statue to the policemen killed in the Haymarket riots. In New Haven 
 someone firebombs the home of the judge in the trial of nineteen Black Panthers

 Two years after her disappearance, there is a bomb blast in the most elegant 
 Greek Revival house on the most peaceful residential street in Greenwich 
 Village\x{2014}three explosions and a fire destroy the old four-story brick townhouse. 
 The house is owned by a prosperous New York couple who are on vacation in the 
 Caribbean. After the explosion, two dazed young women stumble, bruised and 
 lacerated, out of the building. One of them, who is naked, is described as being 
 between sixteen and eighteen. The two are sheltered by a neighbor. She gives 
 them clothes to wear, but while the neighbor rushes off to the bombed-out 
 building to see what more she can do, the two young women disappear. One is the 
 twenty-five-year-old daughter of the owners of the townhouse, a member of a 
 violent revolutionary faction of the Students for a Democratic Society called 
 the Weathermen. The other is unidentified. The other is Rita. The other is 
 Merry. They\x{2019}ve roped her into this too! 

 He waits all night in the kitchen for his daughter and the girl Weatherman. It 
 is safe now\x{2014}the surveillance of the house, of the factory, the monitoring of the 
 phones, were dropped more than a year before. It\x{2019}s okay now to show up. He 
 defrosts some soup to feed them. He thinks back to when she had begun to lean 
 toward the sciences. Because of Dawn\x{2019}s cattle, she thought she\x{2019}d be a vet. It 
 was the stuttering, too, that sent her into the sciences, because when she was 
 focused and concentrated on one of her science projects, doing close work, the 
 stuttering always abated a little. No parent in the world could have seen the 
 connection to a bomb. Everyone would have missed it, not just him. Her interest 
 in science was totally innocent. Everything was. 

 The body of a young man found in the rubble of the burned-out house is 
 identified the next day as that of a one-time Columbia student, a veteran of 
 violent antiwar demonstrations, the founder 

 149 



 of a radical SDS splinter group, the Mad Dogs. The following day the second 
 young woman who fled the bomb scene is identified: another radical activist but 
 not Merry\x{2014}the twenty-six-year-old daughter of a left-wing New York lawyer. Even 
 worse is news of another corpse discovered in the rubble at the Village 
 townhouse: the torso of a young woman. \x{201c}The body of the second victim of the 
 blast was not immediately identified and Dr. Elliott Gross, associate medical 
 examiner, said, \x{2018}It will take some time before we have any idea who she is.\x{2019}\x{201d} 

 Alone at the kitchen table, her father knows who she is. Sixty sticks of 
 dynamite, thirty blasting caps, a cache of homemade bombs\x{2014}twelve-inch pipes 
 packed with dynamite\x{2014}are found only twenty feet from the body. It was a pipe 
 packed with dynamite that blew up Hamlin\x{2019}s. She was putting the components of a 
 new bomb together, did something wrong, and blew up the townhouse. First 
 Hamlin\x{2019}s, now herself. She did do it, gave the quaint town its big surprise\x{2014}and 
 this is the result. \x{201c}Dr. Gross confirmed that the torso had a number of puncture 
 wounds, caused by nails, giving credence to the report from the police source 
 that the bombs were apparently being wrapped to act more as antipersonnel 
 weapons than just as explosive devices.\x{201d} 

 The next day more explosions are reported in Manhattan: three midtown buildings 
 bombed simultaneously at <<about one-forty a.m.|5>> The torso\x{2019}s not hers! Merry is 
 alive! Hers is not the body skewered by nails and blown apart! \x{201c}As a result of

 leader assigned to looking after his daughter\x{2019}s well-being? What\x{2019}s in it for her 
 otherwise\x{2014}why else would she keep coming back? 

 So he says to her yes, his daughter is a soldier of freedom, yes, he is proud, 
 yes, everything he has heard about Communism is a lie, yes, the United States is 
 concerned solely with making the world safe for business and keeping the have-
 nots from encroaching on the haves\x{2014}yes, the United States is responsible for 
 oppression everywhere. Everything is justified by her cause, Huey Newton\x{2019}s 
 cause, Bobby Seale\x{2019}s cause, George Jackson\x{2019}s cause, Merry Levov\x{2019}s cause. 
 Meanwhile he mentions Angela\x{2019}s name to no one, certainly not to Vicky, who 
 thinks Angela Davis is a troublemaker and who says as much to the girls at work. 
 Alone then and in secret he prays\x{2014}ardently prays to God, to Jesus, to anyone, to 
 the Blessed Virgin, to St. Anthony, St. Jude, St. Anne, St. Joseph\x{2014}for Angela\x{2019}s 
 acquittal. And when it happens he is jubilant. She is free! But he does not send 
 her the letter that he sits up writing in the kitchen that night, nor does he 
 some weeks later when Angela, in New York, behind a four-sided shield of 
 bulletproof glass and before fifteen thousand exultant supporters, demands the 
 freedom of political prisoners deprived of due process and unjustly imprisoned. 
 Free the Rimrock Bomber! Free my daughter! Free her, please! cries the Swede. \x{201c}I 
 think it\x{2019}s about time,\x{201d} Angela says, \x{201c}for all of us to begin to teach the rulers 
 of this country a few lessons,\x{201d} and yes, cries the Swede, yes, it is about time, 
 a socialist revolution in the United States of America! But nonetheless he 
 remains alone at his kitchen table because he still cannot do anything that he 
 should do or believe anything that he should believe or even know any longer 
 what it is he does believe. Did she do it or didn\x{2019}t she do it? He should have 
 fucked Rita Cohen, if only to find out\x{2014}fucked the conniving little sexual 
 terrorist until she was his slave! Until she took him to the hideout where they 
 made the bombs! If you want to see your daughter as much as you say, you\x{2019}ll just 
 calm down and come 

 \x{b7} 166 \x{b7} 



 over here and give Rita Cohen a nice big fuck. He should have looked at her cunt 
 and tasted it and fucked her. Is that what any father would have done? If he 
 would do anything for Merry, why not that? Why did he run? 

 And this is just a part of what is meant by \x{201c}Five years pass.\x{201d} A very tiny part. 
 Everything he reads or sees or hears has a single significance. Nothing is 
 impersonally perceived. For one whole year he cannot go into the village without 
 seeing where the general store used to be. To buy a newspaper or a quart of milk 
 or a tank of gas he has to drive almost clear into Morristown, and so does 
 everybody else in Old Rimrock. The same to buy a stamp. Basically the village is 
 one street. Going east there is the new Presbyterian church, a white 
 pseudocolonial building that doesn\x{2019}t look like much of anything and that 
 replaced the old Presbyterian church that burned to the ground in the twenties. 
 Just a little ways from the church are The Oaks, a pair of two-hundred-year-old 
 oak trees that are the town\x{2019}s pride. Some thirty yards beyond The Oaks is the 
 old blacksmith shop that was converted, just before Pearl Harbor, into the Home 
 Shop, where local women go to buy wallpaper and lampshades and decorative 
 knicknacks and to get advice from Mrs. Fowler about interior decorating. Down at 
 the far end of the street is the auto-repair garage run by Perry Hamlin, a hard-
 drinking cousin of Russ Hamlin\x{2019}s who also canes chairs, and then beyond that,",

 Sept. i, 1973 Dear Mr. Levov, 

 Merry is working in the old dog and cat hospital on New Jersey Railroad Avenue 
 in the Ironbound Section of Newark, 115 N.J. Railroad Avenue, five minutes from 
 Penn Station. She is there every day. If you wait outside you can catch her 
 leaving work and heading home <<just after four p.m.|10>> She doesn\x{2019}t know I\x{2019}m writing 
 this letter to you. I am at the breaking point and can\x{2019}t go on. I want to go 
 away but I can leave her to no one. You have to take over. Though I warn you 
 that if you tell her that it was from me that you discovered her whereabouts, 
 you will be doing her serious harm. She is an incredible spirit. She has changed 
 everything for me. I got into this over my head because I couldn\x{2019}t ever resist 
 her power. That is too much to get into here. You must believe me when I tell 
 you that I never said anything or did anything other than what Merry demanded me 
 to say and to do. She is an overwhelming force. You and I were in the same boat. 
 I lied to her only once. That was about what happened at the hotel. If I had 
 told her that you refused to make love with me she would have refused to take 
 the money. She would have been back begging on the streets. I would never have 
 made you suffer so if I hadn\x{2019}t the strength of my love for Merry to help me. To 
 you that will

 sound crazy. I am telling you it is so. Your daughter is divine. You cannot be 
 in the presence of such suffering without succumbing to its holy power. You 
 don\x{2019}t know what a nobody I was before I met Merry. I was headed for oblivion. 
 But I can\x{2019}t take anymore, you must not mention ME TO MERRY EXCEPT AS SOMEONE WHO 
 TORMENTED YOU EXACTLY AS I DID. DO NOT MENTION THIS LETTER IF YOU CARE ABOUT 
 MERRY\x{2019}S SURVIVAL. You must take every precaution before getting to the hospital. 
 She could not survive the FBI. Her name is Mary Stoltz. She must be allowed to 
 fulfill her destiny. We can only stand as witnesses to the anguish that 
 sanctifies her.

 He could never root out the unexpected thing. The unexpected thing would be 
 waiting there unseen, for the rest of his life ripening, ready to explode, just 
 a millimeter behind everything else. The unexpected thing was the other side of 
 everything else. He had already parted with everything, then remade everything, 
 and now, when everything appeared to be back under his control, he was being 
 incited to part with everything again. And if that should happen, the unexpected 
 thing becoming the only thing \x{2026} 

 Thing, thing, thing, thing\x{2014}but what other word was tolerable? They could not be 
 forever in bondage to this fucking thing! For five years he had been waiting for 
 just such a letter\x{2014}it had to come. Every night in bed he begged God to deliver 
 it the following morning. And then, in this amazing transitional year, 1973, the 
 year of Dawn\x{2019}s miracle, during these months when Dawn was giving herself over to 
 designing the new house, he had begun to dread what he might find in the 
 morning\x{2019}s mail or hear each time he picked up the phone. How could he allow the 
 unexpected thing back into their lives now that Dawn had ruled out of their 
 lives forever the improbability of what had happened? Leading his wife back to 
 herself had been like flying them through a five-year storm. He had fulfilled 
 every demand. To disentangle her from her horror, there

 and then he would drive the hour in the dark back to Old Rimrock remembering the 
 terror in her face when, fifteen minutes before visiting hours were to end, the 
 nurse put her head in the door to kindly tell Mr. Levov that it was almost time 
 for him to go. 

 The next night she\x{2019}d be angry all over again. He had swayed her from her real 
 ambitions. He and the Miss America Pageant had put her off her program. On she 
 went and he couldn\x{2019}t stop her. Didn\x{2019}t try. What did any of what she said have to 
 do with why she was suffering? Everybody knew that what had broken her was quite 
 enough in itself and that what she said had no bearing on anything. That first 
 time she was in the hospital, he simply listened and nodded, and strange as it 
 was to hear her going angrily on about an adventure that at the time he was 
 certain she couldn\x{2019}t have enjoyed more, he sometimes wondered if it wasn\x{2019}t 
 better for her to identify what had happened to her in 1949, not what had 
 happened to her in 1968, as the problem at hand. \x{201c}All through high school people 
 were telling me, \x{2018}You should be Miss America.\x{2019} I thought it was ridiculous. 
 Based on what should I be Miss America? I was a clerk in a dry-goods store after 
 school and in the summer, and people would come up to my cash register and say, 
 \x{2018}You should be Miss America.\x{2019} I couldn\x{2019}t stand it. I couldn\x{2019}t stand when people 
 said I should do things because of the way that I looked. But when I got a call 
 from the Union County pageant to come to that tea, what could I do? I was a 
 baby. I thought this was a way for me to kick in a little money so my father 
 wouldn\x{2019}t have to work so hard. So I filled out the application and I went, and 
 after all the other girls left, that woman put her arm around me and she told 
 all her neighbors, \x{2018}I want you to know that you\x{2019}ve just spent the afternoon with 
 the next Miss America.\x{2019} I thought, \x{2018}This is all so silly. Why do people keep 
 saying these things to me? I don\x{2019}t want to be doing this.\x{2019} And when I won Miss 
 Union County, people were already saying to me, \x{2018}We\x{2019}ll see you in Atlantic 
 City\x{2019}\x{2014}people who know what they\x{2019}re talking about saying I\x{2019}m going to win this 
 thing, so how could I back out? I couldn\x{2019}t. The whole front page of the 
 Elizabeth Journal was about me winning Miss Union County. I was mortified. I 
 was. I thought 

 179 



 somehow I could keep it all a secret and just win the money. I was a baby! I was 
 sure at least I wasn\x{2019}t going to win Miss New Jersey, I was positive. I looked 
 around and there was this sea of good-looking girls and they all knew what to 
 do, and I didn\x{2019}t know anything. They knew how to use hair rollers and put false 
 eyelashes on, and I couldn\x{2019}t roll my hair right until I was halfway through my 
 Miss New Jersey year. I thought, \x{2018}Oh, my God, look at their makeup,\x{2019} and they 
 had beautiful wardrobes and I had a prom dress and borrowed clothes, and so I 
 was convinced there was no way I could ever win. I was so introverted. I was so 
 unpolished. But I won again. And then they were coaching me on how to sit and 
 how to stand, even how to listen\x{2014}they sent me to a model agency to learn how to

 came to the port in the 1880s, married, settled in south Elizabeth close to St. 
 Mary\x{2019}s, and proceeded to father eleven children. His living he earned at first 
 as a hand on the docks, but he bought a couple of cows to provide milk for the 
 family, wound up selling the surplus to the big shots on West Jersey Street\x{2014}the 
 Moores from Moore Paint, Admiral \x{201c}Bull\x{201d} Halsey\x{2019}s family, Nicholas Murray Butler 
 the Nobel Prize winner\x{2014} and soon became one of the first independent milkmen in 
 Elizabeth. He had about thirty cows on Murray Street, and though he didn\x{2019}t own 
 much property, it didn\x{2019}t matter\x{2014}in those days you could let them graze anywhere. 
 All his sons went into the business and stayed in it until after the war, when 
 the big supermarkets came along and knocked out the little man. Dawn\x{2019}s father, 
 Jim Dwyer, had worked for her mother\x{2019}s family, and that was how Dawn\x{2019}s parents 
 had met. When he was still only a kid, before refrigeration, Jim Dwyer used to 
 go out on the milk truck at <<twelve o\x{2019}clock at night|6>> and stay out till morning 
 delivering milk off the back of the truck. But he hated it. Too tough a life. 
 The heck with that, he finally said, and took up plumbing. Dawn, as a small 
 child, loved to visit the cows, and when she was about six or seven, she was 
 taught by one of her cousins how to milk them, and that thrill\x{2014}squirting the 
 milk out of those udders, the animals just standing there eating hay and letting 
 her tug to her heart\x{2019}s content\x{2014}she never forgot. 

 With beef cattle, however, she wouldn\x{2019}t need the manpower to milk and she could 
 run the operation almost entirely by herself. The Simmental, which made a lot of 
 milk but was a beef animal as well, still weren\x{2019}t a registered breed in the 
 United States at that time, so she could get in on the ground floor. 
 Crossbreeding\x{2014}Simmental to polled Hereford\x{2014}was what interested her, the genetic 
 vigor, the hybrid vigor, the sheer growth that results from crossbreeding. She 
 studied the books, took the magazines, the catalogs started coming in the mail, 
 and at night she would call him over to where 

 \x{b7} 198 \x{b7} 



 she was paging through a catalog and say, \x{201c}Isn\x{2019}t that a good-looking heifer? 
 Have to go out and take a look at her.\x{201d} Pretty soon they were traveling together 
 to shows and sales. She loved the auctions. \x{201c}This reminds me just a little too 
 much,\x{201d} she whispered to the Swede, \x{201c}of Atlantic City. It\x{2019}s the Miss America 
 Pageant for cows.\x{201d} She wore a tag identifying herself\x{2014}\x{201d}Dawn Levov, Arcady 
 Breeders,\x{201d} which was the name of her company, taken from their Old Rimrock 
 address, Box 62, Arcady Hill Road\x{2014}and found it very hard to resist buying a nice 
 cow. 

 A cow or a bull would be led into the ring and paraded around and the show 
 sponsors would give the background of the animal, the sire and the dam and what 
 they did, what the potential was, and then the people would bid, and though Dawn 
 bought carefully, her pleasure just in raising her hand and topping the previous 
 bid was serious pleasure. Much as he wanted more children, not more cows, he had 
 to admit that she was never so fascinating to him, not even when he first saw 
 her at Upsala, as in those moments at the auctions when her beauty came 
 enticingly cloaked in the excitement of bidding and buying. Before Count 
 arrived\x{2014}the champion bull she bought at birth for ten thousand dollars, which 
 her husband, who was a hundred percent behind her, still had to tell her was an 
 awful lot of money\x{2014}his accountant would look at her figures for Arcady Breeders 
 at the end of each year and tell the Swede, \x{201c}This is ridiculous, you can\x{2019}t go on 
 this way.\x{201d} But they really couldn\x{2019}t take a beating as long as it was mostly her 
 own time she put into it, and so he told the accountant, \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t worry, she\x{2019}ll",

 this,\x{201d} and so they did it. Magically (Merry\x{2019}s word) the night before Count left 
 he bred a perfect little heifer, his parting shot. She got the brown spots 
 around the eyes\x{2014}\x{201d}He th-th-th-threw brown eyes all around him\x{201d}\x{2014}but after that, 
 though the bulls were well bred, never again was there an animal to compare with 
 the Count. 

 So did it matter finally that she told people she hated the house? He was now 
 far and away the stronger partner, she was now far and away the weaker; he was 
 the fortunate, doubtlessly undeserving recipient of so much\x{2014}what the hell, to 
 whatever demand she made on him, he acceded. If he could bear something and Dawn 
 couldn\x{2019}t, he didn\x{2019}t understand how he could do anything but accede. That was the 
 only way the Swede knew for a man to go about being a man, especially one as 
 lucky as himself. From the very beginning it had been a far greater strain for 
 him to bear her disappointments than to bear his own; her disappointments seemed 
 to dangerously rob him of himself\x{2014}once he had absorbed her disappointments it 
 became impossible for him to do nothing about them. Half measures wouldn\x{2019}t 
 suffice. His effort to arrive at what she wanted always had to be wholehearted; 
 never was he free of his quiet whole- 

 201 



 heartedness. Not even when everything was on top of him, not even when giving 
 everyone what they needed from him at the factory and everyone what they needed 
 from him at home\x{2014}dealing promptly with the suppliers\x{2019} screw-ups, with the 
 union\x{2019}s exactions, with the buyers\x{2019} complaints; contending with an uncertain 
 marketplace and all the overseas headaches; attending, on demand, to the 
 importuning of a stuttering child, an independent-minded wife, a putatively 
 retired, easily riled-up father\x{2014}did it occur to him that this relentlessly 
 impersonal use of himself might one day wear him down. He did not think like 
 that any more than the ground under his feet thought like that. He seemed never 
 to understand or, even in a moment of fatigue, to admit that his limitations 
 were not entirely loathsome and that he was not himself a one-hundred-and-
 seventy-year-old stone house, its weight borne imperturbably by beams carved of 
 oak\x{2014}that he was something more transitory and mysterious. 

 It wasn\x{2019}t this house she hated anyway; what she hated were memories she couldn\x{2019}t 
 shake loose from, all of them associated with the house, memories that of course 
 he shared. Merry as a grade school kid lying on the floor of the study next to 
 Dawn\x{2019}s desk, drawing pictures of Count while Dawn did the accounts for the farm. 
 Merry emulating her mother\x{2019}s concentration, enjoying working with the same 
 discipline, silently delighting to feel an equal in a common pursuit, and in 
 some preliminary way offering them a glimpse of herself as the adult\x{2014}yes, of the 
 adult friend to them that she would someday be. Memories particularly of when 
 they weren\x{2019}t being what parents are nine-tenths of the time\x{2014}the taskmasters, the 
 examples, the moral authorities, the nags of pick-that-up and you\x{2019}re-going-to-
 be-late, keepers of the diary of her duties and routines\x{2014}memories, rather, of 
 when they found one another afresh, beyond the tensions between parental mastery 
 and inept childish uncertainty, of those moments of respite in a family\x{2019}s life 
 when they could reach one another in calm. 

 The early mornings in the bathroom shaving while Dawn went to wake Merry up\x{2014}he 
 could not imagine a better start to the 

 202 



 morning than catching a glimpse of that ritual. There was never an alarm clock 
 in Merry\x{2019}s life\x{2014}Dawn was her alarm clock. Before <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> Dawn was already 
 out in the barn, but at promptly <<six-thirty|5k:1>> she stopped tending the herd, came",

 being; the foolish remarks she might make to this one or that one were of no 
 consequence beside the recovery taking hold. Maybe what was agitating him was 
 that the self-adjustments on which she was building a recovery were not 
 regenerative for him or entirely admirable to him, were even something of an 
 affront to him. He could not tell people\x{2014}certainly couldn\x{2019}t convince himself\x{2014}
 that he hated the things he\x{2019}d loved\x{2026}.

 Merry would eat herself sick with the raw batter while baking two dozen 
 tollhouse cookies, and a week later they\x{2019}d still be finding batter all over the

 refrigerator? How could he let his emotions be reshaped, imagine himself being 
 rescued, as Dawn did, by their leaving it behind for an all-but-silent new 
 IceTemp, the Rolls-Royce of refrigerators? He for one could not say he hated the 
 kitchen in which Merry used to bake her cookies and melt her cheese sandwiches 
 and make her baked ziti, even if the cupboards weren\x{2019}t stainless steel or the 
 counters Italian marble. He could not say he hated the cellar where she used to 
 go to play hide-and-seek with her screaming friends, even if sometimes it 
 spooked even him a little to be down there in the wintertime with those 
 scuttling mice. He could not say he hated the massive fireplace adorned with the 
 antique iron kettle that was all at once insufferably corny in Dawn\x{2019}s 
 estimation, not when he remembered how, early every January, he would chop up 
 the Christmas tree and set it afire there, the whole thing in one go, so that 
 the explosive blaze of the bone-dry branches, the great whoosh and the loud 
 crackling and the dancing shadows, cavorting devils climbing to the ceiling from 
 the four walls, would transport Merry into a delirium of terrified delight. He 
 could not say he hated the ball-and-claw-foot bathtub where he used to give her 
 baths, just because decades of indelible mineral stains from the well water 
 streaked . the enamel and encircled the drain. He could not even hate the f ^ 
 toilet whose handle required all that jiggling to get the thing to

 stop gushing, not when he remembered her kneeling beside it and throwing up 
 while he knelt next to her, holding her sick little forehead. 

 Nor could he say he hated his daughter for what she had done\x{2014} if he could! If 
 only, instead of living chaotically in the world where she wasn\x{2019}t and in the 
 world where she once was and in the world where she might now be, he could come 
 to hate her enough not to care anything about her world, then or now. If only he 
 could be back thinking like everybody else, once again the totally natural man 
 instead of this riven charlatan of sincerity, an artless outer Swede and a 
 tormented inner Swede, a visible stable Swede and a concealed beleaguered Swede, 
 an easygoing, smiling sham Swede enshrouding the Swede buried alive. If only he

 for his straightforward physical confidence and freedom before he became the 
 father of an alleged murderer. If only he could be as unknowing as some people 
 perceived him to be\x{2014}if only he could be as perfectly simple as the legend of 
 Swede Levov concocted by the hero-worshiping kids of his day. If only he could

 Winning that war. Victory, victory, victory had come! No more death and war! 

 His last months of high school, he\x{2019}d read the paper every night, following the 
 marines across the Pacific. He saw the photographs in Life\x{2014}photographs that 
 haunted his sleep\x{2014}of the crumpled bodies of dead marines killed on Peleliu, an 
 island in a chain called the Palaus. At a place called Bloody Nose Ridge, Japs 
 ferreted in old phosphate mines, who were themselves to be burned to a crisp by 
 the flamethrowers, had cut down hundreds and hundreds of young marines, 
 eighteen-year-olds, nineteen-year-olds, boys barely older than he was. He had a 
 map up in his room with pins sticking out of it, pins he had inserted to mark 
 where the marines, closing in on Japan, had assaulted from the sea a tiny atoll 
 or an island chain where the Japs, dug into coral fortresses, poured forth 
 ferocious mortar and rifle fire. Okinawa was invaded on April 1,1945, Easter 
 Sunday of his senior year and just two days after he\x{2019}d hit a double and a home 
 run in a losing game against West Side. The Sixth Marine Division overran 
 Yontan, one of the two island air bases, within three hours of wading ashore. 
 Took the Motobu Peninsula in thirteen days. Just off the Okinawa beach, two 
 kamikaze pilots attacked the flagship carrier Bunker Hill on May 14\x{2014}the day 
 after the Swede went four for four against Irvington High, a single, a triple, 
 and two doubles\x{2014}plunging their planes, packed with bombs, into the flight deck 
 jammed with American planes all gassed up to take off and laden with ammunition. 
 The blaze climbed a thousand feet into the sky, and in the explosive firestorm 
 that raged for eight hours, four hundred sailors and aviators died. Marines of 
 the Sixth Division captured Sugar Loaf Hill, May 14, 1945\x{2014}three more doubles for 
 the Swede in a winning game against East Side\x{2014}maybe the worst, most savage 
 single day of fighting in marine history. Maybe the worst in human history. The 
 caves and tunnels that honeycombed Sugar Loaf Hill at the southern end of the 
 island, where the Japs had fortified and hidden their army, were blasted with 
 flamethrowers and then sealed with grenades and demolition charges. Hand-to-hand 
 fighting went on day and night. 

 209 



 Jap riflemen and machine gunners, chained to their positions and unable to 
 retreat, fought until they died. The day the Swede graduated from Weequahic 
 High, June 22\x{2014}having racked up the record number of doubles in a single season 
 by a Newark City League player\x{2014}the Sixth Marine Division raised the American 
 flag over Okinawa\x{2019}s second air base, Kadena, and the final staging area for the 
 invasion of Japan was secured. From April 1, 1945, to June 21, 1945\x{2014}coinciding,

 The room was on the ground floor of a house that a hundred years ago might have 
 been a boardinghouse, not a bad one either, a respectable boardinghouse, 
 brownstone below the parlor floor, neat brickwork above, curved railings of cast 
 iron leading up the brick steps to the double doorway. But the old boardinghouse 
 was now a wreck marooned on a narrow street where there were only two other 
 houses left. Incredibly, two of the old Newark plane trees were left as well.

 The street where Merry lived was paved with bricks. There couldn\x{2019}t be more than 
 a dozen of these brick streets intact in the entire city. The last of the 
 cobblestone streets, a pretty old cobblestone street, had been stolen about 
 three weeks after the riots.

 While the rubble still reeked of smoke where the devastation was the worst, a 
 developer from the suburbs had arrived with a crew <<around one a.m.|9h>>, three trucks 
 and some twenty men moving stealthily, and during the night, without a cop to 
 bother them, they\x{2019}d dug up the cobblestones from the narrow side street that cut 
 diagonally back of Newark Maid and carted them all away. The street was gone 
 when the Swede showed up for work the next morning. 

 \x{201c}Now they\x{2019}re stealing streets?\x{201d} his father asked. \x{201c}Newark can\x{2019}t even hold on to 
 its streets? Seymour, get the hell out!\x{201d} His father\x{2019}s had become the voice of 
 reason. 

 Merry\x{2019}s street was just a couple of hundred feet long, squeezed into the 
 triangle between McCarter\x{2014}where, as always, the heavy truck traffic barreled by 
 night and day\x{2014}and the ruins of Mulberry Street. Mulberry the Swede could recall 
 as a Chinatown slum as long ago as the 1930s, back when the Newark Levovs, 
 Jerry, Seymour, Momma, Poppa, used to file up the narrow stairwell to one of the 
 family restaurants for a chow mein dinner on a Sunday afternoon and, later, 
 driving home to Keer Avenue, his father would tell the boys unbelievable stories 
 about the Mulberry Street \x{201c}tong wars\x{201d} of old. 

 Of old. Stories of old. There were no longer stories of old. There was nothing. 
 There was a mattress, discolored and waterlogged, like a cartoon-strip drunk 
 slumped against a pole. The pole still held up a sign telling you what corner 
 you were on. And that\x{2019}s all there was. 

 Above and beyond the roofline of her house, he could see the skyline of 
 commercial Newark half a mile away and those three familiar, comforting words, 
 the most reassuring words in the English language, cascading down the elegantly 
 ornate cliff that was once the focal point of a buzzing downtown\x{2014}ten stories

 permanence, civic progress and opportunity and pride, indestructible letters

 Swede finally found out! They were delirious with joy, delighted having 
 destroyed his once-pampered daughter and ruined his privileged life, shepherding 
 him at long last to their truth, to the truth as they knew it to be for every 
 Vietnamese man, woman, child, and tot, for every colonized black in America, for 
 everyone everywhere who had been fucked over by the capitalists and their 
 insatiable greed. The something that\x{2019}s demented, honky, is American history!

 She told him that for the first seventy-two hours after the bombing she had been 
 hidden in the Morristown home of Sheila Salz-man, her speech therapist. Safely 
 she made her way to Sheila\x{2019}s house, was taken in, and lived hidden away in an 
 anteroom to Sheila\x{2019}s office during the day and in the office itself at night. 
 Then her underground wandering began. In just two months she had fifteen aliases 
 and moved every four or five days. But in Indianapolis, where she was befriended 
 by a movement minister who knew only that she was an antiwar activist gone 
 underground, she took a name from a tombstone in a cemetery, the name of a baby 
 born within a year of herself who had died in infancy. She applied for a 
 duplicate birth certificate in the baby\x{2019}s name, which was how she became Mary 
 Stoltz. After that, she obtained a library card, a Social Security number, and 
 when she turned seventeen, a driver\x{2019}s license. For nearly a year, Mary Stoltz 
 washed dishes in the kitchen of an old people\x{2019}s home\x{2014}a job she got through the 
 minister\x{2014}until one morning he reached her on the pay phone and said that she was 
 to leave work immediately and meet him at the Greyhound station. There he gave 
 her a ticket to Chicago, told her to stay two days, then to buy a ticket for 
 Oregon\x{2014}north of Portland was a commune where she could find sanctuary. He gave 
 her the commune\x{2019}s address and some money to buy clothes, food, and the tickets, 
 and she left for Chicago, where she was raped on 

 257 



 the night she arrived. Held captive and raped and robbed. Just <<seventeen|9k:0>>. 

 In the kitchen of a dive not as friendly as the kitchen at the old people\x{2019}s 
 home, she washed dishes to earn the money to get to Oregon. There was no 
 minister to advise her in Chicago and she was afraid that if she tried to make 
 contact with the underground she would do something wrong and be apprehended. 
 She was too frightened even to use a pay phone to call the Indianapolis 
 minister. She was raped again (in the fourth rooming house where she went to 
 live) but this time she wasn\x{2019}t robbed, and so after six weeks as a dishwasher 
 she had put together enough money to head for the commune. 

 In Chicago the loneliness had been so all-enveloping, she felt it as a current 
 coursing through her. There wasn\x{2019}t a day, on some days not an hour, when she did 
 not set out to phone Old Rimrock. But instead, before remembering her childhood 
 room could completely undo her, she would find a diner or a luncheonette and sit 
 on a stool at the counter and order a BIT and a vanilla milk shake. Saying the 
 familiar words, watching the bacon curl on the grill, watching for her toast to 
 pop up, carefully removing the toothpicks when she was served, eating the 
 layered sandwich between sips of the shake, concentrating on crunching the 
 tasteless fibers from the lettuce, extracting the smoke-scented fat from the 
 brittle bacon and the flowery juices from the soft tomato, swilling everything 
 in with the mash of the mayonnaised toast, grinding patiently away with her jaws 
 and her teeth, thoughtfully pulverizing every mouthful into a silage to settle 
 her down\x{2014}concentrating on her BLT as fixedly as her mother\x{2019}s livestock focusing",

 the sandwich and drink the shake and remember how she got there and go on. By 
 the time she left Chicago she had discovered she no longer needed a home; she 
 would never again come close to succumbing to the yearning for a family and a 
 home. 

 In Oregon she was involved in two bombings. 

 Instead of stopping her, killing Fred Conlon had only inspired 

 \x{b7} 258 \x{b7} 



 her; after Fred Conlon, instead of her being crippled by conscience, she was 
 delivered from all residual fear and compunction. The horror of having killed, 
 if only inadvertently, an innocent man, a man as good as any she would ever hope 
 to know, had not taught her anything about that most fundamental prohibition, 
 which, stupefyingly enough, she had failed to learn to observe from being raised 
 by Dawn and him. Killing Conlon only confirmed her ardor as an idealistic 
 revolutionary who did not shrink from adopting any means, however ruthless, to 
 attack the evil system. She had proved that being in opposition to everything 
 decent in honky America wasn\x{2019}t just so much hip graffiti emblazoned on her 
 bedroom wall.

 There was plenty to eat at the commune. They grew a lot of their own food and so 
 there was no need, as there had been when she first got to Chicago, to scavenge 
 for wilted produce outside supermarkets at night. At the commune she began to 
 sleep with a woman she fell in love with, the wife of a weaver whose loom Merry 
 learned to operate when she was not working with the bombs. Assembling bombs had 
 become her specialty after she\x{2019}d successfully planted her second and third. She 
 loved the patience and the precision required to safely wire the dynamite to the 
 blasting cap and the blasting cap to the Woolworth\x{2019}s alarm clock. That\x{2019}s when 
 the stuttering first began to disappear. She never stuttered when she was with 
 the dynamite.

 improbably belonging to the upper Merry and not as yet to the lower. No fat. Not 
 an ounce anywhere. The cleft, as though an awl had made it\x{2014}that beautifully 
 beveled joining that will petal outward, evolving in the cycle of time into a 
 woman\x{2019}s origami-folded cunt. The implausible belly button. The geometric torso. 
 The anatomical precision of the rib cage. The pliancy of her spine. The bony 
 ridges of her back like keys on a small xylophone. The lovely dormancy of the 
 invisible bosom before the swell begins. All the turbulent wanting-to-become 
 blessedly, blessedly dormant. Yet in the neck somehow is the woman to be, there 
 in that building block of a neck ornamented with down. The face. That\x{2019}s the 
 glory. The face that she will not carry with her and that is yet the fingerprint 
 of the future. The marker that will disappear and yet be there fifty years 
 later. How little of her story is revealed in his child\x{2019}s face. Its youngness is 
 all he can see. So very new in the cycle. With nothing as yet totally defined, 
 time is so powerfully present in her face. The skull is soft. The flare of the 
 unstructured nose is the whole nose. The color of her eyes. The white, white 
 whiteness. The limpid blue. Eyes unclouded. It\x{2019}s all unclouded, but the eyes 
 particularly, windows, washed windows with nothing yet of the revelation of 
 what\x{2019}s within. The history in her brow of the embryo. The dried apricots that 
 are her ears. Delicious. If once you started eating them you\x{2019}d never stop. The 
 little ears always older than she is. The ears that were never just four years 
 old and yet hadn\x{2019}t really changed since she was fourteen months. The 
 preternatural fineness of her hair. The health of it. More reddish, more like 
 his mother\x{2019}s than his then, still touched with fire then. The smell of the whole 
 day in her hair. The carefreeness, the abandon of that body in his arms. The 
 catlike abandon to the all-powerful father, the reassuring giant. It is so, it 
 is true\x{2014}in the abandon of her body to him, she excites an instinct for 
 reassurance that is so abundant that it must be close to what Dawn says she felt 
 when she was lactating. What he feels when his daughter leaves the earth to leap 
 into his arms is the absoluteness of their intimacy. And built into it always is 
 the 

 271 



 knowledge that he is not going too far, that he cannot, that it is an enormous 
 freedom and an enormous pleasure, the equivalent of her breast-feeding bond with 
 Dawn. It\x{2019}s true. It\x{2019}s undeniable. He was wonderful at it and so was she. So 
 wonderful. How did all this happen to this wonderful kid? She stuttered. So 
 what? What was the big deal? How did all this happen to this perfectly normal 
 child? Unless this is the sort of thing that does happen to the wonderful, 
 perfectly normal kids. The nuts don\x{2019}t do these things\x{2014}the normal kids do. You 
 protect her and protect her\x{2014}and she is unprotectable. If you don\x{2019}t protect her 
 it\x{2019}s unendurable, if you do protect her it\x{2019}s unendurable. It\x{2019}s all unendurable. 
 The awfulness of her terrible autonomy. The worst of the world had taken his 
 child. If only that beautifully chiseled body had never been born. 

 He calls his brother. It is the wrong brother from whom to seek consolation, but 
 what can he do? When it comes to consolation, it is always the wrong brother, 
 the wrong father, the wrong mother, the wrong wife, which is why one must be 
 content to console oneself and be strong and go on in life consoling others. But 
 he needs some relief from this rape, needs the rape taken out of his heart, 
 where it is stabbing him to death, he cannot put up with it, and so he calls the 
 only brother he has. If he had another brother he would call him. But for a 
 brother he has only Jerry and Jerry has only him. For a daughter he has only 
 Merry. For a father she has only him. There is no way around any of this. 
 Nothing else can be made to come true. 

 It is <<half past five|10>> on a Friday afternoon. Jerry is in the office seeing

 amount had gone off to her the day after she had called, sobbing and screaming 
 for help, to say 

 \x{b7} 296 \x{b7} 



 that Jerry had left her that morning for the new nurse in his office. The 
 position of new nurse in the office was one that she had herself occupied before 
 Jerry began the affair with her that ended in his divorcing his first wife. 
 According to the Swede\x{2019}s mother, after Jerry found out about the check for 
 fifteen thousand he proceeded over the phone to call his father \x{201c}every name in 
 the book,\x{201d} and that night, for the first time in his life, Lou Levov had chest

 somewhere, I think at school, and made them into a coat for some girl. He 
 thought he was doing her a favor. But she received this thing, I think by mail, 
 in a box, all wrapped up and it smelled to high heaven, and the girl burst into 
 tears, and her mother telephoned, and your father was fit to be tied. He was 
 mortified. And they had an argument, he and Jerry, and it scared me to death. A

 egotistical in his expansive courtesy, causing her to believe that to this young 
 country squire with the charming manners she was nothing but laughable lace-
 curtain Irish, a girl who\x{2019}d somehow got down the knack of aping her betters so 
 as now to come ludicrously barging into his privileged backyard. The confidence, 
 that\x{2019}s what unstrung her, that great confidence. Sure she\x{2019}d been Miss New 
 Jersey, but the Swede had seen her on a few occasions with these rich Ivy League 
 guys in their Shetland sweaters. Her affronted defensiveness always came as a 
 surprise. She didn\x{2019}t seem ever to feel deficient in confidence until she met 
 them and felt the class sting. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry,\x{201d} she\x{2019}d say, \x{201c}I know it\x{2019}s just my

 resentment of hers had always secretly attracted him\x{2014}in the face of hostility, 
 he thought proudly, my wife is no pushover\x{2014}it perturbed and disappointed him as

 accomplishment who was too renowned to have to feel resentful. \x{201c}The only

 even to speak to him\x{2014}was knowing all too well just how far back he and his 
 manners reached into the genteel past, and so she stayed at home the day of the 
 tour, perfectly content to be alone with the baby. 

 Her husband and Orcutt, promptly at <<eight|9c:1>>, headed diagonally to the northwest 
 corner of the county and then, backtracking, followed the southward meandering 
 spine of the old iron mines, Orcutt all the while recounting the glory days of 
 the nineteenth century, when iron was king, millions of tons pulled from this 
 very ground; starting from Hibernia and Boonton down to Morristown, the towns 
 and villages had been thick with rolling mills, nail and spike factories, 
 foundries and forging shops. Orcutt showed him the site of the old mill in 
 Boonton where axles, wheels, and rails were manufactured for the original Morris 
 and Essex Railroad. He showed him the powder company plant in Kenvil that made 
 dynamite for the mines and then, for the First World War, made TNT and more or 
 less paved the way for the government to build the arsenal up at Picatinny, 
 where they\x{2019}d manufactured the big shells for the Second World War. It was at the 
 Kenvil plant that there\x{2019}d been the munitions explosion in 1940\x{2014}fifty-two killed, 
 carelessness the culprit, though at first foreign agents, spies, were suspected. 
 He drove him partway along the western course of the old Morris Canal, where 
 barges had carried the anthracite in from Phillipsburg to fuel the Morris 
 foundries. With a little smile, Orcutt added\x{2014}to the Swede\x{2019}s surprise\x{2014}that 
 directly across the Delaware from Phillipsburg was Easton, and \x{201c}Easton,\x{201d} he

 his father replied. 

 But the Swede, rather like some frontiersman of old, would not be turned back. 
 What was impractical and ill-advised to his father was an act of bravery to him. 
 Next to marrying Dawn Dwyer, buying that house and the hundred acres and moving 
 out to Old Rimrock was the most daring thing he had ever done. What was Mars to 
 his father was America to him\x{2014}he was settling Revolutionary New Jersey as if for 
 the first time. Out in Old Rimrock, all of America lay at their door. That was 
 an idea he loved. Jewish resentment, Irish resentment\x{2014}the hell with it. A 
 husband and wife each just twenty-five years of age, a baby of less than a year\x{2014}
 it had been courageous of them to head out to Old Rimrock. He\x{2019}d already heard 
 tell of more than a few strong, intelligent, talented guys in the leatherware 
 business beaten down by their fathers, and he wasn\x{2019}t going to let it happen to 
 him. He\x{2019}d fallen in love with the same business as his old man had, he\x{2019}d taken 
 his birthright, and now he was moving beyond it to damn well live where he 
 wanted. 

 No, we are not going to have anybody\x{2019}s resentment. We are thirty-five miles out 
 beyond that resentment. He wasn\x{2019}t saying it was always easy to blend across 
 religious borders. He wasn\x{2019}t saying there wasn\x{2019}t prejudice\x{2014}he\x{2019}d faced it as a 
 recruit in the Marine 

 310 



 Corps, in boot camp on a couple of occasions faced it head-on and faced it down. 
 She\x{2019}d had her own brush with blatant anti-Semitism at the pageant in Atlantic 
 City when her chaperone referred distastefully to 1945, when Bess Myerson became 
 Miss America, as \x{201c}the year the Jewish girl won.\x{201d} She\x{2019}d heard plenty of casual 
 cracks about Jews as a kid, but Atlantic City was the real world and it shocked 
 her. She wouldn\x{2019}t repeat it at the time because she was fearful that he would 
 turn against her for remaining politely silent and failing to tell the stupid 
 woman where to get off, especially when her chaperone added, \x{201c}I grant she was 
 good-looking, but it was a great embarrassment to the pageant nonetheless.\x{201d} Not 
 that it mattered one way or the other anymore. Dawn was a mere contestant, 
 twenty-two years old\x{2014}what could she have said or done? His point was that they 
 both were aware, from firsthand experience, that these prejudices existed. In a 
 community as civilized as Old Rim-rock, however, differences of religion did not 
 have to be as hard to deal with as Dawn was making them. If she could marry a 
 Jew, she could surely be a friendly neighbor to a Protestant\x{2014}sure as hell could 
 if her husband could. The Protestants are just another denomination. Maybe they 
 were rare where she grew up\x{2014}they were rare where he grew up too\x{2014}but they happen 
 not to be rare in America. Let\x{2019}s face it, they are America. But if you do not 
 assert the superiority of the Catholic way the way your mother does, and I do 
 not assert the superiority of the Jewish way the way my father does, I\x{2019}m sure 
 we\x{2019}ll find plenty of people out here who won\x{2019}t assert the superiority of the 
 Protestant way the way their fathers and mothers did. Nobody dominates anybody",

 wall, we\x{2019}re going to have modern art on the wall. Formal means on the wall. 
 However much Dawn might deny it, wasn\x{2019}t there something of that going on here? 
 Irish envy? 

 She\x{2019}d bought the painting right out of Orcutt\x{2019}s studio for exactly half as much 
 as it had cost them to buy Count when he was a baby bull. The Swede told 
 himself, \x{201c}Forget the dough, write it off\x{2014}you can\x{2019}t compare a bull to a 
 painting,\x{201d} and in this way managed to control his disappointment when he saw 
 Meditation #27 go up on the very spot where once there had been the portrait of 
 Merry that he\x{2019}d loved, a painstakingly perfect if somewhat overly pinkish 
 likeness of the glowing child in blond bangs she had been at <<six|9c:1>>. It had been 
 painted in oils for them by a jovial old gent down in New Hope who wore a smock 
 and a beret in his studio there\x{2014}he\x{2019}d taken the time to serve them mulled wine 
 and tell them about his apprenticeship copying paintings in the Louvre\x{2014}and who\x{2019}d 
 come to the house six times for Merry to sit for him at the piano, and wanted 
 only two thousand smackers for the painting and the gilt frame. But as the Swede 
 was told, since Orcutt hadn\x{2019}t asked for the additional thirty percent it would 
 have cost had they purchased #27 from the frame shop, the five grand was a 
 bargain. 

 His father\x{2019}s comment, when he saw the new painting, was \x{201c}How much the guy charge 
 you for that?\x{201d} With reluctance Dawn replied, \x{201c}Five thousand dollars.\x{201d} \x{201c}Awful lot 
 of money for a first coat. What\x{2019}s it going to be?\x{201d} \x{201c}Going to be?\x{201d} Dawn had 
 replied sourly. \x{201c}Well, it

 said Dawn, \x{201c}is the idea, Lou.\x{201d} \x{201c}Yeah?\x{201d} He looked again. \x{201c}Well, if the guy ever 
 wants to finish it, I can tell him how.\x{201d} \x{201c}Dad,\x{201d} said the Swede, to forestall 
 further criticism, \x{201c}Dawn bought it because she likes it,\x{201d} and though he also 
 could have told the guy how to finish it (probably in words close to those his 
 father had in mind), he was more than willing to hang anything Dawn bought from 
 Orcutt just because she had bought it. Irish envy or no Irish envy, the painting 
 was another sign that the desire to live had become stronger in her

 than the wish to die that had put her into the psychiatric clinic twice. \x{201c}So the 
 picture is shit,\x{201d} he told his father later. \x{201c}The thing is, she wanted it. The 
 thing is she wants again. Please,\x{201d} he warned him, feeling himself\x{2014}strangely, 
 given the slightness of the provocation\x{2014}at the edge of anger, \x{201c}no more about 
 that picture.\x{201d} And Lou Levov being Lou Levov, the next time he visited Old 
 Rimrock the first thing he did was to walk up to the picture and say loudly, 
 \x{201c}You know something? I like that thing. I\x{2019}m gettin\x{2019} used to it and I actually 
 like it. Look,\x{201d} he said to his wife, \x{201c}look at how the guy didn\x{2019}t finish it. See 
 that? Where it\x{2019}s blurry? He did that on purpose. That\x{2019}s art.\x{201d} 

 In the back of Orcutt\x{2019}s van was his large cardboard model of the new Levov 
 house, ready to unveil to the guests after dinner. Sketches and blueprints had 
 been piling up in Dawn\x{2019}s study for weeks now, among them a diagram prepared by 
 Orcutt charting how sunlight would angle into the windows on the first day of 
 each month of the year. \x{201c}A flood of sunlight,\x{201d} said Dawn. \x{201c}Light!\x{201d} she 
 exclaimed. \x{201c}Light!\x{201d} And if not with the brutal directness that could truly test 
 to the limit his understanding of her suffering and of the panacea she\x{2019}d 
 devised, by implication she was damning yet again the stone house he loved and, 
 too, the old maple trees he loved, the giant trees that shaded the house against 
 the summer heat and every autumn ceremoniously cloaked the lawn in a golden

            "talk about\x{2014}on the occasions when she managed to leave the house and go out among 
 people\x{2014} was the \x{201c}fun\x{201d} she\x{2019}d had back before she\x{2019}d ever had a drink, a husband, a

 certainly had looked to him to be) by the stupendous satisfactions of being a 
 dependable person. 

 That people were manifold creatures didn\x{2019}t come as a surprise to the Swede, even 
 if it was a bit of a shock to realize it anew when someone let you down. What 
 was astonishing to him was how people seemed to run out of their own being, run 
 out of whatever the stuff was that made them who they were and, drained of 
 themselves, turn into the sort of people they would once have felt sorry for. It 
 was as though while their lives were rich and full they were secretly sick of 
 themselves and couldn\x{2019}t wait to dispose of their sanity and their health and all 
 sense of proportion so as to get down to that other self, the true self, who was 
 a wholly deluded fuckup. It was as though being in tune with life was an 
 accident that might sometimes befall the fortunate young but was otherwise 
 something for which human beings lacked any real affinity. How odd. And how odd 
 it made him seem to himself to think that he who had always felt blessed to be 
 numbered among the countless unembattled normal ones might, in fact, be the 
 abnormality, a stranger from real life because of his being so sturdily rooted. 

 \x{201c}We had a place outside Paoli,\x{201d} Jessie was telling his father. \x{201c}We always raised 
 animals. When I was seven I got the most wonderful thing. Somebody gave me a 
 pony and a cart. And after that there was nothing to stop me. I just loved 
 horses. I\x{2019}ve ridden all my life. Showed and hunted. Was involved in a drag down 
 there in school in Virginia. When I went to school in Virginia I was the whip.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}Wait a minute,\x{201d} said Mr. Levov. \x{201c}Whoa. I don\x{2019}t know what a drag and a whip is. 
 Slow down, Mrs. Orcutt. You got a guy from Newark here.\x{201d}

 She pursed her lips\x{2014}when he called her \x{201c}Mrs. Orcutt\x{201d}\x{2014}seemingly for his having 
 addressed her as though he were her social inferior, which, the Swede knew, was 
 in part why his father had called her \x{201c}Mrs. Orcutt.\x{201d} But she was \x{201c}Mrs. Orcutt\x{201d} 
 to Lou Levov also because of the distancing disdain he had for the drink in her 
 glass, her third Scotch and water in under an hour, and the cigarette\x{2014}her 
 fourth\x{2014}burning down between the fingers of her trembling hand. He was amazed by 
 her lack of control\x{2014}by anyone\x{2019}s lack of control but particularly by the lack of 
 control of the goy who drank. Drink was the devil that lurked in the goy\x{2014}\x{201d}Big-
 shot goyim,\x{201d} his father said, \x{201c}the presidents of companies, and they\x{2019}re like 
 Indians with firewater.\x{201d} 

 \x{2018}\x{201c}Jessie,\x{201d}\x{2019} she said, \x{201c}\x{2018}Jessie,\x{2019} please,\x{201d} her grin painfully artificial, 
 disguising, by the Swede\x{2019}s estimate, about ten percent of the agony she now felt 
 at having decided against staying alone at home with her dogs and her TV tray 
 and her own J&B and, in a ridiculous eruption of hope, opting instead for going 
 out like a wife with her husband. At home there was a phone next to the J&B; she 
 could reach over her glass and pick it up and dial, and even if only half 
 dressed, she could tell the people she knew, without having to face the terror 
 of facing them, how much she liked them. Months might go by without one of 
 Jessie\x{2019}s phone calls, and then she\x{2019}d phone three times after they were already 
 in bed for the night. \x{201c}Seymour, I\x{2019}m calling to tell you how much I like you.\x{201d} 
 \x{201c}Well, Jessie, thank you. I like you too.\x{201d} \x{201c}Do you?\x{201d} \x{201c}Of course I do. You know

 two hours later, still lying there, was nearly run over by a pickup truck. 

 \x{201c}Okay, my friend Jessie, fill me in. What is a drag and a whip?\x{201d} You couldn\x{2019}t 
 say his father didn\x{2019}t try to get along with people for all that he really 
 couldn\x{2019}t. If she was a guest of his children, then she was his friend, 
 regardless of how repelled he might be by the cigarettes, by the whiskey, by the 
 unkempt hair and the rundown shoes and the burlap tent concealing the ill-used 
 body\x{2014}by all the privilege she had squandered and the disgrace she had made of 
 her life. 

 \x{201c}A drag is a hunt and it\x{2019}s not with a fox. It\x{2019}s over a line that\x{2019}s laid by a man 
 on a horse ahead of you \x{2026} that has a scent in a bag. It\x{2019}s to make the effect 
 of a hunt. The hounds go after it. There are huge, huge fences, and it\x{2019}s done in 
 a sort of a course. It\x{2019}s a lot of fun. You go very fast. Huge, huge, thick brush 
 fences. <<Eight|9k:0>>, ten feet wide with bars on top. Quite exciting. Down there 
 there\x{2019}s a lot of stee-plechasing and a lot of good riders and everybody gets out 
 there and bombs through those places and it\x{2019}s fun.\x{201d} 

 It appeared to the Swede to be as much her confoundment with her predicament\x{2014}a 
 tipsy woman, out at a party, blabbing uncontrollably\x{2014}as his father\x{2019}s genial I\x{2019}m-
 just-a-dope inquiry that drew her disastrously on, each slurred word 
 unsuccessfully stimulating her mouth to try to produce one that rang clear as a 
 bell. Clear as the \x{201c}Daddy!\x{201d} that had pealed out perfectly from behind the veil 
 of his daughter the Jain. 

 He knew what his father was thinking without bothering to look up from where he 
 was using the tongs to make a pyramid of the reddest coals. Fun, his father was 
 thinking, what is it with them and fun? What is this fun? What is so much fun? 
 His father was wondering, as he had ever since his son had bought the house and 
 the hundred acres forty miles west of Keer Avenue, Why does he want to live with 
 these people? Forget the drinking. Sober\x{2019}s just as bad. They would bore me to 
 death in two minutes. 

 Dawn had one brief against them, his father had another. 



 \x{201c}Anyway,\x{201d} Jessie was saying, trying, with the cigarette-holding hand, to stir 
 into being some sort of conclusion, \x{201c}that was why I went to school with my 
 horse.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}You went to school with a horse?\x{201d} 

 Again she impatiently pursed her lips, probably because this father, who thought 
 he was helping her out with his questions, was driving her even more rapidly 
 than usual to whatever collapse was in store. \x{201c}Yes. We both got on the train at 
 the same time,\x{201d} she told him. \x{201c}Wasn\x{2019}t I lucky?\x{201d} she asked, and to the surprise 
 of both Levov men, as though she weren\x{2019}t at all in serious straits\x{2014}as though 
 that was just a laughable illusion that disgustingly self-satisfied sober people 
 persisted in having about drunks\x{2014}laid a flirtatious hand on the side of Lou 
 Levov\x{2019}s head. 

 \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry, I don\x{2019}t understand how you got on the train with a horse. How big

 university professor but also because Lou Levov\x{2014}wrongly, though the Swede 
 pretended not to care\x{2014}credited Barry Umanoff with getting Seymour to lay down 
 his baseball glove and enter the business. Every summer Lou reminded Barry\x{2014}
 \x{201c}Counselor\x{201d} as he\x{2019}d been calling him since high school\x{2014}of the good deed Barry 
 had done for the Levov family by the example of his professional seriousness, 
 and Barry would say that, if he\x{2019}d been one-hundredth the ballplayer the Swede 
 was, nobody would have gotten him near a law school. 

 It was Barry and Marcia Umanoff with whom Merry had stayed overnight a couple of 
 times in New York before the Swede finally forbade her going into New York at 
 all, and it was Barry from whom the Swede had sought legal advice after Merry\x{2019}s 
 disappearance from Old Rimrock. Barry took him to meet Schevitz, the Manhattan 
 litigator. When the Swede asked Schevitz to level with him\x{2014}what was the worst 
 that could be laid on his daughter if she was apprehended and found guilty?\x{2014}he 
 was told, \x{201c}Seven to ten years.\x{201d} \x{201c}But,\x{201d} said Schevitz, \x{201c}if it\x{2019}s done in the 
 passion of the antiwar movement, if it\x{2019}s done accidentally, if everything was 
 done to try to prevent anyone from getting hurt\x{2026} And do we know she did it 
 alone? We don\x{2019}t. Do we even know she did it? We don\x{2019}t. No significant political 
 history, a lot of rhetoric, a lot of violent rhetoric, but is this a kid who, on 
 her own, would kill someone deliberately? How do we know she made the bomb or 
 set the bomb? To make a bomb you have to be fairly sophisticated\x{2014}could this kid 
 light a match?\x{201d} \x{201c}She was excellent in science,\x{201d} the Swede said. \x{201c}For 

 \x{b7} 338 \x{b7} 



 her chemistry project she got an A.\x{201d} \x{201c}Did she make a bomb for her chemistry 
 project?\x{201d} \x{201c}No, of course not\x{2014}no.\x{201d} \x{201c}Then we don\x{2019}t know, do we, whether she could 
 light a match or not. It might have been all rhetoric to her. We don\x{2019}t know what 
 she did and we don\x{2019}t know what she meant to do. We don\x{2019}t know anything and 
 neither does anyone else. She could have won the Westinghouse Science Prize and 
 we wouldn\x{2019}t know. What can be proved? Probably very little. The worst, since you 
 ask me, is <<seven to ten|10a:1>>. But let\x{2019}s assume she\x{2019}s treated as a juvenile. Under 
 juvenile law she gets <<two to three|10a:1>>, and even if she pleads guilty to something, 
 the record is sealed and nobody can get at it. Look, it all depends on her role 
 in the homicide. It doesn\x{2019}t have to be too bad. If the kid will come in, even if 
 she did have something to do with it, we might get her off with practically 
 nothing.\x{201d} And until a few hours ago\x{2014}when he\x{2019}d learned that on the Oregon commune 
 making bombs was her specialty, when from her own unstuttering mouth he heard 
 that it was not a single possibly accidental death for which she was responsible 
 but the coldhearted murder of four people\x{2014}Schevitz\x{2019}s words were sometimes all he 
 had to keep him from giving up hope. This man did not deal in fairy tales. You 
 could see that as soon as you walked into his office. Schevitz was somebody who 
 liked to be proved right, somebody whose wish to prevail was his vocation. Barry 
 had made it clear beforehand that Schevitz was not a guy interested in making 
 people feel good. He was not addressing the Swede\x{2019}s yearnings when he said, If 
 the kid will come in we might get her off. But this was back when they thought

 \x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t know about it. I found out later that night. But when she came to me 
 she was just beside herself. She was upset and I didn\x{2019}t know why. I thought 
 something had happened at home.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}But you knew within the next few hours. How long was she with you? Two days, 
 three days?\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}<<Three|9k:0>>. She left on the third day.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}So you knew what happened.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}I found out later. I couldn\x{2019}t believe it, but\x{2014}\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}It was on television.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}But she was in my house by then. I had already promised her that I would help 
 her. And that there was no problem she could tell me that I couldn\x{2019}t keep to 
 myself. She asked me to trust her. That was before I watched the news. How could 
 I betray her then? I\x{2019}d been her therapist, she\x{2019}d been my client. I\x{2019}d always

 \x{201c}I\x{2019}m her father.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}You\x{2019}re her father and she blew up a building. What good was it going to do

 \x{201c}She\x{2019}s a very strong girl.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}Strong enough to look after herself in the world? No!\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}Turning her over to you wasn\x{2019}t going to help any. She wasn\x{2019}t going to sit and

 \x{201c}It was your duty to tell me that she came to your house.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}I just thought that would make it easier for them to find her. She\x{2019}d come so 
 far, she\x{2019}d gotten so much stronger, I thought that she could make it on her own. 
 She is a strong girl, Seymour.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}She\x{2019}s a crazy girl.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}She\x{2019}s troubled.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}Oh, Christ! The father plays no role with the troubled daughter?\x{201d}

 \x{201c}I should have seen her? Where do you think she\x{2019}d been? It was your

 father more. And you\x{2019}re telling me she never needed him less. You made a 
 terrible error. I hope you know it. A terrible, terrible error.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}What could you have done for her then? What could anyone have done for her 
 then?\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}I deserved to know. I had a right to know. She\x{2019}s a minor. She\x{2019}s my daughter. 
 You had an obligation to get to me.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}My first obligation was to her. She was my client.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}She was no longer your client.\x{201d} 

 \x{201c}She had been my client. A very special client. She\x{2019}d come so far. My first

 Yes.

 Yes. We\x{2019}ll be what my mother calls once-a-year Catholics.

 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO CHRISTMAS? 

 When the child\x{2019}s small we can just go to the Mass where they sing all the 
 Christmas carols. You have to be there when they sing all the Christmas carols. 
 Otherwise it\x{2019}s not worth it. You hear the Christmas carols on the radio, but in 
 church they won\x{2019}t give you the Christmas carols until Jesus is born. 

 i don\x{2019}t care about that, those carols don\x{2019}t interest 

 ME ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. HOW MANY DAYS IS THIS GOING TO GO ON AT CHRISTMAS? 

 Well, there\x{2019}s Christmas Eve. There\x{2019}s <<Midnight|13>> Mass. <<Midnight|13>> Mass is a High 
 Mass\x{2014} 

 i don\x{2019}t know what that means, i don\x{2019}t want to. i\x{2019}ll

 improbable it is that we do come from one another. Birth, succession, the 
 generations, history\x{2014}utterly improbable. 

 He had seen that we don\x{2019}t come from one another, that it only appears that we 
 come from one another. 

 He had seen the way that it is, seen out beyond the number four to all there is 
 that cannot be bounded. The order is minute. He had thought most of it was order 
 and only a little of it was disorder. He\x{2019}d had it backwards. He had made his 
 fantasy and Merry had unmade it for him. It was not the specific war that she\x{2019}d 
 had in mind, but it was a war, nonetheless, that she brought home to America\x{2014}
 home into her very own house.
