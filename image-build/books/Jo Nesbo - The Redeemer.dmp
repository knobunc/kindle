the concert. On the other hand, what difference did the number of
police make? He was invisible. Even more invisible than usual. Pleased
with himself, he cast his eyes around the auditorium. How many
hundreds of men were here in dinner suits? He could already imagine
the chaos. And the simple but effective getaway. He had popped in the
day before and found the escape route. The last thing he did before
entering this evening was to check no one had locked the windows in
the Gents. The plain, frosted windows could be pushed outwards and
were large enough and low enough for a man to escape onto the ledge
outside without any problems. From there it was a jump of three metres
onto one of the car roofs in the parking lot. Then on with the coat,
into busy Haakon VII\'s gate and two minutes and forty seconds of rapid
walking later he would be on the platform of the National Theatre
