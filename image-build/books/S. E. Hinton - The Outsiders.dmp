I had cried, too, if you want to know the truth, because Soda never really wanted anything except a horse, and he\'d lost his. Soda had been twelve then, going-on-thirteen. He never let on to Mom and Dad how he felt, though, because we never had enough money and usually we had a hard time making ends meet. When you\'re thirteen in our neighborhood you know the score. I kept saving my money for a year, thinking that someday I could buy Mickey Mouse back for Soda. You\'re not so smart at <<ten|9c:0>>.',

Except for Darry, who was too proud of his athletic health to risk a cigarette, we had all started smoking at an early age. Johnny had been smoking since he was nine; Steve started at <<eleven|9c:0>>. So no one thought it unusual when I started.

Darry had cooked dinner: baked chicken and potatoes and corn--- two chickens because all three of us eat like horses. Especially Darry. But although I love baked chicken, I could hardly swallow any. I swallowed five aspirins, though, when Darry and Soda weren\'t looking. I do that all the time because I can\'t sleep very well at night. Darry thinks I take just one, but I usually take four. I figured five would keep me going through the rumble and maybe get rid of my headache.',

The doctor came in a while ago but I knew anyway. I keep getting tireder and tireder. Listen, I don\'t mind dying now. It\'s worth it. It\'s worth saving those kids. Their lives are worth more than mine, they have more to live for. Some of their parents came by to thank me and I know it was worth it. Tell Dally it\'s worth it. I\'m just going to miss you guys. I\'ve been thinking about it, and that poem, that guy that wrote it, he meant you\'re gold when you\'re a kid, like green. When you\'re a kid everything\'s new, dawn. It\'s just when you get used to everything that it\'s day. Like the way you dig sunsets, Pony. That\'s gold. Keep that way, it\'s a good way to be. I want you to tell Dally to look at <<one|9c:0>>. He\'ll probably think you\'re crazy, but ask for me. I don\'t think he\'s ever really seen a sunset. And don\'t be so bugged over being a greaser. You still have a lot o f time to make yourself be what you want. There\'s still lots of good in the world. Tell Dally. I don\'t think he knows. Your buddy, Johnny.',
