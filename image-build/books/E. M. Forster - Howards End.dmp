Brahms, for all his grumbling and grizzling, had never guessed what it felt like to be suspected of stealing an umbrella. For this fool of a young man thought that she and Helen and Tibby had been playing the confidence trick on him, and that if he gave his address they would break into his rooms some <<midnight|13>> or other and steal his walking-stick too. Most ladies would have laughed, but Margaret really minded, for it gave her a glimpse into squalor. To trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge; the poor cannot afford it. As soon as Brahms had grunted himself out, she gave him her card and said: \x{201c}That is where we live; if you preferred, you could call for the umbrella after the concert, but I didn\x{2019}t like to trouble you when it has all been our fault.\x{201d}",

Not that a visit to the office cleared things up. There was just the ordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished counters and brass bars that began and stopped for no possible reason, of electric-light globes blossoming in triplets, of little rabbit-hutches faced with glass or wire, of little rabbits. And even when she penetrated to the inner depths, she found only the ordinary table and Turkey carpet, and though the map over the fireplace did depict a helping of West Africa, it was a very ordinary map. Another map hung opposite, on which the whole continent appeared, looking like a whale marked out for blubber, and by its side was a door, shut, but Henry\x{2019}s voice came through it, dictating a \x{201c}strong\x{201d} letter.

In the morning Henry went to the business, and his sandwich\x{2014}a relic this of some prehistoric craving\x{2014}was always cut by her own hand. He did not rely upon the sandwich for lunch, but liked to have it by him in case he grew hungry at <<eleven|9c:1>>.

Her conscience pricked her a little about the Basts; she was not sorry to have lost sight of them. No doubt Leonard was worth helping, but being Henry\x{2019}s wife, she preferred to help someone else. As for theatres and discussion societies, they attracted her less and less. She began to \x{201c}miss\x{201d} new movements, and to spend her spare time rereading or thinking, rather to the concern of her Chelsea friends. They attributed the change to her marriage, and perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than was inevitable.

It may be unbalanced to fly out of England, but to stop away eight months argues that the heart is awry as well as the head. A sick-bed could recall Helen, but she was deaf to more human calls; after a glimpse at her aunt, she would retire into her nebulous life behind some poste restante.
