But as the body was lifted out he saw that it was a body \x{2013} that the fellow was dead \x{2013} and he tells me that the notion of foul play did enter his mind. He called two firemen to stand by where the thing had happened \x{2013} fortunately it was right in the back row \x{2013} and then he came straight up to me. I gave instructions for the body to be brought in here and for the police to be called up at once. Then I went in to see how it was with the seats where the thing had happened. The row immediately in front was full. But the dead man\x{2019}s seat was, of course, still empty, and so was one seat on his right and three on his left.

In the space in his new diary appropriate to Thursday \x{2013} the day, that was to say, on which he had died \x{2013} the prospective tutor had written the words gun for boy <<1.15|5a:0>>. This might, of course, refer to some quite inexpensive weapon \x{2013} say, an air-gun of one of the well-known popular makes. But against this reading there had to be set one of the two entries immediately preceding; the one that read N I police re guns etc. The suggestion here of Customs regulations to be complied with, as also the season of the year, pointed to substantial designs upon the game birds of Ireland. The probability, then, seemed clear. The eminent scientist had delegated the new tutor to buy the boy a shot-gun.",

            "Neither of these entries seemed very hopeful. The second appeared to be a mere memorandum, casually written, of how the latter part of the proposed journey was to be accomplished. One does not reserve seats, or book ahead, on an Irish light railway. There was nothing, then, in this, except a general pointer to a certain tract of country. Nor did the first of the entries suggest anything in the nature of preliminary correspondence; it was merely a reminder of certain formalities to be complied with \x{2013} formalities, Cadover suspected, which, during a tourist season, might not be very strictly maintained. What the entry did give was this: that the \x{2018}Ireland\x{2019} referred to in the dead man\x{2019}s letter to Miss Vane did in fact mean Eire and not Northern Ireland. It was for the purpose of taking guns into Eire \x{2013} or rather of being permitted ultimately to take them out again \x{2013} that some application was necessary or desirable to the Northern Ireland police. Here too Cadover set certain inquiries on foot. Then he turned to the final entry \x{2013} the one which had already been prominently in his mind.
gun for boy <<1.15|5a:1>>
One did not note in quite this way an intention to hand over a gun; the reference must definitely be to acquiring one. And if the figures represented a time of day \x{2013} as almost certainly they did \x{2013} then there was surely some significance to be attached to them. A <<quarter past one|10>> is a slightly out of the way time to go buying an article the choice of which requires considerable deliberation. It means either an unusually early luncheon or an uncomfortably delayed one. But the fact that the entry was for the previous day suggested an obvious reason for this. The dead man\x{2019}s programme had been full. And if written out it would have read something like: meet boy \x{2013} quick luncheon \x{2013} buy gun \x{2013} Metrodrome in time for Plutonium Blonde \x{2013} Irish boat train. For the letter to Miss Vane, it had to be remembered, definitely named Thursday as the young man\x{2019}s proposed day of departure with his pupil.

Where had it been, this last-moment purchase, while the people who had bought it were in the cinema? There seemed to be two possible answers. Either it had been sent to some private address in order to be put with other baggage, or it had been sent to a railway terminus to await the travellers there. And if Cadover was right in thinking that no journey to Ireland could well have taken place, then, in the latter eventuality, the gun might be in some railway \x{2018}left luggage\x{2019} room still. There was a fair line of investigation in this, but it was one in which success would probably come more quickly at any other season of the year. Guns, in the second week of August, were decidedly on the move. It was true that King\x{2019}s Cross and Euston no longer presented the spectacle \x{2013} astonishing to the itinerant foreigner caught in the whirl \x{2013} of a whole social class equipped with such weapons, and migrating, together with an infinitude of crates, hampers, trunks, upper servants, and privileged dogs, to the remoter corners of the kingdom.

            "Gun for boy <<1.15|5a:0>>. The man who made this confident note could not have been on any sort of waiting list for a suitable weapon, since his engagement to accompany a pupil to Ireland had not been more than a few days old. It was, of course, conceivable that he was somewhere the particularly privileged sort of customer for whom wanted articles are, in fact, produced. Alternatively, he might simply have chanced to know that some acquaintance of his own had an appropriate gun to dispose of. This second possibility Cadover eyed askance for a moment; it would be a circumstance that would pretty well destroy such hopefulness as there was in this approach to the case. But the tutor\x{2019}s likeliest manner of proceeding, after all, lay yet to explore; and Cadover sent for a file of recent newspapers. \x{2018}Articles for Sale\x{2019} was his quarry, and he kept a particularly sanguine eye upon the personal column of The Times once more.

As he had anticipated, a substantial \x{2013} yet not too substantial \x{2013} body of people had been holding themselves out of late as having sporting guns to dispose of. To question them meant another pilgrimage much like that of the previous evening, and Cadover debated whether to put a team of men on the work.

Here was almost certainly the man whose name Captain Peter Cox, not many days before being shot in the Metrodrome Cinema, had confided to his pocket diary.

Walking behind Humphrey, and glancing at his watch by the last clear light from the open sky, he saw that in just eight minutes\x{2019} time the boy was to be kidnapped. His tutor \x{2013} and the world, should it be disposed to inquire \x{2013} might believe for a time that he had run away to sea. His father might guess the whole truth if he had a mind to. But the boy himself must guess no more than half of it \x{2013} and, in a manner, events had conspired to just this end. Humphrey, returned crumpled and scared to the paternal roof in so many days\x{2019} time \x{2013} or weeks, if that were needed \x{2013} must have no story other than that of his brutal snatching from kindly relatives in Ireland. The crux of the plan lay in that. And did not this unexpected complication of rivals at the game, although it introduced a fresh hazard formidable enough \x{2013} marvellously second what was aimed at? Something had happened on the Heysham train; something more had happened on the light railway \x{2013} yes, and something yet further at Killyboffin Hall in the small hours. And in none of these things was a Bolderwood implicated or implicatable. Decidedly it all went well. And Ivor smiled to himself in the growing darkness \x{2013} unconscious of his father, at this very moment (the girl at the telephone-exchange having consented to begin her day\x{2019}s duties), listening to calamity on the line from London; unconscious of Bolderwood Hump, of gun for boy <<1.15|5a:1>>, of the fact that the late husband of the indigent Mrs Standage had once coxed an eight at Cambridge, of the outraged moral feelings of Soapy Clodd, of Detective-Inspector Cadover now grim and silent in a police car hurrying out to Croydon.

The operation was not exacting, and it need hardly be said that he performed it in almost complete absence of mind. His chief concern \x{2013} apart from the almost intolerable one of simply waiting \x{2013} was to decide whether the situation demanded any immediate initiative on his own part. By this he meant, say, action within the next half-hour. For it was quite clear to him (and he marvelled, indeed, that it was not quite clear to his host) that the sensational situation now admitted and to be faced decidedly forbade the whole morning\x{2019}s passing without the taking of some quite obvious steps. He himself, he saw, had been extraordinarily obtuse; but he was by no means now \x{2013} as the elder Mr Bolderwood appeared to be \x{2013} markedly confused and dilatory. His initiation into the guardianship of Humphrey had been, thanks to the boy\x{2019}s seemingly bizarre behaviour at Euston, a matter of wild and blundering suspicions; from this he had passed into a phase of stubborn scepticism; and that phase his host, until not much more than a few minutes ago, had sustained him in with what might appear, to a scrutiny more leisured than that which Mr Thewless now commanded, a positively mysterious answering obtuseness. But the events of the night had constituted a fence stiffer than any reassuring interpretation could readily take. And Mr Bolderwood, after what appeared in the retrospect a merely muddled endeavour to do so, had come round \x{2013} dramatically and, to Mr Thewless\x{2019} recollection, upon no fresh presentation of argument or evidence \x{2013} to the view that Humphrey was, and had been, very startlingly in danger. This being so, certain necessities were clear. The police must be told, and their protection claimed \x{2013} a proceeding that doubtless involved calling upon forces considerably more substantial than the hamlet of Killyboffin could provide. If there was likely to be delay here, the making of some immediate appeal was only the more desirable. And, again, Sir Bernard Paxton must be communicated with at once. And this in particular, Mr Thewless thought, was his own responsibility. Only it raised one issue the undetermined nature of which would sound awkwardly on a trunk-line to London.
