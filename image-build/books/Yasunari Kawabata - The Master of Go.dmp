            '"The invincible Master" lost his final championship match, and at Mr. Kawabata\'s hands the defeat becomes the defeat of a tradition. It is the aristocratic tradition which, until <<1945|9n:0>>, was the grounding for morals and ethics in Japan, and for the arts as well. Just as Mr. Kawabata would have nothing of jingoistic wartime hysteria, so he would have nothing of the platitudinous "democracy" and "liberalism" of the postwar years. He was not prepared to turn his back on what was for him the essence of Japan. One was puzzled to know why the flamboyant Mishima Yukio and the quiet, austere Kawabata should have felt so close to each other. Perhaps a part of the secret lies in the aristocratic tendencies the two men shared.',

A further refinement was hit upon: to seal the last play. Go took its example from chess, which had first devised the sealed play. The purpose was to eliminate the manifest irrationality of allowing the first player at the beginning of a session, having seen the last play, the whole of the recess, and it could be several days, in which to deliberate his next play, and of not charging the prolonged interval against his allotted time.',

I could not see the lines on the palms of the small hands he held lightly clasped behind him, but the network of veins seemed to be complex and delicate. He was carrying a folded fan. His body, bent forward from the hips, was perfectly straight, making his legs seem all the more unreliable. From below the thicket of dwarf bamboo, along the main road, came a sound of water down a narrow ditch. Nothing more - and yet the retreating figure of the Master somehow brought tears to my eyes.
