He bought it four years ago. He and Mrs Manderson have since spent a part of each summer there. Last night he went to bed <<about half-past eleven|10>>, just as usual. No one knows when he got up and left the house. He was not missed until this morning. <<About ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> his body was found by a gardener. It was lying by a shed in the grounds. He was shot in the head, through the left eye. Death must have been instantaneous. The body was not robbed, but there were marks on the wrists which pointed to a struggle having taken place. Dr Stock, of Marlstone, was at once sent for, and will conduct the post-mortem examination. The police from Bishopsbridge, who were soon on the spot, are reticent, but it is believed that they are quite without a clue to the identity of the murderer. There you are, Figgis. Mr Anthony is expecting you. Now I must telephone him and arrange things.\x{2019}",

In his case the colloquialism must be taken literally: he really was thinking about breakfast, as he thought about every conscious act of his life when time allowed deliberation. He reflected that on the preceding day the excitement and activity following upon the discovery of the dead man had disorganised his appetite, and led to his taking considerably less nourishment than usual. This morning he was very hungry, having already been up and about for an hour; and he decided to allow himself a third piece of toast and an additional egg; the rest as usual.

I shouldn\x{2019}t wonder,\x{2019} he added, \x{2018}if the traditional notions about loss of temperature and rigour after death had occasionally brought an innocent man to the gallows, or near it. Dr Stock has them all, I feel sure; most general practitioners of the older generation have. That Dr Stock will make an ass of himself at the inquest, is almost as certain as that tomorrow\x{2019}s sun will rise. I\x{2019}ve seen him. He will say the body must have been dead about so long, because of the degree of coldness and rigor mortis. I can see him nosing it all out in some textbook that was out of date when he was a student. Listen, Murch, and I will tell you some facts which will be a great hindrance to you in your professional career. There are many things that may hasten or retard the cooling of the body. This one was lying in the long dewy grass on the shady side of the shed. As for rigidity, if Manderson died in a struggle, or labouring under sudden emotion, his corpse might stiffen practically instantaneously; there are dozens of cases noted, particularly in cases of injury to the skull, like this one. On the other hand, the stiffening might not have begun until eight or ten hours after death. You can\x{2019}t hang anybody on rigor mortis nowadays, inspector, much as you may resent the limitation. No, what we can say is this. If he had been shot after the hour at which the world begins to get up and go about its business, it would have been heard, and very likely seen too. In fact, we must reason, to begin with, at any rate, on the assumption that he wasn\x{2019}t shot at a time when people might be awake; it isn\x{2019}t done in these parts. Put that time at <<6.30 a.m.|2a>> Manderson went up to bed at <<11 p.m.|5>>, and Martin sat up till <<12.30|9c:1>>. Assuming that he went to sleep at once on turning in, that leaves us something like six hours for the crime to be committed in; and that is a long time. But whenever it took place, I wish you would suggest a reason why Manderson, who was a fairly late riser, was up and dressed at or before <<6.30|9c:1>>; and why neither Martin, who sleeps lightly, nor Bunner, nor his wife heard him moving about, or letting himself out of the house. He must have been careful. He must have crept about like a cat. Do you feel as I do, Murch, about all this; that it is very, very strange and baffling?\x{2019}",

It seemed to me as if a faint light was beginning to creep over the whole expanse of my mind, as it does over land at dawn, and that presently the sun would be rising. I set myself to think over, one by one, the points that had just occurred to me, so as to make out, if possible, why any man masquerading as Manderson should have done these things that Manderson would not have done.",

This point, however, attracted no attention. Marlowe had an absolutely air-tight alibi in his presence at Southampton by <<6.30|3:1>>; nobody thought of him in connection with a murder which must have been committed after 12.30\x{2014}the hour at which Martin the butler had gone to bed. But it was the Manderson who came back from the drive who went out of his way to mention Southampton openly to two persons. He even went so far as to ring up a hotel at Southampton and ask questions which bore out Marlowe\x{2019}s story of his errand. This was the call he was busy with when Martin was in the library.",

If Manderson was in the house that night, and if he did not leave it until some time <<after 12.30|5a:1>>, Marlowe could not by any possibility have had a direct hand in the murder. It is a question of the distance between Marlstone and Southampton. If he had left Marlstone in the car at the hour when he is supposed to have done so\x{2014}between 10 and 10.30\x{2014}with a message from Manderson, the run would be quite an easy one to do in the time. But it would be physically impossible for the car\x{2014}a 15 h.p. four-cylinder Northumberland, an average medium-power car\x{2014}to get to Southampton by <<half-past six|10>> unless it left Marlstone by <<midnight|13>> at latest.

Martin would have been in bed by that time. I might have been heard to leave, but not seen.
