roaring and rattling noises from a couple of earth-moving machines that were
levelling a slope beyond the back gardens of a dotted line of cottages. Here,
perhaps in early 1984 if the present rate of progress was maintained, a row of
houses was to be built, though I could not imagine what sort of person was
going to be forced to live in them. The village itself looked as if it had been
uninhabited for some weeks. A mail van coated with dust stood outside the
corner shop, its driver more than just possibly in the arms of the
postmistress, a middle-aged spinster people said was a funny sort and who
certainly had two illegitimate children as well as an authentic bedridden
mother. Everywhere else, if not actually dead, they were brooding about their
wheat, dimly contemplating the afternoon milking, hoping on the whole that it
would be fine for the Saturday cricket match against Sandon, dropping tea-bags
into the pot, playing with the baby, asleep. Rural life is a mystery until one
realizes that nearly all of it, everywhere in the world, is spent in preparing
for and recovering from short but punishing bouts of the tedium inseparable
