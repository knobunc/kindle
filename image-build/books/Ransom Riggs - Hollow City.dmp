            "We tiptoed around the hollow\x{2019}s reeking carcass. Charged down the mountain as fast as we could, given the limits of the treacherous path and Bronwyn\x{2019}s volatile cargo. Once we\x{2019}d reached flat land we were able to follow our own tracks back through the squishy moss of the forest floor. We found the lake again just as the sun was setting and bats were screeching out of their hidden roosts. They seemed to bear some unintelligible warning from the world of night, crying and circling overhead as we splashed through the shallows toward the stone giant. We climbed up to his mouth and pitched ourselves down his throat, then swam out the back of him into the instantly cooler water and brighter light of <<midday|13>>, September 1940.",

I scanned the forest constantly, afraid that at any moment the wights and their dogs would burst out and attack us. But for hours we didn\x{2019}t see anyone\x{2014}not a wight, not even another traveler. It was as if we\x{2019}d arrived in an abandoned country.",
