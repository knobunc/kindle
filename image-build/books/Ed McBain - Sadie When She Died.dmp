            "\x{201c}Oh, yeah, yeah,\x{201d} Phil said, \x{201c}terrible the way things are getting in this city, ain\x{2019}t it? Even when I was a kid, things wasn\x{2019}t this terrible. I was born over on the South Side, you know, in a neighborhood where if you wore shoes you were considered a sissy. We were all the time fighting with the wop gangs, you know? We used to drop things down on them from the rooftops. Bricks, eggs, scrap iron, a toaster one time\x{2014}yeah, I swear to God, we once threw my mother\x{2019}s old toaster off the roof, bang, it hit one of them wops right on the head, bad place to hit a wop, of course, never does him no damage there. What I\x{2019}m saying, though, is it never was so bad like it is now. Even when we were beating up the wops all the time, and them vice versa, it was fun, you know what I mean? I mean, it was fun in those days. Nowadays, what happens? Nowadays, you step in the elevator, there\x{2019}s some crazy dope fiend, he shoves a gun under your nose and says he\x{2019}ll blow your head off it you don\x{2019}t give him all your money. That happened to Dr. Haskins, you think I\x{2019}m kidding? He\x{2019}s coming home <<three o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>, he goes in the elevator and Max is out taking a leak, so it\x{2019}s on self-service. Only there\x{2019}s a guy in the elevator, God knows how he even got in the building, probably came down from the roof, they jump rooftops like mountain goats, them dope fiends, and he sticks the gun right up under Dr. Haskins\x{2019} nose, right here, right pointing up his nostrils, for Christ\x{2019}s sake, and he says, Give me all your money and also whatever dope you got in that bag. So Dr. Haskins figures What the hell, I\x{2019}m going to get killed here for a lousy forty dollars and two vials of cocaine, here take it, good riddance. So he gives the guy what he wants, and you know what the guy does, anyway? He beats up Dr. Haskins. They had to take him to the hospital with seven stitches, the son of a bitch split his forehead open with the butt of the pistol, he pistol-whipped him, you know? What kind of thing is that, huh? This city stinks, and especially this neighborhood. I can remember this neighborhood when you could come home three, four, five, even <<six o\x{2019}clock in the morning|6>>, who cared what time you came home; you could be wearing a tuxedo and a mink coat, who cared what you were wearing, your jewels, your diamond cuff links, nobody bothered you. Try that today. Try walking down the street after dark without a Doberman pinscher on a leash, see how far you get. They smell you coming, these dope fiends, they leap out at you from doorways. We had a lot of burglaries in this building, all dope fiends. They come down from the roof, you know? We must\x{2019}ve fixed that lock on the roof door a hundred times, what difference does it make? They\x{2019}re all experts, as soon as we fix it, boom, it\x{2019}s busted open again. Or they come up the fire escapes, who can stop them? Next thing you know, they\x{2019}re in some apartment stealing the whole place, you\x{2019}re lucky if they leave your false teeth in the glass. I don\x{2019}t know what this city\x{2019}s coming to, I swear to God. It\x{2019}s disgraceful.\x{201d}",

In Riverhead.Q: Will you relate to us, please, the events that took place on the night of December twelfth. That would be last night, Mr. Corwin, Sunday, December twelfth.A: Where do you want me to start?Q: Did you enter a building at <<721|3:1>> Silvermine Oval?A: I did.Q: How did you enter the building?A: First I went down the steps from the street, where the garbage cans were. I went in the basement, and through the basement and up the steps at the other end, into the backyard. Then I climbed up the fire escape.Q: What time was this?A: I went in the building at <<about ten o\x{2019}clock|6>>.Q: Ten P . M .?A: Yes, ten P . M .Q: What did you do then?A: I went in an apartment.Q: Which apartment?A: Second-floor rear.Q: Why did you go into the apartment?A: To rip it off.Q: To burglarize it?A: Yes.Q: Had you ever been in this building before?A: No. I never done nothing like this in my life before. Never. I\x{2019}m a junkie, that\x{2019}s true, but I never stole nothing in my life before this. Nor hurt nobody, either. I wouldn\x{2019}t have stole now except this girl I was living with left me, and I was desperate. She used to give me whatever bread I needed. But she left me. Friday. She just walked out.Q: Which girl is that?A: Do we have to drag her in? She\x{2019}s got nothing to do with it. She never done me no harm, I got no hard feelings toward her, even though she walked out. She was always good to me. I don\x{2019}t want to drag her name in this.Q: You say you had never been in this building before?A: Never.Q: Why did you pick this particular apartment to enter?A: It was the first one I saw without no lights inside. I figured there was nobody home.Q: How did you get into the apartment?A: The kitchen window was open a tiny crack. I squeezed my fingers under the bottom of it, and opened it all the way.Q: Were you wearing gloves?A: No.Q: Why not?A: I don\x{2019}t have no gloves. Gloves cost money. I\x{2019}m a junkie.Q: Weren\x{2019}t you afraid of leaving fingerprints?A: I figured that was crap. For the movies, you know? For television. Anyway, I don\x{2019}t have no gloves, so what difference does it make?Q: What did you do after you opened the window?A: I stepped in the sink, and then down to the floor.Q: Then what?A: I had this little flashlight. So I used it to find my way across the kitchen to the dining room.Q: Would you look at this photograph, please?A: Yeah?Q: Is this the kitchen you were in?A: I don\x{2019}t know. It was dark. I guess it could be. I don\x{2019}t know.Q: What did you do in the dining room?A: I found where they kept the silverware, and I emptied the drawer and put the stuff in this airlines bag I had with me. I had to go to Chicago last month because my father died, so I went by plane, and I bought this little airlines bag. My girlfriend paid for me to fly out there. She was a great girl, I wish I could figure why she left. I wouldn\x{2019}t be in this trouble now, if she\x{2019}d stayed, you know that? I never stole nothing in my life, nothing, I swear to God. And I never hurt nobody. I don\x{2019}t know what got into me. I must\x{2019}ve been scared out of my wits. That\x{2019}s the only thing I can figure.Q: Where did you go when you left the dining room?A: I was looking for the bedroom.Q: Was the flashlight on?A: Yeah. It\x{2019}s just this little flashlight. A penlight is what they call them. A tiny little thing, you know? So you can have some light.Q: Why were you looking for the bedroom?A: I figured that\x{2019}s where people leave watches and rings, stuff like that. I was going to take whatever jewelry I could find and then get out. I\x{2019}m not a pro, I was just hung up real bad and needed some bread to tide me over.Q: Did you find the bedroom?A: I found it.Q: What happened?A: There was a lady in bed. This was only like close to <<ten-thirty|5k:1>>, you don\x{2019}t expect nobody to be asleep so early, you know what I mean? I thought the apartment was empty.Q: But there was a woman in bed.A: Yeah. She turned on the light the minute I stepped in the room.Q: What did you do?A: I had a knife in my pocket. I pulled it out.Q: Why?A: To scare her.Q: Would you look at this knife, please?A: Yeah, it\x{2019}s mine.Q: This is the knife you took from your pocket?A: Yeah. Yes.Q: Did the woman say anything to you?A: Yeah, it was almost comical. I mean, when I think back on it, it was comical, though at the time I was very scared. But it was like a movie, you know? Just like a movie. She looks at me and she says \x{201c}What are you doing here?\x{201d} Which is funny, don\x{2019}t you think? I mean, what did she think I was doing there?Q: Did you say anything to her?A: I told her to keep quiet, that I wasn\x{2019}t going to hurt her.Q: Then what?A: She got out of bed. Not all the way, she just threw the covers back, and swung her legs over the side, you know? Sitting, you know? I didn\x{2019}t realize what was happening for a minute, and then I saw she was reaching for the phone. That\x{2019}s got to be crazy, right? A guy is standing there in your bedroom with a knife in his hand, so she reaches for the phone.Q: What did you do?A: I grabbed her hand before she could get it. I pulled her off the bed, away from the phone, you know? And I told her again that nobody was going to hurt her, that I was getting out of there right away, to just please calm down.Q: You said that?A: What?Q: You asked her to calm down?A: I don\x{2019}t know if those were the exact words, but I told her like to take it easy because I could see she was getting hysterical.Q: Would you look at this photograph, please? Is this the bedroom you were in?A: Yeah. There\x{2019}s the night table with the phone on it, and there\x{2019}s the window I went out. That\x{2019}s the room.Q: What happened next?A: She started to scream.Q: What did you do when she screamed?A: I told her to stop. I was beginning to panic by now. I mean, she was really yelling.Q: Did she stop?A: No.Q: What did you do?A: I stabbed her.Q: Where did you stab her?A: I don\x{2019}t know. It was a reflex. She was yelling, I was afraid the whole building would come down. I just\x{2026} I just stuck the knife in her. I was very scared.Q: Did you stab her in the chest?A: No.Q: Where?A: The belly. Someplace in the belly.Q: How many times did you stab her?A: Once. She\x{2026} she backed away from me, I\x{2019}ll never forget the look on her face. And she\x{2026} she fell on the floor.Q: Would you look at this photograph, please?A: Oh, Jesus.Q: Is that the woman you stabbed?A: Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus, I didn\x{2019}t think\x{2026} oh, Jesus.Q: Is that the woman?A: Yes. Yes, that\x{2019}s her. Yes.Q: What happened next?A: Can I have a drink of water?Q: Get him a drink of water. You stabbed her, and she fell to the floor. What happened next?A: There was\x{2026}Q: Yes?A: There was somebody at the door. I heard the door opening. Then somebody came in.Q: Came into the apartment?A: Yes. And yelled her name.Q: From the front door?A: I guess. From someplace at the other end of the apartment.Q: Called her name?A: Yeah. He yelled, \x{201c}Sarah!\x{201d} and when he got no answer, he yelled, \x{201c}Sarah, it\x{2019}s me, I\x{2019}m home.\x{201d}Q: Then what?A: I knew I was trapped. I couldn\x{2019}t go out the way I come in because this guy was home. So I ran past the\x{2026} the woman where she was laying on the floor\x{2026} Jesus\x{2026} and I tried to open the window, but it was stuck. So I smashed it with the airlines bag and\x{2026} I didn\x{2019}t know what to do\x{2026} I was on the second floor, how was I going to get out? I threw the bag down first because I figured no matter what happened I was going to need bread for another fix, and then I climbed through the broken window\x{2014}I cut my hand on a piece of glass\x{2014}and I hung down from the sill, scared to let go, and finally I let go, I had to let go.Q: Yes?A: I must\x{2019}ve dropped a mile, it felt like a mile. The minute I hit, I knew I busted something. I tried to get up, and I fell right down. My ankle was killing me, my hand was bleeding. I must\x{2019}ve been in that alley ten, fifteen minutes, trying to stand up, falling down, trying again. I finally made it. I finally got out of that alley.Q: Where did you go?A: Through the basement and up to the street. The way I come in.Q: And where did you go from there?A: I took the subway home. To Riverhead. I turned on the radio right away to see if there was anything about\x{2026} about what I done. But there wasn\x{2019}t. So I tried to go to sleep, but the ankle was very bad, and I needed a fix. I went to see Dr. Mendelsohn in the morning because I figured it was like life or death, you know what I mean? If I couldn\x{2019}t get around, how was I going to make a connection?Q: When did you visit Dr. Mendelsohn?A: Early. <<Nine o\x{2019}clock|6>>. Nine A . M .Q: Is he your family physician?A: I never saw him before in my life. He\x{2019}s around the corner from where I live. That\x{2019}s the only reason I picked him, because he was close. He strapped up the ankle, but it didn\x{2019}t do no good. I still can\x{2019}t walk on it, I\x{2019}m like a lousy cripple. I told him to bill me for it. I was going to pay him as soon as I got some bread. That\x{2019}s why I gave him my right name and address. I wasn\x{2019}t going to cheat him. I\x{2019}m not that kind of person. I know that what I done is bad, but I\x{2019}m not a bad person.Q: When did you learn that Mrs. Fletcher was dead?A: I bought a newspaper on the way home from the doctor\x{2019}s. The story was in it. That\x{2019}s when I knew I killed her.Q: You did not know until then?A: I did not know how bad it was.",
