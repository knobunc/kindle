endured a hell of sympathy, all of it well intentioned, and most of it doing
little more than smooth the rough edges of his resentment. Protestations of
eternal loyalty had flowed across the post office counter, whilst all that had
flowed from area headquarters was a series of faxed instructions advising him
of the arrangements for Mr Marshall\x{2019}s arrival on October the first. There was
really nothing he could do other than accept the tide of commiseration and
