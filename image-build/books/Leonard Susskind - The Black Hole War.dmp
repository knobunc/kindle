The audience included a number of extremely accomplished physicists, including Steven Weinberg, Willy Fischler, Joe Polchinski, Bryce DeWitt, and Claudio Teitelboim, all of whom have made major contributions to the theory of gravity. I was quite interested in their views, so at the end of the lecture, I took a poll of the audience. If my memory serves me right, Fischler, DeWitt, and Teitelboim held the minority view, that information is not lost. Polchinski was convinced by Hawking\x{2019}s arguments and voted with the majority. Weinberg abstained. The overall vote was <<about three to one|10>> in favor of Hawking, but there was a noticeable reluctance on the part of the audience members to commit themselves.",

Newton had one lucky break in working out the consequences of his theory: the special mathematical properties of the inverse square law. When you weigh yourself, some of the gravitational force pulling you toward the Earth is due to mass just beneath your feet, some is due to mass deep within the Earth, and some comes from the antipodal point eight thousand miles away.
