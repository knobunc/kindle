Either way, she knew now, there was no use baring the metal casings of the lock or the lock\x{2019}s tongue. She knew that she could not excavate the hinges from the wood, either. But it had occurred to her that the door was paneled. The three sunken panels were surely made of thinner wood. What if she could cut through enough so that a hard kick, say, could break off one piece, another, more and more? The vision of success was clear in her imagination. This was the thing to do. And not with the nail file. In that medicine cabinet there was a packet of razor blades.",
