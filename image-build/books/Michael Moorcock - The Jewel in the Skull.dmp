            '\'True,\' Count Brass agreed. He looked up at the large wall clock that hung over the fireplace. Its golden hands showed <<eleven o\'clock|6>>. Its huge pendulum swung slowly back and forth, casting a flickering shadow on the wall. It began to strike. \'We go to our beds early in Castle Brass,\' the count said casually. \'We live the lives of country folk, I am afraid.\' He rose from his chair. \'I will have a servant show you to your chambers. Your men have been placed in rooms adjoining the main suite.\'',

            'Hawkmoon had been mistaken in thinking Granbretan would reach the borders in half a day. They had decided to camp before marching on, and it was not until <<noon|13>> of the following day that the Kamargians saw the force approach, moving over the flat plain in a spread-out formation. Each square of infantry and cavalry was made up of a particular Order, each member of the Order pledged to defend every other member whether that member was alive or dead. This system was part of Granbretan\'s great strength, for it meant that no man ever retreated unless specifically ordered to do so by his Grand Constable.',

            'The flamingo was surprisingly easy to ride, as Count Brass had assured him it would be. It responded to commands in the manner of a horse, by means of the reins attached to its curved beak, and was so graceful that never once did Hawkmoon fear falling. In spite of the bird\'s refusal to fly when it rained, it carried him ten times more swiftly than a horse, needing to rest only for a short time at <<midday|13>> and sleeping, like Hawkmoon, at night. The high, soft saddle, with its curved pommel, was comfortable, and from it hung panniers of provisions. A harness secured Hawkmoon in this saddle. Its long neck stretched straight before it and its great wings beating slowly, the scarlet bird bore him over mountains, valleys, forests, and plains. Hawkmoon always tried to let the bird come down near rivers or lakes where it could find food to its liking.',
