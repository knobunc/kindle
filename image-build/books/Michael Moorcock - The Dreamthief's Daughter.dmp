            "I decided to take on the Nazi hierarchy more directly, since I know them all so well from my research into my Holocaust series about Colonel Pyat (Byzantium Endures, etc.). I had already introduced the theme in the DC graphic novel Multiverse. In that I have an albino von Bek thwarting Hitler by a peculiar, roundabout ruse. Again the story was based on my own very close research. I haven\x{2019}t read any other books on Hitler or his times which have done this kind of research. I have a habit of using mostly contemporary accounts, mostly by disaffected Nazis who wrote before <<1938|9c:0>>. There were plenty of people telling what was actually going on in Nazi Germany. It wasn\x{2019}t a story the public in general wanted to hear just then. . . .",

These proud nationalists were the ones who supplied the rhetoric which, by <<1920|9n:0>>, was fueling what would be the Nazi and Bolshevik movements, admittedly towards rather different ends. Germany defeated, impoverished, shamed.',

            'In the years before <<1933|9c:0>>, a small division of self-titled Freikorps, made up mostly of unemployed ex-soldiers commanded by NCOs who had given themselves the rank of captain or higher, paraded occasionally through the streets. They were not based in Bek, where I refused to allow any such goings-on, but in a neighboring city. They had too many rivals in the city to contend with, I suspect, and felt more important showing their strength to a town of old people and children, which had lost most of its men.',

Our constitution was no more than a piece of paper, burning amongst great, inspired books, by Mann, Heine, Brecht, Zweig and Remarque, which the Nazis heaped in blazing pyres at crossroads and in town squares. An act they termed \x{201c}cultural cleansing.\x{201d} It was the triumph of ignorance and bigotry.",

The same is true in England. Arthur had more Camelots than Mussolini has titles. They\x{2019}re all nineteenth-century inventions. Part of the Gothic revival. The Romantic movement. A nation reinventing herself. You must know of half-a-dozen such family legends. Wolfram von Eschenbach claimed it was granite. Few can be traced much <<past 1750|18:0>>. I can imagine, too, that with your recruitment of Wagner to the Nazi cause, your Leader has need of such symbols, but if we did have an old goblet it has long since gone from here.\x{201d}",

After about two months of this, I was summoned from my cell one day by SA Hauptsturmf\x{fc}hrer Hahn whom we\x{2019}d come to fear, especially when he was accompanied, as now, by <<two|9:0>> uniformed thugs we knew as Fritzi and Franzi, since one was tall and thin while the other was short and fat. They reminded us of the famous cartoon characters. Hahn looked like most other SA officers, with a puffy face, a toothbrush mustache, a plug of a nose and two or three tiny receding chins. All he lacked to make him identical to his leader R\x{f6}hm were the hideous scarred face and the rapacious proclivities which would make men hide their sons when he and his gang came to town.",

            "The b\x{fc}rgermeister\x{2019}s house had a relief depicting a lion attacking a mother and her child while two men vainly tried to frighten the creature away. The house known as Old Lemgo was festooned with plant patterns of every possible description, but the most elaborate house of all, I remembered, was called the Hexenb\x{fc}rgermeisterhaus, the sixteenth-century House of the Mayor of the Witches in Breitestrasse. I glimpsed it as the car moved quietly through the sleeping streets. Its massive front rose gracefully in scalloped gables to the niche at the top where Christ held the world in his hands, while further down Adam and Eve supported another gable. Every part of the woodwork was richly and fancifully carved. A quintessentially German building. Its sweetness, however, was marred a little when you knew that its name came from the famous witch-burner, B\x{fc}rgermeister Rothmann. In 1667 he had burned twenty-five witches. It was his best year. The previous b\x{fc}rgermeister had burned men as well as women, including the pastor of St. Nicholas\x{2019}s Church. Other pastors had fled or been driven from the town. The fine house of the hangman in Neuestrasse was inscribed with some pious motto. He had made a fat living killing witches. I could not help feeling that this place was somehow symbolic of the New Germany with its sentimentality, its folklore versions of history, its dark hatred of anything which questioned its cloying dreams of hearth and home. The town would never have seemed sinister to me before <<1933|9c:0>>. What should have been innocent nostalgia had become, in the present context, threatening, corrupted romanticism.",
