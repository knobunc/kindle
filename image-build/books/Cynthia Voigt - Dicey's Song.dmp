Thick roots spread around her, making a kind of chair for her to lean on. She wore only shorts in the hot <<midday|13>> air. Her arms and chest were spattered and streaked with red paint, and the barn was completely painted, top to bottom, all four sides, patched and painted and looking good. The paint and sweat were drying on Dicey\x{2019}s body. She could hear the buzzing of insects and nothing else. For once she was alone, but she knew where everybody was.",
