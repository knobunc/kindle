At, or a little after, <<ten o\x{2019}clock|6>> there had been a quarrel between deceased and the Duke of Denver, after which deceased had left the house never to be seen alive again. They had the evidence of Mr Pettigrew-Robinson that the Duke had gone downstairs at <<11.30|9c:1>>, and that of Colonel Marchbanks that he had been heard immediately afterwards moving about in the study, the room in which the revolver produced in evidence was usually kept. Against this they had the Duke\x{2019}s own sworn statement that he had not left his bedroom till <<half-past two in the morning|10>>. The jury would have to consider what weight was to be attached to those conflicting statements. Then, as to the shots heard in the night; the gamekeeper had said he heard a shot at <<ten minutes to twelve|10>>, but he had supposed it to be fired by poachers. It was, in fact, quite possible that there had been poachers about. On the other hand, Lady Mary\x{2019}s statement that she had heard the shot at <<about three a.m.|9h>> did not fit in very well with the doctor\x{2019}s evidence that when he arrived at Riddlesdale at <<4.30|3:1>> deceased had been already three or four hours dead. They would remember also that in Dr Thorpe\x{2019}s opinion, death had not immediately followed the wound. If they believed this evidence, therefore, they would have to put back the moment of death to between <<eleven p.m.|5>> and <<midnight|13>>, and this might very well have been the shot which the gamekeeper heard. In that case they had still to ask themselves about the shot which had awakened Lady Mary Wimsey. Of course, if they liked to put that down to poachers, there was no inherent impossibility.",

            "They next came to the body of deceased, which had been discovered by the Duke of Denver at <<three a.m.|5>> lying outside the door of the small conservatory, near the covered well. There seemed little doubt, from the medical evidence, that the shot which killed deceased had been fired in the shrubbery, about seven minutes\x{2019} distance from the house, and that the body of deceased had been dragged from that place to the house. Deceased had undoubtedly died as the result of being shot in the lungs. The jury would have to decide whether that shot was fired by his own hand or by the hand of another; and, if the latter, whether by accident, in self-defence, or by malice aforethought with intent to murder. As regards suicide, they must consider what they knew of deceased\x{2019}s character and circumstances. Deceased was a young man in the prime of his strength, and apparently of considerable fortune. He had had a meritorious military career, and was liked by his friends. The Duke of Denver had thought sufficiently well of him to consent to his own sister\x{2019}s engagement to deceased. There was evidence to show that the fianc\x{e9}s, though perhaps not demonstrative, were on excellent terms. The Duke affirmed that on the Wednesday night deceased had announced his intention of breaking off the engagement. Did they believe that deceased, without even communicating with the lady, or writing a word of explanation or farewell, would thereupon rush out and shoot himself? Again, the jury must consider the accusation which the Duke of Denver said he had brought against deceased. He had accused him of cheating at cards. In the kind of society to which the persons involved in this inquiry belonged, such a misdemeanour as cheating at cards was regarded as far more shameful than such sins as murder and adultery. Possibly the mere suggestion of such a thing, whether well-founded or not, might well cause a gentleman of sensitive honour to make away with himself. But was deceased honourable? Deceased had been educated in France, and French notions of the honest thing were very different from British ones. The Coroner himself had had business relations with French persons in his capacity as a solicitor, and could assure such of the jury as had never been in France that they ought to allow for these different standards. Unhappily, the alleged letter giving details of the accusation had not been produced to them. Next, they might ask themselves whether it was not more usual for a suicide to shoot himself in the head. They should ask themselves how deceased came by the revolver. And, finally, they must consider, in that case, who had dragged the body towards the house, and why the person had chosen to do so, with great labour to himself and at the risk of extinguishing any lingering remnant of the vital spark,* instead of arousing the household and fetching help.",

But to Lord Peter the world presented itself as an entertaining labyrinth of side-issues.

He had been seen at <<half-past twelve|10>> on a Sunday morning walking in Hyde Park in a top-hat and frock-coat, reading the News of the World.

            "\x{2018}On the evening of Wednesday, October 13th, I went upstairs at <<half-past nine|10>>. I sat up writing a letter. At a <<quarter past ten|10>> I heard my brother and Denis quarrelling in the passage. I heard my brother call Denis a cheat, and tell him that he was never to speak to me again. I heard Denis run out. I listened for some time, but did not hear him return. At <<half-past eleven|10>> I became alarmed. I changed my dress and went out to try and find Denis and bring him in. I feared he might do something desperate. After some time I found him in the shrubbery. I begged him to come in. He refused, and he told me about my brother\x{2019}s accusation and the quarrel. I was very much horrified, of course. He said where was the good of denying anything, as Gerald was determined to ruin him, and asked me to go away and marry him and live abroad. I said I was surprised that he should suggest such a thing in the circumstances. We both became very angry. I said \x{201c}Come in now. Tomorrow you can leave by the first train.\x{201d} He seemed almost crazy. He pulled out a pistol and said that he\x{2019}d come to the end of things, that his life was ruined, that we were a lot of hypocrites, and that I had never cared for him, or I shouldn\x{2019}t have minded what he\x{2019}d done. Anyway, he said, if I wouldn\x{2019}t come with him it was all over, and he might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb \x{2013} he\x{2019}d shoot me and himself. I think he was quite out of his mind. He pulled out a revolver; I caught his hand; we struggled; I got the muzzle right up against his chest, and \x{2013} either I pulled the trigger or it went off itself \x{2013} I\x{2019}m not clear which. It was all in such a whirl.\x{2019}",

Its most cheerful member, despite a throbbing shoulder and a splitting headache, was undoubtedly Lord Peter himself, who lay upon the chesterfield surrounded with cushions and carousing upon tea and toast. Having been brought home in an ambulance, he had instantly fallen into a healing sleep, and had woken at <<nine o\x{2019}clock|6>> aggressively clear and active in mind. In consequence, Mr Parker had been dispatched in a hurry, half-fed and burdened with the secret memory of last night\x{2019}s disclosures, to Scotland Yard.

Besides, if you must run off to town, why do it in that unfinished manner? If you had only looked up the trains before starting, you would have seen you would have half an hour\x{2019}s wait at Northallerton, and you could quite easily have packed a bag. It\x{2019}s so much better to do things neatly and thoroughly \x{2013} even stupid things. And it was very stupid of you indeed to dash off like that, to embarrass and bore poor Mr Parker with a lot of twaddle \x{2013} though I suppose it was Peter you meant to see. You know, Peter, if you will haunt low places full of Russians and sucking Socialists taking themselves seriously, you ought to know better than to encourage them by running after them, however futile, and given to drinking coffee and writing poems with no shape to them, and generally ruining their nerves. And in any case, it makes not the slightest difference; I could have told Peter all about it myself, if he doesn\x{2019}t know already, as he probably does.\x{2019}",
