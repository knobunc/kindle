prowling cats, fluttering newspapers and derelict banana skins to attract the haut
monde. Dukes avoid it, marquises give it a wide berth, earls and viscounts
would not settle there if you paid them. It consists of some seedy offices and
a block of residential flats, Halsey Chambers, which are occupied mostly by
young men of slender means who cannot afford to pick and choose and are
thankful to have an inexpensive roof over their heads. Jeff Miller, the writer
of novels of suspense, lived there at <<one|9b>> time; so did Jerry Shoe-smith, editor
until his services were dispensed with of the weekly paper Society Spice; and

but he did. Where most of his contemporaries had long ago thrown in the towel
and retired to cure resorts to nurse their gout, he had gone blithely on, ever
rising on stepping stones of dead whiskies and sodas to higher things. He had
discovered the prime grand secret of eternal youth \x{2014} to keep the decanter
circulating, to stop smoking only when snapping the lighter for his next
cigarette and never to retire to rest before <<three in the morning|5>>.",

Emsworth was naturally astounded to see Gally. He was sitting in the lounge
when Gally reached Barribault\x{2019}s Hotel, his long lean body draped like a wet
sock on a chair, and he appeared to be thinking of absolutely nothing. His mild
face wore the dazed look it always wore when he was in London, a city that
disturbed and bewildered him. Unlike his younger brother to whom it had always
been an earthly Paradise, he was allergic to England\x{2019}s metropolis and counted
each minute lost that he was obliged to spend there. He rose like a snake
hurriedly uncoiling itself and his pince-nez flew from his nose and danced at

octopus when he rode in any conveyance, and started on the homeward journey,
easing his way through the London traffic with practised skill. At <<five|9e>>, Beach,
ably assisted by two footmen, served tea in the amber drawing-room of Blandings
Castle, and the company awaiting the wanderer\x{2019}s return settled down to keep
body and soul together with buttered toast, cucumber sandwiches and cake. Lady
Hermione Wedge officiated at the tea pot. Colonel Egbert Wedge stood supporting
his shoulderblades against the mantelpiece over the fireplace. Dame Daphne
Winkworth sat very upright on what looked an uncomfortable chair and her son
Huxley perched on a footstool as near as he could get to the gate-leg table
where the food was. Wilfred Allsop was not present. He was making a point, when
possible, of avoiding Dame Daphne\x{2019}s society. Hers, as Gally had said, was a
formidable personality. It had been so even in her youth, and many years of
conducting a large school for girls had increased its intensity, giving her an
imperious air calculated to intimidate all but the toughest. The thought that
before many weeks had passed he would become a member of her staff, permanently
under that eye of hers, never failed to induce in Wilfred a sinking feeling.",

as I said to Hermione when I talked it over with her later? Singing? Reciting
Gunga Din? Not at all. It was just breathing and Clarence was listening to it \x{2014}

we coated a pig liberally with phosphorus and left it at his bedside at <<about
