            "My long in-and-out affair with Hollywood is perhaps rather an odd one. I don\x{2019}t know. When the job on The Big Sleep fell into my lap, out of the blue, and I was signed to a seven-year contract, everybody told me I had it made. I guess because I\x{2019}m half Scots and inclined to ca\x{2019} canny, I kept looking at the option clauses as much as I looked at the salary hikes that would have made me a junior-grade Croesus at the end of seven years. <<After two|9:0>>-and-a-half years the independent company which had signed me was dissolved for tax purposes, and I was dissolved with it, still somewhat short of my first million. My next job was on the B-lot at Columbia, where I did two scripts. The first one was a success, the second they washed out, and again, me with it. I don\x{2019}t think it was a bad script. But it was an off-beat story, and off-beat stories they did not want. So I had to go back to work, as it were. I hoped for another film job, but when it reached the point where the Guild was pleading with its members to write something, anything, even greeting-card verse, because there were no jobs to be had, I simply forgot about it. Since 1957 I\x{2019}ve worked quite a lot in films and television, but I\x{2019}ve never forgotten that early lesson: don\x{2019}t count on it. The bad thing about film or TV work is that you have to wait for someone to ask you to do it, whereas you can sit down and write a novel when and as you wish, and if you have a reasonable degree of competence you can be fairly sure of selling it somewhere. For that reason I have never felt like giving up my freedom of choice and relying entirely on Hollywood. Fairy gold is lovely when it comes, but if it doesn\x{2019}t, I\x{2019}ve got my workroom here in Kinsman, and no mortgages.",
