On either side, an army of shadows appeared\x{2014}more dark-winged arai, which Annabeth was not thrilled to see; a withered man who must have been Geras, the god of old age; and a younger woman in a black toga, her eyes gleaming and her smile like a serial killer\x{2019}s\x{2014}no doubt Eris, the goddess of strife. More kept appearing: dozens of demons and minor gods, each <<one|3d>> the spawn of Night.",

After our mom died, her parents (our grandparents) had this big court battle with Dad. <<After six|9:0>> lawyers, two fistfights, and a near fatal attack with a spatula (don\x{2019}t ask), they won the right to keep Sadie with them in England. She was only six, two years younger than me, and they couldn\x{2019}t keep us both\x{2014}at least that was their excuse for not taking me. So Sadie was raised as a British schoolkid, and I traveled around with my dad. We only saw Sadie twice a year, which was fine with me.",
