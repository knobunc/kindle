After our mom died, her parents (our grandparents) had this big court battle with Dad. <<After six|9:0>> lawyers, two fistfights, and a near fatal attack with a spatula (don\x{2019}t ask), they won the right to keep Sadie with them in England. She was only six, two years younger than me, and they couldn\x{2019}t keep us both\x{2014}at least that was their excuse for not taking me. So Sadie was raised as a British schoolkid, and I traveled around with my dad. We only saw Sadie twice a year, which was fine with me.",
