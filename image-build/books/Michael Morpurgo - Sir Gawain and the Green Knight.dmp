            "By this time, it was already close to <<midnight|13>>, and the chapel bells were ringing, calling them to Christmas evensong. The lord of the castle led Gawain to his place of honor in the chapel and presented him to his wife, who sat opposite him across the aisle. She was a woman of such perfect beauty that Gawain found it difficult to concentrate on his prayers at all, though he knew he had much to thank his Savior for that day. She\x{2019}s even more beautiful than Guinevere, Gawain thought, closing his eyes not so much to pray as to keep himself from gazing at her in wonder. But it was impossible not to look at her. When he glanced up again, he noticed at her side a much older lady, as warty and wrinkled as the ugliest toad that ever lived. A strange pair, Gawain thought: one a wretched old hag with an evil eye, a hairy chin and a warty nose, the other a paragon of beauty with a face like an angel. But I must not let my mind think on her any further. You\x{2019}re in a chapel, Gawain, and she\x{2019}s another man\x{2019}s wife.",
