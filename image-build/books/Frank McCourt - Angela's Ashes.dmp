            "A man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o\x{2019} God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won\x{2019}t know where they are and they\x{2019}ll be biting the mattress or each other,
which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They\x{2019}re a right bloody torment an\x{2019} I should know for didn\x{2019}t I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an\x{2019} the fleas there were so plentiful an\x{2019} forward they\x{2019}d sit on the toe of your boot an\x{2019} discuss Ireland\x{2019}s woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an\x{2019} I wouldn\x{2019}t put it past the English. An\x{2019} isn\x{2019}t it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an\x{2019} the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an\x{2019} have a good night\x{2019}s sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin\x{2019} no harm, they wouldn\x{2019}t bother you unless you cornered them an\x{2019} they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an\x{2019} such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin\x{2019} <<noon|13>> an\x{2019} night for that\x{2019}s his nature an\x{2019} he can\x{2019}t help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You\x{2019}re forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin\x{2019} here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus.",

If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he\x{2019}s not home when the Angelus rings at <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he\x{2019}ll never bring home anything because he\x{2019}d never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says \x{2019}tis all right for her to be begging at the St.Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can\x{2019}t stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it\x{2019}s different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you. When the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she\x{2019}ll brain him with the poker.",

She can\x{2019}t leave the fire and we can\x{2019}t leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we\x{2019}d have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely.

No, we can\x{2019}t move an inch till that telegram boy comes.

We don\x{2019}t have a thing to worry about till <<six|9f>>. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he\x{2019}ll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what \x{2019}tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul\x{2019} shit over in England that never sent a penny.

Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he\x{2019}s not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won\x{2019}t admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I\x{2019}m starting to forget it.

Aunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie\x{2019}s bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there\x{2019}s paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won\x{2019}t start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen.

In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper.

She\x{2019}ll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It\x{2019}s hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I\x{2019}m a man I won\x{2019}t go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there.
