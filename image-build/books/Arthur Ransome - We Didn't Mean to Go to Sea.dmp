On the hard, men were walking round a barge that had been afloat in the middle of the day, and were busy with scrapers and tar-brushes. A clock chimed <<six|11>> from among the trees on the further side of the river. The river, wide as it was, seemed almost narrow between the bare mudflats, but a tug, fussing down from Ipswich, set the moored yachts rocking as it passed.',

The head of the mainsail shook itself free of the mass of red canvas and began to climb the mast. It stuck. John was scrambling aft to cast off a tyer half way along the boom. Susan and Titty, ill as they were feeling, jumped to cast off other tyers close above their heads. The sail was all loose now, and a great fold of it suddenly filled with wind, billowed up, and flopped down again. John was hauling away again.
