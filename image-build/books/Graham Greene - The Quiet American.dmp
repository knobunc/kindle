The lamp lit her face as she tended the long pipe, bent over it with the serious attention she might have given to a child. I was fond of my pipe: more than two feet of straight bamboo, ivory at either end. Two-thirds of the way down was the bowl, like a convolvulus reversed, the convex margin polished and darkened by the frequent kneading of the opium. Now with a flick of the wrist she plunged the needle into the tiny cavity, released the opium and reversed the bowl over the flame, holding the pipe steady for me.

My colleagues\x{2014}except for the correspondent of the Extr\x{ea}me Orient, who called it an \x{2018}outrage\x{2019}\x{2014}knew they could only get space by making fun of the affair. \x{2018}Bicycle Bombs\x{2019} made a good headline. All of them blamed the Communists. I was the only one to write that the bombs were a demonstration on the part of General Th\x{e9}, and my account was altered in the office. The General wasn\x{2019}t news. You couldn\x{2019}t waste space by identifying him. I sent a message of regret through Dominguez to Mr Heng\x{2014}I had done my best. Mr Heng sent a polite verbal reply. It seemed to me then that he\x{2014}or his Vietminh Committee\x{2014}had been unduly sensitive; no one held the affair seriously against the Communists. Indeed, if anything could have done so, it would have given them the reputation for a sense of humour. \x{2018}What\x{2019}ll they think of next?\x{2019} people said at parties, and the whole absurd affair was symbolized for me too in the bicycle-wheel gaily spinning like a top in the middle of the boulevard. I never even mentioned to Pyle what I had heard of his connection with the General. Let him play harmlessly with plastic moulds: it might keep his mind off Phuong. All the same, because I happened to be in the neighbourhood one evening, because I had nothing better to do, I called in at Mr Muoi\x{2019}s garage.",
