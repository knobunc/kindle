There were usually quite a few people around the crossroads on a fine evening, but most of them had gone into Eau Galle tonight to see the Medicine Show. Those who remained were people who wished they might go but were prevented from doing so, such as the little Hooper boys and old man Toomey, with the wooden leg, and the men who had to tend shop or forge. These remaining few came out and stood about the caravan in openmouthed amazement.",

            "The reason that Hetty took Minnie with her instead of Caddie or Clara or Tom or Warren had something to do with her own feeling of importance. At Aunt Molly\x{2019}s she was a tall, big girl named Henrietta. It was a new feeling for Hetty and one that she enjoyed. She could take little Minnie with her and still have that sense of being a superior person in a magical world. But if she had taken one of the older children, her instinct told her that even in Mrs. Nightingale\x{2019}s enchanted parlor she would, like Cinderella after the last stroke of <<midnight|12>>, have become once more plain Hetty Woodlawn.",

She had spent so much time here now that, if she did not get the hat with the red streamers, she would have to go home empty-handed. What would the other children say to that? Tomorrow was Joe\x{2019}s birthday, and they would never forgive her if they did not have a gift for him. Yet, if she went up to the auctioneer and asked him for a particular hat, he would be sure to see how much she wanted it and put a high price upon it. Oh, dear!
