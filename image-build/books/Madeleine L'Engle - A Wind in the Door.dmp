Eventually, <<after twenty-six|9:0>> rejections, I called my agent and said, \x{201c}Send it back. It\x{2019}s too different. Nobody\x{2019}s going to publish it.\x{201d} He sent it back, but a few days later a friend of my mother\x{2019}s insisted that I meet John Farrar,
the publisher. He liked the manuscript, and eventually decided to publish it. My first editor was Hal Vursell.",

She boarded the high-school bus as usual at <<seven o\x{2019}clock|6>>, in the grey, uninviting light of an early morning brewing a nor\x{2019}easter. The grade-school bus, which had not nearly so far to go, left an hour later. When the high-school bus made its first stop in the village she slipped off, and then walked the two miles to the grade school. It was an old, inadequate building, painted the traditional red, overcrowded and understaffed. It certainly did need upgrading, and taxes were being raised for a new school.",
