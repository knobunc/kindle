            "Mr. Justice Singleton got on famously with the airmen and other experts. On January 21 he presented me with his final report. It was most difficult to compare British and German air strengths in actual figures. Each side divided its air force into authorised establishments, total aircraft, \x{201c}operationally fit,\x{201d} and \x{201c}front line.\x{201d} These categories were different, arbitrary, and variable. Moreover, the Royal Air Force was divided between home and overseas, while at this moment the Germans were all at home. I do not therefore baffle the reader with disputable statistics. The Judge concluded that the strength of the German Air Force, compared with the British, might be taken as roughly <<four to three|10a:1>>. Although the Air Ministry (Intelligence) still thought the Germans had more and the Ministry of Economic Warfare that they had less, there was a considerable measure of agreement, and the Singleton estimate became our working basis. I was encouraged by his report, which showed that we were steadily overhauling the Germans in the air. At the beginning of the Battle of France they were at least more than double. Now they were reported as only <<four to three|10a:1>>. After the war we learnt that it was actually nearer <<three to two|10a:1>>. This was a great improvement. We had not yet reached our full rate of expansion, nor had we received the great wave of American help which was on the way.",

It was the most destructive attack of the whole night Blitz. Five docks and seventy-one key-points, half of which were factories, had been hit.

In other respects also it was historic. It destroyed the House of Commons. One single bomb created ruin for years. We were, however, thankful that the Chamber was empty.

            "Former Naval Person to President Roosevelt
17 May 41Foreign Office representative has had three interviews with Hess.At first interview, on night of May <<11-12|5a:1>>, Hess was extremely voluble, and made long statement with the aid of notes. First part recapitulated Anglo-German relations during past thirty years or so, and was designed to show that Germany had always been in the right and England in the wrong. Second part emphasised certainty of German victory, due to development in combination of submarine and air weapons, steadiness of German morale, and complete unity of German people behind Hitler. Third part outlined proposals for settlement. Hess said that the Fuehrer had never entertained any designs against the British Empire, which would be left intact save for the return of former German colonies, in exchange for a free hand for him in Europe. But condition was attached that Hitler would not negotiate with present Government in England. This is the old invitation to us to desert all our friends in order to save temporarily the greater part of our skin.Foreign Office representative asked him whether when he spoke of Hitler having a free hand in Europe he included Russia in Europe or in Asia. He replied, \x{201c}In Asia.\x{201d} He added, however, that Germany had certain demands to make of Russia which would have to be satisfied, but denied rumours that attack on Russia was being planned.Impression created by Hess was that he had made up his mind that Germany must win the war, but saw that it would last a long time and involve much loss of life and destruction. He seemed to feel that if he could persuade people in this country that there was a basis for a settlement, that might bring the war to an end and avert unnecessary suffering.At second interview, on fourteenth May, Hess made two further points:(1) In any peace settlement Germany would have to support Rashid Ali and secure eviction of British from Iraq.(2) U-boat war with air co-operation would be carried on till all supplies to these islands were cut off. Even if these islands capitulated and the Empire continued to fight, the blockade of Britain would continue, even if that meant that the last inhabitant of Britain died of starvation.At third interview, on May 15, nothing much emerged save incidentally some rather disparaging remarks about your country and the degree of assistance that you will be able to furnish to us. I am afraid, in particular, he is not sufficiently impressed by what he thinks he knows of your aircraft types and production.Hess seems in good health and not excited, and no ordinary signs of insanity can be detected. He declares that this escapade is his own idea and that Hitler was unaware of it beforehand. If he is to be believed, he expected to contact members of a \x{201c}peace movement\x{201d} in England, which he would help to oust the present Government. If he is honest and if he is sane this is an encouraging sign of ineptitude of German Intelligence Service. He will not be ill-treated, but it is desirable that the press should not romanticise him and his adventure. We must not forget that he shares responsibility for all Hitler\x{2019}s crimes and is a potential war criminal whose fate must ultimately depend upon the decision of the Allied Governments.Mr. President, all the above is for your own information. Here we think it best to let the press have a good run for a bit and keep the Germans guessing. The German officer prisoners of war here were greatly perturbed by the news, and I cannot doubt that there will be deep misgivings in the German armed forces about what he may say.Hess\x{2019}s own explanations to the doctors were hardly more illuminating. On May 22 his doctor reported as follows:",

Battles might be won or lost, enterprises might succeed or miscarry, territories might be gained or quitted, but dominating all our power to carry on the war, or even keep ourselves alive, lay our mastery of the ocean routes and the free approach and entry to our ports. I have described in the previous volume the perils which the German occupation of the coast of Europe from the North Cape to the Pyrenees brought upon us. From any port or inlet along this enormous front the hostile U-boats, constantly improving in speed, endurance, and radius, could sally forth to destroy our sea-borne food and trade. Their numbers grew steadily. In the first quarter of 1941 production of new craft was at the rate of ten a month \x{2013} soon afterward increased to eighteen a month. These included the so-called 500-ton and 740-ton types, the first with a cruising range of 11,000 miles and the latter of 15,000 miles.",

During their cruise of two months the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had sunk or captured twenty-two ships, amounting to 115,000 tons. Meanwhile the Hipper had fallen upon a homeward-bound Sierra Leone convoy near the Azores which had not yet been joined by an escort. In a savage attack lasting an hour she destroyed seven out of nineteen ships, making no attempt to rescue survivors, and regained Brest two days later. These were heavy losses for us, additional to the toll of the U-boat war. Moreover, the presence of these strong hostile vessels compelled the employment on convoy duty of nearly every available British capital ship.

            "We should assume an import of not less than 31,000,000 tons in 1941. On this basis food cannot be cut lower than 15,000,000 tons, and 1,000,000 is required for the Board of Trade. This leaves 15,000,000 for the Ministry of Supply, as against 19,000,000 to which they were working on the 35,000,000 programme. A cut of 4,000,000 has therefore to be made by the Ministry of Supply, for which a revised programme should be framed. Ferrous metals, timber, and pulp seem to offer the main field of reduction. As we can now buy steel freely in the United States, the keeping in being of the whole of the existing steel industry cannot be accepted as an indispensable factor. We must try to import in the most concentrated forms and over the shortest routes. This principle must also influence food imports.2. Should our total imports fall below 31,000.000, the deficit should for the present be met by the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Supply on the basis of one ton cut in food to two tons in supply. Should the imports exceed 31,000,000, the benefit will be shared in the same proportion. The position will be reviewed in the autumn, when this year\x{2019}s harvest is known.3. I have received from the War Office a reply to my notes about Army Scales, which they have had under consideration for three weeks. My notes do not look farther ahead than 1942, and must be subject to review in the light of events. My figure of \x{201c}about two millions\x{201d} may be interpreted as desired by the War Office at \x{201c}2,195,000 [men],\x{201d} for which the arrangements are completed. The War Office proposal to substitute for my figure of fifteen armoured divisions twelve armoured divisions and nine army tank brigades may be approved, and the target figure for the grand total of the Imperial Army in March, 1942, of fifty-nine and one third \x{201c}equivalent divisions\x{201d} may be accepted. The resultant saving on manpower intake from now to the end of 1942 is about 475,000. This saving, and the increase in armoured forces at the expense of infantry and artillery, should afford an important relief to the Ministry of Supply in hutments, clothing, and projectiles.4. The Purvis Programme, which was submitted to President Roosevelt in January to give him the general scale, may now be more precisely defined as the Ministry of Supply desire, and in so doing, if convenient, the adjustment may be made to cover the change in the proportion of armoured forces. However, it is important that no diminution should be made in anything we need and are likely to get from the United States; in particular, the equipment for the ten extra divisions should stand.5. The Naval Programme is the subject of a separate note, but the following principles which have a bearing on imports may be stated here.The remaining three King George V class battleships must be completed at full speed. The construction of Vanguard, which is the only capital ship which can reach us in 1943 and before <<1945|9c:0>>, is most desirable. One new monitor is also needed. No other heavy ships can be proceeded with at present, and no more armour-plate can be provided for other naval purposes for the next six months; nor should new armour-plate factories be laid down. This position will be reviewed on September 1 in the light of (a) the Battle of the Atlantic, (b) the relationship of the United States to the war.The requirements of the Admiralty for armour-plate must not exceed the 16,500 tons provided for 1941, nor the 25,000 tons for 1942. If these limits are observed, the Ministry of Supply should be able to execute the increased tank programme.6. The Ministries of Food and Agriculture should, upon the basis of 15,000,000 tons import in 1941, concert an eighteen months\x{2019} programme, drawing as may be necessary upon our meat reserves on the hoof to cover the next six months, but endeavouring to provide by concentrated imports the most varied dietary possible for the nation at war. By taking a period as long as eighteen months it should be possible to avoid hurried changes in policy, to use reserves as balancing factors, and to make the best use of the assigned tonnage.7. The British air power will continue to be developed to the utmost within the above limits and with the present priorities and assignments.When these precise instructions received the assent of the War Cabinet they were obeyed without demur by all concerned.",

The enemy\x{2019}s concern soon became to get them home; but even this they were unable to do until <<1942|9c:0>>. Hitler\x{2019}s plan for the invasion of Russia soon brought us much-needed respite in the air.

            "Prime Minister to General Ismay, for Chiefs of Staff
20 April 41See General Wavell\x{2019}s latest telegrams. The fate of the war in the Middle East, the loss of the Suez Canal, the frustration or confusion of the enormous forces we have built up in Egypt, the closing of all prospects of American co-operation through the Red Sea \x{2013} all may turn on a few hundred armoured vehicles. They must if possible be carried there at all costs.2. I will preside at <<noon|9a>> tomorrow (Monday), the twenty-first, at a meeting of C.O.S. and Service Ministers, and any necessary action or collection of information must proceed forthwith.3. The only way in which this great purpose can be achieved is by sending the fast mechanical transport ships of the fast section of [Convoy] W.S. 7 through the Mediterranean. General Wavell\x{2019}s telegram shows that machines, not men, are needed. The risk of losing the vehicles, or part of them, must be accepted. Even if half got through, the situation would be restored. The five M.T. ships carry 250 tanks, all but fourteen of which are \x{201c}I\x{201d} tanks. Every endeavour should be made to increase the numbers of cruiser tanks in this consignment. I am told twenty more can be loaded at a delay of perhaps twenty-four hours \x{2013} that is, M.T. convoy would sail on the morning of April 23.4. The personnel will go by the Cape, subject to any modifications which the C.I.G.S. may desire.5. I have asked the Ministry of Shipping to try to find two other M.T. ships of equal speed, without regard to other interests, by the date mentioned. If these are found, an additional hundred cruiser tanks should be taken from the best armoured division at home, assuming that they are fitted for tropical warfare, apart altogether from the special \x{201c}desert-worthy\x{201d} fittings.6. The Admiralty and Air Ministry will consider and prepare this day a plan for carrying this vital convoy through the Mediterranean. Of course, we must accept the risk, and no guarantee can be expected. Malta, however, should have been reinforced by then. The Mountbatten destroyers and other naval reinforcements should have reached there (or else be with the convoy). The enemy\x{2019}s dive-bombers have many other objectives, and they will not know what the convoy contains.7. Speed is vital. Every day\x{2019}s delay must be avoided. Let me have a time-table of what is possible, observing that at sixteen knots the distance is only about eight days \x{2013} say, ten \x{2013} from the date of sailing, namely, April 23. This would give General Wavell effective support during the first week in May. Secrecy is of the highest importance, and no one outside the highest circles need know of the intention to turn off at Gibraltar. Everyone on board the convoys must think they are going round the Cape.The Chiefs of Staff were assembled by the time Ismay reached London, and they discussed my minute until late into the night. Their first reactions to the proposals were unfavourable. The chances of getting the M.T. ships through the Central Mediterranean unscathed were not rated very high, since on the day before entering the Narrows and on the morning after passing Malta they would be subjected to dive-bombing attacks out of range of our own shore-based fighters. The view was also expressed that we were dangerously weak in tanks at home, and that if we now suffered heavy losses in tanks abroad there would be demands for their replacement, and consequently a further diversion of tanks from the home forces.",

The convoy, consisting of five fifteen-knot ships, escorted by Admiral Somerville\x{2019}s Force H (Renown, Malaya, Ark Royal, and Sheffield), passed Gibraltar on May 6. With it also were the reinforcements for the Mediterranean Fleet, comprising the Queen Elizabeth and the cruisers Naiad and Fiji. Air attacks on May 8 were beaten off without damage, seven enemy aircraft being destroyed. During that night, however, two ships of the convoy struck mines when approaching the Narrows. <<One|9k:0>>, the Empire Song, caught fire and sank after an explosion; the other, the New Zealand Star, was able to continue with the convoy. On reaching the entrance to the Skerki Channel, Admiral Somerville parted company and returned to Gibraltar. He detached six of his destroyers, with the cruiser Gloucester, to reinforce the convoy escort. In the afternoon of the ninth Admiral Cunningham, having seized the opportunity to pass a convoy into Malta, met the \x{201c}Tiger\x{201d} convoy with the fleet fifty miles south of Malta. All his forces then shaped their course for Alexandria, which they reached without further loss or damage. The opportunity was also taken during these operations to carry out two night bombardments of Benghazi with light naval forces on May 7 and 10.",

For an hour the surrounding positions were subjected to the heaviest bombing and machine-gunning hitherto experienced from the air. The bulk of our A.A. artillery was put out of action practically at once. Before the bombardment was over, gliders began to land west of the airfield. At <<8 A.M.|5>> parachutists were dropped in large numbers from heights varying from three hundred to six hundred feet, in the area between Maleme and Canea. One German regiment of four battalions in the morning, and a second in the afternoon, were thrown in by a continuous stream of aircraft, utterly regardless of losses to men and machines. They were resolutely encountered on and near the airfield by a battalion of the 5th New Zealand Brigade, with the rest of the brigade in support to. the eastward. Wherever our troops were noticed, they were subjected to tremendous bombardment, bombs of five hundred and even a thousand pounds being used in profusion. Counter-attacks were impossible in daylight. A counter-attack with only two \x{201c}I\x{201d} tanks proved a failure. Gliders or troop-carriers landed or crashed on the beaches and in the scrub or on the fireswept airfield. In all, around and between Maleme and Canea over five thousand Germans reached the ground on the first day. They suffered very heavy losses from the fire and fierce hand-to-hand fighting of the New Zealanders. In our defended area practically all who alighted were accounted for, most being killed. At the end of the day we were still in possession of the airfield, but that evening the few who were left of the battalion fell back on its supports. Two companies sent up to reinforce were too late to make a counter-attack for the airfield, which was still, however, under our artillery fire.",

Although Maleme airfield remained under our close artillery and mortar fire, troop-carriers continued to land upon it and in the rough ground to the west. The German High Command seemed indifferent to losses, and at least a hundred planes were wrecked by crash-landing in this area. Nevertheless, the build-up continued.

Our air reconnaissance had reported this fact to Admiral Cunningham, but it took more than an hour for this news to be confirmed to Rear-Admiral King. His ships had been under incessant air attack since daylight, and although they had hitherto suffered no damage all were running short of A.A. ammunition. Their combine speed was also reduced, as the Carlisle could steam no more than twenty-one knots.

Inflexibly resolved, whatever the cost, to destroy all seaborne invaders, Admiral Cunningham had indeed thrown everything into the scale. It is clear that throughout these operations he did not hesitate for this purpose to hazard not only his most precious ships, but the whole naval command of the Eastern Mediterranean. His conduct on this issue was highly approved by the Admiralty. In this grim battle the German command was not alone in playing the highest stakes.

Twenty minutes later the Gloucester, hit by several bombs, was brought to a full stop, badly on fire, and with her upper deck a shambles. The Fiji had no choice but to leave her, and, having lost contact with the Fleet and being short of fuel, she steered more directly towards Alexandria with her two destroyers. Three hours later, after surviving nearly twenty attacks by formations of bombers and having fired all her heavy A.A. ammunition, she fell a victim to an M.E.109 which approached unseen through the clouds. There was a heavy explosion. The ship took a list, but still made seventeen knots, until another attack came and three more bombs struck home.

Soon <<after 3 A.M.|5>> on the twenty-fifth the Suffolk suddenly and unexpectedly lost contact with the Bismarck. She had been shadowing by radar with skill from a position on the enemy\x{2019}s port quarter. All ships were now zigzagging as they moved south into waters infested by U-boats, and it was this which brought about the misfortune. At the end of each outward leg of her zigzag course the Suffolk lost radar contact, but regained it on the inward leg. Perhaps she was overconfident after such prolonged and successful shadowing. But now when she turned once more to the westward the enemy was no longer on the presumed course. Had he turned west or doubled back to the north and east? This caused the utmost anxiety and rendered all concentration futile. After making a cast to the westward at daylight the King George V turned eastward in the belief that the Bismarck was making towards the North Sea, and the whole British pursuit now trended in this direction. At the Admiralty there was a growing opinion that the Bismarck was steering for Brest, but it was not until <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> that this hardened. The Admiralty forthwith deflected all our forces towards the more southerly route. But meanwhile the confusion and delay arising from the loss of contact had enabled the Bismarck to slip through the cordon and gain a commanding lead in her race for safety. By <<11 P.M.|5>> she was already well to the eastward of the British flagship. She was short of oil through the leakage. The Rodney, with her sixteen-inch guns, still lay between her and home, but she too was moving to the northeastward and crossed ahead of the Bismarck during the afternoon. The day which had begun so full of promise ended in disappointment and frustration.

However, at <<10.30 A.M.|2a>>, just as hopes were beginning to fade, the Bismarck was found again. The Admiralty and Coastal Command were searching with Catalina aircraft working from Lough Erne in Ireland. One of these now located the fugitive steering towards Brest and still about seven hundred miles from home. The Bismarck damaged the aircraft and contact was lost. But within an hour two Swordfish from the Ark Royal spotted her once more. She was still well to the westward of the Renown and not yet within the German air cover radiating powerfully from Brest. The Renown, however, could not face her single-handed. It was necessary to await the arrival of the King George V and Rodney, both still far behind the chase. But now Captain Vian, of Altmark fame, still in the Cossack, with four other destroyers which had been escorting the troop convoy and had been ordered to leave it, received a signal from a Catalina aircraft which gave him the Bismarck\x{2019}s position.

As American aid grows, the enemy must be closely watching for a favourable opportunity to launch the campaign which might win him the war.2. German successes both in the Balkans and Libya, two widely different types of terrain, prove once again the paramountcy of armoured forces supported by a powerful air force. Throughout the war this combination has dominated every battlefield. The defence, since the points of attack cannot be foretold, must suffer the disadvantage of dispersion, and must depend primarily for its success upon the maintenance of large reserves of counter-attacking tanks, anti-tank weapons, and aircraft.3. The Chiefs of Staff, after exhaustive inquiry, recently calculated the scale of armoured attack on this country at six armoured divisions, a total of some 2400 tanks. In the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, with which I fully concur, a total of six armoured divisions and four army tank brigades (i.e., some 2600 tanks) are required to give security in Great Britain against this scale of attack. Of these, two armoured divisions and two army tank brigades would be disposed in each of the Eastern and Southeastern Commands for counter-attack against penetration through East Anglia and the Kent and Sussex coasts respectively. The other two armoured divisions would be in reserve, one being earmarked for use in the North.He then set forth the state of the armoured formations at home by June, 1941, showing that our total strength for home defence would be <<about 1250|18:0>> tanks, including 150 light, and 490 tanks in schools, etc., of which <<about 360|18:0>> would be fit for action at three weeks\x{2019} notice.

11 Aug. 41Have reached satisfactory settlement about Naval Plan Number 4 [the United States Navy to take over the America-Iceland stretch of the Atlantic].Secondly, President is prepared to take very helpful action corresponding with, or consequent upon, Operation \x{201c}Pilgrim.\x{201d}Thirdly, he intends to negotiate with Japan on the basis of a moratorium for, say, a month, during which no further military movements are to be made by Japan in Indo-China and no encroachment upon Siam. He has agreed to end his communication with a severe warning, which I drafted\x{2026}.Fourthly, the President wishes to issue at the moment of general release of meeting story, probably 14th or 15th, a Joint Declaration, signed by him and me on behalf of His Majesty\x{2019}s Government, of the broad principles which animate the United States and Great Britain at this favourable time. I send you herewith his draft of the statement, which you will see is not free from the difficulties attaching to all such declarations. The fourth condition would evidently have to be amended to safeguard our obligations contracted in Ottawa and not prejudice the future of Imperial Preference. This might fall into its place after the war in a general economic settlement, with decisive lowering of tariffs and trade barriers throughout the world. But we cannot settle it now. For the sake of speedy agreement I have little doubt he will accept our amendments.The seventh paragraph is most remarkable for its realism. The President undoubtedly contemplates the disarmament of the guilty nations, coupled with the maintenance of strong united British and American armaments both by sea and air for a long indefinite period.Having regard to our views about the League of Nations or other international organisations, I would suggest the following amendment after the word \x{201c}essential\x{201d}: \x{201c}pending the establishment of a wider and more permanent system of general security.\x{201d}He will not like this very much, but he attaches so much importance to the Joint Declaration, which he believes will affect the whole movement of United States opinion, that I think he will agree.It would be most imprudent on our part to raise unnecessary difficulties. We must regard this as an interim and partial statement of war aims designed to assure all countries of our righteous purpose, and not the complete structure which we should build after victory.You should summon the full War Cabinet, with any others you may think necessary, to meet tonight, and please let me have your views without the slightest delay. Meanwhile full accounts are being sent you immediately on the other points, together with Cadogan\x{2019}s report of the conversation. I fear the President will be very much upset if no Joint Statement can be issued, and grave and vital interests might be affected.I had purposed to leave afternoon 12th, but we have both now postponed departure twenty-four hours.I had only finished dictating the telegrams <<about 2 P.M.|5>>, and that I should have had in my hands within the next twelve hours the War Cabinet\x{2019}s most helpful reply reflects credit on all concerned. I subsequently learned that my telegrams had not reached London until <<after midnight|13>>, and that many of the Ministers had already gone to bed. Nevertheless, a War Cabinet meeting was summoned for <<1.45 A.M.|2a>>, and there was a full attendance, including Mr. Peter Fraser, Prime Minister of New Zealand, who was in England at the time. As a result of a full discussion they sent me a telegram <<just after 4 A.M.|10>>, welcoming the proposal and suggesting a further version of Point 4 (non-discrimination in world trade) and the insertion of a new paragraph dealing with social security. Meanwhile I had heard that the President had accepted all the amendments I had suggested to him on August 11.",

6 Oct. 41I am glad to learn from Lord Beaverbrook of the success of the Tripartite Conference at Moscow. Bis dat qui cito dat. We intend to run a continuous cycle of convoys, leaving every ten days. Following are on the way and arrive Archangel October 12: 20 heavy tanks; 193 fighters (pre-October quota).Following will sail October 12, arriving October 29: 140 heavy tanks; 100 Hurricanes; 200 Bren carriers; 200 anti-tank rifles and ammunition; 50 2-pounder guns and ammunition.Following will sail October 22: 200 fighters; 120 heavy tanks.Above shows the total of the October quota of aircraft, and 280 tanks will arrive Russia by November 6. The October quota of Bren carriers, anti-tank rifles, and 2-pounder anti-tank guns will all arrive in October. Twenty tanks have been shipped to go via Persia, and fifteen are about to be shipped from Canada via Vladivostok. The total tanks shipped will therefore be 315, which is <<19|9d>> short of our full quota. This number will be made up in November. The above programme does not take into account supplies from United States.2. In arranging this regular cycle of convoys we are counting on Archangel to handle the main bulk of deliveries. I presume this part of the job is in hand. Good wishes.Although General Ismay was fully empowered and qualified to discuss and explain the military situation in all its variants to the Soviet leaders, Beaverbrook and Harriman decided not to complicate their task by issues on which there could be no agreement. This aspect was not therefore dealt with in Moscow. Informally the Russians continued to demand the immediate establishment of the Second Front, and seemed quite impervious to any arguments showing its impossibility. Their agony is their excuse. Our Ambassador had to bear the brunt.',

The loss of Crete deprived Admiral Cunningham\x{2019}s fleet of a fuelling base near enough to bring our protecting sea power into action. The possibilities of a seaborne assault on Malta from Italy or Sicily grew, though, as we now know, it was not <<until 1942|18:0>> that Hitler and Mussolini approved such a plan. Enemy air bases both in Crete and Cyrenaica menaced the convoy route from Alexandria to Malta so seriously that we had to depend entirely on the West for the passage of supplies. In this task Admiral Somerville, with Force H from Gibraltar, rendered distinguished service. The route the Admiralty had judged the more dangerous became the only one open. Fortunately at this time the demands of his Russian invasion compelled Hitler to withdraw his air force from Sicily, which gave a respite to Malta and restored to us the mastery in the air over the Malta Channel. This not only helped the approach of convoys from the West, but enabled us to strike harder at the transports and supply ships reinforcing Rommel.",

            "13. All my information goes to show that a victory in Cyrenaica of the British over the Germans will alter the whole shape of the war in the Mediterranean. Spain may be heartened to fight for her neutrality. A profound effect may be produced upon the already demoralised Italy. Perhaps, most important of all, Turkey may be consolidated in her resistance to Hitler. We do not require Turkey to enter the war aggressively at the present moment, but only to maintain a stolid, unyielding front to German threats and blandishments. As long as Turkey is not violated or seduced, this great oblong pad of poorly developed territory is an impassable protection for the eastern flank of our Nile Army. If Turkey were forced to enter the war, we should of course have to give her a great deal of support which might be better used elsewhere, either in French North Africa or in the Caucasus. We are making promises of support to Turkey (contingent on the military situation) which amount to between four and six divisions and twenty or thirty air squadrons, and we are actively preparing with them the necessary airfields in Anatolia. But what Turkey requires to keep her sound is a British victory over Germans, making all promises real and living.14. These dispositions, as I have set them out, do not allow us in the next six months to make any serious contribution to the Russian defence of the Caucasus and Caspian Basin. The best help we can give the Russians is to relieve the five Russian divisions now crowded into Northern Persia. If these are brought home and used in the battle, I have pledged the faith of Britain to Stalin that no rightful Russian interest shall suffer and that we will take no advantages in Persia at their expense. I do not however see how, in the period mentioned, we can put more than a symbolic force into the Caucasus and the Russians retain a similar representation in Persia. The Russians much disturb Persia by their presence, their theories, and their behaviour, and the outbreak of disorders would mean that we should have to spread three or four British-Indian divisions to keep open the communications from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian. These communications, which are a vital part of our joint aid to Russia policy, would thus be largely choked by the need of supplying the extra forces. I have been trying to get the Russians to see this point.15. In my telegram of July 25, 1941, which I sent you before our Atlantic meeting, I spoke of the long-term project for 1943 of the simultaneous landing of say fifteen thousand tanks from hundreds of specially fitted ocean-going ships on the beaches of three or four countries ripe for revolt. I suggested that the necessary alterations could easily be made at this stage to a proportion of your merchant ships now building on so vast a scale. I now send you the drawings prepared by the Admiralty, which illustrate the kind of treatment the vessels would require. You will see that it is estimated only to add about fifty thousand pounds to their cost, and I suppose a proportionate delay. It seems to me that not less than two hundred ships should be thus fitted. There is sufficient time, as we cannot think of [executing] such a plan before <<1943|9c:1>>. But the essential counterpart of the tank programme you have now embarked upon is the power to transport them across the oceans and land them upon unfortified beaches along the immense coastline Hitler is committed to defend. I trust therefore, Mr. President, that this will commend itself to you.16. I send you a short note which I have made upon the use of artillery, both field and flak. This has its bearing upon the approaching offensive described in Part I, as well as upon the organisation of our Home Army to meet invasion. All the authorities are agreed upon the principles set forth, and you arc very welcome to show this paper, should you think it worth while, to your officers.17. I also send, for your own personal information, a note I have made on the structure, present and future, of the British and Imperial armies which we are endeavouring to organise in 1942. Of course the figure of about one hundred divisions does not, as is fully explained, mean one hundred mobile standard field divisions. Some are garrison; some are anti-aircraft; and some are equivalents in brigade groups. Broadly speaking however it represents a much more considerable deployment of military strength than we had planned at the outbreak of the war. This has been rendered possible by the fact that we have not been engaged to any serious extent since the losses of Dunkirk, and that munitions and reserves have accumulated instead of being expended on a great scale.18. I have not referred to the Japanese menace, which has seemed to grow so much sharper in the last few days, nor to the splendid help you are giving us in the Atlantic, because we discussed these great matters so fully at our meeting, and events are now telling their own tale in accordance with our anticipations. I still think however that the stronger the action of the United States towards Japan, the greater the chance of preserving peace. Should however peace be broken and the United States become at war with Japan, you may be sure that a British declaration of war upon Japan will follow within the hour. We hope to be able before Christmas to provide a considerable battle squadron for the Indian and Pacific Oceans.19. Lastly, Mr. President, let me tell you how I envy the Lord Privy Seal in being able to fly over to the United States and have a good talk with you. My place is here, and therefore I have taken this opportunity of writing you so long a letter. Might I ask that all reference to the forthcoming operations shall be kept absolutely secret, and for yourself alone? For this purpose I have separated the first part of the letter [containing the actual date of our offensive] from the rest, in the hopes that after reading it you will speedily consign it to the flames.With kindest regards and every good wish,Believe me, Mr. President,Your sincere friend,WINSTON S.

The idea of a surprise attack on Pearl Harbour originated in the brain of Admiral Yamamoto, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief. Preparation for this treacherous blow before any declaration of war went forward with the utmost secrecy, and by November 22 the striking force of six carriers, with a supporting force of battleships and cruisers, was concentrated in an unfrequented anchorage in the Kurile Islands, north of Japan proper. Already the date of the attack had been fixed for Sunday, December 7, and on November 26 (East longitude date) the force sailed under the command of Admiral Nagumo. Keeping far to the northward of Hawaii, amidst the fog and gales of these northern latitudes, Nagumo approached his goal undetected. Before sunrise on the fateful day the attack was launched from a position about two hundred and seventy-five miles to the north of Pearl Harbour. Three hundred and sixty aircraft took part, comprising bombers of all types, escorted by fighters. At <<7.55 A.M.|2a>> the first bomb fell.

Admiral Hart, commanding the modest United States Asiatic Fleet, had already been in consultation with the adjacent British and Dutch naval authorities, and, in accordance with his war plan, had begun to disperse his forces to the southward, where he intended to assemble a striking force in Dutch waters in conjunction with his prospective allies. He had at his disposal only one heavy and two light cruisers, besides a dozen old destroyers and various auxiliary vessels. His strength lay almost entirely in his submarines, of which he had twenty-eight. At <<3 A.M.|5>> on December 8 Admiral Hart intercepted a message giving the staggering news of the attack on Pearl Harbour. He at once warned all concerned that hostilities had begun, without waiting for confirmation from Washington. At dawn the Japanese dive-bombers struck, and throughout the ensuing days the air attacks continued on an ever-increasing scale. On the 10th the naval base at Cavite was completely destroyed by fire, and on the same day the Japanese made their first landing in the north of Luzon. Disasters mounted swiftly. Most of the American air forces were destroyed in battle or on the ground, and by December 20 the remnants had been withdrawn to Port Darwin in Australia. Admiral Hart\x{2019}s ships had begun their southward dispersal some days before, and only the submarines remained to dispute the sea with the enemy. On December 21 the main Japanese invasion force landed in Lingayen Gulf, threatening Manila itself, and thereafter the march of events was not unlike that which was already in progress in Malaya; but the defence was more prolonged.",

We tried to measure the consequences of this fundamental change in our war position against Japan. We had lost the command of every ocean except the Atlantic. Australia and New Zealand and all the vital islands in their sphere were open to attack. We had only one key weapon in our hands. The Prince of Wales and the Repulse had arrived at Singapore. They had been sent to these waters to exercise that kind of vague menace which capital ships of the highest quality whose whereabouts is unknown can impose upon all hostile naval calculations. How should we use them now? Obviously they must go to sea and vanish among the innumerable islands. There was general agreement on that.",

Next day news came that a large Japanese seaborne expedition had entered the Gulf of Siam. It was clear that decisive events were at hand. Phillips got back to Singapore on the morning of the 7th. Soon <<after midnight|13>> on the 8th it was reported that a landing was actually in progress at Kota Bharu, and later that other landings were being made near Singora and also at Patani.

            "Admiral Phillips judged it his duty to strike at the enemy while they were disembarking. At a meeting of his senior officers all agreed that it was impossible for the Navy to stand out of the battle at this critical stage. He reported his intentions to the Admiralty. He requested the Singapore Air Command to move fighters to our northern airfields, and requested the utmost help from our meagre air force \x{2013} namely, reconnaissance a hundred miles north of his squadron on December 9, reconnaissance off Singora from daylight on December 10, and fighter protection over Singora on the morning of December 10. This last all-important aid could not be given, first, because of the expected attack on Singapore, and secondly, because the northern airfields were already untenable. The Admiral had sailed at <<5.35 P.M.|2a>> on the 8th with the Prince of Wales and Repulse and the destroyers Electra, Express, Vampire, and Tenedos when news of the landing reached him. It added the warning that large Japanese bomber forces were based in Southern Indo-China. As the frequent rain squalls and low clouds were unfavourable for air action, Phillips resolved to press on. On the evening of the 9th the weather cleared, and he soon had reason to believe that he was being shadowed by enemy aircraft. The hope of surprise was gone, and heavy air attacks must be expected the next morning near Singora. At this Admiral Phillips reluctantly abandoned his daring enterprise, and after dark turned homeward. He had certainly done his best, and all might have yet been well. <<About midnight|13>> however by a hard mischance another enemy landing was reported at Kuantan, more than a hundred and fifty miles south of Kota Bharu. Admiral Phillips thought it unlikely that his force, last sighted by the enemy on a northerly course, would be expected so far south by daylight on the 10th. After all, he might achieve surprise. He accepted the risk and turned his ships towards Kuantan.",

I cannot understand how there has been this frightful delay in devising and making the release gear. More than three months seem to have been consumed upon a task so incomparably easier than many which are being solved. Failing any mechanical solution, why cannot a hole be cut in the floor of the aeroplane and a man lying on his stomach push by hand the eggs, which are about the size of a Slilton cheese, one after another through the hole?

23.VI.41.The success which has attended the admirable offensive of the R.A.F. over the Pas de Calais should encourage this to be pressed day after day as long as it proves profitable. The number of bombers going by day should be increased as much as possible, so as to take full advantage by daylight of the various targets presented. For this purpose the Cabinet should be asked to agree to the bombing of any important factories which are being used on a large scale for the repair or manufacture of enemy aircraft, and any important objectives in the area dominated should be subjected to the heaviest daylight bombing and effectively destroyed. The French workmen should at the right moment be warned to keep away from the factories, though this should not prevent our beginning before they have notice.2. On the assumption that our domination of the air over this area will be successfully established, the Staffs should consider whether a serious operation in the form of a large raid should not be launched under full air protection. I have in mind something on the scale of twenty-five thousand to thirty thousand men \x{2013} perhaps the Commandos plus one of the Canadian divisions.

6.I.41.W.S.5A has already started and B starts immediately. There is there fore no question about them. They contain together 55,000 men, of whom 12,000 are for India, etc., and 43,000 for M.E. Of the 43,000 M.E., about 22,000 are for fighting units and drafts, and 21,000 technical, L. of C., base, etc., of which about 4000 are Navy and R.A.F. Thus the Army in M.E. receives 22,000 fighting and 17,000 other men.2. The present composition of the Army in the Middle East (excluding Kenya and Aden, nearly 70,000) reveals 150,000 fighting troops. Behind this are 40,000 L. of C. and 20,000 base establishments and details \x{2013} i.e., 150,000 to 60,000. To this will now be added by W.S.5A and B 22,000 fighting and 17,000 L. of C., base, etc., making a total of 172,000 fighting and 77,000 rearward services.3. Convoy W.S.6, now being loaded, contains 8500 fighting troops, plus fighting share of 4000 drafts \x{2013} say 2500 \x{2013} equals total fighting troops 11,000; excluding the mobile naval base, 5300 (of which later); and the R.A.F. (including training school to Cape Town) and R.N. 70CO, 2000 Free French, and about 9000 base and other details. Upon the arrival of this convoy the total figure for the Middle East will stand at fighting troops 183,000 and 86,000 rearward units \x{2013} i.e., <<15 to 7|10a:0>>. The progressive deterioration in the proportion between fighting troops and rearward services must be noted.4. But the category \x{201c}fighting troops\x{201d} requires further searching analysis. We are told, for example, that the 7th Australian Division, 14,800, is untrained and largely unequipped, and there is the cavalry division, 8500, whose mechanisation has not yet made progress, and who cannot really be called fighting troops except for local order. There are several other units I could specify which are similarly not fighting troops in the effective mobile sense \x{2013} say, 6000. Thus 29,000 should properly be subtracted from the fighting total, reducing it from 183,000, to 154,000, and added to the rearward services and non-effective, raising them from 86,000 to 115,000. The condition of the Army of the Middle East (excluding the 70,000 in Kenya and Aden) is therefore represented by 154,000 fighting troops and 115,000 rearward and non-effective (except for immediate local security). The proportion of non-effectives seems much too high. It must be remembered that further great reductions could be made from the effective fighting troops, since every division or brigade group has its own first-line transport and is supposed to be a self-contained military unit. Further, it should not be forgotten that in order to supply all this rearward and unorganised or non-effective strength the rations of the British people have had to be severely reduced, and further cuts are in prospect, and that every man and every ton of stores has to be carried and transported at heavy risk from enemy U-boat, air, and raider attacks round the Cape of Good Hope by ships whose there-and-back voyage occupies, with turn-round, not less than four months. It is therefore incumbent upon all loyal persons, whether at home or in M.E., to try to increase the fighting troops and to keep at the lowest possible the rearward and non-effective services. In this lies a great opportunity for brilliant administrative exertion which might produce results in war economy equal to those gained by a considerable victory in the field.
5. If I could be assured that the plethora of rearward services contained in the aforesaid convoys W.S.5A and B and W.S.6 would animate and render effective the 29,000 non-effective fighting men mentioned in paragraph 4 above, I should be content. For instance, will the 7th Australian Division gain the ancillary services necessary to fit it for other than local action? Will the 8500 cavalry division become a mechanised unit capable of acting in brigades, or at least regiments, against the enemy? Then, although the proportions of non-fighting troops now crowding our convoys would still be a very hard measure, at any rate the Army in the M.E. would grow markedly in fighting strength, and the delay in sending the 50th Division would be tolerable. It may be that some consoling information will be forthcoming about this.The question of whether it would be better to send the 1st Brigade of the 50th Division instead of the mobile naval base in W.S.6 is nicely balanced, but preparations may have advanced too far for a convenient change of plan. This must be considered tomorrow (7th) by C.O.S. Committee, observing that it will be out of action for nearly three months.6. It is otherwise necessary to approve the despatch of W.S.6 (reduced to 34,000 or less) as now proposed. I deeply regret the resultant composition of the Army in the M.E. When all these convoys have arrived, its total will amount to 240,000, plus 43,000, plus 20,000 \x{2013} total over 300,000. to which must be added 70,000 in Aden and Kenya \x{2013} total 370,000 men, on pay and ration strength. From this enormous force the only recognisable fighting military units are the following: 6th Australian Division, one New Zealand division, comprising two brigade groups, 4th Indian Division, 5th Indian Division, 16th Infantry Brigade, 2d Armoured Division, 7th Armoured Division (incomplete), 6th British Division (incomplete). And such fighting units as have been formed from the 70,000 men in Kenya and Aden \x{2013} e.g., two South African brigades, two West African brigades, and local East African forces. It is hoped that to these will soon be added (a) the completion of the above incomplete units, (b) a seventh British division formed out of the unclassified and by combing the rearward services, the 7th Australian Division, and a mechanised cavalry division.This will amount to about ten divisions, infantry, armoured, and cavalry, plus, say, one division from Kenya \x{2013} total eleven divisions.

10.VII.41.It is said that the attack will be made at dawn. This cannot however imply that all the parachute and glider troops will arrive simultaneously at dawn. To move as many as one thousand troop-carrying planes, or their equivalent, from French, Belgian, and Dutch bases would occupy several hours \x{2013} at least four or five, i.e., almost all the present hours of darkness. Therefore, as the journey is short, they would either be arriving in instalments during the night (in which case zero hour would probably be <<1 A.M|5>>.), or if the first ones arrived at dawn the rest would straggle out during the remaining hours of daylight. In the latter case they would be cut to pieces by our fighters. There can be no question of parachutists arriving in instalments by daylight. It is noticeable that the Germans have never yet tried these descents by night. There are very great difficulties in finding exact points in which to make low-altitude descents at night.The Air Staff must be consulted upon all these vital problems. It is no good starting staff exercises or studies of this kind, involving so much dislocation, upon a basis which is unreal and could not. possibly occur. It is quite easy to say, \x{201c}Twelve thousand parachutists land at dawn. What would you do?\x{201d} but this statement is meaningless without a detailed analysis of the movements which I have indicated.2. A smaller-scale attack might well be more dangerous. Five hundred desperadoes, coming out of the blue without the slightest preliminary indication, might descend by day, or at any rate in the half-light of dawn, at or near the centre of government. These however would first be picked up by the R.D.F., and would run serious risk of interception by night and almost certain destruction by day. Nevertheless, surprise has such sovereign virtues in war that the proposition should be attentively examined. The centres of government and executive control should at any rate be made reasonably secure against a sudden rush of this kind if upon examination any probability can be attached to it. The first hour is the only hour that matters, and the first ten minutes are the minutes that matter most.3. I shall be glad if Home Forces will consult with the Air Staff, and hack me out clear-cut answers to the above queries and suggestions. Two or three days should suffice for the study.

10.VII.41.How do we stand at present on the strategic and tactical camouflaging of defences against enemy attacks on airfields? What body is studying the lessons of Maleme and the batteries thereabouts?Obviously action proceeds on two lines, namely: (a) The concealment of the real guns and deceitful presentation of the dummy guns. There might well be two or three dummy guns, or even more, for every real gun. (b) The best of all camouflage is a confusing variety of positions made in which no one can tell the real from the sham.The tactics of holding fire from particular batteries during the early phases of an attack are no doubt also being studied.Pray let me have a report by Saturday next.",

16.VIII.41.This is a melancholy story. You will see from reading the minutes that we were promised Grummans, with folding wings, at twenty a month, beginning in April. We still have none, and are only promised the schedule set out in the First Lord\x{2019}s minute of July 26.2. I regard the supply of from <<six to twelve|10a:1>> Grummans to Victorious and Ark Royal as of first importance. Especially is this the case with any carrier operating in the Mediterranean. The surprise which will be effected upon the enemy when these fast fighters rise to engage them may give considerable easement, almost at once.The cutting-down of enemy bomber aircraft attack at sea far exceeds in importance and urgency any other duty which can be performed by a carrier in the Mediterranean. Even if they can only work within forty to fifty miles of the parent ship they can do all that is necessary. The enemy must be made to feel that to go near a ship convoyed by an aircraft-carrier is to incur heavy losses from aircraft almost equal to shore-based fighters.3. We have now no aircraft-carriers in the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, there is no point in sending folding-wing Grummans there at present. The August, September, and October quotas for Grummans now assigned to the United Kingdom (total twenty-two), and the twenty-four now assigned to the Middle East in the September and October quotas \x{2013} total forty-six \x{2013} should all be made available in the United Kingdom for the equipping of our aircraft-carriers.

29.X.41.All this seems to make many difficulties out of fairly simple things. Women should be enlisted in the A.T.S. and should always wear that badge. This ensures that their special needs in treatment, accommodation, etc., are kept up to a minimum standard wherever they may be by the women influences organising the A.T.S. When however they are posted to a combatant unit and share in practice with the men the un-avoidable dangers and hardships of that unit, they should become in every respect members of it. They should wear, in addition to the A.T.S. badge, all regimental insignia appropriate to their rank. Although their well-being is still supervised by the A.T.S. authorities, they should be considered as detached from the A.T.S. and incorporated in the combatant unit. This does not imply any alteration in their legal status, nor need it involve any Parliamentary discussion (although Parliamentary authority could easily be obtained were it necessary).2. Considering the immense importance of having a large number of women in A.A. batteries and that the efficiency of the batteries depends upon carefully organised gun teams, it is imperative that these women should not be moved without reference to the Battery Command. The idea that there is an army of A.T.S. under its own Commander-in-Chief, part of which lives alongside particular batteries and gives them a helping hand from time to time, is contrary to our main interest, namely, the maintenance of a larger number of A.A. batteries with a smaller number of men.3. You are good enough to say that I have been misinformed on various points. I should like to go further into this. I shall be glad to have a meeting at <<5 P.M.|9g>> on Tuesday, November 4, at which General Pile and other officers of the A.D.G.B., as well as representatives of the A.T.S., are present, and I trust you and the Adjutant-General will also come.

11.XI.41.The losses sustained both by the night bombers and day fighters have lately been very heavy. There is no need to press unduly the offensive by the figures over France; <<about two|9:0>> sweeps a month instead of four should be sufficient, combined with a continuance of the attacks on shipping. While the degree of attack may be lightened, the impression of its continuance should be sustained.2. I have several times in Cabinet deprecated forcing the night bombing of Germany without due regard to weather conditions. There is no particular point at this time in bombing Berlin. The losses sustained last week were most grievous. We cannot afford losses on that scale in view of the short fall of the American bomber programme. Losses which are acceptable in a battle or for some decisive military objective ought not to be incurred merely as a matter of routine. There is no need to fight the weather and the enemy at the same time.3. It is now the duty of both Fighter and Bomber Command to re-gather their strength for the spring.4. Let me have a full report about the heavy losses of bombers on the night of the last heavy raid on Berlin.

            "27.111.41.Naval programmes have been continuous throughout the war, all slips being filled as vacated. It is nevertheless convenient at this time of year that the Admiralty should present their present needs of new construction in a general list and obtain Cabinet sanction for their policy.2. No one can doubt that the construction of small craft for anti-U-boat warfare, for minesweeping, for combating the E-boats, and for assault landings should proceed to the full extent of our resources. It is essential however that simplicity of design, speed of construction, and the largest possible numbers should govern the whole of this small-craft programme. The construction of destroyers should in no case exceed fifteen months. I understand from the Controller that, apart from enemy action or strikes, he can guarantee this in respect of the forty now projected.3. We cannot at the present time contemplate any construction of heavy ships that cannot be completed in 1942. This rules out further progress upon the Lion and Temeraire and the laying-down of Conqueror and Thunderer. It also makes it impossible to begin the four heavy cruisers contemplated in the programme of 1940. Work will therefore be limited to completing the three remaining battleships of the King
George V class and to building the three light cruisers of the 1941 programme, all of which, it is understood, can be completed before the end of 1942. An additional monitor, for which the guns are already available, can also be completed before the end of 1942.
4. The need of concentrating labour on merchant repairs and on repairs to the fighting fleet makes it impossible to begin any new aircraft-carriers after Victorious, Indomitable, and Indefatigable have been completed. Such new aircraft-carriers could not in any case be ready until 1944.5. The requirements of the Navy in armour-plate can on the above basis be adjusted to meet the needs of the Army tank programme, and can be limited to 16,500 tons in 1941 and 25,000 tons in 1942. No new armour-plate plant need be erected at present.6. The one exception to the above principles is the Vanguard, which can be completed in 1943 and is the only capital ship we can by any means obtain before <<1945|9c:1>>. As we have the guns and turrets for the Vanguard, it is eminently desirable that this vessel should be pressed forward, provided that this can be done within the limits of the armour-plate provision in paragraph 5.7. Nothing in the above should hinder the work on the drawings and designs of any of the postponed vessels, including especially the new aircraft-carrier.8. In view of the need to concentrate on repairs, the output of new merchant ships may be reduced from 1,250,000 tons, which is the present target, to 1,100,000 tons in 1942, and we should not at the present time proceed with any merchant vessels which cannot be completed by the end of 1941. It is to the United States building that we must look for relief in 1942.9. The whole of our heavy ship construction will be reviewed on September 1, 1941, in the light of (a)
the Battle of the Atlantic, and (b)
the relation of the United States to the war.



Prime Minister to First Lord, First Sea Lord and Controller
16.VIII.41.I am greatly interested in the proposed design of the Lion and Teme-raire. Let me know the exact point which has been reached in the general construction and in the drawings.2. It is most important not to reproduce in these two ships the faults which are apparent in the five K.G.V\x{2019}s; namely: (a) The retrogression to the fourteen-inch gun from our well-tried fifteen-inch type; and (b) the marring of the structure by the provision of the aerodrome amidships. Merely for the sake of having a couple of low quality aircraft, the whole principle of the citadel so well exemplified in the Nelson and the Rodney has been cast aside.The space of about forty feet amidships entails a degree of heavy armouring in this vital area, which is improvident having regard to the needs for carrying a lesser protection as far forward and aft as possible. It may well be that one thousand or fifteen hundred tons of armour are misplaced through the opening of this hiatus in the citadel of the ship.3. I understand, and hope, that the Lion and Temeraire will carry nine sixteen-inch guns in three triple turrets, with six guns firing directly ahead, and the rear turret on the most forward bearing possible. These three turrets should be grouped together as closely as possible to form the central citadel, comprising funnels and director tower, and covering with the turret and heaviest armour the magazines and vital machinery spaces. If this were done it should be possible to give a six-inch turtle [underwater] deck carried very far forward, if possible to the bow, thus protecting the speed of the ship from bow damage.4. Although it looked very progressive to be able to fly two aeroplanes off a battleship, the price paid in the rest of the design was altogether excessive. It might however be possible in a ship with a citadel outlined above to arrange to flip off one or two aircraft from the quarterdeck, but no serious sacrifice of design must be made for this. A capital ship of the consequence of the Lion or Temeraire must depend upon having an aircraft-carrier working with her, or at the very least a cruiser capable of flying off an aircraft. She should on no account be spoiled for the sake of carrying aircraft.5. I should very much like to see these two ships pressed forward beyond what is at present approved. Before however any final decision is taken upon the design there ought to be a conference of a number of sea officers, including the late and present Commanders-in-Chief, who have served in the King George V or Prince of Wales. The successful design of the Arethusa was evolved from a conference of Admirals convened, at my direction, in the winter of 1911.Pray let me have your views.The First Sea Lord confirmed that these ships would mount nine sixteen-inch guns in three triple turrets and that the Commanders-in-chief had been consulted about the design. He maintained that the aircraft hangars in the King George V class did not weaken the citadel. This had to include protection for the machinery spaces, which were enormously increased in these ships as compared with the Nelsons.[The resumption of work on the Lion and Temeraire was closely considered, but we decided against it for the following reasons: (a) The building of turrets would interfere with the production of A.A. equipment and coast-defence gun mountings. (b) The requirements for armour would conflict with tank production. (c) The demands which these ships would make on our shipyard labour force.What finally clinched the matter was the fact that there could be no reasonable chance of completing these vessels during the war. They were therefore cancelled.I was anxious to know how our King George V class compared with contemporary American ships.]



Prime Minister to First Sea Lord
1.IX.41.I cannot help grieving that we have not got the three triple sixteen-inch turrets for the five K.G.V\x{2019}s. The matter is academic and irretrievable. None the less, as my thought has dwelt on these matters for the last thirty years, I should like to know what is known at the Admiralty about the American ships contemporary to K.G.V. Admiral Stark told me that they were three triple turrets of sixteen-inch. When I asked him whether he had not overrun the 35,000-ton limit he said, \x{201c}No, but they had given up the five hundred tons they used to keep to veer and haul upon.\x{201d}Please let me have the legend of these American ships as far as you have knowledge of them at the Admiralty.Let me also know what they do about the hangar, and any advantages in strength and structure possessed by K.G.V to compensate for the loss of gun-power.[The First Sea Lord replied that the equivalent American ship (U.S.S. North Carolina) had a heavier main armament but somewhat lighter secondary armament. The British ship had heavier protection and slightly higher speed. He preferred the British method of carrying two aircraft in hangars amidships as compared with the American practice of providing two exposed catapults on the quarterdeck. The discussion continued with my minute of September 22 and his reply dated October 2:]COMPARISON BETWEEN U.S.S. \x{201c}NORTH CAROLINA\x{201d} AND H.M.S. \x{201c}KING GEORGE V\x{201d}",
