Troops, armed with semi-portables or manning fixed-mount heavy stuff, had covered the grounds. At <<five minutes before midnight|10>> Renwood, accompanied by four secret-service men, had entered the vault, which was thereupon locked by the treasurer.

Instead, he held his orbit until the minute arrived at which the mathematical probability became point <<nine nine|5l:1>> nine that his proposed quarry was not going to appear.
