We can\x{2019}t determine even origin or destination, since the normal disappearances outnumber the abnormal ones by <<four to one|10a:0>>.

But this morning they found another derelict, in which the chief pilot had scrawled \x{2018}WARE HELLHOLE IN SP\x{2019} across a plate. Connection with the other derelicts, if any, obscure. If the pilot was sane when he wrote that message it means something\x{2014}but nobody knows what.

Troops, armed with semi-portables or manning fixed-mount heavy stuff, had covered the grounds. At <<five minutes before midnight|10>> Renwood, accompanied by four secret-service men, had entered the vault, which was thereupon locked by the treasurer. All the cabinet members saw them go in, as did the attendant corps of specially-selected guards. Nevertheless, when the treasurer opened the vault at <<five minutes after midnight|10>>, the five men were gone. No trace of any one of them had been found from that time on.',

They were armored by this time and they had both machine rifles and semi-portable projectors. They were entrenched; evidently intending to fight a delaying and defensive battle, knowing that if they could hold him off until the tube had been traversed, the Lensman would not have a chance.
