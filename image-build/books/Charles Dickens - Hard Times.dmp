            "The late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother\x{2019}s side a Powler, married this lady, being by the father\x{2019}s side a Scadgers. Lady Scadgers (an immensely fat old woman, with an inordinate appetite for butcher\x{2019}s meat, and a mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen years) contrived the marriage at a period when Sparsit was just of age, and chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long slim props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning. He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he came into it, and spent it twice over immediately afterwards. Thus, when he died, at <<twenty-four|9:0>> (the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he did not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the honeymoon, in affluent circumstances. That bereaved lady, fifteen years older than he, fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative, Lady Scadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly to maintain herself, went out at a salary. And here she was now, in her elderly days, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby\x{2019}s tea as he took his breakfast.",

            "Dickens was not alone in his productivity. Many nineteenth-century authors, taking advantage of the rise of mass market magazines, and then books, were happy to produce all the stories and novels that the reading public demanded. Like Dickens, such authors as Anthony Trollope, Wilkie Collins, Charlotte Yonge, Mrs. Humphry Ward, Louisa May Alcott, Horatio Alger, Jules Verne, and \x{c9}mile Zola worked steadily. They wrote books in numbers, and of a quality, that today seems virtually impossible. Unlike some of the others, though, Dickens recognized early in his career that authors could work hard and still not profit from their efforts\x{2014}the money was in publishing. In addition to writing, therefore, Dickens worked as an editor (for Bentley\x{2019}s Miscellany until <<1839|18:0>>) and founded two weekly magazines, Household Words in 1850, and All the Year Round in 1859.",

            "From the first chapter, Hard Times is intended to send a message. It has much the same substance as \x{201c}On Strike\x{201d}\x{2014}those in power are selfishly resentful of the powerless; the powerless do the best they can, but they are trapped by circumstances (as Stephen Blackpool is trapped in his horrendous marriage) and have no way of gaining a livable life or even a tolerable life. In order to enforce their power, the powerful rely upon a purely objective philosophy that denies the existence of feeling, shared humanity, or any sort of pleasure. The tone taken by the narrator, like the tone in \x{201c}On Strike,\x{201d} is highly polemical. A polemic is by nature both angry and eloquent. It relies on hyperbole and passion to move listeners and readers, and its goal is change. Thus, the narrator does not set out to prove that Gradgrind\x{2019}s educational theories and philosophical outlook are simultaneously foolish and cruel; he assumes that, and lays out a story to demonstrate it. Hard Times is really a morality play not unlike A Christmas Carol (1843), but the morality explored is political rather than personal. Scrooge, in A Christmas Carol, fails in his relationships to his family and to his employee, Bob Cratchit, but witnessing the effects of his miserliness is sufficient to change his habits, and so, too, does it change his business relations. By <<1854|9n:0>>, however, Dickens knew that a little Christmas spirit would not be enough to alter the class-based factory system of the burgeoning Industrial Revolution.",
