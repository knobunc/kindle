            'Years ago, half a lifetime, when I was a young journalist, I joined a club. It existed solely to take advantage of the licensing laws of the day, which forced all pubs to stop serving drinks at <<eleven PM|5>>, closing time. This club, the Diogenes, was a one-room affair located above a record shop in a narrow alley just off the Tottenham Court Road. It was owned by a cheerful, chubby, alcohol-fueled woman called Nora, who would tell anyone who asked and even if they didn\'t that she\'d called the club the Diogenes, darling, because she was still looking for an honest man. Up a narrow flight of steps, and, at Nora\'s whim, the door to the club would be open, or not. It kept irregular hours.',

            'It was <<almost midnight|13>>, and Paul and Martyn and I had started telling ghost stories. I had just finished telling them a sworn-true ghostly account from my school days: the tale of the Green Hand. It had been an article of faith at my prep school that there was a disembodied, luminous hand that was seen, from time to time, by unfortunate schoolboys. If you saw the Green Hand you would die soon after. Fortunately, none of us were ever unlucky enough to encounter it, but there were sad tales of boys there before our time, boys who saw the Green Hand and whose thirteen-year-old hair had turned white overnight. According to school legend they were taken to the sanatorium, where they would expire after a week or so without ever being able to utter another word.',

"This place is haunted," she said, cheerfully. "Not that it\'s ever bothered me. I like a bit of company, darlings. If I didn\'t, I wouldn\'t have opened the club. Now, don\'t you have homes to go to?"',
