When I became quite certain that it was locked, I stepped back into the moonlight and looked up at the house. Although it was barely <<midnight|13>>, there was not a light showing. They were all abed and asleep. I felt a resentment against them. I had expected a vigil, for her, and for me.',

And I had not yet recovered from the shock which Isabel had given me, a shock now oddly separated from Isabel herself as if a demon had emanated from her which teased me still. I stretched my legs out and contemplated at the other end of the table a heap of cherry-red silk which Maggie had been sewing, presumably a dress for Isabel. Like a true house-serf the Italian girl had always made clothes for Isabel and Lydia. Lydia\x{2019}s old beautiful gipsy robes, the garments which my dear father had inspired and which he so much loved to see her wear, had all been made by Maggie: or perhaps by Giulia or Vittoria or Gemma or Carlotta.",

I had of course no intention of telling him anything about Flora. I could not even decide to speak of that to Isabel. I kept wandering about and visiting the workshop until Otto appeared there, very dishevelled, <<about five o\x{2019}clock|6>>. I conjectured how he had spent the afternoon. I found that I could not help being curious, though I disliked the curiosity and hoped it would not be too evident to him.",
