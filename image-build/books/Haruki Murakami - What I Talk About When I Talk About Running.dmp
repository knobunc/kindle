            "I can pinpoint the exact moment when I first thought I could write a novel. It was <<around one thirty in the afternoon|5>> of April 1, 1978. I was at Jingu Stadium that day, alone in the outfield drinking beer and watching the game. Jingu Stadium was within walking distance of my apartment at the time, and I was a fairly big Yakult Swallows fan. It was a perfectly beautiful spring day, not a cloud in the sky, with a warm breeze blowing. There weren\x{2019}t any benches in the outfield seating back then, just a grassy slope. I was lying on the grass, sipping cold beer, gazing up occasionally at the sky, and leisurely enjoying the game. As usual for the Swallows, the stadium wasn\x{2019}t very crowded. It was the season opener, and they were taking on the Hiroshima Carp at home. I remember that Yasuda was pitching for the Swallows. He was a short, stocky sort of pitcher with a wicked curve. He easily retired the side in the top of the first inning, and in the bottom of the inning the leadoff batter for the Swallows was Dave Hilton, a young American player new to the team. Hilton got a hit down the left field line. The crack of bat meeting ball right on the sweet spot echoed through the stadium. Hilton easily rounded first and pulled up to second. And it was at that exact moment that a thought struck me: You know what? I could try writing a novel. I still can remember the wide open sky, the feel of the new grass, the satisfying crack of the bat. Something flew down from the sky at that instant, and whatever it was, I accepted it.",

When I was running the bar I often didn\x{2019}t get to sleep until nearly dawn. The bar closed at <<twelve|9c:1>>, but then I had to clean up, go over the receipts, sit and talk, have a drink to relax. Do all that and before you know it, it\x{2019}s <<three a.m.|5>> and sunrise is just around the corner. Often I\x{2019}d be sitting at my kitchen table, writing, when it would start to get light outside. Naturally, when I finally woke up the sun was already high in the sky.",

People are at their best at different times of day, but I\x{2019}m definitely a morning person. That\x{2019}s when I can focus and finish up important work I have to do. Afterward I work out or do other errands that don\x{2019}t take much concentration. At the end of the day I relax and don\x{2019}t do any more work. I read, listen to music, take it easy, and try to go to bed early. This is the pattern I\x{2019}ve mostly followed up till today. Thanks to this, I\x{2019}ve been able to work efficiently these past twenty-four years. It\x{2019}s a lifestyle, though, that doesn\x{2019}t allow for much nightlife, and sometimes your relationships with other people become problematic. Some people even get mad at you, because they invite you to go somewhere or do something with them and you keep turning them down.",

There\x{2019}s just the one main highway. Once you run roads in Greece you\x{2019}ll understand, but they\x{2019}re paved differently. Instead of gravel, they mix in powdered marble, which makes the road shiny in the sunlight and quite slippery. When it rains you have to be very careful. Even when it isn\x{2019}t raining the soles of your shoes make a squeaky sound, and your legs can feel how smooth the road surface is.",

On rainy days we\x{2019}d exchange a smile, a guess-we\x{2019}re-both-having-it-tough kind of smile. I remember two young runners in particular, Taniguchi and Kanei. They were both in their late twenties, both former members of the Waseda University track team, where they\x{2019}d been standouts in the Hakone relay race. After Seko was named manager of the S&B team, they were expected to be the two young stars of the team. They were the caliber of runner expected to win medals at the Olympics someday, and hard training didn\x{2019}t faze them. Sadly, though, they were killed in a car accident when the team was training together in Hokkaido in the summer. I\x{2019}d seen with my own eyes the tough regimen they\x{2019}d put themselves through, and it was a real shock when I heard the news of their deaths.

And as if this weren\x{2019}t enough, the boiler suddenly gave out, and we had to do without hot water and heating. But that wasn\x{2019}t all.
