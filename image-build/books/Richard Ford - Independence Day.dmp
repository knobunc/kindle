Sometime in the indistinct Sixties, each with a then-spouse, they departed unpromising flatlander lives (Joe was a trig teacher in Aliquippa, Phyllis a plump, copper-haired, slightly bulgy-eyed housewife from the D.C. area) and trailered up to Vermont in search of a sunnier, less predictable Weltansicht. Time and fate soon took their unsurprising courses: spouses wandered off with other people\x{2019}s spouses; their kids got busily into drugs, got pregnant, got married, then disappeared to California or Canada or Tibet or Wiesbaden, West Germany. Joe and Phyllis each floated around uneasily for two or three years in intersecting circles of neighborhood friends and off-again, on-again Weltansichts, taking classes, starting new degrees, trying new mates and eventually giving in to what had been available and obvious all along: true and eyes-open love for each other. Almost immediately, Joe Markham\x{2014}who\x{2019}s a stout, aggressive little bullet-eyed, short-armed, hairy-backed Bob Hoskins type of about my age, who played nose guard for the Aliquippa Fighting Quips and who\x{2019}s not obviously \x{201c}creative\x{201d}\x{2014}started having good luck with the pots and sand-cast sculptures in abstract forms he\x{2019}d been making, projects he\x{2019}d only fiddled around with before and that his first wife, Melody, had made vicious fan of before moving back to Beaver Falls, leaving him alone with his regular job for the Department of Social Services. Phyllis meanwhile began realizing she, in fact, had an untapped genius for designing slick, lush-looking pamphlets on fancy paper she could actually make herself (she designed Joe\x{2019}s first big mailing). And before they knew it they were shipping Joe\x{2019}s art and Phyllis\x{2019}s sumptuous descriptive booklets all over hell. Joe\x{2019}s pots began showing up in big department stores in Colorado and California and as expensive specialty items in ritzy mail order catalogues, and to both their amazement were winning prizes at prestigious crafts fairs the two of them didn\x{2019}t even have time to attend, they were so busy.",

            "<<Toward ten|9:0>>, though, we have kicked back in our captain\x{2019}s chairs, a new candle lit, having finished coffee and gone back to the Round Hill. Sally has bunched her dense hair back, and we are launched into a discussion of our individual self-perceptions (mine basically as a comic character; Sally\x{2019}s a \x{201c}facilitator,\x{201d} though from time to time, she says, \x{201c}as a dark and pretty ruthless obstructor\x{201d}\x{2014}which I\x{2019}ve never noticed). She sees me, she says, in an odd priestly mode, which is in fact the worst thing I can imagine, since priests are the least self-aware, most unenlightened, irresolute, isolated and frustrated people on the earth (politicians are second). I decide to ignore this, or at least to treat it as disguised goodwill and to mean I, too, am a kind of facilitator, which I would be if I could. I tell her I see her as a great beauty with a sound head on her shoulders, who I find compelling and unsusceptible to being made up in the way I explained earlier, which is true (I\x{2019}m still shaken by being perceived as a priest). We venture on toward the issue of strong feelings, how they\x{2019}re maybe more important than love. I explain (why, I\x{2019}m not sure, when it\x{2019}s not particularly true) that I\x{2019}m having a helluva good time these days, refer to the Existence Period, which I have mentioned before, in other contexts. I fully admit that this part of my life may someday be\x{2014}except for her\x{2014}hard to remember with precision, and that sometimes I feel beyond affection\x{2019}s grasp but that\x{2019}s just being human and no cause for worry. I also tell her I could acceptably end my life as the \x{201c}dean\x{201d} of New Jersey realtors, a crusty old bird who\x{2019}s forgotten more than the younger men could ever know. (Otto Schwindell without the Pall Malls or the hair growing out my ears.) She says quite confidently, all the while smiling at me, that she hopes I can get around to doing something memorable, and for a moment I think again about bringing up the Marine cuff links and their general relation to things memorable, and possibly dropping in Ann\x{2019}s name\x{2014}not wanting to seem unable to or as if Ann\x{2019}s very existence were a reproach to Sally, which it isn\x{2019}t.

Her very moment as a lost human entity was at once seismically registered on all she\x{2019}d touched. But on any day I can rise and go about all my normal duties in a normal way; or I could drive down to Trenton, pull off a convenience-store stickup or a contract hit, then fly off to Caribou, Alberta, walk off naked into the muskeg and no one would notice much of anything out of the ordinary about my life, or even register I was gone. It could take days, possibly weeks, for serious personal dust to be raised.
