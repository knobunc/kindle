         now fifty-six, lying in an unwet XL Speedo-brand swimsuit in an incrementally reclinable canvas deck chair on the tile deck

         mosaic tile, at <<10:20 A.M.|2a>> on 15 May 1995, the fourth most anthologized poet in the history of American belles lettres, near an umbrella but not in
         the actual shade of the umbrella, reading Newsweek magazine,
         
            2
         
          using the modest swell of his abdomen as an angled support for the magazine, also wearing thongs, one hand behind his head,
         the other hand out to the side and trailing on the dun-and-ochre filigree of the deck\x{2019}s expensive Spanish ceramic tile, occasionally
         wetting a finger to turn the page, wearing prescription sunglasses whose lenses were chemically treated to darken in fractional
         proportion to the luminous intensity of the light to which they were exposed, wearing on the trailing hand a wristwatch of
         middling quality and expense, simulated-rubber thongs on his feet, legs crossed at the ankle and knees slightly spread, the
         sky cloudless and brightening as the morning\x{2019}s sun moved up and right, wetting a finger not with saliva or perspiration but
         with the condensation on the slender frosted glass of iced tea that rested now just on the border of his body\x{2019}s shadow to
         the chair\x{2019}s upper left and would have to be moved to remain in that cool shadow, tracing a finger idly down the glass\x{2019}s side
         before bringing the moist finger idly up to the page, occasionally turning the pages of the 19 September 1994 edition of Newsweek magazine, reading about American health-care reform and about USAir\x{2019}s tragic Flight 427, reading a summary and favorable
         review of the popular nonfiction volumes Hot Zone and The Coming Plague, sometimes turning several pages in succession, skimming certain articles and summaries, an eminent American poet now four
         months short of his fifty-seventh birthday, a poet whom Newsweek magazine\x{2019}s chief competitor, Time, had once rather absurdly called \x{2018}the closest thing to a genuine literary immortal now living,\x{2019} his shins nearly hairless,
         the open umbrella\x{2019}s elliptic shadow tightening slightly, the thongs\x{2019} simulated rubber pebbled on both sides of the sole, the
         poet\x{2019}s forehead dotted with perspiration, his tan deep and rich, the insides of his upper legs nearly hairless, his penis
         curled tightly on itself inside the tight swimsuit, his Vandyke neatly trimmed, an ashtray on the iron table, not drinking
         his iced tea, occasionally clearing his throat, at intervals shifting slightly in the pastel deck chair to scratch idly at
         the instep of one foot with the big toe of the other foot without removing his thongs or looking at either foot, seemingly
         intent on the magazine, the blue pool to his right and the home\x{2019}s thick glass sliding rear door to his oblique left, between
         himself and the pool a round table of white woven iron impaled at the center by a large beach umbrella whose shadow now no
         longer touches the pool, an indisputably accomplished poet, reading his magazine in his chair on his deck by his pool behind
         his home. The home\x{2019}s pool and deck area is surrounded on three sides by trees and shrubbery. The trees and shrubbery, installed
         years before, are densely interwoven and tangled and serve the same essential function as a redwood privacy fence or a wall
         of fine stone. It is the height of spring, and the trees and shrubbery are in full leaf and are intensely green and still,
         and are complexly shadowed, and the sky is wholly blue and still, so that the whole enclosed tableau of pool and deck and
         poet and chair and table and trees and home\x{2019}s rear fa\x{e7}ade is very still and composed and very nearly wholly silent, the soft
         gurgle of the pool\x{2019}s pump and drain and the occasional sound of the poet clearing his throat or turning the pages of Newsweek magazine the only sounds\x{2014}not a bird, no distant lawn mowers or hedge trimmers or weed-eating devices, no jets overhead or
         distant muffled sounds from the pools of the homes on either side of the poet\x{2019}s home\x{2014}nothing but the pool\x{2019}s respiration and
         poet\x{2019}s occasional cleared throat, wholly still and composed and enclosed, not even a hint of a breeze to stir the leaves of
         the trees and shrubbery, the silent living enclosing flora\x{2019}s motionless green vivid and inescapable and not like anything
         else in the world in either appearance or suggestion.

            "Galvanic crisis notwithstanding, Jeni Roberts felt awkward and very nearly mortified with embarrassment as she and the ex-lover
         met and selected their meal options and sat down together in a windowside booth of molded plastic and made radically incongruous
         small talk while she prepared to try to ask the question that would accidentally precipitate her epiphany and a whole new
         less innocent and self-deluded stage of her married life. She had decaf in a disposable cup and put in six prepackaged creamers
         as her former sexual partner sat with his entree\x{2019}s styrofoam box unopened and gazed both through the window and at her. He
         had a ring on his pinkiefinger and his sportcoat was unbuttoned, and the white shirt beneath the coat bore the distinctive
         furrows of an oxfordcloth dress shirt that had only recently been removed from its retail packaging. The sunlight through
         the big window was <<noon|13>>-colored and made the crowded franchise feel like a greenhouse; it was hard to breathe. The associate
         sales manager watched as she started the tops of the creamers with her teeth to safeguard her nails and removed them and placed
         them in the foil ashtray and dumped the thimblefuls of creamer into the disposable cup and stirred them in with a complimentary
         square-tipped stirrer one after another, the look in his developmentally appropriate eye the puddly look of nostalgia. She
         was still profligate with the creamer. She had both a wedding band and a diamond engagement ring, and the rock wasn\x{2019}t cheap
         by a long shot. The former lover\x{2019}s stomach hurt and eye-flesh ticced especially bad now because of how now they were in the
         dreaded last three bank days of the month and Mad Mike\x{2019}s Hyundai put unbelievable pressure on reps to move units in the last
         three days so they could go on that month\x{2019}s books and inflate the books for the clowns in the regional office. The young wife
         cleared her throat several times in her special way that the man solely responsible for the performance of all Mad Mike\x{2019}s
         reps remembered all too well, doing the dry nervous thing with her throat to communicate the fact that she recognized how
         inappropriate a question like this was going to appear now at this juncture, with them with their unhappy history and now
         no longer in any way even like marginally connected, and her happily married, and that she felt embarrassed but was also in
         some kind of she was saying genuine inner-crisis-type situation about something, and desperate\x{2014}the way usually only serious
         credit problems made people look desperate and trapped like this\x{2014}with her eyes with that drowning look in them of she was
         begging him not to take advantage of her desperate position in any way including judgment or ridicule at her expense. Plus
         and how she always drank her coffee with two hands around the cup even in a hot environs like this one here. Hyundai-U.S.\x{2019}s
         volume, margins, and financing terms were among the countless economic conditions affected by fluctuations in the value of
         the yen and related Pacific currencies. The young wife had spent an hour at the mirror in order to choose the shapeless blouse
         and slacks she wore, actually taking her soft contacts back out in order to wear her glasses as well, and nothing on her face
         in the windowlight but a quick dab-and-blot of gloss. The expressway\x{2019}s heavy flow glittered through the window that lit up
         her right side with sun; and through the glass the Mad Mike\x{2019}s lot, with its plastic pennants and a man in a wheelchair with
         his wife or like nurse getting worked by fat Kidder in the hospital gown and arrow-through-head-prosthesis the reps all had
         to wear on the days Messerly was there to keep tabs, lay also within the divided purview of the booth\x{2019}s former lover\x{2014}who still
         loved her, Jeni Ann Orzolek of Marketing 204, and not his current fianc\x{e9}e, he realized with the sickening wince of a mortal
         wound reopened\x{2014}and just beyond it, shimmering in the heat, the Adult World lot, with its all makes and classes of vehicle
         day and night, moving them through like Mad Mike Messerly could only fantasize.",

            "\x{2018}Yes yes and because the state itself existed in close ideological and defensive alliance with many neighboring satellite
         states, and, of course, also was in communication and trade with countless other of the world\x{2019}s nations, I all too quickly,
         as an adolescent, trying merely to masturbate in private, found out that my single fantasy of unknown seduction outside time
         required that the very world\x{2019}s entire population itself must be frozen by the single hand\x{2019}s gesture, all of the entire world\x{2019}s
         timepieces and activities, from the activities of yam farming in Nigeria to those of affluent Westerners purchasing blue jeans
         and Rock and Roll, on, on\x{2026} and you see of course yes not merely all human motion and time-measurings but of course the very
         movements of the earth\x{2019}s clouds, oceans, and prevailing winds, for it is hardly consistent to reanimate the earth\x{2019}s population
         to awareness at a resumed time of <<two o\x{2019}clock|6>> with the tides and weathers, whose cycles have been scientifically catalogued
         to an exacting specificity, now in conditions corresponding to <<three o\x{2019}clock|6>> or <<four|20a>>. This is what I was meaning in referring
         to the responsibilities which come with such powers, responsibilities which the American program of Bewitched had wholly suppressed and neglected during my childish viewing. For this labor of freezing and holding suspended of each
         element of the natural world of earth which intruded to occur to me as I only am attempting to envision the attractive, athletic,
         uncontrollable cries of passion beneath me on the worn mat\x{2014}these labors of imagination were exhausting to me. Episodes of
         masturbation fantasy which used to take up only fifteen brief minutes were now requiring many hours and enormous mental labors.
         My health, never good, declined in a dramatic fashion in this period, so much so so that I was often bedridden and absent
         from my schools and from the State Exercise Facilities which my brother attended with my mother after school period. Also,
         my brother began at this time to become a competitive power weight-lifter in the light divisions of his age and weight, competitions
         of lifting which our mother often attended, traveling along with him, while my father remained on duty with the targeting
         programs and I in bed in our empty quarters alone for whole days in a row. Most of my times alone in the bed in our room in
         their absence were increasingly devoted, not to masturbating, but in the labor of imagination of constructing a sufficiently
         motionless and atemporal planet earth to allow my fantasy merely to take place at all. I do not, in fact, remember now whether
         the American program\x{2019}s implicit doctrine required the circular hand motion of Elizabeth Montgomery to deanimate the whole
         of humanity and the natural world outside the suburban home she shared with Darion. But I vividly do remember that a new,
         different television performer assumed the role of Darion late in my childhood, near the end of the American program\x{2019}s availability
         from transmitters in the Aleutian, and my discomfiture, even as a child, at the inconsistency that Elizabeth Montgomery would
         fail to recognize that her industrialist mate and sexual partner was now altogether a different man. He did not look similar
         at all and she remained oblivious! This had caused me some great distress. Of course, also there was the sun.\x{2019}",

         & had sold his house & tank of pedigreed carp & moved into a freebase fleabag in an infamous Venetian residency hotel known

         center & shared but a single large-screen CCTV monitor & remote between them. Under Codependae\x{2019}s direction their images began
         to kibbitz at Nar\x{2019}s psyche, & to Foretell. There are at this point long, long Ovidian lyrics about the vengeful Goddess\x{2019}s

         man, even in the much-Enhanced fluorescent basin, being divine-looking enough to hold the rapt gaze of demographic millions),
         but that a bona fide female Narcissus-grade object will, ironically, be found by Nar no farther away than his own neocolonial home\x{2019}s bassinet or the
         cover of last week\x{2019}s Guide: yes his Love-Dumpling, esse, his Leettle Preenciss, who will, however, the custodian says the \$88.95 entrails Foretell in no uncertain terms, herself
         prove to be the cause of Nar\x{2019}s own personal doom\x{2014}vanishing then with an eerie & not all that Hispanic or even masculine laugh.
         Nevertheless, properly freaked by the prophecy, the still-dreaming Nar (yes this is all still in the dream, on which Codependae
         has spared no effort or expense) the still-dreaming A.M.N. remands Sissee\x{2019}s new Norse reproduction to the purgatory of a permanent
         4\x{2013}5 A.M. slot, when even 24-hr-loop demographics are grim. Yet fatalistically alas, for this weeest-hour slot is also the slot when
         all the really seriously insomniac drug freaks & neurasthenics & flameouts & lunatic stalker-type S-NN fans tune faithfully
         in; & no fewer than about 400 different lunatic stalkertype fans start stalking his narcoBrynhildic baby, sometimes actually
         bumping into one another in mid-stalk outside Sissee\x{2019}s S-NN dressing room; & but eventually in the dream one of the stalkers
         finally accomplishes his mission, & she dies in a hail of laser-scoped semiautomatic gas-tipped bullets; & even though in
         the dream\x{2019}s remainder Agon M. Nar himself doesn\x{2019}t get killed off (so the carbuncular custodian\x{2019}s prophecy isn\x{2019}t fulfilled
         within the dream itself) A.M.N. feels so horrible & benighted by REM-cycle\x{2019}s end that he\x{2019}s pretty sure when he wakes up at
         <<5 A.M.|5>> that if the dream\x{2019}s epilogue hadn\x{2019}t been preempted by his Hispanic houseboy\x{2019}s gentle prod Nar would also have bought it just
         from sheer Laiusian grief & guilt.",

         out to me that I\x{2019}m blind. As in literally blind, unsighted, etc. Or else it\x{2019}s in the presence of this person that I suddenly
         realize I\x{2019}m blind. What happens when I realize this is I get sad. It makes me incredibly sad that I\x{2019}m blind. The person somehow
         knows how sad I am and warns me that crying will hurt my eyes somehow and make the blindness even worse, but I can\x{2019}t help
         it. I sit down and start crying really hard. I wake crying in bed, and I\x{2019}m crying so hard I can\x{2019}t really see anything or make
         anything out or anything. This makes me cry even harder. My girlfriend is concerned and wakes up and asks what\x{2019}s the matter,
         and it\x{2019}s a minute or more before I can even get it together enough to realize that I was dreaming and I\x{2019}m awake and not really
         blind and that I\x{2019}m crying for no reason, then to tell my girlfriend about the dream and get her input on it. Then all day
         at work then I\x{2019}m incredibly conscious of my eyesight and my eyes and how good it is to be able to see colors and people\x{2019}s
         faces and to know exactly where I am, and of how fragile it all is, the human eye mechanism and the ability to see, how easily
         it could be lost, how I\x{2019}m always seeing blind people around with their canes and strange-looking faces and am always just
         thinking of them as interesting to spend a couple seconds looking at and never thinking they had anything to do with me or
         my eyes, and how it\x{2019}s really just a lucky coincidence that I can see instead of being one of those blind people I see on the
         subway. And all day at work whenever this stuff strikes me I start tearing up again, getting ready to start crying, and only
         keeping myself from crying because of the cubicles\x{2019} low partitions and how everybody can see me and would be concerned, and
         the whole day after the dream is like this, and it\x{2019}s tiring as hell, my girlfriend would say emotionally draining, and I sign
         out early and go home and I\x{2019}m so tired and sleepy I can barely keep my eyes open, and when I get home I go right in and crawl
         in bed at like <<4:00 in the afternoon|2a>> and more or less pass out.",
