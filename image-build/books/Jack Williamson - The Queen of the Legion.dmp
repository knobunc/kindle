In stifling <<midnight|13>>.
The blue glare filtering through the bars made a pool of light around her on the wide stone floor. Black stone loomed ahead and around the gate behind her, walling a broad tunnel that reached off into the dark. Far away along it, she found another tiny island of light. Beyond that, yet another.",

She went back to the Hawkshead House to make her farewells and pick up her bag. The refugees from the ship were sitting in the lobby, still relating alarming tales about the lunatic Prince and his demoniac robots.
