"This next portion is the real reason I asked ATC to make the main tank available to us, Ma\'am. What you\'re about to see is a recreation of the relevant portion of the actual engagement, drawn from the sensor logs of all surviving units of Task Group Hancock-Zero-Zero-One. There are holes in the data, due to the task group\'s heavy losses, but we\'ve been able to fill most of them by interpolating captured data from Admiral Chin\'s dreadnoughts. Using that information, ATC\'s computers have generated the equivalent of a combat information center display at a time compression of - " Ortiz glanced back at her memo pad " - <<approximately five-to-one|10>>, beginning shortly before Admiral Sarnow was wounded."',

She was paler than her pictures, and they hadn\'t done justice to her beauty, yet she was unmistakable. Anticipation stirred as he watched her scan the <<midday|13>> diners, but another, unexpected element tugged at his attention.Two men in unfamiliar uniforms flanked her, and their postures sounded a mental alert. They were bodyguards, and good ones. They faced slightly away from one another, dividing the restaurant and its patrons into sectors of responsibility almost by instinct, and the pulsers at their hips were as much a part of them as their hands or feet. He didn\'t know where she\'d gotten them, but they were far more than mere hired muscle, and that bothered him. Who were they, and what were they doing with Harrington? Was more going on here than his patron had seen fit to mention?',
