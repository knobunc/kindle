            "His life was unobtrusive and cultivated. An amateur painter and musician (these other arts are wittily invoked in Tristram Shandy), he was also something of a writer. But it was not until <<1759|9c:0>> \x{2013} immediately following the suppression of The Good Warm Watch-Coat, which had offended local susceptibilities \x{2013} that he began The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. His marriage was crumbling, and his wife was temporarily insane. It was against this grim background that he flung himself into a work of exuberant humour. After six weeks he had reached Chapter XVIII; after six months, the first two volumes were completed. His offer to the publisher Dodsley was at first rejected. But a small edition was put out, and Sterne found himself famous. Acclaimed by men as different as David Garrick and Bishop Warburton, Sterne had hospitality and flattery lavished on him. He was commissioned to supply fresh volumes. He was invited to Windsor. His portrait was painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. \x{2018}I wrote, not to be fed but to be famous,\x{2019} he said.",

            "Visiting London in 1766, he met Mrs Eliza Draper, then in her twenties. With her he engaged in a sentimental and flowery love-affair, broken after a few months by her return to her middle-aged husband in Bombay. (Sterne\x{2019}s mawkish Journal to Eliza was not published until <<1904|18:0>>.) The homecoming of Mrs Sterne did not improve matters, but she was persuaded to return to France. A Sentimental Journey was completed, and published in February 1768. A month later, Sterne was fatally ill; influenza became pleurisy, and he died on 18 March 1768. His brief but hectic writing life was over, and he left debts of \x{a3}1,100 and assets of \x{a3}400. Fortunately he had also left a comic masterpiece.",

            "More recently, Salman Rushdie in <<Midnight|13>>\x{2019}s Children, Juan Goytisolo in Juan the Landless and Carlos Fuentes in Christopher Unborn have all written major fictions of national identity, the roots of which are buried in Tristram Shandy. No other eighteenth-century fiction can claim so specific, so glorious, a progeny. But even when one can agree that these authors were all influenced by Sterne, one can also dispute, as I have been doing, the notion that Sterne\x{2019}s achievement was to herald our secular, existential, autonomous world, or to \x{2018}create\x{2019} a new shape to the \x{2018}novel\x{2019}.
