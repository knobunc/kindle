Don\x{2019}t let them tie you down. Don\x{2019}t let them clip you\x{2014}your words or your deeds. You\x{2019}re a Soldier.

It\x{2019}s too thin, Bruce, when you come from <<1917|9c:1>> and haven\x{2019}t been on the Big Time for a hundred sleeps and were calling for an A-tech yourself a few hours ago. Much too thin.
