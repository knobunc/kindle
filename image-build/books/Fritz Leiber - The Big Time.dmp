Don\x{2019}t let them tie you down. Don\x{2019}t let them clip you\x{2014}your words or your deeds. You\x{2019}re a Soldier. Even when you talked about a peace message, you talked about doing some smashing of your own.

Bruce, something is going to happen that I\x{2019}m afraid you won\x{2019}t like, but you\x{2019}re going to have to put up with it. That is, unless Miss Foster decides to be cooperative.\x{201d}",
