Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there?',

            "\x{201c}Well, we\x{2019}ve been thinking about it for some time\x{2014}all winter in fact,\x{201d} returned Marilla. \x{201c}Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in Hopetown in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs. Spencer has visited her and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have talked it over off and on ever since. We thought we\x{2019}d get a boy. Matthew is getting up in years, you know\x{2014}he\x{2019}s sixty\x{2014}and he isn\x{2019}t so spry as he once was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate hard it\x{2019}s got to be to get hired help. There\x{2019}s never anybody to be had but those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he\x{2019}s up and off to the lobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a Barnado boy. But I said \x{2018}no\x{2019} flat to that. \x{2018}They may be all right\x{2014}I\x{2019}m not saying they\x{2019}re not\x{2014}but no London street Arabs for me,\x{2019} I said. \x{2018}Give me a native born at least. There\x{2019}ll be a risk, no matter who we get. But I\x{2019}ll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian.\x{2019} So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she was going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer\x{2019}s folks at Carmody to bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that would be the best age\x{2014}old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him a good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today\x{2014}the mail man brought it from the station\x{2014}saying they were coming on the <<five-thirty|5f>> train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to meet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to White Sands station herself.\x{201d}",

Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really thought. So I thought it over after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And I came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn\x{2019}t born for city life and that I was glad of it. It\x{2019}s nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at <<eleven o\x{2019}clock at night|6>> once in awhile; but as a regular thing I\x{2019}d rather be in the east gable at <<eleven|9c:1>>, sound asleep, but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook.
