I started off with this picture of the two people and let them carry on from there. It wasn\x{2019}t a deliberate switch from one kind of writing to another. It was quite a natural movement. A friend of mine, Henry Woolf, produced the result \x{2013} The Room \x{2013} at Bristol University, and a few months later in January 1958 it was included \x{2013} in a different production \x{2013} in the festival of university drama.

I write because I want to write. I don\x{2019}t see any placards on myself, and I don\x{2019}t carry any banners. Ultimately I distrust definitive labels. As far as the state of the theatre is concerned, I\x{2019}m as conscious as anyone else of the flaws of procedure, of taste, of the general set-up in management, and I think things will go on more or less as they are for some considerable time. But it seems to me that there has been a certain development in one channel or another in the past three years. The Caretaker wouldn\x{2019}t have been put on, and certainly wouldn\x{2019}t have run, <<before 1957|9:0>>. The old categories of comedy and tragedy and farce are irrelevant, and the fact that managers seem to have realized that is one favourable change. But writing for the stage is the most difficult thing of all, whatever the system. I find it more difficult the more I think about it.",
