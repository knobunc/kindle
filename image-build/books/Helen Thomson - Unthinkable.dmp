I was twenty, I was in college full time and I was also working in a mental health center as an orderly. On March thirteenth that year I had done some impressions in class and people loved it, so I was being taken up to the main campus to do a speech course. It was a beautiful spring-weather day. I went to <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>> mass because I had to work <<seven till three|10>> and I remember walking to church up these steps and being very aware of how happy I was. Then I worked and went to a bowling class. I went home and drove my car up to the branch campus and we met the professor and two other students. I\x{2019}d never been up to the main campus and it was hustle and bustle and beautiful and I was very aware of that. I remember the whole day and all my feelings, as well as the cool breeze against my face. It was just a really nice day.\x{201d}",
