The entry for <<10:33 a.m.|2a>>, typed by Groves\x{2019}s secretary, summarized the contents of a telephone call from a top navy officer: \x{201c}Admiral Edwards just called to ascertain if the material we got from the German submarines was of any use to the program. General advised it wasn\x{2019}t of any help as yet, but that it would be utilized.\x{201d} As a compulsive micromanager, Groves certainly would have had knowledge of such a detail, and he would have had no known motivation to hide the truth from a U.S. Navy admiral during a secure phone call.",

I got out of the car and listened to the countdown and when the last minute arrived I looked for my dark goggles but couldn\x{2019}t find them. So I sat on the ground in case the explosion blew me over, plugged my ears with my fingers, and looked the direction away from the explosion as I listened to the end of the count . . . <<five|9k:0>>, <<four|9k:0>>, <<three|9k:0>>, <<two|9k:0>>, <<one|9k:0>>. . . . And then without a sound, the sun was shining; or so it looked. The sand hills at the edge of the desert were shimmering in a very bright light, almost colorless and shapeless. The light did not seem to change for a couple of seconds and then began to dim. I turned around but that object on the horizon that looked like a small sun was still too bright to look at. I kept blinking and trying to take looks, and after another ten seconds or so it had grown and dimmed into something more like a huge oil fire, with a structure that made it look a bit like a strawberry. . . . The bang came minutes later, quite loud though I had plugged my ears, and followed by a long rumble like heavy traffic very far away. I can still hear it.",
