The entry for <<10:33 a.m.|2a>>, typed by Groves\x{2019}s secretary, summarized the contents of a telephone call from a top navy officer: \x{201c}Admiral Edwards just called to ascertain if the material we got from the German submarines was of any use to the program.

And then without a sound, the sun was shining; or so it looked. The sand hills at the edge of the desert were shimmering in a very bright light, almost colorless and shapeless. The light did not seem to change for a couple of seconds and then began to dim. I turned around but that object on the horizon that looked like a small sun was still too bright to look at. I kept blinking and trying to take looks, and after another ten seconds or so it had grown and dimmed into something more like a huge oil fire, with a structure that made it look a bit like a strawberry. . . . The bang came minutes later, quite loud though I had plugged my ears, and followed by a long rumble like heavy traffic very far away. I can still hear it.",

Gomez (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1994). Also of great help was the dissertation \x{201c}A History of the Uranium Industry on the Colorado Plateau,\x{201d} by Gary Shumway, University of Southern California, Jan. 1970. Shumway\x{2019}s master\x{2019}s thesis, \x{201c}The Development of the Uranium Industry in San Juan County, Utah,\x{201d} Brigham Young University, July 1964, also provided source material. Some background on the geology of the Colorado Plateau and the initial mining bonanza was taken from \x{201c}The Uranium Rush,\x{201d} by Tom Zoellner, the American Heritage of Invention & Technology, Summer 2000; The Redrock Chronicles, by Tom H. Watkins (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000); and \x{201c}The Time of the Great Fever,\x{201d} by Larry Meyer,  American Heritage, June/July 1981. The \x{201c}Good for nothing\x{201d} quote originally appeared in Grand Memories, by Phyllis Cortes (Grand County, Utah: Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, 1978), and was quoted in \x{201c}Hot Rocks Made Big Waves,\x{201d} by Amberly Knight, in Utah Historical Quarterly, Winter 2001, as well as the Fall 2006 edition of Canyon Legacy, the journal of the Dan O\x{2019}Laurie Museum in Moab. The hyperbolic True West article was reprinted in Canyon Legacy,  Summer 2006. The bogus uranium foundations were first reported in \x{201c}Quackery in the Atomic Age,\x{201d} in BusinessWeek, Aug. 29, 1953. Some of the quotes from Utah miners in the 1950s\x{2014}including Jerry Anderson and Oren Zufelt\x{2014}were drawn from an archive of oral history at California State University, Fullerton, established by Professor Gary Shumway. The naming controversy in Moab comes from The Far Country: A Regional History of Moab and La Sal, Utah, by Faun McConkie Tanner (Salt Lake City: Olympic Publishing, 1976). The anecdotes about the circling airplanes and the staked highway are from One Man\x{2019}s West, by David Lavender (New York: Doubleday, 1964). Quotes from Paddy Martinez were taken from \x{201c}The Coming Thing,\x{201d} by Daniel Lang, in the  New Yorker, Mar. 21, 1953. The Popeye cartoon was described in \x{201c}Uranium on  the Cranium,\x{201d} an essay by Michael Admundson in the anthology Atomic Culture: How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, ed.

But this section depended most heavily upon Uranium Frenzy, by Raye Ringholz (Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1989), the definitive history of the uranium story in the American Southwest, which also provides the most comprehensive account available of Steen\x{2019}s Mi Vida strike and the efforts of the AEC to cover up the radioactive disaster. The angry speech at Texas Western College, as well as several other episodes in the life of Steen, and of Utah\x{2019}s stock bubble, were drawn from Ringholz\x{2019}s impressive work. John Black\x{2019}s remembrances were in Blue Mountain Shadows,  Winter 2001, published by the San Juan County Historic Society. Tom McCourt\x{2019}s recollections of Moab, as well as his reflections on patriotism, were taken from White Canyon: Remembering the Little Town at the Bottom of Lake Powell (Price, Utah: Southpaw Publications, 2003). Joe Blosser\x{2019}s quote is in \x{201c}Uranium Is People,\x{201d} by Paul Schubert, in Empire magazine, reprinted in Reader\x{2019}s Digest, Mar. 1953. The Dr. Seuss incident is related in \x{201c}Man on Probation in Attempt to Extort Dr. Seuss Estate,\x{201d} by Onell R. Soto, in the San Diego Union Tribune, Aug. 21, 2004. Background on the AEC cover-up was drawn from The Myths of August, by Stewart Udall (New York: Pantheon, 1994). The Navajo section drew from the excellent If You Poison Us: Uranium and Native Americans, by Peter Eichstaedt (Santa Fe, N.M.: Red Crane Books, 1994), which contains details on the economics of reservation mining, as well as interviews with miners, including Ben Jones, and information on hazards that still remain. \x{201c}Blighted Homeland,\x{201d} a four-part series by Judy Pasternak in the Los Angeles Times, Nov. <<19-22|5a:1>>, 2007, examined the lasting health and environmental impacts and was the source of the \x{201c}Saudi Arabia\x{201d} remark. The story \x{201c}Udall: Navajo \x{2018}Cancer Free\x{2019} Until Uranium,\x{201d} by Kathy Helms, in the Gallup Independent,  Nov. 15, 2007, had further historical background. The comments of the Navajo miner Willie Johnson came from \x{201c}Toxic Targets,\x{201d} by Jim Motavalli, in E magazine, July 1998. An evocative fictional account of the afterlife of a uranium town can be found in the novel Yellowcake, by Ann Cummins (Boston: Houghton  Mifflin, 2007). Health data comes from \x{201c}Lung Cancer in a Nonsmoking Uranium Miner,\x{201d} by Karen B. Mulloy et al., in Environmental Health Perspectives  109 (2001); \x{201c}The History of Uranium Mining and the Navajo People,\x{201d} by Doug Brugge and Rob Goble, in American Journal of Public Health, Sept. 2002; \x{201c}Lung Cancer Risk Among German Male Uranium Miners,\x{201d} by B.

Mapel, in Environmental and Occupational Medicine, 1998. The foremost historians of the postwar uranium era in Europe are Rainer Karlsch of the Free University of Berlin and Zbynek Zeman of Oxford University. Their recently translated book Uranium Matters: Central European Uranium in International Politics, 1900-1960 (Budapest: Central European University Press, 2008), was a source for a few details in this chapter, including the supposed \x{201c}acts of sabotage\x{201d} at Wismut and the bedsheets at St. Joachimsthal. Details on the diplomatic background to the Czechoslovakian-Soviet accords, as well as a wealth of information about the Jachymov gulag, come from two illuminating articles by Zbynek Zeman: \x{201c}The Beginnings of National Enterprise Jachymov (Joachimsthal),\x{201d} in Der Anschnitt, Mar. 1998, and \x{201c}Czech Uranium and Stalin\x{2019}s Bomb,\x{201d} in Historian, Autumn 2000. Frantisek Sedivy was kind enough to give me a copy of his autobiography, The Legion of the Living (Prague: Eva-Milan Nevole, 2003), which supplied some of the details of his incarceration. He also wrote a novel based on his experience called Under the Tower of Death (Prague: Eva-Milan Nevole, 2003). Translations of key portions of these important books were supplied to me by Marketa Naylor. The anecdote about the dog and the description of the town in St. Joachimsthal comes from \x{201c}Soft Norms in a Spa,\x{201d} by Joseph Wechsberg, in the New Yorker, May 3, 1952. Quotes from Joseph Stalin were in Stalin and the Bomb, by David Holloway (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1994), and also cited in Bomb Scare, by Joseph Cirincione (New York: Columbia University Press, 2007). Using previously sealed documents from the Eastern bloc, Norman Naimark pieced together an account of the labor situation at Wismut for a section of his book The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945-49 (Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press, 1995), from which I garnered a few details. Information about the culture and operations of Wismut were drawn from materials on exhibit at the excellent Museum Uranbergau in Schlema, Germany; I received translation assistance from the curator, Herman Meinel, and from Martha Brantley, who helped me speak with former Wismut miners. Some health statistics were taken from \x{201c}Wismut: Uranium Exposure Revisited,\x{201d} by Heinz  Otten and Horst Schulz, a research paper published by the International Labor Organization (New York: United Nations, 1998). The former Wismut manager Nikolai Grishin disclosed some state secrets in \x{201c}The Saxony Mining Operation,\x{201d} reprinted in Soviet Economic Policy in Postwar Germany (New York: Research Program on the USSR, 1953). The extent of Western intelligence knowledge about Wismut, though colored by some period bias, can be found in the background paper \x{201c}Zhukov and the Atomic Bomb,\x{201d} author unknown (Munich: Radio Free Europe, 1957), as well as Forced Labor in the \x{201c}People\x{2019}s Democracies,\x{201d} by Richard K. Carlton (Munich: Free Europe Committee, 1955). The policies and practices at Wismut were examined in the unpublished doctoral dissertation \x{201c}The Quest for Uranium: The Soviet Uranium Mining Industry in Eastern Germany, 1945-1967,\x{201d} by Traci Heitschmidt, on file in the library at the University of California-Santa Barbara. The anecdote about the hidden Soviet enrichment plants comes from Shadow Flights: America\x{2019}s Secret Air War Against the Soviet Union, by Curtis Peebles (New York: Presidio Press, 2000), and the declassified background paper titled \x{201c}On the Soviet Nuclear Scent,\x{201d} by Henry S. Lowenhaupt of the Central Intelligence Agency (undated). Some information about the gulag period is drawn from Jachymov: The City of Silver, Radium, and Therapeutic Water, by Hana Hornatova (Prague: Medeia Bohemia, 2000). The discovery stories were recounted in \x{201c}Miner\x{2019}s Luck,\x{201d} by Henry Winfred Splitter, in Western Folklore, Oct. 1956, as well as History of California, by Theodore Henry Hittell (San Francisco: N. J. Stone, 1898).",
