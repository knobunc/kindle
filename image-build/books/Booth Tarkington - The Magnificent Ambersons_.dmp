Trotters were out, in the winter afternoons, racing light sleighs on National Avenue and Tennessee Street; everybody recognized both the trotters and the drivers; and again knew them as well on summer evenings, when slim buggies whizzed by in renewals of the snow-time rivalry. For that matter, everybody knew everybody else\x{2019}s family horse-and-carriage, could identify such a silhouette half a mile down the street, and thereby was sure who was going to market, or to a reception, or coming home from office or store to <<noon|13>> dinner or evening supper.",

            "Against so homespun a background the magnificence of the Ambersons was as conspicuous as a brass band at a funeral. Major Amberson bought two hundred acres of land at the end of National Avenue; and through this tract he built broad streets and cross-streets; paved them with cedar block, and curbed them with stone. He set up fountains, here and there, where the streets intersected, and at symmetrical intervals placed cast-iron statues, painted white, with their titles clear upon the pedestals: Minerva, Mercury, Hercules, Venus, Gladiator, Emperor Augustus, Fisher Boy, Stag-hound, Mastiff, Greyhound, Fawn, Antelope, Wounded Doe, and Wounded Lion. Most of the forest trees had been left to flourish still, and, at some distance, or by moonlight, the place was in truth beautiful; but the ardent citizen, loving to see his city grow, wanted neither distance nor moonlight. He had not seen Versailles, but, standing before the Fountain of Neptune in Amberson Addition, at bright <<noon|13>>, and quoting the favourite comparison of the local newspapers, he declared Versailles outdone. All this Art showed a profit from the start, for the lots sold well and there was something like a rush to build in the new Addition. Its main thoroughfare, an oblique continuation of National Avenue, was called Amberson Boulevard, and here, at the juncture of the new Boulevard and the Avenue, Major Amberson reserved four acres for himself, and built his new house\x{2014}the Amberson Mansion, of course.",

            "The visitor to the town was certain to receive further enlightenment, for there was one form of entertainment never omitted: he was always patriotically taken for \x{201c}a little drive around our city,\x{201d} even if his host had to hire a hack, and the climax of the display was the Amberson Mansion. \x{201c}Look at that greenhouse they\x{2019}ve put up there in the side yard,\x{201d} the escort would continue. \x{201c}And look at that brick stable! Most folks would think that stable plenty big enough and good enough to live in; it\x{2019}s got running water and four rooms upstairs for two hired men and one of \x{2019}em\x{2019}s family to live in. They keep one hired man loafin\x{2019} in the house, and they got a married hired man out in the stable, and his wife does the washing. They got box-stalls for four horses, and they keep a coupay, and some new kinds of fancy rigs you never saw the beat of! \x{2018}Carts\x{2019} they call two of \x{2019}em\x{2014}\x{2019}way up in the air they are\x{2014}too high for me! I guess they got every new kind of fancy rig in there that\x{2019}s been invented. And harness\x{2014}well, everybody in town can tell when Ambersons are out driving after dark, by the jingle. This town never did see so much style as Ambersons are putting on, these days; and I guess it\x{2019}s going to be expensive, because a lot of other folks\x{2019}ll try to keep up with \x{2019}em. The Major\x{2019}s wife and the daughter\x{2019}s been to Europe, and my wife tells me since they got back they make tea there every afternoon <<about five o\x{2019}clock|6>>, and drink it. Seems to me it would go against a person\x{2019}s stomach, just before supper like that, and anyway tea isn\x{2019}t fit for much\x{2014}not unless you\x{2019}re sick or something. My wife says Ambersons don\x{2019}t make lettuce salad the way other people do; they don\x{2019}t chop it up with sugar and vinegar at all. They pour olive oil on it with their vinegar, and they have it separate\x{2014}not along with the rest of the meal. And they eat these olives, too: green things they are, something like a hard plum, but a friend of mine told me they tasted a good deal like a bad hickory-nut. My wife says she\x{2019}s going to buy some; you got to eat nine and then you get to like \x{2019}em, she says. Well, I wouldn\x{2019}t eat nine bad hickory-nuts to get to like them, and I\x{2019}m going to let these olives alone. Kind of a woman\x{2019}s dish, anyway, I suspect, but most everybody\x{2019}ll be makin\x{2019} a stagger to worm through nine of \x{2019}em, now Ambersons brought \x{2019}em to town. Yes, sir, the rest\x{2019}ll eat \x{2019}em, whether they get sick or not! Looks to me like some people in this city\x{2019}d be willing to go crazy if they thought that would help \x{2019}em to be as high-toned as Ambersons. Old Aleck Minafer\x{2014}he\x{2019}s about the closest old codger we got\x{2014}he come in my office the other day, and he pretty near had a stroke tellin\x{2019} me about his daughter Fanny. Seems Miss Isabel Amberson\x{2019}s got some kind of a dog\x{2014}they call it a Saint Bernard\x{2014}and Fanny was bound to have one, too. Well, old Aleck told her he didn\x{2019}t like dogs except rat-terriers, because a rat-terrier cleans up the mice, but she kept on at him, and finally he said all right she could have one. Then, by George! she says Ambersons bought their dog, and you can\x{2019}t get one without paying for it: they cost from fifty to a hundred dollars up! Old Aleck wanted to know if I ever heard of anybody buyin\x{2019} a dog before, because, of course, even a Newfoundland or a setter you can usually get somebody to give you one. He says he saw some sense in payin\x{2019} a nigger a dime, or even a quarter, to drown a dog for you, but to pay out fifty dollars and maybe more\x{2014}well, sir, he like to choked himself to death, right there in my office! Of course everybody realizes that Major Amberson is a fine business man, but what with throwin\x{2019} money around for dogs, and every which and what, some think all this style\x{2019}s bound to break him up, if his family don\x{2019}t quit!\x{201d}",

She turned it most often, observers said, <<toward two|9:0>>: one excelling in the general struggle by his sparkle, and the other by that winning if not winsome old trait, persistence. The sparkling gentleman \x{201c}led germans\x{201d} with her, and sent sonnets to her with his bouquets\x{2014}sonnets lacking neither music nor wit. He was generous, poor, well-dressed, and his amazing persuasiveness was one reason why he was always in debt. No one doubted that he would be able to persuade Isabel, but he unfortunately joined too merry a party one night, and, during a moonlight serenade upon the lawn before the Amberson Mansion, was easily identified from the windows as the person who stepped through the bass viol and had to be assisted to a waiting carriage. One of Miss Amberson\x{2019}s brothers was among the serenaders, and, when the party had dispersed, remained propped against the front door in a state of helpless liveliness; the Major going down in a dressing-gown and slippers to bring him in, and scolding mildly, while imperfectly concealing strong impulses to laughter. Miss Amberson also laughed at this brother, the next day, but for the suitor it was a different matter: she refused to see him when he called to apologize. \x{201c}You seem to care a great deal about bass viols!\x{201d} he wrote her. \x{201c}I promise never to break another.\x{201d} She made no response to the note, unless it was an answer, two weeks later, when her engagement was announced. She took the persistent one, Wilbur Minafer, no breaker of bass viols or of hearts, no serenader at all.",

The orchestra was certainly not that local one which had suffered the loss of a bass viol; the musicians came, according to the prophecy and next morning\x{2019}s paper, from afar; and at <<midnight|13>> the bride was still being toasted in champagne, though she had departed upon her wedding journey at <<ten|9c:1>>.
