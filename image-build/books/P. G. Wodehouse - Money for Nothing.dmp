After the <<five-sixteen|5k:1>>, which I\'d missed, there isn\'t anything till <<nine-twenty|5b>>. And, what with having all this on my mind and getting a bit of dinner and not keeping a proper eye on the clock, I missed that, too. In the end, I had to take the <<three a.m.|5>> milk train. I won\'t attempt to describe to you what a hell of a journey it was, but I got to Rudge at last, and, racing like a hare, rushed to Pat\'s house. I had a sort of idea I might intercept the postman and get him to give me my letter back.\'',
