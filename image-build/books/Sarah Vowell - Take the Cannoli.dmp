We all lived within ten blocks of each other, one big happy family, frequently convening for get-togethers and meals.

This sounds corny, but every morning, the lake is a shock, and I always have a brief, Calvinist moment when I wonder if I\x{2019}m worthy of such a view. Like, am I Great Lakes material? Then, my robotic ritual: walk to coffeemaker, pick up pot, fill with four cups of water, pour said water into machine, take out filter, fill with five and a half spoonfuls of coffee, turn on. While brewing, ingest one stress vitamin, the kind with a picture of a candle burning at both ends (get it?) on the wrapping, open door, grab Chicago Tribune and New York Times, which I read, Times first, in unwavering order: arts section, business section, front page, editorial page, rest of front section, Trib gossip column (it\x{2019}s really gone to hell), and the TV column (still good). In which time I have had two cups of coffee, a bowl of cereal and glass of orange juice, and a third coffee when I got to the Trib. Checked email. Sent email. Took shower. Wrote a review of the new Tom Waits record. I\x{2019}m fond of the ballads, so I wrote that I\x{2019}m fond of the ballads. Which obviously takes one sentence to say, but I spent five hours stretching this into four hundred words. Then lunch\x{2014}turkey sandwich. Did some dishes while listening to Ray Charles. Phone rang. It was Dave, a writer friend. We talked for over an hour, mainly about punctuation. He has big plans for the ellipsis. He\x{2019}s mad for ellipses. I tell him, yeah, I have similar affection for the parenthesis (but I always take most of my parentheses out, so as not to call undue attention to the glaring fact that I cannot think in complete sentences, that I think only in short fragments or long, run-on thought relays that the literati call stream of consciousness but I like to think of as disdain for the finality of the period). Dave is trying to decide whether he wants there to be a space before or after the ellipsis. He\x{2019}s unsure. Is the ellipsis approach powerful because of what is not said after the dot dot dot, or is it a cheap excuse for not being able to verbalize? Conversely, do we parentheticals want to communicate by cramming more in, thus slapping what we\x{2019}re not saying in between what we are, officially, saying? Or is it because we can\x{2019}t decide? After I hung up the phone I turned on the radio and a Randy Newman song was playing, and I thought, oh no, Randy Newman\x{2019}s dead. But he wasn\x{2019}t dead, some of his film music had just been nominated for an Academy Award. So that was nice, Randy Newman not being dead. Went for a walk on the lake, for maybe an hour.
