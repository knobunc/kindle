Her oval face, even though drooping with pain and illness, was lovely, a high forehead, finely arched brows, eyes dark as shadows at <<midnight|13>>, long narrow nose, narrow lips, a firm chin, an air of command. Silver frosted her softly waved chestnut hair. She rested against the cushion, her gaze remote, sorrow her companion. She was in the room yet she seemed distant and unapproachable. There were no garlands of evergreen, no flicker of red candles, no red-and-green taffeta bows in this room. On a cushion by her feet, a large calico cat slumbered, her patches of red-and-black fur striking against the white.',

It took only a moment to realize the pictures were primarily of a boy and girl from babyhood to late teens. The dark-haired girl had irregular gamine features and an aura of energy and enthusiasm and good humor. Snapshots showed her making mud pies when she was about six with a missing tooth and a streak of dirt across one cheek. At <<around ten|9c:1>>, bony and thin with sharp elbows and knees, she held aloft a tennis trophy. As a teenager in a d\x{e9}collet\x{e9} white gown, she smiled up at an older man whose irregular features matched her own. The blond boy was cocky with a square jaw and muscular build. He stood stiff and still with a Webelos salute in his Cub Scout uniform. As a Scout, he dangled from a climbing rope over a sandstone gorge. He pinned an opponent in a wrestling match, caught a pass on a football field, strummed a guitar in a pensive mood.",
