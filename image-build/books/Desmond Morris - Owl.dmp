            'The best-known Greek coin on which the owl appeared was the tetradrachm, the four drachm silver piece, but it appeared on coins of many denominations, including the decadrachm and the less valuable didrachm, drachm, hemidrachm, tetrobol, diobol, trihemiobol, obol, hemiobol, tritartemorion, trihemitartemorion, tetartemorion and hemiartemorion. (The challenge of working out the change when shopping in the agora must have been daunting.) The drachm was a coinage unit based on weight. One Greek drachm = <<4.37|5a:0>> gm. These coins live on, even today, in the form of the modern Greek 1 euro coin, of which the Athenian owl is the centrepiece. In recent years the Athenian owl has also appeared both on Greek banknotes and Greek postage stamps. Its fame spread far and wide, and it is claimed that the American president Theodore Roosevelt used to carry an Athenian owl piece with him as a lucky charm.',

By Day-time are no perfect sighted Fowls;
And that the more you do augment the light,
The more you shall deprive them of their sight.

Nor spectacles, nor all of these in one,
Can make an Owlet in the day-time see,
Though none, by night, hath better eyes than she.3',

            "To find New World tribal owls that are portrayed simply for their own sake, as attractive birds without any haunting messages, we have to move south to the Central American country of Panama. There, among the Kuna Indians who inhabit the small islands of the San Blas Archipelago off the northern coast, there is a fascination with birds of many kinds, including the local owls. Images of the owls, and many other animals besides, appear on the clothing of the women who, unlike their male counterparts, have stubbornly retained the traditional costumes of their tribe, even in modern times. They wear decorative chest panels on their dresses, called molas. These are laboriously created by a process of reverse appliqu\x{e9}. It takes <<about 250 hours|1>> of meticulous needlework to complete a good example of one of these molas and they have recently become collected as serious works of tribal art.",

            "Owls appear several times in the work of Belgian surrealist Ren\x{e9} Magritte. Their first portrayal is in a sombre work from <<1942|9c:0>>, called The Companions of Fear. Painted in Brussels during the Nazi occupation of Belgium it depicts a desolate, rocky landscape in which plants are stubbornly breaking through the hard surface. Five of these plants have blossomed, not into flowers, but into green owls. The leaves, as they rise up vertically from the ground, are gradually transformed into the bodies of the owls, creating a leaf/bird hybrid. The image, as in much of Magritte\x{2019}s work, is disturbing because it plays tricks with one\x{2019}s mind. In a letter to a friend, written some years before, the artist commented: \x{2018}I have made a really striking discovery in painting. Up to now . . . the position of an object was sometimes enough to make it mysterious. But as a result of the experiments I\x{2019}ve made here, I have found a new potential in things \x{2013} their ability to become gradually something else, an object merging into an object other than itself . . . By this means I produce pictures which the eye must \x{201c}think\x{201d} in a completely different way from the usual one.\x{2019}14",

This supposed weakness has been the basis for legends and folktales for centuries, but it is simply not true. In fact, the majestic eagle owl has slightly better daytime vision than human beings. The pupils of owls can close right down to pin-pricks, through which a greatly reduced amount of sunlight is allowed to penetrate, enabling them to see even at <<noon|13>>.',

            "In the 1960s some tests were carried out to discover which owls had the best hearing. The results showed that those species living in northern forests had better hearing than those from the tropics. This makes sense when one thinks of what it must be like to hunt at night in a northern pine forest, compared with a tropical rain forest. <<Midnight|13>> in a cold northern forest must be as silent as the grave, where even a mouse\x{2019}s footstep could be heard by a hovering owl. <<Midnight|13>> in a tropical rain forest, on the other hand, with the night air filled with chirping insects and calling frogs, would be much too noisy for an owl to isolate a particular prey by its sounds alone. For tropical owls the half-light of dawn and dusk would inevitably become more important hunting times, when vision could play a bigger role in detecting their prey.",

            'The number of eggs varies enormously in different owls, but for most species <<three to four|10a:0>> is the norm. The female usually allows several days between the laying of each egg, with the result that chicks are of different sizes. If food is plentiful all the chicks thrive but if it is scarce then only the larger chicks will survive. In bad times the younger chicks find it hard to compete for food and may starve to death in the nest, when they themselves will become food for the older chicks. This harsh breeding system ensures that the parents produce the appropriate number of chicks for a particular environment.',
