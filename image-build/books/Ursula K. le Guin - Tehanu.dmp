            "But Tenar had left her living in the Middle Valley. She had not thought when she left so suddenly of how long she might stay. She had not brought with her the seven pieces of ivory, Flint\x{2019}s hoard; nor would that money have been of use in the village except to buy land or livestock, or deal with some trader up from Gont Port peddling pellawi furs or silks of Lorbanery to the rich farmers and little lords of Gont. Flint\x{2019}s farm gave her all she and Therru needed to eat and wear; but Ogion\x{2019}s six goats and his beans and onions had been for his pleasure rather than his need. She had been living off his larder, the gifts of villagers who gave to her for his sake, and the generosity of Aunty Moss. Just yesterday the witch had said, \x{201c}Dearie, my ringneck hen\x{2019}s brood\x{2019}s hatched out, and I\x{2019}ll bring you <<two-three|5l:0>> chickies when they begin to scratch. The mage wouldn\x{2019}t keep \x{2019}em, too noisy and silly, he said, but what\x{2019}s a house without chickies at the door?\x{201d}",

            'Still very weary from the long distress and strain of the day before, she was content to sit in the seat the bald sailor contrived for her out of a straw mattress and a piece of sailcloth, and watch the waves and the gulls, and see the outline of Gont Mountain, blue and dreamy in the <<noon|13>> light, changing as they skirted its steep shores only a mile or two out from land. She brought Therru up to be in the sunshine, and the child lay beside her, watching and dozing.',
