            "These unknown heroes were known as the \x{201c}Monuments Men,\x{201d} a group of soldiers who served in the Western Allied military effort from 1943 until <<1951|9c:0>>. Their initial responsibility was to mitigate combat damage, primarily to structures\x{2014}churches, museums, and other important monuments. As the war progressed and the German border was breached, their focus shifted to locating movable works of art and other cultural items stolen or otherwise missing. During their occupation of Europe, Hitler and the Nazis pulled off the \x{201c}greatest theft in history,\x{201d} seizing and transporting more than five million cultural objects to the Third Reich. The Western Allied effort, spearheaded by the Monuments Men, thus became the \x{201c}greatest treasure hunt in history,\x{201d} with all the unimaginable and bizarre stories that only war can produce. It was also a race against time, for hidden in the most incredible locations, some of which have inspired modern-day popular icons like Sleeping Beauty\x{2019}s Castle at Disneyland and The Sound of Music, were tens of thousands of the world\x{2019}s greatest artistic masterpieces, many stolen by the Nazis, including priceless paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, Jan Vermeer, and Rembrandt, and sculptures by Michelangelo and Donatello.

The synagogue was filled to capacity. This was a ceremony to honor his passage into adulthood, his hope for the future, but to so many the chance for a life in Karlsruhe seemed lost. The jobs were gone; the Jewish community was shunned and harassed; Hitler was daring the Western powers to oppose him.

This was not the case, as film footage and documents from the period prove. The Austrian government, however, was quick to buttress this aura of innocence, and even produced a defense of its actions known as the Red-White-Red-Book (mocked by many as \x{201c}The Viennese Masquerade\x{201d}) in 1946.
 In it, the self-described Austrian Resistance claimed it knew of the artistic treasures at Altaussee and had forced Kaltenbrunner at gunpoint to rescind Hitler\x{2019}s order to destroy them. The claim was absurd. While the Austrian Resistance was active in the Aussee area, they had no knowledge of the artwork and no influence on activities at the mine. Their only real role was, weeks later, to supplement the meager American guard. Nonetheless, by <<1948|9:0>> the Resistance, with the support of the Austrian government, was claiming primary responsibility for saving Altaussee.
