Now they were all quietly drowning to death in some field-hospital.The night before the attack nobody could sleep. At <<four in the morning|9a>>, when it was already light Frank and Jack lolled against the sandbagged wall of the trench while Frank rolled a cigarette for each of them and one for Alf Simmonds who was ducked down on the firing-step above them on sentry duty.

            "There are fearsome consequences for children who do not reclaim their property \x{2013} ownership is easy to trace as it is compulsory to have Cash\x{2019}s woven name tapes sewn into everything we possess, including our bras, and the insides of our shoes, boots and plimsolls must be marked with indelible marker pen. Constant random checks are done to make sure we are tagged properly. (Did anyone ever dare to look down the back of Patricia\x{2019}s blouse, I wonder?) At least if I ever suffer amnesia they will know what name to call me. The owners of unclaimed property have their names written down on another list which is read out in assembly on the last Friday of every month by Miss Whittaker, the headmistress, and the penalty for offending criminals is that they must stand throughout assembly while the rest of us sit. This public humiliation does little to deter people and the lost property cupboard remains full to overflowing with abandoned things. Sometimes it is so full that when we unlock it everything falls out on our heads and we are driven to restoring property to people secretly just to get rid of the damn stuff. Perhaps soon we shall have to arrange clandestine <<midnight|13>> openings of the cupboard and hope that hitherto reluctant children will be attracted by the cloak-and-dagger nature of the operation.",

            "Eventually emotions were quieted and children dispersed and Monsieur Armand himself made ready to remount his creak-creaking chariot. \x{2018}I feel,\x{2019} he said, tapping his left breast, \x{2018}I feel in my \x{2019}art, dear lady, your un\x{2019}appiness, your grief.

His ancient pony, trapped between the shafts of the equally ancient cart, arched its neck and snorted and, under cover of his transport\x{2019}s restlessness, Monsieur Armand bent down so that his thin lips were only an inch from my great-grandmother\x{2019}s ear and his whiskers tickled her cheek. What passed between them in this intimate moment? An invitation to disaster, loss, hair-tearing grief and downright ruination which my silly great-grandmother misread completely as an opportunity for her true nature \x{2013} so stifled and suffocated by drudgery and penury \x{2013} to escape and fly free. \x{2018}I wait,\x{2019} said Monsieur Armand, \x{2018}at the end of the track \x{2013} at <<midnight|13>>.

She answers wearily and I can almost see her blue rollers and pink hair-net. \x{2018}It\x{2019}s just Ruby!\x{2019} I shout down the phone at her. \x{2018}Guess what \x{2013} I\x{2019}m getting married!\x{2019} The shocked silence that greets this news goes on for ever \x{2013} at least until my money runs out. \x{2018}I\x{2019}ve found someone who wants me at last!\x{2019} I yell into the phone, but it has already gone beepbeepbeepbeepbeep and my words fall into nothing. \x{2018}Congratulations, hen,\x{2019} a man says as I come out of the phone-box. \x{2018}I hope you\x{2019}ll be very happy,\x{2019} and I must make do with his whisky-laced epithalamium for the only person we invite to our hasty register-office wedding is Marjorie Morrison and we have to borrow a witness from the previous wedding. Bunty refuses to speak to me for over a year and I am horrified to find that I miss her.And so I married Gian-Carlo Benedetti and finally found the Forth Rail Bridge. I crossed the Forth and then the Tay and found out what would have happened if I had stayed on the train (Haymarket, Inverkeithing, Kirkcaldy, Markinch, Ladybank, Cupar, Leuchars, Dundee) and in doing so condemned myself to some truly wretched years in which Gian-Carlo Benedetti\x{2019}s charms melt into the air along with his fine cheekbones and radiant smile. Not only that, but he grows unattractively plump on all the chip-fat and acquires such a taste for grappa that sometimes I think about throwing a match at him to see if he\x{2019}ll ignite like a well-doused Christmas pudding.",

In her hand was a small Gladstone. What was his mother doing with bag and bonnet at <<three in the morning|9a>>? Lawrence tried to follow to find out, but he was in his bare feet and the track was laid with sharp stones. His mother, fully shod in her little black boots, moved swiftly, lightly, and Lawrence had the curious impression that she was floating a few inches above the track. She disappeared over the brow of a hill and by the time Lawrence had stumbled to the top all he could see was the black cart, blacker than the night itself, trundling off with his mother\x{2019}s bonneted silhouette sitting aloft next to the Frenchman.",

Sister Blake\x{2019}s tone of voice \x{2013} solemn and supportive \x{2013} combined with the way we\x{2019}ve been side-lined off the ward \x{2013} suggests that Bunty is not expected to last much longer, and when the sister\x{2019}s gone we debate whether we should go home tonight or not. I draw the curtains at the window, curtains that have big colourful shapes on them as if we were in the children\x{2019}s ward. Bunty\x{2019}s room overlooks the Scarborough line and a short diesel train toots as it passes below. Patricia and I decide to go and ask Sister Blake if she knows the details of Bunty\x{2019}s terminal timetable. It\x{2019}s <<after nine o\x{2019}clock|6>> and the last straggling visitors have gone and the lights have been dimmed. We find Sister Blake and a student nurse in one of the six-berth wards soothing a tiny old man who is trying to throw himself out of bed with remarkable determination. Sister Blake and the student struggle with the cot-sides while the old man, no bigger than a schoolboy, keeps up a stream of ferocious invective against them.\x{2018}I think she\x{2019}s busy,\x{2019} Patricia says doubtfully. \x{2018}Let\x{2019}s go for a walk,\x{2019} and we wander off around the maze of new staircases and corridors, arm in arm like the walking wounded whom we see perambulating in their dressing-gowns during the daytime. They are all safely tucked up now, as are the little electric trains that buzz along with the meal-trucks in tow. We walk along corridors with plate-glass walls beyond which we can see ducks roosting around a concrete pond, lit by small floodlights. The slight hum of a motor vibrates softly in the air as if the hospital was a huge ship ploughing confidently through the darkness. We sit for a while in reception in the big vinyl chairs and watch the revolving doors before going outside and taking a turn around the empty visitors\x{2019} car-park, laid out like a huge hop-scotch. We\x{2019}re only a few hundred yards from where Bunty was born. And now she\x{2019}s dying.
