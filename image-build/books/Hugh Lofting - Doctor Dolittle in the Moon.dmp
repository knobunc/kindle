            '[~ 12:00] Doctor Dolittle in the Moon - Hugh Lofting.epub (index_split_017.html) - about midday',
            'It was <<about midday|13>> and we had halted for lunch on our excursion in search of the Whispering Vines we had been told of. We were not more than two or three hours\' walk from our old base camp. But that, with the speed so easy in moon marching, means a much greater distance than it does on the Earth. From this camp where the Doctor had set up his apparatus for his special botanical studies, we had now for nearly a week been making daily expeditions in search of the various new species that the Vanity Lilies had described for us. But we always got back before nightfall. Well, this <<noon|13>> the Doctor was leaning back, munching a large piece of yellow yam--a vegetable we got from the edges of the jungle and which we had found so nourishing we had made it almost our chief article of diet.',

            'It was <<nearly midday|13>> again when we finally got stirring. We were in need of water for breakfast. Getting the water had always been Chee-Chee\'s job. This morning, however, the Doctor wanted him to hunt up a further supply of medicinal plants for his surgical work. I volunteered therefore to act as water-carrier.',

            'It was not hard work. I went on show from <<ten to twelve in the morning|10>>, from <<three to five in the afternoon|10>>, and from <<eight to ten at night|10>>. A tailor was produced who fitted my enormous frame with a decent-looking suit. A barber was summoned to cut my hair. During my show hours I signed my autograph to pictures of myself which the circus proprietor had printed in great numbers. They were sold at threepence apiece. Twice a day I told the gaping crowds of holiday folk the story of my travels. But I never spoke of the Moon. I called it just a "foreign land"--which indeed was true enough.',
