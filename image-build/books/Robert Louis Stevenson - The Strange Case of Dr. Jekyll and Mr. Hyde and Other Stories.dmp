            "Though Jekyll and Hyde is narrated in the third person, the events recounted in the story are consistently presented from the point of view of the lawyer Mr. Utterson. As the word \x{201c}utter\x{201d} suggests, he will be the only character left to bear witness at the story\x{2019}s conclusion, though he too is silenced by the end of the book. Utterson is a neutral or repressed character who seems to exist in symbiosis with the disreputable individuals who visit his practice; Stevenson describes him as \x{201c}the last reputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men\x{201d} (p. 5). Utterson is a good man, in other words, but one whose virtue is so passive as to be almost negative: \x{201c}He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone, to mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years\x{201d} (p. 5). In this Calvinistic practice of self-denial, Utterson resembles the respectable Puritans of Stevenson\x{2019}s Edinburgh upbringing; he may even represent the system of repression that gives rise to a Mr. Hyde. While Utterson knows Dr. Jekyll well at the story\x{2019}s outset, he is initially introduced to Hyde only by proxy, in the account of his friend and cousin Richard Enfield. As they pass \x{201c}a certain sinister block of building\x{201d} in a busy part of Soho, Enfield tells Utterson a curious story about the stained and blistered door by which they have paused. One night at <<three in the morning|9a>>, Enfield had seen \x{201c} \x{2018}a little man who was stumping along eastward . . . and a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street.\x{2019} \x{201d}",

            "What they find is a sight at once ordinary and uncanny. Amid a quiet domestic scene, the fire glowing on the hearth and the kettle whistling\x{2014}it seems an inadvertently comical detail that the villainous Hyde should drink such an ordinary beverage as tea\x{2014}they find the body of Hyde, dressed in the much-too-large clothes of Dr. Jekyll and dead by self administered cyanide. When they search for the body of Jekyll, however, the two men have no luck: \x{201c}Nowhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll, dead or alive.\x{201d} All they find are the signs of a chemical experiment and one or two other disturbing artifacts: \x{201c}There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated, in his own hand, with startling blasphemies\x{201d} (p. 50) . They also find yet another envelope for Utterson: a will, written in terms similar to the last, though \x{201c}in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement, read the name of Gabriel John Utterson\x{201d} (p. 50) . It is accompanied by a note from Jekyll dated that day, which gives the two men some hope that the doctor may still be alive, and a third enclosure, a substantial packet of papers that Utterson is instructed to read after he opens Lanyon\x{2019}s sealed narrative. In the final scene of the story\x{2019}s third-person narration, Utterson tells the butler that he will go home and read the papers, then return at <<midnight|13>>, at which point they will notify the police. Yet the reader never sees Utterson again: The story\x{2019}s remaining pages are entirely occupied by the first-person narratives of Lanyon and Jekyll, and there is no positive evidence that Utterson ever goes to the police at all. What, after all, could he tell them?",

            "Lanyon\x{2019}s narrative, given first of the two, is akin to an affidavit and follows the form of written or verbal testimony, complete with dates and documents. It begins with the night when Lanyon receives from Jekyll a registered letter containing a most peculiar request: to break into his private cabinet, with the assistance of a locksmith, and retrieve a locked drawer and its contents, then to admit at <<midnight|13>> the man Jekyll will send to retrieve it. Lanyon follows his friend\x{2019}s instructions. Though he fears that Jekyll has become insane, there is nothing terrifying in the drawer, just some wrapped powders, clearly \x{201c}of Jekyll\x{2019}s private manufacture\x{201d} and containing \x{201c}a simple crystalline salt of a white colour\x{201d}; a phial \x{201c}half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly pungent to the sense of smell and seemed to ... contain phosphorus and some volatile ether\x{201d}; and a \x{201c}version book,\x{201d} a sketchy record of scientific experiments with a list of dates (pp. 55-56). Increasingly sure that Jekyll must be suffering from \x{201c}cerebral disease,\x{201d} Lanyon loads an old revolver in case he needs to defend himself, then dismisses his servants for the night. At <<midnight|13>>, Lanyon finds outside his door a \x{201c}small man crouching against the pillars of the portico\x{201d} and avoiding the notice of an approaching policeman (p. 56) . Once they are inside the consulting room\x{2014}chosen by Lanyon as the site of their conversation because it will let him protect himself psychologically against these extraordinary circumstances with \x{201c}as fair an imitation of [his] ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of [his] preoccupations, and the horror [he] had of [his] visitor, would suffer [him] to muster\x{201d} (p. 58)\x{2014}Lanyon is able to see the visitor clearly:",

            "\x{201c}Well, it was this way,\x{201d} returned Mr. Enfield: \x{201c}I was coming home from some place at the end of the world, <<about three o\x{2018}clock|6>> of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street, and all the folks asleep-street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church\x{2014}till at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child\x{2019}s body and left her screaming on the ground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn\x{2019}t like a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a view halloa, took to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the girl\x{2019}s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been sent, put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there you might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So had the child\x{2019}s family, which was only natural. But the doctor\x{2019}s case was what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white with desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next best. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this, as should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we could, for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of black, sneering coolness\x{2014}fright\x{2014}ened too, I could see that\x{2014}but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. \x{2018}If you choose to make capital out of this accident,\x{2019} said he, \x{2018}I am naturally helpless. No gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,\x{2019} says he. \x{2018}Name your figure.\x{2019} Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child\x{2019}s family; he would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?\x{2014}whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on Coutts\x{2018}s, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can\x{2019}t mention, though it\x{2019}s one of the points of my story, but it was a name at least very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that, if it was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar door at <<four in the morning|9a>> and come out with another man\x{2019}s cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. \x{2018}Set your mind at rest,\x{2019} says he, \x{2018}I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.\x{2019} So we all set off, the doctor, and the child\x{2019}s father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine.",

            "That evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of <<twelve|20>>, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On this night, however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business room. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll\x{2019}s Will, and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson, though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his \x{201c}friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\x{201d} but that in case of Dr. Jekyll\x{2019}s \x{201c}disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months,\x{201d} the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry Jekyll\x{2019}s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation, beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor\x{2019}s household. This document had long been the lawyer\x{2019}s eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.",

            "<<Six o\x{2018}clock|6>> struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to Mr. Utterson\x{2019}s dwelling, and still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield\x{2019}s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor\x{2019}s; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he would see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming. And still the figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer\x{2019}s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He might see a reason for his friend\x{2019}s strange preference or bondage (call it which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.",

By <<ten o\x{2018}clock|6>>, when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd, light footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.",

The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful reinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer\x{2019}s eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare.

            "\x{201c}10th December, 18\x{2014}.\x{201c}Dear Lanyon,\x{2014}You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may have differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at least on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day when, if you had said to me, \x{2018}Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason, depend upon you,\x{2019} I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you. Lanyon, my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail me to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I am going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for yourself.\x{201c}I want you to postpone all other engagements for to night\x{2014}ay, even if you were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless your carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in your hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my butler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a locksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced: and you are to go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand, breaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, with all its contents as they stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same thing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of mind, I have a morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may know the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a paper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish Square exactly as it stands.\x{201c}That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should be back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, <<long before midnight|13>>; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in the fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor foreseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be preferred for what will then remain to do. At <<midnight|13>>, then, I have to ask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand into the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place in his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my cabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude completely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation, you will have understood that these arrangements are of capital importance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they must appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the shipwreck of my reason.\x{201c}Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart sinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility. Think of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a blackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware that, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away like a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon, and save\x{201c}Your friend, 
\x{201d} H. J.\x{201c}P.S.\x{2014}I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my soul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter not come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear Lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger at <<midnight|13>>. It may then already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\x{201d}Upon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less I was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll\x{2019}s house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman\x{2019}s surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll\x{2019}s private cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hours\x{2019} work, the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square.",

            "Thereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of which I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury; and the smile withered from his face\x{2014}happily for him\x{2014}yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly dragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde in danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the creature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth in the comer of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the streets of the city. He, I say\x{2014}I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at last, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest. He walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking through the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that still divided him from <<midnight|13>>. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I think, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.",

Death was instantaneous. Mr. Malthus, accompanied by a friend, was engaged in looking for a cab at the time of the unfortunate occurrence.

He lay partly on his back, partly on his side, and his right forearm concealed his face from recognition. Suddenly, while the American was still bending over him, the sleeper removed his arm and opened his eyes, and Silas found himself once more face to face with the loiterer of Box Court.',

All over the countryside, and from every degree of distance, the farm dogs accompanied their passage with tragic ululations; and it grew and grew upon his mind that some unnatural miracle had been accomplished, that some nameless change had befallen the dead body, and that it was in fear of their unholy burden that the dogs were howling.",

            "With the mushrooming popularity of film in the early twentieth century, more than a dozen adaptations of Stevenson\x{2019}s classic were quickly produced. But it wasn\x{2019}t until <<1920|9c:0>>, with Paramount\x{2019}s spectacular movie depiction of Dr. , jekyll and Mr. Hyde, directed by John Stuart Robertson, that the dominance of an actor of Mansfield\x{2019}s caliber was captured on film. With the celebrated John Barrymore cast in the duplicitous lead, Robertson\x{2019}s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is considered the definitive silent version of Stevenson\x{2019}s thriller. Atmospheric and creepy, Robertson\x{2019}s film is laden with careful detail; one distinctive feature is the look of Mr. Hyde\x{2014}long, sinewy fingers and an elongated, pointed head\x{2014}reminiscent of the vampire in the classic Nosferatu. But Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is ultimately a vehicle for Barrymore\x{2019}s talents. The props and special effects pale in comparison with Barrymore\x{2019}s \x{201c}flawless performance,\x{201d} as the New York Times described it; specifically, by distorting and disfiguring his face by expression alone, Barrymore achieves the effect of transforming his very nature from respectable to despicable. Indeed, his onscreen metamorphosis has served as the inspiration for many a subsequent movie transformation, whether a man changing into a werewolf or Dracula\x{2019}s teeth growing long and feral at the prospect of new blood. Resplendent with visual detail and Barrymore\x{2019}s tour de-force acting, Robertson\x{2019}s Dr. jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a landmark of the silent-film era.",
