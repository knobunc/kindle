It was <<about three|9:0>> bitter lines. Somehow she seemed to blame me for my mother\'s death. Whether it was my fault because I was in the Armed Services and should have therefore prevented the raid, or whether she felt that my mother had made a trip to Buenos Aires because I wasn\'t home where I should have been, was not quite clear; she managed to imply both in the same sentence.',

The redisposition took no more than ten minutes once I had detailed the plan and given out bearings to the sergeants; nobody had to move very far. I warned everybody to keep eyes open for a company of engineers. As soon as each section reported its listening posts in operation I clicked to the wide circuit: "Odd numbers!
