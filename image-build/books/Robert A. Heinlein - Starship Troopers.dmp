I didn\'t know what was going on, of course; just stuck close behind Dutch, trying to shoot or flame anything that moved, dropping a grenade down a hole when ever I saw one. Presently I got so that I could kill a Bug without wasting ammo or juice, although I did not learn to distinguish between those that were harmless and those that were not. Only <<about one|9w>> in fifty is a warrior but he makes up for the other forty-nine. Their personal weapons aren\'t as heavy as ours but they are lethal just the same - they\'ve got a beam that will penetrate armor and slice flesh like cutting a hard-boiled egg, and they co operate even better than we do . . . because the brain that is doing the heavy thinking for a "squad" isn\'t where you can reach it; it\'s down one of the holes.',

It was <<about three|9w>> bitter lines. Somehow she seemed to blame me for my mother\'s death. Whether it was my fault because I was in the Armed Services and should have therefore prevented the raid, or whether she felt that my mother had made a trip to Buenos Aires because I wasn\'t home where I should have been, was not quite clear; she managed to imply both in the same sentence.',

The redisposition took no more than ten minutes once I had detailed the plan and given out bearings to the sergeants; nobody had to move very far.
