They had Regina halfway there when she revived and begged them not to fry her alive, to let her return to her line. They released her, and when she crept back into the ranks, there was her bird-boned, speechless daughter still, frozen to the pile of stone.",

They were no longer turning inward toward the camp. Their eyes, like Oskar\x{2019}s, were focused\x{2014}but far more sharply\x{2014}on the Russians. According to Hassebroeck\x{2019}s earlier telegram, they should have been busy in the rich green woods.
