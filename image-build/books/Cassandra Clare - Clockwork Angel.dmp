            "Clockwork Angel1T HE D ARK H OUSEBeyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade \x{2014}William Ernest Henley, \x{201c}Invictus\x{201d}\x{201c}The Sisters would like to see you in their chambers, Miss Gray.\x{201d}Tessa set the book she had been reading down on the bedside table, and turned to see Miranda standing in the doorway of her small room\x{2014}just as she did at this time every day, delivering the same message she delivered every day. In a moment Tessa would ask her to wait in the corridor, and Miranda would leave the room. Ten minutes later she\x{2019}d return and say the same thing again. If Tessa didn\x{2019}t come obediently after a few of these attempts, Miranda would seize her and drag her, kicking and screaming, down the stairs to the hot, stinking room where the Dark Sisters waited.It had happened every day of the first week that Tessa had been in the Dark House, as she had come to call the place they kept her prisoner, until eventually Tessa had realized that the screaming and kicking didn\x{2019}t do much good and simply wasted her energy. Energy that was probably better saved for other things.\x{201c}One moment, Miranda,\x{201d} Tessa said. The maid bobbed an awkward curtsy and went out of the room, shutting the door behind her.Tessa rose to her feet, glancing around the small room that had been her prison cell for six weeks. It was small, with flowered wallpaper, and sparsely furnished\x{2014}a plain deal table with a white lace cloth over it where she ate her meals; the narrow brass bed where she slept; the cracked washstand and porcelain jug for her ablutions; the windowsill where she stacked her books, and the small chair where she sat each night and wrote letters to her brother\x{2014}letters she knew she could never send, letters she kept hidden under her mattress where the Dark Sisters would not find them. It was her way of keeping a diary and of assuring herself, somehow, that she would see Nate again someday and be able to give them to him.She crossed the room to the mirror that hung against the far wall, and smoothed down her hair. The Dark Sisters, as they in fact seemed to wish to be called, preferred her not to look messy, although they didn\x{2019}t appear to mind her appearance one way or the other past that\x{2014}which was fortunate, because her reflection made her wince. There was the pale oval of her face dominated by hollow gray eyes\x{2014}a shadowed face without color in its cheeks or hope in its expression. She wore the unflattering black schoolmarmish dress that the Sisters had given her once she\x{2019}d arrived; her trunk had never followed her, despite their promises, and this was now the only piece of clothing she owned. She looked away quickly.She hadn\x{2019}t always flinched from her reflection. Nate, with his fair good looks, was the one in the family generally agreed to have inherited her mother\x{2019}s beauty, but Tessa had always been perfectly content with her own smooth brown hair and steady gray eyes. Jane Eyre had had brown hair, and plenty of other heroines besides. And it wasn\x{2019}t so bad being tall, either\x{2014}taller than most of the boys her own age, it was true, but Aunt Harriet had always said that as long as a tall woman carried herself well, she would forever look regal.She didn\x{2019}t look regal now, though. She looked pinched and bedraggled and altogether like a frightened scarecrow. She wondered if Nate would even recognize her if he saw her today.At that thought her heart seemed to shrink inside her chest. Nate. He was the one she was doing all this for, but sometimes she missed him so much it felt like she\x{2019}d swallowed broken glass. Without him, she was completely alone in the world. There was no one at all for her. No one in the world who cared whether she lived or died. Sometimes the horror of that thought threatened to overwhelm her and plunge her down into a bottomless darkness from which there would be no return. If no one in the entire world cared about you, did you really exist at all?The click of the lock cut her thoughts off abruptly. The door opened; Miranda stood on the threshold.\x{201c}It is time to come with me now,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}Mrs. Black and Mrs. Dark are waiting.\x{201d}Tessa looked at her in distaste. She couldn\x{2019}t guess how old Miranda was. <<Nineteen|9k:0>>? <<Twenty-five|9k:0>>? There was something ageless about her smooth round face. Her hair was the color of ditch water, pulled back harshly behind her ears. Exactly like the Dark Sisters\x{2019} coachman, she had eyes that protruded like a frog\x{2019}s and made her look like she was permanently surprised. Tessa thought they must be related.As they went downstairs together, Miranda marching along with her graceless, clipped gait, Tessa raised her hand to touch the chain around her throat where the clockwork angel hung. It was habit\x{2014}something she did each time she was forced to see the Dark Sisters. Somehow the feel of the pendant around her neck reassured her. She kept hold of it as they passed landing after landing. There were several levels of corridors to the Dark House, though Tessa had seen nothing of it but the Dark Sisters\x{2019} chambers, the halls and stairs, and her own room. Finally they reached the shadowed cellar. It was dank down here, the walls clammy with unpleasant moisture, though apparently the Sisters didn\x{2019}t mind. Their office was ahead, through a set of wide double doors. A narrow corridor led away in the other direction, vanishing into darkness; Tessa had no idea what lay down that hallway, but something about the thickness of the shadows made her glad she had never found out.The doors to the Sisters\x{2019} office were open. Miranda didn\x{2019}t hesitate, but clomped inside, Tessa following after her with great reluctance. She hated this room more than any other place on earth.To begin with, it was always hot and wet inside, like a swamp, even when the skies outside were gray and rainy. The walls seemed to seep moisture, and the upholstery on the seats and sofas was always blooming with mold. It smelled strange as well, like the banks of the Hudson on a hot day: water and garbage and silt.The Sisters were already there, as they always were, seated behind their enormous raised desk. They were their usual colorful selves, Mrs. Black in a dress of vibrant salmon pink and Mrs. Dark in a gown of peacock blue. Above the brilliantly colored satins, their faces were like deflated gray balloons. They both wore gloves despite how hot the room was.\x{201c}Leave us now, Miranda,\x{201d} said Mrs. Black, who was spinning the heavy brass globe they kept on the desk with one plump, white-gloved finger. Tessa had many times tried to get a better look at the globe\x{2014}something about the way the continents were laid out had never looked quite right to her, especially the space in the center of Europe\x{2014}but the sisters always kept her away from it. \x{201c}And shut the door behind you.\x{201d}Expressionless, Miranda did as asked. Tessa tried not to wince as the door shut behind her, closing off what little breeze there was in this airless place.Mrs. Dark tilted her head to the side. \x{201c}Come here, Theresa.\x{201d} Of the two women, she was the more kind\x{2014}more likely to wheedle and persuade than her sister, who liked to convince with slaps and hissed threats. \x{201c}And take this.\x{201d}She held something out: a dilapidated bit of pink fabric tied in a bow, the sort that might be used as a girl\x{2019}s hair ribbon.She was used to being handed things by the Dark Sisters now. Things that had once belonged to people: tie pins and watches, mourning jewelry, and children\x{2019}s toys. Once the laces of a boot; once a single earring, stained with blood.\x{201c}Take this,\x{201d} said Mrs. Dark again, a hint of impatience in her voice. \x{201c}And Change.\x{201d}Tessa took the bow. It lay in her hand, as light as a moth\x{2019}s wing, and the Dark Sisters stared impassively at her. She remembered books she had read, novels in which characters were on trial, standing quaking in the dock at the Old Bailey and praying for a verdict of not guilty. She often felt she was on trial herself in this room, without knowing of what crime she stood accused.She turned the bow over in her hand, remembering the first time the Dark Sisters had handed an object to her\x{2014}a woman\x{2019}s glove, with pearl buttons at the wrist. They had shouted at her to Change, had slapped her and shaken her as she\x{2019}d told them over and over again with rising hysteria that she had no idea what they were talking about, no idea what they were asking her to do.She hadn\x{2019}t cried, even though she\x{2019}d wanted to. Tessa hated to cry, especially in front of people she didn\x{2019}t trust. And of the only two people in the world she trusted, one was dead and the other imprisoned. They had told her that, the Dark Sisters, had told her that they had Nate, and if she didn\x{2019}t do what they said, he would die. They\x{2019}d showed her his ring, the one that had been her father\x{2019}s\x{2014}stained with blood now\x{2014}to prove it. They hadn\x{2019}t let her hold it or touch it, had snatched it back as she\x{2019}d reached for it, but she\x{2019}d recognized it. It was Nate\x{2019}s.After that she had done everything they\x{2019}d asked. Had drunk the potions they\x{2019}d given her, done the hours of agonizing exercises, forced herself to think the way they wanted her to. They\x{2019}d told her to imagine herself as clay, being shaped and molded on the potter\x{2019}s wheel, her form amorphous and changeable. They\x{2019}d told her to reach down into the objects they\x{2019}d given her, to imagine them as living things, and to draw out the spirit that animated them.It had taken weeks, and the first time she had Changed, it had been so blindingly painful that she\x{2019}d vomited and passed out. When she\x{2019}d woken, she\x{2019}d been lying on one of the moldering chaises in the Dark Sisters\x{2019} rooms, a damp towel being sponged across her face. Mrs. Black had been leaning down over her, her breath as bitter as vinegar, her eyes alight. \x{201c}You did well today, Theresa,\x{201d} she had said. \x{201c}Very well.\x{201d}That evening when Tessa had gone up to her room, there had been gifts for her, two new books on her bedside table. Somehow the Dark Sisters had realized that reading and novels were Tessa\x{2019}s passion. There was a copy of Great Expectations and\x{2014}of all things\x{2014}Little Women. Tessa had hugged the books to herself and, alone and unwatched in her room, had let herself cry.It had grown easier since then, the Changing. Tessa still didn\x{2019}t understand what happened inside her to make it possible, but she had memorized the series of steps the Dark Sisters had taught her, the way a blind person might memorize the number of paces it takes to walk from their bed to the door of their room. She didn\x{2019}t know what was around her in the strange dark place they asked her to journey to, but she knew the pathway through it.She drew on those memories now, tightening her grip on the ragged bit of pink fabric she held. She opened her mind and let the darkness come down, let the connection that bound her to the hair ribbon and the spirit inside it\x{2014}the ghostly echo of the person who had once owned it\x{2014}unravel like a golden thread leading through the shadows. The room she was in, the oppressive heat, the noisy breathing of the Dark Sisters, all of it fell away as she followed the thread, as the light grew more intense around her and she wrapped herself in it as if she were wrapping herself in a blanket.Her skin began to tingle and to sting with thousands of tiny shocks. This had been the worst part, once\x{2014}the part that had convinced her she was dying. Now she was used to it, and bore it stoically as she shuddered all over, from her scalp to her toes. The clockwork angel around her throat seemed to tick faster, as if in rhythm with her speeding heart. The pressure inside her skin built\x{2014}Tessa gasped\x{2014}and her eyes, which had been closed, flew open as the sensation built to a crescendo\x{2014}and then vanished.It was over.Tessa blinked dizzily. The first moment after a Change was always like blinking water out of your eyes after submerging yourself in a bath. She looked down at herself. Her new body was slight, almost frail, and the fabric of her dress hung loose, pooling on the floor at her feet. Her hands, clasped in front of her, were pale and thin, with chapped tips and bitten nails. Unfamiliar, alien hands.\x{201c}What is your name?\x{201d} Mrs. Black demanded. She had risen to her feet and was looking down at Tessa with her pale eyes burning. She looked almost hungry.Tessa didn\x{2019}t have to answer. The girl whose skin she wore answered for her, speaking through her the way spirits were said to speak through their mediums\x{2014}but Tessa hated to think about it that way; the Change was so much more intimate, so much more frightening, than that. \x{201c}Emma,\x{201d} the voice that came from Tessa said. \x{201c}Miss Emma Bayliss, ma\x{2019}am.\x{201d}\x{201c}And who are you, Emma Bayliss?\x{201d}The voice replied, words tumbling out of Tessa\x{2019}s mouth, bringing strong images with them. Born in Cheapside, Emma had been one of six children. Her father was dead, and her mother sold peppermint water from a cart in the East End. Emma had learned to sew to bring in money when she was still a small child. Nights, she spent sitting at the little table in her kitchen, sewing seams by the light of a tallow candle. Sometimes, when the candle burned down and there was no money for another, she would go out into the streets and sit below one of the municipal gas lamps, using its light to sew by\x{2026} .\x{201c}Is that what you were doing out on the street the night you died, Emma Bayliss?\x{201d} asked Mrs. Dark. She was smiling thinly now, running her tongue over her lower lip, as if she could sense what the answer would be.Tessa saw narrow, shadowy streets, wrapped in thick fog, a silver needle working by faint yellow gaslight. A step, muffled in the fog. Hands that reached out of the shadows and took hold of her shoulders, hands that dragged her, screaming, into the darkness. The needle and thread falling from her hands, the bows ripped from her hair as she struggled. A harsh voice shouting something angry. And then the silver blade of a knife flashing down through the dark, slicing into her skin, drawing out the blood. Pain that was like fire, and terror like nothing else she\x{2019}d ever known. She kicked out at the man holding her, succeeding in knocking the dagger from his hand; she caught the blade and ran, stumbling as she weakened, the blood draining out of her fast, so fast. She crumpled in an alley, hearing the hissing scream of something behind her. She knew it was following her, and she was hoping to die before it reached her\x{2014}The Change shattered like glass. With a cry Tessa fell to her knees, the torn little bow falling from her hand. It was her hand again\x{2014}Emma had gone, like a cast-off skin. Tessa was once more alone inside her own mind.Mrs. Black\x{2019}s voice came from far away. \x{201c}Theresa? Where is Emma?\x{201d}\x{201c}She\x{2019}s dead,\x{201d} Tessa whispered. \x{201c}She died in an alley\x{2014}bled to death.\x{201d}\x{201c}Good.\x{201d} Mrs. Dark exhaled, a sound of satisfaction. \x{201c}Well done, Theresa. That was very good.\x{201d}Tessa said nothing. The front of her dress was splotched with blood, but there was no pain. She knew it was not her blood; it wasn\x{2019}t the first time this had happened. She closed her eyes, spinning in the darkness, willing herself not to faint.\x{201c}We should have had her do this before,\x{201d} said Mrs. Black. \x{201c}The matter of the Bayliss girl has been bothering me.\x{201d}Mrs. Dark\x{2019}s reply was curt. \x{201c}I wasn\x{2019}t sure she was up to it. You remember what happened with the Adams woman.\x{201d}Tessa knew immediately what they were talking about. Weeks ago she had Changed into a woman who had died of a gunshot wound to the heart; blood had poured down her dress and she had Changed back immediately, screaming in hysterical terror until the Sisters had made her see that she herself was unharmed.\x{201c}She\x{2019}s advanced wonderfully since then, don\x{2019}t you think, Sister?\x{201d} Mrs. Black said. \x{201c}Given what we had to work with in the beginning\x{2014}she didn\x{2019}t even know what she was.\x{201d}\x{201c}Indeed, she was absolutely unformed clay,\x{201d} Mrs. Dark agreed. \x{201c}We have truly worked a miracle here. I can\x{2019}t see how the Magister could fail to be pleased.\x{201d}Mrs. Black gave a little gasp. \x{201c}Does that mean\x{2014}Do you think it\x{2019}s time?\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh, absolutely, my dear sister. She\x{2019}s as ready as she\x{2019}ll ever be. It\x{2019}s time for our Theresa to meet her master.\x{201d} There was a gloating note in Mrs. Dark\x{2019}s voice, a sound so unpleasant that it cut through Tessa\x{2019}s blinding dizziness. What were they talking about? Who was the Magister? She watched through lowered eyelashes as Mrs. Dark jerked the silk bellpull that would summon Miranda to come and take Tessa back to her room. It appeared that the lesson was over for today.\x{201c}Perhaps tomorrow,\x{201d} Mrs. Black said, \x{201c}or even tonight. If we told the Magister she was ready, I cannot imagine he would not hurry here without delay.\x{201d}Mrs. Dark, stepping out from behind the desk, chuckled. \x{201c}I understand that you\x{2019}re eager to be paid for all our work, dear sister. But Theresa must not be simply ready. She must be \x{2026} presentable as well as able. Don\x{2019}t you agree?\x{201d}Mrs. Black, following her sister, muttered a response that was cut short as the door opened and Miranda came in. She wore the same dull look as ever. The sight of Tessa crouched and bloody on the floor seemed to occasion no surprise in her. Then again, Tessa thought, she had probably seen far worse in this room.\x{201c}Take the girl back up to her room, Miranda.\x{201d} The eagerness was gone from Mrs. Black\x{2019}s voice, and she was all brusqueness again. \x{201c}Get the things\x{2014}you know, the ones we showed you\x{2014}and get her dressed and ready.\x{201d}\x{201c}The things \x{2026} you showed me?\x{201d} Miranda sounded blank.Mrs. Dark and Mrs. Black exchanged a disgusted look, and approached Miranda, blocking Tessa\x{2019}s view of the girl. Tessa heard them whispering to her, and caught a few words\x{2014}\x{201c}dresses\x{201d} and \x{201c}wardrobe room\x{201d} and \x{201c}do what you can to make her look pretty,\x{201d} and then finally, Tessa heard the rather cruel, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not sure Miranda is clever enough to obey vague instructions of that sort, sister.\x{201d}Make her look pretty. But what did they care whether she looked pretty or not, when they could force her to look any way they wanted? What did it matter what her true appearance was? And why would the Magister care? Though, it was very clear from the Sisters\x{2019} behavior that they believed he would.Mrs. Black swept from the room, her sister following behind her, as she always did. At the door Mrs. Dark paused, and looked back at Tessa. \x{201c}Do remember, Theresa,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}that this day\x{2014}this very night\x{2014}is what all of our preparation has been for.\x{201d} She took hold of her skirts in both bony hands. \x{201c}Do not fail us.\x{201d}She let the door bang shut behind her. Tessa flinched at the noise, but Miranda, as always, seemed utterly unaffected. In all the time that she had passed in the Dark House, Tessa had never been able to startle the other girl, or surprise an unguarded expression out of her.\x{201c}Come,\x{201d} Miranda said. \x{201c}We must go upstairs now.\x{201d}Tessa rose to her feet, slowly. Her mind was whirling. Her life in the Dark House had been horrible, but she had\x{2014}she realized now\x{2014}grown almost used to it. She had known what to expect each day. She had known the Dark Sisters were preparing her for something, but she had not known what that something was. She had believed\x{2014}naively, perhaps\x{2014}that they wouldn\x{2019}t kill her. Why waste all this training on her if she was only going to die?But something in Mrs. Dark\x{2019}s gloating tone gave her pause. Something had changed. They had achieved what they wanted with her. They were going to be \x{201c}paid.\x{201d} But who was going to do the paying?\x{201c}Come,\x{201d} Miranda said again. \x{201c}We must get you ready for the Magister.\x{201d}\x{201c}Miranda,\x{201d} Tessa said. She spoke softly, the way she might have spoken to a nervous cat. Miranda had never answered a question of Tessa\x{2019}s before, but that didn\x{2019}t mean it wasn\x{2019}t worth trying. \x{201c}Who is the Magister?\x{201d}There was a long silence. Miranda stared straight ahead, her doughy face impassive. Then, to Tessa\x{2019}s surprise, she spoke. \x{201c}The Magister is a very great man,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}It will be an honor for you when you are married to him.\x{201d}\x{201c}Married?\x{201d} Tessa echoed. The shock was so intense that she could suddenly see the whole room more clearly\x{2014}Miranda, the blood-splattered rug on the floor, the heavy brass globe on the desk, still tilted in the position Mrs. Black had left it in. \x{201c}Me? But\x{2014}who is he?\x{201d}\x{201c}He is a very great man,\x{201d} Miranda said again. \x{201c}It will be an honor.\x{201d} She moved toward Tessa. \x{201c}You must come with me now.\x{201d}\x{201c}No.\x{201d} Tessa backed away from the other girl, retreating until the small of her back struck painfully against the desk. She looked around desperately. She could run, but she\x{2019}d never get past Miranda to the door; there were no windows, no doors to other rooms. If she hid behind the desk, Miranda would simply drag her out and haul her to her room. \x{201c}Miranda, please.\x{201d}\x{201c}You must come with me now,\x{201d} Miranda repeated; she had almost reached Tessa. Tessa could see herself reflected in the black pupils of the other girl\x{2019}s eyes, could smell the faint, bitter, almost charred smell that clung to Miranda\x{2019}s clothes and skin. \x{201c}You must \x{2014}\x{201d}With a strength she didn\x{2019}t know she possessed, Tessa seized the base of the brass globe on the desk, lifted it, and swung it with all her might at Miranda\x{2019}s head.It connected with a sickening sound. Miranda reeled back\x{2014}and then straightened. Tessa shrieked and dropped the globe, staring\x{2014}the whole left side of Miranda\x{2019}s face was crushed in, like a paper mask that had been smashed flat on one side. Her cheekbone was flattened, her lip mashed against her teeth. But there was no blood, no blood at all.\x{201c}You must come with me now,\x{201d} Miranda said, in the same flat tone she always used.Tessa gaped.\x{201c}You must come\x{2014}you m-must\x{2014}you\x{2014}you\x{2014}you\x{2014}yyyyyyyyyyyyy\x{2014}\x{201d} Miranda\x{2019}s voice shuddered and broke, degenerating into a stream of gibberish. She moved toward Tessa, then jerked to the side, twitching and stumbling. Tessa turned from the desk and began to back away as the injured girl spun, faster and faster. She reeled across the room like a staggering drunk, still shrieking, and crashed into the far wall\x{2014}which seemed to stun her. She collapsed to the ground and lay still.Tessa raced to the door and out into the corridor beyond, pausing only once, just outside the room, to look back. It seemed, in that brief moment, as if a thread of black smoke were rising from Miranda\x{2019}s prone body, but there was no time to stare. Tessa darted down the hall, leaving the door hanging open behind her.She dashed for the stairs and hurtled up them, nearly tripping over her skirts and banging her knee painfully on one of the steps. She cried out and scrambled on, up to the first landing, where she dashed into the corridor. It stretched out ahead of her, long and curving, disappearing into shadows. As she raced down it, she saw that it was lined with doors. She paused and tried one, but it was locked, and so was the next one, and the next after that.Another set of stairs led down at the end of the hallway. Tessa raced down them and found herself in an entryway. It looked as if it had once been grand\x{2014}the floor was cracked and stained marble, and high windows on either side were shielded with curtains. A little bit of light spilled through the lace, illuminating an enormous front door. Tessa\x{2019}s heart leaped. She dived for the knob, seized it, and flung the door open.There was a narrow cobblestoned street beyond, with rows of terraced houses lining either side. The smell of the city hit Tessa like a blow\x{2014}it had been so long since she\x{2019}d breathed outside air. It was close to dark, the sky the dimming blue of twilight, obscured by smudges of fog. In the distance she could hear voices, the cries of children playing, the clop of horses\x{2019} hooves. But here the street was nearly deserted, save for a man leaning against a nearby gas lamp, reading a newspaper by its light.Tessa dashed down the steps and toward the stranger, catching him by the sleeve. \x{201c}Please, sir\x{2014}if you could help me\x{2014}\x{201d}He turned, and looked down at her.Tessa stifled a scream. His face was as white and waxy as it had been the first time she\x{2019}d seen him, at the dock in Southampton; his bulging eyes still reminded her of Miranda\x{2019}s, and his teeth gleamed like metal when he grinned.It was the Dark Sisters\x{2019} coachman.Tessa turned to run, but it was already too late.Unknown",

The Sisters leaned over her, clacking pairs of long knitting needles and laughing in shrill high-pitched voices. As Tessa watched, their features changed, their eyes sinking into their heads, their hair falling out, and stitches appearing across their lips, sewing them shut. Tessa shrieked voicelessly, but they did not seem to hear.The Sisters vanished entirely then, and Aunt Harriet was standing over Tessa, her face flushed with fever as it had been during the terrible illness that had killed her. She looked at Tessa with great sadness. \x{201c}I tried,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I tried to love you. But it isn\x{2019}t easy to love a child that isn\x{2019}t human in the least\x{2026} .\x{201d}\x{201c}Not human?\x{201d} said an unfamiliar female voice. \x{201c}Well, if she isn\x{2019}t human, Enoch, what is she?\x{201d} The voice sharpened in impatience. \x{201c}What do you mean, you don\x{2019}t know? Everyone\x{2019}s something. This girl can\x{2019}t be nothing at all\x{2026} .\x{201d}Tessa woke with a cry, her eyes flying open, and found herself staring at shadows. Darkness clustered about her thickly. She could barely hear the murmur of voices through her panic, and struggled into a sitting position, kicking away blankets and pillows. Dimly, she recognized that the blanket was thick and heavy, not the thin, braided one that belonged to the Dark House.She was in a bed, just as she had dreamed, in a great stone room, and there was hardly any light. She heard the rasp of her own breath as she turned, and a scream forced its way out of her throat. The face from her nightmare hovered in the darkness before her\x{2014}a great white moon of a face, its head shaved bald, smooth as marble. Where the eyes should have been there were only indentations in the flesh\x{2014}not as if the eyes had been ripped out, but as if they had never grown there at all. The lips were banded with black stitches, the face scrawled with black marks like the ones on Will\x{2019}s skin, though these looked as if they had been cut there with knives.She screamed again and scrabbled backward, half-falling off the bed. She hit the cold stone floor, and the fabric of the white nightdress she was wearing\x{2014}someone must have put it on her while she was unconscious\x{2014}ripped at the hem as she scrambled to her feet.\x{201c}Miss Gray.\x{201d} Someone was calling her name, but in her panic, she knew only that the voice was unfamiliar. The speaker was not the monster who stood staring at her from the bedside, its scarred face impassive; it had not moved when she did, and though it showed no signs of pursuing her, she began to back away, carefully, feeling behind herself for a door. The room was so dim, she could see only that it was roughly oval, the walls and floor all of stone. The ceiling was high enough to be in black shadow, and there were long windows across the opposite wall, the sort of arched windows that might have belonged in a church. Very little light filtered through them; it looked as if the sky outside was dark. \x{201c}Theresa Gray\x{2014}\x{201d}She found the door, the metal handle; turning, she seized on it thankfully, and pulled. Nothing happened. A sob rose up in her throat.\x{201c}Miss Gray!\x{201d} the voice said again, and suddenly the room was flooded with light\x{2014}a sharp, white-silver light that she recognized. \x{201c}Miss Gray, I am sorry. It was not our intention to frighten you.\x{201d} The voice was a woman\x{2019}s: still unfamiliar, but youthful and concerned. \x{201c}Miss Gray, please.\x{201d}Tessa turned slowly and put her back against the door. She could see clearly now. She was in a stone room whose central focus was a large, four-poster bed, its velvet coverlet now rucked and hanging sideways where she had dragged it off the mattress. Tapestry curtains were pulled back, and there was an elegant tapestry rug on the otherwise bare floor. In fact, the room itself was fairly bare. There were no pictures or photographs hanging on the wall, no ornaments cluttering the surfaces of the dark wood furniture. Two chairs stood facing each other near the bed, with a small tea table between them. A Chinese screen in one corner of the room hid what were probably a bathtub and washstand.Beside the bed stood a tall man who wore robes like a monk\x{2019}s, of a long, coarse, parchment-colored material. Red-brown runes circled the cuffs and hem. He carried a silver staff, its head carved in the shape of an angel and runes decorating its length. The hood of his robe was down, leaving bare his scarred, white, blinded face.Beside him stood a very small woman, almost child-size, with thick brown hair knotted at the nape of her neck, and a neat, clever little face with bright, dark eyes like a bird\x{2019}s. She wasn\x{2019}t pretty exactly, but there was a calm, kindly look on her face that made the ache of panic in Tessa\x{2019}s stomach ease slightly, though she couldn\x{2019}t have said exactly why. In her hand she held a glowing white stone like the one Will had held at the Dark House. Its light blazed out between her fingers, illuminating the room.\x{201c}Miss Gray,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I am Charlotte Branwell, head of the London Institute, and this beside me is Brother Enoch\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}What kind of monster is he?\x{201d} Tessa whispered.Brother Enoch said nothing. He was entirely expressionless.\x{201c}I know there are monsters on this earth,\x{201d} said Tessa. \x{201c}You cannot tell me otherwise. I have seen them.\x{201d}\x{201c}I would not want to tell you otherwise,\x{201d} said Mrs. Branwell. \x{201c}If the world were not full of monsters, there would be no need for Shadowhunters.\x{201d}Shadowhunter. What the Dark Sisters had called Will Herondale.Will. \x{201c}I was\x{2014}Will was with me,\x{201d} said Tessa, her voice shaking. \x{201c}In the cellars. Will said\x{2014}\x{201d} She broke off and cringed inwardly. She should not have called Will by his Christian name; it implied an intimacy between them that did not exist. \x{201c}Where is Mr. Herondale?\x{201d}\x{201c}He\x{2019}s here,\x{201d} Mrs. Branwell said calmly. \x{201c}In the Institute.\x{201d}\x{201c}Did he bring me here as well?\x{201d} Tessa whispered.\x{201c}Yes, but there is no need to look betrayed, Miss Gray. You had struck your head quite hard, and Will was concerned about you. Brother Enoch, though his looks might frighten you, is a skilled practitioner of medicine. He has determined that your head injury is slight, and in the main you are suffering from shock and nervous anxiety. In fact, it might be for the best if you sat down now. Hovering barefoot by the door like that will only give you a chill, and do you little good.\x{201d}\x{201c}You mean because I can\x{2019}t run,\x{201d} Tessa said, licking her dry lips. \x{201c}I can\x{2019}t get away.\x{201d}\x{201c}If you demand to get away, as you put it, after we have talked, I will let you go,\x{201d} said Mrs. Branwell. \x{201c}The Nephilim do not trap Downworlders under duress. The Accords forbid it.\x{201d}\x{201c}The Accords?\x{201d}Mrs. Branwell hesitated, then turned to Brother Enoch and said something to him in a low voice. Much to Tessa\x{2019}s relief, he drew up the hood of his parchment-colored robes, hiding his face. A moment later he was moving toward Tessa; she stepped back hurriedly and he opened the door, pausing only for a moment on the threshold.In that moment, he spoke to Tessa. Or perhaps \x{201c}spoke\x{201d} was not the word for it: She heard his voice inside her head, rather than outside it. You are Eidolon, Theresa Gray. Shape-changer. But not of a sort that is familiar to me. There is no demon\x{2019}s mark on you.Shape-changer. He knew what she was. She stared at him, her heart pounding, as he went through the door and closed it behind him. Tessa knew somehow that if she were to run to the door and try the handle she would once again find it locked, but the urge to escape had left her. Her knees felt as if they had turned to water. She sank down in one of the large chairs by the bed.\x{201c}What is it?\x{201d} Mrs. Branwell asked, moving to sit in the chair opposite Tessa\x{2019}s. Her dress hung so loosely on her small frame, it was impossible to tell if she wore a corset beneath it, and the bones in her small wrists were like a child\x{2019}s. \x{201c}What did he say to you?\x{201d}Tessa shook her head, gripping her hands together in her lap so that Mrs. Branwell could not see her fingers trembling.Mrs. Branwell looked at her keenly. \x{201c}First,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}please call me Charlotte, Miss Gray. Everyone in the Institute does. We Shadowhunters are not so formal as most.\x{201d}Tessa nodded, feeling her cheeks flush. It was hard to tell how old Charlotte was; she was so small that she looked quite young indeed, but her air of authority made her seem older, old enough that the idea of calling her by her Christian name seemed very odd. Still, as Aunt Harriet would have said, when in Rome \x{2026}\x{201c}Charlotte,\x{201d} Tessa said, experimentally.With a smile, Mrs. Branwell\x{2014}Charlotte\x{2014}leaned back slightly in her chair, and Tessa saw with some surprise that she had dark tattoos. A woman with tattoos! Her marks were like the ones Will bore: visible on her wrists below the tight cuffs of her dress, with one like an eye on the back of her left hand. \x{201c}Second, let me tell you what I already know about you, Theresa Gray.\x{201d} She spoke in the same calm tone she\x{2019}d had before, but her eyes, though still kind, were sharp as pins. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re American. You came here from New York City because you were following your brother, who had sent you a steamship ticket. His name is Nathaniel.\x{201d}Tessa sat frozen. \x{201c}How do you know all this?\x{201d}\x{201c}I know that Will found you in the Dark Sisters\x{2019} house,\x{201d} Charlotte said. \x{201c}I know that you claimed someone named the Magister was coming for you. I know that you have no idea who the Magister is. And I know that in a battle with the Dark Sisters, you were rendered unconscious and brought here.\x{201d}Charlotte\x{2019}s words were like a key unlocking a door. Suddenly Tessa remembered. Remembered running with Will down the corridor; remembered the metal doors and the room full of blood on the other side; remembered Mrs. Black, her head severed; remembered Will flinging his knife\x{2014}\x{201c}Mrs. Black,\x{201d} she whispered.\x{201c}Dead,\x{201d} said Charlotte. \x{201c}Very.\x{201d} She settled her shoulders against the back of the chair; she was so slight that the chair rose up high above her, as if she were a child sitting in a parent\x{2019}s chair.\x{201c}And Mrs. Dark?\x{201d}\x{201c}Gone. We searched the whole house, and the nearby area, but found no trace of her.\x{201d}\x{201c}The whole house?\x{201d} Tessa\x{2019}s voice shook, very slightly. \x{201c}And there was no one in it? No one else alive, or \x{2026} or dead?\x{201d}\x{201c}We did not find your brother, Miss Gray,\x{201d} Charlotte said. Her tone was gentle. \x{201c}Not in the house, nor in any of the surrounding buildings.\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2014}were looking for him?\x{201d} Tessa was bewildered.\x{201c}We did not find him,\x{201d} Charlotte said again. \x{201c}But we did find your letters.\x{201d}\x{201c}My letters?\x{201d}\x{201c}The letters you wrote to your brother and never sent,\x{201d} said Charlotte. \x{201c}Folded under your mattress.\x{201d}\x{201c}You read them?\x{201d}\x{201c}We had to read them,\x{201d} said Charlotte in the same gentle tone. \x{201c}I apologize for that. It is not often that we bring a Downworlder into the Institute, or anyone who is not a Shadowhunter. It represents a great risk to us. We had to know that you were not a danger.\x{201d}Tessa turned her head to the side. There was something horribly violating about this stranger having read her inmost thoughts, all the dreams and hopes and fears she\x{2019}d poured forth, not thinking anyone would ever see them. The backs of her eyes stung; tears were threatening, and she willed them back, furious with herself, with everything.\x{201c}You\x{2019}re trying not to cry,\x{201d} Charlotte said. \x{201c}I know that when I do that myself, it sometimes helps to look at a bright light directly. Try the witchlight.\x{201d}Tessa moved her gaze to the stone in Charlotte\x{2019}s hand and gazed at it fixedly. The glow of it swelled up in front of her eyes like an expanding sun. \x{201c}So,\x{201d} she said, fighting past the tightness in her throat, \x{201c}you have decided I am not a danger, then?\x{201d}\x{201c}Perhaps only to yourself,\x{201d} said Charlotte. \x{201c}A power such as yours, the power of shape-shifting\x{2014}it is no wonder the Dark Sisters wanted to get their hands on you. Others will as well.\x{201d}\x{201c}Like you do?\x{201d} Tessa said. \x{201c}Or are you going to pretend that you\x{2019}ve let me into your precious Institute simply out of charity?\x{201d}A look of hurt flashed across Charlotte\x{2019}s face. It was brief, but it was real, and it did more to convince Tessa that she might have been wrong about Charlotte than anything the other woman could have said. \x{201c}It is not charity,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}It is my vocation. Our vocation.\x{201d}Tessa simply looked at her blankly.\x{201c}Perhaps,\x{201d} Charlotte said, \x{201c}it would be better if I explained to you what we are\x{2014}and what we do.\x{201d}\x{201c}Nephilim,\x{201d} said Tessa. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s what the Dark Sisters called Mr. Herondale.\x{201d} She pointed at the dark markings on Charlotte\x{2019}s hand. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re one as well, aren\x{2019}t you? Is that why you have those\x{2014}those markings?\x{201d}Charlotte nodded. \x{201c}I am one of the Nephilim\x{2014}the Shadowhunters. We are \x{2026} a race, if you will, of people, people with special abilities. We are stronger and swifter than most humans. We are able to conceal ourselves with magics called glamours. And we are especially skilled at killing demons.\x{201d}\x{201c}Demons. You mean\x{2014}like Satan?\x{201d}\x{201c}Demons are evil creatures. They travel great distances to come to this world and feed upon it. They would ravage it into ashes and destroy its inhabitants if we did not prevent it.\x{201d} Her voice was intent. \x{201c}As it is the job of the human police to protect the citizenry of this city from one another, it is our job to protect them from demons and other supernatural dangers. When there are crimes that affect the Shadow World, when the Law of our world is broken, we must investigate. We are bound by the Law, in fact, to make inquiries even into the rumor of Covenant Law being contravened. Will told you about the dead girl he found in the alley; she was the only body, but there have been other disappearances, dark rumors of mundane boys and girls vanishing off the city\x{2019}s poorer streets. Using magic to murder human beings is against the Law, and therefore a matter for our jurisdiction.\x{201d}\x{201c}Mr. Herondale seems awfully young to be a sort of policeman.\x{201d}\x{201c}Shadowhunters grow up quickly, and Will did not investigate alone.\x{201d} Charlotte didn\x{2019}t sound as if she wished to elaborate. \x{201c}That is not all we do. We safeguard the Covenant Law and uphold the Accords\x{2014}the laws that govern peace among Downworlders.\x{201d}Will had used that word as well. \x{201c}Downworld? Is that a place?\x{201d}\x{201c}A Downworlder is a being\x{2014}a person\x{2014}who is part supernatural in origin. Vampires, werewolves, faeries, warlocks\x{2014}they are all Downworlders.\x{201d}Tessa stared. Faeries were a children\x{2019}s tale, and vampires the stuff of penny dreadfuls. \x{201c}Those creatures exist?\x{201d}\x{201c}You are a Downworlder,\x{201d} Charlotte said. \x{201c}Brother Enoch confirmed it. We simply don\x{2019}t know of what sort. You see, the kind of magic you can do\x{2014}your ability\x{2014}it isn\x{2019}t something an ordinary human being could do. Neither is it something one of us, a Shadowhunter, could do. Will thought you were most likely a warlock, which is what I would have guessed myself, but all warlocks have some attribute that marks them as warlocks. Wings, or hooves, or webbed toes, or, as you saw in the case of Mrs. Black, taloned hands. But you, you\x{2019}re completely human in appearance. And it is clear from your letters that you know, or believe, both of your parents to be human.\x{201d}\x{201c}Human?\x{201d} Tessa stared. \x{201c}Why wouldn\x{2019}t they have been human?\x{201d}Before Charlotte could answer, the door opened, and a slender, dark-haired girl in a white cap and apron came in, carrying a tea tray, which she set down on the table between them. \x{201c}Sophie,\x{201d} Charlotte said, sounding relieved to see the girl. \x{201c}Thank you. This is Miss Gray. She will be a guest of ours this evening.\x{201d}Sophie straightened, turned to Tessa, and bobbed a curtsy. \x{201c}Miss,\x{201d} she said, but the novelty of being curtsied to was lost on Tessa as Sophie raised her head and her full face became visible. She ought to have been very pretty\x{2014}her eyes were a luminous dark hazel, her skin smooth, her lips soft and delicately shaped\x{2014}but a thick, silvery ridged scar slashed from the left corner of her mouth to her temple, pulling her face sideways and distorting her features into a twisted mask. Tessa tried to hide the shock on her own face, but she could see as Sophie\x{2019}s eyes darkened that it hadn\x{2019}t worked.\x{201c}Sophie,\x{201d} Charlotte said, \x{201c}did you bring in that dark red dress earlier, as I asked? Can you have it brushed and sponged for Tessa?\x{201d} She turned back to Tessa as the maid nodded and went to the wardrobe. \x{201c}I took the liberty of having one of our Jessamine\x{2019}s old dresses made over for you. The clothes you were wearing were ruined.\x{201d}\x{201c}Much obliged,\x{201d} Tessa said stiffly. She hated having to be grateful. The Sisters had pretended they were doing her favors, and look how that had turned out.\x{201c}Miss Gray.\x{201d} Charlotte looked at her earnestly. \x{201c}Shadowhunters and Downworlders are not enemies. Our accord may be an uneasy one, but it is my belief that Downworlders are to be trusted\x{2014}that, indeed, they hold the key to our eventual success against the demon realms. Is there something I can do to show you that we do not plan to take advantage of you?\x{201d}\x{201c}I \x{2026}\x{201d} Tessa took a deep breath. \x{201c}When the Dark Sisters first told me about my power, I thought they were mad,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I told them such things didn\x{2019}t exist. Then I thought I was trapped in some sort of nightmare where they did. But then Mr. Herondale came, and he knew of magic, and had that glowing stone, and I thought, Here is someone who might help me.\x{201d} She looked up at Charlotte. \x{201c}But you do not seem to know why I am the way I am, or even what I am. And if even you do not \x{2026}\x{201d}\x{201c}It can be \x{2026} difficult to learn how the world truly is, to see it in its true shape and form,\x{201d} Charlotte said. \x{201c}Most human beings never do. Most could not bear it. But I have read your letters. And I know that you are strong, Miss Gray. You have withstood what might have killed another young girl, Downworlder or not.\x{201d}\x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t have a choice. I did it for my brother. They would have murdered him.\x{201d}\x{201c}Some people,\x{201d} Charlotte said, \x{201c}would have let that happen. But I know from reading your own words that you never even considered that.\x{201d} She leaned forward. \x{201c}Have you any idea where your brother is? Do you think he is most likely dead?\x{201d}Tessa sucked in a breath.\x{201c}Mrs. Branwell!\x{201d} Sophie, who had been attending to the hem of a wine-red dress with a brush, looked up and spoke with a reproachful tone that surprised Tessa. It was not the place of servants to correct their employers; the books she\x{2019}d read had made that very clear.But Charlotte only looked rueful. \x{201c}Sophie is my good angel,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I tend to be a little too blunt. I thought there might be something you knew, something that wasn\x{2019}t in your letters, that might give us knowledge of his whereabouts.\x{201d}Tessa shook her head. \x{201c}The Dark Sisters told me he was imprisoned in a safe location. I assume he is still there. But I have no idea how to find him.\x{201d}\x{201c}Then you should stay here at the Institute until he can be located.\x{201d}\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t want your charity.\x{201d} Tessa said mulishly. \x{201c}I can find another lodging place.\x{201d}\x{201c}It would not be charity. We are bound by our own laws to help and aid Downworlders. To send you away with nowhere to go would break the Accords, which are important rules we must abide by.\x{201d}\x{201c}And you wouldn\x{2019}t ask for anything in return?\x{201d} Tessa\x{2019}s voice was bitter. \x{201c}You won\x{2019}t ask me to use my\x{2014}my ability? You won\x{2019}t require me to Change?\x{201d}\x{201c}If,\x{201d} Charlotte said, \x{201c}you do not wish to use your power, then no, we will not force you to. Though I do believe you yourself might benefit from learning how it might be controlled and used\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}No!\x{201d} Tessa\x{2019}s cry was so loud that Sophie jumped and dropped her brush. Charlotte glanced over at her and then back at Tessa. She said, \x{201c}As you wish, Miss Gray. There are other ways you could assist us. I\x{2019}m sure there is much that you know that was not contained in your letters. And in return, we could help you to search for your brother.\x{201d}Tessa\x{2019}s head went up. \x{201c}You would do that?\x{201d}\x{201c}You have my word.\x{201d} Charlotte stood up. Neither of them had touched the tea on its tray. \x{201c}Sophie, if you could help Miss Gray dress, and then bring her in to dinner?\x{201d}\x{201c}Dinner?\x{201d} After hearing such a deal about Nephilim, and Downworld, and faeries and vampires and demons, the prospect of dinner was almost shocking in its ordinariness.\x{201c}Certainly. It\x{2019}s <<nearly seven o\x{2019}clock|6>>. You\x{2019}ve already met Will; you can meet everyone else. Perhaps you\x{2019}ll see that we\x{2019}re to be trusted.\x{201d}And with a brisk nod, Charlotte left the room. As the door closed after her, Tessa shook her head mutely. Aunt Harriet had been bossy, but she\x{2019}d had nothing on Charlotte Branwell.\x{201c}She has a strict manner, but she\x{2019}s really very kind,\x{201d} Sophie said, laying out on the bed the dress Tessa was meant to wear. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve never known anyone with a better heart.\x{201d}Tessa touched the sleeve of the dress with the tip of her finger. It was dark red satin, as Charlotte had said, with black moir\x{e9} ribbon trim around the waist and hem. She had never worn anything so nice.\x{201c}Would you like me to help you get dressed for dinner, miss?\x{201d} Sophie asked. Tessa remembered something Aunt Harriet had always said\x{2014}that you could know a man not by what his friends said about him, but by how he treated his servants. If Sophie thought Charlotte had a good heart, then perhaps she did.She raised her head. \x{201c}Much obliged, Sophie. I believe I would.\x{201d}Tessa had never had anyone assist her in getting dressed before, other than her aunt. Though Tessa was slender, the dress had clearly been made for a smaller girl, and Sophie had to lace Tessa\x{2019}s stays tightly to make it fit. She clucked under her breath while she did it. \x{201c}Mrs. Branwell doesn\x{2019}t believe in tight lacing,\x{201d} she explained. \x{201c}She says it causes nervous headaches and weakness, and a Shadowhunter can\x{2019}t afford to be weak. But Miss Jessamine likes the waists of her dresses very small, and she does insist.\x{201d}\x{201c}Well,\x{201d} said Tessa, a little breathless, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not a Shadowhunter, anyway.\x{201d}\x{201c}There is that,\x{201d} Sophie agreed, doing up the back of the dress with a clever little buttonhook. \x{201c}There. What do you think?\x{201d}Tessa looked at herself in the mirror, and was taken aback. The dress was too small on her, and had clearly been designed to be fitted closely to the body as it was. It clung almost shockingly to her figure down to the hips, where it swelled into gathers in the back, draped over a modest bustle. The sleeves were turned back, showing frills of champagne lace at the cuffs. She looked\x{2014}older, she thought, not the tragic scarecrow she had looked in the Dark House, but not someone entirely familiar to herself either. What if one of the times I Changed, when I turned back into myself, I didn\x{2019}t do it quite right? What if this isn\x{2019}t even my true face? The thought sent such a bolt of panic through her that she felt as if she might faint.\x{201c}You are a little pale,\x{201d} Sophie said, examining Tessa\x{2019}s reflection with a judicious gaze. She didn\x{2019}t appear particularly shocked by the dress\x{2019}s tightness, at least. \x{201c}You could try pinching your cheeks a bit to bring the color. That\x{2019}s what Miss Jessamine does.\x{201d}\x{201c}It was awfully kind of her\x{2014}Miss Jessamine, I mean\x{2014}to lend me this dress.\x{201d}Sophie chuckled low in her throat. \x{201c}Miss Jessamine\x{2019}s never worn it. Mrs. Branwell gave it to her as a gift, but Miss Jessamine said it made her look sallow and tossed it in the back of her wardrobe. Ungrateful, if you ask me. Now, go on then and pinch your cheeks a bit. You\x{2019}re pale as milk.\x{201d}Having done so, and having thanked Sophie, Tessa emerged from the bedroom into a long stone corridor. Charlotte was there, waiting for her. She set off immediately, with Tessa behind her, limping slightly\x{2014}the black silk shoes, which did not quite fit, were not kind to her bruised feet.Being in the Institute was a bit like being inside a castle\x{2014}the ceiling disappearing up into gloom, the tapestries hanging on the walls. Or at least it was what Tessa imagined the inside of a castle might look like. The tapestries bore repeating motifs of stars, swords, and the same sort of designs she\x{2019}d seen inked on Will and Charlotte. There was a single repeating image too, of an angel rising out of a lake, carrying a sword in one hand and a cup in the other. \x{201c}This place used to be a church,\x{201d} Charlotte said, answering Tessa\x{2019}s unasked question. \x{201c}The Church of All-Hallows-the-Less. It burned down during the Great Fire of London. We took over the land after that and built the Institute on the ruins of the old church. It\x{2019}s useful for our purposes to remain on consecrated ground.\x{201d}\x{201c}Don\x{2019}t people think it\x{2019}s odd, you building on the site of an old church like this?\x{201d} Tessa asked, hurrying to keep up.\x{201c}They don\x{2019}t know about it. Mundanes\x{2014}that\x{2019}s what we call ordinary people\x{2014}aren\x{2019}t aware of what we do,\x{201d} Charlotte explained. \x{201c}To them, from the outside the place looks like an empty patch of land. Beyond that, mundanes aren\x{2019}t really very interested in what doesn\x{2019}t affect them directly.\x{201d} She turned to usher Tessa through a door and into a large brightly lit dining room. \x{201c}Here we are.\x{201d}Tessa stood blinking in the sudden illumination. The room was huge, big enough for a table that could have seated twenty people. An immense gasolier hung down from the ceiling, filling the room with a yellowish glow. Over a sideboard loaded with expensive-looking china, a gilt-framed mirror ran the length of the room. A low glass bowl of white flowers decorated the table\x{2019}s center. Everything was tasteful, and very ordinary. There was nothing unusual about the room, nothing that might hint at the nature of the house\x{2019}s occupants.Though the entire long dining table was draped with white linen, only one end was set, with places for five people. Only two people were already sitting\x{2014}Will and a fair-haired girl about Tessa\x{2019}s age in a shimmering low-necked gown. They appeared to be studiously ignoring each other; Will looked up in apparent relief when Charlotte and Tessa came in. \x{201c}Will,\x{201d} Charlotte said. \x{201c}You remember Miss Gray?\x{201d}\x{201c}My recollection of her,\x{201d} said Will, \x{201c}is most vivid indeed.\x{201d} He was no longer wearing the odd black clothes he\x{2019}d been wearing the day before, but an ordinary pair of trousers and a gray jacket with a black velvet collar. The gray made his eyes look bluer than ever. He grinned at Tessa, who felt herself flush and looked quickly away.\x{201c}And Jessamine\x{2014}Jessie, do look up. Jessie, this is Miss Theresa Gray; Miss Gray, this is Miss Jessamine Lovelace.\x{201d}\x{201c}So pleased to make your acquaintance,\x{201d} Jessamine murmured. Tessa couldn\x{2019}t help staring at her. She was almost ridiculously pretty, what one of Tessa\x{2019}s novels would have called an English rose\x{2014}all silvery fair hair, soft brown eyes, and creamy complexion. She wore a very bright blue dress, and rings on almost every one of her fingers. If she had the same black skin markings that Will and Charlotte did, they weren\x{2019}t visible.Will cast Jessamine a look of plain loathing, and turned to Charlotte. \x{201c}Where\x{2019}s your benighted husband, then?\x{201d}Charlotte, taking a seat, gestured for Tessa to sit opposite her, in the chair beside Will. \x{201c}Henry is in his workroom. I\x{2019}ve sent Thomas to fetch him. He\x{2019}ll be up in a moment.\x{201d}\x{201c}And Jem?\x{201d}Charlotte\x{2019}s look was warning, but \x{201c}Jem is unwell\x{201d} was all she said. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s having one of his days.\x{201d}\x{201c}He\x{2019}s always having one of his days.\x{201d} Jessamine sounded disgusted.Tessa was about to inquire as to who Jem might be, when Sophie entered, followed by a plump woman of middle age whose gray hair was escaping from a bun at the back of her head. The two of them began to serve food from the sideboard. There was roast pork, potatoes, savory soup, and fluffy dinner rolls with creamy yellow butter. Tessa felt suddenly light-headed; she had forgotten how hungry she was. She bit into a roll, only to check herself when she saw Jessamine staring.\x{201c}You know,\x{201d} Jessamine said airily, \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t believe I\x{2019}ve ever seen a warlock eat before. I suppose you needn\x{2019}t ever bant, do you? You can just use magic to make yourself slender.\x{201d}\x{201c}We don\x{2019}t know for certain that she\x{2019}s a warlock, Jessie,\x{201d} said Will.Jessamine ignored him. \x{201c}Is it dreadful, being so evil? Are you worried you\x{2019}ll go to Hell?\x{201d} She leaned closer to Tessa. \x{201c}What do you think the Devil\x{2019}s like?\x{201d}Tessa set her fork down. \x{201c}Would you like to meet him? I could summon him up in a trice if you like. Being a warlock, and all.\x{201d}Will let out a whoop of laughter. Jessamine\x{2019}s eyes narrowed. \x{201c}There\x{2019}s no call to be rude,\x{201d} she began\x{2014}then broke off as Charlotte sat bolt upright with an astonished shriek.\x{201c}Henry!\x{201d}A man was standing in the dining room\x{2019}s arched doorway\x{2014}a familiar-looking tall man, with a shock of ginger hair and hazel eyes. He wore a torn tweed Norfolk jacket over a shockingly bright striped waistcoat; his trousers were covered in what looked peculiarly like coal dust. But none of that was what had made Charlotte scream; it was the fact that his left arm appeared to be on fire. Little flames licked up his arm from a point above his elbow, releasing tendrils of black smoke.\x{201c}Charlotte, darling,\x{201d} Henry said to his wife, who was staring at him in gape-mouthed horror. Jessamine, beside her, was wide eyed. \x{201c}Sorry I\x{2019}m late. You know, I think I might nearly have the Sensor working\x{2014}\x{201d}Will interrupted. \x{201c}Henry,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}you\x{2019}re on fire. You do know that, don\x{2019}t you?\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh, yes,\x{201d} Henry said eagerly. The flames were now nearly to his shoulder. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve been working like a man possessed all day. Charlotte, did you hear what I said about the Sensor?\x{201d}Charlotte dropped her hand from her mouth. \x{201c}Henry!\x{201d} she shrieked. \x{201c}Your arm!\x{201d}Henry glanced down at his arm, and his mouth dropped open. \x{201c}Bloody hell\x{201d} was all he had time to say before Will, exhibiting a startling presence of mind, stood up, seized the vase of flowers off the table, and hurled the contents over Henry. The flames went out, with a faint protesting sizzle, leaving Henry standing soaking wet in the doorway, one sleeve of his jacket blackened and a dozen damp white flowers strewn at his feet.Henry beamed and patted the burned sleeve of his jacket with a look of satisfaction. \x{201c}You know what this means?\x{201d}Will set the vase down. \x{201c}That you set yourself on fire and didn\x{2019}t even notice?\x{201d}\x{201c}That the flame-retardant mixture I developed last week works!\x{201d} Henry said proudly. \x{201c}This material must have been burning for a good ten minutes, and it isn\x{2019}t even half burned through!\x{201d} He squinted down at his arm. \x{201c}Perhaps I ought to set the other sleeve on fire and see how long\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Henry,\x{201d} said Charlotte, who appeared to have recovered from her shock, \x{201c}if you set yourself on fire deliberately, I will institute divorce proceedings. Now sit down and eat your supper. And say hello to our guest.\x{201d}Henry sat, glanced across the table at Tessa\x{2014}and blinked in surprise. \x{201c}I know you,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}You bit me!\x{201d} He sounded pleased about it, as if recollecting a pleasant memory they\x{2019}d both shared.Charlotte shot a despairing look at her husband.\x{201c}Have you asked Miss Gray about the Pandemonium Club yet?\x{201d} Will asked.The Pandemonium Club. \x{201c}I know the words. They were written on the side of Mrs. Dark\x{2019}s carriage,\x{201d} Tessa said.\x{201c}It\x{2019}s an organization,\x{201d} Charlotte said. \x{201c}A rather old organization of mundanes who have interested themselves in the magical arts. At their meetings they do spells and try to summon up demons and spirits.\x{201d} She sighed.Jessamine snorted. \x{201c}I can\x{2019}t imagine why they bother,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}Messing about with spells and wearing hooded robes and setting little fires. It\x{2019}s ridiculous.\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh, they do more than that,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}They\x{2019}re more powerful in Downworld than you might think. Many rich and important figures in mundane society are members\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}That only makes it sillier.\x{201d} Jessamine tossed her hair. \x{201c}They have money and power. Why are they playing around with magic?\x{201d}\x{201c}A good question,\x{201d} said Charlotte. \x{201c}Mundanes who involve themselves in things they know nothing about are likely to meet unpleasant ends.\x{201d}Will shrugged. \x{201c}When I was trying to track down the source of the symbol on that knife Jem and I found in the alley, I was directed to the Pandemonium Club. The members of it in turn directed me to the Dark Sisters. It\x{2019}s their symbol\x{2014}the two serpents. They supervised a set of secret gambling dens frequented by Downworlders. They existed to lure mundanes in and trick them into losing all their money in magical games, then, when the mundanes fell into debt, the Dark Sisters would extort the money back at ruinous rates.\x{201d} Will looked over at Charlotte. \x{201c}They ran some other businesses as well, most unsavory ones. The house in which they kept Tessa, I had been told, was a Downworlder brothel catering to mundanes with unusual tastes.\x{201d}\x{201c}Will, I\x{2019}m not at all sure\x{2014},\x{201d} Charlotte began dubiously.\x{201c}Hmph,\x{201d} Jessamine said. \x{201c}No wonder you were so keen to go there, William.\x{201d}If she had hoped to annoy Will, it didn\x{2019}t work; she might as well not have spoken, for all the attention he paid her. He was looking at Tessa across the table, his eyebrows arched slightly. \x{201c}Have I offended you, Miss Gray? I imagined that after all you\x{2019}ve seen, you would not be easily shocked.\x{201d}\x{201c}I am not offended, Mr. Herondale.\x{201d} Despite her words, Tessa felt her cheeks flame. Well-brought-up young ladies didn\x{2019}t know what a brothel was, and certainly wouldn\x{2019}t say the word in mixed company. Murder was one thing, but this \x{2026} \x{201c}I, ah, don\x{2019}t see how it could have been a \x{2026} place like that,\x{201d} she said as firmly as she could. \x{201c}No one ever came or went, and other than the maidservant and the coachman, I never saw anyone else who lived there.\x{201d}\x{201c}No, by the time I got there, it was quite deserted,\x{201d} Will agreed. \x{201c}Clearly they had decided to suspend business, perhaps in the interests of keeping you isolated.\x{201d} He glanced over at Charlotte. \x{201c}Do you think Miss Gray\x{2019}s brother has the same ability she does? Is that, perhaps, why the Dark Sisters captured him in the first place?\x{201d}Tessa interjected, glad for the change of subject. \x{201c}My brother never showed any sign of such a thing\x{2014}but, then, neither did I until the Dark Sisters found me.\x{201d}\x{201c}What is your ability?\x{201d} Jessamine demanded. \x{201c}Charlotte won\x{2019}t say.\x{201d}\x{201c}Jessamine!\x{201d} Charlotte scowled at her.\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t believe she has one,\x{201d} Jessamine went on. \x{201c}I think she\x{2019}s simply a little sneak who knows that if we believe she\x{2019}s a Downworlder, we\x{2019}ll have to treat her well because of the Accords.\x{201d}Tessa set her jaw. She thought of her Aunt Harriet saying Don\x{2019}t lose your temper, Tessa, and Don\x{2019}t fight with your brother simply because he teases you. But she didn\x{2019}t care. They were all looking at her\x{2014}Henry with curious hazel eyes, Charlotte with a gaze as sharp as glass, Jessamine with thinly veiled contempt, and Will with cool amusement. What if they all thought what Jessamine thought? What if they all thought she was angling for charity? Aunt Harriet would have hated accepting charity even more than she\x{2019}d disapproved of Tessa\x{2019}s temper.It was Will who spoke next, leaning forward to look intently into her face. \x{201c}You can keep it a secret,\x{201d} he said softly. \x{201c}But secrets have their own weight, and it can be a very heavy one.\x{201d}Tessa raised her head. \x{201c}It needn\x{2019}t be a secret. But it would be easier for me to show you than to tell you.\x{201d}\x{201c}Excellent!\x{201d} Henry looked pleased. \x{201c}I enjoy being shown things. Is there anything you require, like a spirit lamp, or\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}It\x{2019}s not a s\x{e9}ance, Henry,\x{201d} Charlotte said wearily. She turned to Tessa. \x{201c}You don\x{2019}t need to do this if you don\x{2019}t want to, Miss Gray.\x{201d}Tessa ignored her. \x{201c}Actually, I do require something.\x{201d} She turned to Jessamine. \x{201c}Something of yours, please. A ring, or a handkerchief\x{2014}\x{201d}Jessamine wrinkled her nose. \x{201c}Dear me, it sounds to me rather as if your special power is pickpocketing!\x{201d}Will looked exasperated. \x{201c}Give her a ring, Jessie. You\x{2019}re wearing enough of them.\x{201d}\x{201c}You give her something, then.\x{201d} Jessamine set her chin.\x{201c}No.\x{201d} Tessa spoke firmly. \x{201c}It must be something of yours.\x{201d} Because of everyone here, you\x{2019}re the closest to me in size and shape. If I transform into tiny Charlotte, this dress will simply fall off me, Tessa thought. She had considered trying to use the dress itself, but since Jessamine had never worn it, Tessa wasn\x{2019}t sure the Change would work and didn\x{2019}t want to take any chances.\x{201c}Oh, very well then.\x{201d} Petulantly Jessamine detached from her smallest finger a ring with a red stone set in it, and passed it across the table to Tessa. \x{201c}This had better be worth the trouble.\x{201d}Oh, it will be. Unsmiling, Tessa put the ring in the palm of her left hand and closed her fingers around it. Then she shut her eyes.It was always the same: nothing at first, then the flicker of something at the back of her mind, like someone lighting a candle in a dark room. She groped her way toward it, as the Dark Sisters had taught her. It was hard to strip away the fear and the shyness, but she had done it enough times now to know what to expect\x{2014}the reaching forward to touch the light at the center of the darkness; the sense of light and enveloping warmth, as if she were drawing a blanket, something thick and heavy, around herself, covering every layer of her own skin; and then the light blazing up and surrounding her\x{2014}and she was inside it. Inside someone else\x{2019}s skin. Inside their mind.Jessamine\x{2019}s mind.She was only at the edge of it, her thoughts skimming the surface of Jessamine\x{2019}s like fingers skimming the surface of water. Still, it took her breath away. Tessa had a sudden, flashing image of a bright piece of candy with something dark at its center, like a worm at the core of an apple. She felt resentment, bitter hatred, anger\x{2014}a terrible fierce longing for something\x{2014}Her eyes flew open. She was still sitting at the table, Jessamine\x{2019}s ring clutched in her hand. Her skin zinged with the sharp pins and needles that always accompanied her transformations. She could feel the oddness that was the different weight of another body, not her own; could feel the brush of Jessamine\x{2019}s light hair against her shoulders. Too thick to be held back by the pins that had clasped Tessa\x{2019}s hair, it had come down around her neck in a pale cascade.\x{201c}By the Angel,\x{201d} breathed Charlotte. Tessa looked around the table. They were all staring at her\x{2014}Charlotte and Henry with their mouths open; Will speechless for once, a glass of water frozen halfway to his lips. And Jessamine\x{2014}Jessamine was gazing at her in abject horror, like someone who has seen a vision of their own ghost. For a moment Tessa felt a stab of guilt.It lasted only a moment, though. Slowly Jessamine lowered her hand from her mouth, her face still very pale. \x{201c}Goodness, my nose is enormous,\x{201d} she exclaimed. \x{201c}Why didn\x{2019}t anyone tell me?\x{201d}Unknown",

            "Clockwork Angel5T HE S HADOWHUNTER\x{2019}S C ODEXDreams are true while they last, and do we not live in dreams? \x{2014}Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \x{201c}The Higher Pantheism\x{201d}It took an age of wandering glumly from corridor to identical corridor before Tessa, by lucky chance, recognized a rip in yet another of the endless tapestries and realized that the door to her bedroom must be one of the ones lining that particular hallway. A few minutes of trial and error later, and she was gratefully shutting the correct door behind her and sliding the bolt home in the lock.The moment she was back in her nightgown and had slipped under the covers, she opened The Shadowhunter\x{2019}s Codex and began to read. You\x{2019}ll never understand us from reading a book, Will had said, but that wasn\x{2019}t the point really. He didn\x{2019}t know what books meant to her, that books were symbols of truth and meaning, that this one acknowledged that she existed and that there were others like her in the world. Holding it in her hands made Tessa feel that everything that had happened to her in the past six weeks was real\x{2014}more real even than living through it had been.Tessa learned from the Codex that all Shadowhunters descended from an archangel named Raziel, who had given the first of them a volume called the Gray Book, filled with \x{201c}the language of Heaven\x{201d}\x{2014}the black runic Marks that covered the skin of trained Shadowhunters such as Charlotte and Will. The Marks were cut into their skin with a styluslike tool called a stele\x{2014}the odd penlike object she\x{2019}d seen Will use to draw on the door at the Dark House. The Marks provided Nephilim with all sorts of protection: healing, superhuman strength and speed, night vision, and even allowed them to hide themselves from mundane eyes with runes called glamours. But they were not a gift anyone could use. Cutting Marks into the skin of a Downworlder or human\x{2014}or even a Shadowhunter who was too young or improperly trained\x{2014}would be torturously painful and result in madness or death.The Marks were not the only way they protected themselves\x{2014}they wore tough, enchanted leather garments called gear when they went into battle. There were sketches of men in the gear of different countries. To Tessa\x{2019}s surprise, there were also sketches of women in long shirts and trousers\x{2014}not bloomers, such as the sort she\x{2019}d seen ridiculed in newspapers, but real men\x{2019}s trousers. Turning the page, she shook her head, wondering if Charlotte and Jessamine really wore such outlandish getups.The next pages were devoted to the other gifts Raziel had given the first Shadowhunters\x{2014}powerful magical objects called the Mortal Instruments\x{2014}and a home country: a tiny piece of land sliced out of what was then the Holy Roman Empire, surrounded with wardings so that mundanes could not enter it. It was called Idris.The lamp flickered low as Tessa read, her eyelids slipping lower and lower. Downworlders, she read, were supernatural creatures such as faeries, werewolves, vampires, and warlocks. In the case of vampires and werewolves, they were humans infected with demon disease. Faeries, on the other hand, were half-demon and half-angel, and therefore possessed both great beauty and an evil nature. But warlocks\x{2014}warlocks were the direct offspring of humans and demons. No wonder Charlotte had asked if both her parents were human. But they were, she thought, so I can\x{2019}t possibly be a warlock, thank God. She stared down at an illustration showing a tall man with shaggy hair, standing in the center of a pentagram chalked onto a stone floor. He looked completely normal, save for the fact that he had eyes with slit pupils like a cat\x{2019}s. Candles burned at each of the star\x{2019}s five points. The flames seemed to slide together, blurring as Tessa\x{2019}s own vision blurred in exhaustion. She closed her eyes\x{2014}and was instantly dreaming.In the dream she danced through whirling smoke down a corridor lined with mirrors, and each mirror she passed showed her a different face. She could hear lovely, haunting music. It seemed to come from some distance away, and yet was all around. There was a man walking ahead of her\x{2014}a boy, really, slender and beardless\x{2014}but though she felt that she knew him, she could neither see his face nor recognize him. He might have been her brother, or Will, or someone else entirely. She followed, calling to him, but he receded down the corridor as if the smoke carried him with it. The music rose and rose to a crescendo\x{2014}And Tessa woke, breathing hard, the book sliding off her lap as she sat up. The dream was gone, but the music remained, high and haunting and sweet. She made her way to the door and peered out into the hallway.The music was louder in the corridor. In fact, it was coming from the room across the hall. The door was ajar slightly, and notes seemed to pour through the opening like water through the narrow neck of a vase.A dressing gown hung on a hook by the door; Tessa drew it down and slipped it on over her nightclothes, stepping out into the hallway. As if in a dream, she crossed the corridor and put her hand gently to the door; it swung open under her touch. The room within was dark, lit only by moonlight. She saw that it was not unlike her own bedroom across the hall, the same large four-poster bed, the same dark heavy furniture. The curtains had been pulled back from one tall window, and pale silver light poured into the room like a rain of needles. In the square patch of moonlight before the window, someone was standing. A boy\x{2014}he seemed too slight to be a grown man\x{2014}with a violin propped against his shoulder. His cheek rested against the instrument, and the bow sawed back and forth over the strings, wringing notes out of it, notes as fine and perfect as anything Tessa had ever heard.His eyes were closed. \x{201c}Will?\x{201d} he said, without opening his eyes or ceasing to play. \x{201c}Will, is that you?\x{201d}Tessa said nothing. She could not bear to speak, to interrupt the music\x{2014}but in a moment the boy broke it off himself, lowering his bow and opening his eyes with a frown.\x{201c}Will\x{2014},\x{201d} he started, and then, seeing Tessa, his lips parted in surprise. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re not Will.\x{201d} He sounded curious, but not at all annoyed, despite the fact that Tessa had barged into his bedroom in the middle of the night and surprised him playing the violin in his nightclothes, or what Tessa assumed were his nightclothes. He wore a light loose-fitting set of trousers and a collarless shirt, with a black silk dressing gown tied loosely over them. She had been right. He was young, probably the same age as Will, and the impression of youth was heightened by his slightness. He was tall but very slender, and disappearing below the collar of his shirt, she could see the curling edges of the black designs that she had earlier seen on Will\x{2019}s skin, and on Charlotte\x{2019}s.She knew what they were called now. Marks. And she knew what they made him. Nephilim. The descendant of men and angels. No wonder that in the moonlight his pale skin seemed to shine like Will\x{2019}s witchlight. His hair was pale silver as well, as were his angular eyes.\x{201c}I\x{2019}m so sorry,\x{201d} she said, clearing her throat. The noise sounded terribly harsh to her, and loud in the silence of the room; she wanted to cringe. \x{201c}I\x{2014}I didn\x{2019}t mean to come in here like this. It\x{2019}s\x{2014} My room is across the hall, and \x{2026}\x{201d}\x{201c}That\x{2019}s all right.\x{201d} He lowered the violin from his shoulder. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re Miss Gray, aren\x{2019}t you? The shape-changer girl. Will told me a bit about you.\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh,\x{201d} Tessa said.\x{201c}Oh?\x{201d} The boy\x{2019}s eyebrows rose. \x{201c}You don\x{2019}t sound terribly pleased that I know who you are.\x{201d}\x{201c}It\x{2019}s that I think Will is angry with me,\x{201d} Tessa explained. \x{201c}So whatever he told you\x{2014}\x{201d}He laughed. \x{201c}Will is angry with everyone,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t let it color my judgment.\x{201d}Moonlight spilled off the polished surface of the boy\x{2019}s violin as he turned to lay it down on top of the wardrobe, the bow beside it. When he turned back to her, he was smiling. \x{201c}I should have introduced myself earlier,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m James Carstairs. Please call me Jem\x{2014}everyone does.\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh, you\x{2019}re Jem. You weren\x{2019}t at dinner,\x{201d} Tessa recalled. \x{201c}Charlotte said you were ill. Are you feeling better?\x{201d}He shrugged. \x{201c}I was tired, that\x{2019}s all.\x{201d}\x{201c}Well, I imagine it must be tiring, doing what you all do.\x{201d} Having just read the Codex, Tessa felt herself burning up with questions about Shadowhunters. \x{201c}Will said you came from a long way away to live here\x{2014}were you in Idris?He raised his eyebrows. \x{201c}You know of Idris?\x{201d}\x{201c}Or did you come from another Institute? They\x{2019}re in all the big cities, aren\x{2019}t they? And why to London\x{2014}\x{201d}He interrupted her, bemused. \x{201c}You ask a lot of questions, don\x{2019}t you?\x{201d}\x{201c}My brother always says curiosity is my besetting sin.\x{201d}\x{201c}As sins go, it isn\x{2019}t the worst one.\x{201d} He sat down on the steamer trunk at the foot of the bed, and regarded her with a curious gravity. \x{201c}So go ahead; ask me whatever you want. I can\x{2019}t sleep anyway, and distractions are welcome.\x{201d}Immediately Will\x{2019}s voice rose up in the back of Tessa\x{2019}s head. Jem\x{2019}s parents had been killed by demons. But I can\x{2019}t ask him about that, Tessa thought. Instead she said, \x{201c}Will told me you came from very far away. Where did you live before?\x{201d}\x{201c}Shanghai,\x{201d} Jem said. \x{201c}You know where that is?\x{201d}\x{201c}China,\x{201d} said Tessa with some indignation. \x{201c}Doesn\x{2019}t everyone know that?\x{201d}Jem grinned. \x{201c}You\x{2019}d be surprised.\x{201d}\x{201c}What were you doing in China?\x{201d} Tessa asked, with honest interest. She couldn\x{2019}t quite picture the place Jem was from. When she thought of China, all that came to mind was Marco Polo and tea. She had the sense that it was very, very far, as if Jem had come from the ends of the earth\x{2014}east of the sun and west of the moon, Aunt Harriet would have said. \x{201c}I thought no one went there but missionaries and sailors.\x{201d}\x{201c}Shadowhunters live all over the world. My mother was Chinese; my father was British. They met in London and moved to Shanghai when he was offered the position of running the Institute there.\x{201d}Tessa was startled. If Jem\x{2019}s mother had been Chinese, then so was he, wasn\x{2019}t he? She knew there were Chinese immigrants in New York\x{2014}they mostly worked in laundries or sold hand-rolled cigars from stands on the street. She had never seen one of them who looked anything like Jem, with his odd silvery hair and eyes. Perhaps it had something to do with him being a Shadowhunter? But she couldn\x{2019}t think of a way to ask that didn\x{2019}t seem horrendously rude.Fortunately, Jem didn\x{2019}t seem to be waiting for her to continue the conversation. \x{201c}I apologize for asking, but\x{2014}your parents are dead, aren\x{2019}t they?\x{201d}\x{201c}Did Will tell you that?\x{201d}\x{201c}He didn\x{2019}t need to. We orphans learn to recognize one another. If I might ask\x{2014}were you very young when it happened?\x{201d}\x{201c}I was three when they died in a carriage accident. I hardly remember them at all.\x{201d} Only in tiny flashes\x{2014}the scent of tobacco smoke, or the pale lilac of my mother\x{2019}s dress. \x{201c}My aunt raised me. And my brother, Nathaniel. My aunt, though\x{2014}\x{201d} At this, to her surprise, her throat began to tighten. A vivid picture of Aunt Harriet came to her mind, lying in the narrow brass bed in her bedroom, her eyes bright with fever. Not recognizing Tessa at the end and calling her by her mother\x{2019}s name, Elizabeth. Aunt Harriet had been the only mother Tessa had really ever known. Tessa had held her thin hand while she\x{2019}d died, there in the room with the priest. She remembered thinking that now she truly was alone. \x{201c}She died recently. She took a fever unexpectedly. She never had been very strong.\x{201d}\x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry to hear that,\x{201d} Jem said, and he genuinely did sound sorry.\x{201c}It was terrible because my brother was already gone by then. He\x{2019}d left for England a month before. He\x{2019}d even sent us back presents\x{2014}tea from Fortnum and Mason, and chocolates. And then Aunt took sick and died, and I wrote to him over and over, but my letters came back. I was in despair. And then the ticket arrived. A ticket for a steamship to Southampton, and a note from Nate saying he\x{2019}d meet me at the docks, that I must come live with him in London now that Aunt was gone. Except now I don\x{2019}t think he ever wrote that note at all\x{2014}\x{201d} Tessa broke off, her eyes stinging. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry. I\x{2019}m maundering on. You don\x{2019}t need to hear all this.\x{201d}\x{201c}What sort of man is your brother? What is he like?\x{201d}Tessa looked at Jem with a little surprise. The others had asked her what he might have done to get himself into his current situation, if she knew where the Dark Sisters might be keeping him, if he had the same power she did. But no one had ever asked what he was like.\x{201c}Aunt used to say he was a dreamer,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}He always lived in his head. He never cared about how things were, only how they would be, someday, when he had everything he wanted. When we had everything we wanted,\x{201d} she corrected herself. \x{201c}He used to gamble, I think because he couldn\x{2019}t imagine losing\x{2014}it wasn\x{2019}t part of his dreams.\x{201d}\x{201c}Dreams can be dangerous things.\x{201d}\x{201c}No\x{2014}no.\x{201d} She shook her head. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not saying it right. He was a wonderful brother. He \x{2026}\x{201d} Charlotte was right; it was easier to fight back tears if she found something, some object, to fix her gaze on. She stared at Jem\x{2019}s hands. They were slender and long, and he had the same design on the back of his hand that Will did, the open eye. She pointed at it. \x{201c}What\x{2019}s that meant to do?\x{201d}Jem seemed not to notice she had changed the subject. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s a Mark. You know what those are?\x{201d} He held his hand out to her, palm down. \x{201c}This one is the Voyance. It clears our Sight. Helps us to see Downworld.\x{201d} He turned his hand over, and drew up the sleeve of his shirt. All along the pale inside of his wrist and inner arm were more of the Marks, very black against his white skin. They seemed to thread with the pattern of his veins, as if his blood ran through the Marks, too. \x{201c}For swiftness, night vision, angelic power, to heal quickly,\x{201d} he read out loud. \x{201c}Though their names are more complex than that, and not in English.\x{201d}\x{201c}Do they hurt?\x{201d}\x{201c}They hurt when I received them. They don\x{2019}t hurt at all now.\x{201d} He drew his sleeve down and smiled at her. \x{201c}Now, don\x{2019}t tell me that\x{2019}s all the questions you have.\x{201d}Oh, I have more than you think. \x{201c}Why can\x{2019}t you sleep?\x{201d}She saw that she had caught him off guard; a look of hesitancy flashed across his face before he spoke. But why hesitate? she thought. He could always lie, or simply deflect, as Will would have. But Jem, she sensed instinctively, wouldn\x{2019}t lie. \x{201c}I have bad dreams.\x{201d}\x{201c}I was dreaming too,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I dreamed about your music.\x{201d}He grinned. \x{201c}A nightmare, then?\x{201d}\x{201c}No. It was lovely. The loveliest thing I\x{2019}ve heard since I came to this horrible city.\x{201d}\x{201c}London isn\x{2019}t horrible,\x{201d} Jem said equably. \x{201c}You simply have to get to know it. You must come with me out into London someday. I can show you the parts of it that are beautiful\x{2014}that I love.\x{201d}\x{201c}Singing the praises of our fair city?\x{201d} a light voice inquired. Tessa whirled, and saw Will, leaning against the frame of the doorway. The light from the corridor behind him outlined his damp-looking hair with gold. The hem of his dark overcoat and his black boots were edged with mud, as if he had just come from outdoors, and his cheeks were flushed. He was bareheaded as always. \x{201c}We treat you well here, don\x{2019}t we, James? I doubt I\x{2019}d have that kind of luck in Shanghai. What do you call us there, again?\x{201d}\x{201c}Yang guizi,\x{201d} said Jem, who appeared unsurprised by Will\x{2019}s sudden appearance. \x{201c}\x{2018}Foreign devils.\x{2019}\x{201d}\x{201c}Hear that, Tessa? I\x{2019}m a devil. So are you.\x{201d} Will unhitched himself from the doorway and sauntered into the room. He flung himself down onto the edge of the bed, unbuttoning his coat. It had a shoulder cape attached to it, very elegant, lined in blue silk.\x{201c}Your hair\x{2019}s wet,\x{201d} Jem said. \x{201c}Where have you been?\x{201d}\x{201c}Here, there, and everywhere.\x{201d} Will grinned. Despite his usual grace, there was something about the way he moved\x{2014}the flush on his cheeks and the glitter in his eyes\x{2014}\x{201c}Boiled as an owl, are you?\x{201d} Jem said, not without affection.Ah, Tessa thought. He\x{2019}s drunk. She\x{2019}d seen her own brother under the influence of alcohol enough times to recognize the symptoms. Somehow, she felt obscurely disappointed.Jem grinned. \x{201c}Where have you been? The Blue Dragon? The Mermaid?\x{201d}\x{201c}The Devil Tavern, if you must know.\x{201d} Will sighed and leaned against one of the posts of the bed. \x{201c}I had such plans for this evening. The pursuit of blind drunkenness and wayward women was my goal. But alas, it was not to be. No sooner had I consumed my third drink in the Devil than I was accosted by a delightful small flower-selling child who asked me for twopence for a daisy. The price seemed steep, so I refused. When I told the girl as much, she proceeded to rob me.\x{201d}\x{201c}A little girl robbed you?\x{201d} Tessa said.\x{201c}Actually, she wasn\x{2019}t a little girl at all, as it turns out, but a midget in a dress with a penchant for violence, who goes by the name of Six-Fingered Nigel.\x{201d}\x{201c}Easy mistake to make,\x{201d} Jem said.\x{201c}I caught him in the act of slipping his hand into my pocket,\x{201d} Will said, gesturing animatedly with his scarred, slender hands. \x{201c}I couldn\x{2019}t let that stand, of course. A fight broke out almost immediately. I had the upper hand until Nigel leaped onto the bar and struck me from behind with a pitcher of gin.\x{201d}\x{201c}Ah,\x{201d} said Jem. \x{201c}That does explain why your hair\x{2019}s wet.\x{201d}\x{201c}It was a fair fight,\x{201d} Will said. \x{201c}But the proprietor of the Devil didn\x{2019}t see it that way. Threw me out. I can\x{2019}t go back for a fortnight.\x{201d}\x{201c}Best thing for you,\x{201d} Jem said unsympathetically. \x{201c}Glad to hear it\x{2019}s business as usual, then. I was worried for a moment there that you\x{2019}d come home early to see if I was feeling better.\x{201d}\x{201c}You seem to be doing perfectly well without me. In fact, I see you\x{2019}ve met our resident shape-shifting mystery woman,\x{201d} Will said, glancing toward Tessa. It was the first time he\x{2019}d acknowledged her presence since he\x{2019}d appeared in the doorway. \x{201c}Do you normally turn up in gentlemen\x{2019}s bedrooms in the middle of the night? If I\x{2019}d known that, I would have campaigned harder to make sure Charlotte let you stay.\x{201d}\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t see how what I do is your concern,\x{201d} Tessa replied. \x{201c}Especially since you abandoned me in the corridor and left me to find my own way back to my room.\x{201d}\x{201c}And you found your way to Jem\x{2019}s room instead?\x{201d}\x{201c}It was the violin,\x{201d} Jem explained. \x{201c}She heard me practicing.\x{201d}\x{201c}Ghastly wailing noise, isn\x{2019}t it?\x{201d} Will asked Tessa. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t know how all the cats in the neighborhood don\x{2019}t come running every time he plays.\x{201d}\x{201c}I thought it was pretty.\x{201d}\x{201c}That\x{2019}s because it was,\x{201d} Jem agreed.Will pointed a finger accusingly in their direction. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re ganging up on me. Is this how it\x{2019}s going to be from now on? I\x{2019}ll be odd man out? Dear God, I\x{2019}ll have to befriend Jessamine.\x{201d}\x{201c}Jessamine can\x{2019}t stand you,\x{201d} Jem pointed out.\x{201c}Henry, then.\x{201d}\x{201c}Henry will set you on fire.\x{201d}\x{201c}Thomas,\x{201d} Will suggested.\x{201c}Thomas,\x{201d} Jem began\x{2014}and doubled up, suddenly racked with an explosive fit of coughing so violent that he slid from the steamer trunk to crouch on his knees. Too shocked to move, Tessa could only stare as Will\x{2014}his expansive drunkenness seeming to vanish in a split second\x{2014}sprang off the bed and knelt down by Jem, placing a hand on his shoulder.\x{201c}James,\x{201d} he said quietly. \x{201c}Where is it?\x{201d}Jem held up a hand to ward him off. Racking gasps shook his thin frame. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t need it\x{2014}I\x{2019}m all right\x{2014}\x{201d}He coughed again, and a fine spray of red splattered the floor in front of him. Blood.Will\x{2019}s hand tightened on his friend\x{2019}s shoulder; Tessa saw the knuckles whiten. \x{201c}Where is it? Where did you put it?\x{201d}Jem waved his hand feebly toward the bed. \x{201c}On\x{2014},\x{201d} he gasped. \x{201c}On the mantel\x{2014}in the box\x{2014}the silver one\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}I\x{2019}ll get it, then.\x{201d} It was as gently as Tessa had ever heard Will say anything. \x{201c}Stay here.\x{201d}\x{201c}As if I\x{2019}d go anywhere.\x{201d} Jem scrubbed the back of his hand across his mouth; it came away with red streaking the open-eye Mark.Standing up, Will turned\x{2014}and saw Tessa. For a moment he looked purely startled, as if he\x{2019}d forgotten she was there at all.\x{201c}Will\x{2014},\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}Is there anything\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Come with me.\x{201d} Catching her by the arm, Will marched her, gently, toward the open door. He thrust her out into the corridor, moving to block her view of the room. \x{201c}Good night, Tessa.\x{201d}\x{201c}But he\x{2019}s coughing blood,\x{201d} Tessa protested in a low voice. \x{201c}Perhaps I should get Charlotte\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}No.\x{201d} Will glanced over his shoulder, then back at Tessa. He leaned toward her, his hand on her shoulder. She could feel every one of his fingers pressing into the flesh. They were close enough that she could smell the night air on his skin, the scent of metal and smoke and fog. Something about the way he smelled was strange, but she couldn\x{2019}t place exactly what it was.Will spoke in a low voice. \x{201c}He has medicine. I\x{2019}ll get it for him. There\x{2019}s no need for Charlotte to know about this.\x{201d}\x{201c}But if he\x{2019}s ill\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Please, Tessa.\x{201d} There was a pleading urgency in Will\x{2019}s blue eyes. \x{201c}It would be better if you said nothing about it.\x{201d}Somehow Tessa found she could not say no. \x{201c}I\x{2014}all right.\x{201d}\x{201c}Thank you.\x{201d} Will released her shoulder, and raised his hand to touch her cheek\x{2014}so lightly she thought she might almost have imagined it. Too startled to say anything, she stood in silence as he closed the door between them. As she heard the lock slide home, she realized why she had thought something was odd when Will had leaned toward her.Though Will had said he\x{2019}d been out all night drinking\x{2014}though he\x{2019}d even claimed to have had a pitcher of gin smashed over his head\x{2014}there had been no smell of alcohol on him at all.It was a long time before Tessa could sleep again. She lay awake, the Codex open at her side, the clockwork angel ticking at her chest, and she watched the lamplight trace patterns across the ceiling.Tessa stood looking at herself in the mirror over the vanity table as Sophie did up the buttons on the back of her dress. In the morning light that streamed through the high windows, she looked very pale, the gray shadows under her eyes standing out in splotches.She had never been one to stare in mirrors. A quick glance to see that her hair was all right and that there were no spots on her clothes. Now she could not stop looking at that thin, pale face in the glass. It seemed to ripple as she looked at it, like a reflection seen in water, like the vibration that took her just before the Change. Now that she had worn other faces, seen through other eyes, how could she ever say any face was really her own, even if it was the face she had been given at birth? When she Changed back to herself, how was she to know there wasn\x{2019}t some slight shift in her very self, something that made her not who she was anymore? Or did it matter what she looked like at all? Was her face nothing but a mask of flesh, irrelevant to her true self?She could see Sophie reflected in the mirror as well; her face was turned so that her scarred cheek was to the mirror. It looked even more awful in daylight. It was like seeing a lovely painting slashed to ribbons with a knife. Tessa itched to ask her what had happened, but knew she shouldn\x{2019}t. Instead she said, \x{201c}I\x{2019}m much obliged to you for helping me with the dress.\x{201d}\x{201c}Pleased to be of service, miss.\x{201d} Sophie\x{2019}s tone was flat.\x{201c}I only wanted to ask,\x{201d} Tessa began. Sophie stiffened. She thinks I\x{2019}m going to ask her about her face, Tessa thought. Out loud she said, \x{201c}The way you talked to Will in the corridor last night\x{2014}\x{201d}Sophie laughed. It was a short laugh, but a real one. \x{201c}I am permitted to speak to Mr. Herondale however I like, whenever I like. It\x{2019}s one of the conditions of my employment.\x{201d}\x{201c}Charlotte lets you make your own conditions?\x{201d}\x{201c}It\x{2019}s not simply anyone who can work at the Institute,\x{201d} Sophie explained. \x{201c}You need to have a touch of the Sight. Agatha has it, and so does Thomas. Mrs. Branwell wanted me right away when she knew I had it, said she\x{2019}d been looking for a maid for Miss Jessamine for simply ages. She warned me about Mr. Herondale, though, said he\x{2019}d likely be rude to me, and familiar. She said I could be rude right back, that nobody would mind.\x{201d}\x{201c}Someone ought to be rude to him. He\x{2019}s rude enough to everyone else.\x{201d}\x{201c}I\x{2019}d warrant that\x{2019}s what Mrs. Branwell thought.\x{201d} Sophie shared a grin with Tessa in the mirror; she was absolutely lovely when she smiled, Tessa thought, scar or no scar.\x{201c}You like Charlotte, don\x{2019}t you?\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}She does seem awfully kind.\x{201d}Sophie shrugged. \x{201c}In the old house I was in service in, Mrs. Atkins\x{2014}that was the housekeeper\x{2014}she would keep track of every candle we used, every bit of soap we had. We had to use the soap down to a sliver before she\x{2019}d give us a new bit. But Mrs. Branwell gives me new soap whenever I want it.\x{201d} She said this as if it were a firm testament to Charlotte\x{2019}s character.\x{201c}I suppose they have a lot of money here at the Institute.\x{201d} Tessa thought of the gorgeous furnishings and the grandeur of the place.\x{201c}Perhaps. But I\x{2019}ve made over enough dresses for Mrs. Branwell to know she doesn\x{2019}t buy them new.\x{201d}Tessa thought of the blue gown Jessamine had worn to dinner the night before. \x{201c}What about Miss Lovelace?\x{201d}\x{201c}She has her own money,\x{201d} said Sophie darkly. She stepped back from Tessa. \x{201c}There. You\x{2019}re fit to be seen now.\x{201d}Tessa smiled. \x{201c}Thank you, Sophie.\x{201d}*\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}*\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}*When Tessa came into the dining room, the others were already midway through breakfast\x{2014}Charlotte in a plain gray dress, spreading jam onto a piece of toast; Henry half-hidden behind a newspaper; and Jessamine picking daintily at a bowl of porridge. Will had a pile of eggs and bacon on his plate and was digging into them industriously, which Tessa couldn\x{2019}t help noting was unusual for someone who claimed to have been out drinking all night.\x{201c}We were just talking about you,\x{201d} Jessamine said as Tessa found a seat. She pushed a silver toast rack across the table toward Tessa. \x{201c}Toast?\x{201d}Tessa, picking up her fork, looked around the table anxiously. \x{201c}What about me?\x{201d}\x{201c}What to do with you, of course. Downworlders can\x{2019}t live in the Institute forever,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}I say we sell her to the Gypsies on Hampstead Heath,\x{201d} he added, turning to Charlotte. \x{201c}I hear they purchase spare women as well as horses.\x{201d}\x{201c}Will, stop it.\x{201d} Charlotte glanced up from her breakfast. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s ridiculous.\x{201d}Will leaned back in his chair. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re right. They\x{2019}d never buy her. Too scrawny.\x{201d}\x{201c}That\x{2019}s enough,\x{201d} Charlotte said. \x{201c}Miss Gray shall remain. If for no other reason than because we\x{2019}re in the middle of an investigation that requires her assistance. I\x{2019}ve already dispatched a message to the Clave telling them that we\x{2019}re keeping her here until this Pandemonium Club matter is cleared up and her brother is found. Isn\x{2019}t that right, Henry?\x{201d}\x{201c}Quite,\x{201d} Henry said, setting the newspaper down. \x{201c}The Pandemonium thingie is a top priority. Absolutely.\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2019}d better tell Benedict Lightwood, too,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}You know how he is.\x{201d}Charlotte blanched slightly, and Tessa wondered who Benedict Lightwood might be. \x{201c}Will, today I\x{2019}d like you to revisit the site of the Dark Sisters\x{2019} house; it\x{2019}s abandoned now, but it\x{2019}s still worth a final search. And I want you to take Jem with you\x{2014}\x{201d}At that, the amusement left Will\x{2019}s expression. \x{201c}Is he well enough?\x{201d}\x{201c}He is quite well enough.\x{201d} The voice wasn\x{2019}t Charlotte\x{2019}s. It was Jem\x{2019}s. He had come into the room quietly and was standing by the sideboard, his arms folded across his chest. He was much less pale than he had been the previous night, and the red waistcoat he wore brought a slight tinge of color to his cheeks. \x{201c}In fact, he\x{2019}s ready when you are.\x{201d}\x{201c}You should have some breakfast first,\x{201d} Charlotte fretted, pushing the plate of bacon toward him. Jem sat, and smiled at Tessa across the table. \x{201c}Oh, Jem\x{2014}this is Miss Gray. She\x{2019}s\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}We\x{2019}ve met,\x{201d} Jem said quietly, and Tessa felt a rush of heat in her face. She couldn\x{2019}t help staring at him as he picked up a piece of bread and applied butter to it. It seemed hard to imagine that anyone quite so ethereal-looking could possibly eat toast.Charlotte looked puzzled. \x{201c}You have?\x{201d}\x{201c}I encountered Tessa in the corridor last night and introduced myself. I think I may have given her something of a fright.\x{201d} His silver eyes met Tessa\x{2019}s across the table, sparkling with amusement.Charlotte shrugged. \x{201c}Very well, then. I\x{2019}d like you to go with Will. In the meantime, today, Miss Gray\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Call me Tessa,\x{201d} Tessa said. \x{201c}I would prefer it if everyone did.\x{201d}\x{201c}Very well, Tessa,\x{201d} said Charlotte with a little smile. \x{201c}Henry and I will be paying a call on Mr. Axel Mortmain, your brother\x{2019}s employer, to see if he, or any of his employees, might have any information as to your brother\x{2019}s whereabouts.\x{201d}\x{201c}Thank you.\x{201d} Tessa was surprised. They had said they were going to look for her brother, and they were actually doing it. She hadn\x{2019}t expected that they would.\x{201c}I\x{2019}ve heard of Axel Mortmain,\x{201d} said Jem. \x{201c}He was a taipan, one of the big business heads in Shanghai. His company had offices on the Bund.\x{201d}\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} said Charlotte, \x{201c}the newspapers say he made his fortune in imports of silk and tea.\x{201d}\x{201c}Bah.\x{201d} Jem spoke lightly, but there was an edge to his voice. \x{201c}He made his fortune in opium. All of them did. Buying opium in India, sailing it to Canton, trading it for goods.\x{201d}\x{201c}He wasn\x{2019}t breaking the law, James.\x{201d} Charlotte pushed the newspaper across the table toward Jessamine. \x{201c}Meanwhile, Jessie, perhaps you and Tessa can go through the paper and make note of anything that might pertain to the investigation, or be worth a second look\x{2014}\x{201d}Jessamine recoiled from the paper as if it were a snake. \x{201c}A lady does not read the newspaper. The society pages, perhaps, or the theater news. Not this filth.\x{201d}\x{201c}But you are not a lady, Jessamine\x{2014},\x{201d} Charlotte began.\x{201c}Dear me,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}Such harsh truths so early in the morning cannot be good for the digestion.\x{201d}\x{201c}What I mean,\x{201d} Charlotte said, correcting herself, \x{201c}is that you are a Shadowhunter first, and a lady second.\x{201d}\x{201c}Speak for yourself,\x{201d} Jessamine said, pushing her chair back. Her cheeks had turned an alarming shade of red. \x{201c}You know,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}I wouldn\x{2019}t have expected you to notice, but it seems clear that the only thing Tessa has to put on her back is that awful old red dress of mine, and it doesn\x{2019}t fit her. It doesn\x{2019}t even fit me anymore, and she\x{2019}s taller than I am.\x{201d}\x{201c}Can\x{2019}t Sophie \x{2026} ,\x{201d} Charlotte began vaguely.\x{201c}You can take a dress in. It\x{2019}s another thing to make it twice as big as it was to start with. Really, Charlotte.\x{201d} Jessamine blew out her cheeks in exasperation. \x{201c}I think you ought to let me take poor Tessa into town to get some new clothes. Otherwise, the first time she takes a deep breath, that dress will fall right off her.\x{201d}Will looked interested. \x{201c}I think she should try that out now and see what happens.\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh,\x{201d} Tessa said, thoroughly confused. Why was Jessamine being so kind to her suddenly when she\x{2019}d been so unpleasant only the day before? \x{201c}No, really it\x{2019}s not necessary\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}It is,\x{201d} Jessamine said firmly.Charlotte was shaking her head. \x{201c}Jessamine, as long as you live in the Institute, you are one of us, and you have to contribute\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2019}re the one who insists we have to take in Downworlders who are in trouble, and feed and shelter them,\x{201d} Jessamine said. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m quite sure that includes clothing them as well. You see, I will be contributing\x{2014}to Tessa\x{2019}s upkeep.\x{201d}Henry leaned across the table toward his wife. \x{201c}You\x{2019}d better let her do it,\x{201d} he advised. \x{201c}Remember the last time you tried to get her to sort the daggers in the weapons room, and she used them to cut up all the linens?\x{201d}\x{201c}We needed new linens,\x{201d} said Jessamine, unabashed.\x{201c}Oh, all right,\x{201d} Charlotte snapped. \x{201c}Honestly, sometimes I despair of the lot of you.\x{201d}\x{201c}What\x{2019}ve I done?\x{201d} Jem inquired. \x{201c}I only just arrived.\x{201d}Charlotte put her face into her hands. As Henry began to pat her shoulders and make soothing noises, Will leaned across Tessa toward Jem, ignoring her completely as he did so. \x{201c}Should we leave now?\x{201d}\x{201c}I need to finish my tea first,\x{201d} Jem said. \x{201c}Anyway, I don\x{2019}t see what you\x{2019}re so fired up about. You said the place hadn\x{2019}t been used as a brothel in ages?\x{201d}\x{201c}I want to be back before dark,\x{201d} Will said. He was leaning nearly across Tessa\x{2019}s lap, and she could smell that faint boy-smell of leather and metal that seemed to cling to his hair and skin. \x{201c}I have an assignation in Soho this evening with a certain attractive someone.\x{201d}\x{201c}Goodness,\x{201d} Tessa said to the back of his head. \x{201c}If you keep seeing Six-Fingered Nigel like this, he\x{2019}ll expect you to declare your intentions.\x{201d}Jem choked on his tea.Spending the day with Jessamine began as badly as Tessa had feared. The traffic was dreadful. However crowded New York might have been, Tessa had never seen anything like the snarling mess of the Strand at <<midday|13>>. Carriages rolled side by side with costermongers\x{2019} carts piled high with fruit and vegetables; women shawled and carrying shallow baskets full of flowers dived madly in and out of traffic as they tried to interest the occupants of various carriages in their wares; and cabs came to a full stop in the midst of traffic so that the cabdrivers could scream at one another out their windows. This noise added to the already awesome din\x{2014}ice cream peddlers shouting \x{201c}Hokey-pokey, penny a lump,\x{201d} newspaper boys hawking the day\x{2019}s latest headline, and someone somewhere playing a barrel organ. Tessa wondered how everyone living and working in London wasn\x{2019}t deaf.As she stared out the window, an old woman carrying a large metal cage full of fluttering colorful birds stepped out alongside their coach. The old woman turned her head, and Tessa saw that her skin was as green as a parrot\x{2019}s feathers, her eyes wide and all black like a bird\x{2019}s, her hair a shock of multicolored feathers. Tessa started, and Jessamine, following her gaze, frowned. \x{201c}Close the curtains,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}It keeps out the dust.\x{201d} And, reaching past Tessa, Jessamine did just that.Tessa looked at her. Jessamine\x{2019}s small mouth was set in a thin line. \x{201c}Did you see\x{2014}?\x{201d} Tessa began.\x{201c}No,\x{201d} Jessamine said, shooting Tessa what she had often seen referred to in novels as a \x{201c}killing\x{201d} look. Tessa glanced hastily away.Things did not improve when they finally reached the fashionable West End. Leaving Thomas patiently waiting with the horses, Jessamine dragged Tessa in and out of various dressmakers\x{2019} salons, looking at design after design, standing by while the prettiest shop assistant was chosen to model a sample. (No real lady would let a dress that might have been worn by a stranger touch her skin.) In each establishment she gave a different false name and a different story; in each establishment the owners seemed enchanted by her looks and obvious wealth and couldn\x{2019}t help her fast enough. Tessa, mostly ignored, lurked on the sidelines, half-dead from boredom.In one salon, posing as a young widow, Jessamine even examined the design for a black mourning dress of crepe and lace. Tessa had to admit it would have set off her blond pallor well.\x{201c}You would look absolutely beautiful in this, and could not possibly fail to make an advantageous remarriage.\x{201d} The dressmaker winked in a conspiratorial fashion. \x{201c}In fact, do you know what we call this design? \x{2018}The Trap Rebaited.\x{2019}\x{201d}Jessamine giggled, the dressmaker smiled limpidly, and Tessa considered racing out into the street and ending it all by throwing herself under a hansom cab. As if conscious of her annoyance, Jessamine glanced toward her with a condescending smile. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m also looking for a few dresses for my cousin from America,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}The clothes there are simply horrible. She\x{2019}s as plain as a pin, which doesn\x{2019}t help, but I\x{2019}m sure you can do something with her.\x{201d}The dressmaker blinked as if this were the first time she\x{2019}d noticed Tessa, and perhaps it was. \x{201c}Would you like to choose a design, ma\x{2019}am?\x{201d}The following whirlwind of activity was something of a revelation for Tessa. In New York her clothes had been bought by her aunt\x{2014}ready-made pieces that had had to be altered to fit, and always cheap material in drab shades of dark gray or navy. She had never before learned, as she did now, that blue was a color that suited her and brought out her gray-blue eyes, or that she should wear rose pink to put color in her cheeks. As her measurements were taken amidst a blur of discussion of princess sheaths, cuirass bodices, and someone named Mr. Charles Worth, Tessa stood and stared at her face in the mirror, half-waiting for the features to begin to slip and change, to reform themselves. But she remained herself, and at the end of it all she had four new dresses on order to be delivered later in the week\x{2014}one pink, one yellow, one striped blue and white with bone buttons, and a gold and black silk\x{2014}as well as two smart jackets, one with darling beaded tulle adorning the cuffs.\x{201c}I suspect you may actually look pretty in that last outfit,\x{201d} Jessamine said as they climbed back up into the carriage. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s amazing what fashion can do.\x{201d}Tessa counted silently to ten before she replied. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m awfully obliged to you for everything, Jessamine. Shall we return to the Institute now?\x{201d}At that, the brightness went out of Jessamine\x{2019}s face. She truly hates it there, Tessa thought, puzzled more than anything else. What was so dreadful about the Institute? Of course its whole reason for existing was peculiar enough, certainly, but Jessamine had to be used to that by now. She was a Shadowhunter like the rest.\x{201c}It\x{2019}s such a lovely day,\x{201d} Jessamine said, \x{201c}and you\x{2019}ve hardly seen anything of London. I think a walk in Hyde Park is in order. And after that, we could go to Gunter\x{2019}s and have Thomas get ices for us!\x{201d}Tessa glanced out the window. The sky was hazy and gray, shot through with lines of blue where the clouds briefly drifted apart from one another. In no way would this be considered a lovely day in New York, but London seemed to have different standards for weather. Besides, she owed Jessamine something now, and the last thing in the world the other girl wanted to do, clearly, was go home.\x{201c}I adore parks,\x{201d} said Tessa.Jessamine almost smiled.*\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}*\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}*\x{201c}You didn\x{2019}t tell Miss Gray about the cogs,\x{201d} Henry said.Charlotte looked up from her notes and sighed. It had always been a sore point for her that, however often she had requested a second, the Clave only allowed the Institute one carriage. It was a fine one\x{2014}a town coach\x{2014}and Thomas was an excellent driver. But it did mean that when the Institute\x{2019}s Shadowhunters went their separate ways, as they were doing today, Charlotte was forced to borrow a carriage from Benedict Lightwood, who was far from her favorite person. And the only carriage he was willing to lend her was small and uncomfortable. Poor Henry, who was so very tall, was bumping his head against the low roof.\x{201c}No,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}The poor girl, she seemed so dazed already. I couldn\x{2019}t tell her that the mechanical devices we found in the cellar had been manufactured by the company that employed her brother. She\x{2019}s so worried about him. It seemed more than she\x{2019}d be able to bear.\x{201d}\x{201c}It might not mean anything, darling,\x{201d} Henry reminded her. \x{201c}Mortmain and Company manufactures most of the machine tools used in England. Mortmain is really something of a genius. His patented system for producing ball bearings\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Yes, yes.\x{201d} Charlotte tried to keep the impatience out of her voice. \x{201c}And perhaps we should have told her. But I thought it best that we speak to Mr. Mortmain first and gather what impressions we can. You\x{2019}re correct. He may know nothing at all, and there may be little connection. But it would be quite a coincidence, Henry. And I am very wary of coincidence.\x{201d}She glanced back down at the notes she\x{2019}d made about Axel Mortmain. He was the only (and likely, though the notes did not specify, illegitimate) son of Dr. Hollingworth Mortmain, who in a matter of years had risen from the humble position of ship\x{2019}s surgeon on a trading vessel bound for China to wealthy private trader, buying and selling spices and sugar, silk and tea, and\x{2014}it wasn\x{2019}t stated, but Charlotte was in agreement with Jem on the matter\x{2014}probably opium. When Dr. Mortmain had died, his son, Axel, at barely twenty years of age, had inherited his fortune, which he\x{2019}d promptly invested in building a fleet of ships faster and sleeker than any others plying the seas. Within a decade the younger Mortmain had doubled, then quadrupled, his father\x{2019}s riches.In more recent years he had retired from Shanghai to London, had sold his trading ships, and had used the money to buy a large company that produced the mechanical devices needed to make timepieces, everything from pocket watches to grandfather clocks. He was a very wealthy man.The carriage drew up in front of one of a row of white terraced houses, each with tall windows looking out over the square. Henry leaned out of the carriage and read the number off a brass plaque affixed to a front gatepost. \x{201c}This must be it.\x{201d} He reached for the carriage door.\x{201c}Henry,\x{201d} said Charlotte, placing a hand on his arm. \x{201c}Henry, do keep in mind what we talked about this morning, won\x{2019}t you?\x{201d}He smiled ruefully. \x{201c}I will do my best not to embarrass you or trip up the investigation. Honestly, sometimes I wonder why you bring me along on these things. You know I\x{2019}m a bumbler when it comes to people.\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2019}re not a bumbler, Henry,\x{201d} Charlotte said gently. She longed to reach out and stroke his face, push his hair back and reassure him. But she held herself back. She knew\x{2014}she had been advised enough times\x{2014}not to force on Henry affection he probably did not want.Leaving the carriage with the Lightwoods\x{2019} driver, they mounted the stairs and rang the bell; the door was opened by a footman wearing dark blue livery and a dour expression. \x{201c}Good morning,\x{201d} he said brusquely. \x{201c}Might I inquire as to your business here?\x{201d}Charlotte glanced sideways at Henry, who was staring past the footman with a dreamy sort of expression. Lord knew what his mind was on\x{2014}cogs, gears, and gadgets, no doubt\x{2014}but it certainly wasn\x{2019}t on their present situation. With an inward sigh she said, \x{201c}I am Mrs. Gray, and this is my husband, Mr. Henry Gray. We\x{2019}re seeking a cousin of ours\x{2014}a young man named Nathaniel Gray. We haven\x{2019}t heard from him in nearly six weeks. He is, or was, one of Mr. Mortmain\x{2019}s employees\x{2014}\x{201d}For a moment\x{2014}it might have been her imagination\x{2014}she thought she saw something, a flicker of uneasiness, in the footman\x{2019}s eyes. \x{201c}Mr. Mortmain owns quite a large company. You can\x{2019}t expect him to know the whereabouts of everyone who works for him. That would be impossible. Perhaps you should inquire with the police.\x{201d}Charlotte narrowed her eyes. Before they had left the Institute, she had traced the insides of her arms with persuasion runes. It was the rare mundane who was totally unsusceptible to their influence. \x{201c}We have, but they don\x{2019}t seem to have progressed at all with the case. It\x{2019}s so dreadful, and we\x{2019}re so concerned about Nate, you see. If we could see Mr. Mortmain for a moment \x{2026}\x{201d}She relaxed as the footman nodded slowly. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll inform Mr. Mortmain of your visit,\x{201d} he said, stepping back to allow them inside. \x{201c}Please wait in the vestibule.\x{201d} He looked startled, as if surprised at his own acquiescence.He swung the door wide, and Charlotte followed him in, Henry behind her. Though the footman failed to offer Charlotte a seat\x{2014}a failure of politesse she attributed to the confusion brought on by the persuasion runes\x{2014}he did take Henry\x{2019}s coat and hat, and Charlotte\x{2019}s wrap, before leaving the two of them to stare curiously around the entryway.The room was high ceilinged but not ornate. It was also absent the expected pastoral landscapes and family portraits. Instead, hanging from the ceiling were long silk banners painted with the Chinese characters for good luck; an Indian platter of hammered silver propped in one corner; and pen-and-ink sketches of famous landmarks lining the walls. Charlotte recognized Mount Kilimanjaro, the Egyptian pyramids, the Taj Mahal, and a section of China\x{2019}s Great Wall. Mortmain clearly was a man who traveled a great deal and was proud of the fact.Charlotte turned to look at Henry to see if he was observing what she was, but he was staring vaguely off toward the stairs, lost in his own mind again; before she could say anything, the footman rematerialized, a pleasant smile on his face. \x{201c}Please come this way.\x{201d}Henry and Charlotte followed the footman to the end of the corridor, where he opened a polished oak door and ushered them before him.They found themselves in a grand study, with wide windows looking out onto the square. Dark green curtains were pulled back to let in the light, and through the windowpanes Charlotte could see their borrowed carriage waiting for them at the curb, the horse with its head dipped into a nose-bag, the driver reading a newspaper on his high seat. The green branches of trees moved on the other side of the street, an emerald canopy, but it was noiseless. The windows blocked all sound, and there was nothing audible in this room at all save the faint ticking of a wall clock with mortmain and company engraved on the face in gold.The furniture was dark, a heavy black-grained wood, and the walls were lined with animal heads\x{2014}a tiger, an antelope, and a leopard\x{2014}and more foreign landscapes. There was a great mahogany desk in the center of the room, neatly arranged with stacks of paper, each pile weighted down with a heavy copper gear. A brass-bound globe bearing the legend WYLD\x{2019}S GLOBE OF THE EARTH, WITH THE LATEST DISCOVERIES! anchored one corner of the desk, the lands under the rule of the British empire picked out in pinkish red. Charlotte always found the experience of examining mundane globes a strange one. Their world was not the same shape as the one she knew.Behind the desk sat a man, who rose to his feet as they entered. He was a small energetic-looking figure, a middle-aged man with hair graying suitably at the sideburns. His skin looked windburned, as if he had often been outside in rough weather. His eyes were a very, very light gray, his expression pleasant; despite his elegant, expensive-looking clothes, it was easy to imagine him on the deck of a ship, peering keenly into the distance. \x{201c}Good afternoon,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Walker gave me to understand that you are looking for Mr. Nathaniel Gray?\x{201d}\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} Henry said, to Charlotte\x{2019}s surprise. Henry rarely, if ever, took the lead in conversations with strangers. She wondered if it had anything to do with the intricate-looking blueprint on the desk. Henry was looking at it as yearningly as if it were food. \x{201c}We\x{2019}re his cousins, you know.\x{201d}\x{201c}We do appreciate you taking this time to talk to us, Mr. Mortmain,\x{201d} Charlotte added hastily. \x{201c}We know he was only an employee of yours, one of dozens\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Hundreds,\x{201d} said Mr. Mortmain. He had a pleasant baritone voice, which at the moment sounded very amused. \x{201c}It is true I can\x{2019}t keep track of them all. But I do remember Mr. Gray. Though I must say, if he ever mentioned that he had cousins who were Shadowhunters, I can\x{2019}t say I recall it.\x{201d}Unknown",

We\x{2019}ll tell you if you look convincing.\x{201d}Tessa sighed. Her head throbbed, as did the backs of her eyes. It was exhausting learning how to pretend to be a vampire.It had been two days since Lady Belcourt\x{2019}s visit, and Tessa had spent almost every moment since then attempting to convincingly transform herself into the vampire woman, without enormous success. She still felt as if she were sliding around on the surface of Camille\x{2019}s mind, unable to reach through and grasp hold of thoughts or personality. It made it difficult to know how to walk, how to talk, and what sort of expressions she ought to be wearing when she met the vampires at de Quincey\x{2019}s party\x{2014}whom, no doubt, Camille knew very well, and whom Tessa would be expected to know too.She was in the library now, and had spent the last few hours since lunch practicing walking with Camille\x{2019}s odd gliding walk, and speaking with her careful drawling voice. Pinned at her shoulder was a jeweled brooch that one of Camille\x{2019}s human subjugates, a wrinkled little creature called Archer, had brought over in a trunk. There had been a dress, too, for Tessa to wear to de Quincey\x{2019}s, but it was much too heavy and elaborate for daytime. Tessa made do with her own new blue and white dress, which was bothersomely too tight in the bosom and too loose in the waist whenever she changed into Camille.Jem and Will had set up camp on one of the long tables in the back of the library, ostensibly to help and advise her, but more likely, it seemed, to mock and be amused by her consternation. \x{201c}You point your feet out too much when you walk,\x{201d} Will went on. He was busy polishing an apple on his shirtfront, and appeared not to notice Tessa glaring at him. \x{201c}Camille walks delicately. Like a faun in the woods. Not like a duck.\x{201d}\x{201c}I do not walk like a duck.\x{201d}\x{201c}I like ducks,\x{201d} Jem observed diplomatically. \x{201c}Especially the ones in Hyde Park.\x{201d} He glanced sideways at Will; both boys were sitting on the edge of the high table, their legs dangling over the side. \x{201c}Remember when you tried to convince me to feed a poultry pie to the mallards in the park to see if you could breed a race of cannibal ducks?\x{201d}\x{201c}They ate it too,\x{201d} Will reminisced. \x{201c}Bloodthirsty little beasts. Never trust a duck.\x{201d}\x{201c}Do you mind?\x{201d} Tessa demanded. \x{201c}If you\x{2019}re not going to help me, you might as well both leave. I didn\x{2019}t let you stay here so that I could listen to you nattering on about ducks.\x{201d}\x{201c}Your impatience,\x{201d} said Will, \x{201c}is most unladylike.\x{201d} He grinned at her around the apple. \x{201c}Perhaps Camille\x{2019}s vampire nature is asserting itself?\x{201d}His tone was playful. It was so odd, Tessa thought. Only a few days ago he had snarled at her about his parents, and later had begged her to help him hide Jem\x{2019}s bloody coughing, his face burning with intensity as he did so. And now he was teasing her as if she were a friend\x{2019}s little sister, someone whom he knew casually, perhaps thought of with affection, but for whom he had no complex feelings at all.Tessa bit her lip\x{2014}and winced at the unexpected sharp pain. Camille\x{2019}s vampire teeth\x{2014}her teeth\x{2014}were ruled by an instinct she couldn\x{2019}t understand. They seemed to slide forward without warning or prompting, alerting her to their presence only by sudden bursts of pain as they punctured the fragile skin of her lip. She tasted blood in her mouth\x{2014}her own blood, salty and hot. She pressed her fingertips to her mouth; when she drew her hand away, her fingers were spotted with red.\x{201c}Leave it alone,\x{201d} said Will, setting down his apple and rising to his feet. \x{201c}You\x{2019}ll find you heal very quickly.\x{201d}Tessa poked at her left incisor with her tongue. It was flat again, an ordinary tooth. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t understand what makes them come out like that!\x{201d}\x{201c}Hunger,\x{201d} said Jem. \x{201c}Were you thinking about blood?\x{201d}\x{201c}No.\x{201d}\x{201c}Were you thinking about eating me?\x{201d} Will inquired.\x{201c}No!\x{201d}\x{201c}No one would blame you,\x{201d} said Jem. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s very annoying.\x{201d}Tessa sighed. \x{201c}Camille is so difficult. I don\x{2019}t understand the first thing about her, much less being her.\x{201d}Jem looked at her closely. \x{201c}Are you able to touch her thoughts? The way you said you could touch the thoughts of those you transformed into?\x{201d}\x{201c}Not yet. I\x{2019}ve been trying, but all I get are occasional flashes, images. Her thoughts seem very well protected.\x{201d}\x{201c}Well, hopefully you can break through that protection before tomorrow night,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}Or I wouldn\x{2019}t say much about our chances.\x{201d}\x{201c}Will,\x{201d} Jem chided. \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t say that.\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2019}re right,\x{201d} Will said. \x{201c}I shouldn\x{2019}t underestimate my own skills. Should Tessa make a mess of things, I\x{2019}m sure I\x{2019}ll be able to fight our way through the slavering vampire masses to freedom.\x{201d}Jem\x{2014}as was his habit, Tessa was starting to realize\x{2014}simply ignored this. \x{201c}Perhaps,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}you can only touch the thoughts of the dead, Tessa? Perhaps most of the objects given to you by the Dark Sisters were taken from people they had murdered.\x{201d}\x{201c}No. I touched Jessamine\x{2019}s thoughts when I Changed into her. So that can\x{2019}t be it, thankfully. What a morbid talent that would be.\x{201d}Jem was looking at her with thoughtful silver eyes; something about the intensity of his gaze made her feel almost uncomfortable. \x{201c}How clearly can you see the thoughts of the dead? For instance, if I gave you an item that had once belonged to my father, would you know what he was thinking when he died?\x{201d}It was Will\x{2019}s turn to look alarmed. \x{201c}James, I don\x{2019}t think\x{2014},\x{201d} he began, but broke off as the door to the library opened and Charlotte entered the room. She wasn\x{2019}t alone. There were at least a dozen men following her, strangers whom Tessa had never seen before.\x{201c}The Enclave,\x{201d} Will whispered, and gestured for Jem and Tessa to duck behind one of the ten-foot bookcases. They observed from their hiding place as the room filled with Shadowhunters\x{2014}most of them men. But Tessa saw, as they filed into the room, that among them were two women.She could not help staring at them, remembering what Will had said about Boadicea, that women could be warriors as well. The taller of the women\x{2014}and she must have been nearly six feet in height\x{2014}had powder white hair wound into a crown at the back of her head. She looked as if she were well into her sixties, and her presence was regal. The second of the women was younger, with dark hair, catlike eyes, and a secretive demeanor.The men were a more mixed group. The eldest was a tall man dressed all in gray. His hair and skin were gray as well, his face bony and aquiline, with a strong, thin nose and a sharp chin. There were hard lines at the corners of his eyes and dark hollows under his cheekbones. His eyes were rimmed with red. Beside him stood the youngest of the group, a boy probably no more than a year older than Jem or Will. He was handsome in an angular sort of way, with sharp but regular features, tousled brown hair, and a watchful expression.Jem made a noise of surprise and displeasure. \x{201c}Gabriel Lightwood,\x{201d} he muttered to Will under his breath. \x{201c}What\x{2019}s he doing here? I thought he was in school in Idris.\x{201d}Will hadn\x{2019}t moved. He was staring at the brown-haired boy with his eyebrows raised, a faint smile playing about his lips.\x{201c}Just don\x{2019}t get into a fight with him, Will,\x{201d} Jem added hastily. \x{201c}Not here. That\x{2019}s all I ask.\x{201d}\x{201c}Rather a lot to ask, don\x{2019}t you think?\x{201d} Will said without looking at Jem. Will had leaned out from behind the bookcase, and was watching Charlotte as she ushered everyone toward the large table at the front of the room. She seemed to be urging everyone to settle themselves into seats around it.\x{201c}Frederick Ashdown and George Penhallow, here, if you please,\x{201d} Charlotte said. \x{201c}Lilian Highsmith, if you\x{2019}d sit over there by the map\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}And where is Henry?\x{201d} asked the gray-haired man with an air of brusque politeness. \x{201c}Your husband? As one of the heads of the Institute, he really ought to be here.\x{201d}Charlotte hesitated for only a fraction of a second before plastering a smile onto her face. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s on his way, Mr. Lightwood,\x{201d} she said, and Tessa realized two things\x{2014}one, that the gray-haired man was most likely the father of Gabriel Lightwood, and two, that Charlotte was lying.\x{201c}He\x{2019}d better be,\x{201d} Mr. Lightwood muttered. \x{201c}An Enclave meeting without the head of the Institute present\x{2014}most irregular.\x{201d} He turned then, and though Will moved to duck back behind the tall bookcase, it was too late. The man\x{2019}s eyes narrowed. \x{201c}And who\x{2019}s back there, then? Come out and show yourself!\x{201d}Will glanced toward Jem, who shrugged eloquently. \x{201c}No point hiding till they drag us out, is there?\x{201d}\x{201c}Speak for yourself,\x{201d} Tessa hissed. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t need Charlotte angry at me if we\x{2019}re not supposed to be in here.\x{201d}\x{201c}Don\x{2019}t work yourself into a state. There\x{2019}s no reason you\x{2019}d have had any idea about the Enclave meeting, and Charlotte\x{2019}s perfectly well aware of that,\x{201d} Will said. \x{201c}She always knows exactly who to blame.\x{201d} He grinned. \x{201c}I\x{2019}d turn yourself back into yourself, though, if you take my meaning. No need to give too much of a shock to their hoary old constitutions.\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh!\x{201d} For a moment Tessa had nearly forgotten she was still disguised as Camille. Hastily she went to work stripping away the transformation, and by the time the three of them stepped out from behind the bookshelves, she was her own self again.\x{201c}Will.\x{201d} Charlotte sighed on seeing him, and shook her head at Tessa and Jem. \x{201c}I told you the Enclave would be meeting here at <<four o\x{2019}clock|6>>.\x{201d}\x{201c}Did you?\x{201d} Will said. \x{201c}I must have forgotten that. Dreadful.\x{201d} His eyes slid sideways, and he grinned. \x{201c}\x{2019}Lo there, Gabriel.\x{201d}The brown-haired boy returned Will\x{2019}s look with a furious glare. He had very bright green eyes, and his mouth, as he stared at Will, was hard with disgust. \x{201c}William,\x{201d} he said finally, and with some effort. He turned his gaze on Jem. \x{201c}And James. Aren\x{2019}t you both a little young to be lurking around Enclave meetings?\x{201d}\x{201c}Aren\x{2019}t you?\x{201d} Jem said.\x{201c}I turned eighteen in June,\x{201d} Gabriel said, leaning so far back in his chair that the front legs came off the ground. \x{201c}I have every right to participate in Enclave activities now.\x{201d}\x{201c}How fascinating for you,\x{201d} said the white-haired woman Tessa had thought looked regal. \x{201c}So is this her, Lottie? The warlock girl you were telling us about?\x{201d} The question was directed at Charlotte, but the woman\x{2019}s gaze rested on Tessa. \x{201c}She doesn\x{2019}t look like much.\x{201d}\x{201c}Neither did Magnus Bane the first time I saw him,\x{201d} said Mr. Lightwood, bending a curious eye on Tessa. \x{201c}Let\x{2019}s have it then. Show us what you can do.\x{201d}\x{201c}I\x{2019}m not a warlock,\x{201d} Tessa protested angrily.\x{201c}Well, you\x{2019}re certainly something, my girl,\x{201d} said the older woman. \x{201c}If not a warlock, then what?\x{201d}\x{201c}That will do.\x{201d} Charlotte drew herself up. \x{201c}Miss Gray has already proved her bona fides to me and Mr. Branwell. That will have to be good enough for now\x{2014}at least until the Enclave makes the decision that they wish to utilize her talents.\x{201d}\x{201c}Of course they do,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}We haven\x{2019}t a hope of succeeding in this plan without her\x{2014}\x{201d}Gabriel brought his chair forward with such force that the front legs slammed into the stone floor with a cracking noise. \x{201c}Mrs. Branwell,\x{201d} he said furiously, \x{201c}is William, or is he not, too young to be participating in an Enclave meeting?\x{201d}Charlotte\x{2019}s gaze went from Gabriel\x{2019}s flushed face to Will\x{2019}s expressionless one. She sighed. \x{201c}Yes, he is. Will, Jem, if you\x{2019}ll please wait outside in the corridor with Tessa.\x{201d}Will\x{2019}s expression tightened, but Jem bent a warning look on him, and he remained silent. Gabriel Lightwood looked triumphant. \x{201c}I will show you out,\x{201d} he announced, springing to his feet. He ushered the three of them out of the library, then swung out into the corridor after them. \x{201c}You,\x{201d} he spat at Will, pitching his voice low so that those in the library couldn\x{2019}t overhear him. \x{201c}You disgrace the name of Shadowhunters everywhere.\x{201d}Will leaned against the corridor wall and regarded Gabriel with cool blue eyes. \x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t realize there was much of a name left to disgrace, after your father\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}I will thank you not to speak of my family,\x{201d} Gabriel snarled, reaching behind himself to pull the library door shut.\x{201c}How unfortunate that the prospect of your gratitude is not a tempting one,\x{201d} Will said.Gabriel stared at him, his hair disarrayed, his green eyes brilliant with rage. He reminded Tessa of someone in that moment, though she could not have said who. \x{201c}What?\x{201d} Gabriel growled.\x{201c}He means,\x{201d} Jem clarified, \x{201c}that he doesn\x{2019}t care for your thanks.\x{201d}Gabriel\x{2019}s cheeks darkened to a dull scarlet. \x{201c}If you weren\x{2019}t underage, Herondale, it would be monomachia for us. Just you and me, to the death. I\x{2019}d chop you into bloody carpet rags\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Stop it, Gabriel,\x{201d} Jem interrupted, before Will could reply. \x{201c}Goading Will into single combat\x{2014}that\x{2019}s like punishing a dog after you\x{2019}ve tormented it into biting you. You know how he is.\x{201d}\x{201c}Much obliged, James,\x{201d} Will said, without taking his eyes off Gabriel. \x{201c}I appreciate the testament to my character.\x{201d}Jem shrugged. \x{201c}It is the truth.\x{201d}Gabriel shot Jem a dark glare. \x{201c}Stay out of this, Carstairs. This doesn\x{2019}t concern you.\x{201d}Jem moved closer to the door, and to Will, who was standing perfectly still, matching Gabriel\x{2019}s cold stare with one of his own. The hairs on the back of Tessa\x{2019}s neck had begun to prickle. \x{201c}If it concerns Will, it concerns me,\x{201d} Jem said.Gabriel shook his head. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re a decent Shadowhunter, James,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}and a gentleman. You have your\x{2014}disability, but no one blames you for that. But this\x{2014}\x{201d} He curled his lip, jabbing a finger in Will\x{2019}s direction. \x{201c}This filth will only drag you down. Find someone else to be your parabatai. No one expects Will Herondale to live past nineteen, and no one will be sorry to see him go, either\x{2014}\x{201d}That was too much for Tessa. Without thinking about it she burst out indignantly, \x{201c}What a thing to say!\x{201d}Gabriel, interrupted midrant, looked as shocked as if one of the tapestries had suddenly started talking. \x{201c}Pardon me?\x{201d}\x{201c}You heard me. Telling someone you wouldn\x{2019}t be sorry if they died! It\x{2019}s inexcusable!\x{201d} She took hold of Will by the sleeve. \x{201c}Come along, Will. This\x{2014}this person\x{2014}obviously isn\x{2019}t worth wasting your time on.\x{201d}Will looked hugely entertained. \x{201c}So true.\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2014}you\x{2014}\x{201d} Gabriel, stammering slightly, looked at Tessa in an alarmed sort of way. \x{201c}You haven\x{2019}t the slightest idea of the things he\x{2019}s done\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}And I don\x{2019}t care, either. You\x{2019}re all Nephilim, aren\x{2019}t you? Well, aren\x{2019}t you? You\x{2019}re supposed to be on the same side.\x{201d} Tessa frowned at Gabriel. \x{201c}I think you owe Will an apology.\x{201d}\x{201c}I,\x{201d} said Gabriel, \x{201c}would rather have my entrails yanked out and tied in a knot in front of my own eyes than apologize to such a worm.\x{201d}\x{201c}Gracious,\x{201d} said Jem mildly. \x{201c}You can\x{2019}t mean that. Not the Will being a worm part, of course. The bit about the entrails. That sounds dreadful.\x{201d}\x{201c}I do mean it,\x{201d} said Gabriel, warming to his subject. \x{201c}I would rather be dropped into a vat of Malphas venom and left to dissolve slowly until only my bones were left.\x{201d}\x{201c}Really,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}Because I happen to know a chap who could sell us a vat of\x{2014}\x{201d}The door of the library opened. Mr. Lightwood stood on the threshold. \x{201c}Gabriel,\x{201d} he said in a freezing tone. \x{201c}Do you plan to attend the meeting\x{2014}your first Enclave meeting, if I must remind you\x{2014}or would you rather play out here in the corridor with the rest of the children?\x{201d}No one looked particularly pleased by that comment, especially Gabriel, who swallowed hard, nodded, shot one last glare at Will, and followed his father back into the library, slamming the door shut behind them.\x{201c}Well,\x{201d} said Jem after the door had closed behind Gabriel. \x{201c}That was about as bad as I had expected it would be. Is this the first time you\x{2019}ve seen him since last year\x{2019}s Christmas party?\x{201d} he asked, addressing the question to Will.\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}Do you think I should have told him I missed him?\x{201d}\x{201c}No,\x{201d} said Jem.\x{201c}Is he always like that?\x{201d} Tessa asked. \x{201c}So awful?\x{201d}\x{201c}You should see his older brother,\x{201d} said Jem. \x{201c}Makes Gabriel look sweeter than gingerbread. Hates Will even more than Gabriel, too, if that\x{2019}s possible.\x{201d}Will grinned at that, then turned and began making his way down the corridor, whistling as he went. After a moment\x{2019}s hesitation, Jem went after him, gesturing for Tessa to follow.\x{201c}Why would Gabriel Lightwood hate you, Will?\x{201d} Tessa asked as they went. \x{201c}What did you do to him?\x{201d}\x{201c}It wasn\x{2019}t anything I did to him,\x{201d} Will said, stalking along at a rapid pace. \x{201c}It was something I did to his sister.\x{201d}Tessa looked sideways at Jem, who shrugged. \x{201c}Where there\x{2019}s our Will, there\x{2019}s a half-dozen angry girls claiming he\x{2019}s compromised their virtue.\x{201d}\x{201c}Did you?\x{201d} Tessa asked, hurrying to keep up with the boys. There was simply only so fast you could walk in heavy skirts that swished around your ankles as you went. The delivery of dresses from Bond Street had come the day before, and she was only just beginning to get used to wearing such expensive stuff. She remembered the light dresses she\x{2019}d worn as a little girl, when she\x{2019}d been able to run up to her brother, kick him in the ankle, and dart away without him being able to catch her. She wondered briefly what would happen if she tried to do that to Will. She doubted it would work out to her advantage, though the thought had a certain appeal. \x{201c}Compromise her virtue, I mean.\x{201d}\x{201c}You have a lot of questions,\x{201d} Will said, veering sharply to the left and up a set of narrow stairs. \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t you?\x{201d}\x{201c}I do,\x{201d} Tessa said, the heels of her boots clicking loudly on the stone steps as she followed Will upward. \x{201c}What\x{2019}s parabatai? And what did you mean about Gabriel\x{2019}s father being a disgrace to Shadowhunters?\x{201d}\x{201c}Parabatai in Greek is just a term for a soldier paired with a chariot driver,\x{201d} said Jem, \x{201c}but when Nephilim say it, we mean a matched team of warriors\x{2014}two men who swear to protect each other and guard each other\x{2019}s backs.\x{201d}\x{201c}Men?\x{201d} said Tessa. \x{201c}There couldn\x{2019}t be a team of women, or a woman and a man?\x{201d}\x{201c}I thought you said women didn\x{2019}t have bloodlust,\x{201d} Will said without turning around. \x{201c}And as for Gabriel\x{2019}s father, let\x{2019}s say that he has something of a reputation for liking demons and Downworlders more than he should. I would be surprised if some of the elder Lightwood\x{2019}s nocturnal visits to certain houses in Shadwell haven\x{2019}t left him with a nasty case of demon pox.\x{201d}\x{201c}Demon pox?\x{201d} Tessa was horrified and fascinated at the same time.\x{201c}He\x{2019}s made that up,\x{201d} Jem hastily reassured her. \x{201c}Really, Will. How many times do we have to tell you there\x{2019}s no such thing as demon pox?\x{201d}Will had stopped in front of a narrow door at a bend in the staircase. \x{201c}I think this is it,\x{201d} he said, half to himself, and jiggled the knob. When nothing happened, he took his stele out of his jacket and scrawled a black Mark on the door. It swung open, with a puff of dust. \x{201c}This ought to be a storeroom.\x{201d}Jem followed him inside, and after a moment so did Tessa. She found herself in a small room whose only illumination was from an arched window set high in the wall above. Watery light poured through, showing a square space filled with trunks and boxes. It could have been any spare storage room anywhere, if it hadn\x{2019}t been for what looked like piles of old weapons stacked in the corners\x{2014}heavy rusty-looking iron things with broad blades and chains connected to spiked chunks of metal.Will took hold of one of the trunks and moved it sideways to create a clear square of space on the floor. More dust puffed up. Jem coughed and shot him a reproachful look. \x{201c}One would think you brought us here to murder us,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}if it weren\x{2019}t that your motivations for doing so seem cloudy at best.\x{201d}\x{201c}Not murder,\x{201d} Will said. \x{201c}Hold on. I need to move one more trunk.\x{201d}As he pushed the heavy thing toward the wall, Tessa cast a sidelong look at Jem. \x{201c}What did Gabriel mean,\x{201d} she asked, pitching her voice too low for Will to hear, \x{201c}\x{2018}your disability\x{2019}?\x{201d}Jem\x{2019}s silvery eyes widened fractionally, before he said, \x{201c}My ill health. That\x{2019}s all.\x{201d}He was lying, Tessa knew. He had the same sort of look Nate did when he lied\x{2014}a little too clear-eyed a gaze to be a truthful one. But before she could say anything else, Will straightened up and announced, \x{201c}There we are. Come sit down.\x{201d}He then proceeded to seat himself on the dusty stained floor; Jem went to sit beside him, but Tessa hung back for a moment, hesitant. Will, who had his stele out, looked up at her with a crooked smile. \x{201c}Not going to join us, Tessa? I suppose you don\x{2019}t want to ruin the pretty dress Jessamine bought you.\x{201d}It was the truth, actually. Tessa had no desire to wreck the nicest item of clothing she had ever owned. But Will\x{2019}s mocking tone was more annoying than the thought of destroying the dress. Setting her jaw, she went and sat down opposite the boys, so that they formed a triangle between them.Will placed the tip of the stele against the dirty floor, and began to move it. Broad dark lines flowed from the tip, and Tessa watched in fascination. There was something particular and beautiful about the way the stele scrawled\x{2014}not like ink flowing from a pen, but more as if the lines had always been there, and Will was uncovering them.He was halfway through when Jem made a noise of realization, clearly recognizing the Mark that his friend was drawing. \x{201c}What do you\x{2014},\x{201d} he began, but Will held up the hand he wasn\x{2019}t drawing with, shaking his head.\x{201c}Don\x{2019}t,\x{201d} Will said. \x{201c}If I make a mess of this, we could well fall through the floor.\x{201d}Jem rolled his eyes, but it didn\x{2019}t seem to matter: Will was already finished, and was lifting the stele away from the design he had drawn. Tessa gave a little cry as the warped floorboards between them seemed to shimmer\x{2014}and then became as transparent as a window. Scooting forward, forgetting entirely about her dress, she found herself staring through it as if through a pane of glass.She was looking down into what she realized was the library. She could see the large round table and the Enclave seated at it, Charlotte between Benedict Lightwood and the elegant white-haired woman. Charlotte was easily recognizable, even from above, by the neat knotting of her brown hair and the quick movements of her small hands as she spoke.\x{201c}Why up here?\x{201d} Jem asked Will in a low voice. \x{201c}Why not the weapons room? It\x{2019}s next to the library.\x{201d}\x{201c}Sound radiates,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}Just as easy to listen from up here. Besides which, who\x{2019}s to say one of them wouldn\x{2019}t decide to pay a visit to the weapons room halfway through the meeting to see what we\x{2019}ve in stock? It\x{2019}s happened before.\x{201d}Tessa, staring down in fascination, realized that indeed she could hear the murmur of voices. \x{201c}Can they hear us?\x{201d}Will shook his head. \x{201c}The enchantment is strictly one-way.\x{201d} He frowned, leaning forward. \x{201c}What are they talking about?\x{201d}The three of them fell silent, and in the quiet the sound of Benedict Lightwood\x{2019}s voice rose clearly to their ears. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t know about this, Charlotte,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}This whole plan seems very risky.\x{201d}\x{201c}But we cannot simply let de Quincey go on as he has,\x{201d} Charlotte argued. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s the head vampire of the London clans. The rest of the Night Children look to him for guidance. If we allow him to cavalierly break the Law, what message does that send to Downworld? That the Nephilim have grown lax in their guardianship?\x{201d}\x{201c}Just so I understand,\x{201d} Lightwood said, \x{201c}you\x{2019}re willing to take Lady Belcourt\x{2019}s word that de Quincey, a longtime ally of the Clave, is actually murdering mundanes in his own house?\x{201d}\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t know why you\x{2019}re surprised, Benedict.\x{201d} There was an edge to Charlotte\x{2019}s voice. \x{201c}Is it your suggestion that we ignore her report, despite the fact that she has given us nothing but reliable information in the past? And despite the fact that if she is once again telling the truth, the blood of everyone that de Quincey murders from this point onward will be on our hands?\x{201d}\x{201c}And despite the fact that we are bound by the Law to investigate any report of the Covenant being broken,\x{201d} said a slender dark-haired man at the far end of the table. \x{201c}You know that as well as the rest of us, Benedict; you\x{2019}re simply being stubborn.\x{201d}Charlotte exhaled as Lightwood\x{2019}s face darkened. \x{201c}Thank you, George. I appreciate that,\x{201d} she said.The tall woman who had earlier called Charlotte Lottie gave a low, rumbling laugh. \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t be so dramatic, Charlotte,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}You must admit, the whole business is bizarre. A shape-changing girl who may or may not be a warlock, brothels full of dead bodies, and an informant who swears he sold de Quincey some machine tools\x{2014}a fact that you seem to regard as a piece of the most consummate evidence, despite refusing to tell us your informant\x{2019}s name.\x{201d}\x{201c}I swore I wouldn\x{2019}t involve him,\x{201d} Charlotte protested. \x{201c}He fears de Quincey.\x{201d}\x{201c}Is he a Shadowhunter?\x{201d} Lightwood demanded. \x{201c}Because if not, he isn\x{2019}t reliable.\x{201d}\x{201c}Really, Benedict, your views are most antiquated,\x{201d} said the woman with the catlike eyes. \x{201c}One might believe, talking to you, that the Accords had never happened.\x{201d}\x{201c}Lilian is correct; you\x{2019}re being ridiculous, Benedict,\x{201d} said George Penhallow. \x{201c}Looking for an entirely reliable informant is like looking for a chaste mistress. If they were virtuous, they would be little use to you in the first place. An informant merely provides information; it is our job to verify that information, which is what Charlotte is suggesting that we do.\x{201d}\x{201c}I would simply hate to see the powers of the Enclave misused in this instance,\x{201d} Lightwood said in a silky tone. It was very odd, Tessa thought, hearing this group of elegant adults addressing one another without honorifics, simply by their first names. But it seemed to be Shadowhunter custom. \x{201c}If, for instance, there were a vampire who had a grudge against the head of her clan, and perhaps wanted to see him removed from power, what better way than to get the Clave to do her dirty work for her?\x{201d}\x{201c}Hell,\x{201d} Will muttered, exchanging a glance with Jem. \x{201c}How does he know about that?\x{201d}Jem shook his head, as if to say I don\x{2019}t know.\x{201c}Know about what?\x{201d} Tessa whispered, but her voice was drowned out by Charlotte and the white-haired woman both talking at once.\x{201c}Camille would never do that!\x{201d} Charlotte protested. \x{201c}She isn\x{2019}t a fool, for one thing. She knows what the punishment for lying to us would be!\x{201d}\x{201c}Benedict has a point,\x{201d} said the older woman. \x{201c}It would be better if a Shadowhunter had seen de Quincey breaking the Law\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}But that\x{2019}s the point of this whole enterprise,\x{201d} Charlotte said. There was a tinge to her voice\x{2014}of nervousness, a strained desire to prove herself. Tessa felt a flicker of sympathy for her. \x{201c}To observe de Quincey breaking the Law, Aunt Callida.\x{201d}Tessa made a startled noise.Jem looked up. \x{201c}Yes, she\x{2019}s Charlotte\x{2019}s aunt,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}It was her brother\x{2014}Charlotte\x{2019}s father\x{2014}who used to run the Institute. She likes to tell people what to do. Although, of course she always does whatever she wants.\x{201d}\x{201c}She does at that,\x{201d} Will agreed. \x{201c}Did you know she propositioned me once?\x{201d}Jem did not look as if he believed this even slightly. \x{201c}She did not.\x{201d}\x{201c}She did,\x{201d} Will insisted. \x{201c}It was all very scandalous. I might have acceded to her demands too, if she didn\x{2019}t frighten me so much.\x{201d}Jem simply shook his head and turned his attention back to the scene unfolding in the library. \x{201c}There is also the matter of de Quincey\x{2019}s seal,\x{201d} Charlotte was saying, \x{201c}which we found inside the body of the clockwork girl. There is simply too much evidence linking him to these events, too much evidence not to investigate.\x{201d}\x{201c}I agree,\x{201d} said Lilian. \x{201c}I for one am concerned about this matter of the clockwork creatures. Making clockwork girls is one thing, but what if he\x{2019}s making a clockwork army?\x{201d}\x{201c}That\x{2019}s pure speculation, Lilian,\x{201d} said Frederick Ashdown.Lilian dismissed this with a wave of her hand. \x{201c}An automaton is neither seraph nor demon in its alliance; it is not one of the children of God or of the Devil. Would it be vulnerable to our weapons?\x{201d}\x{201c}I think you\x{2019}re imagining a problem that does not exist,\x{201d} said Benedict Lightwood. \x{201c}There have been automatons for years now; mundanes are fascinated with the creatures. None has posed a threat to us.\x{201d}\x{201c}None has been made using magic before,\x{201d} said Charlotte.\x{201c}That you know of.\x{201d} Lightwood looked impatient.Charlotte straightened her back; only Tessa and the others, looking down upon her, could see that her hands were knotted tightly together in her lap. \x{201c}Your concern, Benedict, seems to be that we will unfairly punish de Quincey for a crime he has not committed, and in doing so jeopardize the relationship between the Night Children and the Nephilim. Am I correct?\x{201d}Benedict Lightwood nodded.\x{201c}But all that Will\x{2019}s plan calls for is for us to observe de Quincey. If we do not see him breaking the Law, we will not act against him, and the relationship will not be threatened. If we do see him breaking the Law, then the relationship is a lie. We cannot allow abuse of Covenant Law, however \x{2026} convenient it might be for us to ignore.\x{201d}\x{201c}I agree with Charlotte,\x{201d} said Gabriel Lightwood, speaking up for the first time, and much to Tessa\x{2019}s surprise. \x{201c}I think her plan is a sound one. Except in one part\x{2014}sending the shape-shifter girl in there with Will Herondale. He isn\x{2019}t even old enough to be at this meeting. How can he be trusted with a mission of this gravity?\x{201d}\x{201c}Smarmy little prig,\x{201d} Will snarled, leaning farther forward, as if he longed to reach through the magical portal and strangle Gabriel. \x{201c}When I get him alone \x{2026}\x{201d}\x{201c}I ought to go in with her instead,\x{201d} Gabriel went on. \x{201c}I can look out for her a bit more. Instead of simply looking out for myself.\x{201d}\x{201c}Hanging\x{2019}s too good for him,\x{201d} agreed Jem, who looked as if he were trying not to laugh.\x{201c}Tessa knows Will,\x{201d} protested Charlotte. \x{201c}She trusts Will.\x{201d}\x{201c}I wouldn\x{2019}t go that far,\x{201d} muttered Tessa.\x{201c}Besides,\x{201d} Charlotte said, \x{201c}it\x{2019}s Will who devised this plan, Will who de Quincey will recognize from the Pandemonium Club. It\x{2019}s Will who knows what to search for inside de Quincey\x{2019}s town house to tie him to the clockwork creatures and the murdered mundanes. Will\x{2019}s an excellent investigator, Gabriel, and a good Shadowhunter. You have to give him that.\x{201d}Gabriel sat back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t have to give him anything.\x{201d}\x{201c}So Will and your warlock girl enter the house, endure de Quincey\x{2019}s party until they observe some contravention of the Law, and then signal to the rest of us\x{2014}how?\x{201d} inquired Lilian.\x{201c}With Henry\x{2019}s invention,\x{201d} Charlotte said. There was a slight\x{2014}only very slight\x{2014}tremble to her voice as she said it. \x{201c}The Phosphor. It will send up a flare of extremely bright witchlight, illuminating all the windows in de Quincey\x{2019}s house, just for a moment. That will be the signal.\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh, good Lord, not one of Henry\x{2019}s inventions again,\x{201d} said George.\x{201c}There were some complications with the Phosphor at first, but Henry demonstrated it for me last night,\x{201d} Charlotte protested. \x{201c}It works perfectly.\x{201d}Frederick snorted. \x{201c}Remember the last time Henry offered us the use of one of his inventions? We were all cleaning fish guts off our gear for days.\x{201d}\x{201c}But it wasn\x{2019}t supposed to be used near water\x{2014},\x{201d} Charlotte began, still in the same quavering voice, but the others had already begun talking over her, chattering excitedly about Henry\x{2019}s failed inventions and the dreadful consequences thereof, while Charlotte lapsed into silence. Poor Charlotte, Tessa thought. Charlotte, whose sense of her own authority was so important, and so dearly bought.\x{201c}Bastards, talking over her like that,\x{201d} muttered Will. Tessa looked at him in astonishment. He was staring intently down at the scene before him, his fists tight at his sides. So he was fond of Charlotte, she thought, and she was surprised how pleased she was to realize it. Perhaps it meant Will actually did have feelings after all.Not that it had anything to do with her, whether he did or not, of course. She looked hastily away from Will, at Jem, who seemed equally out of countenance. He was biting his lip. \x{201c}Where is Henry? Shouldn\x{2019}t he have arrived by now?\x{201d}As if in answer, the door to the storage room banged open with a crash, and the three of them spun around to see Henry standing wild-eyed and wild-haired in the doorway. He was clutching something in his hand\x{2014}the copper tube with the black button on the side that had nearly caused Will to break his arm falling off the sideboard in the dining room.Will eyed it fearfully. \x{201c}Get that blasted object away from me.\x{201d}Henry, who was red-faced and sweating, stared at them all in horror. \x{201c}Hell,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I was looking for the library. The Enclave\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Is meeting,\x{201d} said Jem. \x{201c}Yes, we know. It\x{2019}s a flight down from here, Henry. Third door on the right. And you\x{2019}d better go. Charlotte\x{2019}s waiting for you.\x{201d}\x{201c}I know,\x{201d} Henry wailed. \x{201c}Blast, blast, blast. I was just trying to get the Phosphor right, is all.\x{201d}\x{201c}Henry,\x{201d} Jem said, \x{201c}Charlotte needs you.\x{201d}\x{201c}Right.\x{201d} Henry turned as if to dart out of the room, then swung around and stared at them, a look of confusion passing over his freckled face, as if he had only now had cause to wonder why Will, Tessa, and Jem might be crouching together in a mostly disused storage room. \x{201c}What are you three doing in here, anyway?\x{201d}Will tilted his head to the side and smiled at Henry. \x{201c}Charades,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Massive game.\x{201d}\x{201c}Ah. Right, then,\x{201d} said Henry, and dashed out the door, letting it swing shut behind him.\x{201c}Charades.\x{201d} Jem snorted in disgust, then leaned forward again, elbows on his knees, as Callida\x{2019}s voice drifted up from below. \x{201c}Honestly, Charlotte,\x{201d} she was saying, \x{201c}when will you admit that Henry hasn\x{2019}t anything to do with running this place, and that you\x{2019}re doing it all by yourself? Perhaps with help from James Carstairs and Will Herondale, but neither of them is any older than seventeen. How much help can they be?\x{201d}Charlotte made a murmured noise of deprecation.\x{201c}It\x{2019}s too much for one person, especially someone your age,\x{201d} said Benedict. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re only twenty-three years old. If you\x{2019}d like to step down\x{2014}\x{201d}Only <<twenty-three|9k:0>>! Tessa was astonished. She\x{2019}d thought Charlotte was much older, probably because she exuded such an air of competence.\x{201c}Consul Wayland assigned the running of the Institute to me and my husband five years ago,\x{201d} Charlotte replied sharply, apparently having found her voice again. \x{201c}If you have some issue with his choice, you should take it up with him. In the meantime I shall direct the Institute as I see fit.\x{201d}\x{201c}I hope that means that plans such as the one you\x{2019}re suggesting are still up for a vote?\x{201d} said Benedict Lightwood. \x{201c}Or are you governing by fiat now?\x{201d}\x{201c}Don\x{2019}t be ridiculous, Lightwood, of course it\x{2019}s up for a vote,\x{201d} said Lilian crossly, without giving Charlotte a chance to answer. \x{201c}All in favor of moving on de Quincey, say aye.\x{201d}To Tessa\x{2019}s surprise, there was a chorus of ayes, and not a single nay. The discussion had been contentious enough that she\x{2019}d been certain at least one of the Shadowhunters would try to back out. Jem caught her startled look and smiled. \x{201c}They\x{2019}re always like this,\x{201d} he murmured. \x{201c}They like to jockey for power, but none of them would vote no on an issue like this. They\x{2019}d be branded a coward for doing so.\x{201d}\x{201c}Very well,\x{201d} said Benedict. \x{201c}Tomorrow night it is, then. Is everyone sufficiently prepared? Are there\x{2014}\x{201d}The door to the library banged open, and Henry charged in\x{2014}looking, if possible, even more wild-eyed and wild-haired than before. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m here!\x{201d} he announced. \x{201c}Not too late, am I?\x{201d}Charlotte covered her face with her hands.\x{201c}Henry,\x{201d} said Benedict Lightwood dryly. \x{201c}How pleasant to see you. Your wife was just briefing us on your newest invention. The Phosphor, is it?\x{201d}\x{201c}Yes!\x{201d} Henry held the Phosphor up proudly. \x{201c}This is it. And I can promise it works as advertised. See?\x{201d}\x{201c}Now, there\x{2019}s no need for a demonstration,\x{201d} Benedict began hastily, but it was too late. Henry had already pressed the button. There was a bright flash, and the lights in the library winked out suddenly, leaving Tessa staring at an unlit black square in the floor. Gasps rose up from below. There was a shriek, and something crashed to the ground and shattered. Rising above it all was the sound of Benedict Lightwood, swearing fluently.Will looked up and grinned. \x{201c}Bit awkward for Henry, of course,\x{201d} he remarked cheerfully, \x{201c}and yet, somehow quite satisfying, don\x{2019}t you think?\x{201d}Tessa couldn\x{2019}t help but agree, on both counts.Unknown",

            "Clockwork Angel13S OMETHING D ARKSometimes we are less unhappy in being deceived by those we love, than in being undeceived by them. \x{2014}Fran\x{e7}ois La Rochefoucauld, MaximsTessa woke the next day to Sophie lighting the lamp by her bedside. With a moan Tessa made a move to cover her aching eyes.\x{201c}Now, then, miss.\x{201d} Sophie addressed Tessa with her usual briskness. \x{201c}You\x{2019}ve gone and slept the day away. It\x{2019}s <<past eight o\x{2019}clock in the evening|6>>, and Charlotte said to wake you.\x{201d}\x{201c}<<Past eight|9:1>>? At night?\x{201d} Tessa threw back her blankets, only to realize, to her surprise, that she was still wearing Camille\x{2019}s gown, now crushed and crumpled, not to mention stained. She must have collapsed into bed still entirely dressed. Memories of the night before began to flood into her mind\x{2014}the white faces of vampires, the fire eating its way up the curtains, Magnus Bane laughing, de Quincey, Nathaniel, and Will. Oh, God, she thought. Will.She pushed the thought of him from her mind and sat up, looking anxiously at Sophie. \x{201c}My brother,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}Is he \x{2026}\x{201d}Sophie\x{2019}s smile wavered. \x{201c}No worse, really, but no better, either.\x{201d} Seeing Tessa\x{2019}s stricken expression, she said, \x{201c}A hot bath and food, miss, that\x{2019}s what you need. It won\x{2019}t make your brother any better for you to starve and let yourself get filthy.\x{201d}Tessa looked down at herself. Camille\x{2019}s dress was ruined, that was evident\x{2014}torn and stained with blood and ash in a dozen places. Her silk stockings were ripped, her feet filthy, her hands and arms streaked with grime. She hesitated to think about the state of her hair. \x{201c}I suppose you\x{2019}re right.\x{201d}The bathtub was an oval claw-footed affair hidden behind a Japanese screen in a corner of the room. Sophie had filled it with hot water that was already beginning to cool. Tessa slid behind the screen, undressed, and lowered herself into the bath. The hot water came up to her shoulders, warming her. For a moment she sat motionless, letting the heat soak into her chilled bones. Slowly she began to relax, and closed her eyes\x{2014}Memories of Will flooded in on her. Will, the attic, the way he had touched her hand. The way he had kissed her, then ordered her away.She ducked under the surface of the water as if she could hide from the humiliating memory. It didn\x{2019}t work. Drowning yourself won\x{2019}t help, she told herself sternly. Now, drowning Will, on the other hand \x{2026} She sat up, reached for the cake of lavender soap on the edge of the bath, and scrubbed her skin and hair with it until the water turned black with ash and dirt. Perhaps it wasn\x{2019}t actually possible to scrub away your thoughts of someone, but she could try.Sophie was waiting for Tessa when she emerged from behind the screen. There was a tray of sandwiches and tea at the ready. In front of the mirror, she helped Tessa dress in her yellow gown trimmed with dark braid; it was fussier than Tessa would have preferred, but Jessamine had liked the design very much in the shop and had insisted that Tessa have it made for her. I can\x{2019}t wear yellow, but it\x{2019}s ever so suitable for girls with dull brown hair like yours, she\x{2019}d said.The feeling of the brush going through her hair was very pleasant; it reminded Tessa of when she had been a small girl and Aunt Harriet had brushed her hair for her. It was soothing enough that when Sophie spoke next, it jolted her slightly.\x{201c}Did you manage to get Mr. Herondale to take his medicine last night, miss?\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh, I\x{2014}\x{201d} Tessa scrambled to collect herself, but it was too late; scarlet color had flooded up her neck into her face. \x{201c}He didn\x{2019}t want to,\x{201d} she finished lamely. \x{201c}But I convinced him in the end.\x{201d}\x{201c}I see.\x{201d} Sophie\x{2019}s expression didn\x{2019}t change, but the rhythmic strokes of the brush through Tessa\x{2019}s hair began to come faster. \x{201c}I know it\x{2019}s not my place, but\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Sophie, you can say anything you want to me, truly.\x{201d}\x{201c}It\x{2019}s just\x{2014}Master Will.\x{201d} Sophie\x{2019}s words came out in a rush. \x{201c}He isn\x{2019}t someone you should care for, Miss Tessa. Not like that. He isn\x{2019}t to be trusted, or relied on. He\x{2014}he isn\x{2019}t what you think he is.\x{201d}Tessa clasped her hands in her lap. She felt a vague sense of unreality. Had things really gone so far that she needed to be warned off Will? And yet it was good to have someone to talk to about him. She felt a bit like a starving person being offered food. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t know what I think he is, Sophie. He\x{2019}s like one thing sometimes, and then he can change completely, like the wind changing, and I don\x{2019}t know why, or what\x{2019}s happened\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Nothing. Nothing\x{2019}s happened. He just doesn\x{2019}t care about anyone but himself.\x{201d}\x{201c}He cares about Jem,\x{201d} Tessa said quietly.The brush went still; Sophie had paused, frozen. There was something she wanted to say, Tessa thought, something she was holding herself back from saying. But what was it?The brush began to move again. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s not enough, though.\x{201d}\x{201c}You mean that I shouldn\x{2019}t wring my heart out over some boy who will never care for me\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}No!\x{201d} Sophie said. \x{201c}There are worse things than that. It\x{2019}s all right to love someone who doesn\x{2019}t love you back, as long as they\x{2019}re worth you loving them. As long as they deserve it.\x{201d}The passion in Sophie\x{2019}s voice surprised Tessa. She twisted around to look at the other girl. \x{201c}Sophie, is there someone you care for? Is it Thomas?\x{201d}Sophie looked astonished. \x{201c}Thomas? No. What ever gave you that idea?\x{201d}\x{201c}Well, because I think he cares for you,\x{201d} Tessa said. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve seen him looking at you. He watches you when you\x{2019}re in the room. I suppose I thought \x{2026}\x{201d}Her voice trailed off at Sophie\x{2019}s flabbergasted look.\x{201c}Thomas?\x{201d} Sophie said again. \x{201c}No, that couldn\x{2019}t be. I\x{2019}m sure he hasn\x{2019}t any such thoughts about me.\x{201d}Tessa didn\x{2019}t move to contradict her; clearly, whatever feelings Thomas might have had, Sophie didn\x{2019}t return them. Which left \x{2026}\x{201c}Will?\x{201d} Tessa said. \x{201c}Do you mean you cared for Will once?\x{201d} Which would explain the bitterness and the dislike, she thought, considering how Will treated girls who fancied him.\x{201c}Will?\x{201d} Sophie sounded absolutely horrified\x{2014}horrified enough to forget to call Will Mr. Herondale. \x{201c}Are you asking me if I was ever in love with him?\x{201d}\x{201c}Well, I thought\x{2014} I mean, he\x{2019}s awfully handsome.\x{201d} Tessa realized she sounded rather feeble.\x{201c}There\x{2019}s more to someone being lovable than the way they look. My last employer,\x{201d} Sophie said, her careful accent slipping with her excitement as she spoke, so that \x{201c}last\x{201d} sounded more like \x{201c}larst,\x{201d} \x{201c}he was always off on safari in Africa and India, shooting tigers and things. And he told me that the way you can tell if a bug or a snake is poisonous, like, is if it\x{2019}s got really lovely, bright markings. The more beautiful its skin is, the more deadly it is. That\x{2019}s what Will\x{2019}s like. All that pretty face and whatnot just hides how twisted up and rotten he is on the inside.\x{201d}\x{201c}Sophie, I don\x{2019}t know\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}There\x{2019}s something dark in him,\x{201d} Sophie said. \x{201c}Something black and dark that he\x{2019}s hiding. He\x{2019}s got some sort of secret, the kind that eats you up inside.\x{201d} She set the silver-haired brush down on the vanity, and Tessa saw with surprise that her hand was shaking. \x{201c}You mark my words.\x{201d}After Sophie left, Tessa took the clockwork angel from her bedside table and strung it around her neck. As it settled against her chest, she felt immediately reassured. She had missed it while she\x{2019}d been disguised as Camille. Its presence was a comfort, and\x{2014}though it was foolish, she knew\x{2014}she thought perhaps that if she visited Nate while wearing it, he might feel its presence and be reassured as well.She kept her hand on it as she shut the bedroom door behind her, made her way down the corridor, and knocked on his door softly. When there was no answer, she took hold of the knob and pushed the door open. The curtains in the room were drawn back, the room half-filled with light, and she could see Nate asleep on his back against a mound of pillows. He had one arm flung across his forehead, and his cheeks were bright with fever.He wasn\x{2019}t alone, either. In the armchair by the head of the bed sat Jessamine, a book open on her lap. She met Tessa\x{2019}s surprised look with a cool and level stare.\x{201c}I\x{2014},\x{201d} Tessa began, and collected herself. \x{201c}What are you doing here?\x{201d}\x{201c}I thought I would read to your brother for a while,\x{201d} Jessamine said. \x{201c}Everyone\x{2019}s been asleep half the day, and he was being cruelly neglected. Just Sophie checking in on him, and you can\x{2019}t count on her for decent conversation.\x{201d}\x{201c}Nate\x{2019}s unconscious, Jessamine; he doesn\x{2019}t want conversation.\x{201d}\x{201c}You can\x{2019}t be sure,\x{201d} Jessamine said. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve heard that people can hear what you say to them even if they\x{2019}re quite unconscious, or even dead.\x{201d}\x{201c}He\x{2019}s not dead, either.\x{201d}\x{201c}Certainly not.\x{201d} Jessamine gave him a lingering look. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s far too handsome to die. Is he married, Tessa? Or is there a girl back in New York who has a claim on him?\x{201d}\x{201c}On Nate?\x{201d} Tessa stared. There had always been girls, all sorts of girls, who\x{2019}d been interested in Nate, but he had the attention span of a butterfly. \x{201c}Jessamine, he isn\x{2019}t even conscious. Now is hardly the time\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}He\x{2019}ll get better,\x{201d} Jessamine announced. \x{201c}And when he does, he\x{2019}ll know I\x{2019}m the one who nursed him back to health. Men always fall in love with the woman who nurses them back to health. \x{2018}When pain and anguish wring the brow, / A ministering angel thou!\x{2019}\x{201d} she finished, with a self-satisfied smirk. Seeing Tessa\x{2019}s horrified look, she scowled. \x{201c}What\x{2019}s wrong? Am I not good enough for your precious brother?\x{201d}\x{201c}He doesn\x{2019}t have any money, Jessie\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}I have enough money for both of us. I just need someone to take me away from this place. I told you that.\x{201d}\x{201c}In fact, you asked me if I\x{2019}d be the one to do it.\x{201d}\x{201c}Is that what\x{2019}s putting you out of countenance?\x{201d} Jessamine asked. \x{201c}Really, Tessa, we can still be the best of friends once we\x{2019}re sisters-in-law, but a man is always better than a woman for this sort of thing, don\x{2019}t you think?\x{201d}Tessa could think of nothing to say in reply.Jessamine shrugged. \x{201c}Charlotte wishes to see you, by the way. In the drawing room. She wanted me to tell you. You don\x{2019}t need to worry about Nathaniel. I\x{2019}ve been checking his temperature every quarter hour and putting cold compresses on his forehead besides.\x{201d}Tessa wasn\x{2019}t sure she believed any of this, but as Jessamine was patently uninterested in giving up her place by Nathaniel\x{2019}s side, and it hardly seemed worth a battle, she turned with a disgusted sigh and left the room.The door to the drawing room, when she reached it, was slightly ajar; she could hear raised voices from the other side. She hesitated, her hand half-lifted to knock\x{2014}then she heard the sound of her own name and she froze.\x{201c}This isn\x{2019}t the London Hospital. Tessa\x{2019}s brother shouldn\x{2019}t be here!\x{201d} It was Will\x{2019}s voice, raised to a shout. \x{201c}He\x{2019}s not a Downworlder, just a stupid, venal mundane who found himself mixed up in something he couldn\x{2019}t manage\x{2014}\x{201d}Charlotte replied, \x{201c}He can\x{2019}t be treated by mundane doctors. Not for what\x{2019}s wrong with him. Be reasonable, Will.\x{201d}\x{201c}He already knows about Downworld.\x{201d} The voice was Jem\x{2019}s: calm, logical. \x{201c}In fact, he may know quite a bit of important information that we don\x{2019}t know. Mortmain claimed Nathaniel was working for de Quincey; he might have information about de Quincey\x{2019}s plans, the automatons, the whole Magister business\x{2014}all of it. De Quincey wanted him dead, after all. Perhaps it was because he knew something he shouldn\x{2019}t.\x{201d}There was a long silence. Then, \x{201c}We can call in the Silent Brothers again, then,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}They can claw through his mind, see what they find. We needn\x{2019}t wait for him to wake up.\x{201d}\x{201c}You know that sort of process is delicate with mundanes,\x{201d} protested Charlotte. \x{201c}Brother Enoch has already said that the fever has driven Mr. Gray into hallucinations. It\x{2019}s impossible for him to sort through what in the boy\x{2019}s mind is the truth and what is feverish delirium. Not without damaging his mind, possibly permanently.\x{201d}\x{201c}I doubt it was that much of a mind to begin with.\x{201d} Tessa heard Will\x{2019}s tone of disgust even through the door and felt her stomach tighten with rage.\x{201c}You know nothing about the man.\x{201d} Jem spoke more coldly than Tessa had ever heard him speak before. \x{201c}I can\x{2019}t imagine what\x{2019}s driving this mood of yours, Will, but it does you no credit.\x{201d}\x{201c}I know what it is,\x{201d} Charlotte said.\x{201c}You do?\x{201d} Will sounded appalled.\x{201c}You\x{2019}re as upset as I am about how last night went. We had only two fatalities, true, but de Quincey\x{2019}s escape doesn\x{2019}t reflect well on us. It was my plan. I pushed it on the Enclave, and now they will blame me for anything that went wrong. Not to mention that Camille has had to go into hiding since we\x{2019}ve no idea where de Quincey is, and by now he probably has a blood price on her head. And Magnus Bane, of course, is furious with us that Camille has vanished. So our best informant and our best warlock are lost to us at the moment.\x{201d}\x{201c}But we did stop de Quincey from murdering Tessa\x{2019}s brother and who knows how many more mundanes,\x{201d} Jem said. \x{201c}That should count for something. Benedict Lightwood didn\x{2019}t want to believe in de Quincey\x{2019}s betrayal at first; now he has no choice. He knows you were right.\x{201d}\x{201c}That,\x{201d} said Charlotte, \x{201c}is likely only going to make him angrier.\x{201d}\x{201c}Perhaps,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}And perhaps if you hadn\x{2019}t insisted on tying the success of my plan to the functionality of one of Henry\x{2019}s ridiculous inventions, we wouldn\x{2019}t be having this conversation now. You can dance around it all you like, but the reason everything went wrong last night is because the Phosphor didn\x{2019}t work. Nothing Henry invents ever works. If you\x{2019}d just admit your husband\x{2019}s a useless fool, we\x{2019}d all be a lot better off.\x{201d}\x{201c}Will.\x{201d} Jem\x{2019}s voice held cold fury.\x{201c}No. James, don\x{2019}t.\x{201d} Charlotte\x{2019}s voice shook; there was a sort of thump, as if she\x{2019}d sat herself down very suddenly in a chair. \x{201c}Will,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}Henry is a good, kind man and he loves you.\x{201d}\x{201c}Don\x{2019}t be maudlin, Charlotte.\x{201d} Will\x{2019}s voice held only scorn.\x{201c}He\x{2019}s known you since you were a boy. He cares for you like you were his own younger brother. As do I. All I\x{2019}ve ever done is love you, Will\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} said Will, \x{201c}and I wish you wouldn\x{2019}t.\x{201d}Charlotte made a pained noise, like a kicked puppy. \x{201c}I know you don\x{2019}t mean that.\x{201d}\x{201c}I mean everything I say,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}Especially when I tell you that we\x{2019}re better off sifting through Nathaniel Gray\x{2019}s mind now rather than later. If you\x{2019}re too sentimental to do it\x{2014}\x{201d}Charlotte began to interrupt, but it didn\x{2019}t matter. This was too much for Tessa. She hurled the door open and stalked inside. The inside of the room was lit by a roaring fire, in contrast to the squares of dark gray glass that let in what there was of the cloudy twilight. Charlotte sat behind the large desk, Jem in a chair beside her. Will, on the other hand, was leaning against the fireplace mantel; he was flushed with obvious anger, his eyes blazing, his shirt collar askew. His eyes met Tessa\x{2019}s for a moment of pure astonishment. Any hope she had entertained that he might have magically forgotten what had happened in the attic the night before vanished. He flushed at the sight of her, his fathomless blue eyes darkening\x{2014}and looked away, as if he couldn\x{2019}t stand to hold her gaze.\x{201c}I suppose you\x{2019}ve been eavesdropping, then?\x{201d} he asked. \x{201c}And now you\x{2019}re here to give me a piece of your mind about your precious brother?\x{201d}\x{201c}At least I have a mind to give you a piece of, which Nathaniel won\x{2019}t, if you have your way.\x{201d} Tessa turned to Charlotte. \x{201c}I won\x{2019}t let Brother Enoch go pawing through Nate\x{2019}s mind. He\x{2019}s sick enough already; it would probably kill him.\x{201d}Charlotte shook her head. She looked exhausted, her face gray, her eyelids drooping. Tessa wondered if she\x{2019}d slept at all. \x{201c}Most assuredly, we will allow him to heal before we think about questioning him.\x{201d}\x{201c}What if he\x{2019}s ill for weeks? Or months?\x{201d} Will said. \x{201c}We might not have that much time.\x{201d}\x{201c}Why not? What\x{2019}s so urgent you want to risk my brother\x{2019}s life on it?\x{201d} Tessa snapped.Will\x{2019}s eyes were slivers of blue glass. \x{201c}All you\x{2019}ve ever cared about is finding your brother. And now you\x{2019}ve found him. Good for you. But that was never our goal. You do realize that, don\x{2019}t you? We don\x{2019}t usually go quite this far out of our way for the sake of one delinquent mundane.\x{201d}\x{201c}What Will is trying to say,\x{201d} Jem interjected, \x{201c}though failing at civility, is\x{2014}\x{201d} He broke off, and sighed. \x{201c}De Quincey said that your brother was someone he had trusted. And now de Quincey is gone, and we have no idea where he\x{2019}s hiding. The notes we found in his office hint that de Quincey believed there would soon be a war between Downworlders and Shadowhunters, a war those clockwork creatures he was working on doubtless figured into prominently. You can see why we want to know where he is, and what else your brother might know.\x{201d}\x{201c}Maybe you want to know those things,\x{201d} Tessa said, \x{201c}but it\x{2019}s not my fight. I\x{2019}m not a Shadowhunter.\x{201d}\x{201c}Indeed,\x{201d} said Will. \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t think we don\x{2019}t know that.\x{201d}\x{201c}Be quiet, Will.\x{201d} Charlotte\x{2019}s tone held more than its usual asperity. She turned from him to Tessa, her brown eyes beseeching. \x{201c}We trust you, Tessa. You need to trust us, too.\x{201d}\x{201c}No,\x{201d} Tessa said. \x{201c}No, I don\x{2019}t.\x{201d} She could feel Will\x{2019}s gaze on her and was suddenly filled with a startling rage. How dare he be cold to her, angry at her? What had she done to deserve it? She\x{2019}d let him kiss her. That was all. Somehow, it was as if that alone had erased everything else she had done that evening\x{2014}as if now that she\x{2019}d kissed Will, it no longer mattered that she had also been brave. \x{201c}You wanted to use me\x{2014}just like the Dark Sisters did\x{2014}and the moment you had a chance to, the moment Lady Belcourt came along and you needed what I could do, you wanted me to do it. Never mind how dangerous it was! You behave as if I have some responsibility to your world, your laws and your Accords, but it\x{2019}s your world, and you\x{2019}re the ones meant to govern it. It\x{2019}s not my fault if you\x{2019}re doing a rotten job!\x{201d}Tessa saw Charlotte whiten and sit back. She felt a sharp twinge in her chest. It wasn\x{2019}t Charlotte she had meant to hurt. Still, she went on. She couldn\x{2019}t help herself, the words coming out in a flood, \x{201c}All your talk about Downworlders and how you don\x{2019}t hate them. That\x{2019}s all nothing, isn\x{2019}t it? Just words. You don\x{2019}t mean them. And as for mundanes, have you ever thought maybe you\x{2019}d be better at protecting them if you didn\x{2019}t despise them all so much?\x{201d} She looked at Will. He was pale, his eyes blazing. He looked\x{2014}she wasn\x{2019}t sure she could describe his expression. Horrified, she thought, but not at her; the horror ran deeper than that.\x{201c}Tessa,\x{201d} Charlotte protested, but Tessa was already fumbling for the door. She turned at the last moment, on the threshold, to see them all staring at her.\x{201c}Stay away from my brother,\x{201d} she snapped. \x{201c}And don\x{2019}t follow me.\x{201d}*\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}*\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}*Anger, Tessa thought, was satisfying in its own way, when you gave in to it. There was something peculiarly gratifying about shouting in a blind rage until your words ran out.Of course, the aftermath was less pleasant. Once you\x{2019}d told everyone you hated them and not to come after you, where exactly did you go? If she went back to her own room, it was as much as saying she was just having a tantrum that would wear off. She couldn\x{2019}t go to Nate and bring her black mood into his sickroom, and lurking anywhere else meant risking being found sulking by Sophie or Agatha.In the end she took the narrow, winding stairs that led down through the Institute. She made her way through the witch-lit nave and came out onto the broad front steps of the church, where she sank down on the top stair and wrapped her arms around herself, shivering in the unexpectedly cold breeze. It must have rained sometime during the day, for the steps were damp, and the black stone of the courtyard shone like a mirror. The moon was out, darting in between racing scuds of cloud, and the huge iron gate gleamed blackly in the fitful light. We are dust and shadows.\x{201c}I know what you\x{2019}re thinking.\x{201d} The voice that came from the doorway behind Tessa was soft enough that it could almost have been part of the wind that rattled the leaves on the tree branches.Tessa turned. Jem stood in the arch of the doorway, the white witchlight behind him lighting his hair so that it shone like metal. His face, though, was hidden in shadow. He held his cane in his right hand; the dragon\x{2019}s eyes gleamed watchfully at Tessa.\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t think you do.\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2019}re thinking, If they call this damp nastiness summer, what must winter be like? You\x{2019}d be surprised. Winter\x{2019}s actually much the same.\x{201d} He moved away from the door and sat down on the step beside Tessa, though not too close. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s spring that\x{2019}s really lovely.\x{201d}\x{201c}Is it?\x{201d} Tessa said, without much real interest.\x{201c}No. It\x{2019}s actually quite foggy and wet as well.\x{201d} He looked sideways at her. \x{201c}I know you said not to follow you. But I was rather hoping you just meant Will.\x{201d}\x{201c}I did.\x{201d} Tessa twisted round to look up at him. \x{201c}I shouldn\x{2019}t have shouted like that.\x{201d}\x{201c}No, you were quite right to say what you did,\x{201d} said Jem. \x{201c}We Shadowhunters have been what we are for so long, and are so insular, that we often forget to look at any situation from someone else\x{2019}s point of view. It is only ever about whether something is good for the Nephilim or bad for the Nephilim. Sometimes I think we forget to ask whether it is good or bad for the world.\x{201d}\x{201c}I never meant to hurt Charlotte.\x{201d}\x{201c}Charlotte is very sensitive about the way the Institute is run. As a woman, she must fight to be heard, and even then her decisions are second-guessed. You heard Benedict Lightwood at the Enclave meeting. She feels she has no freedom to make a mistake.\x{201d}\x{201c}Do any of us? Do any of you? Everything is life and death to you.\x{201d} Tessa took a long breath of the foggy air. It tasted of city, metal and ashes and horses and river water. \x{201c}I just\x{2014}I feel sometimes as if I can\x{2019}t bear it. Any of it. I wish I\x{2019}d never learned what I was. I wish Nate had stayed home and none of this had ever happened!\x{201d}\x{201c}Sometimes,\x{201d} Jem said, \x{201c}our lives can change so fast that the change outpaces our minds and hearts. It\x{2019}s those times, I think, when our lives have altered but we still long for the time before everything was altered\x{2014}that is when we feel the greatest pain. I can tell you, though, from experience, you grow accustomed to it. You learn to live your new life, and you can\x{2019}t imagine, or even really remember, how things were before.\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2019}re saying I\x{2019}ll get used to being a warlock, or whatever it is that I am.\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2019}ve always been what you are. That\x{2019}s not new. What you\x{2019}ll get used to is knowing it.\x{201d}Tessa took a deep breath, and let it out slowly. \x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t mean what I said upstairs,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t think the Nephilim are as dreadful as all that.\x{201d}\x{201c}I know you didn\x{2019}t mean it. If you had, you wouldn\x{2019}t be here. You\x{2019}d be at your brother\x{2019}s side, guarding him against our dire intentions.\x{201d}\x{201c}Will didn\x{2019}t really mean what he said, either, did he,\x{201d} Tessa said after a moment. \x{201c}He wouldn\x{2019}t hurt Nate.\x{201d}\x{201c}Ah.\x{201d} Jem looked out toward the gate, his gray eyes thoughtful. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re correct. But I\x{2019}m surprised you know it. I know it. But I have had years to understand Will. To know when he means what he says and when he doesn\x{2019}t.\x{201d}\x{201c}So you don\x{2019}t ever get angry at him?\x{201d}Jem laughed out loud. \x{201c}I would hardly say that. Sometimes I want to strangle him.\x{201d}\x{201c}How on earth do you prevent yourself?\x{201d}\x{201c}I go to my favorite place in London,\x{201d} said Jem, \x{201c}and I stand and look at the water, and I think about the continuity of life, and how the river rolls on, oblivious of the petty upsets in our lives.\x{201d}Tessa was fascinated. \x{201c}Does that work?\x{201d}\x{201c}Not really, but after that I think about how I could kill him while he slept if I really wanted to, and then I feel better.\x{201d}Tessa giggled. \x{201c}So where is it, then? This favorite place of yours?\x{201d}For a moment Jem looked pensive. Then he bounded to his feet, and held out the hand that did not clasp the cane. \x{201c}Come along, and I\x{2019}ll show you.\x{201d}\x{201c}Is it far?\x{201d}\x{201c}Not at all.\x{201d} He smiled. He had a lovely smile, Tessa thought\x{2014}and a contagious one. She couldn\x{2019}t help smiling back, for what felt like the first time in ages.Tessa let herself be pulled to her feet. Jem\x{2019}s hand was warm and strong, surprisingly reassuring. She glanced back at the Institute once, hesitated, and let him draw her through the iron gate and out into the shadows of the city.Unknown",

            "Clockwork Angel19B OADICEASeal\x{2019}d her mine from her first sweet breath. Mine, mine by a right, from birth till death Mine, mine\x{2014}our fathers have sworn. \x{2014}Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \x{201c}Maud\x{201d}As the doors of the Sanctuary closed behind them, Tessa looked around apprehensively. The room was darker than it had been when she had come here to meet Camille. There were no candles burning in the great candelabras, only flickering witchlight that emanated from sconces on the walls. The angel statue continued to weep its endless tears into the fountain. The air in the room was bone-chillingly cold, and she shivered.Sophie, having slipped the key back into her pocket, looked as nervous as Tessa felt. \x{201c}Here we are, then,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s awful cold in this place.\x{201d}\x{201c}Well, we won\x{2019}t be here long, I\x{2019}m sure,\x{201d} said Jessamine. She was still holding Nate\x{2019}s knife, which glittered in her hand. \x{201c}Someone will come back to rescue us. Will, or Charlotte\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}And find the Institute full of clockwork monsters,\x{201d} Tessa reminded her. \x{201c}And Mortmain.\x{201d} She shuddered. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not sure it\x{2019}ll be quite so simple as you make it out to be.\x{201d}Jessamine looked at Tessa with cold dark eyes. \x{201c}Well, you needn\x{2019}t sound as if it\x{2019}s my fault. If it weren\x{2019}t for you, we wouldn\x{2019}t be in this mess.\x{201d}Sophie had moved to stand among the massive pillars, and was looking very small. Her voice echoed off the stone walls. \x{201c}That\x{2019}s not very kind, miss.\x{201d}Jessamine perched herself on the edge of the fountain, then rose to her feet again, frowning. She brushed at the back of her dress, now stained with damp, in an exasperated manner. \x{201c}Perhaps not, but it\x{2019}s true. The only reason the Magister is here is because of Tessa.\x{201d}\x{201c}I told Charlotte all this was my fault.\x{201d} Tessa spoke quietly. \x{201c}I told her to send me away. She wouldn\x{2019}t.\x{201d}Jessamine tossed her head. \x{201c}Charlotte\x{2019}s softhearted, and so is Henry. And Will\x{2014}Will thinks he\x{2019}s Galahad. Wants to save everyone. Jem, too. None of them are practical.\x{201d}\x{201c}I suppose,\x{201d} Tessa said, \x{201c}if it had been your decision to make \x{2026}\x{201d}\x{201c}You\x{2019}d have been out the door with nothing but the key of the street to your name,\x{201d} Jessamine said, and sniffed. Seeing the way Sophie was looking at her, she added, \x{201c}Oh, really! Don\x{2019}t be such a mush-mouth, Sophie. Agatha and Thomas would still be alive if I\x{2019}d been in charge, wouldn\x{2019}t they?\x{201d}Sophie went pale, her scar standing out along her cheek like the mark of a slap. \x{201c}Thomas is dead?\x{201d}Jessamine looked as if she knew she\x{2019}d made a mistake. \x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t mean that.\x{201d}Tessa looked at her, hard. \x{201c}What happened, Jessamine? We saw you injured\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}And precious little any of you did about it either,\x{201d} Jessamine said, and sat down with a flounce on the fountain wall, apparently forgetting to worry about the state of her dress. \x{201c}I was unconscious \x{2026} and when I awoke, I saw that all of you had gone but Thomas. Mortmain was gone too, but those creatures were still there. One of them began to come after me, and I looked for my parasol, but it had been trampled to shreds. Thomas was surrounded by those creatures. I went toward him, but he told me to run, so \x{2026} I ran.\x{201d} She tilted her chin up defiantly.Sophie\x{2019}s eyes flashed. \x{201c}You left him there? Alone?\x{201d}Jessamine set the knife down on the wall with an angry clatter. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m a lady, Sophie. It is expected that a man sacrifice himself for a lady\x{2019}s safety.\x{201d}\x{201c}That\x{2019}s rubbish!\x{201d} Sophie\x{2019}s hands were tight little fists at her sides. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re a Shadowhunter! And Thomas is just a mundane! You could have helped him. You just wouldn\x{2019}t\x{2014}because you\x{2019}re selfish! And\x{2014}and awful!\x{201d}Jessamine gaped at Sophie, her mouth wide open. \x{201c}How dare you speak to me like\x{2014}\x{201d}She broke off as the door of the Sanctuary resounded with the noise of the heavy knocker falling. It sounded again, and then a familiar voice, raised, called out to them, \x{201c}Tessa! Sophie! It\x{2019}s Will.\x{201d}\x{201c}Oh, thank God,\x{201d} Jessamine said\x{2014}clearly just as relieved to be free of her conversation with Sophie as she was to be rescued\x{2014}and hurried toward the door. \x{201c}Will! It\x{2019}s Jessamine. I\x{2019}m in here too!\x{201d}\x{201c}And you\x{2019}re all three all right?\x{201d} Will sounded anxious in a way that tightened Tessa\x{2019}s chest. \x{201c}What happened? We raced here from Highgate. I saw the door of the Institute open. How in the Angel\x{2019}s name did Mortmain get in?\x{201d}\x{201c}He evaded the wards somehow,\x{201d} Jessamine said bitterly, reaching for the door handle. \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve no idea how.\x{201d}\x{201c}It hardly matters now. He\x{2019}s dead. The clockwork creatures are destroyed.\x{201d}Will\x{2019}s tone was reassuring\x{2014}so why, Tessa thought, did she not feel reassured? She turned to look at Sophie, who was staring at the door, a sharp vertical frown line between her eyes, her lips moving very slightly as if she were whispering something under her breath. Sophie had the Sight, Tessa remembered\x{2014}Charlotte had said so. Tessa\x{2019}s sense of unease rose and crested like a wave.\x{201c}Jessamine,\x{201d} she called. \x{201c}Jessamine, don\x{2019}t open the door\x{2014}\x{201d}But it was too late. The door had swung wide. And there on the threshold stood Mortmain, flanked by clockwork monsters.Thank the Angel for glamours, Will thought. The sight of a boy riding bareback on a charging black horse down Farringdon Road would normally be enough to raise eyebrows even in a metropolis as jaded as London. But as Will went by\x{2014}the horse kicking up great puffs of London dust as it reared and snorted its way through the streets\x{2014}no one turned a hair or batted the lash of an eye. Yet even as they seemed not to see him, they found reasons to move out of his way\x{2014}a dropped pair of eyeglasses, a step to the side to avoid a puddle in the road\x{2014}and avoid being trampled.It was almost five miles from Highgate to the Institute; it had taken them three-quarters of an hour to cover the distance in the carriage. It took Will and Balios only twenty minutes to make the return trip, though the horse was panting and lathered with sweat by the time Will pounded through the Institute gates and drew up in front of the steps.His heart sank immediately. The doors were open. Wide open, as if inviting in the night. It was strictly against Covenant Law to leave the doors of an Institute standing ajar. He had been correct; something was terribly wrong.He slid from the horse\x{2019}s back, boots clattering loudly against the cobblestones. He looked for a way to secure the animal, but as he\x{2019}d cut its harness, there was none, and besides, Balios looked inclined to bite him. He shrugged and made for the steps.Jessamine gasped and leaped back as Mortmain stepped into the room. Sophie screamed and ducked behind a pillar. Tessa was too shocked to move. The four automatons, two on either side of Mortmain, stared straight ahead with their shining faces like metal masks.Behind Mortmain was Nate. A makeshift bandage, stained with blood, was tied around his head. The bottom of his shirt\x{2014}Jem\x{2019}s shirt\x{2014}had a ragged strip torn from it. His baleful gaze fell on Jessamine.\x{201c}You stupid whore,\x{201d} he snarled, and started forward.\x{201c}Nathaniel.\x{201d} Mortmain\x{2019}s voice cracked like a whip; Nate froze. \x{201c}This is not an arena in which to enact your petty revenges. There is one more thing I need from you; you know what it is. Retrieve it for me.\x{201d}Nate hesitated. He was looking at Jessamine like a cat with its gaze fixed on a mouse.\x{201c}Nathaniel. To the weapons room. Now.\x{201d}Nate dragged his gaze from Jessie. For a moment he looked at Tessa, the rage in his expression softening into a sneer. Then he turned on his heel and stalked from the room; two of the clockwork creatures peeled themselves from Mortmain\x{2019}s side and followed him.The door closed behind him, and Mortmain smiled pleasantly. \x{201c}The two of you,\x{201d} he said, looking from Jessamine to Sophie, \x{201c}get out.\x{201d}\x{201c}No.\x{201d} The voice was Sophie\x{2019}s, small but stubborn, though to Tessa\x{2019}s surprise, Jessamine showed no inclination to leave either. \x{201c}Not without Tessa.\x{201d}Mortmain shrugged. \x{201c}Very well.\x{201d} He turned to the clockwork creatures. \x{201c}The two girls,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}The Shadowhunter and the servant. Kill them both.\x{201d}He snapped his fingers and the clockwork creatures sprang forward. They had the grotesque speed of skittering rats. Jessamine turned to run, but she had gone only a few steps when one of them seized her, lifting her off the ground. Sophie darted among the pillars like Snow White fleeing into the woods, but it did her little good. The second creature caught up to her swiftly and bore her to the ground as she screamed. In contrast Jessamine was utterly silent; the creature holding her had one metal hand clamped across her mouth and the other around her waist, fingers digging in cruelly. Her feet kicked uselessly in the air like the feet of a criminal dangling at the end of a hangman\x{2019}s rope.Tessa heard her own voice as it emerged from her throat as if it were a stranger\x{2019}s. \x{201c}Stop it. Please, please, stop it!\x{201d}Sophie had broken away from the creature holding her and was scrambling across the floor on her hands and knees. Reaching out, it caught her by the ankle and jerked her backward across the floor, her apron tearing as she sobbed.\x{201c}Please,\x{201d} Tessa said again, fixing her eyes on Mortmain.\x{201c}You can stop it, Miss Gray,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Promise me you won\x{2019}t try to run.\x{201d} His eyes burned as he looked at her. \x{201c}Then I\x{2019}ll let them go.\x{201d}Jessamine\x{2019}s eyes, visible above the metal arm clamping her mouth, pleaded with Tessa. The other creature was on its feet, holding Sophie, who dangled limply in its grip.\x{201c}I\x{2019}ll stay,\x{201d} Tessa said. \x{201c}You have my word. Of course I will. Just let them go.\x{201d}There was a long pause. Then, \x{201c}You heard her,\x{201d} Mortmain said to his mechanical monsters. \x{201c}Take the girls out of this room. Bring them downstairs. Don\x{2019}t harm them.\x{201d} He smiled then, a thin, crafty smile. \x{201c}Leave Miss Gray alone with me.\x{201d}Even before he passed through the front doors, Will felt it\x{2014}the jangling sense that something dreadful was happening here. The first time he\x{2019}d ever felt this sensation, he\x{2019}d been twelve years old, holding that blasted box\x{2014}but he\x{2019}d never imagined feeling it in the fastness of the Institute.He saw Agatha\x{2019}s body first, the moment he stepped over the threshold. She lay on her back, her glassy eyes staring up at the ceiling, the front of her plain gray dress soaked with blood. A wave of almost overwhelming rage washed over Will, leaving him light-headed. Biting his lip hard, he bent to close her eyes before he rose and looked around.The signs of a melee were everywhere\x{2014}torn scraps of metal, bent and broken gears, splashes of blood mixing with pools of oil. As Will moved toward the stairs, his foot came down on the shredded remains of Jessamine\x{2019}s parasol. He gritted his teeth and moved on to the staircase.And there, slumped across the lowest steps, lay Thomas, eyes closed, motionless in a widening pool of scarlet. A sword rested on the ground beside him, a little ways away from his hand; its edge was chipped and dented as if he had been using it to hack apart rocks. A great jagged piece of metal protruded from his chest. It looked a little like the torn blade of a saw, Will thought as he crouched down by Thomas\x{2019}s side, or like a sharp bit of some larger metal contraption.There was a dry burning in the back of Will\x{2019}s throat. His mouth tasted of metal and rage. He rarely grieved during a battle; he saved his emotions for afterward\x{2014}those he had not already learned to bury so deeply that he barely felt them at all. He had been burying them since he was twelve years old. His chest knotted with pain now, but his voice was steady when he spoke. \x{201c}Hail and farewell, Thomas,\x{201d} he said, reaching to close the other boy\x{2019}s eyes. \x{201c}Ave\x{2014}\x{201d}A hand flew up and gripped his wrist. Will stared down, dumbfounded, as Thomas\x{2019}s glassy eyes slid toward him, pale brown under the whitish film of death. \x{201c}Not,\x{201d} he said, with a clear effort to get the words out, \x{201c}a Shadowhunter.\x{201d}\x{201c}You defended the Institute,\x{201d} Will said. \x{201c}You did as well as any of us would have done.\x{201d}\x{201c}No.\x{201d} Thomas closed his eyes, as if exhausted. His chest rose, barely; his shirt was soaked almost black with blood. \x{201c}You\x{2019}d\x{2019}ve fought \x{2019}em off, Master Will. You know you would.\x{201d}\x{201c}Thomas,\x{201d} Will whispered. He wanted to say, Be quiet, and you\x{2019}ll be all right when the others get here. But Thomas manifestly would not be all right. He was human; no healing rune could help him. Will wished that Jem were here, instead of himself. Jem was the one you wanted with you when you were dying. Jem could make anyone feel that things were going to be all right, whereas Will privately suspected that there were few situations that his presence did not make worse.\x{201c}She\x{2019}s alive,\x{201d} Thomas said, not opening his eyes.\x{201c}What?\x{201d} Will was caught off guard.\x{201c}The one you come back for. Her. Tessa. She\x{2019}s with Sophie.\x{201d} Thomas spoke as if it were a fact obvious to anyone that Will would have come back for Tessa\x{2019}s sake. He coughed, and a great mass of blood poured out of his mouth and down his chin. He didn\x{2019}t seem to notice. \x{201c}Take care of Sophie, Will. Sophie is\x{2014}\x{201d}But Will never found out what Sophie was, because Thomas\x{2019}s grip went suddenly slack, and his hand fell away and struck the stone floor with an ugly thump. Will drew back. He had seen death enough times, and knew when it had come. There was no need to close Thomas\x{2019}s eyes; they were closed already. \x{201c}Sleep, then,\x{201d} he said, not quite knowing where the words came from, \x{201c}good and faithful servant of the Nephilim. And thank you.\x{201d}It wasn\x{2019}t enough, not nearly enough, but it was all there was. Will scrambled to his feet and dashed up the staircase.*\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}*\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}*The doors had closed behind the clockwork creatures; the Sanctuary was very silent. Tessa could hear the water splashing in the fountain behind her.Mortmain stood regarding her calmly. He still wasn\x{2019}t frightening to look at, Tessa thought. A small, ordinary man, with dark hair going gray at his temples, and those odd light eyes. \x{201c}Miss Gray,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}I had hoped our first time alone together would be a more pleasant experience for us both.\x{201d}Tessa\x{2019}s eyes burned. She said, \x{201c}What are you? A warlock?\x{201d}His smile was swift, and without feeling. \x{201c}Merely a human being, Miss Gray.\x{201d}\x{201c}But you did magic,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}You spoke in Will\x{2019}s voice\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Anyone can learn to imitate voices, with the proper training,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}A simple trick, like sleight of hand. No one ever expects them. Certainly not Shadowhunters. They believe humans are good at nothing, as well as being good for nothing.\x{201d}\x{201c}No,\x{201d} Tessa whispered. \x{201c}They don\x{2019}t think that.\x{201d}His mouth twisted. \x{201c}How quickly you have grown to love them, your natural enemies. We will soon train you out of that.\x{201d} He moved forward, and Tessa shrank back. \x{201c}I will not hurt you,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}I merely want to show you something.\x{201d} He reached into the pocket of his coat and drew out a gold watch, very fine-looking, on a thick gold chain.Is he wondering what time it is? The mad urge to giggle rose up in the back of Tessa\x{2019}s throat. She forced it down.He held the watch out to her. \x{201c}Miss Gray,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}please take this.\x{201d}She stared at him. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t want it.\x{201d}He moved toward her again. Tessa retreated until the back of her skirts brushed the low wall of the fountain. \x{201c}Take the watch, Miss Gray.\x{201d}Tessa shook her head.\x{201c}Take it,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Or I will recall my clockwork servants and have them crush the throats of your two friends until they are dead. I need only go to the door and call to them. It is your choice.\x{201d}Bile rose in the back of Tessa\x{2019}s throat. She stared at the watch he held out to her, dangling on its gold chain. It was clearly unwound. The hands had long ago stopped spinning, the time seemingly frozen at <<midnight|13>>. The initials J. T. S. were carved on the back in elegant script.\x{201c}Why?\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}Why do you want me to take it?\x{201d}\x{201c}Because I want you to Change,\x{201d} Mortmain said.Tessa\x{2019}s head jerked up. She stared at him incredulously. \x{201c}What?\x{201d}\x{201c}This watch used to belong to someone,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Someone I very much want to meet again.\x{201d} His voice was even, but there was a sort of undercurrent beneath it, an eager hunger that terrified Tessa more than any rage might have. \x{201c}I know the Dark Sisters taught you. I know you know your power. You are the only one in the world who can do what you do. I know this because I made you.\x{201d}\x{201c}You made me?\x{201d} Tessa stared. \x{201c}You\x{2019}re not saying\x{2014}you can\x{2019}t be my father\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}Your father?\x{201d} Mortmain laughed shortly. \x{201c}I am a human, not a Downworlder. There is no demon in me, nor do I consort with demons. There is no blood shared between the two of us, Miss Gray. And yet if it were not for me, you would not exist.\x{201d}\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t understand,\x{201d} Tessa whispered.\x{201c}You don\x{2019}t need to understand.\x{201d} Mortmain\x{2019}s temper was visibly fraying. \x{201c}You need to do as I tell you. And I am telling you to Change. Now.\x{201d}It was like standing in front of the Dark Sisters again, frightened and alert, her heart pounding, being told to access a part of herself that terrified her. Being told to lose herself in that darkness, that nothingness between self and other. Perhaps it would be easy to do as he told her\x{2014}to reach out and take the watch as commanded, to abandon herself in someone else\x{2019}s skin as she had done before, with no will or choice of her own.She looked down, away from Mortmain\x{2019}s searing gaze, and saw something glittering on the fountain wall just behind her. A splash of water, she thought for a moment\x{2014}but no. It was something else. She spoke then, almost without meaning to.\x{201c}No,\x{201d} she said.Mortmain\x{2019}s eyes narrowed. \x{201c}What was that?\x{201d}\x{201c}I said no.\x{201d} Tessa felt as if she were outside herself somehow, watching herself face down Mortmain as if she were watching a stranger. \x{201c}I won\x{2019}t do it. Not unless you tell me what you mean when you say you made me. Why am I like this? Why is it that you need my power so badly? What do you plan to force me to do for you? You are doing more than just building an army of monsters. I can see that. I\x{2019}m not a fool like my brother.\x{201d}Mortmain slid the watch back into his pocket. His face was an ugly mask of rage. \x{201c}No,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}You are not a fool like your brother. He is a fool and a coward. You are a fool who has some courage. Though it will do you little good. And it is your friends who will suffer for it. While you watch.\x{201d} He turned on his heel then and strode toward the door.Tessa bent down and seized up the object that had glittered behind her. It was the knife Jessamine had put there, the blade gleaming in the Sanctuary witchlight. \x{201c}Stop,\x{201d} she cried. \x{201c}Mr. Mortmain. Stop.\x{201d}He turned then, and saw her holding the knife. A look of disgusted amusement spread across his face. \x{201c}Really, Miss Gray,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}Do you honestly think you can harm me with that? Did you think I came entirely unarmed?\x{201d} He moved his jacket aside slightly, and she saw the butt of a pistol, gleaming at his belt.\x{201c}No,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}No, I don\x{2019}t think I can hurt you.\x{201d} She turned the knife around then, so that the hilt was away from her, the blade pointing directly at her own chest. \x{201c}But if you take one more step toward that door, I promise you, I\x{2019}ll put this knife through my heart.\x{201d}Repairing the mess Will had made of the carriage harnesses took Jem longer than he would have liked, and the moon was worryingly high in the sky by the time he rattled through the gates of the Institute and pulled Xanthos up at the foot of the steps.Balios, untethered, was standing by the newel post at the foot of the stairs, looking exhausted. Will must have ridden like the devil, Jem thought, but at least he had arrived safely. It was a small bit of reassurance, considering that the doors of the Institute stood wide, sending a dart of horror through him. It was a sight that seemed so wrong that it was like looking at a face missing eyes or a sky with no stars. It was something that simply should not be.Jem raised his voice. \x{201c}Will?\x{201d} he called. \x{201c}Will, can you hear me?\x{201d} When there was no answer, he leaped down from the driver\x{2019}s seat of the carriage and reached up to pull his jade-headed cane down after him. He held it lightly, balancing the weight. His wrists had begun to ache, which concerned him. Usually withdrawal from the demon powder began as pain in his joints, a dull ache that spread slowly until his whole body burned like fire. But he could not afford that pain now. There was Will to think about, and Tessa. He could not rid himself of the image of her on the steps, looking down at him as he spoke the ancient words. She had looked so worried, and the thought that she might have been worried about him had given him an unexpected pleasure.He turned to start up the steps, and paused. Someone was already coming down them. More than one person\x{2014}a crowd. They were backlit by the light of the Institute, and for a moment he blinked at them, seeing only silhouettes. A few seemed strangely misshapen.\x{201c}Jem!\x{201d} The voice was high, desperate. Familiar.Jessamine.Galvanized, Jem darted up the stairs, and then paused. In front of him stood Nathaniel Gray, his clothes torn and spotted with blood. A makeshift bandage was wound around his head and was soaked with blood by his right temple. His expression was grim.On either side of him moved clockwork automatons, like obedient servants. One flanked his right side, one his left. Behind were two more. One held a struggling Jessamine; the other a limp, half-insensible Sophie.\x{201c}Jem!\x{201d} Jessamine shrieked. \x{201c}Nate\x{2019}s a liar. He was helping Mortmain all this time\x{2014}Mortmain\x{2019}s the Magister, not de Quincey\x{2014}\x{201d}Nathaniel whirled. \x{201c}Silence her,\x{201d} he barked at the clockwork creature behind him. Its metal arms tightened around Jessamine, who choked and fell silent, her face white with pain. Her eyes darted toward the automaton on Nathaniel\x{2019}s right. Following her gaze, Jem saw that the creature held the familiar golden square of the Pyxis in its hands.At the look on his face, Nate smiled. \x{201c}None but a Shadowhunter can touch it,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}No living creature, that is. But an automaton is not alive.\x{201d}\x{201c}That is what all this was about?\x{201d} Jem demanded, astounded. \x{201c}The Pyxis? What possible use could it be to you?\x{201d}\x{201c}My master wants demon energies, and demon energies he shall have,\x{201d} said Nate pompously. \x{201c}Nor will he forget that I am the one who provided them for him.\x{201d}Jem shook his head. \x{201c}And what will he give you then? What did he give you to betray your sister? Thirty pieces of silver?\x{201d}Nate\x{2019}s face twisted, and for a moment Jem thought he could see through the blandly handsome mask to what was really underneath\x{2014}something malignant and repellent that made Jem want to turn away and retch. \x{201c}That thing,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}is not my sister.\x{201d}\x{201c}It is hard to believe, isn\x{2019}t it,\x{201d} said Jem, making no effort to hide his loathing, \x{201c}that you and Tessa share anything at all, even a single drop of blood. She is so much finer than you.\x{201d}Nathaniel\x{2019}s eyes narrowed. \x{201c}She is not my concern. She belongs to Mortmain.\x{201d}\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t know what Mortmain has promised you,\x{201d} Jem said, \x{201c}but I can promise you that if you hurt Jessamine or Sophie\x{2014}and if you take the Pyxis from these premises\x{2014}the Clave will hunt you. And find you. And kill you.\x{201d}Nathaniel shook his head slowly. \x{201c}You don\x{2019}t understand,\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}None of the Nephilim understand. The most you can offer is to let me live. But the Magister can promise me that I won\x{2019}t ever die.\x{201d} He turned to the clockwork creature on his left, the one not holding the Pyxis. \x{201c}Kill him,\x{201d} he said.The automaton sprang toward Jem. It was faster by far than the creatures Jem had faced on Blackfriars Bridge. He barely had time to flip the catch that released the blade at the end of his cane and raise it, before the thing was on him. The creature squealed like a braking train when Jem drove the blade directly into its chest and sawed it from side to side, tearing the metal wide open. The creature spun away, spraying a Catherine wheel of red sparks.Nate, caught by the spray of fire, yelled and jumped back, beating at the sparks burning holes into his clothes. Jem took the opportunity to leap up two of the steps and slam Nate across the back with the flat of his blade, knocking him to his knees. Nate twisted around to look for his clockwork protector, but it was staggering from side to side across the steps, sparks fountaining from its chest; it seemed evident that Jem had severed one of its central mechanisms. The automaton holding the Pyxis stood stock-still; clearly Nate was not its first priority.\x{201c}Drop them!\x{201d} Nate cried to the clockwork creatures holding Sophie and Jessamine. \x{201c}Kill the Shadowhunter! Kill him, do you hear?\x{201d}Jessamine and Sophie, released, tumbled to the ground, both gasping but clearly still alive. Jem\x{2019}s relief was short-lived, though, as the second pair of automatons lurched toward him, moving with incredible speed. He slashed out at one with his cane. It leaped back, out of range, and the other raised a hand\x{2014}not a hand, really, more a square block of metal, its side edged with ragged teeth like a saw\x{2014}A yell came from behind Jem, and Henry charged past him, wielding a massive broadsword. He swung it hard, slashing through the automaton\x{2019}s raised arm and sending its hand flying. It skidded across the cobblestones, sparking and hissing, before bursting into flames.\x{201c}Jem!\x{201d} It was Charlotte\x{2019}s voice, raised in warning. Jem spun, and saw the other automaton reaching for him from behind. He drove his blade into the creature\x{2019}s throat, sawing at the copper tubes inside, while Charlotte slashed at its knees with her whip. With a high whine, it collapsed to the ground, legs severed. Charlotte, her pale face set, brought the whip down again, while Jem turned to see that Henry, his ginger hair pasted to his forehead with sweat, was lowering his broadsword. The automaton he had attacked was now a heap of scrap metal on the ground.In fact, bits of clockwork were scattered across the courtyard, some of it still burning, like a field of fallen stars. Jessamine and Sophie were clinging to each other; Jessamine supporting the other girl, whose throat was necklaced with dark bruises. Jessamine met Jem\x{2019}s eyes across the steps. He thought it might have been the first time she\x{2019}d really ever looked like she was glad to see him.\x{201c}He\x{2019}s gone,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}Nathaniel. He vanished with that creature\x{2014}and the Pyxis.\x{201d}\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t understand.\x{201d} Charlotte\x{2019}s bloodied face was a mask of shock. \x{201c}Tessa\x{2019}s brother \x{2026}\x{201d}\x{201c}Everything he said to us was a lie,\x{201d} said Jessamine. \x{201c}The whole business with sending you off after the vampires was a diversion.\x{201d}\x{201c}Dear God,\x{201d} said Charlotte. \x{201c}So de Quincey wasn\x{2019}t lying\x{2014}\x{201d} She shook her head, as if to clear it of cobwebs. \x{201c}When we reached his house in Chelsea, we found him there with just a few vampires, no more than six or seven\x{2014}certainly not the hundred Nathaniel had warned about, and no clockwork creatures that anyone could find. Benedict slew de Quincey, but not before the vampire laughed at us for calling him the Magister\x{2014}said we had let Mortmain make fools of us. Mortmain. And I\x{2019}d thought he was just\x{2014}just a mundane.\x{201d}Henry sank down on the top step, his broad sword clanking. \x{201c}This is a disaster.\x{201d}\x{201c}Will,\x{201d} Charlotte said dazedly, as if in a dream. \x{201c}And Tessa. Where are they?\x{201d}\x{201c}Tessa\x{2019}s in the Sanctuary. With Mortmain. Will\x{2014}\x{201d} Jessamine shook her head. \x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t realize he was here.\x{201d}\x{201c}He\x{2019}s inside,\x{201d} Jem said, raising his gaze to the Institute. He remembered his poison-racked dream\x{2014}the Institute in flames, a haze of smoke over London, and great clockwork creatures striding to and fro among the buildings like monstrous spiders. \x{201c}He would have gone after Tessa.\x{201d}Mortmain\x{2019}s face had drained of blood. \x{201c}What are you doing?\x{201d} he demanded, striding toward her.Tessa set the tip of the blade to her chest and pushed. The pain was sharp, sudden. Blood bloomed on the bosom of her dress. \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t come any closer.\x{201d}Mortmain stopped, his face contorted with fury. \x{201c}What makes you think I care if you live or die, Miss Gray?\x{201d}\x{201c}As you said, you made me,\x{201d} said Tessa. \x{201c}For whatever reason, you desired that I exist. You valued me enough that you would not have wanted the Dark Sisters to harm me in any permanent way. Somehow, I am significant to you. Oh, not my self, of course. My power. That is what matters to you.\x{201d} She could feel blood, warm and wet, trickling down her skin, but the pain was nothing compared to her satisfaction at seeing the look of fear on Mortmain\x{2019}s face.He spoke through gritted teeth. \x{201c}What is it you want from me?\x{201d}\x{201c}No. What is it you want from me? Tell me. Tell me why you created me. Tell me who my true parents are. Was my mother really my mother? My father, my father?\x{201d}Mortmain\x{2019}s smile was twisted. \x{201c}You are asking the wrong questions, Miss Gray.\x{201d}\x{201c}Why am I \x{2026} what I am, and Nate is only human? Why is he not like me?\x{201d}\x{201c}Nathaniel is only your half brother. He is nothing more than a human being, and not a very good example of that. Do not mourn that you are not more like him.\x{201d}\x{201c}Then \x{2026}\x{201d} Tessa paused. Her heart was racing. \x{201c}My mother could not have been a demon,\x{201d} she said quietly. \x{201c}Or anything supernatural, because Aunt Harriet was her sister, and she was only human. So it must have been my father. My father was a demon?\x{201d}Mortmain grinned, a sudden ugly grin. \x{201c}Put down the knife and I will give you your answers. Perhaps we can even summon up the thing that fathered you, if you are so desperate to meet him\x{2014}or should I say \x{2018}it\x{2019}?\x{201d}\x{201c}Then I am a warlock,\x{201d} Tessa said. Her throat felt tight. \x{201c}That is what you are saying.\x{201d}Mortmain\x{2019}s pale eyes were full of scorn. \x{201c}If you insist,\x{201d} he said, \x{201c}I suppose that is the best word for what you are.\x{201d}Tessa heard Magnus Bane\x{2019}s clear voice in her head: Oh, you\x{2019}re a warlock. Depend on it. And yet\x{2014}\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t believe any of this,\x{201d} Tessa said. \x{201c}My mother, she would never have\x{2014}not with a demon.\x{201d}\x{201c}She had no idea.\x{201d} Mortmain sounded almost pitying. \x{201c}No idea that she was being unfaithful to your father.\x{201d}Tessa\x{2019}s stomach lurched. This was nothing she hadn\x{2019}t thought might be possible, nothing she hadn\x{2019}t wondered about. Still, to hear it spoken aloud was something else. \x{201c}If the man I thought was my father, was not my father, and my true father was a demon,\x{201d} she said, \x{201c}then why am I not marked like a warlock is marked?\x{201d}Mortmain\x{2019}s eyes sparkled with malevolence. \x{201c}Indeed, why are you not? Perhaps because your mother had no idea what she was, any more than you do.\x{201d}\x{201c}What do you mean? My mother was human!\x{201d}Mortmain shook his head. \x{201c}Miss Gray, you continue to ask the wrong questions. What you must understand is that much was planned so that you would someday come to be. The planning began even before me\x{2014}and I carried it forward, knowing I was overseeing the creation of something unique in the world. Something unique that would belong to me. I knew that I would one day marry you, and you would be mine forever.\x{201d}Tessa looked at him in horror. \x{201c}But why? You don\x{2019}t love me. You don\x{2019}t know me. You didn\x{2019}t even know what I looked like! I could have been hideous!\x{201d}\x{201c}It would not have mattered. You can appear as hideous or as beautiful as you like. The face you wear now is only one of a thousand possible faces. When will you learn that there is no real Tessa Gray?\x{201d}\x{201c}Get out,\x{201d} Tessa said.Mortmain looked at her with his pale eyes. \x{201c}What did you say to me?\x{201d}\x{201c}Get out. Leave the Institute. Take your monsters with you. Or I will stab myself in the heart.\x{201d}For a moment he hesitated, his hands clenching and unclenching at his sides. This must have been what he was like when forced to make a lightning-swift business decision\x{2014}to buy or to sell? To invest or to expand? He was a man used to sizing up the situation in an instant, Tessa thought. And she was only a girl. What chance did she have to outmaneuver him?Slowly he shook his head. \x{201c}I don\x{2019}t believe you\x{2019}ll do it. You may be a warlock, but you\x{2019}re still a young girl. A delicate female.\x{201d} He took a step toward her. \x{201c}Violence is not in your nature.\x{201d}Tessa gripped the handle of the knife tightly. She could feel everything\x{2014}the hard slick surface under her fingers, the pain where it pierced her skin, the beat of her own heart. \x{201c}Don\x{2019}t come a step closer,\x{201d} she said in a shaking voice, \x{201c}or I\x{2019}ll do it. I\x{2019}ll drive the knife in.\x{201d}The tremble in her voice seemed to give him conviction; his jaw firmed, and he moved toward her with a confident stride. \x{201c}No, you won\x{2019}t.\x{201d}Tessa heard Will\x{2019}s voice in her head. She took poison rather than let herself be captured by the Romans. She was braver than any man.\x{201c}Yes,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}I will.\x{201d}Something in her face must have changed, for the confidence went from his expression and he lunged toward her, his arrogance gone, reaching desperately for the knife. Tessa spun away from Mortmain, turning to face the fountain. The last thing she saw was the silvery water splashing high above her as she drove the knife toward her chest.Will was breathless as he approached the doors of the Sanctuary. He had fought two of the clockwork automatons in the stairwell and had thought he was done for, until the first one\x{2014}having been run through several times with Thomas\x{2019}s sword\x{2014}began to malfunction and pushed the second creature out a window before collapsing and crashing down the stairs in a whirlwind of crumpling metal and shooting sparks.Will had cuts on his hands and arms from the creatures\x{2019} jagged metal hides, but he had not slowed down for an iratze. He drew out his stele as he ran, and hit the Sanctuary doors at a dead run. He slashed the stele across the doors\x{2019} surface, creating the fastest Open rune of his life.The doors\x{2019} lock slid back. Will took a split second of time to switch his stele for one of the seraph blades on his belt. \x{201c}Jerahmeel,\x{201d} he whispered, and as the blade blazed up with white fire, he kicked the Sanctuary doors open.And froze in horror. Tessa lay crumpled by the fountain, whose water was stained with red. The front of her blue and white dress was a sheet of scarlet, and blood spread from beneath her body in a widening pool. A knife lay by her limp right hand, its hilt smeared with blood. Her eyes were closed.Mortmain knelt by her side, his hand on her shoulder. He glanced up as the doors burst open, and then staggered to his feet, backing away from Tessa\x{2019}s body. His hands were red with blood, and his shirt and jacket were stained with it.\x{201c}I \x{2026} ,\x{201d} he began.\x{201c}You killed her,\x{201d} Will said. His voice sounded stupid to his own ears, and very far away. He saw again in his mind\x{2019}s eye the library of the house he had lived in with his family as a child. His own hands on the box, curious fingers unclasping the catch that held it closed. The library filled with the sound of screaming. The road to London, silver in the moonlight. The words that had gone through his head, over and over, as he\x{2019}d walked away from everything he had ever known, forever. I have lost everything. Lost everything.Everything.\x{201c}No.\x{201d} Mortmain shook his head. He was fiddling with something\x{2014}a ring on his right hand, made of silver. \x{201c}I didn\x{2019}t touch her. She did this to herself.\x{201d}\x{201c}You lie.\x{201d} Will moved forward, the shape of the seraph blade beneath his fingers comforting and familiar in a world that seemed to shift and change around him like the landscape of a dream. \x{201c}Do you know what happens when I drive one of these into human flesh?\x{201d} he rasped, raising Jerahmeel. \x{201c}It will burn as it cuts you. You will die in agony, burning from the inside out.\x{201d}\x{201c}You think you grieve her loss, Will Herondale?\x{201d} Mortmain\x{2019}s voice was full of torment. \x{201c}Your grief is nothing to mine. Years of work\x{2014}dreams\x{2014}more than you could ever imagine, wasted.\x{201d}\x{201c}Then be comforted, for your pain will be of short duration,\x{201d} said Will, and he lunged forward, blade outstretched. He felt it graze the cloth of Mortmain\x{2019}s jacket\x{2014}and meet no further resistance. He stumbled forward, righted himself, and stared. Something clinked to the floor at his feet, a brass button. His blade must have severed it from Mortmain\x{2019}s jacket. It winked at him from the ground like a mocking eye.Shocked, Will dropped the seraph blade. Jerahmeel fell to the floor, still burning. Mortmain was gone\x{2014}entirely gone. He had vanished like a warlock might vanish, a warlock who had trained in the practice of magic for years. For a human, even a human with occult knowledge, to accomplish such a thing \x{2026}But that didn\x{2019}t matter; not now. Will could think of only one thing. Tessa. Half in dread, half in hope, he crossed the room to where she lay. The fountain made its wretched soothing noises as he knelt down and lifted her into his arms.He had held her like this only once before, in the attic, the night they had burned de Quincey\x{2019}s town house. The memory of it had come to him, unbidden, often enough since. Now it was torture. Her dress was soaked in blood; so was her hair, and her face was streaked with it. Will had seen enough injuries to know that no one could lose blood like this and live.\x{201c}Tessa,\x{201d} he whispered. He crushed her against him; it didn\x{2019}t matter now what he did. He buried his face in the crook of her neck, where her throat met her shoulder. Her hair, already beginning to stiffen with blood, scratched his cheek. He could feel the beat of her pulse through her skin.He froze. Her pulse? His heart leaped; he drew away, meaning to lower her to the ground, and found her looking at him with wide gray eyes.\x{201c}Will,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}Is it really you, Will?\x{201d}Relief crashed over him first, followed instantly by a boiling terror. To have Thomas die before his eyes, and now this, too. Or perhaps she could be saved? Though not with Marks. How were Downworlders healed? It was knowledge only the Silent Brothers had. \x{201c}Bandages,\x{201d} Will said, half to himself. \x{201c}I must get bandages.\x{201d}He began to loosen his grip on her, but Tessa caught at his wrist with her hand. \x{201c}Will, you must be careful. Mortmain\x{2014}he\x{2019}s the Magister. He was here\x{2014}\x{201d}Will felt as if he were choking. \x{201c}Hush. Save your strength. Mortmain\x{2019}s gone. I must get help\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}No.\x{201d} She tightened her grip on him. \x{201c}No, you needn\x{2019}t do that, Will. It\x{2019}s not my blood.\x{201d}\x{201c}What?\x{201d} he said, staring. Perhaps she was delirious, he thought, but her grip and her voice were surprisingly strong for someone who should have been dead. \x{201c}Whatever he did to you, Tessa\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}I did it,\x{201d} she said in the same firm little voice. \x{201c}I did it to myself, Will. It was the only way I knew to make him go away. He would never have left me here. Not if he\x{2019}d thought I was alive.\x{201d}\x{201c}But\x{2014}\x{201d}\x{201c}I Changed. When the knife touched me, I Changed, just in that moment. It was something that Mortmain had said that gave me the idea\x{2014}that sleight of hand is a simple trick and that no one ever expects it.\x{201d}\x{201c}I don\x{2019}t understand. The blood?\x{201d}She nodded, her small face alight with relief, with her pleasure in telling him what she had done. \x{201c}There was a woman, once, that the Dark Sisters made me Change into, who had died of a gunshot wound, and when I Changed her blood poured all over me. Did I tell you that? I thought perhaps I had, but it doesn\x{2019}t matter\x{2014}I remembered it, and I Changed into her, just for that moment, and the blood came, as it had before. I turned away from Mortmain so he couldn\x{2019}t see me change, and crumpled forward as if the knife had truly gone in\x{2014}and indeed, the force of the Change, doing it so quickly, made me quite sincerely faint. The world went dark, and then I heard Mortmain calling my name. I knew I must have come back to myself, and I knew I must pretend to be dead. I fear he would have certainly found me out had you not arrived.\x{201d} She looked down at herself, and Will could have sworn there was a faintly smug tone to her voice as she said, \x{201c}I tricked the Magister, Will! I would not have thought it possible\x{2014}he was so confident of his superiority over me. But I recalled what you had said about Boadicea. If it had not been for your words, Will \x{2026}\x{201d}She looked up at him with a smile. The smile broke what was left of his resistance\x{2014}shattered it. He had let the walls down when he\x{2019}d thought she was gone, and there was no time to build them back up. Helplessly he pulled her against him. For a moment she clung to him tightly, warm and alive in his arms. Her hair brushed his cheek. The color had come back into the world; he could breathe again, and for that moment he breathed her in\x{2014}she smelled of salt, blood, tears, and Tessa.When she drew back from his embrace, her eyes were shining. \x{201c}I thought when I heard your voice that it was a dream,\x{201d} she said. \x{201c}But you are real.\x{201d} Her eyes searched his face, and, as if satisfied at what they found there, she smiled. \x{201c}You are real.\x{201d}He opened his mouth. The words were there. He was about to say them when a jolt of terror went through him, the terror of someone who, wandering in a mist, pauses only to realize that they have stopped inches from the edge of a gaping abyss. The way she was looking at him\x{2014}she could read what was in his eyes, he realized. It must have been written plainly there, like words on the page of a book. There had been no time, no chance, to hide it.\x{201c}Will,\x{201d} she whispered. \x{201c}Say something, Will.\x{201d}But there was nothing to say. There was only the emptiness, as there had been before her. As there always would be.I have lost everything, Will thought. Everything.Unknown",
