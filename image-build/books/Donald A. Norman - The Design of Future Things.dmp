I\x{2019}ve visited several of these experiments and observed the results. At <<one|9t:0>> research facility at a European university, people were asked to play a stressful video game, then allowed to rest afterwards in a special experimental room equipped with comfortable chairs, friendly and aesthetically pleasing furniture, and specially equipped lighting designed to relax the inhabitants. When I tried it, I found it to be a calm and restful environment. The goal of the research was to understand how to develop room environments appropriate to a person\x{2019}s emotional state. Could a home relax its inhabitants automatically when it detected stress? Or perhaps the home could take on a zingy, upbeat mood with bright lights, lively music, and warm colors when it determined that the inhabitants needed an energy boost.",

            "The technologists will try to reassure us that all technologies start off as weak and underpowered, that eventually their deficits are overcome and they become safe and trustworthy. At <<one|9t:0>> level they are correct. Steam engines and steamships used to explode; they seldom do anymore. Early aircraft crashed frequently. Today, they hardly ever do. Remember Jim\x{2019}s problem with the cruise control that regained speed in an inappropriate location? I am certain that this particular situation can be avoided in future designs by coupling the speed control with the navigation system, or perhaps by developing systems in which the roads themselves transmit the allowable speeds to the cars (hence, no more ability to exceed speed limits), or better yet, by having the car itself determine safe speeds given the road, its curvature, slipperiness, and the presence of other traffic or people.",
