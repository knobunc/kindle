Neither should she have described the visit to try and rescue Isabel, or blamed Dan\x{2019}s skewed priorities for the failure of that mission. George had stood beside her at the sink, drying the pans and utensils she had dumped, dripping, on to the draining board, and listened. She might have consoled herself by reminding herself that Dan had gone back to the garrison yet again, because of some trouble in the blocks, and that George could always have indicated that he didn\x{2019}t want to hear any more, but <<two in the morning|5>> was no time for consolation of any kind.
