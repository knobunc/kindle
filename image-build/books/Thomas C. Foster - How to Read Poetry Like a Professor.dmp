            "This is music for the spirit rather than the ear. The beauty of the scene lies not in its realization but in its potentiality, for the way that it adumbrates its story rather than filling in all the details. Which praise he delivers in considerable detail. Throughout the second and third stanzas he <<lauds|13>> the permanence of the scene: the lover cannot extract his kiss, but on the other hand, neither he nor his quarry will ever age, nor will they be subject to the heartaches of real human love. Stanza four offers further detail of the urn\x{2019}s pictorial tale: priests coming to a sacrifice, leading a garlanded heifer, townsfolk following along and leaving, thereby, a town forever abandoned (because they are on the urn and not back at home), everything captured in clay. Forever.",
