            "Everyone hates the boy. It is a complex hatred, one that often causes the haters to feel mean and guilty and to hate themselves for feeling this way about such an accomplished and well-meaning boy, which then tends to make them involuntarily hate the boy even more for arousing such self-hatred. The whole thing is totally confusing and upsetting. People take a lot of aspirin when he\x{2019}s around. The boy\x{2019}s only real friends among kids are the damaged, the handicapped, the fat, the last-picked, the non grata\x{2014} he seeks them out. All 316 invitations to his eleventh-birthday BLOWOUT BASH\x{2014} 322 invitations if you count the ones made on audiotape for the blind\x{2014}are offset-printed on quality vellum with matching high-rag envelopes addressed in ornate Phillippian II calligraphy he\x{2019}s spent three weekends on, and each invitation details in Roman-numeraled outline form the itinerary\x{2019}s half-day at Six Flags, private PhD-guided tour of the Blanford Nature Center, and Reserved Banquet Area w/Free Play at Shakee\x{2019}s Pizza and Indoor Arcade on Remembrance Drive (the whole day gratis and paid for out of the Paper and Aluminum Drives the boy got up at <<4:00 A.M.|2a>> all summer to organize and spearhead, the balance of the Drives\x{2019} receipts going to the Red Cross and the parents of a Kentwood third-grader with terminal spina bifida who dreams above all else of seeing the Lions\x{2019} Night Train Lane play live from his motorized wheelchair), and the invitations explicitly call the party this\x{2014}a BLOWOUT BASH\x{2014} in balloon-shaped font as the caption to an illustrated explosion of good cheer and -will and no-holds-barred-let-out-all-the-stops FUN, with the bold-faced proviso PLEASE\x{2014}NO PRESENTS REQUIRED in each of each card\x{2019}s four corners; and the 316 invitations, sent via First-Class Mail to every student, instructor, substitute instructor, aide, administrator, and custodian at C. P.

            "\x{2018}New to the Post. Freshly assigned I meant.\x{2019} The man\x{2019}s voice was clear even though he seemed to address the window, which was unclean. Sylvanshine felt hemmed in; the seats were more a cushioned bench and there were no armrests to provide even the illusion or impression of personal space. Plus the van swayed alarmingly on the road, which was either a road or a sort of rural highway, and you could hear the chassis\x{2019}s springs. The rodential man, whose aura was timid but kind, a sad kind man who lived in a cube of fear, had his hat in his lap. Capacity 24 and full. There was the yeasty smell of wet men. The energy level was low; they were all coming back from something that had consumed a lot of energy. Sylvanshine could almost literally see the small pink man drinking Pepto-Bismol straight out of the bottle and going home to a woman who treated him like an uninteresting stranger. The two men either worked together or knew each other very well; they were talking in tandem without even being quite aware of it. An alpha-beta tandem, which meant either Audit or CID. It occurred to Sylvanshine that the window held a faint oblique reflection of him and that the alpha of the two men was amusing himself slightly by addressing Sylvanshine\x{2019}s reflection as if it were him, while the hamster affected the facial expression of address but said nothing. Stock donations are disguised capital-gains treatments\x{2014}there was also a sound, gassy and tinkly like half a bar of calliope, when the driver downshifted or the boxy van swayed hard on a reverse-S next to a billboard that read DOWNSIZE THIS and then a picture Sylvanshine didn\x{2019}t catch, and while the urbane man was offhandedly introducing them (Sylvanshine didn\x{2019}t catch the names, which he knew would cause trouble because it was insulting to have forgotten people\x{2019}s names, especially if you were attached to an alleged wunderkind in Personnel and Personnel was your business, and he would have to go through all sorts of conversational gymnastics in the future to avoid using their names, and God help him if they were climbers and expected one day to come up and have him make introductions to Merrill, although if they were CID this would be less likely because Investigations and Fraud usually had their own infrastructure and office space, often in a separate building, at least in Rome and Philly, because forensic accountants like to think of themselves more as law enforcement than Service, and didn\x{2019}t as a rule much mix, and in fact the taller man, Bondurant, did identify both himself and Britton as CID GS-9s, which Sylvanshine was too occupied with mortification at missing their names to internalize until much later that evening, when he would recollect the substance of the conversation and experience a moment of relief). The timorous man rarely lied; the more urbane CID agent lied rather a lot, Sylvanshine could feel. The window clicked with a fine rain, the sort of rain that stabs you but doesn\x{2019}t get you wet. Little drops\x{2014}tiny drops\x{2014}peened on the glass, in which the less strictly dependable of the two cupped his chin and let out a sigh that was at least partly for effect. Somewhere behind was the sound of a handheld video game, and the small sounds of other agents watching the game\x{2019}s progress over the shoulder of the man who was playing the game, who was silent. The van or bus\x{2019}s wipers made a small shrieking sound on every second pass\x{2014}it occurred to Sylvanshine that the driver looked as if he was almost resting his chin on top of the wheel because he was leaning way forward to try to get closer to the windshield the way anxious people or people with poor eyesight will do when they\x{2019}re having trouble seeing. The slicker of the two CIDs in the window had an almost kite-shaped face, both square and pointy at the cheekbones and chin; Bondurant could feel the sharp pressure of his chin in his palm and the way the edge of the window\x{2019}s casement dug in a straight line between the bones of his elbow. Everyone but Sylvanshine knew where they\x{2019}d all been and what they\x{2019}d been doing in Joliet, but none of them were thinking about it in any kind of informative way because that\x{2019}s not how people think about what they\x{2019}ve just done. From outside the vehicle it was clear what it was\x{2014}both the shape and the sway of it, as well as the fact that the top layer of tan paint had been shoddily applied and in places the headlights of the cars behind it picked up flashes of the bright colors beneath, the ballooned letters and icons on sticks at angles that suggested yumminess in some mysterious way only children get. Inside was the sound of the engine and the fluctuant murmur of small conversations melted by anticipation of the end of something\x{2014}a conference or retreat, perhaps, or maybe an in-service training; Rome personnel had always been going to Buffalo or Manhattan for In-Service Trainings\x{2014}and the handheld game, and a slight rustle or twitter in the breathing of the pale pink fellow, who Sylvanshine could feel was looking at the right side of his face, and the sound of Bondurant asking Sylvanshine about the Rome post\x{2019}s CID division, and from one spot ahead and one behind and to the right the tinny whisper of people listening to things on possible headphones\x{2014}a sure sign of a younger agent, and it occurred to Sylvanshine that the last time he\x{2019}d seen any sort of black or Latin person had been at the Chicago airport that wasn\x{2019}t O\x{2019}Hare but he couldn\x{2019}t quite seem to lasso the name and felt odd getting his ticket receipt out of his case\x{2014}while the smaller appeared to be watching him, waiting for him to do something that would betray some sort of inadequacy or deficit in retention. Describe the advantages of Octal Machine Language over Binary Machine Language in designing a Level-2 program for tracking regularities in the cash-flow sheets of related corporations, name two essential advantages for a franchise to filing Schedule <<20-50|5a:0>> returns as a subsidiary of its parent company rather than filing as an autonomous corporate entity\x{2014}and there it was again, the snatch of forced-air music that Sylvanshine couldn\x{2019}t place but made him want to leave his seat and go chase something on foot in the company of all the children in the neighborhood, all of whom come boiling out of their respective front doors and hotfooting it up the street holding currency aloft, and before he could think, Sylvanshine said, \x{2018}Bizarre as this sounds, can either of you every so often hear\x{2014}?\x{2019}",

            "The small light-pink CID agent Britton had, without any sort of throat-clearing or segue, asked Sylvanshine what he was thinking, which seemed to Sylvanshine grotesquely and almost obscenely inappropriate and invasive, rather like asking what your wife looked like naked or what your private restroom functions smelled like, but of course it would be impossible to say any of this aloud, particularly for someone whose job here involved cultivating good relations and uncluttered lines of communication for Merrill Lehrl to exploit when he arrived\x{2014}to mediate for Merrill Lehrl and to at once gather information on as many aspects and issues involved in the examination of returns as possible, since there were some difficult, delicate decisions to make, decisions whose import extended far beyond this provincial post and any way it went it was going to be painful. Sylvanshine, turning slightly but not all the way (a flare of orange in his left shoulder blade) to meet at least Gary Britton\x{2019}s left eye, realized that he had very little emotional or ethical \x{2018}read\x{2019} on Britton or anyone on the bus but Bondurant, who was having some kind of wistful memory and was cultivating the wistfulness, reclining a bit in it as one would in a warm bath. When something large and oncoming passed, the windshield\x{2019}s big rectangle was for a moment incandesced and opaque with water, which the wipers heaved mightily to displace. Britton\x{2019}s gaze\x{2014}seemed to Sylvanshine more like looking at his right eye than into it. (At this time it moved through Thomas Bondurant\x{2019}s mind, which lended to be tornadic, as he looked out the window but more back and in at his own memory, that one could look out a window, look in a window as there was the gold ponytail and a flash of creamy shoulder in the window, through a window [close to \x{2018}out\x{2019}], or even at a window, as in examining the pane\x{2019}s clarity and whether it was clean.) The gaze nevertheless seemed to be one of expectancy, and Sylvanshine felt again past the emptiness of his stomach and the pinched nerve in his clavicle how opaque the bus\x{2019}s overall mood was and different from the horror-fraught tension of the Philadelphia <<0104|18:0>>\x{2019}s hundred and seventy agents or the manic torpor of tiny 408\x{2019}s dozen in Rome. His own mood, the complex hybrid of destination-fatigue and anticipatory fear one feels at the end not of a journey but a move, did not in any way complement the mood of the former Squishee truck nor of the urbane wistful older agent to his left nor of the human blank-spot who\x{2019}d asked an invasive question whose honest answer would entail acknowledging the invasion, putting Sylvanshine in a personnel-relations bind before he\x{2019}d even arrived at the Post, which seemed for a moment terribly unfair and flushed Sylvanshine with self-pity, a feeling not as dark as the wing of despair but tinged carmine with a resentment that was both better and worse than ordinary anger because it had no specific object. There seemed no one in particular to blame; something in Gary or Gerry Britton\x{2019}s aspect made it obvious that his question was some inevitable extension of his character and that he was no more to be blamed for it than an ant was to be blamed for crawling on your potato salad at a picnic\x{2014}creatures just did what they did.",

            "Stecyk started at the end of the block and came up the first flagstone walkway with his briefcase and rang the bell. \x{2018}Good morning,\x{2019} he said to the older lady who answered the door in what was either a robe or very casual housedress (it was <<7:20|2>>, so bathrobes were not only probable but downright appropriate) whose collar she was holding tightly closed with one hand and was looking through the door\x{2019}s crack at different points over Stecyk\x{2019}s shoulders as if certain there must be someone else behind him. Stecyk said, \x{2018}My name is Leonard Stecyk, I go by Leonard but Len is also perfectly fine as far as I\x{2019}m concerned, and I\x{2019}ve recently had the opportunity to move in and set up housekeeping in 6F in the Angler\x{2019}s Cove complex just up the street there, I\x{2019}m sure you\x{2019}ve seen it either leaving home or returning, it\x{2019}s just right up the street there at <<121|9c:0>>, and I\x{2019}d like to say Hello and introduce myself and say I\x{2019}m pleased to be part of the neighborhood and to offer you as a token of greetings and thanks this free copy of the US Post Office\x{2019}s 1979 National Zip Code Directory, listing the zip codes for every community and postal zone in each state of the United States in alphabetical order, and also\x{2019}\x{2014}shifting the briefcase under his arm to open the directory and hold it out open to the woman\x{2019}s view\x{2014}something seemed wrong with one of the lady\x{2019}s eyes, as if she were having trouble with a contact lens or perhaps had some foreign matter under the upper lid, which could be uncomfortable\x{2014}\x{2018}additionally listing here on the back of the last page and inside the rear cover, the cover\x{2019}s the continuation, the addresses and toll-free numbers of over forty-five government agencies and and services from which you can receive free informational material, some of which is almost shockingly valuable, see I\x{2019}ve put small asterisks next to those, which I know for a fact are helpful and an extraordinary bargain, and which are of course after all when you come right down to it paid for with your tax dollars, so why not extract value from the contributions if you know what I mean, though of course the choice is entirely up to you\x{2019}\x{2014}the lady was also turning her head slightly in the way of someone whose hearing wasn\x{2019}t quite what it used to be, noting which Stecyk put the briefcase down to ink one or two extra asterisks by numbers that in this case might be of special help. Then making a large motion of handing it over and letting the postal directory hang there in midair just outside the door while the lady had her face screwed up and seemed to be deciding whether to disengage the door\x{2019}s chain in order to accept it. \x{2018}Maybe I\x{2019}ll just be leaning it up here against the milkbox\x{2019}\x{2014}pointing down at the milkbox\x{2014}\x{2018}and you can peruse it at leisure at your own convenience later in the day or really whatever you might choose to do,\x{2019} Stecyk said. He liked to make a small jest or sally of employing a motion as if he were tipping his hat even though his hand never made contact with the hat; he felt it was both courtly and amusing. \x{2018}Hidey ho, then,\x{2019} he said. He proceeded back down the walkway, missing all the cracks and hearing the door behind him close only as he reached the sidewalk and made a sharp right and took eighteen strides to the next walkway and a sharp right to the door, which had a wrought-iron security door installed before it and at which there was no answer after three rings and shave-and-haircut knock. He left his card with his new address and the gist of his greeting and offer and another 1979 zip code directory (the 1980 directory would not be out until August; he had an order in) and proceeded down the walkway, a spring to his step, his smile so wide it almost looked like it hurt.",

            "My mother\x{2019}s the sort of somewhat lanky type of older woman who seems to become almost skinny and tough with age instead of ballooning out, becoming ropy and sharp-jointed and her cheekbones even more pronounced. I remember sometimes thinking of beef jerky when I would first see her, and then feeling terrible that I had that association. She was quite good-looking in her day, though, and some of the later weight-loss was also nerve-related, because after the thing with my father her nerves got worse and worse. Admittedly, too, one other factor in her sticking up for me with my father as to drifting in and out of school was the past trouble I\x{2019}d had with reading in primary school when we\x{2019}d lived in Rockford and my father had worked for the City of Rockford. This was in the mid-1960s, at Machesney Elementary. I went through a sudden period where I couldn\x{2019}t read. I mean that I actually could read\x{2014}my mother knew I could read from when we\x{2019}d read children\x{2019}s books together. But for almost two years at Machesney, instead of reading something I\x{2019}d count the words in it, as though reading was the same as just counting the words. For example, \x{2018}Here came Old Yeller, to save me from the hogs\x{2019} would equate to ten words which I would count off from <<one to ten|10a:0>> instead of its being a sentence that made you love Old Yeller in the book even more. It was a strange problem in my developmental wiring at the time which caused a lot of trouble and embarrassment and was one reason why we ended up moving to the Chicagoland area, because for a while it looked as though I would have to attend a special school in Lake Forest. I have very little memory of this time except for the feeling of not especially wanting to count words or intending to but just not being able to help it\x{2014}it was frustrating and strange. It got worse under pressure or nervousness, which is typical of things like that. Anyhow, part of my mother\x{2019}s fierce defense of letting me experience and learn things in my own way dates from that time, when the Rockford School District reacted to the reading problem in all sorts of ways that she didn\x{2019}t think were helpful or fair. Some of her consciousness-raising and entry into the women\x{2019}s lib movement of the 1970s probably also dates from that time of fighting the bureaucracy of the school district. I still sometimes lapse into counting words, or rather usually the counting goes on when I\x{2019}m reading or talking, as a sort of background noise or unconscious process, a little like breathing.",

            "I remember rooming in a high-rise UIC dorm with a very mod, with-it sophomore from Naperville who also wore sideburns and a leather thong and played the guitar. He saw himself as a nonconformist, and also very unfocused and nihilistic, and deeply into the school\x{2019}s wastoid drug scene, and drove what I have to admit was a very cool-looking 1972 Firebird that it eventually turned out his parents paid the insurance on. I cannot remember his name, try as I might. UIC stood for the University of Illinois, Chicago Campus, a gigantic urban university. The dorm we roomed in was right on Roosevelt, and our main windows faced a large downtown podiatric clinic\x{2014}I can\x{2019}t remember its name, either\x{2014}which had a huge raised electrified neon sign that rotated on its pole every weekday from <<8:00|2>> to <<8:00|2>> with the name and mnemonic phone number ending in 3668 on one side and on the other a huge colored outline of a human foot\x{2014}our best guess was a female foot, from the proportions\x{2014}and I remember that this roommate and I formulated a kind of ritual in which we\x{2019}d make sure to try to be at the right spot at our windows at <<8:00|2>> each night to watch the foot sign go dark and stop rotating when the clinic closed. It always went dark at the same time the clinic\x{2019}s windows did and we theorized that everything was on one main breaker. The sign\x{2019}s rotation didn\x{2019}t stop all at once. It more like slowly wound down, with almost a wheel-of-fortune quality about where it would finally stop. The ritual was that if the sign stopped with the foot facing away, we would go to the UIC library and study, but if it stopped with the foot or any significant part of it facing our windows, we would take it as a \x{2018}sign\x{2019} (with the incredibly obvious double entendre) and immediately blow off any homework or supposed responsibility we had and go instead to the Hat, which at that time was the currently hip UIC pub and place to hear bands, and would drink beers and play quarters and tell all the other kids whose parents were paying their tuition about the ritual of the rotating foot in a way that we all appeared nihilistically wastoid and hip. I\x{2019}m seriously embarrassed to remember things like this. I can remember the podiatrist\x{2019}s sign and the Hat and what the Hat looked and even smelled like, but I cannot remember this roommate\x{2019}s name, even though we probably hung out together three or four nights a week that year. The Hat had no relation to Meibeyer\x{2019}s, which is the main sort of pub for rote examiners here at the REC, and also has a hat motif and an elaborate display-rack of hats, but these are meant to be historical IRS and CPA hats, the hats of serious adults. Meaning the similarity is just a coincidence. There were actually two Hats, as in a franchise\x{2014}there was the UIC one on Cermak and Western, and another one down in Hyde Park for the more motivated, focused kids at U of Chicago. Everybody at our Hat called the Hyde Park Hat \x{2018}the Yarmulke.\x{2019} This roommate was not a bad or evil guy, although he turned out to be able to play only three or four real songs on the guitar, which he played over and over and over, and blatantly rationalized his selling of drugs as a form of social rebellion instead of just pure capitalism, and even at the time I knew he was a total conformist to the late-seventies standards of so-called nonconformity, and sometimes I felt contemptuous of him. I might have despised him a little. As if I was exempt, of course\x{2014}but this kind of blatant projection and displacement was part of the nihilist hypocrisy of the whole period.",

            "In hindsight, I realized later that my father was actually kind of witty and sophisticated. At the time, I think I thought of him as barely alive, as like a robot or slave to conformity. It\x{2019}s true that he was uptight, anal, and quick with the put-downs. He was a hundred percent conventional establishment, and totally on the other side of the generation gap\x{2014}he was forty-nine when he died, which was in December 1977, which obviously means he grew up during the Depression. But I don\x{2019}t think I ever appreciated his sense of humor about all of it\x{2014}there was a way he sort of wove his pro-establishment views into a dry, witty style that I don\x{2019}t remember ever getting or understanding his jokes in at the time. I didn\x{2019}t have much of a sense of humor then, it seems, or else I did the standard child\x{2019}s thing of taking everything he said as a personal comment or judgment. There was stuff I knew about him, which I\x{2019}d picked up through the years of childhood, mostly from my mother. Like that he\x{2019}d been really, really shy when they\x{2019}d first met. How he had wanted to go to more than just technical college but he had bills to pay\x{2014}he was in logistics and supply in Korea but had already gotten married to my mother before he was posted overseas, and so upon discharge he immediately had to find a job. This is what people her age did then, she explained\x{2014}if you met the right person and were at least out of high school, you got married, without even ever really thinking about it or questioning yourself. The point is that he was very smart and somewhat unfulfilled, like many of his generation. He worked hard because he had to, and his own dreams were put on the back burner. This is all indirectly, from my mother, but it fit with certain bits and pieces that even I couldn\x{2019}t help being aware of. For instance, my father read all the time. He was constantly reading. It was his whole recreation, especially after the divorce\x{2014}he was always coming home from the library with a stack of books with that clear library plastic wrap on the covers. I never paid any attention to what the books were or why he read so much\x{2014}he never talked about what he was reading. I don\x{2019}t even know what his favorite kinds were, as in history, mysteries, or what. Looking back now, I think he was lonely, especially after the divorce, as the only people you could call his friends were colleagues from his job, and I think he essentially found his job boring\x{2014}I don\x{2019}t think he felt much personal investment in the City of Chicago\x{2019}s budget and expenditure protocols, especially as it wasn\x{2019}t his idea to move here\x{2014}and I think books and intellectual issues were one of his escapes from boredom. He was actually a very smart person. I wish I could remember more examples of the sort of things he\x{2019}d say\x{2014}at the time, I think they seemed more hostile or judgmental than like he was making fun of both of us at the same time. I do remember he sometimes referred to the so-called younger generation (meaning mine) as \x{2018}This thing America hath wrought.\x{2019} That\x{2019}s not a very good example. It\x{2019}s almost like he thought the blame went both ways, that there was something wrong with the whole country\x{2019}s adults if they could produce kids like this in the 1970s. I remember once in October or November 1976, at <<twenty-one|9e:1>>, during another period of time off, after being enrolled at DePaul\x{2014}which actually didn\x{2019}t go well at all, the first time I was at DePaul. It was basically a disaster. They kind of invited me to leave, actually, which was the only time that had happened. The other times, at Lindenhurst College and then later at UIC, I\x{2019}d withdrawn on my own. Anyhow, during this time off, I was working the second shift at a Cheese Nabs factory in Buffalo Grove and living there at my father\x{2019}s house in Libertyville. There was no way I was crashing at my mother and Joyce\x{2019}s apartment in the Wrigleyville section of Chicago, where the rooms all had bead curtains instead of doors. But I didn\x{2019}t have to punch in at this mindless job until <<six|9c:1>>, so I\x{2019}d mostly just hang around the house all afternoon until it was time to leave. And sometimes during this period my father would be away for a couple of days\x{2014}like the Service, the City of Chicago\x{2019}s financial departments were always sending their more technical people to conferences and in-services, which I would come to learn later here in the Service are not like the big drunken conventions of private industry but are usually highly intensive and work-centered. My father said the city in-services were mostly just tedious, which was a word he used a fair amount, tedious. And on these trips it was just me living in the house, and you can imagine what used to happen when I\x{2019}d be there on my own, especially on weekends, even though I was supposed to be in charge of looking after the house while he was gone. But the memory is of him coming home early one afternoon in \x{2019}76 from one of these work trips, like a day or two before I\x{2019}d thought he told me he was going to be home, and coming in the front door and finding me and two of my old so-called friends from Libertyville South high school in the living room\x{2014}which, due to the slightly raised design of the front porch and front door, was in effect a sunken living room that more or less started right inside the front door, with one small set of stairs leading down into the living room and another set leading up to the house\x{2019}s second floor. Architecturally, the house\x{2019}s style is known as a raised ranch, like most of the other older homes on the street, and it had another set of stairs leading from the second-floor hallway down into the garage, which actually supports part of the second story\x{2014}that is, the garage is, structurally, a necessary part of the house, which is what\x{2019}s distinctive about a raised ranch. At the moment he entered, two of us were slumped on the davenport with our dirty feet up on his special coffee table, and the carpeting was all littered with beer cans and Taco Bell wrappers\x{2014}the cans were my father\x{2019}s beer, which he bought in bulk twice a year and stored in the utility room closet and normally drank maybe a total of two per week of\x{2014}with us sitting there totally wasted and watching The Searchers on WGN, and one of the guys listening to Deep Purple on my father\x{2019}s special stereo headphones for listening to classical music on, and the coffee table\x{2019}s special oak or maple top with big rings of condensation from the beer cans all over it because we\x{2019}d turned the house\x{2019}s heat way up past where he normally allowed it to be, in terms of energy conservation and expense, and the other guy next to me on the davenport leaning over in the middle of taking a huge bong hit\x{2014}this guy was famous for being able to take massive hits. Plus, the whole living room reeked. When then, suddenly, in the memory, I heard the distinctive sound of his footsteps on the broad wooden porch and the sound of his key in the front door, and only a second later my father suddenly comes in on a wave of very cold, clear air through the doorway with his hat and overnight bag\x{2014}I was in the paralyzed shock of the totally busted kid, and I sat there paralyzed, unable to do anything and yet seeing each frame of him coming in with horrible focus and clarity\x{2014}and him standing there at the edge of the few stairs down to the living room, taking his hat off with the trademark gesture that involved both his head and his hand as he stood there taking in the scene and the three of us\x{2014}he\x{2019}d made no secret of not much liking these old high school friends, who were the same guys I\x{2019}d been out partying with when my mom\x{2019}s gas cap was stolen and the tank siphoned out, and none of us had any money left by the time we found the car, and I had to call my father and he had to take the train down after work to pay for gas so I could get the Le Car back to my mom and Joyce, who co-owned it and used it for bookstore business\x{2014}with the three of us now slumped there all totally wasted and paralyzed, one of the guys wearing a ratty old tee shirt that actually said FUCK YOU across the chest, the other coughing out his mammoth hit in shock, so that a plume of pot smoke went rolling out across the living room towards my father\x{2014}in short, my memory is of the scene being the worst confirmation of the worst kind of generation-gap stereotype and parental disgust for their decadent, wastoid kids, and of my father slowly putting down his bag and case and just standing there, with no expression and not saying anything for what felt like such a long time, and then he slowly made a gesture of putting one arm up in the air a little and looking up and said, \x{2018}Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!,\x{2019} and then picked up his overnight bag again and without a word walked up the upstairs stairs and went into their old bedroom and closed the door. He didn\x{2019}t slam it, but you could hear the door close quite firmly. The memory, strangely, which is horribly sharp and detailed up to there, then totally stops, like a tape that\x{2019}s just run out, and I don\x{2019}t know what happened after that, like getting the guys out of there and hurriedly trying to clean everything up and turn the thermostat back down to sixty-eight, though I do remember feeling like complete shit, not so much like I\x{2019}d been \x{2018}busted\x{2019} or was in trouble as just childish, like a spoiled little selfish child, and imagining what I must have looked like to him, sitting there in litter in his house, wasted, with my dirty feet on the marked-up coffee table he and my mother had saved up for and gotten at an antique store in Rockford when they were still young and didn\x{2019}t have much money, and which he prized, and rubbed lemon oil in all the time, and said all he asked was that I should please keep my feet off of it and use a coaster\x{2014}like, for a second or two seeing what I actually must have looked like to him as he stood there looking at us treating his living room like that. It wasn\x{2019}t a pretty picture, and it felt even worse as he hadn\x{2019}t yelled or squeezed my shoes about it\x{2014}he just looked weary, and sort of embarrassed for both of us\x{2014}and I remember for a second or two I could actually feel what he must have been feeling, and for an instant saw myself through his eyes, which made the whole thing much, much worse than if he\x{2019}d been furious, or yelled, which he never did, not even the next time he and I were alone in the same room\x{2014}which I don\x{2019}t remember when this was, like whether I skulked out of the house after cleaning everything up or whether I stayed there to face him. I don\x{2019}t know which one I did. I didn\x{2019}t even understand what he said, although obviously I understood he was being sarcastic, and in some way blaming himself or making fun of himself for having produced the \x{2018}work\x{2019} that had just thrown the Taco Bell wrappers and bags on the floor instead of bothering to get up and take like eight steps to throw them away. Although later on, I just stumbled on the poem it turned out he was quoting from, in some kind of weird context at the Indianapolis TAC, and my eyes just about bulged out of my head, because I hadn\x{2019}t even known it was a poem\x{2014}and a famous one, by the same British poet who evidently wrote the original Frankenstein. And I didn\x{2019}t even know my father read British poetry, much less that he could quote from it when he was upset. In short, there was probably much more to him than I was aware of, and I don\x{2019}t remember even realizing how little I knew about him, really, until after he was gone and it was too late. I expect that this sort of regret is typical, as well.",

            "If I had to describe my father, I would first say that my mother and father\x{2019}s marriage was one of the only ones I\x{2019}ve seen in which the wife was noticeably taller than the man. My father was 5' 6\" or 5' 6\x{bd}\", and not fat but stocky, the way many shorter men in their late forties are stocky. He might have weighed 170. He looked good in a suit\x{2014}like so many men of his generation, his body almost seemed designed to fill out and support a suit. And he owned some good ones, most single-button and single-vent, understated and conservative, in mainly three-season worsteds and one or two seersucker for hot weather, in which he also eschewed his usual business hat. To his credit\x{2014}at least in retrospect\x{2014}he rejected the so-called modern style\x{2019}s wide ties, brighter colors, and flared lapels, and found the phenomenon of leisure suits or corduroy sport coats nauseating. His suits were not tailored, but they were nearly all from Jack Fagman, a very old and respected men\x{2019}s store in Winnetka which he had patronized ever since our family relocated to the Chicagoland area in 1964, and some of them were really nice. At home, in what he called his \x{2018}mufti,\x{2019} he wore more casual slacks and double-knit dress shirts, sometimes under a sweater vest\x{2014}his favorite of these was argyle. Sometimes he wore a cardigan, though I think that he knew that cardigans made him look a little too broad across the beam. In the summer, there was sometimes the terrible thing of the Bermuda shorts with black dress socks, which it turned out were the only kind of socks my father even owned. One sport coat, a 36R in <<midnight|13>>-blue slubbed silk, had dated from his youth and early courtship of my mother, she had explained\x{2014}it was hard for her to even hear about this jacket after the accident, much less help tell me what to do with it. The clothes closet contained his best and third-best topcoats, also from Jack Fagman, with the empty wooden hanger still between them. He used shoe trees for his dress and office footwear; some of these were inherited from his own father. (\x{2018}These\x{2019} obviously referring to the shoe trees, not the shoes.) There was also a pair of leather sandals which he\x{2019}d received as a Christmas gift, and not only had never worn but hadn\x{2019}t even removed the catalogue tag from when it fell to me to go through his clothes closet and empty out the contents. The idea of lifts in his shoes would just never have occurred to my father. At that time, I had never to my knowledge seen a shoe tree, and didn\x{2019}t know what they were for, since I never took care of any of my shoes, or valued them.",

            "Anyhow, downers like Seconal and Valium simply made me go to sleep and sleep through whatever noise, including alarm clocks, happened to occur for the next fourteen hours, so these were not high on my list of favorites, either. You have to understand that most of these drugs were both plentiful and easy to get during this period. This was especially true at UIC, where the roommate I watched the foot and hung out so frequently at the Hat with was something of a human vending machine of recreational drugs, having established connections with mid-level dealers in the western suburbs, whom he always got extremely paranoid and suspicious if you asked him anything about, as if these were mafiosi instead of usually just young couples in apartment complexes. I know one thing he liked about me, though, as a roommate, was that there were so many different types of drugs that I didn\x{2019}t like or that didn\x{2019}t agree with me that he didn\x{2019}t have to be constantly worried about my discovering his stash\x{2014}which he usually kept in two guitar cases in the back of his half of the closet, which any idiot could have figured out from his behavior with the closet or the number of cases he had back there versus the one guitar he actually brought out and played his two songs over and over with\x{2014}or ripping him off. Like most student dealers, he did not deal cocaine, as there was too much money involved, not to mention coked-out people pounding on your door at <<3:00 in the morning|2a>>, so that cocaine was handled more by slightly older guys in leather hats and tiny little rat-like mustaches who operated out of bars like the Hat and King Philip\x{2019}s, which was another fashionable pub of the period, near the Mercantile Exchange on Monroe, where they also serviced younger commodity traders.",

I was by myself, wearing nylon warm-up pants and a black Pink Floyd tee shirt, trying to spin a soccer ball on my finger, and watching the CBS soap opera As the World Turns on the room\x{2019}s little black-and-white Zenith\x{2014}not Obetrolling or blowing off anything in particular but essentially still just being an unmotivated lump. There was certainly always reading and studying for finals I could do, but I was being a wastoid. I was slouched way down on my tailbone on the couch, so that everything on the little TV was framed by my knees, and watching As the World Turns while spinning the soccer ball in an idle, undirected way. It was technically the roommate\x{2019}s television, but he was a serious pre-med student and always at the science library, though he had taken the trouble to rig a specially folded wire coat hanger to take the place of the Zenith\x{2019}s missing antenna, which was the only reason it got any reception at all. As the World Turns ran on CBS from <<1:00|2>> to <<2:00 in the afternoon|2a>>. This was something I still did too much during that final year, sitting there wasting time in front of the little Zenith, and several times I\x{2019}d gotten passively sucked into CBS afternoon soap operas, where the shows\x{2019} characters all spoke and emoted broadly and talked to one another without any hitch or pause in intensity whatsoever, it seemed, so that there was something almost hypnotic about the whole thing, especially as I had no classes on Monday or Friday and it was all too easy to sit there and get sucked in. I can remember that many of the other DePaul students that year were hooked on the ABC soap opera General Hospital, gathering in great avid, hooting packs to watch it\x{2014}with their hip alibi being that they were actually making fun of the show\x{2014}but, for reasons that probably had to do with the Zenith\x{2019}s spotty reception, I was more of a CBS habitu\x{e9} that year, particularly As the World Turns and Guiding Light, which followed As the World Turns at <<2:00 P.M.|2a>> on weekdays and was actually in some ways an even more hypnotic show.",

            "I read more or less the whole thing. I won\x{2019}t even say how many words in toto. It took until <<almost 5:00 A.M.|2a>> At the very back\x{2014}not all the way, but tucked between two pages of the transcript of a 1966 USTC case called Uinta Livestock Corporation v. U.S. near the back of the binder\x{2014}were a couple of more forms to fill out, which reinforced my assumption that it really had been a kind of test to see if we were committed and interested enough to nut up and plow all the way through. I can\x{2019}t say I read everything carefully, of course. One of the few packets that wasn\x{2019}t totally eye-glazing was a rundown on the IRS Training and Assessment Centers and on the various types of entry-level posts available to recruits who came out of the TAC course with various levels of education and incentive packages. There were two IRS Training and Assessment Centers, in Indianapolis and Columbus OH, about which the packet had photos and regulations but nothing specific on what the training was actually like. As usually happens with photocopied photos, the images were mostly black masses with some indistinct white blobs; you couldn\x{2019}t really make out what was going on. Unlike the present day, the protocol in that era was that if you wanted a serious career in the Service, with a contract and civil service rank above GS-9, you had to go through a TAC course, which lasted twelve weeks. You also had to join the Treasury Employees union, although info on that criterion was not included in the packet. Otherwise you were, in essence, a temporary or seasonal worker, which the Service uses a lot of, especially in the lower levels of Returns Processing and Exams. I remember that the Post List\x{2019}s representation of the Service\x{2019}s structure was much simpler and less comprehensive than the recruiter\x{2019}s presentation\x{2019}s diagram, although this one also had a lot of asterisks and single and double lines connecting various parts of the page\x{2019}s grid, and the legend for these marks had been half cut off due to someone having xeroxed the thing at an angle. In that era, the six main nodes or Service branches consisted of Administration, Returns Processing, Compliance, Collections, Internal Control, Support Services, and something called Technical Branch, which was the only branch with the actual word Branch in its name on the diagram, which at the time I found curious. Each branch then branched into several subordinate divisions\x{2014}thirty-six divisions in all, though in today\x{2019}s Service there are now forty-eight separate divisions, some with cross-coordinated and overlapping functions which have to be streamlined and overseen by the Divisional Liaison Division, which is itself\x{2014}somewhat confusingly\x{2014}a division of both the Administration and Internal Control Branches. Each division then also comprised numerous subdivisions, some of whose typeface got extremely small and hard to read. The Compliance Branch\x{2019}s Examinations Division, for example, comprised positions\x{2014}though only those postings marked in italic font (which was practically impossible to make out on the Xerox) required a federal contract or TAC course\x{2014}in clerical, cart, data entry, data processing, classification, correspondence, district office interface, regional office interface, duplicating services, procurement, research audit interface, secretarial, personnel, service center interface, computer center interface, and so forth, as well as formal \x{2018}rote examiner\x{2019} posts grouped (in that era, though here at the Midwest REC now the group characterizations are quite a bit different) by the types of returns one specialized in, encoded on the diagram as 1040, 1040A, 1041, EST, and \x{2018}Fats,\x{2019} which refers to a complex 1040 with more than four schedules or attachments. Also, corporate 1120 and 1120S tax returns are examined by special examiners known in Exams as \x{2018}immersives,\x{2019} which the recruiting page did not include information on, as immersive exams are conducted by special elite, highly trained examiners who have their own special section of the REC facility.",

I was a fretful, nervous, anxious, worried boy. These were my parents\x{2019} words, and they became mine. Wet distended Sunday afternoons, while my mother and brother were at a recital and my father lay asleep on the couch in front of a Bengals game, with the libretto to Norma open on his chest, I felt the sort of soaring, ceilingless tedium that transcends tedium and becomes worry. I do not recall the things I worried about, but I remember the feeling, and it was an anxiety whose lack of a proper object is what made it horrible, free-floating. I\x{2019}d look out the window and see the glass instead of anything past it. I\x{2019}d think of the sorts of small games and toys and developmental projects my mother always suggested and within the boredom not only find them unappealing but be unable to imagine how anyone anywhere could possibly have the mindless energy to undertake any sort of child\x{2019}s amusements, or sit still in the silence long enough to read a picture book\x{2014}the whole world was torpid, enervated, worry-logged. My parents\x{2019} words and feelings became my own, as I took on the responsibilities of my role in the family drama, the nervous delicate son, object of my mother\x{2019}s concern, as my brother was the gifted, driven son whose piano filled the house after school and kept the twilight outside the windows where it belonged. In psychotherapy after the incident with my own son, I free-associated my way into recalling a Great Books presentation on Achilles and Hector in the eleventh grade, and I remembered realizing vividly that my family was Achilles, that my brother was Achilles\x{2019} shield and I the family\x{2019}s heel, the part of the family my mother held tight to and made undivine, and that the recognition had come in the middle of my speech and left again so fast I\x{2019}d not had time to grab it, though I did for much of my adolescence and early adulthood conceive of myself in terms of a heel or foot\x{2014}my internal remonstrances often took the form of calling myself a \x{2018}heel,\x{2019} for example, and it was true that people\x{2019}s feet, shoes, socks, and ankles were often the first things about them I noticed.

            "Moreover, the closer we came to metro Peoria\x{2019}s southeast side and the special access road to the Examination Center, the worse the traffic became. The reason for this was apparent from that first day: It was institutional stupidity in all its manifold forms and names. Item one. The highway people were broadening this section of Self-Storage Parkway into three lanes, but the construction served to reduce the extant two lanes to just one; the right lane was closed off with orange cones, even in sections where no construction was ongoing and the lane looked clear and navigable. And, of course, single-lane traffic always moves exactly as fast as the very slowest vehicle in line. Item two. There were, as mentioned, traffic lights every eighth- to quarter-mile, and yet the single southbound lane\x{2019}s line of traffic was substantially longer than the distance between any two such traffic lights, so that our progress was dependent not just on the color of the next traffic light ahead but also on the colors of the two or three lights beyond that. It was the obverse of gridlock. It seemed like very bad urban planning or traffic-management or whatever exactly the discipline involved here was, and I could feel the corduroy of my suit getting sodden along the entire area of contact with the Gremlin\x{2019}s patterned plastic seat, as well as along the hip and upper thigh that were mashed up against the human sprinkler next to me, who was by now radiating both heat and an acrid, panicky smell that made me turn my head and pretend to be concentrating hard on something in view beyond the window (which rolled down only halfway, due to some design flaw or obscure safety feature). There is no point in describing the gauntlet of franchise retail and shopping centers and auto and tire and motorcycle / Jet Ski outlets and self-serve gas plazas with built-in convenience stores and national fast food brands we crawled through, since it\x{2019}s now the same basic gauntlet around every US city\x{2014}I believe the economic term is \x{2018}monoculture.\x{2019} Item three. It emerged, finally, that the turnoff from the parkway to the Examination Center was not serviced with a traffic light, even though it also became visually obvious, when we got within view, that a good percentage of the cars currently in the single lane ahead of us on SSP were also bound for and hence turning in to the REC and its blacktop access road. (Though it would be a maddeningly long time before even this simple fact was explained to me, the REC\x{2019}s two main eight-hour shifts in that period were <<7:10 A.M.|2a>> to <<3:00 P.M.|2a>> and <<3:10 P.M.|2a>> to <<11:00 P.M.|2a>>, which meant that there was a tremendous amount of Service- and employee-owned vehicle traffic between the hours of <<2:00|2>> and <<4:00|2>>.) Meaning that it was actually the Exam Center itself, together with the absence of a traffic light and the abortive SSP construction, that had helped cause the hellacious backup, because there were also a large number of vehicles in the oncoming, northeastbound lanes trying to turn left, i.e. across our single lane, to enter the REC\x{2019}s access road as well, which required that the vehicle at the front of our lane\x{2019}s line for the right turn wait and wave the oncoming car through its left turn, which only a very few did, since traffic jams often bring out the most aggressive, me-first elements of the human makeup and cause behavior that itself, perversely, exacerbates the traffic jam\x{2014}this right here perhaps being the place to mention a behavior that we began seeing more and more of as we inched closer to the REC turnoff. Certain private vehicles in our lane veered rightward into the narrow gravel \x{2018}breakdown lane,\x{2019} in which they sped up and were able to pass dozens of other vehicles, illegally, which in and of itself would not have been a big deal except for the fact that as the REC turnoff approached and the breakdown lane began to narrow and disappear they then sought to merge left back into the legal single lane, which required someone in that lane to stop to let them in again, which further clotted traffic in the regular lane\x{2026} meaning that the selfish, me-first vehicles were significantly worsening the very jam that they\x{2019}d sought to bypass; they gained an extra couple of minutes by making the jam and delay slightly worse for everyone else in the shimmering line of cars in our lane. Within a couple weeks of daily commutes down SSP from the special low-cost Service housing to the REC each day, this selfish, me-first behavior with the breakdown lane began to fill me with such disgust and malice that I can still, to this day, remember some of the vehicles that chronically did it, i.e., the same kind of idiotic, solipsistic behavior that causes stampedes in public places in the event of a fire and results in the authorities finding huge numbers of blackened, trampled bodies at the front doors of places after the fires or riots have been quelled, people prevented from getting out precisely by the panic and selfishness with which they all rushed and clotted the exit and got in each other\x{2019}s way, causing everyone to die horribly, which I have to admit is what I began wishing for the various Vegas, Chevettes, and a particular light-blue AMC Pacer with one of those fish-shaped Christian decals on the bubble of a back window that made this maneuver almost every morning.",

            "Here is probably an apt place for some exposition on my background re: silence and concentrated deskwork. In hindsight, I know that there was something about the silent, motionless intensity with which everyone in that opened door\x{2019}s instant was studying the tax-related documents before them that frightened and thrilled me. The scene was such that you just knew that if you were to open the door for another brief instant ten, twenty, or forty minutes later, it would look and sound just the same. I had never seen anything like it. Or rather I had, in a way, for of course television and books often portray concentrated study or deskwork just this way, at least by implication. As in e.g. \x{2018}Irving knuckled down and spent the entire morning plowing through the paperwork on his desk\x{2019}; \x{2018}Only when she had finished the report did the executive glance at her watch and see that it was <<nearly midnight|13>>. She had been completely absorbed in her task, and was only now aware that she had worked through supper, and was famished. Gracious, wherever did all the time go? she thought to herself.\x{2019} Or even just as in \x{2018}He spent the day reading.\x{2019} In real life, of course, concentrated deskwork doesn\x{2019}t go this way. I had spent massive amounts of time in libraries; I knew quite well how deskwork really was. Especially if the task at hand was dry or repetitive, or dense, or if it involved reading something that had no direct relevance to your own life and priorities, or was work that you were doing only because you had to\x{2014}like for a grade, or part of a freelance assignment for pay from some lout who was off skiing. The way hard deskwork really goes is in jagged little fits and starts, brief intervals of concentration alternated with frequent trips to the men\x{2019}s room, the drinking fountain, the vending machine, constant visits to the pencil sharpener, phone calls you suddenly feel are imperative to make, rapt intervals of seeing what kinds of shapes you can bend a paperclip into, & c. This is because sitting still and concentrating on just one task for an extended length of time is, as a practical matter, impossible. If you said, \x{2018}I spent the whole night in the library, working on some client\x{2019}s sociology paper,\x{2019} you really meant that you\x{2019}d spent between two and three hours working on it and the rest of the time fidgeting and sharpening and organizing pencils and doing skin-checks in the men\x{2019}s room mirror and wandering around the stacks opening volumes at random and reading about, say, Durkheim\x{2019}s theories of suicide.",

            "The ghosts\x{2019} names are Garrity and Blumquist. Much of the following info comes after the fact from Claude Sylvanshine. Blumquist is a very bland, dull, efficient rote examiner who died at his desk unnoticed in 1980. Some of the older examiners actually worked with him in rotes in the 1970s. The other ghost is older. Meaning dating from an earlier historical period. Garrity had evidently been a line inspector for Mid West Mirror Works in the mid-twentieth century. His job was to examine each one of a certain model of decorative mirror that came off the final production line, for flaws. A flaw was usually a bubble or unevenness in the mirror\x{2019}s aluminum backing that caused the reflected image to distend or distort in some way. Garrity had twenty seconds to check each mirror. Industrial psychology was a primitive discipline then, and there was little understanding of non-physical types of stress. In essence, Garrity sat on a stool next to a slow-moving belt and moved his upper body in a complex system of squares and butterfly shapes, examining his face\x{2019}s reflection at very close range. He did this three times a minute, 1,440 times per day, 356 days a year, for eighteen years. Toward the end he evidently moved his body in the complex inspectorial system of squares and butterfly shapes even when he was off-duty and there were no mirrors around. In 1964 or 1965 he had apparently hanged himself from a steam pipe in what is now the north hallway off the REC Annex\x{2019}s wiggle room. Among the staff at <<047|9c:0>>, only Claude Sylvanshine knows anything detailed about Garrity, whom he\x{2019}s never actually seen\x{2014}and then most of what Sylvanshine gets is repetitive data on Garrity\x{2019}s weight, belt size, the topology of optical flaws, and the number of strokes it takes to shave with your eyes closed. Garrity is the easier of the wiggle room\x{2019}s two ghosts to mistake for a phantom because he\x{2019}s extremely chatty and distracting and thus is often taken by wigglers straining to maintain concentration as the yammering mind-monkey of their own personality\x{2019}s dark, self-destructive side.",

He could hear the female behind him clicking her ballpoint pen in a nervous and arrhythmic way, and once a sound that had to be her uncrossing and recrossing her legs in what sounded like sheer hose, a sound that sent a terrible wave of internal heat through Cusk, and caused the first felt drops to go running from armpits down his torso\x{2019}s sides beneath the dress shirt. He automatically lowered his head during an attack, as well as slumping as far down in his plastic seat as would be inconspicuous, seeking to make himself as small as possible, visually, in terms of the woman behind him, whom he imagined by now to be a heart-stoppingly pretty girl of about Cusk\x{2019}s own age, with extraordinary posture and composure and a round porcelain face with intimidating blue eyes and overall an almost European hauteur about her.

The Compliance Training Officer, he could hear, was alluding to a page in the Exam Orientation Booklet that the current slide on the screen was a representation of that turned out to be exact, item for item, as Cusk lowered his running head further and pretended to study the relevant page of the booklet, circumspectly wiping away each fallen drop of perspiration before it could pucker its dime-sized section of the page, in case anyone would ever need to borrow his booklet and wonder what kind of grotesque, creepy thing had happened to p.

Not to mention once when in a burst of absurd half-drunken freshman hubris he\x{2019}d accepted a massive assignment that involved auditing a Russian Existential and Absurdist Literature class and writing the papers for a wealthy and tormented son of a Rhode Island State Supreme Court justice who was actually enrolled in the class and discovering that not only all the reading and critical background but the seminar itself was actually held in Russian, which David Wallace did not know or speak one garbled syllable of, and had to sit there with an enormous rigid grin, transcribing the phonetic versions of whatever unearthly and incredibly rapid sounds were being made by everyone else in the room every Tuesday and Thursday from <<9:00|2>> to <<10:30|2>> for three weeks before he was able to think of a plausible excuse and backed out of the arrangement. Leaving the client\x{2014}who was still enrolled\x{2014}with his own very special sort of existential dilemma.

Then he did two more returns, checked the clock real quick, then two more, then bore down and did three in a row, then flexed and visualized and bore way down and did four without looking up once except to put the completed files and memos in the two Out trays side by side up in the top tier of trays where the cart boys could get them when they came by. After just an hour the beach was a winter beach, cold and gray and the dead kelp like the hair of the drowned, and it stayed that way despite all attempts. Then three more, including one 1040A where the deductions for AGI were added wrong and the Martinsburg printout hadn\x{2019}t caught it and had to be amended on one of the Form 020-Cs in the lower left tray and then a lot of the same information filled out on the regular 20 you still had to do even if it was just a correspondence audit and the file going to Joliet instead of the District, each code for which had to be looked up on the pull-out thing he had to scoot the chair awkwardly over to pull out all the way. Then another one, then a plummeting inside of him as the wall clock showed that what he\x{2019}d thought was another hour had not been. Not even close. 17 May 1985. Lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me a poor sinner. Crosschecking W-2s for the return\x{2019}s Line 7 off the place in the Martinsburg printout where the perforation if you wanted to separate the thing\x{2019}s sheets went right through the data and you had to hold it up against the light and almost sometimes guess, which his Chalk Leader said was a chronic bug with Systems but the wiggler was still accountable. The joke this week was how was an IRS rote examiner like a mushroom? Both kept in the dark and fed horseshit. He didn\x{2019}t know how mushrooms even worked, if it was true that you scooped waste on them. Sheri\x{2019}s cooking wasn\x{2019}t what you would call at the level of adding mushrooms. Then another return. The rule was, the more you looked at the clock the slower the time went. None of the wigglers wore a watch, except he saw that some kept them in their pockets for breaks. Clocks on Tingles were not allowed, nor coffee or pop. Try as he might he could not this last week help envisioning the inward lives of the older men to either side of him, doing this day after day. Getting up on a Monday and chewing their toast and putting their hats and coats on knowing what they were going out the door to come back to for eight hours. This was boredom beyond any boredom he\x{2019}d ever felt. This made the routing desk at UPS look like a day at Six Flags. It was May 17, early morning, or early mid-morning you could maybe almost call it now. He could hear the squeak of the cart boys\x{2019} carts someplace off at a distance where the vinyl panels between his Chalk\x{2019}s Tingles and the blond oriental fellow\x{2019}s Chalk one row up blocked the sight of them, the kids with the carts. One of the carts had a crazy wheel that chattered when the boy pushed it. Lane Dean always knew when that cart was coming down the rows. Chalk, Team, Group, Pod, Post, Division. He did another return, again the math squared and there were no itemizations on 34A and the printout\x{2019}s numbers for W-2 and 1099 and Forms 2440 and 2441 appeared to square and he filled out his codes for the middle tray\x{2019}s 402 and signed his name and ID number that some part of him still refused to quite get memorized so he had to unclip his badge and check it each time and then stapled the 402 to the return and put the file in the top tier\x{2019}s rightmost tray for 402s Out and refused to let himself count the number in the trays yet, and then unbidden came the thought that boring also meant something that drilled in and made a hole. His buttocks already ached from flexing, and the mere thought of envisioning the desolate beach unmanned him. He shut his eyes but instead of praying for inward strength now he found he was just looking at the strange reddish dark and the little flashes and floaters in there, that got almost hypnotic when you really looked at them. Then when he opened his eyes the In tray\x{2019}s stack of files looked to be still mainly the height it had been at <<7:14|2>> when he\x{2019}d logged in in the Chalk Leader\x{2019}s notebook and started and there weren\x{2019}t enough files in his Out trays for Form 20s and 402s that he could see any over the side of the trays and he refused once more to stand up to check how many of them there were for he knew that would make it worse. He had the sensation of a great type of hole or emptiness falling through him and continuing to fall and never hitting the floor. Never before in his life up to now had he once thought of suicide. He was doing a return at the same time he fought with his mind, with the sin and affront of even the passing thought. The room was silent except for the adding machines and the chattering sound of that one kid\x{2019}s cart that had a crazy wheel as the cart boy brought it down a certain row with more files, but also he kept hearing in his head the sound a piece of paper makes when you tear it in half over and over. His six-man Chalk was a quarter of a row, separated off by the gray vinyl screens. A Team is four Chalks plus the Team Leader and a cart boy, some of these from Peoria College of Business. The screens could be moved around to reconfigure the room\x{2019}s layout. Similar rotes groups were in the rooms to either side. Far to the left past three other Chalks\x{2019} rows was the Group Manager\x{2019}s office with the AGM\x{2019}s little cubicle of screens to the side of it. The pinkie rubbers were for traction on the forms for all deliberate speed. You were supposed to save the rubber at the end of the day. The overhead lights cast no shadow, even of your hand if you held it out like you were reaching at a tray. Doug and Amber Bellman of 402 Elk Court, Edina MN, who itemized and then some, elected to have \$1 go to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund. It took several minutes to crosscheck everything on Schedule A but nothing qualified for the specs of a promising audit, even though Mr. Bellman had the jaggedy handwriting of a crazy man. Lane Dean had filed far fewer 20s than protocol called for. On Friday he had the fewest 20s of anyone else in the Chalk. Nobody\x{2019}d said anything. All the wastebaskets were full of the curled strips of paper from the adding machines. Everyone\x{2019}s faces were the color of wet lead in the fluorescent light. You could make a semiprivate cubicle out of the screens like the Team Leader had. Then he looked up despite all best prior intentions. In four minutes it would be another hour, a half hour after that was the fifteen-minute break. Lane Dean imagined himself running around on the break waving his arms and shouting gibberish and holding ten cigarettes at once in his mouth like a panpipe. Year after year, a face the same color as your desk. Lord Jesus. Coffee wasn\x{2019}t allowed because of spills on the files, but on the break he\x{2019}d have a big cup of coffee in each hand while he imagined himself running around the outside grounds shouting. He knew what he\x{2019}d really do on the break was sit facing the wall clock in the lounge and despite prayers and effort sit counting the seconds tick off until he had to come back and do this again. And again and again and again. The imagined sound made him remember different times he\x{2019}d seen people rip paper in half. He thought of a circus strongman tearing a phone book; he was bald and had a handlebar mustache and wore a stripy all-body swimsuit like people wore in the distant past. Lane Dean summoned all his will and bore down and did three returns in a row, and began imagining different high places to jump off of. He felt in a position to say he knew now that hell had nothing to do with fires or frozen troops. Lock a fellow in a windowless room to perform rote tasks just tricky enough to make him have to think, but still rote, tasks involving numbers that connected to nothing he\x{2019}d ever see or care about, a stack of tasks that never went down, and nail a clock to the wall where he can see it, and just leave the man there to his mind\x{2019}s own devices. Tell him to pucker his butt and think beach when he starts to get antsy, and that would be just the word they\x{2019}d use, antsy, like his mother. Let him find out in time\x{2019}s fullness what a joke the word was, that it didn\x{2019}t come anyplace close. He\x{2019}d already dusted the desk with his cuff, moved his infant son\x{2019}s photo in its rattly little frame where the front glass slid a bit if you shook it. He\x{2019}d already tried switching the green rubber over and doing the adding machine with his left hand, pretending he\x{2019}d had a stroke and was bravely soldiering on. The rubber made the pinkie\x{2019}s tip all damp and pale beneath it. Unable to sit still at home, unable to look at anything for more than a second or two. The beach now had solid cement instead of sand and the water was gray and barely moved, just quivered a little, like Jell-O that\x{2019}s almost set. Unbidden came ways to kill himself with Jell-O. Lane Dean tried to control the rate of his heartbeat. He wondered if with enough practice and concentration you could stop your heart at will the same way you hold your breath\x{2014}like this right here. His heart rate felt dangerously slow and he became scared and tried to keep his head inclined by rolling his eyes way up and compared the rate to the clock\x{2019}s second hand but the second hand seemed impossibly slow. The sound of ripping paper again and again. Some cart boys brought you files with everything you needed, some did not. The buzzer to bring a cart boy was just under the iron desk\x{2019}s edge, with a wire trailing down one of the desk\x{2019}s sides and little welded-on leg, but it didn\x{2019}t work. Atkins said the wiggler who\x{2019}d been at the station before him, who\x{2019}d got transferred someplace, had pressed on it so much it burnt the circuit. Small strange indentations in rows on the blotter\x{2019}s front edge were, Lane Dean had realized, the prints of teeth that somebody\x{2019}d bent down and pressed real carefully into the blotter\x{2019}s edge so that the indentations went way down and stayed there. He felt he could understand. It was hard to keep from smelling his finger; at home he\x{2019}d find himself doing it, staring into space at the table. His little baby boy\x{2019}s face worked better than the beach; he imagined him doing all sorts of things that he and his wife could talk about later, like curling his fist around one of their fingers or smiling when Sheri made that amazed face at him. He liked to watch her with the baby; for half a file it helped to have them in mind because they were why, they were what made this worthwhile and the right thing and he had to remember it but it kept slipping away down the hole that fell through him. Neither man on either side of him seemed to ever fidget or move except to reach up and lift things onto the desk from their Tingles\x{2019} trays, like machines, and they were never in the lounge at break. Atkins claimed that after a year he could examine and crosscheck two files at once, but you never saw him try and do it, though he could whistle one song and hum a different one. Nugent\x{2019}s sister did the exorcist on the phone. Lane Dean watched out of the corner of his eye as a parrot-faced man by the central aisle dividing Teams pulled a file out of his tray and removed the return and detached the printout and centered both documents on his blotter. With his little homemade seat cushion and gray hat on its hook screwed into the 402s tray. Lane Dean stared down without seeing his own open file and imagined being that guy with his sad little cushion and customized banker\x{2019}s lamp and wondered what he possibly had or did in his spare time to make up for these soul-murdering eight daily hours that weren\x{2019}t even a quarter through until he just couldn\x{2019}t stand it and did three returns in a row in a kind of frenzy where he might have missed things and so on the next file went very slowly and painstakingly and found a discrepancy between the 1040\x{2019}s Schedule E and the RRA annuity tables for poor old Clive R. Terry of Alton\x{2019}s pissant railroad pension, but a discrepancy so small that you couldn\x{2019}t tell if the Martinsburg printout had even made an error or had just accepted a wide roundoff for time\x{2019}s sake given the amount at stake, and he had to fill out both an 020-C and a Memo 402-C(1) kicking the return over to the Group Manager\x{2019}s office to decide how to classify the error. Both had to be filled out with duplicated data on both sides, and signed. The whole issue was almost unbelievably meaningless and small. He thought about the word meaning and tried to summon up his baby\x{2019}s face without looking at the photo but all he could get was the heft of a full diaper and the plastic mobile over his crib turning in the breeze the box fan in the doorway made. No one in either congregation ever saw The Exorcist; it was against Catholic dogma and an obscenity. It was not entertainment. He imagined that the clock\x{2019}s second hand possessed awareness and knew that it was a second hand and that its job was to go around and around inside a circle of numbers forever at the same slow unvarying machinelike rate, going no place it hadn\x{2019}t already been a million times before, and imagining the second hand was so awful it made his breath catch in his throat and he looked quickly around to see if any of the examiners around him had heard it or were looking at him. When he started to see the baby\x{2019}s photo\x{2019}s face melting and lengthening and growing a long cleft jaw and the face aging years in just seconds and finally caving in from old age and falling away from the grinning yellow skull underneath, he knew he was half asleep and dreaming but did not know his own face was in his hands until he heard a human voice and opened his eyes but couldn\x{2019}t see who it went with and then smelled the pinkie\x{2019}s rubber right under his nose. He might have drooled on the open file.",

            "Tuesday morning I had an ENT appointment and clocked in at <<10:05|2>>. The complex was even more subdued than usual. People spoke quietly and had a slight shoulder-first quality to their walk. A few of the women who were known to react to any sort of upset by becoming pale were pale. There was a quality of slow-motion milling to everybody\x{2019}s activities, as if they were all reacting to something but were aware of themselves reacting and that everybody else was reacting. I was out of aspirin. For some reason I was reluctant to ask anybody what had happened. I hate being the person who always doesn\x{2019}t know what\x{2019}s going on and has to ask somebody; it always seems like everybody else knows what\x{2019}s going on.

            "An interesting bit of trivia is that Meredith Rand actually outranks Drinion, technically, since she\x{2019}s a GS-10 and Drinion a GS-9. This even though Drinion is several orders of magnitude more effective than Rand as an examiner. Both his daily average of returns and his ratio of total returns examined to total additional revenue produced through audit are much higher than Meredith Rand\x{2019}s. The truth is that utility examiners have a harder time getting promoted, since promotions usually result from Group Managers\x{2019} recommendations, and UTEXs are rarely at <<one|3e:0>> Post or Pod long enough to develop the sort of rapport with superiors that makes the superior willing to go through the paperwork hassle of recommending someone for a promotion. Also, since utility examiners are often the best at what they do, there is a disincentive in the Service against promoting them, since at GS-15 a Service employee moves into administration and can no longer travel from Post to Post. One of the things that regular posted wigglers find mysterious about UTEXs is what motivations induce them to serve as UTEXs when the position is something of a career-killer in terms of advancement and pay raises. As of 1 July 1983, the difference between a GS-9\x{2019}s and a GS-10\x{2019}s annual salary is \$3,220 gross, which is not pocket change. Like many wigglers, Meredith Rand assumes that there\x{2019}s a certain type of basic personality that\x{2019}s maybe drawn to the constant movement and lack of attachment of being a utility examiner, plus the variety of challenges, and that Personnel has ways to test for these personality traits and so to ID certain examiners as likely UTEX candidates. There is a certain prestige or romance to the UTEX lifestyle, but part of this is married or elsewise dug-in employees\x{2019} romanticization of the unattached lifestyle of somebody who goes from Post to Post at the institutional whim of the Service, like a cowboy or mercenary. Lots of UTEXs have come to Peoria since late winter / spring \x{2019}84\x{2014}there are a variety of theories about why.",

Howard Shearwater is playing pinball, at which he\x{2019}s said to excel\x{2014}his pinball machine is the more distant one from their table, and the angle of incidence doesn\x{2019}t allow Rand to see the design or motif of the machine. The sun is not yet all the way down but the bar\x{2019}s low lights in the artificial tiki torches on the wall have come up, and the air-conditioner vents\x{2019} rate seems at least to have been cranked back a bit. As baseball fans, real Peorians tend to be equally divided between the Cubs and the Cardinals, though in this era the Cubs fans tend to keep their partisanship more to themselves.

There are different-shaped puddles of condensation on all the places that do or did have a glass, and none of these ever evaporate.

            "A moment later Toni was out around the side of the store, sheltered from the lot\x{2019}s view by the Kluckman Ice dispenser, with the plastic bag\x{2019}s top whipping and popping between her shoes as she removed a traveler\x{2019}s Kleenex from her handbag, tore it in two and again, and wrapped a quarter of the tissue tightly around her little finger, whose nail was perfect and almond-shaped and done in arterial red. Up into the right nasal cavity and around in a comprehensive spiral, and what came out included a standard-colored clot, both viscous and hard, with even a tiny thread of capillary inside the right border. The only thing someone in a store or line might remark about her was a faint affective abstraction, a quality of detachment that was not the detachment of peace or a personal relation with Our Lord Jesus Christ. Which she carefully wiped onto the left lapel of her cream-colored coat, with enough pressure to give it some length but not enough to compromise its adhesion or distort the nougat at its heart. A plasticized flatness about her reminiscent of processed air, airline food, transistorized sound. This was merely to pass the time until her order at Butts Hardware was assembled. The stockroom as she entered it had only paper goods and large cardboard boxes and borax in the floor-wall seam for roaches, and the manager\x{2019}s little office door with its snap-on pinups and Peace with Honor poster of an eagle with a ski-jump nose and <<5:00|2>> shadow was ajar and emitted Dutch Masters and the mollified twang of country on a pocket radio. The day manager, who had no nametag (the counter woman was \x{2018}Cheryl\x{2019}) and had his feet up reading just what she\x{2019}d have imagined, and who had a high convex forehead and one of those rapid and overhard blink rates like someone almost wincing when they blinked that signified something just a little neurally amiss, just a bit, swung his feet around and rose with complex squeaks of the chair as her timid knock and the force with which she all but staggered through the door spelled out all the innocent shock anyone\x{2019}d need to read in her character. She\x{2019}d drained her face of color and kept her eyes open in the wind on the way back from side to storefront, which wetted her eyes, and had her shoulders up and arms out in an attitude of speechless defilement. She appeared both smaller and larger than she really was, and the manager with the ticcy blink did not move or come around or find within himself the power to respond even during her setup, which was halting and hypoxic and sketched a scenario in which she was a frequent nay even habitual customer at this QWIK \x{2019}N\x{2019} EZ Ramp Tumor and had always received not only good value for the hard-earned money she earned taking in mending at home which as the single mother of two was all she could do, even though she\x{2019}d been trained as a legal secretary over five years of night school during the time she was nursing her blind mother through her lengthy terminal illness, not just value and gas but always cheerful and courteous service from the gals at the counter, until\x{2014}here a shudder that brought the manager, still holding the remains of a Little Debbie product in his left hand, halfway around the desk to comfort her until he saw the two-inch mess on her left lapel, which was the result of several Q-Tipless days and near-sneeze feeling and was indeed a mucal clot of sheer clock-stopping horror\x{2014}until today just now, just, she didn\x{2019}t know how to say this\x{2014}her strongest impulse had just been to drive half-blind with tears home to throw the coat that had cost months of going without to buy so she could take her two babies to church in something they didn\x{2019}t have to feel ashamed to be with into the low-income housing development\x{2019}s dumpster and spend the rest of the day praying God to help her make some sense out of the senseless violation she\x{2019}d just had happen and to avoid forever thereafter this QWIK \x{2019}N\x{2019} EZ out of degradation and horror but no, she\x{2019}d always had such good value and service at this establishment that she felt it almost her duty, however embarrassing and degrading to account, to tell him what the employee behind the cash register had done, even though it made no sense, to her least of all, who certainly looked normal and even friendly and to whom she\x{2019}d tried to be pleasant and had done nothing more than try to pay for the items she\x{2019}d elected to buy here, who had, while she\x{2019}d reached for her change and while looking her steadily in the eye had, had, with the other hand put her finger up her nose and then reached out and\x{2026} and\x{2026} here giving way completely to sobs and a kind of high-pitched keening sound and looking down at the lapel of a coat she gave the impression of somehow trying to back away from in horror as if the only reason she hadn\x{2019}t already taken off the green-dolloped coat was that she couldn\x{2019}t bear to take it off, feeling the clonic blinks upon the wad to note even the thread of red blood that made it more ghastly, then turning to stagger out as if too upset to continue or press for redress, lurching out until the transistor\x{2019}s song of whiskey and loss had receded and she was back in the bleached light of the store itself, the sound of her heels in the aisle and lot rapid and satisfying as the counter woman\x{2019}s wave and farewell-till-next-time receded unacknowledged and the manager stood there working his way from the shock to outrage and the boys silent and docile as gargoyles in the back even as she leapt into the car and all but peeled out, in case the manager had made it out front yet which she doubted, fishtailing onto the Frontage Road with such hysteric force that one dog was thrown into another, steadying herself with a right arm against the bag of bricks, half-humming the country tune\x{2019}s refrain, coat defiled and already half off one shoulder, mailbox-bound.",
