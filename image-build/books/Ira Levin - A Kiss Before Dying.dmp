First she asked for a pair of stockings, but because of a rush of business for the Spring Dance scheduled for the following night, they were out of her size. She then asked for gloves, and bought a pair for \$1.50. She was wearing them when she died, yet in the bureau in her room was a beautiful pair of hand-made white cloth gloves, perfectly spotless, that Marion had given her the previous Christmas.

While he was occupied with the wine card and \x{2018}If I may suggest, Monsieur\x{2019}, Marion freed the box of its gold entanglement, excitement colouring her cheeks and shining her eyes. Nested between layers of cotton was a golden disc, its surface constellated with tiny pearls.
