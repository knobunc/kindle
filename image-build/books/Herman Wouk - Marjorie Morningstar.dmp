            "Marjorie\x{2019}s mother looked in on her sleeping daughter at <<half past ten|10>> of a Sunday morning with feelings of puzzlement and dread. She disapproved of everything she saw. She disapproved of the expensive black silk evening dress crumpled on a chair, the pink frothy underwear thrown on top of the dress, the stockings like dead snakes on the floor, the brown wilting gardenias on the desk. Above all she disapproved of the beautiful seventeen-year-old girl lying happily asleep on a costly oversize bed in a square of golden sunlight, her hair a disordered brown mass of curls, her red mouth streaked with cracking purplish paint, her breathing peaceful and regular through her fine little nose. Marjorie was recovering from a college dance. She looked sweetly innocent asleep; but her mother feared that this picture was deceptive, remembering drunken male laughter in the foyer at <<3 A.M.|5>>, and subdued girlish giggles, and tiptoeing noises past her bedroom. Marjorie\x{2019}s mother did not get much sleep when her daughter went to a college dance. But she had no thought of trying to stop her; it was the way boys met girls nowadays. College dances had formed no part of the courtship manners of her own girlhood, but she tried to move with the times. She sighed, took the dying flowers to try to preserve them in the refrigerator, and went out, softly closing the door.",

Seth was studying for his part in the ceremony as he did everything else nowadays\x{2014}efficiently, thoroughly, and with ease. He had to learn a number of prayers, and a long reading from a prophetic book in a bizarre chant, and he was constantly practicing aloud. Sometimes a tutor came and chanted with him, sometimes in the evening Mr. Morgenstern chimed in, and all three discordantly bayed the melody. Marjorie heard the chant so often that she came to know it by heart. She was vexed to catch herself chanting as she walked along the street. With an effort of the will she would change over to Gilbert and Sullivan. Marjorie had had desultory Hebrew lessons as a girl, but at <<twelve|9c:1>>, to her great rejoicing, she had been permitted to discontinue them. She had always been bored by the thick black letters that had to be read backward. Her Bible lessons had made her yawn until the tears ran. All of it had seemed an echo of the Stone Age, no more a part of the world of movies, boys, ice cream, and lipstick than the dinosaur skeletons in the museum. Seth, however, had taken to Hebrew from the first and had done well with it, though otherwise he had been a plain street boy, grimy and wild, concerned mainly with ball games, candy, baseball scores, black eyes, and bloody noses.",

It was taking on more and more the sound of her normal inner voice, the familiar vigilant friend of a lifetime whose job it was to suggest that it was time to eat, or that the yellow dress would be more becoming than the green, or that she had better freshen her lipstick.

She could have an affair with a leprous Chinaman at <<high noon|13>> in the middle of the Place de la Concorde. I\x{2019}d just stand by and cheer. This time next week I\x{2019}ll be out of here, bag and baggage. The fact is, I\x{2019}ve been thinking of going to the Mozart myself. Wouldn\x{2019}t that be cosy, dear?\x{2014}Christ, get that disapproving look off your face, Gerda has simply been a convenience. The fact is she actually started out as my landlady. It couldn\x{2019}t have been more platonic. I was to have the living room to myself and one bedroom. I was paying her, and paying a damn good rent, too. But of course all she ever had in mind when she offered the place to me was my fair white body, that soon became obvious. What do you do when you\x{2019}re behind on your rent and broke, and your landlady comes creeping into your room making fond little noises? Believe me, I\x{2019}ve kept it as antiseptic as possible, Margie, I\x{2019}ve been dry, distant, cold, you can\x{2019}t imagine how cold I\x{2019}ve been. That\x{2019}s actually why I\x{2019}ve been doing the cooking. From my viewpoint I\x{2019}m more than contributing my share to the m\x{e9}nage and I can be as distant with her as I damn please. What\x{2019}s the difference whether the man owns the apartment and the woman cooks or the other way around? It\x{2019}s all convention. I happen to be a mighty good cook and I enjoy doing it, and from my viewpoint I\x{2019}m completely independent here. Gertie\x{2019}s put on twenty pounds from my cooking. Not that that\x{2019}s been so good for her, she\x{2019}s a Big Bertha to start with, but it does show that she\x{2019}s been getting value for her two ratty rooms. I don\x{2019}t think she\x{2019}s eaten so well since she was born. Do have another drink.\x{201d}",

Cabs were crawling in a jam on the square, backing, turning, honking, and there were a lot of laughing and singing drifters on the sidewalks. The drizzle had almost stopped. A half-moon shone weakly through rolling black clouds, making irregular blue patches on the wet stones. Noel stood with his hands on his hips, looking around the square. His hair was tumbled every which way; his eyes glittered. Marjorie had merely sipped all the marvelous liquors, but he had had plenty to drink. \x{201c}Well now, the question is, how much pep have you left?\x{201d} he said. \x{201c}This can go on all night and then some.

She was regretting the impulse that had led her to call him up; she had in fact been regretting it ever since she hung up the receiver, disagreeably suspecting him of condescending to her. What was she doing, really? Was she trying to change things between them at this late date and get him to marry her, now that he was a success? It was nothing so definite or so stupid. She wasn\x{2019}t at all sure how she would feel when she saw him.

Obviously he had been polite to her on the phone and then had completely forgotten the date.

There were blazing blue-white arc lights, a movie photographer, and a still photographer. There was a rose-strewn staircase for her to descend; there was a quite meaningless but quite gorgeous archway with gates at the head of the staircase, covered and festooned with pink roses, through which she was to make her entrance. There were banks of gold chairs, five hundred of them, jammed solid with guests, and with spectators who had read the announcement in the Times and knew the bridegroom or the bride.
