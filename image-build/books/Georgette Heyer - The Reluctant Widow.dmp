A slight sound, as of a creaking stair, made her start. She realised that all had been silent in the house for a long time, and had certainly supposed that the servants must long since have gone up to bed.

A glance at the grate, to assure herself that there was no danger of the smouldering remnant of the log\x{2019}s falling out to set the house on fire, and she snuffed the candles in the chandelier, and walked over to the door.
