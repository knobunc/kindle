He stood up in the stern and pointed; the man in the M-30 raised a hand in thanks and steered towards the wharf. A lone sailor who was not going to bother starting up the engine, Blomkvist noticed.

In April 1960, the 46-year-old farmer\x{2019}s wife was found murdered in the family\x{2019}s barn. The reporter Claes Gunnars describes the last hours of her life and the fruitless search for the killer. The murder caused a great stir at the time, and many theories have been presented about who the guilty party was. A young relative will appear on the show to talk about how his life was destroyed when he was accused of the murder. <<8:00 p.m.|2a>>",

The second item on her checklist was to make an appointment at the beauty salon in the lobby of a significantly more expensive hotel for <<6:30 that morning|2a>>. She bought another blonde wig, this one in a page-boy style, and then she had a manicure, getting pink nails attached to her own chewed ones. She also got false eyelashes, more powder, rouge, and finally lipstick and other make-up. No change from 8,000 kronor.',

            "<<Just after 9:00|2>> she walked two blocks to the venerable Zimmertal Hotel, where she booked a room in Monica Sholes\x{2019} name. She gave a generous tip to a boy who carried up her suitcase (which contained her travel bag). The suite was a small one, costing 22,000 kronor a day. She had booked it for one night. When she was alone she took a look around. She had a dazzling view of Lake Z\x{fc}rich, which didn\x{2019}t interest her in the least. But she did spend close to five minutes examining herself in the mirror. She saw a total stranger. Big-busted Monica Sholes in a blonde page-boy wig, wearing more make-up than Lisbeth Salander dreamed of using in a whole month. She looked\x{2026}different.",
