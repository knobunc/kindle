            'Males, then, seem to be pretty worthless fellows, and on simple \'good of the species\' grounds, we might expect that males would become less numerous than females. Since one male can theoretically produce enough sperms to service a harem of 100 females we might suppose that females should outnumber males in animal populations by <<100|3:0>> to <<1|20a>>. Other ways of putting this are that the male is more \'expendable\', and the female more \'valuable\' to the species. Of course, looked at from the point of view of the species as a whole, this is perfectly true. To take an extreme example, in one study of elephant seals, 4 per cent of the males accounted for 88 per cent of all the copulations observed. In this case, and in many others, there is a large surplus of bachelor males who probably never get a chance to copulate in their whole lives. But these extra males live otherwise normal lives, and they eat up the population\'s food resources no less hungrily than other adults. From a \'good of the species\' point of view this is horribly wasteful; the extra males might be regarded as social parasites. This is just one more example of the difficulties that the group selection theory gets into. The selfish gene theory, on the other hand, has no trouble in explaining the fact that the numbers of males and females tend to be equal, even when the males who actually reproduce may be a small fraction of the total number. The explanation was first offered by R. A. Fisher.',

This time, the exact number of moves per game was not fixed at <<200|3:0>> but was left open, for a good reason that I shall come to later. We can still express scores as a percentage of the \'benchmark\', or \'always cooperate\' score, even though that benchmark needs more complicated calculation and is no longer a fixed 600 points.',

            'Intelligent life on a planet comes of age when it first works out the reason for its own existence. If superior creatures from space ever visit earth, the first question they will ask, in order to assess the level of our civilization, is: \'Have they discovered evolution yet?\' Living organisms had existed on earth, without ever knowing why, for over three thousand million years before the truth finally dawned on one of them. His name was Charles Darwin. To be fair, others had had inklings of the truth, but it was Darwin who first put together a coherent and tenable account of why we exist. Darwin made it possible for us to give a sensible answer to the curious child whose question heads this chapter. We no longer have to resort to superstition when faced with the deep problems: Is there a meaning to life.\' What are we for? What is man? After posing the last of these questions, the eminent zoologist G. G. Simpson put it thus: \'The point I want to make now is that all attempts to answer that question <<before 1859|18:0>> are worthless and that we will be better off if we ignore them completely.\'',

            'Incidentally, a thing that is sometimes not realized even by people who worry about population problems is that population growth depends on when people have children, as well as on how many they have. Since populations tend to increase by a certain proportion per generation, it follows that if you space the generations out more, the population will grow at a slower rate per year. Banners that read \'Stop at <<Two|9c:1>>\' could equally well be changed to \'Start at Thirty\'! But in any case, accelerating population growth spells serious trouble.',
