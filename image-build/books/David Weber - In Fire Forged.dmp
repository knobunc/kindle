            'The stage was now set for an arms development race that has continued for the last seven hundred years. Military spacecraft designers devised increasingly effective ways to deceive, destroy, or block the attacking missiles. Weapon designers invented increasingly effective seekers, sidewall penetrators, and warheads. The evolutionary development over the period between <<about 1300|18:0>> and 1800 was sometimes punctuated by bursts of revolutionary activity that introduced competing technologies on both sides of the offensive/defensive divide. The development of the inertial compensator in 1412 allowed larger starships which could carry more massive multilayered armor on their outer skins. The new armor reduced attacking energy in stages and was the first practical scheme capable of withstanding the detonation of contact nukes within several hundred meters of the hull. The damage from near misses was still enormous but the core of the ship protected vital systems and spaces from the worst effects and allowed it to continue to fight. Weapon designers responded by steadily increasing warhead yields until they reached the limit of the age old fission, fission-fusion, and fission-fusion-fission nuclear device technologies.',

            "Though retained, \x{201c}boom\x{201d} settings were rarely useful, so missile designers seeking ways to increase sidewall burning effectiveness kept trying for longer standoff range. The development of another generation of powerful practical micronized grav generators marked the next evolutionary step in missile warfare in 1806 with the introduction of the first nuclear gravitically directed energy weapon (NGDEW). The key components were grav lens arrays derived from those that had dramatically increased shipboard laser/graser effectiveness roughly fifty years earlier. The very first of these arrays was called a \x{201c}plate array\x{201d} and simply reflected the bomb\x{2019}s energy off a flat artificial grav wave similar to an impeller or sidewall behind the warhead. Research continually tightened the focus of the grav arrays as impeller missile standoff ranges grew from tens of hundreds to tens of thousands of kilometers over the ensuing decades. The early grav lens arrays were quite large, however, and frequently displaced the sidewall penetrators until further refinements could reduce their sizes. By <<1826|9e:1>>, a state of the art RMN impeller drive nuclear armed missile could boast a standoff range of 8,000 to 10,000 kilometers in sidewall burning mode.",

            "The author begins with the photon wavelength. One might as well use frequency or energy because they are all mathematically equivalent but weapons designers fairly consistently use wavelength. Early space energy weapons used photons in the ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and even the radio range. These wavelengths are impractical to focus at contemporary combat ranges so modern weapons use shorter wavelength photons in the X-ray to gamma ray range. Indeed, modern space weapon lasers are so commonly X-ray lasers that the term \x{201c}laser\x{201d} is generally synonymous with \x{201c}xraser\x{201d} in naval parlance. Their rarer gamma emitting cousins are called \x{201c}grasers.\x{201d} Both of these words have their obvious origin with the ancient \x{201c}laser\x{201d} though the fact that many such weapons do not operate on the principle of \x{201c}stimulated emission\x{201d} is generally forgotten. Confusion sometimes results because different scientific and engineering communities have different definitions of exactly what constitutes the cutoff between X and gamma rays. An astronomer\x{2019}s X-ray might be a particle beam engineer\x{2019}s gamma ray and so on. There appears little hope at this writing of ever clearing this up completely. This article uses the terminology of the Interstellar Association of Astronautical Engineers that a photon with a wavelength greater than one picometer (10 meters) is an X-ray and light with a wavelength shorter than that is a gamma ray. This value was chosen because <<one pm|5>> is a good cutoff point when discussing armor and weapons effects. This is because light begins to exhibit deep penetrating characteristics in common spacecraft materials for wavelengths shorter than this so that a graser cannon operating at 0.1 picometers damages a target in different ways than a laser at 10 picometers.",
