Returning to the yearly round, each of the five seasons is divided, of course, into five months, thus producing a year of 5 \x{d7} 5 or 25 months. The first three months of every season (known as the tricycle) each have 15 days, which fits the law of five because 1 \x{d7} 5 = 5. The last two months of each season each have 14 days, which also fits the law of fives because 1 + 4 = 5. Each season has 73 days, because (a) you have to get 73 when you divide 365 by 5; (b) 7 + 3 = 10, the first multiple of <<5 after 5|10>> itself; and (c) this corresponds, as Dr. Ignotius pointed out in the novel, to the 73 parts of the Illuminati pyramid (counting the Eye as a part). The last day of each season is known as Eye Day and is celebrated in ways too foul to be mentioned in a book such as this, intended for family entertainment.",

Since it pleased Allah to decree this task for them, they obeyed willingly; many served thus for their whole lives. Some, however, <<after five|9:0>> or ten or even twenty years of such fealty to a given shah or caliph or king, would receive, through surreptitious channels, a parchment bearing the symbol:  That night, the servant would strike, and disappear like smoke; and the master would be found in the morning, throat cut, with the emblematic Flame Dagger of the Ishmaelians lying beside him. Others were chosen to serve in a different manner, maintaining the palace of Hassan i Sabbah himself at Alamout. These were especially fortunate, for it was their privilege to visit more often than others the Garden of Delights, in which the Lord Hassan himself would, through his command of magic chemicals, transfer them into heaven while they still lived in the body. One day in the year 470 (known to the uncircumcized Christian dogs as 1092 a.d.) another proof of the Lord Hassan\x{2019}s powers was given to them, for they were all summoned to the throne room and there sat the Lord Hassan in all his glory, while before him on the floor lay a plate bearing the head of the disciple Ibn Azif.",

The Tribunal affected most fantastic forms of procedure: the guilty person, cited to appear at some discredited cross-road, was taken to the assembly by a man clothed in black, who bandaged his eyes and led him forward in silence. This occurred invariably at some unseemly hour of the night, for judgment was never pronounced except at <<midnight|13>>.

Death, according to the police laboratory, did not result from drowning but from beating about the head and shoulders with a square-ended object. The first inquiries by homicide detectives revealed that Oedipuski had been a member of God\x{2019}s Lightning and the theory was formed that a conflict between the dead man and his former colleagues might have resulted in his being snuffed with their wooden crosses. Further investigation revealed that Oedipuski had been a construction worker and until very recently well liked on his job, behaving in a normal, down-to-earth manner, bitching about the government, cursing the lazy bums on Welfare, hating niggers, shouting obscene remarks at good-looking dolls who passed construction sites and\x{2014}when the odds were safely above the <<8-to-1|10a:0>> level\x{2014}joining other middle-aged workers in attacking and beating young men with long hair, peace buttons, or other un-American stigmata. Then, about a month before, all that had changed. He began bitching about the bosses as well as the government\x{2014}almost sounding like a communist at times; when somebody else cussed the crumb-bums on Welfare, Stan remarked thoughtfully, \x{201c}Well, you know, our union keeps them from getting jobs, fellows, so what else can they do but go on Welfare? Steal?\x{201d} He even said once, when some of the guys were good-humoredly giving the finger and making other gallant noises and signals toward a passing eighteen-year-old girl, \x{201c}Hey, you know, that might really be embarrassing and scaring her \x{2026}!\x{201d} Worse yet, his own hair begun to grow surprisingly long in the back, and his wife told friends that he didn\x{2019}t look at TV much anymore but instead sat in a chair most evenings reading books.

You know, that long ride without stops when you\x{2019}re totally in the dark and everything seems to be rushing by outside in the opposite direction? Relativity, the laboratory-smock people call it. In fact, it was even more like going up a chimney than going forward in a tunnel, but it was like both at the same time, if you follow me. Relativity. A bitter-looking old man went by, dressed in turn-of-the-century Yankee clothing, muttering something about \x{201c}Carcosa.\x{201d} An antique Pontiac car followed him, with four Italians in it looking confused\x{2014}it was slow enough for me to spot the year, definitely 1936, and even to read the license plates, Rhode Island AW-1472. Then a black man, not a Negro or a wog, but a really truly black man, without a face and I\x{2019}d hate to tell you what he had where the face should have been. All the while, there was this bleating or squealing that seemed to say \x{201c}Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!\x{201d} Another man, English-looking but in early 19th-century clothing; he looked my way, surprised, and said, \x{201c}I only walked around the horses!\x{201d} I could sympathize: I only opened a bleeding door. A giant beetle, who looked at me more intelligently than any bug I ever saw before\x{2014}he seemed to be going in a different direction, if there was direction in this place. A white-haired old man with startling blue eyes, who shouted \x{201c}Roderick Usher!\x{201d} as he flew by. Then a whole parade of pentagons and other mathematical shapes that seemed to be talking to each other in some language of the past or the future or wherever they called home. And by now it wasn\x{2019}t so much like a tunnel or even a chimney but a kind of roller coaster with dips and loops but not the sort you find in a place like Brighton\x{2014}I think I saw this kind of curve once, on a blackboard, when a class in non-Euclidean geometry had used the room before my own class in Eng Lit Pope to Swinb and Neo-Raph. Then I passed a shoggoth or it passed me, and let me say that their pictures simply do not do them justice: I am ready to go anywhere and confront any peril on H.M. Service but I pray to the Lord Harry I never have to get that close to one of those chaps again. Next came a jerk, or cusp is probably the word: I recognized something: Ingolstadt, the middle of the university. Then we were off again, but not for long, another cusp: Stone-henge. A bunch of hooded people, right out of a Yank movie about the KKK, were busy with some gruesome mummery right in the center of the stones, yelling ferociously about some ruddy goat with a thousand young, and the stars were all wrong overhead. Well, you pick up your education where you can\x{2014}now I know, even if I can\x{2019}t tell any bloody academic how I know, that Stonehenge is much older than we think. Whizz, bang, we\x{2019}re off again, and now ships are floating by\x{2014}everything from old Yankee clippers to modern luxury liners, all of them signaling the old S.O.S. semaphore desperately\x{2014}and a bunch of airplanes following in their wake. I realized that part must be the Bermuda Triangle, and about then it dawned that the turn-of-the-century Yank with the bitter face might be Ambrose Bierce. I still hadn\x{2019}t the foggiest who all those other chaps were. Then along came a girl, a dog, a lion, a tin man and a scarecrow. A real puzzler, that: was I visiting real places or just places in people\x{2019}s minds? Or was there a difference? When the mock turtle, the walrus, the carpenter and another little girl came along, my faith in the difference began to crumble. Or did some of those writer blokes know how to tap into this alternate world or fifth dimension or whatever it was? The shoggoth came by again (or was it his twin brother?) and shouted, or I should say, gibbered, \x{201c}Yog Sothoth Neblod Zin,\x{201d} and I could tell that was something perfectly filthy by the tone of his voice, I mean, after all, I can take a queer proposition without biffing the offender on the nose\x{2014}one must be cosmopolitan, you know\x{2014}but I would vastly prefer to have such offers coming out of human mouths, or at the very least out of mouths rather than orifices that shouldn\x{2019}t properly be talking at all. But you would have to see a shoggoth yourself, God forbid, to appreciate what I mean. The next stop was quite a refrigerator, miles and miles of it, and that\x{2019}s where the creature who kept up that howling of \x{201c}Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!\x{201d} hung his hat. Or its hat. I shan\x{2019}t attempt to do him, or it, justice. That Necronomicon said about Yog Sothoth that \x{201c}Kadath in the cold waste hath known him,\x{201d} and now I realized that \x{201c}known\x{201d} was used there in the Biblical sense. I just hope he, or it, stays in the cold waste. You wouldn\x{2019}t want to meet him, or it, on the Strand at <<midday|13>>, believe me. His habits were even worse than his ancestry, and why he couldn\x{2019}t scrape off some of the seaweed and barnacles is beyond me; he was rather like Saint Toad in his notions of sartorial splendor and table etiquette, if you take my meaning. But I was off again, the curvature was getting sharper and the cusps more frequent. There was no mistaking the Heads where I arrived next: Easter Island. I had a moment to reflect on how those Heads resembled Tlaloc and the lloigor of Fernando Poo and then this kink\x{2019}s version of a Cook\x{2019}s Tour moved on, and there I was at the last stop.",

I discovered at <<two this morning|9a>> that several people in our Anthrax Leprosy Pi project have accidentally been subjected to live cultures. All of them are living at the installation, and can easily be isolated while the antidote works. I have already given orders to that effect. Dr. Mocenigo himself unknowingly received the worst dose, and was in advanced morbidity, a few minutes from death, when I arrived. His whole house, obviously, will have to be burned down, and I am also, due to my proximity while examining him, too far gone to be saved. I will therefore shoot myself after setting fire to the house. There is one remaining problem. I found evidence that a woman had been in Dr. Mocenigo\x{2019}s bed earlier\x{2014}that\x{2019}s what comes of allowing important people to live off base\x{2014}and she must be found and given the antidote and each of her contacts must be traced. Needless to say, this must be done quietly, or there will be a nationwide panic. Tell the President to see that my wife gets the medal for this. Tell my wife that with my last breath I still insist she was wrong about that girl in Red Lion, Pennsylvania. In closing, I firmly believe that this is the greatest country in the history of the world, and can still be saved if Congress will lock up those damned college kids for once and for all. God bless America!\x{201d} There was a scratching sound\x{2014}my God!
