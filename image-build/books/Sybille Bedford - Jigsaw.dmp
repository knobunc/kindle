            "So I had the time, the place, the people. Where was I? How plausibly could I insert myself, full-fledged, into a somewhat complex milieu in meridional France at the age of about sixteen? Who was I, where had I come from? I needed provenance, an identity. Which must mean trotting out my short and recent past. I had little desire to go into what passes as my childhood. I had never been much interested in myself as a child per se, moreover I had already used tales that had come my way in a previous novel in which I had also tried to construct and interpret my own father\x{2019}s nature and life to the best not of my knowledge but of my imagination perhaps, plus guesswork. He had died when I was so very young; was there anything more to learn? Could I or should I invoke him again? (I often dream about him \x{2013} sad, puzzled, remorseful dreams, where he is a lonely, hurt, forgiving man whose existence I, long grown-up myself, have ignored throughout the years, as callous as the unfeeling child I had been.) Then, quite suddenly, wide awake, I realised that I had thought and written only about what he may have been as a boy, as a young man, both scarred and spoiled, as the man in his marriages, in his role of a prisoner, the kept son-in-law, of the innocent tied to public scandal; what I had not done was recall our life, the actual, utterly isolated life of his last years that he and I led together in rather eccentric circumstances of ungenteel poverty in quite grand surroundings in the depth of the county. I was <<about seven|3b>> when it began, he must have turned sixty, I believe (children did not ask their parents\x{2019} age in those days), still very handsome, still well turned out \x{2013} those pre-1914 suits and shirts last for ever \x{2013} and as I have said; isolated, cut off, alone. He saw no friends, no women. The house, in those parts called a ch\x{e2}teau (twenty bedrooms, a considerable collection of Renaissance furniture and objets d\x{2019}art, one bath), contained three inhabitants: a stranded man of the world; a bewildered, later acquiescent, somewhat know-all child; an elderly, good-hearted, deeply religious, hard-working village woman. The reason for all this was simple \x{2013} no money. That had gone, radically so, when my mother left. It was her money and she had bought the ch\x{e2}teau for her husband, my father, and let him keep it. That was a generous deed. It created a somewhat paradoxical situation \x{2013} candles instead of electricity bills, masculine cast-offs (children\x{2019}s clothes do not last), claret in the cellar and at table but no cash for butcher\x{2019}s meat. (Hence decades into my adult life I would choose sirloin steak rather than Elizabeth David\x{2019}s gratin of courgettes.) The complete true tableau of my almost prehistoric origins appeared to me quite suddenly one evening in a public place, at dinner, with friends, noise, conversation, flooding over me, wine making thought glide on \x{2026} \x{2018}This could be told, this is how one could make a book begin; \x{201c}Antecedent: Germany\x{201d}.\x{2019} Next morning I did begin. The substance was flowing as though it was already on film; as ever, alas, I had to look after the words.",

Word had gone round: Rendez-vous \x{e0} la Brasserie de Strasbourg. It was the  after-theatre supper place in Toulon, and renowned for its choucroute  garnie.

He despised games, or so he said (he would have looked ungodlike  beside Philippe). He was a painter or trying to become one, and the son  of a Parisian family much connected with the arts who were, according to  Sanary gossip, not over-pleased with him at present. His name was  Louis. Oriane had found him a cabanon in the back country, an  abandoned goatherd\x{2019}s hut, and rigged it up as a studio and a place to  camp in. For a part of each day he was banished there, and from her  presence. For the rest of the time he was seen following the Desmirails  wherever they went, looking out of the back of their cars, a pace or two  behind them when they walked. Sanary was delighted about him and the  situation. They called him the cavaliere servente, the cicisbeo, the amant en titre; some said it (the situation) was a m\x{e9}nage \x{e0} trois, others that Philippe was a cuckold, others a complaisant husband, still others that Oriane was an allumeuse  who kept the poor boy dangling. (These speculations came to us by way  of Madame Panigon who was unable to decide which version pleased her  most.) What was evident was that Louis, in spite of Alessandro\x{2019}s dictum  that she had no sex appeal, was besotted about Oriane and only took his  eyes off her to scowl at anyone who dared to do the same. He was a  dark-faced young god who would have bitten as soon as barked; Oriane  kept him in bounds. What she felt was not known, what she made evident  was that he was her property, public property at that. (People  did pause and stare when these three miraculously handsome people  passed.) What happened in private \x{2013} Louis, twenty? <<twenty-one|9k:0>>? was a  consenting adult \x{2013} one could guess at, no more.

That the dilemma does not  arise in the Midi as everyone eats garlic did not deter him from  this precept. A deeper reason for his gastronomic reticence was, I  thought, his post-war recoil from some forms of Frenchness, a protest  against his compatriots\x{2019} pantagruelism. The protest included wine. The  Desmirails drank water at their table, Evian or Vittel.

What with the changes brought by the end of the war and the setting up of the Weimar Republic, he saw himself surrounded by an almost entirely hostile environment. Monarchy with its concomitants of courts and protocol was if dull \x{2013} at some early point in his life he had done his stint as ADC \x{2013} of the natural order of things: it was safe. My mother\x{2019}s defection did not help; nor did our poverty, our being ruined he called it. He felt himself betrayed by her, by his parents-in-law, by the times, by social forces he could neither understand nor name. And by me, God help me. (Are all young children unregenerate creatures? Incapable of moral responses? responses of the heart? Can these be awakened? Mine were not. I was unregenerate and self-absorbed.) What about that poverty of ours? Was it real? Or was it self-protection? Was it relative? I think it must have been all three, and at any rate very bitter for a man in his sixties who had been brought up not exactly to money but to the sweetness of life. (In a moderate, very civilised way: not for him the Merz opulence; his taste was too good, his fastidiousness too great, in their house he held himself aloof like a prisoner of honour at the victor\x{2019}s banquet.) The little money he had inherited he went through early, afterwards the money came from his wives. When the first one died, the Merzes made him an allowance which continued after he married my mother. Now, my mother was gone and Grandpapa Merz was dead. He had died in his nineties at Voss Strasse before the end of the war \x{2013} I was there: a death in the house. The Merzes had been believed to be very rich but the old man had long ceased to look after his affairs and when he was gone there was barely enough left for Grandmama\x{a0}to carry on in that huge house: my father, like many other of their pensioners, was left out in the cold. He still had Feldkirch (bought by my mother) and his collection of objects, to these he was enslaved, the house was a necessary setting to contain them. Were they beautiful? What he was after, ever since he began as a young man to stalk the sales-rooms, were craftsmanship, rarity, decorative quality, not art. He had bought few paintings, and he spurned anything much <<after 1600|18:0>>. Here too he indulged a gloomy, even macabre trend. Gothic carvings, altar vessels, mediaeval chests, rows of pewter mugs, fifteenth-century bronzes, Renaissance chairs, fragments of tapestries \x{2013} we lived inside a museum, one that nobody came to see.

And, pray, what had been my faith? That of a Roman Catholic savage. Rather less enlightened, if anything, as my missionaries had been peasant women. They inserted into my mind a farrago of hell fire, niceties of ritual and mortal sin; they told me horror stories about the nun who broke her vows and the boy who swallowed a morsel of breakfast before taking communion. I heard little about the mercy of God and man\x{2019}s potential virtue. I heard about sin and the consequences of sin \x{2013} eternal damnation. I was able to grasp a logical if frightening system; something about its cut-and-driedness, its absolutism, even appealed to me. I liked order. (Though order permits less choices.) It was clear what one must not do. The Ten Commandments, the Seven Capital Sins, the Five Commandments of the Church. It was the latter which loomed large. The general Commandments were rather outside a child\x{2019}s range \x{2013} murder, idolatry, taking another man\x{2019}s wife; while lying and stealing, we were told, were venial not mortal sins. The Capital Sins were too abstract, only the Church Commandments were workaday enough. Two of them, the obligation to attend mass on Sundays and to abstain from meat on Fridays had worried me already at Voss Strasse in Berlin at a time of whole if private faith. As it never occurred to anyone in that Judaic-Agnostic household to take me to any form of worship and as I was plainly not yet of an age to go anywhere on my own, omitting mass could not be so very bad: the responsibility was not mine. But the\x{a0}Friday meat! Here I should have stood up and refused in public, but I was not of the stuff of martyrs and confessors. So I hid the contents of the delicate chicken sandwich that was sent up to me for my <<elevenses|13>> and spirited the cutlet off my tray; the difficulty in the town-bound house without dog or cats was ultimate disposal. I had to retrieve the meat next day from its hiding places and swallow it myself. Now back at Feldkirch I had more serious reasons for feeling at odds with my religion: I was told that divorced people go to hell. My father and mother were divorced now, so much was at last acknowledged. Did they know about the consequences of their action?

There weren\x{2019}t dozens of children, just two girls at home between schools, Marjory and Joan, big girls in their teens, older than I, younger than Doris. You\x{2019}re a foreigner, they said. I don\x{2019}t know, I answered. They lost interest. (Hadn\x{2019}t much to begin with.) Meals were worlds apart from any I\x{2019}d known, twice as many meals as there were in Italy. They were what they were sixty years ago before quiche, kebab and pasta had become ubiquitous in the land \x{2013} breakfast off the sideboard (this I found splendid), another big spread at <<four p.m.|5>>, main meals a steady rotation; after wishy-washy soup and a bit of fish, beef and mutton, hot joint, cold joint, mince, cutlets, hot joint, cold joint \x{2013} pickles, bottled sauces, dispirited salads, custards, vegetables that were about par with Feldkirch cookery and puddings that were much better. Drink was water, soda water or barley water. Tea was offered again at bedtime. There were morning prayers and these made me feel odd. Was\x{a0}the family Church of England? Now I think they may well have been something more strict and narrow, then it didn\x{2019}t occur to me that there were niceties in heresy; if I had lapsed from my religion, its teachings still told me to recognise no other. No one asked me questions. This may have been a way to make me feel at home. Jack\x{2019}s mother-in-law had given him the use of the garden-room as a studio (this was regarded as indulgence), and he asked me to sit for him; he needed a child for a large composition. When I wasn\x{2019}t sitting I was encouraged to work the pianola \x{2013} much more enjoyable \x{2013} as Jack liked music while he worked. For the rest of the time I seem to have been trotting after Marjory and Joan on their not unpleasant round of following an aunt leaving orders at the grocer\x{2019}s and the greengrocer\x{2019}s, changing library books at Boots, taking turns for fetching grandad from the works in the pony trap. Did it really happen? Did people ever live as they do in an E. F. Benson or an Agatha Christie novel? On Wednesday afternoons we went to the cinema, and, casually, miraculously, there was tennis! Tennis with a live opponent on an actual court. Contrary to my early aspirations I never got any good at it at all.",

            "I had come by way of Paris, a stopover not attempted before. So the first time I put foot in France, after a sleepy queasy transfer from boat to train, was on the pavement outside the Gare du Nord. I did not kiss the ground; I found a bus to take me to the Gare de Lyon. The female conductor was unamiable about my suitcase, which couldn\x{2019}t have been large. Having left it at the cloakroom, I had the day before me (from <<noon|13>> that was until the last night-train South). I still remember how I spent it and still blush. What did Ernest Hemingway, James Joyce, and Gertrude Stein feel on their first day in Paris, France? I cringe, for I felt nothing very much. But then these illustrious expatriates had not stepped off the quick green omnibus at the Place de la Madeleine at the age of fifteen and a half. That was where I started. I was not impressed and wondered if I should have been. Nor did I know what to make of the unfamiliar fa\x{e7}ades of the Grands Boulevards, the slate-grey straightness, the compound gusts of smells:\x{a0}open pissoirs with tin screens like fire-guards being prominent and numerous. I ate a hurried lunch at a prix fixe and trotted off again. My mother had told me to go to the Tuileries, stand in the Place du Carrousel and look at La Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe beyond. This I did, and the nobility of the perspectives, evidence that the theme contrapuntal to French easeful dailiness is La Gloire, left me not entirely unvisited by a sense of grandeur.

We used little brown cones, Zampironi, which we stood up and lit in saucers where they glowed then crumbled into dust filling the room with acrid smoke. My mother, an insomniac, took more and stronger sleeping pills. Veronal was one of the most potent on the market then and one could get it without prescription, two cachets at a time. The chemist allowed my mother four. (Good nature? Carelessness? Not profit: they were a few pence apiece; I never knew. That chemist played a painful part in our lives later on.)

            "The only other break in our social isolation that summer came when we heard that one of my mother\x{2019}s friends of other times was staying at the H\x{f4}tel des Bains at Bandol with a young and glossy mistress (I had seen her). It was Ernst Toller, the playwright and poet. He was a communist then and in exile (Paris, not yet Hollywood and New York where he eventually killed himself), having lately served a two-year prison sentence in Germany (pre-concentration-camp Germany) for his part in some subversive action, and had published a poem written in his cell (like Oscar Wilde, I thought). I was awed \x{2013} had it been unbearable? Would it show? I was also agog to meet a writer. He came to supper at our bungalow one night (without the mistress, without Alessandro, too, as it turned out, he was spending a few days in Marseille trying to see that man about a job). Home before dusk, still in damp espadrilles and bathing-shorts, I found a youngish man \x{2013} not yet thirty? \x{2013} sun-browned, healthy-looking, handsome, sitting on the verandah with my mother. I had offered to do the cooking, and they presently joined me in the kitchen. I remember that he seemed a nice man, an animated talker, even jolly in a gentle way, and he made a nice evening of it, against odds. I do not remember what we, what they were talking about, what a poor cheap thing it is, one\x{2019}s memory: Toller, that doomed and talented man, much loved by his friends, and all that I am able to tell about him at first-hand is his niceness about my own foolish predicament. Which was that we got\x{a0}nothing to eat; or rather: little, very late. I was trying to make us a dish of gratin dauphinois, once taught me by my father: finely sliced potatoes cooked in light cream with a touch of garlic and black pepper. The potatoes must be well washed and dried, and arranged in a neat pattern in their dish, and it looked promising enough as it went into the oven. Our kitchen stove burned wood; firewood in the South of France is either pine which makes a quick flamb\x{e9}e then dies, or olive, often green, which is slow to ignite then dies and smokes. Need I say more? I still have the strip cartoon Toller drew afterwards for my mother. It shows a series of an anxious figure \x{2013} me \x{2013} bending in a cloud of smoke over a tepid stove under a clock (drawn not quite round) displaying the advancing hours. \x{2018}Not quite ready \x{2026}\x{2019}, say the balloons from out of my mouth.

            "Our day began. In the long mornings it was concentrated plunges into la lecture. In France backwaters have bookshops; if Sanary did not run to a full-sized librairie, it had some well stocked shelves in an artists\x{2019} supply shop by name Au Grand Tube, run by a charming non-local couple. Here we found what is surely the ultimate in paperbacks: classics of French fiction at one franc twenty-five \x{2013} three pence. New French books, then as now, did not come out in hardback \x{2013} how I liked those light white volumes, beautifully produced by the NRF or Bernard Grasset, with their plain covers elegantly lettered like the\x{a0}labels of a first grand cru. That threepenny library was something quite else. Decades before Penguins, and also unlike the present French livres de poche, those books didn\x{2019}t even look like books: they were flat, the shape of large notebooks, the paper was cheap and the print was smudgy \x{2013} what matter, they were treasures; carrying an armful up our hill, I felt rich. I must have read (with earnest marginal notes) and my mother re-read half of Balzac, most of Maupassant, some Zola, Alfred de Vigny, Chateaubriand, George Sand, the Goncourts \x{2026} All essential in their so various ways, my mother told me firmly, if I were to begin to understand something about the country I was in. Flaubert and, prematurely no doubt, Constant\x{2019}s Adolphe I had absorbed earlier, at my mother\x{2019}s knee as it were, and however little of their substance I had been capable of extracting, it was a foundation. Stendhal, too, had no part in our reconnaissance at that stage; Stendhal, a sincere and early passion, I felt to be both Italianate and a great writer hors nation. By <<noon|13>> we had shut our books, ready to stroll down, baskets over arm, into Sanary. Our bitch, Chumi, went with us. The few errands done, we would seek a sheltered table on the terrace of Chez Schwob, one of the bars tabacs. Schwob was a large and erudite Alsatian, married to a large and placidly competent black woman who nursed an out-sized baby while he spouted Heine and Descartes as they sold cigarettes and stamps and poured bright drinks from behind the zinc. Theirs was a steady client\x{e8}le of fishermen, masons, sailors, interspersed in the morning by artists, foreigners, French from other parts, and some of the larger-minded notables. In the evenings all these latter went to the more expensive Caf\x{e9} de la Marine next door, the day resort of local professionals and retrait\x{e9}s. The Caf\x{e9} de Lyon and the other tabac must have been strictly other ranks, in all the years we never saw anyone we knew set foot in them.",

First step was putting dinner forward, these assignations being for a <<quarter to nine|10>>. The upheaval, my mother said, like dining out before a dance. To save me another walk down and up the hill, we did our own cooking. She made the soup, potatoes and leeks or potatoes and cresson, the ubiquitous good soup of the evening of the urban and suburban French (the peasant\x{2019}s main-dish soup was something else). I made the oeufs-sur-le-plat in a couple of small round buttered dishes gently till the whites were set pure and creamy with the yolks still perfect, as my father had taught me when I wasn\x{2019}t tall enough to reach the spirit-lamp (now it was more tricky on the charcoal-stove but attention \x{2013} also taught by him \x{2013} would do it). These were not the fried eggs of the English hotel breakfast: hardened, browned and frizzy at the edges, spluttered fat congealing into tepid grease.

There were many to come, each definable still: different, individual in atmosphere, focus, events; men and women in foreground. The great constant was the climate, the inflexible summer climate of the Mediterranean coast. It embraced, contained, our existence; the ever-present sun and sea, the scented air, the strident sounds of tree-frog and cicada were the element we moved in. From May to October there was no rain, only night-dew, thus nothing changed: the earth was monochrome, the sea reverberated the sky. Morning after morning we woke to clear light, coolness modulating through the hours into the still, unwavering heat of <<noon|13>>, the small evening breezes, the warm night luminous from sky and phosphorescent sea.
