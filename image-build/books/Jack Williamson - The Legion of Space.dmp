            "Influenza, with pulmonary complications. The outlook seemed good enough, the first few days, and I knew that old John Delmar\x{2019}s fighting heart had pulled him through a hundred more desperate situations. But sulfa and penicillin failed. His old heart surrendered. He knew he was going to die, and he did\x{2014}quite peacefully, under an oxygen tent, on the morning of March 23. I was standing by his bed, and I looked at my watch.
The time was <<eleven-seven|5b>>.
Whatever others may decide, I was well enough convinced, even before the proof of death. John Delmar at first wished to have his manuscripts destroyed, because his splendid scheme of a full history of the next thousand years was far from complete, but I persuaded him to leave the finished sections in my hands. As mere fiction, they would be enormously entertaining. As a real prevision of future history, they are more than fascinating.",
