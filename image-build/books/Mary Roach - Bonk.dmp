Its goal is simple but complicated: to untangle the complex, quixotic interplay of body and mind as they pertain to female sexuality. You have no idea what a perplexing mess is female arousal. When a woman is turned on by something or someone, her brain sends a signal to open up more of the capillaries in her womanly recesses. This ups the amount of blood in her vaginal walls, and some of the clear portion of it seeps through the capillaries and coats the vagina. Hello, lubrication. This much we know. But just because a woman is a little moist, that doesn\x{2019}t mean she\x{2019}s going to report feeling aroused. Unlike a man. If a man has an erection, or even <<half of one|10>>, as part of a sex study, he will almost always report that he\x{2019}s aroused. Partly, this is because a boner is easier for its owner to detect than is a damp vestibule. It may also have to do with men\x{2019}s greater skill at detecting subtle physical changes. A 1992 study showed that men were more accurate than women at picking up changes in their heart rate and blood pressure.",
