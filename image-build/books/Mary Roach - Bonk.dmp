            "\x{2026}Kinsey was virtually on top of the action, his head only inches removed from the couple\x{2019}s genitals\x{2026}. Above the groans and moans, Kinsey could be heard chattering away, pointing out various signs of sexual arousal as the couple progressed through the different stages of intercourse. In [his colleague] Beach\x{2019}s estimation, no observer had a keener eye for detail. Nothing escaped Kinsey\x{2019}s notice\x{2014}not the subtle changes in the breast\x{2019}s skin tone that accompanied tumescence during arousal, not the involuntary twitch of the muscles in the anus upon orgasm\x{2014}Kinsey saw everything. At <<one|9m:1>> level, it was all very analytic and detached. As Beach looked closer, however, he was certain he detected a gleam of desire in Kinsey\x{2019}s eyes, a look that grew more intense as the action built to a climax.I wanted to see the purported gleam and decide for myself. I wanted to watch one of the films. Did Kinsey look like a scientist doing research, or did he look like a Peeping Tom? Was he taking measurements? Jotting down notes? Perhaps I could see those too. I contacted Shawn Wilson, the likable gatekeeper for the Kinsey Institute\x{2019}s library and special collections. He replied that if\x{2014}as Wardell Pomeroy states in his book\x{2014}notes were taken and data compiled from the sessions in the attic, the institute did not have them. The films themselves, he said, were \x{201c}not available\x{201d}\x{2014}meaning, I think, that they still exist but very few people, and certainly not Mary Roach, get to watch them. In his email, Wilson referred to the footage as \x{201c}the Kinsey stag film,\x{201d} a fitting enough description, but not one that contributed greatly to its status as scientific documentation.",

            "Given the political climate, it was exceedingly brave of Masters\x{2014}then a gynecologist at Washington University in St. Louis\x{2014}to undertake such a project. This was to be a large (<<nearly 700|18:0>> participants), nonclandestine observational study of human sexual arousal and orgasm. To try to get funding and permission for such a venture in 1954 must have been, well, like trying to do it in 2007. Understandably, Masters went to great lengths to appear as scientific, objective, and morally upstanding as he could. His hiring of a female associate, Virginia Johnson, helped ward off accusations of impropriety (though she was mainly brought on board, Masters said, as a sort of \x{201c}interpreter\x{201d} to help him understand a woman\x{2019}s subjective experience of sex). Where Kinsey had actively sought out people on the fringes of American sexuality, Masters made a point of screening out \x{201c}all individuals with sociosexual aberrancy.\x{201d} (The team observed gays and lesbians in the lab but did not include them in the sample for this project. More on them later.) The 276 couples who came to his lab were heterosexual, and they were married. Most of them worked or taught at the university. The work was done under the auspices of the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation\x{2014}no mention of sex\x{2014}and it was done in a laboratory setting, amid scientific instruments and professionals in white lab coats.",

Cold-light illumination allows observation and recording without distortion. The equipment can be adjusted for physical variations in size, weight, and vaginal development. The rate and depth of penile thrust is initiated and controlled completely by the responding individual. As tension elevates, rapidity and depth of thrust are increased voluntarily, paralleling subjective demand.The only other information the pair provided had to do with the equipment also being used for testing barrier-type contraceptive devices, which made sense, and \x{201c}in the creation of artificial vaginas,\x{201d} which made less sense.

Its goal is simple but complicated: to untangle the complex, quixotic interplay of body and mind as they pertain to female sexuality. You have no idea what a perplexing mess is female arousal. When a woman is turned on by something or someone, her brain sends a signal to open up more of the capillaries in her womanly recesses. This ups the amount of blood in her vaginal walls, and some of the clear portion of it seeps through the capillaries and coats the vagina. Hello, lubrication. This much we know. But just because a woman is a little moist, that doesn\x{2019}t mean she\x{2019}s going to report feeling aroused. Unlike a man. If a man has an erection, or even <<half of one|10>>, as part of a sex study, he will almost always report that he\x{2019}s aroused. Partly, this is because a boner is easier for its owner to detect than is a damp vestibule. It may also have to do with men\x{2019}s greater skill at detecting subtle physical changes.
