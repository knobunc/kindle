The air was hot and dry, and the shade cast by the blocks on either side provided little respite from the high-angled rays of the sun. I could feel sweat beading on my face and soaking the hair at the back of my neck. In windows and mirror-shielded frontages along the way, our black-uniformed reflections kept pace. I was almost glad of the company. There was no one else out in the <<midday|13>> heat, and the shimmering stillness of it was uncanny. The sand crunched audibly underfoot.',
