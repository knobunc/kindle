            "To me the image of the Pioneer Valley is three emu eggs nestled in a basket at the Whole Foods down by the colleges. Someone\x{2014}either a back-to-the-land liberal pioneer or back-to-the-wall local hoping to keep his farm\x{2014}had put his money into emu ranching. Emu was the meat of the future back in the 1990s, but then the emu bubble (a real thing!) burst, leaving some poor soul with a flock of six-foot-tall sub-ostrich neo-dinosaurs with bad tempers and open head-holes for ears that couldn\x{2019}t be sold and were now just leaving their eggs all over the place. Emu eggs are mutant, Dr. Seussian\x{2013}looking things: the size of a candlepin bowling ball with a shell that is a surreal, deep blue green. The produce guy at Whole Foods told me that a single egg will make an omelet that will serve <<six to eight|10a:0>>, and with every word of that sentence I got progressively closer to barfing. Those three eggs in a basket at Whole Foods spoke the words of the Pioneer Valley into my own ear-holes: \x{201c}We are desperate dreamers, and we will try anything.\x{201d} I don\x{2019}t know if anyone bought the emu eggs. I\x{2019}ve never seen them in there again.",

I would go to caf\x{e9}s and read Julio Cort\x{e1}zar alone. I would peruse the early work of Nik Kershaw at Planet Records in Kenmore Square. I would go to the first Newbury Comics and be scared by photographs of Wendy O. Williams and purchase Art Spiegelman\x{2019}s Raw. At a <<midday|13>> animation festival at the Off the Wall cinema in Central Square, I saw \x{201c}Vincent,\x{201d} the first short by a then-unknown Tim Burton. \x{201c}That young man is going places,\x{201d} I said to nobody, because I was alone.",

I went to London for one semester on a drink-abroad program of my own devising and got a job at a cheesemonger\x{2019}s. I loved mongering. I would turn the cheeses over once in the morning and once in the afternoon (to keep their moisture evenly distributed) and between those times I would stand outside waiting for <<midday|13>>, when the beautiful French teenagers would descend from the \x{c9}cole Fran\x{e7}ais at the top of the street to pillage the neighborhood for warm hunks of bread and massive chocolate bars.
