            "Patrick Hamilton was one of the most gifted and admired writers of his
            generation. Born in Hassocks, Sussex, in 1904, he and his parents moved a short while
            later to Hove, where he spent his early years. He published his first novel, Monday
                Morning, in 1925 and within a few years had established a wide readership for
            himself. Despite personal setbacks and an increasing problem with drink, he was able to
            write some of his best work. His plays include the thrillers Rope (1929), on
            which Alfred Hitchcock\x{2019}s film Rope was based, and Gas Light
            (1939), also successfully adapted for the screen (1939), and a historical drama, The
                Duke in Darkness (1943). Among his novels are Craven House (1926);
                The <<Midnight|13>> Bell (1929), The Siege of Pleasure (1932) and
                ThePlains of Cement (1934) which form a trilogy entitled Twenty
                Thousand Streets Under the Sky (1935); Hangover Square (1941); and
                The Slaves of Solitude (1947). The Gorse Trilogy is made up of
                The West Pier, MrSampson and Mr Gorse and Unknown Assailant, which
            were first published during the 1950s. J. B. Priestley described Patrick Hamilton as
            \x{2018}uniquely individual\x{2026} He is the novelist of innocence, appallingly
            vulnerable, and of malevolence, coming out of some mysterious darkness of
            evil.\x{2019} Patrick Hamilton died in 1962.",

The marvel was that after a certain time of the morning (<<eleven o\x{2019}clock|6>>) it was possible to make such an assault. It was not necessarily wise \x{2013} on certain days she might be furious if he phoned at eleven \x{2013} but it was possible; it was not expressly forbidden. The problem which always exercised his mind was what time to choose, how long he should, or could, hold off. He sometimes tried to get some information on this subject from herself the night before, but she was seldom informative. She was not an informative girl: he had to find out everything for himself by experiment and disaster. From many such experiments and disasters, however, he had deduced certain scientific rules which were of service to him. He had now some knowledge, through deep thought, inference, and hearsay, of the main complications with which, daily, he summoned up the effrontery to interfere. In the forefront of these complications was her bath. There was the bath which she genuinely took each day shortly after she rose; there were also the spurious baths he had foisted upon him when Mrs Chope was there to answer the phone. The best time to phone her, the time at which she was likely to be in her best mood, was about a quarter of an hour after her genuine bath. Half an hour after, it was too late: she was often already out of the house. The principal thing to do, then, was to guess accurately the time of her rising, which might, to a certain extent, be deduced from the time she went to bed, and to link up such a guess with the general knowledge he had acquired, over a long period, of the likelihood of the irregular Mrs Chope having arrived at the flat. For the presence of Mrs Chope threw out all other calculations based on the premise that she was not there.",
