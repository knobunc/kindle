            "I find myself walking through the antique district below Fourteenth Street. My watch has stopped so I\x{2019}m not sure what time it is, but probably <<ten-thirty|5k:1>> or so. Black guys pass by offering crack or hustling tickets to a party at the Palladium. I walk by a newsstand, a dry cleaners, a church, a diner. The streets are empty; the only noise breaking up the silence is an occasional taxi cruising toward Union Square. A couple of skinny faggots walk by while I\x{2019}m at a phone booth checking my messages, staring at my reflection in an antique store\x{2019}s window. One of them whistles at me, the other laughs: a high, fey, horrible sound. A torn playbill from Les Mis\x{e9}rables tumbles down the cracked, urine-stained sidewalk. A streetlamp burns out. Someone in a Jean-Paul Gaultier topcoat takes a piss in an alleyway. Steam rises from below the streets, billowing up in tendrils, evaporating. Bags of frozen garbage line the curbs. The moon, pale and low, hangs just above the tip of the Chrysler Building. Somewhere from over in the West Village the siren from an ambulance screams, the wind picks it up, it echoes then fades.",

            "and it\x{2019}s midafternoon and I find myself standing at a phone booth on a corner somewhere downtown, I don\x{2019}t know where, but I\x{2019}m sweaty and a pounding migraine thumps dully in my head and I\x{2019}m experiencing a major-league anxiety attack, searching my pockets for Valium, Xanax, a leftover Halcion, anything, and all I find are three faded Nuprin in a Gucci pillbox, so I pop all three into my mouth and swallow them down with a Diet Pepsi and I couldn\x{2019}t tell you where it came from if my life depended on it. I\x{2019}ve forgotten who I had lunch with earlier and, even more important, where. Was it Robert Ailes at Beats? Or was it Todd Hendricks at Ursula\x{2019}s, the new Philip Duncan Holmes bistro in Tribeca? Or was it Ricky Worrall and were we at December\x{2019}s? Or would it have been Kevin Weber at Contra in NoHo? Did I order the partridge sandwich on brioche with green tomatoes, or a big plate of endive with clam sauce? \x{201c}Oh god, I can\x{2019}t remember,\x{201d} I moan, my clothes\x{2014}a linen and silk sport coat, a cotton shirt, pleated linen khaki trousers, all by Matsuda, a silk tie with a Matsuda insignia, with a belt from Coach Leatherware\x{2014}drenched with sweat, and I take off the jacket and wipe my face with it. The phone keeps ringing but I don\x{2019}t know who I\x{2019}ve called and I just stand on the corner, Ray-Bans balanced on my forehead at what feels like an odd, crooked angle, and then I hear a faint familiar sound coming through the wires\x{2014}Jean\x{2019}s soft voice competing with the endless gridlock stuck on Broadway. The Patty Winters Show this morning was Aspirin: Can It Save Your Life? \x{201c}Jean?\x{201d} I cry out. \x{201c}Hello? Jean?\x{201d} \x{201c}Patrick? Is that you?\x{201d} she calls back. \x{201c}Hello?\x{201d} \x{201c}Jean, I need help,\x{201d} I shout. \x{201c}Patrick?\x{201d} \x{201c}What?\x{201d} \x{201c}Jesse Forrest called,\x{201d} Jean says. \x{201c}He has a reservation at Melrose tonight at <<eight|9b>>, and Ted Madison and Jamie Conway want to meet you for drinks at Harry\x{2019}s. Patrick?\x{201d} Jean asks. \x{201c}Where are you?\x{201d} \x{201c}Jean?\x{201d} I sigh, wiping my nose. \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not\x{2014}\x{201d} \x{201c}Oh, and Todd Lauder called,\x{201d} Jean says, \x{201c}no, I mean Chris\x{2014}oh no, it was Todd Lauder. Yeah, Todd Lauder.\x{201d} \x{201c}Oh god,\x{201d} I moan, loosening my tie, the August sun beating down on me, \x{201c}what do you say, you dumb bitch?\x{201d} \x{201c}Not Bice, Patrick. The reservation is at Melrose. Not Bice.\x{201d} \x{201c}What am I doing?\x{201d} I cry out. \x{201c}Where are you?\x{201d} and then, \x{201c}Patrick? What\x{2019}s wrong?\x{201d} \x{201c}I\x{2019}m not going to make it, Jean,\x{201d} I say, then choke out, \x{201c}to the office this afternoon.\x{201d} \x{201c}Why?\x{201d} She sounds depressed or maybe it\x{2019}s just simple confusion. \x{201c}Just \x{2026} say \x{2026} no \x{2026},\x{201d} I scream. \x{201c}What is it, Patrick? Are you all right?\x{201d} she asks. \x{201c}Stop sounding so fucking \x{2026} sad. Jesus,\x{201d} I shout. \x{201c}Patrick. I\x{2019}m sorry. I mean I meant to say Just say no, but\x{2014}\x{201d} I hang up on her and lunge away from the phone booth and the Walkman around my neck suddenly feels like a boulder strapped around my throat (and the sounds blaring from it\x{2014}early Dizzy Gillespie\x{2014}deeply irritate) and I have to throw the Walkman, a cheap one, into the nearest trash can I stumble into and then I hang on to the rim of the can, breathing heavily, the cheap Matsuda jacket tied around my waist, staring at the still-functioning Walkman, the sun melting the mousse on my head and it mingles with the sweat pouring down my face and I can taste it when I lick my lips and it starts tasting good and I\x{2019}m suddenly ravenous and I run my hand through my hair and lick greedily at the palm while moving up Broadway, ignoring the old ladies passing out fliers, past jeans stores, music blasting from inside, pouring out onto the streets, people\x{2019}s movements matching the beat of the song, a Madonna single, Madonna crying out, \x{201c}life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone \x{2026},\x{201d} bike messengers whiz by and I\x{2019}m standing on a corner scowling at them, but people pass, oblivious, no one pays attention, they don\x{2019}t even pretend to not pay attention, and this fact sobers me up long enough that I walk toward a nearby Conran\x{2019}s to buy a teapot, but just when I assume my normalcy has returned and I\x{2019}m all straightened out, my stomach tightens and the cramps are so intense that I hobble into the nearest doorway and clutch my waist, doubling over with pain, and as suddenly as it appears it fades long enough for me to stand up straight and rush into the next hardware store I come across, and once inside I buy a set of butcher knives, an ax, a bottle of hydrochloric acid, and then, at the pet store down the block, a Habitrail and two white rats that I plan to torture with the knives and acid, but somewhere, later in the afternoon, I leave the package with the rats in it at the Pottery Barn while shopping for candles or did I finally buy the teapot? Now I\x{2019}m lunging up Lafayette, sweating and moaning and pushing people out of my way, foam pouring out of my mouth, stomach contracting with horrendous abdominal cramps\x{2014}they might be caused by the steroids but that\x{2019}s doubtful\x{2014}and I calm myself down enough to walk into a Gristede\x{2019}s, rush up and down the aisles and shoplift a canned ham that I calmly walk out of the store with, hidden under the Matsuda jacket, and down the block, where I try to hide in the lobby of the American Felt Building, breaking the tin open with my keys, ignoring the doorman, who at first seems to recognize me, then, after I start stuffing handfuls of the ham into my mouth, scooping the lukewarm pink meat out of the can, getting it stuck beneath my nails, threatens to call the police. I\x{2019}m outta there, outside, throwing up all the ham, leaning against a poster for Les Mis\x{e9}rables at a bus stop and I kiss the drawing of Eponine\x{2019}s lovely face, her lips, leaving brown streaks of bile smeared across her soft, unassuming face and the word DYKE scrawled beneath it. Loosening my suspenders, ignoring beggars, beggars ignoring me, sweat-drenched, delirious, I find myself back downtown in Tower Records and I compose myself, muttering over and over to no one, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ve gotta return my videotapes, I\x{2019}ve gotta return my videotapes,\x{201d} and I buy two copies of my favorite compact disc, Bruce Willis, The Return of Bruno, and then I\x{2019}m stuck in the revolving door for five full spins and I trip out onto the street, bumping into Charles Murphy from Kidder Peabody or it could be Bruce Barker from Morgan Stanley, whoever, and he says \x{201c}Hey, Kinsley\x{201d} and I belch into his face, my eyes rolling back into my head, greenish bile dripping in strings from my bared fangs, and he suggests, unfazed, \x{201c}See you at Fluties, okay? Severt too?\x{201d} I screech and while backing away I bump into a fruit stand at a Korean deli, collapsing stacks of apples and oranges and lemons, that go rolling onto the sidewalk, over the curb and into the street where they\x{2019}re splattered by cabs and cars and buses and trucks and I\x{2019}m apologizing, delirious, offering a screaming Korean my platinum AmEx accidentally, then a twenty, which he immediately takes, but still he grabs me by the lapels of the stained, wrinkled jacket I\x{2019}ve forced myself back into and when I look up into his slanty-eyed round face he suddenly bursts into the chorus of Lou Christie\x{2019}s \x{201c}Lightnin\x{2019} Strikes.\x{201d} I pull away, horrified, stumbling uptown, toward home, but people, places, stores keep interrupting me, a drug dealer on Thirteenth Street who offers me crack and blindly I wave a fifty at him and he says \x{201c}Oh, man\x{201d} gratefully and shakes my hand, pressing five vials into my palm which I proceed to eat whole and the crack dealer stares at me, trying to mask his deep disturbance with an amused glare, and I grab him by the neck and croak out, my breath reeking, \x{201c}The best engine is in the BMW 750iL,\x{201d} and then I move on to a phone booth, where I babble gibberish at the operator until I finally spit out my credit card number and then I\x{2019}m speaking to the front office of Xclusive, where I cancel a massage appointment that I never made. I\x{2019}m able to compose myself by simply staring at my feet, actually at the A. Testoni loafers, kicking pigeons aside, and without even noticing, I enter a shabby delicatessen on Second Avenue and I\x{2019}m still confused, mixed up, sweaty, and I walk over to a short, fat Jewish woman, old and hideously dressed. \x{201c}Listen,\x{201d} I say. \x{201c}I have a reservation. Bateman. Where\x{2019}s the ma\x{ee}tre d\x{2019}? I know Jackie Mason,\x{201d} and she sighs, \x{201c}I can seat you. Don\x{2019}t need a reservation,\x{201d} as she reaches for a menu. She leads me to a horrible table in back near the rest rooms and I grab the menu away from her and rush to a booth up front and I\x{2019}m appalled by the cheapness of the food\x{2014}\x{201c}Is this a goddamn joke?\x{201d}\x{2014}and sensing a waitress is near I order without looking up. \x{201c}A cheeseburger. I\x{2019}d like a cheeseburger and I\x{2019}d like it medium rare.\x{201d} \x{201c}I\x{2019}m sorry, sir,\x{201d} the waitress says. \x{201c}No cheese. Kosher,\x{201d} and I have no idea what the fuck she\x{2019}s talking about and I say, \x{201c}Fine. A kosherburger but with cheese, Monterey Jack perhaps, and\x{2014}oh god,\x{201d} I moan, sensing more cramps coming on. \x{201c}No cheese, sir,\x{201d} she says. \x{201c}Kosher \x{2026}\x{201d} \x{201c}Oh god, is this a nightmare, you fucking Jew?\x{201d} I mutter, and then, \x{201c}Cottage cheese? Just bring it?\x{201d} \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll get the manager,\x{201d} she says. \x{201c}Whatever. But bring me a beverage in the meanwhile,\x{201d} I hiss. \x{201c}Yes?\x{201d} she asks. \x{201c}A \x{2026} vanilla \x{2026} milk shake \x{2026}\x{201d} \x{201c}No milk shakes. Kosher,\x{201d} she says, then, \x{201c}I\x{2019}ll get the manager.\x{201d} \x{201c}No, wait.\x{201d} \x{201c}Mister I\x{2019}ll get the manager.\x{201d} \x{201c}What in the fuck is going on?\x{201d} I ask, seething, my platinum AmEx already slapped on the greasy table. \x{201c}No milk shake. Kosher,\x{201d} she says, thick-lipped, just one of billions of people who have passed over this planet. \x{201c}Then bring me a fucking \x{2026} vanilla \x{2026} malted!\x{201d} I roar, spraying spit all over my open menu. She just stares. \x{201c}Extra thick!\x{201d} I add. She walks away to get the manager and when I see him approaching, a bald carbon copy of the waitress, I get up and scream, \x{201c}Fuck yourself you retarded cocksucking kike,\x{201d} and I run out of the delicatessen and onto the street where this",

It\x{2019}s nearing summer, mid-May, but the club is air-conditioned and cool, the music from the light jazz band drifts through the half-empty room, ceiling fans are whirring, a crowd twenty deep waits outside in the rain, a surging mass. Libby is blond and wearing black grosgrain high-heeled evening shoes with exaggeratedly pointed toes and red satin bows by Yves Saint Laurent. Daisy is blonder and wearing black satin tapered-toe pumps set off by splattered-silver sheer black stockings by Betsey Johnson. Caron is platinum blond and wearing stack-heeled leather boots with a pointed patent-leather toe and wool tweed turned-over calf by Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel. All three of them have on skimpy black wool-knit dresses by Giorgio di Sant\x{2019}Angelo and are drinking champagne with cranberry juice and peach schnapps and smoking German cigarettes\x{2014}but I don\x{2019}t complain, even though I think it would be in Nell\x{2019}s best interest if a nonsmoking section was initiated. Two of them are wearing Giorgio Armani sunglasses. Libby has jet lag. Of the three, Daisy is the only one I even remotely want to fuck. Earlier in the day after a meeting with my lawyer about some bogus rape charges, I had an anxiety attack in Dean & Deluca which I worked off at Xclusive. Then I met the models for drinks at the Trump Plaza. This was followed by a French movie that I completely did not understand, but it was fairly chic anyway, then dinner at a sushi restaurant called Vivids near Lincoln Center and a party at one of the models\x{2019} ex-boyfriend\x{2019}s loft in Chelsea, where bad, fruity sangria was served.

The cause is hard to locate but I\x{2019}ve narrowed it down to one of two reasons. It\x{2019}s either that I\x{2019}m afraid of rejection (though I can\x{2019}t understand why: she called me, she wants to see me, she wants to have lunch with me, she wants to fuck me again) or, on the other hand, it could have something to do with this new Italian mousse I\x{2019}m wearing, which, though it makes my hair look fuller and smells good, feels very sticky and uncomfortable, and it\x{2019}s something I could easily blame my nervousness on. So we wouldn\x{2019}t run out of things to talk about over lunch, I tried to read a trendy new short-story collection called Wok that I bought at Barnes & Noble last night and whose young author was recently profiled in the Fast Track section of New York magazine, but every story started off with the line \x{201c}When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie\x{201d} and I had to put this slim volume back into my bookshelf and drink a J&B on the rocks, followed by two Xanax, to recover from the effort. To make up for this, before I fell asleep I wrote Bethany a poem and it took a long time, which surprised me, since I used to write her poems, long dark ones, quite often when we were both at Harvard, before we broke up. God, I\x{2019}m thinking to myself as I walk into Vanities, only fifteen minutes late, I hope she hasn\x{2019}t ended up with Robert Hall, that dumb asshole. I pass by a mirror hung over the bar as I\x{2019}m led to our table and check out my reflection\x{2014}the mousse looks good.

If I decide to get rid of it tonight, I can easily stuff what\x{2019}s left of her into a Hefty garbage bag and leave it in the stairwell; or I can exert the extra effort and drag it into the street, leaving it with the rest of the trash on the curb. I could even take it to the apartment in Hell\x{2019}s Kitchen and pour lime over it, smoke a cigar and watch it dissolve while listening to my Walkman, but I want to keep the men\x{2019}s bodies separate from the women\x{2019}s, and besides, I also want to watch Bloodhungry, the videotape I rented this afternoon\x{2014}its ad line reads, \x{201c}Some clowns make you laugh, but Bobo will make you die and then he\x{2019}ll eat your body\x{201d}\x{2014}and a <<midnight|13>> trip to Hell\x{2019}s Kitchen, even without a stop at Bellvue\x{2019}s for a small bite to eat, wouldn\x{2019}t give me enough time.

Before dinner last night at <<1500|18:0>> with Reed Goodrich and Jason Rust I was almost caught at a Federal Express in Times Square trying to send the mother of one of the girls I killed last week what might be a dried-up, brown heart. And to Evelyn I successfully Federal Expressed, through the office, a small box of flies along with a note, typed by Jean, saying that I never, ever wanted to see her face again and, though she doesn\x{2019}t really need one, to go on a fucking diet. But there are also things that the average person would think are nice that I\x{2019}ve done to celebrate the holiday, items I\x{2019}ve bought Jean and had delivered to her apartment this morning: Castellini cotton napkins from Bendel\x{2019}s, a wicker chair from Jenny B. Goode, a taffeta table throw from Barney\x{2019}s, a vintage chain-mail-vent purse and a vintage sterling silver dresser set from Macy\x{2019}s, a white pine whatnot from Conran\x{2019}s, an Edwardian nine-carat-gold \x{201c}gate\x{201d} bracelet from Bergdorf\x{2019}s and hundreds upon hundreds of pink and white roses.",

            "I\x{2019}m coming back from Central Park where, near the children\x{2019}s zoo, close to the spot I murdered the McCaffrey boy, I fed portions of Ursula\x{2019}s brain to passing dogs. Walking down Fifth Avenue <<around four o\x{2019}clock in the afternoon|6>>, everyone on the street looks sad, the air is full of decay, bodies lie on the cold pavement, miles of it, some are moving, most are not. History is sinking and only a very few seem dimly aware that things are getting bad. Airplanes fly low across the city, crossing in front of the sun. Winds shoot up Fifth, then funnel down Fifty-seventh Street. Flocks of pigeons rise in slow motion and burst up against the sky. The smell of burning chestnuts mixes with carbon monoxide fumes. I notice the skyline has changed only recently. I look up, admiringly, at Trump Tower, tall, proudly gleaming in the late afternoon sunlight. In front of it two smartass nigger teenagers are ripping off tourists at three-card monte and I have to fight the impulse to blow them away.",

But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman\x{2019}s such a bloody ass-kisser, such a brown-nosing goody-goody, that I couldn\x{2019}t fully appreciate it. Otherwise it was amusing.
