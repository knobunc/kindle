And the kitchen was a fucking pigsty like she had fuckt off as soon as she was up and dressed. Which is fair enough cause she didnay finish work till late and sometimes wasnay home till <<after two in the morning|9h>>. So if she just got off her mark then she was fucking entitled. Fuck the housework. With him no working anyway I mean, what does it matter, Sammy was happy doing that sort of stuff. Plus the fact it was her house, it\x{2019}s no as if he had any claim for being there, except her, so he needed to be pulling his weight and all that. At least that was the way he looked at it. So when he got home on Friday dinnertime he just stuck on the music. Loud, the way he liked it. Then he set about the tidying. But once he had finished the money burnt a hole in his pocket, he couldnay settle; he tried to read a book, he shoved on the telly; he just couldnay concentrate. Plus he was starving. But cause he had done all that tidying he didnay want to fucking mess it back up again so he wasnay gony cook fuck all. So he just went back out, thinking in terms of a pie and a pint. Across the river and along the road, up the main drag and round to the Cross, and along and up by Argyle Street where he found the Leg and they went on a spree,",

He got his breath back. It was a straight road. He had come in a straight line and from here on it was that same line, cause that same line, it would take him to the block of flats, to the wee turnoff ower the bridge, eventually, that was where it would lead him. Even if he had the dough for a taxi the driver wouldnay want to take him, it was too close, he would just say, Get to fuck! That was what he would say, cause it was so close. Ye\x{2019}re too close for a taxi, it\x{2019}s just a five-minute walk; that was what the guy would say, so it was fine, he just had crossings to go, <<about three|9:0>> to the main junction, the big five-wayer; once across there it was plain sailing man plain sailing, so okay, batter on, just batter on. He stepped forwards from the corner, his two arms raised and moving from side to side, his right foot doing the feeling, tapping out the way, and he touched a thing, a pole, good, the edge of the pavement. It wasnay a real street this it was more like a lane and hardly any traffic went down it at all. He heard people passing. He could get help if he wanted, but he didnay need it; he would need it later, but no the now, it was best no trying for it the now; because",

            "So the guy\x{2019}s been invisible for at least two months; the only thing he\x{2019}s allowed to do is put a line on in the betting shop now and again. But even that\x{2019}s a fucking rigmarole cause ye\x{2019}ve got to be wary there as well. So anyway, he\x{2019}s fucking sick of it. What he does he bolts the course for a day at the races; the full wad in the tail; two or three grand he was holding. So he\x{2019}s only in the gaff ten minutes and he\x{2019}s latched onto this bird. He was a sharp dresser Jackie; quite a good-looking guy. Probably too the patter, him being a Scouse and all that. But what happens but he backs the first four winners. No kidding ye man in the space of an hour and a half he\x{2019}s went ten or twelve grand in front. Ye\x{2019}re talking twenty year ago, know what I mean. So the lassie, she\x{2019}s totally straight. She\x{2019}s only at the track on some kind of works\x{2019} outing. She\x{2019}s never met a cunt like him afore, never. What happens then, after the racing, yer man, he\x{2019}s looking about, itchy fingers and all that. A game of cards man that\x{2019}s what he\x{2019}s looking for. So he jumps a taxi and tells the guy to take them to Aberdeen. Now the lassie\x{2019}s married. She isnay wanting to go to Aberdeen, she cannay; she\x{2019}s got to get home and all that. But Jackie\x{2019}s persuaded her, he\x{2019}s telt her he\x{2019}s got a message to go but it isnay a problem cause there\x{2019}s a last plane home and they\x{2019}ll catch that; nay danger. I mean there\x{2019}s nay fucking plane, no that he knew about. The way it was, the way Jackie saw it, about Aberdeen and all that it was his only chance. It\x{2019}s now or never, know what I\x{2019}m saying; he\x{2019}s out this once, there\x{2019}s no gony be a second time. And he doesnay want the bold fellow, the name-guy in Glasgow, he doesnay want him finding out. So he\x{2019}s got to be back first thing in the morning, the crack of dawn. Ye see Edinburgh was nay good; too close, too risky; and he couldnay hit Newcastle either cause that\x{2019}s even riskier, the way he saw it anyway man it being England and all that. He telt Sammy he thought about going to Deauville in France but it was too tricky, too many hassles. Whatever, it had to be the now, right fucking now; he\x{2019}s got the dough and he\x{2019}s got the bird. So Aberdeen, on the taxi, whatever the fuck that costs. They book into a hotel; five-star room service and all that man the salmon sandwiches and the bottle of champagne; a quick shag and a shower then out. He finds this casino; he\x{2019}s got to drop the doorman cause of the 48 hour membership thing. But he gets it settled. Then he can relax. Whatever man it\x{2019}s done, know what I\x{2019}m saying, that\x{2019}s that; from here on man fuck sake anything, okay, so he takes the lassie back out to this high-class restaurant, no for nay reason, they\x{2019}re no really that hungry I dont think it\x{2019}s just fucking part of it, giving the lassie a bit of a go; so they have a drink and a meal and all that, etcetera. Then the casino. Jackie wasnay interested in roulette nor fuck all, blackjack; nayn of that crap; poker was his game and he\x{2019}s heard stories about wild money off the rigs. He\x{2019}s hoping to score an introduction. That\x{2019}s the main reason how he\x{2019}s there, at the casino. So he\x{2019}s sniffing about. Now ye\x{2019}ve got to mind as well, never mind it\x{2019}s Aberdeen man he\x{2019}s got to be wary, there\x{2019}s some heavy people looking for him, and we\x{2019}re no talking about the sodjers. Anyway, one thing and another, he scores a contact; some big Canadian cowboy; there is a game but it\x{2019}s outside the city, up the coast a few miles. Nay bother, the cowboy gives them a lift. Cut a long story short they get to the house and Jackie gets wiped out. The way he telt Sammy he\x{2019}s unlucky but who knows; they were playing stud and all that and there was the big last hand and he gets fuckt on the last card out the pack. Whatever. It\x{2019}s all fucking legit but so he\x{2019}s got nay grumbles. He comes out the house <<about seven in the morning|9h>> and starts hoofing it. He\x{2019}s got about three quid in the tail and he\x{2019}s keeping it for emergencies. So he\x{2019}s well down the road and he remembers the bird; she\x{2019}s back in the house man she\x{2019}s still waiting, sound asleep on a chair in one of the rooms. But fuck it what can he do he\x{2019}s skint, he\x{2019}s fucking stony, right out the game; she\x{2019}s better off making it herself, the way his luck was running. The worst of it was the couple of grand he started the day with, it wasnay his \x{2013} well it was, but mostly it was earmarked; one thing and another; going invisible isnay cheap man know what I\x{2019}m saying. So he\x{2019}s desperate; half of fucking Britain\x{2019}s after him, he doesnay need the other half. So at the wind-up he\x{2019}s made contact with Sammy and ye\x{2019}ve got to say Sammy\x{2019}s a wee bit chuffed, him being only 19 at the time, just turned. It so happens him and his mates used to hang about in one of the betting shops Jackie went to. Ach well, fuck it, so a couple of days later they\x{2019}re captured, the Lake District, roundabout there, nay point prolonging the agony. Sammy got four and done four.
