            "The major term is the name of the state itself. What to do about that? The Russian name is Yedinoe Gosudarstvo. The last word, the noun, presents no problem: It means state. The meaning of the adjective clusters around the idea of singularity: <<one|9k:0>>, single, united, unified, only. My predecessors have opted for United State or Single State or even The One State. All of these seem to me bad. Single State is a clich\x{e9} for bachelorhood. United State is worse. The normal reader\x{2019}s eye involuntarily adds an s. It strikes me as significant that Alexandra Aldridge specifically warns her readers against this. But even if they should heed the warning, readers might subconsciously associate Zamyatin\x{2019}s nightmare state with the actual United States. This country has been the fictional locale of enough dystopias already without inviting readers to place on this continent one that was not, I think, meant to be specifically American.",
