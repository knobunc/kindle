            "They sat as before at a green table on their singularly tidy lawn. On this Sunday evening it was even more singularly tidy than usual. Only five people had come that  afternoon for \"Riverside Teas.\" There had been three, quite disastrous weekends: on two of them it had rained, and on this particular Sunday there had been what local people spoke of as \"the aeronaut\"\x{2014}a balloon ascent from the fairground, with tea in tents, ice cream, candy floss, and roundabouts. On Saturday people drove out to see the balloon itself (at sixpence a time to pass the rope barriers) and today in the hundreds to see the balloon go up. It had been a sad sight indeed for Mr. and Mrs. Platter to watch the carriages and motors stream past Ballyhoggin with never a glance nor a thought for \"Riverside Teas.\" It had not comforted them, either, when at <<about three o'clock in the afternoon|6>> the balloon itself sailed silently over them, barely clearing the ilex tree, which grew beside the house. They could even see \"the aeronaut,\" who was looking down\x{2014}mockingly, it seemed\x{2014}straight into the glaring eyes of Mr. Platter.",

They would air the attic, clear away the dirty plates, and generally set the borrowers up for the day. Mrs. Platter, to Homily's fury, persisted with the cat treatment: a saucer of milk, a bowl of water, and a baking tin of ashes, set out daily beside their food on a clean sheet of newspaper.",

It was one of Pod's rules that, however active they might be between whiles, the Platters' arrival should always find them back once again in their box. The footsteps on the stairs gave them plenty of warning. \"Never let them know we can climb,\" said Pod.",
