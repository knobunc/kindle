        afternoons, from <<four-thirty|5k:1>> to seven, they crowd into the officers' club bar for the

        alarm by the others, who see any form of social excess -- drink, wenching, late hours, any

        will leave Fort Lauderdale on April 23, arriving iin Key West that night, leaving Key West 
        <<midday|13>> on the 25th, to assure skirting the Cuban coast in the daytime, and arriving in 
        Cozumel midafternoon on the 27th or 28th. In addition to the proven sailfishing, there 
        will be a Marlin Only Day on Saturday May sixth, in the initial attempt on any volume 
        basis to determine how good the blue-marlin fishing is. . . Each night during the 
        tournament, there are cocktail parties with over 250 people attending, mariachi and island 
        music, etc. . . We are happy you can make the trip. . . Flights leave Miami daily for

        music and drove across the highway and about 200 yards down a steep grassy embankment to 
        get to the dock. Sandy refused to get out of the jeep, saying that these weren\'t the kind

        I had just come from the White House pressroom, where a smoglike sense of funk -- or 
        \x{201c}smunk\x{201d} as somebody over there might describe it -- had settled on the room within minutes 
        after Ford took the oath. The Deathwatch was finally over; the evil demon had been purged 
        and the Good Guys had won -- or at least the Bad Guys had lost, but that was not quite the 
        same thing. Within hours after Richard Nixon left Washington, it was painfully clear that 
        Frank Mankiewicz had spoken too soon when he'd predicted, just a few weeks before The 
        Fall, that Washington would be \x{201c}the Hollywood of the Seventies.\x{201d} Without Nixon to stir up 
        its thin juices, the Washington of the Seventies could look forward to the same grim fate

        and any mysterious shoes left lying around on the deserted ballroom floors of the 
        Watergate era would not interest a genial pragmatist like Gerald Ford. He would not have 
        much time, for a while, to concern himself with anything but the slide into national 
        bankruptcy that Nixon had left him to cope with. . . And, despite all its menacing 
        implications, the desperate plight of the national economy was not a story that called up 
        the same kind of journalistic adrenaline that Washington and most of the country had been 
        living on for so long that the prospect of giving it up caused a serious panic in the 
        ranks of all the Watergate junkies who never even knew they were hooked until the cold 
        turkey swooped into their closets.",
