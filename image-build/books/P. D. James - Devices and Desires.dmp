            "The Whistler\x{2019}s fourth victim was his youngest, Valerie Mitchell, aged fifteen years, eight months and four days, and she died because she missed the <<9.40|5a:1>> bus from Easthaven to Cobb\x{2019}s Marsh. As always, she had left it until the last minute to leave the disco, and the floor was still a packed, gyrating mass of bodies under the makeshift strobe lights when she broke free of Wayne\x{2019}s clutching hands, shouted instructions to Shirl about their plans for next week above the raucous beat of the music and left the dance floor. Her last glimpse of Wayne was of his serious, bobbing face bizarrely striped with red, yellow and blue under the turning lights. Without waiting to change her shoes, she snatched up her jacket from the cloakroom peg and raced up the road past the darkened shops towards the bus station, her cumbersome shoulder-bag flapping against her ribs. But when she turned the corner into the station she saw with horror that the lights on their high poles shone down on a bleached and silent emptiness and, dashing to the corner, was in time to see the bus already halfway up the hill. There was still a chance if the lights were against it, and she began desperately chasing after it, hampered by her fragile, high-heeled shoes. But the lights were green and she watched helplessly, gasping and bent double with a sudden cramp, as it lumbered over the brow of a hill and like a brightly lit ship sank out of sight. \x{201c}Oh no!\x{201d} she screamed after it, \x{201c}Oh God! Oh no!\x{201d} and felt the tears of anger and dismay smarting her eyes.",

            "This was the end. It was her father who laid down the rules in her family, and there was never any appeal, any second chance. After protracted discussion and her repeated pleas, she had been allowed this weekly visit on Friday evenings to the disco run by the church Youth Club, provided she caught the <<9.40|5a:0>> bus without fail. It put her down at the Crown and Anchor at Cobb\x{2019}s Marsh, only fifty yards from her cottage. From <<10.15|5a:0>> her father would begin watching for the bus to pass the front room where he and her mother would sit half-watching the television, the curtains drawn back. Whatever the programme or weather, he would then put on his coat and come out to walk the fifty yards to meet her, keeping her always in sight. Since the Norfolk Whistler had begun his killings, her father had had an added justification for the mild domestic tyranny which, she half-realized, he both thought right in dealing with his only child and rather enjoyed. The concordat had been early established: \x{201c}You do right by me, my girl, and I\x{2019}ll do right by you.\x{201d} She both loved him and slightly feared him, and she dreaded his anger. Now there would be one of those awful rows in which she knew she couldn\x{2019}t hope to look to her mother for support. It would be the end of her Friday evenings with Wayne and Shirl and the gang. Already they teased and pitied her because she was treated as a child. Now it would be total humiliation.",

Here a right turn took him off the coastal road onto what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a golden haze of reeds, their lumbered heads straining in the wind. And now, for the first time, he thought that he could smell the North Sea, that potent but half-illusory tang evoking nostalgic memories of childhood holidays, of solitary adolescent walks as he struggled with his first poems, of his aunt\x{2019}s tall figure at his side, binoculars round her neck, striding towards the haunts of her beloved birds. And here, barring the road, was the familiar old farm gate still in place. Its continued presence always surprised him, since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue. It swung open at his touch, but closing it, as always, was more difficult, and he lugged and half-lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday world and entered country which, no matter how frequent his visits, would always be alien territory.",

            "It was much lighter than he had expected, largely because of a rear door, now open, which led to a glass extension giving a view of the headland. He was aware of the room\x{2019}s clutter: the central wooden table still covered with the remains of their <<midday|13>> meal, an assortment of plates smeared with tomato sauce, a half-eaten sausage, a large bottle of orangeade uncapped; the children\x{2019}s clothes thrown over the back of a low nursing chair before the fireplace; of the smell of milk and bodies and woodsmoke. But what held his attention was a large oil painting propped on a chair and fronting the door. It was a three-quarter portrait in oils of a woman, painted with remarkable power. It dominated the room, so that he and Alice Mair stood for a moment, silently regarding it. The painter had avoided caricature, if only just, but the portrait was, he felt, intended less as a physical likeness than an allegory. Behind the wide, full mouth, the arrogant stare of the eyes, the dark, crimped, Pre-Raphaelite hair streaming in the wind, was a careful delineation of the headland, its objects disposed and painted with the meticulous attention to detail of a sixteenth-century primitive; the Victorian rectory, the ruined abbey, the half-demolished pillbox, the crippled trees, the small white mill like a child\x{2019}s toy and, gaunt against a flaming evening sky, the stark outline of the power station. But it was the woman, painted more freely, who dominated the landscape, arms stretched, the palms facing outwards in a parody of blessing. Dalgliesh\x{2019}s private verdict was that it was technically brilliant, but overwrought and painted, he felt, in hatred. Blaney\x{2019}s intention to produce a study of evil was as clear as if the portrait had been labelled. It was so different from the artist\x{2019}s usual work that without the bold signature, the single surname, Dalgliesh might have wondered if it was, in fact, his work. He recalled Blaney\x{2019}s pallid and innocuous water-colours of the better-known beauty spots of Norfolk\x{2014}Blakeney, St. Peter Mancroft and the Cathedral at Norwich\x{2014}which he produced for the local shops. They could have been painted from picture-postcards and probably were. And he could recall seeing one or two small oils hung in local restaurants and pubs, slapdash in technique and economical of paint, but so different from the prettified water-colours that it was hard to believe that they too were by the same hand. But this portrait was different from either; the wonder was that the artist who could produce this disciplined splurge of colour, this technical artistry and imagination, had been content to churn out meretricious souvenirs for the tourist trade.",

His rangy, graceless figure, over six feet high, still looked as incongruous in a formal suit as it always had. The rugged, weather-beaten face, with its look of dependable fortitude, would have looked more appropriate above a seaman\x{2019}s guernsey, preferably with RNLI woven across the chest. In profile his face, with the long, slightly hooked nose and jutting eyebrows, was impressive. In full face the nose was revealed as a little too wide and flattened at the base, and the dark eyes, which when he was animated took on a fierce, almost manic gleam, in repose were pools of puzzled endurance. Dalgliesh thought of him as a type of police officer less common than formerly but still not rare: the conscientious and incorruptible detective of limited imagination and somewhat greater intelligence who had never supposed that the evil of the world should be condoned because it was frequently inexplicable and its perpetrators unfortunate.",

And he could put from him the treacherous suspicion that their first meeting had been contrived, part of a plan devised by her and Pascoe to exploit his influence with Hilary. But that, surely, was ridiculous. He had only to recall the inevitability of their first coming together, her passionate, uncomplicated animal gusto in their lovemaking, to know that the thought was paranoid. He would be here on Sunday afternoon. It might be their last time together. Already he had half-decided that it had to be. He would free himself from this enslavement, sweet as it was, as he had freed himself from Hilary. And he knew, with a regret which was almost as strong as grief, that with this parting there would be no protests, no appeals, no desperate clinging to the past. Amy would accept his leaving as calmly as she had accepted his arrival.
He said: \x{201c}OK. <<About four-thirty|9j>>, then. Sunday the twenty-fifth.\x{201d}
And now time, which in the last ten minutes seemed mysteriously to have halted, flowed again, and he was standing at his bedroom window five days later watching the great ball of the sun rise out of the sea to stain the horizon and spread over the eastern sky the veins and arteries of the new day. Sunday the 25th. He had made that appointment five days ago and it was one that he would keep. But, lying there in the dunes, he hadn\x{2019}t known what he knew now, that he had another and very different appointment to keep on Sunday 25 September.",

The ground, with its mat of pine needles on the sand, was unlikely to yield footprints, but it was important that it shouldn\x{2019}t be disturbed. Moving carefully, he backed away from the body, then walked about twenty yards to the south along a ridge of fine shingle. By the light of his torch, half-crouching, he tracked his way through the densely planted pine trees, snapping off the brittle lower twigs as he passed. At least he could be certain that no one had recently passed this way. Within minutes he had gained the road; another ten of brisk walking and he would be at the mill. But the nearest telephone would be at Hilary Robarts\x{2019}s cottage. The probability was that the cottage was locked, and he had no intention of breaking in. It was almost as important to leave the victim\x{2019}s house undisturbed as it was not to violate the scene of the crime. There had been no handbag beside her body, nothing but the shoes and torch neatly placed at the head of the hollow, the track suit and the brightly striped red-and-blue beach towel on which she partly lay. Perhaps she had left the key at home, the cottage unlocked. On the headland, after dark, few people would worry if they left a cottage unlocked for half an hour.

She seated herself in the armchair with the calm assurance of an applicant for a job which she has every confidence of getting, and answered Rickards\x{2019}s questions calmly and without emotion except when he attempted to probe into Hilary Robarts\x{2019}s relationship with the Director. Then when she permitted herself a moue of distaste that anyone could be so vulgarly inquisitive about matters which were not his concern, she answered repressively that Dr. Mair had never confided in her about his private life. She admitted that she knew Hilary Robarts made a habit of swimming at night and kept this up well into the autumn months and sometimes later. She thought the fact was generally known at Larksoken. Miss Robarts had been a strong and enthusiastic swimmer. She was not particularly interested in the Whistler except to take reasonable precautions and avoid walking alone at night, and she knew nothing about his methods except what she had read in the newspapers, that he strangled his victims. She had known about the dinner party at Martyr\x{2019}s Cottage on Thursday, she thought Miles Lessingham might have mentioned it, but no one had discussed with her the events of the evening and she saw no reason why they should. As for her own movements on Sunday, she had spent the whole of the evening, from <<six o\x{2019}clock|6>>, at her bungalow with her boyfriend, Jonathan Reeves. They had been together continually until he had left, at <<about 10.30|9c:1>>. Her cool glance at Oliphant challenged him to ask her what they had been doing, and he resisted the temptation except to ask what they had drunk and eaten. Asked about her relationship with Hilary Robarts, she said that she had greatly respected her but hadn\x{2019}t particularly liked or disliked her. Their professional relationship had been perfectly friendly, but she couldn\x{2019}t recall ever meeting her outside the power station. As far as she knew, Miss Robarts had no enemies, and she had no idea who could have wished her dead. When the door had closed after her Rickards said: \x{201c}We\x{2019}ll check her alibi, of course, but there\x{2019}s no hurry. Let young Reeves sweat for an hour or so.

Alice Mair received them calmly at the door with no apparent sign either of anxiety or of curiosity, glanced perfunctorily at their identity cards and invited them in. They might, Rickards thought, have been technicians arriving later than expected to repair the television set. And they were, he saw, expected to interview her in the kitchen. At first it struck him as an odd choice but then, looking round, he supposed you could hardly call it a kitchen: more like an office, sitting room and kitchen combined. Its size surprised him and he found himself wondering irrelevantly whether she had knocked down a wall to provide such overgenerous working space. He wondered, too, what Susie would think of it and decided that she would find it unsettling. Susie liked her house to be clearly defined by function; the kitchen was for working, the dining room for eating, the lounge for watching television and the bedroom for sleeping and, once a week, for making love. He and Oliphant sat in two cushioned, high-backed wicker chairs on each side of the fireplace. His was extremely comfortable, gently containing his long limbs.

But there was something stronger than dislike about this killing. And this may surprise you, Mr. Dalgliesh. Robarts wasn\x{2019}t particularly unpopular with the senior staff.

Ever tried questioning a child to discover if her dad\x{2019}s a murderer while she\x{2019}s sitting there gazing at you with those huge reproachful eyes and nursing a baby? I suggested that she hand the kid over to one of the WPCs, but as soon as she tried to take him he immediately started up a howling. Wouldn\x{2019}t let his dad take him either. You\x{2019}d think that Theresa and he had arranged it between them. And Ryan Blaney was there too, of course, throughout the interview.

Instantly awake, he threw back the bedclothes and stumbled over to peer at himself in the glass of his wife\x{2019}s dressing table. The dressing table, kidney-shaped, was trimmed with pink-and-white flowered voile, the pretty matching set of ring-stand and tray still neatly in place, a stuffed doll which Susie had won at a fair as a child hanging from the side of the glass. Only her jars of make-up were missing, and their absence suddenly struck him as poignantly as if she were dead and they had been disposed of with the unimportant detritus of a life. What, he wondered, bending low to look more closely into the glass, had anything in this pink-and-white, utterly feminine bedroom to do with that gaunt face, that rough, masculine torso? He experienced again what he had felt initially when they first moved in a month after the honeymoon, that nothing in the house was truly his. When he was a young DC he would have been amazed had anyone told him that he would achieve such a house, a gravel sweep of drive, its own half-acre of garden, a drawing room and separate dining room, each with its carefully chosen suite of furniture which still smelt pristine new, reminding him, every time he entered, of the Oxford Street department store in which it had been chosen.

I was on my own in the caravan; Amy had taken the van into Norwich to shop and said she wanted to see a film and would be back late. I was looking after Timmy.

I\x{2019}d lit the stove, because there were a lot of Timmy\x{2019}s clothes which needed drying, so the caravan was very hot and rather damp. When I remember that night I seem to see him through a haze of steam. After the beer he asked if we couldn\x{2019}t go out. He seemed restless, as if he found the caravan claustrophobic, and he asked more than once when Amy was expected back. So I lifted Timmy out of his cot and put him into the backpack and we set off to walk north along the shore. It was when we had got as far as the abbey ruins that he told me what he\x{2019}d come to say. He came out with it quite baldly, without any preamble. He\x{2019}d come to the conclusion that nuclear power was too dangerous to use and that, until we\x{2019}ve solved the problem of radioactive waste, we ought not to build any more nuclear-power stations.

But he was restless. Faced with a few hours of leisure, he was uncertain what to do with them.

As he sat, trying to summon the energy even to wash up, the familiar depression settled on him, the sense that he was a stranger in his own house. He had felt more at home in that fire-lit, stone-walled room at Larksoken Mill, drinking Dalgliesh\x{2019}s whisky, than he did here in his own sitting room, in his familiar, tightly upholstered chair, eating his own food. And it wasn\x{2019}t only the absence of Susie, the heavily pregnant ghost in the opposite chair. He found himself comparing the two rooms, seeking in his different responses a clue to the deepening depression of which the sitting room seemed partly a symbol, partly a cause. It wasn\x{2019}t only that the mill had a real wood fire, hissing and spitting real sparks and smelling of autumn, while his was synthetic, or that Dalgliesh\x{2019}s furniture was old, polished by centuries of use, arranged purely for convenience, not for show, not even that the paintings were real oils, genuine water-colours, or that the whole room had been put together with no apparent sense that anything in it was particularly highly regarded for its own sake. Above all, he decided, the difference surely lay in the books, the two walls covered with shelves holding books of every age and description, books for use, for pleasure in the reading and the handling. His own small collection, and Susie\x{2019}s, was in the bedroom. Susie had decreed that the books were too diverse, too tattered to be worthy of a place in what she called the \x{201c}lounge,\x{201d} and there weren\x{2019}t many of them. In recent years he had had so little time for reading: a collection of modern adventure novels in paperback, four volumes from a book club to which, for a couple of years, he had belonged, a few hardback travel books, police manuals, Susie\x{2019}s school prizes for neatness and needlework. But a child should be brought up with books. He had read somewhere that it was the best possible beginning to life, to be surrounded with books, to have parents who encouraged reading. Perhaps they could fit shelves each side of the fireplace and make a start. Dickens: he had enjoyed Dickens at school; Shakespeare, of course, and the major English poets.

All right, the timing is tight, but it\x{2019}s not impossible if Robarts swam earlier than usual. It adds up to a reasonable case. Not one which would have justified arresting them if they were still living, but enough to make it difficult to get a conviction against anyone else.\x{201d}",
