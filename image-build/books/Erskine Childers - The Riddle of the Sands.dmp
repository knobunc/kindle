            "I HAVE read of men who, when forced by their calling to live for long periods in utter solitude \x{2013} save for a few black faces \x{2013} have made it a rule to dress regularly for dinner in order to maintain their self-respect and prevent a relapse into barbarism. It was in some such spirit, with an added touch of self-consciousness, that, at <<seven o\x{2019}clock in the evening|6>> of September 23 in a recent year, I was making my evening toilet in my chambers in Pall Mall. I thought the date and the place justified the parallel: to my advantage even; for the obscure Burmese administrator might well be a man of blunted sensibilities and coarse fibre, and at least he is alone with nature, while I \x{2013} well, a young man of condition and fashion, who knows the right people, belongs to the right clubs, has a safe, possibly a brilliant future in the Foreign Office, may be excused for a sense of complacent martyrdom, when, with his keen appreciation of the social calendar, he is doomed to the outer solitude of London in September. I say \x{2018}martyrdom,\x{2019} but in fact the case was infinitely worse. For to feel oneself a martyr, as everybody knows, is a pleasurable thing, and the true tragedy of my position was that I had passed that stage. I had enjoyed what sweets it had to offer in ever dwindling degree since the middle of August, when ties were still fresh and sympathy abundant. I had been conscious that I was missed at Morven Lodge party. Lady Ashleigh herself had said so in the kindest possible manner, when she wrote to acknowledge the letter in which I explained, with an effectively

austere reserve of language, that circumstances compelled me to remain at my office. \x{2018}We know how busy you must be just now,\x{2019} she wrote, \x{2018}and I do hope you won\x{2019}t overwork: we shall all miss you very much.\x{2019} Friend after friend \x{2018}got away\x{2019} to sport and fresh air with promises to write and chaffing condolences, and, as each deserted the sinking ship, I took a grim delight in my misery, positively almost enjoying the first week or two after my world had been finally dissipated to the four bracing winds of heaven. I began to take a spurious interest in the remaining five millions, and wrote several clever letters in a vein of cheap satire, indirectly suggesting the pathos of my position, but indicating that I was broadminded enough to find intellectual entertainment in the scenes, persons, and habits of London in the dead season. I even did rational things at the instigation of others. For, though I should have liked total isolation best, I of course found that there was a sediment of unfortunates like myself who, unlike me, viewed the situation in a most prosaic light. There were river excursions, and so on, after office-hours; but I dislike the river at any time for its noisy vulgarity, and most of all at this season. So I dropped out of the fresh-air brigade and declined H\x{2014}\x{2014}\x{2019}s offer to share a riverside cottage and run up to town in the mornings. I did spend one or two week-ends with the Catesbys in Kent; but I was not inconsolable when they let their house and went abroad, for I found that such partial compensations did not suit me. Neither did the taste for satirical observation last. A passing thirst, which I dare say many have shared, for adventures of the fascinating kind described in the New Arabian Nights led me on a few evenings into some shady haunts in Soho and farther eastward; but was finally quenched one sultry Saturday night after an hour\x{2019}s immersion in the reeking atmosphere of a low music-hall in Ratcliffe Highway, where I sat next a portly female who suffered from the heat, and at frequent intervals refreshed herself and an infant from a bottle of tepid stout.",

            "By the first week in September I had abandoned all palliatives and had settled into the dismal but dignified routine of office, club, and chambers. And now came the most cruel trial, for the hideous truth dawned on me that the world I found so indispensable could after all dispense with me. It was all very well for Lady Ashleigh to assure me that I was deeply missed; but a letter from F\x{2014}\x{2014}, who was one of the party, written \x{2018}in haste, just starting to shoot,\x{2019} and coming as a tardy reply to one of my cleverest, made me aware that the house party had suffered little from my absence, and that few sighs were wasted on me, even in the quarter which I had assumed to have been discreetly alluded to by the underlined all in Lady Ashleigh\x{2019}s \x{2018}we shall all miss you.\x{2019} A thrust which smarted more, if it bit less deeply, came from my cousin Nesta, who wrote: \x{2018}It\x{2019}s horrid for you to have to be baking in London now; but, after all, it must be a great pleasure to you\x{2019} (malicious little wretch!) \x{2018}to have such interesting and important work to do.\x{2019} Here was a nemesis for an innocent illusion I had been accustomed to foster in the minds of my relations and acquaintances, especially in the breasts of the trustful and admiring maidens whom I had taken down to dinner in the last two seasons; a fiction which I had almost reached the point of believing in myself. For the plain truth was that my work was neither interesting nor important, and consisted chiefly at present in smoking cigarettes, in saying that Mr So-and-so was away and would be back about October 1, in being absent for lunch from <<twelve till two|10>>, and in my spare moments making pr\x{e9}cis of \x{2013} let us say \x{2013} the less confidential consular reports, and squeezing the results into cast-iron schedules. The reason of my detention was not a cloud on the international horizon \x{2013} though I may say in passing that there was such a cloud; but a caprice on the part of a remote and mighty personage, the effect of which, ramifying downwards, had dislocated the carefully laid holiday plans of the humble juniors, and in my own small case had

upset the arrangement between myself and K\x{2014}\x{2014}, who positively liked the dog-days in Whitehall.",

For the eleven-shilling oilskins I was referred to a villainous den in a back street, which the

shopman said they always recommended, and where a dirty and bejewelled Hebrew chaffered with me (beginning at 18s.) over two reeking orange slabs distantly resembling moieties of the human figure.

Stars were bright, summer scents from the Kent cliffs mingled coyly with vulgar steamer-smells; the summer weather held immutably. Nature, for her part, seemed resolved to be no party to my penance, but to be imperturbably bent on shedding mild ridicule over my wrongs. An irresistible sense of peace and detachment combined with that delicious physical awakening that pulses through the nerve-sick townsman when city airs and bald routine are left behind him, combined to provide me, however thankless a subject, with a solid background of resignation. Stowing this safely away, I could calculate my intentions with cold egotism. If the weather held I might pass a not intolerable fortnight with Davies. When it broke up, as it was sure to, I could easily excuse myself from the pursuit of the problematical ducks; the wintry logic of facts would, in any case, decide him to lay up his yacht, for he would scarcely think of sailing home at such a season. I could then take a chance lying ready of spending a few weeks in Dresden or elsewhere. I settled this programme comfortably and then turned in.',

with having committed a grave offence against maritime law in having \x{2018}cooked\x{2019} his log; but I checked myself, I scarcely know why, probably because I guessed the joke would touch a sensitive place and fail. Delicacy shrank from seeing him compelled either to amplify a deception or blunder out a confession \x{2013} he was too easy a prey; and, after all, the matter was of small moment.

diary, but I could not fix my attention. Every loose article in the boat became audibly restless. Cans clinked, cupboards rattled, lockers uttered hollow groans. Small things sidled out of dark hiding-places, and danced grotesque drunken figures on the floor, like goblins in a haunted glade.

            "Sometimes we were tramping vast solitudes of sand, sometimes scudding across ephemeral tracts of shallow sea. Again, we were creeping gingerly round the deeper arteries that surround the Great Knecht, examining their convolutions as it were the veins of a living tissue, and the circulation of the tide throbbing through them like blood. Again, we would be staggering through the tide-rips and overfalls that infest the open fairway of the Weser on our passage between the Fork and the Pike. On one of our fine days I saw the scene of Davies\x{2019}s original adventure by daylight with the banks dry and the channels manifest. The reader has seen it on the chart and can up to a point form his opinion; I can only add that I realized

by ocular proof that no more fatal trap could have been devised for an innocent stranger; for approaching it from the north-west under the easiest conditions it was hard enough to verify our true course. In a period so full of new excitements it is not easy for me to say when we were hardest put to it, especially as it was a rule with Davies never to admit that we were in any danger at all. But I think that our ugliest experience was on the 10th, when, owing to some minute miscalculation, we stranded in a dangerous spot. Mere stranding, of course, was all in the day\x{2019}s work; the constantly recurring question being when and where to court or risk it. This time we were so situated that when the rising tide came again we were on a lee-shore, broadside on to a gale of wind which was sending a nasty sea \x{2013} with a three-mile drift to give it force \x{2013} down Robin\x{2019}s Balje, which is one of the deeper arteries I spoke of above, and now lay dead to windward of us. The climax came <<about ten o\x{2019}clock at night|6>>. \x{2018}We can do nothing till she floats,\x{2019} said Davies; and I can see him now quietly smoking and splicing a chafed warp while he explained that her double skin of teak fitted her to stand anything in reason. She certainly had a terrific test that night, for the bottom was hard unyielding sand, on which she rose and fell with convulsive vehemence. The last half-hour was for me one of almost intolerable tension. I spent it on deck, unable to bear the suspense below. Sheets of driven sea flew bodily over the hull, and a score of times I thought she must succumb as she shivered to the blows of her keel on the sand. But those stout skins knit by honest labour stood the trial. One final thud and she wrenched herself bodily free, found her anchor and rode clear.",

If we were innocent travellers, he was the genial host, communicative and helpful. If we were spies, his tactics had been equally applicable. He had outdone us in apparent candour, hiding nothing which he knew we would discover for ourselves, and contriving at the same time both to gain knowledge and control of our movements, and to convey us warnings, which would only be understood if we were guilty, that we were playing an idle and perilous game, and had better desist.

fear of suggesting to Davies suspicions which he might never have felt. Indeed, I thought I detected that fear underlying his whole attitude towards us, and it strengthened a conviction which had been growing in me since Grimm\x{2019}s furtive <<midnight|13>> visit, that the secret of this coast was of so important and delicate a nature that rather than attract attention to it at all, overt action against intruders would only be taken in the last resort, and on irrefragable proofs of guilty intention.",

            "Now for our clues. I had come away with two, each the germ of a distinct theory, and both obscured by the prevailing ambiguity. Now, however, as we thumbed the chart and I gave full rein to my fancy, one of them, the idea of Memmert, gained precision and vigour every moment. True, such information as we had about the French wreck and his own connection with it was placed most readily at our disposal by von Br\x{fc}ning; but I took it to be information calculated only to forestall suspicion, since he was aware that we already associated him with Dollmann, possibly also with Grimm, and it was only likely that in the ordinary course we should learn that the trio were jointly concerned in Memmert. So much for the facts; as for the construction he wished us to put on them, I felt sure it was absolutely false. He wished to give us the impression that the buried treasure itself was at the root of any mystery we might have scented. I do not know if the reader fully appreciated that astute suggestion \x{2013} the hint that secrecy as to results was necessary owing both to the great sum at stake and the flaw in the title, which he had been careful to inform us had passed through British hands. What he meant to imply was, \x{2018}Don\x{2019}t be surprised if you have <<midnight|13>> visitors; Englishmen prowling along this coast are suspected of being Lloyd\x{2019}s agents.\x{2019} An ingenious insinuation, which, at the time it was made, had caused me to contemplate a new and much more commonplace solution of our enigma than had ever occurred to us; but it was only a passing doubt, and I dismissed it altogether now.",

At first I had taken the advice partly as a test of our veracity (as I gave the reader to understand), and partly as an indirect method of lulling any suspicions which Grimm\x{2019}s <<midnight|13>> visit may have caused. Then it struck me that this might be over-subtlety on my part, and the idea recurred when the question of our future plans cropped up, and hampered me in deciding on a course. It returned again when von Br\x{fc}ning offered to tow us out in the evening. It was in my mind when I questioned him as to his business ashore, for it occurred to me that perhaps his landing here was not solely due to a wish to inspect the crew of the Dulcibella. Then came his perfectly frank explanation (with its sinister double entente for us), coupled with an invitation to me to accompany him to Esens. But, on the principle of \x{2018}timeo Danaos,\x{2019} etc., I instantly smelt a ruse; not that I dreamt that I was to be decoyed into captivity, but if there was anything here which we two might discover in the few hours left to us, it was an ingenious plan to remove the most observant of the two till the hour of departure.",

There was no change in the weather \x{2013} still the same stringent cold, with a high barometer, and only fickle flaws of air; but the morning was gloriously clear, except for a wreath or two of mist curling like smoke from the sea, and an attenuated belt of opaque fog on the northern horizon. The harbour lay open before us, and very commodious and civilized it looked enclosed between two long piers which ran quite half a mile out from the land to the roadstead (Riff-Gat, by name) where we lay. A stranger might have taken it for a deep and spacious haven; but this of course was an illusion, due to the high water. Davies knew that three-quarters of it was mud, the remainder being a dredged-out channel along the western pier. A couple of tugs, a dredger, and a ferry packet with steam up, were moored on that side, a small stack of galliots on the other. Beyond these was another vessel, a galliot in build, but radiant as a queen among sluts; her varnished sides and spars flashing orange in the sun. These and her snow-white sail-covers and the twinkle of brass and gun-metal, proclaimed her to be a yacht. I had already studied her through the glasses and read on her stern Medusa. A couple of sailors were swabbing her decks; you could hear the sluish of the water and the scratching of deck-brooms. \x{2018}They can see us anyway,\x{2019} Davies had said.",

For me the man was the central figure; if I had attention to spare it was on him that I bestowed it; groping disgustfully after his hidden springs of action, noting the evidences of great gifts squandered and prostituted; questioning where he was most vulnerable; whom he feared most, us or his colleagues; whether he was open to remorse or shame; or whether he meditated further crime. The girl was incidental. After the first shock of surprise I had soon enough discovered that she, like the rest, had assumed a disguise; for she was far too innocent to sustain the deception, and yesterday was fresh in my memory. I was forced to continue turning her assumed character to account; but it would be pharisaical in me to say that I rose to any moral heights in her regard \x{2013} wine and excitement had deadened my better nature to that extent. I thought she looked prettier than ever, and, as time passed, I fell into a cynical carelessness about

her. This glimpse of her home life and the desperate expedients to which she was driven (whether by compulsion or from her own regard for Davies) to repel and dismiss him, did not strike me as they might have done as the crowning argument in favour of the course we had adopted the night before, that of compassing our end without noise and scandal, disarming Dollmann, but aiding him to escape from the allies he had betrayed. To Davies, the man, if not a pure abstraction, was at most a noxious vermin to be trampled on for the public good; while the girl, in her blackguardly surroundings and with her sinister future, had become the very source of his impulse.",

            "The pace, then, was execrable, and there were delays; we were behind time at Hengelo, thirty minutes late at Apeldoorn; so that I might well have grown nervous about my connections at Amsterdam, which were in some jeopardy. But as I battled out of my lethargy and began to take account of our position and prospects, quite a different thought at the outset affected me. Anxiety to reach London was swamped in reluctance to quit Germany, so that I found myself grudging every mile that I placed between me and the frontier. It was the old question of urgency. To-day was the the 23rd. The visit to London meant a minimum absence of forty-eight hours, counting from Amsterdam; that is to say, that by

travelling for two nights and one day, and devoting the other day to investigating Dollmann\x{2019}s past, it was humanly possible for me to be back on the Frisian coast on the evening of the 25th. Yes! I could be at Norden, if that was the \x{2018}rondezvous,\x{2019} at <<7 p.m.|5>> But what a scramble! No margin for delays, no physical respite. Some pasts take a deal of raking up \x{2013} other persons may be affected; men are cautious, they trip you up with red tape; or the man who knows is out at lunch \x{2013} a protracted lunch; or in the country \x{2013} a protracted week-end. Will you see Mr So-and-so, or leave a note? Oh! I know those public departments \x{2013} from the inside. And the Admiralty! .\x{a0}.\x{a0}. I saw myself baffled and racing back the same night to Germany, with two days wasted, arriving, good for nothing, at Norden, with no leisure to reconnoitre my ground; to be baffled again there, probably, for you cannot always count on fogs (as Davies said). Esens was another clue, and to follow \x{2018}Burmer\x{2019} \x{2013} there was something in that notion. But I wanted time, and had I time? How long could Davies maintain himself at Norderney? Not so very long, from what I remembered of last night. And was he even safe there? A feverish dream recurred to me \x{2013} a dream of Davies in a diving-dress; of a regrettable hitch in the air-supply\x{2014} Stop, that was nonsense! .\x{a0}.\x{a0}. Let us be sane. What matter if he had to go? What matter if I took my time in London? Then with a flood of shame I saw Davies\x{2019}s wistful face on the quay, heard his grim ejaculation: \x{2018}He\x{2019}s our game or no one\x{2019}s\x{2019}; and my own sullen: \x{2018}Oh, I\x{2019}ll keep the secret!\x{2019} London was utterly impossible. If I found my informant, what credentials had I, what claim to confidences? None, unless I told the whole story. Why, my mere presence in Whitehall would imperil the secret; for, once on my native heath, I should be recognized \x{2013} possibly haled to judgment; at the best should escape in a cloud of rumour \x{2013} \x{2018}last heard of at Norderney\x{2019}; \x{2018}only this morning was raising Cain at the Admiralty about a mythical lieutenant.\x{2019} No!

The creek he spoke of, though barely visible on the map,1 flowed into the Ems Estuary in a south-westerly direction. The \x{2018}night-train\x{2019} tallied to perfection, for high tide in the creek would be, as Davies estimated, between <<10.30|5a:1>> and <<11 p.m.|5>> on the night of the 25th; and the time-table showed that the only night train arriving at Norden was one from the south at <<10.46 p.m.|2a>> This looked promising.

that this canal was only one of several; that in concentrating myself on Esens and Bensersiel, I had forgotten that there were other villages ending in siel, also furnished on the chart with corkscrew streams; and, moreover, that B\x{f6}hme\x{2019}s statistics of depth and distance had been marshalled in seven categories, A to G. The very first match brought full recollection as to the villages. The suffix siel repeated itself all round the coast-line. Five miles eastward of Bensersiel was Neuharlingersiel, and further on Carolinensiel. Four miles westward was Dornumersiel; and further on Nessmersiel and Hilgenriedersiel. That was six on the north coast of the peninsula alone. On the west coast, facing the Ems, there was only one, Greetsiel, a good way south of Norden. But on the east, facing the Jade, there were no less than eight, at very close intervals. A moment\x{2019}s thought and I disregarded this latter group; they had nothing to do with Esens, nor had they any imaginable raison d\x{2019}\x{ea}tre as veins for commerce; differing markedly in this respect from the group of six on the north coast, whose outlook was the chain of islands, and whose inland centre, almost exactly, was Esens. I still wanted one to make seven, and as a working hypothesis added the solitary Greetsiel. At all seven villages streams debouched, as at Bensersiel. From all seven points of issue dotted lines were marked seaward, intersecting the great tidal sands and leading towards the islands. And on the mainland behind the whole sevenfold system ran the loop of railway. But there were manifold minor points of difference. No stream boasted so deep and decisive a blue line as did Benser Tief; none penetrated so far into the Hinterland. They varied in length and sinuosity. <<Two|9k:0>>, those belonging to Hilgenriedersiel and Greetsiel, appeared not to reach the railway at all.
