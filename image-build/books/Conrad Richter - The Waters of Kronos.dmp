Like the time we had to dig two graves in one day and they got Bob Bender and Ike Zerbe to dig the other one. Bob had his bottle along and when Check here and me went over and seen what they dug, we had to go to the preacher. \x{2018}You got to get that straightened out tonight, Parra\x{2019} we told him. \x{2018}There ain\x{2019}t no coffin made\x{2019}ll ever fit that grave.\x{2019} It was hooked like a sickle.

            "He started up the Methodist church hill. How incredibly quiet and peaceful it was. Nothing had changed. The sidewalk, moist and slippery as when he was a boy, still shone faintly in the darkness, reflecting unseen light. You had to lift your feet to keep from stumbling over the unpredictable bulges where unseen roots had lifted the bricks in giant mole-like waves. He passed the house of Mr. Nagle, chief clerk for the Markles, who owned Primrose Colliery. It had the peculiar dreamlike look of certain houses when he was young, of importance without and hushed withdrawal from the world within. Across the street the white horse of Dr. Sypher, who had brought him into the world, stood hitched to the buggy, head drooping, perhaps asleep. At the top of the hill was the old post office, tinier than ever in its square boxlike building that had once been a squire\x{2019}s office. It must be <<after six o\x{2019}clock in the evening|6>> but the stamp window was still up, with Katie Gerber calmly reading someone\x{2019}s paper behind the partition of call and lock boxes. No one was visible on the public side. In an hour it would be jammed with townspeople chatting to each other, waiting for the <<seven-thirty|5k:1>> mail from Lebanon to be \x{201c}changed,\x{201d} everyone keeping an eye on his or her box not to miss when a letter or paper might be popped in.",

It was as it had always been, the yellow oak chairs and buffet, the deep windows, the cubbyhole closets and the door that led out to the children\x{2019}s schoolroom. There were the same smells, of old leatherbound books, of cigar ashes, of the Rayo lamp and from the kitchen below.

Not until he was in his sixties had he learned that they were sacred among the ancients. He thought he could feel them like leafy idols over his head tonight, listening to his step, watching him without eyes, aware of his whole past. This was where he had played soldier with a wooden gun. And here under the biggest tree on Kronos Street, that some said had grown gross from human phosphates washed underground in the old hollow from the cemetery, was where as a child he had first noticed the changed track of the sun, that in October it was already dark at <<six|9c:0>>. Beyond this tree he was setting foot in the home square, another very long square, the middle so far from lampposts that the gloom of foliage overhead confused him. He was uncertain whose house was whose. Only his feet knew, taking him unerringly to the steps they had run up so often and blindly as a boy.",

He was tired and if resurrection came before he got rested, he\x{2019}d be \x{201c}grichlich.\x{201d} It was a long entertaining story full of Manny\x{2019}s talk together with what his wife said and what Pap-pa and the grave digger said.
