            "The search party began its search <<just before noon|10>>. It was a hundred and fifty volunteers strong; Henri Arlien may not have been popular but both Therese and Loong had a number of friends. Therese came to join the party but I sent her home with two of her friends. I didn\x{2019}t want to run the risk of her coming across Joe\x{2019}s body. Jane blocked off search areas for small groups and required each group to stay in voice contact with one another. Savitri and Beata, who had become friends despite their interesting failure of a date, searched with me, Savitri keeping a tight grip on an old-style compass she had traded for with a Mennonite sometime before. Jane, some measure down the woods, was accompanied by Zo\x{eb} and Hickory and Dickory. I wasn\x{2019}t entirely thrilled with Zo\x{eb} being part of the search squad, but between Jane and the Obin she was probably safer in the woods than back home in Croatoan.",
