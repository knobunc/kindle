            "We got to Luxor and fought our way out of the station through the dragomen and the sellers of scarabs and black basilisk heads of Rameses the Second and flywhisks and each other\x{2019}s sisters and got a room at the Winter Palace. We went to bed and stayed there till the late afternoon. We lay naked on the bed with the <<midday|13>> sun slicing in stripes through the shutters; we made love more times than I would have thought possible. He had five days\x{2019} leave. The first I had known of it was his voice on the phone asking if I could get away for a long weekend. He had been up at the front and he\x{2019}d be going back there next week. Or to wherever the front by then was \x{2013} that indeterminate confusion of minefields and dispositions of vehicles in the empty neutral sand. He once described it to me as more like a war fought at sea than on land, a sequence of advances and retreats in which the participants related only to each other and barely at all to the landscape across which they moved. A war in which there was nothing to get in the way \x{2013} no towns, no villages, no people \x{2013} and nothing tangible to gain or lose. In which you fought for possession of a barely detectable rocky ridge, or a map position. In which there were suddenly hundreds of thousands of men where there had been nothing, but still the place remained empty. He spoke of the desert as being like the board in some game in which opposing sides manoeuvred from square to square; I used the image in a despatch and got a pat on the back from London office and told him I should have given him a credit. He said he\x{2019}d wait for that till after the war.",

            "\x{2018}If you insist. It\x{2019}s an unexceptional story, at that. Born in the home counties to parents of moderate but sufficient means. Father a schoolmaster, mother a\x{2026} mother. Childhood marred only by unconfessed fear of large dogs and the patronage of my sister. Schooldays distinguished for inability to construe Latin and ineptitude with a cricket bat. Youth\x{2026} Well, youth becomes perhaps marginally more interesting, our hero is seen to become somewhat less torpid, egocentric, introverted etc. \x{2013} in fact to start paying a bit of attention to other people and indeed to show vaguely idealistic tendencies, desire to reform the world and so forth.\x{2019} \x{2018}Ah,\x{2019} sighs Claudia. \x{2018}One of those\x{2026}\x{2019} \x{2018}One of those. Do you disapprove?\x{2019} \x{2018}Certainly not. Go on. What did you do about it?\x{2019} \x{2018}All the usual innocent enthusiastic things. Joining worthy organisations. Attending political meetings. Reading books. Talking late into the night with like-minded cronies.\x{2019} \x{2018}Innocent?\x{2019} says Claudia. \x{2018}What\x{2019}s innocent about that? Practical, I\x{2019}d call it.\x{2019} \x{2018}Hush \x{2013} this is my story, and I\x{2019}ll tell it my way. Autobiographers are entitled to editorial comment. So\x{2026} Period of youthful social indignation culminating in a stint as reporter on a northern provincial paper \x{2013} did you ever visit the north-east during the Depression?\x{2019} Claudia ponders. \x{2018}If you have to think about it,\x{2019} says Tom, \x{2018}then you didn\x{2019}t. It wonderfully concentrated the mind, I\x{2019}ll tell you that. Hampshire was never the same again. So anyway, fired by the dole queues I decided politics was the only career \x{2013} I mean, it was obvious, at <<twenty-three|9:0>>, one would be able to set the world to rights in a trice, given the opportunity, quite simple, I had it all tied up, my personal manifesto \x{2013} education, opportunity, social welfare, re-distribution of income.\x{2019} \x{2018}So\x{2026}\x{2019} says Claudia. \x{2019}Why\x{2026}?\x{2019} \x{2018}Why didn\x{2019}t it work out like that? Because as you and I both know now that is not how things are. Our feckless hero bites the dust as aspiring politician and looks around to see what comes next. Having grown older by a year or two and learned a little wisdom if not a lot. In fact, having realised that he is by and large an ignorant so-and-so and there is no prospect of confounding your enemies until you have the arguments with which to do it. So I thought I\x{2019}d better keep my mouth shut and my eyes and ears open for a bit. An aunt left me a small legacy and I blew it on the fare to America. Have a look at the land of the free, I thought. Learn a thing or two. Look and listen. Earn a few bob writing the odd article. So I did. And came back older and wiser still.\x{2019} \x{2018}Look here,\x{2019} says Claudia. \x{2018}You\x{2019}re missing out great chunks of this story.\x{2019} \x{2018}I know. We haven\x{2019}t got time for all of it. Not now. We\x{2019}re sticking to essentials. America. The mid-west. The south. Social outrage again, but more reflective now. Journalism. Sober, considered journalism. A few small successes in that line.\x{2019} \x{2018}You should be doing what I\x{2019}m doing,\x{2019} says Claudia. \x{2018}In fact why didn\x{2019}t you\x{2026}?\x{2019} \x{2018}I wish you wouldn\x{2019}t anticipate. We haven\x{2019}t got to that bit yet. The Nazis are nothing more than a disagreeable noise across the Channel at the moment. And our hero rather fancies himself now as a traveller.\x{2019} \x{2018}Stop saying our hero,\x{2019} says Claudia. \x{2018}It sounds like the Boy\x{2019}s Own Paper.\x{2019} \x{2018}What a well-read girl you are. I thought the reference might escape you. As I say, I fancied myself as a traveller. I sold pieces on the plight of the Greek peasantry or chicanery among Italian politicians and when I couldn\x{2019}t do that I hawked myself around travel agencies as a courier. Got around most of Europe that way. Went once to Russia. Was thinking it was about time to turn my attention to Africa, see how one\x{2019}s dreams come true? And then the disagreeable noises from across the Channel began to get louder. To become distinctly disturbing.\x{2019} \x{2018}Yes,\x{2019} says Claudia, \x{2018}I want to say something.\x{2019} \x{2018}I thought you wanted me to do the talking?\x{2019} \x{2018}I do. It\x{2019}s just that you leave out the interesting part.\x{2019} \x{2018}I thought all this might be reasonably interesting.\x{2019} \x{2018}It is,\x{2019} says Claudia. \x{2018}But it\x{2019}s not very personal. I don\x{2019}t know much about how you\x{2019}re feeling. And,\x{2019} she adds lightly, \x{2018}I don\x{2019}t know if you\x{2019}re doing all this on your own or with someone else.\x{2019}",

Presently she must wake him and he must go to his hotel because the acute antennae of Madame Charlot would surely detect his presence in the morning; as it is, Tom and Claudia will have to creep down the stone stairs and open carefully the heavy front door.
