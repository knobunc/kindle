gives the impression that he knew nothing of the crash at the bank

watchman at the Traders\' Bank, tells a different story.  He says that
on the Thursday night before, <<about eight-thirty|9j>>, Bailey went back to
the bank.  Jonas admitted him, and he says the cashier was in a state
almost of collapse.  Bailey worked until <<midnight|13>>, then he closed the
vault and went away. The occurrence was so unusual that the watchman
pondered over it an the rest of the night.  What did Bailey do when he
went back to the Knickerbocker apartments that night?  He packed a
suit-case ready for instant departure.  But he held off too long; he
waited for something.  My personal opinion is that he waited to see
Miss Gertrude before flying from the country. Then, when he had shot
down Arnold Armstrong that night, he had to choose between two evils.
He did the thing that would immediately turn public opinion in his
favor, and surrendered himself, as an innocent man.  The strongest
thing against him is his preparation for flight, and his deciding to
come back after the murder of Arnold Armstrong.  He was shrewd enough

under-gardener\'s wife coming every day to help out. Fortunately, Warner
and the detectives were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge.  Out of
deference to Liddy they washed their dishes once a day, and they
concocted queer messes, according to their several abilities.  They had
one triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast, and that clung to
their clothes and their hair the rest of the day.  It was bacon,
hardtack and onions, fried together.  They were almost pathetically
grateful, however, I noticed, for an occasional broiled tenderloin.',
