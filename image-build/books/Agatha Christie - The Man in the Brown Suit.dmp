            "As I remarked once before, I am essentially a man of peace. I yearn for a quiet life\x{2014}and that\x{2019}s just the one thing I don\x{2019}t seem able to have. I am always in the middle of storms and alarms. The relief of getting away from Pagett with his incessant nosing out of intrigues was enormous, and Miss Pettigrew is certainly a useful creature. Although there is nothing of the houri about her, one or two of her accomplishments are invaluable. It is true that I had a touch of liver at Bulawayo and behaved like a bear in consequence, but I had had a disturbed night in the train. At <<3 am|5>> an exquisitely dressed young man looking like a musical-comedy hero of the Wild West entered my compartment and asked where I was going. Disregarding my first murmur of \x{201c}Tea\x{2014}and for God\x{2019}s sake don\x{2019}t put sugar in it,\x{201d} he repeated his question, laying stress on the fact that he was not a waiter but an Immigration officer. I finally succeeded in satisfying him that I was suffering from no infectious disease, that I was visiting Rhodesia from the purest of motives, and further gratified him with my full Christian names and my place of birth. I then endeavoured to snatch a little sleep, but some officious ass aroused me at <<5:30|2>> with a cup of liquid sugar which he called tea. I don\x{2019}t think I threw it at him, but I know that that was what I wanted to do. He brought me unsugared tea, stone cold, at <<6|9e>>, and I then fell asleep utterly exhausted, to awaken just outside Bulawayo and be landed with a beastly wooden giraffe, all legs and neck!",
