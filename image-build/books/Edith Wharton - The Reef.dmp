            "Almost as soon as the train left Calais her head had dropped back into the corner, and she had fallen asleep. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sitting opposite, in the compartment from which he had contrived to have other travellers excluded, Darrow looked at her curiously. He had never seen a face that changed so quickly. A moment since it had danced like a field of daisies in a summer breeze; now, under the pallid oscillating light of the lamp overhead, it wore the hard stamp of experience, as of a soft thing chilled into shape before its curves had rounded: and it moved him to see that care already stole upon her when she slept. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The story she had imparted to him in the wheezing shaking cabin, and at the Calais buffet--where he had insisted on offering her the dinner she had missed at Mrs. Murrett's-- had given a distincter outline to her figure. From the moment of entering the New York boarding-school to which a preoccupied guardian had hastily consigned her after the death of her parents, she had found herself alone in a busy and indifferent world. Her youthful history might, in fact, have been summed up in the statement that everybody had been too busy to look after her. Her guardian, a drudge in a big banking house, was absorbed by \"the office\"; the guardian's wife, by her health and her religion; and an elder sister, Laura, married, unmarried, remarried, and pursuing, through all these alternating phases, some vaguely \"artistic\" ideal on which the guardian and his wife looked askance, had (as Darrow conjectured) taken their disapproval as a pretext for not troubling herself about poor Sophy, to whom--perhaps for this reason--she had remained the incarnation of remote romantic possibilities. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In the course of time a sudden \"stroke\" of the guardian's had thrown his personal affairs into a state of confusion from which--after his widely lamented death--it became evident that it would not be possible to extricate his ward's inheritance. No one deplored this more sincerely than his widow, who saw in it one more proof of her husband's life having been sacrificed to the innumerable duties imposed on him, and who could hardly--but for the counsels of religion--have brought herself to pardon the young girl for her indirect share in hastening his end. Sophy did not resent this point of view. She was really much sorrier for her guardian's death than for the loss of her insignificant fortune. The latter had represented only the means of holding her in bondage, and its disappearance was the occasion of her immediate plunge into the wide bright sea of life surrounding the island-of her captivity. She had first landed--thanks to the intervention of the ladies who had directed her education--in a Fifth Avenue school-room where, for a few months, she acted as a buffer between three autocratic infants and their bodyguard of nurses and teachers. The too-pressing attentions of their father's valet had caused her to fly this sheltered spot, against the express advice of her educational superiors, who implied that, in their own case, refinement and self-respect had always sufficed to keep the most ungovernable passions at bay. The experience of the guardian's widow having been precisely similar, and the deplorable precedent of Laura's career being present to all their minds, none of these ladies felt any obligation to intervene farther in Sophy's affairs; and she was accordingly left to her own resources. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A schoolmate from the Rocky Mountains, who was taking her father and mother to Europe, had suggested Sophy's accompanying them, and \"going round\" with her while her progenitors, in the care of the courier, nursed their ailments at a fashionable bath. Darrow gathered that the \"going round\" with Mamie Hoke was a varied and diverting process; but this relatively brilliant phase of Sophy's career was cut short by the elopement of the inconsiderate Mamie with a \"matinee idol\" who had followed her from New York, and by the precipitate return of her parents to negotiate for the repurchase of their child. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It was then--after an interval of repose with compassionate but impecunious American friends in Paris--that Miss Viner had been drawn into the turbid current of Mrs. Murrett's career. The impecunious compatriots had found Mrs. Murrett for her, and it was partly on their account (because they were such dears, and so unconscious, poor confiding things, of what they were letting her in for) that Sophy had stuck it out so long in the dreadful house in Chelsea. The Farlows, she explained to Darrow, were the best friends she had ever had (and the only ones who had ever \"been decent\" about Laura, whom they had seen once, and intensely admired); but even after twenty years of Paris they were the most incorrigibly inexperienced angels, and quite persuaded that Mrs. Murrett was a woman of great intellectual eminence, and the house at Chelsea \"the last of the salons\" --Darrow knew what she meant? And she hadn't liked to undeceive them, knowing that to do so would be virtually to throw herself back on their hands, and feeling, moreover, after her previous experiences, the urgent need of gaining, at any cost, a name for stability; besides which--she threw it off with a slight laugh--no other chance, in all these years, had happened to come to her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She had brushed in this outline of her career with light rapid strokes, and in a tone of fatalism oddly untinged by bitterness. Darrow perceived that she classified people according to their greater or less \"luck\" in life, but she appeared to harbour no resentment against the undefined power which dispensed the gift in such unequal measure. Things came one's way or they didn't; and meanwhile one could only look on, and make the most of small compensations, such as watching \"the show\" at Mrs. Murrett's, and talking over the Lady Ulricas and other footlight figures. And at any moment, of course, a turn of the kaleidoscope might suddenly toss a bright spangle into the grey pattern of one's days. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} This light-hearted philosophy was not without charm to a young man accustomed to more traditional views. George Darrow had had a fairly varied experience of feminine types, but the women he had frequented had either been pronouncedly \"ladies\" or they had not. Grateful to both for ministering to the more complex masculine nature, and disposed to assume that they had been evolved, if not designed, to that end, he had instinctively kept the two groups apart in his mind, avoiding that intermediate society which attempts to conciliate both theories of life. \"Bohemianism\" seemed to him a cheaper convention than the other two, and he liked, above all, people who went as far as they could in their own line--liked his \"ladies\" and their rivals to be equally unashamed of showing for exactly what they were. He had not indeed--the fact of Lady Ulrica was there to remind him-- been without his experience of a third type; but that experience had left him with a contemptuous distaste for the woman who uses the privileges of one class to shelter the customs of another. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As to young girls, he had never thought much about them since his early love for the girl who had become Mrs. Leath. That episode seemed, as he looked back on it, to bear no more relation to reality than a pale decorative design to the confused richness of a summer landscape. He no longer understood the violent impulses and dreamy pauses of his own young heart, or the inscrutable abandonments and reluctances of hers. He had known a moment of anguish at losing her--the mad plunge of youthful instincts against the barrier of fate; but the first wave of stronger sensation had swept away all but the outline of their story, and the memory of Anna Summers had made the image of the young girl sacred, but the class uninteresting. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Such generalisations belonged, however, to an earlier stage of his experience. The more he saw of life the more incalculable he found it; and he had learned to yield to his impressions without feeling the youthful need of relating them to others. It was the girl in the opposite seat who had roused in him the dormant habit of comparison. She was distinguished from the daughters of wealth by her avowed acquaintance with the real business of living, a familiarity as different as possible from their theoretical proficiency; yet it seemed to Darrow that her experience had made her free without hardness and self-assured without assertiveness. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The rush into Amiens, and the flash of the station lights into their compartment, broke Miss Viner's sleep, and without changing her position she lifted her lids and looked at Darrow. There was neither surprise nor bewilderment in the look. She seemed instantly conscious, not so much of where she was, as of the fact that she was with him; and that fact seemed enough to reassure her. She did not even turn her head to look out; her eyes continued to rest on him with a vague smile which appeared to light her face from within, while her lips kept their sleepy droop. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Shouts and the hurried tread of travellers came to them through the confusing cross-lights of the platform. A head appeared at the window, and Darrow threw himself forward to defend their solitude; but the intruder was only a train hand going his round of inspection. He passed on, and the lights and cries of the station dropped away, merged in a wider haze and a hollower resonance, as the train gathered itself up with a long shake and rolled out again into the darkness. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Miss Viner's head sank back against the cushion, pushing out a dusky wave of hair above her forehead. The swaying of the train loosened a lock over her ear, and she shook it back with a movement like a boy's, while her gaze still rested on her companion. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You're not too tired?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She shook her head with a smile. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"We shall be in <<before midnight|13>>. We're very nearly on time.\" He verified the statement by holding up his watch to the lamp. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She nodded dreamily. \"It's all right. I telegraphed Mrs. Farlow that they mustn't think of coming to the station; but they'll have told the concierge to look out for me.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You'll let me drive you there?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She nodded again, and her eyes closed. It was very pleasant to Darrow that she made no effort to talk or to dissemble her sleepiness. He sat watching her till the upper lashes met and mingled with the lower, and their blent shadow lay on her cheek; then he stood up and drew the curtain over the lamp, drowning the compartment in a bluish twilight. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As he sank back into his seat he thought how differently Anna Summers--or even Anna Leath--would have behaved. She would not have talked too much; she would not have been either restless or embarrassed; but her adaptability, her appropriateness, would not have been nature but \"tact.\" The oddness of the situation would have made sleep impossible, or, if weariness had overcome her for a moment, she would have waked with a start, wondering where she was, and how she had come there, and if her hair were tidy; and nothing short of hairpins and a glass would have restored her self- possession... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The reflection set him wondering whether the \"sheltered\" girl's bringing-up might not unfit her for all subsequent contact with life. How much nearer to it had Mrs. Leath been brought by marriage and motherhood, and the passage of fourteen years? What were all her reticences and evasions but the result of the deadening process of forming a \"lady\"? The freshness he had marvelled at was like the unnatural whiteness of flowers forced in the dark. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As he looked back at their few days together he saw that their intercourse had been marked, on her part, by the same hesitations and reserves which had chilled their earlier intimacy. Once more they had had their hour together and she had wasted it. As in her girlhood, her eyes had made promises which her lips were afraid to keep. She was still afraid of life, of its ruthlessness, its danger and mystery. She was still the petted little girl who cannot be left alone in the dark...His memory flew back to their youthful story, and long-forgotten details took shape before him. How frail and faint the picture was! They seemed, he and she, like the ghostly lovers of the Grecian Urn, forever pursuing without ever clasping each other. To this day he did not quite know what had parted them: the break had been as fortuitous as the fluttering apart of two seed-vessels on a wave of summer air... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The very slightness, vagueness, of the memory gave it an added poignancy. He felt the mystic pang of the parent for a child which has just breathed and died. Why had it happened thus, when the least shifting of influences might have made it all so different? If she had been given to him then he would have put warmth in her veins and light in her eyes: would have made her a woman through and through. Musing thus, he had the sense of waste that is the bitterest harvest of experience. A love like his might have given her the divine gift of self-renewal; and now he saw her fated to wane into old age repeating the same gestures, echoing the words she had always heard, and perhaps never guessing that, just outside her glazed and curtained consciousness, life rolled away, a vast blackness starred with lights, like the night landscape beyond the windows of the train. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The engine lowered its speed for the passage through a sleeping station. In the light of the platform lamp Darrow looked across at his companion. Her head had dropped toward one shoulder, and her lips were just far enough apart for the reflection of the upper one to deepen the colour of the other. The jolting of the train had again shaken loose the lock above her ear. It danced on her cheek like the flit of a brown wing over flowers, and Darrow felt an intense desire to lean forward and put it back behind her ear.",

            "At the porter's desk a brief \"Pas de lettres\" fell destructively on the fabric of these hopes. Mrs. Leath had not written--she had not taken the trouble to explain her telegram. Darrow turned away with a sharp pang of humiliation. Her frugal silence mocked his prodigality of hopes and fears. He had put his question to the porter once before, on returning to the hotel after luncheon; and now, coming back again in the late afternoon, he was met by the same denial. The second post was in, and had brought him nothing. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A glance at his watch showed that he had barely time to dress before taking Miss Viner out to dine; but as he turned to the lift a new thought struck him, and hurrying back into the hall he dashed off another telegram to his servant: \"Have you forwarded any letter with French postmark today? Telegraph answer Terminus.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Some kind of reply would be certain to reach him on his return from the theatre, and he would then know definitely whether Mrs. Leath meant to write or not. He hastened up to his room and dressed with a lighter heart. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Miss Viner's vagrant trunk had finally found its way to its owner; and, clad in such modest splendour as it furnished, she shone at Darrow across their restaurant table. In the reaction of his wounded vanity he found her prettier and more interesting than before. Her dress, sloping away from the throat, showed the graceful set of her head on its slender neck, and the wide brim of her hat arched above her hair like a dusky halo. Pleasure danced in her eyes and on her lips, and as she shone on him between the candle-shades Darrow felt that he should not be at all sorry to be seen with her in public. He even sent a careless glance about him in the vague hope that it might fall on an acquaintance. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At the theatre her vivacity sank into a breathless hush, and she sat intent in her corner of their baignoire, with the gaze of a neophyte about to be initiated into the sacred mysteries. Darrow placed himself behind her, that he might catch her profile between himself and the stage. He was touched by the youthful seriousness of her expression. In spite of the experiences she must have had, and of the twenty-four years to which she owned, she struck him as intrinsically young; and he wondered how so evanescent a quality could have been preserved in the desiccating Murrett air. As the play progressed he noticed that her immobility was traversed by swift flashes of perception. She was not missing anything, and her intensity of attention when Cerdine was on the stage drew an anxious line between her brows. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} After the first act she remained for a few minutes rapt and motionless; then she turned to her companion with a quick patter of questions. He gathered from them that she had been less interested in following the general drift of the play than in observing the details of its interpretation. Every gesture and inflection of the great actress's had been marked and analyzed; and Darrow felt a secret gratification in being appealed to as an authority on the histrionic art. His interest in it had hitherto been merely that of the cultivated young man curious of all forms of artistic expression; but in reply to her questions he found things to say about it which evidently struck his listener as impressive and original, and with which he himself was not, on the whole, dissatisfied. Miss Viner was much more concerned to hear his views than to express her own, and the deference with which she received his comments called from him more ideas about the theatre than he had ever supposed himself to possess. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} With the second act she began to give more attention to the development of the play, though her interest was excited rather by what she called \"the story\" than by the conflict of character producing it. Oddly combined with her sharp apprehension of things theatrical, her knowledge of technical \"dodges\" and green-room precedents, her glibness about \"lines\" and \"curtains\", was the primitive simplicity of her attitude toward the tale itself, as toward something that was \"really happening\" and at which one assisted as at a street-accident or a quarrel overheard in the next room. She wanted to know if Darrow thought the lovers \"really would\" be involved in the catastrophe that threatened them, and when he reminded her that his predictions were disqualified by his having already seen the play, she exclaimed: \"Oh, then, please don't tell me what's going to happen!\" and the next moment was questioning him about Cerdine's theatrical situation and her private history. On the latter point some of her enquiries were of a kind that it is not in the habit of young girls to make, or even to know how to make; but her apparent unconsciousness of the fact seemed rather to reflect on her past associates than on herself. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When the second act was over, Darrow suggested their taking a turn in the foyer; and seated on one of its cramped red velvet sofas they watched the crowd surge up and down in a glare of lights and gilding. Then, as she complained of the heat, he led her through the press to the congested cafe at the foot of the stairs, where orangeades were thrust at them between the shoulders of packed consommateurs and Darrow, lighting a cigarette while she sucked her straw, knew the primitive complacency of the man at whose companion other men stare. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} On a corner of their table lay a smeared copy of a theatrical journal. It caught Sophy's eye and after poring over the page she looked up with an excited exclamation. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 'They're giving Oedipe tomorrow afternoon at the Francais! I suppose you've seen it heaps and heaps of times?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He smiled back at her. \"You must see it too. We'll go tomorrow.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She sighed at his suggestion, but without discarding it. \"How can I? The last train for Joigny leaves at <<four|9c:1>>.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But you don't know yet that your friends will want you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I shall know tomorrow early. I asked Mrs. Farlow to telegraph as soon as she got my letter.\" A twinge of compunction shot through Darrow. Her words recalled to him that on their return to the hotel after luncheon she had given him her letter to post, and that he had never thought of it again. No doubt it was still in the pocket of the coat he had taken off when he dressed for dinner. In his perturbation he pushed back his chair, and the movement made her look up at him. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"What's the matter?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Nothing. Only--you know I don't fancy that letter can have caught this afternoon's post.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Not caught it? Why not?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why, I'm afraid it will have been too late.\" He bent his head to light another cigarette. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She struck her hands together with a gesture which, to his amusement, he noticed she had caught from Cerdine. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, dear, I hadn't thought of that! But surely it will reach them in the morning?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Some time in the morning, I suppose. You know the French provincial post is never in a hurry. I don't believe your letter would have been delivered this evening in any case.\" As this idea occurred to him he felt himself almost absolved. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Perhaps, then, I ought to have telegraphed?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I'll telegraph for you in the morning if you say so.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The bell announcing the close of the entr'-acte shrilled through the cafe, and she sprang to her feet. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, come, come! We mustn't miss it!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Instantly forgetful of the Farlows, she slipped her arm through his and turned to push her way back to the theatre. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As soon as the curtain went up she as promptly forgot her companion. Watching her from the corner to which he had returned, Darrow saw that great waves of sensation were beating deliciously against her brain. It was as though every starved sensibility were throwing out feelers to the mounting tide; as though everything she was seeing, hearing, imagining, rushed in to fill the void of all she had always been denied. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow, as he observed her, again felt a detached enjoyment in her pleasure. She was an extraordinary conductor of sensation: she seemed to transmit it physically, in emanations that set the blood dancing in his veins. He had not often had the opportunity of studying the effects of a perfectly fresh impression on so responsive a temperament, and he felt a fleeting desire to make its chords vibrate for his own amusement. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At the end of the next act she discovered with dismay that in their transit to the cafe she had lost the beautiful pictured programme he had bought for her. She wanted to go back and hunt for it, but Darrow assured her that he would have no trouble in getting her another. When he went out in quest of it she followed him protestingly to the door of the box, and he saw that she was distressed at the thought of his having to spend an additional franc for her. This frugality smote Darrow by its contrast to her natural bright profusion; and again he felt the desire to right so clumsy an injustice. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When he returned to the box she was still standing in the doorway, and he noticed that his were not the only eyes attracted to her. Then another impression sharply diverted his attention. Above the fagged faces of the Parisian crowd he had caught the fresh fair countenance of Owen Leath signalling a joyful recognition. The young man, slim and eager, had detached himself from two companions of his own type, and was seeking to push through the press to his step- mother's friend. The encounter, to Darrow, could hardly have been more inopportune; it woke in him a confusion of feelings of which only the uppermost was allayed by seeing Sophy Viner, as if instinctively warned, melt back into the shadow of their box. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A minute later Owen Leath was at his side. \"I was sure it was you! Such luck to run across you! Won't you come off with us to supper after it's over? Montmartre, or wherever else you please. Those two chaps over there are friends of mine, at the Beaux Arts; both of them rather good fellows-- and we'd be so glad----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} For half a second Darrow read in his hospitable eye the termination \"if you'd bring the lady too\"; then it deflected into: \"We'd all be so glad if you'd come.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow, excusing himself with thanks, lingered on for a few minutes' chat, in which every word, and every tone of his companion's voice, was like a sharp light flashed into aching eyes. He was glad when the bell called the audience to their seats, and young Leath left him with the friendly question: \"We'll see you at Givre later on?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When he rejoined Miss Viner, Darrow's first care was to find out, by a rapid inspection of the house, whether Owen Leath's seat had given him a view of their box. But the young man was not visible from it, and Darrow concluded that he had been recognized in the corridor and not at his companion's side. He scarcely knew why it seemed to him so important that this point should be settled; certainly his sense of reassurance was less due to regard for Miss Viner than to the persistent vision of grave offended eyes... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} During the drive back to the hotel this vision was persistently kept before him by the thought that the evening post might have brought a letter from Mrs. Leath. Even if no letter had yet come, his servant might have telegraphed to say that one was on its way; and at the thought his interest in the girl at his side again cooled to the fraternal, the almost fatherly. She was no more to him, after all, than an appealing young creature to whom it was mildly agreeable to have offered an evening's diversion; and when, as they rolled into the illuminated court of the hotel, she turned with a quick movement which brought her happy face close to his, he leaned away, affecting to be absorbed in opening the door of the cab. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At the desk the night porter, after a vain search through the pigeon-holes, was disposed to think that a letter or telegram had in fact been sent up for the gentleman; and Darrow, at the announcement, could hardly wait to ascend to his room. Upstairs, he and his companion had the long dimly-lit corridor to themselves, and Sophy paused on her threshold, gathering up in one hand the pale folds of her cloak, while she held the other out to Darrow. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"If the telegram comes early I shall be off by the first train; so I suppose this is good-bye,\" she said, her eyes dimmed by a little shadow of regret. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow, with a renewed start of contrition, perceived that he had again forgotten her letter; and as their hands met he vowed to himself that the moment she had left him he would dash down stairs to post it. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, I'll see you in the morning, of course!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A tremor of pleasure crossed her face as he stood before her, smiling a little uncertainly. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"At any rate,\" she said, \"I want to thank you now for my good day.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He felt in her hand the same tremor he had seen in her face. \"But it's you, on the contrary--\" he began, lifting the hand to his lips. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As he dropped it, and their eyes met, something passed through hers that was like a light carried rapidly behind a curtained window. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Good night; you must be awfully tired,\" he said with a friendly abruptness, turning away without even waiting to see her pass into her room. He unlocked his door, and stumbling over the threshold groped in the darkness for the electric button. The light showed him a telegram on the table, and he forgot everything else as he caught it up. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"No letter from France,\" the message read. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It fell from Darrow's hand to the floor, and he dropped into a chair by the table and sat gazing at the dingy drab and olive pattern of the carpet. She had not written, then; she had not written, and it was manifest now that she did not mean to write. If she had had any intention of explaining her telegram she would certainly, within twenty-four hours, have followed it up by a letter. But she evidently did not intend to explain it, and her silence could mean only that she had no explanation to give, or else that she was too indifferent to be aware that one was needed. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow, face to face with these alternatives, felt a recrudescence of boyish misery. It was no longer his hurt vanity that cried out. He told himself that he could have borne an equal amount of pain, if only it had left Mrs. Leath's image untouched; but he could not bear to think of her as trivial or insincere. The thought was so intolerable that he felt a blind desire to punish some one else for the pain it caused him. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As he sat moodily staring at the carpet its silly intricacies melted into a blur from which the eyes of Mrs. Leath again looked out at him. He saw the fine sweep of her brows, and the deep look beneath them as she had turned from him on their last evening in London. \"This will be good- bye, then,\" she had said; and it occurred to him that her parting phrase had been the same as Sophy Viner's. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At the thought he jumped to his feet and took down from its hook the coat in which he had left Miss Viner's letter. The clock marked the <<third quarter after midnight|10>>, and he knew it would make no difference if he went down to the post-box now or early the next morning; but he wanted to clear his conscience, and having found the letter he went to the door. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A sound in the next room made him pause. He had become conscious again that, a few feet off, on the other side of a thin partition, a small keen flame of life was quivering and agitating the air. Sophy's face came hack to him insistently. It was as vivid now as Mrs. Leath's had been a moment earlier. He recalled with a faint smile of retrospective pleasure the girl's enjoyment of her evening, and the innumerable fine feelers of sensation she had thrown out to its impressions. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It gave him a curiously close sense of her presence to think that at that moment she was living over her enjoyment as intensely as he was living over his unhappiness. His own case was irremediable, but it was easy enough to give her a few more hours of pleasure. And did she not perhaps secretly expect it of him? After all, if she had been very anxious to join her friends she would have telegraphed them on reaching Paris, instead of writing. He wondered now that he had not been struck at the moment by so artless a device to gain more time. The fact of her having practised it did not make him think less well of her; it merely strengthened the impulse to use his opportunity. She was starving, poor child, for a little amusement, a little personal life--why not give her the chance of another day in Paris? If he did so, should he not be merely falling in with her own hopes? 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At the thought his sympathy for her revived. She became of absorbing interest to him as an escape from himself and an object about which his thwarted activities could cluster. He felt less drearily alone because of her being there, on the other side of the door, and in his gratitude to her for giving him this relief he began, with indolent amusement, to plan new ways of detaining her. He dropped back into his chair, lit a cigar, and smiled a little at the image of her smiling face. He tried to imagine what incident of the day she was likely to be recalling at that particular moment, and what part he probably played in it. That it was not a small part he was certain, and the knowledge was undeniably pleasant. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Now and then a sound from her room brought before him more vividly the reality of the situation and the strangeness of the vast swarming solitude in which he and she were momentarily isolated, amid long lines of rooms each holding its separate secret. The nearness of all these other mysteries enclosing theirs gave Darrow a more intimate sense of the girl's presence, and through the fumes of his cigar his imagination continued to follow her to and fro, traced the curve of her slim young arms as she raised them to undo her hair, pictured the sliding down of her dress to the waist and then to the knees, and the whiteness of her feet as she slipped across the floor to bed... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He stood up and shook himself with a yawn, throwing away the end of his cigar. His glance, in following it, lit on the telegram which had dropped to the floor. The sounds in the next room had ceased, and once more he felt alone and unhappy. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Opening the window, he folded his arms on the sill and looked out on the vast light-spangled mass of the city, and then up at the dark sky, in which the morning planet stood.",

            "At the Theatre Francais, the next afternoon, Darrow yawned and fidgeted in his seat. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The day was warm, the theatre crowded and airless, and the performance, it seemed to him, intolerably bad. He stole a glance at his companion, wondering if she shared his feelings. Her rapt profile betrayed no unrest, but politeness might have caused her to feign an interest that she did not feel. He leaned back impatiently, stifling another yawn, and trying to fix his attention on the stage. Great things were going forward there, and he was not insensible to the stern beauties of the ancient drama. But the interpretation of the play seemed to him as airless and lifeless as the atmosphere of the theatre. The players were the same whom he had often applauded in those very parts, and perhaps that fact added to the impression of staleness and conventionality produced by their performance. Surely it was time to infuse new blood into the veins of the moribund art. He had the impression that the ghosts of actors were giving a spectral performance on the shores of Styx. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Certainly it was not the most profitable way for a young man with a pretty companion to pass the golden hours of a spring afternoon. The freshness of the face at his side, reflecting the freshness of the season, suggested dapplings of sunlight through new leaves, the sound of a brook in the grass, the ripple of tree-shadows over breezy meadows... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When at length the fateful march of the cothurns was stayed by the single pause in the play, and Darrow had led Miss Viner out on the balcony overhanging the square before the theatre, he turned to see if she shared his feelings. But the rapturous look she gave him checked the depreciation on his lips. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, why did you bring me out here? One ought to creep away and sit in the dark till it begins again!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Is that the way they made you feel?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Didn't they you?...As if the gods were there all the while, just behind them, pulling the strings?\" Her hands were pressed against the railing, her face shining and darkening under the wing-beats of successive impressions. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow smiled in enjoyment of her pleasure. After all, he had felt all that, long ago; perhaps it was his own fault, rather than that of the actors, that the poetry of the play seemed to have evaporated...But no, he had been right in judging the performance to be dull and stale: it was simply his companion's inexperience, her lack of occasions to compare and estimate, that made her think it brilliant. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I was afraid you were bored and wanted to come away.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Bored?\" She made a little aggrieved grimace. \"You mean you thought me too ignorant and stupid to appreciate it?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"No; not that.\" The hand nearest him still lay on the railing of the balcony, and he covered it for a moment with his. As he did so he saw the colour rise and tremble in her cheek. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Tell me just what you think,\" he said, bending his head a little, and only half-aware of his words. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She did not turn her face to his, but began to talk rapidly, trying to convey something of what she felt. But she was evidently unused to analyzing her aesthetic emotions, and the tumultuous rush of the drama seemed to have left her in a state of panting wonder, as though it had been a storm or some other natural cataclysm. She had no literary or historic associations to which to attach her impressions: her education had evidently not comprised a course in Greek literature. But she felt what would probably have been unperceived by many a young lady who had taken a first in classics: the ineluctable fatality of the tale, the dread sway in it of the same mysterious \"luck\" which pulled the threads of her own small destiny. It was not literature to her, it was fact: as actual, as near by, as what was happening to her at the moment and what the next hour held in store. Seen in this light, the play regained for Darrow its supreme and poignant reality. He pierced to the heart of its significance through all the artificial accretions with which his theories of art and the conventions of the stage had clothed it, and saw it as he had never seen it: as life. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} After this there could be no question of flight, and he took her back to the theatre, content to receive his own sensations through the medium of hers. But with the continuation of the play, and the oppression of the heavy air, his attention again began to wander, straying back over the incidents of the morning. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He had been with Sophy Viner all day, and he was surprised to find how quickly the time had gone. She had hardly attempted, as the hours passed, to conceal her satisfaction on finding that no telegram came from the Farlows. \"They'll have written,\" she had simply said; and her mind had at once flown on to the golden prospect of an afternoon at the theatre. The intervening hours had been disposed of in a stroll through the lively streets, and a repast, luxuriously lingered over, under the chestnut-boughs of a restaurant in the Champs Elysees. Everything entertained and interested her, and Darrow remarked, with an amused detachment, that she was not insensible to the impression her charms produced. Yet there was no hard edge of vanity in her sense of her prettiness: she seemed simply to be aware of it as a note in the general harmony, and to enjoy sounding the note as a singer enjoys singing. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} After luncheon, as they sat over their coffee, she had again asked an immense number of questions and delivered herself of a remarkable variety of opinions. Her questions testified to a wholesome and comprehensive human curiosity, and her comments showed, like her face and her whole attitude, an odd mingling of precocious wisdom and disarming ignorance. When she talked to him about \"life\"--the word was often on her lips--she seemed to him like a child playing with a tiger's cub; and he said to himself that some day the child would grow up--and so would the tiger. Meanwhile, such expertness qualified by such candour made it impossible to guess the extent of her personal experience, or to estimate its effect on her character. She might be any one of a dozen definable types, or she might--more disconcertingly to her companion and more perilously to herself--be a shifting and uncrystallized mixture of them all. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her talk, as usual, had promptly reverted to the stage. She was eager to learn about every form of dramatic expression which the metropolis of things theatrical had to offer, and her curiosity ranged from the official temples of the art to its less hallowed haunts. Her searching enquiries about a play whose production, on one of the latter scenes, had provoked a considerable amount of scandal, led Darrow to throw out laughingly: \"To see that you'll have to wait till you're married!\" and his answer had sent her off at a tangent. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, I never mean to marry,\" she had rejoined in a tone of youthful finality. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I seem to have heard that before!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes; from girls who've only got to choose!\" Her eyes had grown suddenly almost old. \"I'd like you to see the only men who've ever wanted to marry me! One was the doctor on the steamer, when I came abroad with the Hokes: he'd been cashiered from the navy for drunkenness. The other was a deaf widower with three grown-up daughters, who kept a clock-shop in Bayswater!--Besides,\" she rambled on, \"I'm not so sure that I believe in marriage. You see I'm all for self-development and the chance to live one's life. I'm awfully modern, you know.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It was just when she proclaimed herself most awfully modern that she struck him as most helplessly backward; yet the moment after, without any bravado, or apparent desire to assume an attitude, she would propound some social axiom which could have been gathered only in the bitter soil of experience. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} All these things came back to him as he sat beside her in the theatre and watched her ingenuous absorption. It was on \"the story\" that her mind was fixed, and in life also, he suspected, it would always be \"the story\", rather than its remoter imaginative issues, that would hold her. He did not believe there were ever any echoes in her soul... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} There was no question, however, that what she felt was felt with intensity: to the actual, the immediate, she spread vibrating strings. When the play was over, and they came out once more into the sunlight, Darrow looked down at her with a smile. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Well?\" he asked. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She made no answer. Her dark gaze seemed to rest on him without seeing him. Her cheeks and lips were pale, and the loose hair under her hat-brim clung to her forehead in damp rings. She looked like a young priestess still dazed by the fumes of the cavern. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You poor child--it's been almost too much for you!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She shook her head with a vague smile. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Come,\" he went on, putting his hand on her arm, \"let's jump into a taxi and get some air and sunshine. Look, there are hours of daylight left; and see what a night it's going to be!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He pointed over their heads, to where a white moon hung in the misty blue above the roofs of the rue de Rivoli. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She made no answer, and he signed to a motor-cab, calling out to the driver: \"To the Bois!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As the carriage turned toward the Tuileries she roused herself. \"I must go first to the hotel. There may be a message--at any rate I must decide on something.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow saw that the reality of the situation had suddenly forced itself upon her. \"I must decide on something,\" she repeated. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He would have liked to postpone the return, to persuade her to drive directly to the Bois for dinner. It would have been easy enough to remind her that she could not start for Joigny that evening, and that therefore it was of no moment whether she received the Farlows' answer then or a few hours later; but for some reason he hesitated to use this argument, which had come so naturally to him the day before. After all, he knew she would find nothing at the hotel--so what did it matter if they went there? 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The porter, interrogated, was not sure. He himself had received nothing for the lady, but in his absence his subordinate might have sent a letter upstairs. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow and Sophy mounted together in the lift, and the young man, while she went into her room, unlocked his own door and glanced at the empty table. For him at least no message had come; and on her threshold, a moment later, she met him with the expected: \"No--there's nothing!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He feigned an unregretful surprise. \"So much the better! And now, shall we drive out somewhere? Or would you rather take a boat to Bellevue? Have you ever dined there, on the terrace, by moonlight? It's not at all bad. And there's no earthly use in sitting here waiting.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She stood before him in perplexity. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But when I wrote yesterday I asked them to telegraph. I suppose they're horribly hard up, the poor dears, and they thought a letter would do as well as a telegram.\" The colour had risen to her face. \"That's why I wrote instead of telegraphing; I haven't a penny to spare myself!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Nothing she could have said could have filled her listener with a deeper contrition. He felt the red in his own face as he recalled the motive with which he had credited her in his <<midnight|13>> musings. But that motive, after all, had simply been trumped up to justify his own disloyalty: he had never really believed in it. The reflection deepened his confusion, and he would have liked to take her hand in his and confess the injustice he had done her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She may have interpreted his change of colour as an involuntary protest at being initiated into such shabby details, for she went on with a laugh: \"I suppose you can hardly understand what it means to have to stop and think whether one can afford a telegram? But I've always had to consider such things. And I mustn't stay here any longer now-I must try to get a night train for Joigny. Even if the Farlows can't take me in, I can go to the hotel: it will cost less than staying here.\" She paused again and then exclaimed: \"I ought to have thought of that sooner; I ought to have telegraphed yesterday! But I was sure I should hear from them today; and I wanted--oh, I did so awfully want to stay!\" She threw a troubled look at Darrow. \"Do you happen to remember,\" she asked, \"what time it was when you posted my letter?\"",

            "It was in the natural order of things that, on the way back to the house, their talk should have turned to the future. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna was not eager to define it. She had an extraordinary sensitiveness to the impalpable elements of happiness, and as she walked at Darrow's side her imagination flew back and forth, spinning luminous webs of feeling between herself and the scene about her. Every heightening of emotion produced for her a new effusion of beauty in visible things, and with it the sense that such moments should be lingered over and absorbed like some unrenewable miracle. She understood Darrow's impatience to see their plans take shape. She knew it must be so, she would not have had it otherwise; but to reach a point where she could fix her mind on his appeal for dates and decisions was like trying to break her way through the silver tangle of an April wood. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow wished to use his diplomatic opportunities as a means of studying certain economic and social problems with which he presently hoped to deal in print; and with this in view he had asked for, and obtained, a South American appointment. Anna was ready to follow where he led, and not reluctant to put new sights as well as new thoughts between herself and her past. She had, in a direct way, only Effie and Effie's education to consider; and there seemed, after due reflection, no reason why the most anxious regard for these should not be conciliated with the demands of Darrow's career. Effie, it was evident, could be left to Madame de Chantelle's care till the couple should have organized their life; and she might even, as long as her future step- father's work retained him in distant posts, continue to divide her year between Givre and the antipodes. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As for Owen, who had reached his legal majority two years before, and was soon to attain the age fixed for the taking over of his paternal inheritance, the arrival of this date would reduce his step-mother's responsibility to a friendly concern for his welfare. This made for the prompt realization of Darrow's wishes, and there seemed no reason why the marriage should not take place within the six weeks that remained of his leave. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} They passed out of the wood-walk into the open brightness of the garden. The <<noon|13>> sunlight sheeted with gold the bronze flanks of the polygonal yews. Chrysanthemums, russet, saffron and orange, glowed like the efflorescence of an enchanted forest; belts of red begonia purpling to wine- colour ran like smouldering flame among the borders; and above this outspread tapestry the house extended its harmonious length, the soberness of its lines softened to grace in the luminous misty air. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow stood still, and Anna felt that his glance was travelling from her to the scene about them and then back to her face. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You're sure you're prepared to give up Givre? You look so made for each other!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, Givre----\" She broke off suddenly, feeling as if her too careless tone had delivered all her past into his hands; and with one of her instinctive movements of recoil she added: \"When Owen marries I shall have to give it up.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"When Owen marries? That's looking some distance ahead! I want to be told that meanwhile you'll have no regrets.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She hesitated. Why did he press her to uncover to him her poor starved past? A vague feeling of loyalty, a desire to spare what could no longer harm her, made her answer evasively: \"There will probably be no 'meanwhile.' Owen may marry before long.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She had not meant to touch on the subject, for her step-son had sworn her to provisional secrecy; but since the shortness of Darrow's leave necessitated a prompt adjustment of their own plans, it was, after all, inevitable that she should give him at least a hint of Owen's. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Owen marry? Why, he always seems like a faun in flannels! I hope he's found a dryad. There might easily be one left in these blue-and-gold woods.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I can't tell you yet where he found his dryad, but she IS one, I believe: at any rate she'll become the Givre woods better than I do. Only there may be difficulties----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Well! At that age they're not always to be wished away.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She hesitated. \"Owen, at any rate, has made up his mind to overcome them; and I've promised to see him through.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She went on, after a moment's consideration, to explain that her step-son's choice was, for various reasons, not likely to commend itself to his grandmother. \"She must be prepared for it, and I've promised to do the preparing. You know I always have seen him through things, and he rather counts on me now.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She fancied that Darrow's exclamation had in it a faint note of annoyance, and wondered if he again suspected her of seeking a pretext for postponement. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But once Owen's future is settled, you won't, surely, for the sake of what you call seeing him through, ask that I should go away again without you?\" He drew her closer as they walked. \"Owen will understand, if you don't. Since he's in the same case himself I'll throw myself on his mercy. He'll see that I have the first claim on you; he won't even want you not to see it.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Owen sees everything: I'm not afraid of that. But his future isn't settled. He's very young to marry--too young, his grandmother is sure to think--and the marriage he wants to make is not likely to convince her to the contrary.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You don't mean that it's like his first choice?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, no! But it's not what Madame de Chantelle would call a good match; it's not even what I call a wise one.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yet you're backing him up?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yet I'm backing him up.\" She paused. \"I wonder if you'll understand? What I've most wanted for him, and shall want for Effie, is that they shall always feel free to make their own mistakes, and never, if possible, be persuaded to make other people's. Even if Owen's marriage is a mistake, and has to be paid for, I believe he'll learn and grow in the paying. Of course I can't make Madame de Chantelle see this; but I can remind her that, with his character--his big rushes of impulse, his odd intervals of ebb and apathy--she may drive him into some worse blunder if she thwarts him now.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And you mean to break the news to her as soon as she comes back from Ouchy?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"As soon as I see my way to it. She knows the girl and likes her: that's our hope. And yet it may, in the end, prove our danger, make it harder for us all, when she learns the truth, than if Owen had chosen a stranger. I can't tell you more till I've told her: I've promised Owen not to tell any one. All I ask you is to give me time, to give me a few days at any rate She's been wonderfully 'nice,' as she would call it, about you, and about the fact of my having soon to leave Givre; but that, again, may make it harder for Owen. At any rate, you can see, can't you, how it makes me want to stand by him? You see, I couldn't bear it if the least fraction of my happiness seemed to be stolen from his--as if it were a little scrap of happiness that had to be pieced out with other people's!\" She clasped her hands on Darrow's arm. \"I want our life to be like a house with all the windows lit: I'd like to string lanterns from the roof and chimneys!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She ended with an inward tremor. All through her exposition and her appeal she had told herself that the moment could hardly have been less well chosen. In Darrow's place she would have felt, as he doubtless did, that her carefully developed argument was only the disguise of an habitual indecision. It was the hour of all others when she would have liked to affirm herself by brushing aside every obstacle to his wishes; yet it was only by opposing them that she could show the strength of character she wanted him to feel in her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} But as she talked she began to see that Darrow's face gave back no reflection of her words, that he continued to wear the abstracted look of a man who is not listening to what is said to him. It caused her a slight pang to discover that his thoughts could wander at such a moment; then, with a flush of joy she perceived the reason. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In some undefinable way she had become aware, without turning her head, that he was steeped in the sense of her nearness, absorbed in contemplating the details of her face and dress; and the discovery made the words throng to her lips. She felt herself speak with ease, authority, conviction. She said to herself: \"He doesn't care what I say--it's enough that I say it--even if it's stupid he'll like me better for it...\" She knew that every inflexion of her voice, every gesture, every characteristic of her person--its very defects, the fact that her forehead was too high, that her eyes were not large enough, that her hands, though slender, were not small, and that the fingers did not taper--she knew that these deficiencies were so many channels through which her influence streamed to him; that she pleased him in spite of them, perhaps because of them; that he wanted her as she was, and not as she would have liked to be; and for the first time she felt in her veins the security and lightness of happy love. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} They reached the court and walked under the limes toward the house. The hall door stood wide, and through the windows opening on the terrace the sun slanted across the black and white floor, the faded tapestry chairs, and Darrow's travelling coat and cap, which lay among the cloaks and rugs piled on a bench against the wall. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The sight of these garments, lying among her own wraps, gave her a sense of homely intimacy. It was as if her happiness came down from the skies and took on the plain dress of daily things. At last she seemed to hold it in her hand. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As they entered the hall her eye lit on an unstamped note conspicuously placed on the table. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"From Owen! He must have rushed off somewhere in the motor.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She felt a secret stir of pleasure at the immediate inference that she and Darrow would probably lunch alone. Then she opened the note and stared at it in wonder. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Dear,\" Owen wrote, \"after what you said yesterday I can't wait another hour, and I'm off to Francheuil, to catch the Dijon express and travel back with them. Don't be frightened; I won't speak unless it's safe to. Trust me for that--but I had to go.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She looked up slowly. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"He's gone to Dijon to meet his grandmother. Oh, I hope I haven't made a mistake!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You? Why, what have you to do with his going to Dijon?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She hesitated. \"The day before yesterday I told him, for the first time, that I meant to see him through, no matter what happened. And I'm afraid he's lost his head, and will be imprudent and spoil things. You see, I hadn't meant to say a word to him till I'd had time to prepare Madame de Chantelle.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She felt that Darrow was looking at her and reading her thoughts, and the colour flew to her face. \"Yes: it was when I heard you were coming that I told him. I wanted him to feel as I felt...it seemed too unkind to make him wait!\" Her hand was in his, and his arm rested for a moment on her shoulder. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"It would have been too unkind to make him wait.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} They moved side by side toward the stairs. Through the haze of bliss enveloping her, Owen's affairs seemed curiously unimportant and remote. Nothing really mattered but this torrent of light in her veins. She put her foot on the lowest step, saying: \"It's nearly luncheon time-I must take off my hat...\" and as she started up the stairs Darrow stood below in the hall and watched her. But the distance between them did not make him seem less near: it was as if his thoughts moved with her and touched her like endearing hands. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In her bedroom she shut the door and stood still, looking about her in a fit of dreamy wonder. Her feelings were unlike any she had ever known: richer, deeper, more complete. For the first time everything in her, from head to foot, seemed to be feeding the same full current of sensation. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She took off her hat and went to the dressing-table to smooth her hair. The pressure of the hat had flattened the dark strands on her forehead; her face was paler than usual, with shadows about the eyes. She felt a pang of regret for the wasted years. \"If I look like this today,\" she said to herself, \"what will he think of me when I'm ill or worried?\" She began to run her fingers through her hair, rejoicing in its thickness; then she desisted and sat still, resting her chin on her hands. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I want him to see me as I am,\" she thought. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Deeper than the deepest fibre of her vanity was the triumphant sense that as she was, with her flattened hair, her tired pallor, her thin sleeves a little tumbled by the weight of her jacket, he would like her even better, feel her nearer, dearer, more desirable, than in all the splendours she might put on for him. In the light of this discovery she studied her face with a new intentness, seeing its defects as she had never seen them, yet seeing them through a kind of radiance, as though love were a luminous medium into which she had been bodily plunged. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She was glad now that she had confessed her doubts and her jealousy. She divined that a man in love may be flattered by such involuntary betrayals, that there are moments when respect for his liberty appeals to him less than the inability to respect it: moments so propitious that a woman's very mistakes and indiscretions may help to establish her dominion. The sense of power she had been aware of in talking to Darrow came back with ten-fold force. She felt like testing him by the most fantastic exactions, and at the same moment she longed to humble herself before him, to make herself the shadow and echo of his mood. She wanted to linger with him in a world of fancy and yet to walk at his side in the world of fact. She wanted him to feel her power and yet to love her for her ignorance and humility. She felt like a slave, and a goddess, and a girl in her teens...",

            "Darrow, late that evening, threw himself into an armchair before his fire and mused. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The room was propitious to meditation. The red-veiled lamp, the corners of shadow, the splashes of firelight on the curves of old full-bodied wardrobes and cabinets, gave it an air of intimacy increased by its faded hangings, its slightly frayed and threadbare rugs. Everything in it was harmoniously shabby, with a subtle sought-for shabbiness in which Darrow fancied he discerned the touch of Fraser Leath. But Fraser Leath had grown so unimportant a factor in the scheme of things that these marks of his presence caused the young man no emotion beyond that of a faint retrospective amusement. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The afternoon and evening had been perfect. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} After a moment of concern over her step-son's departure, Anna had surrendered herself to her happiness with an impetuosity that Darrow had never suspected in her. Early in the afternoon they had gone out in the motor, traversing miles of sober-tinted landscape in which, here and there, a scarlet vineyard flamed, clattering through the streets of stony villages, coming out on low slopes above the river, or winding through the pale gold of narrow wood-roads with the blue of clear-cut hills at their end. Over everything lay a faint sunshine that seemed dissolved in the still air, and the smell of wet roots and decaying leaves was merged in the pungent scent of burning underbrush. Once, at the turn of a wall, they stopped the motor before a ruined gateway and, stumbling along a road full of ruts, stood before a little old deserted house, fantastically carved and chimneyed, which lay in a moat under the shade of ancient trees. They paced the paths between the trees, found a mouldy Temple of Love on an islet among reeds and plantains, and, sitting on a bench in the stable-yard, watched the pigeons circling against the sunset over their cot of patterned brick. Then the motor flew on into the dusk... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When they came in they sat beside the fire in the oak drawing-room, and Darrow noticed how delicately her head stood out against the sombre panelling, and mused on the enjoyment there would always be in the mere fact of watching her hands as they moved about among the tea-things... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} They dined late, and facing her across the table, with its low lights and flowers, he felt an extraordinary pleasure in seeing her again in evening dress, and in letting his eyes dwell on the proud shy set of her head, the way her dark hair clasped it, and the girlish thinness of her neck above the slight swell of the breast. His imagination was struck by the quality of reticence in her beauty. She suggested a fine portrait kept down to a few tones, or a Greek vase on which the play of light is the only pattern. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} After dinner they went out on the terrace for a look at the moon-misted park. Through the crepuscular whiteness the trees hung in blotted masses. Below the terrace, the garden drew its dark diagrams between statues that stood like muffled conspirators on the edge of the shadow. Farther off, the meadows unrolled a silver-shot tissue to the mantling of mist above the river; and the autumn stars trembled overhead like their own reflections seen in dim water. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He lit his cigar, and they walked slowly up and down the flags in the languid air, till he put an arm about her, saying: \"You mustn't stay till you're chilled\"; then they went back into the room and drew up their chairs to the fire. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It seemed only a moment later that she said: \"It must be after eleven,\" and stood up and looked down on him, smiling faintly. He sat still, absorbing the look, and thinking: \"There'll be evenings and evenings\"--till she came nearer, bent over him, and with a hand on his shoulder said: \"Good night.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He got to his feet and put his arms about her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Good night,\" he answered, and held her fast; and they gave each other a long kiss of promise and communion. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The memory of it glowed in him still as he sat over his crumbling fire; but beneath his physical exultation he felt a certain gravity of mood. His happiness was in some sort the rallying-point of many scattered purposes. He summed it up vaguely by saying to himself that to be loved by a woman like that made \"all the difference\"...He was a little tired of experimenting on life; he wanted to \"take a line\", to follow things up, to centralize and concentrate, and produce results. Two or three more years of diplomacy--with her beside him!--and then their real life would begin: study, travel and book-making for him, and for her--well, the joy, at any rate, of getting out of an atmosphere of bric-a-brac and card-leaving into the open air of competing activities. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The desire for change had for some time been latent in him, and his meeting with Mrs. Leath the previous spring had given it a definite direction. With such a comrade to focus and stimulate his energies he felt modestly but agreeably sure of \"doing something\". And under this assurance was the lurking sense that he was somehow worthy of his opportunity. His life, on the whole, had been a creditable affair. Out of modest chances and middling talents he had built himself a fairly marked personality, known some exceptional people, done a number of interesting and a few rather difficult things, and found himself, at thirty-seven, possessed of an intellectual ambition sufficient to occupy the passage to a robust and energetic old age. As for the private and personal side of his life, it had come up to the current standards, and if it had dropped, now and then, below a more ideal measure, even these declines had been brief, parenthetic, incidental. In the recognized essentials he had always remained strictly within the limit of his scruples. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} From this reassuring survey of his case he came back to the contemplation of its crowning felicity. His mind turned again to his first meeting with Anna Summers and took up one by one the threads of their faintly sketched romance. He dwelt with pardonable pride on the fact that fate had so early marked him for the high privilege of possessing her: it seemed to mean that they had really, in the truest sense of the ill-used phrase, been made for each other. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Deeper still than all these satisfactions was the mere elemental sense of well-being in her presence. That, after all, was what proved her to be the woman for him: the pleasure he took in the set of her head, the way her hair grew on her forehead and at the nape, her steady gaze when he spoke, the grave freedom of her gait and gestures. He recalled every detail of her face, the fine veinings of the temples, the bluish-brown shadows in her upper lids, and the way the reflections of two stars seemed to form and break up in her eyes when he held her close to him... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} If he had had any doubt as to the nature of her feeling for him those dissolving stars would have allayed it. She was reserved, she was shy even, was what the shallow and effusive would call \"cold\". She was like a picture so hung that it can be seen only at a certain angle: an angle known to no one but its possessor. The thought flattered his sense of possessorship...He felt that the smile on his lips would have been fatuous had it had a witness. He was thinking of her look when she had questioned him about his meeting with Owen at the theatre: less of her words than of her look, and of the effort the question cost her: the reddening of her cheek, the deepening of the strained line between her brows, the way her eyes sought shelter and then turned and drew on him. Pride and passion were in the conflict--magnificent qualities in a wife! The sight almost made up for his momentary embarrassment at the rousing of a memory which had no place in his present picture of himself. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Yes! It was worth a good deal to watch that fight between her instinct and her intelligence, and know one's self the object of the struggle... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Mingled with these sensations were considerations of another order. He reflected with satisfaction that she was the kind of woman with whom one would like to be seen in public. It would be distinctly agreeable to follow her into drawing- rooms, to walk after her down the aisle of a theatre, to get in and out of trains with her, to say \"my wife\" of her to all sorts of people. He draped these details in the handsome phrase \"She's a woman to be proud of\", and felt that this fact somehow justified and ennobled his instinctive boyish satisfaction in loving her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He stood up, rambled across the room and leaned out for a while into the starry night. Then he dropped again into his armchair with a sigh of deep content. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, hang it,\" he suddenly exclaimed, \"it's the best thing that's ever happened to me, anyhow!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The next day was even better. He felt, and knew she felt, that they had reached a clearer understanding of each other. It was as if, after a swim through bright opposing waves, with a dazzle of sun in their eyes, they had gained an inlet in the shades of a cliff, where they could float on the still surface and gaze far down into the depths. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Now and then, as they walked and talked, he felt a thrill of youthful wonder at the coincidence of their views and their experiences, at the way their minds leapt to the same point in the same instant. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"The old delusion, I suppose,\" he smiled to himself. \"Will Nature never tire of the trick?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} But he knew it was more than that. There were moments in their talk when he felt, distinctly and unmistakably, the solid ground of friendship underneath the whirling dance of his sensations. \"How I should like her if I didn't love her!\" he summed it up, wondering at the miracle of such a union. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In the course of the morning a telegram had come from Owen Leath, announcing that he, his grandmother and Effie would arrive from Dijon that afternoon at <<four|9c:1>>. The station of the main line was eight or ten miles from Givre, and Anna, soon after three, left in the motor to meet the travellers. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When she had gone Darrow started for a walk, planning to get back late, in order that the reunited family might have the end of the afternoon to themselves. He roamed the country- side till long after dark, and the stable-clock of Givre was striking <<seven|11>> as he walked up the avenue to the court. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In the hall, coming down the stairs, he encountered Anna. Her face was serene, and his first glance showed him that Owen had kept his word and that none of her forebodings had been fulfilled. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She had just come down from the school-room, where Effie and the governess were having supper; the little girl, she told him, looked immensely better for her Swiss holiday, but was dropping with sleep after the journey, and too tired to make her habitual appearance in the drawing-room before being put to bed. Madame de Chantelle was resting, but would be down for dinner; and as for Owen, Anna supposed he was off somewhere in the park--he had a passion for prowling about the park at nightfall... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow followed her into the brown room, where the tea-table had been left for him. He declined her offer of tea, but she lingered a moment to tell him that Owen had in fact kept his word, and that Madame de Chantelle had come back in the best of humours, and unsuspicious of the blow about to fall. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She has enjoyed her month at Ouchy, and it has given her a lot to talk about--her symptoms, and the rival doctors, and the people at the hotel. It seems she met your Ambassadress there, and Lady Wantley, and some other London friends of yours, and she's heard what she calls 'delightful things' about you: she told me to tell you so. She attaches great importance to the fact that your grandmother was an Everard of Albany. She's prepared to open her arms to you. I don't know whether it won't make it harder for poor Owen...the contrast, I mean...There are no Ambassadresses or Everards to vouch for HIS choice! But you'll help me, won't you? You'll help me to help him? To-morrow I'll tell you the rest. Now I must rush up and tuck in Effie...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, you'll see, we'll pull it off for him!\" he assured her; \"together, we can't fail to pull it off.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He stood and watched her with a smile as she fled down the half-lit vista to the hall.",

            "Madame de Chantelle and Anna had planned, for the afternoon, a visit to a remotely situated acquaintance whom the introduction of the motor had transformed into a neighbour. Effie was to pay for her morning's holiday by an hour or two in the school-room, and Owen suggested that he and Darrow should betake themselves to a distant covert in the desultory quest for pheasants. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow was not an ardent sportsman, but any pretext for physical activity would have been acceptable at the moment; and he was glad both to get away from the house and not to be left to himself. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When he came downstairs the motor was at the door, and Anna stood before the hall mirror, swathing her hat in veils. She turned at the sound of his step and smiled at him for a long full moment. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I'd no idea you knew Miss Viner,\" she said, as he helped her into her long coat. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"It came back to me, luckily, that I'd seen her two or three times in London, several years ago. She was secretary, or something of the sort, in the background of a house where I used to dine.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He loathed the slighting indifference of the phrase, but he had uttered it deliberately, had been secretly practising it all through the interminable hour at the luncheon-table. Now that it was spoken, he shivered at its note of condescension. In such cases one was almost sure to overdo...But Anna seemed to notice nothing unusual. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Was she really? You must tell me all about it--tell me exactly how she struck you. I'm so glad it turns out that you know her.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"'Know' is rather exaggerated: we used to pass each other on the stairs.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Madame de Chantelle and Owen appeared together as he spoke, and Anna, gathering up her wraps, said: \"You'll tell me about that, then. Try and remember everything you can.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As he tramped through the woods at his young host's side, Darrow felt the partial relief from thought produced by exercise and the obligation to talk. Little as he cared for shooting, he had the habit of concentration which makes it natural for a man to throw himself wholly into whatever business he has in hand, and there were moments of the afternoon when a sudden whirr in the undergrowth, a vivider gleam against the hazy browns and greys of the woods, was enough to fill the foreground of his attention. But all the while, behind these voluntarily emphasized sensations, his secret consciousness continued to revolve on a loud wheel of thought. For a time it seemed to be sweeping him through deep gulfs of darkness. His sensations were too swift and swarming to be disentangled. He had an almost physical sense of struggling for air, of battling helplessly with material obstructions, as though the russet covert through which he trudged were the heart of a maleficent jungle... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Snatches of his companion's talk drifted to him intermittently through the confusion of his thoughts. He caught eager self-revealing phrases, and understood that Owen was saying things about himself, perhaps hinting indirectly at the hopes for which Darrow had been prepared by Anna's confidences. He had already become aware that the lad liked him, and had meant to take the first opportunity of showing that he reciprocated the feeling. But the effort of fixing his attention on Owen's words was so great that it left no power for more than the briefest and most inexpressive replies. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Young Leath, it appeared, felt that he had reached a turning-point in his career, a height from which he could impartially survey his past progress and projected endeavour. At one time he had had musical and literary yearnings, visions of desultory artistic indulgence; but these had of late been superseded by the resolute determination to plunge into practical life. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I don't want, you see,\" Darrow heard him explaining, \"to drift into what my grandmother, poor dear, is trying to make of me: an adjunct of Givre. I don't want--hang it all!--to slip into collecting sensations as my father collected snuff-boxes. I want Effie to have Givre--it's my grandmother's, you know, to do as she likes with; and I've understood lately that if it belonged to me it would gradually gobble me up. I want to get out of it, into a life that's big and ugly and struggling. If I can extract beauty out of that, so much the better: that'll prove my vocation. But I want to make beauty, not be drowned in the ready-made, like a bee in a pot of honey.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow knew that he was being appealed to for corroboration of these views and for encouragement in the course to which they pointed. To his own ears his answers sounded now curt, now irrelevant: at one moment he seemed chillingly indifferent, at another he heard himself launching out on a flood of hazy discursiveness. He dared not look at Owen, for fear of detecting the lad's surprise at these senseless transitions. And through the confusion of his inward struggles and outward loquacity he heard the ceaseless trip- hammer beat of the question: \"What in God's name shall I do?\"... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} To get back to the house before Anna's return seemed his most pressing necessity. He did not clearly know why: he simply felt that he ought to be there. At one moment it occurred to him that Miss Viner might want to speak to him alone--and again, in the same flash, that it would probably be the last thing she would want...At any rate, he felt he ought to try to speak to HER; or at least be prepared to do so, if the chance should occur... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Finally, <<toward four|9e>>, he told his companion that he had some letters on his mind and must get back to the house and despatch them before the ladies returned. He left Owen with the beater and walked on to the edge of the covert. At the park gates he struck obliquely through the trees, following a grass avenue at the end of which he had caught a glimpse of the roof of the chapel. A grey haze had blotted out the sun and the still air clung about him tepidly. At length the house-front raised before him its expanse of damp- silvered brick, and he was struck afresh by the high decorum of its calm lines and soberly massed surfaces. It made him feel, in the turbid coil of his fears and passions, like a muddy tramp forcing his way into some pure sequestered shrine... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} By and bye, he knew, he should have to think the complex horror out, slowly, systematically, bit by bit; but for the moment it was whirling him about so fast that he could just clutch at its sharp spikes and be tossed off again. Only one definite immediate fact stuck in his quivering grasp. He must give the girl every chance--must hold himself passive till she had taken them... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In the court Effie ran up to him with her leaping terrier. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I was coming out to meet you--you and Owen. Miss Viner was coming, too, and then she couldn't because she's got such a headache. I'm afraid I gave it to her because I did my division so disgracefully. It's too bad, isn't it? But won't you walk back with me? Nurse won't mind the least bit; she'd so much rather go in to tea.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow excused himself laughingly, on the plea that he had letters to write, which was much worse than having a headache, and not infrequently resulted in one. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, then you can go and write them in Owen's study. That's where gentlemen always write their letters.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She flew on with her dog and Darrow pursued his way to the house. Effie's suggestion struck him as useful. He had pictured himself as vaguely drifting about the drawing- rooms, and had perceived the difficulty of Miss Viner's having to seek him there; but the study, a small room on the right of the hall, was in easy sight from the staircase, and so situated that there would be nothing marked in his being found there in talk with her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He went in, leaving the door open, and sat down at the writing-table. The room was a friendly heterogeneous place, the one repository, in the well-ordered and amply-servanted house, of all its unclassified odds and ends: Effie's croquet-box and fishing rods, Owen's guns and golf-sticks and racquets, his step-mother's flower-baskets and gardening implements, even Madame de Chantelle's embroidery frame, and the back numbers of the Catholic Weekly. The early twilight had begun to fall, and presently a slanting ray across the desk showed Darrow that a servant was coming across the hall with a lamp. He pulled out a sheet of note-paper and began to write at random, while the man, entering, put the lamp at his elbow and vaguely \"straightened\" the heap of newspapers tossed on the divan. Then his steps died away and Darrow sat leaning his head on his locked hands. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Presently another step sounded on the stairs, wavered a moment and then moved past the threshold of the study. Darrow got up and walked into the hall, which was still unlighted. In the dimness he saw Sophy Viner standing by the hall door in her hat and jacket. She stopped at sight of him, her hand on the door-bolt, and they stood for a second without speaking. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Have you seen Effie?\" she suddenly asked. \"She went out to meet you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She did meet me, just now, in the court. She's gone on to join her brother.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow spoke as naturally as he could, but his voice sounded to his own ears like an amateur actor's in a \"light\" part. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Miss Viner, without answering, drew back the bolt. He watched her in silence as the door swung open; then he said: \"She has her nurse with her. She won't be long.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She stood irresolute, and he added: \"I was writing in there --won't you come and have a little talk? Every one's out.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The last words struck him as not well-chosen, but there was no time to choose. She paused a second longer and then crossed the threshold of the study. At luncheon she had sat with her back to the window, and beyond noting that she had grown a little thinner, and had less colour and vivacity, he had seen no change in her; but now, as the lamplight fell on her face, its whiteness startled him. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Poor thing...poor thing...what in heaven's name can she suppose?\" he wondered. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Do sit down-I want to talk to you,\" he said and pushed a chair toward her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She did not seem to see it, or, if she did, she deliberately chose another seat. He came back to his own chair and leaned his elbows on the blotter. She faced him from the farther side of the table. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You promised to let me hear from you now and then,\" he began awkwardly, and with a sharp sense of his awkwardness. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A faint smile made her face more tragic. \"Did I? There was nothing to tell. I've had no history--like the happy countries...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He waited a moment before asking: \"You are happy here?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I WAS,\" she said with a faint emphasis. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why do you say 'was'? You're surely not thinking of going? There can't be kinder people anywhere.\" Darrow hardly knew what he was saying; but her answer came to him with deadly definiteness. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I suppose it depends on you whether I go or stay.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"On me?\" He stared at her across Owen's scattered papers. \"Good God! What can you think of me, to say that?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The mockery of the question flashed back at him from her wretched face. She stood up, wandered away, and leaned an instant in the darkening window-frame. From there she turned to fling back at him: \"Don't imagine I'm the least bit sorry for anything!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He steadied his elbows on the table and hid his face in his hands. It was harder, oh, damnably harder, than he had expected! Arguments, expedients, palliations, evasions, all seemed to be slipping away from him: he was left face to face with the mere graceless fact of his inferiority. He lifted his head to ask at random: \"You've been here, then, ever since?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Since June; yes. It turned out that the Farlows were hunting for me--all the while--for this.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She stood facing him, her back to the window, evidently impatient to be gone, yet with something still to say, or that she expected to hear him say. The sense of her expectancy benumbed him. What in heaven's name could he say to her that was not an offense or a mockery? 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Your idea of the theatre--you gave that up at once, then?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, the theatre!\" She gave a little laugh. \"I couldn't wait for the theatre. I had to take the first thing that offered; I took this.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He pushed on haltingly: \"I'm glad--extremely glad--you're happy here...I'd counted on your letting me know if there was anything I could do...The theatre, now--if you still regret it--if you're not contented here...I know people in that line in London--I'm certain I can manage it for you when I get back----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She moved up to the table and leaned over it to ask, in a voice that was hardly above a whisper: \"Then you DO want me to leave? Is that it?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He dropped his arms with a groan. \"Good heavens! How can you think such things? At the time, you know, I begged you to let me do what I could, but you wouldn't hear of it...and ever since I've been wanting to be of use--to do something, anything, to help you...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She heard him through, motionless, without a quiver of the clasped hands she rested on the edge of the table. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"If you want to help me, then--you can help me to stay here,\" she brought out with low-toned intensity. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Through the stillness of the pause which followed, the bray of a motor-horn sounded far down the drive. Instantly she turned, with a last white look at him, and fled from the room and up the stairs. He stood motionless, benumbed by the shock of her last words. She was afraid, then--afraid of him--sick with fear of him! The discovery beat him down to a lower depth... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The motor-horn sounded again, close at hand, and he turned and went up to his room. His letter-writing was a sufficient pretext for not immediately joining the party about the tea-table, and he wanted to be alone and try to put a little order into his tumultuous thinking. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Upstairs, the room held out the intimate welcome of its lamp and fire. Everything in it exhaled the same sense of peace and stability which, two evenings before, had lulled him to complacent meditation. His armchair again invited him from the hearth, but he was too agitated to sit still, and with sunk head and hands clasped behind his back he began to wander up and down the room. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} His five minutes with Sophy Viner had flashed strange lights into the shadowy corners of his consciousness. The girl's absolute candour, her hard ardent honesty, was for the moment the vividest point in his thoughts. He wondered anew, as he had wondered before, at the way in which the harsh discipline of life had stripped her of false sentiment without laying the least touch on her pride. When they had parted, five months before, she had quietly but decidedly rejected all his offers of help, even to the suggestion of his trying to further her theatrical aims: she had made it clear that she wished their brief alliance to leave no trace on their lives save that of its own smiling memory. But now that they were unexpectedly confronted in a situation which seemed, to her terrified fancy, to put her at his mercy, her first impulse was to defend her right to the place she had won, and to learn as quickly as possible if he meant to dispute it. While he had pictured her as shrinking away from him in a tremor of self-effacement she had watched his movements, made sure of her opportunity, and come straight down to \"have it out\" with him. He was so struck by the frankness and energy of the proceeding that for a moment he lost sight of the view of his own character implied in it. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Poor thing...poor thing!\" he could only go on saying; and with the repetition of the words the picture of himself as she must see him pitiably took shape again. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He understood then, for the first time, how vague, in comparison with hers, had been his own vision of the part he had played in the brief episode of their relation. The incident had left in him a sense of exasperation and self- contempt, but that, as he now perceived, was chiefly, if not altogether, as it bore on his preconceived ideal of his attitude toward another woman. He had fallen below his own standard of sentimental loyalty, and if he thought of Sophy Viner it was mainly as the chance instrument of his lapse. These considerations were not agreeable to his pride, but they were forced on him by the example of her valiant common-sense. If he had cut a sorry figure in the business, he owed it to her not to close his eyes to the fact any longer... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} But when he opened them, what did he see? The situation, detestable at best, would yet have been relatively simple if protecting Sophy Viner had been the only duty involved in it. The fact that that duty was paramount did not do away with the contingent obligations. It was Darrow's instinct, in difficult moments, to go straight to the bottom of the difficulty; but he had never before had to take so dark a dive as this, and for the minute he shivered on the brink...Well, his first duty, at any rate, was to the girl: he must let her see that he meant to fulfill it to the last jot, and then try to find out how to square the fulfillment with the other problems already in his path...",

            "At dinner that evening Madame de Chantelle's slender monologue was thrown out over gulfs of silence. Owen was still in the same state of moody abstraction as when Darrow had left him at the piano; and even Anna's face, to her friend's vigilant eye, revealed not, perhaps, a personal preoccupation, but a vague sense of impending disturbance. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She smiled, she bore a part in the talk, her eyes dwelt on Darrow's with their usual deep reliance; but beneath the surface of her serenity his tense perceptions detected a hidden stir. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He was sufficiently self-possessed to tell himself that it was doubtless due to causes with which he was not directly concerned. He knew the question of Owen's marriage was soon to be raised, and the abrupt alteration in the young man's mood made it seem probable that he was himself the centre of the atmospheric disturbance, For a moment it occurred to Darrow that Anna might have employed her afternoon in preparing Madame de Chantelle for her grandson's impending announcement; but a glance at the elder lady's unclouded brow showed that he must seek elsewhere the clue to Owen's taciturnity and his step-mother's concern. Possibly Anna had found reason to change her own attitude in the matter, and had made the change known to Owen. But this, again, was negatived by the fact that, during the afternoon's shooting, young Leath had been in a mood of almost extravagant expansiveness, and that, from the moment of his late return to the house till just before dinner, there had been, to Darrow's certain knowledge, no possibility of a private talk between himself and his step-mother. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} This obscured, if it narrowed, the field of conjecture; and Darrow's gropings threw him back on the conclusion that he was probably reading too much significance into the moods of a lad he hardly knew, and who had been described to him as subject to sudden changes of humour. As to Anna's fancied perturbation, it might simply be due to the fact that she had decided to plead Owen's cause the next day, and had perhaps already had a glimpse of the difficulties awaiting her. But Darrow knew that he was too deep in his own perplexities to judge the mental state of those about him. It might be, after all, that the variations he felt in the currents of communication were caused by his own inward tremor. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Such, at any rate, was the conclusion he had reached when, shortly after the two ladies left the drawing-room, he bade Owen good-night and went up to his room. Ever since the rapid self-colloquy which had followed on his first sight of Sophy Viner, he had known there were other questions to be faced behind the one immediately confronting him. On the score of that one, at least, his mind, if not easy, was relieved. He had done what was possible to reassure the girl, and she had apparently recognized the sincerity of his intention. He had patched up as decent a conclusion as he could to an incident that should obviously have had no sequel; but he had known all along that with the securing of Miss Viner's peace of mind only a part of his obligation was discharged, and that with that part his remaining duty was in conflict. It had been his first business to convince the girl that their secret was safe with him; but it was far from easy to square this with the equally urgent obligation of safe-guarding Anna's responsibility toward her child. Darrow was not much afraid of accidental disclosures. Both he and Sophy Viner had too much at stake not to be on their guard. The fear that beset him was of another kind, and had a profounder source. He wanted to do all he could for the girl, but the fact of having had to urge Anna to confide Effie to her was peculiarly repugnant to him. His own ideas about Sophy Viner were too mixed and indeterminate for him not to feel the risk of such an experiment; yet he found himself in the intolerable position of appearing to press it on the woman he desired above all others to protect... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Till late in the night his thoughts revolved in a turmoil of indecision. His pride was humbled by the discrepancy between what Sophy Viner had been to him and what he had thought of her. This discrepancy, which at the time had seemed to simplify the incident, now turned out to be its most galling complication. The bare truth, indeed, was that he had hardly thought of her at all, either at the time or since, and that he was ashamed to base his judgement of her on his meagre memory of their adventure. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The essential cheapness of the whole affair--as far as his share in it was concerned--came home to him with humiliating distinctness. He would have liked to be able to feel that, at the time at least, he had staked something more on it, and had somehow, in the sequel, had a more palpable loss to show. But the plain fact was that he hadn't spent a penny on it; which was no doubt the reason of the prodigious score it had since been rolling up. At any rate, beat about the case as he would, it was clear that he owed it to Anna--and incidentally to his own peace of mind--to find some way of securing Sophy Viner's future without leaving her installed at Givre when he and his wife should depart for their new post. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The night brought no aid to the solving of this problem; but it gave him, at any rate, the clear conviction that no time was to be lost. His first step must be to obtain from Miss Viner the chance of another and calmer talk; and he resolved to seek it at the earliest hour. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He had gathered that Effie's lessons were preceded by an early scamper in the park, and conjecturing that her governess might be with her he betook himself the next morning to the terrace, whence he wandered on to the gardens and the walks beyond. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The atmosphere was still and pale. The muffled sunlight gleamed like gold tissue through grey gauze, and the beech alleys tapered away to a blue haze blent of sky and forest. It was one of those elusive days when the familiar forms of things seem about to dissolve in a prismatic shimmer. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The stillness was presently broken by joyful barks, and Darrow, tracking the sound, overtook Effie flying down one of the long alleys at the head of her pack. Beyond her he saw Miss Viner seated near the stone-rimmed basin beside which he and Anna had paused on their first walk to the river. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The girl, coming forward at his approach, returned his greeting almost gaily. His first glance showed him that she had regained her composure, and the change in her appearance gave him the measure of her fears. For the first time he saw in her again the sidelong grace that had charmed his eyes in Paris; but he saw it now as in a painted picture. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Shall we sit down a minute?\" he asked, as Effie trotted off. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The girl looked away from him. \"I'm afraid there's not much time; we must be back at lessons at <<half-past nine|10>>.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But it's barely ten minutes past. Let's at least walk a little way toward the river.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She glanced down the long walk ahead of them and then back in the direction of the house. \"If you like,\" she said in a low voice, with one of her quick fluctuations of colour; but instead of taking the way he proposed she turned toward a narrow path which branched off obliquely through the trees. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow was struck, and vaguely troubled, by the change in her look and tone. There was in them an undefinable appeal, whether for help or forbearance he could not tell. Then it occurred to him that there might have been something misleading in his so pointedly seeking her, and he felt a momentary constraint. To ease it he made an abrupt dash at the truth. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I came out to look for you because our talk of yesterday was so unsatisfactory. I want to hear more about you--about your plans and prospects. I've been wondering ever since why you've so completely given up the theatre.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her face instantly sharpened to distrust. \"I had to live,\" she said in an off-hand tone. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I understand perfectly that you should like it here--for a time.\" His glance strayed down the gold-roofed windings ahead of them. \"It's delightful: you couldn't be better placed. Only I wonder a little at your having so completely given up any idea of a different future.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She waited for a moment before answering: \"I suppose I'm less restless than I used to be.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"It's certainly natural that you should be less restless here than at Mrs. Murrett's; yet somehow I don't seem to see you permanently given up to forming the young.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"What--exactly--DO you seem to see me permanently given up to? You know you warned me rather emphatically against the theatre.\" She threw off the statement without impatience, as though they were discussing together the fate of a third person in whom both were benevolently interested. Darrow considered his reply. \"If I did, it was because you so emphatically refused to let me help you to a start.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She stopped short and faced him \"And you think I may let you now?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow felt the blood in his cheek. He could not understand her attitude--if indeed she had consciously taken one, and her changes of tone did not merely reflect the involuntary alternations of her mood. It humbled him to perceive once more how little he had to guide him in his judgment of her. He said to himself: \"If I'd ever cared a straw for her I should know how to avoid hurting her now\"--and his insensibility struck him as no better than a vulgar obtuseness. But he had a fixed purpose ahead and could only push on to it. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I hope, at any rate, you'll listen to my reasons. There's been time, on both sides, to think them over since----\" He caught himself back and hung helpless on the \"since\": whatever words he chose, he seemed to stumble among reminders of their past. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She walked on beside him, her eyes on the ground. \"Then I'm to understand--definitely--that you DO renew your offer?\" she asked 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"With all my heart! If you'll only let me----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She raised a hand, as though to check him. \"It's extremely friendly of you-I DO believe you mean it as a friend-- but I don't quite understand why, finding me, as you say, so well placed here, you should show more anxiety about my future than at a time when I was actually, and rather desperately, adrift.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, no, not more!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"If you show any at all, it must, at any rate, be for different reasons.--In fact, it can only be,\" she went on, with one of her disconcerting flashes of astuteness, \"for one of two reasons; either because you feel you ought to help me, or because, for some reason, you think you owe it to Mrs. Leath to let her know what you know of me.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow stood still in the path. Behind him he heard Effie's call, and at the child's voice he saw Sophy turn her head with the alertness of one who is obscurely on the watch. The look was so fugitive that he could not have said wherein it differed from her normal professional air of having her pupil on her mind. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Effie sprang past them, and Darrow took up the girl's challenge. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"What you suggest about Mrs. Leath is hardly worth answering. As to my reasons for wanting to help you, a good deal depends on the words one uses to define rather indefinite things. It's true enough that I want to help you; but the wish isn't due to...to any past kindness on your part, but simply to my own interest in you. Why not put it that our friendship gives me the right to intervene for what I believe to be your benefit?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She took a few hesitating steps and then paused again. Darrow noticed that she had grown pale and that there were rings of shade about her eyes. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You've known Mrs. Leath a long time?\" she asked him suddenly. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He paused with a sense of approaching peril. \"A long time-- yes.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She told me you were friends--great friends\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes,\" he admitted, \"we're great friends.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Then you might naturally feel yourself justified in telling her that you don't think I'm the right person for Effie.\" He uttered a sound of protest, but she disregarded it. \"I don't say you'd like to do it. You wouldn't: you'd hate it. And the natural alternative would be to try to persuade me that I'd be better off somewhere else than here. But supposing that failed, and you saw I was determined to stay? then you might think it your duty to tell Mrs. Leath.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She laid the case before him with a cold lucidity. \"I should, in your place, I believe,\" she ended with a little laugh. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I shouldn't feel justified in telling her, behind your back, if I thought you unsuited for the place; but I should certainly feel justified,\" he rejoined after a pause, \"in telling you if I thought the place unsuited to you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And that's what you're trying to tell me now?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes; but not for the reasons you imagine.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"What, then, are your reasons, if you please?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I've already implied them in advising you not to give up all idea of the theatre. You're too various, too gifted, too personal, to tie yourself down, at your age, to the dismal drudgery of teaching.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And is that what you've told Mrs. Leath?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She rushed the question out at him as if she expected to trip him up over it. He was moved by the simplicity of the stratagem. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I've told her exactly nothing,\" he replied. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And what--exactly--do you mean by 'nothing'? You and she were talking about me when I came into her sitting-room yesterday.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow felt his blood rise at the thrust. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I've told her, simply, that I'd seen you once or twice at Mrs. Murrett's.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And not that you've ever seen me since?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And not that I've ever seen you since...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And she believes you--she completely believes you?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He uttered a protesting exclamation, and his flush reflected itself in the girl's cheek. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, I beg your pardon! I didn't mean to ask you that.\" She halted, and again cast a rapid glance behind and ahead of her. Then she held out her hand. \"Well, then, thank you-- and let me relieve your fears. I sha'n't be Effie's governess much longer.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At the announcement, Darrow tried to merge his look of relief into the expression of friendly interest with which he grasped her hand. \"You really do agree with me, then? And you'll give me a chance to talk things over with you?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She shook her head with a faint smile. \"I'm not thinking of the stage. I've had another offer: that's all.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The relief was hardly less great. After all, his personal responsibility ceased with her departure from Givre. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You'll tell me about that, then--won't you?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her smile flickered up. \"Oh, you'll hear about it soon...I must catch Effie now and drag her back to the blackboard.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She walked on for a few yards, and then paused again and confronted him. \"I've been odious to you--and not quite honest,\" she broke out suddenly. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Not quite honest?\" he repeated, caught in a fresh wave of wonder. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I mean, in seeming not to trust you. It's come over me again as we talked that, at heart, I've always known I could...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her colour rose in a bright wave, and her eyes clung to his for a swift instant of reminder and appeal. For the same space of time the past surged up in him confusedly; then a veil dropped between them. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Here's Effie now!\" she exclaimed. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He turned and saw the little girl trotting back to them, her hand in Owen Leath's. Even through the stir of his subsiding excitement Darrow was at once aware of the change effected by the young man's approach. For a moment Sophy Viner's cheeks burned redder; then they faded to the paleness of white petals. She lost, however, nothing of the bright bravery which it was her way to turn on the unexpected. Perhaps no one less familiar with her face than Darrow would have discerned the tension of the smile she transferred from himself to Owen Leath, or have remarked that her eyes had hardened from misty grey to a shining darkness. But her observer was less struck by this than by the corresponding change in Owen Leath. The latter, when he came in sight, had been laughing and talking unconcernedly with Effie; but as his eye fell on Miss Viner his expression altered as suddenly as hers. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The change, for Darrow, was less definable; but, perhaps for that reason, it struck him as more sharply significant. Only--just what did it signify? Owen, like Sophy Viner, had the kind of face which seems less the stage on which emotions move than the very stuff they work in. In moments of excitement his odd irregular features seemed to grow fluid, to unmake and remake themselves like the shadows of clouds on a stream. Darrow, through the rapid flight of the shadows, could not seize on any specific indication of feeling: he merely perceived that the young man was unaccountably surprised at finding him with Miss Viner, and that the extent of his surprise might cover all manner of implications. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow's first idea was that Owen, if he suspected that the conversation was not the result of an accidental encounter, might wonder at his step-mother's suitor being engaged, at such an hour, in private talk with her little girl's governess. The thought was so disturbing that, as the three turned back to the house, he was on the point of saying to Owen: \"I came out to look for your mother.\" But, in the contingency he feared, even so simple a phrase might seem like an awkward attempt at explanation; and he walked on in silence at Miss Viner's side. Presently he was struck by the fact that Owen Leath and the girl were silent also; and this gave a new turn to his thoughts. Silence may be as variously shaded as speech; and that which enfolded Darrow and his two companions seemed to his watchful perceptions to be quivering with cross-threads of communication. At first he was aware only of those that centred in his own troubled consciousness; then it occurred to him that an equal activity of intercourse was going on outside of it. Something was in fact passing mutely and rapidly between young Leath and Sophy Viner; but what it was, and whither it tended, Darrow, when they reached the house, was but just beginning to divine...",

            "Anna Leath, from the terrace, watched the return of the little group. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She looked down on them, as they advanced across the garden, from the serene height of her unassailable happiness. There they were, coming toward her in the mild morning light, her child, her step-son, her promised husband: the three beings who filled her life. She smiled a little at the happy picture they presented, Effie's gambols encircling it in a moving frame within which the two men came slowly forward in the silence of friendly understanding. It seemed part of the deep intimacy of the scene that they should not be talking to each other, and it did not till afterward strike her as odd that neither of them apparently felt it necessary to address a word to Sophy Viner. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna herself, at the moment, was floating in the mid-current of felicity, on a tide so bright and buoyant that she seemed to be one with its warm waves. The first rush of bliss had stunned and dazzled her; but now that, each morning, she woke to the calm certainty of its recurrence, she was growing used to the sense of security it gave. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I feel as if I could trust my happiness to carry me; as if it had grown out of me like wings.\" So she phrased it to Darrow, as, later in the morning, they paced the garden- paths together. His answering look gave her the same assurance of safety. The evening before he had seemed preoccupied, and the shadow of his mood had faintly encroached on the great golden orb of their blessedness; but now it was uneclipsed again, and hung above them high and bright as the sun at <<noon|13>>. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Upstairs in her sitting-room, that afternoon, she was thinking of these things. The morning mists had turned to rain, compelling the postponement of an excursion in which the whole party were to have joined. Effie, with her governess, had been despatched in the motor to do some shopping at Francheuil; and Anna had promised Darrow to join him, later in the afternoon, for a quick walk in the rain. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He had gone to his room after luncheon to get some belated letters off his conscience; and when he had left her she had continued to sit in the same place, her hands crossed on her knees, her head slightly bent, in an attitude of brooding retrospection. As she looked back at her past life, it seemed to her to have consisted of one ceaseless effort to pack into each hour enough to fill out its slack folds; but now each moment was like a miser's bag stretched to bursting with pure gold. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She was roused by the sound of Owen's step in the gallery outside her room. It paused at her door and in answer to his knock she called out \"Come in!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As the door closed behind him she was struck by his look of pale excitement, and an impulse of compunction made her say: \"You've come to ask me why I haven't spoken to your grandmother!\" He sent about him a glance vaguely reminding her of the strange look with which Sophy Viner had swept the room the night before; then his brilliant eyes came back to her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I've spoken to her myself,\" he said. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna started up, incredulous. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You've spoken to her? When?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Just now. I left her to come here.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna's first feeling was one of annoyance. There was really something comically incongruous in this boyish surrender to impulse on the part of a young man so eager to assume the responsibilities of life. She looked at him with a faintly veiled amusement. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You asked me to help you and I promised you I would. It was hardly worth while to work out such an elaborate plan of action if you intended to take the matter out of my hands without telling me.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, don't take that tone with me!\" he broke out, almost angrily. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"That tone? What tone?\" She stared at his quivering face. \"I might,\" she pursued, still half-laughing, \"more properly make that request of YOU!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen reddened and his vehemence suddenly subsided. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I meant that I had to speak--that's all. You don't give me a chance to explain...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She looked at him gently, wondering a little at her own impatience. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Owen! Don't I always want to give you every chance? It's because I do that I wanted to talk to your grandmother first--that I was waiting and watching for the right moment...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"The right moment? So was I. That's why I've spoken.\" His voice rose again and took the sharp edge it had in moments of high pressure. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} His step-mother turned away and seated herself in her sofa- corner. \"Oh, my dear, it's not a privilege to quarrel over! You've taken a load off my shoulders. Sit down and tell me all about it.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He stood before her, irresolute. \"I can't sit down,\" he said. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Walk about, then. Only tell me: I'm impatient.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} His immediate response was to throw himself into the armchair at her side, where he lounged for a moment without speaking, his legs stretched out, his arms locked behind his thrown-back head. Anna, her eyes on his face, waited quietly for him to speak. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Well--of course it was just what one expected.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She takes it so badly, you mean?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"All the heavy batteries were brought up: my father, Givre, Monsieur de Chantelle, the throne and the altar. Even my poor mother was dragged out of oblivion and armed with imaginary protests.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna sighed out her sympathy. \"Well--you were prepared for all that?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I thought I was, till I began to hear her say it. Then it sounded so incredibly silly that I told her so.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, Owen--Owen!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes: I know. I was a fool; but I couldn't help it.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And you've mortally offended her, I suppose? That's exactly what I wanted to prevent.\" She laid a hand on his shoulder. \"You tiresome boy, not to wait and let me speak for you!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He moved slightly away, so that her hand slipped from its place. \"You don't understand,\" he said, frowning. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I don't see how I can, till you explain. If you thought the time had come to tell your grandmother, why not have asked me to do it? I had my reasons for waiting; but if you'd told me to speak I should have done so, naturally.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He evaded her appeal by a sudden turn. \"What were your reasons for waiting?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna did not immediately answer. Her step-son's eyes were on her face, and under his gaze she felt a faint disquietude. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I was feeling my way...I wanted to be absolutely sure...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Absolutely sure of what?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She delayed again for a just perceptible instant. \"Why, simply of OUR side of the case.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But you told me you were, the other day, when we talked it over before they came back from Ouchy.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, my dear--if you think that, in such a complicated matter, every day, every hour, doesn't more or less modify one's surest sureness!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"That's just what I'm driving at. I want to know what has modified yours.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She made a slight gesture of impatience. \"What does it matter, now the thing's done? I don't know that I could give any clear reason...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He got to his feet and stood looking down on her with a tormented brow. \"But it's absolutely necessary that you should.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At his tone her impatience flared up. \"It's not necessary that I should give you any explanation whatever, since you've taken the matter out of my hands. All I can say is that I was trying to help you: that no other thought ever entered my mind.\" She paused a moment and then added: \"If you doubted it, you were right to do what you've done.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, I never doubted you!\" he retorted, with a fugitive stress on the pronoun. His face had cleared to its old look of trust. \"Don't be offended if I've seemed to,\" he went on. \"I can't quite explain myself, either...it's all a kind of tangle, isn't it? That's why I thought I'd better speak at once; or rather why I didn't think at all, but just suddenly blurted the thing out----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna gave him back his look of conciliation. \"Well, the how and why don't much matter now. The point is how to deal with your grandmother. You've not told me what she means to do.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, she means to send for Adelaide Painter.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The name drew a faint note of mirth from him and relaxed both their faces to a smile. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Perhaps,\" Anna added, \"it's really the best thing for us all.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen shrugged his shoulders. \"It's too preposterous and humiliating. Dragging that woman into our secrets----!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"This could hardly be a secret much longer.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He had moved to the hearth, where he stood pushing about the small ornaments on the mantel-shelf; but at her answer he turned back to her. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You haven't, of course, spoken of it to any one?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"No; but I intend to now.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She paused for his reply, and as it did not come she continued: \"If Adelaide Painter's to be told there's no possible reason why I shouldn't tell Mr. Darrow.\" Owen abruptly set down the little statuette between his fingers. \"None whatever: I want every one to know.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She smiled a little at his over-emphasis, and was about to meet it with a word of banter when he continued, facing her: \"You haven't, as yet, said a word to him?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I've told him nothing, except what the discussion of our own plans--his and mine--obliged me to: that you were thinking of marrying, and that I wasn't willing to leave France till I'd done what I could to see you through.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At her first words the colour had rushed to his forehead; but as she continued she saw his face compose itself and his blood subside. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You're a brick, my dear!\" he exclaimed. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You had my word, you know.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes; yes-I know.\" His face had clouded again. \"And that's all--positively all--you've ever said to him?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Positively all. But why do you ask?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He had a moment's embarrassed hesitation. \"It was understood, wasn't it, that my grandmother was to be the first to know?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Well--and so she has been, hasn't she, since you've told her?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He turned back to his restless shifting of the knick-knacks. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And you're sure that nothing you've said to Darrow could possibly have given him a hint----?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Nothing I've said to him--certainly.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He swung about on her. \"Why do you put it in that way?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"In what way?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why--as if you thought some one else might have spoken...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Some one else? Who else?\" She rose to her feet. \"What on earth, my dear boy, can you be driving at?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I'm trying to find out whether you think he knows anything definite.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why should I think so? Do you?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I don't know. I want to find out.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She laughed at his obstinate insistence. \"To test my veracity, I suppose?\" At the sound of a step in the gallery she added: \"Here he is--you can ask him yourself.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She met Darrow's knock with an invitation to enter, and he came into the room and paused between herself and Owen. She was struck, as he stood there, by the contrast between his happy careless good-looks and her step-son's frowning agitation. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow met her eyes with a smile. \"Am I too soon? Or is our walk given up?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"No; I was just going to get ready.\" She continued to linger between the two, looking slowly from one to the other. \"But there's something we want to tell you first: Owen is engaged to Miss Viner.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The sense of an indefinable interrogation in Owen's mind made her, as she spoke, fix her eyes steadily on Darrow. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He had paused just opposite the window, so that, even in the rainy afternoon light, his face was clearly open to her scrutiny. For a second, immense surprise was alone visible on it: so visible that she half turned to her step-son, with a faint smile for his refuted suspicions. Why, she wondered, should Owen have thought that Darrow had already guessed his secret, and what, after all, could be so disturbing to him in this not improbable contingency? At any rate, his doubt must have been dispelled: there was nothing feigned about Darrow's astonishment. When her eyes turned back to him he was already crossing to Owen with outstretched hand, and she had, through an unaccountable faint flutter of misgiving, a mere confused sense of their exchanging the customary phrases. Her next perception was of Owen's tranquillized look, and of his smiling return of Darrow's congratulatory grasp. She had the eerie feeling of having been overswept by a shadow which there had been no cloud to cast... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A moment later Owen had left the room and she and Darrow were alone. He had turned away to the window and stood staring out into the down-pour. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You're surprised at Owen's news?\" she asked. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes: I am surprised,\" he answered. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You hadn't thought of its being Miss Viner?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why should I have thought of Miss Viner?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You see now why I wanted so much to find out what you knew about her.\" He made no comment, and she pursued: \"Now that you DO know it's she, if there's anything----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He moved back into the room and went up to her. His face was serious, with a slight shade of annoyance. \"What on earth should there be? As I told you, I've never in my life heard any one say two words about Miss Viner.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna made no answer and they continued to face each other without moving. For the moment she had ceased to think about Sophy Viner and Owen: the only thought in her mind was that Darrow was alone with her, close to her, and that, for the first time, their hands and lips had not met. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He glanced back doubtfully at the window. \"It's pouring. Perhaps you'd rather not go out?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She hesitated, as if waiting for him to urge her. \"I suppose I'd better not. I ought to go at once to my mother- in-law--Owen's just been telling her,\" she said. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Ah.\" Darrow hazarded a smile. \"That accounts for my having, on my way up, heard some one telephoning for Miss Painter!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At the allusion they laughed together, vaguely, and Anna moved toward the door. He held it open for her and followed her out.",

            "It was not until late that afternoon that Darrow could claim his postponed hour with Anna. When at last he found her alone in her sitting-room it was with a sense of liberation so great that he sought no logical justification of it. He simply felt that all their destinies were in Miss Painter's grasp, and that, resistance being useless, he could only enjoy the sweets of surrender. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna herself seemed as happy, and for more explicable reasons. She had assisted, after luncheon, at another debate between Madame de Chantelle and her confidant, and had surmised, when she withdrew from it, that victory was permanently perched on Miss Painter's banners. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I don't know how she does it, unless it's by the dead weight of her convictions. She detests the French so that she'd back up Owen even if she knew nothing--or knew too much--of Miss Viner. She somehow regards the match as a protest against the corruption of European morals. I told Owen that was his great chance, and he's made the most of it.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"What a tactician you are! You make me feel that I hardly know the rudiments of diplomacy,\" Darrow smiled at her, abandoning himself to a perilous sense of well-being. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She gave him back his smile. \"I'm afraid I think nothing short of my own happiness is worth wasting any diplomacy on!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"That's why I mean to resign from the service of my country,\" he rejoined with a laugh of deep content. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The feeling that both resistance and apprehension were vain was working like wine in his veins. He had done what he could to deflect the course of events: now he could only stand aside and take his chance of safety. Underneath this fatalistic feeling was the deep sense of relief that he had, after all, said and done nothing that could in the least degree affect the welfare of Sophy Viner. That fact took a millstone off his neck. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Meanwhile he gave himself up once more to the joy of Anna's presence. They had not been alone together for two long days, and he had the lover's sense that he had forgotten, or at least underestimated, the strength of the spell she cast. Once more her eyes and her smile seemed to bound his world. He felt that their light would always move with him as the sunset moves before a ship at sea. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The next day his sense of security was increased by a decisive incident. It became known to the expectant household that Madame de Chantelle had yielded to the tremendous impact of Miss Painter's determination and that Sophy Viner had been \"sent for\" to the purple satin sitting- room. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} At luncheon, Owen's radiant countenance proclaimed the happy sequel, and Darrow, when the party had moved back to the oak-room for coffee, deemed it discreet to wander out alone to the terrace with his cigar. The conclusion of Owen's romance brought his own plans once more to the front. Anna had promised that she would consider dates and settle details as soon as Madame de Chantelle and her grandson had been reconciled, and Darrow was eager to go into the question at once, since it was necessary that the preparations for his marriage should go forward as rapidly as possible. Anna, he knew, would not seek any farther pretext for delay; and he strolled up and down contentedly in the sunshine, certain that she would come out and reassure him as soon as the reunited family had claimed its due share of her attention. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} But when she finally joined him her first word was for the younger lovers. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I want to thank you for what you've done for Owen,\" she began, with her happiest smile. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Who--I?\" he laughed. \"Are you confusing me with Miss Painter?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Perhaps I ought to say for me,\" she corrected herself. \"You've been even more of a help to us than Adelaide.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"My dear child! What on earth have I done?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You've managed to hide from Madame de Chantelle that you don't really like poor Sophy.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow felt the pallour in his cheek. \"Not like her? What put such an idea into your head?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, it's more than an idea--it's a feeling. But what difference does it make, after all? You saw her in such a different setting that it's natural you should be a little doubtful. But when you know her better I'm sure you'll feel about her as I do.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"It's going to be hard for me not to feel about everything as you do.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Well, then--please begin with my daughter-in-law!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He gave her back in the same tone of banter: \"Agreed: if you ll agree to feel as I do about the pressing necessity of our getting married.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I want to talk to you about that too. You don't know what a weight is off my mind! With Sophy here for good, I shall feel so differently about leaving Effie. I've seen much more accomplished governesses--to my cost!--but I've never seen a young thing more gay and kind and human. You must have noticed, though you've seen them so little together, how Effie expands when she's with her. And that, you know, is what I want. Madame de Chantelle will provide the necessary restraint.\" She clasped her hands on his arm. \"Yes, I'm ready to go with you now. But first of all--this very moment!--you must come with me to Effie. She knows, of course, nothing of what's been happening; and I want her to be told first about YOU.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Effie, sought throughout the house, was presently traced to the school-room, and thither Darrow mounted with Anna. He had never seen her so alight with happiness, and he had caught her buoyancy of mood. He kept repeating to himself: \"It's over--it's over,\" as if some monstrous <<midnight|13>> hallucination had been routed by the return of day. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As they approached the school-room door the terrier's barks came to them through laughing remonstrances. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She's giving him his dinner,\" Anna whispered, her hand in Darrow's. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Don't forget the gold-fish!\" they heard another voice call out. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow halted on the threshold. \"Oh--not now!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Not now?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I mean--she'd rather have you tell her first. I'll wait for you both downstairs.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He was aware that she glanced at him intently. \"As you please. I'll bring her down at once.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She opened the door, and as she went in he heard her say: \"No, Sophy, don't go! I want you both.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The rest of Darrow's day was a succession of empty and agitating scenes. On his way down to Givre, before he had seen Effie Leath, he had pictured somewhat sentimentally the joy of the moment when he should take her in his arms and receive her first filial kiss. Everything in him that egotistically craved for rest, stability, a comfortably organized middle-age, all the home-building instincts of the man who has sufficiently wooed and wandered, combined to throw a charm about the figure of the child who might--who should--have been his. Effie came to him trailing the cloud of glory of his first romance, giving him back the magic hour he had missed and mourned. And how different the realization of his dream had been! The child's radiant welcome, her unquestioning acceptance of, this new figure in the family group, had been all that he had hoped and fancied. If Mother was so awfully happy about it, and Owen and Granny, too, how nice and cosy and comfortable it was going to be for all of them, her beaming look seemed to say; and then, suddenly, the small pink fingers he had been kissing were laid on the one flaw in the circle, on the one point which must be settled before Effie could, with complete unqualified assurance, admit the new-comer to full equality with the other gods of her Olympus. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And is Sophy awfully happy about it too?\" she had asked, loosening her hold on Darrow's neck to tilt back her head and include her mother in her questioning look. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why, dearest, didn't you see she was?\" Anna had exclaimed, leaning to the group with radiant eyes. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I think I should like to ask her,\" the child rejoined, after a minute's shy consideration; and as Darrow set her down her mother laughed: \"Do, darling, do! Run off at once, and tell her we expect her to be awfully happy too.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The scene had been succeeded by others less poignant but almost as trying. Darrow cursed his luck in having, at such a moment, to run the gauntlet of a houseful of interested observers. The state of being \"engaged\", in itself an absurd enough predicament, even to a man only intermittently exposed, became intolerable under the continuous scrutiny of a small circle quivering with participation. Darrow was furthermore aware that, though the case of the other couple ought to have made his own less conspicuous, it was rather they who found a refuge in the shadow of his prominence. Madame de Chantelle, though she had consented to Owen's engagement and formally welcomed his betrothed, was nevertheless not sorry to show, by her reception of Darrow, of what finely-shaded degrees of cordiality she was capable. Miss Painter, having won the day for Owen, was also free to turn her attention to the newer candidate for her sympathy; and Darrow and Anna found themselves immersed in a warm bath of sentimental curiosity. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It was a relief to Darrow that he was under a positive obligation to end his visit within the next forty-eight hours. When he left London, his Ambassador had accorded him a ten days' leave. His fate being definitely settled and openly published he had no reason for asking to have the time prolonged, and when it was over he was to return to his post till the time fixed for taking up his new duties. Anna and he had therefore decided to be married, in Paris, a day or two before the departure of the steamer which was to take them to South America; and Anna, shortly after his return to England, was to go up to Paris and begin her own preparations. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In honour of the double betrothal Effie and Miss Viner were to appear that evening at dinner; and Darrow, on leaving his room, met the little girl springing down the stairs, her white ruffles and coral-coloured bows making her look like a daisy with her yellow hair for its centre. Sophy Viner was behind her pupil, and as she came into the light Darrow noticed a change in her appearance and wondered vaguely why she looked suddenly younger, more vivid, more like the little luminous ghost of his Paris memories. Then it occurred to him that it was the first time she had appeared at dinner since his arrival at Givre, and the first time, consequently, that he had seen her in evening dress. She was still at the age when the least adornment embellishes; and no doubt the mere uncovering of her young throat and neck had given her back her former brightness. But a second glance showed a more precise reason for his impression. Vaguely though he retained such details, he felt sure she was wearing the dress he had seen her in every evening in Paris. It was a simple enough dress, black, and transparent on the arms and shoulders, and he would probably not have recognized it if she had not called his attention to it in Paris by confessing that she hadn't any other. \"The same dress? That proves that she's forgotten!\" was his first half-ironic thought; but the next moment, with a pang of compunction, he said to himself that she had probably put it on for the same reason as before: simply because she hadn't any other. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He looked at her in silence, and for an instant, above Effie's bobbing head, she gave him back his look in a full bright gaze. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, there's Owen!\" Effie cried, and whirled away down the gallery to the door from which her step-brother was emerging. As Owen bent to catch her, Sophy Viner turned abruptly back to Darrow. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You, too?\" she said with a quick laugh. \"I didn't know---- \" And as Owen came up to them she added, in a tone that might have been meant to reach his ear: \"I wish you all the luck that we can spare!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} About the dinner-table, which Effie, with Miss Viner's aid, had lavishly garlanded, the little party had an air of somewhat self-conscious festivity. In spite of flowers, champagne and a unanimous attempt at ease, there were frequent lapses in the talk, and moments of nervous groping for new subjects. Miss Painter alone seemed not only unaffected by the general perturbation but as tightly sealed up in her unconsciousness of it as a diver in his bell. To Darrow's strained attention even Owen's gusts of gaiety seemed to betray an inward sense of insecurity. After dinner, however, at the piano, he broke into a mood of extravagant hilarity and flooded the room with the splash and ripple of his music. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow, sunk in a sofa corner in the lee of Miss Painter's granite bulk, smoked and listened in silence, his eyes moving from one figure to another. Madame de Chantelle, in her armchair near the fire, clasped her little granddaughter to her with the gesture of a drawing-room Niobe, and Anna, seated near them, had fallen into one of the attitudes of vivid calm which seemed to Darrow to express her inmost quality. Sophy Viner, after moving uncertainly about the room, had placed herself beyond Mrs. Leath, in a chair near the piano, where she sat with head thrown back and eyes attached to the musician, in the same rapt fixity of attention with which she had followed the players at the Francais. The accident of her having fallen into the same attitude, and of her wearing the same dress, gave Darrow, as he watched her, a strange sense of double consciousness. To escape from it, his glance turned back to Anna; but from the point at which he was placed his eyes could not take in the one face without the other, and that renewed the disturbing duality of the impression. Suddenly Owen broke off with a crash of chords and jumped to his feet. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"What's the use of this, with such a moon to say it for us?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Behind the uncurtained window a low golden orb hung like a ripe fruit against the glass. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes--let's go out and listen,\" Anna answered. Owen threw open the window, and with his gesture a fold of the heavy star-sprinkled sky seemed to droop into the room like a drawn-in curtain. The air that entered with it had a frosty edge, and Anna bade Effie run to the hall for wraps. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow said: \"You must have one too,\" and started toward the door; but Sophy, following her pupil, cried back: \"We'll bring things for everybody.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen had followed her, and in a moment the three reappeared, and the party went out on the terrace. The deep blue purity of the night was unveiled by mist, and the moonlight rimmed the edges of the trees with a silver blur and blanched to unnatural whiteness the statues against their walls of shade. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow and Anna, with Effie between them, strolled to the farther corner of the terrace. Below them, between the fringes of the park, the lawn sloped dimly to the fields above the river. For a few minutes they stood silently side by side, touched to peace beneath the trembling beauty of the sky. When they turned back, Darrow saw that Owen and Sophy Viner, who had gone down the steps to the garden, were also walking in the direction of the house. As they advanced, Sophy paused in a patch of moonlight, between the sharp shadows of the yews, and Darrow noticed that she had thrown over her shoulders a long cloak of some light colour, which suddenly evoked her image as she had entered the restaurant at his side on the night of their first dinner in Paris. A moment later they were all together again on the terrace, and when they re-entered the drawing-room the older ladies were on their way to bed. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Effie, emboldened by the privileges of the evening, was for coaxing Owen to round it off with a game of forfeits or some such reckless climax; but Sophy, resuming her professional role, sounded the summons to bed. In her pupil's wake she made her round of good-nights; but when she proffered her hand to Anna, the latter ignoring the gesture held out both arms. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Good-night, dear child,\" she said impulsively, and drew the girl to her kiss.",

            "The next day was Darrow's last at Givre and, foreseeing that the afternoon and evening would have to be given to the family, he had asked Anna to devote an early hour to the final consideration of their plans. He was to meet her in the brown sitting-room at <<ten|9c:1>>, and they were to walk down to the river and talk over their future in the little pavilion abutting on the wall of the park. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It was just a week since his arrival at Givre, and Anna wished, before he left, to return to the place where they had sat on their first afternoon together. Her sensitiveness to the appeal of inanimate things, to the colour and texture of whatever wove itself into the substance of her emotion, made her want to hear Darrow's voice, and to feel his eyes on her, in the spot where bliss had first flowed into her heart. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} That bliss, in the interval, had wound itself into every fold of her being. Passing, in the first days, from a high shy tenderness to the rush of a secret surrender, it had gradually widened and deepened, to flow on in redoubled beauty. She thought she now knew exactly how and why she loved Darrow, and she could see her whole sky reflected in the deep and tranquil current of her love. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Early the next day, in her sitting-room, she was glancing through the letters which it was Effie's morning privilege to carry up to her. Effie meanwhile circled inquisitively about the room, where there was always something new to engage her infant fancy; and Anna, looking up, saw her suddenly arrested before a photograph of Darrow which, the day before, had taken its place on the writing-table. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna held out her arms with a faint blush. \"You do like him, don't you, dear?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, most awfully, dearest,\" Effie, against her breast, leaned back to assure her with a limpid look. \"And so do Granny and Owen--and I do think Sophy does too,\" she added, after a moment's earnest pondering. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I hope so,\" Anna laughed. She checked the impulse to continue: \"Has she talked to you about him, that you're so sure?\" She did not know what had made the question spring to her lips, but she was glad she had closed them before pronouncing it. Nothing could have been more distasteful to her than to clear up such obscurities by turning on them the tiny flame of her daughter's observation. And what, after all, now that Owen's happiness was secured, did it matter if there were certain reserves in Darrow's approval of his marriage? 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A knock on the door made Anna glance at the clock. \"There's Nurse to carry you off.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"It's Sophy's knock,\" the little girl answered, jumping down to open the door; and Miss Viner in fact stood on the threshold. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Come in,\" Anna said with a smile, instantly remarking how pale she looked. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"May Effie go out for a turn with Nurse?\" the girl asked. \"I should like to speak to you a moment.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Of course. This ought to be your holiday, as yesterday was Effie's. Run off, dear,\" she added, stooping to kiss the little girl. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} When the door had closed she turned back to Sophy Viner with a look that sought her confidence. \"I'm so glad you came, my dear. We've got so many things to talk about, just you and I together.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The confused intercourse of the last days had, in fact, left little time for any speech with Sophy but such as related to her marriage and the means of overcoming Madame de Chantelle's opposition to it. Anna had exacted of Owen that no one, not even Sophy Viner, should be given a hint of her own projects till all contingent questions had been disposed of. She had felt, from the outset, a secret reluctance to intrude her securer happiness on the doubts and fears of the young pair. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} From the sofa-corner to which she had dropped back she pointed to Darrow's chair. \"Come and sit by me, dear. I wanted to see you alone. There's so much to say that I hardly know where to begin.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She leaned forward, her hands clasped on the arms of the sofa, her eyes bent smilingly on Sophy's. As she did so, she noticed that the girl's unusual pallour was partly due to the slight veil of powder on her face. The discovery was distinctly disagreeable. Anna had never before noticed, on Sophy's part, any recourse to cosmetics, and, much as she wished to think herself exempt from old-fashioned prejudices, she suddenly became aware that she did not like her daughter's governess to have a powdered face. Then she reflected that the girl who sat opposite her was no longer Effie's governess, but her own future daughter-in-law; and she wondered whether Miss Viner had chosen this odd way of celebrating her independence, and whether, as Mrs. Owen Leath, she would present to the world a bedizened countenance. This idea was scarcely less distasteful than the other, and for a moment Anna continued to consider her without speaking. Then, in a flash, the truth came to her: Miss Viner had powdered her face because Miss Viner had been crying. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna leaned forward impulsively. \"My dear child, what's the matter?\" She saw the girl's blood rush up under the white mask, and hastened on: \"Please don't be afraid to tell me. I do so want you to feel that you can trust me as Owen does. And you know you mustn't mind if, just at first, Madame de Chantelle occasionally relapses.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She spoke eagerly, persuasively, almost on a note of pleading. She had, in truth, so many reasons for wanting Sophy to like her: her love for Owen, her solicitude for Effie, and her own sense of the girl's fine mettle. She had always felt a romantic and almost humble admiration for those members of her sex who, from force of will, or the constraint of circumstances, had plunged into the conflict from which fate had so persistently excluded her. There were even moments when she fancied herself vaguely to blame for her immunity, and felt that she ought somehow to have affronted the perils and hardships which refused to come to her. And now, as she sat looking at Sophy Viner, so small, so slight, so visibly defenceless and undone, she still felt, through all the superiority of her worldly advantages and her seeming maturity, the same odd sense of ignorance and inexperience. She could not have said what there was in the girl's manner and expression to give her this feeling, but she was reminded, as she looked at Sophy Viner, of the other girls she had known in her youth, the girls who seemed possessed of a secret she had missed. Yes, Sophy Viner had their look--almost the obscurely menacing look of Kitty Mayne...Anna, with an inward smile, brushed aside the image of this forgotten rival. But she had felt, deep down, a twinge of the old pain, and she was sorry that, even for the flash of a thought, Owen's betrothed should have reminded her of so different a woman... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She laid her hand on the girl's. \"When his grandmother sees how happy Owen is she'll be quite happy herself. If it's only that, don't be distressed. Just trust to Owen--and the future.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sophy Viner, with an almost imperceptible recoil of her whole slight person, had drawn her hand from under the palm enclosing it. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"That's what I wanted to talk to you about--the future.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Of course! We've all so many plans to make--and to fit into each other's. Please let's begin with yours.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The girl paused a moment, her hands clasped on the arms of her chair, her lids dropped under Anna's gaze; then she said: \"I should like to make no plans at all...just yet...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"No plans?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"No-I should like to go away...my friends the Farlows would let me go to them...\" Her voice grew firmer and she lifted her eyes to add: \"I should like to leave today, if you don't mind.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna listened with a rising wonder. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You want to leave Givre at once?\" She gave the idea a moment's swift consideration. \"You prefer to be with your friends till your marriage? I understand that--but surely you needn't rush off today? There are so many details to discuss; and before long, you know, I shall be going away too.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes, I know.\" The girl was evidently trying to steady her voice. \"But I should like to wait a few days--to have a little more time to myself.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna continued to consider her kindly. It was evident that she did not care to say why she wished to leave Givre so suddenly, but her disturbed face and shaken voice betrayed a more pressing motive than the natural desire to spend the weeks before her marriage under her old friends' roof. Since she had made no response to the allusion to Madame de Chantelle, Anna could but conjecture that she had had a passing disagreement with Owen; and if this were so, random interference might do more harm than good. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"My dear child, if you really want to go at once I sha'n't, of course, urge you to stay. I suppose you have spoken to Owen?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"No. Not yet...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna threw an astonished glance at her. \"You mean to say you haven't told him?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I wanted to tell you first. I thought I ought to, on account of Effie.\" Her look cleared as she put forth this reason. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, Effie!--\" Anna's smile brushed away the scruple. \"Owen has a right to ask that you should consider him before you think of his sister...Of course you shall do just as you wish,\" she went on, after another thoughtful interval. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, thank you,\" Sophy Viner murmured and rose to her feet. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna rose also, vaguely seeking for some word that should break down the girl's resistance. \"You'll tell Owen at once?\" she finally asked. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Miss Viner, instead of replying, stood before her in manifest uncertainty, and as she did so there was a light tap on the door, and Owen Leath walked into the room. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna's first glance told her that his face was unclouded. He met her greeting with his happiest smile and turned to lift Sophy's hand to his lips. The perception that he was utterly unconscious of any cause for Miss Viner's agitation came to his step-mother with a sharp thrill of surprise. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Darrow's looking for you,\" he said to her. \"He asked me to remind you that you'd promised to go for a walk with him.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna glanced at the clock. \"I'll go down presently.\" She waited and looked again at Sophy Viner, whose troubled eyes seemed to commit their message to her. \"You'd better tell Owen, my dear.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen's look also turned on the girl. \"Tell me what? Why, what's happened?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna summoned a laugh to ease the vague tension of the moment. \"Don't look so startled! Nothing, except that Sophy proposes to desert us for a while for the Farlows.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen's brow cleared. \"I was afraid she'd run off before long.\" He glanced at Anna. \"Do please keep her here as long as you can!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sophy intervened: \"Mrs. Leath's already given me leave to go.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Already? To go when?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Today,\" said Sophy in a low tone, her eyes on Anna's. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Today? Why on earth should you go today?\" Owen dropped back a step or two, flushing and paling under his bewildered frown. His eyes seemed to search the girl more closely. \"Something's happened.\" He too looked at his step-mother. \"I suppose she must have told you what it is?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna was struck by the suddenness and vehemence of his appeal. It was as though some smouldering apprehension had lain close under the surface of his security. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She's told me nothing except that she wishes to be with her friends. It's quite natural that she should want to go to them.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen visibly controlled himself. \"Of course--quite natural.\" He spoke to Sophy. \"But why didn't you tell me so? Why did you come first to my step-mother?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna intervened with her calm smile. \"That seems to me quite natural, too. Sophy was considerate enough to tell me first because of Effie.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He weighed it. \"Very well, then: that's quite natural, as you say. And of course she must do exactly as she pleases.\" He still kept his eyes on the girl. \"Tomorrow,\" he abruptly announced, \"I shall go up to Paris to see you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, no--no!\" she protested. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen turned back to Anna. \"Now do you say that nothing's happened?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Under the influence of his agitation Anna felt a vague tightening of the heart. She seemed to herself like some one in a dark room about whom unseen presences are groping. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"If it's anything that Sophy wishes to tell you, no doubt she'll do so. I'm going down now, and I'll leave you here to talk it over by yourselves.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As she moved to the door the girl caught up with her. \"But there's nothing to tell: why should there be? I've explained that I simply want to be quiet.\" Her look seemed to detain Mrs. Leath. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen broke in: \"Is that why I mayn't go up tomorrow?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Not tomorrow!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Then when may I?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Later...in a little while...a few days...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"In how many days?\" \"Owen!\" his step-mother interposed; but he seemed no longer aware of her. \"If you go away today, the day that our engagement's made known, it's only fair,\" he persisted, \"that you should tell me when I am to see you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Sophy's eyes wavered between the two and dropped down wearily. \"It's you who are not fair--when I've said I wanted to be quiet.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But why should my coming disturb you? I'm not asking now to come tomorrow. I only ask you not to leave without telling me when I'm to see you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Owen, I don't understand you!\" his step-mother exclaimed. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You don't understand my asking for some explanation, some assurance, when I'm left in this way, without a word, without a sign? All I ask her to tell me is when she'll see me.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna turned back to Sophy Viner, who stood straight and tremulous between the two. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"After all, my dear, he's not unreasonable!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I'll write--I'll write,\" the girl repeated. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"What will you write?\" he pressed her vehemently. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Owen,\" Anna exclaimed, \"you are unreasonable!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He turned from Sophy to his step-mother. \"I only want her to say what she means: that she's going to write to break off our engagement. Isn't that what you're going away for?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna felt the contagion of his excitement. She looked at Sophy, who stood motionless, her lips set, her whole face drawn to a silent fixity of resistance. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You ought to speak, my dear--you ought to answer him.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I only ask him to wait----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes,\" Owen, broke in, \"and you won't say how long!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Both instinctively addressed themselves to Anna, who stood, nearly as shaken as themselves, between the double shock of their struggle. She looked again from Sophy's inscrutable eyes to Owen's stormy features; then she said: \"What can I do, when there's clearly something between you that I don't know about?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, if it were between us! Can't you see it's outside of us--outside of her, dragging at her, dragging her away from me?\" Owen wheeled round again upon his step-mother. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna turned from him to the girl. \"Is it true that you want to break your engagement? If you do, you ought to tell him now.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Owen burst into a laugh. \"She doesn't dare to--she's afraid I'll guess the reason!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A faint sound escaped from Sophy's lips, but she kept them close on whatever answer she had ready. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"If she doesn't wish to marry you, why should she be afraid to have you know the reason?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She's afraid to have you know it--not me!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"To have ME know it?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He laughed again, and Anna, at his laugh, felt a sudden rush of indignation. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Owen, you must explain what you mean!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He looked at her hard before answering; then: \"Ask Darrow!\" he said. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Owen--Owen!\" Sophy Viner murmured.",

            "Darrow had no idea how long he had sat there when he heard Anna's hand on the door. The effort of rising, and of composing his face to meet her, gave him a factitious sense of self-control. He said to himself: \"I must decide on something----\" and that lifted him a hair's breadth above the whirling waters. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She came in with a lighter step, and he instantly perceived that something unforeseen and reassuring had happened. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She's been with me. She came and found me on the terrace. We've had a long talk and she's explained everything. I feel as if I'd never known her before!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her voice was so moved and tender that it checked his start of apprehension. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She's explained----?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"It's natural, isn't it, that she should have felt a little sore at the kind of inspection she's been subjected to? Oh, not from you-I don't mean that! But Madame de Chantelle's opposition--and her sending for Adelaide Painter! She told me frankly she didn't care to owe her husband to Adelaide Painter...She thinks now that her annoyance at feeling herself so talked over and scrutinized may have shown itself in her manner to Owen, and set him imagining the insane things he did...I understand all she must have felt, and I agree with her that it's best she should go away for a while. She's made me,\" Anna summed up, \"feel as if I'd been dreadfully thick-skinned and obtuse!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"YOU?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes. As if I'd treated her like the bric-a-brac that used to be sent down here 'on approval,' to see if it would look well with the other pieces.\" She added, with a sudden flush of enthusiasm: \"I'm glad she's got it in her to make one feel like that!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She seemed to wait for Darrow to agree with her, or to put some other question, and he finally found voice to ask: \"Then you think it's not a final break?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I hope not--I've never hoped it more! I had a word with Owen, too, after I left her, and I think he understands that he must let her go without insisting on any positive promise. She's excited...he must let her calm down...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Again she waited, and Darrow said: \"Surely you can make him see that.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She'll help me to--she's to see him, of course, before she goes. She starts immediately, by the way, with Adelaide Painter, who is motoring over to Francheuil to catch the <<one o'clock|6>> express--and who, of course, knows nothing of all this, and is simply to be told that Sophy has been sent for by the Farlows.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow mutely signed his comprehension, and she went on: \"Owen is particularly anxious that neither Adelaide nor his grandmother should have the least inkling of what's happened. The need of shielding Sophy will help him to control himself. He's coming to his senses, poor boy; he's ashamed of his wild talk already. He asked me to tell you so; no doubt he'll tell you so himself.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow made a movement of protest. \"Oh, as to that--the thing's not worth another word.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Or another thought, either?\" She brightened. \"Promise me you won't even think of it--promise me you won't be hard on him!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He was finding it easier to smile back at her. \"Why should you think it necessary to ask my indulgence for Owen?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She hesitated a moment, her eyes wandering from him. Then they came back with a smile. \"Perhaps because I need it for myself.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"For yourself?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I mean, because I understand better how one can torture one's self over unrealities.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} As Darrow listened, the tension of his nerves began to relax. Her gaze, so grave and yet so sweet, was like a deep pool into which he could plunge and hide himself from the hard glare of his misery. As this ecstatic sense enveloped him he found it more and more difficult to follow her words and to frame an answer; but what did anything matter, except that her voice should go on, and the syllables fall like soft touches on his tortured brain? 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Don't you know,\" she continued, \"the bliss of waking from a bad dream in one's own quiet room, and going slowly over all the horror without being afraid of it any more? That's what I'm doing now. And that's why I understand Owen...\" She broke off, and he felt her touch on his arm. \"Because
I'd dreamed the horror too!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He understood her then, and stammered: \"You?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Forgive me! And let me tell you!...It will help you to understand Owen...There were little things...little signs...once I had begun to watch for them: your reluctance to speak about her...her reserve with you...a sort of constraint we'd never seen in her before...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She laughed up at him, and with her hands in his he contrived to say: \"NOW you understand why?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, I understand; of course I understand; and I want you to laugh at me--with me! Because there were other things too...crazier things still...There was even--last night on the terrace--her pink cloak...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Her pink cloak?\" Now he honestly wondered, and as she saw it she blushed. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You've forgotten about the cloak? The pink cloak that Owen saw you with at the play in Paris? Yes...yes...I was mad enough for that!...It does me good to laugh about it now! But you ought to know that I'm going to be a jealous woman...a ridiculously jealous woman...you ought to be warned of it in time...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He had dropped her hands, and she leaned close and lifted her arms to his neck with one of her rare gestures of surrender. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I don't know why it is; but it makes me happier now to have been so foolish!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her lips were parted in a noiseless laugh and the tremor of her lashes made their shadow move on her cheek. He looked at her through a mist of pain and saw all her offered beauty held up like a cup to his lips; but as he stooped to it a darkness seemed to fall between them, her arms slipped from his shoulders and she drew away from him abruptly. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But she was with you, then?\" she exclaimed; and then, as he stared at her: \"Oh, don't say no! Only go and look at your eyes!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He stood speechless, and she pressed on: \"Don't deny it--oh, don't deny it! What will be left for me to imagine if you do? Don't you see how every single thing cries it out? Owen sees it--he saw it again just now! When I told him she'd relented, and would see him, he said: 'Is that Darrow's doing too?'\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow took the onslaught in silence. He might have spoken, have summoned up the usual phrases of banter and denial; he was not even certain that they might not, for the moment, have served their purpose if he could have uttered them without being seen. But he was as conscious of what had happened to his face as if he had obeyed Anna's bidding and looked at himself in the glass. He knew he could no more hide from her what was written there than he could efface from his soul the fiery record of what he had just lived through. There before him, staring him in the eyes, and reflecting itself in all his lineaments, was the overwhelming fact of Sophy Viner's passion and of the act by which she had attested it. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna was talking again, hurriedly, feverishly, and his soul was wrung by the anguish in her voice. \"Do speak at last-- you must speak! I don't want to ask you to harm the girl; but you must see that your silence is doing her more harm than your answering my questions could. You're leaving me only the worst things to think of her...she'd see that herself if she were here. What worse injury can you do her than to make me hate her--to make me feel she's plotted with you to deceive us?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, not that!\" Darrow heard his own voice before he was aware that he meant to speak. \"Yes; I did see her in Paris,\" he went on after a pause; \"but I was bound to respect her reason for not wanting it known.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Anna paled. \"It was she at the theatre that night?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I was with her at the theatre one night.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why should she have asked you not to say so?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She didn't wish it known that I'd met her.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why shouldn't she have wished it known?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She had quarrelled with Mrs. Murrett and come over suddenly to Paris, and she didn't want the Farlows to hear of it. I came across her by accident, and she asked me not to speak of having seen her.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Because of her quarrel? Because she was ashamed of her part in it?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, no. There was nothing for her to be ashamed of. But the Farlows had found the place for her, and she didn't want them to know how suddenly she'd had to leave, and how badly Mrs. Murrett had behaved. She was in a terrible plight--the woman had even kept back her month's salary. She knew the Farlows would be awfully upset, and she wanted more time to prepare them.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow heard himself speak as though the words had proceeded from other lips. His explanation sounded plausible enough, and he half-fancied Anna's look grew lighter. She waited a moment, as though to be sure he had no more to add; then she said: \"But the Farlows did know; they told me all about it when they sent her to me.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He flushed as if she had laid a deliberate trap for him. \"They may know now; they didn't then----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"That's no reason for her continuing now to make a mystery of having met you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"It's the only reason I can give you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Then I'll go and ask her for one myself.\" She turned and took a few steps toward the door. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Anna!\" He started to follow her, and then checked himself. \"Don't do that!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Why not?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"It's not like you...not generous...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She stood before him straight and pale, but under her rigid face he saw the tumult of her doubt and misery. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I don't want to be ungenerous; I don't want to pry into her secrets. But things can't be left like this. Wouldn't it be better for me to go to her? Surely she'll understand--she'll explain...It may be some mere trifle she's concealing: something that would horrify the Farlows, but that I shouldn't see any harm in...\" She paused, her eyes searching his face. \"A love affair, I suppose...that's it? You met her with some man at the theatre--and she was frightened and begged you to fib about it? Those poor young things that have to go about among us like machines--oh, if you knew how I pity them!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"If you pity her, why not let her go?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She stared. \"Let her go--go for good, you mean? Is that the best you can say for her?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Let things take their course. After all, it's between herself and Owen.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"And you and me--and Effie, if Owen marries her, and I leave my child with them! Don't you see the impossibility of what you're asking? We're all bound together in this coil.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow turned away with a groan. \"Oh, let her go--let her go.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Then there is something--something really bad? She WAS with some one when you met her? Some one with whom she was----\" She broke off, and he saw her struggling with new thoughts. \"If it's that, of course...Oh, don't you see,\" she desperately appealed to him, \"that I must find out, and that it's too late now for you not to speak? Don't be afraid that I'll betray you...I'll never, never let a soul suspect. But I must know the truth, and surely it's best for her that I should find it out from you.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow waited a moment; then he said slowly: \"What you imagine's mere madness. She was at the theatre with me.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"With you?\" He saw a tremor pass through her, but she controlled it instantly and faced him straight and motionless as a wounded creature in the moment before it feels its wound. \"Why should you both have made a mystery of that?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I've told you the idea was not mine.\" He cast about. \"She may have been afraid that Owen----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But that was not a reason for her asking you to tell me that you hardly knew her--that you hadn't even seen her for years.\" She broke off and the blood rose to her face and forehead. \"Even if she had other reasons, there could be only one reason for your obeying her----\" Silence fell between them, a silence in which the room seemed to become suddenly resonant with voices. Darrow's gaze wandered to the window and he noticed that the gale of two days before had nearly stripped the tops of the lime- trees in the court. Anna had moved away and was resting her elbows against the mantel-piece, her head in her hands. As she stood there he took in with a new intensity of vision little details of her appearance that his eyes had often cherished: the branching blue veins in the backs of her hands, the warm shadow that her hair cast on her ear, and the colour of the hair itself, dull black with a tawny under-surface, like the wings of certain birds. He felt it to be useless to speak. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} After a while she lifted her head and said: \"I shall not see her again before she goes.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He made no answer, and turning to him she added: \"That is why she's going, I suppose? Because she loves you and won't give you up?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Darrow waited. The paltriness of conventional denial was so apparent to him that even if it could have delayed discovery he could no longer have resorted to it. Under all his other fears was the dread of dishonouring the hour. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"She has given me up,\" he said at last.",

            "Anna Leath, three days later, sat in Miss Painter's drawing- room in the rue de Matignon. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Coming up precipitately that morning from the country, she had reached Paris at <<one o'clock|6>> and Miss Painter's landing some ten minutes later. Miss Painter's mouldy little man- servant, dissembling a napkin under his arm, had mildly attempted to oppose her entrance; but Anna, insisting, had gone straight to the dining-room and surprised her friend-- who ate as furtively as certain animals--over a strange meal of cold mutton and lemonade. Ignoring the embarrassment she caused, she had set forth the object of her journey, and Miss Painter, always hatted and booted for action, had immediately hastened out, leaving her to the solitude of the bare fireless drawing-room with its eternal slip-covers and \"bowed\" shutters. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In this inhospitable obscurity Anna had sat alone for close upon two hours. Both obscurity and solitude were acceptable to her, and impatient as she was to hear the result of the errand on which she had despatched her hostess, she desired still more to be alone. During her long meditation in a white-swathed chair before the muffled hearth she had been able for the first time to clear a way through the darkness and confusion of her thoughts. The way did not go far, and her attempt to trace it was as weak and spasmodic as a convalescent's first efforts to pick up the thread of living. She seemed to herself like some one struggling to rise from a long sickness of which it would have been so much easier to die. At Givre she had fallen into a kind of torpor, a deadness of soul traversed by wild flashes of pain; but whether she suffered or whether she was numb, she seemed equally remote from her real living and doing self. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} It was only the discovery--that very morning--of Owen's unannounced departure for Paris that had caught her out of her dream and forced her back to action. The dread of what this flight might imply, and of the consequences that might result from it, had roused her to the sense of her responsibility, and from the moment when she had resolved to follow her step-son, and had made her rapid preparations for pursuit, her mind had begun to work again, feverishly, fitfully, but still with something of its normal order. In the train she had been too agitated, too preoccupied with what might next await her, to give her thoughts to anything but the turning over of dread alternatives; but Miss Painter's imperviousness had steadied her, and while she waited for the sound of the latch-key she resolutely returned upon herself. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} With respect to her outward course she could at least tell herself that she had held to her purpose. She had, as people said, \"kept up\" during the twenty-four hours preceding George Darrow's departure; had gone with a calm face about her usual business, and even contrived not too obviously to avoid him. Then, the next day before dawn, from behind the closed shutters where she had kept for half the night her dry-eyed vigil, she had heard him drive off to the train which brought its passengers to Paris in time for the Calais express. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The fact of his taking that train, of his travelling so straight and far away from her, gave to what had happened the implacable outline of reality. He was gone; he would not come back; and her life had ended just as she had dreamed it was beginning. She had no doubt, at first, as to the absolute inevitability of this conclusion. The man who had driven away from her house in the autumn dawn was not the man she had loved; he was a stranger with whom she had not a single thought in common. It was terrible, indeed, that he wore the face and spoke in the voice of her friend, and that, as long as he was under one roof with her, the mere way in which he moved and looked could bridge at a stroke the gulf between them. That, no doubt, was the fault of her exaggerated sensibility to outward things: she was frightened to see how it enslaved her. A day or two before she had supposed the sense of honour was her deepest sentiment: if she had smiled at the conventions of others it was because they were too trivial, not because they were too grave. There were certain dishonours with which she had never dreamed that any pact could be made: she had had an incorruptible passion for good faith and fairness. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She had supposed that, once Darrow was gone, once she was safe from the danger of seeing and hearing him, this high devotion would sustain her. She had believed it would be possible to separate the image of the man she had thought him from that of the man he was. She had even foreseen the hour when she might raise a mournful shrine to the memory of the Darrow she had loved, without fear that his double's shadow would desecrate it. But now she had begun to understand that the two men were really one. The Darrow she worshipped was inseparable from the Darrow she abhorred; and the inevitable conclusion was that both must go, and she be left in the desert of a sorrow without memories... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} But if the future was thus void, the present was all too full. Never had blow more complex repercussions; and to remember Owen was to cease to think of herself. What impulse, what apprehension, had sent him suddenly to Paris? And why had he thought it needful to conceal his going from her? When Sophy Viner had left, it had been with the understanding that he was to await her summons; and it seemed improbable that he would break his pledge, and seek her without leave, unless his lover's intuition had warned him of some fresh danger. Anna recalled how quickly he had read the alarm in her face when he had rushed back to her sitting-room with the news that Miss Viner had promised to see him again in Paris. To be so promptly roused, his suspicions must have been but half-asleep; and since then, no doubt, if she and Darrow had dissembled, so had he. To her proud directness it was degrading to think that they had been living together like enemies who spy upon each other's movements: she felt a desperate longing for the days which had seemed so dull and narrow, but in which she had walked with her head high and her eyes unguarded. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She had come up to Paris hardly knowing what peril she feared, and still less how she could avert it. If Owen meant to see Miss Viner--and what other object could he have?--they must already be together, and it was too late to interfere. It had indeed occurred to Anna that Paris might not be his objective point: that his real purpose in leaving Givre without her knowledge had been to follow Darrow to London and exact the truth of him. But even to her alarmed imagination this seemed improbable. She and Darrow, to the last, had kept up so complete a feint of harmony that, whatever Owen had surmised, he could scarcely have risked acting on his suspicions. If he still felt the need of an explanation, it was almost certainly of Sophy Viner that he would ask it; and it was in quest of Sophy Viner that Anna had despatched Miss Painter. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She had found a blessed refuge from her perplexities in the stolid Adelaide's unawareness. One could so absolutely count on Miss Painter's guessing no more than one chose, and yet acting astutely on such hints as one vouchsafed her! She was like a well-trained retriever whose interest in his prey ceases when he lays it at his master's feet. Anna, on arriving, had explained that Owen's unannounced flight had made her fear some fresh misunderstanding between himself and Miss Viner. In the interests of peace she had thought it best to follow him; but she hastily added that she did not wish to see Sophy, but only, if possible, to learn from her where Owen was. With these brief instructions Miss Painter had started out; but she was a woman of many occupations, and had given her visitor to understand that before returning she should have to call on a friend who had just arrived from Boston, and afterward despatch to another exiled compatriot a supply of cranberries and brandied peaches from the American grocery in the Champs Elysees. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Gradually, as the moments passed, Anna began to feel the reaction which, in moments of extreme nervous tension, follows on any effort of the will. She seemed to have gone as far as her courage would carry her, and she shrank more and more from the thought of Miss Painter's return, since whatever information the latter brought would necessitate some fresh decision. What should she say to Owen if she found him? What could she say that should not betray the one thing she would give her life to hide from him? \"Give her life\"--how the phrase derided her! It was a gift she would not have bestowed on her worst enemy. She would not have had Sophy Viner live the hours she was living now... She tried again to look steadily and calmly at the picture that the image of the girl evoked. She had an idea that she ought to accustom herself to its contemplation. If life was like that, why the sooner one got used to it the better...But no! Life was not like that. Her adventure was a hideous accident. She dreaded above all the temptation to generalise from her own case, to doubt the high things she had lived by and seek a cheap solace in belittling what fate had refused her. There was such love as she had dreamed, and she meant to go on believing in it, and cherishing the thought that she was worthy of it. What had happened to her was grotesque and mean and miserable; but she herself was none of these things, and never, never would she make of herself the mock that fate had made of her... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She could not, as yet, bear to think deliberately of Darrow; but she kept on repeating to herself \"By and bye that will come too.\" Even now she was determined not to let his image be distorted by her suffering. As soon as she could, she would try to single out for remembrance the individual things she had liked in him before she had loved him altogether. No \"spiritual exercise\" devised by the discipline of piety could have been more torturing; but its very cruelty attracted her. She wanted to wear herself out with new pains...",

            "She drove from Miss Painter's to her own apartment. The maid-servant who had it in charge had been apprised of her coming, and had opened one or two of the rooms, and prepared a fire in her bedroom. Anna shut herself in, refusing the woman's ministrations. She felt cold and faint, and after she had taken off her hat and cloak she knelt down by the fire and stretched her hands to it. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} In one respect, at least, it was clear to her that she would do well to follow Sophy Viner's counsel. It had been an act of folly to follow Owen, and her first business was to get back to Givre before him. But the only train leaving that evening was a slow one, which did not reach Francheuil till <<midnight|13>>, and she knew that her taking it would excite Madame de Chantelle's wonder and lead to interminable talk. She had come up to Paris on the pretext of finding a new governess for Effie, and the natural thing was to defer her return till the next morning. She knew Owen well enough to be sure that he would make another attempt to see Miss Viner, and failing that, would write again and await her answer: so that there was no likelihood of his reaching Givre till the following evening. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her sense of relief at not having to start out at once showed her for the first time how tired she was. The bonne had suggested a cup of tea, but the dread of having any one about her had made Anna refuse, and she had eaten nothing since morning but a sandwich bought at a buffet. She was too tired to get up, but stretching out her arm she drew toward her the arm-chair which stood beside the hearth and rested her head against its cushions. Gradually the warmth of the fire stole into her veins and her heaviness of soul was replaced by a dreamy buoyancy. She seemed to be seated on the hearth in her sitting-room at Givre, and Darrow was beside her, in the chair against which she leaned. He put his arms about her shoulders and drawing her head back looked into her eyes. \"Of all the ways you do your hair, that's the way I like best,\" he said... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} A log dropped, and she sat up with a start. There was a warmth in her heart, and she was smiling. Then she looked about her, and saw where she was, and the glory fell. She hid her face and sobbed. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Presently she perceived that it was growing dark, and getting up stiffly she began to undo the things in her bag and spread them on the dressing-table. She shrank from lighting the lights, and groped her way about, trying to find what she needed. She seemed immeasurably far off from every one, and most of all from herself. It was as if her consciousness had been transmitted to some stranger whose thoughts and gestures were indifferent to her... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Suddenly she heard a shrill tinkle, and with a beating heart she stood still in the middle of the room. It was the telephone in her dressing-room--a call, no doubt, from Adelaide Painter. Or could Owen have learned she was in town? The thought alarmed her and she opened the door and stumbled across the unlit room to the instrument. She held it to her ear, and heard Darrow's voice pronounce her name. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Will you let me see you? I've come back-I had to come. Miss Painter told me you were here.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She began to tremble, and feared that he would guess it from her voice. She did not know what she answered: she heard him say: \"I can't hear.\" She called \"Yes!\" and laid the telephone down, and caught it up again--but he was gone. She wondered if her \"Yes\" had reached him. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She sat in her chair and listened. Why had she said that she would see him? What did she mean to say to him when he came? Now and then, as she sat there, the sense of his presence enveloped her as in her dream, and she shut her eyes and felt his arms about her. Then she woke to reality and shivered. A long time elapsed, and at length she said to herself: \"He isn't coming.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The door-bell rang as she said it, and she stood up, cold and trembling. She thought: \"Can he imagine there's any use in coming?\" and moved forward to bid the servant say she could not see him. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The door opened and she saw him standing in the drawing- room. The room was cold and fireless, and a hard glare fell from the wall-lights on the shrouded furniture and the white slips covering the curtains. He looked pale and stern, with a frown of fatigue between his eyes; and she remembered that in three days he had travelled from Givre to London and back. It seemed incredible that all that had befallen her should have been compressed within the space of three days! 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Thank you,\" he said as she came in. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She answered: \"It's better, I suppose----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He came toward her and took her in his arms. She struggled a little, afraid of yielding, but he pressed her to him, not bending to her but holding her fast, as though he had found her after a long search: she heard his hurried breathing. It seemed to come from her own breast, so close he held her; and it was she who, at last, lifted up her face and drew down his. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She freed herself and went and sat on a sofa at the other end of the room. A mirror between the shrouded window- curtains showed her crumpled travelling dress and the white face under her disordered hair 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She found her voice, and asked him how he had been able to leave London. He answered that he had managed--he'd arranged it; and she saw he hardly heard what she was saying. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I had to see you,\" he went on, and moved nearer, sitting down at her side. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes; we must think of Owen----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, Owen--!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Her mind had flown back to Sophy Viner's plea that she should let Darrow return to Givre in order that Owen might be persuaded of the folly of his suspicions. The suggestion was absurd, of course. She could not ask Darrow to lend himself to such a fraud, even had she had the inhuman courage to play her part in it. She was suddenly overwhelmed by the futility of every attempt to reconstruct her ruined world. No, it was useless; and since it was useless, every moment with Darrow was pure pain... 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I've come to talk of myself, not of Owen,\" she heard him saying. \"When you sent me away the other day I understood that it couldn't be otherwise--then. But it's not possible that you and I should part like that. If I'm to lose you, it must be for a better reason.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"A better reason?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes: a deeper one. One that means a fundamental disaccord between us. This one doesn't--in spite of everything it doesn't. That's what I want you to see, and have the courage to acknowledge.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"If I saw it I should have the courage!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes: courage was the wrong word. You have that. That's why I'm here.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"But I don't see it,\" she continued sadly. \"So it's useless, isn't it?--and so cruel...\" He was about to speak, but she went on: \"I shall never understand it--never!\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He looked at her. \"You will some day: you were made to feel everything\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I should have thought this was a case of not feeling----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"On my part, you mean?\" He faced her resolutely. \"Yes, it was: to my shame...What I meant was that when you've lived a little longer you'll see what complex blunderers we all are: how we're struck blind sometimes, and mad sometimes--and then, when our sight and our senses come back, how we have to set to work, and build up, little by little, bit by bit, the precious things we'd smashed to atoms without knowing it. Life's just a perpetual piecing together of broken bits.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She looked up quickly. \"That's what I feel: that you ought to----\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He stood up, interrupting her with a gesture. \"Oh, don't-- don't say what you're going to! Men don't give their lives away like that. If you won't have mine, it's at least my own, to do the best I can with.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"The best you can--that's what I mean! How can there be a 'best' for you that's made of some one else's worst?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} He sat down again with a groan. \"I don't know! It seemed such a slight thing--all on the surface--and I've gone aground on it because it was on the surface. I see the horror of it just as you do. But I see, a little more clearly, the extent, and the limits, of my wrong. It's not as black as you imagine.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She lowered her voice to say: \"I suppose I shall never understand; but she seems to love you...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"There's my shame! That I didn't guess it, didn't fly from it. You say you'll never understand: but why shouldn't you? Is it anything to be proud of, to know so little of the strings that pull us? If you knew a little more, I could tell you how such things happen without offending you; and perhaps you'd listen without condemning me.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I don't condemn you.\" She was dizzy with struggling impulses. She longed to cry out: \"I do understand! I've understood ever since you've been here!\" For she was aware, in her own bosom, of sensations so separate from her romantic thoughts of him that she saw her body and soul divided against themselves. She recalled having read somewhere that in ancient Rome the slaves were not allowed to wear a distinctive dress lest they should recognize each other and learn their numbers and their power. So, in herself, she discerned for the first time instincts and desires, which, mute and unmarked, had gone to and fro in the dim passages of her mind, and now hailed each other with a cry of mutiny. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, I don't know what to think!\" she broke out. \"You say you didn't know she loved you. But you know it now. Doesn't that show you how you can put the broken bits together?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Can you seriously think it would be doing so to marry one woman while I care for another?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Oh, I don't know...I don't know...\" The sense of her weakness made her try to harden herself against his arguments. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You do know! We've often talked of such things: of the monstrousness of useless sacrifices. If I'm to expiate, it's not in that way.\" He added abruptly: \"It's in having to say this to you now...\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She found no answer. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} Through the silent apartment they heard the sudden peal of the door-bell, and she rose to her feet. \"Owen!\" she instantly exclaimed. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Is Owen in Paris?\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} She explained in a rapid undertone what she had learned from Sophy Viner. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Shall I leave you?\" Darrow asked. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"Yes...no...\" She moved to the dining-room door, with the half-formed purpose of making him pass out, and then turned back. \"It may be Adelaide.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} They heard the outer door open, and a moment later Owen walked into the room. He was pale, with excited eyes: as they fell on Darrow, Anna saw his start of wonder. He made a slight sign of recognition, and then went up to his step- mother with an air of exaggerated gaiety. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"You furtive person! I ran across the omniscient Adelaide and heard from her that you'd rushed up suddenly and secretly \" He stood between Anna and Darrow, strained, questioning, dangerously on edge. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"I came up to meet Mr. Darrow,\" Anna answered. \"His leave's been prolonged--he's going back with me.\" 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The words seemed to have uttered themselves without her will, yet she felt a great sense of freedom as she spoke them. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} The hard tension of Owen's face changed to incredulous surprise. He looked at Darrow. \"The merest luck...a colleague whose wife was ill...I came straight back,\" she heard the latter tranquilly explaining. His self-command helped to steady her, and she smiled at Owen. 
\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0}\x{a0} \"We'll all go back together tomorrow morning,\" she said as she slipped her arm through his.",
