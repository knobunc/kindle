            "Quite dangerous. As we'll see, physics tells us that when it hits the ground the bullet will have the same velocity it had when it left the muzzle of the pistol, which can be 700 to 800 miles per hour (1,100 to 1,300 kilometers per hour). But that ignores air resistance. More realistically, the bullet's landing speed can be <<around 100|18:1>> to 150 miles per hour (160 to 240 kilometers per hour). That's fast enough to penetrate human skin, and even if it doesn't penetrate it can still do a lot of damage. But just try to tell that to the idiots who like to shoot their guns \x{201c}harmlessly\x{201d} into the air.",

            'Early bullets were round balls of lead, like miniature cannonballs. Bullet-shaped (Techspeak: cylindroconoidal) bullets were developed <<around 1825|18:0>>, when it was found that they maintained their speed better in flight. That\'s because for a given weight of lead an elongated, tapered-nose shape meets with less air resistance than a round ball; it\'s streamlined.',

And let's say that when the camera snaps picture number one, the red spoke is pointing straight up, at the <<twelve o'clock|6>> position. Depending on the speed of rotation of the wheel, when picture number two is snapped a twenty-fourth of a second later, the red spoke might happen to be caught in the <<one o'clock|6>> position\x{2014}even if it had made a couple of complete turns in the interim. That makes it look as if it had moved to the right, or clockwise. Or, it might happen to be caught in the <<eleven o'clock|6>> position, making it look as if it had moved to the left, or counterclockwise. As the camera continues to take its 24 pictures per second, the red spoke\x{2014}together with the rest of the wheel\x{2014}will look as if it is moving continuously, either clockwise or counterclockwise.",
