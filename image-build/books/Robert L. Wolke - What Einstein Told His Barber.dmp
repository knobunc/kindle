            'Early bullets were round balls of lead, like miniature cannonballs. Bullet-shaped (Techspeak: cylindroconoidal) bullets were developed <<around 1825|18:0>>, when it was found that they maintained their speed better in flight. That\'s because for a given weight of lead an elongated, tapered-nose shape meets with less air resistance than a round ball; it\'s streamlined.',

And let's say that when the camera snaps picture number one, the red spoke is pointing straight up, at the <<twelve o'clock|6>> position. Depending on the speed of rotation of the wheel, when picture number two is snapped a twenty-fourth of a second later, the red spoke might happen to be caught in the <<one o'clock|6>> position\x{2014}even if it had made a couple of complete turns in the interim. That makes it look as if it had moved to the right, or clockwise. Or, it might happen to be caught in the <<eleven o'clock|6>> position, making it look as if it had moved to the left, or counterclockwise. As the camera continues to take its 24 pictures per second, the red spoke\x{2014}together with the rest of the wheel\x{2014}will look as if it is moving continuously, either clockwise or counterclockwise.",

Divide that number of seconds by 4 to find out roughly how many miles away the lightning was. Or multiply the number of seconds by <<400|3:0>> to get the approximate distance in yards. (But see the Nitpicker's Corner.) You may be shocked\x{2014}sorry, I mean surprised\x{2014}to find how close many of the lightning strikes are.
