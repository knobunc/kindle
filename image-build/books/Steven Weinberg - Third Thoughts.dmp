            "The gnomon is simply a straight pole, set vertically in a flat, horizontal patch of ground open to the Sun\x{2019}s rays. When during each day the gnomon\x{2019}s shadow is shortest, that is <<noon|13>>. At <<noon|13>>, the gnomon\x{2019}s shadow anywhere in the latitude of Greece or Mesopotamia points due north, so all the points of the compass can be permanently and accurately marked out on the ground around the gnomon. Watching the shadow at noon from day to day, one can note the days when the <<noon|13>> shadow is shortest or longest. That is the summer or the winter solstice. From the length of the <<noon|13>> shadow at the summer solstice one can calculate the latitude. The shadow at sunset points somewhat south of east in the spring and summer, and somewhat north of east in the fall and winter; when the shadow at sunset points due east, that is the spring or fall equinox.2",

            "Similarly, in the quantum theory of gravitation, the invariance of the theory under general transformations of spacetime coordinates does not allow any gravitational interactions that are conventionally renormalizable. Quantum gravity too has been treated as an effective field theory. The problem with quantum gravity is not its infinities, but the fact that (as in all effective theories) it loses all predictive power at sufficiently high energies\x{2014}in this case, at what is called the Planck scale, <<about 10|9:0>> MeV, the energy at which gravitation becomes a strong force.",

The lifetime of the W particle (the heavy charged particle responsible for the weak force that allows neutrons to turn into protons in radioactive nuclei) is only <<3.16|5a:0>> \x{d7} 10\x{2212} seconds, not long enough for a W particle traveling near the speed of light to cross the diameter of an atomic nucleus.",

It seems to me even more amazing that our experiments and theories have become sufficiently reliable so that we can now give precise figures, like 13.8 billion years and <<3.16|5a:0>> \x{d7} 10\x{2212} seconds, with some confidence that we know what we are talking about.",

            'Please understand that I am not claiming that the establishment is never wrong. In my own field, the consensus of physicists was wrong about the composition of atomic nuclei until <<1932|9c:0>>; wrong about the perfect symmetry of the laws of nature between right and left until <<1956|9c:0>>; and until 1998 wrong in thinking that the expansion of the universe is slowing down. But these incorrect ideas had been held tentatively, not as dogmas, and when contrary evidence came along professional scientists were able quickly to correct the consensus, using the ordinary methods of science, without the intervention of skeptical outsiders.',
