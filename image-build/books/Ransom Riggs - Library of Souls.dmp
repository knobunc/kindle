            "\x{201c}And biting, as of <<noon|13>> yesterday. Then we buried Deirdre in our little cemetery and I hightailed it for London to find Miss Wren and warn all of you. One of Miss Wren\x{2019}s pigeons led me to her hideaway, and while I was pleased to see that you had arrived before me, unfortunately so had the wights. Their siege had already begun, and I was forced to watch helplessly as they stormed the building, and\x{2014}well, you know the rest. I followed as you were led away to the underground. When that blast went off, I saw an opportunity to aid you and took it.\x{201d}",

            "Anyway, such was the scene in my head when I noticed a small hole in the tarp near my shoulder\x{2014}chewed by rats, no doubt\x{2014}and, shifting a little, I found I could peek through it. Within seconds, the happy, musical-inspired landscape I\x{2019}d imagined melted away like a Salvador Dal\x{ed} painting. The first horror to greet me were the houses that lined the canal, though calling them houses was generous. Nowhere in their sagging and rotted architecture could be found a single straight line. They slouched like a row of exhausted soldiers who\x{2019}d fallen asleep at attention; it seemed the only thing keeping them from tipping straight into the water was the tightness with which they were packed\x{2014}that and the mortar of black-and-green filth that smeared their lower thirds in thick, sludgy strata. On each of their rickety porches a coffinlike box stood on end, but only when I heard a loud grunt issue from <<one|9c:1>> and saw something tumble into the water from beneath it did I realize what they were or that the slapping sounds I\x{2019}d heard earlier hadn\x{2019}t come from oars but from outhouses, which were contributing to the very filth that held them up.",

I volunteered my help around the house. I rose <<long before noon|13>> and hung out in plain view of my watchful parents. I watched TV with them and ran errands and lingered at the table after meals to participate in the inane discussions they liked to have\x{2014}about bathroom remodeling, homeowners\x{2019} association politics, fad diets, birds. (There was never more than a glancing allusion to my grandfather, the island, or my \x{201c}episode.\x{201d}) I was pleasant, kind, patient, and in a hundred ways not quite the son they remembered.
