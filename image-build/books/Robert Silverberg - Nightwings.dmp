            "The messy, chaotic, and ultimately well-nigh apocalyptic year of 1968\x{2014}the year of the Tet offensive and other dismal military events in Vietnam, the year Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. were assassinated, the year when student protesters turned universities all over the world into armed camps, when Soviet troops marched into Prague to snuff out Czech liberty, when the Democratic Party\x{2019}s national convention produced open warfare in the streets of Chicago\x{2014}gave me a private foretaste of the turmoil it was destined to bring when, on a bitterly cold February night, I awakened at <<half past three in the morning|10>> to discover that my house was on fire.",

Her wings unfolded into two broad sheets of gossamer through which I could still see the sunset and the evening lights, blurred, distorted, magical. I sensed the fragrance of her <<midnight|13>> hair. I put my arms to her and embraced her slender, boyish body.',

The beggars lay strewn about, some drugged, some sleeping, most dead; from the crude manner of their death I saw that they must have slain one another in their panic and frenzy. A despondent-looking Indexer squatted beside the three skulls of the interrogation fixture in the chapel. As I entered he said, \x{201c}No use. The brains do not reply.\x{201d}",

As a foolish novice I was at the mercy of pranksters, and many a fellow apprentice, even a guild member or two, led me astray for the sheer wicked joy of it. But I learned which routes to follow, how to set up sequences of questions, how to follow a path of references higher and higher until the truth bursts dazzlingly upon <<one|9c:1>>. With persistence rather than with great intellect I wrung from the files of the Rememberers a coherent tale of the downfall of man.",
