At the end of the week the garbage can was full\x{2014}whereupon the worst assortment of evil entities in the Sol System drove up in a huge truck and stole the food. Snooper knew which day of the week this happened on; it was always on Friday. So <<about five A.M.|9h>> on Friday, Snooper would emit his first bark. My wife and I figured that was about the time the garbagemen\x{2019}s alarm clocks were going off. Snooper knew when they left their houses. He could hear them. He was the only one who knew; everybody else ignored what was afoot. Snooper must have thought he inhabited a planet of lunatics. His owners, and everyone else in Berkeley, could hear the garbagemen coming, but no one did anything. His barking drove me out of my mind every week, but I was more fascinated by Snooper\x{2019}s logic than I was annoyed by his frantic efforts to rouse us.
