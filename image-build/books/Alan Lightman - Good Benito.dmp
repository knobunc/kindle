Bennett quickly thrusts the book through the crack in the door, into her hand. She looks at it. Her frown softens. May I come back? he blurts out. She hesitates, looks again at the book, then at Bennett. A man\'s voice, baritone and distant, floats from a neighboring house. Try next Thursday, <<after ten in the evening|9h>>, she says and shuts the door. Bennett strides happily around the half-gate and spends an hour walking through the cobblestone streets. On some impulse, he buys a green crystal thimble.',

It is <<one in the morning|5>>, but he is not tired. He gains strength from himself. He does not need to go to the library, he does not need to ask other students or grown-ups for information or help. He can be here alone, in his room, with the beautiful mathematics and the moon and figure things out on his own. He can sit here naked at his oak desk with the clean, white paper and work in the absolute certainty and the solitude and perfection. Gliding through the world in his mind, he doesn\'t worry about his small height or his pimples or his problems with talking or his confusion at what people say. It is a world without bodies. It is a world of clear logic and grace. It is the best part of loneliness, without the sadness.',
