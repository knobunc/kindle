            "Most of the Europeans who travelled south at this time were Frenchmen and Italians hoping to get rich in the ivory trade. Instead, the majority died of malaria. More successful was a determined Maltese trader, technically a British subject. By <<1851|9:0>> the moustachioed, cane-carrying Andrea De Bono employed 400 men as porters and boatmen in his ivory company. Occasionally he would capture a lion and sell it to a zoo or menagerie. De Bono\x{2019}s enemies swore that he and his nephew bought and sold human beings as well as exotic animals. At this time, De Bono moved his headquarters south from the slaving town of Khartoum to distant Gondokoro, described by one traveller as \x{2018}that Babylon of prostitution\x{2019}. From this stinking, rat-infested string of slave and ivory camps beside the Nile, De Bono, and his friends and business partners, launched themselves up the river. But a combination of cerebral malaria, cataracts and hostile Africans defeated them. In 1853, while Richard Burton was writing his book in Cairo, entirely unknown to him De Bono travelled up the Nile once again and passed through the land of the Bari and the Obbo to within eighty miles of Lake Albert. A few years later, Jules Verne would pay tribute to the Maltese trader\x{2019}s achievement in his adventure novel, Five Weeks in a Balloon, by having one of his characters look down through binoculars and spot De Bono\x{2019}s initials, which he had carved on a rock on an island, near Fola Rapids. \x{2018}It is the signature of the traveller who has gone farthest up the course of the Nile!\x{2019} Although other attempts were soon made \x{2013} several ending tragically \x{2013} De Bono\x{2019}s most southerly point would not be bettered until <<1860|18:0>> when the extraordinary Italian polymath, Giovanni Miani \x{2013} who had written operas and been a professional wood carver before starting to trade in ivory \x{2013} struggled as far south as modern Nimule, near the present Ugandan border, before being forced back by illness and an attack by Madi tribesmen. Miani would die in 1872, aged sixty-one, still trading on the upper Nile and its tributaries. His last written words were: \x{2018}Adieu so many great hopes: the dreams of my life.\x{2019} Since De Bono and Miani did not know precisely how close they had been to making significant discoveries, the world would remain ignorant of their achievements.",

Herne was sent out into the darkness to investigate and darted back into the tent having fired a few shots at the advancing attackers with his Colt. In his separate tent, Speke heard Burton calling to Stroyan to get up, and he also heard shots, but at first he thought these were being fired at imaginary intruders by trigger-happy sentries. But hearing footsteps immediately outside, he leapt from his bed and sprinted to Burton\x{2019}s tent.

            "Having made this brave admission, Burton was to prove incapable of ever making it again, and he compounded the dishonesty of keeping his true beliefs to himself by embarking on a long and increasingly vindictive campaign to discredit Speke. His justification was that hitting back was the only natural response to Speke\x{2019}s treachery. Burton\x{2019}s accusation, which has damned Speke\x{2019}s reputation ever since, was that he betrayed his erstwhile leader on his return to England \x{2013} by going to the RGS alone, having promised only to go there with Burton. It was in this underhand way, said Burton, that Speke cut him out and gained for himself sole command of the next Nile expedition. This notion, that Speke behaved in a totally unprincipled way, has been believed, and repeated, by <<five|9:0>> out of six of Burton\x{2019}s most recent biographers, and also by the author of Speke\x{2019}s only biography.

He lived surrounded by his wives and by <<300|3:0>> slaves and servants, most of them Tutsis from Rwanda, who tended his orchards, vegetable gardens and his herd of cattle, besides acting as porters on his ivory trading expeditions. According to Musa, all would be well when the explorers reached the court of his friend King Rumanika of Karagwe. But this monarch was 300 miles away to the north and the territory of numerous chiefs would have to be crossed en route. Whether Speke would be able to keep his porters with him and pay the dues demanded by these African petty-rulers was a question he was in no position to answer. He had been warned that he would never get through Usui since Chief Suwarora was so extortionate in his demands that he would \x{2018}tear him to pieces\x{2019}.",

Davis, who was 200 yards ahead, saw Speke up on the wall, and the next moment heard his gun go off. Fuller, who was considerably closer, spun round as the shot rang out, and saw his cousin tumble forwards into the field with no gun in his hand. The Lancaster breech-loader had fallen from his fingers the moment it went off, and had clattered down the side of the wall into the field he had just left. The unguarded trigger of one of the barrels seemed to have been snagged by a sapling, sending its contents into Speke\x{2019}s left side below the armpit.

But, on 10 February, the Englishman and his party at last arrived at Shaguzi, and a man whom Baker took to be Kamrasi, accompanied by <<500|3:0>> warriors, came to see him. This royal visitation was due to the fact that Baker \x{2013} like Florence \x{2013} was too ill to walk. Later, he was carried to the royal hut where he presented the supposed omukama with some presents, including a large Persian carpet, a pair of red Turkish shoes, some necklaces and a double-barrelled gun.

Baker brushed aside this warning, and ignoring the immense danger that he and Florence would face without quinine, renewed his pleas to be permitted to set out. Baker explained that the Nile flowed northwards for an immense distance, passing through many countries from which valuable articles could be sent to Kamrasi, if he would only allow his English visitor to travel to the Luta N\x{2019}zige.",
