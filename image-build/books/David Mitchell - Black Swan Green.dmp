The fire-control crews were soon overwhelmed, and in a matter of minutes the Coventry was listing badly to port.

            "\x{201c}By now\x{201d}\x{2014}Mr. Nixon coughed to clear his throat\x{2014}\x{201c}you are all doubtless aware that Thomas Yew, an old boy of our school, has, in the last twenty-four hours, been killed in the conflict over the Falkland Islands.\x{201d} (Our headmaster was right, we all knew. Norman Bates, the school bus driver, had Radio Wyvern on and Tom Yew\x{2019}s name was on that.) \x{201c}Thomas was not the most studious boy ever to grace the classrooms of our school, nor the most obedient. Indeed, my register of crimes and punishments informs me I was obliged to administer the slipper on no less than four occasions. But neither Thomas nor myself are\x{201d}\x{2014}bleak silence\x{2014}\x{201c}were\x{201d}\x{2014}another one\x{2014}\x{201c}the type of man to bear a grudge. When the Royal Navy\x{2019}s recruitment officer approached me for a character reference regarding Thomas, I felt able to recommend this spirited young man, unreservedly and unconditionally. Thomas returned the courtesy some months later, by inviting my wife and myself to his passing-out ceremony in Portsmouth some months later. Rarely have\x{201d}\x{2014}a flutter of amazement that anyone\x{2019}d ever married Mr. Nixon swept round the hall. One glare from Mr. Nixon and the flutter dropped dead\x{2014}\x{201c}rarely have I accepted an invitation to an official function with such pleasure, and such personal pride. Thomas had clearly flourished under military discipline. He had matured into a worthy ambassador for our school and a credit to Her Majesty\x{2019}s Forces. This is why the grief I feel this morning, upon learning of his death\x{201d}\x{2014}surely that wasn\x{2019}t a crack in Nixon\x{2019}s voice?\x{2014}\x{201c}aboard HMS Coventry is as bitter as it is heartfelt. The mood of depression both in the staff room and in this hall tell me that this grief is shared by all of us.\x{201d} (Mr. Nixon took off his glasses and for a moment he looked not like an SS commandant but just somebody\x{2019}s tired dad.) \x{201c}I will be sending a telegram of condolence to Thomas\x{2019}s family after assembly, on behalf of the school. I hope that those of you who are close to the Yews will lend them your support. Life can inflict few cruelties\x{2014}perhaps no cruelty\x{2014}more acute than the death of a son\x{2014}or brother. However, I also hope that you will give Thomas\x{2019}s family sufficient space in which to grieve.\x{201d} (A few of the third-year girls were weeping now. Mr. Nixon looked in their direction, but he\x{2019}d turned his Death Ray off. He said nothing for five, ten, fifteen seconds. A bit of shuffling started. <<Twenty|9k:0>>, <<twenty-five|9k:0>>, thirty seconds. I intercepted a look from Miss Ronkswood to Miss Wyche that said, Is he okay? Miss Wyche shrugged, very slightly.) \x{201c}I hope,\x{201d} Mr. Nixon finally went on, \x{201c}that, as you consider Thomas\x{2019}s sacrifice, you will think about the consequences of violence, be it military or emotional. I hope you will note who initiates violence, who conducts the violence, and who must pay the price of violence. Wars do not simply appear from nowhere. Wars come, over a long period of time, and believe me, there is always plenty of blame to be shared out between all those who failed to prevent its bloody arrival. I also hope you will consider what is truly precious in your own lives, and what is merely\x{2026}flimflam\x{2026}grandstanding\x{2026}froth\x{2026}posturing\x{2026}egotism.\x{201d} Our headmaster looked spent. \x{201c}That is all.\x{201d} Mr. Nixon nodded at Mr. Kempsey at the piano. Mr. Kempsey told us to turn to the hymn that goes, Oh hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. We all stood up and sang it for Tom Yew.",

Two men loading a photocopier onto the truck told her the firm\x{2019}d gone bankrupt. So the rockery rocks stayed on our driveway for two more weeks, until Mr. Broadwas got back from his holiday in Ilfracombe. Mr. Broadwas does some gardening work for my parents.

Out of the cab got Mr. Broadwas, and his sons Gordon and Keith. Mr. Broadwas\x{2019}s son-in-law Doug drove the forklift truck. First, Dad and Doug took down the side gate so the machine could lug the granite to the back. Next, we all got stuck in digging the hole for the pond. Hot and sweaty work, it was. Mum sort of hovered in the shade, but men with spades put up an invisible wall. She brought a tray of coffee and Dutch butter biscuits. Everyone thanked Mum politely and Mum said, \x{201c}You\x{2019}re welcome\x{201d} politely too. Dad sent me to Mr. Rhydd\x{2019}s on my bike to get 7UP and Mars bars. (Mr. Rhydd told me it was the hottest day of 1982 so far.) When I got back me and Gordon carted the buckets of topsoil to the end of the garden. I didn\x{2019}t know what to say to Gordon Broadwas. Gordon\x{2019}s in my year at school (in a dimmer\x{2019}s class) and here was my dad paying his dad. How embarrassing\x{2019}s that? Gordon didn\x{2019}t speak much either, so maybe he felt embarrassed too. Mum was looking stonier and stonier as the rockery in the garden and the rockery in her blueprint got more and more different. After the pond\x{2019}s shell was lowered and we stopped for toasted sandwiches, Mum announced she was going into Tewkesbury to do some shopping. As her car pulled out and we got back to work, Dad did a jokey sigh. \x{201c}Women, eh? Banging on about this rockery for years, and now it\x{2019}s off to the shops\x{2026}\x{201d}",

Literally, I could no longer hear myself think. Now. I am not concerned about the identity of the ringleader. I do not care who roared, who hummed, who remained mute. What I care about is that Mr. McNamara, a guest in our school, will report to his peers\x{2014}with just cause\x{2014}that I am the headmaster of a zoo of hooligans. For this affront to my reputation, I shall punish every one of you.\x{201d} Mr. Nixon lifted his chin one quarter inch. We flinched. \x{201c}\x{2018}Please, Mr. Nixon! I didn\x{2019}t join in! It\x{2019}s not fair if you punish me!\x{2019}\x{201d} He dared anyone to agree, but nobody was stupid enough. \x{201c}Oh, but I am not paid my stratospheric salary to be fair. I am paid my stratospheric salary to uphold standards. Standards which you\x{201d}\x{2014}he knit his hands together and cracked the knuckles, sickeningly\x{2014}\x{201c}just trampled into the dirt. In a more enlightened age, a sound thrashing would have taught you a sense of decorum. But as our masters at Westminster have deprived us of this tool, other, more onerous techniques must be found.\x{201d} Mr. Nixon reached the door. \x{201c}The Old Gym. A <<quarter past twelve|10>>. Latecomers will receive a week\x{2019}s detention. Absentees will be expelled. That is all.\x{201d}",

Weren\x{2019}t red-haired, weren\x{2019}t polit\x{2019}cal, he just liked the sound of it. Red Rex was the Goose Fair\x{2019}s fighter. The bones o\x{2019} more than forty years ago, this\x{2019}d be. Things was rougher an\x{2019} leaner back then. My family\x{2019}d follow Mercy Watt\x{2019}s old man gaff-catchin\x{2019} round the Vale of Evesham, down the Severn Valley, tradin\x{2019} horses with other Romanies an\x{2019} farmers an\x{2019} breeders an\x{2019} that. Usually a bit o\x{2019} money floatin\x{2019} round the fairs, so the men\x{2019}d feel flush \x{2019}nough for a punt or two on a fight. A nearby barn\x{2019}d be found, lookouts posted for gavvas if we couldn\x{2019}t pay \x{2019}em off, an\x{2019} my dad\x{2019}d challenge all comers. Dad weren\x{2019}t the beefiest of his six brothers, but that was why, see, men\x{2019}d bet stupid vonga, wads of it, on deckin\x{2019} him or on gettin\x{2019} first blood. Dad weren\x{2019}t much to look at. But I\x{2019}m tellin\x{2019} yer, Red Rex soaked up punches like a boulder! Slipp\x{2019}rier than shit through a goose. No gloves in them days, mind! Bare-knuckle fightin\x{2019}, it were. My first memories was of watchin\x{2019} Dad fight. These days those prizefighters\x{2019}d be professional heavyweights or riot police or somethin\x{2019}, but times was diff\x{2019}rent. Now, one winter\x{201d}\x{2014}fresh screams from the Flying Tea Cups ride drowned Clem Ostler out for a moment\x{2014}\x{201c}one winter, word reached us \x{2019}bout this gigantic Welsh bastard. Monster of a man, serious, six foot eight, <<six-nine|9j>>, from Anglesey. That was his name in all. Say \x{2018}Anglesey\x{2019} that year, an\x{2019} everyone\x{2019}d knew who yer meant. Fightin\x{2019} his way east, they said, rakin\x{2019} it in, just by smashin\x{2019} prizefighters\x{2019} skulls to eggshells. One blacksmith, name of McMahon, in Cheshire, died after half a round with Anglesey. \x{2019}Nother needed iron plates put in his skull, three or four climbed into the ring fit men an\x{2019} were carried out cripples for life. Anglesey\x{2019}d been mouthin\x{2019} on how he\x{2019}d hunt down Red Rex at the Goose Fair, right here, in Black Swan Green. Pulp him, skin him, string him up, smoke him, sell him to the pig farmers. Sure \x{2019}nough, when we got to our old atchin\x{2019}-sen down Pig Lane, Anglesey\x{2019}s people was there. Wouldn\x{2019}t budge till after the fight. Twenty guineas was the prize money! Last man standin\x{2019}d scoop the lot. Unheard of, back then, that sort o\x{2019}money.\x{201d}",

            "\x{201c}Locomotion\x{201d} got all the girls doing this choo-choo dance in a snaky line. Then there was \x{201c}Oops Upside Your Head,\x{201d} which\x{2019}s got a sort of rowing-boat dance to it. It\x{2019}s not a dance for boys. \x{201c}House of Fun\x{201d} by Madness is, though. \x{201c}House of Fun\x{201d} is about buying condoms but the BBC didn\x{2019}t ban it soon enough \x{2019}cause the BBC only spots secret meanings weeks after the dimmest duh-brain in Duffershire\x{2019}s got it. Squelch did this electrocuted dance that more kids copied to take the piss at first, but actually it worked. (There\x{2019}s a Squelch hiding in all great inventors.) Then \x{201c}Once in a Lifetime\x{201d} by Talking Heads came on. That was the crucial song that made it more bonzoish not to dance than to dance, so now me and Dean and Floyd did. The D.J. switched the strobe light on. Only for short bursts, \x{2019}cause strobes make your brain blow up. Dancing\x{2019}s like walking down a busy high street or millions of other things. You\x{2019}re absolutely fine as long as you don\x{2019}t think about it. During the strobe storm, through a stormy night forest of necks and arms, I saw Holly Deblin. Holly Deblin\x{2019}s got a sort of Indian goddess dance, swaying but sort of flicking her hands. Holly Deblin might\x{2019}ve seen me through her stormy night forest, \x{2019}cause she might\x{2019}ve smiled. (Might isn\x{2019}t as good as did but it\x{2019}s miles better than didn\x{2019}t.) Next was \x{201c}I Feel Love\x{201d} by Donna Summer. John Tookey showed off this new New York craze called break dancing but went spinning out of control into a group of girls, who toppled like skittles. John Tookey had to be rescued by his mates from stabbing female heels. During Bryan Ferry\x{2019}s \x{201c}Jealous Guy\x{201d} Lee Biggs got off with Angela Bullock. They snogged in the corner and Duncan Priest stood right by them and did his imitation of a cow giving birth. But the laughers were envious too. Angela Bullock wears black bras. Then, during \x{201c}To Cut a Long Story Short\x{201d} by Spandau Ballet, Alastair Nurton got off with Tracey Impney, this giant goth from Brotheridge Green. Gary Numan and Tubeway Army\x{2019}s \x{201c}Are \x{2018}Friends\x{2019} Electric?\x{201d} came on and Colin Pole and Mark Badbury did this glazed robot dance. \x{201c}This song\x{2019}s ace!\x{201d} Dean yelled in my ear. \x{201c}It\x{2019}s so futuristic. Gary Numan\x{2019}s got a friend named \x{2018}<<Five|9k:0>>\x{2019}! Is that brill or what?\x{201d} Dancing\x{2019}s a brain the dancers\x{2019}re only cells of. Dancers think they\x{2019}re in charge but they\x{2019}re obeying ancient orders. \x{201c}Three Times a Lady\x{201d} by the Commodores cleared the floor \x{2019}cept for boyfriends and girlfriends who smooched, enjoying being looked at, and snoggers who just snogged and forgot they were being looked at. Second choices were going for the third choices now. Paul White got off with Lucy Sneads. Next on was \x{201c}Come on Eileen\x{201d} by Dexy\x{2019}s <<Midnight|13>> Runners. A disco\x{2019}s a zoo too. Some of the animals\x{2019}re wilder than they are by day, some funnier, some posier, some shyer, some sexier. Holly Deblin\x{2019}d obviously gone home.",
