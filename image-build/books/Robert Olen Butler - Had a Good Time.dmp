This was <<about ten in the morning|9h>>, though I shouldn\x{2019}t sneer because even Papa started early some days. So I knock on his door, which is slightly open, and he calls for me to come in. I push the door and step into the place, a regular cut-velvet and leather sitting room. It smells strong of cigar smoke. He\x{2019}s left one lit on a saucer on the reading table. The gentleman himself is hanging out the open lower sash like the women in the tenements.",
