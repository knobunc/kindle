The explosion blasted a hundred-foot-wide cavity through six stories of steel-reinforced concrete and created a seismic shock wave felt more than a mile away. Although more than a thousand New Yorkers were injured, only six people (who had the bad luck to be eating lunch in a cafeteria directly above the blast) were killed.

When it was his turn to step up, Pat Tillman gave up a lucrative NFL career, served his country and paid the ultimate sacrifice. Now you have a chance to pledge to the family that your government, your administration will finally get to the bottom of it. Can you make that pledge to the family today, that you\x{2019}ll finally, <<after seven|9:1>> investigations, find out what really happened?BUSH: Well, first of all, I can understand why Pat Tillman\x{2019}s family, you know, has got significant emotions, because a man they loved and respected was killed while he was serving his country. I always admired the fact that a person who was relatively comfortable in life would be willing to take off one uniform and put on another to defend America. And the best way to honor that commitment of his is to find out the truth. And I\x{2019}m confident the Defense Department wants to find out the truth, too, and we\x{2019}ll lay it out for the Tillman family to know.HENRY: But, Mr. President, there have been seven investigations and the Pentagon has not gotten to the bottom of it. Can you also tell us when you, personally, found out that it was not enemy fire, that it was friendly fire?BUSH: I can\x{2019}t give you the precise moment. But obviously the minute I heard that the facts that people believed were true were not true, that I expect there to be a full investigation and get to the bottom of it.The president neglected to mention that three months earlier, as part of the investigation launched by Congress to finally and definitively \x{201c}get to the bottom of it,\x{201d} Representative Waxman had sent a letter to the White House formally requesting \x{201c}all documents received or generated by any official in the Executive Office of the President, including the Communications Office and Office of Speechwriting\x{a0}\x{2026}\x{a0}that relate to Corporal Tillman,\x{201d} and sent a similar request to the Department of Defense.
