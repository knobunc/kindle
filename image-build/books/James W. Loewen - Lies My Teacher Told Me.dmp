        Historically, social class is intertwined with all kinds of events and processes in our 
        past. Our governing system was established by rich men, following theories that 
        emphasized government as a bulwark of the propertied class. Although rich himself, James 
        Madison worried about social inequality and wrote The Federalist #10 to explain how the proposed government would not succumb to the influence of the affluent. 
        Madison did not fully succeed, according to Edward Pessen, who examined the social-class backgrounds of all American presidents 
        through Reagan. Pessen found that more than 40 percent hailed from the upper class, mostly 
        from the upper fringes of that elite group, and another 15 percent originated in families 
        located between the upper and upper-middle classes. More than 25 percent came from a solid 
        upper-middle-class background, leaving just six presidents, or 15 percent, to come from 
        the middle and lowermiddle classes and just one, Andrew Johnson, representing any part 
        of the lower class. For good reason, Pessen titled his book The Log, Cabin Myth111 While it was sad when the great ship Titanic went down, as the old song refrain goes, it was saddest for the lower classes: among 
        women, only 4 of 143 first-class passengers were lost, while 15 of 93 second-class 
        passengers drowned, along with 81 of 179 third-class women and girls. The crew ordered 
        third-class passengers to remain below deck, holding some of them there at gunpoint.17 More recently,",

            "Simply to list these questions is to recognize that each of them is still controversial. 
        Take the first. Some people still argue that the United States fought in Vietnam to secure 
        access to the country's valuable natural resources. Others claim that we fought to bring 
        democracy to Vietnam's people. Perhaps more common are analyses of our internal politics: 
        Democratic Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, having seen how Republicans castigated Truman 
        for \x{201c}losing\x{201d} China, did not want to be seen as \x{201c}losing\x{201d} Vietnam. Another interpretation 
        brings forth the domino theory: while we know now that Vietnam's communists are 
        antagonists of China, we didn't then, and some leaders believed that if Vietnam \x{201c}fell\x{201d} to 
        the communists, so would Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Yet another 
        view is that America felt its prestige was on the line, so it did not want a defeat in 
        Vietnam, lest Pax Americana be threatened in Africa, South America, or elsewhere in the 
        world.\x{201c} Some conspiracy theorists go even further and claim that big business fomented the 
        war to help the economy. Other historians take a longer view, arguing that our 
        intervention in Vietnam derives from a cultural pattern of racism and imperialism that 
        began with the first Indian war in Virginia in 1622, continued in the nineteenth century with \x{201d}Manifest Destiny,\x{201c} and is now winding down in 
        the \x{201d}American century.\" They point out that GI's in Vietnam collected and displayed 
        Vietnamese ears just as British colonists in North America collected and displayed Indian 
        scalps.23 A final view might be that there was no clear cause and certainly no clear purpose, that 
        we blundered into the war because no subsequent administration had the courage to undo 
        our 1946 mistake of opposing a popular independence movement. \x{201c}The fundamental blunder with respect to Indochina was made <<after 1945|18:0>>,\x{201d} 
        wrote Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, when \x{201c}our Government allowed itself to be

        encounter of European and Indian societies, the clash of cultures that was to echo down 
        through five centuries.\x{201d}69 The seeds of that fivecentury battle were sown in Haiti between 1493 and 1500. These are 
        not mere details that our textbooks omit. They are facts crucial to understanding American and 
        European history. Capt. John Smith, for example, used Columbus as a role model in 
        proposing a get-tough policy for the Virginia Indians in 1624: \x{201c}The manner how to suppress 
        them is so often related and approved, I omit it here: And you have twenty examples of the 
        Spaniards how they got the West Indies, and forced the treacherous and rebellious infidels 
        to do all manner of drudgery work and slavery for them, themselves living like soldiers 
        upon the fruits of their labors.\x{201d}70 The methods unleashed by Columbus are, in fact, the larger part of his legacy. After all, 
        they worked. The island was so well pacified that Spanish convicts, given a second chance 
        on Haiti, could \x{201c}go anywhere, take any woman or girl, take anything, and have the Indians 
        carry him on their backs as if they were mules.\x{201d}71 In 1499, when Columbus finally found gold on Haiti in significant amounts, Spain became 
        the envy of Europe. <<After 1500|9n:0>> Portugal, France, Holland, and Britain joined in 
        conquering the Americas. These nations were at least as brutal as Spain. The British, for 
        example, unlike the Spanish, did not colonize by making use of Indian labor but simply 
        forced the Indians out of the way. Many Indians fled British colonies to Spanish 
        territories (Florida, Mexico) in search of more humane treatment.",

        fact that wherever Europeans went in the Americas, they projected monarchs (\x{201c}King
