I had always considered Jack one of the smartest agents I had ever met\x{2014}and possibly one of the scariest (the smart ones are always the most terrifying). He has a slow and measured voice that articulates words so that they rise, dip, and then rise again. It\x{2019}s a mesmerizing pattern of speaking, and it causes you to hang on every word as if its formed from a complete story arc, with a beginning, middle, and end. I\x{2019}ve never met a man with more experience eating at restaurants around the world. You can tell Jack that you\x{2019}ll be going to any city on the planet (say, Catolica, Italy), and he\x{2019}ll proceed to tell you the best restaurant to dine at, how to get there, and the name of the owner. For example, Catolica, Italy: \x{201c}Roger, there\x{2019}s a little bistro off the main Rambla, on a crooked street that leads toward the basilica, just across from the butcher, but there\x{2019}s no sign out in front. Look for the red door. If you go there between <<nine P.M.|5>> and <<eleven P.M.|5>>, on Thursday through Saturday, let yourself in and ask for Martina. Be sure to have the gnocchi\x{2014}it\x{2019}s unparalleled.\x{201d} If you ever meet Jack Rapke, pick a random city and ask him where to eat. He won\x{2019}t disappoint you.",
