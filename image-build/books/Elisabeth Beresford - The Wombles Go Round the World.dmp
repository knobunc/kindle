But they were, so to speak, invisible. This was because Great Uncle Bulgaria had set his alarm clock for <<5.30 a.m.|2a>> exactly. By <<5.38|9:1>> he had realised what was happening and had given everyone a short sharp whispered lecture, in which he said that Tobermory might feel a bit shy about trying out his latest invention, if he knew that he had a large audience.',
