His mother did not cry out as she bore him, since she was a soldier\x{2019}s wife, and a soldier\x{2019}s mother, now. He was named for his great-uncle, killed on duty in the Sosa.

His father, when he was on leave, taught him the arts a soldier must know; when his father was on duty the old Asset-Sergeant Habbakam took over the lessons, which began at <<five in the morning|5>>, summer or winter, with worship, shortsword practice, and a cross-country run. His mother and grandmother taught him the other arts a man must know, beginning with good manners before he was two, and after his second birthday going on to history, poetry, and sitting still without talking.",
