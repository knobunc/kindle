But a new front in the war over Mississippi had opened <<after 1945|18:0>>, when African American soldiers returned from Europe and the Pacific. Into these renewed hostilities the Supreme Court dropped its Brown v. Board of Education bombshell.

The white men carried out their brutal errand in an atmosphere created by the Citizens\x{2019} Councils, the Ku Klux Klan, and the mass of white public opinion, all of which demanded that African Americans remain the subservient mudsill of Mississippi\x{2014}or die.

His grandfather died at <<104|9c:0>>, dividing the land among his seven children, who promptly lost it all in the Great Depression. Amzie\x{2019}s mother passed away when he was still a boy, \x{201c}so my father came and picked up the two smaller children and at about fourteen I was on my own.\x{201d} The abandoned youth lived hand to mouth, depending on various relatives and teachers, and was often hungry. He nevertheless graduated from high school in 1929, a rarity among his generation of African Americans in Mississippi. In 1935 the heavyset, round-shouldered Moore got a job as a janitor with the U.S. Postal Service and moved to nearby Cleveland, Mississippi. For a black man of his time this was an excellent job, and he kept it for more than thirty years. He also scrambled to make money as an entrepreneur.",

            "Until he left Mississippi in late 1955, Dr. Theodore Roosevelt Mason Howard felt sure that his name topped the Citizens\x{2019} Council \x{201c}death list\x{201d} on which the names of his late friends George Lee and Lamar Smith had once appeared. So he kept a .357 Magnum revolver on one bedside table and a .45 semiautomatic on the other and a Thompson submachine gun at the foot of his bed. A rifle or shotgun stood in all four corners of the bedroom and in every other room in the house. His large and well-appointed home and outbuildings would be more properly called a compound; the driveway featured a guardhouse in which armed men sat twenty-four hours a day. He was not a violent man, but he intended to sleep in peace on his own property. That is why, when an African American farm worker named Frank Young showed up at the gate at <<midnight|3b>> on the eve of the Till murder trial, the guards were reluctant to wake Howard up. But Young insisted that he had an important story to tell about Till\x{2019}s murder and refused to talk with anyone but Dr. Howard.",

Many of the black reporters were already at the house, including Hicks, Simeon Booker, and Robert M. Ratcliffe of the Pittsburgh Courier. Howard almost certainly called Hurley, Evers, and Moore as well. All day and all night that Monday, while the court selected a jury, Howard and his crew looked for the witnesses who could confirm Young\x{2019}s story and Hicks\x{2019}s suspicions. The four they found agreed to come to Howard\x{2019}s house the next evening to relate what they had seen. These evidential gold mines promised not only to provide eyewitness testimony linking the defendants to the murder but also to change the legal jurisdiction from Tallahatchie to Sunflower County. Such a move probably provided the best opportunity civil rights advocates had for disrupting the script of acquittals already unfolding in Sumner.",
