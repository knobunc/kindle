            "All of these agencies have long had to wrestle with the choice of whether to use newly discovered vulnerabilities to protect or to attack. Inside the NSA, this was traditionally known as the \x{201c}equities issue,\x{201d} and the debate was between the COMSEC (communications security) side of the NSA and the SIGINT (signals intelligence) side. If they found a flaw in a popular cryptographic algorithm, they could either use that knowledge to fix the algorithm and make everyone's communications more secure, or they could exploit the flaw to eavesdrop on others\x{2014}while at the same time allowing even the people they wanted to protect to remain vulnerable. This debate raged through the decades inside the NSA. From what I've heard, by <<2000|9n:0>>, the COMSEC side had largely won, but things flipped completely around after 9/11.",

We know quite a bit about the NSA\'s ECHELON program from a 2000 European investigation, and about the DHS\'s plans for Total Information Awareness from <<2002|9c:0>>, but much less about how these programs have evolved. We can make inferences about the NSA\'s Utah facility based on the theoretical amount of data from various sources, the cost of computation, and the power requirements from the facility, but those are rough guesses at best. For a lot of this, we\'re completely in the dark.',
