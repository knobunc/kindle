We know quite a bit about the NSA\'s ECHELON program from a 2000 European investigation, and about the DHS\'s plans for Total Information Awareness from <<2002|9c:0>>, but much less about how these programs have evolved. We can make inferences about the NSA\'s Utah facility based on the theoretical amount of data from various sources, the cost of computation, and the power requirements from the facility, but those are rough guesses at best. For a lot of this, we\'re completely in the dark.',
