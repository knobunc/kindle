            '[12:00] Jeeves in the Offing - P. G. Wodehouse.epub (index_split_002.html) - mid-day',
            "Jeeves placed the sizzling eggs and b. on the breakfast table, and Reginald ('Kipper') Herring and I, licking the lips, squared our elbows and got down to it. A lifelong buddy of mine, this Herring, linked to me by what are called imperishable memories. Years ago, when striplings, he and I had done a stretch together at Malvern House, Bramley-on-Sea, the preparatory school conducted by that prince of stinkers, Aubrey Upjohn MA, and had frequently stood side by side in the Upjohn study awaiting the receipt of six of the juiciest from a cane of the type that biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder, as the fellow said. So we were, you might say, rather like a couple of old sweats who had fought shoulder to shoulder on Crispin's Day, if I've got the name right. \x{a0}\x{a0} The plat du jour having gone down the hatch, accompanied by some fluid ounces of strengthening coffee, I was about to reach for the marmalade, when I heard the telephone tootling out in the hall and rose to attend to it. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Bertram Wooster's residence, 'I said, having connected with the instrument. 'Wooster in person at this end. Oh hullo, ' I added, for the voice that boomed over the wire was that of Mrs Thomas Portarlington Travers of Brinkley Court, Market Snodsbury, near Droitwich - or, putting it another way, my good and deserving Aunt Dahlia. 'A very hearty pip-pip to you, old ancestor, ' I said, well pleased, for she is a woman with whom it is always a privilege to chew the fat. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And a rousing toodle-oo to you, you young blot on the landscape,' she replied cordially. 'I'm surprised to find you up as early as this. Or have you just got in from a night on the tiles?' \x{a0}\x{a0} I hastened to rebut this slur. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Certainly not. Nothing of that description whatsoever. I've been upping with the lark this last week, to keep Kipper Herring company. He's staying with me till he can get into his new flat. You remember old Kipper? I brought him down to Brinkley one summer. Chap with a cauliflower ear.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I know who you mean. Looks like Jack Dempsey.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That's right. Far more, indeed, than Jack Dempsey does. He's on the staff of the Thursday Review, a periodical of which you may or may not be a reader, and has to clock in at the office at daybreak. No doubt, when I apprise him of your call, he will send you his love, for I know he holds you in high esteem. The perfect hostess, he often describes you as. Well, it's nice to hear your voice again, old flesh-and-blood. How's everything down Market Snodsbury way?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, we're jogging along. But I'm not speaking from Brinkley. I'm in London.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Till when?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Driving back this afternoon.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I'll give you lunch.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Sorry, can't manage it. I'm putting on the nosebag with Sir Roderick Glossop.' \x{a0}\x{a0} This surprised me. The eminent brain specialist to whom she alluded was a man I would not have cared to lunch with myself, our relations having been on the stiff side since the night at Lady Wickham's place in Hertfordshire when, acting on the advice of my hostess's daughter Roberta, I had punctured his hot-water bottle with a darning needle in the small hours of the morning. Quite unintentional, of course. I had planned to puncture the h-w-b of his nephew Tuppy Glossop, with whom I had a feud on, and unknown to me they had changed rooms, fust one of those unfortunate misunderstandings. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What on earth are you doing that for?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Why shouldn't I? He's paying.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I saw her point - a penny saved is a penny earned and all that sort of thing - but I continued surprised. It amazed me that Aunt Dahlia, presumably a free agent, should have selected this very formidable loony-doctor to chew the <<mid-day|13>> chop with. However, one of the first lessons life teaches us is that aunts will be aunts, so I merely shrugged a couple of shoulders. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, it's up to you, of course, but it seems a rash act. Did you come to London just to revel with Glossop?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, I'm here to collect my new butler and take him home with me.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'New butler? What's become of Seppings?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He's gone.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I clicked the tongue. I was very fond of the major-domo in question, having enjoyed many a port in his pantry, and this news saddened me. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, really?' I said. 'Too bad. I thought he looked a little frail when I last saw him. Well, that's how it goes. All flesh is grass, I often say.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'To Bognor Regis, for his holiday.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I unclicked the tongue. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, I see. That puts a different complexion on the matter. Odd how all these pillars of the home seem to be dashing away on toots these days. It's like what Jeeves was telling me about the great race movements of the Middle Ages. Jeeves starts his holiday this morning. He's off to Herne Bay for the shrimping, and I'm feeling like that bird in the poem who lost his pet gazelle or whatever the animal was. I don't know what I'm going to do without him.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I'll tell you what you're going to do. Have you a clean shirt?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Several.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And a toothbrush?' \x{a0}\x{a0} '<<Two|9k:0>>, both of the finest quality.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Then pack them. You're coming to Brinkley tomorrow.' \x{a0}\x{a0} The gloom which always envelops Bertram Wooster like a fog when Jeeves is about to take his annual vacation lightened perceptibly. There are few things I find more agreeable than a sojourn at Aunt Dahlia's rural lair. Picturesque scenery, gravel soil, main drainage, company's own water and, above all, the superb French cheffing of her French chef Anatole, God's gift to the gastric juices. A full hand, as you might put it. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What an admirable suggestion,' I said. 'You solve all my problems and bring the blue bird out of a hat. Rely on me. You will observe me bowling up in the Wooster sports model tomorrow afternoon with my hair in a braid and a song on my lips. My presence will, I feel sure, stimulate Anatole to new heights of endeavour. Got anybody else staying at the old snake pit?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Five inmates in all.' \x{a0}\x{a0} '<<Five|9k:0>>?' I resumed my tongue-clicking. 'Golly! Uncle Tom must be frothing at the mouth a bit,' I said, for I knew the old buster's distaste for guests in the home. Even a single weekender is sometimes enough to make him drain the bitter cup. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Tom's not there. He's gone to Harrogate with Cream.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You mean lumbago.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I don't mean lumbago. I mean Cream. Homer Cream. Big American tycoon, who is visiting these shores. He suffers from ulcers, and his medicine man has ordered him to take the waters at Harrogate. Tom has gone with him to hold his hand and listen to him of an evening while he tells him how filthy the stuff tastes.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Antagonistic.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I mean altruistic. You are probably not familiar with the word, but it's one I've heard Jeeves use. It's what you say of a fellow who gives selfless service, not counting the cost.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Selfless service, my foot! Tom's in the middle of a very important business deal with Cream. If it goes through, he'll make a packet free of income tax. So he's sucking up to him like a Hollywood Yes-man.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I gave an intelligent nod, though this of course was wasted on her because she couldn't see me. I could readily understand my uncle-by- marriage's mental processes. T. Portarlington Travers is a man who has accumulated the pieces of eight in sackfuls, but he is always more than willing to shove a bit extra away behind the brick in the fireplace, feeling - and rightly -that every little bit added to what you've got makes just a little bit more. And if there's one thing that's right up his street, it is not paying income tax. He grudges every penny the Government nicks him for. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That is why, when kissing me goodbye, he urged me with tears in his eyes to lush Mrs Cream and her son Willie up and treat them like royalty. So they're at Brinkley, dug into the woodwork.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Willie, did you say?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Short for Wilbert.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I mused. Willie Cream. The name seemed familiar somehow. I seemed to have heard it or seen it in the papers somewhere. But it eluded me. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Adela Cream writes mystery stories. Are you a fan of hers? No? Well, start boning up on them, directly you arrive, because every little helps. I've bought a complete set. They're very good.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I shall be delighted to run an eye over her material,' I said, for I am what they call an a-something of novels of suspense. Aficionado, would that be it? 'I can always do with another corpse or two. We have established, then, that among the inmates are this Mrs Cream and her son Wilbert. Who are the other three?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, there's Lady Wickham's daughter Roberta.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I started violently, as if some unseen hand had goosed me. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What! Bobbie Wickham? Oh, my gosh!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Why the agitation? Do you know her?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You bet I know her.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I begin to see Is she one of the gaggle of girls you've been engaged to?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Not actually, no. We were never engaged. But that was merely because she wouldn't meet me half-way.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Turned you down, did she?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, thank goodness ' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Why thank goodness? She's a one-girl beauty chorus ' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'She doesn't try the eyes, I agree.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'A pippin, if ever there was one.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Very true, but is being a pippin everything? What price the soul?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Isn't her soul like mother makes?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Far from it. Much below par. What I could tell you ... But no, let it go Painful subj.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I had been about to mention fifty-seven or so of the reasons why the prudent operator, if he valued his peace of mind, deemed it best to stay well away from the red-headed menace under advisement, but realized that at a moment when I was wanting to get back to the marmalade it would occupy too much time. It will be enough to say that I had long since come out of the ether and was fully cognizant of the fact that in declining to fall in with my suggestion that we should start rounding up clergymen and bridesmaids, the beasel had rendered me a signal service, and I'll tell you why. \x{a0}\x{a0} Aunt Dahlia, describing this young blister as a one-girl beauty chorus, had called her shots perfectly correctly. Her outer crust was indeed of a nature to cause those beholding it to rock back on their heels with a startled whistle But while equipped with eyes like twin stars, hair ruddier than the cherry, oomph, espieglene and all the fixings, B. Wickham had also the disposition and general outlook on life of a ticking bomb In her society you always had the uneasy feeling that something was likely to go off at any moment with a pop. You never knew what she was going to do next or into what murky depths of soup she would carelessly plunge you. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Miss Wickham, sir,' Jeeves had once said to me warningly at the time when the fever was at its height, 'lacks seriousness She is volatile and frivolous. I would always hesitate to recommend as a life partner a young lady with quite such a vivid shade of red hair.' \x{a0}\x{a0} His judgment was sound I have already mentioned how with her subtle wiles this girl had induced me to sneak into Sir Roderick Glossop's sleeping apartment and apply the darning needle to his hot-water bottle, and that was comparatively mild going for her. In a word, Roberta, daughter of the late Sir Cuthbert and Lady Wickham of Skeldings Hall, Herts, was pure dynamite and better kept at a distance by all those who aimed at leading the peaceful life The prospect of being immured with her in the same house, with all the facilities a country-house affords an enterprising girl for landing her nearest and dearest in the mulligatawny, made me singularly dubious about the shape of things to come. \x{a0}\x{a0} And I was tottering under this blow when the old relative administered another, and it was a haymaker. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And there's Aubrey Upjohn and his stepdaughter Phyllis Mills,' she said That's the lot What's the matter with you? Got asthma?' \x{a0}\x{a0} I took her to be alluding to the sharp gasp which had escaped my lips, and I must confess that it had come out not unlike the last words of a dying duck. But I felt perfectly justified in gasping A weaker man would have howled like a banshee. There floated into my mind something Kipper Herring had once said to me. 'You know, Bertie,' he had said, in philosophical mood, 'we have much to be thankful for in this life of ours, you and I However rough the going, there is one sustaining thought to which we can hold. The storm clouds may lower and the horizon grow dark, we may get a nail in our shoe and be caught in the rain without an umbrella, we may come down to breakfast and find that someone else has taken the brown egg, but at least we have the consolation of knowing that we shall never see Aubrey Gawd-help-us Upjohn again. Always remember this in times of despondency,' he said, and I always had. And now here the bounder was, bobbing up right in my midst. Enough to make the stoutest-hearted go into his dying-duck routine. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Aubrey Upjohn?' I quavered. 'You mean my Aubrey Upjohn?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That's the one. Soon after you made your escape from his chain gang he married Jane Mills, a friend of mine with a colossal amount of money. She died, leaving a daughter. I'm the daughter's godmother. Upjohn's retired now and going in for politics. The hot tip is that the boys in the back room are going to run him as the Conservative candidate in the Market Snodsbury division at the next by-election. What a thrill it'll be for you, meeting him again. Or does the prospect scare you?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Certainly not. We Woosters are intrepid. But what on earth did you invite him to Brinkley for?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I didn't. I only wanted Phyllis, but he came along, too.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You should have bunged him out.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I hadn't the heart to.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Weak, very weak.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Besides, I needed him in my business. He's going to present the prizes at Market Snodsbury Grammar School. We've been caught short as usual, and somebody has got to make a speech on ideals and the great world outside to those blasted boys, so he fits in nicely. I believe he's a very fine speaker. His only trouble is that he's stymied unless he has his speech with him and can read it. Calls it referring to his notes. Phyllis told me that. She types the stuff for him.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'A thoroughly low trick,' I said severely. 'Even I, who have never soared above the Yeoman's Wedding Song at a village concert, wouldn't have the crust to face my public unless I'd taken the trouble to memorize the words, though actually with the Yeoman's Wedding Song it is possible to get by quite comfortably by keeping singing \"Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, I hurry along\". In short...' \x{a0}\x{a0} I would have spoken further, but at this point, after urging me to put a sock in it, and giving me a kindly word of warning not to step on any banana skins, she rang off.",

            '[23:00] Jeeves in the Offing - P. G. Wodehouse.epub (index_split_003.html) - Twenty-three',
            "I came away from the telephone on what practically amounted to leaden feet. Here, I was feeling, was a nice bit of box fruit. Bobbie Wickham, with her tendency to stir things up and with each new day to discover some new way of staggering civilization, would by herself have been bad enough. Add Aubrey Upjohn, and the mixture became too rich. I don't know if Kipper, when I rejoined him, noticed that my brow was sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, as I have heard Jeeves put it. Probably not, for he was tucking into toast and marmalade at the moment, but it was. As had happened so often in the past, I was conscious of an impending doom. Exactly what form this would take I was of course unable to say - it might be one thing or it might be another - but a voice seemed to whisper to me that somehow at some not distant date Bertram was slated to get it in the gizzard. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That was Aunt Dahlia, Kipper,' I said. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Bless her jolly old heart,' he responded. 'One of the very best, and you can quote me as saying so. I shall never forget those happy days at Brinkley, and shall be glad at any time that suits her to cadge another invitation. Is she up in London?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Till this afternoon.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'We fill her to the brim with rich foods, of course?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, she's got a lunch date. She's browsing with Sir Roderick Glossop, the loony-doctor. You don't know him, do you?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Only from hearing you speak of him. A tough egg, I gather.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'One of the toughest.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He was the chap, wasn't he, who found the twenty-four cats in your bedroom?' \x{a0}\x{a0} '<<Twenty-three|9k:0>>,' I corrected. I like to get things right. 'They were not my cats. They had been deposited there by my Cousins Claude and Eustace. But I found them difficult to explain. He's a rather bad listener. I hope I shan't find him at Brinkley, too.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Are you going to Brinkley?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Tomorrow afternoon.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You'll enjoy that.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, shall I? The point is a very moot one.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You're crazy. Think of Anatole. Those dinners of his! Is the name of the Peri who stood disconsolate at the gate of Eden familiar to you?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I've heard Jeeves mention her.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, that's how I feel when I remember Anatole's dinners. When I reflect that every night he's dishing them up and I'm not there, I come within a very little of breaking down. What gives you the idea that you won't enjoy yourself? Brinkley Court's an earthly Paradise.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'In many respects, yes, but life there at the moment has its drawbacks. There's far too much of that where-every-prospect-pleases- and-only-man-is-vile stuff buzzing around for my taste. Who do you think is staying at the old dosshouse? Aubrey Upjohn.' \x{a0}\x{a0} It was plain that I had shaken him. His eyes widened, and an astonished piece of toast fell from his grasp. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Old Upjohn? You're kidding.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, he's there. Himself, not a picture. And it seems only yesterday that you were buoying me up by telling me I'd never have to see him again. The storm clouds may lower, you said, if you recollect...' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But how does he come to be at Brinkley?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Precisely what I asked the aged relative, and she had an explanation that seems to cover the facts. Apparently after we took our eye off him he married a friend of hers, one Jane Mills, and acquired a stepdaughter, Phyllis Mills, whose godmother Aunt Dahlia is. The ancestor invited the Mills girl to Brinkley, and Upjohn came along for the ride.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I see. I don't wonder you're trembling like a leaf.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Not like a leaf, exactly, but... yes, I think you might describe me as trembling. One remembers that fishy eye of his.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And the wide, bare upper lip. It won't be pleasant having to gaze at those across the dinner table. Still, you'll like Phyllis.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Do you know her?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'We met out in Switzerland last Christmas. Slap her on the back, will you, and give her my regards. Nice girl, though goofy. She never told me she was related to Upjohn.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'She would naturally keep a thing like that dark.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, one sees that. Just as one would have tried to keep it dark if one had been mixed up in any way with Palmer the poisoner. What ghastly garbage that was he used to fling at us when we were serving our sentence at Malvern House. Remember the sausages on Sunday? And the boiled mutton with caper sauce?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And the margarine. Recalling this last, it's going to be a strain having to sit and watch him getting outside pounds of best country butter. Oh, Jeeves,' I said, as he shimmered in to clear the table, 'you never went to a preparatory school on the south coast of England, did you?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, sir, I was privately educated.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Ah, then you wouldn't understand. Mr Herring and I were discussing our former prep-school beak, Aubrey Upjohn, MA. By the way, Kipper, Aunt Dahlia was telling me something about him which I never knew before and which ought to expose him to the odium of all thinking men. You remember those powerful end-of-term addresses he used to make to us? Well, he couldn't have made them if he hadn't had the stuff all typed out in his grasp, so that he could read it. Without his notes, as he calls them, he's a spent force. Revolting, that, Jeeves, don't you think?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Many orators are, I believe, similarly handicapped, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Too tolerant, Jeeves, far too tolerant. You must guard against this lax outlook. However, the reason I mention Upjohn to you is that he has come back into my life, or will be so coming in about two ticks. He's staying at Brinkley, and I shall be going there tomorrow. That was Aunt Dahlia on the phone just now, and she demands my presence. Will you pack a few necessaries in a suitcase or so?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Very good, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'When are you leaving on your Herne Bay jaunt?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I was thinking of taking a train this morning, sir, but if you would prefer that I remained till tomorrow -' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, no, perfectly all right. Start as soon as you like. What's the joke?' I asked, as the door closed behind him, for I observed that Kipper was chuckling softly. Not an easy thing to do, of course, when your mouth's full of toast and marmalade, but he was doing it. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I was thinking of Upjohn,' he said. \x{a0}\x{a0} I was amazed. It seemed incredible to me that anyone who had done time at Malvern House, Bramley-on-Sea, could chuckle, softly or otherwise, when letting the mind dwell on that outstanding menace. It was like laughing lightly while contemplating one of those horrors from outer space which are so much with us at the moment on the motion- picture screen. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I envy you, Bertie,' he went on, continuing to chuckle. 'You have a wonderful treat in store. You are going to be present at the breakfast table when Upjohn opens his copy of this week's Thursday Review and starts to skim through the pages devoted to comments on current literature. I should explain that among the books that recently arrived at the office was a slim volume from his pen dealing with the Preparatory School and giving it an enthusiastic build-up. The formative years which we spent there, he said, were the happiest of our life.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Gadzooks!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He little knew that his brain child would be given to one of the old lags of Malvern House to review. I'll tell you something, Bertie, that every young man ought to know. Never be a stinker, because if you are, though you may flourish for a time like a green bay tree, sooner or later retribution will overtake you. I need scarcely tell you that I ripped the stuffing out of the beastly little brochure. The thought of those sausages on Sunday filled me with the righteous fury of a Juvenal.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Of a who?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Nobody you know. Before your time. I seemed inspired. Normally, I suppose, a book like that would get me a line and a half in the Other Recent Publications column, but I gave it six hundred words of impassioned prose. How extraordinarily fortunate you are to be in a position to watch his face as he reads them.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'How do you know he'll read them?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He's a subscriber. There was a letter from him on the correspondence page a week or two ago, in which he specifically stated that he had been one for years.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Did you sign the thing?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No. Ye Ed is not keen on underlings advertising their names.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And it was really hot stuff?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Red hot. So eye him closely at the breakfast table. Mark his reaction. I confidently expect the blush of shame and remorse to mantle his cheek.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'The only catch is that 1 don't come down to breakfast when I'm at Brinkley. Still, I suppose I could make a special effort.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Do so. You will find it well worth while,' said Kipper and shortly afterwards popped off to resume the earning of the weekly envelope. \x{a0}\x{a0} He had been gone about twenty minutes when Jeeves came in, bowler hat in hand, to say goodbye. A solemn moment, taxing our self-control to the utmost. However, we both kept the upper lip stiff, and after we had kidded back and forth for a while he started to withdraw. He had reached the door when it suddenly occurred to me that he might have inside information about this Wilbert Cream of whom Aunt Dahlia had spoken. I have generally found that he knows everything about everyone. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, Jeeves,' I said. 'Half a jiffy.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Sir?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Something I want to ask you. It seems that among my fellow-guests at Brinkley will be a Mrs Homer Cream, wife of an American big butter and egg man, and her son Wilbert, commonly known as Willie, and the name Willie Cream seemed somehow to touch a chord. Rightly or wrongly I associate it with trips we have taken to New York, but in what connection I haven't the vaguest. Does it ring a bell with you?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Why yes, sir. References to the gentleman are frequent in the tabloid newspapers of New York, notably in the column conducted by Mr Walter Winchell. He is generally alluded to under the sobriquet of Broadway Willie.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Of course! It all comes back to me. He's what they call a playboy.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Precisely, sir. Notorious for his escapades.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, I've got him placed now. He's the fellow who likes to let off stink bombs in night clubs, which rather falls under the head of carrying coals to Newcastle and seldom cashes a cheque at his bank without producing a gat and saying, \"This is a stick-up.\"' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And... No, sir, I regret that it has for the moment escaped my memory.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What has?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Some other little something, sir, that I was told regarding Mr Cream. Should I recall it, I will communicate with you.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, do. One wants the complete picture. Oh, gosh!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Sir?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Nothing, Jeeves. Just a thought has floated into my mind. All right, push off, or you'll miss your train. Good luck to your shrimping net.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I'll tell you what the thought was that had floated. I have already indicated my qualms at the prospect of being cooped up in the same house with Bobbie Wickham and Aubrey Upjohn, for who could tell what the harvest might be? If in addition to these two heavies I was also to be cheek by jowl with a New York playboy apparently afflicted with bats in the belfry, it began to look as if this visit would prove too much for Bertram's frail strength, and for an instant I toyed with the idea of sending a telegram of regret and oiling out. \x{a0}\x{a0} Then I remembered Anatole's cooking and was strong again. Nobody who has once tasted them would wantonly deprive himself of that wizard's smoked offerings. Whatever spiritual agonies I might be about to undergo at Brinkley Court, Market Snodsbury, near Droitwich, residence there would at least put me several Supremes de fois gras au champagne and Mignonettes de Poulet Petit Duc ahead of the game. Nevertheless, it would be paltering with the truth to say that I was at my ease as I thought of what lay before me in darkest Worcestershire, and the hand that lit the after-breakfast gasper shook quite a bit. \x{a0}\x{a0} At this moment of nervous tension the telephone suddenly gave tongue again, causing me to skip like the high hills, as if the Last Trump had sounded. I went to the instrument all of a twitter. \x{a0}\x{a0} Some species of butler appeared to be at the other end. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Mr Wooster?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'On the spot.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Good morning, sir. Her ladyship wishes to speak to you. Lady Wickham, sir. Here is Mr Wooster, m'lady.' \x{a0}\x{a0} And Bobbie's mother came on the air. \x{a0}\x{a0} I should have mentioned, by the way, that during the above exchange of ideas with the butler I had been aware of a distant sound of sobbing, like background music, and it now became apparent that it was from the larynx of the relict of the late Sir Cuthbert that it was proceeding. There was a short intermission before she got the vocal cords working, and while I was waiting for her to start the dialogue I found myself wrestling with two problems that presented themselves - the first, What on earth is this woman ringing me up for?, the second, Having got the number, why does she sob? \x{a0}\x{a0} It was Problem A that puzzled me particularly, for ever since that hot-water-bottle episode my relations with this parent of Bobbie's had been on the strained side. It was, indeed, an open secret that my standing with her was practically that of a rat of the underworld. I had had this from Bobbie, whose impersonation of her mother discussing me with sympathetic cronies had been exceptionally vivid, and I must confess that I wasn't altogether surprised. No hostess, I mean to say, extending her hospitality to a friend of her daughter's, likes to have the young visitor going about the place puncturing people's water- bottles and leaving at <<three in the morning|5>> without stopping to say good-bye. Yes, I could see her side of the thing all right, and I found it extraordinary that she should be seeking me out on the telephone in this fashion. Feeling as she did so allergic to Bertram, I wouldn't have thought she'd have phoned me with a ten-foot pole. \x{a0}\x{a0} However, there beyond a question she was. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Mr Wooster?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, hullo, Lady Wickham.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Are you there?' \x{a0}\x{a0} I put her straight on this point, and she took time out to sob again. She then spoke in a hoarse, throaty voice, like Tallulah Bankhead after swallowing a fish bone the wrong way. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Is this awful news true?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Eh?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I don't quite follow.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'In this morning's Times.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I'm pretty shrewd, and it seemed to me, reading between the lines, that there must have been something in the issue of The Times published that morning that for some reason had upset her, though why she should have chosen me to tell her troubles to was a mystery not easy to fathom. I was about to institute inquiries in the hope of spearing a solution, when in addition to sobbing she started laughing in a hyaena- esque manner, making it clear to my trained ear that she was having hysterics. And before I could speak there was a dull thud suggestive of some solid body falling to earth, I knew not where, and when the dialogue was resumed, I found that the butler had put himself on as an understudy. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Mr Wooster?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Still here.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I regret to say that her ladyship has fainted.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It was she I heard going bump?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Precisely, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Good-bye.' \x{a0}\x{a0} He replaced the receiver and went about his domestic duties, these no doubt including the loosening of the stricken woman's corsets and burning feathers under her nose, leaving me to chew on the situation without further bulletins from the front. \x{a0}\x{a0} It seemed to me that the thing to do here was to get hold of The Times and see what it had to offer in the way of enlightenment. It's a paper I don't often look at, preferring for breakfast reading the Mirror and the Mail, but Jeeves takes it in and I have occasionally borrowed his copy with a view to having a shot at the crossword puzzle. It struck me as a possibility that he might have left today's issue in the kitchen, and so it proved. I came back with it, lowered myself into a chair, lit another cigarette and proceeded to cast an eye on its contents. \x{a0}\x{a0} At a cursory glance what might be called swoon material appeared to be totally absent from its columns. The Duchess of something had been opening a bazaar at Wimbledon in aid of a deserving charity, there was an article on salmon fishing on the Wye, and a Cabinet Minister had made a speech about conditions in the cotton industry, but I could see nothing in these items to induce a loss of consciousness. Nor did it seem probable that a woman would have passed out cold on reading that Herbert Robinson (26) of Grove Road, Ponder's End, had been jugged for stealing a pair of green and yellow checked trousers. I turned to the cricket news. Had some friend of hers failed to score in one of yesterday's county matches owing to a doubtful l.b.w. decision? \x{a0}\x{a0} It was just after I had run the eye down the Births and Marriages that I happened to look at the Engagements, and a moment later I was shooting out of my chair as if a spike had come through its cushioned seat and penetrated the fleshy parts. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Jeeves!' I yelled, and then remembered that he had long since gone with the wind. A bitter thought, for if ever there was an occasion when his advice and counsel were of the essence, this occ. was that occ. The best I could do, tackling it solo, was to utter a hollow g. and bury the face in the hands. And though I seem to hear my public tut-tutting in disapproval of such neurotic behaviour, I think the verdict of history will be that the paragraph on which my gaze had rested was more than enough to excuse a spot of face-burying. \x{a0}\x{a0} It ran as follows:",

            "The first thing I noticed when at leisure to survey my surroundings was that the woman up top, carrying out her policy of leaving no stone unturned in the way of sucking up to the Cream family, had done Wilbert well where sleeping accommodation was concerned. What he had drawn when clocking in at Brinkley Court was the room known as the Blue Room, a signal honour to be accorded to a bachelor guest, amounting to being given star billing, for at Brinkley, as at most country-houses, any old nook or cranny is considered good enough for the celibate contingent. My own apartment, to take a case in point, was a sort of hermit's cell in which one would have been hard put to it to swing a cat, even a smaller one than Augustus, not of course that one often wants to do much cat-swinging. What I'm driving at is that when I blow in on Aunt Dahlia, you don't catch her saying 'Welcome to Meadowsweet Hall, my dear boy. I've put you in the Blue Room, where I am sure you will be comfortable.' I once suggested to her that I be put there, and all she said was 'You?' and the conversation turned to other topics. \x{a0}\x{a0} The furnishing of this Blue Room was solid and Victorian, it having been the GHQ of my Uncle Tom's late father, who liked things substantial. There was a four-poster bed, a chunky dressing-table, a massive writing table, divers chairs, pictures on the walls of fellows in cocked hats bending over females in muslin and ringlets and over at the far side a cupboard or armoire in which you could have hidden a dozen corpses. In short, there was so much space and so many things to shove things behind that most people, called on to find a silver cow- creamer there, would have said 'Oh, what's the use?' and thrown in the towel. \x{a0}\x{a0} But where I had the bulge on the ordinary searcher was that I am a man of wide reading. Starting in early boyhood, long before they were called novels of suspense, I've read more mystery stories than you could shake a stick at, and they have taught me something -viz. that anybody with anything to hide invariably puts it on top of the cupboard or, if you prefer it, the armoire. This is what happened in Murder at Mistleigh Manor, Three Dead on Tuesday, Excuse my Gat, Guess Who and a dozen more standard works, and I saw no reason to suppose that Wilbert Cream would have deviated from routine. My first move, accordingly, was to take a chair and prop it against the armoire, and I had climbed on this and was preparing to subject the top to a close scrutiny, when Bobbie Wickham, entering on noiseless feet and speaking from about eighteen inches behind me, said: \x{a0}\x{a0} 'How are you getting on?' \x{a0}\x{a0} Really, one sometimes despairs of the modern girl. You'd have thought that this Wickham would have learned at her mother's knee that the last thing a fellow in a highly nervous condition wants, when he's searching someone's room, is a disembodied voice in his immediate ear asking him how he's getting on. The upshot, I need scarcely say, was that I came down like a sack of coals. The pulse was rapid, the blood pressure high, and for awhile the Blue Room pirouetted about me like an adagio dancer. \x{a0}\x{a0} When Reason returned to its throne, I found that Bobbie, no doubt feeling after that resounding crash that she was better elsewhere, had left me and that I was closely entangled in the chair, my position being in some respects similar to that of Kipper Herring when he got both legs wrapped round his neck in Switzerland. It seemed improbable that I would ever get loose without the aid of powerful machinery. \x{a0}\x{a0} However, by pulling this way and pushing that, I made progress, and I'd just contrived to de-chair myself and was about to rise, when another voice spoke. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'For Pete's sake!' it said, and, looking up, I found that it was not, as I had for a moment supposed, from the lips of the Brinkley Court ghost that the words had proceeded, but from those of Mrs Homer Cream. She was looking at me, as Sir Roderick Glossop had recently looked at Bobbie, with a wild surmise, her whole air that of a woman who is not abreast. This time, I noticed, she had an ink spot on her chin. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Mr Wooster!' she yipped. \x{a0}\x{a0} Well, there's nothing much you can say in reply to 'Mr Wooster!' except 'Oh, hullo,' so I said it. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You are doubtless surprised,' I was continuing, when she hogged the conversation again, asking me (a) what I was doing in her son's room and (b) what in the name of goodness I thought I was up to. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'For the love of Mike,' she added, driving her point home. \x{a0}\x{a0} It is frequently said of Bertram Wooster that he is a man who can think on his feet, and if the necessity arises he can also use his loaf when on all fours. On the present occasion I was fortunate in having had that get-together with the housemaid and the cat Augustus, for it gave me what they call in France a point d'appui. Removing a portion of chair which had got entangled in my back hair, I said with a candour that became me well: \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I was looking for a mouse.' \x{a0}\x{a0} If she had replied, 'Ah, yes, indeed. I understand now. A mouse, to be sure. Quite,' everything would have been nice and smooth, but she didn't. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'A mouse?' she said. 'What do you mean?' \x{a0}\x{a0} Well, of course, if she didn't know what a mouse was, there was evidently a good deal of tedious spadework before us, and one would scarcely have known where to start. It was a relief when her next words showed that that 'What do you mean?' had not been a query but more in the nature of a sort of heart-cry. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What makes you think there is a mouse in this room?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'The evidence points that way.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Have you seen it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Actually, no. It's been lying what the French call perdu.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What made you come and look for it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, I thought I would.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And why were you standing on a chair?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Sort of just trying to get a bird's-eye view, as it were.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Do you often go looking for mice in other people's rooms?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I wouldn't say often. Just when the spirit moves me, don't you know?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I see. Well...' \x{a0}\x{a0} When people say 'Well' to you like that, it usually means that they think you are outstaying your welcome and that the time has come to call it a day. She felt, I could see, that Woosters were not required in her son's sleeping apartment, and realizing that there might be something in this, I rose, dusted the knees of the trousers, and after a courteous word to the effect that I hoped the spine-freezer on which she was engaged was coming out well, left the presence. Happening to glance back as I reached the door, I saw her looking after me, that wild surmise still functioning on all twelve cylinders. It was plain that she considered my behaviour odd, and I'm not saying it wasn't. The behaviour of those who allow their actions to be guided by Roberta Wickham is nearly always odd. \x{a0}\x{a0} The thing I wanted most at this juncture was to have a heart-to- heart talk with that young femme fatale, and after roaming hither and thither for a while I found her in my chair on the lawn, reading the Ma Cream book in which I had been engrossed when these doings had started. She greeted me with a bright smile, and said: \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Back already? Did you find it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} With a strong effort I mastered my emotion and replied curtly but civilly that the answer was in the negative. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No,' I said, 'I did not find it.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You can't have looked properly.' \x{a0}\x{a0} Again I was compelled to pause and remind myself that an English gentleman does not slosh a sitting redhead, no matter what the provocation. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I hadn't time to look properly. I was impeded in my movements by half-witted females sneaking up behind me and asking how I was getting on.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, I wanted to know.' A giggle escaped her. 'You did come down a wallop, didn't you? How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning, I said to myself. You're so terribly neurotic, Bertie. You must try to be less jumpy. What you need is a good nerve tonic. I'm sure Sir Roderick would shake you up one, if you asked him. And meanwhile?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'How do you mean, \"And meanwhile\"?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What are your plans now?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I propose to hoik you out of that chair and seat myself in it and take that book, the early chapters of which I found most gripping, and start catching up with my reading and try to forget.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You mean you aren't going to have another bash?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I am not. Bertram is through. You may give this to the press, if you wish.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But the cow-creamer. How about your Uncle Tom's grief and agony when he learns of his bereavement?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Let Uncle Tom eat cake.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Bertie! Your manner is strange.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Your manner would be strange if you'd been sitting on the floor of Wilbert Cream's sleeping apartment with a chair round your neck, and Ma Cream had come in.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Golly! Did she?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'In person.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What did you say?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I said I was looking for a mouse.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Couldn't you think of anything better than that?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And how did it all come out in the end?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I melted away, leaving her plainly convinced that I was off my rocker. And so, young Bobbie, when you speak of having another bash, I merely laugh bitterly,' I said, doing so. 'Catch me going into that sinister room again! Not for a million pounds sterling, cash down in small notes.' \x{a0}\x{a0} She made what I believe, though I wouldn't swear to it, is called a moue. Putting the lips together and shoving them out, if you know what I mean. The impression I got was that she was disappointed in Bertram, having expected better things, and this was borne out by her next words. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Is this the daredevil spirit of the Woosters?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'As of even date, yes.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Are you man or mouse?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Kindly do not mention that word \"mouse\" in my presence.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I do think you might try again. Don't spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar. I'll help you this time.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Ha!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Haven't I heard that word before somewhere?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You may confidently expect to hear it again.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, but listen, Bertie. Nothing can possibly go wrong if we work together. Mrs Cream won't show up this time. Lightning never strikes twice in the same place.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Who made that rule?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And if she does ... Here's what I thought we'd do. You go in and start searching, and I'll stand outside the door.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You feel that will be a lot of help?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Of course it will. If I see her coming, I'll sing.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Always glad to hear you singing, of course, but in what way will that ease the strain?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, Bertie, you really are an abysmal chump. Don't you get it? When you hear me burst into song, you'll know there's peril afoot and you'll have plenty of time to nip out of the window.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And break my bally neck?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'How can you break your neck? There's a balcony outside the Blue Room. I've seen Wilbert Cream standing on it, doing his Daily Dozen. He breathes deeply and ties himself into a lovers' knot and -' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Never mind Wilbert Cream's excesses.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I only put that in to make it more interesting. The point is that there is a balcony and once on it you're home. There's a water pipe at the end of it. You just slide down that and go on your way, singing a gypsy song. You aren't going to tell me that you have any objection to sliding down water pipes. Jeeves says you're always doing it.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I mused. It was true that I had slid down quite a number of water pipes in my time. Circumstances had often so moulded themselves as to make such an action imperative. It was by that route that I had left Skeldings Hall at <<three in the morning|5>> after the hot-water-bottle incident. So while it would be too much, perhaps, to say that I am never happier than when sliding down water pipes, the prospect of doing so caused me little or no concern. I began to see that there was something in this plan she was mooting, if mooting is the word I want. \x{a0}\x{a0} What tipped the scale was the thought of Uncle Tom. His love for the cow-creamer might be misguided, but you couldn't get away from the fact that he was deeply attached to the beastly thing, and one didn't like the idea of him coming back from Harrogate and saying to himself 'And now for a refreshing look at the old cow-creamer' and finding it was not in residence. It would blot the sunshine from his life, and affectionate nephews hate like the dickens to blot the sunshine from the lives of uncles. It was true that I had said 'Let Uncle Tom eat cake,' but I hadn't really meant it. I could not forget that when I was at Malvern House, Bramley-on-Sea, this relative by marriage had often sent me postal orders sometimes for as much as ten bob. He, in short, had done the square thing by me, and it was up to me to do the s.t. by him. \x{a0}\x{a0} And so it came about that some five minutes later I stood once more outside the Blue Room with Bobbie beside me, not actually at the moment singing in the wilderness but prepared so to sing if Ma Cream, modelling her strategy on that of the Assyrian, came down like a wolf on the fold. The nervous system was a bit below par, of course, but not nearly so much so as it might have been. Knowing that Bobbie would be on sentry-go made all the difference. Any gangster will tell you that the strain and anxiety of busting a safe are greatly diminished if you've a look-out man ready at any moment to say 'Cheese it, the cops!' \x{a0}\x{a0} Just to make sure that Wilbert hadn't returned from his hike, I knocked on the door. Nothing stirred. The coast seemed c. I mentioned this to Bobbie, and she agreed that it was as c. as a whistle. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Now a quick run-through, to see that you have got it straight. If I sing, what do you do?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Nip out of the window.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And - ?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Slide down the water pipe.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And - ?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Leg it over the horizon.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Right. In you go and get cracking,' she said, and I went in. \x{a0}\x{a0} The dear old room was just as I'd left it, nothing changed, and my first move, of course, was to procure another chair and give the top of the armoire the once-over. It was a set-back to find that the cow- creamer wasn't there. I suppose these kleptomaniacs know a thing or two and don't hide the loot in the obvious place. There was nothing to be done but start the exhaustive search elsewhere, and I proceeded to do so, keeping an ear cocked for any snatch of song. None coming, it was with something of the old debonair Wooster spirit that I looked under this and peered behind that, and I had just crawled beneath the dressing-table in pursuance of my researches, when one of those disembodied voices which were so frequent in the Blue Room spoke, causing me to give my head a nasty bump. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'For goodness' sake!' it said, and I came out like a pickled onion on the end of a fork, to find that Ma Cream was once more a pleasant visitor. She was standing there, looking down at me with a what-the- hell expression on her finely chiselled face, and I didn't blame her. Gives a woman a start, naturally, to come into her son's bedroom and observe an alien trouser-seat sticking out from under the dressing- table. \x{a0}\x{a0} We went into our routine. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Mr Wooster!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, hullo.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It's you again?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Why, yes,' I said, for this of course was perfectly correct, and an odd sound proceeded from her, not exactly a hiccup and yet not quite not a hiccup. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Are you still looking for that mouse?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That's right. I thought I saw it run under there, and I was about to deal with it regardless of its age or sex.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What makes you think there is a mouse here?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, one gets these ideas.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Do you often hunt for mice?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Fairly frequently.' \x{a0}\x{a0} An idea seemed to strike her. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You don't think you're a cat?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, I'm pretty straight on that.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But you pursue mice?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, this is very interesting. I must consult my psychiatrist when I get back to New York. I'm sure he will tell me that this mouse- fixation is a symbol of something. Your head feels funny, doesn't it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It does rather,' I said, the bump I had given it had been a juicy one, and the temples were throbbing. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I thought as much. A sort of burning sensation, I imagine. Now you do just as I tell you. Go to your room and lie down. Relax. Try to get a little sleep. Perhaps a cup of strong tea would help. And ... I'm trying to think of the name of that alienist I've heard people over here speak so highly of. Miss Wickham mentioned him yesterday. Bossom? Blossom? Glossop, that's it, Sir Roderick Glossop. I think you ought to consult him. A friend of mine is at his clinic now, and she says he's wonderful. Cures the most stubborn cases. Meanwhile, rest is the thing. Go and have a good rest.' \x{a0}\x{a0} At an early point in these exchanges I had started to sidle to the door, and I now sidled through it, rather like a diffident crab on some sandy beach trying to avoid the attentions of a child with a spade. But I didn't go to my room and relax, I went in search of Bobbie, breathing fire. I wanted to take up with her the matter of that absence of the burst of melody. I mean, considering that a mere couple of bars of some popular song hit would have saved me from an experience that had turned the bones to water and whitened the hair from the neck up, I felt entitled to demand an explanation of why those bars had not emerged. \x{a0}\x{a0} I found her outside the front door at the wheel of her car. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, hullo, Bertie,' she said, and a fish on ice couldn't have spoken more calmly. 'Have you got it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} I ground a tooth or two and waved the arms in a passionate gesture. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No,' I said, ignoring her query as to why I had chosen this moment to do my Swedish exercises. 'I haven't. But Ma Cream got me.' \x{a0}\x{a0} Her eyes widened. She squeaked a bit. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Don't tell me she caught you bending again?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Bending is right. I was half-way under the dressing-table. You and your singing,' I said, and I'm not sure I didn't add the word 'Forsooth!' \x{a0}\x{a0} Her eyes widened a bit further, and she squeaked another squeak. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, Bertie, I'm sorry about that.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Me, too.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You see, I was called away to the telephone. Mother rang up. She wanted to tell me you were a nincompoop.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'One wonders where she picks up such expressions.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'From her literary friends, I suppose. She knows a lot of literary people.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Great help to the vocabulary.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes. She was delighted when I told her I was coming home. She wants to have a long talk.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'About me, no doubt?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, I expect your name will crop up. But I mustn't stay here chatting with you, Bertie. If I don't get started, I shan't hit the old nest till daybreak. It's a pity you made such a mess of things. Poor Mr Travers, he'll be broken-hearted. Still, into each life some rain must fall,' she said, and drove off, spraying gravel in all directions. \x{a0}\x{a0} If Jeeves had been there, I would have turned to him and said 'Women, Jeeves!', and he would have said 'Yes, sir' or possibly 'Precisely, sir', and this would have healed the bruised spirit to a certain extent, but as he wasn't I merely laughed a bitter laugh and made for the lawn. A go at Ma Cream's goose-flesher might, I thought, do something to soothe the vibrating ganglions. \x{a0}\x{a0} And it did. I hadn't been reading long when drowsiness stole over me, the tired eyelids closed, and in another couple of ticks I was off to dreamland, slumbering as soundly as if I had been the cat Augustus. I awoke to find that some two hours had passed, and it was while stretching the limbs that I remembered I hadn't sent that wire to Kipper Herring, inviting him to come and join the gang. I went to Aunt Dahlia's boudoir and repaired this omission, telephoning the communication to someone at the post office who would have been well advised to consult a good aurist. This done, I headed for the open spaces again, and was approaching the lawn with a view to getting on with my reading when, hearing engine noises in the background and turning to cast an eye in their direction, blow me tight if I didn't behold Kipper alighting from his car at the front door.",

            '[> 00:00] Jeeves in the Offing - P. G. Wodehouse.epub (index_split_013.html) - past midnight',
            "It's considerably more than a step from Brinkley Court to Herne Bay, the one being in the middle of Worcestershire and the other on the coast of Kent, and even under the best of conditions you don't expect to do the trip in a flash. On the present occasion, held up by the Arab steed getting taken with a fit of the vapours and having to be towed to a garage for medical treatment, I didn't fetch up at journey's end till well <<past midnight|13>>. And when I rolled round to Jeeves's address on the morrow, I was informed that he had gone out early and they didn't know when he would be back. Leaving word for him to ring me at the Drones, I returned to the metropolis and was having the pre-dinner keg of nails in the smoking-room when his call came through. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Mr Wooster? Good evening, sir. This is Jeeves.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And not a moment too soon,' I said, speaking with the emotion of a lost lamb which after long separation from the parent sheep finally manages to spot it across the meadow. 'Where have you been all this time?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I had an appointment to lunch with a friend at Folkestone, sir, and while there was persuaded to extend my visit in order to judge a seaside bathing belles contest.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, really? You do live, don't you?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'How did it go off?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Quite satisfactorily, sir, thank you.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Who won?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'A Miss Marlene Higgins of Brixton, sir, with Miss Lana Brown of Tulse Hill and Miss Marilyn Bunting of Penge honourably mentioned. All most attractive young ladies.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Shapely?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Extremely so.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, let me tell you, Jeeves, and you can paste this in your hat, shapeliness isn't everything in this world. In fact, it sometimes seems to me that the more curved and lissome the members of the opposite sex, the more likely they are to set Hell's foundations quivering. I'm sorely beset, Jeeves. Do you recall telling me once about someone who told somebody he could tell him something which would make him think a bit? Knitted socks and porcupines entered into it, I remember.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I think you may be referring to the ghost of the father of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, sir. Addressing his son, he said \"I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, thy knotted and combined locks to part and each particular hair to stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine.\"' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That's right. Locks, of course, not socks. Odd that he should have said porpentine when he meant porcupine. Slip of the tongue, no doubt, as so often happens with ghosts. Well, he had nothing on me, Jeeves. It's a tale of that precise nature that I am about to unfold. Are you listening?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Then hold on to your hat and don't miss a word.' \x{a0}\x{a0} When I had finished unfolding, he said, 'I can readily appreciate your concern, sir. The situation, as you say, is one fraught with anxiety,' which is pitching it strong for Jeeves, he as a rule coming through with a mere 'Most disturbing, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I will come to Brinkley Court immediately, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Will you really? I hate to interrupt your holiday.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Not at all, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You can resume it later.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Certainly, sir, if that is convenient to you.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But now -' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Precisely sir. Now, if I may borrow a familiar phrase -' \x{a0}\x{a0} ' - is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'The very words I was about to employ, sir. I will call at the apartment at as early an hour tomorrow as is possible.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And we'll drive down together. Right,' I said, and went off to my simple but wholesome dinner. \x{a0}\x{a0} It was with ... well, not quite an uplifted heart... call it a heart lifted about half way ... that I started out for Brinkley on the following afternoon. The thought that Jeeves was at my side, his fish- fed brain at my disposal, caused a spot of silver lining to gleam through the storm clouds, but only a spot, for I was asking myself if even Jeeves might not fail to find a solution of the problem that had raised its ugly head. Admittedly expert though he was at joining sundered hearts, he had rarely been up against a rift within the lute so complete as that within the lute of Roberta Wickham and Reginald Herring, and as I remember hearing him say once, 'tis not in mortals to command success. And at the thought of what would ensue, were he to fall down on the assignment, I quivered like something in aspic. I could not forget that Bobbie, while handing Kipper his hat, had expressed in set terms her intention of lugging me to the altar rails and signalling to the clergyman to do his stuff. So as I drove along the heart, as I have indicated, was uplifted only to a medium extent. \x{a0}\x{a0} When we were out of the London traffic and it was possible to converse without bumping into buses and pedestrians, I threw the meeting open for debate. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You have not forgotten our telephone conversation of yestreen, Jeeves?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You have the salient points docketed in your mind?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Have you been brooding on them?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Got a bite of any sort?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Not yet, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, I hardly expected you would. These things always take time.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'The core of the matter is,' I said, twiddling the wheel to avoid a passing hen, 'that in Roberta Wickham we are dealing with a girl of high and haughty spirit.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And girls of high and haughty spirit need kidding along. This cannot be done by calling them carrot-topped Jezebels.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I know if anyone called me a carrot-topped Jezebel, umbrage is the first thing I'd take. Who was Jezebel, by the way? The name seems familiar, but I can't place her.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'A character in the Old Testament, sir. A queen of Israel.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Of course, yes. Be forgetting my own name next. Eaten by dogs, wasn't she?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Can't have been pleasant for her.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Still, that's the way the ball rolls. Talking of being eaten by dogs, there's a dachshund at Brinkley who when you first meet him will give you the impression that he plans to convert you into a light snack between his regular meals. Pay no attention. It's all eyewash. His belligerent attitude is simply -' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Sound and fury signifying nothing, sir?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That's it. Pure swank. A few civil words, and he will be grappling you ... what's that expression I've heard you use?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Grappling me to his soul with hoops of steel, sir?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'In the first two minutes. He wouldn't hurt a fly, but he has to put up a front because his name's Poppet. One can readily appreciate that when a dog hears himself addressed day in and day out as Poppet, he feels he must throw his weight about. His self-respect demands it.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Precisely, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You'll like Poppet. Nice dog. Wears his ears inside out. Why do dachshunds wear their ears inside out?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I could not say, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Nor me. I've often wondered. But this won't do, Jeeves. Here we are, yakking about Jezebels and dachshunds, when we ought to be concentrating our minds on...' \x{a0}\x{a0} I broke off abruptly. My eye had been caught by a wayside inn. Well, not actually so much by the wayside inn as by what was standing outside it - to wit, a scarlet roadster which I recognized instantly as the property of Bobbie Wickham. One saw what had happened. Driving back to Brinkley after a couple of nights with Mother, she had found the going a bit warm and had stopped off at this hostelry for a quick one. And a very sensible thing to do, too. Nothing picks one up more than a spot of sluicing on a hot summer afternoon. \x{a0}\x{a0} I applied the brakes. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Mind waiting here a minute, Jeeves?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Certainly, sir. You wish to speak to Miss Wickham?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Ah, you spotted her car?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir. It is distinctly individual.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Like its owner. I have a feeling that I may be able to accomplish something in the breach-healing way with a honeyed word or two. Worth trying, don't you think?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Unquestionably, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'At a time like this one doesn't want to leave any avenue unturned.' \x{a0}\x{a0} The interior of the wayside inn - the 'Fox and Goose', not that it matters - was like the interiors of all wayside inns, dark and cool and smelling of beer, cheese, coffee, pickles and the sturdy English peasantry. Entering, you found yourself in a cosy nook with tankards on the walls and chairs and tables dotted hither and thither. On one of the chairs at one of the tables Bobbie was seated with a glass and a bottle of ginger ale before her. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Good Lord, Bertie!' she said as I stepped up and what-ho-ed. 'Where did you spring from?' \x{a0}\x{a0} I explained that I was on my way back to Brinkley from London in my car. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Be careful someone doesn't pinch it. I'll bet you haven't taken out the keys.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, but Jeeves is there, keeping watch and ward, as you might say.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, you've brought Jeeves with you? I thought he was on his holiday.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He very decently cancelled it.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Pretty feudal.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Very. When I told him I needed him at my side, he didn't hesitate.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What do you need him at your side for?' \x{a0}\x{a0} The moment had come for the honeyed word. I lowered my voice to a confidential murmur, but on her inquiring if I had laryngitis raised it again. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I had an idea that he might be able to do something.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What about?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'About you and Kipper,' I said, and started to feel my way cautiously towards the core and centre. It would be necessary, I knew, to pick my words with c., for with girls of high and haughty spirit you have to watch your step, especially if they have red hair, like Bobbie. If they think you're talking out of turn, dudgeon ensues, and dudgeon might easily lead her to reach for the ginger ale bottle and bean me with it. I don't say she would, but it was a possibility that had to be taken into account. So I sort of eased into the agenda. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I must begin by saying that Kipper has given me a full eyewitness's - well, earwitness's I suppose you'd say -report of that chat you and he had over the telephone, and no doubt you are saying to yourself that it would have been in better taste for him to have kept it under his hat. But you must remember that we were boys together, and a fellow naturally confides in a chap he was boys together with. Anyway, be that as it may, he poured out his soul to me, and he hadn't been pouring long before I was able to see that he was cut to the quick. His blood pressure was high, his eye rolled in what they call a fine frenzy, and he was death-where-is-thy-sting-ing like nobody's business.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I saw her quiver and kept a wary eye on the ginger ale bottle. But even if she had raised it and brought it down on the Wooster bean, I couldn't have been more stunned than I was by the words that left her lips. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'The poor lamb!' \x{a0}\x{a0} I had ordered a gin and tonic. I now spilled a portion of this. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Did you say poor lamb?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You bet I said poor lamb, though \"Poor sap\" would perhaps be a better description. Just imagine him taking all that stuff I said seriously. He ought to have known I didn't mean it.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I groped for the gist. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You were just making conversation?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, blowing off steam. For heaven's sake, isn't a girl allowed to blow off some steam occasionally? I never dreamed it would really upset him. Reggie always takes everything so literally.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Then is the position that the laughing love god is once more working at the old stand?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Like a beaver.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'In fact, to coin a phrase, you're sweethearts still?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Of course. I may have meant what I said at the time, but only for about five minutes.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I drew a deep breath, and a moment later wished I hadn't, because I drew it while drinking the remains of my gin and tonic. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Does Kipper know of this?' I said, when I had finished coughing. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Not yet. I'm on my way to tell him.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I raised a point on which I particularly desired assurance. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Then what it boils down to is - No wedding bells for me?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I'm afraid not.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Quite all right. Anything that suits you.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I don't want to get jugged for bigamy.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, one sees that. And your selection for the day is Kipper. I don't blame you. The ideal mate.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Just the way I look at it. He's terrific, isn't he?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Colossal.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I wouldn't marry anyone else if they came to me bringing apes, ivory and peacocks. Tell me what he was like as a boy.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, much the same as the rest of us.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Nonsense!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Except, of course, for rescuing people from burning buildings and saving blue-eyed children from getting squashed by runaway horses.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He did that a lot?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Almost daily.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Was he the Pride of the School?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, rather.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Not that it was much of a school to be the pride of, from what he tells me. A sort of Dotheboys Hall, wasn't it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Conditions under Aubrey Upjohn were fairly tough. One's mind reverts particularly to the sausages on Sunday.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Reggie was very funny about those. He said they were made not from contented pigs but from pigs which had expired, regretted by all, of glanders, the botts and tuberculosis.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, that would be quite a fair description of them, I suppose. You going?' I said, for she had risen. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I can't wait for another minute. I want to fling myself into Reggie's arms. If I don't see him soon, I shall pass out.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I know how you feel. The chap in the Yeoman's Wedding Song thought along those same lines, only the way he put it was \"Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, I hurry along\". At one time I often used to render the number at village concerts, and there was a nasty Becher's Brook to get over when you got to \"For it is my wedding morning,\" because you had to stretch out the \"mor\" for about ten minutes, which tested the lung power severely. I remember the vicar once telling me -' \x{a0}\x{a0} Here I was interrupted, as I'm so often interrupted when giving my views on the Yeoman's Wedding Song, by her saying that she was dying to hear all about it but would rather wait till she could get it in my autobiography. We went out together, and I saw her off and returned to where Jeeves kept his vigil in the car, all smiles. I was all smiles, I mean, not Jeeves. The best he ever does is to let his mouth twitch slightly on one side, generally the left. I was in rare fettle, and the heart had touched a new high. I don't know anything that braces one up like finding you haven't got to get married after all. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Sorry to keep you waiting, Jeeves,' I said. 'Hope you weren't bored?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh no, sir, thank you. I was quite happy with my Spinoza.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Eh?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'The copy of Spinoza's Ethics which you kindly gave me some time ago.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, ah, yes, I remember. Good stuff?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Extremely, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I suppose it turns out in the end that the butler did it. Well, Jeeves, you'll be glad to hear that everything's under control.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Indeed, sir?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, rift in lute mended and wedding bells liable to ring out at any moment. She's changed her mind.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Varium et mutabile semper femina, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I shouldn't wonder. And now,' I said, climbing in and taking the wheel, 'I'll unfold the tale of Wilbert and the cow-creamer, and if that doesn't make your knotted locks do a bit of starting from their spheres, I for one shall be greatly surprised.'",

            "Giving the wench the once-over as she entered, I found myself well able to understand why Bobbie on observing her entangled with Kipper had exploded with so loud a report. I'm not myself, of course, an idealistic girl in love with a member of the staff of the Thursday Review and never have been, but if I were I know I'd get the megrims somewhat severely if I caught him in a clinch with anyone as personable as this stepdaughter of Aubrey Upjohn, for though shaky on the IQ, physically she was a pipterino of the first water. Her eyes were considerably bluer than the skies above, she was wearing a simple summer dress which accentuated rather than hid the graceful outlines of her figure, if you know what I mean, and it was not surprising that Wilbert Cream, seeing her, should have lost no time in reaching for the book of poetry and making a bee line with her to the nearest leafy glade. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, Mrs Travers,' she said, spotting Aunt Dahlia, 'I've just been talking to Daddy on the telephone.' \x{a0}\x{a0} This took the old ancestor's mind right off the tangled affairs of the Kipper-Bobbie axis, to which a moment before she had been according her best attention, and I didn't wonder. With the prize-giving at Market Snodsbury Grammar School, a function at which all that was bravest and fairest in the neighbourhood would be present, only two days away, she must have been getting pretty uneasy about the continued absence of the big shot slated to address the young scholars on ideals and life in the world outside. If you are on the board of governors of a school and have contracted to supply an orator for the great day of the year, you can be forgiven for feeling a trifle jumpy when you learn that the silver-tongued one has gadded off to the metropolis, leaving no word as to when he will be returning, if ever. For all she knew, Upjohn might have got the holiday spirit and be planning to remain burning up the boulevards indefinitely, and of course nothing gives a big beano a black eye more surely than the failure to show up of the principal speaker. So now she quite naturally blossomed like a rose in June and asked if the old son of a bachelor had mentioned anything about when he was coming back. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He's coming back tonight. He says he hopes you haven't been worrying.' \x{a0}\x{a0} A snort of about the calibre of an explosion in an ammunition dump escaped my late father's sister. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, does he? Well, I've a piece of news for him. I have been worrying. What's kept him in London so long?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He's been seeing his lawyer about this libel action he's bringing against the Thursday Review.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I have often asked myself how many inches it was that Kipper leaped from his chair at these words. Sometimes I think it was <<ten|9f>>, sometimes only six, but whichever it was he unquestionably came up from the padded seat like an athlete competing in the Sitting High Jump event. Scarface McColl couldn't have risen more nippily. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Against the Thursday Review?' said Aunt Dahlia. 'That's your rag, isn't it, young Herring? What have they done to stir him up?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It's this book Daddy wrote about preparatory schools. He wrote a book about preparatory schools. Did you know he had written a book about preparatory schools?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Hadn't an inkling. Nobody tells me anything.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, he wrote this book about preparatory schools. It was about preparatory schools.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'About preparatory schools, was it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, about preparatory schools.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Thank God we've got that straightened out at last. I had a feeling we should get somewhere if we dug long enough. And - ?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And the Thursday Review said something libellous about it, and Daddy's lawyer says the jury ought to give Daddy at least five thousand pounds. Because they libelled him. So he's been in London all this time seeing his lawyer. But he's coming back tonight. He'll be here for the prize-giving, and I've got his speech all typed out and ready for him. Oh, there's my precious Poppet,' said Phyllis, as a distant barking reached the ears. 'He's asking for his dinner, the sweet little angel. All right, darling, Mother's coming,' she fluted, and buzzed off on the errand of mercy. \x{a0}\x{a0} A brief silence followed her departure. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I don't care what you say,' said Aunt Dahlia at length in a defiant sort of way. 'Brains aren't everything. She's a dear, sweet girl. I love her like a daughter, and to hell with anyone who calls her a half- wit. Why, hullo,' she proceeded, seeing that Kipper was slumped back in his chair trying without much success to hitch up a drooping lower jaw. 'What's eating you, young Herring?' \x{a0}\x{a0} I could see that Kipper was in no shape for conversation, so took it upon myself to explain. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'A certain stickiness has arisen, aged relative. You heard what P. Mills said before going to minister to Poppet. Those words tell the story.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What do you mean?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'The facts are readily stated. Upjohn wrote this slim volume, which, if you recall, was about preparatory schools, and in it, so Kipper tells me, said that the time spent in these establishments was the happiest of our lives. Ye Ed passed it on to Kipper for comment, and he, remembering the dark days at Malvern House, Bramley-on-Sea, when he and I were plucking the gowans fine there, slated it with no uncertain hand. Correct, Kipper?' \x{a0}\x{a0} He found speech, if you could call making a noise like a buffalo taking its foot out of a swamp finding speech. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But, dash it,' he said, finding a bit more, 'it was perfectly legitimate criticism. I didn't mince my words, of course -' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It would be interesting to find out what these unminced words were,' said Aunt Dahlia, 'for among them there appear to have been one or two which seem likely to set your proprietor back five thousand of the best and brightest. Bertie, get your car out and go to Market Snodsbury station and see if the bookstall has a copy of this week's ... No, wait, hold the line. Cancel that order. I shan't be a minute,' she said, and went out, leaving me totally fogged as to what she was up to. What aunts are up to is never an easy thing to divine. \x{a0}\x{a0} I turned to Kipper. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Bad show,' I said. \x{a0}\x{a0} From the way he writhed I gathered that he was feeling it could scarcely be worse. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What happens when an editorial assistant on a weekly paper lets the bosses in for substantial libel damages?' \x{a0}\x{a0} He was able to answer that one. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He gets the push and, what's more, finds it pretty damned difficult to land another job. He's on the blacklist.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I saw what he meant. These birds who run weekly papers believe in watching the pennies. They like to get all that's coming to them and when the stuff, instead of pouring in, starts pouring out as the result of an injudicious move on the part of a unit of the staff, what they do to that unit is plenty. I think Kipper's outfit was financed by some sort of board or syndicate, but boards and syndicates are just as sensitive about having to cough up as individual owners. As Kipper had indicated, they not only give the erring unit the heave-ho but pass the word round to the other boards and syndicates. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Herring?' the latter say when Kipper comes seeking employment. 'Isn't he the bimbo who took the bread out of the mouths of the Thursday Review people? Chuck the blighter out of the window and we want to see him bounce.' If this action of Upjohn's went through, his chances of any sort of salaried post were meagre, if not slim. It might be years before all was forgiven and forgotten. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Selling pencils in the gutter is about the best I'll be able to look forward to,' said Kipper, and he had just buried his face in his hands, as fellows are apt to do when contemplating a future that's a bit on the bleak side, when the door opened, to reveal not, as I had expected, Aunt Dahlia, but Bobbie. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I got the wrong book,' she said. 'The one I wanted was -' \x{a0}\x{a0} Then her eye fell on Kipper and she stiffened in every limb, rather like Lot's wife, who, as you probably know, did the wrong thing that time there was all that unpleasantness with the cities of the plain and got turned into a pillar of salt, though what was the thought behind this I've never been able to understand. Salt, I mean. Seems so bizarre somehow and not at all what you would expect. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh!' she said haughtily, as if offended by this glimpse into the underworld, and even as she spoke a hollow groan burst from Kipper's interior and he raised an ashen face. And at the sight of that ashen f. the haughtiness went out of Roberta Wickham with a whoosh, to be replaced by all the old love, sympathy, womanly tenderness and what not, and she bounded at him like a leopardess getting together with a lost cub. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Reggie! Oh, Reggie! Reggie, darling, what is it?' she cried, her whole demeanour undergoing a marked change for the better. She was, in short, melted by his distress, as so often happens with the female sex. Poets have frequently commented on this. You are probably familiar with the one who said 'Oh, woman in our hours of ease turn tumty tiddly something please, when something something something something brow, a something something something thou.' \x{a0}\x{a0} She turned on me with an animal snarl. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What have you been doing to the poor lamb?' she demanded, giving me one of the nastiest looks seen that summer in the midland counties, and I had just finished explaining that it was not I but Fate or Destiny that had removed the sunshine from the poor lamb's life, when Aunt Dahlia returned. She had a slip of paper in her hand. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I was right,' she said. 'I knew Upjohn's first move on getting a book published would be to subscribe to a press-cutting agency. I found this on the hall table. It's your review of his slim volume, young Herring, and having run an eye over it I'm not surprised that he's a little upset. I'll read it to you.' \x{a0}\x{a0} As might have been expected, this having been foreshadowed a good deal in one way and another, what Kipper had written was on the severe side, and as far as I was concerned it fell into the rare and refreshing fruit class. I enjoyed every minute of it. It concluded as follows: \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Aubrey Upjohn might have taken a different view of preparatory schools if he had done a stretch at the Dotheboys Hall conducted by him at Malvern House, Bramley-on-Sea, as we had the misfortune to do. We have not forgotten the sausages on Sunday, which were made not from contented pigs but from pigs which had expired, regretted by all, of glanders, the botts and tuberculosis.' \x{a0}\x{a0} Until this passage left the aged relative's lips Kipper had been sitting with the tips of his fingers together, nodding from time to time as much as to say 'Caustic, yes, but perfectly legitimate criticism,' but on hearing this excerpt he did another of his sitting high jumps, lowering all previous records by several inches. It occurred to me as a passing thought that if all other sources of income failed, he had a promising future as an acrobat. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But I never wrote that,' he gasped. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, it's here in cold print.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Why, that's libellous!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'So Upjohn and his legal eagle seem to feel. And I must say it reads like a pretty good five thousand pounds' worth to me.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Let me look at that,' yipped Kipper. 'I don't understand this. No, half a second, darling. Not now. Later. I want to concentrate,' he said, for Bobbie had flung herself on him and was clinging to him like the ivy on the old garden wall. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Reggie!' she wailed - yes, wail's the word. 'It was me!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Eh?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That thing Mrs Travers just read. You remember you showed me the proof at lunch that day and told me to drop it off at the office, as you had to rush along to keep a golf date. I read it again after you'd gone, and saw you had left out that bit about the sausages - accidentally, I thought - and it seemed to me so frightfully funny and clever that... Well, I put it in at the end. I felt it just rounded the thing off.'",

            "With self all eagerness and enthusiasm for the work in hand, straining at the leash, as you might say, and full of the will to win, it came as a bit of a damper when I found on the following afternoon that Jeeves didn't think highly of Operation Upjohn. I told him about it just before starting out for the tryst, feeling that it would be helpful to have his moral support, and was stunned to see that his manner was austere and even puff-faced. He was giving me a description at the time of how it felt to act as judge at a seaside bathing belles contest, and it was with regret that I was compelled to break into this, for he had been holding me spellbound. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I'm sorry, Jeeves,' I said, consulting my watch, 'but I shall have to be dashing off. Urgent appointment. You must tell me the rest later.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'At any time that suits you, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Are you doing anything for the next half-hour or so?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Not planning to curl up in some shady nook with a cigarette and Spinoza?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Then I strongly advise you to come down to the lake and witness a human drama.' \x{a0}\x{a0} And in a few brief words I outlined the programme and the events which had led up to it. He listened attentively and raised his left eyebrow a fraction of an inch. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Was this Miss Wickham's idea, sir?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No. I agree that it sounds like one of hers, but actually it was Sir Roderick Glossop who suggested it. By the way, you were probably surprised to find him buttling here.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It did occasion me a momentary astonishment, but Sir Roderick explained the circumstances.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Fearing that if he didn't let you in on it, you might unmask him in front of Mrs Cream?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No doubt, sir. He would naturally wish to take all precautions. I gathered from his remarks that he has not yet reached a definite conclusion regarding the mental condition of Mr Cream.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, he's still observing. Well, as I say, it was from his fertile bean that the idea sprang. What do you think of it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Ill-advised, sir, in my opinion.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I was amazed. I could hardly b. my e. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Ill-advised?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But it worked without a hitch in the case of Bertha Simmons, George Lanchester and old Mr Simmons.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Very possibly, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} Then why this defeatist attitude?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It is merely a feeling, sir, due probably to my preference for finesse. I mistrust these elaborate schemes. One cannot depend on them. As the poet Burns says, the best laid plans of mice and men gang aft agley.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Scotch, isn't it, that word?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I thought as much. The \"gang\" told the story. Why do Scotsmen say gang?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I have no information, sir. They have not confided in me.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I was getting a bit peeved by now, not at all liking the sniffiness of his manner. I had expected him to speed me on my way with words of encouragement and.uplift, not to go trying to blunt the keen edge of my zest like this. I was rather in the position of a child who runs to his mother hoping for approval and endorsement of something he's done, and is awarded instead a brusque kick in the pants. It was with a good deal of warmth that I came back at him. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'So you think the poet Burns would look askance at this enterprise of ours, do you? Well, you can tell him from me he's an ass. We've thought the thing out to the last detail. Miss Wickham asks Mr Upjohn to come for a stroll with her. She leads him to the lake. I am standing on the brink, ostensibly taking a look at the fishes playing amongst the reeds. Kipper, ready to the last button, is behind a neighbouring tree. On the cue \"Oh, look!\" from Miss Wickham, accompanied by business of pointing with girlish excitement at something in the water, Upjohn bends over to peer. I push, Kipper dives in, and there we are. Nothing can possibly go wrong.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Just as you say, sir. But I still have that feeling.' \x{a0}\x{a0} The blood of the Woosters is hot, and I was about to tell him in set terms what I thought of his bally feeling, when I suddenly spotted what it was that was making him crab the act. The green-eyed monster had bitten him. He was miffed because he wasn't the brains behind this binge, the blue prints for it having been laid down by a rival. Even great men have their weaknesses. So I held back the acid crack I might have made, and went off with a mere 'Oh, yeah?' No sense in twisting the knife in the wound, I mean. \x{a0}\x{a0} All the same, I remained a bit hot under the collar, because when you're all strung up and tense and all that, the last thing you want is people upsetting you by bringing in the poet Burns. I hadn't told him, but our plans had already nearly been wrecked at the outset by the unfortunate circumstance of Upjohn, while in the metropolis, having shaved his moustache, this causing Kipper to come within a toucher of losing his nerve and calling the whole thing off. The sight of that bare expanse or steppe of flesh beneath the nose, he said, did something to him, bringing back the days when he had so often found his blood turning to ice on beholding it. It had required quite a series of pep talks to revive his manly spirits. \x{a0}\x{a0} However, there was good stuff in the lad, and though for a while the temperature of his feet had dropped sharply, threatening to reduce him to the status of a non-co-operative cat in an adage, at <<3.30|1a>> Greenwich Mean Time he was at his post behind the selected tree, resolved to do his bit. He poked his head round the tree as I arrived, and when I waved a cheery hand at him, waved a fairly cheery hand at me. Though I only caught a glimpse of him, I could see that his upper lip was stiff. \x{a0}\x{a0} There being no signs as yet of the female star and her companion, I deduced that I was a bit on the early side. I lit a cigarette and stood awaiting their entrance, and was pleased to note that conditions could scarcely have been better for the coming water fete. Too often on an English summer day you find the sun going behind the clouds and a nippy wind springing up from the north-east, but this afternoon was one of those still, sultry afternoons when the slightest movement brings the persp. in beads to the brow, an afternoon, in short, when it would be a positive pleasure to be shoved into a lake. 'Most refreshing,' Upjohn would say to himself as the cool water played about his limbs. \x{a0}\x{a0} I was standing there running over the stage directions in my mind to see that I had got them all clear, when I beheld Wilbert Cream approaching, the dog Poppet curvetting about his ankles. On seeing me, the hound rushed forward with uncouth cries as was his wont, but on heaving alongside and getting a whiff of Wooster Number Five calmed down, and I was at liberty to attend to Wilbert, who I could see desired speech with me. \x{a0}\x{a0} He was looking, I noticed, fairly green about the gills, and he conveyed the same suggestion of having just swallowed a bad oyster which I had observed in Kipper on his arrival at Brinkley. It was plain that the loss of Phyllis Mills, goofy though she unquestionably was, had hit him a shrewd wallop, and I presumed that he was coming to me for sympathy and heart balm, which I would have been only too pleased to dish out. I hoped, of course, that he would make it crisp and remove himself at an early date, for when the moment came for the balloon to go up I didn't want to be hampered by an audience. When you're pushing someone into a lake, nothing embarrasses you more than having the front seats filled up with goggling spectators. \x{a0}\x{a0} It was not, however, on the subject of Phyllis that he proceeded to touch. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, Wooster,' he said, 'I was talking to my mother a night or two ago.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, yes?' I said, with a slight wave of the hand intended to indicate that if he liked to talk to his mother anywhere, all over the house, he had my approval. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'She tells me you are interested in mice.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I didn't like the trend the conversation was taking, but I preserved my aplomb. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Why, yes, fairly interested.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'She says she found you trying to catch one in my bedroom!' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, that's right.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Good of you to bother.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Not at all. Always a pleasure.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'She says you seemed to be making a very thorough search of my room.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, well, you know, when one sets one's hand to the plough.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You didn't find a mouse?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No, no mouse. Sorry.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I wonder if by any chance you happened to find an eighteenth- century cow-creamer?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Eh?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'A silver jug shaped like a cow.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No. Why, was it on the floor somewhere?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It was in a drawer of the bureau.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Ah, then I would have missed it.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You'd certainly miss it now. It's gone.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Gone?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Gone.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You mean disappeared, as it were?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I do.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Strange.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Very strange.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, does seem extremely strange, doesn't it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} I had spoken with all the old Wooster coolness, and I doubt if a casual observer would have detected that Bertram was not at his ease, but I can assure my public that he wasn't by a wide margin. My heart had leaped in the manner popularized by Kipper Herring and Scarface McColl, crashing against my front teeth with a thud which must have been audible in Market Snodsbury. A far less astute man would have been able to divine what had happened. Not knowing the score owing to having missed the latest stop-press news and looking on the cow-creamer purely in the light of a bit of the swag collected by Wilbert in the course of his larcenous career, Pop Glossop, all zeal, had embarked on the search he had planned to make, and intuition, developed by years of hunt-the- slipper, had led him to the right spot. Too late I regretted sorely that, concentrating so tensely on Operation Upjohn, I had failed to place the facts before him. Had he but known, about summed it up. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I was going to ask you,' said Wilbert, 'if you think I should inform Mrs Travers.' \x{a0}\x{a0} The cigarette I was smoking was fortunately one of the kind that make you nonchalant, so it was nonchalantly - or fairly nonchalantly - that I was able to reply. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, I wouldn't do that.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Why not?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Might upset her.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You consider her a sensitive plant?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, very. Rugged exterior, of course, but you can't go by that. No, I'd just wait a while, if I were you. I expect it'll turn out that the thing's somewhere you put it but didn't think you'd put it. I mean, you often put a thing somewhere and think you've put it somewhere else and then find you didn't put it somewhere else but somewhere. I don't know if you follow me?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I don't.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What I mean is, just stick around and you'll probably find the thing.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You think it will return?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I do.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Like a homing pigeon?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'That's the idea.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh?' said Wilbert, and turned away to greet Bobbie and Upjohn, who had just arrived on the boat-house landing stage. I had found his manner a little peculiar, particularly that last 'Oh?' but I was glad that there was no lurking suspicion in his mind that I had taken the bally thing. He might so easily have got the idea that Uncle Tom, regretting having parted with his ewe lamb, had employed me to recover it privily, this being the sort of thing, I believe, that collectors frequently do. Nevertheless, I was still much shaken, and I made a mental note to tell Roddy Glossop to slip it back among his effects at the earliest possible moment. \x{a0}\x{a0} I shifted over to where Bobbie and Upjohn were standing, and though up and doing with a heart for any fate couldn't help getting that feeling you get at times like this of having swallowed a double portion of butterflies. My emotions were somewhat similar to those I had experienced when I first sang the Yeoman's Wedding Song. In public, I mean, for of course I had long been singing it in my bath. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Hullo, Bobbie,' I said. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Hullo, Bertie,' she said. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Hullo, Upjohn,' I said. \x{a0}\x{a0} The correct response to this would have been 'Hullo, Wooster', but he blew up in his lines and merely made a noise like a wolf with its big toe caught in a trap. Seemed a bit restive, I thought, as if wishing he were elsewhere. \x{a0}\x{a0} Bobbie was all girlish animation. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I've been telling Mr Upjohn about that big fish we saw in the lake yesterday, Bertie.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Ah yes, the big fish.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It was a whopper, wasn't it?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Very well-developed.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I brought him down here to show it to him.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Quite right. You'll enjoy the big fish, Upjohn.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I had been perfectly correct in supposing him to be restive. He did his wolf impersonation once more. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I shall do nothing of the sort,' he said, and you couldn't find a better word than 'testily' to describe the way he spoke. 'It is most inconvenient for me to be away from the house at this time. I am expecting a telephone call from my lawyer.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, I wouldn't bother about telephone calls from lawyers,' said heartily. 'These legal birds never say anything worth listening to. Just gab gab gab. You'll never forgive yourself if you miss the big fish. You were saying, Upjohn?' I broke off courteously, for he had spoken. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I am saying, Mr Wooster, that both you and Miss Wickham are labouring under a singular delusion in supposing that I am interested in fish, whether large or small. I ought never to have left the house. I shall return there at once.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, don't go yet,' said. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Wait for the big fish,' said Bobbie. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Bound to be along shortly,' I said. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'At any moment now,' said Bobbie. \x{a0}\x{a0} Her eyes met mine, and I read in them the message she was trying to convey - viz. that the time had come to act. There is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune. Not my own. Jeeves's. She bent over and pointed with an eager finger. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, look!' she cried. \x{a0}\x{a0} This, as I had explained to Jeeves, should have been the cue for Upjohn to bend over, too, thus making it a simple task for me to do my stuff, but he didn't bend over an inch. And why? Because at this moment the goof Phyllis, suddenly appearing in our midst, said: \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Daddy, dear, you're wanted on the telephone.' \x{a0}\x{a0} Upon which, standing not on the order of his going, Upjohn was off as if propelled from a gun. He couldn't have moved quicker if he had been the dachshund Poppet, who at this juncture was running round in circles, trying, if I read his thoughts aright, to work off the rather heavy lunch he had had earlier in the afternoon. \x{a0}\x{a0} One began to see what the poet Burns had meant. I don't know anything that more promptly gums up a dramatic sequence than the sudden and unexpected exit of an important member of the cast at a critical point in the proceedings. I was reminded of the time when we did Charley's Aunt at the Market Snodsbury Town Hall in aid of the local church organ fund and half-way through the second act, just when we were all giving of our best, Catsmeat Potter-Pirbright, who was playing Lord Fancourt Babberley, left the stage abruptly to attend to an unforeseen nose bleed. \x{a0}\x{a0} As far as Bobbie and I were concerned, silence reigned, this novel twist in the scenario having wiped speech from our lips, as the expression is, but Phyllis continued vocal. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I found this darling pussycat in the garden,' she said, and for the first time I observed that she was bearing Augustus in her arms. He was looking a bit disgruntled, and one could readily see why. He wanted to catch up with his sleep and was being kept awake by the endearments she was murmuring in his ear. \x{a0}\x{a0} She lowered him to the ground. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I brought him here to talk to Poppet. Poppet loves cats, don't you angel? Come and say how-d'you-do to the sweet pussykins, darling.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I shot a quick look at Wilbert Cream, to see how he was reacting to this. It was the sort of observation which might well have quenched the spark of love in his bosom, for nothing tends to cool the human heart more swiftly than babytalk. But so far from being revolted he was gazing yearningly at her as if her words were music to his ears. Very odd, I felt, and I was just saying to myself that you never could tell, when I became aware of a certain liveliness in my immediate vicinity. \x{a0}\x{a0} At the moment when Augustus touched ground and curling himself into a ball fell into a light doze, Poppet had completed his tenth lap and was preparing to start on his eleventh. Seeing Augustus, he halted in mid-stride, smiled broadly, turned his ears inside out, stuck his tail straight up at right angles to the parent body and bounded forward, barking merrily. \x{a0}\x{a0} I could have told the silly ass his attitude was all wrong. Roused abruptly from slumber, the most easy-going cat is apt to wake up cross. Already Augustus had had much to endure from Phyllis, who had doubtless jerked him out of dreamland when scooping him up in the garden, and all this noise and heartiness breaking out just as he dropped off again put the lid on his sullen mood. He spat peevishly, there was a sharp yelp, and something long and brown came shooting between my legs, precipitating itself and me into the depths. The waters closed about me, and for an instant I knew no more. \x{a0}\x{a0} When I rose to the surface, I found that Poppet and I were not the only bathers. We had been joined by Wilbert Cream, who had dived in, seized the hound by the scruff of the neck, and was towing him at a brisk pace to the shore. And by one of those odd coincidences I was at this moment seized by the scruff of the neck myself. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It's all right, Mr Upjohn, keep quite cool, keep quite ... What the hell are you doing here, Bertie?' said Kipper, for it was he. I may have been wrong, but it seemed to me that he spoke petulantly. \x{a0}\x{a0} I expelled a pint or so of H2O. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You may well ask,' I said, moodily detaching a water beetle from my hair. 'I don't know if you know the meaning of the word \"agley\", Kipper, but that, to put it in a nutshell, is the way things have ganged.'",

            "This was the first time I had seen Ma Cream today, she having gone off <<around noon|13>> to lunch with some friends in Birmingham, and I would willingly not have seen her now, for something in her manner seemed to suggest that she spelled trouble. She was looking more like Sherlock Holmes than ever. Slap a dressing-gown on her and give her a violin, and she could have walked straight into Baker Street and no questions asked. Fixing me with a penetrating eye, she said: \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, there you are, Mr Wooster. I was looking for you.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You wished speech with me?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes. I wanted to say that now perhaps you'd believe me.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I beg your pardon?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'About that butler.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What about him?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I'll tell you about him. I'd sit down, if I were you. It's a long story.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I sat down. Clad to, as a matter of fact, for the legs were feeling weak. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You remember I told you I mistrusted him from the first?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh ah, yes. You did, didn't you?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I said he had a criminal face.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He can't help his face.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He can help being a crook and an impostor. Calls himself a butler, does he? The police could shake that story. He's no more a butler than I am.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I did my best. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But think of those references of his.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I am thinking of them.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He couldn't have stuck it out as major-domo to a man like Sir Roderick Glossop, if he'd been dishonest.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'He didn't.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'But Bobbie said -' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I remember very clearly what Miss Wickham said. She told me he had been with Sir Roderick Glossop for years.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, then.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You think that puts him in the clear?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Certainly.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I don't, and I'll tell you why. Sir Roderick Glossop has a large clinic down in Somersetshire at a place called Chuffnell Regis, and a friend of mine is there. I wrote to her asking her to see Lady Glossop and get all the information she could about a former butler of hers named Swordfish. When I got back from Birmingham just now, I found a letter from her. She says that Lady Glossop told her she had never employed a butler called Swordfish. Try that one on for size.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I continued to do my best. The Woosters never give up. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You don't know Lady Glossop, do you?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Of course I don't, or I'd have written to her direct.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Charming woman, but with a memory like a sieve. The sort who's always losing one glove at the theatre. Naturally she wouldn't remember a butler's name. She probably thought all along it was Fotheringay or Binks or something. Very common, that sort of mental lapse. I was up at Oxford with a man called Robinson, and I was trying to think of his name the other day and the nearest I could get to it was Fosdyke. It only came back to me when I saw in The Times a few days ago that Herbert Robinson (26) of Grove Road, Ponder's End, had been had up at Bosher Street police court, charged with having stolen a pair of green and yellow checked trousers. Not the same chap, of course, but you get the idea. I've no doubt that one of these fine mornings Lady Glossop will suddenly smack herself on the forehead and cry \"Swordfish! Of course! And all this time I've been thinking of the honest fellow as Catbird!\"' \x{a0}\x{a0} She sniffed. And if I were to say that I liked the way she sniffed, I would be wilfully deceiving my public. It was the sort of sniff Sherlock Holmes would have sniffed when about to clap the darbies on the chap who had swiped the Maharajah's ruby. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Honest fellow, did you say? Then how do you account for this? I saw Willie just now, and he tells me that a valuable eighteenth-century cow- creamer which he bought from Mr Travers is missing. And where is it, you ask? At this moment it is tucked away in Swordfish's bedroom in a drawer under his clean shirts.' \x{a0}\x{a0} In stating that the Woosters never give up, I was in error. These words caught me amidships and took all the fighting spirit out of me, leaving me a spent force. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, is it?' I said. Not good, but the best I could do. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes, sir, that's where it is. Directly Willie told me the thing had gone, I knew where it had gone to. I went to this man Swordfish's room and searched it, and there it was. I've sent for the police.' \x{a0}\x{a0} Again I had that feeling of having been spiritually knocked base over apex. I gaped at the woman. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You've sent for the police?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I have, and they're sending a sergeant. He ought to be here at any moment. And shall I tell you something? I'm going now to stand outside Swordfish's door, to see that nobody tampers with the evidence. I'm not going to take any chances. I wouldn't want to say anything to suggest that I don't trust you implicitly, Mr Wooster, but I don't like the way you've been sticking up for this fellow. You've been far too sympathetic with him for my taste.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'It's just that I think he may have yielded to sudden temptation and all that.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Nonsense. He's probably been acting this way all his life. I'll bet he was swiping things as a small boy.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Only biscuits.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I beg your pardon?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Or crackers you would call them, wouldn't you? He was telling me he occasionally pinched a cracker or two in his salad days.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Well, there you are. You start with crackers and you end up with silver jugs. That's life,' she said, and buzzed off to keep her vigil, leaving me kicking myself because I'd forgotten to say anything about the quality of mercy not being strained. It isn't, as I dare say you know, and a mention of this might just have done the trick. \x{a0}\x{a0} I was still brooding on this oversight and wondering what was to be done for the best, when Bobbie and Aunt Dahlia came in, looking like a young female and an elderly female who were sitting on top of the world. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Roberta tells me she has got Upjohn to withdraw the libel suit,' said Aunt Dahlia. 'I couldn't be more pleased, but I'm blowed if I can imagine how she did it.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Oh, I just appealed to his better feelings,' said Bobbie, giving me one of those significant glances. I got the message. The ancestor, she was warning me, must never learn that she had achieved her ends by jeopardizing the delivery of the Upjohn speech to the young scholars of Market Snodsbury Grammar School on the morrow. 'I told him that the quality of mercy ... What's the matter, Bertie?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Nothing. Just starting.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'What do you want to start for?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I believe Brinkley Court is open for starting in at about this hour, is it not? The quality of mercy, you were saying?' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Yes. It isn't strained.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'I believe not.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'And in case you didn't know, it's twice bless'd and becomes the throned monarch better than his crown. I drove over to the \"Bull and Bush\" and put this to Upjohn, and he saw my point. So now everything's fine.' \x{a0}\x{a0} I uttered a hacking laugh. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'No,' I said, in answer to a query from Aunt Dahlia. 'I have not accidentally swallowed my tonsils, I was merely laughing hackingly. Ironical that the young blister should say that everything is fine, for at this very moment disaster stares us in the eyeball. I have a story to relate which I think you will agree falls into the fretful porpentine class,' I said, and without further pourparlers I unshipped my tale. \x{a0}\x{a0} I had anticipated that it would shake them to their foundation garments, and it did. Aunt Dahlia reeled like an aunt struck behind the ear with a blunt instrument, and Bobbie tottered like a red-haired girl who hadn't known it was loaded. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You see the set-up,' I continued, not wanting to rub it in but feeling that they should be fully briefed. 'Glossop will return from his afternoon off to find the awful majesty of the Law waiting for him, complete with handcuffs. We can hardly expect him to accept an exemplary sentence without a murmur, so his first move will be to establish his innocence by revealing all. \"True,\" he will say, \"I did pinch this bally cow-creamer, but merely because I thought Wilbert had pinched it and it ought to be returned to store,\" and he will go on to explain his position in the house - all this, mind you, in front of Ma Cream. So what ensues? The sergeant removes the gloves from his wrists, and Ma Cream asks you if she may use your telephone for a moment, as she wishes to call her husband on long distance. Pop Cream listens attentively to the tale she tells, and when Uncle Tom looks in on him later, he finds him with folded arms and a forbidding scowl. \"Travers,\" he says, \"the deal's off.\" \"Off ?\" quivers Uncle Tom. \"Off,\" says Cream. \"O-ruddy-double-f. I don't do business with guys whose wives bring in loony-doctors to observe my son.\" A short while ago Ma Cream was urging me to try something on for size. I suggest that you do the same for this.' \x{a0}\x{a0} Aunt Dahlia had sunk into a chair and was starting to turn purple. Strong emotion always has this effect on her. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'The only thing left, it seems to me,' I said, 'is to put our trust in a higher power.' \x{a0}\x{a0} 'You're right,' said the relative, fanning her brow. 'Go and fetch Jeeves, Roberta. And what you do, Bertie, is get out that car of yours and scour the countryside for Glossop. It may be possible to head him off. Come on, come on, let's have some service. What are you waiting for?' \x{a0}\x{a0} I hadn't exactly been waiting. I'd only been thinking that the enterprise had more than a touch of looking for a needle in a haystack about it. You can't find loony-doctors on their afternoon off just by driving around Worcestershire in a car; you need bloodhounds and handkerchiefs for them to sniff at and all that professional stuff. Still, there it was. \x{a0}\x{a0} 'Right-ho,' I said. 'Anything to oblige.'",
