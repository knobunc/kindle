            'I saw her point - a penny saved is a penny earned and all that sort of thing - but I continued surprised. It amazed me that Aunt Dahlia, presumably a free agent, should have selected this very formidable loony-doctor to chew the <<mid-day|13>> chop with. However, one of the first lessons life teaches us is that aunts will be aunts, so I merely shrugged a couple of shoulders.',

            'It was Problem A that puzzled me particularly, for ever since that hot-water-bottle episode my relations with this parent of Bobbie\'s had been on the strained side. It was, indeed, an open secret that my standing with her was practically that of a rat of the underworld. I had had this from Bobbie, whose impersonation of her mother discussing me with sympathetic cronies had been exceptionally vivid, and I must confess that I wasn\'t altogether surprised. No hostess, I mean to say, extending her hospitality to a friend of her daughter\'s, likes to have the young visitor going about the place puncturing people\'s water- bottles and leaving at <<three in the morning|5>> without stopping to say good-bye. Yes, I could see her side of the thing all right, and I found it extraordinary that she should be seeking me out on the telephone in this fashion. Feeling as she did so allergic to Bertram, I wouldn\'t have thought she\'d have phoned me with a ten-foot pole.',

            'I mused. It was true that I had slid down quite a number of water pipes in my time. Circumstances had often so moulded themselves as to make such an action imperative. It was by that route that I had left Skeldings Hall at <<three in the morning|5>> after the hot-water-bottle incident. So while it would be too much, perhaps, to say that I am never happier than when sliding down water pipes, the prospect of doing so caused me little or no concern. I began to see that there was something in this plan she was mooting, if mooting is the word I want.',

On the present occasion, held up by the Arab steed getting taken with a fit of the vapours and having to be towed to a garage for medical treatment, I didn\'t fetch up at journey\'s end till well <<past midnight|13>>. And when I rolled round to Jeeves\'s address on the morrow, I was informed that he had gone out early and they didn\'t know when he would be back. Leaving word for him to ring me at the Drones, I returned to the metropolis and was having the pre-dinner keg of nails in the smoking-room when his call came through.',

He poked his head round the tree as I arrived, and when I waved a cheery hand at him, waved a fairly cheery hand at me.

She was looking more like Sherlock Holmes than ever. Slap a dressing-gown on her and give her a violin, and she could have walked straight into Baker Street and no questions asked.
