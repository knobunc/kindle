            "The connection between the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation and the energy of photons\x{2014}the smaller the wavelength, the larger the energy\x{2014}was one of Einstein\x{2019}s most important 1905 discoveries. In order of increasing wavelength, the electromagnetic spectrum consists of gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, and radio waves. Radio waves have the longest wavelength, from meters to cosmic dimensions. They are a very poor choice for making precise images of ordinary objects because the images will be no sharper than the wavelength. In a radio image a human being would be indistinguishable from a sack of laundry. In fact it would be impossible to tell one person from <<two|9c:0>>, unless the separation between them was greater than the wavelength of the radio wave. All the images would be blurred fuzz balls. This doesn\x{2019}t mean that radio waves are never useful for imaging: they are just not good for imaging small objects. Radio astronomy is a very powerful method for studying large astronomical objects. By contrast, gamma rays are best for getting information about really small things such as nuclei. They have the smallest wavelengths, a good deal smaller than the size of a single atom.",

If I change the units, say, to centimeters, grams, and hours, the numerical value of all three constants will change. For example, the speed of light will get worse. It will become <<1.08|5a:1>> \x{d7} 10 centimeters per hour. But if I use years for time and light-years for distance, then the speed of light will be exactly one since light travels one light-year per year. Doesn\x{2019}t that mean that I can invent some new units and make the three fundamental constants anything I want? I can even find units in which all three fundamental constants of physics are equal to one! That will simplify so many formulas.

By <<1947|9:0>> the General Theory of Relativity and quantum mechanics were part of the basic foundation of physics, but hardly anyone had started to think about the synthesis of the two: quantum gravity. The three Planck units of length, mass, and time were critical in the development of the discipline, but even now, we are only beginning to understand the depth of their significance.

            "Your body has about 10 protons. If the proton lifetime were twenty billion years, <<about 10|9:0>> of those protons would decay every year. This is a negligible fraction of your protons, so you don\x{2019}t have to worry about disappearing. But each proton that decays in your body shoots out energetic particles: photons and positrons and pions. These particles moving through your body have the same effects as exposure to radioactivity: cell damage and cancer. If 10 protons decay in your body, they will kill you. So the anthropic constraints on proton decay may be stronger than what you naively think. As far as we know, a lifetime of a million times the age of the universe\x{2014}10 years\x{2014}is long enough not to jeopardize life. On anthropic grounds we can rule out all valleys of the Landscape where the average proton lifetime is less than this.",

The prize was ultimately awarded not for relativity but for the photoelectric effect. This, the most radical of Einstein\x{2019}s contributions, is where the idea that light is composed of discrete quanta of energy was first argued. Physics was ready for the Special Theory of Relativity. In fact it was overdue. But the photon theory of light was a bolt from the blue. As noted previously, Einstein argued that a beam of light, usually thought of as a pure wave phenomenon, had a discrete, or grainy, structure. If the light had a definite color (wavelength), then the photons would all be marching in lock step, each photon identical to every other photon. Particles that can all be in the same quantum state like photons are called bosons, after the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose.",

            "The decaying neutron is a good illustration to start with. With a bit of simplification, we can suppose there are only two possible outcomes when we observe the neutron: either it has decayed or it hasn\x{2019}t. The list of possibilities is a short one, and the wave function has only two entries. We start with the neutron in its undecayed form so that the wave function has value one for the first possibility and zero for the second. In other words initially the probability that the neutron is undecayed is one, while the probability that it has decayed (when we start) is zero. But after a short time, there is a small probability that the neutron has disappeared. The two entries to the wave function have changed from <<one|9c:1>> and zero to something a bit less than one and something a bit more than zero. After about ten minutes the two entries have become equal. Go on for another ten minutes, and the probabilities will be reversed: the probability that the neutron is still intact will be close to zero, and the probability that it has become a proton/ electron/ antineutrino will be up near one. Quantum mechanics contains a set of rules for updating the wave function of a system as time unfolds. In its most general form, the system of interest is everything\x{2014}the entire observable universe, including the observer doing the observations. Since there may be more than one lump of matter that might be called an observer, the theory must give rise to consistent observations. The wave function contains all of this and in a way that will prove consistent when two observers get together to discuss their findings.",
