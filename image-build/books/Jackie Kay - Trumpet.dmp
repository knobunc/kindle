Edith Moore has given it to him in a brown envelope. There she is, Josephine Moore at the age of seven, smiling a gap-toothed smile, the first two milk teeth gone missing together. Her hair a mass of black curls. A great big happy grin. She is wearing a white blouse and white ankle socks. Black shiny shoes. A pleated dark skirt. She is standing next to the wall of the house she lived in then. 20 Aberdower Road. Edith told him all the addresses she had ever lived in. She reeled them off with the satisfaction of somebody at last able to remember something accurately. She paused dramatically at the end of each address. Colman stops under a street lamp and stares at the photograph again. He can\x{2019}t get away with it. Now that he\x{2019}s seen the little girl, he can see something feminine in his memory of his father\x{2019}s face that must have been there all along.",

Wearing well. The mirror spied one or two weaknesses. A couple of veins were coming through her skin like tiny red roots. She got out her hot curling brush to give her hair a bit of body on the top. She scooshed some hairspray to keep it in place. A soft spray \x{2013} she loathed those hairsprays that made your hair look petrified. She rubbed some moisturizer into her cheeks. She squirted on some of the perfume that her son had bought her from the duty free. She smelt expensive. She rubbed some foundation cream over the veins. Put on some of the lipstick her daughter had given her in a Christmas stocking. The thought of talking about her childhood was filling her with nostalgia. That early in the morning the past was already bringing about some sort of allergic reaction; she started to sneeze just as she remembered the time she and Josephine had had a schoolgirl crush. She was not going to mention that to this journalist.",
