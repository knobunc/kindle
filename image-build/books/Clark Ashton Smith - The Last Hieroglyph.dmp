Like shadows gliding through oblivion, they vanished upon their various ways; each of them, returning presently to the darkened palace, led with him a shrouded figure no less silent and discreet than himself.In this manner, groping along tortuous alleys, through blind cypress-caverns in the royal gardens, and down subterranean halls and steps, twelve of the most powerful sorcerers of Susran were brought together in a vault of oozing, death-grey granite, far beneath the foundations of the palace.What an opening scene! What irresistible imagery!

            "A dull, subsonic vibration, felt rather than heard, began to emanate from the magnets. It shook the vessel, ached in the voyagers\x{2019} tissues. Intently, with anxiety unbetrayed by their impassive features, they watched the slow, gradual building-up of power shown by gauge-dials on which giant needles crept like horologic hands, registering the reversed gravities <<one after one|10>>, till a drag equivalent to that of fifteen earths had been neutralized. The clamp of the solar gravitation, drawing them on with projectile-like velocity, crushing them to their seats with relentless increase of weight, was loosened. The needles crept on\x{2026} more slowly now\x{2026} to sixteen\x{2026} to seventeen\x{2026} and stopped. The Phosphor\x{2019}s fall had been retarded but not arrested. And the switches stood at their last notch.",

Dunlap was an attorney and historian who helped promote Smith\x{2019}s first book in 1912. Since Dunlap had attempted to hog all the credit for Smith\x{2019}s discovery, earning a rebuke from no less than Ambrose Bierce himself, Smith may not have been too well disposed toward Dunlap.",
