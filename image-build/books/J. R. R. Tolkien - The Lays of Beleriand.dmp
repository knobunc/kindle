            'In the matter of names, however, the poem presents great difficulty; for changes were made at quite different times and were not introduced consistently throughout. If the latest form in any particular passage is made the principle of choice, irrespective of any other consideration, then the text will have Morwin at lines 105, 129, Mavwin 137 etc., Morwen 438, 472; Ulmo 1469, but Ylmir 1529 and subsequently; Nirnaith Ornoth 1448, but Nirnaith Unoth 1543. If the later Nirnaith Onroth is adopted at <<1543|9c:0>>, it seems scarcely justifiable to intrude it at lines 13 and 218 (where the final form is Ninin Unothradin). I have decided finally to abandon overall consistency, and to treat individual names as seems best in the circumstances; for example, I give Ylmir rather than Ulmo at line 1469, for consistency with all the other occurrences, and while changing Unoth to Ornoth at line 1543 I retain Ornoth rather than the much later Arnediad at line 26 of the second version -- similarly I prefer the earlier Finweg to Fingon (I975, second version 19, 520) and Bansil, Glingol to Belthil, Glingal (2027 -- 8) . All such points are documented in the notes.',
