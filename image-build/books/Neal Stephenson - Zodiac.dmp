simple, stupid and obvious. We lifted the lid. We didn\'t have a manhole
cracker, but a big strong guy like Frank can do it with a prybar and a
chisel. We formed an assembly line, shoveling the cement and gravel
mixture into the gunny sacks and stacking them in the sewer line until
it was filled, top to bottom, side to side. Then we did it again so we
had a double-thickness wall. We even pounded a few segments of rebar
into it to make it all the stronger. By that time the sewer had backed
up about halfway and dioxin-laden juices were oozing out between the
sacks. I got sick because I\'d had three dozen red-hot chicken wings in

probably headed for Everett right now. When it got there, my favorite
environmentalist, Smirnoff, was going to blow it up. Laughlin and the
other bad guys would die. That was good. Our sailor friend, the skipper
and Boone would probably die too, though. And the evidence we wanted so
badly, the tank full of concentrated organophosphates down in the belly
of the ship, would become shrapnel. The PCB bugs would be gone from the
Harbor, with no way to trace them back to Basco. Pleshy would become
president of the United States and eight-year-old schoolchildren would
write him letters. My aunt would tell me what a great man he was and
military bands would precede him everywhere. And, what really hurt: Hoa

participant, was driving the car and Debbie was lying down in the back
seat. Tanya led the tail onto a twisting road that wasn\'t sympathetic
to the Lincoln Town Car following them. She thrashed the Omni for five
minutes or so, putting half a mile between herself and the private
dicks, then threw a 180 in the middle of the road - a skill she\'d
learned on snowy Maine roads last February while we were driving up to
Montreal to get some French fries. Debbie jumped out and crouched in
the ditch. Tanya took off and soon passed the Lincoln going the other
way. The private dicks in the Lincoln were forced to make an
eleven-point turn across the road, then peeled out trying to catch up

so Artemis had whipped up a couple of extra omelets, put them in a
cooler to keep them warm and was headed out to give these guys
breakfast. She took off flashing, glowing and smoking like a UFO, and
within a couple of minutes we could hear her greeting the coast guards
with an enthusiasm that was obscene at that time of the morning. They
greeted her right back. They knew one another from previous Blowfish
missions, and she liked to flirt with them over the radio. To them she
