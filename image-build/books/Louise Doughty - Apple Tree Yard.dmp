            "The clock at the back of the court reads <<3.50 p.m.|2a>> The air is thick. Everyone is tired, including the judge. I like the judge. He takes careful notes, raising his hand politely when he needs a witness to slow down. He blows his nose frequently, which makes him seem vulnerable. He is stern with the barristers but kindly to the jury. One of them stumbled over the words of the oath as she was sworn in and the judge smiled and nodded his head to her and said, \x{2018}Do please take as long as you like, Madam.\x{2019} I like the jury too. It seems like an acceptable cross-section to me; a slight predominance of women, three black people and six Asian, ages ranging from around twenty to mid-sixties. Hard to believe such an innocuous group of people might send me to prison; even harder to believe it now, while they are slumped in their seats. None of them are in the perky, upright pose they all adopted when the trial began, faces bright, filled with the adrenaline of their own significance. Like me, they were probably surprised at first that the courtroom hours are so short, <<ten in the morning|5>> at the earliest, until lunchtime, finishing no later than four. But we all understand now. It\x{2019}s the slowness of everything \x{2013} that\x{2019}s what\x{2019}s so exhausting: we are well into the trial now and weighed down by detail. They are feeling smothered. They don\x{2019}t understand what this young woman is driving at any more than I do.",

I have never tossed and turned night after night or spent weeks in a dreary fug of exhaustion, grey-faced and careful.
