14:00|fourteen|"Outside the skylight, it was a clear, cold April afternoon; the clocks of St Michael had just finished striking fourteen hundred, and in the Square of the Five Corners, the famous Duchess's Simulacrum was jerking through its eternal pantomime. The boredom grated on Martin. He found it difficult to adapt to the pace of events in the New Republic; it was doubly infuriating when he was faced with the eternal bureaucracy. He'd been here for four months now, four stinking months on a job which should have taken ten days. He was beginning to wonder if he would live to see Earth again before he died of old age."|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
18:00|1800|"Martin pulled on a dressing gown and opened the door a crack. The telegram was passed inside; he signed for it quickly, pulled out the contents, and passed back the signed envelope. Blinking and blearyeyed, he carried the message over to the window and pulled back the shutters to read it. It was a welcome surprise, if somewhat annoying to be woken for it—confirmation that his visa had been approved, his security vetting was complete, and that he was to report at 1800 that evening to the Navy beanstalk in South Austria for transit to the fleet shipyards in geosynchronous orbit."|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 06:00"|"six o'clock"|"""First."" If there was one thing that Martin had learned early, it was that the New Republic had some very strange ideas about class. He made up his mind. ""I need to arrive before six o'clock tonight. I will be back here in five minutes. If you would be so good as to have my itinerary ready by then…"""|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
12:00|noon|"His Imperial Majesty, the Emperor Ivan Hasek III, by grace of God the protector of the people of the New Republic, growled exasperatedly. ""Get the Admiral out of bed and make him presentable—I have a cabinet meeting at noon, and I need to talk to him now."""|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
"ap > 07:00"|"just past 0700"|"She rolled over, and blinked: the clock on the inside of her left eyelid said it was just past 0700. In another two hours, it would be time to get confirmation of her diplomatic status, dress, and go kick some New Republican ass. Two hours after that, Martin would be aboard the Lord Vanek; it would all be over by 2200. Rachel sighed and tried to catch another hour's shut-eye; but sleep was evading her."|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 05:09"|five-nine|"""Light particles!"" yelled Radar One. ""Big explosion off six M-klicks, bearing six-two by five-nine! Looks like—damn, one of the cruisers bought it. I'm getting a particle stream from astern! Bearing oneseven-seven by five, sidescatter, no range yet—"""|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 03:10"|"three hours and ten minutes"|"Rachel realized she had no intention of leaving him behind. With the realization came a sense of relief, because it left her only one course of action. She leaned forward and spoke quietly. ""Luggage: open sesame. Plan Titanic. You have three hours and ten minutes. Get started."" Now all she had to do was work out how to get him from the kangaroo court in the wardroom to her cabin; a different, but not necessarily harder task than springing him from the brig."|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Some days ago, the squadron had flipped end over end and executed a deceleration sequence to slow them down to 100 k.p.s. relative to Rochard's World. In the early hours of this morning, they had reached engagement velocity; they would drift the last thirty light-seconds, resuming acceleration (and increasing their visibility) only within active radar range of the enemy. Right now, they were about two million kilometers out. Some time around midnight, shipboard time, they would begin their closest approach to the planet, go to full power, and engage the enemy ships—assuming they were willing to come out and fight. (If they didn't, then the cowards had conceded control of the low orbital zone to the New Republic, tantamount to abandoning their ground forces.) In any event, any action against the UN inspector had to be completed before evening, when the ship would lock down for battle stations— assuming they didn't run into anything before then."|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"His eyes widened slightly. ""There won't be time for them to do anything before perigeon, anyway,"" she continued verbally. ""We're about two astronomical units out and closing fast; engagement should commence around midnight if there's to be a shooting war."" Got lifeboat, she added via Morse code. ""That's—"" he swallowed. How escape? he twitched. ""I'm not confident they're going to observe all the niceties. This kangaroo court—"" He shrugged."|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
12:00|noon|"By noon, the forest had changed beyond recognition. Some strange biological experiment had warped the vegetation. Trees and grass had exchanged leaves, so that now they walked on a field of spiny pine needles, while flat blades waved overhead; the leaves were piebald, black and green, with the glossy black spreading. Most disturbingly of all, the shrubbery seemed to be blurring at the edges, species exchanging phenotypic traits with unnatural promiscuous abandon. ""What's responsible for this?"" Burya asked Sister Seventh, during one of their hourly pauses."|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
"ap 02:50"|250|"""Odd—"" Mirsky's brow furrowed; he glanced at the doomsday clock. The battlecruiser was closing on the destination at a crawl, just 40 k.p.s. The enemy was heading toward them at better than 200 k.p.s., decelerating, but their thrust was dropping off—if this continued, closing unpowered at 250 k.p.s., their paths would intersect in about 500 seconds, and they'd be within missile-powered flight range 200 seconds before that. These long, ballistic shots weren't expected to cause real damage, but if they came close, they would force the enemy to respond. But missile one had been more than 50,000 kilometers from the target—"|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
00:00|midnight|"When Burya slept, he dreamed in rasterized false-color images, scanned from the rooftops of the capital. The revolution, eternally vigilant, multitasked on his lateral geniculate body, rousting slumbering synapses to recognize suspicious patterns of behavior. Burya found it both disturbing and oddly reassuring to see that the city, for all the changes wrought by the revolution, continued. Here a youth darted from shadow to shadow, evidently on a midnight assignation with his sweetheart; there a grimmer kind of conspiracy fomented, dogs fighting over the bones of temporal responsibility as a block warden stalked a resented houseowner with murder in his eye. Houses grew and fissioned in slow motion, great sessile beasts prodded hither and yon by their internal symbionts. It was all unspeakably alien to him: an eerie half-life crawling over the once-familiar city, echoes of the way he'd lived for years, lying like a corpse in an open casket. Even the searing light of a nighttime shuttle landing at the field outside the city couldn't bring it back to a semblance of the life he'd known."|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"

12:00|noon-day|"Robard and Lieutenant Kossov had borne their ancient charge to the control tower, cursing and sweating in the noon-day heat. As they arrived, Kurtz had thrown a fit; choking, gasping, choleric, thrashing in his wheelchair. Robard had feared for the worst, but then Dr. Hertz had come and administered a horse syringe full of adrenaline. The Admiral subsided, panting like a dog: and his left eye had opened and rolled sideways, to fix Robard with a skewed stare. ""What is it, sir? Is there anything I can get you?"""|"Singularity Sky"|"Charles Stross"
