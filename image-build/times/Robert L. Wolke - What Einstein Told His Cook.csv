It is a combination of two proteins, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, and therefore contains the same four calories per gram as any protein and, for that matter, the same four calories per gram as sugar. But since it’s so much sweeter than sucrose, only a tiny amount does the trick."|"What Einstein Told His Cook"|"Robert L. Wolke"

What if it’s only two o’clock in the afternoon when we arrive at the critical point in the recipe? How early can “overnight” begin? If we do leave it overnight, must we proceed with the recipe the moment the cock crows? What if we have to go to work in the morning? How do you stop something from standing, for heaven’s sake?"|"What Einstein Told His Cook"|"Robert L. Wolke"

I cracked it directly onto the 145ºF surface of an asphalt-paved parking lot at high noon. I didn’t use cooking oil, which might have cooled the surface too much. Then, I waited."|"What Einstein Told His Cook"|"Robert L. Wolke"
