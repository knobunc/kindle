"ap 01:00"|100|"Aspartame, which is 100 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose, is the main ingredient in NutraSweet and Equal. It is a combination of two proteins, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, and therefore contains the same four calories per gram as any protein and, for that matter, the same four calories per gram as sugar. But since it’s so much sweeter than sucrose, only a tiny amount does the trick."|"What Einstein Told His Cook"|"Robert L. Wolke"
"ap 03:50"|350|"Fortunately, the smoke points of several common cooking oils are higher than the most desirable range of temperatures for deep frying, which is 350–375º. If you’re not careful to control it, though, fat for deep frying can reach close to 400º, so there isn’t much leeway there. Except for the lowest-smoke-point cooking fat of all, unclarified butter, which begins to smoke at only 250–300º, smoke shouldn’t be a problem in sautéing unless you have a very heavy hand on the burner control."|"What Einstein Told His Cook"|"Robert L. Wolke"
14:00|"two o’clock in the afternoon"|"I’m with you. Why overnight? Are we to believe that daylight somehow interferes with the marinating process? What if it’s only two o’clock in the afternoon when we arrive at the critical point in the recipe? How early can “overnight” begin? If we do leave it overnight, must we proceed with the recipe the moment the cock crows? What if we have to go to work in the morning? How do you stop something from standing, for heaven’s sake?"|"What Einstein Told His Cook"|"Robert L. Wolke"
12:00|"high noon"|"Now it was time for the crucial experiment. I had previously taken an egg from the refrigerator and warmed it to room temperature. I cracked it directly onto the 145ºF surface of an asphalt-paved parking lot at high noon. I didn’t use cooking oil, which might have cooled the surface too much. Then, I waited."|"What Einstein Told His Cook"|"Robert L. Wolke"
