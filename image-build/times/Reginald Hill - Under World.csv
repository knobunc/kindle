"ap ~ 04:00"|"about four o’clock"|"‘Yes,’ said Wishart. ‘He was away, but his father wasn’t. Billy Farr was the last person to see, or admit seeing, Tracey alive. In fact, he was in the frame for a bit. He was an old friend of the Pedleys, it seems, and had taken a real shine to the little girl. He often used to take her off for walks, him, her, and his dog. They’d gone brambling that day up in … let’s see, here it is … Gratterley Wood, that runs along a ridge to the south of the village and there’s a track runs up to it behind the Miners’ Welfare Club where Tracey’s father was – still is – steward. Mrs Pedley expected them back about five for the little girl’s tea. But, according to Farr, Billy Farr that is, they were back within half an hour, about four o’clock. He said he wasn’t feeling too well, and that’s why instead of taking the girlie in as he usually did, he left her in the lane at the back of the club, just a few yards from the kitchen door. Trouble was, no one else saw her and there was no sighting of Billy Farr himself till he got home just before six, by which time the Pedleys were getting a bit agitated. Farr said he’d just been walking around by himself. Evidently he was like a man demented when he heard the girlie was missing, though demented with what wasn’t clear to a lot of people.’"|"Under World"|"Reginald Hill"

"ap 04:30"|four-thirty|"Wield stood at the counter, his face showing none of the bafflement he was feeling. It was Wattis that Pickford’s four-thirty appointment had been with. It was Wattis who had assured him that Pickford had not turned up. Naturally Wield had double-checked at the gatehouse. No one could enter the works without passing through here and signing the book. Donald Pickford’s name did not appear."|"Under World"|"Reginald Hill"

And off to the golf course like a flash if he got half a chance. Pickford must have been the last thing he had on his plate that day. He’d give him five minutes, then off. He went out just as Pickford came in. That’s how I recall the time. I glanced at the clock when Pickford said he had a four-thirty appointment. It was just gone four-forty. I told him it were too late. I said I’d ring through and see if they could fix up another day, but I tipped him the wink that it’d likely be a waste of time. You see, with Mr Wattis being so demob happy, no one treated him serious any more. You could be pretty certain any salesman they steered towards him wasn’t someone they intended doing business with! Pickford didn’t seem bothered, just said thanks and went off. So his name didn’t get in the book and the only person he saw at Tanyard-Lees was me, and no one ever asked me!’"|"Under World"|"Reginald Hill"
