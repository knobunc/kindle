"ap 03:00"|03:00|"Now for the math. The conflict with the USSR lasted from June 22, 1941, at 03:00, until, officially, May 8, 1945, at 23:01, which adds up to 3 years, 10 months, 16 days, 20 hours, and 1 minute, or, rounding off, to 46.5 months, 202.42 weeks, 1,417 days, 34,004 hours, or 2,040,241 minutes (counting the extra minute). For the program known as the “Final Solution,” we’ll use the same dates; before that, nothing had yet been decided or systematized, so Jewish casualties were for the most part incidental. Now let’s average out one set of figures with the other: for the Germans, this gives us 64,516 dead per month, or 14,821 dead per week, or 2,117 dead per day, or 88 dead per hour, or 1.47 dead per minute, on average for every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year for 3 years, 10 months, 16 days, 20 hours, and 1 minute. For the Jews, including the Soviet ones, we have about 109,677 dead per month, which is 25,195 dead per week, 3,599 dead per day, 150 dead per hour, or 2.5 dead per minute, over the same period. Finally, on the Soviet side, that gives us some 430,108 dead per month, 98,804 dead per week, 14,114 dead per day, 588 dead per hour, or 9.8 dead per minute, for the same period. Thus for the overall total in my field of activities we have an average of 572,043 dead per month, 131,410 dead per week, 18,772 dead per day, 782 dead per hour, and 13.04 dead per minute, every minute of every hour of every day of every week of every month of every year of the given period, which is, as you will recall, 3 years, 10 months, 16 days, 20 hours, and 1 minute. Let those who smirked at that admittedly somewhat pedantic extra minute please consider that it is worth an additional 13.04 dead, on average, and imagine, if they can, 13 people from their circle of friends killed in 1 minute. You can also calculate the length of time it takes to generate a fresh corpse: this gives us on average a dead German every 40.8 seconds, a dead Jew every 24 seconds, and a dead Bolshevik (Soviet Jews included) every 6.12 seconds, or on the whole a new dead body on average every 4.6 seconds, for the entirety of said period. You are now in a position to carry out, based on these numbers, concrete exercises of imagination. For example, stopwatch in hand, count off 1 death, 2 deaths, 3 deaths, etc., every 4.6 seconds (or every 6.12 seconds, or every 24 seconds, or every 40.8 seconds, if you have a marked preference), while trying to picture them lying there in front of you, those 1, 2, 3 dead. You’ll find it’s a good meditation exercise. Or take some more recent catastrophe that affected you strongly, and compare the two. For instance, if you are an American, consider your little Vietnam adventure, which so traumatized your fellow citizens. You lost 50,000 troops there in 10 years: that’s the equivalent of a little less than 3 days and 2 hours’ worth of dead on the Eastern Front, or of some 13 days, 21 hours, and 25 minutes’ worth of dead Jews. I obviously am not including the Vietnamese dead; since you never speak of them, in your books or TV programs, they must not count for much to you. Yet you killed 40 of them for every single one of your own dead, a fine effort even compared to our own, and one that certainly speaks for the value of technical progress. I’ll stop there, we could go on forever; I invite you to continue on your own, until the ground opens up beneath your feet. As for me, no need: for a long time already the thought of death has been closer to me than the vein in my neck, as that beautiful phrase in the Koran says. If you ever managed to make me cry, my tears would sear your face."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"ap 01:00"|one|"At the border they had set up a pontoon bridge. Just next to it, rising above the gray water of the Bug, the warped girders of the metal bridge the Soviets had dynamited lay in tangles. Our sappers had erected the new one in one night, we’d heard, and impassive Feldgendarmen, their crescent-shaped neck-plates reflecting the sun’s glare, controlled the traffic with self-assurance, as if they were still back home. The Wehrmacht had priority; we were told to wait. I contemplated the big lazy river, the quiet little woods on the other side, the throng on the bridge. Then it was our turn to cross and right on the other side there stretched out, like a boulevard, the wrecks of Russian equipment, trucks burned out and crumpled, tanks ripped open like tin cans, artillery carriages twisted like straw, overturned, swept aside, tangled up in an interminable burned strip made up of irregular heaps running alongside the road. Beyond, the woods gleamed in the splendid summer sun. The dirt road had been cleared but you could see traces of explosions along it, big oil slicks, scattered debris. Then came the first houses of Sokal. In the center of town, a few fires were still gently crackling; dust-covered corpses, most of them in civilian clothing, blocked part of the street, intermingled with ruins and rubble; and facing us, in the shade of a park, white crosses topped with curious little roofs formed a tidy line beneath the trees. Two German soldiers were painting names on them. We waited there while Blobel, accompanied by Strehlke, our supply officer, went to HQ. A sweetish smell, vaguely nauseating, intermingled with the acridity of the smoke. Soon Blobel returned: “It’s fine. Strehlke is taking care of the quarters. Follow me.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"I spent the next morning at the AOK: they had seized crates of documents when they captured the city, so I had to go with a translator and inspect these files, especially the ones from the NKVD, and decide which ones to deliver to the Sonderkommando for priority analysis. We were especially looking for lists of members of the Communist Party, of the NKVD, or other groups: many of those people must have stayed in town mixed in with the civilian population, to carry out acts of espionage or sabotage, so it was urgent to identify them. Around noon, I returned to the Academy to consult Dr. Kehrig. There was some agitation on the ground floor: groups of men were milling in the corners, whispering agitatedly. I caught a Scharführer by the sleeve: “What’s happening?”—“I don’t know, Obersturmführer. I think there’s a problem with the Standartenführer.”—“Where are the officers?” He pointed to a stairway that led to our quarters. On the way up, I met Kehrig, who was muttering as he came down, “This is insane, just insane.”—“What’s happening?” I asked him. He glanced at me gloomily and said, “How do you expect to work in such conditions?” He continued on his way. I climbed up a few more steps and heard a shot, the sound of broken glass, some shouts. On the landing in front of the open door of Blobel’s bedroom, two officers from the Wehrmacht were pacing furiously back and forth in front of Kurt Hans. “What’s happening?” I asked Hans. He gestured toward the room with his chin, his hands clenched behind his back. I went in. Blobel, sitting on his bed, wearing his boots but no jacket, was waving a pistol around; Callsen was standing next to him and trying without grasping his arm to direct the pistol toward the wall; a window pane had shattered; on the floor, I noticed a bottle of schnapps. Blobel was livid and spluttering incoherent words. Häfner came in behind me: “What’s happening?”—“I don’t know, it seems the Standartenführer is having a fit.”—“He’s gone nuts, you mean.” Callsen turned around: “Ah, Obersturmführer. Go ask the gentlemen from the Wehrmacht to excuse us and come back a little later, all right?” I stepped back and bumped into Hans, who had made up his mind to come in. “August, go find a doctor,” Callsen said to Häfner. Blobel was bawling: “It’s not possible, it’s not possible, they’re sick, I’m going to kill them.” The two officers from the Wehrmacht hovered in the hallway, rigid, pale. “Meine Herren…,” I began. Häfner pushed me aside and ran down the stairs. The Hauptmann squeaked: “Your Kommandant has gone mad! He wanted to shoot at us.” I didn’t know what to say. Hans went out behind me: “Meine Herren, I hope you’ll excuse us. The Standartenführer is suffering a breakdown and we have to call a doctor. We will have to resume this discussion later on.” In the bedroom, Blobel shouted piercingly: “I’m going to kill those shits, let me alone.” The Hauptmann shrugged: “If that’s what the senior officers of the SS are made of…. We’ll do without your cooperation.” He turned to his colleague, spreading his arms: “It’s not possible, they must have emptied the asylums.” Kurt Hans turned pale: “Meine Herren! The honor of the SS…” He too was bawling now. Finally I intervened and cut him off. “Listen, I don’t know what’s happening yet, but obviously we have a problem of a medical nature. Hans, it’s no use getting carried away. Meine Herren, as my colleague was saying, it might be better for you to excuse us for now.” The Hauptmann looked me up and down: “You are Dr. Aue, aren’t you? Fine, let’s go,” he said to his colleague. In the stairway they met Sperath, the doctor from the Sonderkommando, who was coming up with Häfner: “Are you the doctor?”—“Yes.”—“Be careful. He might shoot at you too.” I stood aside to let Sperath and Häfner pass, then followed them into the bedroom. Blobel had put his pistol on the night table and was speaking in a broken voice to Callsen: “But you can see that it’s not possible to shoot so many Jews. We need a plow, to plow them into the earth!” Callsen turned to us. “August, look after the Standartenführer for a minute, will you?” He took Sperath by the arm, drew him aside, and started whispering to him animatedly. “Shit!” Häfner cried. I turned and saw he was struggling with Blobel, who was trying to grab his pistol. “Standartenführer, Standartenführer, calm down, please,” I shouted. Callsen came back and began speaking to him calmly. Sperath also came over and took his pulse. Blobel made another move in the direction of his pistol but Callsen deflected him. Sperath spoke to him: “Listen, Paul, you’re overexerting yourself. I’m going to give you a shot.”—“No! No shots!” Blobel’s arm, flung up, hit Callsen in the face. Häfner had picked up the bottle and showed it to me, shrugging: it was almost empty. Kurt Hans remained by the door and watched without saying anything. Blobel let out almost incoherent exclamations: “It’s those shits from the Wehrmacht that should be shot! All of them!” then started muttering again. “August, Obersturmführer, come help me,” Callsen ordered. At the count of three, we took Blobel by the feet and under the arms and laid him down on the bed. He didn’t struggle. Callsen rolled his jacket into a ball and slid it under his head; Sperath rolled up his sleeve and gave him a shot. He was already starting to seem a little calmer. Sperath led Callsen and Häfner to the door to confer and I stayed next to Blobel. His bulging eyes were staring at the ceiling; a little saliva was wetting the corners of his mouth, and he was still mumbling: “Plow the Jews, plow the Jews.” Discreetly, I slipped the pistol into a drawer: no one had thought to do that. Blobel seemed already to have fallen asleep. Callsen returned to the bed: “We’re going to take him to Lublin.”—“Why Lublin?”—“There’s a hospital there, for this sort of case,” Sperath explained. “A madhouse, you mean,” Häfner blurted coarsely. “August, shut up,” barked Callsen. Von Radetzky appeared at the door: “What is this mess?” Kurt Hans spoke up: “The Generalfeldmarschall gave an order and the Standartenführer was ill, he wasn’t able to bear it. He wanted to shoot at the officers from the Wehrmacht.”—“He already had a fever this morning,” Callsen added. He briefly outlined the situation to von Radetzky, along with Sperath’s suggestion. “Fine,” von Radetzky decided, “we’ll do what the doctor says. I’ll take him myself.” He seemed a little pale. “As for the Generalfeldmarschall’s order, have you already started getting organized?”—“No, we haven’t done anything,” Kurt Hans said. “Fine. Callsen, you take care of the preparations. Häfner, you’ll come with me.”—“Why me?” Häfner retorted, his face darkening. “Because,” von Radetzky snapped with irritation. “Go get the Standartenführer’s Opel ready. Take some extra gas cans, just in case.” Häfner insisted: “Can’t Janssen go instead?”—“No, Janssen is going to help Callsen and Hans. Hauptsturmführer,” he said to Callsen, “do you agree?” Callsen shook his head pensively: “It might be better if you stayed and I went with him, Sturmbannführer. You’re in command, now.” Von Radetzky shook his head: “That’s why I think it would be better for me to go with him.” Callsen still seemed doubtful: “Are you sure you shouldn’t stay?”—“Yes, yes. In any case, don’t worry: Obergruppenführer Jeckeln is arriving soon, along with his staff. Most of them are already here; I’ve just had a meeting with them. He’ll take things in hand.”—“Good. Because, well, you understand, an Aktion of this magnitude, for me…” A thin smile played over von Radetzky’s lips: “Don’t worry. Go see the Obergruppenführer, and start your preparations: everything will go fine, I guarantee it.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 04:00"|"four o’clock"|"At four o’clock I got dressed. Höfler, the driver, was already waiting for me in the mess with some bad coffee. “If you like I also have some bread and cheese, Obersturmführer.”—“No, that’s okay, I’m not hungry.” I drank my coffee in silence. Höfler dozed. Outside, there wasn’t a sound. Popp, the soldier who was to serve as my escort, joined us and started eating noisily. I got up and went out to smoke in the courtyard. The sky was clear, the stars were shining above the tall façades of the former monastery, closed and impassive in the gentle white light. I couldn’t see the moon. Höfler came out and saluted me: “Everything’s ready, Obersturmführer.”—“Did you take some cans of gas?”—“Yes. Three.” Popp was standing next to the front door of the Admiral, looking awkward and content with his rifle on his shoulder. I motioned to him to get in back. “Usually, Obersturmführer, the escort sits in front.”—“Yes, but I’d rather you got in back.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
18:12|1812|"On the boulevard, the traffic crawled along at a snail’s pace, then a crowd blocked everything. I got out of the Opel to see what was happening. The people were yelling at the top of their lungs and applauding; some had taken chairs from a café or some crates and were standing on top of them to get a better look; others were carrying their children on their shoulders. I made my way through the press with difficulty. In the center of the crowd, in a large cleared circle, a few men were strutting about in costumes stolen from a theater or a museum—extravagant outfits, a Regency wig with a hussar’s jacket from 1812, a magistrate’s gown bordered with ermine, Mongolian armor and Scottish tartans, a half-Roman, half-Renaissance operetta costume, with a ruff; one man was wearing Budyenny’s red cavalry uniform, but with a top hat and a fur collar, and was waving a long Mauser pistol; all of them were armed with clubs or rifles. At their feet several men on their knees were licking the pavement; from time to time, one of the men in costume kicked them or hit them with the butt of his rifle; most of them were bleeding profusely; the crowd was screaming louder than ever. Behind me, someone started up a lively tune on the accordion; immediately, dozens of voices struck up the words, while the man in a kilt whipped out a violin on which, since he had no bow, he scraped out chords as on a guitar. A spectator pulled me by the sleeve and shouted at me excitedly, “Yid, yid, kaputt!” But I had already understood. I pulled away and went back through the crowd; Höfler, in the meantime, had turned the car around. “I think we can go that way,” the man from the Abwehr said, pointing to a side street. We soon found ourselves lost. Finally, Höfler had the idea of asking a passerby: “NKVD? NKVD?”—“NKVD kaputt!” the man shouted joyously. With gestures, he showed us the way: it was in fact two hundred meters from the AOK; we had gone in the wrong direction. I dismissed our guide and went in to report. Rasch, they told me, was in a meeting with all his Leiters and some army officers; no one knew when he could receive me. Finally a Hauptsturmführer came to my rescue: “You came here from Lutsk? We’ve already been filled in, the Brigadeführer spoke on the phone with Obergruppenführer Jeckeln. But I’m sure your report will interest him.”—“Good. I’ll wait, then.”—“No need, he’ll be tied up for at least two hours. You should just go visit the city. The old city especially is worth seeing.”—“The people seem excited,” I remarked.—“That’s certainly true. The NKVD massacred three thousand people in the prisons, before they decamped. And also all the Ukrainian and Galician nationalists have come out of the woods, or from wherever they were hiding, and they’re a little worked up. The Jews are going to get it bad.”—“And the Wehrmacht isn’t doing anything?” He winked: “Orders from above, Obersturmführer. The population is clearing out the traitors and collaborators, it’s none of our business. It’s an internal conflict. See you later, then.” He disappeared into an office and I went out. The gunfire coming from the center of town sounded like sticks of firecrackers on a holiday. I left Höfler and Popp with the Opel and headed on foot toward the main boulevard. Under the colonnade a jubilant atmosphere reigned; the doors and windows of the cafés had been thrown wide open, and people were drinking and shouting; people shook my hand in passing; a jovial man offered me a glass of Champagne, which I emptied; before I could return it to him, he had disappeared. Mixed in with the crowd, like at a carnival, men dressed in theater costumes were still parading; some were even wearing masks, amusing, hideous, ridiculous. I crossed the park; on the other side began the old town, entirely different from the Austro-Hungarian boulevard: here, it was all tall narrow houses from the late Renaissance, crowned with pointed roofs, their façades painted in various colors and long past their prime, enhanced with baroque ornaments carved out of stone. There were far fewer people in the narrow streets. A macabre poster filled the window of a closed store: it showed an enlargement of a photo of corpses, with an inscription in Cyrillic; I could only make out the words Ukraine and Jidy, the Jews. I walked by a great fine church, obviously Catholic; it was closed and no one answered when I knocked. From an open door farther down the street came sounds of broken glass, blows, shouts; a little farther on lay the corpse of a Jew, his nose in the gutter. Little groups of armed men wearing blue-and-yellow armbands were conversing with civilians; from time to time they went into a house and there were more noises, sometimes gunshots. Right before me, on the second floor, a man suddenly flew through a closed window and came crashing down almost at my feet in the midst of a rain of glass shards; I had to jump backward to avoid the splinters; I distinctly heard the brittle snap of his neck when he hit the pavement. A man in shirtsleeves and an officer’s cap leaned out of the broken window; seeing me, he joyfully shouted in broken German: “Excuse me, Herr deutschen Offizier! I didn’t see you.” My anguish increased; I passed around the corpse and continued on in silence. A little farther, a bearded man in a priest’s robe appeared from a portal, at the foot of a tall ancient belfry; when he saw me, he veered toward me: “Herr Offizier! Herr Offizier! Come, please come.” His German was better than that of the man at the window, but he had a strange accent. He pulled me almost by force toward the gate. I heard cries, wild shouts; in the courtyard of the church, a group of men were cruelly beating some Jews lying on the ground, with clubs or iron rods. Some of the bodies had stopped moving beneath the blows; others were still twitching. “Herr Offizier!” the priest shouted, “do something, please! It is a church, here.” I remained by the gate, unsure; the priest tried to pull me by the arm. I don’t know what I was thinking. One of the Ukrainians saw me and said something to his comrades, shaking his head in my direction; they hesitated, stopped their blows; the priest shouted a torrent of words at them that I didn’t understand, then turned toward me: “I told them that you were ordering them to stop. I told them that churches are sacred and that they were pigs, and that churches were under the protection of the Wehrmacht and that if they didn’t leave they’d be arrested.”—“I’m all alone,” I said.—“That’s not important,” the priest retorted. He shouted some more sentences in Ukrainian. Slowly, the men lowered their clubs. One of them addressed a passionate tirade at me: I understood only the words Stalin, Galicia, and Jews. Another one spat on the bodies. There was a long moment of uncertain wavering; the priest shouted a few words more; at last the men abandoned the Jews and headed toward the gate, then disappeared into the street, without saying a word. “Thank you,” the priest said to me, “thank you.” He ran over to examine the Jews. The courtyard sloped slightly, ending with a fine shaded colonnade roofed in green copper, built against the church wall. “Help me,” the priest said. “This one is still alive.” He lifted him up by the armpits and I took his feet; I saw that he was a young man, with hardly any beard. His head fell back, a stream of blood ran down his side curls and left a line of big shiny drops on the flagstones. My heart was beating very hard: I had never carried a dying man like this. We had to go around the church; the priest shuffled backward, moaning in German: “First the Bolsheviks, now the crazy Ukrainians. Why doesn’t your army do anything?” In the back, a wide archway opened onto another courtyard and then the door to the church. I helped the priest carry the Jew into the vestibule and put him on a bench. The priest called out; two other men, dark and bearded like him, but in suits, emerged from the nave. He spoke to them in a strange language that sounded nothing like Ukrainian, Russian, or Polish. I followed the three men as they went out together, into the courtyard; one of them turned into a back alleyway as the other two walked back toward the Jews. “I sent him to look for a doctor,” the priest said.—“What is this, here?” I asked him. He paused and stared at me: “It’s the Armenian cathedral.”—“So there are Armenians in Lemberg?” I said with surprise. He shrugged: “A lot longer than the Germans or the Austrians.” He and his friend lifted up another Jew, who was quietly moaning. The blood from the Jews flowed slowly along the flagstones of the sloping courtyard and down toward the colonnade. Under the arches I could see tombstones sealed into the wall or set in the ground, covered with inscriptions in mysterious glyphs, Armenian no doubt. I went closer: blood filled the characters cut into the flat stones. I quickly turned away. I felt oppressed, at a loss; I lit a cigarette. It was cool under the colonnade. In the courtyard, the sun shone on the puddles of fresh blood and the limestone paving, on the heavy bodies of the Jews, on their suits of coarse cloth, black or brown, soaked with blood. Flies were buzzing around their heads and landing on the wounds. The priest returned near them. “What about the dead?” he asked me. “We can’t leave them there.” But I had no intention of helping him; the idea of touching one of those inert bodies filled me with revulsion. I headed for the gate, skirting round them, and went out into the street. It was empty; I turned left, more or less at random. A little farther on, the street came to a dead end; but to the right I ended up in a square overlooked by an imposing baroque church decorated with rococo ornaments and a tall columned gate, and crowned with a copper dome. I climbed the steps and went in. The vast vault above the nave rested lightly on thin cabled columns; daylight poured in through the stained-glass windows, shimmered on the wooden sculptures covered in gold leaf; the dark, polished pews stretched to the back, empty. In a little whitewashed side hall I noticed a low door of ancient wood set with brass fittings: I pushed it; a few stone steps led to a wide, low hallway lit by casement windows. Glassed-in shelves occupied the opposite wall, filled with religious objects; some of them looked ancient, wonderfully wrought. To my surprise one of the cases exhibited Jewish objects: scrolls in Hebrew, prayer shawls, old etchings showing Jews in synagogue. Books in Hebrew bore printers’ marks in German: LWOW, 1884; LUBLIN, 1853, BEI SCHMUEL BERENSTEIN. I heard footsteps and raised my head: a tonsured monk was walking toward me. He wore the white habit of the Dominicans. When he reached me, he stopped: “Hello,” he said in German. “Can I help you?”—“What is this, here?”—“You are in a monastery.” I pointed to the shelves: “No, I mean all this.”—“That? It’s our museum of religions. All the objects come from the region. Look, if you like. Normally, we ask for a little donation, but today it’s free.” He went on his way and disappeared silently through the brass-fitted door. Farther on, where he had appeared, the hallway turned at a right angle; I realized I was in fact inside a cloister, closed in by a low wall, with windows set between the columns. A long horizontal display case caught my attention. A little lamp attached to the wall lit up the interior of the case; I leaned over: two skeletons were lying there intertwined, half emerging from a layer of dirt. The larger one, the man probably, despite the large brass earrings resting against his skull, was lying on his back; the other, visibly a woman, was curled up on her side, nestled in his arms, her legs over one of his. It was magnificent, I had never seen anything like it. I tried in vain to make out the label. How many centuries had they been lying there, intertwined with each other? These bodies must have been very old, they must have gone back to the most remote eras; the woman had probably been sacrificed and laid out in the tomb with her dead chief; I knew such practices had existed in primitive times. But this knowledge didn’t change anything; despite everything, it was the position of rest after love, overcome, filled with tenderness. I thought of my sister and my throat tightened: she would have cried if she’d seen that. I left the monastery without meeting anyone; outside I headed straight, toward the other end of the square. Beyond that another vast square opened up, with a large building in the center, next to a tower, surrounded by trees. Narrow houses were squeezed around this square, fabulously decorated, each in a different style. Behind the main building an animated crowd was gathering. I avoided it and turned left, then went round a large cathedral, below a stone cross lovingly held in the arms of an angel, flanked by a languid Moses with his tablets and a pensive saint dressed in rags, raised over a skull and crossbones, almost the same emblem as the one sewn on my cap. Behind, in a little alleyway, stood a few tables and chairs. I was hot and tired, the café seemed empty, I sat down. A girl came out and spoke to me in Ukrainian. “Do you have beer? Beer?” I said in German. She shook her head: “Piva nyetou.” That I understood. “Some coffee? Kava?”—“Da.”—“Voda?”—“Da.” She went back into the room and returned with a glass of water that I drank in one gulp. Then she brought me a coffee. It was already sweetened and I didn’t drink it. I lit a cigarette. The girl reappeared and saw the coffee: “Coffee? Not good?” she asked in broken German. “Sugar. Niet.”—“Oh.” She smiled, took the coffee away, and brought me another. It was strong, without any sugar; I drank it while I smoked. To my right, at the foot of the cathedral, a chapel covered in bas-reliefs arranged in dark bands hid my view of the main square. A man in German uniform was walking round it, examining the intertwined sculptures. He noticed me and headed toward me; I saw his epaulettes, got up quickly, and saluted. He returned my salute: “Hello! So, you’re German?”—“Yes, Herr Hauptmann.” He got out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead. “Oh good. Do you mind if I sit down?”—“Of course not, Herr Hauptmann.” The girl reappeared. “Do you take your coffee with or without sugar? It’s all they have.”—“With, please.” I made the girl understand we wanted two more coffees, with sugar on the side. Then I sat down with the Hauptmann. He held out his hand: “Hans Koch. I’m with the Abwehr.” I introduced myself. “Oh, you’re from the SD? That’s right, I hadn’t noticed your badge. Very good, very good.” This Hauptmann seemed mild and friendly: he must have been just past fifty, wore round glasses and was a little paunchy. He spoke with a southern accent, not quite Viennese. “You are Austrian, Herr Hauptmann?”—“Yes, from Styria. And you?”—“My father is from Pomerania, originally. But I was born in Alsace. Then we lived here and there.”—“Of course, of course. Are you out for a walk?”—“Sort of, yes.” He nodded: “I’m here for a meeting. Over there, next door, in a little while.”—“A meeting, Herr Hauptmann?”—“See, when they invited us, they explained that it would be a cultural meeting, but I think it’s going to be a political meeting.” He leaned toward me as if to tell me a secret: “I was picked because I’m supposed to be an expert on Ukrainian national questions.”—“And are you?” He flung himself back: “Not at all! I’m a professor of theology. I know a thing or two about the Uniate question, but that’s it. They probably appointed me because I served in the Imperial army, I was a Leutnant during the Great War, so they must have thought that I knew something about the national question; but I was on the Italian front at the time, and in the Supply Corps too. It’s true that I had some Croatian colleagues…”—“You speak Ukrainian?”—“Not a single word. But I have a translator with me. He’s drinking now with the OUN guys, in the square.”—“The OUN?”—“Yes. You didn’t know they took over, this morning? At least, they took over the radio. And they’ve delivered a proclamation, on the revival of the Ukrainian state if I understood right. That’s why I have to go to this meeting now. The Metropolitan, I heard, has blessed the new State. It seems we’re the ones who asked him to do so, but I’m not sure.”—“What Metropolitan?”—“The Uniate, of course. The Orthodox hate us. They hate Stalin too, but they hate us even more.” I was about to ask another question but was suddenly interrupted: a rather plump woman, almost naked, her stockings torn, emerged suddenly with a cry from behind the cathedral; she plowed into the tables, stumbled, knocked one over, and fell at our feet squealing. Her white skin was marbled with contusions, but she wasn’t bleeding much. Two strapping youths with armbands were calmly following her. One of them spoke to us in bad German: “Excuse, Officers. Kein problem.” The other dragged the woman up by her hair and punched her in the stomach. She hiccupped and fell silent, saliva on her lips. The first one kicked her in the buttocks and she started running again. They trotted after her, laughing, and disappeared behind the chapel. Koch took off his cap and wiped his forehead again while I picked up the overturned table. “They’re real savages here,” I remarked.—“Oh yes, I agree with you on that one. But I thought you were encouraging them?”—“That would surprise me, Herr Hauptmann. But I’ve just arrived, I haven’t been filled in.” Koch went on: “At the AOK, I heard that the Sicherheitsdienst had posters printed and was encouraging these people. Aktion Petliura, they called it. You know, the Ukrainian leader? It was a Jew that assassinated him, I think. In ’twenty-six or ’twenty-seven.”—“You see, you are a specialist after all.”—“Oh, I’ve just read a few reports.” The girl had emerged from the café. She smiled and showed me that the coffee was free. In any case I didn’t have any local money. I looked at my watch: “Excuse me, Herr Hauptmann. I have to go.”—“Of course.” He shook my hand: “Good luck.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 05:00"|5|"The result of all this was a typical order from Reichenau: referring to our necessary executions of criminals, Bolsheviks, and essentially Jewish elements, he forbade soldiers in the Sixth Army, without orders from a superior officer, from attending, photographing, or participating in the actions. In itself that would probably not have changed much, but Rasch ordered us to conduct the actions outside the towns, and to set a cordon on the perimeter to prevent the presence of spectators. Discretion, it seemed, would henceforth be the rule of the day. But the desire to see these things was also human. Leafing through my Plato, I had found the passage of The Republic that my reaction in front of the corpses in the Lutsk fortress had brought to mind: Leontius, the son of Aglaion, coming up one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside, observed, near the executioner, some dead bodies lying on the ground; and he felt a desire to look at them, and at the same time loathing the thought he tried to turn away. For a time he struggled with himself, and covered his eyes, till at length, overcome by the desire, he forced his eyes wide open with his fingers, and running up to the bodies, exclaimed, “There! you devils! gaze your fill at the beautiful spectacle!” To tell the truth, the soldiers rarely seemed to feel Leontius’s anguish, only his desire, and it must have been this that was disturbing the hierarchy, the idea that the men could take pleasure in these actions. Still, everyone who participated in them took some form of pleasure in them—that seemed obvious to me. Some, visibly, enjoyed the act itself, but these could be regarded as sick men, and it was right to ferret them out and give them other tasks, even punish them if they overstepped the bounds. As for the others, whether the actions repelled them or left them indifferent, they carried them out from a sense of duty and obligation, and thus drew pleasure from their devotion, from their ability to carry out such a difficult task despite their disgust and apprehension: “But I take no pleasure in killing,” they often said, finding their pleasure, then, in their rigor and their righteousness. The hierarchy, obviously, had to consider these problems as a whole; the solutions could necessarily only be approximate or rough. Einzelaktionen, of course, individual actions, were rightly regarded as murders and were condemned. Berück von Roques had promulgated an interpretation of the OKW order on discipline, imposing a sixty-day confinement, for insubordination, on soldiers who shot Jews on their own initiative; in Lemberg, I had heard, a noncom had received six months in prison for the murder of an old Jewish woman. But as the actions became more widespread, it became increasingly difficult to control all their repercussions. On August 11 and 12, Brigadeführer Rasch gathered all his Sonderkommando and Einsatzkommando leaders together: besides Blobel, there were Hermann from 4b, Schulz from 5 and Kroeger from 6. Jeckeln came too. Blobel’s birthday was on the thirteenth, and the officers had decided to throw him a party. During the day, he seemed in an even more execrable mood than usual, and spent long hours alone, locked up in his office. I myself was rather busy: we had just received an order from Gruppenführer Müller, the head of the Gestapo, to collect visual materials on our activities—photographs, films, posters, notices—to send to the Führer. I had gone to negotiate a small budget with Hartl, the administrator of the Gruppenstab, so as to buy copies of their photos from the men; he had started out by refusing, alleging an order from the Reichsführer forbidding members of the Einsatzgruppen to profit from executions in any way whatsoever; and for him, the sale of photographs constituted a profit. I finally managed to convince him that we couldn’t ask the men to finance the Group’s work out of their own pockets, and that we had to defray the expenses of printing the images we wanted to archive. He accepted, but on condition that we pay only for the photos of noncommissioned officers and soldiers; officers should reprint their photos at their own expense, if they took any. Armed with this agreement, I spent the rest of the day in the barracks, examining the men’s collections and ordering prints. Some of them were remarkably accomplished photographers; but their work left me with an unpleasant aftertaste, and at the same time I couldn’t take my eyes away from it, I was stunned. At night, the officers gathered in the mess, decorated for the occasion by Strehlke and his adjuncts. When Blobel joined us, he had already been drinking; his eyes were bloodshot, but he controlled himself and didn’t speak much. Vogt, who was the oldest officer, presented him our best wishes and led the toast for his health; then he was asked to speak. He hesitated, then put down his glass and addressed us, his hands clasped behind his back. “Meine Herren! Thank you for your good wishes. Know that your confidence means a lot to me. I have to share some bad news with you. Yesterday, the HSSPF Russland-Süd, Obergruppenführer Jeckeln, delivered us a new order. This order came directly from the Reichsführer-SS and emanates, I want to emphasize this for you as he emphasized it for us, from the Führer himself.” As he spoke, he winced; between phrases, he chewed the inside of his cheeks. “Our actions against the Jews will henceforth have to include the entire population. There will be no exceptions.” The officers present reacted with consternation; several started talking at the same time. Callsen’s voice rose, incredulous: “All of them?”—“All of them,” Blobel confirmed.—“But look, that’s impossible,” Callsen said. He seemed to be begging. I remained silent; I felt a great coldness come over me; Oh Lord, I was saying to myself, now that too must be done, it has been spoken, and we’ll have to go through that too. I felt invaded by a boundless horror, but I remained calm, nothing showed through, my breathing remained even. Callsen continued his objections: “But, Standartenführer, most of us are married, we have children. They can’t ask us to do that.”—“Meine Herren,” Blobel snapped in a brutal but toneless voice, “this is a direct order from our Führer, Adolf Hitler. We are National Socialists and SS men, and we will obey. Understand this: in Germany, the Jewish question was able to be resolved, fully resolved, without excesses and in a manner in keeping with the requirements of humanity. But when we conquered Poland we inherited three million additional Jews. No one knows what to do with them or where to put them. Here, in this immense country, where we are waging a pitiless war of destruction against the Stalinist hordes, from the beginning we have had to take radical measures to ensure the security of our rear. I think you have all understood their necessity and efficacy. Our forces are not sufficient to patrol each village and at the same time wage battle; and we cannot allow ourselves to leave such treacherous, such sly potential enemies behind us. At the Reichssicherheitshauptamt, the possibility is being discussed, once the war is won, of gathering all Jews into a large reservation in Siberia or in the North. There, they’ll be peaceful, and we will be too. But first we have to win the war. We have already executed thousands of Jews and there are still tens of thousands left; the more our forces advance, the more there will be. Now, if we execute only the men, there will be no one left to feed the women and their children. The Wehrmacht doesn’t have the resources to feed tens of thousands of useless Jew females along with their brats. Nor can we leave them to die of hunger: those are Bolshevik methods. To include them in our actions, along with their husbands and their sons, is in fact the most humane solution given the circumstances. What’s more, experience has taught us that the more procreative Eastern Jews are the original breeding ground from which the forces of Judeo-Bolshevism as well as of the capitalist plutocracy are constantly renewed. If we let some of them survive, those products of natural selection will be the source of a renewal even more dangerous for us than the present peril. The Jewish children of today are the saboteurs, the partisans, the terrorists of tomorrow.” The officers were silent, glum; Kehrig, I noticed, was downing glass after glass. Blobel’s bloodshot eyes glistened through the veil of alcohol. “We are all National Socialists,” he continued, “SS men in the service of our Volk and our Führer. I remind you that Führerworte haben Gesetzeskraft, the Führer’s word has the force of law. You must resist the temptation to be human.” Blobel was not a very intelligent man; these striking sentences had certainly not originated from him. But he believed in them; even more important, he wanted to believe in them, and he was offering them in turn to those who needed them, those to whom they could be of use. For me, they weren’t much use; I would have to work out my reasoning on my own. But it was hard for me to think about it; my head was buzzing with an intolerable pressure, I wanted to go to sleep. Callsen was fiddling with his wedding ring, I was sure he didn’t realize it; he wanted to say something, but changed his mind. “A Schweinerei, this is a grosse Schweinerei,” Häfner muttered, and no one contradicted him. Blobel seemed drained, out of ideas, but everyone could feel that his will was holding us and wouldn’t let us go, just as other wills held him. In a State like ours, everyone had his assigned role: You, the victim, and You, the executioner, and no one had a choice, no one asked anyone’s consent, since everyone was interchangeable, victims as well as executioners. Yesterday we had killed Jewish men, tomorrow it would be women and children, the day after tomorrow yet others; and after we had fulfilled our role, we would be replaced. Germany, at least, did not liquidate its executioners; on the contrary, it took care of them, unlike Stalin with his mania for purges; but that too was part of the logic of things. For the Russians, as for us, man counted for nothing; the nation, the State were everything; and in this sense we saw our reflection in each other. The Jews too had this strong feeling of community, of Volk: they mourned their dead, buried them if they could and said Kaddish; but as long as one single Jew remained alive, Israel lived. That, no doubt, was the reason they were our privileged enemies, they resembled us too much."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

For me, they weren’t much use; I would have to work out my reasoning on my own. But it was hard for me to think about it; my head was buzzing with an intolerable pressure, I wanted to go to sleep. Callsen was fiddling with his wedding ring, I was sure he didn’t realize it; he wanted to say something, but changed his mind. “A Schweinerei, this is a grosse Schweinerei,” Häfner muttered, and no one contradicted him. Blobel seemed drained, out of ideas, but everyone could feel that his will was holding us and wouldn’t let us go, just as other wills held him. In a State like ours, everyone had his assigned role: You, the victim, and You, the executioner, and no one had a choice, no one asked anyone’s consent, since everyone was interchangeable, victims as well as executioners. Yesterday we had killed Jewish men, tomorrow it would be women and children, the day after tomorrow yet others; and after we had fulfilled our role, we would be replaced. Germany, at least, did not liquidate its executioners; on the contrary, it took care of them, unlike Stalin with his mania for purges; but that too was part of the logic of things. For the Russians, as for us, man counted for nothing; the nation, the State were everything; and in this sense we saw our reflection in each other. The Jews too had this strong feeling of community, of Volk: they mourned their dead, buried them if they could and said Kaddish; but as long as one single Jew remained alive, Israel lived. That, no doubt, was the reason they were our privileged enemies, they resembled us too much."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap < 06:00"|"A little before six o’clock"|"A little before six o’clock, the sun set and Blobel ordered a break for the night: the shooters couldn’t see anymore in any case. He held a quick meeting, standing behind the ravine among his officers, to discuss the problems. Thousands of Jews were still waiting in the square and on Melnikova Street; according to calculations, almost twenty thousand had already been shot. Several officers complained about the condemned being sent over the edge of the ravine: when they saw the scene at their feet, they panicked and became difficult to control. After some discussion, Blobel decided to have engineers from the Ortskommandantur dig entrances into the small ravines that led to the main one, and to have the Jews come in that way; then they wouldn’t see the bodies until the last minute. He also ordered the dead to be covered over with quicklime. We returned to our quarters. On the square in front of Lukyanovskoe, hundreds of families were waiting, sitting on their suitcases or on the ground. Some had made fires and were preparing their food. In the street it was the same thing: the line stretched back to the city, guarded by a thin cordon. The next morning, at dawn, it began again. But I don’t think it is necessary to continue the description."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
12:00|noon|"Once again, I slept poorly; that seemed to be the rule in Pereyaslav. The men grunted and snored; as soon as I dozed off, the teeth-grinding of the little Waffen-SS cut into my sleep and pulled me out of it abruptly. In this groggy drowsiness, Ott’s face in the water and the skull of the Russian soldier became confused: Ott, lying in the puddle, opened his mouth wide and stuck his tongue out at me, a thick, pink, fresh tongue, as if he were inviting me to kiss him. I awoke anxious, tired. Over breakfast, once again I was overcome with coughing, then with violent retching; I slipped out to an empty hallway, but nothing came up. When I went back to the table, Häfner was waiting for me with a teletype: “Kharkov has just fallen, Hauptsturmführer. The Standartenführer is waiting for you in Poltava.”—“In Poltava?” I pointed to the sodden windows. “He has to be kidding. How does he expect me to get there?”—“The trains are still running, from Kiev to Poltava. When the partisans don’t derail them. There’s a Rollbahn convoy that’s leaving for Yagotin; I called the division, they said they’ll take you. Yagotin is on the railroad, so from there you can get a train.” Häfner was truly an efficient officer. “Fine, I’ll go tell my driver.”—“No, your driver will stay here. That Admiral will never get as far as Yagotin. You’ll travel with the Rollbahn in one of their trucks. I’ll send the driver with the car back to Kiev when it’s possible.”—“Fine.”—“The convoy leaves at noon. I’ll give you some dispatches for the Standartenführer, including the report about Ott’s death.”—“Fine.” I went to get my kit ready. Then I sat down at a table and wrote a letter to Thomas, straightforwardly describing the previous day’s incident: You discuss this with the Brigadeführer, since I know Blobel won’t do anything, aside from covering himself. We have to learn from this, otherwise it might happen again. After I finished the letter, I sealed it in an envelope and put it aside. Then I went to find Ries. “Tell me, Ries, your little child-soldier, there, the one who grates his teeth. What’s his name?”—“You mean Hanika? Franz Hanika. The one I showed you?”—“Yes, him. Can you give him to me?” He raised his eyebrows, taken aback. “Give him to you? Why?”—“I’m leaving my driver here; I left my orderly in Kiev, so I need another one. And in Kharkov I can have him put up in a separate room, that way he won’t bother anyone anymore.” Ries seemed delighted: “Listen, Hauptsturmführer, if you’re serious…I’m all for it. I’ll go ask the Obersturmführer; I don’t think he’ll have any objections.”—“Fine. I’ll go tell this Hanika.” I found him in the mess, where he was scouring pots. “Hanika!” He stood at attention and I saw he had a bruise on one cheek. “Yes?”—“I’m leaving for Poltava and then Kharkov. I need an orderly. Do you want to come?” His strained face lit up: “With you?”—“Yes. Your work won’t change much, but at least you won’t have the others on your back.” He looked radiant, like a child who has just received an unexpected present. “Go get your things ready,” I said to him."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
12:00|noon|"It was the end of November; on the vast circular square, rebaptized Adolf-Hitler-Platz, a gray snow, pale as motes of light, was falling softly from the noon sky. A woman was hanging by a long rope from Lenin’s outstretched hand; some children playing beneath raised their heads to look up her skirt. The hanged were increasingly numerous; the Ortskommandant had ordered that they remain strung up, to set an example. Russian passersby walked quickly in front of them, their heads lowered; German soldiers and children examined them curiously, and the soldiers often photographed them. For several days now I had stopped vomiting, I was beginning to hope I was getting better; but it was only a respite; and when it took me again, I vomited up my sausage, cabbage, and beer, an hour after the meal, in the street, half hidden in an alleyway. A little farther on, at the corner of the Trade Unions Park, they had raised a gallows, and that day they were leading two very young men and a woman there, their hands tied behind their backs, surrounded by a crowd made up mainly of German soldiers and officers. The woman had a large sign around her neck explaining that she was being punished in retaliation for a murder attempt on an officer. Then they hanged them. One of the young men looked dumbfounded, astonished at finding himself there; the other was simply sad; the woman grimaced terribly when they snatched the support out from under her feet, but that was all. God alone knows if they had in fact been involved in the attack; we were hanging almost anyone, Jews but also Russian soldiers, people without identity papers, peasants loitering in search of food. The idea was not to punish the guilty but to prevent new attacks by spreading terror. In Kharkov itself, it seemed to work; there had been no more explosions since the hangings. But outside the city the situation was getting worse. Oberst von Hornbogen, the Ic from the Ortskommandantur whom I often visited, had a large map on his wall of the area around Kharkov dotted with red push-pins, each representing a partisan attack or a bombing. “It’s becoming a real problem,” he explained to me. “We can only leave the city in force; isolated men get shot like rabbits. We raze all the villages where we find partisans, but that’s not helping much. Food supplies are getting difficult, even for the troops; as for feeding the population this winter, it doesn’t even bear thinking about.” The city had about six hundred thousand inhabitants; there were no public food supplies, and already the elderly were dying of hunger. “Could you tell me about your discipline problems, if you don’t mind,” I asked the Oberst, with whom I had already developed fairly good relations.—“It’s true, we’re having difficulties. Especially cases of looting. Some soldiers emptied the apartment of the Russian mayor while he was visiting us. A lot of soldiers are taking coats or fur hats from the populace. There are also some cases of rape. A Russian woman was locked up in a basement and raped by six soldiers, one after the other.”—“What do you attribute that to?”—“A question of morale, I guess. The troops are exhausted, dirty, covered with vermin, they’re not even being provided with clean underwear, and also winter is coming, they sense it’s going to get worse.” He leaned forward with a faint smile: “Between you and me, I can tell you that they’ve even painted some inscriptions on the AOK buildings, in Poltava. Things like We want to go back to Germany or We’re dirty and we have lice and we want to go home. The Generalfeldmarschall was mad with rage, he took it as a personal insult. Of course, he realizes there are tensions and privations, but he thinks the officers could do more for the political education of the men. But ultimately, the most worrisome thing is still the problem of the food supplies.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 11:00"|"around eleven o’clock"|"Hohenegg’s brandy turned out to be a poor choice of after-dinner drink: back in my room, I vomited up my dinner. The retchings caught me so quickly I barely had the time to reach the bathtub. Since I had already digested, it was easy to rinse out; but it had a bitter, acidic, revolting taste; I preferred to vomit my meals right away, it came up more painfully and with more difficulty, but at least it didn’t have any taste, or else it tasted like food. I thought about returning to have another drink with Hohenegg, to ask his advice; but finally I just washed out my mouth with water, smoked a cigarette, and went to bed. The next day, I had to go to the Kommando to pay a courtesy visit; they were also expecting Oberführer Bierkamp. I went there around eleven o’clock. From the lower part of town, on the boulevard, you could clearly see, in the distance, the jagged peaks of the Beshtau, rising like a guardian idol; it hadn’t rained, but the air was still fresh. At the Kommando, they told me that Müller was busy with Bierkamp. I waited on the steps of the little courtyard, watching one of the drivers wash the mud off the bumpers and wheels of the Saurer truck. The rear door was open: out of curiosity, I went over to it to look inside, since I hadn’t yet seen what it looked like; I recoiled and immediately began coughing; it was foul, a stinking pool of vomit, excrement, urine. The driver noticed my reaction and said a few words to me in Russian: “Griaznyi, kazhdi raz,” but I didn’t understand the words. An Orpo, probably a Volksdeutscher, came over and translated: “He says that it’s always like that, Hauptsturmführer, very dirty, but they’re going to modify the interior, have the floor slope down, and put a little trapdoor in the middle. That will make it easier to clean out.”—“Is he a Russian?”—“Who, Zaitsev? He’s a Cossack, Hauptsturmführer, we have several of them.” I went back to the steps and lit a cigarette; just at that instant I was summoned, and had to throw it away. Müller received me together with Bierkamp. I saluted him and introduced my mission in Pyatigorsk. “Yes, yes,” Müller said, “the Oberführer explained it to me.” They asked me some questions and I talked about the feeling of pessimism that seemed to be reigning among the army officers. Bierkamp shrugged: “The soldiers have always been pessimists. Already, when it came to the Rhineland and the Sudetenland, they were wailing like sissies. They have never understood the strength of the Führer’s will and of National Socialism.—Tell me something else, have you heard this story about a military government?”—“No, Oberführer. What is it?”—“A rumor is circulating to the effect that the Führer has approved of a military government for the Caucasus, instead of a civilian administration. But we can’t manage to get any official confirmation. At the OKHG they’re very evasive.”—“I’ll try to find out more at the AOK, Oberführer.” We exchanged a few more remarks and I took my leave. In the hallway, I met Turek. He gave me a sardonic, angry look and said with incredible rudeness: “Ah, the Papiersoldat. Don’t worry, your turn will come.” Bierkamp must have talked to him. I answered him amiably, with a little smile: “Hauptsturmführer, I’m at your service.” He stared at me for an instant with a furious look, then disappeared into an office. There, I said to myself, you’ve made yourself an enemy; that’s not so hard."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"< 12:00"|"toward noon"|"Voss deemed this conversation quite comical when I reported it to him. “It was about time! Nothing like failure to sharpen the wits.” We had met as agreed, on Sunday, toward noon, in front of the Feldkommandantur. A troop of kids was clustered around the barricades, fascinated by the motorcycles and an amphibious Schwimmwagen parked there. “Partisans!” bellowed a territorial who was vainly trying to scatter them with a stick; no sooner were they chased away from one side than they streamed in on the other, and the reservist was already out of breath. We climbed the steep slope of Karl Marx Street, toward the museum, and I finished summing up Bräutigam’s remarks. “Better late than never,” Voss commented, “but in my opinion it won’t work. We’ve developed too many bad habits. This business with the military administration is just a grace period. In six or ten months they’ll have to hand over the reins, and then all the jackals being kept on the leash will pour in, the Schickedanzes, the Körners, the Sauckel-Einsatzes, and all hell will break loose again. You see, the problem is that we don’t have a colonial tradition. Even before the Great War, we were managing our African possessions very badly. And then afterward, we didn’t have any more possessions at all, and the little bit of experience we had accumulated in colonial administration was lost. Just compare us to the English: look at the delicacy, the tact with which they govern and exploit their empire. They know very well how to wield the stick when they have to, but they always offer the carrot first, and go back to the carrot right after they hit with the stick. Even the Soviets, at bottom, have done better than us: despite their brutality, they were able to create a feeling of a shared identity, and their empire is holding. The troops that kept us in check on the Terek were made up mostly of Georgians and Armenians. I’ve spoken with some Armenian prisoners: they think of themselves as Soviet, and fight for the USSR without hesitation. We haven’t been able to offer them anything better.” We had arrived at the green door of the museum and I knocked. After a few minutes the vehicle gate, a little higher up, opened a little, giving us a glimpse of an old wrinkled peasant wearing a cap, his beard and callous fingers yellowed by makhorka. He exchanged a few words with Voss, then pulled the gate open a little more. “He says the museum is closed, but if we like, we can come in and look. Some German officers live here, in the library.” The gate opened onto a little paved courtyard, surrounded by charming little whitewashed buildings; on the right, a second floor had been built over a shed, with a staircase outside; the library was there. In the background rose the Mashuk, omnipresent, massive, tatters of clouds clinging to its eastern slope. To the left, lower down, you could see a little garden, with vines on a trellis, then some other buildings, their roofs covered with thatch. Voss climbed the steps to the library. Inside, the varnished wooden shelves took up so much space that you could barely slip past them. The old man had followed us; I handed him three cigarettes; his face lit up, but he remained near the door, watching us. Voss examined the books through the glass but didn’t touch anything. My gaze came to rest on a little oil portrait of Lermontov, rather nicely done: he was represented in a red dolman decked with epaulettes and gilt braid, his lips moist, his eyes surprisingly anxious, wavering between rage, fear, and unbridled mockery. In another corner hung an engraved portrait, under which I could just make out an inscription in Cyrillic: this was Martynov, Lermontov’s killer. Voss was trying to open one of the cases, but it was locked. The old man said something and they conversed a little. “The curator has run away,” Voss translated for me. “One of the employees has the keys, but she isn’t in today. Too bad, they have some nice things.”—“You’ll be back.”—“Certainly. Come, he’s going to open Lermontov’s house for us.” We crossed the courtyard and the little garden to reach one of the low houses. The old man pushed open the door; inside, it was dark, but the light let in by the opening was enough to see by. The walls had been whitewashed, and the furniture was simple; there were some beautiful oriental carpets and Caucasian sabers hanging from nails. A narrow sofa looked very uncomfortable. Voss had paused in front of a desk and was stroking it with his fingers. The old man explained something to him. “He wrote A Hero of Our Time at this table,” Voss translated pensively.—“Right here?”—“No, in St. Petersburg. When the museum was created, the government had the table sent here.” There was nothing else to see. Outside, clouds were veiling the sun. Voss thanked the old man, and I gave him a few more cigarettes. “We’ll have to come back when there’s someone who can explain everything,” said Voss. “By the way,” he added at the gate, “I forgot to tell you: Professor Oberländer is here.”—“Oberländer? But I know him. I met him in Lemberg, at the beginning of the campaign.”—“All the better. I was going to suggest we have dinner with him.” In the street, Voss turned left, toward the wide flagstone-paved lane that started at Lenin’s statue. The path kept rising; I was short of breath already. Instead of leaving the lane to head for the Aeolian Harp and the Academic Gallery, Voss kept going straight ahead, along the Mashuk, on a paved road that I hadn’t yet taken. The sky was darkening rapidly and I was afraid it would rain. We passed a few sanatoriums, then the pavement ended and we continued on a wide dirt path. This place was not much traveled: a peasant sitting on a wagon passed us, the jingling of the harnesses mingled with the lowing of the ox and the grating squeal of ill-sprung wheels; after that, the road was deserted. A little farther on, to the left, a brick archway opened into the mountainside. We went up to it and squinted to see into the darkness; an iron gate, padlocked, barred access to the tunnel. “That’s the Proval,” Voss said. “At the end, there’s an open-air grotto, with a sulfur spring.”—“Isn’t this where Pechorin meets Vera?”—“I’m not sure. Isn’t that in the grotto beneath the Aeolian Harp?”—“We’ll have to check.” The clouds were passing just over our heads: I felt that if I lifted my arm I could stroke the swirls of vapor. We couldn’t see the sky at all and the atmosphere had become muffled, silent. Our footsteps crunched on the sandy earth; the path rose gently; and soon the clouds surrounded us. We could barely make out the tall trees lining the path; the air seemed heavy; the world had disappeared. In the distance, a cuckoo’s call echoed in the woods, an anxious, sorrowful cry. We walked in silence. This lasted a long time. Here and there, I caught a fleeting glimpse of large, dark, indistinct masses, buildings probably; then forest again. The clouds were dissipating, the gray shone with a confused gleam and all of a sudden they unraveled and scattered and we found ourselves in the sunlight. It hadn’t rained. To our right, beyond the trees, the jagged shapes of the Beshtau stood out; another twenty minutes’ walk brought us to the monument. “We’ve taken the long way round,” said Voss. “From the other side it’s faster.”—“Yes, but it was worth it.” The monument, a white obelisk erected in the middle of a poorly maintained lawn, offered little of interest: faced with this setting, carefully landscaped by bourgeois piety, it was hard to imagine the gunshots, the blood, the hoarse cries, the rage of the murdered poet. A few German vehicles were lined up in the parking area; below, in front of the forest, there were tables and benches where some soldiers were eating. For the sake of thoroughness I went over to examine the bronze medallion and the inscription on the monument. “I saw the photo of a temporary monument that they built in 1901,” Voss told me. “A kind of fanciful half-rotunda made of wood and plaster, with a bust perched high up top. It was much funnier.”—“They must have had trouble funding it. Should we go eat?”—“Yes, they make good shashlik here.” We crossed the parking area and went down to the tables. Two vehicles bore the tactical marks of the Einsatzkommando; I recognized several officers at one of the tables. Kern waved at us and I waved back, but I didn’t go over to say hello. There were also Turek, Bolte, Pfeiffer. I chose a table that was set somewhat back, near the woods, with coarse stools. A local mountain man in a skullcap, his cheeks badly shaved around his thick moustache, approached: “No pork,” Voss translated. “Just mutton. But there’s vodka and kompot.”—“That’s fine.” Bursts of conversation reached us from the other tables. There were also some junior officers from the Wehrmacht and a few civilians. Turek was watching us, then I saw him talking animatedly with Pfeiffer. Some Gypsy children were running between the tables. One of them came up to us: “Khleb, khleb,” he chanted, holding out a hand black with filth. The mountain man had brought us some slices of bread and I held one out to the boy, which he immediately crammed into his mouth. Then he pointed to the forest: “Sestra, sestra, dyev. Krasivaya.” He made an obscene gesture. Voss exploded in laughter and flung some words at him that made him run away. He headed toward the SS officers and repeated his gestures. “You think they’ll follow him?” Voss asked.—“Not in front of everyone,” I said. Turek in fact gave the boy a clout that sent him rolling onto the grass. I saw him make as if to take out his gun; the kid bolted into the trees. The native, who was officiating behind a long metal box on legs, came back to us with two skewers that he laid on top of the bread; then he brought us the drinks and glasses. The vodka went wonderfully well with the meat dripping with juice, and we each drank several measures, washing it all down with kompot, a juice of marinated berries. The sun was shining on the grass, the slender pines, the monument, with the slope of the Mashuk behind it all; the clouds had completely disappeared on the other side of the mountain. I thought again about Lermontov dying on the grass a few steps away, his chest shattered, for an empty remark about Martynov’s clothes. Unlike his hero Pechorin, Lermontov had fired into the air; his adversary, not. What could Martynov have been thinking as he looked at his enemy’s corpse? He himself had wanted to be a poet, and he had certainly read A Hero of Our Time; so he could savor the bitter echoes and slow ripples of the growing legend, he knew too that his name would remain only as that of Lermontov’s murderer, another d’Anthès encumbering Russian letters. But he must have had other ambitions when he started out in life; he too must have wanted to create, and create good things. Perhaps he was simply jealous of Lermontov’s talent? Or perhaps he chose to be remembered for the harm he had done, rather than not at all? I tried to remember his portrait but already couldn’t manage to. And Lermontov? His last thought, when he had emptied his pistol into the air and saw that Martynov was aiming at him, had it been bitter, desperate, furious, ironic? Or had he simply shrugged his shoulders and looked at the sunlight on the pine trees? As with Pushkin, they said that his death had been a setup, a contrived assassination; if that was the case, he had gone to it with his eyes wide open, obligingly, demonstrating his dissimilarity from Pechorin. What Blok wrote about Pushkin was no doubt even truer for him: It wasn’t Dantes’s bullet that killed him, it was the lack of air. I too lacked air, but the sun and the shashliks, and Voss’s joyous kindness, helped me breathe for an instant. We settled our bill with the native using occupation carbovanets and started again toward the Mashuk. “I suggest we go to the old cemetery,” Voss said. “There’s a stele there where Lermontov was buried.” After the duel, his friends had laid the poet to rest here; one year later, a hundred years before our arrival in Pyatigorsk, his maternal grandmother had come for his remains and had brought them home with her, to bury them next to his mother, near Penza. I readily agreed to this suggestion of Voss’s. Two cars passed us in a whirl of dust: the officers of the Kommando returning. Turek was driving the first vehicle himself; his hateful look, which I glimpsed through the window, made him look truly Jewish. The little convoy continued straight on but we went to the left, following a long zigzagging path that climbed up the side of the Mashuk. With the meal, the vodka, and the sun, I felt heavy; then the hiccups started and I left the path for the woods. “Are you all right?” Voss asked when I returned. I made a vague gesture and lit a cigarette. “It’s nothing. The tail end of something I caught in the Ukraine. It comes back from time to time.”—“You should see a doctor.”—“Maybe. Dr. Hohenegg must be coming back soon, I’ll see.” Voss waited for me to finish my cigarette, then followed close behind me. I was warm and I took off my cap and jacket. At the top of the knoll, the path formed a wide loop from which there was a fine view over the city and the plain beyond. “If you continue straight on, you return to the sanatoriums,” Voss said. “For the cemetery, we can go by these orchards.” The steep slope, with its faded grass, was planted with fruit trees; a tethered mule was nuzzling the ground in search of fallen apples. We descended the hill, sliding a little, then cut through a wood that was dense enough for us soon to lose the path. I put my jacket back on as the branches and brambles were scratching my arms. Finally, following Voss, I emerged onto a little muddy hollow that ran alongside a cemented stone wall. “This must be it,” said Voss. “We’ll go around.” Since the cars had passed us we hadn’t seen anyone, and I felt as if I were walking in the open countryside; but a few steps farther on a young boy, his feet bare, leading a donkey, passed us without a word. Following the wall, we finally arrived at a little square, in front of an Orthodox church. An old woman dressed in black, sitting on a crate, was selling some flowers; others were coming out of the church. Beyond the gate, the graves lay scattered under tall trees that plunged the sloping cemetery into shadow. We followed a rising path paved with coarse stones buried in the ground, between old graves lost in dry grass, ferns, and thorn bushes. Patches of light fell in places between the trees and in these islands of sun, little black-and-white butterflies were dancing around faded flowers. Then the path curved and the trees opened out a little to reveal the plain to the southwest. In an enclosure, two little trees had been planted to give shade to the stele that marks the place of Lermontov’s first grave. The only sounds were the chirping of crickets and the breeze rustling the leaves. Near the stele were the graves of Lermontov’s relations, the Shan-Gireis. I turned around: in the distance, the long green balki furrowed the plain to the first rocky foothills. The mounds of the volcanoes looked like clumps of earth fallen from the sky; in the distance, I could make out the snowy peaks of the Elbruz. I sat down on the steps leading to the stele, while Voss went to nose about a little farther on, thinking again about Lermontov: like all poets, first they kill him, then they venerate him."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"Around eight o’clock"|"We went back down to the town by the Verkhnyi rynok, where the peasants were finishing packing up their unsold chickens, fruits, and vegetables onto carts or mules. Around them the crowd of sunflower seed sellers and boot polishers was dispersing; boys sitting on little wagons improvised from boards and baby carriage wheels were still waiting for a lingering soldier to ask them to cart his packages. At the foot of the hill, on Kirov Boulevard, rows of fresh crosses were lined up on a small knoll surrounded by a low wall: the pretty little park, with its monument to Lermontov, had been transformed into a cemetery for German soldiers. The boulevard heading toward Tsvetnik Park passed in front of the ruins of what had been the Orthodox cathedral, dynamited in 1936 by the NKVD. “Have you noticed,” Voss remarked as he pointed to the collapsed stones, “they didn’t touch the German church. Our men still go there to pray.”—“Yes, but they emptied the three surrounding villages of Volksdeutschen. The czar had invited them to settle here in 1830. They were all sent to Siberia last year.” But Voss was still thinking about his Lutheran church. “Did you know that it was built by a soldier? A man named Kempfer, who fought against the Cherkess under Yevdokimov, and settled here.” In the park, just after the entrance gate, stood a two-level wooden gallery, sporting turrets with futuristic cupolas and a loggia that wrapped around the upper level. There were some tables there where they served, to those who could pay, Turkish coffee and sweets. Voss chose a place on the side of the park’s main path, above the groups of grizzled, cantankerous, grouchy old men, who came in the evening to sit on the benches and play chess. I ordered coffee and brandy; they also brought us some little lemon cakes; the brandy came from Daghestan and seemed even sweeter than the Armenian, but it went well with the cakes and my good mood. “How are your studies going?” I asked Voss. He laughed: “I still haven’t found an Ubykh speaker; but I’m making considerable progress in Kabard. What I’m really waiting for is for us to take Ordzhonikidze.”—“Why is that?”—“Well, I’ve already told you that Caucasian languages are only my subspecialty. What really interests me are the so-called Indo-Germanic languages, especially the languages of Iranian origin. And Ossetic is a particularly fascinating Iranian language.”—“How so?”—“You can see the geographic situation of Ossetia: whereas all the other non-Caucasian speakers live on the rim or in the foothills of the Caucasus, they straddle the massif, just at the level of the most accessible pass, the Darial where the Russians built their Voyennaya doroga from Tiflis to Ordzhonikidze, the old Vladikavkaz. Although these people adopted the clothing and customs of their mountain neighbors, it’s obviously a late invasion. It is believed that these Ossetes or Osses are descended from the Alans and hence the Scythians; if that is correct, their language would constitute a living archeological remnant of the Scythian language. And there’s something else: in 1930 Dumézil published a collection of Ossetian legends having to do with a fabulous people, half-divine, whom they call the Narts. Now Dumézil also postulates a connection between these legends and the ancient Scythian religion as it is reported by Herodotus. Russian researchers have been working on this subject since the end of the last century; the library and institutes in Ordzhonikidze must be overflowing with extraordinary materials, inaccessible in Europe. I just hope we don’t burn everything down during the attack.”—“In short, if I’ve understood you correctly, these Ossetes are an Urvolk, one of the original Aryan peoples.”—“Original is a word that is much used and misused. Let’s say that their language has some very interesting archaic characteristics from a scientific standpoint.”—“What do you mean about the notion of ‘original’?” He shrugged his shoulders: “Original is more a fantasy, a psychological or political pretense, than a scientific concept. Take German, for instance: for centuries, even before Martin Luther, people claimed it was an original language under the pretext that it had no recourse to roots of foreign origin, unlike the Romance languages, to which it was compared. Some theologians, in their delirium, even went so far as to claim that German was the language of Adam and Eve, and that Hebrew later derived from it. But that’s a completely illusory claim, since even if the roots are ‘native’—actually, all derived directly from the languages of Indo-European nomads—our grammar is entirely structured by Latin. Our cultural imagination, however, was very strongly marked by these ideas, and by this peculiarity German has in contrast to other European languages: the way it can sort of self-generate its vocabulary. It’s a fact that any eight-year-old German child knows all the roots of our language and can take apart and understand any word, even the most abstruse compound, which is not the case for a French child, for instance, who will take a very long time to learn the ‘difficult’ words derived from Greek or Latin. That, moreover, has a lot to do with the idea we have of ourselves: Deutschland is the only country in Europe that doesn’t have a geographic designation, that doesn’t bear the name of a place or a people like the Angles or the Franks, it’s the country of the ‘people’ per se; deutsch being an adjectival form of the old German Tuits, ‘people.’ That’s why none of our neighbors call us by the same name: Allemands, Germans, Duits, Tedeschi in Italian which also stems from Tuits, or Nyemtsi here in Russia, which means ‘the Mutes,’ those who don’t know how to speak, like Barbaros in Greek. And our whole present-day racial and völkisch ideology, in a certain way, is built on these very ancient German pretensions. Which, I will add, are not unique to us: Goropius Becanus, a Flemish author, made the same argument in 1569 about Dutch, which he compared to what he called the original languages of the Caucasus, vagina of peoples.” He laughed gaily. I would have liked to continue the conversation, especially about racial theories, but he was already standing up: “I have to go. Would you like to have dinner with Oberländer, if he’s free?”—“Of course.”—“Shall we meet at the Kasino? Around eight o’clock.” He ran down the steps. I sat back down and contemplated the old men playing chess. Fall was advancing: already the sun was passing behind the Mashuk, tinting the crest with pink and, farther down on the boulevard, casting orange-colored reflections through the trees, up to the windows and the gray roughcast of the façades."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 07:30"|"Around seven thirty"|"Around seven thirty I went down to the Kasino. Voss hadn’t yet arrived and I ordered a brandy, which I carried into an alcove set a little back. A few minutes later Kern came in, examined the room, and headed toward me. “Herr Hauptsturmführer! I was looking for you.” He took off his cap and sat down, casting glances around him: he looked embarrassed, nervous. “Hauptsturmführer. I wanted to let you know about something that concerns you, I think.”—“Yes?” He hesitated: “They…You are often in the company of that Leutnant from the Wehrmacht. That…how should I say it? That’s giving rise to some rumors.”—“What sort of rumors?”—“Rumors…let’s say dangerous rumors. The kind of rumors that lead straight to the concentration camp.”—“I see.” I remained impassive. “And might this kind of rumor by chance be spread by a certain kind of person?” He turned pale: “I don’t want to say anything else about it. I think it’s low, shameful. I just wanted to warn you so that you could…could act in a way that would prevent it from going any further.” I got up and held out my hand: “Thank you for this information, Obersturmführer. But I have nothing but contempt for those who spread sordid rumors in a cowardly way instead of confronting someone face-to-face, and I ignore them.” He shook my hand: “I completely understand your reaction. But take care all the same.” I sat back down, overcome with rage: so that’s the game they wanted to play! What’s more, they were completely mistaken. I’ve said it already: I never form bonds with my lovers; friendship is something else entirely. I loved a single person in this world, and even if I never saw her, that was enough for me. But narrow-minded scum like Turek and his friends could never understand that. I resolved to get my revenge; I didn’t know how yet, but the opportunity would present itself. Kern was an honest man, he had done well to warn me: that would give me time to think."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 06:00"|"six o’clock"|"At the foot of the Mashuk, I sent Hanning back to the AOK and went by the Academic Gallery to the Pushkin baths, which the Wehrmacht had partially reopened for its convalescents. There I stripped naked and plunged my body into the scalding, brackish, sulfurous water. I stayed in it for a long time and then rinsed myself off in a cold shower. This treatment reinvigorated my body and soul: my skin was mottled red and white, and I felt more awake, almost light. I returned to my quarters and lay down for an hour, my feet crossed on the sofa, facing the open French window. Then I changed and went down to the AOK to find the car I had requested that morning. On the way, I smoked and contemplated the volcanoes and the soft blue mountains of the Caucasus. Night was already setting in; it was fall. Entering Kislovodsk, the road passed the Podkumok; below, peasants’ carts were fording the river; the last one, just a board on wheels, was pulled by a camel with long hair and a thick neck. Hohenegg was waiting for me at the Kasino. “You look fit,” he said when he saw me.—“I’m a new man. But I had a strange day.”—“Tell me all about it.” Two bottles of white wine from the Palatinate were waiting next to the table in ice buckets: “I had those sent to me by my wife.”—“You’re in a class by yourself, Doktor.” He uncorked the first one: the wine was cool and bit the tongue, leaving behind it a fruity caress. “How is your conference going?” I asked him.—“Very well. We’ve gone over cholera, typhus, and dysentery, and now we’re coming to the painful subject of frostbite.”—“It’s not the season for that yet.”—“It will be soon enough. And you?” I told him about the old Bergjude. “A wise man, this Nahum ben Ibrahim,” he commented when I had finished. “We can envy him.”—“You’re probably right.” Our table was placed right against a partition; behind it was a private booth, from which laughter and bursts of indistinct voices were emanating. I drank a little wine. “Still,” I added, “I have to admit that I had trouble understanding him.”—“Not me,” Hohenegg asserted. “You see, in my view there are three possible attitudes faced with this absurd life. First the attitude of the mass, hoi polloi, which simply refuses to see that life is a joke. They don’t laugh at it, but work, accumulate, masticate, defecate, fornicate, reproduce, get old, and die like oxen harnessed to the plow, as idiotic as they lived. That’s the large majority. Then there are those, such as me, who know that life is a joke and who have the courage to laugh at it, like the Taoists or your Jew. Finally there are those, and if my diagnosis is correct you are one of them, who know that life is a joke, but who suffer from it. It’s like your Lermontov, whom I’ve finally read: I zhizn takaya pustaya i glupaya shutka, he writes.” I knew enough Russian now to understand and complete the phrase: “He should have added: i grubaya, ‘an empty, stupid and dirty joke.’”—“He certainly thought of it. But it wouldn’t have scanned right.”—“Those who have that attitude do know, however, that the other laughing one exists,” I said.—“Yes, but they don’t manage to adopt it.” The voices on the other side of the partition had become clearer: a waitress had left the curtain of the booth open as she went out. I recognized the coarse intonations of Turek and his lackey Pfeiffer. “Women like that should be banned from the SS!” Turek was screeching.—“That’s right. He should be in a concentration camp, not a uniform,” Pfeiffer replied.—“Yes,” said another voice, “but you need evidence.”—“We saw them,” said Turek. “The other day, behind the Mashuk. They left the road to go do their things in the woods.”—“Are you sure?”—“I give you my word as an officer.”—“And you recognized him?”—“Aue? He was as close to me as you are now.” The men suddenly fell silent. Turek turned slowly around and saw me standing in the entrance to the booth. His flushed face drained of blood. Pfeiffer, at the head of the table, went yellow. “It is very regrettable that you should use your word as an officer so lightly, Hauptsturmführer,” I said clearly, in a measured, neutral tone. “That devalues it. Yet there is still time to withdraw your despicable words. I warn you: if you don’t, we must fight.” Turek had gotten up, abruptly pushing back his chair. An absurd tic was deforming his lips, giving him an even more spineless and lost look than usual. His eyes sought out Pfeiffer, who encouraged him with a sign of his head. “I have nothing to withdraw,” he squeaked in a monotone. He still hesitated to go all the way. I was filled with a strong exaltation; but my voice remained calm, precise. “Are you quite sure?” I wanted to push him, to inflame him and slam all the doors shut behind him. “I won’t be as easy to kill as an unarmed Jew, you can be sure of that.” These words provoked a commotion. “You’re insulting the SS!” Pfeiffer roared. Turek was pale; he looked at me like a mad bull, without saying anything. “Very well, then,” I said. “I will send someone soon to the Teilkommando offices.” I turned on my heel and left the restaurant. Hohenegg caught up with me on the steps: “That’s not very smart, what you did there. Lermontov has decidedly gone to your head.” I shrugged my shoulders. “Doktor, I believe you are a man of honor. Will you be my second?” Now it was his turn to shrug his shoulders. “If you like. But it’s idiotic.” I patted him amiably on the shoulder. “Don’t worry! Everything will go well. But don’t forget your wine, we’ll need it.” He brought me to his room and we finished the first bottle. I spoke to him a little about my life and my friendship with Voss: “I like him a lot. He’s an astonishing man. But it has nothing to do with what those swine are imagining.” Then I sent him to the Teilkommando offices and began the second bottle as I waited for him, smoking and watching the autumn sun play on the large park and the slopes of the Maloe Sedlo. He returned from his errand after an hour. “I should warn you,” he said point-blank, “they’re plotting something.”—“How’s that?”—“I went into the Kommando and heard them bellowing. I missed the beginning of the conversation, but I heard the fat one say: ‘That way we won’t run any risks. Anyway he doesn’t deserve anything else.’ Then your enemy, the one who looks like a Jew, right? replied: ‘And what about his second?’ The other one shouted: ‘Too bad for him.’ After that I came in and they shut up. In my opinion they’re getting ready to simply massacre us. Talk about the honor of the SS!”—“Don’t worry, Doktor. I’ll take my precautions. Did you settle on the arrangements?”—“Yes. We’ll meet them tomorrow night at six o’clock outside of Zheleznovodsk and we’ll go find an isolated balka. The dead man will be chalked up to the partisans lurking around there.” “Yes, Pustov’s gang. That’s a good idea. Shall we go eat?”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"I returned to Pyatigorsk after eating and drinking heartily. Hohenegg, during the dinner, had been glum: I saw that he disapproved of my action and of the whole business. I was still strangely exalted; it was as if a great weight had been taken from my shoulders. I would kill Turek with pleasure; but I had to think about how to foil the trap that he and Pfeiffer wanted to set for me. An hour after I got back, someone knocked on my door. It was an orderly from the Kommando, who handed me a piece of paper. “Sorry to disturb you so late, Hauptsturmführer. It’s an urgent order from the Gruppenstab.” I tore it open: Bierkamp was summoning me at eight o’clock the next day, along with Turek. Someone had given the game away. I dismissed the orderly and collapsed on the sofa. I felt as if I were being pursued by a curse: whatever I tried to do, any pure action would be denied me! I thought I saw the old Jew, in his grave on the Mashuk, laughing at me. Drained, I burst into tears and fell asleep crying, fully dressed."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"around six o’clock"|"A noncom woke me from my bad sleep at around six o’clock. The mess was cold and almost empty; I didn’t taste the bitterness of the tea, but concentrated on its warmth, with both my hands around the tin cup. Then they led us with our kit to a freezing hangar where they made us wait for a long time, stamping our feet in the midst of oily machinery and crates of spare parts. My breath formed heavy condensation in front of my face, suspended in the moist air. Finally the pilot came and introduced himself: “We’ll fill up and get going,” he said. “Unfortunately, I don’t have any parachutes for you.”—“Are they of any use?” I asked. He laughed: “Theoretically, if we get shot down by a Soviet fighter plane, we might have time to jump. In practice, you can forget it.” He led us to a little truck that took us to a Junker-52 parked at the end of the runway. During the night the sky had become overcast; to the east, the cottony mass was clearing up. Some men were finishing loading small crates into the aircraft; the pilot had us climb in and showed us how to buckle down on a narrow seat. A thickset mechanic came and sat down opposite us; he flashed us a sardonic smile, then ignored us. Bursts of static and chatter came from the radio. The pilot slipped back out of the cockpit to check something in the rear, climbing over the pile of crates and bags tied down with cable mesh. “It is a good thing you’re leaving today,” he said as he returned. “The Reds are almost in Skassirskaya, just to the north. Soon we’ll close up shop here.”—“Are you going to evacuate the aerodrome?” I asked. He made a face and returned to his post. “You know our traditions, Hauptsturmführer,” Hohenegg commented. “We’ll only evacuate when everyone’s gotten killed.” One by one, the engines coughed and started up. A high throbbing sound filled the cabin; everything vibrated, the seat beneath me, the metal wall to my back; a monkey wrench left on the floor trembled. Slowly, the plane began to taxi to the runway, U-turned, picked up speed; the tail lifted; then the whole mass tore itself off the ground. Our bags, which hadn’t been tied down, slipped to the back; Hohenegg fell against me. I looked out the window: we were lost in the fog and the clouds; I could barely see the engine. The vibrations penetrated my body in an unpleasant way. Then the plane climbed beyond the cloud cover and the sky was a metallic blue; the dawning sun stretched its cold light over the immense landscape of clouds, undulating with balki like the steppe. The air was biting, the cabin wall icy; I wrapped myself in my coat and huddled down. Hohenegg seemed to be sleeping, his hands in his pockets, his head leaning forward; the plane’s vibrations and jolts disturbed me, I couldn’t do the same. Finally the plane began its descent; skimming over the summit of clouds, it dove, and once again everything was gray and dark. Through the monotonous buzzing of the propellers I thought I heard a muffled explosion, but I couldn’t be sure. A few minutes later, the pilot shouted into the cabin: “Pitomnik!” I shook Hohenegg, who woke up without any surprise, and wiped the condensation off the window. We had just passed beneath the clouds and the white steppe, almost shapeless, stretched beneath the wing. In front, everything was drastically changed: brown craters spattered the snow in large dirty spots; heaps of scrapped metal lay in tangles, powdered with white. The plane was coming down quickly, but I still couldn’t see the runway. Then it suddenly touched the ground, bounced, landed. The mechanic was already unbuckling his strap: “Quick, quick!” he shouted. I heard an explosion and a spray of snow struck the window and the wall of the cabin. I unbuckled frantically. The plane had slewed a little sideways and the mechanic opened the door and threw down the ladder. The pilot hadn’t cut the engines. The mechanic took our bags, tossed them unceremoniously out the opening, then motioned to us energetically to get out. A howling wind, loaded with fine, hard snow, struck me in the face. Some bundled-up men were busy around the plane, setting blocks in place, opening the hold. I slid down the ladder and gathered up my kit. A Feldgendarm armed with a submachine gun saluted me and gestured for me to follow him; I shouted out, “Wait, wait!” Hohenegg was getting out. A shell burst in the snow a few dozen meters away, but no one seemed to pay any attention to it. At the end of the runway rose a mound of swept snow; a group of men was waiting there, guarded by several armed Feldgendarmen, their sinister metal plates hanging over the coats. Hohenegg and I, behind our escort, approached them; closer up, I saw that most of these men were bandaged or holding makeshift crutches; two of them were lying on stretchers; all of them had the tag of the wounded pinned visibly on their greatcoats. At a signal, they rushed toward the plane. Behind them was a melee: Feldgendarmen were blocking an opening in the barbed wire, beyond which a mass of haggard men were pushing each other; they were shouting, begging, waving bandaged limbs, pressing against the Feldgendarmen who were also shouting and brandishing their submachine guns. Another detonation, closer this time, made some snow rain down; several of the wounded had thrown themselves to the ground, but the Feldgendarmen remained unruffled; behind us there was shouting; some of the men who were unloading the plane seemed to have been hit, they lay on the ground and others were pulling them aside, the wounded who were being allowed to board were shoving each other to climb up the ladder, still other men were finishing unloading the plane and tossing bags and crates to the ground. The Feldgendarm accompanying us fired a brief volley into the air and then dove forward into the hysterical, imploring crowd, hitting out with his elbows; I followed him as well as I could, dragging Hohenegg behind me. Beyond were rows of tents covered with frost, the brown openings of bunkers; farther on, radio trucks were parked in a tight group, in the midst of a forest of poles, antennas, wires; at the end of the runway began a vast dumping ground of metal wrecks, planes that had been blown up or split in half, burned trucks, tanks, smashed vehicles piled on top of each other, half hidden beneath the snow. Some officers were coming toward us; we exchanged salutes. Two military doctors welcomed Hohenegg; my interlocutor was a young Leutnant from the Abwehr, who introduced himself and bade me welcome: “I have to look after you and find you a vehicle to take you into the city.” Hohenegg was walking away: “Doktor!” I shook his hand. “We’ll surely see each other again,” he said kindly. “The Kessel isn’t so big. When you’re feeling sad, come find me and we’ll drink my Cognac.” I made a wide gesture with my hand: “In my opinion, Doktor, your Cognac won’t last long.” I followed the Leutnant. Near the tents I noticed a series of large heaps powdered with snow. From time to time, a muffled explosion would resound all through the aerodrome. Already the Junker that had brought us was slowly taxiing toward the end of the runway. I paused to watch it take off and the Leutnant watched with me. The wind was blowing quite hard, you had to blink your eyes so as not to be blinded by the fine snow raised from the surface of the ground. Having reached the far point, the plane swung round and, without pausing the slightest bit, accelerated. It swerved once, then again, dangerously close to the snowy embankment; then the wheels left the ground and it rose up groaning, swaying, with great juddering, before vanishing into the opaque cloud bank. I looked again at the snowy pile beside me and saw that it was made up of corpses, piled like logs to form long cords, their frozen faces the color of bronze gone slightly green, studded with dense beards, and with ice crystals at the corners of their mouths, in their nostrils, their eye sockets. There must have been hundreds of them. I asked the Leutnant: “You don’t bury them?” He stamped his foot: “How are we supposed to bury them? The ground is hard as iron. We don’t have any explosives to waste. We can’t even dig trenches.” We walked on; where traffic had made paths, the ground was slick, slippery; you had to walk to the side, through the snowdrifts. The Leutnant led me to a long low line covered with snow. I thought they were bunkers, but when I approached I saw that they were in fact half-buried train cars, their walls and roofs covered with sandbags, with steps dug into the ground leading to the doors. The Leutnant brought me in; inside, some officers were bustling about in the hallway; the train compartments had been transformed into offices; a few weak lightbulbs spread a dirty, yellowish light, and they must have had a stove going somewhere, it wasn’t all that cold. The Leutnant invited me to sit down in a compartment, after clearing the seat of the papers piled on it. I noticed some Christmas decorations, coarsely cut out of colored paper, hanging in the window, behind which were piled up the earth and snow and the frozen sandbags. “Would you like some tea?” the Leutnant asked. “I can’t offer you anything else.” I accepted, and he went out. I took off my shapka and unfastened my coat, then collapsed into the seat. The Leutnant returned with two cups of ersatz and held one out to me; he drank his own standing in the entrance to the compartment. “Hard luck for you,” he said timidly, “being sent here like this just before Christmas.” I shrugged my shoulders and blew on my scalding tea: “Christmas doesn’t mean that much to me, really.”—“For us, here, it’s very important.” He gestured at the decorations. “The men are very attached to it. I hope the Reds will leave us in peace. But you can’t count on it.” I found this strange: Hoth, in principle, was advancing to make his junction; it seemed to me that the officers should have been in the process of preparing their retreat rather than getting ready for Christmas. The Leutnant looked at his watch: “Movements are strictly limited and we can’t take you into the city right away. There will be a liaison this afternoon.”—“Fine. Do you know where I have to go?” He looked surprised: “To the city Kommandantur, I guess. All the SP officers are there.”—“I have to present myself to Feldpolizeikommissar Möritz.”—“Yes, that’s right.” He hesitated: “Have some rest. I’ll come and get you.” He left. A little later, another officer came in, greeted me absently, and began vigorously working at a typewriter. I went into the hallway, but it was too crowded. I began to feel hungry; they hadn’t offered me anything, and I didn’t want to ask. I went to smoke a cigarette outside, you could hear the droning of the planes, some explosions from time to time, then I went back in to wait, in the monotonous clacking of the typewriter."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
00:00|midnight|"The worst had already happened. Around the spring of 1929, I was still in boarding school when I received a letter from my mother. She announced that since there had never been any news from him, and since her repeated inquiries at various German consulates had yielded nothing, she had filed a request for my father to be declared legally dead. Seven years had gone by since his disappearance, and the court had issued the decision she had hoped for; now she was going to marry Moreau, a good, generous man who was like a father to us. This odious letter threw me into a paroxysm of rage. I sent her a letter full of violent insults: My father, I wrote, was not dead, and the profound desire they both had of it would not be enough to kill him. If she wanted to sell herself to a despicable little French shopkeeper, that was entirely up to her; as for me, I would regard their marriage as illegitimate and bigamous. I hoped at least that they wouldn’t try to inflict on me a bastard whom I could only detest. My mother, wisely, did not answer this philippic. That summer, I arranged to have myself invited by the parents of a rich friend, and so didn’t set foot in Antibes. They got married in August; I tore up the invitation and flushed it down the toilet; the following school vacation, I still persisted in not going back; finally they managed to get me to return, but that’s another story. In the meantime, my hatred was there, intact, full-fledged, something whole and almost succulent inside me, a pyre waiting for a match. But to avenge myself I only knew low, shameful means: I had kept a photo of my mother; I jacked off or sucked my lovers in front of it and made them ejaculate onto it. I did worse than that. In Moreau’s large house, I gave myself over to baroque, fantastically elaborate erotic games. Inspired by the Martian novels of E. R. Burroughs (the author of the Tarzan of my childhood), which I devoured with the same passion as the Greek classics, I locked myself up in the large upstairs bathroom, running the water so as not to attract attention, and created extravagant scenes from my imaginary world. Captured by an army of four-armed green men from Barsoom, I was stripped naked, bound, and led before a superb copper-skinned Martian princess, haughty and impassive on her throne. There, using a belt for the leather bonds and with a broom or a bottle stuck in my anus, I writhed on the cold tiles while half a dozen of her massive, mute bodyguards took turns raping me in front of her. But brooms or bottles could hurt: I looked for something more suitable. Moreau loved thick German sausages; at night, I took one from the fridge, rolled it between my hands to warm it up, lubricated it with olive oil; afterward, I washed it carefully, dried it, and put it back where I had found it. The next day I watched Moreau and my mother slicing it up and eating it with great pleasure, and I refused my portion with a smile, offering a lack of appetite as my excuse, delighted at going hungry so I could watch them eat. It’s true that this happened before their wedding, when I still regularly visited their house. So it wasn’t their marriage in itself that bothered me. But these were just the miserable, pitiful acts of revenge of a powerless child. Later on, after I came of age, I turned away from them, left for Germany, and stopped answering my mother’s letters. But the story went on, secretly, and it just needed a trifle, the cries of a dying man, for everything to come back all at once, since it had always existed, it came from elsewhere, from a world that was not the world of men and of everyday work, a world that was usually sealed but whose doors the war could suddenly throw open, freeing in a hoarse, inarticulate, brutal shout its gaping darkness, a pestilential swamp, overturning the established order of things, customs and laws, forcing men to kill each other, putting them back under the yoke from which they had with so much difficulty liberated themselves, the weight of all that came before. We were once again following the tracks along the abandoned train cars: lost in my thoughts, I had scarcely noticed the long walk around the kurgan. The hard snow, which crackled beneath my boots, was taking on bluish tints beneath the pallid moon that lit up our path. Another fifteen minutes and we were back at the Univermag; I felt quite fresh, reinvigorated by the walk. Ivan saluted me casually and left to join his compatriots, taking my submachine gun with him. In the large operations room, beneath the enormous chandelier salvaged from a theater, the officers of the Stadtkommandantur were drinking and singing in chorus “O Du fröhliche” and “Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht.” One of them handed me a glass of red wine; I drained it in one swallow, even though it was good French wine. In the hallway, I passed Möritz, who looked at me, stunned: “You went out?”—“Yes, Herr Kommissar. I went to reconnoiter some of our positions, to get an idea of the city.” His face darkened: “Don’t go risking yourself uselessly. I had a hard job getting you; if you get yourself killed right away, I’ll never be able to replace you.”—“Zu Befehl, Herr Kommissar.” I saluted him and went to change. A little later, Möritz offered his officers a drink, from two bottles of Cognac carefully held in reserve; he introduced me to my new colleagues, Leibbrandt, Dreyer, Vopel, the intelligence officer, Hauptsturmführer von Ahlfen, Herzog, Zumpe. Zumpe and Vopel, the Untersturmführer I had met the day before, worked with Thomas. There was also Weidner, the Gestapoleiter for the city (Thomas was Leiter IV for the whole Kessel, and thus Weidner’s superior). We drank to the Führer and to the Endsieg and wished each other a merry Christmas; it all remained sober and cordial—I vastly preferred it to the sentimental or religious effusions of the soldiers. Thomas and I, out of curiosity, went to the midnight Mass that was celebrated in the main hall. The Catholic priest and Lutheran pastor of one of the divisions took turns officiating, in a perfect ecumenical spirit, and the faithful of both confessions prayed together. General von Seydlitz-Kurbach, who commanded the LIST Corps, was there with several division commanders and their chiefs of staff; Thomas pointed out Sanne, who commanded the One Hundredth Jägerdivision, Korfes, von Hartmann. Some of our Ukrainians were also praying: they were, Thomas explained, Uniates from Galicia, who celebrate Christmas at the same time as we do, unlike their Orthodox cousins. I examined them, but didn’t see Ivan among them. After the Mass, we went back to drink Cognac; then, suddenly exhausted, I went to bed. I dreamed of metros again: this time, two parallel tracks ran side by side between brilliantly lit platforms, then joined each other farther on down the tunnel, after a separation marked by large round cement pylons; but this switch didn’t work and a team of women in orange uniforms, including a black woman, were working feverishly to repair it while the train, crowded with passengers, was already leaving the station."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 05:30"|05:30|"The village of Rakotino remained strangely silent. We were less than a kilometer from the front, but since I arrived I had heard just a few gunshots. The clacking of the typewriter resounded in this silence and made it even more nerve-wracking. At least my runs had calmed down. Finally, Hohenegg stowed his papers into a briefcase, got up, and stuck a scruffy shapka onto his round skull. “Give me your paybook,” he said, “I’m going to look for some soup. You’ll find a little wood next to the stove: start it up again, but use as little as possible. We have to keep till tomorrow with that.” He went out; I busied myself next to the stove. The wood supply was indeed meager: a few wet fence pickets, with bits of barbed wire attached. I finally managed to light a piece after cutting it up. Hohenegg returned with a mess tin of soup and a thick slice of Kommissbrot. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but they refuse to give you a ration without a written order from the HQ of the Panzer Corps. We’ll share.”—“Don’t worry,” I replied, “I anticipated that.” I went over to my coat and took from the pockets a piece of bread, some dry biscuits, and some tinned meat. “Magnificent!” he exclaimed. “Keep the tin for tonight, I have an onion: it’ll be a feast. For lunch, I have this.” He took a piece of bacon wrapped in a Soviet newspaper out of his bag. With a pocket knife, he cut the bread into slices and also cut two thick slices of bacon; he placed all of it directly on the stove, with the mess tin of soup. “Sorry, but I don’t have a saucepan.” While the bacon sizzled, he stored his typewriter away and spread the newspaper out on the table. We ate the bacon on the warmed slices of black bread: the slightly melted fat seeped into the thick bread, and it was delicious. Hohenegg offered me his soup; I refused, pointing to my stomach. He raised his eyebrows: “The Flux?” I nodded. “Be careful with that. Normally one gets over it, but here, it can carry men away in a few days. They become dehydrated and die.” He explained the hygienic procedures I should follow. “That can be a little complicated here,” I pointed out.—“Yes, that’s true,” he acknowledged sadly. While we were finishing our bacon toast, he talked to me about lice and typhus. “We already have a few cases, which we isolate as well as we can,” he explained. “But inevitably, an epidemic will break out. And then it will be catastrophic. The men will fall like flies.”—“In my opinion, they’re dying fast enough as is.”—“Do you know what our tovarishchi are doing now on the front of the division? They’re playing a recording with a clock going tick, tock, tick, tock, very loud, then a sepulchral voice announcing in German: ‘Every seven seconds, a German dies in Russia!’ Then the tick, tock again. They put that on for hours. It’s quite striking.” For men devoured by cold and hunger, gnawed by vermin, crouching at the bottom of their bunkers of snow and frozen earth, I could see how it must have been terrifying, even if the calculation (as we have seen at the beginning of this memoir) was a little excessive. I responded by telling Hohenegg the story of the Solomonic cannibals. His only commentary was: “Judging from the Hiwis I’ve examined, they must not have had a very satisfying feast.” That brought us to the object of my mission. “I haven’t finished the tour of all the divisions,” he explained, “and there are differences for which I haven’t yet found any explanation. But I’ve already conducted about thirty autopsies and the results are irrefutable: more than half present symptoms of acute malnutrition. To put it simply, almost no adipose tissue left under the skin or surrounding the internal organs; gelatinous fluid in the mesentery; congested liver; pale, anemic organs; red and yellow marrow replaced by a vitreous substance; cardiac muscle atrophied, but with an enlargement of the right ventricle and the right auricle. In ordinary language, their body, lacking anything to sustain its vital functions, devours itself to find the necessary calories; when there’s nothing left, everything stops, like a car that’s run out of gas. It’s a well-known phenomenon: but the curious thing here is that despite the dramatic reduction in rations, it’s still much too soon to have so many cases. All the officers assure me that the food supplies are centralized by the AOK and that the soldiers are indeed receiving the official ration. Which, for now, is just under a thousand calories per day. That’s far too little, but it’s still something; the men should be weak, more vulnerable to diseases and opportunistic infections, but they shouldn’t be dying of hunger yet. That’s why my colleagues are looking for another explanation: they talk of exhaustion, stress, physical shock. But that’s all vague and not very convincing. My autopsies don’t lie.”—“What do you think, then?”—“I don’t know. There must be a number of reasons, hard to separate in these conditions. I suspect that the capacity of certain organisms to break down food properly, to digest it, is altered by other factors such as tension or lack of sleep. There are of course quite obvious cases: men with diarrhea that’s so severe that the little they absorb doesn’t stay in their stomach long enough and comes out almost as is; that’s especially the case for the ones eating almost exclusively this Wassersuppe. Some of the food they distribute to the troops is even harmful; for example, canned meat like yours, very rich, sometimes kills men who haven’t eaten anything except bread and soup for weeks; their organism can’t bear the shock, the heart pumps too quickly and suddenly gives out. There’s also the butter, which keeps arriving: it’s delivered in frozen blocks, and out in the steppe, the Landsers don’t have anything to make fires with, so they break it up with an axe and suck on the pieces. That provokes horrible diarrhea that soon finishes them off. If you want to know the truth, many of the bodies I receive have their pants still full of shit, frozen fortunately: in the end, they’re too weak to drop their pants. And note that these are bodies picked up at the front lines, not in the hospitals. In short, to return to my theory, it will be hard to demonstrate, but it seems plausible to me. The metabolism itself is affected by the cold and fatigue, and can no longer function properly.”—“And fear?”—“Fear too, of course. We saw it during the Great War: under some particularly intense bombardments, the heart fails; we find young, healthy, well-fed men dead without the slightest wound. But here I’d say rather that it’s an aggravating factor, not a primary cause. Once again, I have to continue my investigations. It won’t be much use for the Sixth Army, I’m sure, but I flatter myself that it will serve science, and that’s what helps me get up in the morning; that, and the inevitable salyut of our friends across the lines. This Kessel, in fact, is a giant laboratory. A genuine researcher’s paradise. I have as many bodies at my disposal as I could wish for, perfectly preserved, even if it’s sometimes a little hard to defrost them. I have to force my poor assistants to spend the night with them near the stove, turning them over regularly. The other day, in Baburkin, one of them fell asleep; the next morning, I found my subject frozen on one side and roasted on the other. Come along now, it’ll soon be time.”—“Time? Time for what?”—“You’ll see.” Hohenegg gathered up his briefcase and his typewriter and put on his coat; before going out, he snuffed the candle. Outside, it was dark. I followed him to a balka behind the village, where he slithered, feet first, into a bunker that was almost invisible beneath the snow. Three officers were sitting on little stools around a candle. “Good evening, meine Herren,” Hohenegg said. “Let me introduce Hauptsturmführer Dr. Aue, who has very kindly come to visit us.” I shook hands with the officers and, since there was no other stool, sat down on the frozen ground, pulling my coattails under me. Despite the fleece lining, I felt the cold. “The Soviet commander opposite us is a man of remarkable punctuality,” Hohenegg explained to me. “Every day, since the middle of the month, he has sprayed this sector three times a day, at 05:30, 11:00, and 16:00 sharp. In the meantime, nothing, aside from a few mortar shells. It’s very practical for my work.” Indeed, three minutes later, I heard the piercing screech, followed by a close series of enormous explosions, of a volley of “Stalin organs.” The whole bunker shook, snow came down and half filled the entryway, clumps of earth rained from the ceiling. The frail light of the candle flickered, projecting monstrous shadows on the exhausted, badly shaved faces of the officers. Other volleys followed, punctuated by the staccato detonations of tank or artillery shells. The noise had become a mad, insane thing, living its own life, occupying the air and pressing against the partly obstructed entrance of the bunker. I was seized with terror at the idea of being buried alive; I would almost have fled, but I got control of myself. After ten minutes the pounding abruptly stopped. But the noise, its presence and pressure, took longer to withdraw and dissipate. The acrid smell of cordite stung the nose and eyes. One of the officers cleared away the bunker’s entrance by hand. We went crawling out. Above the balka, the village looked crushed, swept as if by a storm; isbas were burning, but I soon saw that only a few houses had been struck: the bulk of the shells must have been aimed at the trenches. “The only problem,” Hohenegg commented as he brushed earth and snow off his cloak, “is that they never aim at quite the same spot. That would be much more practical. Let’s go see if our humble refuge has survived.” The hut was still standing; the stove was even giving off a little warmth. “Would you like to come over for some tea?” offered one of the officers who had accompanied us. We followed him to another isba, divided in half by a partition; the first room, where the two others already sat, was also equipped with a stove. “Here, in the village, it’s all right,” the officer said. “We find some wood after each bombardment. But the men on the line don’t have anything. At the slightest little wound, they die of shock and frostbite caused by the loss of blood. We rarely have time to evacuate them to a hospital.” Another officer was preparing the “tea,” some Schlüter ersatz. All three of them were Leutnants or Oberleutnants, very young; they moved and spoke slowly, almost apathetically. The one who was making the tea was wearing the Iron Cross. I offered them some cigarettes: this produced the same effect on them as it had with the Croatian officer. One of them took out a greasy pack of cards: “Do you play?” I made a sign that I didn’t, but Hohenegg agreed, and he dealt the cards for a game of skat. “Cards, cigarettes, tea…” joked the third one, who hadn’t said anything yet. “Just like home…”—“Before,” the first one explained to me, “we played chess. But we don’t have the strength for that anymore.” The officer with the Iron Cross served the tea in dented cups. “I’m sorry, there’s no milk. No sugar, either.” We drank, and they started playing. A noncom came in and began talking in a low voice with the officer with the Iron Cross. “In the village,” he announced angrily, “four dead, thirteen wounded. The Second and Third companies were hit too.” He turned to me with a look that was both enraged and helpless: “You’re in charge of intelligence, Herr Hauptsturmführer, can you explain something to me? Where do they get all these weapons, cannons, and shells from? We’ve been chasing and pursuing them for a year and a half now. We’ve hunted them from the Bug to the Volga, we’ve destroyed their cities, wrecked their factories…. So where are they getting all these fucking tanks and cannons from?” He was almost on the verge of tears. “I’m not in charge of that kind of intelligence,” I explained calmly. “Enemy military potential is the business of the Abwehr and the Fremde Heere Ost. In my opinion, it was underestimated from the start. And also, they managed to evacuate a lot of factories. Their production capacity in the Urals seems considerable.” The officer appeared to want to continue the conversation, but was obviously too tired. He went back to playing cards in silence. A little later, I asked them about the Russian defeatist propaganda. The one who had invited us got up, passed behind the partition, and returned with some pieces of paper. “They send us this.” One of them was a simple poem written in German, entitled “Think About Your Child!” and signed by a certain Erich Weinert; the other ended with a quotation: If German soldiers or officers surrender, the Red Army must take them prisoner and spare their lives (Order No. 55 of the People’s Commissar for Defense J. Stalin). The work was quite sophisticated; the language and typography were excellent. “And is it working?” I asked. The officers looked at each other. “Unfortunately, yes,” the third finally said.—“Impossible to prevent the men from reading them,” the one with the Iron Cross said.—“Recently,” the third one went on, “during an attack, an entire platoon surrendered without firing a shot. Fortunately, another platoon was able to intervene and block the attack. Finally we pushed the Reds back, and they didn’t take their prisoners with them. A lot of them had been killed during the fighting; we shot the others.” The Leutnant with the Iron Cross gave him a black look and he fell silent. “Can I keep this?” I asked, pointing to the papers. “If you like. We keep them for another purpose.” I folded them and put them away in my jacket pocket. Hohenegg was finishing the game and got up: “Shall we go?” We thanked the three officers and returned to Hohenegg’s isba, where I prepared a small meal with my tinned meat and some slices of grilled onion. “I’m sorry, Hauptsturmführer, but I left my Cognac in Gumrak.”—“Oh, that can be for another time.” We talked about the officers; Hohenegg told me about the strange obsessions that seized some of them, like the Oberstleutnant from the Forty-fourth Division who had demolished an entire isba where a dozen of his men were sheltering, to heat water for a bath, and then who, after soaking for a long time and shaving himself, had put his uniform back on and shot himself in the mouth. “But Doktor,” I pointed out, “you must know that in Latin ‘to besiege’ is obsidere. Stalingrad is an obsessed city.”—“Yes. Let’s go to bed. The morning wake-up is a little brutal.” Hohenegg had a mattress and a sleeping bag; he found two blankets for me and I rolled up in my fleece-lined coat. “You should see my quarters in Gumrak,” he said as he lay down. “I have a bunker with wooden walls, heated, and clean sheets. Luxury.” Clean sheets: that, I said to myself, was something to dream about. A hot bath and clean sheets. Was it possible that I would die without ever taking another bath? Yes, it was possible, and seen from Hohenegg’s isba, it seemed even probable. Once again, an immense desire to weep overwhelmed me. That seized me often nowadays."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 11:00"|11:00|"The village of Rakotino remained strangely silent. We were less than a kilometer from the front, but since I arrived I had heard just a few gunshots. The clacking of the typewriter resounded in this silence and made it even more nerve-wracking. At least my runs had calmed down. Finally, Hohenegg stowed his papers into a briefcase, got up, and stuck a scruffy shapka onto his round skull. “Give me your paybook,” he said, “I’m going to look for some soup. You’ll find a little wood next to the stove: start it up again, but use as little as possible. We have to keep till tomorrow with that.” He went out; I busied myself next to the stove. The wood supply was indeed meager: a few wet fence pickets, with bits of barbed wire attached. I finally managed to light a piece after cutting it up. Hohenegg returned with a mess tin of soup and a thick slice of Kommissbrot. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but they refuse to give you a ration without a written order from the HQ of the Panzer Corps. We’ll share.”—“Don’t worry,” I replied, “I anticipated that.” I went over to my coat and took from the pockets a piece of bread, some dry biscuits, and some tinned meat. “Magnificent!” he exclaimed. “Keep the tin for tonight, I have an onion: it’ll be a feast. For lunch, I have this.” He took a piece of bacon wrapped in a Soviet newspaper out of his bag. With a pocket knife, he cut the bread into slices and also cut two thick slices of bacon; he placed all of it directly on the stove, with the mess tin of soup. “Sorry, but I don’t have a saucepan.” While the bacon sizzled, he stored his typewriter away and spread the newspaper out on the table. We ate the bacon on the warmed slices of black bread: the slightly melted fat seeped into the thick bread, and it was delicious. Hohenegg offered me his soup; I refused, pointing to my stomach. He raised his eyebrows: “The Flux?” I nodded. “Be careful with that. Normally one gets over it, but here, it can carry men away in a few days. They become dehydrated and die.” He explained the hygienic procedures I should follow. “That can be a little complicated here,” I pointed out.—“Yes, that’s true,” he acknowledged sadly. While we were finishing our bacon toast, he talked to me about lice and typhus. “We already have a few cases, which we isolate as well as we can,” he explained. “But inevitably, an epidemic will break out.

Some of the food they distribute to the troops is even harmful; for example, canned meat like yours, very rich, sometimes kills men who haven’t eaten anything except bread and soup for weeks; their organism can’t bear the shock, the heart pumps too quickly and suddenly gives out. There’s also the butter, which keeps arriving: it’s delivered in frozen blocks, and out in the steppe, the Landsers don’t have anything to make fires with, so they break it up with an axe and suck on the pieces. That provokes horrible diarrhea that soon finishes them off. If you want to know the truth, many of the bodies I receive have their pants still full of shit, frozen fortunately: in the end, they’re too weak to drop their pants. And note that these are bodies picked up at the front lines, not in the hospitals. In short, to return to my theory, it will be hard to demonstrate, but it seems plausible to me. The metabolism itself is affected by the cold and fatigue, and can no longer function properly.”—“And fear?”—“Fear too, of course. We saw it during the Great War: under some particularly intense bombardments, the heart fails; we find young, healthy, well-fed men dead without the slightest wound. But here I’d say rather that it’s an aggravating factor, not a primary cause. Once again, I have to continue my investigations. It won’t be much use for the Sixth Army, I’m sure, but I flatter myself that it will serve science, and that’s what helps me get up in the morning; that, and the inevitable salyut of our friends across the lines. This Kessel, in fact, is a giant laboratory. A genuine researcher’s paradise. I have as many bodies at my disposal as I could wish for, perfectly preserved, even if it’s sometimes a little hard to defrost them. I have to force my poor assistants to spend the night with them near the stove, turning them over regularly. The other day, in Baburkin, one of them fell asleep; the next morning, I found my subject frozen on one side and roasted on the other. Come along now, it’ll soon be time.”—“Time? Time for what?”—“You’ll see.” Hohenegg gathered up his briefcase and his typewriter and put on his coat; before going out, he snuffed the candle. Outside, it was dark. I followed him to a balka behind the village, where he slithered, feet first, into a bunker that was almost invisible beneath the snow. Three officers were sitting on little stools around a candle. “Good evening, meine Herren,” Hohenegg said. “Let me introduce Hauptsturmführer Dr. Aue, who has very kindly come to visit us.” I shook hands with the officers and, since there was no other stool, sat down on the frozen ground, pulling my coattails under me. Despite the fleece lining, I felt the cold. “The Soviet commander opposite us is a man of remarkable punctuality,” Hohenegg explained to me. “Every day, since the middle of the month, he has sprayed this sector three times a day, at 05:30, 11:00, and 16:00 sharp. In the meantime, nothing, aside from a few mortar shells. It’s very practical for my work.” Indeed, three minutes later, I heard the piercing screech, followed by a close series of enormous explosions, of a volley of “Stalin organs.” The whole bunker shook, snow came down and half filled the entryway, clumps of earth rained from the ceiling. The frail light of the candle flickered, projecting monstrous shadows on the exhausted, badly shaved faces of the officers. Other volleys followed, punctuated by the staccato detonations of tank or artillery shells. The noise had become a mad, insane thing, living its own life, occupying the air and pressing against the partly obstructed entrance of the bunker. I was seized with terror at the idea of being buried alive; I would almost have fled, but I got control of myself. After ten minutes the pounding abruptly stopped. But the noise, its presence and pressure, took longer to withdraw and dissipate. The acrid smell of cordite stung the nose and eyes. One of the officers cleared away the bunker’s entrance by hand. We went crawling out. Above the balka, the village looked crushed, swept as if by a storm; isbas were burning, but I soon saw that only a few houses had been struck: the bulk of the shells must have been aimed at the trenches. “The only problem,” Hohenegg commented as he brushed earth and snow off his cloak, “is that they never aim at quite the same spot. That would be much more practical. Let’s go see if our humble refuge has survived.” The hut was still standing; the stove was even giving off a little warmth. “Would you like to come over for some tea?” offered one of the officers who had accompanied us. We followed him to another isba, divided in half by a partition; the first room, where the two others already sat, was also equipped with a stove. “Here, in the village, it’s all right,” the officer said. “We find some wood after each bombardment. But the men on the line don’t have anything. At the slightest little wound, they die of shock and frostbite caused by the loss of blood. We rarely have time to evacuate them to a hospital.” Another officer was preparing the “tea,” some Schlüter ersatz. All three of them were Leutnants or Oberleutnants, very young; they moved and spoke slowly, almost apathetically. The one who was making the tea was wearing the Iron Cross. I offered them some cigarettes: this produced the same effect on them as it had with the Croatian officer. One of them took out a greasy pack of cards: “Do you play?” I made a sign that I didn’t, but Hohenegg agreed, and he dealt the cards for a game of skat. “Cards, cigarettes, tea…” joked the third one, who hadn’t said anything yet. “Just like home…”—“Before,” the first one explained to me, “we played chess. But we don’t have the strength for that anymore.” The officer with the Iron Cross served the tea in dented cups. “I’m sorry, there’s no milk. No sugar, either.” We drank, and they started playing. A noncom came in and began talking in a low voice with the officer with the Iron Cross. “In the village,” he announced angrily, “four dead, thirteen wounded. The Second and Third companies were hit too.” He turned to me with a look that was both enraged and helpless: “You’re in charge of intelligence, Herr Hauptsturmführer, can you explain something to me? Where do they get all these weapons, cannons, and shells from? We’ve been chasing and pursuing them for a year and a half now. We’ve hunted them from the Bug to the Volga, we’ve destroyed their cities, wrecked their factories…. So where are they getting all these fucking tanks and cannons from?” He was almost on the verge of tears. “I’m not in charge of that kind of intelligence,” I explained calmly. “Enemy military potential is the business of the Abwehr and the Fremde Heere Ost. In my opinion, it was underestimated from the start. And also, they managed to evacuate a lot of factories. Their production capacity in the Urals seems considerable.” The officer appeared to want to continue the conversation, but was obviously too tired. He went back to playing cards in silence. A little later, I asked them about the Russian defeatist propaganda. The one who had invited us got up, passed behind the partition, and returned with some pieces of paper. “They send us this.” One of them was a simple poem written in German, entitled “Think About Your Child!” and signed by a certain Erich Weinert; the other ended with a quotation: If German soldiers or officers surrender, the Red Army must take them prisoner and spare their lives (Order No. 55 of the People’s Commissar for Defense J. Stalin). The work was quite sophisticated; the language and typography were excellent. “And is it working?” I asked. The officers looked at each other. “Unfortunately, yes,” the third finally said.—“Impossible to prevent the men from reading them,” the one with the Iron Cross said.—“Recently,” the third one went on, “during an attack, an entire platoon surrendered without firing a shot. Fortunately, another platoon was able to intervene and block the attack. Finally we pushed the Reds back, and they didn’t take their prisoners with them. A lot of them had been killed during the fighting; we shot the others.” The Leutnant with the Iron Cross gave him a black look and he fell silent. “Can I keep this?” I asked, pointing to the papers. “If you like. We keep them for another purpose.” I folded them and put them away in my jacket pocket. Hohenegg was finishing the game and got up: “Shall we go?” We thanked the three officers and returned to Hohenegg’s isba, where I prepared a small meal with my tinned meat and some slices of grilled onion. “I’m sorry, Hauptsturmführer, but I left my Cognac in Gumrak.”—“Oh, that can be for another time.” We talked about the officers; Hohenegg told me about the strange obsessions that seized some of them, like the Oberstleutnant from the Forty-fourth Division who had demolished an entire isba where a dozen of his men were sheltering, to heat water for a bath, and then who, after soaking for a long time and shaving himself, had put his uniform back on and shot himself in the mouth. “But Doktor,” I pointed out, “you must know that in Latin ‘to besiege’ is obsidere. Stalingrad is an obsessed city.”—“Yes. Let’s go to bed. The morning wake-up is a little brutal.” Hohenegg had a mattress and a sleeping bag; he found two blankets for me and I rolled up in my fleece-lined coat. “You should see my quarters in Gumrak,” he said as he lay down. “I have a bunker with wooden walls, heated, and clean sheets. Luxury.” Clean sheets: that, I said to myself, was something to dream about. A hot bath and clean sheets. Was it possible that I would die without ever taking another bath? Yes, it was possible, and seen from Hohenegg’s isba, it seemed even probable. Once again, an immense desire to weep overwhelmed me. That seized me often nowadays."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
19:17|1917|"One of the Ukrainians led in the handcuffed man. He wore a tank crewman’s short yellow jacket, oily, its right sleeve torn at the seam; his face was completely flayed on one side, as if peeled open; on the other, a bluish bruise almost closed his eye; but he must have shaved right before he was captured. The Ukrainian brutally sent him flying into a little classroom chair in front of my desk. “Take off his handcuffs,” I ordered. “And go wait in the hallway.” The Ukrainian shrugged his shoulders, undid the handcuffs, and went out. The Commissar massaged his wrists. “Nice guys, our national traitors, aren’t they?” he said pleasantly. Despite his accent, his German was clear. “You can keep them when you leave.”—“We’re not going to leave,” I replied curtly.—“Ah, all the better. That will save us the task of running after them to shoot them.”—“I am Hauptsturmführer Dr. Aue,” I said. And you?” He made a slight bow on his chair: “Pravdin, Ilya Semionovich, at your service.” I took out one of my last packs of cigarettes: “Do you smoke?” He smiled, revealing two missing teeth: “Why do cops always offer cigarettes? Every time I’ve been arrested, they’ve offered me cigarettes. This being said, I won’t refuse.” I handed him one, and he leaned over so I could light it. “And your rank?” I asked. He exhaled a long puff of smoke with a sigh of contentment: “Your soldiers are dying of hunger, but I see that the officers still have good cigarettes. I’m a Regimental Commissar. But recently they gave us military ranks and I was made a Lieutenant-Colonel.”—“But you’re a member of the Party, not an officer in the Red Army.”—“That is correct. And you? You’re also from the Gestapo?”—“From the SD. It’s not quite the same thing.”—“I know the difference. I’ve already interrogated enough of your own.”—“And how could a Communist like you let himself be captured?” His face darkened: “During an assault, a shell exploded next to me and I was hit in the head by some rubble.” He pointed to the scorched part of his face. “I was knocked out. I suppose my comrades left me for dead. When I regained consciousness, I was in the hands of your people. There was nothing I could do,” he concluded sadly.—“A high-ranking politruk who goes up to the front line, that’s pretty rare, isn’t it?”—“The commanding officer had been killed and I had to rally the men. But in general, I agree with you: the men don’t see enough Party leaders under fire. Some abuse their privileges. But these abuses will be corrected.” With his fingertips, he delicately felt the purplish, wounded skin around his swollen eye. “Is that from the explosion too?” I asked. He gave a gap-toothed smile: “No, that’s from your colleagues. You must be quite familiar with that sort of method.”—“Your NKVD uses the same.”—“Absolutely. I’m not complaining.” I paused: “How old are you, if I may?” I finally asked. “Forty-two. I was born with the century, like your Himmler.”—“So you witnessed the Revolution?” He laughed: “Of course! I was a Bolshevik activist when I was fifteen. I was a member of a workers’ soviet in Petrograd. You can’t imagine what a time that was! A great wind of freedom.”—“It’s changed a lot, then.” He became pensive: “Yes. That’s true. Probably the Russian people weren’t ready for such an immense, immediate freedom. But that will come, little by little. They must be educated first.”—“And your German, where did you learn that?” He smiled again: “On my own, when I was sixteen, with some prisoners of war. Afterward, Lenin himself sent me to the German Communists. Can you believe that I knew Liebknecht, Luxemburg! Extraordinary people. And after the civil war, I returned to Germany many times, secretly, to keep up contacts with Thälmann and others. You don’t know what my life has been like. In 1929, I acted as an interpreter for your officers who came to train in Soviet Russia, to test your new weapons and your new tactics. We learned a lot with you.”—“Yes, but it didn’t do you any good. Stalin liquidated all the officers who had adopted our concepts, beginning with Tukhachevsky.”—“I miss Tukhachevsky. Personally, I mean. Politically, I can’t judge Stalin. Maybe it was a mistake. The Bolsheviks make mistakes too. But the important thing is that we have the strength to purge our own ranks regularly, to eliminate those who deviate, who let themselves be corrupted. It’s a strength that you lack: your Party is rotting from within.”—“With us, too, there are problems. In the SD, we know it better than anyone, and we’re working to make the Party and the Volk better.” He smiled softly: “In the end, our two systems aren’t so different. In principle at least.”—“That’s an odd statement, for a Communist.”—“Not really, if you think about it. What difference, at bottom, is there between National Socialism and socialism in a single country?”—“In that case, why are we locked together in such a death struggle?”—“You’re the ones who wanted it, not us. We were ready to make compromises. But it’s as once before, with the Christians and the Jews: instead of joining forces with the People of God with whom they had everything in common, to form a united front against the pagans, the Christians preferred, no doubt out of jealousy, to let themselves be paganized and to turn against the witnesses of truth, to their own misfortune. That was a huge waste.”—“I’m guessing that in your comparison, the Jews are you?”—“Of course. After all, you took everything from us, even if only to caricature it. And I’m not talking about symbols, like the red flag and the First of May. I’m talking about the concepts that are dearest to your Weltanschauung.”—“In what sense?” He began to count on his fingers, in the Russian way, folding them down one by one, starting with the little finger: “Where communism aims for a classless society, you preach the Volksgemeinschaft, which is basically strictly the same thing, reduced to your borders. Where Marx saw the proletariat as the bearer of truth, you decided that the so-called German race is a proletarian race, incarnation of Good and morality; consequently, for class struggle, you substituted the German proletarian war against capitalist governments. In economy too your ideas are just deformations of our values. I know your political economy well, since before the war I translated articles from your specialized newspapers for the Party. Where Marx posited a theory of value based on labor, your Hitler declares: Our German mark, which is not backed by gold, is worth more than gold. This rather obscure phrase was glossed by Goebbels’s right-hand man, Dietrich, who explained that National Socialism had understood that the best foundation for a currency is confidence in the productive forces of the nation and in the leadership of the State. The result is that for you, money becomes a fetish that represents the productive power of your country, hence a total aberration. Your relations with your great capitalists are grossly hypocritical, especially since your minister Speer’s reforms: your leaders continue to advocate free enterprise, but your industries are all subject to a plan and their profits are limited to six percent, with the State appropriating the rest in addition to the production.” He fell silent. “National Socialism also has its deviations,” I finally replied. I briefly explained Ohlendorf’s theses to him. “Yes,” he said, “I know his articles. But he too is mistaken. Because you didn’t imitate Marxism; you perverted it. The substitution of race for class, which leads to your proletarian racism, is absurd.”—“No more than your notion of the continual war of classes. Classes are a historical given; they appeared at a certain moment and will likewise disappear, harmoniously dissolving into the Volksgemeinschaft, instead of tearing each other to pieces. Whereas race is a biological given, natural, and thus undeniable.” He raised his hand: “Listen, I won’t argue with you, since it’s a question of faith, and so logical demonstrations, reasoning, won’t serve any purpose. But you can at least agree with me on one point: even if the analysis of the categories at stake is different, our ideologies have this basic thing in common, which is that they are both essentially deterministic; racial determinism for you, economic determinism for us, but determinism all the same. We both believe that man doesn’t freely choose his fate, but that it is imposed on him by nature or history. And we both draw the conclusion that objective enemies exist, that certain categories of human beings can and must legitimately be eliminated not for what they’ve done or even thought, but for what they are. In that, we differ only in the definition of the categories: for you, the Jews, Gypsies, the Poles, and, even I believe, the mentally ill; for us, the Kulaks, the bourgeois, the Party deviationists. At bottom, it’s the same thing; we both reject the homo economicus of the capitalists, the egotistical, individualistic man trapped in his illusion of freedom, in favor of a homo faber: Not a self-made man but a made man, you might say in English, or a man yet to be made, since communist man must still be constructed, educated, just like your perfect National Socialist. And this man-to-be-made justifies the pitiless liquidation of everything that is uneducable, and thus justifies the NKVD and the Gestapo, gardeners of the social body, who tear out the weeds and force the good plants to follow their stakes.” I handed him another cigarette and lit one for myself: “You have broad ideas, for a Bolshevist politruk.” He laughed, a little bitterly: “That’s because my old relations, German and otherwise, fell into disfavor. When you are sidelined, it gives you time, and especially a perspective, to reflect.”—“Is that what explains why a man with your past holds such a modest position?”—“No doubt. At one time, you know, I was close to Radek—but never to Trotsky, which is why I’m still here. But my lack of advancement doesn’t bother me, you know. I have no personal ambition. I serve my Party and my country, and I’m happy to die for them. But that doesn’t keep one from thinking.”—“But if you believe our two systems are identical, why are you fighting against us?”—“I never said they were identical! And you’re much too intelligent to think so. I tried to show you that the ways our ideologies function are similar. The contents, of course, differ: class and race. For me, your National Socialism is a heresy of Marxism.”—“How, in your opinion, is Bolshevik ideology superior to National Socialism?”—“In that it wants the good of all humanity, whereas yours is selfish, it just wants the good of the Germans. Not being German, it’s impossible for me to adhere to it, even if I wanted to.”—“Yes, but if you were born a bourgeois, like me, it would be impossible to become a Bolshevik: you would remain, whatever your innermost convictions, an objective enemy.”—“That’s true, but that’s because of education. A child of bourgeois parents, a grandchild of bourgeois parents, educated from birth in a socialist country, will be a good, a true Communist, above suspicion. When classless society becomes a reality, all classes will be dissolved within communism. In theory, this can be extended to the whole world, which isn’t the case of National Socialism.”—“In theory, maybe. But you can’t prove it, and in reality you commit atrocious crimes in the name of this utopia.”—“I won’t answer that your crimes are worse. I’ll simply tell you that if we can’t prove the validity of our hopes to someone who refuses to believe in the truth of Marxism, we can and we will concretely prove to you the inanity of your own. Your biological racism postulates that the races are unequal among themselves, that some are stronger and more valid than others, and that the strongest and the most valid of all is the German race. But when Berlin looks like this city”—he pointed his finger at the ceiling—“and when our brave soldiers are camping on your Unter den Linden, you’ll at least be forced, if you want to save your racist faith, to acknowledge that the Slavic race is stronger than the German race.” I didn’t let myself be intimidated: “You sincerely believe, when you’ve just barely held Stalingrad, that you’re going to take Berlin? You’re joking.”—“I don’t believe it, I know it. You just have to look at the respective military potentials. Without counting the second front that our allies are going to open in Europe soon. You’re finished.”—“We’ll fight to the last man.”—“No doubt, but you’ll perish all the same. And Stalingrad will remain as the symbol of your defeat. Wrongly, too. In my opinion, you already lost the war last year, when we stopped you in front of Moscow. We lost land, cities, men; all that can be replaced. But the Party didn’t collapse, and that was your only hope. Without that, you could even have taken Stalingrad, it wouldn’t have changed anything. And you could have taken Stalingrad, too, if you hadn’t made so many mistakes, if you hadn’t underestimated us so much. It wasn’t inevitable that you’d lose here, that your Sixth Army would be completely destroyed. But if you had taken Stalingrad, then what? We would still have been in Ulianovsk, in Kuibyshev, in Moscow, in Sverdlovsk. And we would have ended up doing the same thing to you a little farther along. Of course, the symbolism wouldn’t have been the same, it wouldn’t have been Stalin’s city. But who is Stalin, really? And what does his hubris and his glory mean to us Bolsheviks? We, here, who are dying every day, what do his daily telephone calls to Zhukov mean to us? It’s not Stalin who gives the men the courage to rush in front of your machine guns. Of course, you need a leader, you need someone to coordinate everything, but that could have been any other man of ability. Stalin is no more irreplaceable than Lenin, or me. Our strategy here has been a strategy of common sense. And our soldiers, our Bolsheviks, would have shown as much courage in Kuibyshev. Despite all our military defeats, our Party and our people have remained unvanquished. Now things are going to go the other way. Your troops are already beginning to evacuate the Caucasus. There’s no doubt whatsoever about our final victory.”—“Maybe,” I retorted. “But at what price for your communism? Ever since the beginning of the war, Stalin has appealed to national values, the only things that truly inspire men, not to communist values. He reintroduced the czarist orders of Suvorov and Kutuzov, as well as golden epaulettes for the officers, which your comrades in Petrogad used to nail to their shoulders in ’seventeen. In the pockets of your dead soldiers, and even of superior officers, we find hidden icons. Better yet, we know from our interrogations that racial values are appearing in broad daylight in the highest spheres of the Party and the Red Army, a Great Russian, anti-Semitic spirit that Stalin and the Party leaders cultivate. You too are beginning to mistrust your Jews; but they’re not a class.”—“What you say is certainly true,” he acknowledged sadly. “Under the pressure of the war, atavisms are resurfacing. But you can’t forget what the Russian people were before 1917, their state of ignorance, of backwardness. We haven’t even had twenty years to educate and correct them; that’s not very long. After the war we’ll resume that task, and little by little all those mistakes will be corrected.”—“I think you’re wrong. The problem isn’t the people: it’s your leaders. Communism is a mask stuck onto the unchanged face of Russia. Your Stalin is a czar, your Politburo are boyars, or greedy and egotistical aristocrats, your Party cadres, the same chinovniki as the ones under Peter or Nicholas. It’s the same Russian autocracy, the same permanent insecurity, the same paranoia of the foreign, the same fundamental inability to govern correctly, the same substitution of terror for the common consensus, and thus for real power, the same unbridled corruption, in other forms, the same incompetence, the same drunkenness. Read the correspondence between Kurbsky and Ivan, read Karamzin, read Custine. The crucial given of your history has never been changed: humiliation, from father to son. Ever since the beginning, but especially since the Mongols, everything humiliates you, and all the politics of your ruling class consists not of correcting this humiliation and its causes, but of hiding it from the rest of the world. Peter’s city is nothing but another Potemkin village: it’s not a window opening onto Europe, but a theater set put up to mask from the West all the poverty and endless filth stretching out behind it. But one can humiliate only those who can be humiliated; and in turn, only the humiliated humiliate. The humiliated of 1917, from Stalin down to the muzhik, have done nothing since then but inflict their fear and their humiliation on others. For in this country of the humiliated, the czar, whatever his strength may be, is powerless, his will is lost in the muddy swamp of his administration, and he is soon reduced, like Peter, to ordering his minions to obey his orders; in front of him people bow, but behind his back, they steal from him or conspire against him; everyone flatters his superiors and oppresses his subordinates, everyone has a slave mentality, raby as you say, and this slave spirit rises to the top; and the greatest slave of all is the czar, who can do nothing against the cowardliness and humiliation of his people of slaves, and who thus, in his powerlessness, kills them, terrorizes them, and humiliates them even more. And every time there’s a real rupture in your history, a real chance to get out of this infernal cycle to begin a new history, you blow it: faced with freedom, the freedom of 1917 you were talking about, everyone, people and leaders alike, recoils and goes to the old tried-and-true methods. The end of the NEP, the declaration of socialism in a single country, is nothing but that. And since hope wasn’t completely extinguished, there had to be purges. The present Great Russianism is only the logical outcome of this process. The Russian, the eternally humiliated man, can never escape from this humiliation except by identifying himself with the abstract glory of Russia. He may work fifteen hours a day in a freezing factory, eat nothing his entire life but black bread and cabbage, and serve a fat boss who calls himself a Marxist-Leninist but who rides around in a limousine with his high-class hookers and his French Champagne—none of that matters to him, so long as the Third Rome is at hand. And this Third Rome can call itself Christian or communist, it’s not important. As for the factory boss, he will constantly tremble for his position, he will flatter his superior and offer him sumptuous gifts and, if he’s demoted, another one identical to him will be appointed in his place, just as greedy, ignorant, and humiliated, and full of scorn for his workers, because after all he serves a proletarian State. One day, no doubt, the communist façade will disappear, with or without violence. Then we’ll discover that same Russia, intact. If you ever do win this war, you’ll emerge from it more National Socialist and more imperialistic than us, but your socialism, unlike ours, will be nothing but an empty name, and you’ll have nothing but nationalism left to cling to. In Germany, and in the capitalist countries, everyone says communism ruined Russia; but I believe it’s the opposite: it’s Russia that ruined communism. It could have been a fine idea, and who can say what would have happened if the Revolution had taken place in Germany rather than Russia? If it had been led by self-assured Germans, like your friends Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht? For my part, I think it would have been a disaster, since it would have exacerbated our specific conflicts, which National Socialism is trying to resolve. But who knows? What is certain is that having been attempted here, the communist experiment could be nothing but a failure. It’s like a medical experiment conducted in a contaminated environment: the results can go straight in the trash.”—“You are an excellent dialectician, and I congratulate you; you sound like a trained Communist. But I am tired and I am not going to argue with you. In any case, all this is nothing but words. Neither you nor I will see the future you describe.”—“Who knows? You’re a high-ranking Commissar. Maybe we’ll send you to a camp to interrogate you.”—“Don’t play with me,” he replied harshly. “Seats in your planes are much too limited for you to evacuate small fry. I know perfectly well I’ll be shot, in a short while or tomorrow. It doesn’t bother me.” He went on in a cheerful voice: “Do you know the French writer Stendhal? Then you’ll certainly have read this phrase Only a death sentence truly distinguishes a man. It’s the only thing that cannot be bought.” I couldn’t help laughing; he too laughed, but more quietly. “But where did you dig that up?” I finally got out. He shrugged his shoulders: “Oh. I’ve read more than just Marx, you know.”—“It’s too bad I have nothing to drink,” I said. “I’d have gladly offered you a glass.” I became serious again: “It’s also too bad we’re enemies. In other circumstances, we could have gotten along.”—“Maybe,” he said pensively, “but also maybe not.” I got up, went to the door, and called the Ukrainian. Then I went back behind my desk. The Commissar had gotten up and was trying to straighten his torn sleeve. Still standing, I offered him the rest of my pack of cigarettes. “Oh, thanks,” he said. “Do you have any matches?” I gave him the box of matches too. The Ukrainian was waiting in the doorway. “Allow me not to shake your hand,” the Commissar said with a little ironic smile.—“Of course,” I replied. The Ukrainian took him by the arm and he went out, putting the pack of cigarettes and the box of matches into his jacket pocket. I shouldn’t have given him the whole pack, I said to myself; he won’t have time to finish it, and the Ukrainians will smoke the rest."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
11:47|"thirteen minutes to noon"|"Thomas, who seemed to have completely recovered from his accident, scolded me amicably, but I didn’t pay any attention to him. To tease him, when I emerged from my Sophocles, I quoted Joseph de Maistre at him: What is a lost battle? It’s a battle you think you have lost. Thomas, delighted, had a sign painted with these words, which was posted in our hallway: this, apparently, earned him Möritz’s congratulations, and the new slogan got as far as General Schmidt, who wanted to adopt it as the motto for the army; but Paulus, it was said, opposed it. Neither Thomas nor I, by mutual agreement, spoke any longer of evacuation; but everyone knew that it was only a question of days, and the fortunate chosen ones of the Wehrmacht were already leaving. I sank into a sordid indifference; only the obsessive fear of typhus shook me now and then, and not content with scrutinizing my eyes and lips, I undressed to look for black spots on my torso. I didn’t even think about the diarrhea anymore; on the contrary, squatting in the stinking latrines, I found a certain tranquility, and would have liked, as when I was a child, to lock myself up in them for hours reading, but there was no light, and no door, either, so I had to make do with a cigarette, one of my last. My fever, almost permanent now, had become a warm cocoon in which I could curl up, and I took an insane enjoyment in my filth, my sweat, my dehydrated skin, my stinging eyes. I hadn’t shaved for days and a fine reddish beard contributed to my voluptuous feeling of dirtiness and neglect. My sick ear was suppurating, resounding by turns like a bell or a muffled siren; sometimes I couldn’t hear anything at all. The fall of Pitomnik had been followed by a few days’ lull; then, around January 20, the methodical annihilation of the Kessel resumed (for these dates, I’m citing books, not my memory, since the calendar had become an abstract notion for me, a fleeting memory of a bygone world). The temperature, after the brief thaw at the beginning of the year, had plummeted catastrophically—it must have been twenty-five or thirty below. The meager fires lit in empty oil drums weren’t enough to warm the wounded; even in town, the soldiers had to wrap their penises in cloth to piss, a stinking rag, preciously guarded in one’s pocket; and others took advantage of these occasions to hold out their hands, swollen with frostbite, beneath the warm stream. All these details were reported to me by the somnambulistic mechanisms of the army; just as somnambulistically, I read and classified these reports, after having issued them a file number; but it had been some time already since I stopped writing reports myself. When Möritz wanted information, I grabbed some reports from the Abwehr at random and brought them to him; maybe Thomas had explained to him that I was sick, he looked at me strangely but didn’t say anything. As for Thomas, he had never returned my scarf, and when I went out to take the air, my neck was cold: but I still went out, the dense stench of the buildings was becoming unbearable. Thomas’s rapid recovery intrigued me: he seemed entirely well, and when I asked him, raising my eyebrows significantly and looking at his abdomen: “So, are you all right?” he looked surprised and answered: “Yes, I’m fine, why shouldn’t I be?” As for me, however, my sores and my fevers weren’t getting any better; I would have liked to know his secret. One of those days, probably around the twentieth or the twenty-first, I went out to smoke in the street, and soon after, Thomas joined me. The sky was clear, cloudless, the cold biting, the sun, streaming everywhere through the gaping openings of the façades, was reflected on the dry snow, brilliant, dazzling, and where it couldn’t reach it projected steel shadows. “Do you hear?” Thomas asked, but my mad ear was ringing, I couldn’t hear anything. “Come.” He pulled me by the sleeve. We skirted round the building and discovered a strange sight: two or three Landsers, wrapped in greatcoats or blankets, were standing near an upright piano in the middle of the little street. A soldier, perched on a little chair, was playing, and the others seemed to be listening to him attentively, but I couldn’t hear anything—it was curious, and it saddened me: I too would have liked to listen to this music, I thought I had as much a right to it as anyone. A few Ukrainians were heading toward us; I recognized Ivan, who made a little sign to me with his hand. My ear was itching terribly, and I couldn’t hear anything anymore: even the words of Thomas, right next to me, reached me now only as an indistinct rumbling. I had the horrible and terrifying impression of living a silent film. Exasperated, I tore off my bandage and buried my pinky into the ear canal; something gave way, a flow of pus gushed out onto my hand and ran onto the neck of my coat. That soothed me a little, but I still could hear almost nothing; the piano, if I turned my ear toward it, seemed to be emitting a watery gurgle; the other ear wasn’t functioning any better; disappointed, I turned aside and slowly walked away. The sunlight was truly splendid, it chiseled each detail of the jagged façades. Behind me, I thought I could make out some agitation: I turned around, Thomas and Ivan were gesturing toward me, the others were looking at me. I didn’t know what they wanted, but I was embarrassed at being such an object of attention; I made a friendly little sign to them and went on walking. I glanced at them again: Ivan was running toward me, but I was distracted by a slight tap on my forehead: a piece of gravel, perhaps, or an insect, since when I felt it, a little drop of blood beaded on my finger. I wiped it off and continued on toward the Volga, which I knew lay somewhere that way. This was a sector where our forces held the riverbank; and I still hadn’t seen it, this famous Volga, and I resolutely headed in that direction, to contemplate it at least once before leaving this city. The streets wound between a shambles of quiet, deserted ruins lit by the cold January sun; it was very calm and I found it extraordinarily pleasant; if there were gunshots, I didn’t hear them. The icy air invigorated me. The pus had stopped flowing from my ear, which let me hope that the source of infection was pierced once and for all; I felt in good form and full of strength. After the last buildings, running along cliffs that loomed over the great river, there was an abandoned railway, the tracks already eaten by rust. Beyond stretched the white surface of the river caught in the ice, and then beyond that the other bank, the one we had never reached, completely flat and also white and as if emptied of all life. Around me, there was no one, I didn’t see any trenches or positions, the lines must have been farther up. Emboldened, I climbed down the steep sandy bank and found myself at the river’s edge. First hesitatingly, then with more confidence, I set one foot on the snow-dusted ice, then another: I was walking on the Volga, and it made me as happy as a child. The snowflakes lifted from the ice by the light wind danced in the sun, a little will-o’-the-wisp around my feet. In front of me, a dark hole opened up in the ice, quite wide, probably pierced by a high-caliber shell that had fallen short; deep inside the hole, water was flowing quickly, almost green in the sun, fresh, alluring; I leaned over and dunked my hand in it—it didn’t seem cold: gathering it in both hands, I rinsed my face, my ear, the back of my neck, then drank several mouthfuls. I took off my shuba, folded it carefully, put it together with my cap on the ice, then, breathing in deeply, I dove in. The water was clear and welcoming, a maternal kind of warmth. The swift current created whirlpools that soon carried me away under the ice. All kinds of things were passing by me, which I could clearly make out in this green water: horses whose feet the current was moving as if they were galloping, fat and almost flat fish, bottom-feeders, Russian corpses with swollen faces, entwined in their curious brown capes, pieces of clothing and uniforms, tattered flags floating on their poles, a wagon wheel that, probably soaked in oil, was still burning as it swirled beneath the water. A body bumped into me, then went on its way; this one was wearing a German uniform; as it drifted farther away I saw its face and its dancing blond curls, it was Voss, smiling. I tried to catch up with him but an eddy separated us, and by the time I reestablished my position, he had disappeared. Above me, the ice formed an opaque screen, but the air lasted in my lungs, I wasn’t worried and kept swimming, passing sunken barges full of handsome young men sitting in rows, their weapons still in their hands, little fish threading through their hair agitated by the current. Then slowly in front of me the water grew lighter, columns of green light plunged down from holes in the ice, became a forest, then melded into each other as the blocks of ice drifted farther apart. I finally rose back to the surface to regain my breath. A little iceberg bumped into me, I dove back down, straightened out, rose up again. Here, the river carried almost no more blocks of ice. Upriver, to my left, a Russian ship was drifting in the current, lying on its side, gently burning. Despite the sun, a few large flakes of luminous snow were falling, which lay hidden as soon as they touched the water. Paddling with my hands, I turned around: the city, stretched all along the shore, lay hidden behind a thick curtain of black smoke. Above my head, seagulls were reeling and shrieking, looking at me curiously, or possibly calculatingly, then flying off to perch on a block of ice; the sea was still far away, though; had they come all the way up from Astrakhan? Swallows too were whirling around and skimming the water’s surface. I began swimming calmly toward the left bank. Finally I touched bottom and emerged from the water. The shore, on this bank, was made of a fine sand that rose gently up, forming little dunes; beyond, everything was flat. Logically I should have found myself at the level of the Krasnaya Sloboda, but I didn’t see anything: no artillery pieces neatly lined up, no trenches, no village, no soldiers, no one. A few scraggly trees adorned the top of the dunes or leaned toward the Volga, which was flowing swiftly behind me; somewhere, a linnet was calling; a grass snake threaded between my feet and disappeared into the sand. I climbed the dunes and looked around: in front of me stretched an almost bare steppe, a land the color of ash lightly powdered with snow, with here and there a brown, short, dense, grass, and a few tufts of sagebrush; to the south, a line of poplars barred the horizon, probably bordering an irrigation canal; there was nothing else to be seen. I searched through my jacket pocket and fished out my pack of cigarettes, but they were soaking wet. My wet clothes clung to my skin, but I wasn’t cold; the air was gentle and mild. Then I felt a wave of fatigue, probably the effects of swimming: I fell to my knees and dug my fingers into the dry ground, still frozen by winter. I finally managed to pull up some clumps of earth, which I greedily stuffed into my mouth. They had a somewhat bitter, mineral taste, but when mixed with my saliva this earth gave off almost vegetable sensations, a fibrous life, which was still disappointing; I would have liked it to be soft, warm, and oily, for it to melt in my mouth, and for me to be able to bury my whole body in it, slip into it as into a grave. In the Caucasus, the mountain people have a curious way of digging graves: first they cut a trench two meters deep; then, at the bottom, on one side they dig out a niche with a slanting roof. The dead man, without a coffin, wrapped in a white shroud, is placed on his side in this recess, his face turned toward Mecca; then the alcove is walled in with bricks, or wood if the family is poor; only then is the ditch filled in, the excess earth forming an oblong hillock; yet the dead man doesn’t lie beneath this hillock, but right next to it. That, I said to myself when this custom was described to me, is a grave that would suit me, at least the cold horror of the thing is clear, and also it must be more comfortable, more intimate perhaps. But here there was no one to help me dig, and I didn’t have a tool, not even a knife: so I began walking, more or less in an easterly direction. It was a vast plain with no one on it, neither living on the earth nor dead beneath it; and I walked a long time beneath a colorless sky, which didn’t let me judge the time (my watch, set like all military watches to Berlin time, hadn’t stood up to the swim and showed an eternal thirteen minutes to noon). Here and there a bright red poppy grew, the only patches of color in this gloomy landscape; but when I tried to pick one, it turned gray and crumbled in a light puff of ash. Finally, in the distance, I made out some shapes. As I approached, I saw that it was a long white dirigible, floating over a large kurgan. Several figures were walking on the sides of the tumulus: three of them detached from the group and came toward me. When they were close enough, I could see that they were wearing white lab coats over suits, with high, slightly old-fashioned detachable collars and black ties; one of them also wore a bowler hat. “Guten Tag, meine Herren,” I said politely when they were standing in front of me. “Bonjour, monsieur,” said the one wearing a hat. He asked me in French what I was doing there and, answering in the same language, I explained to him as best I could. The two others nodded as they listened. When I had finished my narrative, the man with the hat said: “In that case, you’ll have to come with us; the doctor will want to talk with you.”—“If you like. Who is this doctor?”—“Dr. Sardine, the head of our expedition.” They brought me to the foot of the kurgan; three thick cables were anchoring the dirigible, a zeppelin that swayed slowly in the breeze more than fifty meters above our heads, its long oval mass carrying a two-story metal gondola. Another, thinner cable seemed to provide a telephone connection: one of the men spoke briefly into a receiver set up on a folding table. On the kurgan, the other gentlemen were digging, probing, measuring. I raised my head again: a kind of basket was slowly descending from the gondola, swaying back and forth in the wind. When it got close to the ground two men grasped it and guided it. This large basket was made of saplings and woven wicker; the man with the bowler hat opened a door and motioned me to get into it; then he joined me and closed it. The cable began to rise and with a heavy leap the basket tore itself from the ground; with our bodies as ballast, it reeled less, but it still made for a sort of seasick effect, and I gripped the edge; my chaperone held onto his hat. I looked at the steppe: as far as I could see, not one tree, not one house, just, at the horizon, a kind of hump, probably another kurgan."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 05:00"|"around five o’clock"|"Thomas must have begun to guess my state of mind, since after the first few days, I stopped calling him and going out to dinner with him; to tell the truth, I preferred to wander around the city, or contemplate the lions, giraffes, and elephants in the zoo from my balcony, or else float in my luxurious bathtub, wasting hot water without the slightest shame. In his commendable anxiety to entertain me, Thomas asked me to go out with a young woman, a secretary of the Führer’s who was spending her leave in Berlin and didn’t know many people there; out of politeness, I didn’t want to refuse. I took her to dinner at the Hotel Kempinsky: even though the dishes had been given idiotic patriotic names, the cuisine was still excellent, and at the sight of my medals, they didn’t bother me much with rationing issues. The young woman, whose name was Grete V., greedily fell upon the oysters, sliding them one after the other between her rows of teeth: in Rastenburg, apparently, they didn’t eat very well. “And it could be worse!” she exclaimed. “At least we don’t have to eat the same thing as the Führer.” While I poured her more wine, she told me that Zeitzler, the new Chief of Staff of the OKH, scandalized by Göring’s brazen lies about the Kessel airlift, had openly started in December to have himself served the same ration, in the Kasino, as the soldiers of the Sixth Army. He had quickly lost weight, and the Führer had had to force him to stop these unhealthy demonstrations; on the other hand, Champagne and Cognac had been banned. As she spoke, I observed her: her appearance was far from ordinary. She had a strong, very wide jaw; her face tried to look normal but seemed to mask a heavy, secret desire, which welled up through the bloody stroke of her lipstick. Her hands were very animated, her fingers reddened from bad circulation; she had fine, birdlike joints, bony, sharp; and peculiar marks on her left wrist, like the traces of a bracelet or cord. I found her elegant and animated, but veiled by a faint insincerity. Since wine made her voluble, I had her talk about the Führer’s private life, which she described with a surprising lack of restraint: every night, he discoursed for hours, and his monologues were so repetitive, so boring, so sterile, that the secretaries, assistants, and adjutants had set up a system of rotation to listen to him; the ones whose turn it was didn’t go to bed till dawn. “Of course,” she added, “he is a genius, the savior of Germany. But this war is exhausting him.” In the evening, around five o’clock, after the meetings but before the dinner, the movies, and the nighttime tea, he held a coffee break with the secretaries; there, surrounded solely by women, he was much more cordial—before Stalingrad at least; he joked, teased the girls, and almost never discussed politics. “Does he flirt with you?” I asked with amusement. She looked serious: “Oh no, never!” She asked me about Stalingrad; I gave her a fierce, sardonic description, which at first made her laugh till tears came, but then made her so uneasy that she cut me off. I accompanied her back to her hotel, near the Anhalter Bahnhof; she invited me to come up for a drink, but I politely refused; my courtesy had its limits. As soon as I left her, I was filled with a feverish, uneasy feeling: What use was it to me to waste my time this way? What good were gossip and office rumors about our Führer to me? What interest did I have in strutting about this way in front of some paintedup doll who expected only one thing from me? It was better to be quiet. But even in my hotel, first-class though it was, quiet eluded me: the floor beneath mine was having a noisy party, and the music, shouts, and laughter rose up through the floorboards and seized me by the throat. Lying on my bed in the darkness, I thought about the men of the Sixth Army: the evening took place at the beginning of March, the last units had surrendered more than a month before; the survivors, rotting with vermin and fever, must have been on the way to Siberia or Kazakhstan, at the very same moment that I was so laboriously breathing the night air in Berlin, and for them, no music, no laughter—shouts of an entirely different kind. And it wasn’t just them, it was everywhere, the whole world was twisted in pain, and people should not be having fun, not right away in any case, they should wait a little while, a decent amount of time should go by. A mean, fetid anguish rose and suffocated me. I got up, searched through my desk drawer, took out my service pistol, checked it was loaded, put it back. I looked at my watch: 2:00 a.m. I put on my uniform jacket (I hadn’t undressed) and went down without buttoning it. At reception, I asked for the telephone and called Thomas at the apartment he was renting: “Sorry to bother you so late.”—“No, it’s fine. What’s up?” I explained my homicidal urges to him. To my surprise, he didn’t react ironically, but said very seriously: “That’s normal. These people are bastards, profiteers. But if you shoot some of them, you’ll still have problems.”—“What do you suggest, then?”—“Go talk to them. If they don’t calm down, we’ll see. I’ll call some friends.”—“All right, I’ll go.” I hung up and went up to the floor below mine; I easily found the right door and knocked. A tall, beautiful woman in somewhat casual evening dress opened the door, her eyes shining. “Yes?” Behind her, the music roared, I could hear glasses clinking, mad laughter. “Is this your room?” I asked, my heart beating. “No. Wait.” She turned around: “Dicky! Dicky! An officer is asking for you.” A man in a vest, slightly drunk, came to the door; the woman watched us without hiding her curiosity. “Yes, Herr Sturmbannführer?” he asked. “What can I do for you?” His affected, cordial, almost slurred voice conveyed an aristocrat of old stock. I bowed slightly and said in the most neutral tone possible: “I live in the room over yours. I’ve just come back from Stalingrad, where I was seriously wounded and where almost all my comrades died. Your festivities are disturbing me. I wanted to come down and kill you, but I called a friend, who advised me to come talk with you first. So I’ve come to talk with you. It would be better for us all if I don’t have to come down again.” The man had turned pale: “No, no…” He turned around: “Gofi! Stop the music! Stop!” He looked at me: “Excuse us. We’ll stop right away.”—“Thank you.” As I was climbing back up, vaguely satisfied, I heard him shout: “Everyone out! It’s over. Out!” I had touched a nerve, and it wasn’t a question of fear: he too, suddenly, had understood, and he was ashamed. In my room, everything was quiet now; the only noises were from the occasional passing of a car, the trumpeting of an insomniac elephant. But I didn’t calm down: my action appeared to me like play-acting, prompted by a genuine, obscure feeling, but then distorted, diverted into an outward show of rage, conventional. But that was precisely where my problem lay: seeing myself this way, constantly, with this external gaze, this critical camera, how could I utter the slightest authentic word, make the slightest authentic gesture? Everything I did became a spectacle for myself; my thinking itself was just a reflection, and I a poor Narcissus showing off for himself, but who wasn’t fooled by it. This was the dead-end I had run into since the close of my childhood: only Una, before, could pull me out of myself, make me forget myself a little, and after I lost her, I kept looking at myself with a gaze that was confused with hers in thought but that remained, without any way out, my own. Without you, I am not me: and that was pure, deadly terror, unrelated to the delicious terrors of childhood, a sentence with no hope of appeal, with no judgment, either."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"ap 02:31"|two-thirty-one|"I had known Mandelbrod and his partner, Herr Leland, for some time. Many years before, after the Great War—and maybe even before it, but I have no way of checking—my father had worked for them (apparently my uncle had also served as an agent for them on occasion). Their relations, from what I had gleaned little by little, went beyond a simple employer-employee relationship: after my father’s disappearance, Dr. Mandelbrod and Herr Leland had helped my mother in her searches, and may also have supported her financially, but that’s not so certain. And they had continued to play a role in my life; in 1934, when I was preparing to break with my mother, to come to Germany, I got in touch with Mandelbrod, who had long been a respected figure within the Movement; he supported me and offered me his help; it was he too who encouraged me to pursue my studies—for the sake of Germany now, though, and not for France—and who organized my enrollment in Kiel as well as my enlisting in the SS. Despite his Jewish-sounding name, he was, like Minister Rosenberg, a pure German of old Prussian stock, with perhaps a drop of Slavic blood; as for Herr Leland, he was of British origin, but his Germanophile convictions had impelled him to turn his back on his native country long before my birth. They were industrialists, but their exact position would be hard to define. They sat on numerous boards, especially that of IG Farben, and held shares in other companies, without their names being linked to any one in particular; they were said to be very influential in the chemical sector (they were both members of the Reichsgruppe for the chemical industry) and also in the metals sector. Moreover, they had been close to the Party ever since the Kampfzeit, and had contributed to financing it when it was starting up; according to Thomas, with whom I had discussed them once before the war, they held positions in the Führer’s chancellery, but were not entirely subordinate to Philipp Bouhler; and they had access to the highest spheres of the Party chancellery. Finally, the Reichsführer-SS had made them honorary SS-Gruppenführers, and members of the Freundeskreis Himmler; but Thomas, mysteriously, stated that this gave the SS no influence over them, and that any influence there might be worked the other way. He had been very impressed when I told him about my relationship with them, and obviously even envied me a little for having such protectors. Their interest in my career, however, had varied over time: when I had been in effect sidelined, after my 1939 report, I had tried to see them; but that was a busy period, it had taken me several months to get a reply, and it wasn’t until the invasion of France that they invited me to dinner: Herr Leland, as was his custom, remained for the most part taciturn, and Dr. Mandelbrod was mainly concerned with the political situation; my work hadn’t been mentioned, and I hadn’t dared broach the subject myself. I hadn’t seen them again since then. So Mandelbrod’s invitation caught me off guard: What could he want from me? For the occasion, I put on my new uniform and all my decorations. Their private offices occupied the top two floors of a handsome building on Unter den Linden, next to the Academy of Sciences and the headquarters of the Reichsvereinigung Kohle, the Coal Board, where they also played a role. There was no plaque on the entrance. In the lobby, my papers were checked by a young woman with long light brown hair pulled back, who wore charcoal-gray clothes without any insignia, but cut like a uniform, with men’s pants and boots instead of a skirt. Satisfied, she escorted me to a private elevator, which she started up with a key hanging around her neck on a long chain, and accompanied me to the top floor, without a word. I had never come here: in the 1930s, they had another address, and in any case I usually met them in a restaurant or in one of the big hotels. The elevator opened onto a wide reception room furnished in wood and dark leather inset with polished brass and frosted glass decorative elements, elegant and discreet. The woman who escorted me left me there; another woman, in identical costume, took my coat and hung it in a wardrobe. Then she asked me to hand her my service revolver, and holding it with a surprising naturalness in her beautiful carefully manicured fingers, she put it away in a drawer, which she locked shut. I wasn’t made to wait any longer; she led me in through a padded double door. Dr. Mandelbrod was waiting for me at the rear of an immense room, behind a large reddish mahogany desk, his back to a long bay window, also of frosted glass, that let a pale, milky light filter through. He looked even fatter than at our last meeting. Several cats were strolling about the carpets or sleeping on the leather furniture and on his desk. He pointed with his pudgy fingers to a sofa on the left, in front of a low table: “Hello, hello. Have a seat, I’ll be right there.” I had never been able to understand how such a beautiful and melodious voice could emanate from so many layers of fat; it still surprised me. With my cap under my arm, I crossed the room and took a seat, displacing a sleek tabby cat with white paws, who didn’t seem to hold it against me, but gently slipped under the table to settle down elsewhere. I examined the room: all the walls were padded with leather, and aside from the stylish ornaments such as those in the antechamber, there were no decorations, no paintings or photographs, not even a portrait of the Führer. The surface of the low table, on the other hand, was made of superb marquetry, a complex labyrinth in precious wood, protected by a thick glass plate. Only the cat hair clinging to furniture and rugs disfigured this discreet, hushed décor. A vaguely unpleasant smell pervaded the room. One of the cats rubbed against my boots, purring, its tail up; I tried to get rid of it with the tip of my foot, but it didn’t pay any attention. Mandelbrod, in the meantime, must have pressed a hidden button: an almost invisible door opened in the wall to the right of his desk and another woman came in, dressed like the first two, but with completely blond hair. She walked behind Mandelbrod, pulled him back, swiveled him around, and pushed him alongside his desk toward me. I got up. Mandelbrod had in fact gotten fatter; whereas before he got around in an ordinary wheelchair, he was now settled in a vast round armchair mounted on a little platform, like an enormous Oriental idol, placid, bovine, colossal. The woman pushed this massive apparatus without any visible effort, probably by starting up and controlling an electrical system. She set him in front of the low table; I walked round to shake his hand and he scarcely brushed me with the tips of his fingers while the woman left through the door by which she had come in. “Please, do sit down,” he murmured in his beautiful voice. He was dressed in a thick brown wool suit; his tie disappeared beneath a breastplate of flesh hanging from his neck. A rude noise came from beneath him and a horrible smell reached me; I made an effort to remain impassive. At the same time a cat jumped onto his knees and he sneezed, then began caressing it, then sneezed again: each sneeze came like a little explosion that made the cat jump. “I am allergic to these poor creatures,” he sniffled, “but I love them too much.” The woman reappeared with a tray: she came up to us with a measured, assured step, placed a tea service on the low table, attached a tray to Mandelbrod’s armrest, poured us two cups, and again disappeared—all as discreetly and silently as the cats. “There’s milk and sugar,” said Mandelbrod. “Help yourself. I don’t take any.” He examined me for a few minutes: an impish gleam glinted in his little eyes almost drowned beneath folds of fat. “You have changed,” he declared. “The East did you good. You have matured. Your father would have been proud.” These words touched me to the quick: “You think?”—“Certainly. You’ve done some remarkable work: the Reichsführer himself took note of your reports. He showed us the album you prepared in Kiev: your chief wanted to take all the credit for himself, but we knew the idea came from you. In any case that was a trifle. But the reports you wrote, especially these past few months, were excellent. In my opinion, you have a brilliant future before you.” He fell silent and contemplated me: “How is your wound?” he asked finally.—“Fine, Herr Doktor. It’s healed, I just have to rest a little more.”—“And then?”—“I’ll resume my service, of course.”—“And what do you plan on doing?”—“I’m not sure, actually. It will depend on what they offer me.”—“It’s really up to you to receive the offer you like. If you choose wisely, doors will open, I assure you.”—“What are you thinking of, Herr Doktor?” Slowly, he raised his teacup, blew on it, and drank noisily. I also drank a little. “In Russia, I believe you concerned yourself mostly with the Jewish question, isn’t that right?”—“Yes, Herr Doktor,” I said, slightly annoyed. “But not just that.” Mandelbrod was already going on in his measured, melodious voice: “From the position you were in, you no doubt could not appreciate the full extent either of the problem or of the solution being applied to it. You have probably heard rumors: they are true. Since the end of 1941, this solution has been extended to all the countries in Europe, insofar as possible. The program has been operational since the spring of last year. We have already recorded considerable successes, but it is far from over. There is room there for energetic, devoted men like you.” I felt myself blush: “Thank you for your trust, Herr Doktor. But I should tell you: I found that aspect of my work extremely difficult, beyond my strength. I’d rather concentrate now on something that corresponds better to my talents and knowledge, like constitutional law or even legal relations with the other European countries. The construction of the new Europe is a field that attracts me very much.” During my little speech, Mandelbrod had finished his tea; the blond Amazon had reappeared and crossed the room, poured him another cup, and left again. Mandelbrod drank some more. “I understand your hesitations,” he said finally. “Why take on difficult tasks if there are others to do them? That’s the spirit of the time. During the other war, it was different. The more difficult or dangerous a task was, the more men strove to carry it out. Your father, for example, thought that difficulty in itself was reason enough to do a thing, and to do it to perfection. Your grandfather was a man of the same mold. These days, despite all the Führer’s efforts, the Germans are sinking into laziness, indecision, compromise.” I felt the indirect insult like a slap; but something else in what he had said was more important to me: “Excuse me, Herr Doktor. I thought I understood you to say that you knew my grandfather?” Mandelbrod put down his cup: “Of course. He too worked with us, in our early years. An amazing man.” He stretched his swollen hand out to the desk. “Go look, there.” I obeyed. “You see that morocco portfolio? Bring it to me.” I went over and handed it to him. He put it on his knees, opened it, and took out a photograph, which he held out to me. “Look.” It was an old sepia photo, slightly yellowed: three figures side by side, in front of a background of tropical trees. The woman, in the middle, had a chubby little face, still marked by the plumpness of adolescence; the two men wore light summer suits: the one on the left, with narrow somewhat fluid features and a forehead streaked with a lock of hair, also wore a tie; the shirt of the man on the right was open, beneath an angular face, as if engraved in precious stone; even a pair of tinted glasses didn’t manage to hide the joyful, cruel intensity of his eyes. “Which one is my grandfather?” I asked, fascinated, full of anxiety too. Mandelbrod pointed to the man in the tie. I examined him again: unlike the other man, he had secretive, almost transparent eyes. “And the woman?” I asked again, guessing already.—“Your grandmother. Her name was Eva. A superb, magnificent woman.” I actually hadn’t really known either one: my grandmother had died long before my birth, and the rare visits of my grandfather, when I was very little, hadn’t left me any memories. He had died not long after my father’s disappearance. “And who is the other man?” Mandelbrod looked at me with a seraphic smile. “You can’t guess?” I looked at him: “It’s not possible!” I exclaimed. He didn’t stop smiling: “Why? You don’t think I’ve always looked like this, do you?” Confused, I stammered: “No, no, that’s not what I meant, Herr Doktor! But your age…In the photo, you look the same age as my grandfather.” Another cat, who was walking on the carpet, leaped nimbly onto the back of the armchair and climbed onto his shoulder, rubbing against his enormous head. Mandelbrod sneezed again. “In fact,” he said between two sneezes, “I was older than he. But I’ve aged well.” I was still greedily scrutinizing the photo: how many things it could teach me! Timidly, I asked: “Can I keep it, Herr Doktor?”—“No.” Disappointed, I gave it back; he put it away in the portfolio and sent me to replace it on his desk. I came back and sat down. “Your father was an authentic National Socialist,” Mandelbrod declared, “even before the Party existed. People then were living under the sway of wrong ideas: for them, nationalism meant a blind, narrow-minded patriotism, a parochial patriotism, coupled with an immense domestic injustice; socialism, for their adversaries, signified a false international equality of the classes, and a class struggle within each nation. In Germany, your father was among the first to understand that there had to be an equal role, with mutual respect, for all members of the nation, but only within the nation. In their own way, all great societies in history have been national and socialist. Look at Temujin, the excluded one: it was only when he could impose this idea, and unify the tribes on that basis, that the Mongols were able to conquer the world, in the name of this man from nowhere who became the Oceanic Emperor, Genghis Khan. I had the Reichsführer read a book about him, he was very impressed. With immense, fierce wisdom, the Mongols razed everything in their path, to rebuild it all afterward on healthy foundations. The entire infrastructure of the Russian Empire, all the foundations on which the Germans later built, under czars who were in fact also German—it was the Mongols who brought them: the roads, the money, the postal system, customs, the administration. It was only when the Mongols compromised their purity, by taking foreign women generation after generation, and often from among the Nestorians—the most Jewish of Christians—that their empire broke apart and collapsed. The Chinese present an opposite but equally instructive example: they never leave their Middle Kingdom, but absorb and irremediably sinicize any population that enters it, however powerful it may be; they drown the invader in a limitless ocean of Chinese blood. They are very strong. And we shouldn’t forget that when we’ve finished with the Russians, we’ll still have the Chinese to contend with. The Japanese will never resist them, even if they look as if they’re on top today. If not right away, we’ll have to confront them someday in any case, in a hundred, two hundred years. So we might as well keep them weak, prevent them if possible from understanding National Socialism and applying it to their own situation. Do you know, by the way, that the very term National Socialism was coined by a Jew, a precursor of Zionism, Moses Hess? Read his book someday, Rome and Jerusalem, you’ll see. It’s very instructive. And that’s not by chance: what’s more völkisch than Zionism? Like us, they realized that there can be no Volk or Blut without Boden, without land, and so the Jews must be brought back to the land, Eretz Israël, purified of any other race. Of course, those are ancient Jewish ideas. The Jews were the first genuine National Socialists, for almost three thousand five hundred years they’ve been so, ever since Moses gave them a Law to separate them forever from the other peoples. All our great ideas come from the Jews, and we must have the lucidity to recognize it: the Land as promise and as accomplishment, the notion of the Chosen People, the concept of the purity of blood. That’s why the Greeks, degenerate, democrats, travelers, cosmopolitans, hated them so much, and that’s why they tried first to destroy them, then, through Paul, to corrupt their religion from within, by detaching it from the soil and from the blood, by making it catholic, that is, universal, by suppressing all the laws that served as a barrier to maintaining the purity of Jewish blood: food prohibitions, circumcision. And that’s also why the Jews, of all our enemies, are the worst, the most dangerous; the only ones who truly deserve being hated. They are our only real competitors, in fact. Our only serious rivals. The Russians are weak, a horde deprived of a center despite the attempts of that arrogant Georgian to impose a ‘National Communism’ on them. And the islanders, British or American, are rotten, corrupt, polluted. But the Jews! Who was it who, in the scientific era, discovered the truth of race by drawing on the age-old intuition of his people, humiliated but unconquered? Disraeli, a Jew. Gobineau learned everything from him. You don’t believe me? Go look.” He pointed to the shelves next to his desk: “There, go look.” I got up again and went over to the shelves: several books by Disraeli stood next to books by Gobineau, Vacher de Lapouge, Drumont, Chamberlain, Herzl, and others. “Which one, Herr Doktor? There are many.”—“It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter. They all say the same thing. Take Coningsby. You read English, don’t you? Page two hundred and three. Begin with But Sidonia and his brethren…Read it out loud.” I found the passage and read: “But Sidonia and his brethren could claim a distinction which the Saxon and the Greek, and the rest of the Caucasian nations, have forfeited. The Hebrew is an unmixed race…. An unmixed race of a first-rate organisation are the aristocracy of Nature.”—“Very good! Page two-thirty-one, now. The fact is, you cannot destroy… He’s talking about the Jews, of course.”—“Yes. The fact is, you cannot destroy a pure race of the Caucasian organisation. It is a physiological fact; a simple law of nature, which has baffled Egyptian and Assyrian Kings, Roman Emperors, and Christian Inquisitors. No penal laws, no physical tortures, can effect that a superior race should be absorbed in an inferior, or be destroyed by it. The mixed persecuting races disappear; the pure persecuted race remains.”—“There you have it! Just think that this man, this Jew, was Queen Victoria’s Prime Minister! That he founded the British Empire! A man who, when still unknown, advanced such arguments in front of a Christian Parliament! Come back here. Serve me some more tea, please.” I went back to him and poured him another cup. “Out of love and respect for your father, Max, I have helped you, I have followed your career, I’ve supported you when I could. You owe it to yourself to make him proud, both for his race and for your own. There’s room on this earth for only one chosen people, called on to dominate the others: either it will be them, as the Jew Disraeli and the Jew Herzl wanted, or it will be us. And so we must kill them down to the last one, extirpate their stock. Because even if only ten remain, an intact quorum, or if only two remain, a man and a woman, in a hundred years we’ll have the same problem, and we’ll have to do everything over again.”—“May I ask you a question, Herr Doktor?”—“Ask away, my boy.”—“What is your role in all this, precisely?”—“Leland’s and mine, you mean? It’s a little hard to explain. We don’t have a bureaucratic position. We…we stand by the Führer’s side. You see, the Führer had the courage and the lucidity to make this historic, fatal decision; but, of course, the practical side of things doesn’t concern him. Between that decision and its realization, which has been entrusted to the Reichsführer-SS, there is, however, an immense space. Our task consists of reducing this space. In this sense, we don’t even answer to the Führer, but rather to that space.”—“I’m not sure I entirely understand. But what do you expect from me?”—“Nothing, except that you follow the path that you yourself have traced, to the end.”—“I’m not really sure what my path is, Herr Doktor. I have to think about it.”—“Oh, think! Think. And then call me. We’ll discuss it again.” Another cat was trying to climb up onto my lap, leaving white hairs on the black fabric before I could chase it away. Mandelbrod, without even batting an eyelid, still just as impassive, almost sleeping, emitted another huge fart. The odor made my throat seize up and I breathed in tiny breaths through my mouth. The main door opened and the young woman who manned the reception desk came in, seemingly oblivious to the smell. I got up: “Thank you, Herr Doktor. Please pass on my respects to Herr Leland. Soon, then.” But Mandelbrod seemed already almost asleep; only one of his enormous hands, which was slowly caressing a cat, showed the contrary. I waited for an instant, but he didn’t seem to want to say anything else, so I went out, followed by the girl, who closed the doors without a sound."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 07:00"|"seven o’clock"|"Since then, many things had changed. The Führer still had all the confidence of the Volk, but the certainty of final victory was beginning to ebb away among the masses. The people blamed the High Command, the Prussian aristocrats, Göring and his Luftwaffe; but I knew too that within the Wehrmacht some were blaming the interference of the Führer. Within the SS, it was being whispered that he had had a nervous breakdown after Stalingrad, that he wasn’t talking to anyone anymore; that at the beginning of the month, when Rommel had tried to convince him to evacuate North Africa, he had listened to him without comprehension. As for the public rumors, in the trains, the tramways, the lines, they were becoming downright ludicrous: according to the SD reports that Thomas received, people were saying that the Wehrmacht had put the Führer under house arrest in Berchtesgaden, that he had lost his reason and was kept under guard, drugged, in an SS hospital, that the Führer we saw was just a double. The speech was going to be given in the Zeughaus, the former arsenal at the end of Unter den Linden, right next to the Spree Canal. As a Stalingrad veteran, wounded and decorated, I didn’t have any trouble getting an invitation; I suggested to Thomas that he come with me, but he replied, laughing: “I’m not on leave, I have work to do.” So I went alone. They had taken considerable security precautions; the invitation said that service weapons would be forbidden. The possibility of a British raid frightened some: in January, the English had reveled at launching a Mosquito attack on the anniversary of the Seizure of Power, producing many victims; yet now the chairs had been set up in the Zeughaus courtyard, under the large glass cupola. I found myself seated in the center, between an Oberstleutnant covered with decorations and a civilian wearing the Gold Badge of the Party on his lapel. After the introductory speeches, the Führer made his appearance. I opened my eyes wide: on his head and shoulders, over his simple feldgrau uniform, I seemed to see a large blue-and-white striped rabbi’s shawl. The Führer had started speaking right away in his rapid, monotone voice. I examined the glass roof: Could it be a play of the light? I could clearly see his cap; but underneath it, I thought I made out long side curls, unrolling along his temples down over his lapel, and on his forehead, the tefillin, the little leather box containing verses of the Torah. When he raised his arm, I thought I could make out other leather straps bound around his wrist; and under his jacket, weren’t those the white fringes of what the Jews call the little tallith showing through? I didn’t know what to think. I scrutinized my neighbors: they were listening to the speech with solemn attention, the civil servant was studiously nodding his head. Didn’t they notice anything? Was I the only one to see this unprecedented spectacle? I looked at the dignitaries’ stand: behind the Führer, I recognized Göring, Goebbels, Ley, the Reichsführer, Kaltenbrunner, other well-known leaders, high-ranking Wehrmacht officers; they were all contemplating the Führer’s back or the audience, impassive. Maybe, I said to myself, panic-stricken, it’s the story of the Emperor’s New Clothes: everyone sees how it really is, but hides it, counting on his neighbor to do the same. No, I reasoned, I must be hallucinating, with a wound like mine, that’s entirely possible. Yet I felt perfectly sound of mind. I was far from the platform, though, and the Führer was lit from the side; maybe it was simply an optical illusion? But I still saw it. Maybe my “pineal eye” was playing a trick on me? But there was nothing dreamlike about it. It was also possible that I had gone mad. The speech was short, and I found myself standing in the midst of the crowd trying to head for the exit, unable to make any headway in my thoughts. The Führer would now go to the galleries in the Zeughaus to visit an exhibition of war trophies captured from the Bolsheviks, before going on to inspect an honor guard, and place a wreath at the Neue Wache; I could have followed him, since this was included in my invitation, but I was too rattled and disoriented; I extricated myself from the crowd as quickly as possible and headed back up the avenue toward the S-Bahn station. I crossed the avenue and went to sit in a café, under the arcades of the Kaiser Gallerie, where I ordered a schnapps, drained it in one swallow, then ordered another. I had to think, but the meaning of my thinking escaped me, I was having trouble breathing, I undid my collar and drank some more. There was one way to discover the truth of the matter: in the evening, at the movies, the newsreels would show excerpts from his speech; that would set me straight. I ordered a paper with a list of showings: at seven o’clock, not far away, they were showing Uncle Krüger. I ordered a sandwich and then went for a walk in the Tiergarten. It was still cold, and not many people were strolling under the bare trees. Different interpretations were whirling around in my head, I was impatient for the film to start, even if the prospect of seeing nothing there wasn’t any more reassuring than the opposite. At six o’clock, I headed for the movie theater and took my place in the line to buy my ticket. In front of me, a group of people were discussing the speech, which they must have heard on the radio; I listened to them eagerly. “He blamed the Jews for everything again,” said a skinny man wearing a hat. “What I don’t understand is that there aren’t any more Jews in Germany, so how can it be their fault?”—“But no, Dummkopf,” replied a rather vulgar woman with bleached hair stacked in an elaborate permanent, “it’s the international Jews.”—“Yes,” the man retorted, “but if these international Jews are so powerful, why couldn’t they save their Jewish brothers here?”—“They’re punishing us by bombing us,” another grayish, stringy woman said. “Did you see what they did in Münster, the other day? It’s just to make us suffer. As if we weren’t suffering enough already with all our men at the front.”—“What I found scandalous,” said a ruddy, paunchy man dressed in a gray pinstripe suit, “is that he didn’t even mention Stalingrad. It’s shameful.”—“Oh, don’t talk to me about Stalingrad,” said the fake blonde. “My poor sister had her son Hans over there, in the Seventy-sixth Division. She’s almost mad with grief, she doesn’t even know if he’s alive or dead.”—“On the radio,” said the grayish woman, “they said they were all dead. They fought to the last bullet, they said.”—“And you believe everything they say on the radio, you poor thing?” the man with the hat said. “My cousin, who is an Oberst, says there were a lot of prisoners. Thousands. Maybe even a hundred thousand.”—“So Hansi might be a prisoner?” asked the blonde.—“It’s possible.”—“Why don’t they write, then?” asked the fat bourgeois. “Our prisoners in England or America write; it even comes through the Red Cross.”—“That’s true,” said the mouse-faced woman.—“And how could they write when they’re all officially dead? They write, but our people don’t pass on the letters.”—“Excuse me,” another person interrupted, “but that is true. My sister-in-law, my wife’s sister, she got a letter from the front, it was just signed: A German patriot, which said that her husband, who is a Leutnant in the Panzers, is still alive. The Russians dropped leaflets on our lines, near Smolensk, with lists of names and addresses, printed in tiny letters, and messages to the families. Soldiers collect them and they write anonymous letters, or send the leaflet as is.” A man with a military haircut joined the conversation: “Anyway, even if there are prisoners, they won’t survive for long. The Bolsheviks will send them to Siberia and make them dig canals until they die. Not one of them will come back. And after what we did to them, that will be only fair.”—“What do you mean, after what we did to them?” the fat man asked sharply. The fake blonde had noticed me and was staring at my uniform. The man with the hat spoke before the soldier did: “The Führer said we have lost five hundred and forty-two thousand men since the beginning of the war. Do you believe that? I think he’s just lying.” The blonde elbowed him and glanced in my direction. The man followed her gaze, reddened and stammered: “Or, well, maybe they don’t give him all the figures…” The others were also looking at me and fell silent. I tried to look neutral and absent. Then the fat man tried to restart the conversation on another subject, but the line had begun to move toward the ticket counter. I bought a ticket and found my seat. Soon the lights went out and they played the news, which opened with the Führer’s speech. The film was grainy, it jumped and went blurry at times, they must have rushed to develop it and print the copies. I still seemed to see the large striped shawl over the Führer’s head and shoulders; I couldn’t make out anything else, aside from his moustache; impossible to be sure of anything. My thoughts fled in all directions, like a school of fish in front of a diver; I scarcely noticed the main film, a flimsy Anglophobic thing, I was still thinking about what I had seen, it didn’t make any sense. That it was real seemed impossible to me, but I couldn’t believe that I was hallucinating. What had that bullet done to my head? Had it irremediably blurred the world for me, or had it truly opened a third eye, the one that sees through the opacity of things? Outside, when I exited, it was night, time for dinner, but I didn’t want to eat. I went back to my hotel and locked myself up in my room. For three days I didn’t go out again."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

Maybe even a hundred thousand.”—“So Hansi might be a prisoner?” asked the blonde.—“It’s possible.”—“Why don’t they write, then?” asked the fat bourgeois. “Our prisoners in England or America write; it even comes through the Red Cross.”—“That’s true,” said the mouse-faced woman.—“And how could they write when they’re all officially dead? They write, but our people don’t pass on the letters.”—“Excuse me,” another person interrupted, “but that is true. My sister-in-law, my wife’s sister, she got a letter from the front, it was just signed: A German patriot, which said that her husband, who is a Leutnant in the Panzers, is still alive. The Russians dropped leaflets on our lines, near Smolensk, with lists of names and addresses, printed in tiny letters, and messages to the families. Soldiers collect them and they write anonymous letters, or send the leaflet as is.” A man with a military haircut joined the conversation: “Anyway, even if there are prisoners, they won’t survive for long. The Bolsheviks will send them to Siberia and make them dig canals until they die. Not one of them will come back. And after what we did to them, that will be only fair.”—“What do you mean, after what we did to them?” the fat man asked sharply. The fake blonde had noticed me and was staring at my uniform. The man with the hat spoke before the soldier did: “The Führer said we have lost five hundred and forty-two thousand men since the beginning of the war. Do you believe that? I think he’s just lying.” The blonde elbowed him and glanced in my direction. The man followed her gaze, reddened and stammered: “Or, well, maybe they don’t give him all the figures…” The others were also looking at me and fell silent. I tried to look neutral and absent. Then the fat man tried to restart the conversation on another subject, but the line had begun to move toward the ticket counter. I bought a ticket and found my seat. Soon the lights went out and they played the news, which opened with the Führer’s speech. The film was grainy, it jumped and went blurry at times, they must have rushed to develop it and print the copies. I still seemed to see the large striped shawl over the Führer’s head and shoulders; I couldn’t make out anything else, aside from his moustache; impossible to be sure of anything. My thoughts fled in all directions, like a school of fish in front of a diver; I scarcely noticed the main film, a flimsy Anglophobic thing, I was still thinking about what I had seen, it didn’t make any sense. That it was real seemed impossible to me, but I couldn’t believe that I was hallucinating. What had that bullet done to my head? Had it irremediably blurred the world for me, or had it truly opened a third eye, the one that sees through the opacity of things? Outside, when I exited, it was night, time for dinner, but I didn’t want to eat. I went back to my hotel and locked myself up in my room. For three days I didn’t go out again."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten o’clock"|"In the morning, around ten o’clock, a bellboy knocked on my door: “Herr Sturmbannführer, a phone call for you.” I went down to reception and took the receiver; Una’s joyful voice resounded at the other end: “Max! Can you come have lunch with us? Say yes. Berndt wants to meet you.”—“All right. Where?”—“At Borchardt’s. You know it? On Französischestrasse. At one o’clock. If you get there before us, give our name, I’ve reserved a table.” I went back up to shave and shower. Since I didn’t have my cap anymore I dressed in civilian clothes, with my Iron Cross on my jacket pocket. I arrived early and asked for Freiherr von Üxküll: they led me to a table set a little back and I ordered a glass of wine. Pensive, still saddened by the images from the night before, I thought about my sister’s strange marriage, her strange husband. It had taken place in 1938, when I was finishing my studies. After the night in Zurich, my sister wrote to me only rarely; that year, in the spring, I had received a long letter from her. She told me that in the fall of 1935, she had become very ill. She had gone into analysis, but her depression had only gotten worse, and they had sent her to a sanatorium near Davos to rest and regain her strength. She had stayed there for several months and, in the beginning of 1936, had met a man there, a composer. They had seen each other regularly since then and were going to get married. I hope you will be happy for me, she wrote."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"~ 23:00"|"around eleven at night"|"The next day, I went to the editorial office of Je Suis Partout. Almost all my Parisian friends worked there or gravitated around it. This went back quite a long way. When I had gone to Paris to take my preparatory classes, at seventeen, I didn’t know anyone. I was attending Janson-de-Sailly as a boarder; Moreau had allocated a small monthly allowance for me, as long as I got good grades, and I was relatively free; after the carceral nightmare of the three preceding years, it would have taken a lot less to turn my head. But I behaved, I didn’t do anything stupid. After classes, I would dash over to the Seine to hunt through the booksellers’ stalls, or else join my friends in a little bar in the Latin Quarter, to drink cheap red wine and set the world to rights. But I found my classmates a little dull. Almost all of them were from the upper middle class and were getting ready to follow blindly in their fathers’ footsteps. They had money, and they had been taught very early on how the world was made and what their place in it would be: the dominant one. Toward workers, they felt only scorn, or fear; the ideas that I had brought back from my first trip to Germany—that workers were just as much a part of the nation as the middle class, that the social order had to be arranged organically for the advantage of all, not just a few of the well-off, that workers should not be oppressed but rather offered a life of dignity and a place in this order so as to counter the seductions of Bolshevism—all that was foreign to them. Their political opinions were as narrow as their feeling of bourgeois propriety, and it seemed to me even more pointless to try to discuss with them fascism or German National Socialism (which had just, in September of that year, won a crushing electoral victory, thus becoming the second largest party in the country and sending shockwaves across the victors’ Europe) than to talk about the youth movement ideals preached by Hans Blüher. Freud, for them (if they had even heard of him), was a sexual maniac, Spengler a mad, monomaniacal Prussian, Jünger a warmonger flirting dangerously with Bolshevism; even Péguy they found suspect. Only a few students on scholarship from the provinces seemed a little different, and it was mostly toward them that I gravitated. One of these boys, Antoine F., had an older brother at the École normale supérieure, which I had dreamed of attending, and it was he who took me there for the first time, to drink rum toddies with his brother and his dorm mates and discuss Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, whom I was just discovering. This Bertrand F. was a carré, or “squared”—a second-year student; the best study rooms, with sofas, engravings on the walls, and stoves, were mostly occupied by cubes, or the “cubed,” third-year students. One day, passing by one of these rooms, I noticed a Greek inscription painted on the lintel: IN THIS CARREL WORK SIX FINE AND GOOD MEN (hex kaloi kagathoi)—AND A CERTAIN OTHER ONE (kai tis allos). The door was open, so I pushed it and asked in Greek: “So who is this other one?” A young man with a round face raised his thick glasses from his book and answered in the same language: “A Hebrew, who doesn’t know Greek. And you, who are you?”—“Another too, but made of finer stuff than your Hebrew: a German.”—“A German who knows Greek?”—“What better language to speak with a Frenchman?” He burst out laughing and introduced himself: he was Robert Brasillach. I explained to him that I was in fact half French, and had lived in France since 1924; he asked me if I had gone back to Germany since, and I told him about my summer trip; soon we were chatting about National Socialism. He listened attentively to my descriptions and explanations. “Come back whenever you like,” he said at the end. “I have some friends who will be happy to meet you.” Through him, I discovered another world, which had nothing to do with that of the civil servants in training. These young people cultivated visions of the future of their country and of Europe that they argued about bitterly, while also drawing on a rich study of the past. Their ideas and interests burst out in all directions. Brasillach, together with his future brother-in-law Maurice Bardèche, was a passionate student of the cinema and had me discover not only Chaplin and René Clair but also Eisenstein, Lang, Pabst, Dreyer. He brought me to the offices of L’Action française, in their printing house on the Rue Montmartre, a fine narrow building with a Renaissance staircase, full of the din of the rotary presses. I saw Maurras a few times; he would arrive late, around eleven at night, half deaf, bitter, but always ready to open his heart and vent his spleen against the Marxists, the bourgeois, the republicans, the Jews. Brasillach, at that time, was still completely under his spell, but Maurras’s stubborn hatred for Germany formed an obstacle that I couldn’t overlook, and Robert and I often quarreled about it. If Hitler reached power, I asserted, and united the German worker with the middle class, once and for all countering the Red Peril, and if France did the same, and if the two together managed to eliminate the pernicious influence of the Jews, then the heart of Europe, both nationalist and socialist, would form, along with Italy, an invincible bloc of common interests. But the French were still bogged down, floundering in their petty shopkeepers’ interests and their backward-looking spirit of revenge. Of course, Hitler would sweep aside the unjust Versailles clauses, that was a pure historical necessity; but if the healthy forces of France could on their side liquidate the corrupt republic and its Jewish puppets, then a Franco-German alliance would not only be a possibility, but would become an inevitable reality, a new European entente that would clip the wings of the British plutocrats and imperialists, and would soon be ready to confront the Bolsheviks and bring Russia back into the bosom of civilized nations. (As you can see, my German trip had served my intellectual education well; Moreau would have been horrified if he had known the use I put his money to.) Brasillach, in general, agreed with me: “Yes,” he said, “the postwar is already over. We have to act quickly if we want to avoid another war. That would be a disaster, the end of European civilization, the triumph of the barbarians.” Most of Maurras’s young disciples thought likewise. One of the most brilliant and caustic of them was Lucien Rebatet, who wrote the literary and film criticism in L’Action française under the name of François Vinneuil. He was ten years older than I, but we quickly formed a friendship, drawn to each other by his attraction to Germany. There were also Maxence, Blond, Jacques Talagrand who became Thierry Maulnier, Jules Supervielle, and many others. We met at the Brasserie Lipp, when someone had money in his pocket, or else at a restaurant for students in the Latin Quarter. We feverishly discussed literature and tried to define a “fascist” literature: Rebatet put forward the names of Plutarch, Corneille, Stendhal. “Fascism,” Brasillach said one day, “is the very poetry of the twentieth century,” and we could only agree with him: fascist, fascio, fascination (but later on, having become wiser or more prudent, he would confer the same title on communism)."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
00:00|midnight|"The trip unfurled like a film, I didn’t think; the methods of transportation followed one another, I held out my tickets when I was asked, the authorities didn’t make any problems for me. When I left the house, on the path to town, the sun now fully risen over the gently booming sea, I met an Italian patrol that glanced curiously at my uniform, but didn’t say anything; just before getting into the bus, a French policeman accompanied by two bersaglieri accosted me to ask for my papers: when I showed him the letter from the Einsatzkommando in Marseille and translated it for him, he saluted and let me go. It was better that way, I would have been incapable of talking, I was petrified with anguish, my thoughts were frozen in place. In the bus, I realized I had forgotten my suit and all my clothes from the day before. At the train station in Marseille I had to wait for an hour, so I ordered a coffee and drank it at the bar, in the hubbub of the main concourse. I had to try to reason things out a little. There must have been cries, noise; how could I not have been awakened? I had only drunk a glass of wine. And also the man hadn’t killed the twins, they must have yelled. Why hadn’t they come looking for me? What were they doing there, silent, when I had woken up? The murderer must not have searched the house, in any case he hadn’t come into my room. And who was he? A bandit, a thief? But nothing seemed to have been touched, moved, overturned. Maybe the twins had surprised him and he had run away. But that didn’t make any sense, they hadn’t cried out, they hadn’t come looking for me. Was the killer alone? My train was leaving, I got in and sat down, still reasoning. If he wasn’t a thief, or thieves, then what? A settling of accounts? One of Moreau’s business deals gone sour? Terrorists from the Maquis, come to set an example? But the terrorists didn’t massacre people with axes like savages, they took them into a forest for a show trial, then shot them. And, again, I hadn’t woken up, I who sleep so lightly, I didn’t understand, anguish was racking my body, I sucked my half-healed fingers, my thoughts flew round and round, set off on insane tangents, caught in the jerking rhythm of the train, I wasn’t sure of anything, nothing made sense. In Paris, I easily caught the midnight express to Berlin; when I arrived, I took a room in the same hotel. Everything was calm, silent, a few cars went by; the elephants, which I still hadn’t gone to see, were trumpeting in the early morning light. I had slept a few hours in the train, a black, dreamless sleep; I was still exhausted, but it was impossible to go back to sleep. My sister, I said to myself finally, I have to let Una know. I went to the Kaiserhof: Had Freiherr von Üxküll left an address? “We cannot give out the addresses of our clients, Herr Sturmbannführer” was the reply. But could they at least send a telegram? It was a family emergency. Yes, that was possible. I asked for a form and wrote it on the reception counter: MOTHER DEAD MURDERED STOP MOREAU TOO STOP AM IN BERLIN CALL ME STOP, followed by the number of the Eden Hotel. I handed it to the receptionist with a tenreichsmark bill; he read it gravely and said, bowing his head slightly: “My condolences, Herr Sturmbannführer.”—“You’ll send it right away?”—“I’m calling the post office this instant, Herr Sturmbannführer.” He gave me the change and I went back to the Eden, leaving instructions for someone to come get me immediately in case of a phone call, whatever the time. I had to wait till nightfall. I took the call in a booth next to the reception, fortunately isolated. Una’s voice was panicked: “What happened?” I could hear that she had been crying. I began as calmly as possible: “I was in Antibes, I went to visit them. Yesterday morning…” My voice faltered. I cleared my throat and went on: “Yesterday morning I woke up…” My voice broke and I couldn’t go on. I heard my sister calling: “What is it? What happened?”—“Wait,” I said harshly and lowered the receiver to my thigh while I tried to get control of myself. This had never happened to me, losing control of my voice like this; even at the worst moments, I had always been able to explain things in an orderly, precise way. I coughed, coughed again, then brought the receiver back to face level and explained to her in a few words what had happened. She had only one question, frantic, panic-stricken: “And the twins? Where are the twins?” And then I went mad, started thrashing about in the phonebooth, hitting the walls with my back, my fist, my foot, shouting into the receiver: “Who are those twins?! Those fucking brats, whose are they?” A bellboy, alerted by the racket, had stopped in front of the booth and was looking at me through the glass. I calmed down with an effort. My sister, at the other end, remained silent. I took a breath and said into the receiver: “They’re alive. I don’t know where they went.” She didn’t say anything, I thought I could hear her breathing through the crackle of the international line. “Are you there?” No answer. “Whose are they?” I asked again, gently. She still didn’t speak. “Fuck!” I shouted, and hung up abruptly. I burst out of the booth and stood in front of the reception desk. I took out my address book, found a number, scribbled it on a piece of paper and handed it to the concierge. After a few minutes the telephone rang in the booth. I picked up the receiver and heard a woman’s voice. “Good evening,” I said. “I would like to speak with Dr. Mandelbrod. It’s Sturmbannführer Aue.”—“I’m sorry, Herr Sturmbannführer. Dr. Mandelbrod is not available. Can I take a message?”—“I would like to see him.” I left the hotel’s number and went back up to my room. An hour later a bellboy came with a note for me: Dr. Mandelbrod would receive me the next day, at 10:00 a.m. The same women, or ones who looked just like them, led me in. In the large light-filled office, with cats everywhere, Mandelbrod was waiting in front of the low table; Herr Leland, upright and thin in a pinstriped suit, was sitting next to him. I shook their hands and sat down. This time they didn’t serve me tea. Mandelbrod spoke first: “I’m delighted to see you. Have you had a good leave?” He seemed to be smiling into his folds of fat. “Have you had time to think about my proposal?”—“Yes, Herr Doktor. But I would like something else. I would like to be transferred to the Waffen-SS to go to the front.” Mandelbrod made a slight movement, as if he were shrugging his shoulders. Leland was staring at me with a harsh, cold, lucid gaze. I knew he had a glass eye, but could never tell which. It was he who answered, in a gravelly voice with a minute trace of an accent: “That is impossible. We have seen your medical file: your wound is regarded as a serious disability, and you have been classified for office work.” I looked at him and stammered: “But they need men. They’re recruiting everywhere.”—“Yes,” Mandelbrod said, “but they’re not taking just anyone. Rules are rules.”—“They’ll never take you back for active service,” Leland hammered out.—“Yes,” Mandelbrod went on, “and for France there’s not much hope, either. No, you should put your trust in us.” I got up: “Meine Herren, thank you for having me. I’m sorry I disturbed you.”—“But there’s no problem, my boy,” Mandelbrod whispered. “Take your time, think some more.”—“But remember,” Leland added severely: “a soldier at the front cannot choose his place. He must do his duty, whatever his post.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"ap 01:02"|"one two"|"I returned to Berlin and made an appointment with my old acquaintance Adolf Eichmann. He came to welcome me in person in the vast main lobby of his department on the Kurfürstenstrasse, walking in short strides in his heavy rider’s boots on the polished marble slabs and warmly congratulating me on my promotion. “You too,” I congratulated him in turn, “you were promoted. In Kiev, you were still a Sturmbannführer.”—“Yes,” he said with satisfaction, “that’s true, but you, in the meantime, got two stripes…Come in, come in.” Despite his superior rank, I found him curiously attentive, affable; perhaps the fact that I had come on behalf of the Reichsführer impressed him. In his office, he dropped into his chair and crossed his legs, negligently dropped his cap on a pile of files, took off his large glasses, and began to clean them with a handkerchief while calling out to his secretary: “Frau Werlmann! Some coffee, please.” I observed this little game with amusement: Eichmann had gained self-confidence, since Kiev. He raised his glasses to the window, inspected them meticulously, rubbed them some more, put them back on. He took a box out from under a folder and offered me a Dutch cigarette. Lighter in hand, he gesticulated at my chest: “You’ve received a lot of decorations, I congratulate you again. That’s the advantage of being at the front. Here, in the rear, we have no opportunity to win decorations. My Amtschef managed to get me the Iron Cross, but that was really just so I’d have something. I volunteered for the Einsatzgruppen, did you know that? But C (that was how Heydrich, wanting to give himself an English touch, had himself called by his coterie) ordered me to stay. You’re indispensable to me, he said. Zu Befehl, I said, but in any case I didn’t have a choice.”—“You have a good position, though. Your Referat is one of the most important in the Staatspolizei.”—“Yes, but as far as advancement goes, I’m completely blocked. A Referat is headed by a Regierungsrat or an Oberregierungsrat or an equivalent SS rank. So in principle, in this position, I can’t go beyond Obersturmbannführer. I complained to my Amtschef: he told me I deserved to be promoted, but that he didn’t want to stir up problems with his other department heads.” He made a pinched face that deformed his lips. His balding head gleamed under the overhead lamp, turned on despite the daylight. A no-longer-young secretary came in with a tray and two steaming cups, which she placed in front of us. “Milk? Sugar?” Eichmann asked. I shook my head and smelled the cup: it was real coffee. While I was blowing on it Eichmann asked me out of the blue: “Were you decorated for the Einsatzaktion?” His complaining was beginning to annoy me; I wanted to get to the point of my visit. “No,” I replied. “I was posted in Stalingrad, afterward.” Eichmann’s face darkened and he took off his glasses in an abrupt gesture. “Ach so,” he said, straightening. “You were in Stalingrad. My brother Helmut was killed there.”—“I’m sorry. All my condolences. Was he your older brother?”—“No, the younger one. He was thirty-three. Our mother still hasn’t gotten over it. He fell as a hero, doing his duty for Germany. I’m sorry,” he added ceremoniously, “that I haven’t had that chance myself.” I seized the opening: “Yes, but Germany is asking you for other sacrifices.” He put his glasses back on and drank a little coffee. Then he put out his cigarette in an ashtray: “You’re right. A soldier doesn’t choose his post. What can I do for you, then? If I understood the letter from Obersturmbannführer Brandt correctly, you’re in charge of studying the Arbeitseinsatz, is that right? I don’t quite see what that has to do with my departments.” I pulled a few sheets of paper from my imitation-leather briefcase. (I felt a disagreeable sensation every time I used this briefcase, but I hadn’t been able to find anything else, because of the restrictions. I had asked Thomas’s advice, but he had laughed in my face: “I wanted a leather office set, you know, with a writing pad and a penholder. I wrote to a friend in Kiev, a guy who was in the Group and who stayed on with the BdS, to ask him if he could have one made for me. He answered that ever since we had killed all the Jews, you couldn’t even get a pair of boots resoled in the Ukraine.”) Eichmann was observing me, knitting his brows. “The Jews you are in charge of are today one of the main pools the Arbeitseinsatz can draw on to renew its workforce,” I explained. “Aside from them, there’s really nothing else but foreign workers sentenced for petty crimes, and political deportees from the countries under our control. All the other possible sources, the war prisoners or the criminals transferred by the Ministry of Justice, are mostly exhausted. What I would like is to have an overall view of how your operations function, and especially of your prospects for the future.” While he was listening to me, a curious tic deformed the left corner of his mouth; I had the impression that he was chewing his tongue. He leaned back again in his chair, his long veined hands joined in a triangle, index fingers taut: “Fine, fine. I’ll explain things to you. As you know, in every country subject to the Endlösung, there is a representative from my Referat, subordinate either to the BdS, if it’s an occupied country, or to the embassy’s police attaché, if it’s an allied country. I should point out right away that the USSR doesn’t come into my domain; as for my representative in the Generalgouvernement, he has an entirely minor role.”—“How is that?”—“The Jewish question, in the GG, is the responsibility of the SSPF in Lublin, Gruppenführer Globocnik, who reports directly to the Reichsführer. So the Staatspolizei isn’t concerned, in general.” He pinched his lips: “Except for a few exceptions that still have to be settled, the Reich itself can be considered judenrein. As to the other countries, everything depends on the degree of understanding about the resolution of the Jewish question shown by the national authorities. Because of that, in a way every country poses a special case that I can explain to you.” As soon as he began to talk about his work, I noticed, his already curious mixture of Austrian accent and Berlin slang was complicated by a particularly muddled bureaucratic syntax. He spoke calmly and clearly, choosing his words, but it was sometimes hard for me to follow his phrases. He himself seemed to get a little lost in them. “Take the example of France, where we have so to speak only begun to work last summer once the French authorities, guided by our specialist and also by the advice and wishes of the Auswärtiges Amt, um, if you like, had agreed to cooperate and especially when the Reichsbahn agreed to provide us with the necessary transportation. We were thus able to begin, and in the beginning it even had some success, since the French showed a lot of understanding, and also thanks to the assistance of the French police, without which we could have done nothing, of course, since we don’t have the resources, and the Militärbefehlshaber certainly wasn’t going to provide them, so the aid of the French police was a vital element, since they’re the ones who arrested the Jews and transferred them to us, and they even overdid it, since we had only officially asked for Jews over sixteen—to begin with of course—but they didn’t want to keep the children without their parents, which is understandable, so they gave them all to us, even the orphans—in short we soon understood that in fact they were only giving us their foreign Jews, I even had to cancel a transport from Bordeaux because they couldn’t find enough to fill it, of those foreign Jews, a real scandal, since when it comes to their own Jews, the ones who were French citizens, I mean, for a long time, well then, you see, it was nothing doing. They didn’t want to and there was nothing to be done. According to the Auswärtiges Amt it was Maréchal Pétain himself who made problems, and it was useless for us to explain to him, it didn’t do any good. So after November, of course, the situation changed completely, because we were no longer necessarily bound by all those agreements or by the French laws, but even then, this is what I told you, there was the problem of the French police, which didn’t want to cooperate anymore, I don’t want to complain about Herr Bousquet, but he too had his orders, and of course it wasn’t possible to send the German police knocking on doors, so, in fact, in France, we’re not making much progress anymore. What’s more, a lot of Jews have gone to the Italian sector, and that’s really a problem, since the Italians have no understanding at all, and we’re having the same problem everywhere, in Greece and in Croatia, where they’re in charge, there they protect the Jews, and not only their own Jews but all of them. And this is a real problem and it’s completely beyond my competence, and also I think I know for a fact that it was discussed at the highest level, the highest there is, and that Mussolini replied that he would take care of it, but obviously it’s not a priority, is it, and at the lower levels, the ones we’re dealing with, there it’s downright bureaucratic obstruction, delaying tactics and that’s something I know a lot about, they never say no but it’s like quicksand, and nothing happens. That’s where we are with the Italians.”—“And the other countries?” I asked. Eichmann got up, put on his cap, and motioned for me to follow: “Come. I’ll show you.” I followed him to another office. He was, I noticed for the first time, bowlegged, like a rider. “Do you ride horses, Obersturmbannführer?” He made another face: “In my youth. Now I don’t get much of a chance.” He knocked at a door and went in. Some officers got up and saluted; he returned their salute, crossed the room, knocked at another door, and entered. In the back of the room, behind a desk, was a Sturmbannführer; there was also a secretary there and a subaltern. They all got up when we came in; the Sturmbannführer, a handsome blond animal, tall and muscular, buttoned up tight in his tailored uniform, raised his arm and shouted a martial “Heil!” We returned his salute before walking over to him. Eichmann introduced me and then turned to me: “Sturmbannführer Günther is my permanent deputy.” Günther contemplated me with a taciturn look and asked Eichmann: “What can I do for you, Obersturmbannführer?”—“I’m sorry to disturb you, Günther. I wanted to show him your board.” Günther moved away from his desk without a word. Behind him on the wall was a large multicolored chart. “You see,” Eichmann explained, “it’s organized by country and brought up to date every month. On the left, you have the objectives, and then the totals accrued to realize the objective. You can see at a glance that we’re approaching the goal in Holland, fifty percent in Belgium, but that in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria we’re still close to zero. In Bulgaria, we’ve had a few thousand, but that’s deceptive: they let us evacuate the territories they occupied in 1941, in Thrace and Macedonia, but we can’t touch the ones in Old Bulgaria. We officially asked them again a few months ago, in March I think, there was an approach from the AA, but they refused again. Since it’s a question of sovereignty, everyone wants guarantees that his neighbor will do the same thing, that’s to say that the Bulgarians want the Romanians to start, and the Romanians the Hungarians, and the Hungarians the Bulgarians or something like that. Note that since Warsaw we’ve at least been able to explain to them the danger it represents, having so many Jews in one’s country, it’s a hotbed of partisans, and well, I think that impressed them. But we haven’t reached the end of our efforts yet. In Greece, we began in March, I have a Sonderkommando over there, in Thessalonica right now, and you see that it’s going quite rapidly, it’s already almost over. After that we’ll still have Crete and Rhodes, no problem, but for the Italian zone, Athens and the rest, I’ve already explained to you. Then, of course, there are all the associated technical problems, they’re not just diplomatic problems, that would be too easy, no, and so especially the problem of transport, that’s to say rolling stock and thus the allocation of freight cars and also, how should I say, of time on the tracks even if we have the cars. For example, sometimes, we’re negotiating an agreement with a government, we have the Jews in hand, bam, Transportsperre, everything’s blocked because there’s an offensive in the East or something and they can’t let anything else go through Poland. So of course when it’s quiet we work twice as hard. In Holland or in France, we centralize everything in transit camps, and we’re emptying them out little by little, when there’s transport and also according to the admission capacity, which is also limited. For Thessalonica, on the other hand, it was decided to do everything all at once, one two three four and that’s it. In fact, since February, we’ve really had a lot of work, transport is available and I received an order to speed things up. The Reichsführer wants it to be over this year and then we won’t talk about it anymore.”—“And can that be realized?”—“Where it depends on us, yes. I mean transport is always a problem, finances too, since we have to pay the Reichsbahn, you know, for each passenger, and I don’t have any budget for that, I have to make do. We ask the Jews to help out, that’s fine, but the Reichsbahn only accepts payment in reichsmarks or at a pinch in zlotys, if we send them within the GG, but in Thessalonica they have drachmas and of course it’s impossible to exchange currency there. So we have to make do, but we know how to do that. After that of course there are the diplomatic questions, if the Hungarians say no, I can’t do anything about it, it doesn’t depend on me and it’s up to Herr Minister von Ribbentrop to see to that with the Reichsführer, not me.”—“I see.” I studied the chart for a bit: “If I understand correctly, the difference between the numbers there in the ‘April’ column and the numbers on the left represents the potential pool, subject to the various complications you’ve explained to me.”—“Exactly. But note that those are overall figures, that is to say that a large part, in any case, doesn’t interest the Arbeitseinsatz, because you see they’re old people or children or I don’t know what, so from that total you can deduct a large number.”—“How big, in your opinion?”—“I don’t know. You should check that with the WVHA—admission and selection is their problem. My responsibility stops when the train leaves—the rest I can’t talk about. What I can tell you is that in the opinion of the RSHA, the number of Jews temporarily kept for work should be as limited as possible: creating large concentrations of Jews, you see, is inviting a repetition of Warsaw, it’s dangerous. I think I can tell you that that’s the opinion of Gruppenführer Müller, my Amtschef, and of Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner.”—“I see. Could you give me a copy of these figures?”—“Of course, of course. I’ll send them to you tomorrow. But for the USSR and the GG, I don’t have those, as I told you.” Günther, who hadn’t said a word, let out another resounding “Heil Hitler!” while we got ready to leave. I returned with Eichmann to his office so that he could explain a few more points to me. When I was ready to go, he accompanied me. In the lobby he made a low bow: “Sturmbannführer, I would like to invite you to my place one night this week. We sometimes give chamber music performances. My Hauptscharführer Boll plays first violin.”—“Oh. That’s very nice. And you, what do you play?”—“Me?” He stretched out his neck and head, like a bird. “Violin too, second violin. I don’t play as well as Boll, unfortunately, so I gave way to him. C…Obergruppenführer Heydrich, I mean, not Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner whom I know well, we’re from the same province and he’s the one who had me enter the SS and he still remembers—no, the Chief played the violin magnificently. Yes, really very fine, he had a huge amount of talent. He was a fine man, whom I respected very much. Very…considerate, a man who suffered in his heart. I miss him.”—“I hardly knew him. And what are you playing?”—“At the moment? Mostly Brahms. A little Beethoven.”—“No Bach?” He pinched his lips again: “Bach? I don’t like him very much. I find him dry, too…calculated. Sterile, so to speak, very beautiful, of course, but soulless. I prefer Romantic music, it sometimes overwhelms me, yes, it takes me far beyond myself.”—“I’m not sure I share your opinion of Bach. But I’ll happily accept your invitation.” The idea in fact bored me profoundly, but I didn’t want to offend him. “Good, good,” he said, shaking my hand. “I’ll check with my wife and I’ll call you. And don’t worry about your documents. You’ll have them tomorrow, you have my word as an SS officer.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 03:04"|"three four"|"I returned to Berlin and made an appointment with my old acquaintance Adolf Eichmann. He came to welcome me in person in the vast main lobby of his department on the Kurfürstenstrasse, walking in short strides in his heavy rider’s boots on the polished marble slabs and warmly congratulating me on my promotion. “You too,” I congratulated him in turn, “you were promoted. In Kiev, you were still a Sturmbannführer.”—“Yes,” he said with satisfaction, “that’s true, but you, in the meantime, got two stripes…Come in, come in.” Despite his superior rank, I found him curiously attentive, affable; perhaps the fact that I had come on behalf of the Reichsführer impressed him. In his office, he dropped into his chair and crossed his legs, negligently dropped his cap on a pile of files, took off his large glasses, and began to clean them with a handkerchief while calling out to his secretary: “Frau Werlmann! Some coffee, please.” I observed this little game with amusement: Eichmann had gained self-confidence, since Kiev. He raised his glasses to the window, inspected them meticulously, rubbed them some more, put them back on. He took a box out from under a folder and offered me a Dutch cigarette. Lighter in hand, he gesticulated at my chest: “You’ve received a lot of decorations, I congratulate you again. That’s the advantage of being at the front. Here, in the rear, we have no opportunity to win decorations. My Amtschef managed to get me the Iron Cross, but that was really just so I’d have something. I volunteered for the Einsatzgruppen, did you know that? But C (that was how Heydrich, wanting to give himself an English touch, had himself called by his coterie) ordered me to stay. You’re indispensable to me, he said. Zu Befehl, I said, but in any case I didn’t have a choice.”—“You have a good position, though. Your Referat is one of the most important in the Staatspolizei.”—“Yes, but as far as advancement goes, I’m completely blocked. A Referat is headed by a Regierungsrat or an Oberregierungsrat or an equivalent SS rank. So in principle, in this position, I can’t go beyond Obersturmbannführer. I complained to my Amtschef: he told me I deserved to be promoted, but that he didn’t want to stir up problems with his other department heads.” He made a pinched face that deformed his lips. His balding head gleamed under the overhead lamp, turned on despite the daylight. A no-longer-young secretary came in with a tray and two steaming cups, which she placed in front of us. “Milk? Sugar?” Eichmann asked. I shook my head and smelled the cup: it was real coffee. While I was blowing on it Eichmann asked me out of the blue: “Were you decorated for the Einsatzaktion?” His complaining was beginning to annoy me; I wanted to get to the point of my visit. “No,” I replied. “I was posted in Stalingrad, afterward.” Eichmann’s face darkened and he took off his glasses in an abrupt gesture. “Ach so,” he said, straightening. “You were in Stalingrad. My brother Helmut was killed there.”—“I’m sorry. All my condolences. Was he your older brother?”—“No, the younger one. He was thirty-three. Our mother still hasn’t gotten over it. He fell as a hero, doing his duty for Germany. I’m sorry,” he added ceremoniously, “that I haven’t had that chance myself.” I seized the opening: “Yes, but Germany is asking you for other sacrifices.” He put his glasses back on and drank a little coffee. Then he put out his cigarette in an ashtray: “You’re right. A soldier doesn’t choose his post. What can I do for you, then? If I understood the letter from Obersturmbannführer Brandt correctly, you’re in charge of studying the Arbeitseinsatz, is that right? I don’t quite see what that has to do with my departments.” I pulled a few sheets of paper from my imitation-leather briefcase. (I felt a disagreeable sensation every time I used this briefcase, but I hadn’t been able to find anything else, because of the restrictions. I had asked Thomas’s advice, but he had laughed in my face: “I wanted a leather office set, you know, with a writing pad and a penholder. I wrote to a friend in Kiev, a guy who was in the Group and who stayed on with the BdS, to ask him if he could have one made for me.

"ap 01:50"|1.50|"In Lublin, as in Cracow, I put up at the Deutsches Haus. The taproom, when we arrived, was already animated; I had called ahead, and my room was reserved; Piontek would sleep in a dormitory for enlisted men. I took my things up and asked for some hot water to wash with. Twenty minutes later there was a knock on my door, and a young Polish servant came in with two steaming buckets. I pointed to the bathroom, and she went in to put them down. Since she didn’t come back out, I went in to see what she was doing: I found her half naked, undressed to the waist. Stunned, I looked at her red cheeks, her little breasts, tiny but charming; fists on her hips, she was staring at me with a bold smile. “What are you doing?” I asked severely.—“Me…wash…you,” she answered in broken German. I picked up her blouse from the stool where she had put it and handed it to her: “Get dressed and leave.” She obeyed with the same naturalness. That was the first time such a thing had happened to me: the Deutsches Häuser I knew were strictly run, but obviously this must have been a common practice here, and I didn’t think for an instant that it was restricted to the bath. After the girl had gone, I got undressed, washed, and, having changed into a dress uniform (for long journeys, because of the dust, I wore a gray field uniform), I went downstairs. A noisy crowd was now filling the bar and the restaurant. I went out into the backyard to smoke and found Piontek standing, cigarette dangling from his mouth, watching two teenagers wash our car. “Where did you find them?” I asked.—“Not me, Sturmbannführer. The Haus. The garage owner complains about it, actually—he says he could have Jews for free, but that the officers made scenes if a Jew touched their car. So he pays Poles like them, one reichsmark a day.” (Even in Poland, that was a ridiculous amount. A night at the Deutsches Haus, although subsidized, with three meals, came to about 12 RM; a coffee in Cracow cost 1.50 RM.) I watched the young Poles wash the car with him. Then I invited him to have dinner with me. We had to clear our way through the throng to find a free spot at a table. The men were drinking, shouting as if for the pleasure of hearing their own voices. There were SS there, Orpos, men from the Wehrmacht and from the Organisation Todt; almost everyone was in uniform, including many women, probably typists or secretaries. Polish waitresses threaded their way with difficulty with trayfuls of beer and food. The meal was plentiful: sliced roast beef, beets, seasoned potatoes. As I ate I observed the crowd. A lot of people were just drinking. The waitresses were having trouble: the men, already drunk, groped the girls’ breasts or buttocks as they went by, and since they had their hands full, they couldn’t defend themselves. Near the long bar was a group in SS-Totenkopf uniforms, probably personnel from the Lublin camp, with two women among them, Aufseherinnen, I imagine. One of them, who was drinking brandy, had a masculine face and laughed a lot; she held a riding crop with which she tapped her tall boots. At one point, one of the waitresses was blocked near them: the Aufseherin held out her whip and slowly, to the laughter of her comrades, lifted the girl’s skirt from behind, up to her buttocks. “You like that, Erich!” she exclaimed. “But her ass is filthy, like all Poles.” The others laughed louder: she let the skirt fall and whipped the backside of the girl, who let out a cry and had to make an effort not to spill her glasses of beer. “Go on, move, sow!” the Aufseherin shouted. “You stink.” The other woman chuckled and rubbed shamelessly against one of the noncoms. In the back of the room, under an arch, some Orpos were playing billiards, shouting loudly; near them, I noticed the young servant who had brought me hot water; she was sitting on the lap of an OT engineer, who had his hand slipped under her blouse and was feeling her up while she laughed and stroked his balding forehead. “Well,” I said to Piontek, “it’s definitely lively here, in Lublin.”—“Yeah. It’s known for that.” After the meal, I had a Cognac and a little Dutch cigar; the Haus had a full shelf at the bar; you could choose from many quality brands. Piontek had gone to bed. They had put music on, and couples were dancing; the second Aufseherin, obviously drunk, was holding her partner by the buttocks; an SS secretary was letting her neck be kissed by a Supply Corps Leutnant. This stifling, cloying, lewd, noise-filled atmosphere got on my nerves and ruined the pleasure I took from traveling, the joyful feeling of freedom I had felt during the day on the long, almost deserted roads. And it was impossible to escape this grating, sordid atmosphere; it followed you even into the john. The large room, though, was remarkably clean, tiled in white up to the ceiling, with thick oak doors, mirrors, fine porcelain sinks, and brass taps for running water; the stalls too were white and clean, they must have scrubbed the seatless Turkish-style toilets regularly. I undid my trousers and squatted down; when I had finished, I looked for paper, but there didn’t seem to be any; then I felt something touch my backside; I jumped and turned around, trembling, already reaching for my service revolver, my underpants ridiculously lowered: a man’s hand was stretched out through a hole in the wall and was waiting, palm up. A little fresh shit was already staining the tips of his fingers, where they had touched me. “Go away!” I screamed. “Go away!” Slowly, the hand withdrew from the hole. I burst into nervous laughter: it was vile, they had really gone mad, in Lublin. Fortunately I still had some squares of newspaper in my tunic, a good precaution when traveling. I quickly wiped myself and fled, without pulling the chain to flush. When I went back into the main room I had the impression that everyone would look at me, but no one was paying any attention, they were drinking and shrieking, with brutal or hysterical, crude laughter, like a medieval court. Shaken, I leaned on the bar and ordered another Cognac; as I drank, I looked at the fat Spiess from the KL, with the Aufseherin, and, repulsive thought, imagined him squatting down, having his ass wiped with delight by a Polish hand. I also wondered if the women’s bathroom benefited from a similar arrangement: looking at them, I thought the answer was yes. I finished my Cognac in one gulp and went up to go to bed; I slept poorly, because of the noise, but still better than poor Piontek: some Orpos had brought Polish girls back to the dormitory, and spent the night fornicating in the beds next to his, without any qualms, trading girls and making fun of him because he didn’t want one. “They pay them in canned food,” he explained to me laconically over breakfast."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
12:00|noon|"For those who didn’t enjoy the binges at the Deutsches Haus, distractions were rare in Lublin. In my spare time, I visited the old town and the castle; at night, I had my meal served to me in my room and I read. I had left Best’s Festgabe and the volume on ritual murder in Berlin, on my bookshelf, but I had brought along the collection by Maurice Blanchot that I had purchased in Paris, which I had started again at the beginning, and after days of difficult discussions, I took great pleasure in plunging into this other world, all made of light and thought. Minor incidents continued to eat away at my tranquility; in this Deutsches Haus, it didn’t seem it could be otherwise. One night, somewhat agitated, too distracted to read, I had gone down to the bar for a schnapps and some talk (I knew most of the regulars now). Going back upstairs, it was dark, and I mistook the room; the door was open and I went in: on the bed, two men were copulating simultaneously with a girl, one lying on his back, the other kneeling, the girl, also kneeling, between them. I took a minute to understand what I was seeing, and when, as in a dream, things finally fell into place, I muttered an apology and tried to go out. But the kneeling man, naked except for a pair of boots, withdrew and stood up. Holding his erect penis in one hand and stroking it gently, he pointed, as if to invite me to take his place, to the girl’s buttocks, where the anus, surrounded by a pink halo, gaped open like a sea anemone between two white globes. Of the other man I saw only his hairy legs, testicles and penis disappearing into the tufted vagina. The girl was moaning feebly. Without a word, smiling, I shook my head, and went out, gently closing the door. After that, I was even less inclined to leave my room. But when Höfle invited me to an outdoor reception Globocnik was giving for the birthday of the commanding officer of the district garrison, I unhesitatingly accepted. The party took place at the Julius Schreck Kaserne, the HQ of the SS: behind the mass of an old building a rather beautiful park spread out, with a very green lawn, tall trees at the rear, and flowerbeds at the sides; in the distance, you could see some houses, then countryside. Wooden tables had been set up on trestles, and the guests were drinking in clusters on the grass; in front of the trees, over some pits that had been dug for the purpose, a whole stag and two pigs were roasting on spits, supervised by a few enlisted men. The Spiess who had escorted me from the gate led me straight to Globocnik, who was standing with his guest of honor, Generalleutnant Moser, and some civilian officials. It was barely noon, Globocnik was drinking Cognac and smoking a fat cigar, his red face sweating over his buttoned collar. I clicked my heels in front of the group and saluted, and then Globocnik shook my hand and introduced me to the others; I congratulated the General on his birthday. “So, Sturmbannführer, your investigations are going forward? What have you found?”—“It’s a little too early yet to draw conclusions, Gruppenführer. And also the problems are rather technical. What is definite is that in terms of exploitation of labor, we could conduct some improvements.”—“We can always improve! In any case, a real National Socialist knows nothing but movement and progress. You should speak to the Generalleutnant here: he was complaining just now that we took some Jews away from the factories of the Wehrmacht. Explain to him that he just needs to replace them with Poles.” The General interrupted: “My dear Gruppenführer, I wasn’t complaining; I understand these measures as well as the next person. I was simply saying that the interests of the Wehrmacht should be taken into consideration. Many Poles have been sent to work in the Reich, and it takes time to train the remaining ones; by acting unilaterally, you are disturbing the war production.” Globocnik let out a burst of crude laughter: “What you mean, my dear Generalleutnant, is that the Polacks are too stupid to learn how to work correctly, and that the Wehrmacht prefers Jews. That’s true, the Jews are cleverer than the Poles. That’s why they’re more dangerous too.” He stopped and turned to me: “But, Sturmbannführer, I don’t want to detain you. The drinks are on the tables, help yourself, have fun!”—“Thank you, Gruppenführer.” I saluted and headed to one of the tables, which was groaning beneath the bottles of wine, beer, schnapps, Cognac. I poured myself a glass of beer and looked around. More guests were flowing in, but I didn’t recognize many people. There were some women, a few employees of the SSPF in uniform, but mostly officers’ wives, in civilian clothes. Florstedt was talking with his camp colleagues; Höfle was smoking alone on a bench, elbows on the table, a bottle of beer open in front of him, with a pensive air, lost in the void. In the spring, I had recently learned, he had lost both his children, twins, carried off by diphtheria; at the Deutsches Haus, they said that at the funeral he had collapsed, raving, seeing divine punishment in his misfortune, and that since then he was no longer the same man (he would in fact commit suicide twenty years later, at the remand center in Vienna, without even waiting for the verdict of the Austrian court, certainly more clement than God’s, though). I decided to leave him alone and joined the little group surrounding the Lublin KdS, Johannes Müller. I knew the KdO Kintrup by sight; Müller introduced me to his other interlocutor: “This is Sturmbannführer Dr. Morgen. Like you, he works directly under the Reichsführer’s orders.”—“Excellent. In what capacity?”—“Dr. Morgen is an SS judge, attached to the Kripo.” Morgen continued the explanation: “For now, I head a special commission appointed by the Reichsführer to investigate the concentration camps. And you?” I explained my mission to him in a few words. “Ah, so you’re also concerned with the camps,” he commented. Kintrup had wandered off. Müller patted my shoulder: “Meine Herren, if you want to talk shop, I’ll leave you. It’s Sunday.” I saluted him and turned to Morgen. He examined me with his keen, intelligent eyes, slightly veiled behind thin-rimmed glasses. “What exactly does your commission consist of?” I asked him.—“It’s essentially an SS and police court ‘for special tasks.’ I have direct authority from the Reichsführer to investigate corruption in the KLs.”—“That’s very interesting. Are there a lot of problems?”—“That’s an understatement. The corruption is massive.” He signed with his head to someone behind me and smiled slightly: “If Sturmbannführer Florstedt sees you with me, your own work won’t be made any easier.”—“You’re investigating Florstedt?”—“Among others.”—“And he knows it?”—“Of course. It’s an official investigation, I’ve already questioned him several times.” He was holding a glass of white wine in his hand; he drank a little, and I drank too, emptying my glass. “What you’re talking about interests me enormously,” I continued. I explained my impressions to him about the gaps between the official dietary norms and what the prisoners actually received. He listened, nodding his head: “Yes, definitely, the food is looted too.”—“By whom?”—“By everyone. From the lowest to the highest. The cooks, the kapos, the SS-Führers, the warehouse managers, and the top of the hierarchy too.”—“If that’s true, it’s a scandal.”—“Absolutely. The Reichsführer is very troubled by it personally. An SS-Mann should be an idealist: he cannot do his work and at the same time fornicate with the prisoners and fill up his pockets. But that happens.”—“And are your investigations succeeding?”—“It’s very difficult. These people stick together, and resistance is enormous.”—“But if you have the Reichsführer’s full support…”—“That’s quite recent. This special court was created scarcely a month ago. My investigations have been going on for two years and I have encountered considerable obstacles. We began—at the time I was a member of the SS and Police Court Twelve, in Kassel—with KL Buchenwald, near Weimar. More precisely with the Kommandant of that camp, a certain Koch. The investigations were blocked: Obergruppenführer Pohl wrote a letter of congratulations then to Koch, where he said among other things that he would step in as a shield whenever an unemployed lawyer should stretch out his hangman’s hands again to grasp the white body of Koch. I know this because Koch circulated this letter widely. But I didn’t let him go. Koch was transferred here, to command the KL, and I followed him. I discovered a network of corruption that covered all the camps. Finally, last summer, Koch was suspended. But he had also had most of the witnesses assassinated, including a Hauptscharführer in Buchenwald, one of his accomplices. Here, he had all the Jewish witnesses killed; we opened an investigation into that too, but then all the Jews in the KL were executed; when we tried to react, they pleaded superior orders to us.”—“But such orders exist, you must know that.”—“I learned it then. And it’s clear that in that case we have no jurisdiction. But, still, there is a distinction: if a member of the SS has a Jew killed in the context of superior orders, that’s one thing; but if he has a Jew killed to cover his embezzlements, or for his own perverted pleasure, as also happens, that’s another thing, that’s a crime. Even if the Jew is to die anyway.”—“I entirely agree with you. But the distinction must be hard to make.”—“Legally, yes: you can have doubts, but to charge someone, you need evidence, and as I’ve told you, these men help each other out, they make witnesses disappear. Sometimes, of course, there’s no ambiguity: for instance, I’m also investigating Koch’s wife, a sexual deviant who had tattooed prisoners killed in order to remove their skin; she used the tanned skins for lampshades or other things like that. Once all the evidence is gathered, she’ll be arrested, and I don’t doubt she’ll be condemned to death.”—“And how did your investigations into Koch end?”—“They’re still under way; when I’ve finished my work here and have all the evidence in hand, I plan on arresting him again. He too deserves the death penalty.”—“So he was let go? I’m not following you very well.”—“He was acquitted in February. But I wasn’t in charge of the case anymore. I had problems with another man, not a camp officer but a Waffen-SS officer, a certain Dirlewanger. A raving lunatic, at the head of a unit of reprieved criminals and poachers. In 1941, I received information that he was conducting so-called scientific experiments, here in the GG, with his friends: he was killing girls with strychnine and watching them die while he smoked cigarettes. But when I wanted to prosecute him, he and his unit were transferred to Byelorussia. I can tell you that he benefits from protection at a very high level of the SS. Finally I was demoted, relieved of my functions, reduced to the rank of SS-Sturmmann, and sent to a field battalion, then to the SS-‘Wiking,’ in Russia. It was during that time that the proceedings against Koch collapsed. But in May the Reichsführer had me recalled, appointed me Sturmbannführer of the Reserve, and assigned me to the Kripo. After another complaint from the authorities in the district of Lublin, about thefts of property belonging to prisoners, he ordered me to form this commission.” I nodded admiringly: “You’re not afraid of trouble.” Morgen laughed dryly: “Not really. Already, before the war, when I was a judge in the Landgericht in Stettin, I was demoted because I disagreed with a ruling. That’s how I ended up in the SS-Gericht.”—“Can I ask you where you studied?”—“Oh, I moved around a lot. I studied in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Kiel, then also in Rome and in The Hague.”—“Kiel! At the Institute for World Economics? I did some of my studies there too. With Professor Jessen.”—“I know him well. I studied international law with Professor Ritterbusch.” We chatted for a while, exchanging memories of Kiel; Morgen, I discovered, spoke very good French, and four other languages besides. I returned to the initial subject: “Why did you begin with Lublin?”—“First of all to corner Koch. I’m almost there. And also the complaint about theft in the district gave me a good pretext. But all kinds of bizarre things go on here. Before I came, I received a report from the KdS on a Jewish wedding in a work camp. There were more than a thousand guests.”—“I don’t understand.”—“A Jew, an important kapo, got married in this Judenlager. There were astronomical quantities of food and alcohol. SS guards took part. Clearly, there must have been criminal infractions there.”—“Where did that take place?”—“I don’t know. When I arrived in Lublin, I asked Müller; he was very vague. He sent me to the camp of the DAW, but there they didn’t know anything. Then they advised me to go see Wirth, a Kriminalkommissar, you know who he is? And Wirth told me it was true, and that it was his method for the extermination of the Jews: he gave privileges to some, who helped him kill the others; then he killed them too. I wanted to learn more, but the Gruppenführer forbade me from going into the camps of the Einsatz, and the Reichsführer confirmed this prohibition.”—“So you have no jurisdiction over the Einsatz?”—“Not on the question of extermination, no. But no one forbade me from looking into what’s happening with the confiscated property. The Einsatz is generating colossal sums, in gold, currency, and goods. All that belongs to the Reich. I’ve already gone to see the warehouses here, on Chopin Street, and I count on investigating further.”—“Everything you say,” I said warmly, “is hugely interesting to me. I hope we can discuss it more in detail. In a certain sense, our missions are complementary.”—“Yes, I see what you mean: the Reichsführer wants to put his house in order. And maybe, since they don’t mistrust you as much, you’ll be able to dig up some things that are kept hidden from me. We’ll see each other again.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
12:00|noon|"I saw Morgen again. He was on the verge of indicting Koch and his wife, as well as several other officers and noncoms in Buchenwald and Lublin; under seal of secrecy, he told me that Florstedt too would be charged. He showed me in detail the tricks used by these corrupt men to hide their embezzlements, and the means he used to catch them in the act. He compared the records of the Abteilungen of the camp: even when the culprits forged something, they didn’t go to the trouble of reconciling their forgeries with the documents and reports from other departments. Thus, in Buchenwald, he had gathered his first serious evidence of the murders committed by Koch when he had noticed that the same inmate was registered at the same time in two different places: at a given date, the prison register of the Politische Abteilung bore, next to the name of the inmate, the comment “Released, noon,” while the register of the Revier indicated: “Patient deceased at 9:15.” The inmate had in fact been killed at the Gestapo prison, but his killers had tried to make it look as if he had died of illness. Similarly, Morgen explained to me how one could compare the different administration or Revier records with those of the blocks to try to find evidence of diversions of food, medicine, or property. He was quite interested in the fact that I planned on going to Auschwitz: several leads he was following up on seemed to lead to that camp. “It’s probably the richest Lager, because that’s where most of the special transports of the RSHA go now. Just like here, with the Einsatz, they have immense warehouses to sort and package all the confiscated goods. I suspect that must give rise to colossal misappropriations and thefts. We were alerted by a package sent from the KL by military post: because of its unusual weight, it was opened; inside, they found three chunks of dental gold, big as fists, sent by a camp nurse to his wife. I calculated that such a quantity of gold represents more than a hundred thousand dead.” I let out an exclamation. “And imagine!” he went on. “That’s what a single man could divert. When we’ve finished here, I’ll go set up a commission in Auschwitz.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"I immediately set out looking for him: he was well and truly alive, and I had no difficulty finding him; he too was working in Berlin, at the medical department of the Bendlerstrasse. Happy, I called him on the telephone without giving my name; his throaty, musical voice sounded a little annoyed when he answered: “Yes?”—“Professor Hohenegg?”—“Speaking. What’s this about?”—“I’m calling from the SS. It’s about an old debt.” His voice became a shade more irritated. “What are you talking about? Who are you?”—“I’m talking about a bottle of Cognac you promised me nine months ago.” Hohenegg let out a long burst of laughter: “Alas, alas, I have to confess something to you: I thought you were dead, and I drank it to your health.”—“Man of little faith.”—“So you are alive.”—“And promoted: Sturmbannführer.”—“Bravo! Well, I’ll just have to unearth another bottle.”—“I give you twenty-four hours: we’ll drink it tomorrow night. In exchange, dinner will be on me. At Borchardt’s, eight o’clock, does that suit you?” Hohenegg gave a long whistle: “They must have given you a raise too.

19:39|1939|"About the hour-and-a-half-long speech the Reichsführer gave on the night of October 6 to the assembled Reichsleiters and Gauleiters, I don’t have much to say. This speech is less well known than the one, almost twice as long, he read on October 4 to his Obergruppenführers and HSSPFs; but aside from a few differences due to the nature of the respective audiences, and the less informal, less sardonic, less colloquial tone of the second speech, the Reichsführer said essentially the same thing. Thanks to the chance survival of archives, and the victors’ justice, these speeches have become famous far beyond the closed circles for which they were intended; you won’t find a book on the SS, the Reichsführer, or the destruction of the Jews in which they aren’t cited; if their content interests you, you can easily consult them, in several languages; the October 4 speech was entered as evidence in the Nuremberg trials, under document number 1919-PS (it was obviously in this form that I was finally able to study it in detail, after the war, although I learned its general import in Posen itself); moreover, it was recorded, either on a wax disk or on a red oxide magnetic tape—the historians aren’t in agreement, and on this point I cannot enlighten them, not having been present at that speech, but whatever the case the recording has survived and, if you feel so inclined, you can listen to it, and thus hear for yourself the Reichsführer’s monotone, pedantic, didactic, precise voice, a little more urgent when he waxes ironic; there are even, though rarely, moments of anger, especially obvious, in hindsight, when he comes to subjects over which he must have felt he had little control—the widespread corruption, for instance, which he also spoke about on the sixth to the regime’s dignitaries, but on which he insisted especially, as I heard at the time from Brandt, during his speech to the Gruppenführers given on the fourth. If these speeches have entered history, it’s not of course because of all that, but because in this speech the Reichsführer, with a frankness he has never to my knowledge equaled either before or since, with frankness thus and in a manner that could even be called crude, outlined the program of the destruction of the Jews. Even I, when I heard it on October 6, didn’t at first believe my ears, the hall was full, the sumptuous Golden Hall in the castle at Posen, I was in the very back, behind about fifty Gauleiters and leaders of the Party, not to mention a few industrialists, two service chiefs, and three (or maybe two) ministers of the Reich; and I found it, considering the secrecy rules we were bound to, truly shocking, almost indecent, and at the beginning, it made me very ill at ease, and I was certainly not the only one, I could see Gauleiters sigh and mop their foreheads or necks, it wasn’t that they were learning something new, no, everyone, in that great hall with its subdued lighting must have been in the know, even though some of them, until then, probably hadn’t had to think the thing through to the end, to discern its full extent, to think, for instance, about the women and children, and that’s probably why the Reichsführer insisted on this point, far more, moreover, to the Reichsleiters and Gauleiters than to his Gruppenführers, who couldn’t in any case have had any illusions, which is probably why he insisted that, yes, we were indeed killing the women and the children too, so as not to let any ambiguity linger, and that’s precisely what was so uncomfortable, that total absence, for once, of ambiguity, and it was as if he were violating an unwritten rule, even stronger than his own rules he decreed for his subordinates, his Sprachregelungen already absolutely strict, the rule of tact perhaps, that tact he spoke of in his first speech, evoking it in the context of the execution of Röhm and his SA comrades, a kind of natural tact that is alive in us, thank God, he said, a consequence of this tact due to which we have never spoken about it among ourselves, but perhaps it was also a matter of something other than the question of that tact and of those rules, and that’s when I began to understand, I think, the profound reason for these declarations, and also why the dignitaries sighed and sweated so much, for they too, like me, were beginning to understand, to understand that it wasn’t by chance that the Reichsführer, in the beginning of the fifth year of the war, was thus openly referring to the destruction of the Jews before them, without euphemisms, without winks, with simple and brutal words like kill—exterminate, he said, meaning kill or order to have killed— that, for once, the Reichsführer spoke to them quite openly about this question…to tell you how it was, no, that certainly wasn’t by chance, and if he allowed himself to do it, then the Führer knew about it, and worse, the Führer had wanted it, hence their anguish, the Reichsführer was speaking necessarily here in the name of the Führer, and he was saying this, these words that you weren’t supposed to say, and he was recording them, on a disk or a tape, it doesn’t matter, and he was carefully taking note of those present and those absent—among the SS leaders, the only ones who didn’t attend the October 4 speech were Kaltenbrunner, who was sick with phlebitis, Daluege, who had a serious heart disease and was on leave for a year or two, Wolff, just recently appointed HSSPF for Italy and plenipotentiary to Mussolini, and Globocnik, who had just, although I didn’t know it yet and heard about it only after Posen, suddenly been transferred from his little Lublin kingdom to his native town of Trieste, as SSPF for Istria and Dalmatia, under Wolff’s orders in fact, accompanied—but this I wouldn’t know till even later on—by almost the entire personnel of Einsatz Reinhard, T-4 included, everything was being shut down, Auschwitz would henceforth be enough, and the beautiful Adriatic coast would make a fine dumping ground for all these people we had no further use for, even Blobel would come join them a little later on, let them go get killed by Tito’s partisans, that would spare us some housekeeping; and as to the Party dignitaries, note was also taken of the missing heads, but I never saw the list—all that, then, the Reichsführer was doing deliberately, on instructions, and for that there could only have been one reason, hence the perceptible emotion of the listeners, who grasped this reason very well: it was so that none of them could, later on, say that he didn’t know, couldn’t try to make people think, in case of defeat, that he was innocent of the worst, couldn’t think he might someday be able to get off scot-free; it was in order to drag them in, and they understood it very well, hence their distress. The Moscow Conference, at the end of which the Allies swore to pursue the “war criminals” to the furthest corners of the earth, hadn’t yet taken place, that would come a few weeks later, before the end of that month of October 1943, but already, especially since summer, the BBC was conducting an intensive propaganda campaign on this theme, naming names, and with a certain precision, for it sometimes quoted officers and even noncoms from specific KLs, it was very well informed, and the Staatspolizei certainly wondered how, and this, it is entirely correct to note, provoked a certain nervousness among the interested parties, all the more so since the news from the front wasn’t good, to hold on to Italy we had had to strip the Eastern Front, and there wasn’t much chance we could remain on the Donets, we had already lost Briansk, Smolensk, Poltava, and Kremenchug, the Crimea was threatened, in short, anyone could see that things were going badly, and certainly there must have been many who were asking themselves questions about the future, the future of Germany in general of course but their own in particular too, hence a certain effectiveness of this English propaganda, which demoralized not only some who were named, but also others not yet named, by encouraging them to think that the end of the Reich might not automatically mean their own end, and thus rendering the specter of defeat a tiny bit less inconceivable, hence, one can well understand this, when it came to the cadres of the Party, the SS, and the Wehrmacht, the necessity to make them understand that a potential defeat would concern them too, personally, so as to remotivate them a little, that the so-called crimes of some would in the eyes of the Allies be the crimes of all, in the upper echelons at least, that all the boats, or bridges, if you like, were burning, that no return to the past was possible, and that the only salvation was victory. And indeed victory would have settled everything, for if we had won, imagine it for an instant, if Germany had crushed the Reds and destroyed the Soviet Union, there would have been no more question of crimes, or rather, yes, but of Bolshevik crimes, duly documented thanks to the archives seized (the archives of the NKVD in Smolensk, evacuated to Germany and recovered at the end of the war by the Americans, played precisely this role, when the time finally came when they had to explain almost overnight to the good democratic voters why the evil monsters of the day before now had to serve as a bulwark against the heroic allies of the day before, now revealed as even worse monsters), we might even perhaps have conducted full-blown trials, why not, have prosecuted the Bolshevik leaders, imagine that, doing things seriously as the Anglo-Americans later sought to (Stalin, we know, couldn’t have cared less about these trials, he took them for what they were, a hypocrisy, and pointless to boot), and then everyone, with the British and the Americans leading the way, would have made do with us, the diplomats would have adjusted to the new realities, and despite the inevitable squalling of the New York Jews, the European Jews, whom in any case no one would have missed, would have been written off as a loss, like all the other dead, the Gypsies, the Poles, what do I know, the grass grows thick on the graves of the defeated, and no one holds the victor to account, I’m not saying this to try to justify us, no, it’s the simple, frightening truth, look at Roosevelt, that good man, with his dear friend Uncle Joe, how many millions had Stalin already killed, in 1941, or even before 1939, many more than we did, that’s certain, and even if you drew up a full balance sheet he might well remain ahead of us, between collectivization, de-kulakization, the great purges and the deportations of peoples in 1943 and 1944, and all that, everyone knew it at the time, everyone knew more or less what was happening in Russia during the 1930s, Roosevelt knew it too, that friend of mankind, but that never prevented him from praising Stalin’s loyalty and humanity, despite the repeated warnings of Churchill, who was a little less naïve from a certain point of view, a little less realistic, from another, and so if we Germans had in fact won this war, it would certainly have been the same, little by little, the stubborn ones who kept calling us the enemies of mankind would have fallen silent one by one, for lack of an audience, and the diplomats would have smoothed things out, since after all, Krieg ist Krieg und Schnaps ist Schnaps, isn’t that right, and that’s the way of the world. And maybe even in the end our efforts would have been applauded, as the Führer often predicted, or maybe not, in any case many would have applauded, who in the meantime have fallen silent, for we lost, harsh reality. And even if a certain tension had persisted on this subject, for ten or fifteen years, it would have dissipated sooner or later, when for example our diplomats would have firmly condemned, while still reserving the possibility of showing a certain degree of comprehension, the harsh measures, liable to impinge on human rights, that someday or other Great Britain or France would have had to apply in order to restore order in their restive colonies, or, in the case of the United States, to ensure the stability of world commerce and fight the communist hotbeds of revolt, as they indeed ended up doing, with the results we all remember. For it would be a mistake, a serious one, in my opinion, to think that the moral sense of the Western powers differs so fundamentally from our own: after all, a great power is a great power, it doesn’t become one by chance, and doesn’t remain one by chance, either. The people of Monaco, or the inhabitants of Luxembourg, can afford the luxury of a certain political uprightness; it’s a little different for the English. Wasn’t it a British administrator, educated at Oxford or Cambridge, who in 1922 advocated administrative massacres to ensure the security of the colonies, and bitterly regretted that the political situation in the Home Islands rendered these salutary measures impossible? Or, if like some people, you want to charge all our sins to the account of anti-Semitism alone—a gross mistake, in my opinion, but a seductive one for many—wouldn’t you have to acknowledge that France, on the eve of the Great War, went much further in this domain than us (not to mention the Russia of the pogroms!)? I hope, by the way, that you won’t be too surprised that I thus discount anti-Semitism as a fundamental cause of the massacre of the Jews: that would be forgetting that our extermination policies went much further. By the time of our defeat—and far from wanting to rewrite History, I would be the first to acknowledge it—we had already, aside from the Jews, completed the destruction of all the German incurable physically and mentally handicapped, of most of the Gypsies, and of millions of Russians and Poles. And the projects, as you know, were even more ambitious: for the Russians, the necessary natural diminution, according to the experts of the Four-Year Plan and the RSHA, was to reach thirty million, or even forty-six to fifty-one million, according to the dissident opinion of a somewhat zealous Dezernent in the Ostministerium. If the war had lasted a few more years, we would certainly have begun a massive reduction of the Poles. The idea had already been in the air for some time: viz the voluminous correspondence between Gauleiter Greiser in Warthegau and the Reichsführer, where Greiser asks, in May 1942, for permission to use the Kulmhof gassing installations to destroy thirty-five thousand tubercular Poles, who constituted, he said, a grave health menace for his Gau; after seven months, the Reichsführer finally let him understand that his proposition was interesting, but premature. You must think I’m explaining all this to you rather coldly: that’s simply in order to demonstrate to you that the destruction by our deeds of the people of Moses did not stem solely from an irrational hatred of the Jews—I think I’ve already shown how poorly the emotional type of anti-Semite was regarded by the SD and the SS in general—but above all from a firm, well-reasoned acceptance of the recourse to violence to resolve the most varied social problems, in which, moreover, we differed from the Bolsheviks only by our respective evaluations of the categories of problems to be resolved: their approach being based on a horizontal reading of social identity (class), ours on a vertical one (race), but both equally deterministic (as I think I’ve already stressed) and reaching similar conclusions in terms of the remedy to be employed. And if you think carefully about it, you could deduce from this that this will, or at least this capacity, to accept the necessity of a much more radical approach to the problems afflicting all societies, can have been born only from our defeats during the Great War. Every country (except perhaps the United States) suffered; but victory, and the arrogance and moral smugness born of victory, probably allowed the English and the French and even the Italians more readily to forget their sufferings and their losses, and to settle down again, sometimes even to wallow in their self-satisfaction, and thus to grow frightened again more easily, from fear of seeing this oh so fragile compromise fall apart. As for us, we had nothing more to lose. We had fought just as honorably as our enemies; we had been treated like criminals, humiliated and dismembered, and our dead were scorned. The fate of the Russians, objectively, was scarcely any better. What could be more logical, then, than to say: Well, then, if that’s the way it is, if it’s just to sacrifice the best of the nation, to send to their deaths the most patriotic, the most intelligent, the most devoted men, those most loyal to our race, and all in the name of the salvation of the nation—and if that was all for naught—and if their sacrifice is spat upon—then, what right to life should the worst elements have, the criminals, the insane, the retarded, the asocials, the Jews, not to mention our external enemies? The Bolsheviks, I am convinced, reasoned in the same way. Since respecting the rules of so-called humanity was useless to us, why stubbornly persist in a respect for which no one was even grateful? Hence, inevitably, a much harsher, stiffer, more radical approach to our problems. In every society, in every age, social problems have been subject to arbitration between the needs of the group and the rights of the individual, and thus have given rise to a number of responses that are ultimately quite limited: roughly, death, charity, or exclusion (especially, historically, in the form of exile). The Greeks exposed their deformed children; the Arabs, acknowledging that they constituted, economically speaking, a burden that was too heavy for their families, but not wanting to kill them, put them in the care of the community, thanks to the zakat, that obligatory religious charity (a tax for good works); even in our days, in our countries, there exist specialized establishments for such cases, so that their misfortune need not spoil the view of those in good health. Now, if you adopt such an overall vision, you can see that in Europe at least, from the eighteenth century onward, all the distinct solutions to the various problems—public torture for criminals, exile for the contagiously ill (leprosariums), Christian charity for imbeciles—converged, under the influence of the Enlightenment, toward a single type of solution, applicable to all cases and infinitely variable: institutionalized imprisonment, financed by the State, a form of inner exile, if you like, sometimes with pedagogical pretensions, but above all with a practical finality: the criminals to prison, the sick to the hospital, the crazy to the asylum. And who cannot see that these humane solutions, too, resulted from compromise, were made possible by wealth, and remained, in the end, contingent? After the Great War many understood that they were no longer adapted, that they no longer sufficed to address the new amplitude of the problems, because of restricted economic means and also because of the hitherto unthinkable level of the stakes (the millions of dead of the war). New solutions were necessary, and they were found, as man always finds the solutions he needs, as the so-called democratic countries too would have found them, if they had needed them. But then why, you might ask today, the Jews? What do the Jews have in common with your lunatics, your criminals, your contagious? Yet it’s not hard to see that, historically, the Jews constituted themselves as a “problem,” by wanting to remain apart at all costs. Didn’t the first writings against the Jews, those of the Greeks of Alexandria, long before Christ and theological anti-Semitism, accuse them of being an asocial people, of violating the laws of hospitality, the main foundation and political principle of the ancient world, in the name of their food prohibitions, which prevented them from eating at other people’s houses or from receiving them as guests, from being hosts? Then, of course, there was the religious question. I am not seeking here, as some might think, to make the Jews responsible for their catastrophe; I’m simply trying to say that a certain aspect of European history, unfortunate according to some, inevitable according to others, has made it so that even in our days, in times of crisis, it is natural to turn against the Jews, and that if you become involved in a reshaping of society through violence, sooner or later the Jews will end up on the receiving end—sooner, in our case, later, in the Soviets’—and that this is not entirely by chance. Some Jews too, with the threat of anti-Semitism averted, succumb to hubris."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 08:00"|"Around eight o’clock"|"You must find these reflections extremely interesting, I don’t doubt it for an instant; but I have wandered off the subject a little, I still haven’t spoken of that famous day of October 6, which I wanted to describe briefly. A few quick knocks on the door of my compartment had tugged me from my sleep; with the blinds fastened, it was impossible to know the time, I was probably in the midst of a dream, I remember being completely disoriented by them. Then I heard the voice of Mandelbrod’s assistant, gentle but firm: “Sturmbannführer. We’re arriving in half an hour.” I washed, got dressed, and went to stretch my legs in the antechamber. The young woman was standing there: “Hello, Sturmbannführer. Did you sleep well?”—“Yes, thanks. Is Dr. Mandelbrod awake?”—“I don’t know, Sturmbannführer. Would you like some coffee? A full breakfast will be served when we arrive.” She returned with a small tray. I drank the coffee standing up, my legs slightly apart because of the train’s swaying; she sat down on a little armchair, her legs discreetly crossed—she was wearing now, I noticed, a long skirt instead of the black breeches of the day before. Her hair was pulled back in a severe chignon. “You aren’t having any?” I asked.—“No, thanks.” We stayed thus in silence until the squeal of brakes sounded. I gave her back the cup and took my travel bag. The train was slowing down. “Have a good day,” she said. “Dr. Mandelbrod will find you later on.” On the platform, there was a certain amount of confusion; the tired Gauleiters were exiting the train one by one, yawning, welcomed by a squad of civil servants in civilian clothes or in SA uniform. One of them saw my SS uniform and frowned. I pointed to Mandelbrod’s car, and his face lit up: “I’m sorry,” he said as he came forward. I gave him my name, and he consulted a list: “Yes, I see. You are with the members of the Reichsführung, at the Posen Hotel. There’s a room for you. I’ll go find you a car. Here’s the program.” At the hotel, a fancy but rather staid building dating back to the Prussian period, I showered, shaved, changed, and downed a few pieces of toast with jam. Around eight o’clock, I went down to the lobby. People were beginning to come and go. I finally found one of Brandt’s assistants, a Hauptsturmführer, and showed him the program I had been given. “Listen, you can go right now. The Reichsführer won’t come until the afternoon, but there will be some officers there.” The car lent me by the Gau was still waiting, and I had myself driven to the Schloss Posen, admiring on the way the blue belfry and the arcaded loggia of the city hall, then the many-colored façades of the narrow houses of burghers crowded onto the Old Square, reflections of many centuries of subtly fanciful architecture, until this fugitive morning pleasure collided with the castle itself, a vast pile of blocks abutting a large empty square, crude and bristling with pointed roofs and a tall buttressed tower propped against it, massive, proud, severe, dreary, in front of which the penant-bearing Mercedes of the dignitaries were lining up one by one. The program began with a series of lectures given by experts from Speer’s entourage, including Walter Rohland, the steel magnate, who exposed one after the other, with distressing precision, the state of war production. In the first row, listening gravely to this somber news, could be seen most of the government elite: Dr. Goebbels, Minister Rosenberg, Axmann, the Reich Youth Führer, Grand Admiral Dönitz, Feldmarschall Milch from the Luftwaffe, and a beefy man with a bull’s neck, his thick hair combed back, whose name I asked during one of the breaks: Reichsleiter Bormann, the personal secretary of the Führer and the head of the NSDAP chancellery. His name was known to me, of course, but I didn’t know much about him; the newspapers and newsreels at the cinema never mentioned him, and I didn’t remember seeing his photo. After Rohland, it was Speer’s turn: his presentation, which lasted less than half an hour, reiterated the same themes as those dealt with the day before at the Prinz-Albrecht-Palais, but in a surprisingly direct, almost brusque language. Only then did I notice Mandelbrod: a special place had been arranged on the side for his cumbersome platform-chair, and he listened, his eyes creased, with Buddhist detachment, flanked by two of his assistants—so there really were two of them—and by the tall rugged figure of Herr Leland. Speer’s last words provoked a tumult: returning to the theme of obstruction by individual Gaus, he mentioned his agreement with the Reichsführer, threatening to deal ruthlessly with the recalcitrant. As soon as he had come down from the podium, several Gauleiters surrounded him, expostulating; I was too far away, at the back of the hall, to hear what they said, but I could imagine it. Leland had leaned over and was murmuring something into Mandelbrod’s ear. Then we were invited to return to town, to the Ostland Hotel, where the dignitaries were staying, for a buffet reception. Mandelbrod’s assistants led him out a side exit, but I found him in the courtyard and went to greet him and Herr Leland. I could see then how he was traveling: his special Mercedes, with its immense interior, was equipped with a mechanism by which his armchair, detached from its platform, slid into the car; a second vehicle carried the platform, along with the two assistants. Mandelbrod had me get in with him, and I sat down on a jump seat; Leland sat in front, next to the chauffeur. I regretted not traveling with the young women: Mandelbrod didn’t seem to notice the stinking gases his body emitted; fortunately the journey was a short one. Mandelbrod didn’t speak; he seemed to be drowsing. I wondered if he ever got up out of his armchair, and if not, how did he get dressed, how did he attend to his bodily functions? His assistants, in any case, must have been able to bear anything. During the reception, I talked with two officers from the Persönlicher Stab, Werner Grothmann, who still hadn’t gotten over being appointed to Brandt’s position (Brandt, promoted to Standartenführer, was taking Wolff’s), and an adjutant in charge of the police. It was they, I think, who first told me about the strong impression caused among the Gruppenführers by the Reichsführer’s speech two days before. We also talked about Globocnik’s departure, a real surprise for everyone; but we didn’t know each other well enough to speculate on the motives for this transfer. One of the two amazons—it was indeed hard for me to tell them apart, I couldn’t even say which one had offered herself to me the night before—appeared beside me. “Excuse me, meine Herren,” she said with a smile. I excused myself in turn and followed her through the crowd. Mandelbrod and Leland were talking with Speer and Rohland. I saluted them and congratulated Speer on his speech; he assumed a melancholy air: “Obviously it wasn’t to everyone’s taste.”—“It doesn’t matter,” Leland retorted. “If you manage to get on with the Reichsführer, none of these drunken idiots can stand in your way.” I was surprised: I had never heard Herr Leland speak so brutally. Speer was nodding. “Try to stay in regular contact with the Reichsführer,” Mandelbrod whispered. “Don’t let this new momentum lapse. For minor questions, if you don’t want to bother the Reichsführer himself, just contact my young friend here. I can guarantee his reliability.” Speer contemplated me absentmindedly: “I already have a liaison officer at the ministry.”—“Of course,” Mandelbrod said. “But Sturmbannführer Aue will, I’m sure, have more direct access to the Reichsführer. Don’t worry about bothering him.”—“Fine, fine,” Speer said. Rohland had turned to Leland: “We agree, then, about Mannheim…” With a brief pressure on my elbow, Mandelbrod’s assistant let me understand that I was no longer required. I saluted and withdrew discreetly to the buffet. The young woman had followed me and ordered a tea while I nibbled on a hors d’oeuvre. “I think Dr. Mandelbrod is very pleased with you,” she said in her beautiful, flat voice.—“I don’t see why, but if you say so, I must believe you. Have you been working for him for a long time?”—“For several years.”—“And before?”—“I studied for my doctorate in Latin and German philology, in Frankfurt.” I raised my eyebrows: “I’d never have guessed. It isn’t too difficult, working full-time for Dr. Mandelbrod? He seems pretty demanding.”—“Everyone serves where he has to,” she replied without hesitating. “I am extremely honored by Dr. Mandelbrod’s trust. It’s thanks to men like him and Herr Leland that Germany will be saved.” I examined her smooth, oval, barely made-up face. She must have been very beautiful, but no detail, no particularity allowed one to grab hold of this entirely abstract beauty. “May I ask you a question?”—I asked her.—“Of course.”—“The hallway outside my compartment wasn’t very well lit. Are you the one who came and knocked on my door?” She gave a pearly little laugh: “The hallway wasn’t all that badly lit. But the answer is no: that was my colleague Hilde. Why? Would you rather it had been me?”—“No, I was just wondering,” I said stupidly.—“If the opportunity comes up again,” she said, looking me straight in the eye, “it will be my pleasure. I hope you’ll be less tired.” I blushed: “What is your name, then? So I’ll know.” She held out her little hand with its shimmering nails; her palm was dry and soft and her handshake as firm as a man’s. “Hedwig. Have a good afternoon, Sturmbannführer.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 15:00"|"around three o’clock in the afternoon"|"The Reichsführer, surrounded by a silent horde of officers and flanked by Rudolf Brandt, made his appearance around three o’clock in the afternoon, soon after we returned to the Schloss. Brandt noticed me and motioned to me with his head; he was already wearing his new stripes, but didn’t give me time to congratulate him when I came over: “After the Reichsführer’s speech, we’re leaving for Cracow. You will come with us.”—“Fine, Standartenführer.” Himmler had sat down in the first row, next to Bormann. First we were fed a speech by Dönitz, who justified the temporary cessation of submarine warfare, while hoping it would soon resume; by Milch, who hoped the Luftwaffe’s new tactics would soon put an end to the terrorist raids on our cities; and by Schepmann, the new Chief of Staff of the SA, who hoped for nothing that I could remember. Around five thirty, the Reichsführer mounted the podium. Blood-red flags and the black helmets of the honor guard framed his small silhouette on the high platform; the tall microphone stands almost hid his face; the light from the hall played on his glasses. The amplification gave his voice a metallic tone. Of the reactions of the audience, I have already spoken; I was sorry, finding myself in the rear of the hall, to have to contemplate the backs of people’s necks rather than their faces. Despite my alarm and surprise, I might add that some of his words touched me personally, especially those that had to do with the effect of this decision on those in charge of carrying it out, of the danger they ran in their minds of becoming cruel and heartless and no longer respecting human life, or of going soft and succumbing to weakness and nervous depression— yes, I knew this appallingly narrow way between Scylla and Charybdis well, these words could have been addressed to me, and to a certain extent, in all modesty, they were, to me and to those who like me were afflicted with this horrific responsibility, by our Reichsführer who understood well what we were enduring. Not that he let himself give in to the slightest sentimentality; as he said so brutally, toward the end of the speech: Many will weep, but that doesn’t matter; there is a lot of weeping already, words, to my ear, almost Shakespearean in breath, but maybe that was in the other speech, the one I read later on, I’m not sure, it matters little. After the speech—it must have been seven o’clock—Reichsleiter Bormann invited us to a buffet in a neighboring room. The dignitaries, especially the older Gauleiters, stormed the bar; since I had to travel with the Reichsführer, I abstained from drinking. I saw him in a corner, standing in front of Mandelbrod, with Bormann, Goebbels, and Leland; his back was turned to the room and he wasn’t paying the slightest attention to the effect his words had produced. The Gauleiters downed drink after drink and talked in low voices; from time to time one of them barked out a platitude; his colleagues solemnly nodded and drank some more. I must confess that I, for my part, was, despite the effect of the speech, more preoccupied by the little scene of that afternoon: I felt clearly that Mandelbrod was seeking to position me, but how and in relation to whom, I didn’t yet see; I knew too little about his relations with the Reichsführer, or with Speer, for that matter, to come to any conclusion, and that worried me, I felt that these issues went beyond me. I wondered if Hilde or Hedwig could have enlightened me; at the same time I knew very well that, even in bed, they would have told me nothing that Mandelbrod didn’t want me to know. And Speer? For a long time I thought I remembered, but without thinking about it, that he too was talking with the Reichsführer during this reception. Then one day, some time ago, in a book, I learned that for years Speer has energetically denied having been there, that he claims he left at lunchtime with Rohland, and that he wasn’t present at the Reichsführer’s speech. All I can say about it is that it’s possible: for my part, after the words we exchanged at the noon reception, I didn’t pay any special attention to him, I was more concentrated on Dr. Mandelbrod and the Reichsführer, and also, there were really a lot of people; nonetheless, I thought I had seen him that evening, and he himself has described the frantic drinking bout of the Gauleiters, at the end of which, according to his own book, many of them had to be carried to the special train; at that moment, I had already left with the Reichsführer, so I didn’t see that myself, but he describes it as if he had been there, so it’s hard to say, and in any case it’s a rather pointless quibble: whether or not he heard the Reichsführer’s words that day, Reichsminister Speer knew, like everyone else; at the very least, by that point, he knew enough to know that it was better not to know any more, to quote a historian, and I can affirm that a little later on, when I knew him better, he knew everything, including about the women and children who, after all, couldn’t have been warehoused without his knowing it, even if he never spoke about it, that’s true, and even if he wasn’t up to date on all the technical details, which didn’t concern his specific field of responsibility, after all. I won’t deny that he would no doubt have preferred not to know; Gauleiter von Schirach, whom I saw that night sprawled on a chair, his tie undone and his collar open, drinking one Cognac after another, would certainly have preferred not to know, either, and many others along with him, either because the courage of their convictions failed them or because they were already afraid of the Allied reprisals, but it should be added that those men, the Gauleiters, did little for the war effort, and even hampered it in some cases, whereas Speer, as all the specialists now affirm, gave at least two extra years to National Socialist Germany, more than anyone he contributed to prolonging the business, and he would have prolonged it even more if he could have, and certainly he wanted victory, he struggled vehemently for victory, the victory of this National Socialist Germany that was destroying the Jews, women and children included, and the Gypsies too and many others besides, and that’s why I permit myself, despite the immense respect I have for his accomplishments as Minister, to find his oh so very public postwar regrets somewhat indecent, regrets that saved his skin, indeed, whereas he deserved life neither more nor less than the others, Sauckel, for instance, or Jodl, and which then forced him, in order to maintain the pose, into ever more intricately baroque contortions, whereas it would have been so simple, especially after he had served his sentence, to come out and say: Yes, I knew, and so what? As my comrade Eichmann stated so well, in Jerusalem, with all the direct simplicity of simple men: “Regrets, that’s for children.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

First we were fed a speech by Dönitz, who justified the temporary cessation of submarine warfare, while hoping it would soon resume; by Milch, who hoped the Luftwaffe’s new tactics would soon put an end to the terrorist raids on our cities; and by Schepmann, the new Chief of Staff of the SA, who hoped for nothing that I could remember. Around five thirty, the Reichsführer mounted the podium. Blood-red flags and the black helmets of the honor guard framed his small silhouette on the high platform; the tall microphone stands almost hid his face; the light from the hall played on his glasses. The amplification gave his voice a metallic tone. Of the reactions of the audience, I have already spoken; I was sorry, finding myself in the rear of the hall, to have to contemplate the backs of people’s necks rather than their faces. Despite my alarm and surprise, I might add that some of his words touched me personally, especially those that had to do with the effect of this decision on those in charge of carrying it out, of the danger they ran in their minds of becoming cruel and heartless and no longer respecting human life, or of going soft and succumbing to weakness and nervous depression— yes, I knew this appallingly narrow way between Scylla and Charybdis well, these words could have been addressed to me, and to a certain extent, in all modesty, they were, to me and to those who like me were afflicted with this horrific responsibility, by our Reichsführer who understood well what we were enduring. Not that he let himself give in to the slightest sentimentality; as he said so brutally, toward the end of the speech: Many will weep, but that doesn’t matter; there is a lot of weeping already, words, to my ear, almost Shakespearean in breath, but maybe that was in the other speech, the one I read later on, I’m not sure, it matters little. After the speech—it must have been seven o’clock—Reichsleiter Bormann invited us to a buffet in a neighboring room. The dignitaries, especially the older Gauleiters, stormed the bar; since I had to travel with the Reichsführer, I abstained from drinking. I saw him in a corner, standing in front of Mandelbrod, with Bormann, Goebbels, and Leland; his back was turned to the room and he wasn’t paying the slightest attention to the effect his words had produced. The Gauleiters downed drink after drink and talked in low voices; from time to time one of them barked out a platitude; his colleagues solemnly nodded and drank some more. I must confess that I, for my part, was, despite the effect of the speech, more preoccupied by the little scene of that afternoon: I felt clearly that Mandelbrod was seeking to position me, but how and in relation to whom, I didn’t yet see; I knew too little about his relations with the Reichsführer, or with Speer, for that matter, to come to any conclusion, and that worried me, I felt that these issues went beyond me. I wondered if Hilde or Hedwig could have enlightened me; at the same time I knew very well that, even in bed, they would have told me nothing that Mandelbrod didn’t want me to know. And Speer? For a long time I thought I remembered, but without thinking about it, that he too was talking with the Reichsführer during this reception. Then one day, some time ago, in a book, I learned that for years Speer has energetically denied having been there, that he claims he left at lunchtime with Rohland, and that he wasn’t present at the Reichsführer’s speech. All I can say about it is that it’s possible: for my part, after the words we exchanged at the noon reception, I didn’t pay any special attention to him, I was more concentrated on Dr. Mandelbrod and the Reichsführer, and also, there were really a lot of people; nonetheless, I thought I had seen him that evening, and he himself has described the frantic drinking bout of the Gauleiters, at the end of which, according to his own book, many of them had to be carried to the special train; at that moment, I had already left with the Reichsführer, so I didn’t see that myself, but he describes it as if he had been there, so it’s hard to say, and in any case it’s a rather pointless quibble: whether or not he heard the Reichsführer’s words that day, Reichsminister Speer knew, like everyone else; at the very least, by that point, he knew enough to know that it was better not to know any more, to quote a historian, and I can affirm that a little later on, when I knew him better, he knew everything, including about the women and children who, after all, couldn’t have been warehoused without his knowing it, even if he never spoke about it, that’s true, and even if he wasn’t up to date on all the technical details, which didn’t concern his specific field of responsibility, after all. I won’t deny that he would no doubt have preferred not to know; Gauleiter von Schirach, whom I saw that night sprawled on a chair, his tie undone and his collar open, drinking one Cognac after another, would certainly have preferred not to know, either, and many others along with him, either because the courage of their convictions failed them or because they were already afraid of the Allied reprisals, but it should be added that those men, the Gauleiters, did little for the war effort, and even hampered it in some cases, whereas Speer, as all the specialists now affirm, gave at least two extra years to National Socialist Germany, more than anyone he contributed to prolonging the business, and he would have prolonged it even more if he could have, and certainly he wanted victory, he struggled vehemently for victory, the victory of this National Socialist Germany that was destroying the Jews, women and children included, and the Gypsies too and many others besides, and that’s why I permit myself, despite the immense respect I have for his accomplishments as Minister, to find his oh so very public postwar regrets somewhat indecent, regrets that saved his skin, indeed, whereas he deserved life neither more nor less than the others, Sauckel, for instance, or Jodl, and which then forced him, in order to maintain the pose, into ever more intricately baroque contortions, whereas it would have been so simple, especially after he had served his sentence, to come out and say: Yes, I knew, and so what?

"ap ~ 08:00"|"around eight o’clock"|"I left the reception around eight o’clock, on Brandt’s orders, without managing to say a proper goodbye to Dr. Mandelbrod, deep in discussion. With several other officers, I was driven to the Posen Hotel so I could pick up my things, then to the train station, where the Reichsführer’s special train was waiting for us. Once again, I had a private cabin, but of much more modest dimensions than in Dr. Mandelbrod’s car, with a tiny couchette. This train, called Heinrich, was extraordinarily well designed: in front, along with the Reichsführer’s personal armored cars, were cars made into offices and into a mobile communications center, all of them protected by flatcars equipped with antiaircraft weaponry; the entire Reichsführung-SS, if necessary, could keep working on the move. I didn’t see the Reichsführer get in; a little while after we arrived, the train started off; this time there was a window in my cabin, so I could put out the light and, sitting in the dark, contemplate the night, a beautiful, clear fall night, lit by stars and a crescent moon that shed a fine metallic gleam over Poland’s poor landscape. From Posen to Cracow it’s about four hundred kilometers; with the many stops required by alerts or blockages, we arrived long after dawn; awake already and sitting on my couchette, I watched the gray plains and potato fields slowly turn pink. At the Cracow train station, an honor guard was waiting for us, led by the Generalgouverneur, with a red carpet and a brass band; from a distance I saw Frank, surrounded by young Polish women in national dress carrying baskets of hothouse flowers, give the Reichsführer a German salute that almost made the seams of his uniform burst, then exchange a few animated words with him before they were swallowed up by an enormous sedan. We were given rooms in a hotel at the foot of the Wawel; I bathed, shaved carefully, and sent one of my uniforms to the cleaners. Then, strolling through the sunny, beautiful old streets of Cracow, I headed toward the HSSPF’s offices, where I sent a telex to Berlin to ask for news of my project’s progress. At midday, I attended the official lunch as a member of the Reichsführer’s delegation; I was seated at a table with several SS and Wehrmacht officers, as well as minor civil servants of the Generalgouvernement; at the main table, Bierkamp sat next to the Reichsführer and the Generalgouverneur, but I had no opportunity to go over and greet him. The conversation centered on Lublin, with Frank’s men confirming the rumor, in the GG, that Globocnik had been fired because of the epic scale of his embezzlements: according to one version, the Reichsführer even wanted to have him arrested and tried, as an example, but Globocnik had prudently accumulated a large number of compromising documents, and had used them to negotiate an almost golden retreat for himself to his native coast. After the banquet there were speeches, but I didn’t wait and went back to town to make my report to Brandt, who had established himself at the HSSPF’s. There wasn’t much to say: aside from the D III, which had immediately said yes, we were still waiting for the opinions of the other departments as well as the RSHA. Brandt told me to speed things up as soon as I returned: the Reichsführer wanted the project to be ready by midmonth."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Little by little, I was introduced to the other guests: industrialists, superior officers from the Wehrmacht or the Luftwaffe, a colleague of Speer’s, other senior officials. I was the only member of the SS and also the lowest-ranking of the gathering, but no one seemed to pay that any heed, and Herr Leland introduced me as “Dr. Aue,” sometimes adding that I carried out “important functions for the Reichsführer-SS”; so I was treated quite cordially, and my nervousness, which at the outset had been rather strong, slowly diminished. Around noon we were served sandwiches, pâté, and beer. “A light snack,” Leland declared, “so we won’t get too tired.” The hunting began afterward; we were poured coffee, then everyone was given a game bag, some Swiss chocolate, and a flask of brandy. The rain had stopped and weak sunlight seemed to want to pierce the grayness; according to one general who said he knew hunting, it was perfect weather. We were going to hunt black grouse, a privilege that was apparently very rare in Germany. “This house was bought after the war by a Jew,” Leland explained to his guests. “He wanted to give himself lordly airs, and he had the grouse imported from Sweden. The woods suited them well, and the present owner puts strict limits on hunting.” I knew nothing about it, and had no intention of learning; out of politeness, I had nonetheless made up my mind to accompany the hunters rather than set off on my own. Leland gathered us on the front steps, and some servants distributed the shotguns, ammunition, and dogs. Since black grouse is hunted either singly or in pairs, we would be divided into little groups; to avoid accidents, everyone was assigned a section of the forest, and was not to stray from it; what’s more, our departures would be staggered. The hunt-loving general set off first, alone with a dog, then after him a few pairs. Margret Speer, to my surprise, had joined the group and had also taken a shotgun; she set out with her husband’s colleague, Hettlage. Leland turned to me: “Max, why don’t you accompany the Reichsminister? Go that way. I’ll go with Herr Ströhlein.” I spread out my hands: “As you wish.” Speer, his shotgun already under his arm, smiled at me: “Good idea! Come.” We went through the park toward the woods. Speer was wearing a leather Bavarian jacket with rounded lapels, and a hat; I had also borrowed a hat. At the entrance to the wood, Speer loaded his weapon, a double-barreled shotgun. I kept mine on my shoulder, unloaded. The dog they had given us fidgeted, stationed at the edge of the wood, its tongue lolling out, pointing. “Have you hunted grouse before?” Speer asked.—“Never, Herr Reichsminister. In fact, I don’t hunt at all. If it’s all right with you, I’ll just walk with you.” He looked surprised: “As you like.” He pointed to the forest: “If I understood correctly, we should walk a kilometer till we reach a stream, then cross it. Everything beyond it, to the edge of the forest, is ours. Herr Leland will stay on this side.” He set out into the undergrowth. It was quite dense; we had to go around the bushes, it was impossible to walk straight; drops of water streamed from the leaves and splattered onto our hats and hands; on the ground, the dead, wet leaves gave off a strong odor of earth and humus—beautiful, rich, and invigorating, but it brought unhappy memories to my mind. A sudden burst of bitterness invaded me: so this is what they’ve turned me into, I said to myself, a man who can’t see a forest without thinking about a mass grave. A dead branch snapped under my boot. “It’s surprising that you don’t like hunting,” Speer commented. Absorbed in my thoughts, I answered without thinking: “I don’t like killing, Herr Reichsminister.” He gave me a curious look, and I explained: “It’s sometimes necessary to kill out of duty, Herr Reichsminister. Killing for pleasure is a choice.” He smiled: “As for me, thank God, I’ve done nothing but kill for pleasure. I’ve never been to war.” We walked a little more in silence, amid the crackling of branches and the noise of water, soft and discreet. “What were you doing in Russia, Sturmbannführer?” Speer asked. “You served in the Waffen-SS?”—“No, Herr Reichsminister. I was with the SD. In charge of security matters.”—“I see.” He hesitated. Then he said in a calm, detached voice: “We hear a lot of rumors about the fate of the Jews, in the East. You must know something about it?”—“I know the rumors, Herr Reichsminister. The SD collects them and I’ve read the reports. They have many different sources.”—“You must have some idea of the truth, in your position.” Curiously, he made no allusion to the Reichsführer’s Posen speech (I was convinced at the time that he had been there, but maybe he had in fact left early). I answered courteously: “Herr Reichsminister, for a large part of my functions, I’m compelled to secrecy. I think you can understand. If you really want some explanations, might I suggest that you address the Reichsführer or Standartenführer Brandt? I’m sure they’ll be happy to send you a detailed report.” We had reached the stream: the dog, happy, capered about in the shallow water. “Here it is,” Speer said. He pointed to a zone a little farther off: “You see, there, in the hollow, the forest changes. There are evergreens, and fewer alder trees, and some bay shrubs. That’s the best place to flush grouse. If you’re not shooting, stay behind me.” We crossed the stream in long strides; over the hollow, Speer closed his shotgun, which he had been carrying open under his arm, and shouldered it. Then he began walking forward, on the lookout. The dog stayed near him, its tail pointing. After a few minutes I heard a loud noise and saw a large brown shape fly up through the trees; at the same instant, Speer pulled the trigger, but he must have missed the mark, since I could still hear the sound of wings through the echo. Thick smoke and the acrid smell of cordite filled the undergrowth. Speer hadn’t lowered his shotgun, but everything was quiet now. Once again, there was the noise of wings among the wet branches, but Speer didn’t shoot; I hadn’t seen anything, either. The third bird took off right under our noses, I saw it very clearly, it had rather broad wings and a collar of feathers, and twisted through the trees with an agility surprising for its mass, accelerating as it turned; Speer pulled the trigger but the bird was too quick, he hadn’t had time to traverse and the shot went wide. He opened the gun, ejected the casings, blew on it to get rid of the smoke, and pulled two cartridges out of his jacket pocket. “Grouse are very difficult to hunt,” he commented. “That’s why it’s interesting. You have to choose your weapon well. This one is balanced, but a little too long for my taste.” He looked at me, smiling: “In the spring, it’s very beautiful, during the mating season. The cocks clack their beaks, they gather together in clearings to strut and sing, displaying their colors. The females are very dull, as is often the case.” He finished loading his shotgun, then raised it before starting off again. In dense places, he cleared a path for himself between the branches with the barrel of the gun, without ever lowering it. When he flushed another bird, he pulled the trigger right away, a little in front of him; I heard the bird falling and at the same time the dog leaping and disappearing into the brush. It reappeared a few seconds later, the bird in its mouth, the head hanging down. It set it down at Speer’s feet, and he put it away in his bag. A little farther on, we came out into a clearing in the wood covered with yellowing tufts of grass and opening out onto the fields. Speer took out his chocolate bar: “Would you like some?”—“No, thanks. Do you mind if I take the time to smoke a cigarette?”—“Not at all. It’s a good place to rest.” He opened his gun, put it down, and sat down at the foot of a tree, nibbling on his chocolate. I drank a swig of brandy, handed him the flask, and lit a cigarette. The grass I was sitting on was wetting my pants, but I didn’t mind: hat on my knees, I rested my head against the rough bark of the pine tree I was leaning against and contemplated the calm stretch of grass and the silent woods. “You know,” Speer said, “I entirely understand the requirements of security. But more and more they are in conflict with the needs of the war industry. Too many potential workers are not deployed.” I exhaled the smoke before replying: “That’s possible, Herr Reichsminister. But in this situation, with our difficulties, I think priority conflicts are inevitable.”—“But they should be resolved.”—“Indeed. But in the end, Herr Reichsminister, it’s up to the Führer to decide, isn’t it? The Reichsführer is only obeying his orders.” He bit into his chocolate bar again: “You don’t think that the priority, for the Führer, as well as for us, is to win the war?”—“Certainly, Herr Reichsminister.”—“Then why deprive us of precious resources? Every week, the Wehrmacht comes and complains to me that Jewish workers are being taken away from them. And they’re not being redeployed elsewhere, otherwise I’d know it. It’s ridiculous! In Germany, the Jewish question is resolved, and elsewhere, what importance does it have for now? Let’s win the war first; afterward there will always be time to resolve the other problems.” I chose my words carefully: “Perhaps, Herr Reichsminister, some people believe that since the war is taking so long to be won, some problems ought to be resolved right away…” He turned his head to me and stared at me with his keen eyes: “You think so?”—“I don’t know. It’s a possibility. Can I ask you what the Führer says about it when you talk to him?” He bit his lip pensively: “The Führer never talks about these things. Not with me, at least.” He got up and brushed off his pants. “Shall we go on?” I threw away my cigarette, then drank a little more brandy and put the flask away: “Which way?”—“That’s a good question. I’m afraid, if we cross to the other side, we might come across one of our friends.” He looked toward the back of the opening, at the right: “If we go that way, we should come back toward the stream. Then we can go back the way we came.” We started off, walking alongside the edge of the wood; the dog followed us a few steps away, in the wet grass of the meadow. “Actually,” Speer said, “I haven’t thanked you yet for your help. I appreciate it a lot.”—“It’s a pleasure, Herr Reichsminister. I hope it’s useful. Are you satisfied with your new cooperation with the Reichsführer?”—“To tell the truth, Sturmbannführer, I expected more from him. I have already sent him several reports on Gauleiters who refuse to close down useless companies for the sake of war production. But from what I can see, the Reichsführer is content to forward these reports to Reichsleiter Bormann. And Bormann of course always sides with the Gauleiters. The Reichsführer seems to accept it quite passively.” We had reached the end of the clearing and were entering the wood. It began to rain again, a fine, light rain that soaked through our clothes. Speer had fallen silent and was walking with his gun raised, concentrating on the bushes in front of him. We walked along this way for half an hour, to the stream, then retraced our steps diagonally, before returning again to the stream. From time to time I would hear an isolated gunshot farther away, a dull sound in the rain. Speer pulled the trigger four more times and shot a black grouse that had a beautiful ruff of feathers with metallic glints. Soaked to the bone, we crossed the stream again, heading toward the house. A little before the park, Speer spoke to me again: “Sturmbannführer, I have a request. Brigadeführer Kammler is in the process of building an underground installation, in the Harz, for the production of rockets. I would like to visit these installations, to see how the work is coming along. Could you arrange that for me?” Taken by surprise, I replied: “I don’t know, Herr Reichsminister. I haven’t heard about it. But I’ll make the request.” He laughed: “A few months ago, Obergruppenführer Pohl sent me a letter to complain that I’d visited only one single concentration camp and that I had formed my opinion about prisoner labor employment with too little information. I’ll send you a copy. If they make difficulties for you, just show them that.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 09:00"|"about nine o’clock"|"Sunday was a quiet day. I slept late, until about nine o’clock—usually I got up at 5:30—and went down to breakfast. I sat down in front of one of the big casement windows and leafed through an old edition of Pascal, in French, which I had found in the library. At the end of the morning, I accompanied Frau Speer and Frau von Wrede on a walk in the park; the latter’s husband was playing cards with an industrialist known for having built his empire through clever Aryanizations, the hunter general, and Hettlage. The grass, still wet, glistened, and puddles punctuated the gravel and dirt paths; the humid air was cool, invigorating, and our breaths formed little clouds in front of our faces. The sky remained uniformly gray. At noon I had coffee with Speer, who had just made his appearance. He spoke to me in detail about the question of foreign workers and his problems with Gauleiter Sauckel; then the conversation turned to the case of Ohlendorf, whom Speer seemed to regard as a romantic. My notions of economics were too rudimentary for me to be able to support Ohlendorf’s theories; Speer vigorously defended his principle of industrial self-responsibility. “In the end, there’s only one argument: it works. After the war, Dr. Ohlendorf can reform as he likes, if anyone wants to listen to him; but in the meantime, as I said to you yesterday, let’s win the war.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"ap ~ 05:00"|"Around five o’clock"|"After this meeting I went back to my offices to work. It was pouring outside, I could barely see the trees of the Tiergarten through the downpour whipping the leaf-stripped branches. Around five o’clock, I let Fräulein Praxa go; Walser and Obersturmführer Elias, another specialist sent by Brandt, left at around six o’clock, with Isenbeck. An hour later I went to find Asbach, who was still working. “Are you coming, Untersturmführer? I’ll buy you a drink.” He looked at his watch: “Don’t you think they’re coming back? It’s almost their time.” I looked out the window: it was dark out and still raining a little. “You think—with this weather?” But in the lobby the porter stopped us: “Luftgefahr Fifteen, meine Herren,” a serious raid on its way. They must have detected the planes ahead of time. I turned to Asbach and said cheerfully: “You were right, after all. What should we do? Take our chances outside or wait in here?” Asbach looked a little worried: “It’s just that I have my wife…”—“In my opinion, you don’t have time to go home. I would have given you Piontek, but he left already.” I thought. “We’d do better to wait here till it passes, you can go home afterward. Your wife will go to a shelter, she’ll be fine.” He hesitated: “Listen, Sturmbannführer, I’ll go call her. She’s pregnant, I don’t want her to worry.”—“Right. I’ll wait for you.” I went out onto the steps and lit a cigarette. The sirens began to wail, and the passersbys on the Königsplatz hurried along, anxious to find a shelter. I wasn’t worried: this annex of the ministry had an excellent bunker. I finished my cigarette as the flak opened up and returned to the lobby. Asbach was running down the stairs: “It’s fine, she’s going to her mother’s. It’s just next door.”—“Did you open the windows?” I asked him. We went down into the shelter, a block of solid concrete, well lit, with chairs, folding cots, and large casksful of water. Not many people were there: most of the civil servants went home early, because of the lines for shopping and the air raids. In the distance, it was beginning to thunder. Then I heard well-spaced, massive explosions: one by one they came closer, like the mammoth footsteps of a giant. At each impact the pressure of the air increased, pressing painfully on our ears. There was an immense roar, very close, I could feel the bunker’s walls tremble. The lights flickered and then went out all at once, plunging the shelter into darkness. A girl yelped in terror. Someone turned on a flashlight; others scraped matches. “Isn’t there an emergency generator?” another voice began, but was interrupted by a deafening explosion; rubble rained down from the ceiling, people cried out. I smelled smoke, the smell of explosives bit into my nose: the building must have been hit. The explosions drew off; through the ringing in my ears, I could dimly hear the throbbing of the squadrons. A woman was crying; a man’s voice grunted out curses; I lit my lighter and headed for the armored door. With the porter, I tried to open it: it was blocked, the stairway must have been obstructed by debris. Three of us rammed it with our shoulders and managed to open it enough to slip outside. Bricks were piled on the stairs; I climbed up to the ground floor, followed by a civil servant: the main entrance door had been blown off its hinges and hurled into the lobby; flames were licking the paneling and the porter’s lodge. I ran up the staircase, down a hallway cluttered with window frames and ripped-off doors, then up another floor, to my offices: I wanted to try to save the most important files. The iron balustrade on the staircase was bent: the pocket of my tunic caught on a piece of twisted metal and ripped open. Upstairs, the offices were burning and I had to turn back. In the hallway, an employee was carrying a pile of files; another joined us, his face pale beneath the black traces of smoke and dust: “Leave that! The west wing is burning. A bomb came through the roof.” I had thought the attack was over, but again squadrons were rumbling in the sky; a series of explosions approached at a frightening speed, we ran for the basement, a massive explosion lifted me up and threw me into the stairway. I must have stayed there for a bit, stunned; I came to, blinded by a glaring white light that turned out to be a little flashlight; I heard Asbach shouting, “Sturmbannführer! Sturmbannführer!”—“I’m all right,” I muttered, getting up. In the glow from the fire in the entryway, I examined my tunic: the metal point had cut through the cloth, it was ruined. “The ministry is burning,” another voice said. “We have to get out.” With some other men we cleared the entrance to the bunker as well as we could, so everyone could climb out. The sirens were still wailing but the flak had fallen silent, the last planes were flying away. It was 8:30, the raid had lasted an hour. Someone pointed to some buckets and we formed a chain to fight the fire: it was laughable, in twenty minutes we had used up the water stored in the basement. The faucets didn’t work, the bombs must have burst the pipes; the porter tried to call the firemen, but the telephone was cut off. I recovered my overcoat from the shelter and went out into the square to examine the damage. The east wing looked intact, aside from the gaping windows, but part of the west wing had collapsed, and the neighboring windows vomited thick black smoke. Our offices must have been burning too. Asbach joined me, his face covered in blood. “Are you hurt?” I asked.—“It’s nothing. A brick.” I was still deafened, my ears were ringing painfully. I looked at the Tiergarten: the trees, lit up by several fires, had been smashed, broken, toppled—it looked like a wood in Flanders after an attack, in the books I read as a child. “I’m going home,” Asbach said. Anguish twisted his bloodstained face. “I want to find my wife.”—“Go on. Be careful of falling walls.” Two fire trucks arrived and maneuvered into position, but there seemed to be a problem with the water. The ministry employees were leaving, many carrying files that they put down a little farther away, on the sidewalks: for half an hour I helped them carry binders and papers; my own offices were unreachable in any case. A strong wind had arisen, and to the north, the east, and farther to the south, beyond the Tiergarten, the nighttime sky glowed red. An officer came over to tell us that the fires were spreading, but the ministry and the neighboring buildings seemed to me to be protected by the bend in the Spree on one side and the Tiergarten and Königsplatz on the other.

"ap ~ 10:00"|"around ten o’clock"|"Very early in the morning, without waiting for Piontek, I took the car from the garage and went home. The streets, obstructed by burned or overturned trolleys, fallen trees, rubble, were hard to navigate. A cloud of black, acrid smoke veiled the sky and many passersby were holding wet towels or handkerchiefs over their mouths. It was still drizzling. I passed lines of people pushing strollers or little wagonsful of belongings, or else lugging or dragging suitcases. Everywhere water was escaping from pipes, I had to drive through pools hiding debris that could shred my tires at any moment. Still, many cars were still circulating, most of them without windows and some even missing doors, but full of people: those who had space picked up bombing victims, and I did the same for an exhausted mother with two young children who wanted to go see her parents. I cut through the devastated Tiergarten; the Victory Column, still standing as if out of defiance, rose in the midst of a large lake formed by the water from shattered mains, and I had to make a big detour to skirt round it. I dropped the woman off in the rubble of the Händelallee and went on to my apartment. Everywhere, teams were at work repairing the damage; in front of destroyed buildings, sappers were pumping air into collapsed basements and digging to free survivors, assisted by Italian prisoners—everyone nowadays just called them the Badoglios—with the letters KGF painted in red on their backs. The S-Bahn station in the Brückenallee lay in ruins; I lived a little farther, on Flensburgerstrasse; my building looked miraculously intact: a hundred and fifty meters farther, there was nothing but rubble and gaping façades. The elevator, of course, didn’t work, so I climbed the eight flights, passing my neighbors sweeping the stairway or nailing up their doors as best they could. I found mine torn from its hinges and lying sideways; inside, a thick layer of broken glass and plaster covered everything; there were traces of footsteps and my gramophone had disappeared, but nothing else seemed to have been taken. A cold, biting wind blew through the windows. I quickly filled a suitcase, then went downstairs to arrange with my neighbor, who came from time to time to do housework for me, to come and clean up; I gave her money to have the door repaired that day, and the windows as soon as possible; she promised to contact me at the SS-Haus when the apartment was more or less livable. I went out in search of a hotel: above all, I dreamed of a bath. The closest was the Eden Hotel, where I had already stayed for a time. I had luck, the entire Budapesterstrasse seemed razed, but the Eden was still open. The front desk was being taken by storm, rich people who had been left homeless, officers arguing over rooms. When I had mentioned my rank, my medals, my disability, and lied by exaggerating the state of my apartment, the manager, who had recognized me, agreed to give me a bed, provided I share the room. I held out a banknote to the floor waiter so he would bring hot water to my room: finally, around ten o’clock, I was able to run a bath, lukewarm but delectable. The water immediately turned black, but I didn’t care. I was still soaking when they let my roommate in. He excused himself politely through the closed bathroom door and told me he’d wait below until I was ready. As soon as I was dressed I went down to look for him: he was a Georgian aristocrat, very elegant, who had fled his burning hotel with his things and had ended up here."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 07:00"|"Around seven o’clock"|"My colleagues all had the idea to meet at the SS-Haus. I found Piontek there, imperturbable; Fräulein Praxa, prettily dressed, although her wardrobe had gone up in smoke; all cheerful because his neighborhood had been spared, Walser; and, a little shaken up, Isenbeck, whose old neighbor had died of a heart attack right next to him, during the alert, in the dark, without his noticing. Weinrowski had returned some time ago to Oranienburg. As for Asbach, he had sent word: his wife was wounded, he would come as soon as he could. I sent Piontek to tell him to take a few days if he needed to: there wasn’t much chance we could get back to work right away anyway. I sent Fräulein Praxa home, and in the company of Walser and Isenbeck went to the ministry to see what could still be saved. The fire had been contained, but the west wing was still closed; a fireman escorted us through the rubble. Most of the top floor had burned down, as well as the attic: in our offices, only one room, with a file cabinet that had survived the fire, remained, but it had been flooded by the firemen’s hoses. Through a section of collapsed wall you could see part of the ravaged Tiergarten; leaning out, I saw that the Lehrter Bahnhof had also suffered, but the thick smoke that weighed over the city prevented me from seeing farther; in the distance, though, the lines of burned avenues could still be made out. I undertook to move the surviving files with my colleagues, along with a typewriter and a telephone. It was a delicate task, since the fire had burned holes in the floor in places, and the hallways were obstructed with rubble that had to be cleared. When Piontek joined us, we filled the car and I sent him to take everything to the SS-Haus. There I was assigned a temporary storage closet, but nothing more; Brandt was still too overwhelmed to worry about me. Since I had nothing else to do, I dismissed Walser and Isenbeck and had Piontek drop me off at the Eden Hotel, after arranging with him to come pick me up the next morning: without a family, he could just as well sleep in the garage. I went down to the bar and ordered a Cognac. My roommate, the Georgian, wearing a fedora and a white scarf, was playing Mozart on the piano, with a remarkably precise touch. When he stopped, I offered him a drink and chatted a little with him. He was vaguely affiliated with one of those groups of émigrés who were always bustling about the dens of the Auswärtiges Amt and the SS; the name Misha Kedia, when he mentioned it, sounded vaguely familiar. When he learned that I had been in the Caucasus, he leapt up enthusiastically, ordered another round, gave a solemn and interminable toast (although I had never set foot on his side of the mountains), forced me to empty my glass in one swallow, and invited me on the spot to come stay in Tiflis after our forces had freed it, in his ancestral home. Little by little the bar filled up. Around seven o’clock, conversations trailed off, people began to eye the clock over the bar: ten minutes later the sirens started up, then the flak, violent and close. The manager had come to assure us that the bar also served as a shelter; all the hotel clients came downstairs, and soon there was no more room. The ambiance became cheerful and animated: as the first bombs got closer, the Georgian went back to the piano and dove into a jazz tune; women in evening gowns got up to dance, the walls and chandeliers trembled, glasses fell from the bar and shattered, you could scarcely hear the music beneath the explosions, the air pressure became unbearable, I drank, several women, hysterical, laughed, another tried to kiss me, then burst out sobbing. When it was over, the manager handed out a round on the house. I went out: the zoo had been hit, pavilions were burning, again you could see fires pretty much everywhere; I smoked a cigarette, regretting I hadn’t gone to see the animals while there was still time. A section of wall had collapsed; I walked over to it, men were running in every direction, some were carrying shotguns, there was talk of lions and tigers roaming free. Several firebombs had fallen, and beyond the avalanche of bricks, I saw the galleries burning; the large Indian temple had been gutted; inside, a man who was walking next to me explained, they had found the elephants’ corpses torn to pieces by the bombs, as well as a rhinoceros seemingly intact but also dead, maybe from fear. Behind me, most of the buildings on Budapesterstrasse were burning too. I went to lend a hand to the firemen; for hours I helped clear away the rubble; every five minutes a whistle blew, and work stopped so the rescuers could listen for the muffled sounds of trapped people; and we got some of them out alive, wounded or even unhurt. Around midnight I went back to the Eden; the façade was damaged, but the structure had escaped a direct hit; at the bar, the party was still going on. My new Georgian friend forced me to drink several glasses in a row; the uniform Thomas had lent me was covered in filth and soot, but that didn’t prevent women of the highest society from flirting with me; few of them, it seemed, wanted to spend the night alone. The Georgian did so well that I got completely drunk: the next morning, I woke up on my bed, without any memory of climbing up to my room, with my tunic and shirt removed, but not my boots. The Georgian was snoring in the next bed. I cleaned up as well as I could, put on one of my clean uniforms, and gave Thomas’s over to be washed; leaving my sleeping neighbor there, I downed a bad coffee, took an aspirin for my headache, and returned to the Prinz-Albrechtstrasse."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"The officers of the Reichsführung all looked a little wild: a number of them hadn’t slept all night; many had ended up homeless, and several had lost someone in their family. In the lobby and the stairways, inmates in striped uniforms, guarded by some Totenkopf-SS, were sweeping the floor, nailing up boards, repainting the walls. Brandt asked me to help some officers draw up an estimation of the damage for the Reichsführer, by contacting the municipal authorities. The work was simple enough: each of us chose a sector—victims, housing, government buildings, infrastructure, industry—and contacted the proper authorities to note down their figures. I was set up with an office that had a telephone and a directory; a few lines still worked, and I put Fräulein Praxa there—she had unearthed a new outfit somewhere—so she could call the hospitals. To get him out from underfoot, I decided to send Isenbeck, with the salvaged files, to join his boss Weinrowski in Oranienburg, and asked Piontek to drive him there. Walser hadn’t come. When Fräulein Praxa managed to reach a hospital, I asked for the number of dead and wounded they had received; when she had made a list of three or four institutions we couldn’t reach by phone, I sent a driver and an orderly to collect the data. Asbach arrived around noon, his features drawn, making a visible effort to look composed. I took him to the mess for sandwiches and tea. Slowly, between mouthfuls, he told me what had happened: The first night, the building where his wife had joined her mother had taken a direct hit and had collapsed onto the shelter, which had only partly held up. Asbach’s mother-in-law had apparently been killed immediately or had at least died quickly; his wife had been buried alive and they hadn’t been able to free her till the next morning, unhurt aside from a broken arm, but incoherent; she had had a miscarriage during the night, and still hadn’t recovered her wits; she went from a childlike babbling to hysterical tears. “I’m going to have to bury her mother without her,” Asbach said sadly as he sipped his tea. “I’d have liked to wait a little, for her to recover, but the morgues are overflowing and the medical authorities are afraid of epidemics. Apparently all the bodies that haven’t been reclaimed in twenty-four hours will be buried in mass graves. It’s terrible.” I tried my best to console him, but, I have to admit, I’m not very good at that sort of thing: my words about his future conjugal happiness must have sounded pretty hollow. Still it seemed to comfort him. I sent him home with a driver from the Reichsführung, promising I’d find him a van for the funeral the next day."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap ~ 06:00"|"Around six o’clock"|"The Tuesday raid, even though it had involved only half as many aircraft as Monday’s, promised to turn out to be even more disastrous. The working-class neighborhoods, especially Wedding, had been hit hard. By the end of the afternoon we had gathered enough information to form a brief report: we counted about 2,000 dead, with hundreds more beneath the rubble; 3,000 buildings burned or destroyed; and 175,000 people homeless, of whom 100,000 had already been able to leave the city, either for surrounding villages or other cities in Germany. Around six o’clock we dismissed all the people who weren’t doing essential work; I stayed a little longer, and was still on the road, with a driver from the garage, when the sirens began to wail again. I decided not to continue on to the Eden: the bar-shelter didn’t inspire much confidence in me, and I preferred to avoid a repetition of the drinking bout of the night before. I ordered the driver to go around the zoo to reach the large bunker. A crowd was pressed at the doors, which were too narrow and too few; cars came and parked at the foot of the concrete façade; in front of them, in a reserved area, dozens of baby carriages stretched out in concentric circles. Inside, soldiers and policemen barked out orders for people to move upstairs; at each floor a crowd formed, no one wanted to go higher up, women were screaming, while their children ran through the crowd playing war games. We were directed to the third floor, but the benches, lined up as in a church, were already crowded, and I went to lean against the concrete wall. My driver had disappeared in the crowd. Soon afterward the .88s on the roof opened fire: the entire immense structure vibrated, pitching like a ship on the high seas. People, thrown against their neighbors, shouted or groaned. The lights dimmed but didn’t go out. In recesses and in the darkness of the spiral staircases leading from floor to floor, teenage couples clung to each other, intertwined; some even seemed to be making love—you could hear through the explosions moans of a different tone from those of panic-stricken housewives; old people protested indignantly, the Schupos bellowed, ordering people to remain seated. I wanted to smoke but it was forbidden. I looked at the woman sitting on the bench in front of me: she kept her head lowered, I could just see her blond, exceptionally thick, shoulder-length hair. A bomb exploded nearby, making the bunker tremble and throwing up a cloud of concrete dust. The young woman raised her head and I recognized her right away: she was the one I met sometimes in the morning, on the trolley. She too recognized me and a gentle smile lit up her face while she held out her white hand to me: “Hello! I was worried about you.”—“Why?” With the flak and the explosions we could barely hear each other, I crouched down and bent toward her. “You weren’t at the pool Sunday,” she said into my ear. “I was afraid something had happened to you.” Sunday was already another life, it seemed to me; but it was only three days ago. “I was in the country. Does the pool still exist?” She smiled again: “I don’t know.” Another powerful explosion shook the structure and she seized my hand and grasped it strongly; when it was over she let it go, excusing herself. Despite the yellowish light and the dust, I had the impression she was blushing slightly. “Forgive me,” I asked her, “what is your name?”—“Helene,” she replied. “Helene Anders.” I introduced myself. She worked at the press agency of the Auswärtiges Amt; her office, like most of the ministry, had been destroyed Monday night, but her parents’ house, in Alt Moabit, where she lived, was still standing. “Before this raid, in any case. And you?” I laughed: “I had offices at the Ministry of the Interior, but they burned down. For now, I’m at the SS-Haus.” We continued chatting till the end of the alert. She had gone on foot to Charlottenburg to comfort a homeless girlfriend; the sirens had caught her on the way back, and she had taken refuge there, in the bunker. “I didn’t think they’d come back a third night in a row,” she said softly.—“To tell the truth, I didn’t either,” I replied, “but I’m happy it’s given us the chance to see each other again.” I said that to be polite; but I realized it wasn’t just to be polite. This time, she blushed visibly; her tone still remained frank and clear: “Me too. Our trolley will probably be out of service for a while.” When the lights came back on, she got up and brushed off her coat. “If you like,” I said, “I can take you home. If I still have a car,” I added, laughing. “Don’t say no. It’s not very far away.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"The next day, Thursday, I continued collecting statistics for Brandt. Walser still hadn’t reappeared but I wasn’t too worried. To make up for the lack of telephone lines, we now had a squad of Hitlerjugend on loan from Goebbels. We sent them all over, on bikes or on foot, to send or get messages and mail. In town, the hard work of the municipal services was already yielding results: in some neighborhoods, water had come back, electricity too, sections of the trolley lines were put back in service, along with the U-Bahn and S-Bahn, where it was possible. We also knew that Goebbels was contemplating a partial evacuation of the city. Everywhere, on the ruins, chalk messages were proliferating, people trying to find their parents, their friends, their neighbors. Around noon, I requisitioned a small van from the police and went to help Asbach bury his mother-in-law in the Plötzensee cemetery, alongside her husband who had died of cancer four years earlier. Asbach seemed a little better: his wife was recovering her senses, she had recognized him; but he hadn’t told her anything yet, either about her mother or about the baby. Fräulein Praxa accompanied us and even managed to find flowers; Asbach was visibly touched. Aside from us there were only three of his friends, including a couple, and a minister. The coffin was made of coarse, badly planed boards; Asbach kept saying that as soon as possible he would ask for a permit to exhume the body to give his mother-in-law a proper funeral: they had never gotten along well, he added, she hadn’t hidden her scorn for his SS uniform, but still, she was his wife’s mother, and Asbach loved his wife. I didn’t envy his situation: to be alone in the world is sometimes a great advantage, especially in wartime. I dropped him off at the military hospital where his wife was, and went back to the SS-Haus. That night, there was no raid; an alert went off in the early evening, provoking an outburst of panic, but they were just reconnaissance planes, come to photograph the damage. After the alert, which I spent in the Staatspolizei bunker, Thomas took me to a little restaurant that had already reopened its doors. He was in a cheerful mood: Schellenberg had arranged to have a small house in Dahlem lent to him, in a fashionable neighborhood near the Grunewald, and he was going to buy a small Mercedes convertible from a widow who needed money; her husband, a Hauptsturmführer, had been killed during the first raid. “Fortunately, my bank is intact. That’s what counts.” I made a face: “Still, there are other things that count.”—“Like what, for example?”—“Our sacrifices. The suffering of the people, here, around us, on the front.” In Russia things were going very badly: after losing Kiev, we had managed to retake Zhitomir, only to lose Cherkassy the day I was hunting grouse with Speer; in Rovno, the Ukrainian insurgents of the UPA, as anti-German as they were anti-Bolshevik, were picking off isolated German soldiers like rabbits. “I’ve always said, Max,” Thomas said, “you take things too seriously.”—“It’s a question of Weltanschauung,” I said, raising my glass. Thomas gave a brief, mocking laugh. “Weltanschauung here, Weltanschauung there, as Schnitzler said. Everyone has a Weltanschauung these days, the lowliest baker or plumber has his Weltanschauung, my mechanic overcharges me thirty percent for repairs, but he too has his Weltanschauung. I have one too…” He fell silent and drank; I drank too. It was a Bulgarian wine, a little rough, but given the circumstances there was nothing to complain about. “I’m going to tell you what counts,” Thomas said urgently. “Serve your country, die if you have to, but take advantage of life as much as possible in the meantime. Your posthumous Ritterkreuz might console your old mother, but it’ll be cold comfort for you.”—“My mother is dead,” I said softly.—“I know. I’m sorry.” One night, after many drinks, I had told him about my mother’s death, without going into too much detail; since then we hadn’t talked about it again. Thomas drank some more, then burst out: “Do you know why we hate the Jews? I’ll tell you. We hate the Jews because they’re a thrifty, prudent people, greedy not just for money and security but also for their traditions, their knowledge, and their books, incapable of giving and spending, a people that doesn’t know war. A people that just knows how to accumulate, never to waste. In Kiev you said the murder of the Jews was a waste. Well, precisely, by wasting their lives the way you throw rice at a wedding, we’ve taught them expense, we’ve taught them war. And the proof that it’s working, that the Jews are beginning to learn the lesson, is Warsaw, Treblinka, Sobibor, Bialystok, it’s the Jews who are becoming warriors again, who are becoming cruel, who also are becoming killers. I find that very beautiful. We’ve made them into an enemy worthy of us. The Pour la Semite”—he struck his chest at the heart, where the Jews sew the star—“is picking up value again. And if the Germans don’t pull themselves together like the Jews, instead of moaning, they’ll just get what they deserve. Vae victis.” He emptied his glass in one swallow, his gaze distant. I realized he was drunk. “I’m going home,” he said. I offered to drive him back, but he refused: he had taken a car from the garage. In the still-half-cleared street, he absentmindedly shook my hand, slammed the door, and shot off. I went back to sleep at the Staatspolizei; it was heated, and the showers, at least, had been fixed."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 12:00"|"around noon"|"A new thought, though, came more and more often to occupy my mind. The Sunday after the air raids, around noon, I had taken the car from the garage and had gone to visit Helene Anders. The day was cold and wet, the sky overcast, but it wasn’t raining. On the way, I had managed to find a bouquet of flowers, sold in the street by an old woman near an S-Bahn station. Having reached Helene’s building, I realized I didn’t know what apartment she lived in. Her name wasn’t on the letter boxes. A rather hefty woman who was leaving at that moment stopped and eyed me from head to foot before barking at me, in strong Berlin slang: “Who are you looking for?”—“Fräulein Anders.”—“Anders? There’s no Anders here.” I described her. “You mean the Winnefeld daughter. But she’s not a Fräulein.” She directed me to the apartment and I went up to ring. A lady with white hair opened the door and frowned. “Frau Winnefeld?”—“Yes.” I clicked my heels and bowed my head. “My respects, meine Dame. I came to see your daughter.” I held out the flowers and introduced myself. Helene appeared in the hallway, a sweater over her shoulders, and her face colored slightly: “Oh!” she smiled. “It’s you.”—“I came to ask you if you were planning to swim today.”—“Is the pool still working?” she said.—“Unfortunately not.” I had passed it on my way: a firebomb had gone through the dome, and the concierge who was watching over the ruins had assured me that, given the priorities, it certainly wouldn’t reopen before the end of the war. “But I know of another one.”—“Then I’d be happy to. I’ll go get my things.” Downstairs, I helped her into the car and set off. “I didn’t know you were a Frau,” I said after a few minutes. She looked at me pensively: “I’m a widow. My husband was killed in Yugoslavia last year, by the partisans. We’d been married for less than a year.”—“I’m sorry.” She looked out the window. “Me too,” she said. She turned to me: “But life goes on, doesn’t it?” I didn’t say anything. “Hans, my husband,” she went on, “liked the Dalmatian coast a lot. In his letters, he talked about settling there after the war. Do you know Dalmatia?”—“No. I served in the Ukraine and in Russia. But I wouldn’t want to settle there.”—“Where would you like to live?”—“I don’t know, actually. Not Berlin, I think. I don’t know.” I told her briefly about my childhood in France. She herself was of old Berlin stock: already her grandparents lived in Moabit. We arrived at the Prinz-Albrechtstrasse and I parked in front of number eight. “But that’s the Gestapo!” she cried out, terrified. I laughed: “That’s right. They have a small heated pool in the basement.” She stared at me: “Are you a policeman?”—“Not at all.” Through the window, I pointed to the former Prinz-Albrecht Hotel next door: “I work there, in the Reichsführer’s offices. I’m a legal advisor, I’m in charge of economic questions.” That seemed to reassure her. “Don’t worry. The pool is used more by typists and secretaries than by policemen, who have other things to do.” In fact, the pool was so small you had to sign up in advance. We found Thomas there, already in a bathing suit. “Oh, I know you!” he exclaimed, gallantly kissing Helene’s white hand. “You’re the friend of Liselotte and Mina Wehde.” I showed her where the women’s changing rooms were and went to change also, while Thomas smiled at me mockingly. When I emerged, Thomas, in the water, was talking with a girl, but Helene hadn’t reappeared yet. I dove in and did a few laps. Helene came out of the changing room. Her fashionable swimsuit molded to her contours, rounded but slim; beneath the curves the muscles were clearly apparent. Her face, whose beauty wasn’t altered by the swimming cap, was joyful: “Hot showers! What luxury!” She dove in, crossed half the pool underwater, and began doing laps. I was already tired; I got out, put on a bathrobe, and sat down on one of the chairs placed around the pool, to smoke and watch her swim. Thomas, dripping, came to sit next to me: “It was high time you pulled yourself together.”—“Do you like her?” The lapping of the water resounded on the room’s vaulted ceiling. Helene did forty laps without stopping, a thousand meters. Then she came over to lean on the edge, like the first time I’d seen her, and smiled at me: “You don’t swim much.”—“It’s the cigarettes. I get out of breath.”—“That’s too bad.” Again, she raised her arms and let herself sink down; but this time she came back up in the same place and hoisted herself out of the pool in one supple movement. She took a towel, dried her face and came to sit down next to us, taking off her cap and shaking her damp hair. “And you,” she said to Thomas, “do you also deal with economic questions?”—“No,” he replied. “I leave that to Max. He’s much more intelligent than me.”—“He’s a policeman,” I added. Thomas made a face: “Let’s say I’m in security.”—“Brrr…” Helene said. “That must be sinister.”—“Oh, not really.” I finished my cigarette and went back in to swim a little. Helene did twenty more laps; Thomas was flirting with one of the typists. Afterward, I washed under the shower and changed; leaving Thomas there, I suggested to Helene that we go out for some tea. “Where?”—“Good question. On Unter den Linden there’s nothing left. But we’ll find something.” Finally I took her to the Esplanade Hotel, on Bellevuestrasse: it was a little damaged, but had survived the worst; inside the tea room, aside from the boards on the windows, masked by brocade curtains, you might have thought it was before the war. “What a beautiful place,” Helene murmured. “I’ve never been here.”—“The cakes are excellent, I hear. And they don’t serve ersatz.” I ordered a coffee for me and a tea for her; we also ordered a little assortment of cakes. They were in fact delicious. When I lit a cigarette, she asked for one. “You smoke?”—“Sometimes.” Later on, she said pensively: “It’s too bad there’s this war. Things could have been so nice.”—“Maybe. I have to admit I don’t think about it.” She looked at me: “Tell me frankly: we’re going to lose, aren’t we?”—“No!” I said, shocked. “Of course not.” Again, she looked into emptiness and drew a last puff from her cigarette. “We’re going to lose,” she said. I took her home. In front of the entrance, she shook my hand, looking serious. “Thank you,” she said. “I enjoyed that very much.”—“I hope it won’t be the last time.”—“Me too. See you soon.” I watched her cross the sidewalk and disappear into the building. Then I went back to my place to listen to Monteverdi."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
00:00|midnight|"It had begun to snow, a warm snow that didn’t stick. Then finally it lasted for a night or two, and gave a brief, strange beauty to the ruins of the city, before it melted and thickened the muck disfiguring the broken streets. With my tall riding boots, I walked through it without paying any attention—an orderly would clean them for me the next day—but Helene wore simple shoes, and when we reached a gray stretch thick with melted snow, I would look for a board I could throw over it, then hold her delicate hand so she could cross; and if even that was impossible, I carried her, light in my arms. On Christmas Eve, Thomas organized a small party in his new house in Dahlem, a luxurious little villa: as usual, he knew how to get by. Schellenberg was there with his wife, along with several other officers; I had invited Hohenegg, but hadn’t been able to locate Osnabrugge, who must have been in Poland still. Thomas seemed to have had his way with Liselotte, Helene’s friend: when she arrived, she kissed him passionately. Helene had put on a new dress, God knows where she had found the cloth, the restrictions were becoming more and more severe, she smiled charmingly and seemed happy. All the men, for once, were in civilian clothes. We had scarcely arrived when the sirens began wailing. Thomas reassured us by explaining that the planes coming from Italy almost never dropped their first bombs before Schöneberg and Tempelhof, and the ones from England passed north of Dahlem. Still, we dimmed the lights; thick black curtains masked the windows. The flak began to boom, Thomas put on a record, furious American jazz, and led Liselotte in a dance. Helene drank white wine and watched them dance; afterward, Thomas put on some slow music and she asked me to dance with her. Above we could hear the squadrons roaring; the flak barked without stopping, the windows trembled, we could scarcely hear the record; but Helene danced as if we were alone in a ballroom, leaning lightly on me, her hand firm in mine. Then she danced with Thomas while I exchanged a toast with Hohenegg. Thomas was right: to the north, we could sense more than hear an immense muffled vibration, but around us nothing fell. I looked at Schellenberg; he had gained weight, his successes didn’t encourage moderation. He was talking pleasantly with his specialists on our setbacks in Italy. Schellenberg, I had finally gathered from the few remarks Thomas sometimes let escape, thought he held the key to Germany’s future; he was convinced that if people listened to him, to him and his indisputable analyses, there would still be time to salvage something from the situation. The mere fact that he talked about salvaging something was enough to make my hackles rise: but apparently he had the Reichsführer’s ear, and I wondered where he might have gotten with his schemes. Once the alert was over, Thomas tried to call the RSHA, but the lines were cut off. “Those bastards did it on purpose to ruin our Christmas,” he said to me. “But we won’t let them.” I looked at Helene: she was sitting next to Liselotte and talking animatedly. “She’s very nice, that girl,” declared Thomas, who had followed my gaze. “Why don’t you marry her?” I smiled: “Thomas, mind your own business.” He shrugged: “At least spread the rumor that you’re engaged. That way Brandt will get off your back.” I had told him about Brandt’s comments. “And you?” I retorted. “You’re a year older than I am. Don’t they bother you?” He laughed: “Me? It’s not the same thing. First of all, my congenital inability to stay more than a month with the same girl is well known. But above all”—he lowered his voice—“keep it to yourself, but I’ve already sent two of them to the Lebensborn. I hear the Reichsführer was delighted.” He went to put another jazz record on; I figured he must help himself from the Gestapo’s stocks of confiscated records. I followed him and asked Helene to dance again. At midnight, Thomas put out all the lights. I heard a girl’s joyful shout, a muffled laugh. Helene was next to me: for a brief instant, I felt her sweet, warm breath on my face, and her lips grazed mine. My heart was pounding. When the light returned, she said to me in a composed, calm way: “I have to go home. I didn’t tell my parents, with the alert they must be worried.” I had taken Piontek’s car. We drove up toward the center of town by the Kurfürstendamm; on our right, fires lit by the bombing were roaring. It had started to snow. Some bombs had fallen on the Tiergarten and on Moabit, but the damage seemed minor compared to the big raids of the previous month. In front of her building, she took my hand and briefly kissed my cheek: “Merry Christmas! See you soon.” I went back to get drunk in Dahlem, and ended the night on the carpet, having ceded the sofa to a secretary upset at having been ousted from the host’s bedroom by Liselotte."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"< 00:00"|"A little before midnight"|"Three days before New Year’s Day there was a heavy snow, and this time the snow stuck. Inspired by his Christmas party success, Thomas decided to re-invite everyone: “Might as well take advantage of this shack before it burns down too.” I asked Helene to tell her parents she’d come home late, and it was a really wonderful party. A little before midnight, the whole gang armed itself with Champagne and baskets of Dutch oysters and set out on foot for the Grunewald. Beneath the trees, the snow lay virgin and pure; the sky was clear, lit by an almost full moon, which shed a bluish light on the white expanses. In a clearing, Thomas cracked open the Champagne—he had supplied himself with a real cavalry saber, taken down from the wall of our weapons hall—and the less clumsy ones struggled to open the oysters, a delicate and dangerous art for those who don’t have the knack. At midnight, instead of fireworks, the Luftwaffe artillerymen lit their searchlights, launched flares, and shot off some .88-millimeter rounds. This time, Helene kissed me outright, not for long, but a strong, happy kiss that sent a rush of fear and pleasure through my limbs. Surprising, I said to myself as I drank to hide my confusion, I who thought no sensation was foreign to me, now a woman’s kiss overwhelms me. The others were laughing, throwing snowballs at each other and swallowing oysters from the shell. Hohenegg, who kept a moth-eaten shapka planted on his bald, oval head, had turned out to be the most skillful of the shuckers: “That or a thorax, they’re pretty much the same thing,” he laughed. Schellenberg had gashed the entire base of his thumb, and was bleeding quietly onto the snow, drinking Champagne, without anyone thinking to bandage it. Seized with happiness, I began running around and throwing snowballs too; the more we drank, the more frenzied the game became—we tackled one another by the legs, as in rugby, rammed fistfuls of snow down each other’s necks, our coats were soaking, but we didn’t feel the cold. I pushed Helene into the powdery snow, stumbled, and collapsed next to her; lying on her back, her arms stretched out in the snow, she laughed; when she fell, her long skirt had ridden up, and without thinking, I rested my hand on her bare knee, protected only by a stocking. She turned her head to me and looked at me, still laughing. Then I removed my hand and helped her get up. We didn’t go back until after we’d emptied the last bottle; we had to hold back Schellenberg, who wanted to shoot at the empties; walking in the snow, Helene held my arm. In the house, Thomas gallantly gave up his bedroom as well as the guest room to the tired girls, who fell asleep still dressed, three to a bed. I ended the night playing chess and discussing Augustine’s Trinity with Hohenegg, who had dunked his head in cold water and was drinking tea.

"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"The following week, I put together a small team for the Einsatz in Hungary. I appointed a specialist, Obersturmführer Elias; a few clerks, orderlies, and administrative assistants; and of course Piontek. I left my office under Asbach’s responsibility, with precise instructions. On Brandt’s orders, on March 17, I set out for the KL Mauthausen, where a Sondereinsatzgruppe of the SP and the SD was assembling, under the command of Oberführer Dr. Achamer-Pifrader, the former BdS of the Ostland. Eichmann was already there, at the head of his own Sondereinsatzkommando. I presented myself to Oberführer Dr. Geschke, the officer in charge, who set me up with my team in a barracks. I already knew when I left Berlin that the Hungarian leader, Horthy, was meeting the Führer at Klessheim Palace, near Salzburg. Since the war, the events at Klessheim are well known: confronted with Hitler and von Ribbentrop, who bluntly gave him the choice between the formation of a new pro-German government or the invasion of his country, Horthy—admiral in a country without a navy, regent of a kingdom without a king—decided, after a brief heart attack, to avoid the worst. At the time, though, we knew nothing of that: Geschke and Achamer-Pifrader contented themselves with summoning the superior officers on the night of the eighteenth, to inform us that we were leaving the next day for Budapest. Rumors, of course, were flying; many people expected Hungarian resistance at the border, they had us put on our field uniforms and they handed out submachine guns. The camp was simmering with excitement: for many of these functionaries of the Staatspolizei or the SD, it was their first experience of the field; and even I, after almost a year in Berlin, and the dullness of bureaucratic routine, the permanent tension of underhand intrigues, the fatigue of bombings you had to undergo without reacting, I let myself be caught up in the general exhilaration. That evening, I went to have a few drinks with Eichmann, whom I found surrounded by his officers, beaming and strutting about in a new field gray uniform, tailored as elegantly as a parade uniform. I knew only a few of his colleagues; he explained to me that for this operation he had sent for his best specialists from all over Europe, from Italy, Croatia, Litzmannstadt, Theresienstadt. He introduced me to his friend Hauptsturmführer Wisliceny (the godfather of his son Dieter), a frightfully fat, placid, serene man, who had come from Slovakia. The mood was cheerful, there wasn’t much drinking; everyone was champing at the bit. I went back to my barracks to sleep a little, since we were leaving around midnight, but I had trouble getting to sleep. I thought about Helene: I had left her two days earlier, telling her I didn’t know when I’d return to Berlin; I had been somewhat abrupt, giving few explanations and not making any promises; she had accepted it gently, gravely, without any obvious anxiety, and yet, it was clear I think to both of us, a connection had been formed, tenuous perhaps, but solid, which wouldn’t dissolve by itself; it was already a relation, in some way."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"I must have dozed off a little: Piontek shook me awake around midnight. I had lain down fully dressed, with my kit ready; I went out to take the air while they checked the vehicles. I ate a sandwich and drank some coffee that Fischer, an orderly, had brewed for me. It was late winter, bitter cold out, and I gladly inhaled the pure mountain air. A little farther on, I heard the sound of engines: the Vorkommando, led by a deputy of Eichmann’s, was starting out. I had decided to join the convoy of the Sondereinsatzkommando, which included, aside from Eichmann and his officers, more than 150 men, most of them Orpos and representatives of the SD and the SP, as well as some Waffen-SS. Geschke’s and Achamer-Pifrader’s convoy brought up the rear. When our two cars were ready, I sent them to join the staging area and went on foot to find Eichmann. He was wearing a tank soldier’s goggles on his cap and was holding a Steyr machine pistol under his arm: with his riding breeches, it made him look a little ridiculous, almost as if he were wearing a disguise. “Obersturmbannführer,” he cried out when he saw me. “Your men are ready?” I signed yes and went to join them. At the assembly area, it was still that last-minute confusion, the shouts and commands before a mass of vehicles can get under way in good order. Eichmann finally made his appearance, surrounded by many of his officers, including Regierungsrat Hunsche, whom I knew from Berlin; after having given some more contradictory orders, he got into his Schwimmwagen, a kind of amphibious all-terrain vehicle, driven by a Waffen-SS; I wondered amusedly if he was afraid the bridges would be dynamited, if he planned on crossing the Danube in his tub, with his Steyr and his chauffeur, to sweep away the Magyar hordes on his own. Piontek, at the steering wheel of my car, exuded sobriety and seriousness. Finally, under the harsh light of the camp searchlights, in a thunder of engines and a cloud of dust, the column set off. I had put Elias and Fischer in the back, with the weapons they had distributed to us; I sat in front, next to Piontek, and he started up. The sky was clear, the stars shining, but there was no moon; going down the winding road toward the Danube, I clearly saw the gleaming expanse of the river at my feet. The convoy crossed over to the right bank and headed toward Vienna. We drove in single file, our headlights kept low because of enemy fighter planes. I soon fell asleep. From time to time an alert woke me up, forced the vehicles to stop and douse the headlights, but no one left the car, we waited in the dark. There was no attack. In my interrupted half-sleep I had strange dreams, vivid and evanescent, which disappeared like a soap bubble as soon as a jolt or a siren woke me up. Around three o’clock, as we were skirting Vienna from the south, I shook myself awake and drank some coffee from a thermos readied by Fischer. The moon had risen, a thin crescent that made the wide water of the Danube gleam whenever we glimpsed it on our left. The alerts forced us to pause again, a long line of disparate vehicles that we could now distinguish in the moonlight. To the east, the sky was turning pink, outlining, higher up, the summits of the Little Carpathians. One of these pauses found us above the Neusiedler See, just a few kilometers from the Hungarian border. The fat Wisliceny passed by my car and rapped on my window: “Take your rum and come with us.” They had delivered a few measures of rum to us for the march, but I hadn’t touched it. I followed Wisliceny, who was going from car to car, getting other officers to come out. In front of us, the red ball of the sun weighed on the summits, the sky was pale, a luminous blue tinged with yellow, without a cloud. When our group reached Eichmann’s Schwimmwagen, near the head of the column, we surrounded it and Wisliceny asked him to get out. He had brought along the officers from IV B 4, as well as the commanders of the seconded companies. Wisliceny raised his flask, congratulated Eichmann, and drank his health: Eichmann was celebrating his thirty-eighth birthday that day. He hiccupped with pleasure: “Meine Herren, I am touched, very touched. Today is my seventh birthday as an SS officer. I can’t imagine a better gift than your company.” He was beaming, all red, smiling at everyone, drinking in little sips to the cheers."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"In the evening, she came to give me a shot. I turned over onto my stomach with difficulty; when I pushed down my pants, the memory of certain vigorous adolescents shot briefly through my head, then crumpled, I was too tired. She hesitated, she had never given a shot before, but when she stuck the needle in, it was with a firm, sure hand. She had a little cotton soaked in alcohol and she wiped my buttocks after the injection, I found that touching, she must have remembered nurses doing that. Lying on my side, I planted the thermometer into my rectum myself to take my temperature, without paying attention to her but without trying especially to provoke her either. I must have had a little over forty degrees. Then the night began again, the third of that stone eternity, I wandered again through the underbrush and the collapsed cliffs of my thoughts. In the middle of the night, I began sweating profusely, the soaking pajamas stuck to my skin, I was barely conscious, I remember Helene’s hand on my forehead and cheek, pushing back my soaking hair, brushing against my beard, she told me later that I had begun talking out loud, it drew her out of her sleep and brought her to my side, scraps of phrases, mostly incoherent, she said, but she never wanted to tell me what she had understood. I didn’t insist, I felt it was better that way. The next morning, the fever had fallen below thirty-nine. When Piontek came to ask about me, I sent him to the office to get some real coffee, which I kept in reserve, for Helene. The doctor, when he came to examine me, congratulated me: “You’ve come through the worst, I think. But it’s not over yet and you should regain your strength.” I felt like the victim of a shipwreck who, after a fierce, exhausting battle with the sea, finally lets himself roll onto the sand of a beach: maybe I wasn’t going to die after all. But that’s a bad comparison, for a shipwrecked person swims, fights to survive, and I hadn’t done anything, I had let myself be carried along and it was only death that hadn’t wanted me. I greedily drank the orange juice Helene brought me. Around noon, I sat up a little: Helene was standing in the open doorway between my bedroom and the living room, leaning on the doorframe, a summer pullover on her shoulders; she was looking at me absentmindedly, a steaming cup of coffee in her hand. “I envy you, being able to drink coffee,” I said.—“Oh! Wait, I’ll help you.”—“That’s all right.” I was more or less sitting up, I had managed to pull a pillow behind my back. “Please forgive me for what I said yesterday. I was despicable.” She made a little sign with her head, drank some coffee, and turned her face aside, toward the French window to the balcony. After a little while, she looked at me again: “What you said…about the dead. Was that true?”—“You really want to know?”—“Yes.” Her beautiful eyes were examining me, I seemed to glimpse a worried glint in them, but she remained calm, in control of herself. “Everything I said is true.”—“The women, the children too?”—“Yes.” She turned her head away, bit her upper lip; when she looked at me again, her eyes were full of tears: “It’s sad,” she said.—“Yes. It’s horribly sad.” She thought before she spoke again: “You know we are going to pay for that.”—“Yes. If we lose the war, our enemies’ revenge will be pitiless.”—“I wasn’t talking about that. Even if we don’t lose the war, we are going to pay. We will have to pay.” She hesitated again. “I pity you,” she concluded. She didn’t speak of it again, she continued her ministrations, even the most humiliating ones. But her gestures seemed to have another quality—colder, more functional. As soon as I could walk, I asked her to go home. She protested a little, but I insisted: “You must be exhausted. Go get some rest. Frau Zempke can take care of what I need.” Finally she agreed and put her things into her little suitcase. I called Piontek to take her home. “I’ll phone you,” I said to her. When Piontek arrived, I accompanied her to the apartment door. “Thank you for taking care of me,” I said, shaking her hand. She nodded but didn’t say anything. “See you later,” I added coldly."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"My legal case continued its course; Judge von Rabingen regularly summoned me to clear up one point or another. From time to time I saw Mihaï; as for Helene, she seemed to be growing increasingly transparent, not from fear, but from pent-up emotion. When, back from Hungary, I told her about the atrocities of Nyíregyháza (the Third Armored Corps had retaken the city from the Russians at the end of October, and had found women of all ages raped, parents nailed alive to doors in front of their mutilated children; and these had been Hungarians, not Germans), she looked at me for a long time, then said gently: “And in Russia, was it very different?” I didn’t say anything. I looked at the extraordinarily thin wrists her sleeves revealed; I could easily have looped my thumb and index finger around them. “I know their revenge will be terrible,” she said then. “But we’ll have deserved it.” In the beginning of November, my apartment, miraculously preserved till then, disappeared in a bombing: a bomb came through the roof and took the top two floors with it; poor Herr Zempke succumbed to a heart attack as he left the half-collapsed cellar. Fortunately, I had gotten into the habit of keeping some of my clothes and my underwear at the office. Mihaï suggested I move to his apartment; I preferred to go to Wannsee, to Thomas’s place, where he had moved after his Dahlem house burned down in May. He led a wild life there, there were always a few fire-brands from the Amt VI around, one or two of Thomas’s colleagues, Schellenberg, and of course girls. Schellenberg often talked in private with Thomas but obviously mistrusted me. One day I came home a little early and heard an animated discussion in the living room, loud voices, Schellenberg’s mocking, insistent intonation: “If that Bernadotte agrees…” He interrupted himself as soon as he saw me on the doorstep and greeted me in a pleasant tone: “Aue, nice to see you.” But he didn’t continue his conversation with Thomas. When I wearied of my friend’s parties, I sometimes let myself be taken around by Mihaï. He often attended the daily farewell parties of Dr. Kosak, the Croatian ambassador, which took place either at the legation or in his villa in Dahlem; the upper crust of the diplomatic corps and the Auswärtiges Amt went there to stuff themselves, get drunk, and meet the prettiest UFA starlets, Maria Milde, Ilse Werner, Marikka Rökk. Around midnight, a choir sang traditional Dalmatian songs; after the usual Mosquito raid, the artillerymen from the Croatian flak battery stationed next door came to drink and play jazz till dawn; among them was an officer who had escaped from Stalingrad, but I took care not to tell him I had been there too, he would never have left me alone. These bacchanales sometimes degenerated into orgies, couples intertwined in the alcoves of the legation and frustrated idiots went out to empty their pistols in the garden: one night, drunk, I made love with Mihaï in the bedroom of the ambassador, who was snoring downstairs on a sofa; then, overexcited, Mihaï came back up with a little actress and took her in front of me as I finished a bottle of slivovitz and meditated on the servitudes of the flesh. This vain, frenetic gaiety couldn’t last. At the end of December, as the Russians were attacking Budapest and our last offensive was getting bogged down in the Ardennes, the Reichsführer sent me to inspect the evacuation of Auschwitz."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 02:00"|"around 2:00 a.m."|"That night, the camp SS men slept little. From the Haus, near the train station, I watched pass by the long columns of German civilians fleeing the Russians; after crossing the city and the bridge over the Sola, they poured into the station, or else laboriously continued westward on foot. SS men were guarding a special train reserved for the families of the camp personnel; it was already packed, husbands were trying to heap bundles in next to their wives and children. After dinner, I went to inspect the Stammlager and Birkenau. I visited some of the barracks: the inmates were trying to sleep, the kapos told me that no additional clothes had been handed out, but I still hoped it would happen the next day, before they left. In the lanes, piles of documents were burning: the incinerators were overflowing. In Birkenau, I noticed a big commotion near the Kanada: under the glare of spotlights, inmates were loading all sorts of merchandise onto trucks; an Untersturmführer supervising the operation assured me they were being directed toward the KL Gross-Rosen. But I could see that the SS guards were also helping themselves, sometimes openly. Everyone was shouting, running about frantically, uselessly, and I felt that panic was overtaking these men, that all sense of moderation and discipline was escaping them. As always, they had waited till the last minute to do everything, for acting earlier would have been showing defeatism; now, the Russians were upon us, the Auschwitz guards remembered the fate of the SS captured in the Lublin camp, they were losing all notion of priorities and sought only one thing, to escape. Depressed, I went to see Drescher in his office at the Stammlager. He too was burning his documents. “Have you seen how they’re looting?” he said to me, laughing into his goatee. From a drawer, he took out a bottle of expensive Armagnac: “What do you think of this? An Untersturmführer I’ve been investigating for four months but haven’t managed to nab offered this to me as a goodbye present, the bastard. He stole it, of course. Will you have a drink with me?” He poured two measures into water glasses: “Sorry, I don’t have anything better.” He raised his glass and I imitated him. “Go on,” he said, “make a toast.” But nothing came to mind. He shrugged: “Me neither. Let’s drink, then.” The Armagnac was exquisite, a light, sweet, burned sensation. “Where are you going?” I asked him.—“To Oranienburg, to make my report. I have enough already to prosecute eleven more men. Afterward, they can send me wherever they like.” As I was getting ready to leave, he handed me the bottle: “Here, keep it. You’ll need it more than I.” I put it into my coat pocket, shook his hand, and left. I went to the HKB, where Wirths was supervising the evacuation of the medical material. I spoke to him about the problem of warm clothes. “The warehouses are full,” he assured me. “It shouldn’t be too difficult to have blankets, boots, coats distributed.” But Bär, whom I found around 2:00 a.m. at the Kommandantur in Birkenau in the process of planning the order of departure for the columns, didn’t seem to be of that opinion. “The goods stored are the property of the Reich. I have no orders to distribute them to the inmates. They’ll be evacuated by truck or by train, when possible.” Outside, it must have been ten degrees below zero, the lanes were frozen over, slippery. “Dressed like that, your inmates won’t survive. Many of them are almost barefoot.”—“The ones who are fit will survive,” he asserted. “The others, we don’t need.” More and more furious, I went down to the communications center and got in contact with Breslau; but Schmauser wasn’t reachable, nor was Boesenberg. An operator showed me a telegram from the Wehrmacht: Tschenstochau had just fallen, the Russian troops were at the gates of Cracow. “It’s getting hot,” he said laconically. I thought of sending a telex to the Reichsführer, but that wouldn’t do any good; better to find Schmauser the next day, with the hope he’d have more common sense than that fool Bär. Suddenly tired, I went back to the Haus to go to bed. The columns of civilians, mixed with soldiers from the Wehrmacht, were still flowing in, exhausted peasants all bundled up, their things piled up on a cart with their children, pushing their livestock in front of them."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"ap 08:00"|"eight o’clock"|"Piontek didn’t wake me, and I slept until eight o’clock. The kitchen was still working and I had an omelette with sausage. Then I went out. At the Stammlager and in Birkenau, the columns were pouring out of the camp. The Häftlinge, their feet wrapped in whatever they’d been able to find, were walking slowly, at a shuffling pace, surrounded by SS guards and led by well-fed, warmly dressed kapos. All those who had one had taken their blanket, which they generally wore draped over their heads, a little like Bedouins; but that was all. When I asked, I was told they had received a piece of sausage and bread for three days; no one had received any orders about clothes."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
12:00|midday|"The first day, though, despite the ice and the wet snow, it still seemed to be going all right. I studied the columns leaving the camp, talked with Kraus, walked up the roads to observe a little farther on. Everywhere, I noticed abuses: the guards had prisoners pushing carts loaded with their things, or else forced them to carry their suitcases. Here and there by the side of the road I noticed a corpse lying in the snow, the head frequently bloody; the guards were applying Bär’s stern orders. Yet the columns were advancing without confusion and without any attempt at revolt. At midday I managed to make contact with Schmauser to discuss the problem of the clothes. He listened to me briefly and then swept aside my objections: “We can’t give them civilian clothing, they could escape.”—“Then shoes at least.” He hesitated. “Arrange things with Bär,” he said finally. He must have had other preoccupations, I could tell, but I would still have preferred a clear order. I went to find Bär at the Stammlager: “Obergruppenführer Schmauser has given the order to have shoes distributed to the inmates who don’t have any.” Bär shrugged: “Here, I don’t have any more, everything has already been loaded for shipment. Just see about it in Birkenau with Schwarzhuber.” I spent two hours finding this officer, the Lagerführer of Birkenau, who had left to inspect one of the columns. “Very well, I’ll take care of it,” he promised me when I gave him the order. Around nightfall, I found Elias and Darius, whom I had sent to inspect the evacuation of Monowitz and several Nebenlager. Everything was happening in a more or less orderly way, but already, by late afternoon, more and more inmates, exhausted, were stopping and letting themselves be shot by the guards. I left again with Piontek to inspect the nighttime stopover points. Despite Schmauser’s formal orders—there was a fear that inmates would take advantage of the darkness to escape—some columns were still advancing. I criticized the officers, but they replied that they hadn’t yet reached their designated stopping point, and that they couldn’t let their columns sleep outside, in the snow or on the ice. The points I visited turned out to be insufficient in any case: a barn or a school, for two thousand inmates, sometimes; many of them slept outside, huddled next to each other. I asked that fires be lit, but there was no wood, the trees were too damp and no one had tools to cut them down; where boards or old crates could be found, they made little campfires, but these didn’t last till dawn. No soup had been planned, the inmates were supposed to survive on what had been distributed in the camp; farther on, they assured me, there would be rations. Most of the columns hadn’t gone five kilometers; many were still in the almost deserted camp zone; at this pace, the marches would last ten to twelve days."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"> 00:00"|"after midnight"|"Things got gradually worse. The next morning, the columns kept on leaving the camps through the main gates, the guards were still manning the line of watchtowers, order reigned; but a few kilometers farther on, the columns began to grow longer and unravel as the weaker inmates slowed down. More and more corpses could be seen. It was snowing heavily, but it wasn’t too cold, for me in any case, I had seen much worse in Russia, but I was warmly dressed, I was traveling in a heated car, and the guards who had to walk had pullovers, good coats, and boots; as for the Häftlinge, they must have felt pierced through to the bone. The guards were getting more and more frightened, they shouted at the inmates and beat them. I saw one guard beating an inmate who had stopped to defecate; I reprimanded him, then asked the Untersturmführer who was in command of the column to place him under arrest; he replied that he didn’t have enough men to do that. In the villages, the Polish peasants, who were waiting for the Russians, watched the inmates pass by in silence, or shouted something at them in their language; the guards treated harshly those who tried to hand out bread or food; they were nervous, the villages were swarming with partisans, as everyone knew, they were afraid of being attacked. But at night, at the stopping points I visited, there still was no soup or bread, and many inmates had already finished their ration. I figured that at this rate half or two-thirds of the columns would drop off before reaching their destination. I ordered Piontek to drive me to Breslau. Because of the bad weather and the columns of refugees, I didn’t arrive until after midnight. Schmauser was already asleep and Boesenberg, they told me at HQ, had gone to Kattowitz, near the front. A poorly shaven officer showed me an operations map: the Russian positions, he explained, were mostly theoretical, since they were advancing so quickly they couldn’t keep the markings up to date; as for our divisions still shown on the map, some no longer existed at all, while others, according to fragmentary information, must have been moving as roving Kessels behind the Russian lines, trying to meet up with our retreating forces. Tarnowitz and Cracow had fallen in the afternoon. The Soviets were also entering eastern Prussia in force, and there was talk of worse atrocities than in Hungary. It was a catastrophe. But Schmauser, when he received me in midmorning, seemed calm and sure of himself. I described the situation to him and set out my demands: rations and wood for fires at the stopover points, and carts to transport the inmates who were too exhausted, so they could be cared for and put back to work instead of liquidated: “I’m not talking about people sick with typhus or tuberculosis, Obergruppenführer, but just the ones who aren’t up to the cold and hunger.”—“Our soldiers too are cold and hungry,” he retorted sharply. “The civilians too are cold and hungry. You don’t seem to realize the situation, Obersturmbannführer. We have a million and a half refugees on the roads. That’s much more important than your inmates.”—“Obergruppenführer, these inmates, as a labor force, are a vital resource for the Reich. We cannot allow ourselves, in the present situation, to lose twenty or thirty thousand of them.”—“I have no resources to allocate to you.”—“Then at least give me an order so I will be obeyed by the column leaders.” I typed out an order, in several copies for Elias and Darius, and Schmauser signed them in the afternoon; I left again immediately. The roads were horribly congested, endless columns of refugees on foot or in wagons, isolated trucks from the Wehrmacht, lost soldiers. In the villages, mobile canteens from the NSV distributed soup. I reached Auschwitz late; my colleagues had returned earlier and were already asleep. Bär, I was told, had left the camp, probably for good. I went to see Kraus and found him with Schurz, the head of the PA. I had brought along Drescher’s Armagnac, and we drank some together. Kraus explained that he had had Kremas I and II dynamited that morning, leaving IV till the last minute; he had also begun the liquidations that had been ordered, shooting two hundred Jewesses who had stayed in the Frauenlager in Birkenau; but Springorum, the President of the Kattowitz province, had taken away his Sonderkommando for urgent tasks and he didn’t have enough men to continue. All the fit inmates had left the camps, but there remained, according to him, within the entire complex, more than eight thousand inmates who were sick or too weak to walk. Massacring these people seemed to me, in the present state of things, perfectly idiotic and pointless, but Kraus had his orders, and it didn’t fall within my jurisdiction; and I had enough problems as it was with the columns of evacuees."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
12:00|noon|"Outside, it was snowing again, harder than ever. I returned to the station. A mass of inmates was waiting in an empty lot, sitting in the snow and the mud under the gusts of wind. I tried to have them come into the station, but the waiting rooms were occupied by soldiers from the Wehrmacht. I slept with Piontek in the car, overcome with fatigue. The next morning, the lot was deserted, aside from a few dozen snow-covered corpses. I tried to find the Obersturmführer from the day before, to see if he was following my instructions, but the immense futility of it all oppressed me and paralyzed my movements. At noon, I had made my decision. I ordered Piontek to find some gas, then, through the SP, I contacted Elias and Darius. By early afternoon I was on my way to Berlin."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"Around noon, a speech of the Führer’s was broadcast on the occasion of the twelfth (and, as it turned out, last) anniversary of the Seizure of Power. I listened without paying it much heed in the mess hall in Oranienburg, I don’t even remember what he said, he must still have been talking about the Asiatic flood of Bolshevism or something of the sort; what struck me above all was the reaction of the SS officers present: only some of them stood up to raise their arms when the national anthem was played at the end, a nonchalance that, a few months before, would have been deemed inadmissible, unpardonable. The same day, a Soviet submarine torpedoed the Wilhelm-Gustloff off the coast of Danzig, the jewel of Ley’s “Kraft durch Freude” fleet, which was transporting more than ten thousand evacuees, half of them children. There were almost no survivors. In the time it took me to return to Berlin the next day, the Russians had reached the Oder and had crossed it almost casually to occupy a wide bridgehead between Küstrin and Frankfurt. I was vomiting up almost every meal, I was afraid the fever might return."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 11:00"|"around 11:00 a.m."|"At the beginning of February, the Americans reappeared in full daylight above Berlin. Despite the prohibitions, the city was full of sour, aggressive refugees, who settled into the ruins and looted warehouses and stores without any interference from the police. I was passing by the Staatspolizei, it must have been around 11:00 a.m.; with the few officers who were still working there, I was directed to the antiaircraft shelter built in the garden, at the edge of the devastated park of the Prinz-Albrecht-Palais, itself an empty, roofless shell. This shelter, which wasn’t even underground, was basically a long cement hallway; it didn’t seem very reassuring to me, but I didn’t have a choice. Along with the officers from the Gestapo, they brought in some prisoners, scruffy men with chains on their feet, who must have been pulled out of the neighboring cells: I recognized some of them, July conspirators, whose photograph I had seen in the papers or on the news. The raid was incredibly violent; the squat bunker, whose walls were more than a meter thick, swayed from side to side like a linden tree in the wind. I felt as if I were in the heart of a hurricane, a storm not of the elements but of pure, wild noise, all the noise in the world unleashed. The pressure from the explosions pressed painfully on my eardrums, I couldn’t hear anything anymore; it hurt so much I was afraid they’d burst. I wanted to be swept away, crushed, I couldn’t bear it anymore. The prisoners, who had been forbidden to sit down, were lying on the ground, most of them rolled up in a ball. Then I was lifted from my seat as if by a giant hand and hurled in the air. When I opened my eyes, several faces were floating above me. They seemed to be shouting, I didn’t understand what they wanted. I shook my head but felt hands holding it firmly and forcing me to keep still. After the alert, they took me out. Thomas was supporting me. The sky, at high noon, was black with smoke; flames were licking the windows of the Staatspolizei building; in the park, trees were burning like torches, an entire section of the rear façade of the palace had collapsed. Thomas had me sit down on the remains of a pulverized bench. I touched my face: blood was flowing down my cheek. My ears were ringing, but I could distinguish sounds. Thomas turned to me: “Can you hear me?” I signaled that I could; despite the horrible pain in my ears, I understood what he was saying. “Don’t move. You took a bad crack.” A little later they loaded me into an Opel. On the Askanischer Platz, cars and twisted trucks were burning, the Anhalter Bahnhof seemed to have crumpled in on itself and was disgorging a black, acrid smoke, the Europa Haus and the buildings around it were also burning. Soldiers and auxiliaries, their faces black with soot, were vainly fighting the fires. I was driven to the Kurfürstenstrasse, to Eichmann’s offices, which were still standing. There I was laid down on a table, among other wounded. A Hauptsturmführer arrived, the doctor whom I knew but whose name I had again forgotten: “You again,” he said amiably. Thomas told him that my head had hit the wall of the bunker and that I had lost consciousness for about twenty minutes. The doctor had me stick out my tongue and then aimed a dazzling light into my eyes. “You have a concussion,” he said. He turned to Thomas: “Have him get an X-ray of his skull. If there’s no fracture, three weeks’ rest.” He scribbled a note on a piece of paper, gave it to Thomas, and disappeared. Thomas said to me: “I’m going to find you a hospital for the X-ray. If they don’t keep you there, come back to my place to rest. I’ll take care of Grothmann.” I laughed: “What if there is no more ‘your place’?” He shrugged: “Then come back here.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"~ 12:00"|"Around noon"|"I got up early and crossed the empty, silent house. In the kitchen I found some bread, some butter, honey, and coffee, and I ate. Then I went into the living room and examined the books in the library. There were a lot of volumes in German but also in English, Italian, Russian; I ended up choosing, with a rush of pleasure, L’Éducation sentimentale, which I found in French. I sat down near a window and read for a few hours, raising my head from time to time to look at the woods and the gray sky. Around noon, I fixed an omelette with bacon for myself, and ate at the old wooden table that took up the corner of the kitchen, pouring myself some beer, which I drank in long draughts. I made some coffee and smoked a cigarette, then decided to take a walk. I put on my officer’s coat without buttoning it: it was still warm out, the snow wasn’t melting but was hardening and forming a crust. I set out across the garden and entered the forest. The pines were well spaced out, very tall, they rose and at the very top came together like a vast vault set on columns. There were still patches of snow in places, the bare ground was hard, red, carpeted with dry needles that crackled under my steps. I came to a sandy path, a straight line between the pines. Tracks of wagon wheels were imprinted in the ground; by the edge of the path, here and there, logs were carefully piled up. The path led to a gray river, a dozen meters wide; on the far shore rose a plowed field whose black furrows streaked the snow, running up to a beech wood. I turned right and entered the forest, following the course of the gently murmuring river. As I walked, I imagined Una walking with me. She was wearing a wool skirt and boots, a man’s leather jacket, and her large knit shawl. I saw her walking in front of me, with a sure, calm step, I watched her, aware of the play of her muscles and thighs, her buttocks, her proud, straight back. I couldn’t imagine anything nobler or truer or more beautiful. Farther on, oak and beech trees mixed with the pines, the ground became swampy, covered with waterlogged dead leaves through which my feet sank into a mud that was still hard from the cold. But a little farther along, the ground rose slightly and became dry and pleasant underfoot again. Here there were almost nothing but pines, thin and arrow-straight, young stock replanted after clear-cutting. Then finally the forest opened onto a brushy, cold, almost snowless meadow, looking down on the still water of the lake. To the right I saw a few houses, the road, the crest of the isthmus crowned with firs and birches. I knew that the river was called the Drage, and that it went from this lake to the Dratzig-See and then continued on to the Krössin-See, where there was an SS school, near Falkenburg. I looked at the gray expanse of the lake: around it lay the same ordered landscape of black earth and woods. I followed its bank to the village. A farmer in his garden hailed me, and I exchanged a few words with him; he was worried, he was afraid of the Russians, I couldn’t give him any definite news but I knew he was right to be afraid. At the road, I headed left and slowly climbed the long hill between the two lakes. The slopes were steep and hid the water from me. At the top of the isthmus, I climbed the hillock and went between the trees, pushing the branches aside, to a place overlooking, from high up, a bay that opened up into wide, irregular planes of water. The immobility of the water, of the black forests on the other bank, gave this landscape a solemn, mysterious look, like a kingdom beyond life, yet still on this side of death, a land between the two. I lit a cigarette and looked at the lake. A childhood conversation came to my mind, my sister, one day, had told me an old Pomeranian myth, the legend of Vineta, a beautiful, arrogant city swallowed up in the Baltic, whose bells fishermen still heard ringing on the water at noon, somewhere near Kolberg, it was said. This rich, great city, she had explained to me with her childlike seriousness, was lost because of the limitless desire of a woman, the king’s daughter. Many sailors and knights came to drink and amuse themselves there, handsome, strong men, full of life. Every night, the king’s daughter went out disguised into the town, she went down to the inns, the most sordid dens, and there she chose a man. She brought him back to her palace and made love to him all night; in the morning, the man was dead of exhaustion. Not one, even the strongest, resisted her insatiable desire. She had their corpses thrown into the sea, into a storm-tossed bay. But being unable to satisfy the immensity of her desire only excited that desire more. She could be seen walking on the beach, singing for the Ocean, to whom she wanted to make love. Only the Ocean, she sang, would be vast enough, powerful enough to fulfill her desire. Finally one night, unable to stand it any longer, she went out of her palace naked, leaving the corpse of her last lover in her bed. There was a storm that night, the Ocean was lashing the sea wall protecting the city. She went out onto the dyke and opened the great bronze door placed there by her father. The Ocean entered the city, took the princess and made her his wife, and kept the drowned city as her dowry. When Una had finished her story, I had pointed out that it was the same as the French legend of the city of Ys. “Indeed,” she had retorted haughtily, “but this one is more beautiful.”—“If I understand it correctly, it explains that the order of the city is incompatible with the insatiable pleasure of women.”—“I would say, rather, the excessive pleasure of women. But what you are proposing is a man’s morality. I believe that all these ideas—moderation, morality—were invented by men to compensate for the limits of their pleasure. For men have known for a long time that their pleasure can never be compared to the pleasure we endure, which is of a different order.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"

"~ 01:00"|"Around one in the morning"|"In Berlin, we had some trouble justifying ourselves, but less than I expected; not like ordinary soldiers, who were unceremoniously hanged or shot on suspicion alone. Even before shaving or washing, Thomas went to present himself to Kaltenbrunner, whose headquarters were now in the Kurfürstenstrasse, in Eichmann’s old premises, one of the last RSHA buildings still pretty much standing. Since I didn’t know where to report to—even Grothmann had left Berlin—I accompanied him. We had agreed on a story that was for the most part plausible: I was taking advantage of my leave to try to evacuate my sister and her husband, and the Russian offensive had caught me short with Thomas, who had come to help me; Thomas had had the foresight to provide himself with a mission order from Huppenkothen before leaving. Kaltenbrunner listened to us in silence and then dismissed us without any comment, informing me that the Reichsführer, who had resigned the day before from his command of Army Group Vistula, was in Hohenlychen. The report on Piontek’s death took me no time at all, but I had to fill out a number of forms to justify the loss of the vehicle. In the evening, we went to Thomas’s place, in Wannsee: the house was intact, but there was neither electricity nor running water, and we could only have a quick wash with cold water, and shave with difficulty before going to bed. The next morning, wearing a clean uniform, I went to Hohenlychen to present myself to Brandt. As soon as he saw me, he ordered me to shower, have my hair cut, and come back when I looked presentable. The hospital had hot showers, I spent almost an hour under the stream of water, voluptuously; then I went to the barber and, while I was at it, had myself shaved with hot water and sprinkled with eau de Cologne. Almost cheerful, I went back to see Brandt. He listened to my story severely, berated me curtly for having cost the Reich, through my imprudence, several weeks of my work, then informed me that in the meantime I had been reported missing; my office was dissolved, my colleagues reassigned, and my files archived. For now, the Reichsführer had no more need of my services; and Brandt ordered me to return to Berlin to put myself at Kaltenbrunner’s disposal. After the interview, his secretary led me into his office and handed me my personal mail, transmitted by Asbach when the Oranienburg office was closed: mostly bills, a note from Ohlendorf about my wound in February, and a letter from Helene, which I pocketed without opening. Then I went back to Berlin. A chaotic atmosphere reigned at the Kurfürstenstrasse: the building now housed the headquarters of the RSHA and of the Staatspolizei, as well as numerous representatives of the SD; everyone needed more room, hardly anyone knew what he was supposed to be doing, all wandered aimlessly through the hallways, trying to look busy. Since Kaltenbrunner couldn’t receive me before nightfall, I settled into a chair in a corner and resumed my reading of L’Éducation sentimentale, which had suffered again from the crossing of the Oder, but which I was determined to finish. Kaltenbrunner had me summoned just as Frédéric meets Madame Arnoux for the last time; it was frustrating. He could have waited a little, especially since he had no idea what to do with me. He ended up, almost at random, appointing me liaison officer with the OKW. My work consisted of this: three times a day, I had to go to the Bendlerstrasse and bring back dispatches about the situation on the front; the rest of the time, I could calmly daydream. The Flaubert was soon finished, but I found other books. I could also have gone out walking, but that wasn’t recommended. The city was in a bad state. Everywhere, windows were gaping; one regularly heard part of some building collapse with a huge roar. In the streets, teams of people tirelessly cleared away the rubble and piled it up in neatly spaced heaps so that the rare cars could pass, slaloming their way through, but often these piles too toppled over, and they had to start again. The spring air was acrid, full of black smoke and brick dust gritty in the teeth. The last major raid had occurred three days before our return: on that occasion, the Luftwaffe had introduced its new weapon, surprisingly rapid jet aircraft, which had inflicted some losses on the enemy; since then, there had been only harassing Mosquito raids. The Sunday after our arrival was the first fine spring day of 1945: in the Tiergarten, the trees were budding, grass was appearing on the heaps of debris and turning the gardens green. But we had few occasions to take advantage of the nice weather. Food rations, ever since the loss of the eastern territories, were reduced to a strict minimum; even the best restaurants didn’t have much. The ministries were being emptied of their personnel to fill out the Wehrmacht, but with the destruction of most of the index files and the general disorganization, most of the men thus freed waited for weeks to be called up. At the Kurfürstenstrasse, they had set up an office that delivered false papers from the Wehrmacht or from other organizations to senior RSHA officials who were regarded as compromised. Thomas had several cards made up for himself, all different, and showed them to me, laughing: engineer at Krupp’s, Hauptmann of the Wehrmacht, civil servant in the Ministry of Agriculture. He wanted me to do the same, but I kept putting it off; instead I had another pay book and SD card made up, to replace the ones I had destroyed in Pomerania. From time to time, I saw Eichmann, who was still hanging around there, completely dejected. He was very nervous, he knew that if our enemies got their hands on him, he was finished, he wondered what was going to happen to him. He had sent his family away and wanted to join them; I saw him one day in a hallway arguing bitterly, probably about this, with Blobel, who was also wandering about without knowing what to do, almost constantly drunk, hateful, enraged. A few days before, Eichmann had met the Reichsführer in Hohenlychen, and had returned from this interview extremely depressed; he invited me to his office to drink some schnapps and to listen to him talk, he seemed to have a certain regard for me and treated me almost as his confidant, though I had no idea why. I drank in silence and let him vent. “I don’t understand,” he said plaintively, pushing his glasses back up on his nose. “The Reichsführer said to me: ‘Eichmann, if I had to start over again, I’d organize the concentration camps as the British do.’ That’s what he said to me. He added: ‘I made a mistake there.’ What could he have meant? I don’t understand. Do you understand? Maybe he meant the camps should have been, I don’t know, more elegant, more artful, more polite.” I didn’t understand what the Reichsführer had meant, either, but it was all the same to me, really. I knew from Thomas, who had immediately plunged back into his intrigues, that Himmler, prompted by his Finnish masseur, Kersten, and by Schellenberg, kept making gestures—mostly incoherent ones, to tell the truth—toward the Anglo-Americans: “Schellenberg managed to get him to say: ‘I protect the throne. That doesn’t necessarily mean the one who is sitting on it.’ That’s real progress,” Thomas explained to me.—“Truly. Tell me, Thomas, why are you still in Berlin?” The Russians had stopped on the Oder, but everyone knew it was just a question of time. Thomas smiled: “Schellenberg asked me to stay. To keep an eye on Kaltenbrunner and especially Müller. They’re running a bit wild.” Everyone, in fact, was running a bit wild, Himmler first and foremost, Schellenberg, Kammler who now had his own direct access to the Führer and no longer listened to the Reichsführer; Speer, it was said, was racing around the Ruhr trying, in the face of the American advance, to countermand the Führer’s destruction orders. The population was losing all hope, and Goebbels’s propaganda wasn’t helping things: by way of consolation, he promised that in case of defeat the Führer, in his great wisdom, was preparing an easy death, by gas, for the German people. That was very encouraging and it led the malicious to suggest: “What is a coward? It’s a guy who’s in Berlin and who signs up for the front.” The second week of April, the Philharmonic gave a final concert. The program, execrable, was entirely in the taste of that period—Brünnhilde’s last aria, the Götterdämmerung of course, and to end it all Bruckner’s Romantic Symphony—but I went all the same. The icy auditorium was intact, the chandeliers shone with all their lights; I could see Speer, from a distance, with Admiral Dönitz in the box of honor; at the exit, uniformed Hitlerjugend holding baskets offered members of the audience cyanide capsules: I was almost tempted to swallow one on the spot, in a fit of pique. Flaubert, I was sure, would have had a fit in front of such a display of inanity. These ostentatious demonstrations of pessimism alternated with ecstatic effusions of optimistic joy: the same day as this famous concert, Roosevelt died, and Goebbels, confusing Truman with Peter III, immediately launched a new slogan, “The Czarina is dead.” Soldiers claimed they had seen the face of “Uncle Fritz” in the clouds, and were promised a decisive counteroffensive and victory for the Führer’s birthday, on April 20. Thomas, at least, even though he didn’t give up his maneuvering, still kept his wits about him; he had managed to send his parents through to the Tyrol, near Innsbruck, to a zone that would certainly be occupied by the Americans: “Kaltenbrunner took care of it. Through the Gestapo in Vienna.” And when I showed a little surprise: “He’s an understanding man, is Kaltenbrunner. He has a family too, he knows what it means.” Thomas had immediately resumed his frantic social life and took me from party to party, where I drank myself into a stupor as he exaggeratedly narrated our Pomeranian wanderings to titillated ladies. There were parties every night, pretty much everywhere, people no longer paid any attention to the Mosquito raids or to the propaganda orders. Beneath the Wilhelmplatz, a bunker had been transformed into a nightclub, very cheerful, where they served wine, hard liquor, brand-name cigars, fancy hors d’oeuvres; the place was frequented by high-ranking officers from the OKW, the SS, and the RSHA, wealthy civilians and aristocrats, as well as actresses and flirtatious young ladies, superbly decked out. We dined almost every evening at the Adlon, where the maître d’hôtel, solemn and impassive, welcomed us in a tailcoat, led us into the well-lit restaurant, and had us served, by waiters wearing tails, purple slices of cabbage in silver dishes. The basement bar was always crowded, packed with the last diplomats, Italian, Japanese, Hungarian, or French. I met Mihaï there one night, dressed in white, with a canary yellow silk shirt. “Still in Berlin?” he asked me with a smile. “It’s been a long time since I saw you last.” He began openly flirting with me, in front of several people. I took him by the arm and, squeezing him tightly, drew him aside: “Stop,” I ordered.—“Stop what?” he said, smiling. This smug, calculating smile drove me out of my mind. “Come on,” I said, and pushed him discreetly into the bathroom. It was a large white tiled room, with massive sinks and urinals, brightly lit. I checked the stalls: they were empty. Then I shot the bolt on the door. Mihaï was looking at me, smiling, one hand in the pocket of his white jacket, next to the sinks with their big brass faucets. He came toward me, still with his eager smile; when he raised his head to kiss me, I took off my cap and hit him hard in the face with my forehead. His nose, under the violence of the blow, burst, blood gushed out, he screamed and fell to the ground. I stepped over him, still holding my cap, and went to look at myself in the mirror: I had blood on my forehead, but my collar and uniform weren’t stained. I carefully washed my face and put my cap back on. On the ground, Mihaï was writhing in pain and holding his nose, groaning pitifully: “Why’d you do that?” His hand found the hem of my pants; I removed my foot and looked around the room. A mop was leaning in a corner, in a galvanized metal bucket. I took this mop, placed the handle across Mihaï’s neck, and stood on it; with one foot to each side of his neck, I rocked slowly on the handle. Mihaï’s face beneath me became red, scarlet, then purplish-blue; his jaw quivered convulsively, his bulging eyes stared at me with terror, his nails scratched my boots; behind me, his feet beat the tiled floor. He wanted to speak, but no sound came out of his mouth from which a swollen, obscene tongue stuck out. He emptied himself with a soft noise and the stench of shit filled the room; his legs struck the ground one last time, then fell limp. I got down off the mop, set it aside, tapped Mihaï’s cheek with the tip of my boot. His inert head rolled a bit, then slowly came back. I took him by the armpits, dragged him into one of the stalls, and sat him down on the toilet, making sure the feet were straight. These stalls had latches that pivoted on a screw: by holding the raised latch with the tip of my pocketknife, I could shut the door and make it fall so as to lock the stall from inside. A little blood had run on the tiled floor; I used the mop to clean it, then rinsed it off, wiped the handle with my handkerchief, and put it back in the bucket where I had found it. Finally I went out. I went to the bar to get a drink; people were going in and out of the bathroom, no one seemed to notice anything. An acquaintance came over to ask me: “Have you seen Mihaï?” I looked around: “No, he must be somewhere around.” I finished my drink and went to chat with Thomas. Around one in the morning, there was a disturbance: someone had found the body. Diplomats uttered horrified exclamations, the police came, they questioned us, like everyone else I said I hadn’t seen a thing. I never heard anything more about this business. The Russian offensive was finally under way: on April 16, at night, they attacked the Seelow Heights, our last defensive position before the city. The sky was overcast, it was drizzling; I spent the day and then part of the night carrying dispatches from the Bendlerstrasse to the Kurfürstenstrasse, a short trip complicated by the incessant Sturmovik raids. Around midnight, I ran into Osnabrugge at the Bendlerstrasse: he looked lost, exhausted. “They want to blow up all the bridges in the city.” He was almost weeping. “Well,” I said, “if the enemy’s advancing, that’s normal, isn’t it?”—“You don’t realize what that means! There are nine hundred and fifty bridges in Berlin. If we blow them up, the city dies! Forever. No more food supplies, no more industry. Even worse, all the electric cables, all the water pipes pass through these bridges. Can you picture it? The epidemics, the people dying of hunger in the ruins?” I shrugged: “We can’t just hand the city over to the Russians.”—“But that’s no reason to demolish everything! We can choose, we can just destroy the bridges on the main routes.” He was wiping his forehead. “In any case, I’ll say this to you, have me shot if you want, but for me it’s the last time. When this madness is over, I don’t care who I have to work for, I’m going to build. They’ll have to rebuild, won’t they?”—“No doubt. Would you still know how to build a bridge?”—“Probably, probably,” he said as he moved off, nodding gently. Later on, that same night, I found Thomas in the Wannsee house. He wasn’t sleeping, he was sitting alone in the living room, in shirtsleeves, drinking. “So?” he asked me.—“We still hold the Seelow redoubt. But farther south, their tanks are crossing the Neisse.” He made a grimace: “Yes. Well. In any case it’s kaput.” I took off my wet cap and coat and poured myself a drink. “It’s really over, then?”—“It’s over,” Thomas confirmed.—“Defeat, again?”—“Yes, once again, defeat.”—“And afterward?”—“Afterward? We’ll see. Germany won’t be wiped off the map, whatever Herr Morgenthau may say. The unnatural alliance of our enemies will hold up until their victory, but not much longer. The Western powers will need a bastion against Bolshevism. I give them three years, at most.” I drank and listened. “I wasn’t talking about that,” I said finally.—“Ah. Us, you mean?”—“Yes, us. Accounts will have to be settled.”—“Why didn’t you have some ID papers made up?”—“I don’t know. I don’t really believe in them. What will we do, with these papers? Sooner or later, they’ll find us. Then it’ll be the rope or Siberia.” Thomas swirled the liquid around in his glass: “It’s obvious that we’ll have to leave for a while. Lie low a bit, long enough for people to calm down. Then we can come back. The new Germany, whatever it might be, will need brains.”—“Go? Where? And how?” He looked at me, smiling: “You think we haven’t thought of that? There are networks, in Holland, in Switzerland, people ready to help us, out of conviction or self-interest. The best networks are in Italy. In Rome. The Church will not let down its flock in its time of distress.” He raised his glass as if for a toast, and drank. “Schellenberg, Wolfie too, have received good guarantees. Of course, it won’t be easy. Endgames are always delicate.”—“And afterward?”—“We’ll see. South America, the sun, the pampas, the horses, doesn’t that tempt you? Or, if you like, the pyramids. The British are going to pull out, they’ll need good specialists, over there.” I poured myself some more and drank: “What if Berlin is surrounded? How do you plan on getting out? Are you staying?”—“Yes, I’m staying. Kaltenbrunner and Müller are still giving us a hard time. They’re really not reasonable. But I’ve thought it over. Come and see.” He led me into his bedroom, opened his wardrobe, took out some clothes, which he spread out on the bed: “Look.” They were coarse work clothes made of blue canvas, stained with oil and grease. “Look at the labels.” I looked: they were French clothes. “I also have shoes, the beret, the armband, everything. And the papers. Here.” He showed me the papers: they were those of a French worker from the STO. “Of course, in France, I’ll have trouble passing, but it will be enough for the Russians. Even if I come across an officer who speaks French, it’s not very likely he’ll balk at my accent. I can always tell him I’m Alsatian.”—“That’s not a bad idea,” I said. “Where did you find all that?” He tapped the rim of his glass and smiled: “You think they count foreign workers these days, in Berlin? One more, one less…” He drank. “You should think about it. With your French, you could get as far as Paris.” We went back downstairs to the living room. He poured me another glass and clinked glasses with me. “It won’t be without risks,” he said laughing. “But what is? We got out of Stalingrad. You have to be clever, that’s all. You know that there are guys in the Gestapo who are trying to get themselves stars and Jewish papers?” He laughed again. “They’re having a hard time of it. There aren’t a lot left on the market.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 00:00"|"Around midnight"|"In Berlin, we had some trouble justifying ourselves, but less than I expected; not like ordinary soldiers, who were unceremoniously hanged or shot on suspicion alone. Even before shaving or washing, Thomas went to present himself to Kaltenbrunner, whose headquarters were now in the Kurfürstenstrasse, in Eichmann’s old premises, one of the last RSHA buildings still pretty much standing. Since I didn’t know where to report to—even Grothmann had left Berlin—I accompanied him. We had agreed on a story that was for the most part plausible: I was taking advantage of my leave to try to evacuate my sister and her husband, and the Russian offensive had caught me short with Thomas, who had come to help me; Thomas had had the foresight to provide himself with a mission order from Huppenkothen before leaving. Kaltenbrunner listened to us in silence and then dismissed us without any comment, informing me that the Reichsführer, who had resigned the day before from his command of Army Group Vistula, was in Hohenlychen. The report on Piontek’s death took me no time at all, but I had to fill out a number of forms to justify the loss of the vehicle. In the evening, we went to Thomas’s place, in Wannsee: the house was intact, but there was neither electricity nor running water, and we could only have a quick wash with cold water, and shave with difficulty before going to bed. The next morning, wearing a clean uniform, I went to Hohenlychen to present myself to Brandt. As soon as he saw me, he ordered me to shower, have my hair cut, and come back when I looked presentable. The hospital had hot showers, I spent almost an hour under the stream of water, voluptuously; then I went to the barber and, while I was at it, had myself shaved with hot water and sprinkled with eau de Cologne. Almost cheerful, I went back to see Brandt. He listened to my story severely, berated me curtly for having cost the Reich, through my imprudence, several weeks of my work, then informed me that in the meantime I had been reported missing; my office was dissolved, my colleagues reassigned, and my files archived. For now, the Reichsführer had no more need of my services; and Brandt ordered me to return to Berlin to put myself at Kaltenbrunner’s disposal. After the interview, his secretary led me into his office and handed me my personal mail, transmitted by Asbach when the Oranienburg office was closed: mostly bills, a note from Ohlendorf about my wound in February, and a letter from Helene, which I pocketed without opening. Then I went back to Berlin. A chaotic atmosphere reigned at the Kurfürstenstrasse: the building now housed the headquarters of the RSHA and of the Staatspolizei, as well as numerous representatives of the SD; everyone needed more room, hardly anyone knew what he was supposed to be doing, all wandered aimlessly through the hallways, trying to look busy. Since Kaltenbrunner couldn’t receive me before nightfall, I settled into a chair in a corner and resumed my reading of L’Éducation sentimentale, which had suffered again from the crossing of the Oder, but which I was determined to finish. Kaltenbrunner had me summoned just as Frédéric meets Madame Arnoux for the last time; it was frustrating. He could have waited a little, especially since he had no idea what to do with me. He ended up, almost at random, appointing me liaison officer with the OKW. My work consisted of this: three times a day, I had to go to the Bendlerstrasse and bring back dispatches about the situation on the front; the rest of the time, I could calmly daydream. The Flaubert was soon finished, but I found other books. I could also have gone out walking, but that wasn’t recommended. The city was in a bad state. Everywhere, windows were gaping; one regularly heard part of some building collapse with a huge roar. In the streets, teams of people tirelessly cleared away the rubble and piled it up in neatly spaced heaps so that the rare cars could pass, slaloming their way through, but often these piles too toppled over, and they had to start again.

The British are going to pull out, they’ll need good specialists, over there.” I poured myself some more and drank: “What if Berlin is surrounded? How do you plan on getting out? Are you staying?”—“Yes, I’m staying. Kaltenbrunner and Müller are still giving us a hard time. They’re really not reasonable. But I’ve thought it over. Come and see.” He led me into his bedroom, opened his wardrobe, took out some clothes, which he spread out on the bed: “Look.” They were coarse work clothes made of blue canvas, stained with oil and grease. “Look at the labels.” I looked: they were French clothes. “I also have shoes, the beret, the armband, everything. And the papers. Here.” He showed me the papers: they were those of a French worker from the STO. “Of course, in France, I’ll have trouble passing, but it will be enough for the Russians. Even if I come across an officer who speaks French, it’s not very likely he’ll balk at my accent. I can always tell him I’m Alsatian.”—“That’s not a bad idea,” I said. “Where did you find all that?” He tapped the rim of his glass and smiled: “You think they count foreign workers these days, in Berlin? One more, one less…” He drank. “You should think about it. With your French, you could get as far as Paris.” We went back downstairs to the living room. He poured me another glass and clinked glasses with me. “It won’t be without risks,” he said laughing. “But what is? We got out of Stalingrad. You have to be clever, that’s all. You know that there are guys in the Gestapo who are trying to get themselves stars and Jewish papers?” He laughed again. “They’re having a hard time of it. There aren’t a lot left on the market.”"|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
"~ 00:00"|"around midnight"|"Trevor-Roper, I know, never breathed a word about this episode, nor has Bullock, nor any of the historians who have studied the Führer’s last days. Yet it did take place, I assure you. This silence of the chroniclers is understandable: Müller disappeared, killed or gone over to the Russians a few days later; Bormann certainly died trying to flee Berlin; the two generals must have been Krebs and Burgdorf, who committed suicide; the adjutant must be dead too. As for the RSHA officers who witnessed the incident, I don’t know what became of them, but one can easily imagine, given their service record, that the ones who survived the war must not have bragged about being decorated by the Führer in person three days before his death. So it’s entirely possible that this minor incident indeed escaped the attention of researchers (but perhaps some trace of it remains in the Soviet archives?). I was dragged to the surface up a long stairway that opened onto the chancellery gardens. The magnificent building lay in ruins, gutted by bombs and shells, but a fragrant smell of jasmine and hyacinth filled the cool air. I was brutally pushed into a car and driven to the nearby church; there, they led me down into the bunker and threw me unceremoniously into a concrete room, bare and wet. Puddles dotted the ground; the walls were sweating; and the lock on the heavy metal door plunged me into absolute, uterine darkness: even with my eyes open wide, not the slightest ray of light filtered through. I remained like this for several hours, wet and cold. Then they came to get me. They tied me to a chair, I blinked, the light hurt me; Müller in person interrogated me; they beat me with truncheons, on my ribs, shoulders, and arms, Müller too came over and boxed me with his big peasant’s fists. I tried to explain that my thoughtless gesture meant nothing, that I hadn’t premeditated it, that I had just gone blank, but Müller wouldn’t believe me, he saw a carefully prepared conspiracy, he wanted me to name my accomplices. No matter how much I protested, he wouldn’t give up: when Müller set his mind on something, he knew how to stick to it. Finally they threw me back into my cell, where I remained lying in the puddles, waiting for the pain to subside. I must have fallen asleep like this, my head half in the water. I woke up chilled to the bone and twisted with cramps; the door was opening, another man was being shoved in. I just had time to glimpse an SS officer’s uniform, without medals or insignia. In the darkness, I heard him swearing in a Bavarian dialect: “Isn’t there a dry place in here?”—“Try near the walls,” I murmured politely.—“Who’re you?” His voice barked vulgarly, though in a cultivated tone. “Me? I’m Obersturmbannführer Dr. Aue, from the SD. And you?” His voice became calmer: “My apologies, Obersturmbannführer. I’m Gruppenführer Fegelein. Ex-Gruppenführer Fegelein,” he added with a rather pointed irony. I knew him by name: he had replaced Wolff as the Reichsführer’s liaison officer to the Führer; before, he had commanded an SS cavalry division in Russia, chasing partisans and Jews in the Pripet marshes. At the Reichsführung, he was said to be ambitious, a gambler, a good-looking braggart. I leaned up on my elbows: “And what brings you here, ex-Gruppenführer?”—“Oh, it’s a misunderstanding. I’d had a little to drink and I was at home, with a girl; those lunatics in the bunker thought I wanted to desert. Another one of Bormann’s tricks, I’ll bet. They’ve all gone mad over there; their Walhalla business is not for me, thanks. But it should get sorted out, my sister-in-law will take care of it.” I didn’t know who he was talking about, but I didn’t say anything. It was only when I read Trevor-Roper, years later, that I understood: Fegelein had married the sister of Eva Braun, whose existence I was unaware of at the time, like pretty much everyone else. This highly diplomatic marriage, unfortunately, proved of little help to him: despite his connections, his charm, and his easy tongue, Fegelein was shot the following night in the chancellery gardens (this too, I only learned much later). “And you, Obersturmbannführer?” Fegelein asked. Then I told him my misadventure. “Ah!” he exclaimed. “That was smart. So that’s why they’re all in such a bad mood. I thought that Müller was going to tear my head off, the brute.”—“Oh, he hit you too?”—“Yes. He got it into his head that the girl I was with is a British spy. I don’t know what’s gotten into him all of a sudden.”—“It’s true,” I said, remembering Thomas’s words: “Gruppenführer Müller is looking for a spy, a mole.”—“That’s possible,” he muttered. “But it has nothing to do with me.”—“Excuse me,” I interrupted, “do you know what time it is?”—“Not exactly. It must be around midnight, one o’clock?”—“Then we should get some sleep,” I suggested pleasantly.—“I’d have preferred my bed,” Fegelein grumbled.—“I can only agree.” I dragged myself on the ground against the wall and dozed off; my hips were still in the water, but it was better than my head. I slept well and had pleasant dreams; I emerged from them regretfully, but I was being kicked in the ribs. “Get up!” a voice shouted. I stood up with difficulty. Fegelein was sitting by the door, his arms around his knees; when I went out, he smiled at me timidly and made a little sign with his hand. They took me up to the church: two men in civilian clothes were waiting, policemen, one of them with a revolver in his hand; there were also SS men in uniform with them. The policeman with the revolver took me by the arm, pulled me into the street, and shoved me into an Opel; the others got in too. “Where are we going?” I asked the policeman who was driving the barrel of the revolver into my ribs. “Shut your face!” he barked. The car started off, turned onto Mauerstrasse, went about a hundred meters; I heard a high-pitched whistle; an enormous explosion lifted the car and threw it onto its side. The policeman, beneath me, pulled the trigger, I think: I remember having the impression that his shot killed one of the men in front. The other policeman, covered in blood, had fallen inert on top of me. I kicked and elbowed my way out of the overturned car through the rear window, cutting myself a little on the way. Other shells were falling nearby, projecting huge showers of bricks and earth. I was deafened, my ears were ringing. I collapsed onto the sidewalk and lay there for a minute, stunned. The policeman tumbled out behind me and rolled heavily onto my legs. With one hand I found a brick and struck his head with it. We rolled together in the rubble, coated with red brick dust and mud; I hit him with all my strength, but it’s not easy to knock out a man with a brick, especially if this brick has already burned. At the third or fourth blow, it crumbled in my hand. I cast around for another one, or for a stone, but the man knocked me over and began strangling me. The blood running down his face traced furrows in the red dust covering it, his eyes were mad, rolling wildly. My hand finally found a cobblestone and I slammed it up and sideways into him. He collapsed on top of me. I freed myself and pounded at his head till his skull burst, leaking brains mixed with dust and hair. Then I stood up, still deafened. I looked for his revolver, but he must have left it in the car, one wheel of which was still spinning in the air. The three other men inside looked dead. For now the shells had stopped falling. I began to run limping down Mauerstrasse."|"The Kindly Ones"|"Jonathan Littell"
